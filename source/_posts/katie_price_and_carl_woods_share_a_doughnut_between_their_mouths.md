They've been dating since July and before Katie Price broke both of her feet in a freak accident while on holiday in Turkey. 

But she and boyfriend Carl Woods, 31, don't seem to be letting that get them down too much as they enjoyed a PDA-filled trip to Alton Towers on Sunday. 

The couple treated themselves to a bag of 40 doughnuts while there and they could be seen sharing one, both placing it in their mouths at the same time.

Could have just bought two: Katie Price and Carl Woods shared a doughnut between their mouths during a PDA-filled trip to Alton Towers on Sunday 

Riding high: After that, Carl took a breather as he mounted Katie on her mobility scooter - she recently broke both her feet after jumping off a wall in Turkey 

Then Carl mounted Katie, 42, on top of her mobility scooter, which she has been using to get around, following her recent operation on both feet. 

The pair were at the theme park to celebrate the opening weekend of Oktoberfest and Katie had three of her five children with her. 

Princess, 13, brought along a friend and Bunny, five, and Jett. six, were also present. 

Living it up: The pair were at the theme park to celebrate the opening weekend of Oktoberfest and Katie had three of her five children with her, plus a couple of pals 

Showing off those pearly whites: Carl bought a bag of 40 doughnuts and was really getting stuck in to them 

Loved up: Carl and Katie held hands throughout the day, despite her being on her scooter 

Not letting it stop them: They happily embraced one another, making the most of Katie's horrendous situation after she was told she might not walk for two years 

Harvey, 18, from Katie's relationship with footballer Dwight York, 48, was not with them on the day, nor was Junior, 15, from Katie's marriage to Peter Andre, 47. 

Despite whizzing around on her scooter, Katie and Carl held hands as they walked around the attraction, with Bunny joining her on the scooter at various points.  

And Carl appeared to be every inch the gent as he won two giant teddies for his love as well as lots of little cuddly toys which Katie carried in the basket of her scooter.

Making memories: Princess and Jett sat next to one another on one of the rides as they enjoyed the weekend's fantastic weather 

With her feet and legs still in braces, after recently having her stitches removed, Katie stood up momentarily to shoot some basketball hoops.

But she was soon back on her scooter, with Carl jumping on the back of it for fun.    

Earlier in the day, Katie revealed her son Harvey wants Carl to be his dad. 

The glamour model has been dating former Love Island star Carl for three months, yet things have moved very quickly between the pair. 

A moment: Katie and Carl watched from the sidelines, with the glamour model placing a tender arm around his shoulder 

A laugh a minute: Katie and Carl flashed their matching smiles as they had a fun day out

Harvey, who has multiple disabilities including blindness, Prader-Willi syndrome and ADHA, does not have a relationship with his biological father, Dwight. 

In an Instagram video shared on Sunday, Katie asked 'Harv, what do you want mummy and Carl to do?' to which the teenager responded: 'Be with mummy and Harvey and Carl... your daddy.' 

Katie confirmed: 'You want Carl to be your what?' as her son responded, 'Harvey's daddy.'

As Katie asked Harvey 'Do you? Do you love Carl that much?' he replied, 'Yes mum.'

As she added, 'You're so cute,' Katie says, Harvey went, 'I know, tell me about it.'   

Pretty pleased with himself: Carl won lots of cuddly toys for the family

This is huge! Princess and Bunny couldn't believe their luck with the prize 

Tender: Katie stroked Carl's leg as he placed it across hers during their day out 

Cosy: Katie wrapped son Jett up in a towel after he got cold following a go on a water ride
