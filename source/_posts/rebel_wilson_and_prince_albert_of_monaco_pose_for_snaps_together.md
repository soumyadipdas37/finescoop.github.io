Rebel Wilson debuted her romance with new boyfriend Jacob Busch this week, with the pair attending a red carpet event together in Monaco.

And now the Hollywood couple are getting the royal treatment as they met with Prince Albert of Monaco while visiting an exhibit at Villa Paloma Monaco in Monte-Carlo.

The Australian actress, 40, posed up a storm with the 62-year-old royal when appearing at the event for renowned Spanish painter Joan Miró. 

Looking effortlessly glamorous in a pink floor-length gown, Rebel sported a black face mask while chatting with Prince Albert, who appeared dapper in a blue suit and contrasting face covering.

Rebel looked loved-up with her new beau, the Anheuser-Busch brewery heir, 29, in the photographs, with the couple having made their official debut at Prince Albert's Planetary Health Gala on Thursday.

Rebel appeared glamorous in a form-fitting, V-neck gown, highlighting her incredible three stone weight loss.

Holding a statement black clutch bag, the Pitch Perfect actress stood next to the prince while taking photographs at the private event - with neither wearing face masks at this point.

Masks are mandatory in Monaco when on public transport, in indoor public spaces, queues and some outdoor areas.

In early March, Prince Albert became the first head of state to test positive for COVID-19. He told PEOPLE at the time that he experienced mild flu-like symptoms. 

'I've a slight fever, not really that bad. A little bit of a cough. I'd a runny nose the first few days, that was the first sign. I've felt a little stuffed up but that's it,' he said. After he spent several weeks self-isolating in the palace, the royal returned to his family.

Meanwhile, Prince Albert looked sophisticated in a navy suit, teamed with a bright blue tie and white shirt for the occasion on Friday.

Rebel's boyfriend Jacob showed he was just as dapper in a black velvet tuxedo with a matching bow-tie.

Jacob's family founded the Anheuser-Busch brewery, which produces America's most popular beer, Budweiser. 

In 2016, Forbes listed the Busch family as the 16th richest in America, with a fortune of US$13.4billion.  

While it's unclear how much of that will be inherited by Jacob, his current personal net worth has been estimated at US$100million.

Rebel and Prince Albert also posed with Joan Punyet Miró, the grandson of the famous Spanish painter, as well as Swiss art gallerist Isabelle Bscher. 

Earlier in the week, Rebel and Jacob attended Prince Albert's Planetary Health Gala in the city, which the royal attended with his glamorous wife Princess Charlene. 

Looking effortlessly elegant, Charlene sported a floor-length silver gown to the occasion - which also included guests such as American actress Rebel Wilson and English film star Helen Mirren.

Hosted by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, the annual event gathers leading philanthropists, talents and scientists to join forces and launch the charity's initiatives to bridge the widening gap between health and the environment.

The night is usually auction filled with many collectables, memorabilia and fine art from some of the most high-profile artists across the globe going on sale.

Proceeds will be used to help the Foundation's initiatives, which includes the development of marine protected areas, protection of threatened marine species, the mitigation of the impact of climate change and acidification on the ocean, as well as the fight against plastic pollution.
