Mark Wright's father has asked for his son and daughter-in-law Michelle Keegan to make him a grandad after they shared broody snaps to Instagram.

Over the weekend, the former TOWIE star, 33, and Brassic actress, 33, went to visit her cousin Kate who recently welcomed a baby boy called Brody.

Sharing a collection of sweet snaps to Instagram, Mark's father, Mark Wright Sr, was quick to lead the comments as he demanded the couple gave him a grandchild.

'I must say, he took to uncle Mark like a duck takes to water !! Brody Allen welcome to the world little fella !! Another hammer  to join the clan !!' 

While Michelle, who also posted a sweet video cuddling Brody, penned: 'B R O D Y A L L E N … you're so loved.' 

In June, Michelle revealed her 'frustration' at people constantly questioning why she and husband Mark don't have children, insisting 'nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors'.

The actress, who has been married to the TOWIE star turned TV presenter for five years, hit out at sexist double standards - admitting queries about when she is going to have a baby do 'bother' her now.

In an interview with the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, she said: 'A few years ago it didn't bother me and I answered the question, but now I think, "I don't need to answer that because nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors". 

'I remember when I finished Our Girl people were like, "Is it because you're going off to have a baby?" 

'I know for a fact if Mark finished a job, nobody would ask him if he was going to have a baby. It's not fair. It does make me feel frustrated.'

Michelle previously told of her frustrations about the subject last year, telling  The Sun: 'It’s horrible. It’s like, "You’re 32. Are you not yet?" People don’t know if we’re trying. They don’t know the background of what’s happening. 

'It’s no one else’s business. In this day and age you shouldn’t ask questions like that.'

Michelle added that she has learned to brush off the question and said it is 'no one else's business.' 

Michelle and husband Mark have been together since late 2012 when they met while they were both on holiday in Dubai. 

The former TOWIE star popped the question nine months later and the pair married in a lavish ceremony at Hengrave Hall in Suffolk in May 2015.

The couple previously had to conduct a long distance relationship while Michelle worked in South Africa for extended periods for BBC drama Our Girl, and Mark had filming commitments on EXTRA in Los Angeles.
