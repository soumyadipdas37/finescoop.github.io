Michelle's outing comes after Mark has reportedly landed role fronting the pilot for a new show in the United States after winning over producers with his 'cheeky persona'.

The former TOWIE star returned to the UK last year after leaving his position at Extra, amid claims he struggled living apart from wife Michelle.

However it looks like the reality personality it set to have another crack at breaking America, and this time Michelle might be going with him. 

According to the Sun the pilot was filmed last month and Mark is already hoping that it could mark a return to America after previously living there for two years.

An insider revealed: 'He was chosen to front a new pilot by a TV ­network in the US who are keen to see if they can get him back on screen.

'Obviously the dream would be to become as big as his pal James Corden, who landed his own chat show out there on CBS.'

MailOnline contacted Mark's representatives for comment at the time.
