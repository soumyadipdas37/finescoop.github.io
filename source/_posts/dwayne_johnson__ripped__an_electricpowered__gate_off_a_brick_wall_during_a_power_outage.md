Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson impressively dismantled an electric-powered gate 'completely' by himself, after a power outage left him almost unable to get to work. 

To prevent keeping 'hundreds of production crew members waiting' on him, the wrestler-turned-actor 'pushed, pulled and ripped the gate' until it came off a brick wall on Friday.

'Not my finest hour, but a man’s gotta go to work,' the ripped movie star captioned an image of the disseminated gate. 'We experienced a power outage due to severe storms, causing my front gate not to open.'

While he attempted to override the hydraulic system to open the gates, which has previously worked, 'this time it wouldn’t.' 

After being told getting a gate technician would take approximately 45 minutes, The Rock sprung into action, so nobody would be waiting on him to start their day. 

'My security team was able to meet the gate technician and welders about an hour later — and they were apparently, “in disbelief and equally scared” as to how I ripped it off,' he told his 198 million Instagram followers.

He concluded his post by expressing his excitement to be portraying Black Adam, who is a antagonist in the DC Universe. 

Within two hours, the post garnered more than 1.4 million likes and 29,600 comments. 

'What's the old saying? Stuck between The Rock and his work place?' one of his followers joked in the comment section, as others pleaded for him to share the security footage.

Earlier this week, his producing partner, Hiram Garcia, revealed the actor has recovered from coronavirus.  

Garcia, who is the brother of The Rock's ex-wife Dany Garcia, added that the icon is already back at work on his next film, the Netflix project Red Notice.  

Johnson's wife Lauren Hashian, 36, and their two daughters, Jasmine, four, and Tiana, two, were also infected with COVID-19.

'He is a huge family man,' a source told People, while adding that he's also an intensely private person who is laser-focused on his family and his work.

The Fast & Furious franchise star announced the news that his family had contracted the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, September 2, in a nearly 12-minute Instagram video.

'Testing positive for COVID-19 is a lot different than recovering from nasty injuries, getting evicted or being broke, which I've been more than a few times,' he began.

'My No. 1 priority is to always protect my family and my loved ones... I wish it was only me that tested positive. It was my entire family and it was a kick in the gut. We in a family are good, we're on the other end of it and no longer contagious. Thank God, we're healthy.'

He added, 'We are counting our blessings right now. We are well aware you don’t always get to the other end of COVID-19 stronger and healthier.

'I have had some of my best friends lose their parents to this virus that is so incredibly relentless and unforgiving. We are counting our blessings, but we are good.'
