Cadbury has released a new Christmas edition gingerbread biscuit chocolate block in Australia.

The $3.50 Dairy Milk product was spotted on supermarket shelves by eagle-eyed customers, and now others are rushing to get their hands on a block.

But the gingerbread treat will only be in stores for a limited time and is available across leading supermarkets and selected independent retailers.

According to the product description, the chocolate is 'seasonally inspired with delicious gingerbread biscuit pieces'.

It's made from rich ingredients including full cream milk, ground cinnamon, cocoa butter and sugar.

But the 170g chocolate blocks are seemingly difficult to find online, as the product can't be found on the Woolworths website and is temporarily unavailable online at Coles.

Independent retailers also seem just as excited as customers, with many sharing the news on Facebook.

Ritchies Timboon in Victoria and Supa IGA Muswellbrook in New South Wales ensured their customers were informed about the new product release.

'To early for Christmas? I think not when it involves this delicious block of Cadbury Christmas Edition Gingerbread Biscuit Chocolate, YUM!' read one Facebook post caption by Ritchies Timboon.

Customers seemed eager and tagged friends and family members in the comments.
