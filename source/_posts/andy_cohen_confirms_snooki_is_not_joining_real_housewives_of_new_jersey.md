Andy Cohen put the kibosh on rumors that Jersey Shore legend Snooki has been cast on The Real Housewives Of New Jersey.

The 52-year-old producer called into Live With Kelly And Ryan for this Thursday's episode and said that 'first of all, we are already in production on next season of the show, so the answer is at no time soon would that happen.'

He explained that 'that's a rumor that's popped up a few times over the years and it's always something that I've kind of discounted.'

Nope: Andy Cohen put the kibosh on rumors that Jersey Shore legend Snooki has been cast on The Real Housewives Of New Jersey

The silver fox shared that 'I've thought: "You know what? It's two different shows. I don't see it." I know that some of the women actually know her though.'

Jersey Shore had its original run on MTV from 2009 to 2012, and a revival subtitled Family Vacation that began in 2018 is still running.

Meanwhile The Real Housewives Of New Jersey began on Bravo in 2009 and has been running there ever since, with season 11 now filming. 

Andy told Kelly: 'And I will say, watching your show this morning and hearing it come out of your mouth kind of legitimized it in a way that it hadn't been before for me.'

He shared: 'And it made me think: "You know what? Maybe this isn't the worst idea." I just Wikipedia'd her. She's 32 so she's in the age range.' 

The heartthrob theorized that a Snooki casting might be 'something to keep our eyes out for, maybe a season 11 or 12 conversation.'

Although The Real Housewives Of New Jersey had to pause filming in March because of the coronavirus lockdowns it resumed this summer as the guidelines relaxed.
