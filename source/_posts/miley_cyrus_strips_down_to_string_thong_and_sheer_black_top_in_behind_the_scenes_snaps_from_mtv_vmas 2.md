For the rest of her glamorous look, she went for a dark eyebrow, a black winged eyeliner and a contoured complexion. 

As well as looking towards the camera, Miley got silly throwing up two peace signs with her hands and sticking her tongue out.  

The posts come just after she performed her latest single Midnight Sky at the VMAs - held at various locations in New York City - while swinging on a giant disco ball, in scenes reminiscent of her 2013 song Wrecking Ball. 

She wore the same makeup, top, and jewelry as in her BTS pictures, though she added black strappy stilettos and thicker black bottoms.

Paying homage: Miley referenced her classic 2013 hit Wrecking Ball in her performance on Sunday

The pop star is known for making a big splash at the event, having previously caused an outcry when she performed in latex bra and pants alongside Robin Thicke back in 2013. 

This time around, the defiant singer appeared to throw a nod to her racy past as she went from performing the hit song on a stage, to getting on top of a mirror ball. 

Showing off her long legs while holding on to a chain, Miley belted out her tune as she put on a spirited performance.    

Shimmer: Miley flashed the flesh in a see-through ensemble at the event's red carpet 

The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event.

This year's show marks the first time the bash has been held at various different locations, with performances taking place in and around New York City, without packed audiences to abide by social distancing guidelines.

MTV explained its plans for the show to ‘[span] all five boroughs’ of New York, to ‘pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents.’
