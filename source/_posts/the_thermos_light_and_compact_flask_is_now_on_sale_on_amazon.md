Whether you want to keep your coffee warm on the way into the office or wanting something to warm you up on your autumn walks, a flask is a handy and eco-friendly companion.  

When it comes to insulted flasks, Thermos is the name to know. If traditional flasks feel too weighty or cumbersome, then you might be interested to learn of the Thermos Light and Compact series.

Combining a sleek, lightweight design with maximum heat performance technology, Amazon shoppers are noting it as a seriously worthwhile investment, particularly in the cooler months. 

What's more, you can now save up to 48 per cent off the Thermos Light and Compact Flask, 350 ml on Amazon. Now just £11.89 or £14.29 for the 500ml, it's a great saving and sure to save you even more on takeaway coffee cups. 

The Thermos Light and Compact Flask, 350 ml is now on sale for just £11.89- a saving of £11.10 

With over 1,000 reviews and an impressive average score of 4.7 out of 5, the Thermos Light and Compact Flask is a popular choice with Amazon shoppers. 

There are a myriad of ways to use a Thermos, but it really comes into its own in autumn and winter when you're looking to keep your hot drinks hot for longer. From commutes to winter walks, the office to the golf course, the Thermos Light and Compact Flask is a super handy and reusable companion. 

Super light, the 350ml flask weighs just 0.31kg so is a particular hit with outdoor enthusiasts and those constantly on the move. While the 350ml may not be the best for tea drinkers, the size has been a big hit with Amazon shoppers with a love of smaller, stronger coffee. 

'Before finding this thermos, I always had flasks that were just too big, meaning that I would have to often only fill them halfway and the heat would not be retained for as long as well as being a waste of space. This little flask is perfect in size.' 

If you need something a little bigger, however, then the flask also comes in a 500ml and 1-litre size, both currently on sale too. 

Like all Thermos products, the flask gives serious impressive results. Designed with the Thermos vacuum insulation technology for maximum temperature retention, it will keep your coffee, tea or whatever hot beverage you like hot for 12 hours and cold for 24 hours. 

The Thermos Light and Compact Flask keeps your drinks hot for 14 hours and cold for 24 hours while the exterior remains cool to touch 

'This is really well made, keeps coffee hot for several hours, and is easy to pour. It looks good, and fits in most bike bottle racks, although on some, you might need something to stop it rattling or jumping out. Recommended.'  

Another agreed, writing: 'Better than the competition. Having owned a number of similar-sized flasks I bought this one as I was sick of leaking flasks with lids that come apart. I have not been disappointed with this flask at all. It has a nice pour with no annoying run-on of liquid, and it easily keeps my coffee warm for over 12 hours.' 

The Thermos Light and Compact Flask has also been a big hit with parents who use the flask to make up formula when on the move.

'I bought this just for hot water to add to formula while on the go and it was PERFECT. Honestly the best purchase I made while trying to navigate feeding, bottles etc. It kept the water hot, lasted ages, poured well and is smaller than most thermos' as I only needed a few ounces for a day out, so good size for nappy bag.'

Or if you're heading back to the office and need of some lunch inspiration, why not fill the Thermos with soup?

'No leaks and piping hot for hours. Perfect. Very happy, no leaks and keeps my tin of soup hot for a good 10 hours'.
