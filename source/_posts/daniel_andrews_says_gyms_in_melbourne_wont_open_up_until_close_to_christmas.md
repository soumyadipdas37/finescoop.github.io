Daniel Andrews has ruled gyms won't reopen until December at the earliest as Victoria prepares a four-step plan out of lockdown.

The Victorian Premier outlined the strategy on Sunday for the state to return to normality if daily COVID-19 case numbers continue to fall.

Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said gyms will be among some of the last businesses to reopen.

'Gyms are a known high risk setting. They cause outbreaks,' he told a press conference on Sunday.

Gyms in Victoria were the last in the country to reopen on June 22 after closing in mid-March. They were then forced to shut again after just two-and-a-half weeks after Mr Andrews declared a six week lockdown

'They are still high risk inherently because of the exertion that people are undergoing at the gym and the fact that it is an indoor setting.

'But boot camps are different and obviously we want to encourage those outdoor activities on those principles that it is a much, much lower risk to do anything outdoors.'

Prof Sutton said gyms are high risk inherently of the 'exertion' that people undergo while they're exercising, which is coupled with being indoors.

Gyms and exercise studios in Victoria were the last in the country to reopen on June 22 after closing in mid-March during the first wave of coronavirus.  

They were then forced to shut again after just two-and-a-half weeks after Mr Andrews declared a six week lockdown.

Fitness Australia CEO Barrie Elvish last week slammed the Andrews Government for their refusal to budge on gym closures.

'For many people in our community, especially those managing a range of physical and mental health issues, going to the gym, completing regular sessions with a personal trainer or participating in a live virtual class are seen as an essential support service,' he told DMARGE. 

A Fitness Australia study claims there have been more than 6.26 million check-ins across 423 gyms in New South Wales since restrictions eased on the 13th June, and in that time there has been no cases of community transmission from a gym.

 'Health and fitness centres are low risk when it comes to COVID-19 and the industry is willing to do whatever it takes to provide a safe and hygienic envrionment for members and employees,' Mr Elvish said. 

'We are not part of the problem; we are actually part of the solution to getting more Australians more active more often and help prevent long-term lifestyle-related disease.'

Melbourne Storm and Collingwood sports psychologist Jacqui Louder said there is a 'direct correlation' between exercise and mental health'.

'It's the number one mechanism for managing anxiety and stress. I have significant concerns for the community's mental health with less exercise - including at gyms - because of our response to COVID-19,' she told The Herald Sun last week.
