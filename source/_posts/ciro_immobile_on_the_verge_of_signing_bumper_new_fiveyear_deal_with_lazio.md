Ciro Immobile is set to commit his future to Lazio, with the 30-year-old reportedly prepared to see out his professional career with the Italian side, according to reports in Italy.

The striker enjoyed a sensational 2019-20 campaign for the Biancocelesti, scoring 39 goals and providing eight assists from 44 outings, earning him the European Golden Shoe.

His goal return last season also saw him equal Gonzalo Higuain's Serie A goal record of 36 strikes, which the Argentine set while at Napoli in 2015-16.

Immobile's fine form has seen links to Liverpool and Barcelona emerge, but the Italian striker is reportedly in no mood to leave Simone Inzaghi's side, and instead is eager to commit his future to the club.

According to Sportitalia, via Football Italia, Immobile is on the verge of putting pen to paper on a five-year contract extension with an option of an additional year running until June 2026, meaning that he could feasibly see out his career in Rome. 

The Italian outlet reports that the new bumper contract would see Immobile rake in around £3million per season with Lazio, which has become a home for the star after spells with Juventus, Torino, Borussia Dortmund and Sevilla.

Immobile revealed earlier this month that he was approached by Newcastle's prospective new Saudi owners over a move to the Premier League club before their £300m takeover bid fell apart. 

'During the period in which there was talk of the possible purchase of Newcastle by the Sheikh's fund they called my agent, Alessandro Moggi,' Immobile told Italian publication Corriere Dello Sport. 

'I know they were also looking for an Italian coach, [Massimiliano] Allegri or [Luciano] Spalletti.'
