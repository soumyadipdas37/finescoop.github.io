A woman has shared an alarming video of herself passed out on the ground with her empty cup still in her hand just five minutes after her drink was spiked. 

Stephanie Tavares, 26, from Montreal, Canada, posted the footage in response to a new TikTok trend in which people are demonstrating how to prevent someone from slipping drugs into your drink using Kendrick Lamar's song 'Money Trees.'

In the video, Tavares recounted how two strangers bought her and her girlfriend drinks one night last year. Only Tavares drank hers, and she passed out shortly after.  

Scary: Stephanie Tavares, 26, from Montreal, Canada, shared a video of herself passing out on the ground just five minutes after her drink was spiked 

'This is me five minutes later,' she said of the footage, which shows her rolling around the pavement. 'Protect each other.' 

Tavares shared more details in the comments about what happened after the drank the spiked drink. Luckily, her girlfriend who had passed on the drink was able to keep her away from the two guys. 

'They followed us for a solid 15 minutes outside until our two other male friends joined us. It was a scary experience,' she wrote. 

I just wanted to show people WHY it's important to always guard your drink, because getting roofied happens in a split second.' 

The video has been viewed more than 2.1 million times, and thousands of people have commented on the footage. 

Awful: Tavares said two strangers bought her and her girlfriend drinks one night last year. Only she drank hers, and she passed out shortly after

Warning: 'This is me five minutes later,' she said of the footage, which shows her rolling around the pavement. 'Protect each other'

Tavares told BuzzFeed News that most of the responses have been supportive, but she was surprised by how many quick to blame her for what happened. 

She noted that if she were to refuse the drink or show that she was scared of the men, she would receive backlash for generalizing them.   

'But because I accepted a drink — that happened to be spiked — a bunch of people are telling me it’s my fault, that I should have known better, and to never accept a drink from a man,' she said.  

Tavares responded to the victim-blaming she received in a series of follow-up videos. In the first clip, she shared just some of the negative comments that were written on her post.  

'Should have known better,' one person wrote, while another asked: 'Why would you drink that?' 

Victim blaming: Tavares was surprised by how many people blamed her for what happened, and she hit back at the negative commenters in a series of follow-up videos

Lesson learned: In one video, she used grains of rice to show how easy it is for someone to spike your drink without you realizing it

Reality: After practicing for just five minutes, she was able to sneak five grains of rice into the glass next to her

'A lot of people think what you think and it's scary,' she said at the end. 

She also filmed another video herself using grains of rice to show how easy it is for someone to spike your drink without you realizing it.   

'It doesn't have to be a stranger. It doesn't have to be a drink someone bought you. It can be anyone, anytime, with any drink,' she stressed. 'Even if you are around friends and cover your own drink that you bought yourself.'

After practicing for just five minutes, she was able to sneak five grains of rice into the glass next to her. 

'Imagine how easy it is for people who do this all of the time,' she said. 'Stop blaming victims and start blaming the people who drug the drinks.'
