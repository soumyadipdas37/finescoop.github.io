Georgia Fowler wowed onlookers on the beach during a day at the beach in Byron Bay on Monday.

Eventually, she stood up and pulled on a chic full-length white shirt dress, before gathering her belongings and leaving the beach.

Georgia showed off her incredible body in a lime green bikini, with white trimming along the waistband and cups.

Her shoulder-length brunette hair was tied up, and she accessorised with a silver charm necklace.
