Two months after being fired from the hit Bravo reality series Vanderpump Rules, Stassi Schroeder has reunited with her former costars Katie Maloney and Lala Kent.  

After catching up with her pals at a small gathering in Los Angeles, the 32-year-old reality star showed off her burgeoning baby bump in a skin-tight dress on Friday. 

As her fiancé Beau Clark pulled up their car, the popular podcast host chatted away with Maloney, who wore a thigh-skimming pink snakeskin dress and sneakers.

Schroeder oozed sophistication in a pair of open-toed brown heels and a matching purse, which she kept slung over her shoulder.   

For the occasion, the soon-to-be mother sported a sleek ponytail glam makeup with dusky eye-shadow and a glossy pout. 

As they conversed, Maloney kept one hand on her hip and showed off her figure in a plunging frock, which she paired with a gold necklace.

Schroeder competed her all-white ensemble with a long linen jacket and could be seen beaming, as Clark opened the car door for her. 

Meanwhile, Kent strolled into the party in a beige and white trench coat and black sneakers. 

The blonde beauty recently announced she is expecting her first child with fiancé Randall Emmett.

Flawless: Lala Kent, who recently announced she is expecting her first child, strolled into the party in a beige and white trench coat and black sneakers

Her flawless long locks were blow-dried out with a voluminous curl, as she toted a black backpack, with a tropical pattern. 

Kent's outfit covered any sign of her bump, just four days after she shared a picture of their baby-to-be during an ultrasound appointment.

Randall, 49, proudly showed off their sonogram on his Instagram Story, where he cooed over their new addition. 

'There's the baby!' Lala Kent and her fiance Randall Emmett delighted fans once again with another baby update on Wednesday

'There's the baby!' Randall exclaimed as he zoomed into the sonogram, his voice full of joy.

'The baby!' the Vanderpump Rules star chimed in.

The Instagram update comes just days after Lala and her husband-to-be announced her pregnancy on their podcast, Give Them Lala... With Randall. 

Family planning: The couple have been open about their desire to have a family

Lala casually announced the news on the podcast, saying: 'Today is my 30 birthday and I can't think of any other way to celebrate than with you guys coming through your headphones and speakers. I had the best gift given to me, my body also helped out too… I am pregnant!' 

'Lala Kent, a soon-to-be mother!' Randall added.  

Lala and Randall have been open about their desire to have a family together, even revealing they had been attempting to conceive a child during quarantine.
