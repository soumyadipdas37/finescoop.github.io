In an emotional caption alongside the unedited snap she wrote: 'It's taken a long time for me to learn to love and accept myself. 

'I would have never been able to post a photo like this in the past but now that I can I really want to help others do the same. That's why I was so excited to be taking part in @superdrug podcast 'The Beauty of it all' with host @vicknhope talking about beauty dysmorphia.

'It's no secret that I've turned to drastic diets and even surgery in a quest for 'perfection'.

Candid: Holly has often spoken out about her battles with her body image and self-acceptance over the years 

'It's been a difficult journey but to be able to share my story and help others is so amazing.'  

She shared the post after discussing beauty dysmorphia on Superdrug's The Beauty if it All podcast with Vick Hope on Tuesday.

Speaking candidly about her body issues she said: 'I have hidden my legs as a secret for years after I saw my mum doing the same and it's really important for me to gain more confidence.

'I asked my surgeon to give me the biggest possible implants when I was 18. And I was only 18. I don't think surgery should even really be allowed until you're 25 as you're mental stability isn't where its supposed to be to make those huge decisions.

'The trolls had the biggest impact on me, being called fat and ugly for so many years, I thought if I am skinny and pretty then maybe the trolling will stop, so I went on this mission to be skinnier and prettier and I had these procedures done to be like what society would deem more beautiful.

'But then the trolling turned and it was ''she's too skinny she's had too much surgery.'' 

Heartfelt: Holly also discussed her battle with bulimia on the podcast on Tuesday. She is pictured showing off her body transformation in February this year 

She added that now she is older she has realised what matters more is about what's 'in your head and your heart' rather than what you look like. 

She went on to discuss her battle with bulimia, saying: 'I would lose weight and then gain it during filming for Geordie Shore when we eat takeaways and put it back on and I would make myself sick.

'It was just a way to cope, I would do it seven times a day at one point. My teeth went yellow and I had acid reflux.'

She added that she got better when she met her fiancé Jacob Blyth who 'loves every part of her' and when she began telling herself compliments.
