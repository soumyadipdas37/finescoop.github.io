A former Hells Angels bikie has been arrested in a dramtic police chase months after vowing he was going to get back on the straight and narrow.  

Ben 'Notorious' Geppert, 28, was arrested in Kingscliff on Wednesday for alleged offences relating to extortion, robbery and a serious assault at Broadbeach Waters.   

It's being alleged he led police from the Tweed/Byron Police District on a chase over fences, rooftops and through backyards before being caught. 

A picture from the arrest shows the former bikie sitting on a lawn without a shirt while one of the officers handcuffs him.

Geppert (pictured with former girlfriend Allaina Vader) was released on bail in January for a spate of alleged violent incidents before taking to social media to say he was putting that life behind him

The alleged pursuit started after cops approached Geppert when they saw him standing by a car in Harpullia Court.

He was taken into custody and charged with the outstanding arrest warrant before being refused bail. 

Geppert is already serving a three-year suspended prison sentence following a fight outside a KFC restaurant on the Gold Coast.

He was released on bail in January for a spate of alleged violent incidents before taking to social media to say he was putting that life behind him.

'I can pretty much say 2020 will be the year for the BG! How much money have you lost chasing p****? How much p**** you lost chasing money? Think about it', he wrote. 

The former bikie moved to Airlie Beach following the stabbing death of his 17-year-old brother Harrison during a brawl in September, 2019. 

At the time of his brother's death, Geppert said he was 'crushed' and 'if I could give my life for you to have yours back I would do so without thinking twice'.

He is due to appear before the Tweed Heads Local Court on Thursday where it's expected Queensland Police will file an application for his extradition.
