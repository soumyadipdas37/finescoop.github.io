A husband shot a love rival who was having a secret affair with his wife and then used his farm forklift to carry his body to a bonfire, a court heard today.  

Builder Andrew Jones, 52, is accused of killing father-of-three Mike O'Leary, 55, with one of his eight guns before 'destroying' his body in a series of fires.

Jones, who ran building and farming companies, is alleged to have murdered Mr O'Leary over his affair with his wife Rhianon, 51.

He is accused of dumping Mr O'Leary's car by a river to stage his disappearance as suicide, before making his getaway on bicycle.

Builder Andrew Jones, 52, is accused of killing father-of-three Mike O'Leary (pictured with his wife Sian), 55, with one of his eight guns before 'destroying' his body in a series of fires 

The jury was told Jones shot Mr O'Leary at his secluded farm and used a forklift truck to lift his body into the boot of his Audi A6 before driving it to his home where he burned it.

Mr O'Leary's body was never discovered but burned remains were found at the bottom of a rusty oil barrel on Jones's farm, a jury was told. 

Police also found jeans and trainers at Jones's house which had traces of Mr O'Leary's blood. 

Jones and his love rival Mr O'Leary had known each other 20 years before the affair started in the farming village of Nantgaredig, Carmarthenshire. 

Prosecutor William Hughes QC said: 'Mike O'Leary was lured to this location expecting a private meeting with Rhianon Jones. Instead he was met by this defendant who was armed with a powerful rifle which he used to deliberately shoot him dead.

The jury was warned texts between Mr O'Leary and mother-of-three Mrs Jones (pictured) contained 'intimate and graphic' messages

'Steps were subsequently taken to hide and cover up his crimes - not in panic but a clear and calculated approach.'

He added: 'This was a carefully planned and well thought-out murder - far from an accident.

'He had murder very much in mind. This is no tragic accident'.

The court heard a search of Jones's home found he had a collection of eight guns - including a .22 Colt rifle allegedly used to shoot Mr O'Leary. 

Mr Hughes said: 'Eight firearms were seized from the premises, one of these was a .22 colt rifle.'

He said a search of the farm then found bullets and shell casings as well as blood-stained gravel and traces of blood on the blades of a fork lift truck.

Mr Hughes said: 'Mike was shot and killed with the rifle in the areas of where the traces of blood were found in the gravel and the fork lift was used to move his body.

'Mike's body was then transferred from Cyncoed Farm to Bronwydd Road in the Audi.'

Swansea Crown Court heard how Jones 'lured' Mr O'Leary to the farm near Nantgaredig, Carmarthenshire, by using a 'secret' phone belonging to his wife. 

Jones told police he met Mr O'Leary at the farm to confront him over the affair - but insisted the father of three left unharmed.

Mr O'Leary's wife Sian, pictured arriving at court on Monday, allegedly received a text from her husband saying: 'I'm so sorry X'

William Hughes said: 'Andrew Jones said that while his wife was ill he had found her secret phone and messaged Mike O'Leary to meet.

'He said they got out of their cars and had strong words. Both men were upset. 

'He said he last saw Mike when he left the farm in his vehicle. That account about him leaving the farm alive is a lie.' 

Prosecutor Mr Hughes said that Jones claimed he 'wanted to threaten Mike and took with him a rifle with the intention of frightening Mike O'Leary.'

 Jones and his daughter Carrie were monitoring Mrs Jones's (pictured) movements and phone calls after discovering she was cheating in September 2019, the court heard

Mr Hughes said Jones told him that 'he did not envision harm coming to himself or Mike.

'He fired two or three shots into the ground with the intention of frightening him.'

Mr Hughes said Jones claimed there was a 'scuffle' between the two men which led to Mr O'Leary (pictured) being shot in the head

Mr Hughes said Jones claimed there was a 'scuffle' between the two men which led to Mr O'Leary being shot in the head.

Jones claimed: 'The bullet went through his chin.'

Mr Hughes said: 'He says he does not know who caused the firearm to discharge. If he did cause it, he said, he did so accidentally.

'Mike died instantly and the defendant panicked.'

The court heard Jones admitted moving the body and the car and sending the text messages to Mr O'Leary's family. 

He added that Jones then took Mr O'Leary's body back to his home where he burned it 'over several days' in a series of 'intense' fires in his building yard.

The court previously heard Jones killed Mr O'Leary after discovering he was having an affair with his wife.

Mr Hughes said: 'There was an affair between Michael O'Leary and Rhianon Jones. They attended the same gym and at some stage during 2019 they began an extra marital relationship.'

The prosecution said Mr O'Leary (pictured) was lured to Jones's Cyncoed Farm, near Carmarthen, where the father-of-three expected to see his lover

'Andrew Jones became aware of the affair in 2019 having read some messages on his wife's iPad.

Mr Hughes said the messages between Mr O'Leary and Mrs Jones were 'intimate and graphic in content'.

Jones, of Bronwydd, Carmarthen, denies murder saying Mr O'Leary died in an accident.

The trial at Swansea Crown Court continues.
