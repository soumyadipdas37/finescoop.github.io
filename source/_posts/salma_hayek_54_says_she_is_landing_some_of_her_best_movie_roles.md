Salma Hayek feels 'invigorated' by the way directors are approaching her in her 50s.

The 54-year-old movie star started her career trying to get the attention of filmmakers and convince them to cast her in their movies, but after 32 years in the industry, she is delighted they are finally approaching her for roles.

 'It really invigorated me that they are finding me. I always found them. But they didn't want me. And that now they're coming to me, that's what's been really invigorating,' the beauty told OK! magazine.

Better now: Salma Hayek feels 'invigorated' by the way directors are approaching her in her 50s. The 54-year-old movie star started her career trying to get the attention of filmmakers and convince them to cast her in their movies, but after 32 years in the industry, she is delighted they are finally approaching her for roles

'It's difficult to make sense of it, you know? But that's what's been really strange. And you know what? Strange things happen to strange people.'

Hayek rose to fame in the Mexican telenovela Teresa before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a big screen career.

However, when the Hollywood actress first started out in 1988 she had no idea how things would end up.

She believes any struggles over the years have given her the possibility to choose the right path, having dubbed her life 'completely unimaginable'.

The cover girl explained: 'The things that have happened in my life are completely unimaginable. Even in my greatest ideas of my most extraordinary destiny, I never imagined how I feel right now.

Looking caliente! Hayek shared a new swimsuit photo to Instagram on Tuesday as she said the image was not a flashback. And the wife of billionaire François-Henri Pinault added that the next day she would be turning 54-years-old

'At some point in your life you just settle for doing the right thing and the best you can, instead of think about what you want and what you can didn't get get or what you're not getting or how someone's getting it and you're not getting it.

'It gives you the possibility to take roads that you never wanted to take, and you have the adventurous spirit to go and discover instead of planning so much. You may end up on roads that are much better than in your imagination.'

The wife of billionaire François-Henri Pinault has proved with several bikini shots this year that she looks as good as ever.

She is looking ahead: Over the weekend, the star shared this close-up photo on Instagra,

Last week the siren had on a halter black swimsuit with a wrap around her waist as she added sunglasses and a hat.

'Guess who's turning 54 tomorrow? By the way, this is not a Throwback Thursday! Thank you Marjo for turning into a photographer during the vacation!' said the Wild West actress in her caption as she noted she is a Virgo.

Her longtime friend Penelope Cruz hit 'like.'

Last month the Like A Boss star was seen in a skimpy two piece in black as she sipped coffee al fresco by a tiled wall in Greece.    

Salma styled her brunette locks into a sweptback relaxed bun and went makeup-free as she displayed her radiant complexion.

The actress, who wore a pair of black sunglasses, playfully posed with a cup of coffee for the snap. 

It comes after Salma posted a loved-up snap with her husband François-Henri, 58, to Instagram.

In the photo, the couple shared a cheeky kiss while both fully masked up amid the Covid-19 crisis.    

'Love in the time of corona El amor en los tiempos de corona. #love,' the 53-year-old star wrote alongside the picture of herself and her husband. 

Salma and her French businessman husband have been married since 2009, after tying the knot in a lavish Paris ceremony on Valentine's Day. Their nuptials are said to have cost an eye-watering $3.5 million.

Their big day took place in the famous Venice opera house Teatro La Fenice, and the lovers were joined by an A-List group of well wishers, including Penelope Cruz, Woody Harrelson and Bono.  

Last year, it was reported that François-Henri is worth an estimated $33.2billion. (He is the chairman and CEO of Kering since 2005, and president of Groupe Artémis since 2003.)

The Oscar-nominated actress remains tight-lipped about their relationship, but last year she did address trolls who apparently criticized the union.

'A lot of people are very shocked that I married who I married,' she said in an interview with Town & Country. 

'And some people are even intimidated now by me. But it's another way of showing racism. They can't believe this Mexican ended up in the life that she has, and they're uncomfortable around me.'

Salma added: '[Pinault] is the best husband in the world. I get to be who I am with him, and I don't feel that somebody tries to limit me.'
