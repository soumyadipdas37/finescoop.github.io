Kaitlyn Bristowe confessed she experienced a 'weak moment' after reading trolling comments about her physical appearance on Saturday.

The 35-year-old reality star, who is set to appear on season 29 of DWTS next month, shared a heart-breaking snap of herself in tears with her nearly two million followers.

'I forgot how mean people are when you go on TV,' Bristowe wrote on her Instagram Story. 'Just so many, 'She looks so old and plastic comments' everywhere. You win today trolls. It got to me.'

In an additional video, she added: 'I had a good cry, didn't somehow ruin my eyeliner,' she said.

'I honestly am so tired that anything will set me off right now, plus I am PMSing so great combo,' she continued. 

Additionally Bristowe explained she wanted to be 'honest on' her social media about feeling down, rather than just showcasing her typical 'woo, happy' persona.

'I had a weak moment, cried it out, felt it all, now poured myself a glass of wine, and remember what's important in life,' she concluded.  

To her fans' delight on Sunday, the reality star shared she was already feeling 'much better' with the support of her boyfriend Jason Tartick and pals.  

'My friends made me a board with nice messages on it and I sat and read them all, reminded myself of who's opinions matter, and I'm back,' she captioned a follow-up picture of herself smiling.

Last month, Bristowe unveiled the results of her intense fitness progress over a two-week period, ahead of her debut on ABC's long-running dance competition series. 

'I've been working so hard on my mental and physical health over the last 14 weeks,' she captioned three side-by-side images of herself throughout the process of committing herself to a combination of 'meditating, resting, working out, lifting heavy, Pilates and boxing.'

She joked: 'All I keep saying is 'please don't get sent home night one after all this work.'

In addition to physical therapy for mobility and strength and getting sports massages, she says her body at '35 feels strong and ready to dance.'

Kaitlyn grew up in Alberta, Canada as the daughter of a ballerina and moved as an adult to Vancouver, British Columbia for a dance scholarship and also became a spin-class instructor.

She was a contestant on season 19 of The Bachelor and was the star of season 11 of The Bachelorette. Jason competed on season 14 of The Bachelorette starring Becca Kufrin, 30.
