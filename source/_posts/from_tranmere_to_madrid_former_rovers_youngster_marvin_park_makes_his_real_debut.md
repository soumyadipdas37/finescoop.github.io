It may have been an underwhelming season opener for Real Madrid, but Los Blancos' goalless draw with Real Sociedad won't be forgotten in a long time for Marvin Park, as the youngster made his Madrid debut.

The 20-year-old academy product came off the bench to replace Rodrygo with 20 minutes remaining as Zinedine Zidane's side looked to break the deadlock at the Reale Seguros Stadium.

Park's senior appearance caps a remarkable journey in which the Spanish youngster came through the ranks of a number of clubs before finding a home at Real Madrid, including Tranmere Rovers.

The 20-year-old Spaniard was introduced by Zinedine Zidane with 20 minutes remaining

The midfielder joined Rovers' youth academy as a nine year old in 2009, and spent three years in the North West before returning to Spain and playing for Ciutat de Palma. 

He then went onto develop at La Salle and Jonquet Penya Arrabal before Madrid snapped up the youngster in 2016, and Park has flourished at Los Blancos ever since.

Park, who has represented Spain at U19 level, was born in Spain to a Nigerian father and South Korean mother, and barring his stint in England with Tranmere, has spent his life in Spain. 

The 20-year-old was unable to make the difference for Zidane's side, though, with Madrid's title defence getting off to a steady start with a point at Sociedad. 

Los Blancos had a mixed 2019-20 campaign, winning LaLiga ahead of arch rivals Barcelona, but they crashed out of the Champions League to Manchester City in the Round of 16.
