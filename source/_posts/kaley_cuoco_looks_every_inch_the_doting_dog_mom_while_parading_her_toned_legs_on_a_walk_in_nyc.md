Kaley Cuoco adopted her latest furry addition after a short-lived attempt to foster a senior chihuahua in March, amid the coronavirus lockdown. 

And on Sunday, the 34-year-old Big Bang Theory star enjoyed some quality time with her Instagram famous pooch, named Dumpy, who has nearly 50,000 Instagram followers. 

The actress, who shares six other pups with her husband Karl Cook, could be seen donning an oversized pink pajama dress shirt, which displayed her toned legs.

She returned to the Big Apple last month to resume production on her HBO Max series, The Flight Attendant, which had stopped filming due to the pandemic.

Cuoco - who is both star and executive producer of the show - recently revealed on social media that it had been a full calendar year since they first started shooting and she was excited to pick up production again, revealing that they had been taking all necessary protocols to start up safely.

She said everyone would be getting tested every few days, in addition to having to wear masks and keeping social distance.

The show is based on a novel by New York Times best-selling author, Chris Bohjalian and it centers around a flight attendant that wakes up in the wrong hotel with a dead man, and has no idea what happened. After discovering the book three years ago Kaley decided she wanted to turn it into a show.

Her sister Briana, who was on Season five of The Voice, will have a recurring role on her sister's show. 

While in NYC, Kaley's husband of two years, 29, has been back at their home in Los Angeles. The couple met randomly at a horse show in 2016 and have been together ever since.
