Out and about: Damian cut a casual figure in a relaxed black fleece as he carried his suitcases out of the car

Damian's latest posts come after details of his late father Steve Bing's will emerged, among them the claim that he had disinherited his two children, Damian and Kira Kerkorian, due to it being drawn up before their births.

The multi-millionaire committed suicide aged 55 in June, jumping from his 27th floor apartment in Los Angeles.

Steve, who received a $600million inheritance from his grandfather when he turned 18, had his will drawn up in 2001 - before he knew Kira had been born and while Elizabeth was pregnant.

Kira, 21, his daughter with former tennis star Lisa Bonder, is said to be fighting for control of his estate that was valued at just $337,000, according to documents obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com.

Although Bing notes Elizabeth was expecting a child, he declares in his will: 'Whether or not such child is mine, it is my intention not to provide in this Will for such child (or any other child as to which I may be the father) in this Will or for the offspring of any such child or children, whether now living or hereafter born.'

Bing later formed relationships with both Damian and Kira, even fighting for them to be included in their grandfather's trust last year.

Prior to his death, Bing had an estimated net worth of $590 million, according to various reports. While his estate was valued at $337,000 - his properties were not included in that evaluation.

Last year, Steve's father Peter Bing had tried to block Kira and Damian from being beneficiaries of his trust, claiming they were love children and should be excluded.

Steve jumped into the legal battle for his children and successfully fought the case, ensuring Damian and Kira would be beneficiaries.
