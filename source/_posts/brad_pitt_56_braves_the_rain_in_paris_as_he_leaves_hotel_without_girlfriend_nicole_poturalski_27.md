Brad Pitt braved the Paris rain on Sunday, snapped heading to a waiting car.

The Hollywood megastar, 56, cut a solo figure as he crossed the street without his new girlfriend - 27-year-old model Nicole Poturalski.

Brad carried a large taupe holdall as he strolled along in petrol slacks, a blue shirt, white trainers and a salmon hat.

He wore a face mask, as per the COVID-19 precautionary measures that are in place in France, and was seen ducking into the waiting vehicle and heading off.

This comes after it was revealed Nicole is married and that her husband is reportedly 'not interested' in being 'jealous' about her extra-marital dalliance with the hunky actor. 

Roland Mary, a 68-year-old restaurateur, has been married to Nicole for eight years and it has now been claimed that they have an 'open marriage'.

As well as this, Nicole is said to have met Pitt at her husband's restaurant, the upmarket Borchardt in Berlin.

Mr Mary – apparently no stranger to romantic trials and tribulations after reputedly being married four times – has remained tight-lipped about his marital arrangements, and his wife's friendship with Pitt.

However, a friend reportedly said: 'Roland is a very philosophical guy. He has been married several times and has five children. He is not interested in negativity or jealousy.

'They are still married, but you could describe their relationship as an open marriage.'

Nicole was photographed with Brad on Wednesday arriving at Le Castellet airport near Marseille in the South of France on his private jet.

They then headed for Chateau Miraval, the £50 million wine estate where he married his second wife Angelina Jolie, and which the couple still own jointly.

On Thursday, Polish-born Miss Poturalski, who is known professionally as Nico Mary, posted an enigmatic picture of two badminton rackets floating on a swimming pool on Instagram along with emojis of a whale and an ice cube. 

The symbols are said to represent 'cheerfulness and happiness' and that 'everything is cool' respectively.

Indeed, visitors to her various social media accounts, featuring many pictures of her modelling bikinis and skimpy sportswear, have been given hints about a mystery man since March.

Last November – three months after apparently meeting Pitt at her husband's restaurant – she detailed a six-week trip to Los Angeles, including visits to Malibu, Santa Monica and Venice beaches.

The trip culminated with her watching a concert by rapper Kanye West at the Hollywood Bowl with Pitt, it eventually emerged last week. 

If the relationship is confirmed – and Pitt's representatives have declined to comment – Miss Poturalski would be the star's first serious partner since he split acrimoniously from Ms Jolie in 2015.

The couple, who have six children together, were legally divorced in April last year, and Pitt has described how the collapse of the marriage took a heavy toll on him.

On Saturday, a friend told The Mail on Sunday: 'Brad found his split from Angelina very difficult. It broke him, so finding a new girlfriend was the last thing on his mind. His children and his sobriety were his priorities. 

'Any new relationships at the beginning of getting sober are a no-go for a year so he avoided women. But Nicole came along at just the right time, when he was ready.'

Pitt, who was married to Jennifer Aniston until he fell for Ms Jolie on the set of the film Mr And Mrs Smith, first visited the Borchardt restaurant in 2009 when he was filming Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds in the German capital.

He returned to the restaurant – which is described as 'having a feel of money and glamour' and has previously served Barack Obama, George Clooney and Natalie Portman – last year when he was promoting Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, another Tarantino hit.

According to unconfirmed rumours, Ms Poturalski gave him her phone number during the visit. Other reports claim, however, that they were introduced through mutual friends.

Last weekend, a source told the American TV channel Entertainment Tonight: 'When they first started seeing each other, they told no one about it.

'Even some of their inner circle of friends are only finding out now. Brad has been very private about dating and now more than ever he doesn't want to rock the boat with Angelina.'

Described by friends as 'smart', Warsaw-born Miss Poturalski speaks five languages and has a seven-year-old son with Mr Mary.

She also owns a small farm outside Berlin where she raises sheep and is signed to A Management, a modelling agency in Germany, and Next Management in the US, which also represents singer Billie Eilish and British model Alexa Chung.

Like Ms Jolie, she is unafraid to stand up for what she believes. In May, for example, she wore a red top from campaign group CHNGE that bore the slogan: 'Protect Kids, Not Guns'.

On Instagram, she shares ways to end child sex trafficking under the heading: 'Save the kids'.
