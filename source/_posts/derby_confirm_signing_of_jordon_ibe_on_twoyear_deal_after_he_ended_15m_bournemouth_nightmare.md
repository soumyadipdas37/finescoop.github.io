Derby County have confirmed the signing of free agent Jordon Ibe on a two-year deal.

The former Liverpool youngster underwent a medical at the Pride Park club on Monday after being released by Bournemouth at the end of last season.

Ibe - who impressed during a 24-game loan spell over five months at Derby in the 2014/15 season - had a difficult four seasons on and off the pitch for the Cherries following a £15m move, scoring just three Premier League goals.

But having failed to score for Bournemouth last season, he has now become the latest addition to Phillip Cocu's squad at the Championship club.

'Jordon is a player with a lot of potential and undoubted ability,' Cocu said on the signing.

'He has performed for several years in the Premier League and at 24 years of age he still has many years ahead of him in his career.

'We have been keen to strengthen our attacking options out wide for some time, while we believe Derby County is the right place for Jordon at this stage of his career.'

Ibe scored five goals for the Championship side over a five-month period at Pride Park.

Derby however appeared to suggest he is unlikely to go straight into the squad for the home game against Blackburn Rovers on Saturday and make a second debut for them.

The club said Ibe will now work with their strength and conditioning staff to build up his sharpness and match fitness, having not made a competitive first-team appearance since September 2019.

The move however will see the 24-year-old put his nightmare spell on the south coast behind him, but the end of October sees Derby travel to the south coast to face Bournemouth, where Ibe could come up against his former club.

Ibe spoke about the difficulties of his time at the club in a recent podcast interview, admitting he was affected by online abuse and failed to make things work with manager Eddie Howe.

He also spent time in rehab for his mental health after crashing his £130,000 Bentley supercar into a cafe.

He was charged with driving without due care and attention and failing to stop at the scene of an accident last November.
