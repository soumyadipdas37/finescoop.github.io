Lily's daughters looked adorable in their matching pink floral dresses that featured a tulle skirt and perfectly complemented their masks. 

The Smile singer looked sensational herself as she posed for an array of mirror selfies in her veil and dress, which she covered with a leopard print coat.

Her raven tresses were pulled back into a chic bun and her fringe framed her face well, while she wore a light palette of make-up for the occasion.

Clearly enjoying posing in the ensemble, Lily wrote that she'd found the photos 'from the wedding night' and wanted to share them on social media.

David went onto share a pair of snaps from their nuptials, including one mere moments after the union outside the chapel. 

Referencing their laid-back nuptials, David penned the caption: 'In a wedding officiated by the king himself, the people’s princess wed her devoted, low born, but kind credit card holder in a beautiful ceremony lit by the ashen skies courtesy of a burning state miles away in the midst of a global pandemic.

'Refreshments were served at a small reception following.'
