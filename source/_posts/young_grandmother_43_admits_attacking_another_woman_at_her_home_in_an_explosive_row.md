A 43-year-old woman burst into a house and assaulted the occupant in an explosive row over her granddaughter. 

Lisa Marie Wesley marched into the Queensland home and grabbed a woman by the arm after the argument erupted on January 30, resulting in bruises and lacerations. 

Ms Wesley plead guilty to one count of assault occasioning bodily harm on Friday at Caboolture Magistrate's Court, according to the Caboolture Shire Herald.

'You have to be careful ... because these things can escalate from nought to 100,' Magistrate Andrew Hackett warned the woman. 

He also noted the incident was one that 'speaks of high emotion'. 

She did not have a conviction recorded but was fined $500 after the guilty plea. 

'Had you had prior convictions for violence, I would have recorded a conviction,' Magistrate Hackett said.
