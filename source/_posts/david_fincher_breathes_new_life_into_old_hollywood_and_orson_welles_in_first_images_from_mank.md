David Fincher last graced the big screen with his critically-acclaimed 2014 feature adaptation of Gone Girl.

And the Golden Globe winner is preparing to unleash his next title on the world via Netflix.

He breathes new life into old Hollywood with his upcoming film Mank, of which the streaming service released the first black-and-white images Saturday, the 79th anniversary of the Citizen Kane premiere.

Mank features Gary Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, while he races to finish the (eventually Oscar-winning) screenplay.

Oldman stars opposite Tom Burke, who plays Orson Welles, director and star of the 1941 cinematic masterpiece.

The cast also includes Amanda Seyfried as actress Marion Davies and Mankiewicz's secretary Rita Alexander.

Mankiewicz ultimately delivered Welles a 300-page script entitled American, on which they worked together to shave down to 156 pages.

Although the question of who wrote the film has been widely debated, Mankiewicz and Welles ultimately shared the credit, as well as the film's sole Oscar for best original screenplay (it received nine nominations total). 

Netflix's description of Mank reads: '1930s Hollywood is re-evaluated through the eyes of scathing social critic and alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he races to finish the screenplay of Citizen Kane for Orson Welles.' 

Fincher shot the film on location at Kemper Campbell Ranch in Victorville, California, where Mankiewicz labored over the screenplay for two months.

That's a wrap: Production on Mank began last November and wrapped in February of this year, before Hollywood went into lockdown over the COVID-19 pandemic

Although the screenwriter was known for hitting the bottle, the ranch's strict no-alcohol policy forced him to focus on the script.

Fincher is most known for directing such films as Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
