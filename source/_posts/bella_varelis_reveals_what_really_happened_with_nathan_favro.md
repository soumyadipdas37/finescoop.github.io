The Bachelor's Bella Varelis has responded to rumours she's dating Bachelorette star Nathan Favro.

The couple sent fans wild after paparazzi pictures emerged of Nathan leaving the 25-year-old marketing consultant's apartment over the weekend.

Clearing up the rumours, Bella told The Kyle And Jackie O Show on Thursday that the pair are nothing more than friends.

Kyle asked Bella: 'By looking at Daily Mail the other day, your person has come in the form of Nathan from Bachelor in Paradise, you had a little sleep over didn't you?' 

'Nathan and I are just good mates,' she explained. 

Bella went on to say she had asked Nathan to come over with his puppy but he had a few too many glasses of wine and slept on the couch.

She added: 'Haven't you ever had someone come over and have too many wines and crash on the couch?'

'I had asked him if he could bring his puppy over because I'm in love with the puppy,' she said.

On Thursday, Daily Mail Australia obtained photos of former Bachelorette star Nathan leaving marketing consultant Bella's home over the weekend. 

One of Bella's neighbours in Sydney spotted Nathan's Toyota HiLux parked outside her home at about 8pm on Saturday night.

The vehicle was just across the street from Bella's Mini.

The following morning, at about 9:45am, a nervous-looking Nathan, 25, was pictured leaving the apartment and driving away.

Bella was spotted leaving her home an hour later with her flatmate Bec Cvilikas, who was eliminated from The Bachelor on Wednesday's episode.

Fans of The Bachelor franchise will remember Nathan from Ali Oetjen's season of The Bachelorette in 2018.

He was infamously kicked off the show after Ali accused him of spreading rumours in the mansion about her sexual history.

Meanwhile, Bella was left heartbroken after she was dumped by Locky Gilbert during Thursday night's finale of The Bachelor.
