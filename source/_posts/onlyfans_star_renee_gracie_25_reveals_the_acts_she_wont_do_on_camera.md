In just a few short months, former V8 Supercars driver-turned-Only Fans star Renee Gracie has become one of Australia's most successful adult entertainers.

And now the 25-year-old has spoken about her controversial career change, telling Daily Mail Australia there are some things she won't do in the sex industry.

The bombshell revealed on Thursday that she refuses to do any off-camera work, saying she isn't an escort for hire.

EXCLUSIVE: V8 Supercars driver turned OnlyFans 'creator' Renee Gracie, 25, has revealed what she WON'T do on camera - after becoming one of Australia's most successful adult stars 

'I get a lot of people asking me to meet up and do escort services and topless waitressing, which I won't do,' she said.

Renee added that she considers her sex work to be online only.

'The thing about OnlyFans is that it's all online. I don't have to touch anyone. I would have never done this if I potentially had to be a topless waitress,' she explained.

When it comes to filming pornographic scenes, Renee also has another strict rule: she won't work with anyone besides her boyfriend.

'I would never involve anyone else,' she said. 'I am in a happy relationship.'

She continued: 'I'm lucky enough that my partner gets involved in my stuff and we can have fun doing it together.'

Despite being an internet superstar, Renee isn't too 'comfortable' in crowds and so could never be a stripper or nude waitress.

'Taking photos and being behind a screen is completely different,' she said, adding that OnlyFans means she is completely safe and in control. 

Despite only having an OnlyFans account for less than a year, Renee has already earned more than a million dollars.

She will soon host a Content Day event, where she'll teach fans how to make money from selling their raunchy photos online.

Her course will include lessons on copyright law and making sure that your content isn't distributed by third parties without permission.

'There are laws about leaked pornography,' Renee said. 'If somebody posts a sexual photo of you, naked or not, it is illegal in most countries. 

'I am now confident enough to give advice to girls about stuff I have unfortunately been though. There are things that are so important to know.'
