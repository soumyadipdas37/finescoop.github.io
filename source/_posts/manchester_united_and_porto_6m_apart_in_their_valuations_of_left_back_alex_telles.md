Manchester United and Porto's valuations of defender Alex Telles differ by £6million, according to reports.

Sportsmail understands the Brazilian left-back is expected to be the next new player through the door at Old Trafford ahead of Monday's deadline.

But The Telegraph are reporting that the two clubs have yet to agree a fee, with the Portuguese side demanding £18m for the 27-year-old's signature.

However, the report adds that figure is substantially more than United are willing to pay for a player who can talk to foreign suitors come January and the next transfer window.

The same outlet claims United value Telles at about £12m and are hoping Telles' determination to move to the club will encourage United's Portuguese counterparts to lower the fee they are currently holding out for.

However, for the moment it appears that negotiations are not proving straightforward in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's bid to strengthen his defence ahead of the transfer window slamming shut on October 5.

The same can be said for United's pursuit of Jadon Sancho, with the Premier League side denying reports that they have made a £91.2m offer for the Borussia Dortmund star – £73m plus £18.2m in add-ons – which has been rejected.

Sancho remains United's No 1 target but Sportsmail understands they have been worried about losing face and the backlash from fans if a formal bid is turned down.

They are believed to have held discussions with intermediaries on Tuesday and are still refusing to meet Dortmund's demand for £108m.

United must now decide whether to pursue their interest with less than a week left of the window or call a halt to the long-running saga and look at other options.

Should they opt for the latter, Sportsmail understands United could move for Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele, with club sources confirming the 23-year-old Frenchman has been discussed, although any move is likely to be on loan.
