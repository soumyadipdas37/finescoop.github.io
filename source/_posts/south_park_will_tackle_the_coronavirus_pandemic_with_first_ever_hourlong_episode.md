South Park will be diving headfirst into the turmoils of the coronavirus pandemic with an hour-long special on September 30. 

Comedy Central confirmed the impending episode - aptly titled The Pandemic Special - on Tuesday and treated fans to a 50-second teaser trailer.

The Pandemic Special will be the adult animated series' first ever hour-long episode in its 23-year history on the network.

The episode will be made available to stream on HBO Max 24-hours after its Comedy Central premiere on Wednesday, September 30 at 8PM.

In the trailer, the series' beloved characters can been seen wearing face masks and occupying school desks that are shielded by sheets of plastic.

Randy Marsh, father to one of South Park's main characters named Stan Marsh, commences the trailer by boisterously announcing 'a Pandemic Special.'

He can be seen standing before a large projection screen that is riddled with morbid medical imagery as he seemingly attempts to cash-in on the public's fear.

The special will also focus on main character Eric Cartman as he grapples with the horrors of returning to South Park Elementary amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Comedy Central released a more vague episode synopsis that reads: 'Randy comes to terms with his role in the COVID-19 outbreak as the on-going pandemic presents continued challenges to the citizens of South Park. 

'The kids happily head back to school but nothing resembles the normal that they once knew; not their teachers, not their homeroom, not even Eric Cartman,' the synopsis concluded.

Though the Pandemic Special will be the series' first ever hour-long episode, South Park has ventured beyond the confines of the typical half-hour comedy structure before.

In 2007, series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker aired an epic three-part episode titled Imaginationland, according to EW.

Although fans are beyond excited for new South Park content, Comedy Central has yet to unveil the official premiere date for season 24 of the beloved cartoon.

But with Stone and Parker seemingly back at work and whipping up content again amid the pandemic, season 24 is undoubtedly underway.

South Park, which first premiered on Comedy Central in 1997, was created by Stone and Parker following the success of a project titled The Spirit Of Christmas that became one of the internet's first-ever viral videos.

The show, infamously known for its vulgarity, follows four elementary-age boys, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick, and the outlandish events that take place in their hometown of South Park, Colorado.
