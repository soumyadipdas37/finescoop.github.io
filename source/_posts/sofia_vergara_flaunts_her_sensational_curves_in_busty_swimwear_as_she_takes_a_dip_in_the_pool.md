She's been busy filming for America's Got Talent.

And Sofia Vergara looked sensational as she flaunted her curves during some downtime at home over Labor Day weekend on Sunday. 

The Modern Family actress, 48, posed up a storm in a white strapless swimsuit which accentuate her ample assets.

Sizzling: Sofia Vergara looked incredible as she flaunted her sensational curves and taut midriff in a strapless white swimsuit on Sunday

Sofia’s stylish suit highlighted her toned frame with a large black belt drawing attention to her slim waist. 

Not forgetting to accessorise, the beauty added a white necklace and pair of glasses from her own Sofia Vergara X Foster Grant collection to dress up her ensemble.

While in another stunning snap Sofia let her caramel tresses cascade over her shoulders and slipped into a burnt orange swimsuit with cut out sides.

Sofia again flaunted her toned frame with a tie-belt around her waist and added a selection of pretty red bracelets to her wrist.

Work it: Sofia revealed she was enjoying some downtime at home in the caption to her sizzling Instagram snaps

The actress' latest swimwear snaps come after she shared several throwbacks to the 90s of her sizzling in bikinis at Miami Beach.

In one video shared to her Instagram, Sofia could be seen rocking a metallic pink bikini which she paired with a stylish arm cuff piece of jewellery.

The TV star posed up a storm in the clip and smiled as she held her arms in the air to make sure the camera got her the best angles.

For the video shoot, Sofia wore a barely-there two piece which crossed over at her chest to emphasise her ample assets.

Flashback: The ageless beauty recently shared a racy throwback video showing her as a blonde in a tiny bikini

Sofia also sported blonde highlighted locks in the 90s clip and was seen rocking a bold eyeliner makeup look.   

Her throwback came as her Time100 Talks was published with TIME reporter Raisa Bruner and Kiva CEO Neville Crawley.

Sofia launched a partnership with Kiva in the spring; Kiva is a global micro-finance nonprofit to support their COVID-19 response fund.

When asked why it's important to her: 'I've always supported and believed in micro-finance I've seen the impact that providing small business loans to marginalized communities can help, especially women owned businesses.' 

The Modern Family actress also said it is important to empower the women 'to create their own income.'

Sofia added that the nonprofit focuses on the people who are in trouble due to the economic impact of COVID-19.

On why entrepreneurship is important: 'Personally I feel like it liberates you when you're able to control you're income and usually women are the ones that - they don't spend their money on partying and alcohol. 

'They spend it on their family. Helping their kids, helping the family - so I think it's super important to help them because I think it spreads more.'

Adding: 'I feel like women have a lot to give and personally I love that Kiva does that.'
