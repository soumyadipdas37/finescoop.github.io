The New York Police Department is on the hunt for a gunman who opened fire multiple times inside a Bronx Deli, leaving workers terrified and a bodega cat bolting for the exit.

The hooded assailant was videoed inside Wally’s Deli along East 223 Street in Wakefield shortly after 9pm on September 8, according to law enforcement.

With a pistol clasped in his hand, the gunman unleashed a hail of bullets through the front window of the store at a group of people standing out-front.

The group stood outside, who are not visible in the footage, returned fire at the man, the NY Daily News reported.

In the video, the gunman is seen staggering backwards and taking cover behind a potato chip stand, before cocking his pistol and firing it towards the store once again.

Bullets can be seen piercing bags of snacks all around the gunman in the returned fire, exploding the plastic and spilling confectionary onto the shop floor.

As the frightening exchange continues, a panicked cat is seen darting from under some shelves and running out of the back door to safety.

The gunman then follows in the cat’s footsteps out the rear of the store and later fled the scene, police say.

Incredibly, nobody was injured in the shootout but the deli owner reported property damage to store windows.

The scene has been described by some online as like a scene from the 'Wild West’.

‘Wow so brazen and scary I hope some citizens recognize him and tell their local precinct Detectives or officers- NCOs and they snatch him up,’

Other viewers of the video voiced concern for the fleeing feline, writing: ‘I hope that bodega cat is OK.’

So far no arrests have been made. In a tweet, the NYPD said the gunman depicted is wanted for reckless endangerment.

He is described as being between 20 and 30-years-old and was wearing black shorts and black sneakers.

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS. All calls will be kept confidential.
