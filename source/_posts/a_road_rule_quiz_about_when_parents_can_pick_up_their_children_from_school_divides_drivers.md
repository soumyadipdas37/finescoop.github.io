A road rules quiz asking whether parents are allowed to stop in loading zones outside of schools to collect their children has divided opinion online. 

The quiz, posted by Queensland's Department of Transport and Main Roads on Monday, has received nearly 100 comments form people debating the sign's instructions. 

'Know your road rules? It's 3pm, school's just finished - are these cars allowed to stop in the loading zone to pick up passengers?' the caption reads. 

A road rules quiz involving a loading zone outside a school has divided drivers about whether parents are allowed to stop to collect their children 

'NO!' one person commenting on the post was quick to write.

'Not on my watch,' another person agreed. 

However, others argued cars could stop as long as they followed certain conditions. 

'Yes they sure are for two minutes' one person said.

'Yep, two minutes to pick up the kiddies,' added another. 

The Department of Transport and Main Roads later posted an update in which they gave the correct answer to the quiz. 

'There's no fooling you guys! Yes, the cars are allowed to stop for two minutes to pick up passengers inside the hours designated on the sign,' the answer states. 

Another person also correctly pointed out this is extended to five minutes when collecting a child with a disability. 

Some people commented that cars would not be able to stop in the loading in their opinion 

While others said parents could stop for two minutes only to collect their children but not leave their car 

Fines apply if police catch vehicles parking outside the loading zone rules with $130 fines in force in Queensland. 

In New South Wales, the fines are higher at $187, while in South Australia the fine is $129. 

In Victoria and Western Australia the fine for parking in a loading zone when not permitted is slightly lower at  $100. 

Queensland is the only state to use the loading zone signs around schools, with other states opting for no stopping or no parking signs which are also enforced with fines. 

The no stopping sign prohibits cars from stopping while the no parking signs allows parents to stop and wait for their child for the two minutes as long as they remain in the vehicle. 

The correct procedure if your children are not ready is to drive around the block and back to the collection area. 

The Department of Transport and Main Roads later posted an update in which they gave the correct answer to the quiz 

QUEENSLAND:

Drop-off and pick-up areas are signed with passenger loading zone signs or two minute parking signs. You have a maximum of two minutes to drop off or collect your children in these areas. 

NEW SOUTH WALES: 

Loading zones not generally used around schools, however, 'no stopping' and 'no parking' signs in use. 'No stopping' sign means drivers cannot stop, while 'no parking' sign allows parents to wait for two minutes to collect their child. 

VICTORIA:

The 'no stopping' and 'no parking' signs are also mainly used in Victoria. With  the 'no parking' sign again allowing parents to wait in their vehicle for two minutes. 

WESTERN AUSTRALIA:

Again in WA loading zones are generally not used around school, instead being replaced with 'no stopping' and 'no parking' signs. Parents should also note double parking is not permitted outside school in every state and territory. 

SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 

Loading zone signs are generally used for commercial areas while school zones use the 'no parking' and 'no stopping' signs.
