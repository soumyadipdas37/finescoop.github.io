West Bromwich Albion have opened talks with Watford over their interest in striker Troy Deeney.

Sportsmail revealed the Baggies interest in the Hornets captain last week and negotiations are now underway.

Watford chief executive Scott Duxbury and WBA sporting director Luke Dowling are at the forefront of talks between both clubs.

West Bromwich Albion have entered talks with Watford over talismanic striker Troy Deeney

The striker was part of the Hornets side that was relegated from the Premier League last term

Dowling has close links at Vicarage Road having left the club he held the role as sporting director in 2017.

The Baggies chiefs knows Deeney, 32, from his three year spell at Watford and is keen to tie up a deal.

Deeney, given his experience and standing as a proven top-flight goalscorer, is attracting interest from a number of Premier League teams with Tottenham among the clubs monitoring his situation.

The 32-year-old's sale could be used to raise funds for Watford, with Tottenham also keen

But WBA appear to be leading the chase to sign the centre-forward.Â 

Watford are open to selling the striker as they look to balance the books following their relegation last season.

Indeed, Deeney is one of a clutch of players who is not required to take a pay reduction following their relegation which increases the likelihood of the club listening to offers for the talismanic skipper.
