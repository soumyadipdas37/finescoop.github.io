Arturo Vidal has arrived in Italy as he closes in on joining Inter Milan.

Vidal had a year remaining on his Barcelona contract but the Spanish club have reportedly agreed to release him for variable performance-related bonuses as opposed to the original fee of €1million (£916million).

As reported by Football Italia, the midfielder arrived at Linate Airport in Milan and was greeted by Inter supporters and the media.

Luis Suarez, whose own future at Barcelona is uncertain, took to Twitter to wish Vidal good luck for the next chapter in his career.

Suarez wrote: 'Having you as a rival was unbearable because of how great you are as a player, but having you as a partner, friend and knowing you as a person is even bigger !!!! A pleasure to have shared with a star player like you. I wish you all the best in this new stage.'

Vidal, who is leaving Barcelona after two years, was in good spirits as he arrived at the airport

Tenerte de rival era insoportable por lo grande que sos como jugador, pero tenerte de compañero, amigo y conocerte como persona sos mas grande todavía!!!! Un placer haber compartido con un crack de jugador como sos. Te deseo todo lo mejor en esta nueva etapa 👑🔝👏#crack pic.twitter.com/FdBLteAI2k

Vidal spent two seasons at Barcelona having joined the club from Bayern Munich in 2018. 

During his time at Barcelona Vidal made 96 appearances and scored eleven goals.
