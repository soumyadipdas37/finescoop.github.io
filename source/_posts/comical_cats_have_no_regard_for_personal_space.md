Anyone who owns a cat will know our much-loved felines like to know exactly what you're up to - and these fluffy friends are no exception.

Pet owners from around the world have been sharing the funniest times they've caught their cat invading their personal space, with some of the funniest snaps collated into an online gallery compiled by BoredPanda. 

In one instance, a man's bath was interrupted by an affectionate kitten who could not bear to be left out of the fun and plonked herself on his chest as he lay in the water. 

Elsewhere, a feline friend attempted to help its owner brush her teeth and another made it his mission to squeeze through a small gap in a door to get as close as possible to his owner.
