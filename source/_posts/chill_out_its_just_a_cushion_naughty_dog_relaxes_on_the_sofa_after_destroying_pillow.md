A mischievous pooch with an appetite for pillows was relaxing after a hard day's work when her owner discovered the mess she had made.  

The white bull terrier from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, was found relaxing on a couch in a pile of pillow stuffing that she had just ripped apart.

A video taken by her owner captures the moment she is caught - but the cowardly dog keeps her eyes covered and won't respond to her owner's scolding.

The footage, which was filmed on November 27 last year, shows the chaotic scene unfold.

A baby is heard crying in the background as the dog owner owner begins to scold the naughty pooch.

The camera pans around showing the mess, with pieces of foam stuffing all over the floor and the couch. 

A video captures the moment she is caught red-handed by her owner but despite the owner's stern scolding, she wags her tail 

Despite being caught red-handed, the dog lays on her back and wags her tail optimistically. 

The naughty dog keeps her eyes buried in the pillow - the only giveaway that perhaps she knows she is in big trouble! 

By the sound of her owner's stern voice, I'm not so sure she got away with this one.
