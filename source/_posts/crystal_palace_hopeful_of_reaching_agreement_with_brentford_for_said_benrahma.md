Crystal Palace are hopeful of reaching an agreement with Brentford for Said Benrahma.

The 25-year-old lit up the Championship last season as Brentford missed out on Premier League promotion after losing the play-off final to Fulham. 

He scored 17 goals and supplied 10 assists in 46 appearances as Thomas Frank's impressed.

Palace, Aston Villa and West Ham have all shown an interest in the winger but the Eagles look set to win the race for his signature.

Benrahma, who is valued at £20million, formed an exciting attacking triumvirate alongside Ollie Watkins and Bryan Mbeumo but that has been broken up this summer.

Watkins completed a £33m switch to Villa last week and in doing so became the most expensive signing from the Championship ever.

Now it looks as though Benrahma is going to join him in the English top flight by moving to Selhurst Park. Palace kick-started their new Premier League campaign with a 1-0 victory over Southampton at the weekend.

Palace have already brought in another talented forward in Eberechi Eze from QPR this summer and their own star winger Wilfried Zaha has been linked with a move away.

Brentford are pressing ahead with a move for 27-year-old Iran international midfielder Saman Ghoddos of Amiens as they look to make additions before the transfer window shuts next month.
