Three contestants vying for Locky Gilbert's heart were sent packing during Wednesday episode of The Bachelor.

Following a dramatic cocktail party where Juliette Herrera was abruptly sent home - it proved to be an equally shocking rose ceremony.

Teachers Maddy Carver and Steph Harper were sent packing from the mansion after they both failed to score a rose from the handsome adventure seeker. 

Reality bites! On Wednesday, Maddy Carver and Steph Harper failed to get a rose from Locky Gilbert on The Bachelor - following Juliette Herrera's dramatic exit from the cocktail party

Maddy and Steph's eliminations occurred after an intense showdown between Juliette and Locky during the show's cocktail party. 

At the soiree, Juliette confronted Locky as to why he kept ignoring her invitation to connect.

'I feel like you don't really know a lot about me because I was always hoping to kind of have a date with you and have that chat with you physically,' she explained.

However, it didn't go according to plan and the 34-year-old stylist was immediately evicted from The Bachelor mansion.

Elsewhere, Locky intercepted Bella Varelis to question her about her intentions after she accused Irena Srbinovska of 'manipulating her way through the show'. 

While it didn't look promising for the petite brunette, Locky eventually handed his final rose to Bella. 

Fearless: 'I feel like you don't really know a lot about me because I was always hoping to kind of have a date with you and have that chat with you physically,' said Juliette (pictured)
