For the first three weeks of her son Vanja's life, Oscar nominee Chloë Sevigny felt like she was 'on ecstasy' while adjusting to first-time motherhood.

'It's just a hormonal surge,' the 45-year-old New Englander explained to WSJ. Magazine on Monday.

'There's this big push because you're so exhausted. Your body exudes this crazy oxytocin love hormone where you just feel like you're high. That was really fun. I was like, "I would do this again, just for this high!"'

Chloë feels 'lucky' that her fiancé Siniša Mackovic 'helps all of the time' because he's 'been home from work,' and her mother Janine 'coming and helping us a few times a week for a few hours.'

'I'm usually really good at time management. I'm actually really proud of how I get everything done in a day,' Sevigny beamed.

'I keep lists, and I'm very organized. Since I've had the baby, I'm just like, I don't know how anybody gets anything done. I have to cook for everyone, then clean, then feed him, then clean him.'

The nineties It Girl is famed for her eccentric style - but these days that involves Adidas shorts, Birkenstocks, Ugg slippers, and 'button-downs because you also need to access your boobs a lot for pumping and feeding.'

'I'm very girl-centric!' The nineties It Girl always dreamed of having a daughter to inherit her clothing collection, so it was an adjustment for her to wrap her head around having a son instead (pictured June 28) 

'You can't really get away with the extra middle weight,' Chloë lamented.

'I'm doing some Zoom Pilates classes and going on walks and trying to diet but not diet...I have these really chic Charvet slippers I get in Paris, and I couldn't even fit in those slippers. It's not pretty over here.'

Sevigny always dreamed of having a daughter to inherit her clothing collection, so it was an adjustment for her to wrap her head around having a son instead.

'I'm very girl-power, girl-friendly, girl-centric. I don't even have that many male friends unless I'd slept with them or whatever,' the Queen & Slim actress noted.

Premieres September 14 on HBO! Chloë was in the midst of her 'crazy first trimester' when she shot her role as soldier Sarah Wilson in Luca Guadagnino's eight-episode miniseries We Are Who We Are

Sevigny recalled: 'I was around so much boy energy, and I didn't know what I was going to have at the time. But on set I kept thinking, "What if I have a kid like this kid [Jack Dylan Grazer]? First of all, he's brilliant, so that would be great; but secondly, he has so much energy"'

Chloë was in the midst of her 'crazy first trimester' when she shot her role as soldier Sarah Wilson in Luca Guadagnino's eight-episode miniseries We Are Who We Are, which premieres September 14 on HBO.

'Working with the boy who plays my [16-year-old] son, Jack Dylan Grazer - he's a prodigy. He's very energetic. I was around so much boy energy, and I didn't know what I was going to have at the time,' Sevigny recalled.

'But on set I kept thinking, "What if I have a kid like this kid Jack? First of all, he's brilliant, so that would be great; but secondly, he has so much energy." It was a lot of meditating on that one.'
