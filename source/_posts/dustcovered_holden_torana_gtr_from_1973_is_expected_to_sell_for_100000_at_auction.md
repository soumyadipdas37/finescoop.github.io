An old Australian muscle car is expected to fetch as much as $100,000 at an upcoming auction.

The 1973 Holden LJ Torana GTR has been sitting in a defunct Ford Dealership in the NSW Riverina town of West Wyalong for the past 35 years after being traded in by a rev head in 1985.

Auctioneers Burns & Co says the classic car only has 86,000km on the odometer and is still in fairly good condition.

'The GTR was developed as the sports version of the Torana range, and though not as hot as the race-bred XU-1 variant, the 1973 Torana GTR was fitted with the 3.3-litre inline-six producing 101kW, coupled with the Aussie-built M21 four-speed manual gearbox,' the website Car Advice reported.

'The dirt-covered VIN plate, showing LJ82911 as the model name, confirms this is a genuine GTR.'

Over the past few months several rare Australian cars have been scooped up for extraordinary prices after being discovered in barns and sheds.

The most notable was the sale of a Ford Falcon XA GT RPO 83 'Chicken Coupe' which sold for a staggering $300,000 at auction in South Australia.

A Fully restored Torana GTR can sell for over $100,000.

Although this one is not exactly pristine, in the current climate it is still extremely rare and likely to attract a very high price from car lovers.

The Auction which is set to go ahead on October 3 and 4, will also feature a few other very sought after cars.

A 1961 Fairlane 'tank' sedan will go under the hammer along with a 2005 Falcon XR8 Devil R with and a 2016 Falcon FGX XR6 ute.

When the original owner traded in the GTR back in 1985, he said he paid $900 for it.
