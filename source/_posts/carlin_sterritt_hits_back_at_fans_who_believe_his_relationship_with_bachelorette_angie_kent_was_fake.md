The Bachelorette's 2019 couple Angie Kent and Carlin Sterritt announced their break-up on July 1, following weeks of speculation they had quietly called it quits.  

But some fans believed the relationship was a 'fake showmance' from the very beginning due to the 32-year-old personal trainer's acting credits. 

'People give those of us who have done acting and stuff in the past such backlash, but we're genuinely putting ourselves out there,' Carlin said on Wednesday.

Carlin spoke about the backlash he received due to his acting past on Big Brother star Sophie Budack's YouTube talk show, Beyond The White Room.

He said he was 'constantly bombarded with people's opinions' of who he was and his character while participating on the popular dating show.

'This show [The Bachelorette], it's you, you're putting yourself our there... I'm not portraying a character,' Carlin said of those who thought his love journey was fake.

Carlin said he found it extremely hard to be judged by viewers and social media commentators for his actions and appearance on the show, because he was putting his heart and soul on the line.

'I'm not being judged on the character I am portraying, I am being judged on me and my character, and that was challenging,' he recalled. 

Ahead of The Bachelorette premiere, Carlin removed 'actor' from his Instagram bio and also deleted his Facebook fan page and StarNow listing.

He had previously appeared in campaigns for menswear brand Tramps The Store and also appeared in short films like Red Zone, Divided and Graveyard Shift.

Furthermore, he had a lead role in the 2018 Australian drama Out of the Woods - which appears to have never been officially released.

He did not address his acting past to Angie on the series, until his brother, Jarvie, told her the fitness trainer saw the show as a career stepping stone.   

It was a devastating blow for Angie, who had previously been warned about Carlin's secret by ousted contestant Jamie Doran. 

The aspiring actor told the How to Life podcast earlier this month that his relationship with Angie, 30, began to fall apart after he discovered she was texting runner-up Timm Hanly. 

Offering her side of the story, Angie revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday that things fizzled out gradually after they left the reality TV 'bubble.
