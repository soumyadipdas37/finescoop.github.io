Scott Morrison has warned that coronavirus is 'keeping us from living' as he urges state premiers to open up their borders and economies.

In a speech in Newcastle today, the prime minister said successfully fighting the virus means protecting jobs.

'During this pandemic we continue to do better than almost every other developed country in the world when it comes to protecting lives and livelihoods,' he said.

'But as long as we are closed, we cannot claim success, as a country. If we are shut, we are not living alongside the virus, the virus is actually keeping us from living. 

'So as we emerge from this second wave in Victoria, and I had a good message from the Victorian Premier this morning, let's now seize the opportunity ahead of us to safely and successfully reopen this country, reconnect this country, and stay open.'
