Kourtney Kardashian's new best friend Addison Rae put on a graceful display in front of her fans as she stopped to take selfies with them on Sunday.

The 19-year-old TikTok star was spotted out in West Hollywood after she picked up a takeout order with a friend.

Her outing came two days after Variety reported that the influencer had made the jump to Hollywood and been cast in the lead role of the gender-swapped remake of the 1999 teen romantic comedy She's All That.

Addison was dressed casually for her food run in one of Kanye West's pricey Jesus Is King hoodies in navy blue and featuring illustrations of Jesus.

The baggy top nearly swallowed up her tiny pink shorts, which showed off her legs.

The social media star founded out her look with a pair of white Yeezy trainers, and she wore her brunette locks in two pig tails dangling over her shoulders and her black backpack. 

She showed a dedication to safety amid the coronavirus pandemic by wearing a pastel green mask, and she added some flair to her look with small gold hoop earrings.

The aspiring actress, whose full name is Addison Rae Easterling, will soon grace screens as one of the leads in a new version of She's All That.

The original teen comedy starred Freddie Prinze Jr. as a guy at the top of the social ladder at his high school who accepts a bet to transform a random nerdy girl (Rachael Leigh Cook) into a popular beauty.

The film, which was a box office success but received mixed reviews, was based on George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion and the subsequent musical adaptation My Fair Lady.

The gender roles are reversed in this upcoming adaptation, and Addison will play an influencer who tries to help a nerdy boy become the prom king.
