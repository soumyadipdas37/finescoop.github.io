Richard is renowned for the impeccable style and quality of his tailoring. After studying fashion at the Brighton College of Art Richard James joined fashion store Brown's where he worked as a buyer.

In 1992 he founded his bespoke Savile Row tailoring and contemporary menswear company – Richard James – with his business partner Sean Dixon, the pair opening the inaugural Richard James shop at 37a Savile Row which became the first tailor on the Row to open on a Saturday.

One of the first visitors was British couturier Sir Hardy Amies, designer to HM The Queen, who arrived in his chauffeur-driven limousine, casting his eyes over Richard James' bold blue, bright pink and acid green contemporary-cut jackets before smiling. 

Sir Hardy was followed by Sir Elton John and Gianni Versace, who both bought garments from the rails.

In 1995 headlines were made around the world when it was revealed that the Queen's nephew David Linley measured for his Richard James suits astride his motorcycle.

In 1996 James was awarded the Evening Standard Eros Award for Retailer of the Year and was profiled in the Cool Britannia edition of Vanity Fair as the UK's premier menswear designer.

In 2000 the Richard James shop moved to its current flagship location at 29 Savile Row, the largest premises on the street. In 2001 Richard James was named by the British Fashion Council as Menswear Designer Of the Year.
