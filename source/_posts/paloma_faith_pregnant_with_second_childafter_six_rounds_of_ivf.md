Paloma Faith has revealed she is expecting her second child after six rounds of IVF. 

The singer, 39, made the announcement via her social media platforms on Thursday alongside a picture cradling her bump. 

She is already mother to a three-year-old daughter with partner Leyman Lahcine.



She penned: 'It is with extreme pleasure I announce I am pregnant. I am going to be releasing new music at this time and wanted to feel free in my body as it changes before all our eyes! 

'I love my job and can’t wait for you all to hear my 5th album and I will be out and about playing as much as this crazy time will allow (also a tour next year).'  

'I am not a skinny pregnant person and I am also high risk in pregnancy so would like to ask the media not to run after me ate get unflattering shots as anxiety is detrimental to me and my baby.

'I had a very traumatic first birth and I am also prone to postpartum depression.

'Being a mother is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me but I will swell up and I won't "glow"! I intend to be very real about this with you all! 

'To all the other pregnant women out there who are as in love with their babies as me but simultaneously s***ing themselves, let's do this'.  

The music star gave birth to her first child with long-term boyfriend Leyman Lahcine in December 2016.
