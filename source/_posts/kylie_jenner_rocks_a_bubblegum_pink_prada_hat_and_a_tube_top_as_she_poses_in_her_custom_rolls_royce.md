Her family's landmark reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians will come to an end next year.

She let her golden brown tresses poke out from under a bubblegum pink Prada bucket hat that matched the mini Birkin bag in her hands. 

Kylie showcased her smooth décolletage and sculpted shoulders in a silky tube top that featured a chic squiggle pattern.

To complete her outfit, the youngest daughter of Kris Jenner threw on some white joggers and a pair of off white Nike sneakers.

The Kardashian side of her family revealed on all their social media platforms on Tuesday that they would be ending their reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians next year.

The shocking announcement did not give a specific reason for pulling the plug of the reality show, but the Kardashian clan did take the time to thank their devout following for their support over the years.  

Kylie marked the news later that night with a fun family get-together as she tried to take a family photo with her squirmy two-year-old daughter Stormi and her ex Travis Scott, 28.
