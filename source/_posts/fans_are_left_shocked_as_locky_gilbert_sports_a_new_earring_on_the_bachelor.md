He's currently looking for love on this season of The Bachelor.

But fans were shocked after noticing Locky Gilbert's new accessory during Thursday night's episode of the show.

The suitor, 31, was spotted wearing an earring during his chat with Roxi Kenny at the cocktail party.

'When did this happen?' Fans were left shocked as Locky Gilbert sported a new earring on The Bachelor on Thursday night

'Is Lockie wearing an earring? Or am I going blind?' one person tweeted.

Another wrote: 'Is that a new iso earring Locky is sporting? All of a sudden he looks like a guy that should be in an Aussie '00s pop-punk band.'

'OMG LOCKY HAS A STUD EARRING!! Should I laugh, this is wild,' one person wrote. 

Another person asked: 'Is Locky's earring new? Did he somehow manage to get a piercing during a pandemic?'

Meanwhile, Roxi dramatically exited the show after a fiery stoush with co-star Juliette Herrera on Thursday.

The 29-year-old reached boiling point after the two women got into an argument at the cocktail party.

After weeks of feuding with Juliette, Roxi couldn't take anymore of it and decided to exit the show.

In an expletive-ridden rant, Roxi fired-off at Juliette: 'Really?! There you go again! Honestly! You do my head in.'

A producer intervened with the two women, asking fuming Roxi to calm down.

Roxi then tearfully said she wanted to leave the mansion. 

The Bachelor continues on Channel Ten, Wednesday, 7.30pm.
