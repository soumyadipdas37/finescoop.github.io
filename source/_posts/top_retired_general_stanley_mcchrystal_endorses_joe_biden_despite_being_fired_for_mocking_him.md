A former Army commander who stepped down in 2010 after mocking then-Vice President Joe Biden endorsed the Democratic nominee Thursday – at the same time George W. Bush's 2004 campaign manager also said he will not vote for President Donald Trump in November.

Retired General Stanley McChrystal told MSNBC's Joe Scarborough during 'Morning Joe' on Thursday that he will be voting for Biden despite his previous criticisms of him.

'I think my willingness to endorse him now should signal to people that there was a respectful relationship then, and just how important I think it is to replicate that kind of relationship between senior military leaders now,' McChrystal said.

'We have to believe in our values. You have to believe that your commander and chief, at the end of the day, is someone that you can trust, and I can trust Joe Biden,' McChrystal said. 

McChrystal came under fire in 2010 after a Rolling Stone article quoted him as mocking Biden, among other top civilian officials.

Even though the general apologized to Biden, he was ultimately pushed to resign.

Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal endorsed Joe Biden on Thursday. He told MSNBC's Joe Scarborough:  'We have to believe in our values. You have to believe that your commander and chief, at the end of the day, is someone that you can trust, and I can trust Joe Biden'

The endorsement comes despite the general stepping down in 2010 after he mocked then-Vice President Joe Biden

At the same time, George W. Bush's 2004 reelection campaign chairman Marc Racicot said he would not be voting for Donald Trump in November

'I worked most closely with President Obama and Vice President Biden when I commanded in Afghanistan, and I had policy differences at times,' McChrystal now reveals. 'But in every instance, they listened. In every instance, they took in my view.'

He continued: 'In every instance, I felt that they were trying to make the best decision based on all the information they had and based upon a bedrock of values.'

Marc Racicot, 72, who chaired George W. Bush's reelection campaign in 2004, said he will vote for Trump in November.

Racicot, who served as Montana's governor for two terms in the 1990s and as Republican National Committee chairman in 2002 and 2003, cited character flaws in President Trump when explaining how he will cast his ballot.

He made the statement during an interview Tuesday on Yellowstone Public Radio with Home Ground host Brian Kahn.

'I regret that I will cause consternation, perhaps, in some corners, but even as a Republican, I will not be supporting Donald Trump for president, and I will not be voting for him,' Racicot said during an interview with Yellowstone Public Radio on Tuesday.

'But at the end, the content of a man's character or a woman's character to serve in that capacity is more important than any other issue that I have to consider as a matter of conscience,' he told 'Home Ground' host Brian Kahn.

Racicot clarified that he still has policy disagreements with Biden and did not explicitly say if he will vote for the Democrat.

While Racicot says he did not vote for Trump in 2016, it is unclear if he did cast his ballot for Democrat Hillary Clinton.

He also said he has 'even more doubts' now than he did in the 2016 election.

Both men coming out against Trump comes as Tuesday's first presidential debate in Cleveland, Ohio was deemed 'chaotic' and a 'dumpster fire' as a general consensus was reached that neither candidate came out looking good.
