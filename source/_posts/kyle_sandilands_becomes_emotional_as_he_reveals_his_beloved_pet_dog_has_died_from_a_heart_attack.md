Kyle Sandilands has been left devastated after the sudden death of his beloved pet dog.

The 49-year-old broke the sad news on Wednesday's Kyle And Jackie O Show, revealing the pooch had a heart attack after suffering with a leg problem that prevented her from standing.  

'I lost a dog last week... That was very sad,' he said during a segment with celebrity pet psychic Amanda De Warren.

'She kept collapsing,' Kyle explained, confirming Amanda's psychic suspicions that the pooch had 'mobility issues'.  

'Was this a heart problem as well?' Amanda queried.  

'Yes, she died of a heart attack, yeah,' Kyle croaked, his voice wavering as he held back tears. 

'She died of a heart attack, yeah': Kyle's voice wavered as he tried to maintain composure 

Thankfully, the psychic assured him that his dog is doing well in the afterlife, and is being kept company by the rest of Kyle's deceased animals. 

'Oh yeah, I've got a lot of animals. I've got 100 animals,' Kyle remarked, before sharing another tragic detail of his dog's passing. 

'I haven't actually spent time with the dog because all the animals are with my ex [Imogen Anthony],' he confessed.  

Separated: Kyle admitted he hadn't spent much time with the dog recently, as all his animals live with his ex-girlfriend Imogen Anthony (pictured) on the farm they once purchased together  

'We haven't been together for a while now so it was a shock.' 

Imogen currently lives on the $3million Southern Highlands farm she purchased with ex-boyfriend Kyle prior to their split last November.  

Despite their breakup, the former couple have refused to sell the sprawling ranch because their 100 rescue animals still live there.

The pair, who dated for eight years, had named the property 'Crimson Peak' after its red A-line roof structure.
