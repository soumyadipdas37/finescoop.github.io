Technology stocks have been on a helter-skelter ride this week, causing investors to ask: do these tumbling share prices point to a repeat of the dot.com bust of 2002? Or is this the moment to buy? 

The centre of attention was Tesla considered a tech stock thanks to its software.

The electric car maker's shares suffered a 21 per cent drop on Tuesday alone, following the decision not to allow the company to join the S&P 500 index – the stock market's version of the cold shoulder. 



Tesla shares, which were $86 in January, now stand at $368, having reached $498 on August 31. Meanwhile, Alphabet – owner of Google – Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft were also caught up in the turmoil, losing about $950billion of their combined value. 

Later in the week, these shares bounced back to some extent, but their image of invincibility has been dented. However, this pause in their ascent is not a signal to panic. Observers do not view the week's events as a replay of the dot.com slump of 2002 when ill-conceived online shopping startups failed, leaving shareholders with huge losses. 

Jason Hollands of Bestinvest, comments: 'Most of the companies that went under at that time weren't proper businesses. You can't make an analogy with Amazon, Apple and the rest which generate real cash flow.' 

Yet a sense of unease remains, deepened by the revelation that some of the surge in prices had been driven by speculative derivatives trading. Softbank, the Japanese conglomerate, is reported to have gambled £30billion on tech stocks through call options. 

These give the right to buy a share at a fixed price in the future. Private investors in the US have also been using such derivatives to bet on tech stocks using hugely popular trading apps such as Robinhood that make investing seem like video gaming. 

The price falls have turned the focus on Baillie Gifford, the most prominent UK backer of the tech titans. Fortunately, before the sell-off, the managers reduced the group's Tesla stake from 7 per cent to 5 per cent – scoring a profit of $17billion. Tesla was the largest holding at Baillie Gifford's Scottish Mortgage investment trust, which slipped to a 4.5 per cent discount (its share price is below its net asset value) although this has already narrowed to 2.5 per cent. 

Tom Slater, co-manager of Scottish Mortgage, says the decision to sell was driven by portfolio concentration rules. He told CNBC: 'I think that Tesla addresses such a large opportunity. It is only just getting started.' 

This upbeat assessment by Slater is based on the application of Tesla's battery technology to electricity generation. 

Investors in Scottish Mortgage like me will be interested to learn that Slater and his co-manager James Anderson will not be shunning Tesla, which has been in the portfolio since 2013. In fact they plan to acquire more shares. 

This strategy of taking profits and waiting in case further volatility presents a buying opportunity is reasonable given the rises in tech share prices this year. Apple shares are $113, against $56 in March, which puts the week's gyrations into context. 

This tactic has already been employed by David Coombs, head of multi-asset investment at Rathbone. He took profits on Alphabet and Amazon in August when the shares were still climbing. He says: 'It was embarrassing for a bit, but we were concerned that derivatives were pushing up prices.' He will be looking to rebuild his positions when these effects start to lessen, hoping to repeat his successful foray into the market after the March rout. He bought Microsoft at $135. Now they are $212. 

The key reason to buy tech shares is the belief that changes in habits forced on us by lockdown and working from home could become permanent. But the tech giants' progress may yet be impeded. Hollands warns: 'Both Trump and Biden may be minded to clip the wings of Big Tech.' 

This political dimension is a reminder of the need for diversification. The tech sector has been boosted by the fashion for buying expensive shares. This is not the moment to start embracing cheap shares (they may be cheap for a reason). Yet it may be worth checking sectors left behind in the love affair with tech. Hollands points to oil stocks and banks. 

The events this week have highlighted the risk of investing and the need to spread your risks, as too many learnt to their cost at the time of dot.com debacle.
