Ray J filed for divorce from wife of four-years Princess Love, 36, this past Monday.

But the 39-year-old singer appeared to admit he was having second thoughts about the decision while being grilled about his marriage by the hosts of The Real on Tuesday. 

'When you're in your own relationship, sometimes, you know, sometimes you do things spontaneously, sometimes you move too fast, sometimes you make mistakes, you know what I mean?' he began. 

'And so ... I'm not saying that that's what I did, or that I made a mistake, but I don't know if I did make a mistake. I don't know.'

Ray J added: 'I have every right to just not know and still just try to figure it out.'

Host Jeannie Mai confronted the One Wish hitmaker about 'refusing to go to marriage counseling' with Princess Love and encouraged him to explain his reasoning behind the refusal. 

'I just felt like the counseling was more so a hustle and it wasn't good ... I felt like it would get one-sided,' he stated, before suddenly shifting his opinion on the matter. 'But, hey, maybe we do need counseling.' 

Co-host Adrienne Bailon, surprised by Ray J's sudden open-mindedness, asked him point-blank 'if [he] would be open to' marriage counseling now.

'Yeah I would,' he replied, before admitting that he 'spent all weekend at the house with the kids, Princess, [his] mom and her friends' and that the visit's 'good vibe' made him realize how good he has it.

'It was just a good vibe, it really was. I just have to fall back and go, damn, this is a really, really good thing.' 

'I would be up for it. I'd be up for whatever it is to make sure my kids have a strong foundation and have both their parents in their lives 24/7,' explained Ray J, who, as part of his divorce filing, requested joint custody of the couple's two children.

Ray J and Princess Love, who wed in 2016, share eight-month old son Epik Ray and two-year-old daughter Melody Love.

Change of heart: 'I just felt like the counseling was more so a hustle and it wasn't good ... I felt like it would get one-sided,' he stated, before suddenly shifting his opinion on the matter. 'But, hey, maybe we do need counseling'

He continued: 'I don't see myself splitting the time, it's so tough to not be with your kids all of your time.' 

With counseling officially on the table, host Loni Love asked Ray J, born William Ray Norwood Jr., to explain 'the problem' with him and Princess Love's relationship.  

'It's not about unhappiness, sometimes we don't see eye to eye and it maybe gets too explosive and sometimes we might move too fast. Sometimes we might not move too fast.'  

'Do you want to be married?' asked Mai. '[For] the kids, yes, but you have to have a happy family from a happy, stable, loyal marriage?'

For the kids: 'I would be up for it. I'd be up for whatever it is to make sure my kids have a strong foundation and have both their parents in their lives 24/7,' explained Ray J, who, as part of his divorce filing, requested joint custody of the couple's two children

Ray J, getting a bit defensive, replied: 'Yeah, don't beat me up!' 

To close out the intense interview, The Real's newest host and Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Garcelle Beauvias wondered if Ray J was confessing to cheating on Princess Love via the lyrics on his new album Hurt You. 

'I don't think it's ever been about me cheating. It's been more so about compromising, and understudying and listening and being on the same page. That was more our issue than anything,' he explained.  

Ray J, who enlisted celebrity lawyer Laura Wasser for proceedings, filed for dissolution of marriage in Los Angeles County Court on Monday, September 14.

Deflecting: 'I don't think it's ever been about me cheating. It's been more so about compromising, and understudying and listening and being on the same page. That was more our issue than anything,' he explained

In the filing, the I Hit It First singer claimed he and Princess Love had a prenuptial agreement that he wants enforced, which details prior-agreed support and personal property which is not part of the marriage.  

Back in May, Princess had filed for divorce from the singer, before seemingly having a change of heart and requesting to dismiss the filing on July 8. 

Princess had sought full legal and physical custody of their two kids along with child support.

A representative for the couple said at the time, 'It's a very difficult time for both Princess and Ray J and we are asking that we just let them have their privacy as they work through and deal with this very trying situation.' 

During her second pregnancy Princess and the rapper had an explosive fight with conflicting accounts of what happened in Las Vegas, at the end of November.

She accused him of abandoning her and Melody in Las Vegas after an argument, while he insisted he had stayed in town.

They appeared to make up after the disastrous trip, however, Ray J had been self-isolating away from his wife and children amid the coronavirus pandemic.
