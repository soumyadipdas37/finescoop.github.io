She's vowed to stay healthy after celebrating her 40th birthday on Sunday.

And Kerry Katona was proudly displaying her toned physique in an array of snaps as she continued with a 10-day detox following a family getaway to Spain.

The reality star - who is engaged boyfriend Ryan Mahoney - told fans she recently made a 'promise to look after herself' by eating well and staying sober after turning 40, and has taken the first step with a post-holiday detox.

Stylish: Kerry Katona, 40, was proudly displaying her toned physique in an array of snaps as she continued with a 10-day detox following a family getaway to Spain

In one snap Kerry slipped into taupe knitted loungewear as she posed in front of her bedroom, with the second and third images taken during her 40th birthday celebrations.

The star put on a leggy display in a black mini dress as she brandished her celebratory badge.

Kerry then went onto flaunt her toned figure in comfy pyjamas in another bedroom snap as she vowed to stay in shape during the COVID-19 crisis.

She penned the caption: 'Wow I'm only on day 4 of my 10 day Challenge and I honestly can't believe how good I'm feeling!!!

'If I'm feeling and looking this good on day 4 can't wait for day 10!!! Really overindulged on holiday and I already feel the Bloatedness going.... 40 and feeling fit! 

'Oh can't believe how well I've been sleeping at night but Energy is high in the day! Soooo happy to be doing this. 

'Now I'm 40 I've made a promise to myself to look after myself the best I can, I've quit smoking don't really drink and exercise is my best friend... if anyone wants to come and join me let me know and we can do it together!'

Last week Kerry surprised fans with the news that she was engaged to boyfriend of two years Ryan.

The star, 39, took to YouTube on Wednesday to upload a video of the health and nutrition expert, 31, getting down on one knee to pop the question - a plan her children and pals were already aware of.

The singer couldn't contain her shock and fell to the ground once she realised what Ryan had up his sleeve.

'Are you mad? Are you sure? You know my track record right? I can't believe it', the mother-of-five said in reference to her tumultuous romance history.

Kerry married Westlife's Brian McFadden, 40, in 2002, but he filed for divorce in 2004 and embarked on a seven-year relationship with Australian singer Delta Goodrem shortly after. 

The former couple's divorce was finalised in 2006, before the mother-of-five went on to tie the knot to taxi driver Mark Croft, 49, on Valentine's Day in 2007. 

They split just two years later, and Kerry was married to George Kay from 2014 until 2017, who sadly died from an overdose last year aged 39.

She raises children Molly, 18, and Lilly-Sue, 17, with Brian, while she shares Heidi, 13, and Max, 12, with second spouse Mark and had Dylan-Jorge, six, with former sports star George.
