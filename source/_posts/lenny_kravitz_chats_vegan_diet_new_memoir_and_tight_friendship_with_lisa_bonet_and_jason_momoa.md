Despite their 1993 divorce, four-time Grammy winner Lenny Kravitz is proud that he's remained close with his ex-wife Lisa Bonet as well as her second husband Jason Momoa.

'People can't believe how tight Jason and I are, or how tight I still am with [my daughter] Zoë's mom, how we all relate,' the 56-year-old rock star said in the November edition of Men's Health.

'We just do it because that's what you do. You let love rule, right? I mean, obviously, after a breakup, it's work. It takes some work and time, healing and reflection, et cetera. But as far as Jason and I? Literally the moment we met, we were like, "Oh, yeah. I love this dude."'

The 56-year-old rock star said in the November edition of Men's Health: 'People can't believe how tight Jason and I are, or how tight I still am with [my daughter] Zoë's mom, how we all relate. We just do it because that's what you do. You let love rule, right?'

In his upcoming memoir, Lenny focuses on his early years leading up to his marriage to the 52-year-old former Cosby kid, whom he met in an elevator backstage at a New Edition concert in 1985.

Lisa inspired Kravitz - then known as Romeo Blue - to discover his artistic path in a more authentic way, and she even co-wrote two songs on his 1989 debut record, Let Love Rule.

The Ride rocker called his 31-year-old daughter - currently filming her role as Catwoman in Matt Reeves' The Batman - as 'the most real person I know.'

'I know. It wasn't easy, I'm sure, but she's just forged her way with elegance, you know?' Lenny gushed.

 Happy birthday brother. Love and respect always. Ohana ‘til the end.

'Just having two parents who were known in the world. The comparisons. She didn't let any of that hinder her in any way.'

In March as the coronavirus swept the globe, Kravitz left his four-story 1920s townhouse in Paris's upscale 16th Arrondissement to live in an Airstream trailer on the beach at the Bahaman isle of Eleuthera.

The biracial belter later bought a one-room house that she shares with his adopted potcake dogs off the street, Leroy and Jojo.

Lenny noted: 'It's a beautiful thing to really realize what you don't need. If I have to stay here another five months, five years, I'm good.'

Kravitz's strict vegan raw diet comes from the many fruits and vegetables he grows on his farm.

'Soursops are my favorite. Soursop is good for you,' the native New Yorker said in an accompanying Men's Health video.

'As you can see, I'm vegan and primarily raw. I have done extensive raw diets where I eat raw for a year. When I'm here, I like to eat as much food as possible especially in the summer time when you have all of these beautiful fruits growing.

'But then there will be times where I don't take in sugar - not even fruit sugar - and I just eat green. Like sauteed spinach or kale salad. I'm very careful about what I put into my body and how I take care of my body.

Volkswagen Bug: When it comes to cheat meals, Kravtiz loves a fully-loaded Beyond Burger as well as carb-filled pasta, bread, pancakes, and waffles

'So it's a combination of eating all these things that I've shown you and working out and keeping my muscles and my joints in shape so that I can do what I do, which is get up on stage and play music and have a body that feels free. So I can express myself.'

Lenny explained: 'Those four words, man, affected me more than I knew...I love my father, and we made peace before he died, but I held on to some things that had affected me in our relationship, and through writing the book...I was able to strip away some of the judgment that I had held on to and got to just see him as a human being'
