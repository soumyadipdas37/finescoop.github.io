COVID-19 denier Pete Evans has lashed out at a pro-mask safety advert for the Victorian government which features food critic, Matt Preston.

In the campaign released last week, Preston, 49, is filmed urging viewers to follow the State's mandatory face-covering rules to 'restore the glory days' of eating out at a restaurant.

Despite Victoria recording 114 new cases and a further 11 deaths on Sunday, conspiracy theorist Evans, 47, took to Instagram to blast the former MasterChef judge's message as one of the 'disgraceful, demeaning and insulting ads' he had ever seen.

'I'm insulted!' COVID-19 denier Pete Evans has lashed out at a pro-mask safety advert for the Victorian government which features food critic, Matt Preston.

The former My Kitchen Rules judge added: 'My heart goes out to all the businesses, including the restaurants & cafes that are closed down or struggling to survive and also the staff who are out of work, because of this ongoing fraud, that is this lockdown.'

Astonishingly, Pete said that the ad 'has only enabled the govt to extend its lockdown in Victoria by spreading misinformation [sic].'

Pete, who has feverishly spread dangerous views and conspiracy theories on the coronavirus pandemic, defiantly continued: 'I would have hoped that the people that appeared in these ads would have explored the science that pertains to wearing a mask.

'I do have to say that that the mask this person is wearing would do f*** all anyway. So what is the point behind these ads really? ✌️❤️ WHO are the going to roll out next?' he concluded.

'Insulting and demeaning': Evans, 47, took to Instagram to blast Preston's message as one of the 'disgraceful, demeaning and insulting ads' he had ever seen

Pandemic: On Sunday, Victoria recorded 114 new cases and a further 11 deaths 

His post comes after Magda Szubanski hit out again at Pete for being a COVID-19 denier.

In a tweet on Friday, the comedian, 59, shared a link to a recent article on their feud, and said it's far more dangerous to not believe the virus is real, than to be fat. 

On Tuesday, she claimed that Evans had encouraged his supporters on social media to mock her weight after she participated in the same COVID-19 safety advert for the Victorian government as Matt. 

'Fat ain't contagious': This comes after Magda Szubanski (left), 59, SLAMMED Pete for being a COVID-19 denier in a tweet on Friday, after the chef blasted her 'offensive' campaign for the Victorian government

Alongside a link to the article, Szubanski wrote: 'And of course much more alarming to me than anything these people say about my weight is that THEY DON'T BELIEVE COVID IS REAL!

'That poses a far greater risk to other people's health than me being fat. Fat ain't contagious.'   

Hours prior, the actress shared a photo on Twitter of her 'paleo breakfast', consisting of what looked to be salmon, egg and tomato, alongside a laughing face emoji.

Szubanski also revealed that she doesn't disagree with everything Evans promotes, just his disbelief on the coronavirus pandemic. 

She wrote in an earlier tweet on Friday: 'Ya (sic) know, I don't disagree with Pete Evans about everything. I've been going to health retreats and ashrams and eating alternative foods since before he was born.

'[Love] that stuff. There really is just one MAJOR disagreement - and it's the only one that matters...I believe Covid is real.' 

'There really is just one major disagreement': Szubanski also revealed that she doesn't disagree with everything Evans promotes, just his disbelief on the coronavirus pandemic.

Fat-shaming accusation: On Tuesday, Szubanski claimed that Evans had encouraged his supporters on social media to mock her weight after she participated in a COVID-19 safety advert for the Victorian government 

Not happy: While Evans did not make any reference to Szubanski's appearance in his post shared the day prior, hundreds of his fans responded with hurtful comments saying Szubanski shouldn't be the face of a public health campaign because of her size

On Monday, Evans shared a post to social media of Szubanski's COVID-19 safety advert, claiming that the Victorian government 'doesn't want to help people get healthy'.

While Evans did not make any reference to Szubanski's appearance in the post, hundreds of his fans responded with hurtful comments saying that Szubanski shouldn't be the face of a public health campaign because of her size.   

'Imagine if they wanted to help people get healthy... how would an ad like that look and sound?' Evans wrote. 

'Let's give it a try shall we... spread love, be free, eat anti-inflammatory healthy food, hug each other.' 

Having his say: Evans' post suggested that the Victorian government doesn't want 'to help people get healthy', and many of his supporters felt this was a subtle reference to Szubanski's weight

After being flooded with abuse about her size, Szubanski tweeted that she was 'sick of skinny people' like Evans thinking they are better than everybody else.

'Frankly I am sick to f**king death of skinny people (yes Pete Evans and your followers) assuming they are morally and spiritually superior,' she wrote.

She then shared a picture of her Polish grandmother, whom she described as 'fat', and pointed out her remarkable achievements in life.   







Hitting back: After being flooded with abuse about her size, Szubanski tweeted that she was 'sick of skinny people' thinking they are better than everybody else. She singled out Evans' supporters specifically

'Fat-shaming me and assertion that fat people have no place in discussion about public health not only insults me but also all the fat nurses, doctors, ambos etc. who give so much,' she wrote.

'My Polish gran was fat and a nurse and she risked her life to hide Jews from the Nazis... Fatties Unite.'

Szubanski went on to say that she was 'raised on vitamins' and 'alternative eating' after her father was diagnosed with cancer, and then asked Evans if any of his followers had achieved long-term weight loss by using his discredited Paleo diet. 

'I never said it and never will': Evans responded to Szubanski's tweets later on Tuesday, and clarified that he had not intended to 'fat-shame' her

Evans responded to Szubanski's tweets later on Tuesday, and clarified that he had not intended to 'fat-shame' her.  

He shared a screenshot of a news article about the controversy, and told his Instagram followers: 'Nope. I never said it and never will. 

'All I said was the ads on TV using these people are the most disgraceful and offensive I have ever seen. Get your facts right media and I have always loved Magda as an artist.'  

Causing a stir: For the purposes of the advert, she reprised her role as Sharon Strzelecki, from the hit sitcom Kath & Kim, and said: 'The sooner we obey the rules the sooner this will be over'
