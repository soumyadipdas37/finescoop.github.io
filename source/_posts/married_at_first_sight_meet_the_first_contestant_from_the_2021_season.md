Filming for Married At First Sight 2021 is currently under way in Sydney.

And Daily Mail Australia can exclusively reveal the identity of one of the grooms set to appear on Channel Nine's social experiment.

Hit 104.7 radio presenter Bryce Ruthven has temporarily relocated to Sydney, and believed to have taken three months of leave to appear on the show.

Is this MAFS' latest heartthrob? Hit 104.7 radio personality Bryce Ruthven, 30, (pictured) is rumoured to be joining the cast of Married At First Sight next year

The 30-year-old is hoping to find the love of his life on reality TV, having reportedly ended his engagement to a woman named Lana earlier this year.

Bryce has recently been interacting online with former MAFS stars, several of whom he's previously interviewed on his Canberra radio show.

In another telling clue that he's joined the cast, his Instagram account with more than 12,500 followers is now private - which is a requirement for upcoming brides and grooms.

Despite being a public figure his Instagram account, which boasts over 12,500 followers, also remains firmly locked, which is a usual requirement for the show's upcoming cast

When contacted by Daily Mail Australia for comment, Bryce refused to confirm or deny his appearance on the Nine show.

Meanwhile, a production insider has revealed that MAFS bosses are hoping to portray the sports lover as 'the next Seb Guilhaus'.

A cursory glance at his social media accounts reveals he is a passionate soccer fan, having played for Central Queensland FC.

Although he is yet to be confirmed, a MAFS insider has claimed producers are hoping to portray him as the next Seb Guilhaus and an avid sports nut.

Nine has promised that the upcoming season's cast will be 'the most genuine yet'.

The network has also claimed the 2021 series will be about 'love not fame' as all the contestants are determined to find their lifetime match. 

The new season will also feature Alessandra Rampolla, a certified clinical sexologist with more than 20 years' experience, on the panel of experts.
