Sky Sports' major shake-up of their punditry teams for the coming season will see Roy Keane lead the way, alongside Micah Richards and Patrice Evra.

The broadcasting giant has in recent weeks been revamping ahead of football's return, by clearing out some household names in order to take a refreshed approach.

Keane, Richards and Evra will lead the way in the studio alongside a match day host, as Sky Sports televise some of the biggest clashes in the country.

Former Man City and Aston Villa defender Richards has earned rave reviews since entering the world of punditry, due to his infectious charm and knowledge of the game.

Keane meanwhile has been on Sky's books for some time, offering frank and hard-hitting opinions on the day's performances. He will be joined by former team-mate Evra, who has also been making steadily more appearances in the studio over the past 18 months.

Since his introduction to the studio, Richards has gained fans with his knowledge and charm

Fan favourites Jamie Carragher, Gary Neville, Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp will continue to analyse and provide insight on matchdays also, along with their Monday Night Football segment.

The shake-up will also extend as far as the popular Soccer Saturday football show, which recently dominated the headlines following the chopping of regular trio Matt Le Tisser, Phil Thompson and Charlie Nicholas.

In bringing in the replacements, Wycombe star and charismatic personality Adebayo Akinfenwa is set to enter the world of punditry, along with Tim Sherwood, Robbie Fowler and Joleon Lescott, as report the Sun.

They will each join long-term host Jeff Stelling, who recently admitted he could quit the show after being left devastated by the sackings of his close friends.
