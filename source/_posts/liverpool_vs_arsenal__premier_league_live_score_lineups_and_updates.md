Liverpool host Arsenal on Monday night as both sides look to keep up their fine start to the season, in the first of two clashes between the teams this week. 

Jurgen Klopp's champions have recorded two wins from two in the Premier League, following victories against Leeds and Chelsea. 

Mikel Arteta's side are also on maximum points after wins against Fulham and West Ham - both the Reds and the Gunners will also meet at Anfield again on Thursday evening, in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup. 

Sportsmail's KISHAN VAGHELA will provide live coverage of Liverpool vs Arsenal this evening including score, lineups and build-up. 

Host commentator

What a Monday night we have lined up in the Premier League, as Arsenal make the trip up to Anfield to face Liverpool.

It is the first of two meetings between these sides in the space of four days, so they will be reasonably well acquainted by the time their League Cup clash ends on Thursday.

But right now Jurgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta's priority is to try and keep their 100 per cent records in this season's Premier League going, in a game which may once again provided goals, thrills and spills.
