All the familiar criticisms surrounding Rory McIlroy and his allegedly one-dimensional game surfaced once more on a day when Winged Foot exacted a most terrible revenge.

It should be said the Northern Irishman was in good company in failing to live up to the promise of his opening 67 in the US Open with a disappointing 76.

But it inevitably led to trenchant commentators such as Sir Nick Faldo and Paul McGinley lamenting McIlroy’s palpable lack of a Plan B when the going gets tough.

And boy, was it tough. We knew there would be a price to pay for the USGA getting the set-up horribly wrong on day one and making it far too easy. It duly arrived, as Winged Foot well and truly put the boot in.

First round leader Justin Thomas fared eight shots worse than his opening 65 with a 73. Just as he did at the same venue in 2006, Tiger Woods missed the halfway cut, tumbling out following rounds of 73, 77. Lee Westwood was another victim, like McIlroy reversing the figures of his opening 67 with a 76. The list went on.

Imagine what it is going to be like over the weekend? Almost inevitably, it will get tougher still. It might not be to the taste of everyone but no one can deny that a proper US Open has broken out. The reputation of this magnificent monster of a venue has been restored. Bring on the misery.

Whatever happened to the sublime McIlroy who stroked one beautiful shot after another on day one? He was there on his opening hole, with a majestic birdie. He was barely seen again. McIlroy dropped no fewer than six shots over the next seven holes. He will start the third round seven behind.

The Northern Irishman was not the only one to struggle on the second day at Winged Foot

When Bryson DeChambeau declared on the eve of the event that he was going to bludgeon Winged Foot into submission, it is fair to say that gales of laughter broke out once that rather broad back was turned.

Who bullies this venue, for heaven’s sake? Well, on this compelling second day, one of the few still standing at the end was the scientist who might not be quite so mad after all.

On his final hole, the par-five ninth on the course, the fascinating 27-year-old American flexed those enormous muscles for a 365-yard drive and a lofted iron next to the flag for an eagle three and a wonderful 68.

It left him in second place on three under, one shot off the halfway lead held by former Masters champion Patrick Reed, and set the scene for a seismic battle of wills this weekend between the game’s macho man and a course with a DNA designed to repel such wanton aggression. Who’s your money on?

‘It’s all about hitting fairways and if I can do that I can continue to score well,’ insisted DeChambeau, who, following his first round 69, had opened with consecutive rounds under par for the first time in a major.

Whatever you think of his bulked-up frame and determination to bulldoze the game’s accepted wisdom, one thing you can’t question is his dedication. He was out there practising late on Thursday night because he had heard the weather would be cooler on Friday morning and wanted to hit shots in similar temperatures. He got his reward all right.

Reed was out in the tougher afternoon conditions and was one of the few whose body language suggested he was enjoying the grind. Consistent American Harris English, Thomas and Spaniard Rafa Cabrera-Bello are two behind.

World No 2 John Rahm is five shots adrift following a 72 and No 1 Dustin Johnson is seven behind after a 70.

What a contrast with day one. All it took was a little wind, a slight firming of the greens and tougher flag positions for the slippery slopes on this forbidding venue to do their diabolical work. Who wants a birdie-fest at this major?

Day two at Winged Foot Golf Course saw casualties for many big-name players in US Open

Spaniard John Rahm started strongly but regressed to finish give shots behind DeChambeau

Gifted Belgian Thomas Pieters got to six under for the event but had fallen back to level par by the finish. He was gutted signing his scorecard but sensible enough to know that his halfway total will look an awful lot healthier this morning.

Bubba Watson showed the craft and imagination that saw him win two Masters titles to stand at three under for his round playing the 18th hole. Just under 500 yards from sanctuary but what a third of a mile in front of him.

The maverick lefty saw one chip to the viciously sloping green come back to his feet as he became yet another casualty of this brutal closing hole — yet another to run up a double bogey.

Tiger might have been the biggest name but there were plenty more high-profile players who will not be around this weekend, including poor Jordan Spieth, who had 11 bogeys and no birdies in a wretched 81.

The culling of the 13-strong English contingent included the likes of Tommy Fleetwood and Tyrrell Hatton, fancied by many in the build-up to claim a first major win. Justin Rose and Ian Poulter also missed out.
