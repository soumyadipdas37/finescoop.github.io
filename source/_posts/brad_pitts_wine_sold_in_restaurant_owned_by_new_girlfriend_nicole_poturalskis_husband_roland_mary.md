Brad Pitt, 56, has recently been enjoying a new romance with girlfriend Nicole Poturalski, 27.

The Academy Award winner's latest relationship is anything but typical, as Poturalski is said to be in an open marriage. 

And the trio's connection has even overlapped into the professional, as her German restaurateur husband Roland Mary, 68, reportedly sells Pitt's wine Château Miraval in his Berlin eatery Borchardt.

The brand's 2019 Rosé Provence is recommended on the hot spot's menu, reading: 'For chanterelle we offer this exceptional wine.'

Pitt reportedly bought the vineyard with ex-wife Angelina Jolie, 45, back in 2011 for $60million, and they continue to maintain the estate with the Perrin family. 

He enjoyed a romantic getaway late last month with Poturalski to the vineyard, located in the village of Correns in the South of France.

Their vacation also happened to land on the sixth anniversary of his wedding to Jolie, which took place at Château Miraval on August 23, 2014.

The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood star was romantically linked to Poturalski as far back as last summer, meeting at her husband's restaurant. 

It was recently revealed that the German model has been married to Mary for eight years, and they share a seven-year-old child. 

A source told DailyMail.com of her polyamorous arrangement: 'They are still married, but you could describe their relationship as an 'open marriage.' He has been married several times and has five children. He is not interested in negativity or jealousy.'

Pitt has been particularly elusive about his love life, which has included rumors of dating Charlize Theron, 45, and Alia Shawkat, 31, in recent years. 

He told The New York Times last December: 'People always say they don't read about themselves. I never believe it.

'I don't go out of my way to avoid it; I just don't seek it out. I don't know how many women they've said I've been dating the last two or three years, and none of it's true.'

The Fight Club actor began dating Jolie in 2005, and they share Maddox, 18, Pax, 15, Zahara, 14, Shiloh, 13, Vivienne, 11, and Knox, 11.

Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, and they've continued to negotiate their assets since, including Château Miraval.

According to Us Weekly, the divorce proceedings have recently hit another snag: 'Tensions have escalated between Brad and Angelina, with family therapy no longer taking place.'
