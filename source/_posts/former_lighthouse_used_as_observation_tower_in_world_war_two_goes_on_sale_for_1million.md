A former lighthouse that once also served as an observation tower during the Second World War has been put on the market and valued at £1million.

The Old Lighthouse on St Anne's Head, near Haverfordwest in Wales, was decommissioned decades ago before being turned into an eight-bedroom home.

The unique property also features four en-suite bathrooms, five reception rooms as well as a swimming pool and a sauna.

Some of the rooms in the former lighthouse are located in the original tower itself, including the main kitchen and the observatory. Pictured: The spiral staircase in the lighthouse

It is believed that the Coastguard renovated the top-floor of the lighthouse when they used the property as a headquarters in order to give themselves a 360 degree view of the area

Some of the property's rooms, including the main kitchen, are located within the former lighthouse itself.

At one stage in its history, the former lighthouse was also used by the Coastguard who renovated the top floor of the lighthouse to become an observatory that offered a complete 360 degree view of the entire area.  

Speaking about the property, Rhys Jordan, of estate agents Purple Bricks, said: 'For a time it was the Coastguard HQ and so I am guessing it may have been them who added the observation room.'

He said the downstairs accommodation was used as offices during this time. 



The floor plan shows just how large the former lighthouse property is. Complete with a garage, porch and multiple bathrooms

The £1million listing also features an indoor swimming pool that boasts an incredible view of the ocean through full-length windows

One of the property's unique selling points is the 360 degree view it provides of the picturesque landscape and coastline nearby

The former lighthouse is so large that it boasts eight bedrooms, four of which have en-suite bathrooms

'The property has been a phenomenally successful holiday let which is great,' he said, 'but the family who own it have decided to take a break from that and this is why they've put it up for sale.'

He believes there are several options a new owner could take.

He said: 'It could easily continue as a holiday let, or as a home and holiday let, depending on what people wanted.

'The owner's daughter used to live here where when she was a child so we know it would make a great family home, too.

The incredible property also features a garden terrace that offers an incredible ocean view and plenty of seating

Nautical-themed cushions are used to decorate this living room - one of five reception rooms in the property on sale for just under £1million

The former lighthouse includes this large joint living and dining room separated by an ornate brick fireplace in the centre of the room

'It's a unique location and living here would be a unique experience - there aren't that many lighthouses that come up for sale.'

The lighthouse also benefits from being located on a peninsula which is often reported to be the sunniest place in Wales with very low levels of rainfall. 

The area is also regarded as a premier spot for British wildlife, with colonies of kittiwakes, Manx shearwaters, gannets and puffins nearby, as well as dolphins being regularly spotted in the local waters.
