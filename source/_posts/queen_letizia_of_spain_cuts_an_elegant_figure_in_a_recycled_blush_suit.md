Queen Letizia of Spain looked effortlessly chic today as she stepped out for a meeting in Madrid. 

The royal, 48, oozed sophistication as she sported a recycled Boss suit, featuring a double breasted pink blazer and matching tailored cigarette trousers.  

Mother-of-two Letizia is honorary president of the Spanish Association Against Cancer (AECC) and attended a meeting in Madrid for World Cancer Research Day. 

The former journalist is known for her thrifty fashion sense and love for re-wearing pieces, having already stepped out in the stylish suit twice this year.

She teamed her look with a pair of stylish leather heels while opting for a white leather shoulder bag, matching her white satin blouse.

Her brunette tresses were loose around her shoulders and Letizia opted for a light makeup look, with a hint of matching pink eye-shadow. 

The mother-of-two, who is married to King Felipe of Spain, wore a blue medical mask and was seen re-reading her notes ahead of the meeting. 

Queen Letizia met with Spain's Minister of Science and Innovation, Pedro Duque alongside the President of AECC, Ramon Reyes.

The meeting attended by the monarch was for the AECC which helps fund cancer research projects to foster better diagnosis and treatment

The AECC involves patients, families, volunteers and professionals, who work together to prevent, inform, be with people, and fund cancer research projects to foster better diagnosis and treatment.  

At Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, it offers companionship and support to cancer patients and provides peer volunteers, particularly for women diagnosed with breast cancer. 

The Association is partnered with the UK-based Cancer Research UK, which is the global leader in cancer charities devoted to the research side of the disease. 

World Cancer Research day is partnered with the European Association For Cancer Research, and aims to accomplish the scientific advances that will lead to defeating cancer.

Queen Letizia last wore the stylish suit in March this year as she met with workers from the APRAMP charity which protects sex workers in Spain. 

The goal of the Association for the Prevention, Reintegration and Care of Prostituted Women (APRAMP) is for victims of sexual exploitation and human trafficking to recover their freedom and dignity and autonomy to begin a life outside of sex work. 

She once again teamed her elegant look with matching shoes and a stylish white satin blouse. 

The royal also donned the suit a month earlier, as she attended the Princess of Girona Foundation Awards event in Valencia.
