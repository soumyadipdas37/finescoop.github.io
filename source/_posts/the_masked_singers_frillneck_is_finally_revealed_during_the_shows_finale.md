Frillneck was finally revealed as Eddie Perfect during Monday's finale for The Masked Singer.

The big reveal left the show's judges shocked, with Bushranger and Queen left to battle it out for the winning spot. 

Only judge Urzila Carlson correctly guessed the 42-year-old multi-talented performer, and seemed stunned to have gotten it right.

'It's Eddie Perfect! Urzila, it is Eddie Perfect! Urzila, you got it right!' shouted excitable host Osher Günsberg.
