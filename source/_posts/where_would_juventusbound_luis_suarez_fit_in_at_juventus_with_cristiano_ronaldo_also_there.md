Luis Suarez is reportedly closing in on a move to Juventus this summer for a deal which could cost the Serie A champions just £4.4million. 

The Uruguayan forward is expected to be part of a mass exodus at Barcelona with Juve preparing to pounce on the 33-year-old striker's signature.

He would command a hefty salary though, with some reports claiming he is demanding £22m in severance pay for the Turin move.

Sportsmail looks at where Suarez would fit in at Juventus on the pitch and who he could replace in Andrea Pirlo's squad...

Luis Suarez could join Juventus this summer, so where would he fit in at the Serie A giants?

Where would he fit in?

Certain reports in Italy believe that Pirlo could implement a 3-5-2 formation this season, meaning Suarez could be in for a different role compared to what he has been used to over the years. 

The Uruguayan forward has spent the majority of his top-level career playing in a front three, meaning he could form a mouth-watering two-man partnership with Cristiano Ronaldo in Turin.

A particular boost for Suarez is that he would be more likely to link-up with a wing-back at Juventus when receiving the ball from wide areas, as the 33-year-old has enjoyed a healthy relationship with attacking full-backs over his career.

Out of his 198 goals for Barcelona, 20 were set up by Jordi Alba and 16 were provided by Sergi Roberto. This is more than Steven Gerrard managed to provide for Suarez during his three-and-a-half years at Liverpool, while only Lionel Messi and Neymar set up more goals for Suarez at Barcelona.

However, other reports claim that the 33-year-old will be used in the same 4-3-3 set-up both the player and Juventus have been accustomed to in recent years. 

The tacitcal move would see Suarez adopt a fixed central role either side of Ronaldo and probably promising young winger Dejan Kulusevski.

How would he cope with Ronaldo next to him?

Of course, Suarez would not be the main man at Juventus. That title belongs to Ronaldo - yet the Uruguayan has played the second fiddle role before in his career.

The Barcelona man has been playing alongside Lionel Messi at Barcelona and enjoyed a healthy relationship both on-and-off the pitch with the Argentine.

In fact, Suarez is the most successful strike partner Messi has ever had from a goalscoring perspective in his career.

In 258 matches together, one of Messi or Suarez has assisted the other 96 times, with the Argentine scoring 55 goals from Suarez assists during his career.

It shows that Suarez is still able to make a difference while playing alongside the main attraction - he still managed to become Barcelona's third-highest goalscorer of all-time in just six seasons.

News of Suarez's arrival will therefore come as a huge boost to Ronaldo. While the Portuguese forward netted 37 goals in all competitions last season, it was his second-lowest goal tally in the past decade. 

Ronaldo will have to do well to replicate Suarez's relationship with Messi, however. The Barcelona pair are not only best friends but also neighbours - the Juventus forward will have to do some early groundwork if he wants a similar goalscoring return.

Who would he replace? 

Suarez's arrival in Turin would surely mean some exits in the striking department this summer, mainly to help the financial blow to the wage structure that the Uruguayan's arrival would bring.

Gonzalo Higuain has been strongly linked with a move away from Turin this summer. The Argentine was loaned out to AC Milan and Chelsea by former boss Max Allegri during the 2018-19 season and Pirlo could well show the 32-year-old the door in the coming weeks.

While Higuain is an experienced goalscorer in Serie A, Suarez is certainly an improvement to what is already there in Turin.

The Uruguayan has registered higher goal tallies than Higuain in all but one of the last seven seasons - the only exception coming when Suarez missed a portion of the campaign due to a FIFA ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

Another player who he could replace is Paulo Dybala, who has also been strongly linked with a move away from Juventus this summer.

The forward won the Serie A MVP award for last season, but the Turin club believe they can cash in on Dybala for a premium price this summer, with Pirlo open to losing the current Juventus No 10.

If Dybala does leave the club, then there is certainly a space for Suarez to come in and steal some of the limelight in Serie A.
