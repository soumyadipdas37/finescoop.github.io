Maryland GOP congressional candidate Kim Klacik slammed The View co-host Joy Behar for wearing blackface in a heated interview on the daytime talkshow on Friday.

The conversation had largely remained civil until the end, during which Klacik was replying to a question asked by co-host Sara Haines about President Donald Trump telling journalist Bob Woodward that he had downplayed the seriousness of coronavirus during the pandemic's early days. 

'Come on, Kim. Excuse me, I have to say something to you,' Behar interjected. 

'He told Bob Woodward that it was a very serious issue, and it's airborne and that it was terrible, and then he went out and told the American people: "Don't wear masks. It's all going to go away." You have to put some blame on your president. I'm sorry!'

In turn, Klacik replied: 'Is this Joy speaking? The same Joy that paraded around in blackface not too long ago?'

After Behar said President Donald Trump deserved blame for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Klacik (pictured) replied: 'Is this Joy speaking? The same Joy that paraded around in blackface not too long ago?'

During a taping of The View in 2016, Behar revealed she had dressed as a 'beautiful African woman' for a Halloween party at age 29 (pictured)

In 2016, Behar admitted during a taping of The View that she dressed up as a 'beautiful African woman' for a Halloween party when she was 29 years old.

She said her curly Afro was natural but that she used makeup 'that was a little bit darker than my skin.'

Behar was angered by Klacik's remarks and denied that she ever wore blackface. 

'That's not true. Excuse me, excuse me! The Black community had my back,' Behar replied. 

'They know that that was not blackface. That was an homage.' 

In response, Klacik said: 'The Black community has my back as well.'

Co-host Sunny Hostin then stepped in to defend Behar and mocked Klacik's claims that African-Americans in Baltimore support her.  

'The Black community does not vote for you! The Black community did not vote for you! What planet are you living on?!' Hostin said. 

Klacik attempted to reply to Hostin, but Behar wrapped up the segment and thanked the candidate for her appearance.

Later, Klacik tweeted additional criticism of Behar and her treatment on the show.

'The ladies of @TheView didn't like what I had to say, so naturally they cut me off,' she wrote in a tweet that has been liked more than 26,000 times.

'Why are they silencing Black Women? Hey, @JoyVBehar - I think your White Privilege is showing through your blackface!'

This is not the first time a View guest has called out Behar for wearing blackface. Last year, in November 2019, Donald Trump Jr also attacked the host. 

'We've all done things that we regret. Joy, you have worn blackface,' Trump Jr said during his interview.
