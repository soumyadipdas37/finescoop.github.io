Chloe has been busy filming for TOWIE, and last month, ITV released a trailer ahead of its special 10th anniversary reunion episodes which air in September. 

The hit ITVBe show posted a video to Twitter of key moments from the show's history including when Lauren Goodger pushed ex Mark Wright into a swimming pool.

Other hilarious parts include Sam Faiers asking for a vajazzle and Gemma Collins telling people to 'Google her'.  

TOWIE tweeted: 'SHUT UP! 10 years of #TOWIE!? BRAND NEW episodes coming this September, starting with an anniversary special.

'Things are about to get REEM, You ain't ready for this candy! #TOWIE10 on @ITVBe.'

Although several familiar faces have been lined up to appear on the special, including Chloe's cousin Joey Essex and Danielle Armstrong, main man Mark Wright is said to have 'moved on' and is not planning a comeback reports The Sun.
