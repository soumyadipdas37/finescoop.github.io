Alec Baldwin says he's had to stifle his political aspirations for the good of his marriage to wife Hilaria.

'My wife said she would divorce me if I ran for office,' the 62-year-old star said on Rob Lowe's podcast Literally! this week.

The Academy Award nominee said that he's mulled over running for governor of New York, as other celebs such as Cynthia Nixon and Howard Stern have past done.

The latest: Alec Baldwin, 62, says he's had to stifle his political aspirations for the good of his marriage to wife Hilaria, 36, as he said 'my wife said she would divorce me if I ran for office' on Rob Lowe's podcast Literally! this week 

He said that Hilaria was not agreeable to the commuting he would have to do between New York City and Washington, D.C. if he was elected.

Baldwin, who's won an Emmy for his portrayal of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, said of modern politicians: 'None of them are losing sleep over anything other than their political power and their fundraising.'

The Glengarry Glen Ross star said that he feels contemporary politics use the office as a status symbol: 'Public office as a means of completing themselves.'

Baldwin earlier this month and and his yogi spouse, 36, welcomed a newborn son. They're also parents to daughter Carmen, seven, and sons Rafael, five, Leonardo, four, and Romeo, two, while Alec is also father to model Ireland Baldwin, 24, with ex-wife Kim Basinger.

Lowe, 56, gave his own take on a fondness for bipartisanship in an era where it's been scarce.

'The people that I was always drawn to - the consensus builders and the people who could reach across the aisle, the stories of Tip O'Neill and [Ronald] Reagan battling and cursing each other and then going and having a whiskey and cutting a deal in the cloakrooms - that just doesn't exist anymore,' he said.

Baldwin has past compared Reagan to current former Vice President Joe Biden, who will face off with Trump in November's upcoming presidential election.

'My concern about Biden is - is he our Reagan? Is he the Democratic Ronald Reagan? Older,' he said on The View in February. 'People have been making all kinds of comments about him in terms of his age, and with the Republicans, it didn't matter. 

'They were like, "Ronald Reagan has got six Hollywood anecdotes he could tell. That's good enough for us, let's get him out there."'
