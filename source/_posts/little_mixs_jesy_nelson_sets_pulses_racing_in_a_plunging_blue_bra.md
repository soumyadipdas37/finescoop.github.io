It was recently claimed her new boyfriend Sean Sagan is on celebrity dating app Raya.

But Jesy Nelson brushed the drama aside as she set pulses racing by slipping into a plunging blue lace bra for a sizzling snap she shared via Instagram on Tuesday.

The Little Mix star, 29, looked sensational in the lingerie, while she showed off a glimpse of her underwear by posing with the button on her skirt undone.

Wow! Little Mix's Jesy Nelson set pulses racing in a plunging blue bra and matching underwear in a sizzling snap that was shared via Instagram on Tuesday

Jesy's revealing ensemble showed off her toned abs and slender figure, and she accessorised with a belly-button piercing.

The singer opted to keep her accessories simple so that all attention remained on her ensemble, as the plunging top accentuated her ample assets.

She pulled her brunette locks into a messy bun, and she used a glamorous palette of make-up to highlight her pretty features.

Earlier this month, it was alleged that her hunky new beau is on celebrity dating app Raya.

In a screenshot of his profile obtained by The Sun, Sean's cover image is a shirtless snap and lists his profession as acting and his location as London. 

It is unclear whether Sean's dating app profile is an active profile or an old one from before he started dating the singer.

Raya is a private members-only app where users must be invited and have to link their account to their Instagram page.

Although the service was originally just for dating, features now promote professional networking for those in the entertainment industry. 

A representative for Jesy declined to comment. MailOnline also reached out to Sean's representative.
