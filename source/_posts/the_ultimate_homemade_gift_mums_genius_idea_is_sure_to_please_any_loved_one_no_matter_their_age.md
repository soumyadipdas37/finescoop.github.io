A clever mum has shared a genius homemade gift idea she made to celebrate her husband's first Father's Day.

Jessica made an unfolding gift box that had a selection of confectionery, small gifts and letters stuck to the sides. 

Posting the idea to an Australian Facebook group, Jessica said she's 'guilty' of having too many Kmart delivery boxes lying around the house, so she decided to use them for her creative homemade project.

Jessica wrote 'happy first Father's Day' on the four sides of the box which can be read as the gift is opened and disassembled walls fall to the floor.

The present is a fantastic alternative idea to give to someone of any age and is a great way to give a personalised gift.

'I got this great gift idea from this group! My hubby's first Father's Day,' she said on Facebook.

'I may need some more boxes for future gifts (well that's my excuse anyway), back to online shopping.'

On each wall of the boxes, Jessica stuck Ferrero Rocher chocolates, Lindt, Skittles packets, m&m packets, Snickers, $50 cash, new phone chargers and assorted other gifts inside.

In the centre of the box was a personalised card that read 'Jada loves daddy this much' and had a photo at the bottom of a child with their arms wide open.
