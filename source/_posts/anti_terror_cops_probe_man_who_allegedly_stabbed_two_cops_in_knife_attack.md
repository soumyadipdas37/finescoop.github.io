Anti-terror police are probing a man accused of trying to murder officers and muttering 'Allahu Akhbar' under his breath after the alleged attack. 

Frederick Fadi Elrezz, from Lakemba in Sydney's south west, was arrested and charged with attempted murder at about 12.20am on Wednesday.

He is accused of attacking two officers with a knife and biting a third on York Street in the Sydney CBD.

Soon after, Elrezz allegedly told officers: 'I wanted to kill a cop in the name of Allah', The Australian reported.

He also allegedly said 'Allahu Akhbar' during his subsequent interview.

There is nothing in the 32-year-old's history that indicates he supports extremist agendas or that he has been radicalised.

But anti-terror teams will investigate his background to assess any potential links to terror organisations.   

A policeman (pictured), 40, was allegedly slashed in the head and shoulder by a Lakemba man, 32, on York Street in the Sydney CBD at 12:20am on Wednesday 

'It is routine in something like this,' a police source told The Daily Telegraph.   

'But there is no affiliation with terror groups or any evidence he is even religious.'

When police collected Elrezz's belongings from the York St hostel where he'd spent the last 10 days, they didn't find anything which linked him to terrorism.

But police allege he may have some ideological beliefs.

Multiple search warrants were executed across several addresses following his arrest, and several items have been seized.

But senior officials have stopped short of calling the incident terror-related, pending inquiries into Elrezz's history. 

Detectives are also investigating whether Elrezz had any mental health conditions which may have led to the alleged attack.

Police were called after the 32-year-old allegedly harassed a food delivery rider on George Street, which is one of the busiest streets in the city centre. 

Officers then approached the man as he was walking along the nearby York Street, which is when he allegedly pulled out a knife and started attacking them.  

One of the officers was left with blood gushing from his head and shoulder after arriving on the scene.   

The injured officers were also taken to St Vincent's Hospital, where the 40-year-old officer (pictured)underwent treatment for lacerations on the left side of his head and another on his upper arm and shoulder area

A male senior constable, 40, was slashed across his head and shoulder while his male acting sergeant, 39, was slashed on the hand. 

Meanwhile, a male probationary constable, 20, was bitten on his tricep. 

The 32-year-old man was then disarmed and arrested, before being taken to St Vincent's Hospital for assessment. 

Pictures from after the attack show blood pouring from the senior constable's head, covering most of his face.  

A bite mark and blood can also be seen on the youngest officer's tricep. 

The injured officers were also taken to St Vincent's Hospital, where the 40-year-old officer underwent treatment for lacerations on the left side of his head and another on his upper arm and shoulder.  

Meanwhile, the 39-year-old was treated for a laceration to his finger and a knee injury and the youngest officer was treated for his bite.

Assistant Commissioner Michael Willing said the men were 'lucky to be alive' following the alleged attack.   

'It appears to have happened in a flash with the bodycam vision quite confronting and we allege showing the man pulling a knife on the officers,' he said.

The alleged attacker was taken to Day Street Police Station following his discharge from hospital. 

He has now been charged with cause wounding/grievous bodily harm to person with intent to murder, wound person with intent to resist/prevent arrest, assault police officer in execution of duty cause actual bodily harm and resist or hinder police officer in the execution of duty.

The man has been refused bail to appear at Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday. 

The officers' body cam vision and audio is also being reviewed.
