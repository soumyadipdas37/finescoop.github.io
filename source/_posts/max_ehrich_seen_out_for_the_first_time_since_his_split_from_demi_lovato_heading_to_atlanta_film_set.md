It's back to work for this former loverboy.

Max Ehrich was seen in public for the first time on Friday since his engagement to singer Demi Lovato was called off.

The actor, 29, was spotted heading to the set of his latest film Southern Gospel in Atlanta, Georgia, a shoot that he has been meticulously documenting on his Instagram of late, instead of his previous posts which were almost exclusively devoted to his now former flame.

The Young And The Restless star sported a new trimmed haircut, and a bloody bruise on his forehead that was presumably movie makeup.

Max sported reflective blue aviator sunglasses, as well as a face shield that rested on his chest.

He donned a crisp white t-shirt and jeans, along with brown leather cowboy boots and a matching belt.

The sighting comes just one day after news broke Thursday of Ehrich's breakup with Lovato, 28, whom he was dating for just six months.

The pair also were planning on getting married, and even perhaps eloping, after getting engaged in July.

In the short time since news of their split has gone public, both parties have subtly 'commented' on the matter on their respective social media accounts, with Demi wearing a cheeky shirt on her IG Story that said 'Dogs over people' and Max simply posting the message, 'Jesus Loves You'.

In Demi's clip, her engagement ring is markedly absent.

The couple have called time on their relationship after facing rumors earlier this month that Max at one point sent 'thirsty messages' to Demi's former BFF Selena Gomez, back in 2015.

'It was a tough decision, but Demi and Max have decided to go their separate ways to focus on their respective careers,' a source told PEOPLE.

'They have respect and love for one another and will always cherish the time they spent together.'

It has been reported that Demi had growing concerns over Max and started to believe he proposed for 'attention', after ignoring 'many red flags' in order to be with him.

One source said: 'She didn't know who Max truly was and didn't think he had good intentions... There were many red flags she was ignoring and trying to turn a blind eye to.'

Whilst another insider added: 'She doesn't trust him and thinks he's sketchy ... She feels he proposed to get attention.'

A third source explained: 'Things started going downhill [when he said he was flying out to Atlanta for work]. They were arguing a lot and Demi didn't want him to go without her... There has been a lot of tension and Demi left him to get a clear head.'

However, Demi is said to be 'distraught' over the split.

A source told E! News: 'She really loved him and wanted it to work. Demi is really upset and distraught about it.'

Demi and Max had a whirlwind romance, which started in March just before the coronavirus pandemic began.

Sources at the time revealed that they had decided to quarantine together at Demi's house amid the lockdown.
