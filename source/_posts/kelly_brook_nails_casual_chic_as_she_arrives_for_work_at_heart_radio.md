The media personality has been candid about her weight fluctuating, with the bombshell slimming down to a size 10-12 after going to a size 16.

On her current figure, she told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks.

'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.

'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'
