Mexican military and border agents rescued two pregnant Haitian women who fell ill trying to cross the Mexico-United States border.

Mexico's National Institute of Migration said in a statement Monday that agents were alerted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol about a group of individuals who were trying to unlawfully cross into California through Tecate, Baja California. 

The 11 migrants and the U.S. citizen were in the municipality of San Pablo, several yards from making it into the United States when the two women fell ill during the dangerous hike through the mountainous town of La Rumorosa.

The National Institute of Migration said that both women were at least seven months pregnant and that one of them required emergency treatment after Red Cross paramedics noticed she was bleeding. 

Both individuals were rushed to Tecate General Hospital where they received care. The second pregnant woman was treated for dehydration and exhaustion. 

The migrants were part of four families, which included six adults and five children,  were from Haiti, Honduras and Mexico. 

It's unknown why the U.S. citizen was accompanying the group of migrants.
