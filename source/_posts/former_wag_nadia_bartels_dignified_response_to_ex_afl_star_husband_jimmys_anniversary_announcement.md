AFL star Jimmy Bartel began a new relationship shortly after announcing his separation from ex-wife Nadia in August last year.

And the former WAG appeared to have a dignified response to Jimmy's anniversary announcement with girlfriend Lauren Mand on Monday.

While both Jimmy, 36, and Lauren, 31, openly celebrated one year together, Nadia chose to share a simple message to her fans.

Nadia and Jimmy Bartel announced their separation on August 15, 2019, but they are believed to have actually split two months prior. 

'This was July. My hair was so much shorter and I loved my outfit...ain’t a lot has happened since,' Nadia joked in her caption.

The mother-of-two, 35, doesn't follow either Jimmy or Lauren on social media, but it's likely she would have seen aware of the anniversary posts shared this week.

Taking to Instagram on Monday, Lauren shared an image of herself and Jimmy as 'Simpsons' characters.    

'Three hundred and sixty five days. Thanks for the artwork, it's going straight to the pool room,' she wrote in tribute to the Cats legend. 

In the images, Lauren and Jimmy had been 'turned yellow' into cartoon characters, cuddling up on the iconic Simpson's couch in matching tracksuits.

Over on Jimmy's Instagram, he also wished the blonde socialite a happy one year after being together. 

'One year with you,' he wrote, sharing the same image.

Last month, Lauren teased that the pair could be getting engaged after writing she had 'big news' after spending time with Jimmy in lockdown.

While her post certainly sounded like a personal announcement, she was actually celebrating her younger sister's engagement. 

She subsequently shared a photo of her sister posing with her new fiancé below a balloon shaped like a diamond ring.

Jimmy and Lauren were first pictured as a couple in August 2019.
