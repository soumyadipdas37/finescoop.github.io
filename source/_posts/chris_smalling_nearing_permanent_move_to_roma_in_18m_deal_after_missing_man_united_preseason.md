Chris Smalling has been absent from Manchester United's pre-season training to discuss terms with Serie A side Roma.

The former England international is wanted on a permanent basis by Roma, having impressed during a season long loan spell with the club - making 37 league appearances and scoring three goals along with two assists.

Smalling, who is valued at around £15-£20million by Roma, missed sessions at Carrington on Tuesday and Wednesday as he looks to depart from the club he joined over 10 years ago.

As it stands, Smalling still has two years left on his £130,000-a-week deal but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made it clear the he will play no role in his future plans.

Having achieved 300 senior appearances since Sir Alex Ferguson signed him from Fulham for £10m, Smalling was pushed out of the squad following the arrival of Harry Maguire. 

Manchester United were open to selling Smalling last summer as his departure from Old Trafford would help ease the pressure on the club's wage bill.   

Solskjaer even said last season that he was pleased that the move to Roma had worked out for Smalling. 'He couldn't be here without being a regular and we decided on that and I'm so, so happy for him, because we can see the top player that he is.'

However, United have since pumped the breaks on a potential deal in order to keep their centre-back options open.

As it stands, Solskjaer is looking to bolster his defensive line this summer to tighten the ranks ahead of next season.

After rejuvenating his career during a successful loan spell in Rome season, Smalling is be keen to remain with the Serie A side on a permanent basis. 

The 30-year-old was unfortunate to miss out on playing in the latter stages of the Europa League after the coronavirus lockdown but hopes to feature on the European stage for Roma in the future.    

In addition, it is also believed that the defender and his family have settled into life well in the Italian capital and wish to make it their home.
