They are both models and mix in the same London social circuit. 

And Lottie Moss gave her pal Roxy Horner's beau Jack Whitehall her full support as she attended his London restaurant residency on Friday evening.

Lottie kept her look edgy by styling her bright blonde locks in bunches and accessorising with a silver chain choker necklace for the occasion.

She boosted her statuesque frame with a pair of barely-there strappy heels and accentuated her pretty features with a glamorous coat of make-up.

Meanwhile, her pal Roxy, 29, looked equally glam in a nude corset-style top which she wore with a white jacket draped over her shoulders.

The model wore her golden locks in loose waves and opted for a dewy pallet of make-up including a slick of lipstick to complete the look.

The duo were in attendance at Jack's exclusive FoodS**t menu in collaboration with Provisioners at the Dixon Hotel, Tower Bridge.

The socially-distanced launch event was also attended by Laura Whitmore, 35, and the Came Here for Love hitmaker Ella Eyre, 26. 

Songstress Ella put on a playful display as she posed with an onion ring over her eye and pouted for the camera over the dinner table.

Jack runs the Instagram food blog with his brother Barney and actor Marcus Petty-Saphon and has garnered more than 84,000 followers. 

The menu featured an array of decadent dishes including Nashville hot chicken wings along with the iconic 'S****y Burger' featuring dry aged beef and crispy onions.

And on the first night of the new Government curfew, all guests were out of the restaurant by 10pm and in their suites at The Dixon.
