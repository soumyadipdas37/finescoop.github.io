Sylvester Stallone's mother Jackie has passed away at the age of 98.

Though the circumstances surrounding the famed astrologer's death remain unknown, sources close to the Stallone family told TMZ that she just 'recently passed away.'

Jackie leaves behind Sylvester, 74, as well as son Frank, 70, whom she shared with late ex husband Frank Stallone Sr. 

She is also mother to late actress Toni D'Alto, who passed away at the age of 48 after a lengthy cancer battle in 2012.
