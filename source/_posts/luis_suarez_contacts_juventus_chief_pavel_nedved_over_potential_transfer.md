According to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, Suarez and Nedved have began talks over a potential switch that would see him join the Serie A champions.

The early signs appear to be positive and it is very possible that Ronaldo will have a new strike partner in Luis Suarez.

In their prime, Suarez had a partnership with Lionel Messi and Neymar for the Catalan club whilst Ronaldo led the line alongside Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale at Madrid.

The Uruguayan is happy to take his time over a deal and is waiting to see all his options, whilst the Italian side are more eager to get a transfer over the line with the new season fast approaching.

Juventus have also been eyeing up Roma striker Edin Dzeko, but they will not let him leave unless they have a replacement lined up.

Suarez did turn up to Barcelona headquarters for covid-19 testing ahead of the new campaign, despite his exit talks with Koeman leaving him furious.

Lionel Messi did not turn up for testing, as his potential exit has shocked the footballing world following Koeman's appointment and a poor season last time out.
