John Gosden is looking to use a French jockey on Stradivarius in the Prix de L’Arc De Triomphe at Longchamp on October 4 with Covid-19 quarantine arrangements meaning few British-based jockeys will cross the Channel to ride in Paris.

An eight-day isolation period for jockeys returning from France — an elite athlete arrangement — means jockeys who ride at Longchamp would have to miss the Future Champions meeting at Newmarket featuring the Fillies’ Mile and Dewhurst Stakes, both Group One prizes, the following week.

That has ruled out Andrea Atzeni, who has a perfect three from three record on Stradivarius, because of his retainer to owner Sheik Mohammed Obaid, who has Zabeel Queen entered in the Fillies’ Mile.

Gosden said: ‘It is most likely it will be a French jockey because if it is a British one they then can’t ride in the big races at Newmarket. We will look it through with (owner) Bjorn Nielsen.’

Frankie Dettori, who rides Gosden’s dual Arc winner Enable in the race, has ridden Stradivarius in 17 of his 26 races.

Gosden used four-time French champion jockey Ioritz Mendizabal when Mishriff won the French Derby in July and has also used vastly-experienced Olivier Peslier in the past.

Meanwhile, eight-time Arc winning trainer Andre Fabre has confirmed Persian King, winner of the one-mile Prix Du Moulin on his latest run, will take his chance in the half-mile longer Arc.
