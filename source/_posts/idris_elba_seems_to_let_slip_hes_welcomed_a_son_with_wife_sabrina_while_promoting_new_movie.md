And now it seems that Idris Elba has become a father for the third time, too.

Elba has a daughter Isan, 18, from his first marriage and a son Winston, six, from a previous relationship.

Neither he nor third wife Sabrina Dhowre have confirmed a pregnancy nor the arrival of a child. 

The actor, 48, and the Somali-Canadian model, 30, started dating in 2017 and tied the knot in Marrakesh on April 26 last year. 

DailyMail.com has reached out to Elba's representatives for comment.

Daddy's girl: Elba also has a daughter Isan, 18, from his first marriage to Hanne 'Kim' Nørgaard, which ended in 2003

In Concrete Cowboy, Elba plays the father of a troubled teen in North Philadelphia.

The two are estranged but the teen, played by Caleb McLaughlin from Stranger Things, is torn between rebelling and pursuing a life of crime and his father's lifestyle as an 'urban cowboy,' who rides horses around the inner city neighborhood.

Elba revealed that he had faced some challenges in portraying his character, revealing at the virtual press conference: 'I'm allergic to horses, OK. I couldn't see what I was doing, I couldn't breathe.'

He added: 'It goes beyond just learning how to ride a horse. Very quickly, you have to have a bond with the horse.... They quickly understand who's riding on the back of them. And then you have to understand them.' 

The drama, written and directed by Ricky Staub, is based on the real-life Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club, an inner-city horse stable in Philly that helps at-risk youth turn their lives around, according to THR.com.

The film is produced by Lee Daniels and has its world premiere in Toronto on Sunday night.
