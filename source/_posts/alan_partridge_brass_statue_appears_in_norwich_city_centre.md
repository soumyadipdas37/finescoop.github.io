An enormous golden statue of Alan Partridge has appeared in the middle of Norwich city centre. 

Fans and self-employed sculptors Nick Dutton and Gavin Fulcher were behind the 11ft statue, which appeared outside The Forum, where it will remain until Sunday, the BBC reported.

Alan Partridge is a character who was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and portrayed by actor Steve Coogan.

The Twitter account for the Bafta award-winning character shared its approval for the statue. 

The thread of tweets said: 'A STATEMENT. Although this is completely unauthorised, having taken counsel, I am happy that the statue's attitude and stance are correct.

'If the people of Norwich and surrounding areas want to memorialise me in sculpture, then as long as it is rendered in alpha brass with a low zinc content and not, say, a duplex brass, I grant my consent and will instruct my legal team to resheathe their daggers. 

'If my statue can in some way act as an Ambassador for Brass, and encourage just ten children to take up a brass instrument, it will be an upbeat ending to an otherwise dreadful year.'

Mr Fulcher said Alan Partridge was synonymous with the city and that people instantly mention the character when someone says they're from Norwich. 

He said the statue was 'just a bit of fun' and said 'during this time we could all do with a bit of light relief'. 

The pair designed the statue based on measurements taken from a friend who was a 'similar size and build' to Coogan, who is 5ft 9in. 

The brass statue was created and designed over three years by the pair, in between their work commitments in the film industry. 

Alan Partridge made his debut appearance in 1991 as a sports presenter on BBC Radio 4's On The Hour and Coogan announced this year he would play the character again in an 18-part series called From The Oasthouse: The Alan Partridge Podcast. 

Mr Dutton and Mr Fulcher denied the statue was a publicity stunt to promote Partridge's latest podcast.
