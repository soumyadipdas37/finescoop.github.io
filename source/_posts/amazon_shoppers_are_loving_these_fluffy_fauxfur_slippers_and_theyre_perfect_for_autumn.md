From buttery-soft leggings to cosy knits and sherpa blankets, Amazon shoppers have been stocking up on soft and cosy items to lounge around the house in.

Faux-fur fluffy slippers are an essential in the colder months, and shoppers can't seem to get enough of these Miya Fluffy Faux Fur House Slippers. 

Now only £16.14 on Amazon, the Miya slippers are being snapped up by customers who describe the slip-on style as 'super soft and super luxurious' and 'absolutely gorgeous', as well as noting the inexpensive price tag. 

The Miya Fluffy Faux Fur House Slippers are now reduced to just £16.14 on Amazon and are exactly what we want on our feet this autumn 

Hundreds of Amazon shoppers have picked up a pair of the plush faux fur slippers. They come in six colours including cream, grey, pink and black, so whatever the hue of your loungewear wardrobe, you'll be sure to find a perfect pair. 

'Super soft and super luxurious,' raved one shopper. 'These slippers are like walking on clouds!! I know it sounds cliche but they are so comfortable. 

'I've always bought cheaper slippers and never had a problem but wanted to treat myself now we are all staying home a lot more and it was honestly so so worth it.'

Another customer also likened the slippers to walking on a cloud, writing: 'I love these! They are really comfortable, pretty cute and surprisingly warm. I love wearing them around the house. 

'They are not something you will be able to run in but who wants to do that when you're walking on a cloud. I would buy them as a gift too, they're great especially with all the time spent at home at the moment.'

The slippers have been designed with soft fluffy faux fur on the outside and the inside, along with added memory foam for supreme comfort 

The slippers have been designed with faux fur on the outside and the inside making them supremely comfortable. Plus, they sport an open toe which means your feet won't become uncomfortably hot and sweaty. 

Unlike slippers of the same low price tag, the Miya Fluffy Faux Fur House Slippers have been made with added memory foam cushioned insoles which mould to the contours of your feet for pillow-soft comfort.

Hundreds of shoppers have left compliments about the slippers' comfort, with one customer writing: 'These slippers are so soft and comfy, feels like a blanket wrapped around them.' 

Another added: 'These are AMAZING! They were delivered next day with prime. They are so soft. I was expecting them to not be as fluffy as the picture but they are BETTER! I’m so happy. I bought the darker red/burgundy colour to be a bit extra and ugh I’m in love.'
