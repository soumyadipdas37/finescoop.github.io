He dumped Bella Varelis for Irena Srbinovska in the gut-wrenching Bachelor grand finale on Thursday.

Hitting back: Defiant Bachelor star Locky Gilbert hit back at critics this week and called one follower a 'Karen' after they slammed him and the show after the gut-wrenching finale

'I've concluded, I think you are, perhaps a very good actor and some of the girls, perhaps good actresses,' they said. 

'It's sad to me this show and some of the people in it have not acted authentically... why? For ratings, fame, notoriety? All the best in such a disingenuous world,' they added. 

Locky hit back, writing: 'Haha ok Karen.'

Karen' has become a popular term to refer to someone who is being snobby or self-important.

It originated from a meme featuring a middle-aged woman with an asymmetrical bob haircut who was demanding to speak to a store manager.

Another follower accused Locky of already being 'bored' of his relationship with Irena and said that Bella 'dodged a big bogan bullet.'

Locky replied, writing: 'Haha but you are the one invested in my life so much. You need a hobby.'

One critic lashed out saying that the show was 'terrible' and that it 'goes against everything Australia is trying to improve, respect towards women,' when Locky clapped back.

'But still you watch it and follow my adventure. I'll just set up my camping chair in your head and settle in,' he wrote.

Upon hearing the news, Bella looked at Locky - who had declared his love for her a day earlier - in utter disbelief. 

'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me,' she said in shock.  

After he responded by saying he was in love with her, Bella added: 'Well, why not follow through with a relationship, then?'

He went on: 'Because I asked you in the pool, "What do you see our next year looking like?" And you were so... I needed a little bit more.'

Furiously, she responded: 'You can't turn this around on me.'

She then stormed off, stating: 'My God... Can I leave. I'm going.'
