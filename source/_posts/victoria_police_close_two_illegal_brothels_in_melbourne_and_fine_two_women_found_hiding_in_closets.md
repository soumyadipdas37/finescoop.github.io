Two Melbourne brothels have been shut down by police for allegedly operating illegally - with two people arrested and five women fined for breaking coronavirus restrictions.

Victoria Police searched the properties in the southeastern suburbs of Ormond and Clayton on September 4.

'The warrants were executed as part of an investigation into contraventions of the Sex Work Act,' Victoria Police said in a statement.

A 41-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman were arrested during the raids.

They had since been released from custody but were expected to be charged by summons with operating unlicensed brothels from residential properties.

Three women were also found at the Ormond property, while another two were at the Clayton home.

Two of the women were found hiding in closets.

Each of the women were fined $1,652 for being in breach of Chief Health Officer's coronavirus restrictions.

Under the current COVID-19 regulations in Metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire, which are under stage-four restrictions, a person who owns, controls or operates a brothel must not operate. 

Melburnians are only allowed to leave their home for four essential reasons - work and study, to procure items such as groceries, exercise or care - and must stay within 5km of their home.

Brothels are legal in Victoria, however they must be a registered business with the Business Licensing Authority.

Mobile phones and computers were also seized from the two addresses.

Police have been targeting the operation of illegal brothels at residential homes since August 28.

There have been 14 fines issued in that time.
