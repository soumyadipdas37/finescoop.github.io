She's famed for her winning smile and bubbly personality. 

And Kelly Brook was a ray of sunshine as she headed to present her drivetime Heart Radio show at London's Global Studios on Monday. 

Embracing the surprise heatwave, the 40-year-old presenter donned a pretty pastel summer dress.

Featuring a ruched bust and milkmaid sleeves, the colourful midi clung to her ample chest and skimmed out to a calf length hem. 

Kelly teamed the garment with a pair of fresh white trainers, and added more colour with a stack of vibrant bangles. 

She completed the look with small gold hooped earrings and wearing her glossy brunette tresses loose and tousled.

Kelly's outing comes after she admitted she's 'not worried' about her 'weight creeping up'. 

She also declared 'diets shouldn't be about deprivation', after revealing she shed a whopping two stone in March.

While she has been keeping busy by exercising at home, her diet consists of 'healthy, low-calorie meals' with sweet treats such as popcorn and homemade fruit lollies.

The brunette has been candid about her weight fluctuating, with the bombshell slimming down to a size 10-12 after going to a size 16.

On her current figure, she told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks.

'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.

'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'
