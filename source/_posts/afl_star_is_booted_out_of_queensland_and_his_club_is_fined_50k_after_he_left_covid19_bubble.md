AFL star Harley Bennell has been ordered to leave Queensland after breaching the league's COVID-19 return to play protocols.   

The Melbourne Demons player left his club's bubble in Maroochydore on Saturday and visited 'unapproved premises', the league confirmed on Sunday.

Bennell, 27, was suspended for four games, to be served in 2021, while the Demons were fined $50,000. 

Melbourne CEO Gary Pert said Bennell's actions were selfish and a 'clear breach' of the AFL's COVID-19 protocols.

'He has made a very poor decision, which is incredibly disappointing,' Pert said.

'He has not only put himself, his teammates and the competition at risk, but he has failed to live up to the values of the Melbourne Football Club.'

Pert apologised for the midfielder's behaviour and said the club accepted the $50,000 fine. 

Upon learning of a potential breach, the Demons immediately notified the AFL, which investigated the matter. 

AFL General Counsel Andrew Dillon said the AFL's protocols are the competition's license to play and anyone breaching them will be held to account.

'Harley knew the rules and could have put his club and the competition at risk on the eve of a finals campaign,' Dillon said.

Bennell wasn't allowed back into the player bubble after the breach and will remain in isolation until he can leave Queensland. 

It was the Melbourne Demons second COVID-19 breach this year after forwards Kysaiah 'Kozzy' Pickett and Charlie Spargo used an Uber to visit a social gathering in June.

Meanwhile, two senior players came under fire on Saturday after television cameras caught them groping each other's buttocks during a team huddle.  

Christian Petracca and Jayden Hunt apologised for the incident before Demons captain Max Gawn condemned the pair's behaviour. 

'As AFL players, we are role models and have a responsibility to showcase the right behaviours to the wider AFL community,' Gawn said.

'Christian and Jayden know that this was an inappropriate act, which is not in line with our expectations, or that of the league.

'As a playing group, we understand and respect the example we need to be setting, and will continue to reinforce this going forward.'
