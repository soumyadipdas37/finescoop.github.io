Simon Cowell is expected to return for the America's Got Talent finale next week just six weeks after he broke his back in a horrific electric bike accident. 

Heidi Klum, 47, divulged that the music mogul is keen to make an appearance during the finale, which will take place in Los Angeles on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

The judge said that the talent show mastermind, 60, planned to come back before the season's end, but insisted his return was being kept a secret.

Comeback? Simon Cowell is expected to return to America's Got Talent just six weeks after his horrific motorbike crash as his fellow judge, Heidi Klum, revealed on Friday

Heidi revealed to The Mirror: 'He is going to come to the finale, but do not tell anyone.'

Their co-star Howie Mandel also has an inkling that Simon will return to the show, but it is unclear if they expect his return to be via video link or in the flesh.

Howie added: 'I would not count out seeing Simon again before this season's end.' 

On the mend: According to the model, 47, the AGT mogul, 60, is recovering from his broken back and is poised for a return to next week's finals in Los Angeles on Tuesday and Wednesday

Simon reportedly came within 'one-centimetre of being paralysed' when he fell from his electric bicycle and broke his back in multiple places.

The entertainment mogul was rushed to hospital at the beginning of August when he fell from his new vehicle whilst taking it for a test drive at his house in Malibu. 

He was at home with his partner Lauren Silverman, 43, their son, Eric, six, and his stepson Adam, 14, at the time of the incident.                              

Speaking just days after the accident, a family friend told MailOnline that the father-of-one was 'doing well', but was in ‘shock and massive amounts of pain'. 

Heidi revealed to The Mirror: 'He is going to come to the finale, but do not tell anyone,' while co-star Howie Mandel said: 'I would not count out seeing Simon again before this season's end'

They said: ’He’s in recovery and asleep. Lauren went with him to the hospital and has been allowed in briefly to see him. He’s doing OK in the circumstances.

‘He was in shock and in massive amounts of pain. He was outside in the courtyard in Malibu with Eric and Adam trying this new bike'  

They added: ‘Simon’s had to have a big surgery, he’s got a number of breaks and has had to have a metal rod put into his back.'

‘When he fell off the bike he landed right on his back which broke in a number of places. It was six hour surgery overnight on Saturday.’ 

Near miss! Simon had surgery after breaking his back in a number of places and came within 'one-centimetre of being paralysed' when he fell from his electric bicycle in August
