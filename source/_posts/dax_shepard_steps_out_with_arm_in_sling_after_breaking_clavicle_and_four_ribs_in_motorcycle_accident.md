Dax Shepard was spotted with his left arm in a sling as he was glimpsed out in Los Angeles this Tuesday.

The dashing 45-year-old stuck to a California casual ensemble of a grey tank top and a pair of camouflage shorts.

His latest outing marks his first public sighting since splintering his clavicle and breaking a staggering four ribs as well as a pinky in a motorcycle crash last month.

Tuesday was a big day for Dax as he also celebrated the 15th anniversary of the day he decided to give up drugs and alcohol.

His wife Kristen Bell posted a heartwarming Instagram snap of a note from one of their daughters reading: 'Happy Sobriety Birthday Dady.'

He and Kristen have been married since 2013 and are the proud parents of two daughters - Lincoln, seven, and Delta, five. 

The little girl also included a drawling of Ron Weasley from the Harry Potter books near a heart balloon, addressed 'To Mama Daddy.'

'Today is my husband's 15th sobriety birthday. My daughter woke him up with this sign, and a sketch of the one and only Ronald Weasley(absolutely random, and also perfect). Happy birthday Daxy,' wrote Kristen.

'Thank you for dedicating your life to the hard and wonderful work of sobriety, so that you could share it with you. Xo K, L & D.'

'It’s so weird when you turn 18 and are released into the world and then just start piling on terrible habits. From 18 to 29 I was a heavy smoker, heavy drinker, drug addict, terrible eater and philanderer,' he dished to Playboy in 2012.

'I just loved to get f***ed-up drinking, cocaine, opiates, marijuana, diet pills, pain pills, everything. Mostly my love was Jack Daniel’s and cocaine,' said Dax.

Self-care: Kristen and Dax recently appeared in an Instagram interview cuddling up to their dog while wearing cosmetic face masks

'I was famous for going out on Thursday night to have a couple of beers, and that just led all the way to Saturday night. I would meet people here and there, and then I’d be in a hotel room with four strangers.'

He shared: 'My nose is completely sideways from a drunken altercation. I’m missing a knuckle because of a drunken altercation.'

Because Kristen is 'a good girl,' when she started dating Dax 'All the things I’d done were terrifying to her, and she had a hard time believing I would ever be able to stay married and monogamous and a father and all those things. For the first year and a half we were together that was what we battled over almost weekly.'

'Safe and sound': Dax had his accident this August at a racetrack and had to have surgery but a week after the crash Kristen welcomed him home from the hospital

Dax had his accident this August at a racetrack and had to have surgery but a week after the crash Kristen welcomed him home from the hospital. 

The Frozen blonde shared on Instagram: 'for those asking, he was in an accident last friday and shattered his shoulder, broke his pinky and 4 ribs.' 

Kristen posted her selfie with Dax relaxing on his La-Z-Boy alongside an X-Ray picture of the affected area as shown on an laptop.

Dax said on his Armchair Expert podcast recently that he had been 'actively doing something dangerous' and was therefore 'totally at blame' in the accident.

'I was passing six guys on Sonoma Raceway on a motorcycle and I was braking very, very hard - hard enough that the back wheel was off the ground for a good 100 yards,' said the Zathura: A Space Adventure star.

He confessed that he 'might' give up riding his motorcycle 'for the remainder of 2020' after sustaining his injuries.
