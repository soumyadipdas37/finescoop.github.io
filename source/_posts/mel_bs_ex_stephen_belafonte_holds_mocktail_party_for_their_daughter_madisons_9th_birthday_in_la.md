They're locked in a bitter custody battle over their daughter. 

And on Saturday, Melanie Brown's ex Stephen Belafonte, 45, doted on their daughter Madison as he held a girly mocktail party for her 9th birthday at the Sugar Factory in LA, California.

The youngster - who spent lockdown with her father - celebrated with her friends, who joined together to dunk Stephen's face in a huge bowl of ice cream.

Mel B's daughter looked delighted as she shared a table of colourful treats with her pals, and looked amazed as the waitress made her drink smoke, while Stephen recorded the magic on his phone. 

Wearing a mint green floral dress and a pink 'Birthday Girl' sash, Maddie looked adorable for her special day and was surprised when a huge bowl of ice cream was brought to the table.

Maddie kissed her dad as a sign of gratitude, before removing her gem-encrusted tiara so he and her friends could dunk her face in the bowl.

She happily returned the favour, covering Stephen's face in the sticky dessert as she and her pals pushed his face into the dish.

The producer shares custody of little Maddie with Spice Girl ex-wife Mel B – who has now quit Los Angeles and relocated to her childhood home of Leeds. 

It's thought that Mel, 44, hasn't seen Madison since her daughter visited her in Yorkshire in December, before they were separated by the pandemic.  

Taking to Instagram in April, Stephen shared a snap of him cuddling his daughter, captioning the post: 'I know that this coronavirus has brought a lot of unneeded emotional, financial, and physical stress into all of our lives...

'But I think the thing to do with these trying times is really focus on the things that can be a blessing in disguise like me getting to be able to quarantine with the love of my life, my little Maddie!

'What blessings have come out of this horrible event for you? #quarantine #stayfocused #stayhealthy #timetorecharge #priorities.' 

Mel is now living in the UK after being reunited with her mother Andrea following her split from husband Stephen in 2017, ten years after they exchanged vows. 

In December she wrote about the pain of sending her daughter back to Los Angeles after she visited her new home in Leeds for a week, and shared an image of a handwritten letter from Madison on Instagram.

The message, written in red crayon, said her mum was 'loving', 'funny' and 'beautiful' and she misses her when they are apart.

Alongside the image of the note, Mel reflected on the December week with her daughter and how her 'abusive ex' is keeping them apart.

She wrote: 'This time last week I walked around winter wonderland with my 3 kids having the best Xmas fun ever, my youngest Madison with me for 7 amazing days,she wrote me this on the plane going back to LA,as I read this over and over again the pain I feel is unbearable.  

'I don't no when me or her sisters are gonna see her again, my abuser STILL manages to abuse me threw the courts and on a daily basis threw a 'court appointed' email that allows him access to me for him to say whenever whatever he wants.

'I share this because I no other mothers are going threw exactly the same thing right now, just no your not alone I feel your pain,and I won't stop talking and fighting to get justice for us all and our kids.

'#stopabuse #yournotalone #talktosomeonetoday @womens_aid please be kind to people like me in these situation as you have no idea what me/they are going threw.' [sic]

The upload came after Mel said she's been struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder her marriage broke down in 2016.

Angel – Mel's 13-year old daughter with Hollywood legend Eddie Murphy – also shared a snap of Mel cuddling sister Madison on a train Instagram and wrote: 'No child should be separated from their mother. No child should be separated from their sisters.

'No child should be torn away from family. No child should lie about how they feel. No child should be denied communication to their family consistently.'

Mel and Stephen divorced the following year and spent months battling it out in a nasty court fight before finally reaching a settlement.  

The estranged former couple currently share joint custody of Madison following their acrimonious divorce in late 2017.

In addition to Madison, Mel B is mom to daughters Phoenix, 21, whose father is her first husband Jimmy Gulzar, and Angel, 13, whose father is Hollywood star Eddie Murphy.
