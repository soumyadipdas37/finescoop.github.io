Daniel Andrews has cracked it with an ABC journalist who dared to question the motives behind his extended daily press conference briefings since Victoria's second COVID-19 wave paralysed the state. 

After 62 consecutive days for press conferences, which regularly last longer than 1.5-hours, the Labor Premier lost his cool after being quizzed by acclaimed ABC journalist Rafael Epstein on whether his daily addresses was a way of 'sidelining' the mainstream media and speaking directly to the electorate. 

'Do you think this press conference makes the mainstream media less relevant to your political fortunes because you've got more direct communication?' Mr Epstein asked.

The 'direct line of questioning' prompted laughter and mutterings from other journalists in the room. 

A peeved Mr Andrews hit back by saying he 'values' his hour-and-a-half with the 'mainstream media.'  Mr Andrews is under pressure over his controversial Stage Four lockdown because he refuses to confirm whether the draconian restrictions will be lifted on September 13th. He was also forced to back down from his push for a 12-month extension to Victoria being in a State of Emergency.   

This is despite a dramatic fall in the number of COVID-19 cases from a high of 725 new cases on August 5th, to under 100 since Saturday, and calls from the Prime Minister Scott Morrison and even doctors concerned about the social and economic damage being done by the lockdown.

During a media conference to discuss the state's 90 new cases on Wednesday, the Premier was quizzed by veteran radio reporter Rafael Epstein on whether his daily addresses 'sidelines' the mainstream media

'But I wouldn't agree with that analysis at all, Raf... I'm not motivated by bad headlines or good ones. 

'Seriously, just have a look at the politics and history of this state in the last six years, do you really think I'm motivated by bad headlines? Really?'

Ms Epstein interjected: 'That wasn't my question about your motivations,' before Mr Andrews cut him off.  

The premier continued: 'I get on and get my job done and I'll leave it to others to judge whether that's to their liking or not.

'There's not been that many good [headlines] has there? You've got a job to do, go and do your job because I respect the work you do.

'You'd have to give me some credit, I would think, that at every point in my public life I've advocated for more voiced in the media, not less.

Mr Andrews said he respects everyone's right to have differing opinions on him, but said he doesn't have 'the time nor the interest to get fixated' on negative press.   

'I'm far more focused on fighting this virus' he said. 

'We've established the royal commission, they're doing their important work and the time will come when we can speak in freer terms but I don't think it's important to do that now.'  

Victorian premier has become known for his lengthy press conferences and media addresses during Melbourne's second COVID-19 outbreak two months ago. 

Mr Epstein, a veteran TV and radio reporter for the ABC, prompted laughter from other journalists over his question 

Mr Andrews sparked outrage on Sunday for speaking at length about a mysterious 'plan' out of lockdown without providing details.

He mentioned the 'plan' 22 times during a press conference in Melbourne over the weekend. 

'These case numbers are too high for us to open up, and they are still too high for us to put forward a definitive plan,' he said.

'Now, there will be a plan. It will come soon.

'It needs to be a clear plan that we are confident we can actually deliver. And I do appreciate that it is frustrating, but a plan that is real is always much better, I think, than one that is rushed out and really doesn’t have the data sitting behind it, the evidence, the science.'

Victoria recorded six more coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, taking the state toll to 576 and the national figure to 663. 

A six-month extension to the Victorian government's state of emergency powers passed parliament overnight after a surprise intervention by the Greens.

It passed 20 votes to 19, with Greens MP Ellen Sandell saying on Wednesday morning that they voted for the bill on its merits.

'There were conditions of our support ... this was about the legislation for us,' she told 3AW.

While the government must report to parliament every four weeks as the state of emergency continues and the legislation is specific to this pandemic, Ms Sandell was asked why there weren't tougher oversight measures in the bill.

'That is disappointing, isn't it, that they are trying to avoid that scrutiny,' she said of the government.

'I'm not here to defend the government ... they are quite a secretive government, but ultimately the Greens make decisions based on facts and the health advice - that's what we have done in this case.'

Victorian Greens upper house MP Samantha Ratnam returned from maternity leave to vote for the government's amended bill early on Wednesday morning.

'I felt it was just too important that I had to be here,' she told reporters as she arrived at parliament with two-month-old Malala.
