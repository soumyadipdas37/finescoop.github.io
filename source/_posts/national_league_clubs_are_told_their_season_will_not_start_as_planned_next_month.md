National League clubs have been informed that their will not start on 3 October as previously planned due to rising Covid-19 cases, according to reports. 

Four clubs in the league -  namely Dagenham & Redbridge, Yeovil Town, Dartford and Notts County - received approval last week to hold test events with 1,000 fans on Tuesday and Saturday.

But with coronavirus cases rapidly rising the planned programme of test events ahead of the phased and partial return of supporters at sports venues from October 1 is set to be scrapped, according to BBC Sport.

A final decision on fans returning has yet to be confirmed, but the report adds officials at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport are expecting to have to inform governing bodies of the bad news that spectators will not be permitted.

Sports around the country are set to be asked by officials for their views on the financial impact of playing behind closed doors for several more months.

With that in mind, the outlet adds the government are keen to work with them on a possible support package that would enable them to survive.

The news comes after National League chairman Brian Barwick said he feared clubs would 'suffer severe economic hardship' if spectators were not allowed to return to stadiums in the near future given teams' overbearing reliance on matchday income at that level.

The 2019-20 National League regular season was brought to an early end because of the pandemic, but play-off games in all three of its divisions were played behind closed doors in July and August.

Barrow, Wealdstone and King's Lynn Town were elected champions of their respective divisions after club voted to decide the final tables on a points-per-game basis, with the Cumbria side promoted to League Two.

Harrogate Town are also back in the fourth tier of English football after they beat Notts County in the National League play-off final, while Altrincham and Weymouth were also promoted from their respective divisions. 

Macclesfield Town meanwhile were relegated from League Two, Fylde and Chorley could not avoid the drop from National League North, while Ebbsfleet United were relegated from National League South.
