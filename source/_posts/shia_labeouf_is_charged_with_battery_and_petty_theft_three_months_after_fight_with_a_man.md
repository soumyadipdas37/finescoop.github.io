Shia LaBeouf has reportedly been charged with battery and theft following an alteraction with a man over the summer.

It is unclear what led to the altercation however neither Shia nor the other man are said to have sustained any major injuries.

The man is said to have filed a police report with cops determining that Shia was the aggressor in the incident.  

Shia was reportedly charged with battery and petty theft by L.A. City Attorney earlier this month, which are both misdemeanors.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Shia LaBeouf for comment.

Report: According to TMZ, law enforcement sources have said the actor got into a verbal altercation with a man in June in Los Angeles (pictured in November 2019) 

Shia has had run-ins with the law in the past and was previously arrested for a druken scuffle in New York City in 2017.

He was also arrested in the same year for disorderly conduct in Savannah, Georgia when he became aggressive towards a police officer he had asked for a cigarette. 

In 2014, he was arrested after disturbing a performance of the musical Cabaret on Broadway in New York.

He pled guilty to a disorderly conduct violation and he then received outpatient care for alcohol addiction.

That same year, Shia spoke to Interview magazine and admitted: 'I've been going through an existential crisis.'

According to the star his behaviour and drug and alcohol use, as well as acting, has been his way to escape.

He said: 'I've been a runner my whole life, running from myself. Whether to movies or drinking and drugging or f***ing calamity or whatever it is, I've always been running.'       

At the time, Shia credit his film Fury, in which he plays a soldier who relies on his faith to get him through WWII, for helping him look at changing his ways.

He said: 'I found God doing Fury. I became a Christian man, and not in a f***ing bullshit way - in a very real way.'

More recently, the actor dropped out of Olivia Wilde's Don't Worry, Darling earlier this month over scheduling conflicts, according to Deadline.

He was replaced by Harry Styles, who joins Dakota Johnson, Florence Pugh and Chris Pine in the cast of the psychological thriller.
