Recorded in a whirlwind five-day session at the studio at his New Jersey home, the album will feature songs that were written in the 1970s but never released.

These numbers are called If I Was The Priest, Song For Orphans and Janey Needs A Shooter and will accompany nine new songs Bruce wrote.

'I love the emotional nature of Letter To You. And I love the sound of the E Street Band playing completely live in the studio, in a way we’ve never done before, and with no overdubs,' said Bruce's official statement.

'We made the album in only five days, and it turned out to be one of the greatest recording experiences I’ve ever had,' dished the Boss.
