They made a name for themselves on the 2020 winter series of Love Island. 

And twins Jess and Eve Gale made the most of their newfound fame as they donned satin peach nightwear during a photoshoot for their RIRI hair extensions campaign on Tuesday. 

The blonde bombshells, 21, displayed their golden complexions and sensational physiques as they posed up a storm on the pastel-coloured set.

Jess and Eve rocked matching satin vests, shorts, and a peach robe with gold embroidery as they displayed their slender pins in the stylish sleepwear.

Eve styled her blonde tresses in a wavy high ponytail while her sister opted for a sleek finish as they promoted the hair extension line. 

The reality starlets opted for heavy make-up as they frolicked on the set, which featured a pastel balloon display and cream flower wall.

The twins also chewed bubblegum while posing on a luxurious pink bed and captured photos of each other through an instant camera.     

Jess has been trying to move on since her split from Love Island beau Ched Uzor, 23, during the pandemic in June.

The lockdown reportedly made it impossible for the couple to 'build a relationship' as they were unable to meet up with one another.

In a statement shared with MailOnline, a representative for Jess confirmed the COVID-19 lockdown played a role in the demise of their romance, but insisted they continue to be friends.   

The statement read: 'After a whirlwind romance in the Love Island villa, unfortunately Jessica Gale and Ched Uzor have made the mutual decision to split.

'They have unfortunately felt the effects of lockdown separation but will continue as friends. 

'They wish nothing but the best for each other and full success in each others careers.'
