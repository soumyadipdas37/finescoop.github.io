The Christopher Nolan action film Tenet won the U.S. box office making $3.4 million in domestic box office totals, to go along with more than $280 million in international revenues.

The Warner Bros. film, which stars John David Washington, was playing at 2,850 domestic locations in a market severely impacted by coronavirus restrictions, as it's totaled more than $41 million in U.S. income since its release September 3.

The movie made $19.2 in total on the weekend, playing in a total of 58 markets, according to Variety.

The latest: The action film Tenet, which stars John David Washington, won the U.S. box office making $3.4 million in domestic box office totals, to go along with more than $280 million in international revenues 

The motion picture, which cost around $200 million to make, was the first blockbuster studio film to be distributed to theaters following the COVID-19 shutdown that shuttered theaters nationwide for months.

Mulan, which has not been put out in the U.S. theaters, boosted its international total to $64 million after taking in $3.4 million in its 20 markets.

The New Mutants made $1.1 million in the U.S. (over 2,305 locations), good enough for second place, en route to a $2.5 million international weekend. 

The Russell Crowe Unhinged, from Solstice Studios came in third place domestically with $1 million in revenue playing at 2,182 theaters, pulling its overall total north of $17 million. 

Changing times: Tenet was the first blockbuster studio film to be distributed to theaters following the COVID19 shutdown that shuttered theaters nationwide for months. Viewers were seen in London last month socially distanced from one another in the theater

Solstice Studios, looking to adapt during the unprecedented time in the industry, has pledged to continue its promotional campaign for the movie through next month.

'In the wake of studios moving their major releases out of fall, many theatres are reducing schedules and/or re-closing theatres to save money until more studio product becomes available,' the studio said. 'We are making every effort to counter balance this with a promotion that will run for the month of October for independent theatres and drive-ins to help incentivize them to keep their doors open and find other companies in their area to partner with to help promote the film.'

Coming in fourth place was a re-release Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back to coincide with the film's 40th anniversary, as it made $908,000 over 2,097 theaters. In fifth, Infidel made $745,000 playing at 1,885 domestically.
