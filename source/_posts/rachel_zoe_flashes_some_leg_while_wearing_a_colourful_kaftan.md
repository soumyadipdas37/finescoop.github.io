Stylist to the stars Rachel Zoe was taking time out for a little family bonding session on the beach in Santa Barbara on Monday. 

The 51-year-old looked fashion forward in a colourful maxi kaftan which she lifted to show off a flash of leg as she walked along the beach.

The mother-of-two was pictured with her youngest son, Kaius Jagger, six, who she was doting on.

She put lotion on his face as he prepared to go boogie boarding on the waves. 

Rachel has been busy celebrating 29 years with her husband Rodger Berman at the swanky Rosewood Miramar Beach hotel in Santa Barbara, California.

Rachel began dating Rodger while attending college in Washington, D.C. in 1991, followed by their wedding in 1996.

The couple are also parents to  Skyler Morrison.

At the time they first met, Rodger thought Rachel was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.   

He told Harper's Bazaar in 2011: 'I met Rachel in the summer of 1991. She was 19, and I was 22. 

'She was a restaurant hostess, and I was working as a waiter in Washington, D.C., where we both attended college,

'I vividly remember the first time I saw her, wearing a tight black minidress, high-heeled pumps, stick-straight hair, and big red lips covered in M.A.C. Chili lipstick (her trademark). 

'She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. I quickly learned that she also had more clothes than any woman I had ever seen. I often wondered if she'd ever do an outfit change mid-date.' 

Marking the special occasion on her Instagram account, Rachel shared a throwback of herself flashing her diamond engagement ring while snuggled up to her husband.

'This is us. Me and my ❤️ @rbermanus long ago..and today we celebrate #29 years together on our official #firstdate #anniversary xoRZ,' she captioned the photo.
