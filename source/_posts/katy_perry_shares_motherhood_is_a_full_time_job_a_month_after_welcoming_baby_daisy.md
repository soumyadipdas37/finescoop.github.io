Katy Perry has a newfound appreciation for the hard work mothers do.

She tweeted: 'Popular misconception: being a mom isn't a full time job.'

Katy continued: 'part 2: when a mom finally goes back to work (whatever profession they do) it's not like they been coming from months of "time off..." she's coming from a full time job... of being a mom, lol.'

And Katy urged her followers to get in touch with their own mothers to share their appreciation, and called for them to campaign for longer paid parental leave.

She continued: 'Part 3: call your mom and tell her you love and appreciate her and advocate for paid family leave!'

Although the couple have been inundated with gifts from their loved ones since Daisy's arrival, the coronavirus pandemic has meant many of them have only been able to meet the baby via video call.

The insider added: 'Since giving birth, the couple has been flooded with love and kindness.'

Said the source: 'Their friends have been sending them gifts and words of encouragement non-stop. And due to COVID-19, the couple has FaceTimed with people and showed them Daisy.'

They have been engaged since last year and intended to tie the knot this year in Japan but have delayed the festivities on account of COVID-19.

Orlando shares his nine-year-old son Flynn with his ex-wife Miranda Kerr. Meanwhile Katy was previously briefly married to Russell Brand but Daisy is her firstborn.
