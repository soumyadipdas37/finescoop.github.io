Newt Gingrich's wife is being mocked on Twitter for her poorly edited photo where she smoothed out her skin to appear younger, but left her husband's face untouched. 

Callista Gingrich, 54, shared a photo on Twitter on Saturday posing with her husband Newt, 77, sharing a close up of their faces. 

But her face was clearly edited, with her wrinkles smoothed out and forehead given a blurry, glowing effect.

However, she seemed to leave her husband’s face untouched, only taking to editing her own.

'Her forehead looks like when google blurs out license plates,' another added.  

'When you just swipe across your forehead and forget to dip around the sunglasses,' one Twitter user added noting the lines around her sunglasses that suggest the image was edited. 

'OMG, so obvious,' another added. 

Callista shared the photo from St. Peter's Square in Vatican City. She is an ambassador to the Holy See, the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church.
