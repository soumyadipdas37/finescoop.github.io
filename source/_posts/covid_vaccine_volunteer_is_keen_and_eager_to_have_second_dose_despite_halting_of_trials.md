A volunteer helping to search for a Covid-19 vaccine says he is 'keen and eager,' to have a second dose, despite trials being halted after another patient suffered possible side-effects.  

Jack Sommers, 35, from London, believes the Oxford University-led trial is safe, adding he is 'mostly just disappointed' about the delay 'because we are all desperate for this vaccine'.

AstraZeneca announced on Tuesday that late-studies of the vaccine had been paused after a UK participant reported a possible side-effect.

Covid vaccine volunteer Jack Sommers said he was 'mostly just disappointed' about the delay

Speaking at yesterday's press conference the Government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told the country that such a pause is not unusual during trials. 

He said similar stoppages should also be expected in some of the other ongoing vaccine candidate trials. 

Experts hope vaccines from the AstraZeneca trial could be given to the public sometime next year. 

Mr Sommers, a freelance journalist, had his first injection in May and has since volunteered to have another dose

He said: 'If I was to keel over I would have done it by now. That's why I'm not scared of having it again.'

Mr Sommers said it is a 'statistical inevitability' that at least one patient in the 18,000 on the programme will become ill at some point.

He said: 'This is so careful, it's run by Oxford University, it's got the Government involved and it's got AstraZeneca backing it.

'They've already been through ferrets, mice and monkeys, so they're about as certain as they can reasonably be that it's not going to do anyone any harm.

'My sense is that anyone who volunteered in the first place will not be put off by this, because you've got this appreciation of the risks.'

He said he has been confronted by numerous vaccine sceptics since tweeting about taking part in the trial, and he wants to convince them there is nothing to fear.

'It's just nonsense, it's just the latest type of conspiracy theory that's out there,' Mr Sommers said.

'I kind of understand that vaccines tend to alarm people and always have, and they are a slightly invasive thing. 

Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government's chief scientific adviser, told yesterday's daily press conference that it's not unusual to pause medical trials at this stage

'You are, at the end of the day, getting an injection from someone wearing a mask who you don't know and I completely get the human impulse to flee that.

'But they are completely safe, there's no malign agenda and I have learned not to engage with people who tweet at me like 'plandemic' or 'Bill Gates is going to kill you' or 'you're a Covid-idiot', or something like that.

'I am completely ignorant, I'm not a scientist - I did science GCSE and that was it, so I'm just trusting the scientist... the question of where you fall on this I think just depends on how much you trust scientists. And I trust them very much.'
