The actress, 31, plays the fearless, lovelorn Linda Radlett in the adaptation of Nancy Mitford’s 1954 novel, while Emily Beecham, 36, takes the part of her cousin and best friend Fanny Logan. 

As filming got under way last week, Lily was seen driving through the iconic Royal Crescent in London in a grey vintage convertible Jaguar.
