Jake and Elle Harrison won My Kitchen Rules: The Rivals in March.

But the same month their victory aired, the brother and sister team from Brisbane suffered a devastating blow to their local business.

Ten days before learning of their series' win, their business was forced to close due to the coronavirus pandemic and it has remained closed six months on.

EXCLUSIVE: My Kitchen Rules all-stars Jake and Elle Harrison have revealed their bittersweet 2020 victory as their business was forced to close within 10 days of winning the series six months ago. Pictured during the MKR finale - which aired in March

Jake and Elle have been part of Brisbane's unique riverfront shipping container dining and market precinct, Eat Street, since November 2013. 

Their stall concept and offerings have changed over the years.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Monday, Elle said: 'It was definitely a bittersweet win, because everything that comes with winning My Kitchen Rules just didn't happen for us, unfortunately.'

Elle, 29, mentioned that due to the global coronavirus outbreak, Channel Seven's marketing team was downsized, there were less press opportunities or events to attend, and their business was forced to close.

'It was just hard. We haven't done anything... nothing has progressed. Everything's just been put on hold and we've been waiting,' she said.

'We haven't opened in six months and there's no sign of reopening again soon': In March, East Street Northshore forced its vendors to cease operations as they closed the popular outdoor precinct amid the coronavirus pandemic

In March, East Street Northshore forced its vendors to cease operations as they closed the popular outdoor precinct amid the coronavirus pandemic.

'We haven't opened in six months and there's no sign of reopening again soon,' Elle said, claiming recent COVID-19 outbreaks interstate have pushed back the scheduled reopening of the precinct back.

Jake and Elle won a reduced $100,000 cash prize during the all-stars season this year, down from the $250,000 that was offered in recent years. 

'It’s sitting in the bank waiting to be used on the business when we can reopen. We are very lucky that we get that money to invest in the business,' she said, adding that the siblings only have 50,000 each to use on their separate and joint ventures.

'It’s sitting in the bank waiting to be used to invest back in the business': Having lost a lot of revenue with their venue remaining closed for the past six months, Elle said she's looking forward to using whatever is left of the $100,000 cash prize when restrictions lift 

Alternative plans: Eat Street Northshore are trialing a drive-thru dessert festival for the next three weekends over the September school holidays, with Jake and Elle taking part with their famous cannolis on offer (pictured)

While the precinct remains closed for the foreseeable future, Eat Street Northshore are trialing a drive-thru dessert festival for the next three weekends over the September school holidays.

Elle says she is excited to see how the public react to the concept, and hope to provide plenty of delicious treats to locals once again. 

The drive-thru dessert festival will have live DJ performances for the car queue to enjoy and a drive-thru cinema a short drive away. 

'I really think it will be amazing... if customers love it, that could be the way Eat Street operates for the next few months. I'm not sure,' she said. 

Family life: The silver-lining for Elle is that being away from her usual 60-70 hour-per-week hospitality job has allowed her to become a full-time stay-at-home mother to four-year-old son Valentino. Pictured with husband Evander Cummins and son Valentino in 2018

Elle didn't want to disclose how much revenue she had lost with the business remaining closed, but stressed that it was more than she could have ever imagined. 

'I don't even know the numbers, the more you focus on that negative stuff the more it can be a massive problem,' Elle said of the situation.

'A lot of the Eat Street vendors thought that six months would be the absolute limit, but the fact that it's lasted for this long is devastating,' she said.

The silver-lining for Elle is that being away from her usual 60-70 hour-per-week hospitality job has allowed her to become a full-time stay-at-home mother to her young son Valentino, four.

Eat Street Northshore's drive-thru dessert festival will run between September 18 to October 4 on Fridays and Saturdays (3-9pm) and Sundays (12-8pm).
