Tuesday's episode of The Block saw the teams participating in a pottery-making challenge, with each pair assigned a different tool to feature in their newly renovated kitchens. 

Jimmy and Tam, 31, were tasked with making a utensil holder, but struggled to create what was supposed to be a tall, open cylinder.

At one stage, their design took on a phallic shape, with a cheeky Jimmy, 33, leaning down and putting his mouth near the tip of the clay.

'It is so hard,' admitted an earnest Tam, as Jimmy sat beside her and giggled naughtily.

She added: 'Getting that stuff up high is not easy.'

As Jimmy feebly continued to try and mold the clay, it wasn't long before both he and Tam burst out laughing at their questionable creation.

'You have to do things to that clay that you thought you'd never have to do,' Jimmy cheekily confessed

'You have to do things to that clay that you thought you'd never have to do,' a smiling Jimmy confessed.

It's not the first time an X-rated joke has made its way onto The Block this year.

In an episode earlier this month, The Block's resident foreman Keith Schleiger asked George Bragias if he had 'trouble getting it up' after noticing the contestant's ceiling rose lying on the floor.

While it took the 33-year-old electrician a moment to register what Keith had actually meant by the comment, he was left red-faced by the raunchy remark. 

'We're gonna need six, seven guys to get this, so it's going to have to stay here at least so I can try and get it up,' George explained.

Without missing a beat, Keith asked: 'Do you have trouble getting it up?'
