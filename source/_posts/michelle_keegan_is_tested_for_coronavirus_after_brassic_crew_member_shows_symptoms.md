Michelle Keegan has reportedly been tested for coronavirus after a member of crew on the Brassic set showed Covid symptoms. 

The actress, 33, who plays Erin Croft on the hit Sky One series, is still in Essex and was due to start filming series three this week. 

And despite not stepping foot on the set yet, Brassic has reportedly tested Michelle  and other crew members for coronavirus to be safe.

While it has been further claimed that filming could be suspended for a fortnight until crew members get the all-clear.

A source told The Sun: 'The safety of the cast and crew is of the utmost importance so until bosses know it's totally safe filming won't be going ahead.

'It could be a fortnight before it starts again. Michelle was due to start filming this week but nothing is happening until they're sure it's safe.' 

MailOnline has contacted Michelle's representative for comment.

Brassic follows the story of Lancashire native Vinnie, played by Joe Gilgun, who suffers from bipolar disorder and his best pal Dylan, played by Damien Molony, who he has been inseparable from since childhood.

The boys have dealt, scammed, bribed and conned their way through adolescence, but now, on the brink of adulthood, their dealing and stealing is catching up with them, with the repercussions of their crimes heading their way. 

Michelle plays single mum, Erin Croft, in the comedy series who is seeking a better life for herself and son, Tyler, while navigating complicated relationships with show leads Dylan and Vinnie.  

Veering between hilarious comedy and heartfelt emotion, Brassic is about irreplaceable, lifelong friends, loyalty and the things that come between them.

Staying safe: And despite not stepping foot on the set yet, Brassic has reportedly tested Michelle and other crew members for coronavirus to be safe 

And despite working with a  predominantly male cast, Michelle has insisted that she doesn't mind as she's the 'blokiest one'.

The brunette beauty previously shared: 'The lads invited me in, I never felt like an outsider. I've always got on with everyone. 

'It never felt different for me - I literally am the blokiest one. I never felt like I was the only girl. We gelled straight away.'  

Elsewhere, away from her busy filming schedule, Michelle is currently building a dream £1.3 million Georgian-style four bedroom mansion with her husband Mark Wright.

Premise: Brassic follows the story of Lancashire native Vinnie, played by Joe Gilgun, who suffers from bipolar disorder and his best pal Dylan, played by Damien Molony, who he has been inseparable from since childhood (the cast pictured in show still) 

Although it was recently claimed that their property is near a dogging hot spot.

The Sun claimed people who have engaged in outdoor sex in the rural area have boasted about their escapades online.

In July, the actress and her husband Mark Wright had the country house demolished to create their own Georgian-style four bedroom mansion. 

The publication alleged an advert on an adult site read: 'The countryside near ***** is good for dogging and flashing. Loads of secluded laybys and woods etc. Also on the golf course at night. Seen some couples putting on a show after dark. You've just gotta drop lucky.'

Fun: And despite working with a predominantly male cast, Michelle has insisted that she doesn't mind as she's the 'blokiest one' (pictured with co-stars Joe Gilgun and Damien Molony in show still) 

A man in his 40s reportedly wrote: 'Out with my female friend this weekend for fun and frolics in the ***** Lane area. Good-looking peeps only.'

Another site dedicated to outdoor sex just years away from the TV stars new property is believed to have had a post which read: 'Loads of places near ***** and Chelmsford for dogging and flashing – socially distanced of course. The woods near the end of the road are great. Plenty of cover so fun to be had.'

Guidelines suggest you should remain socially distant from anyone in another household, remaining two metres apart where possible, or one metre with other measures.

Technically sex or cuddling is against the guidelines, although you cannot be fined for flouting it.

Potential sexual partners should discuss Covid-19 and ask if they or anyone in their household have had symptoms or tested positive.

A representative for Mark and Michelle declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
