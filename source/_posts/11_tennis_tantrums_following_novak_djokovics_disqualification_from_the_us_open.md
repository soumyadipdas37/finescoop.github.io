Novak Djokovic landed himself in hot water at the US Open after angrily swiping a ball away that struck a female line judge, Laura Clark, in the throat. 

The world No 1 was kicked out of the tournament after venting his frustration at the resistance being put up by Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta when he was broken for 5-6 in the opening set. 

Djokovic is not the only tennis star to have had their moment on the court, as John McEnroe coined the term 'you cannot be serious' and Marcos Baghdatis smashed four rackets in the space of one minute.

Sportsmail have rounded up the biggest tennis outbursts in history, from Serena Williams' ex-rated rants to Denis Shapovalov fracturing a line judges' eye socket.

When it comes to tennis tantrums, John McEnroe has created a name for himself. There are a number of on court explosions that could be referred to but the most notable was at Wimbledon in 1981.

McEnroe's actions even coined the phrase 'you cannot be serious' as he blasted the chair umpire for a line call, calling him 'the pits of the world'.

The hot headed player later went on to name his autobiography: 'You cannot be serious'.

During the 2000 Samsung Open, former Wimbledon champion, Goran Ivanisevic was forced to retire from the match after smashing every single racket in his bag.

Xavier Malisse was banned after kicking up a storm in the 2015 Miami Masters.

Malisse was leading 6-3 5-5 against David Ferrer before everything went south.

The Belgian player disputed the linesman's call, launching a verbal attack on the officials.

If that wasn't enough to get him suspended, Malisee confirmed his fate by laying down on the court and refusing to get up, smashing his racket and kicking over a chair.

Subsequently, Malisse was withdrawn from the competition – losing his $13,290 prize money and was fined a further $7705.

Anastasia Rodionova was defaulted for unsportsmanlike conduct in the Cincinnati Open in 2007.

She became just the second player on the WTA Tour to be disqualified after hitting a ball at three fans cheering for Angelique Kerber.

The only other female to be disqualified was Irina Spirlea in 1996 for swearing at an official.

Much like McEnroe, Serena Williams has established herself as one of the many hot headed elite tennis players.

Williams saw red when she was called out for a foot fault on her second serve while 6-4 6-5 and 15-30 down against Kim Clijsters in the semi-finals at the US Open.

Williams launched a verbal attack on the lineswoman – who claimed the tennis star threatened to kill her.

Consequently, Williams was deducted a point and Clijsters won the game 6-4 7-5.

Williams was also fined a record total of $82,500 for her outburst.

There is smashing one racket, then there is smashing ever racket you own. Baghdatis opted for the later. 

Down two sets, Baghdatis sat in his chair at the changeover and whacked his racket against the court until it was in tatters. 

But that wasn't enough for the furious player, who went on to smash three more. 

Having smashed a total of four rackets in one minute, Baghdatis become a YouTube sensation. Nearly 24 hours later, a view of his outburst was watched more 350,000 times.

Viktor Troicki's 2013 Italian Open rank may go down in history as one of the longest on court rants.

Having started with a foul mouthed rant, Troicki went on to threaten to retire and even dragged the cameraman onto the court to show the close-up of the mark.

Nineteen-year-old Denis Shapovalov hit a ball at 90 mph straight into the eye of an umpire at the 2017 Davis Cup.

The official, Arnaud Gabas, suffered a fractured eye socket, underwent surgery and was back in the chair two months after the incident.

Shapovalov now claims that he and Gabas have become friends and even credits the umpire's ability to bounce back after the injury.

Serena Williams has found herself on the list once against after her explosive outburst at the 2011 US Open.

During the final, Williams shouted at chair umpire Eva Asderaki after a call went against her. 

She said: 'If you ever see me walking down the hall, look the other way. Because you're out of control. You're out of control. Totally out of control. 

'You're a hater and you're just … unattractive inside. Who would do such a thing? And I never complain. Wow. What a loser. 

'You give a code violation because I expressed who I am? We're in America last I checked…don't look at me, I promise you don't look at me cause I am not the one. Don't look my way.'

David Nalbandian released his frustrations at the Queen's Club final in 2012 by kicking the advertising board surrounding a linesman's chair.

Stefanos Tsitsipas is one of the more recent accounts of on court aggression.  

Having dropped the opening set in a feisty match against Nick Kyrgios, the 21-year-old Greek was furious with himself, swinging his racket wildly in anger as he returned to the team bench. 

Once of his swings even caught his dad on the top of his right arm, drawing a large bruise.
