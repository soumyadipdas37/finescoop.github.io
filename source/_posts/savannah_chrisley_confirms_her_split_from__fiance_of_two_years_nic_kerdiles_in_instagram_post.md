Savannah Chrisley is proving that she 'knows best' when it comes to her heart.  

The Chrisley Knows Best star, 23, took to Instagram on Tuesday to announce that she and her fiance of two years, former Ice Hockey player Nic Kerdiles, 26, were breaking up after growing fan speculation.

In an emotional post, Savannah posted a photo of the two in an engagement photoshoot before launching into the truth about their relationship.

Heavy heart: Savannah Chrisley, 23, one of the stars of hit reality show Chrisley Knows Best took to Instagram on Tuesday to announce her split from her fiance of two years, Nic Kerdiles, 26.

The blonde beauty started off the post addressing the fact that her followers had 'all been wondering...so here it is' before launching into her statement.

Savannah continued ' Oh how I wish this smile was on my face and that infectious laugh was spewing out of my body right now...but sadly it’s not. Nic and I have decided to call it quits. There’s no hatred between the two of us...and in all honesty...that makes saying goodbye even harder.'

The reality star explained that the two did not have bad blood and were trying to make this as amiable as possible. 

Happier times: Savannah and her fiance first met on Instagram in 2017. A year later they were engaged with plans for marriage that allegedly got postponed due to the pandemic before she revealed their news

 'We have nothing but love, respect, and admiration for one another but it’s time for us to move forward individually. These past 3 years have been some of the best years of my life...but I have to trust that God has a far greater purpose for my life...I believe that He will take this hardship and make something beautiful out of it.'

She finished by asking her 2M followers to 'please be kind with this news that I am sharing...'

Before her public post Savannah had shared some cryptic screenshots on her story that alluded to there being something brewing.

Reposting a quote from author Malanda Jean-Claude, she proclaimed 'To my heart - even when it doesn't feel better, lead me where it's right.'

Comfort: Savannah indulged in pizza and cinnamon rolls as she claimed her 'mama' was trying to heal her heart

She followed up after making her Instagram announcement, by posting a photo of pizza and cinnamon rolls. 

She wrote on the snap 'when mama tries to heal the heart' as she looked to be indulging in some of her comfort foods surrounded by mom Julie and the rest of the Chrisley family.

On September fourth, father Chris Chrisley posted a photo of the two lounging together to hit back at a fan that was speculating the two were no longer together. 

He captioned the photo 'Here you go - maybe this will bring some light to your dark soul' as he slammed the now deactivated user's account for being nosy.

 The last photo of she and now ex Nic on her Instagram feed was in early June - around the time fans were questioning the relationship and their wedding plans.

Making a statement to People  she said 'Nic and I are great...We continue to grow each and every day and for that I am blessed!

Nearly three months after that statement it is apparent the two youngins were working through some big issues before ultimately making the decision to split up.

Nic and Savannah met on Instagram and began dating in the fall of 2017. The couple got engaged on December 24, 2018 after a year of being together.

A year later Savannah told E! that she and her fiance were 'taking steps back' but were still committed to each other and focusing on their 'God-centered' relationship.

It is unclear at this time if the relationship drama will play out on an upcoming season of Chrisley Knows Best as Season eight is still in swing.
