British Prime Minister Boris Johnson 'dropped in' on a meeting between White House adviser Jared Kushner and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, government officials confirmed. 

Mr Johnson made a 'short drop-in' during talks at the Foreign Office between Mr Raab and Mr Kushner about the situation in the Middle East.

It was 'specifically a discussion about the Middle East peace process', the Prime Minister's spokesman told reporters during a briefing.

 President Donald Trump's son-in-law arrived in London having this week travelled on a high-level Israeli delegation to the United Arab Emirates on the first direct commercial passenger flight between the two countries.

Karlie Kloss is pledging her support for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

The supermodel, 28, is slated to make an appearance on Thursday in support of the former Vice President in tandem with the group STEAM, which is aimed at spreading awareness toward educating people on science, technology, engineering, art and math.

Kloss - who is wed to Joshua Kushner, the brother of President Donald Trump's senior adviser Jared Kushner - will be joined at the proceedings by Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani, as well as Dr. Morine Cebert Gaitors, Nancy Lu and Adrianna Williams.

The Project Runway personality will participate in an event set to 'highlight the important work that is happening with women in STEAM,' according to Biden's campaign.

An insider told People that the cause is near and dear to Karlie's heart: 'For those who know Karlie, this event makes a lot of sense.

'She cares deeply about the future of women in STEAM and has always supported the candidates who stand for the issues she’s passionate about.'

Five years ago, the catwalk superstar initiated her Kode With Klossy program encouraging young girls to focus on developing the technical skills in the fast-changing digital landscape.

'Kode With Klossy is about igniting the initial spark in young women to want to explore the world of technology, so applicants that show creativity, passion and curiosity around tech always stand out to me,' Kloss told People in 2019. 

The appearance comes at a bit of a conflict with her personal life, as she's been married to Josh Kushner - the brother of President Donald Trump's senior adviser Jared Kushner - since October of 2018.

The flight traversed Saudi airspace following a US-brokered deal by the United Arab Emirates to normalise relations with Israel.

Before boarding the flight on Monday, Mr Kushner said: 'While this is a historic flight, we hope it will start an even more historic journey for the Middle East and beyond.

'This is a very hopeful time and I believe that so much peace and property is possible in the region and across the world.' 

Mr Kushner visited the traveling press corps in the back of the plane while over Saudi airspace to say it was 'gracious' of the kingdom to make such an extraordinary gesture, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a recorded in-flight address over the loudspeaker noting so as well.

The flight itself came after weeks of a quickly warming relationship since the surprise August 13 White House announcement establishing ties. 

In just over two weeks, telephone lines were connected between the countries, the UAE's ruler issued a decree formally ending the country's decades-long boycott of Israel and several Israeli companies have already signed business deals with Emirati counterparts. 

Mr Kushner was joined onboard by national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Mideast envoy Avi Berkowitz and envoy for Iran Brian Hook.

The Israeli delegation was led by national security adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat, who spoke in Arabic upon arrival. It included the director generals of several government ministries who hoped to establish a rapport with their Emirati counterparts on issues of diplomacy, trade, science, technology and cooperation in countering the coronavirus pandemic during the short two-day visit.

For the Palestinians, the day was also symbolic - and painful. The Palestinians have long counted on the Arab consensus that normalization with Israel could come only after a Palestinian state is established. They have condemned the UAE's move toward Israel as treacherous.

Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said 'it hurts us very much' to see the Israeli plane landing in the UAE. He noted that the plane was called 'Kiryat Gat,' a southern Israeli town built where Arab villages once stood before the war surrounding Israel's establishment in 1948.

'We would have liked to have an Emirati plane landing in liberated Jerusalem, but we live in a difficult Arab era,' Shtayyeh said.

While the Palestinians have cut off ties with the US, Mr Kushner said the US and the 'whole region' is ready to help them. 'But they can't be stuck in the past. They have to come to the table,' he said.

Number 10 defended the Conservative Party leader's decision to join a meeting with a figure so close to Mr Trump now that campaigning for the next presidential election has stepped up before the looming November poll.

Mr Trump is fighting to secure a second term in the Oval Office against a challenge from his Democratic rival Joe Biden.

'It was specifically a discussion about the Middle East peace process, which I think we all would agree it is important we continue to be fully engaged in that work,' the Prime Minister's spokesman said.

When asked whether the Prime Minister would be 'endorsing' Mr Trump in the November election, the No. 10 spokesman said: 'The long-standing position in the UK is that elections are a matter for the electors of that particular country.'

The UK is currently involved in negotiations with the US as it seeks to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the world's largest economy.
