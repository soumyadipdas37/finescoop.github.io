She is part of the world's new generation of young supermodels.

But Kendall Jenner is keeping things au naturel on her Instagram page. 

While many of her Kardashian sisters are known for using filters on their selfies, Kendall, 24, posted a paired down no-make up snap on Tuesday.

Posing in the mirror while brushing her teeth, the daughter of Caitlyn Jenner promoted her brand Moon Oral Care, which makes products that are cruelty-free and vegan. 

Earlier this year, Moon released a range of popping candy breath mints, said to contain a 'a proprietary Elixir blend that features coconut and peppermint oil to support a fresh, healthy smile.'  

The idea behind the popping candy mints is that they are perfect for people on the go - with the brand suggesting that customers 'give a pack to a friend and create an orchestra of crackling, popping freshness'.

Described as 'ASMR-ready', the sugar-free, vegan breath mints are intended to provide all of the same freshness that you might get from more traditional mints or gum - but with an added dose of fun. 

'The mints bring back the fun back to freshening your breath with a whole-mouth freshness that pops in the mouth with a popping breath mint,' a spokesperson for Moon explained. 

Compared to her family, Kendall has been keeping a relatively low-profile lately, aside from her recent beach outing with rumored new beau Devin Booker.

The supermodel and Phoenix Suns player, 23, were caught putting on a very amorous display together just last month. 

Kendall and Devin were first spotted together in April and have been fueling gossip ever since. Last month they appeared to go on a trip to Sedona, Arizona together, only intensifying rumors.

While Jenner's always shown a liking for basketball players - previously dating the 76ers' Ben Simmons and Pistons pro Blake Griffin - Booker's relationship history makes him an interesting choice.

Devin previously dated her sister Kylie's ex bestie Jordyn Woods, who was booted from the Kardashian/Jenner inner circle after smooching Khloe Kardashian's babydaddy Tristan Thompson, who plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
