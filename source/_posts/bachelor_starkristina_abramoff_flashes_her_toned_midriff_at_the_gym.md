Claims: On Friday, the 24-year-old offered proof she has completed her Bachelor's degree amid claims she is a paid actress who only went on the show for fame

Rumours: 'No, I don't have a degree. Absolutely do not have a degree. I just made this up,' she sarcastically told the camera, as she held up her certificate in the Q&A

On Friday, the 24-year-old offered proof she has completed her Bachelor's degree amid claims she is a paid actress who only went on the show for fame.

Sharing a video to her YouTube account, the brunette answered several burning questions during a 12-minute Q&A session about her experience on the reality series.

'No, I don't have a degree. Absolutely do not have a degree. I just made this up,' she sarcastically told the camera, as she held up her certificate.

 That's it! 'That's my first degree, a Bachelor of Science and Physiology.... and my second is a first class honours in Sports Science, Exercise and Health,' she added

'Bachelor of Science. Kristina Joey Abramoff, yes, my middle name is Joey,' she added.

'That's my first degree, a Bachelor of Science and Physiology.... and my second is a first class honours in Sports Science, Exercise and Health.'  

Kristina then went on to explain that her PhD, which she is currently working towards, is on clinical research and is focused on type one diabetes.
