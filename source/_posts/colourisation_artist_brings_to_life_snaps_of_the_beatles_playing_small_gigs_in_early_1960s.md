A series of black and white photos of The Beatles have been brought to life in colour ahead of what would have been John Lennon's 80th birthday.

The enchanting images show the Fab Four when they were in fact a fivesome, performing at clubs in Hamburg and Taunton's Wyvern Social Club.

They feature drummer Pete Best, who would later be replaced by Ringo Starr, as well as original bass guitarist Stuart Sutcliffe, who left the band to pursue his career as a painter, before his untimely death in 1962.

Professionally colourised for the first time, thanks to 19-year-old artist Daffa Anargya Sandjono from South Tangerang, Indonesia, the pictures give a glimpse into the iconic band's early years. 

Dating from 1960 to 1962, they show the Liverpool legends honing their craft at small gigs before the release of their 1963 debut album Please Please Me. 

Another captivating image displays a boyish-looking George Harrison in colour, taken in 1961, when he was just 17, likewise Paul McCartney when he was only 16.

Lennon was assassinated in 1980 and would have been celebrating his 80th birthday on October 9, 2020. 

The colourisation artist spent countless hours painstakingly researching and adding colour to these black and white images, including this one from Hamburg featuring Pete Best (left) as part of the Fab Four, before he was later replaced in 1962 by Ringo Starr
