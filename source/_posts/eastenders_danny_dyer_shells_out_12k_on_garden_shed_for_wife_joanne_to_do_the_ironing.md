Despite recently hitting their four-year wedding anniversary, they've been a couple for just months shy of three decades.

And Danny Dyer has treated his wife Joanne Mas, both 43, to quite the lavish gift, splashing out an estimated £12,000 on a luxury garden shed for her.  

But while Jo took to her Instagram to gush about the brand new construction, she revealed plans to use it for a less than thrilling domestic task: ironing.

Sharing a snapshot of the wood-panelled building in the Stories section of her account, the mother-of-three expressed her love for EastEnders star Danny.

She wrote: 'And... finally I get my own room to do the ironing!! I love my husband more today,' ending her post with a heart emoji.

Having extra space at home could prove to be useful, as their eldest daughter, Love Island star Dany Dyer, is expecting a baby with her boyfriend Sammy Kimmence.

At the start of 2020, Joanne revealed she plans to renew her wedding vows to Danny this year, after claiming he 'humiliated' her during their marriage. 

The mum-of-three told The Sun that she plans to say 'I Do' to the actor once again, after stating she’s had to 'deal with s**t' throughout their marriage.

The couple met when they were just 14 years old and finally tied the knot in 2016 after an on-off romance which has been marred by Danny's infidelities. 

However, Joanne appears ready to put the past behind her and recement her love for Danny.

When questioned on why she wanted to renew her vows, she explained: 'I just think we should, with all the s**t I’ve had to deal with as a wife.

'For me and him, I think we got carried away the first time, the excitement. We will do, we will do something very low key.'

Joanne also discussed her big day in 2016, which saw her officially become Mrs Dyer.

Speaking about her wedding she said: 'I don’t regret it at all, we had a great time, a great party, but if I knew the situation I was going to get myself into, I wouldn’t have gone down that route.'

When asked to elaborate further she continued: 'Obviously I was very humiliated after we got married, you know.'

Danny reportedly sent an explicit video of himself and a selfie in his boxers to a mystery blonde, while on his stag do in 2016.

And last year, The Sun on Sunday revealed that the woman is the EastEnders actor's friend of 20 years, Nikki Lee.

A source told publication: 'Danny and Nikki spent a lot of time together around the time he married Jo. They were in touch in the build-up. Danny shared some of his deepest and most private thoughts.'

Another added to the outlet: 'Nikki has been there for him through good times and bad. He’s really appreciated her supporting him through all of his ups and downs.'

Speaking candidly to The Sunday Times Magazine last year, Danny talked about his relationship with Joanne.

Danny explained: 'I can’t remember a time when I wasn’t a dad. Me and Joanne had Dani when I was 18 and . . . f***ing hell, we were kids!'

Speaking her truth: 'Obviously I was very humiliated after we got married, you know,' she said

The pair went on to split when Dani was only three years old and started seeing other people.

However, it wasn't long before the actor found himself back in the arms of Joanne, admitting that he did 'everything in his power' to spend more time with her and Dani.

Danny explained: 'I don’t know if Joanne saw how much I missed ’em, but the visits started getting longer and we’d sit down with a cup of tea.

'Next minute... we’re having an affair. I said: 'F*** this! We’re sneaking around like schoolkids. We’ve got a beautiful girl. Let’s give it a go".'

In 2017, it was said the pair's romance fell on hard times again following reports of his 'unfaithful behaviour'.

The pair were reported to have split in early 2017 - following reports the actor had a six-week affair with former Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding, while filming 2012 flick Run for Your Wife.

It was reported that Harding thought that Dyer was single at the time.

Danny and Joanne share three children, Love Island winner Dani, 24, daughter Sunnie, 13, and six-year-old son Arty.
