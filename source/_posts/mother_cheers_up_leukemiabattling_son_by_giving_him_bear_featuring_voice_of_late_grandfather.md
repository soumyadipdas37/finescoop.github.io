This is the heartwrenching moment a little boy with leukemia broke down in tears, after hearing his beloved grandfather's voice in a toy bear. 

Jessica Turpin filmed the moment she gave her son Ryan, who was in floods of tears at the time, the custom-made Build-A-Bear to make him feel better. 

His grandfather Bubba Lou passed away in May and Ryan, who has been suffering from leukemia since 2018, was very close to him. 

Jessica's video shows Ryan clutching the bear before his grandfather's voice - recorded from old voice mail messages - emanates from it, prompting him to say, 'I love you grandpa' as he continues to cry. 

Although his grandfather's words are not audible in the recording, and it's not been revealed what he says, Ryan's emotional reaction is clear.  

Ohio mother Jessica Turpin gave her leukemia-battling six-year-old son Ryan a toy bear which featured the voice of his late grandfather to lift his spirits. His grandfather Bubba Lou passed away in May and Ryan, who's been suffering from leukemia since 2018, was very close to him

The video begins with Jessica handing Ryan the bear's 'certificate', which lists his birthday as May 2nd 2020, the day of his grandfather's death. 

As Ryan cries while reading the sheet, Jessica says, 'It says his birthday is May 2nd of 2020, that's the day that Bubba Lou passed away. 

'And his name is Bubba Lou bear, and he belongs to Ryan, and it's from mommy.'

Ryan then pulls the bear in close to him and cries further before Jessica adds, 'listen, Bubba Lou wants to tell you something'. 

Jessica's video begins with her showing him the bear's 'birth certificate'. Ryan is then seen clutching the bear before his grandfather's voice - recorded from old voice mail messages - emanates from it, prompting him to say, 'I love you grandpa' as he continues to cry

She then presses the bear's stomach and his grandfather's recorded voice is played. 

Ryan listens intently before saying, 'Thank you Grandpa. I miss you Grandpa. 

'I am always thinking about you and I cry because I really miss you. I love you Grandpa. I never stopped loving you. I never stopped.'

Jessica said that when Ryan lost his grandfather he was devastated. 

She said the pair were very close and had shared a love of 'going to high school sporting events together.'

Jessica told him, 'listen, Bubba Lou wants to tell you something'. Ryan then pulled the bear in closer as he said, 'Thank you Grandpa. I miss you Grandpa. 'I am always thinking about you and I cry because I really miss you. I love you Grandpa. I never stopped loving you. I never stopped'

Determined to lift her son's spirits, Turpin began her search for the perfect gift. 

She said she wanted to find something that would bring Ryan comfort during the hard time.

'Ryan loves stuffed animals so I decided to make him a custom Build-A-Bear,' Jessica said.

'I took some old voicemails that I had on my phone from his grandfather and mashed them together to make a nice recording for Ryan.'

She had the recording placed inside the bear and dressed the furry friend in something similar to Baba Lou's go-to sporting apparel.
