The female director, 51, is suspected of fraud by false representation and money laundering, while the man, 43, was arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation, fraud by abuse of position and money laundering. 

Both were released under investigation. 

Digital devices and business records were seized, days after MPs were warned by the taxman that up to £3.5billion has been overpaid as part of the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme.
