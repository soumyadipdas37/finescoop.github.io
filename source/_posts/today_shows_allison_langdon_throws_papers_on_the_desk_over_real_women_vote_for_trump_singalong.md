The stage has been set for this year's first United Stated Presidential Debate which will see Donald Trump and Joe Biden face off just weeks before the election.

And with Channel Nine's special coverage of the impending event, Today show host Karl Stefanovic hilariously forced his co-host, Allison Langdon, to watch a video of a 'Real Women Vote for Trump' singalong on Tuesday.

Allison, 41, was left enraged as she dramatically threw pieces of paper on the desk as three Stateside women in 'Make America Great Again' hats passionately sang about re-electing Donald as their President.

'Don't rile me up!' Today show host Karl Stefanovic hilariously forced his co-host, Allison Langdon, to watch a video of a 'Real Women Vote for Trump' singalong on Tuesday

A scheming Karl began by saying: 'Just quickly, I know, Ally, you are a big supporter of Donald Trump, and you are not alone.

'I found this video of women around the world who are singing this song.'

The screen then cut to a clip of three women who began singing: 'We don't care if you're white, we don't care if you're black, we don't care if you're gay, we're all under attack.

'We don't care if you're rich, we don't care if you're poor. We just know what we're fighting for.'

'Sing it!' the blonde in the middle continued before she and her friends jointly sang: 'Real women vote for Trump!

'We don't need no liberal chump. Real women vote for Trump,' they continued to chant.

Allison saw the funny side of the video presented to her as she playfully picked up her papers and swung them back down.

'You know, don't get me riled up!' she joked to Karl.

Meanwhile, Karl, who was clearly expecting the blonde's dramatic reaction, couldn't resist collapsing into a fit of giggles.

U. S President Donald Trump will have his first presidential debate against Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday at 9 pm [USA ET] at Case Western Reserve University.

Trump and Biden are slated to discuss and debate their records, the Supreme Court, the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, race and violence, and election integrity with moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News.

Trump will also face questions over a recent New York Times report claiming the billionaire president only paid $750 in federal taxes in 2016 and 2017.
