Diversity's routine, which narrated the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May, had already polarised fans of the mainstream talent show on Saturday night due to its overtly political stance. 

An Ofcom spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline on Friday afternoon that Britain's Got Talent has received 15,500 complaints so far. On Monday the figure stood at 1,121. 

They added: 'We are assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.'

Britain's Got Talent airs tonight at 8pm on ITV.
