A source dished to Hollywood Life last year: 'She eats well and exercises...She feels her biggest secret to looking sexy [after 50] may be that she feels blessed and lucky to have good genes' (pictured August 20)

'She exercises regularly, takes good care of herself, gets plenty of rest, drinks lots of water, and stays out of the sun. Her routine is simple but she is very regimented about eating well, practicing yoga and taking good care of her skin too. She tries to get facials regularly, never goes to sleep with makeup on and also avoids sugar.'

The insider added: 'She will enjoy a cheat meal followed by some chocolate when the mood strikes her. She feels her biggest secret to looking sexy [after 50] may be that she feels blessed and lucky to have good genes.'
