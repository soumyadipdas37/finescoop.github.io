A natural tanning water that 'airbrushes' the face with a radiant glow is giving women the confidence to go make-up free after years of wearing heavy cosmetics.

Created by Australian skincare brand Eco Tan, a few drops of 'Face Tan Water' promise to 'filter' the complexion with a healthy, sun-kissed tint using organic ingredients like aloe vera, rose oil, hyaluronic acid and orange peel.

The $34.95 liquid - which should be applied with the fingers before bed and left to develop while you sleep - is making waves in beauty groups on social media, with many claiming they haven't worn foundation since discovering it.

The liquid (pictured) should be applied with the fingers before bed and left to develop while you sleep

* Orange peel oil: Nourishes dry, irritated and acne-prone skin

* Rose oil: Hydrates skin and reduces redness, scarring and signs of ageing

* Hyaluronic acid: Reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles and accelerates the healing of spots

* Aloe Vera: Calms inflammation and soothes irritated skin 



A product overview describes the water as a 'real life organic filter' that 'camouflages blemishes and reduces the appearance of redness' across the face, neck and chest. 

Hundreds of five-star reviews stand testament to the magic of the tanning water online, where customers have praised it for giving their skin a new lease of life.

'I have worn cover up all through my twenties and now because of face tan water, I can actually just let my bare skin take on the day, no cover up!' one woman said.

'I have never had such a glow before in my life. Not even pregnancy with my two babies made me glow like face tan water does! I could not be without it now and hope I never have to be.'

Another described the water as her holy grail beauty product that she would choose above anything else.

'This is a fantastic product, I have never been a fan of heavy make up and was never that great at applying it, but Eco Face Tan Water there is absolutely no need for anything else, this goes on evenly and the colour is so natural looking,' she said.

'It's worth every cent and then some. Just love it.'

Eco Tan was born in 2010 when Gold Coast founder Sonya Driver set out to make a product that allowed people to tan without exposing themselves to chemicals or harmful ultra-violet rays.

Shunning all manner of chemicals typically used in self-tanners, Ms Driver experimented with samples of cacao, flower essence, chamomile and all things natural, mixing batches in the kitchen of her Currumbin home.

The result is what is now one of Australia's most popular natural skincare brands, one that's won over 50 coveted awards for its clever organic formulations.

Eco Tan made history in 2011 when it became the first and only tanning manufacturer to be certified organic by the Australian government's Organic Food Chain.

Eight years later in 2019, the brand's Eye Compost – a $49 all-natural eye cream - hit headlines after women on social media raved about its ability to lighten dark circles and banish fine lines after just one week of use. 

A new all natural eye cream is making waves across Australia for its ability to lighten dark circles and banish fine lines in just one week

Developed by Australian brand Eco Tan, Eye Compost promises to leave the eye area 'bright and smooth' using a range of powerful ingredients including Vitamin C and Kakadu Plum 

* Vitamin C and Kakadu Plum: Help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles 

* Hyaluronic acid: Naturally boosts moisture for instantly plump healthier looking skin

* Spirulina: Brightens and reduces the appearance of dark circles 

* A jade stone: Increases circulation, resulting in a fuller, more youthful appearance 

The cream promises to leave the eye area 'bright and smooth' with a blend of powerful ingredients like vitamin C, spirulina and Kakadu Plum, a fruit grown in Australia's Northern Territory. 

Described as 'supercharged luxe eye cream', the piercing blue formula proved wildly popular with hundreds reporting noticeable improvements after one application.

'These ingredients brighten, plump and help reduce the appearance of dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles,' the product description reads.

'Kakadu Plum with Vitamin C improves skin luminosity and helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

'Pure hyaluronic naturally boosts the moisture in your skin for instant visibly smoother healthier looking skin and Spirulina brightens to help reduce the appearance of dark circles.'

The cream is laced with aloe vera, known to calm inflammation and soothe irritated skin, and comes with a jade stone applicator which claims to 'tighten and tone' pores.

Online, customers confirmed the benefits in a string of gushing reviews.

'This little blue pot of magic did brighten my under eyes, reduced wrinkles and just make my under eye so much more moisturised! So in love,' one customer wrote

'Eye cream that actually works! I have used and tried so many products on the market, and lately been trying to go as natural with my skincare as possible and find that without real technology behind the skincare, they do nothing,' one woman wrote.

Another said: 'This little blue pot of magic did brighten my under eyes, reduced wrinkles and just make my under eye so much more moisturised! So in love!'

Others agreed, with one skincare enthusiast declaring she noticed a difference seconds after applying the cream. 

'It instantly de-puffed my eyes and decreased dark circles and lines,' she said.

'I love using the jade roller to glide over the eyes as you use the product, this has a great cooling effect. I had another product I considered a great eye cream, but this is now my holy grail.'
