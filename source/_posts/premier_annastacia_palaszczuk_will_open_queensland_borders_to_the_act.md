Queensland will open its borders to the ACT after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was slammed for denying a Canberra nurse the opportunity to attend her father's funeral in Brisbane.

Residents from the ACT will be allowed to enter Queensland via air from 1am on September 25, the premier announced on Friday.  

'I have spoken with Chief Minister Andrew Barr to confirm the ACT will be removed as a hotspot,' Ms Palaszczuk said.  

Ms Palaszczuk said Canberrans will only be allowed into the Sunshine State if they haven't visited a declared hotspot in the past 14 days.

On Friday, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced residents from the ACT will be allowed to travel to Queensland from 1am on September 25

'We'll work with ACT authorities to make sure appropriate checks are in place at Canberra Airport for people flying into Queensland,' Ms Palaszczuk said. 

'This is another step towards ensuring Queensland's economy rebounds, not the virus.'  

Health Minister Steven Miles encouraged ACT residents to choose Queensland for their next holiday. 

'Queensland is good to go,' he said. 

'This is time to coincide with the school holidays in the ACT. A great chance to come and visit friends and relatives, go to the reef, go to one of our wonderful tourism hotspots.

'This is great news for the ACT and recognition for the fact that they have been sometime without any cases.'

No coronavirus cases were recorded in the Sunshine State overnight and it has been eight days since it had a case of community transmission. 

The easing of border controls comes after Sarah Caisip, a 26-year-old Canberra nurse, was denied a permit from the Queensland government to enter the state to see her dying father. 

Health officials stopped Ms Caisip from leaving her Brisbane hotel quarantine last week to grieve with her 11-year-old sister Isobel Prendergast and her mother Myrna Prendergast. 

She was only allowed to view her father's body 20 minutes after the funeral dressed in personal protective equipment.  

Thursday marked ten weeks since the ACT recorded a new coronavirus infection.

New South Wales and Victoria remain COVID-19 hotspots in the eyes of the Queensland government.
