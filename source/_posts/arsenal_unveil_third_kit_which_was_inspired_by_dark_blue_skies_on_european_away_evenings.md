It comes as the Arsenal front-man is expected to sign a three-year contract extension with the Gunners.

The new kit produced by Adidas, is navy with a dark, cloud-like design with pink accents 

It is 'inspired by dark blue skies on European away evenings', according to the designers, and includes 'coral detail in the form of the club badge, adidas logo and sponsor name.'

After winning the FA Cup, Arsenal might end up wearing that kit on away European nights as they will enter the Europa League.

The shirt, which bears the adverting 'Emirates - Fly Better' across the chest and the 'Visit Rwanda' logo on the left sleeve, will be accompanied with blue shorts and socks.

Adidas took over from Puma at the end of the 2018-2019 campaign, and their new kit rounds off the second season of a five year £300m deal between Arsenal and the manufacturer. 

The latest launch follows the unveiling of their white away kit was criticised by fans and even compared to Patrick Bateman's blood-splattered American Psycho overcoat. 

 Their away kit features a predominantly white design with an added marble print.
