Love story? Lily James and Armie Hammer are newlyweds dragged into a world of mystery and intrigue in the first trailer for the 2020 adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca

In the trailer, Lily's character begins the story as a shy ladies companion who is spotted by the dashing Maxim de Winter (played by Armie) while on a holiday with her mistress in Monte Carlo.

The couple fall madly in love and marry mere weeks later, with the unnamed Mrs de Winter joining her husband at his sprawling Cornish estate in Manderley.

The trailer then shows Mrs de Winter being introduced to home's housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (played by Kristin Scott Thomas), who forever compares her to Maxim's first wife, the illustrious Rebecca, who was supposedly killed in a boating accident.

Things take a dark turn as Mrs de Winter grows suspicious of her husband, and grows convinced Manderley is haunted by the spirit of his first wife.

The trailer offers a glimpse of the iconic novel's twists and turns as Mrs de. Winter tries to learn the truth about her charming husband's past.

The film - which also stars Keeley Hawes, Sam Riley and Tom Goodman-Hill - is directed by Ben Wheatley, who began his career working British crime thrillers, before helming the Tom Hiddleston-starring High Rise in 2015.

Rebecca was first adapted by Hitchcock in 1940, his first US film, and was produced by the legendary David O. Selznick, who also produced Gone With The Wind.

Starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, the thriller won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

In an interview with the Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye, Lily revealed that co-star Kristin was 'so absolutely terrifying' as scary housekeeper Mrs. Danvers.

In fact, revealed the actress this summer, Lily said she felt compelled to obey her costar's every command while they were filming the new version of Daphne du Maurier's gothic thriller.

'I almost jumped out of a window when she told me to!' Lily admitted, as she spoke about the film adaptation of the classic romantic murder mystery.

Fortunately, the stars enjoyed much light between takes when they weren't inhabiting their characters, all of them oppressed by the shadow of Rebecca.

'Oh, God, we were really hamming it up when we weren't in front of the cameras!' Lily told Baz.

Key interior scenes were captured at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, while the lush grounds of Manderley were actually filmed at Mapperton, in Dorset. 

Rebecca is released on Netflix on October 21.
