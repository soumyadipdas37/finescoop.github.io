Myer has launched a massive sale on its designer footwear collection with prices slashed on shoes, sandals and sneakers to as little as $39.

For one week only, the department store is offering a generous 40 percent off men's and women's styles from top brands like Calvin Klein, Windsor Smith and Tommy Hilfiger, in-store and online.

Sketchers, Steve Madden and Lacoste as well as homegrown Australian labels like Lauren Marninis and Sandler are also discounted until the sale ends on Sunday, September 20.

Top offers include sandals and heels for $40, sneakers for $60 and flats for $29.

The mega-sale comes five days after the embattled department store suffered staggering losses of $172.4million as sales plummet amid the crippling coronavirus pandemic.

Total sales fell by almost 16 per cent in the year to July 25.

In March, Myer closed its 60 stores and stood down 10,000 staff - leading to a surge in online sales.

The department store chain told the Australian Securities Exchange on Thursday this was 'one of the toughest decisions Myer has faced in its 120 years of operation'.
