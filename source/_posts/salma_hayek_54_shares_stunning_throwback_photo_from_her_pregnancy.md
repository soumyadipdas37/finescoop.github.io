Motherhood: Salma Hayek shared a throwback photo from her pregnancy with daughter Valentina on the eve of her only child's 13th birthday

'Tomorrow the tiny baby that formed inside my womb officially becomes a teen. They grow so fast...' she wote, adding the same words in Spanish.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

Speaking to The Telegraph over the weekend the screen star admitted she was happy she waited until later in life to be a mum. 

'I’m glad I didn’t have her earlier. I’m a better person because I got to do a lot of things that were important to me first. Most crucially, I had her with the right person at a time when I could really focus on [motherhood],' she explained.

Salma has been reflecting on her stellar career recently, admitting that she has been delighted to have filmmakers approach her for roles in recent years after starting her career trying to get them to cast her in their movies.

Time flies: Writing alongside the stunning snap, Salma, 54, who shares Valentina with her husband François-Henri Pinault, 58, gushed that time had flown since her pregnancy (pictured with Valentina in 2019)

'It really invigorated me that they are finding me. I always found them. But they didn't want me. And that now they're coming to me, that's what's been really invigorating,' the beauty told OK! magazine.

'It's difficult to make sense of it, you know? But that's what's been really strange. And you know what? Strange things happen to strange people.'

In the past few years the actress has starred in Drunk Parents, Like A Boss and The Roads Not Taken. Next she will be seen in The Eternals, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard and Bliss.

Salma rose to fame in the Mexican telenovela Teresa before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a big screen career.

However, when the Hollywood actress first started out in 1988 she had no idea how things would end up. 

She believes any struggles over the years have given her the possibility to choose the right path, having dubbed her life 'completely unimaginable'.

Salma said: 'At some point in your life you just settle for doing the right thing and the best you can, instead of think about what you want and what you can didn't get get or what you're not getting or how someone's getting it and you're not getting it.
