Jacinda Ardern's partner has revealed their daughter's favourite toy which has a pretty odd feature.  

The New Zealand Prime Minister and her now fiancé Clarke Gayford, welcomed baby daughter Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford in June 2018.

Mr Gayford took to Twitter on Friday to share his daughter's favourite handmade gift she's received  - also saying that he enjoys the toy too.

The cat with nipples (pictured) was revealed as Neve's favourite toy after receiving it as a gift

The favourite toy in question, is a cat with nipples. 

'We both enjoy is this, at first glance, a bung legged, crazy eyes cat....but on closer inspection...it's a cat with nipples,' he wrote in a thread with photos of the toy.

However, there is even more than what meets the eye and Mr Gayford shared another photo of kittens hidden inside the toy. 

The kittens were tucked away in the cat's stomach which can then all 'connect to the milk bar'. 

'...and that is my story, thank you,' Mr Gayford wrote along with a cute photo of the cat with the kittens attached to the nipples.  

Mr Gayford continued his story on Twitter revealing that the cat actually has kittens inside 

The kittens can then 'connect to the milk bar', just like in real life

Mr Gayford said he 'feels bad' that he hasn't started an Instagram account to showcase the many toys Neve receives. 

His thread however, has since received more than 1,600 likes with social media users saying they didn't realise it was a cat at first.

'This is amazing and is absolutely a dog,' one person wrote.

'I thought it was a sheep at first, but then, I don’t live on a farm,' another commented. 

'It's a Cog..cat body, doggy face,' another wrote.     

Ms Ardern confirmed her engagement to her Mr Gayford in May 2019 after she was spotted wearing a ring on her left hand.

Their engagement came almost a year after the birth of their first child Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford in June 2018.

The couple's engagement came almost a year after the birth of their first child Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford in June 2018

Mr Gayford, a well known broadcaster who hosted a fishing show called Fish of the Day, took a step back from his career to care for the couple's daughter. 

Ms Ardern and Mr Gayford first met at an awards event in 2012 but did not start dating until 2013 when a constituency issue brought them together, Stuff reported.

Mr Gayford was upset about the potential loss of privacy proposed by the Government Communications Security Bureau Amendment Bill. 

He first went to local MP, Nikki Kaye, but got no response.

He then wrote to Ms Ardern and the two met for coffee and bonded over a shared interest in music.

Ms Ardern has previously spoken out about their wedding plans, saying neither her or Mr Gayford had a particular stance on marriage. 

'I predict we will one day. We happen to have done things in reverse a little bit, but that happens in life sometimes too,' she told RNZ.

She has been the Labour leader since August 2017, having been appointed to the party's top job just weeks out from a general election.

She graduated from the University of Waikato in 2001 with a degree in politics and public relations

After graduating, she volunteered at a soup kitchen in New York before moving to London to work as a policy adviser to British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

She entered parliament as a list MP in 2008, becoming the youngest sitting representative.

Ms Ardern became deputy leader of the Labour party in March 2017.

In October 2017 she formed a coalition with New Zealand First and the Green party to become New Zealand's third woman Prime Minister.

She was the second world leader ever to have a baby in office when her daughter Neve was born in June 2018.

When not in the capital city, she lives with her boyfriend, TV presenter Clarke Gayford, 41, in Auckland.
