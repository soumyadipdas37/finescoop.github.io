An adopted son who tracked his birth mother down only to discover she had been murdered has shared his incredible story. 

Perth teacher Matthieu Heimel, 41, was originally born in the Phillipines and his two sons inspired him to begin looking for his birth parents in 2018. 

Mr Heimel connected with his biological father through a DNA search and began to contact family members in the Philippines via Facebook. 

But the 41-year-old soon discovered his mother Nenita Evans had moved to Melbourne in 1985 and vanished, Yahoo News reported.   

Perth teacher Matthieu Heimel embarked on a search to find his birth parents in 2018 and discovered his mother Nenita Evans (pictured) was murdered after she moved to Melbourne

Ms Evans married a man named Greg Evans, who she had met in Manila, and got a job as a housekeeper at the Melbourne Club, a popular gentlemen's club. 

She worked for a man named Vicenzo Leonardi, who continued to promote Ms Evans, and would drive her home.  

There were rumours Mr Leonardi and Ms Evans were having an affair, and she began attending night school to become a florist after he put her in charge of floral arrangements.  

Ms Evans returned to the Melbourne Club to show off her portfolio on January 8 in 1987 and was never seen again.   

Her husband Greg Evans was initially a prime suspect in Ms Evans' murder case but Victoria Police never solved the mystery.  

As Mr Heimel continued to search for answers he uncovered more disturbing facts that could link to his mother's disappearance.    

Another woman named Milagros Dark was found murdered in 1990 and she also used to work at the Melbourne Club and drive home with Mr Leonardi.   

Mr Heimel then found a third woman, Anna Maria Pontarollo, who was linked to the Melbourne Club boss and vanished in 1954.  

Mr Heimel (pictured) discovered his mother worked as a housekeeper at the Melbourne Club and two other employees from the gentleman's club had also vanished after Ms Evans 

Ms Pontarollo had been living with Mr Leonardi and the pair had two children together before Mr Leonardi's wife migrated from Italy.

She disappeared soon after and Mr Leonardi told the children his wife was their biological mother.   

Mr Leonardi attended a Coroner's Court hearing into the disappearance of Ms Evans in 1995 but did not give evidence. He died in 2009.  

Mr Heimel said he was continuing to seek answers but sometimes struggled with the revelations.     

'I move on from one discovery to another, it's hard for me to show my emotions.

'When I started to look for my birth mother I was hoping that it wasn't too late,' he explained. 

Mr Heimel said finding out what happened to his mother would provide closure for his own family. 

'It is a story of resilience which will inspire people by showing that while difficult times do come, they can be overcome,' he said in a Facebook post.
