They've been frequently spotted partaking in PDA during their fledgling relationship. 

And Katie Holmes only had eyes for her new beau Emilio Vitolo Jr. on Monday, when the loved-up couple enjoyed a romantic outing in New York City.

The 41-year-old actress seemed smitten by the 33-year-old chef as she hung on his every word during a ferry trip in the Big Apple.

The Dawson's Creek alum and her new man wore matching face masks for the outing.

Katie occasionally lowered her mask so as to better converse with the son of famed restaurateur Emilio Vitolo.

The chef-actor looked sharp for the date in a gray turtleneck and a dark newsboy cap.

Later in the day the ex-wife of Tom Cruise had a wardrobe change before stepping out solo in jeans and a dark turtleneck sweater of her own.

Rumors that Katie and the chef were romantically involved were first sparked when the pair were spotted outside the restaurant Peasant in New York at the start of the month.

And just days later, Dailymail.com revealed that Emilio broke up with his live-in fiancee, Rachel Emmons, 24, by text when photos of him and Katie looking affectionate were published.

The handbag designer was reportedly blindsided by the split and forced to move back home.

Katie and Emilio's friendship has been growing since October 2019, and she doesn't seem to have been bothered by his engagement.

They first met when a mutual friend introduced them, and their passions have only intensified since she returned home to New York City following time quarantining with her family in Ohio.

An insider close to the Logan Lucky star said she's now behaving 'like a teenage girl in love' because Emilio is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something [her ex-boyfriend] Jamie [Foxx] couldn't,' the source added.
