Jane Moore has claimed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 'don't deserve' their deal with Netflix, which could be worth as much as $150 million. 

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who recently bought a $14 million mansion in Santa Barbara, have signed a new deal with the streaming service, and say they want to provide 'hope and inspiration' with their upcoming projects. 

The couple founded a yet-to-be-named production company which will make documentaries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming, and the pair will reportedly follow similar deal to the Obamas.

However Loose Women panellist Jane, 58, believes the couple have bagged the deal because of 'who they are' not 'what they have proved they can do' and admitted on today's show that it 'irritates' her to see the couple chosen over 'young talent'.

Loose Women panellist Jane, 58, told on today's show the couple have bagged the deal because of 'who they are' not 'what they have proved they can do'

Speaking of the deal, host Charlene White asked: 'Do they deserve it?' 

'No,' replied Jane immediately. 'End of discussion.'  

'It irritates the hell out of me. I'm a writer myself. I know there are so many writers producers, there is so much young talent out there trying to come through, who would love to get into Netflix's door - let alone be given this deal. 

'They have been given this deal because of who they are, not because what they have proved they can do.'

She went on to insist that if after stepping down as senior royals the couple had spent their time building their portfolio of work in the same way as other creatives, she would have no problem with the deal. 

'I'm all for if, ten years down the line, they have made lots of programmes and come up quietly and got the deal then [that would be different],' she said. 

'But I think them just parachuting in is not good for the creative industry as a whole, Ryan Murphy has a deal, Shonda Rhimes, these are proven really good creative writers, producers, creators.'   

Fellow host Gloria Hunniford, 80, went on to share her opinion on the deal, admitting she felt it was 'inevitable'.  

'I am not surprised at all, said Gloria, 'Because when you talk about giving hope, I think the 100 million dollars might give Meghan and Harry a bit of hope. 

'We knew when they went back to America, that commercialism was coming in. They have to make their money and it was inevitable they were going to make it in some kind of commercial way. 

'I disagree with Jane in a way, I understand about new talent but you can't blame Netflix for getting Harry and Meghan, worldwide that is an immediate attraction.'  

Gloria finished by saying: 'She’s got what she wanted in the end so I’m not surprised one little bit.' 

Jane then quipped: 'And the good news is they can pay back the £2.4 million the British taxpayer gave to used to refurbish the house they no longer live in'.

Rumors of Harry and Meghan seeking to gain a foothold in Hollywood have run rampant ever since the couple announced their plans to quit as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America in January.

Meghan's first post-Megxit job in showbiz was as a narrator of the Disney Plus docuseries Elephants, which came out in April.

The 39-year-old Los Angeles native nabbed the job after Harry bragged about her voice-over skills to Disney chairman Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King live-action remake last summer. 

Her fee for the project went entirely to the Elephants Without Borders charity - an organization dedicated to conserving wildlife and helps protect the animals from poaching.
