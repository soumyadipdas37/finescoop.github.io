He's currently preparing to welcome his third child with wife Chrissy Teigen.

And John Legend was every inch the doting parent and husband as he stocked up on groceries for the pregnant model and their kids Luna, four, and Miles, two, in Beverly Hills on Monday.

The musician, 41, cut a casual figure as he wheeled a trolley filled with cans of Coke and bottles of orange juice to his car.

Opting for a low-key display, the All of Me hitmaker wore a plain black T-shirt and khaki green shorts.

The award-winning artist maintained his dressed-down display with his choice of footwear as he wore pale grey canvas trainers.

Shielding his eyes from the sun in rounded shades, the father-of-two proved safety comes first by sporting a protective face mask amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, his longtime partner, 34, was forced to hit back at a Twitter troll after they sent her a threatening message saying they wanted to 'beat her a**'. 

The online personality had retweeted body camera footage released by Masai Ujiri's legal team showing the alleged altercation with California sheriff's deputy Alan Strickland at the 2019 NBA Finals.

To which a male Twitter user responded with: 'But you like.....[pizza emojis] f**k you and your morals. I wish you'd play hockey I'd f**kin rock your a*s you dirt bag!'
