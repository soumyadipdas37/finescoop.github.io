Mackenzie's arrival is said to cause trouble for Moira, played by Natalie J Robb, as she is forced to remember a dark secret from her past.  

While Manpreet, played by Rebecca Sarker, is left unimpressed when her younger sister Meena unexpectedly shows up after previously having a huge fallout.

Meena soon ruffles feathers in the village when she flirts with Billy Fletcher and leaves his ex Dawn Taylor seething with jealousy.

Ben, who could be a new love interest for Aaron, confronts the troubled character about their school days where he treated him badly. Can he make amends?   

Talking about the new role, Mackenzie star Lawrence Robb said: 'I am absolutely thrilled to be moving into Emmerdale village as MacKenzie.

'I have had so much fun playing around with the character already, and to do it in Britain's most famous village is just the cherry on top. 

'I couldn't be further from Mac in real life, so playing him will no doubt have its challenges, but I'm more than up for the ride! I can't wait to don my wellies and wreak some havoc.'

'I'm loving working with both Rebecca [Sarker] and Bhasker [Patel] and they have made me feel so welcome.'

While Ben actor and Our Girl star Simon Lennon added: 'I'm so excited to be joining the cast of Emmerdale. I feel so lucky to be a part of such an established, fantastic show.

'Everyone has been so welcoming and I can't wait to see what unfolds for Ben. Ben and Aaron Dingle have a lot of history and it will all come to the forefront when they're reunited after a long time apart.'

The exciting news comes after it was revealed that Emmerdale will return to six episodes a week later this month.

Set to start on September 14, the ITV soap will resume its usual schedule, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to reduce broadcasts. 

Emmerdale had to cease filming its episodes while cast and crew were sent into lockdown, with the rest of the country.

The soap has teased that betrayal and resentment are at the 'centre of the village this autumn'.   

Emmerdale executive producer, Jane Hudson said: 'I’m so proud of the tireless work that everyone has put into getting us back to six episodes a week. 

'The commitment, loyalty and enthusiasm from our cast, crew and different teams has been phenomenal. I couldn’t be prouder of them.'

Emmerdale will return to its usual format on Monday 14 September at 7pm on ITV. 

Hooray! Set to start on September 14, Emmerdale will resume its usual schedule, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to reduce broadcasts
