Ex-Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness believes Liverpool and Manchester United are 'blackmailing' the Champions League winners over the signing of Thiago Alcantara.

The Spanish international has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League this summer, and has made it known to the German club that he wants to explore a new challenge with just a year left on his contract. 

Premier League champions Liverpool are the frontrunners, with United also interested, but Hoeness has accused the two English clubs of underhand tactics in order to sign the 29-year-old for a cheaper fee later in the window.

Bayern midfielder Thiago is keen for a new challenge with just a year left on his current deal

'It is a difficult situation,' he told German outlet Sport1. 

'A while ago we agreed on a new four-year contract. Some days later he said: "I'm looking for a new challenge." Which is totally okay. 

'I think he obviously has an agreement with Liverpool or Manchester United or both of them. Now both clubs are bluffing, and no one has contacted Bayern Munich officially.

'From my point of view, that has no style. They're trying to blackmail us, by waiting until the last week, when they're going to make a cheap offer.

The Bayern Munich midfielder has been linked with Anfield for the entirety of the summer

'In that case FC Bayern have to ask themselves the question: do they want to go along with that or do they tell the player that he has to stay. It's going to be a hot three weeks until [the transfer window closes on] October 5.' 

The 68-year-old added that he felt uncomfortable with the manner in which top European clubs now communicated with regards to signings.  

'At this time, there is a style evolving, even between the big clubs, which I did not know until now,' Hoeness added. 

Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp last week refused to completely rule out a summer deal for Thiago.

'If I could invent a word that would end speculation I think I could become really rich,' Klopp joked. 

'I cannot end speculation as long as the transfer window is open so that's all really I can say. Did I mention Thiago Alcantara is a really good player? Long ago already!

'It's nice we are linked with him but that's pretty much all really. It's because he's a good player and Liverpool is big club so that's nice.'
