Davina Potratz has lifted the lid on what happens between the cast when the Selling Sunset cameras stop rolling during a new interview.

The TV personality and real estate agent, 42, declared the stars of the show 'don't see each other that much' and admitted most of the cast members aren't close.

Speaking on FUBAR Radio, Davina discussed how the agents really feel about each other and confessed the pandemic hasn't made it easy for them to connect.

Explaining the situation off-screen, she said: 'Of course some of us are closer than others. People are also really busy and we don't see each other as much, especially because of COVID and we're not at the office so much. 

'Everyone I think stops by at the office at some point, but they're not necessarily working there all the time. So we really don't see each other much.'

When asked who she keeps in touch with, she revealed: 'I've seen Jason and Brett. I see Christine, we're really close friends. And I talk to Maya every day. I haven't seen Heather because she's also down in Newport so I don't see her much at all. 

'I've not seen Chrishell and I have not seen Mary. I actually FaceTime with Amanza a lot too.'

She continued: 'We all have several text exchanges going. Some just with the girls, some with the whole cast. Always support each other.'

Despite being branded the 'villain' of the show, the Netflix star was eager to note: 'Look, I don't believe in throwing anyone under the bus. We're all on the same rollercoaster.'

Although she claimed Chrishell Stause and herself aren't close off camera, she did throw her support behind her co-stars Dancing With The Stars bid. 

Davina said she was 'brave' to take part, but admitted to missing the first week and watching the next two, commenting: 'I thought she did good. I think it's really hard first of all. It must be extremely difficult.'

Despite her positive comments, she didn't hold back from making a slight dig to Chrishell's previous dances, as she said: 'Last night she did Cinderella. I thought she did good in that. That was more graceful probably because now she's been dancing for three weeks so it's a little bit more natural.'

She also threw shade at Olympic ice skater Johnny Weir, and said: 'You know, he's an Olympic ice skater, so of course he's going to do significantly, it'll be much easier for him. So I think sometimes it's a little bit unfair that way.'

Davina was full of surprises during the interview as she spoke positively about their rival show Million Dollar Listing, noting that 'we're friends with some of the agents'. 

This comes as a shock after Tracy Tutor and the other cast members hinted that Selling Sunset was lacking in the real estate credentials department, relying on drama between its stars instead. 

Explaining the situation off-screen, she said: 'Of course some of us are closer than others. People are also really busy and we don't see each other as much, especially because of COVID and we're not at the office so much'

In fact, Davina went on to reveal that the rival cast had gone as far as to give them advice: 'They said it takes three or four seasons to kind of really get going. 

'To kind of get a lot of real estate clients reaching out… They were like, 'you're gonna get hundreds of inquiries and maybe five are real.' 

The Oppenheim brothers, Brett and Jason, revealed last week that a new series of the show is highly likely to go ahead, but Davina gave perhaps a more true account of what's happening: 'We have not had any confirmation. I really don't know. 

'We haven't had confirmation and we don't know who's going to be asked back. We assume everyone, we hope everyone, we don't know, we don't anything. We're positive. We feel like the show's doing well and because we had so much press and enquiries and interest and everything, we hope that it will come back.'
