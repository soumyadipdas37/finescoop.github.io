Newcastle United’s £20mIllion offer for Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson has been accepted, Sportsmail understands. 

Aston Villa - who offered £21m on Saturday - have withdrawn their interest as Newcastle is the player’s preferred club.

Wilson will now finalise terms with the Magpies and it is hoped he will complete his move in the coming days. 



Newcastle's £20mIllion offer for Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson has been accepted

Steve Bruce looks set to land his main attacking target in Bournemouth striker Wilson 

Steve Bruce is desperate for attacking reinforcements and is set to land his top target.

The head coach has lost Dwight Gayle to a knee injury until at least December and only Andy Carroll has featured in recent warm-up matches. 

Wilson would be a huge acquisition for the Magpies after they were drubbed 5-1 by Middlesbrough in a pre-season game ahead of the 2020-21 campaign. 

The 28-year-old favours a move to Newcastle over Aston Villa and looks to have got his wish

The 28-year-old has been a standout performer since joining the Cherries in 2014 from Coventry, firing 67 goals in 187 appearances for the club. 

Wilson's impressive displays in the Premier League have also seen him feature in Gareth Southgate's England squad, earning his first call up in November 2018 for games against the United States and Croatia.

Meanwhile, Newcastle have offered around £13.5m for Norwich left-back Jamal Lewis and are in talks to sign former Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser on a free transfer.
