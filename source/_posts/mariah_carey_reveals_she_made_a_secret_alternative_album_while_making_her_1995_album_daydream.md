Mariah Carey on Sunday revealed she made a secret alternative album in a collaboration with the group Chick while she was making her 1995 album Daydream.

Carey, 50, took to Twitter with the musical tidbit as she continues to promote her new memoir The Meaning of Mariah Carey.

'Fun fact: I did an alternative album while I was making Daydream Eyes, the Grammy-winning singer said. 'Just for laughs, but it got me through some dark days.'

She added an excerpt from the book going into detail about the previously-unknown recording.

'Here's a little of what I wrote about it in #TheMeaningOfMariahCarey,' she wrote. 'Love-you gesture S/O to my friend Clarissa who performs the lead w/ me as a hidden layer.'

The Vision of Love artist said she enjoyed the change of creative pace with the work.

'I actually started to love the songs,' she said in the book excerpt. 'I was playing with the style of the breezy-grunge, punk-light white female singers who were popular at the time.

She continued: 'You know the ones who seemed to be so carefree with their feelings and their image. They could be angry, angsty, and messy, with old shoes, wrinkled slips, and unruly eyebrows, while every move I made was so calculated and manicured.'

The mom-of-two - who shares twins Moroccan and Monroe, nine, with ex-husband Nick Cannon - said that performing in the different genre was a welcomed creative respite from the pop/R&B stylings of the Daydream album.

'I wanted to break free, let loose, and express my misery - but I also wanted to laugh,' she wrote. 'I totally looked forward to doing my alter-ego band sessions after Daydream each night.'

Daydream would go on to be a massive hit, spawning smash singles like Fantasy, Always Be My Baby and One Sweet Day.

The Meaning of Mariah Carey, is out on September 29, while she's slated to release a new album called The Rarities on October 2.
