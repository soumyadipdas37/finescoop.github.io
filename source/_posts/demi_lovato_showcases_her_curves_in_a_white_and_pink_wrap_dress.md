She is currently working on her seventh studio album after making her return to music at the Grammy Awards in January. 

And in a Wednesday Instagram post, Demi Lovato had fans speculating that she was hinting at new song lyrics. 

The 28-year-old shared a two photo set flaunting her curves in a white and purple wrap dress.

'"Dear little me, I'm sorry that it took so long but baby your (sic) free,"' she captioned the post on Instagram and Twitter. 

Fans quickly jumped on the potential of the caption to be song lyrics responding with 'OMG LYRICS?' and 'ARE THOSE LYRICS,' in excitement.  

Lounging on her grey tufted couch, Demi took the opportunity to snap a high-angled selfie. 

She wore a plunging dress with green and purple floral detailing, the wrap style showed off her upper thigh.

The former Disney star teamed her dress with two necklaces in silver diamond chains. 

For more luxurious touches, she wore large diamond earrings and thin diamond band rings.  

In a full-body shot she showed her pink pointed-toe heels that she paired with the outfit 

For a touch of old Hollywood glamour she parted her dark hair on one side, pinning her hair back and allowing her loose curls to rest on her right shoulder. 

Reflection: Demi Lovato is opening up about her year so far, during which she said she's 'experienced extreme highs and lows'; seen here in January performing at the Grammys

Her glam look was perfectly paired to her ensemble, with pink eyeshadow, dark lined eyeliner and a flawless complexion with contoured cheeks. 

Earlier this week, Demi opened up about her year so far, during which she said she's 'experienced extreme highs and lows.'

In a new essay for Vogue on Tuesday, the I Love Me songstress, shared her candid thoughts on the still-present coronavirus pandemic, as well as reflections on the Black Lives Matter and Me Too movements.

'Depression and mental illness are part of my history, and because of all the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, my anxiety skyrocketed,' Demi wrote toward the beginning of her powerful missive.

The outspoken entertainer shared what many white allies have expressed feeling as the BLM protests were underway, and social media began filling with calls to action to help people of color.

'At first, I was self-conscious about speaking out about these issues because I didn’t want anyone to feel like it wasn’t genuine. I also felt like I wanted to call every person of color that I knew and apologize, which I know isn’t the right thing to do either. Like a lot of people, I didn’t know what to do. 

'All I knew was that I hated that I shared the same skin color as the people accused of committing heinous crimes against Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and many, many other Black lives,' she continued.

Demi expressed one way in which she felt her white privilege: 'I grew up listening to Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and other soulful singers, but those two Black women in particular shaped me into the vocalist I am. If you look at my life, everything that I have — money, success, a roof over my head — it’s because of the inspiration those Black women gave me.
