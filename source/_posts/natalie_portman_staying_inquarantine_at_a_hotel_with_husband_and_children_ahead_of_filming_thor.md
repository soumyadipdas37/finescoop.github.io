Natalie Portman arrived in Sydney, Australia last week to begin filming the Marvel Studios movie Thor: Love and Thunder.

And according to a new report, despite her A-list status, the actress is staying in hotel quarantine like everyone else. 

The Daily Telegraph claimed on Sunday that the American star, 39, is holed up at a Sydney hotel with husband Benjamin Millepied, 43, and their children, daughter Amalia, three, and son, Aleph, nine.

'She's in quarantine at a hotel arranged by the government, just like anyone else. No special treatment,' an alleged source told the paper. 

At present, a mandatory 14-day quarantine is required for those arriving to Australia from overseas. 

Some stars have recently received criticism for requesting hotel quarantine exemptions, including actress Nicole Kidman and singer Dannii Minogue.

Nicole, 53, and husband Keith Urban, 52, were allowed to head straight to their $6.5million mansion in the Southern Highlands when they flew into Sydney from Tennessee by private jet on July 20.

Despite being granted this exception, the pair still spent 14 days at home in accordance with Australia's coronavirus rules.

The couple were joined by their two daughters, Sunday Rose, 12, and Faith Margaret, nine.
