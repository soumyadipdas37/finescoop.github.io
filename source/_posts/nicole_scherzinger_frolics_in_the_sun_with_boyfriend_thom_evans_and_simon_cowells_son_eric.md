She's been celebrating Labour Day weekend with her family in the sunshine.

And Nicole Scherzinger was proudly flaunting her figure in a plunging black swimsuit as she shared a glimpse of her fun-filled afternoon in Malibu with boyfriend Thom Evans and Simon Cowell's family on Monday.

The singer, 42, took to Instagram Stories to share a series of videos as she larked about on a slide with Eric, before sharing selfies with Simon's girlfriend Lauren Silverman, and their son Eric and the mogul's ex-girlfriend Terri Seymour.

Nicole proudly displayed her bronzed physique in the plunging black swimsuit as she shared a video of her riding down a water slide with Eric.

The X Factor judge went onto share a selfie with Lauren, who was also clad in a plunging black swimsuit.

Nicole also posted a glamorous selfie with Lauren and Simon's former partner Terri, as the music mogul himself continues to recover from surgery following a broken back.

Say cheese! The singer posed for a beaming selfie with Simon's girlfriend Lauren, with the pair donning matching black swimsuits

Posting a pair of loved-up snaps with her shirtless beau Thom, Nicole penned the caption: 'Happy #LaborDay weekend. Thank you to the essential workers for all your hard work, particularly in these challenging times. 

'We are so grateful for you and celebrate you this weekend!'

They may have been dating for less than a year, but Nicole and Thom are clearly devoted to one another and divide their time between her LA pad and London.

According to reports, Nicole is trying for a baby with her former rugby player beau.

The singer is said to be keen to start a family of her own with Thom, as the couple are looking to the future and intend on purchasing a property together in London.

A friend told The Sun: 'Thom told pals he's been taking supplements to boost fertility. Nicole and Thom are ridiculously loved-up, and have had serious conversations about everything from marriage to babies.

'No one would be surprised if they had some baby news in the coming months.

'Thom currently lives with his brother and a housemate in London which hardly makes for a romantic love nest. They are looking to buy a house together once lockdown is over.'

Nicole's representatives declined to comment and MailOnline also contacted Thom's representatives who are yet to comment.
