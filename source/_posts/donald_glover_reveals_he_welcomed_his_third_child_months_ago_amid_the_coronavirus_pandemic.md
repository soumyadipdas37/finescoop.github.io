Donald Glover is now a father three times over.

The Atlanta star revealed in a British GQ interview published Tuesday that he and his girlfriend Michelle White had welcomed their third child months ago amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The 37-year-old actor and writer spilled the beans while chatting with I May Destroy You star and creator Michaela Coel, who graced the November issue's cover.

'I had [a kid] during the coronavirus,' Glover admitted. 

'It was nuts. I was in the hospital bed. My son had just been born, like, an hour before, and I was watching the George Floyd video.'

Though the Community star didn't specify when he son was born, Floyd was killed by a white police officer on May 25, so his son may have arrived in late May or June.

'It was such a weird moment. It was such an intense, weird moment, because I’m watching that video and it’s, like, eight minutes long, so you’re sitting there and I had just had this amazing, joyful, expanding moment, plus my dad had passed away recently, so [my son] was named after my father.'

Glover had also been named after his father, Donald McKinley Glover Sr., who died in 2018.

'I don’t even know what, really, the word is to describe it,' the stand-up comedian continued. 'It was just expanding: the empathy and compassion and the terror and the joy of it.'

Glover revealed they were expecting their second son in 2017 at the Emmys during his acceptance speech for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series 

The couple were seen together in November last year at the 9th Annual LACMA Art+Film Gala in Los Angeles, were Michelle was displaying a baby bump.

Major role: Last year, Glover voiced Simba in the mostly computer-generated remake of The Lion King, which also starred Beyoncé

Glover made the admission while having a discussion with Michaela Coel, the actor and writer responsible for the acclaimed shows Chewing Gum and I May Destroy You.

He complimented her for the latter series, which aired on HBO in June and July. 

'I guess the biggest compliment I can give [the show] is this: it made me feel super inspired. And [before], I was not feeling very inspired. It really broke me out of feeling that everything’s the same. Your show is such a good feeling, and flavor,' he said.

Last year, Glover voiced Simba in the mostly computer-generated remake of The Lion King, which also starred Beyoncé.

Earlier that year, he starred in the musical Guava Island opposite Rihanna, which was directed by his regular Atlanta collaborator Hiro Murai.

This year, he released his fourth studio album 3.15.20, which followed the critically acclaimed single This Is America (2018) and his 2016 album "Awaken, My Love!"
