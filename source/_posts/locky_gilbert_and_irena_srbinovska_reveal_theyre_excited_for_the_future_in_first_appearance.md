Thursday night's Bachelor finale saw Locky Gilbert choose Irena Srbinovska to be his champion, in one of the most dramatic seasons to date.

And it appears the two are still as loved-up as ever, as they took to social media shortly after the episode aired to give a special video message to fans.

Proving they're still going strong, the gushing pair shared a cheeky kiss on camera before telling viewers they're still very much 'in love' and excited for the future.

'We can finally start our lives together!' Locky Gilbert and Irena Srbinovska have revealed they're 'excited for the future' in their first appearance since The Bachelor finale 

'We're SO excited for the future,' Irena, 31, gushed. 'It's been such a long process and now we finally get to be together, and finally get to start our lives together.'

Locky, 30, added: 'It's been so long and now we finally get to tell everyone we're in love, and just get on with our normal life!' 

When asked what the first thing they would do is after the news broke, Locky laughed: 'First thing we're going to do - just be with each other. Go for a hike, go for a camp - just anywhere out in nature.

Irena chimed in: '...Phones switched off, and time all together for ourselves.'

Locky added: 'We just want to say a huge thank you to everyone for watching. It's been a crazy year, and we just want to say thank you to everyone.'

Irena continued: 'Thanks for all the love and support from everyone. We've definitely read all your messages, and sorry that we didn't get back to you but thank you from the bottom of our hearts.'

'You get back to most everyone!' Locky quipped, to which Irena replied: 'I do.'

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph about starting afresh with the adrenaline junkie, Irena confessed: 'I have left my job, I have left my family and friends and the only city that I have lived in.'

Irena excitedly continued: 'I have found a job in Perth and can’t wait to start living the rest of my life with Locky.'

It was a tense finale, as Locky had told Irena and Bella Varelis that he had fallen in love with them - leading both to believe they had won his heart.

But ultimately, it was down to earth nurse Irena who stole the burly adventure man's heart - leaving Bella completely devastated. 

Bella eventually stormed off set, after questioning why he ever told her he had fallen for her in the first place.
