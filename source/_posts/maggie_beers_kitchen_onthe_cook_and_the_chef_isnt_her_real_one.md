Maggie Beer is one of Australia's most revered TV cooks.

But on Wednesday, the 75-year-old revealed on Sunrise that the kitchen she's known for cooking in on-screen actually isn't her real kitchen.

During a live TV cross from Maggie's farm shop in Nuriootpa, in South Australia's Barossa Valley, weatherman Sam 'Mac' McMillan said: 'Lots of people are messaging me this morning, people think this is your kitchen in your home, but it's not.

'That's television for you': Maggie Beer revealed on Sunrise that her kitchen which is featured on The Cook and The Chef isn't her real one 

'You have been living a lie,' he joked after she made the surprising revelation. 

'Oh, my god, that is television for you,' she said, before explaining that her husband Colin built the studio kitchen to be a replica of her home kitchen.

Maggie's studio kitchen was where she filmed her hit series The Cook and The Chef with Simon Bryant from 2006 to 2009.

'Simon and I did, with Cook and The Chef, 150 episodes over four years. Can you imagine,' she proudly told Sam of the ABC TV cooking series.

Last month, Maggie reunited with Simon more than a decade after their show finished airing

Proving they're still good friends, the pair posed for a photo together at the picturesque venue.

The Cook and the Chef was an ABC show that featured Maggie, a self-taught cook, sharing tips and recipes with Simon, 55, a highly trained professional chef. 

The program was popular with viewers thanks to its blend of Maggie's homespun wisdom and Simon's insight as a formally educated restaurateur, as well as their genuine chemistry and friendship.

Back in February, Maggie announced her daughter Saskia Beer had died unexpectedly in her sleep at age 46.

She shared the tragic news in an Instagram post, and asked fans for 'time and space' as the family 'grapple to come to terms' with their loss.

'It is with broken hearts we need to let you all know that our beautiful, extraordinary daughter Saskia died unexpectedly yet peacefully in her sleep on Friday night,' she wrote.

Saskia was an accomplished chef and caterer, and leaves behind husband Petar Jercic and three children.
