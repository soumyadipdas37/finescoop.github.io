The Voice Australia is reportedly set for a major shakeup in 2021.

Following the announcement that the hit singing show would be moving to Channel Seven after a nine-year run at rival Nine, the rumour mill has started swirling about which stars could join the stellar line-up on the judging panel.

On Monday, the Music Network reported that Aussie music legends Kylie Minogue and Keith Urban are the front runners tipped to join next year.

Rumours the pair would replace international judges Boy George and Kelly Rowland began circulating in July, after the show was hit hard by international travel restrictions, which forced the big names to continue filming via Zoom from their home in the UK and USA.

An insider told New Idea at the time: 'I think they will try and reinvent themselves with two new Aussie judges and use "All Aussie Voice" as a tagline for 2021.'

Furthermore, they reported the execs were aiming high as they are said to be working on bringing in pop princess Kylie and country superstar Keith to join existing judges, Delta Goodrem and Guy Sebastian.

'Keith Urban is top of their list as he was loved the first time around. And he and Nicole [Kidman] can easily return home, being Aussie,' the insider explained.

Keith, 52, would be a familiar face having after he was one of the original coaches on the show's debut series in 2012.

Can't Get You Out Of My Head hitmaker Kylie, 52, has also had experience on one of the plush red leather seats, serving as a judge on season three of The Voice UK, and even replacing Delta during her one-season hiatus in 2014.

Seven picked up the rights for the program after Nine 'failed to renew the contract' for 2021, it was confirmed on Saturday.

In a statement, Seven's CEO and managing director James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'.

James already has changes in mind for the show, with less episodes and a tighter production schedule.

'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter timeframe,' he said.
