Desperate migrants were seen fighting over bottles of water being handed out by volunteers on the Greek island of Lesbos today, amid clashes between protesters and riot police. 

Greek riot police fired tear gas at protesting asylum seekers as tensions simmered following the catastrophic fire that ripped through Europe's largest migrant camp there this week.

The camp housed 12,000 people in a space designed for only 2,800, and local volunteer groups have faced difficulty in supplying asylum seekers with food and water. 

Thousands of asylum seekers have been sleeping rough on Lesbos since Wednesday when the Moria camp was destroyed in apparent arson attacks, with families huddling under blankets and sleeping in doorways or by roads.

Clashes occurred on Saturday noon near a new temporary camp built by Greek authorities where hundreds of young men gathered to protest, some throwing stones at riot police who responded with tear gas.

A fire set there earlier in the day near a police blockade had to be extinguished by the fire brigade.

'Freedom!' said one handwritten sign held up by a protester. 'We want to leave Moria,' said another.

Round-the-clock efforts to find temporary shelter for over 11,000 people made homeless by the destruction of the Moria camp were still inadequate, rights groups said.

'As thousands are now left sleeping rough in the hills around Moria or on the streets, tensions between local residents, asylum seekers, and police are increasing,' Human Rights Watch warned in a statement on Saturday.

The Moria camp, which had been regularly criticised by the UN and rights groups for overcrowding and its dismal sanitary conditions, burned down in successive fires on Tuesday night and Wednesday.

Officials have blamed migrants for the blazes, the first breaking out shortly after 35 people tested positive for coronavirus and were facing isolation measures.

Many of the mostly Afghan asylum seekers have spent months in desperate conditions on the island, hoping in vain to be allowed to cross tightly shut European borders.

Athens has long complained that aside from providing funds, fellow EU members have done too little to help states like Greece and Italy, where most migrants first arrive on European soil

Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi on Saturday said the new camp, a few kilometres (miles) from Moria at a location near the sea, would open later on Saturday with capacity for 3,000 people.

'Rapid tests for coronavirus will be conducted at the entrance,' Mitarachi told Skai TV

Alexandros Ragavas, a spokesman for the migration ministry, said vulnerable asylum seekers would be the first to be housed.

'We will give priority to families. It will be tents of six and the camp will be separated by ethnicities. The process of moving people will start today,' he told AFP news agency.

Yesterday, thousands of migrants left homeless on the Greek island of Lesbos after fires destroyed the overcrowded Moria camp protested against a new refugee camp being built on the island, as Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis confirmed a new facility would be made.

Clapping and chanting songs, the protesters demanding to leave the island were boisterous but peaceful on the road leading to the island's main town.

Some held up signs pleading for help from Germany, a favoured destination for many migrants and refugees who arrive in Greece from the nearby Turkish coast.

But the Greek government announced it would not be 'blackmailed' by the protesters and has no plans to relocate them away from the island.

Director of the Greek Migration Minister's office, Konstantinos Kostakos, said around 1,000 migrants would be temporarily relocated onto a ship that has docked at Sigri, on the western side of the island.

He told CNN: 'This is the first ship that has docked on the island. If there is a need we will consider bringing more.'

'The Greek government will not be blackmailed. What happened - this 'burn and go' tactic - will not be tolerated.'

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis demanded more 'active' participation from the EU in housing the migrantas he said Athens will rebuild the notoriously overcrowded camp destroyed by fire.

'A new facility will be needed... it will be done... (but) the management model must be different,' Mitsotakis said after meeting with European Commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas in Athens.

'We will discuss the maximum European participation in this effort. European solidarity cannot be limited to managing a crisis.'

Athens has long complained that aside from providing funds, fellow EU members have done too little to help states like Greece and Italy, where most migrants first arrive on European soil.

Mitsotakis said: 'We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past... it's not just a concern of Greece and other states on outer (EU) borders to manage this problem.' 

The refugees slept in car parks and petrol stations last night after Greece's largest refugee camp burned down - with locals setting up roadblocks to stop a new one being built. 

Hungry families slept on roadsides and in fields across the island after the Moria camp was reduced to a mass of smouldering steel and melted tent tarpaulin following successive blazes on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Some who fled the fires have tested positive for Covid-19 after an outbreak of the disease in the camp, further complicating attempts to round up migrants and get them into alternative accommodation.

Trucks were yesterday blocking access to the ruins of the camp to prevent a clean-up operation that would make way for new tents. 

'Now is the time to shut down Moria for good,' said Vangelis Violatzis, a local municipal leader. 'We don't want another camp, and we will oppose any construction work. We've faced this situation for five years, it's time for others to bear this burden.' 

Greece's government says the fire was started deliberately by asylum seekers protesting against quarantine measures at the camp, and is calling for Europe to share the burden of housing the migrants. 

Angela Merkel's interior minister Horst Seehofer said today that that 10 EU countries had agreed to take in some of the 406 unaccompanied children at the camp, with most of them set to go to France or Germany.

The fire late on Tuesday at Moria camp, Greece's main migrant facility, sent thousands fleeing for safety into surrounding olive groves.

'We've lost everything, we were abandoned, without food, water or medicine,' said Fatma Al-Hani, a Syrian woman who barely had time to grab her identity papers before the flames engulfed the camp. 

Gaelle Koukanee, a pregnant 21-year-old Congolese refugee, said the police had fired tear gas during the operation to extinguish the fire.

'We have children, old people, disabled among us. Why this lack of humanity?' she asked, seeking shelter from the beating sun under an olive tree.

While nobody was seriously hurt, the Tuesday blaze destroyed the official part of the camp, which housed 4,000 people, ministers said.

A second fire broke out late on Wednesday, destroying most of the remaining camp where another 8,000 lived in tents and makeshift shacks around the perimeter. 

Another fire briefly broke out inside the camp on Thursday.

The minors in the Moria camp have been flown off Lesbos island and rehoused in 'safe' facilities in northern Greece, Athens said, adding that all had been tested for the coronavirus.

Migration minister Notis Mitarachi said that asylum seekers had started the fire because of quarantine measures imposed after 35 people at the camp tested positive for coronavirus. 

Some who fled the fires on Tuesday and Wednesday night later tested positive for Covid-19, complicating attempts to round up migrants and get them into alternative accommodation.

Asylum seekers find shelter outside a petrol station on Lesbos, with talks underway in Europe on how to re-settle the migrants

Riot police units were brought to the port of Mytilene in Lesbos early this morning following Tuesday's fire  

Earlier this year, a plan to build a new camp on Lesbos stalled after locals clashed with riot police to prevent the construction. 

'We lacked toilets, showers and as women, we were afraid to walk at night. But now I'm even more worried about my future,' Koukanee, the Congolese refugee, said. 

Greek officials have declared a four-month emergency on the island and flew in extra riot police. 

Germany and France on Thursday agreed on an initiative for EU states to share out some 400 minors from the camp, a source close to the talks told AFP.

'As a preliminary step we are offering to Greece to accept refugees who are minors - other steps must follow,' German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a panel discussion in Berlin.

The European Union must 'assume more shared responsibility' for migration policy, Merkel said.

Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis wants that kind of sentiment transformed into action.

'Europe must move from words of solidarity to a policy of acts of solidarity,' he said at a summit of Mediterranean leaders in Corsica. 

'We have to put the migration crisis at the heart of our discussions and be much more concrete,' he said.

Two Greek navy vessels would provide additional sleeping space, the migration ministry said. 

The Netherlands offered to take in 100 of the migrants, half of them minors.

European Commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas, who visited Lesbos on Thursday, said they had organised the transfer of 400 unaccompanied minors to the mainland with a view to their relocation in Europe.

'And in the next few hours, there will be ships financed by the European Union to provide shelter to those vulnerable, more-in-need,' he said.   

Since becoming one of the main gateways into Europe for migrants and asylum seekers in 2015, Greece has built dozens of detention centres around the country.

But with other European nations accepting only a small trickle of refugees, thousands remain trapped in the Greek camps in usually dismal health conditions. 

Greece's conservative government has also toughened its asylum restrictions, slashing cash benefits and accommodation provisions to discourage further migration.

'This is Europe?' asked Fatma, clutching her two-year-old son.

'I've had enough, I just want my baby to grow up in peace,' she said, breaking down in tears.

A military helicopter transfers packages with tents in order to make an improvised camp for homeless refugees

People set up tents in order to set up a makeshift camp for homeless refugees to the shooting range of Kara Tepe today 

Local volunteer groups have faced difficulty in supplying asylum seekers with food and water.

'We are sleeping in the dirt or on the road under the open sky,' a group of migrants from the former camp said on Facebook, noting that some people had even found shelter under the trees of the local Greek cemetery.

Sleeping on the roadside and in parking lots, men, women and children have made use of whatever they can find in nearby fields, pinning tarpaulins on tree branches and reeds in a bid for privacy and protection from the beating sun.

The local mayor has rejected efforts to build new temporary camps as 'unrealistic' and residents have tried to stop the construction of new camps by setting up roadblocks.

Army and fire service helicopters have been used to bypass the barriers.

'Any thought to rebuild this sort of thing should be forgotten,' Mytilene Mayor Stratis Kytelis told Antenna TV on Friday.

'The island's society cannot take any more... for reasons of health, social cohesion, national security,' Kytelis said.

The plight of the stranded families has prompted other European countries to offer to take in hundreds of asylum seekers, particularly unaccompanied youngsters.

But Greece has long complained that, aside from providing funds, its EU partners have done too little to help.

Efforts in the past to create a quota system, which would have seen all European countries agree to take in refugees from Greece, have floundered due to opposition from right-wing governments, in particular in Poland and Hungary.

'Moria is the Europe we need to change. High time for a truly European Migration Policy,' European Commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas tweeted Thursday after visiting the island.

'The fires highlight the failure of the European Union's 'hotspot approach' on (Greek) islands, which has led to the containment of thousands of people... with the aim of returning them to Turkey, from which they transited,' HRW said.

'Some EU members have voiced agreement to relocate limited numbers of asylum seekers from Lesbos, but the EU response is hardly adequate or united'.
