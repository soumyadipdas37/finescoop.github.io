Neil Jones is at the centre of marriage rumours after his new girlfriend called him her 'husband'. 

The Strictly pro, 38, only went public with girlfriend Luisa Jones née Eusse a month ago, but there have since been clues that the couple have secretly tied the knot.

Just last month, Luisa, 23, shocked when she revealed she had taken his surname Jones and doubled down by calling him her 'husband' on Thursday.   

Wedding bells? Neil Jones is at the centre of marriage rumours after his new girlfriend Luisa  Eusse called him her 'husband' in a gushing post 

Alongside striking photographs taken on a couples' photoshoot, Luisa penned a passionate post in Spanish in which she claimed Cupid had brought them together.

She penned: 'How crazy, but how nice to have found my love, both vibrating in the same tunes, so strong and so pure, that Cupid stopped when he saw us go by, we created music and fire just by looking at each other and you made me feel safe while sliding my hands through your red hair.

'Love is blind, you may physically fit in with anyone, but the soul does not smile or vibrate with anyone, it is true that beauty attracts, but when one day you write his name to fill the gaps in the notebook without realising it, that's feeling.

'Thank you for your beautiful, free and sensible love and I could tell you that any place is my home, only if you are the one who opens the door ♥ ️ Love u Husband.' 

MailOnline has contacted Neil's representatives for comment.
