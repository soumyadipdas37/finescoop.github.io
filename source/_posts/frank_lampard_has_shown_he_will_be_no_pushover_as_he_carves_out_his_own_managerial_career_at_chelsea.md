Once closest of allies, now rival and sniping managers.

With the traffic one largely one way and heading towards Tottenham's goal, a touchline spat between Jose Mourinho and Frank Lampard was one of the first-half highlights.

Not long after the other, Timo Werner's first Chelsea goal, a war of words broke out on the sidelines.

One by-product of the empty stadiums is the exchanges between players, managers and officials now being much easier to pick up.

'F****** hell Frank, when you're losing 3-0 you're not standing up here,' Mourinho said, in one of the most cutting verbal blows.

Mourinho also indicated Lampard was talking too much as tempers flared. The Chelsea manager bit back but, in the main, smiled it off.

He could do at the time with his side well in control of proceedings, unlike on Saturday at West Brom when his side were 3-0 down and being humiliated at the Hawthorns before a second-half fightback, the game Mourinho referred to.

Lampard's Mourinho spat brought back memories of his X-rated clash with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp at Anfield towards the end of last season.

What is clear from both is that as he carves out his own managerial career Lampard will be no pushover.

Some of his players such as Antonio Rudiger and Marcos Alonso, both omitted after getting on the wrong side of Lampard, will vouch for that.

So too will Mourinho, now, as well as Klopp.

Tuesday night was the latest evidence that Lampard will stand his ground against anyone, regardless of how glittering their CV is or experienced they are.

Lampard owes much of his success as a player to Mourinho.

In one of their first conversations following Mourinho's 2004 appointment as Chelsea manager he famously approached a naked Lampard in the shower and told him he was the best player in the world.

He wasn't at the time but developed into one of them under Mourinho, becoming one of his most loyal soldiers during the Special One's trophy-laden first spell in charge at Stamford Bridge.

But after Lampard scored against Chelsea in 2014, having quit Mourinho's Chelsea and returning to face them with Manchester City, the latter declared 'the love story is over.'

Those good times the pair once shared looked like they counted for little when they locked horns in the heat of the moment.

There was some low-level sniping in the build-up too.

Lampard had little sympathy for Spurs' punishing schedule, highlighting how they got a bye to this round and night off last Tuesday due to Leyton Orient's coronavirus crisis.

Ahead of the game he also laughed off Mourinho's claims he didn't have enough bodies to name a strong team.

But Lampard has shown again that he will not stand down against Mourinho or anyone else

After picking a striker-less side, meanwhile, Mourinho made a reference, perhaps aimed at big-spending Chelsea, to Spurs having to adopt a different approach to recruiting a new striker.

What really mattered was who did their talking on the pitch. The pair did make peace, shaking hands before the shootout which decided this tie.

And there was, no doubt, some extra satisfaction for master Mourinho as he had the last word, outwitting pupil Lampard for the first time in four attempts.
