Whilst a holiday abroad remains a distant dream for most of us, Princess Diana's niece Lady Kitty Spencer is continuing to enjoy a lavish holiday in Italy.

The society beauty, 29, proved her fashion prowess once again when spotted in Rome yesterday, wearing a black and white polka dot frock.

Featuring a dazzling collar with tassel detailing, the eye-catching dress was brought in at the waist to highlight the model's slender frame.

She recently put on a loved-up display with fiancé £80million fashion tycoon Michael Lewis as they shopped for rings in Florence.

Boasting attention-grabbing cuffs and shimmering silver buttons, Kitty made sure to steal the spotlight with her statement frock during her walk in the city.

Showing off a smooth complexion, Kitty sported a sleeked back hair-do while opting for dainty earrings and black sandals.

She completed her stunning outfit with a navy shoulder bag and carried a red sack in her sun-kissed arms.

Her outing in Italy - where she's been holidaying over the summer - comes after her recent loved-up display with fiancé £80million fashion tycoon Michael Lewis as they shopped for rings in Florence.

The society model reportedly got engaged to Michael, 61, who is 32 years her senior and five years older than her father Earl Spencer, after her partner proposed in Cape Town over Christmas. 

Lady Kitty and Michael went public with their relationship during a stroll through New York in May and were seen kissing after leaving Club 55 in St Tropez in August.  

An expert previously revealed that the society model was wearing a 30 carat diamond engagement ring worth an estimated £300,000.  .

Speaking to MailOnline, appraiser Oliver Horner from Prestige Pawnbrokers of Channel 4's Posh Paw, said: 'This gorgeous full hoop diamond full band engagement ring is of extremely high quality.

'The full band is set with large emerald cut diamonds, each stone looks to be approximately one and a half carats and I would estimate the total diamond weight of the ring to be between 25 and 30 carats. 

'Judging from the image the diamonds look to be of exceptional quality and I estimate a clarity grade to be between flawless and VVS1 and to be of D to F colour which is the very best.

'I believe a ring of this exceptional quality would have an would cost between £200,000 - £300,000 maybe even more given the provenance of such a piece.'

Princess Diana's niece jetted off to the French Riviera earlier this month and has now made her way to Italy, where she has enjoyed the views of a volcanic crater south of Rome, visited the town of Nemi and toured the Pope's summer palace. Pictured, in Nemi in a £1,750 D&G dress

Kitty grew up in Cape Town and spent Christmas, her birthday and New Year's Eve in South Africa, where Michael is also based.

Michael has three adult children and was previously married to a woman named Leola in 1985.

Kitty, who was spotted at the tycoon’s £19million mansion in central London last summer, told the Mail at the time that she didn’t feel 'in any rush' to start a family.

'I can see myself having children at some point... but I'm only in my twenties. I do have friends my age who are having children, and they are so, so, sweet, but I think everyone should do things in their own time,' she said.

Lewis' previous wife, Leola, 59, signed a prenuptial agreement but it's not yet known whether Lady Kitty will do the same.
