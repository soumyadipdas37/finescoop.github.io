The TV executive and presenter was chairman of the scandal-hit charity as it headed for financial meltdown despite receiving almost £50 million of taxpayers’ cash
The BBC’s Alan Yentob could be barred from screens this autumn due to a legal wrangle over the controversial Kids Company charity
The TV executive and presenter was chairman of the scandal-hit charity as it headed for financial meltdown despite receiving almost £50 million of taxpayers’ cash
Now, five years after The Mail on Sunday made a string of revelations including how Kids Company spent tens of thousands of pounds of public money helping migrants to remain in the country and claim benefits, Mr Yentob faces a court case brought by the Insolvency Service from October 12
The 73-year-old, who is thought to earn more than £200,000 a year for his work on the BBC’s arts programme Imagine, is among seven charity managers who could face three-year bans from being company directors
Corporation insiders argue his involvement in the high-profile legal action means that he should not appear on screen during the ten-week hearing
Others due to give evidence are Kids Company’s chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh 
The organisation, which helped troubled children in South London, was given huge subsidies over almost 20 years – including £73 million in the five months before it folded in 2015
Among the revelations, the charity arranged for one of its clients to have private sex-change surgery
It emerged that Ms Batmanghelidjh had a ‘personal private swimming pool’ in a £5,000-a-month mansion paid for from charity funds

It was also alleged that thousands went on the boarding school costs of a chauffeur’s daughter 
And we also showed how Mr Yentob, who reportedly has a £63 million BBC pension, secretly lobbied the Labour government over an unpaid £700,000 tax bill which was later waived at public expense
A Charity Commission report into Kids Company cannot be published until the court case is over 
The Insolvency Service is pushing for a six-year ban on Ms Batmanghelidjh from being a company director
In 2018, one former director, Sunetra Atkinson – the ex-wife of actor Rowan Atkinson – was banned for more than two years because of her role in the scandal
Last night, a former Kids Company employee said ‘Many ex-Kids Company staff still haven’t been paid wages they are owed, while Alan Yentob and the others have carried on with their lives quite happily
'Now they’re spending even more public money fighting this case It’s disgraceful’
Last night, both Mr Yentob and the BBC declined to comment
