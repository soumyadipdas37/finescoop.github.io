Jackie and Adam met in 1998 on the set of Big Daddy and married five years later in Malibu at the oceanfront property of the late Dick Clark.

Adam can next be seen in the Netflix comedy Hubie Halloween that he also co-wrote and co-produced.

The film takes place in Salem, Massachusetts and follows eccentric Hubie DuBois, played by Adam, as he finds himself at the center of a murder case on Halloween night.

The film also features Kevin James, Julie Bowen, Maya Rudolph, Ray Liotta, Steve Buscemi, Rob Schneider, Kenan Thompson, Tim Meadows and Colin Quinn.
