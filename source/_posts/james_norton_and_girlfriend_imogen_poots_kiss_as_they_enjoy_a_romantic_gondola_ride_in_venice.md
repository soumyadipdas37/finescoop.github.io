They were seen gracing the red carpet at the Venice Film Festival premiere of his new film, Nowhere Special.

And James Norton and his girlfriend Imogen Poots were spotted making the most of their time in the picturesque Italian city over the weekend, as they enjoyed a full day of sightseeing.

James, 35, was seen hugging and kissing his 31-year-old partner as they went for a romantic gondola ride through the famous canals, amid a day of taking pictures of sights.

The actor was casually cool for the fun-filled day out, donning a white graphic T-shirt, which he teamed with light jeans and a pair of retro style trainers.

Toting a large black bag, the screen star carried an SLR camera, which he was seen holding aloft on numerous occasions to take snaps of their breathtaking surroundings.

Imogen put on a stylish display for their day in the sunshine, donning a white crop top, which she paired with a flowing patterned green skirt.

Also opting for old school style footwear, which she wore with beige socks, the Vivarium star carried a large maroon bag as they wandered over the city's many bridges.

Wearing her golden brown tresses in a chic blue headband, the west London native shielded her eyes from the late summer sunshine with a pair of oversized shades.

As well as enjoying the sights, the lovebirds also indulged in some of the city's best culinary offerings, as they settled in for lunch on the balcony of a popular eatery.

Later in the day, James had a quick change of clothes, reemerging from his accommodation in a crisp white shirt, which he teamed with black trousers.

They confirmed their romance in May 2018, shortly after James split from his girlfriend of two years Jessie Buckley.

James and Imogen met when they co-starred in West End production BelleVille at the Donmar Warehouse, in 2017.

His ex confessed that their break-up was 'acrimonious’ – putting it down partly to the difficulty of dating a fellow actor.

'We have broken up, yes,’ she said. ‘It was acrimonious, but it’s a tough job to have a relationship and he is a great man and we are great friends. That’s it. How diplomatic can I sound?’

Explaining the break-up, Jemma told The Times: ‘If you are away for a year filming, you are just not physically around at points.’ 

James' new project Nowhere Special, for which he travelled to Venice, is an upcoming 2020 internationally co-produced drama film, written, directed, and produced by Uberto Pasolini.

The actor, who plays window cleaner John, dedicates his existence to his three-year-old son after his mother left them soon after she gave birth.

But when John is given just months to live, he sets out to find a perfect family for his little boy once he is gone. 

Amid frenzied speculation about who will be the next to play Bond, with stars including Richard Madden and Idris Elba being linked with the role, a source told the publication both sides were trying 'to get a deal signed off'. 

'Producers wanted a Brit and James ticks all the boxes – tall, strapping, physically fit and, of course, looks great in a dinner jacket.

'Everyone is hoping to get the deal confirmed and signed off, with an announcement in the summer.'
