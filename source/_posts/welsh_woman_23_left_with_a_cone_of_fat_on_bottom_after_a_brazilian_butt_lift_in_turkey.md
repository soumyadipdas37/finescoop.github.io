A young woman has been left with a 'cone' of fat on her bottom after surgery abroad went wrong. 

Shannon Davies, 23, from Pontypridd, Wales, was prompted to go under the knife in Istanbal, Turkey, after seeing online influencers recommend the clinic - which cannot be named for legal reasons.

The salon owner initially forked out £5,000 for a Brazilian Butt lift, breast uplift and augmentation in 2018 but has since returned twice due to shocking results.

Before the 'botched' surgeries, Shannon Davies, 23, from Pontypridd, Wales, was a size 12 (left) but wanted a curvy body to fill out her clothes. Instead, after her Brazilian Butt lift surgery she was left with a 'cone' of fat on her bottom (pictured right)

Shannon, a salon owner, claims the 'botched' surgery she got in Instanbul, Turkey, - after it was recommended by an online influencer - has left her with a 'lumpy' and 'uneven' bottom (pictured)

Shannon pleaded with the surgeon to remove the excess fat from her bottom but woke to find she had undergone another BBL.

She is now forced to wear size 18 trousers as her 'lumpy' and 'uneven' bottom doesn't fit into her old size 12 jeans.

She said: 'I've always been up and down with my weight and my boobs started to sag.

'I had no bum and I just wanted a nice curvy body to fill out my clothes.

'But now I am left with a lumpy bottom and super wide hips because the fat which was injected for the BBL has leaked into my thighs and hips.

'I regret ever going ahead with the surgery but I just wanted a quick fix.

'It seemed like the easy option but I should have just gone to the gym.'

Shannon recalls feeling like she was in an 'oven' when she woke from the first surgery in July 2018.

Shannon now has to wear size 18 trousers to hide her bottom and hates her wide frame after, she claims, the fat injected into her bottom leaked into her hips and thighs

The 23-year-old said she regrets the surgery which has left her with bruising and scarring all over her body. Instead she wishes she had just gone to the gym and not sought out a 'quick fix'

Her nipple was purple and she felt like her chest was going to burst open.

She added: 'I woke up from surgery and I was screaming in pain - it was unbearable.

'I knew something was wrong and I could tell by the look on the surgeons face when he saw my nipple.

'He removed my nipple and left it hanging on by one thread - I am not too sure how this was supposed to help, but I was willing to do anything to avoid losing my nipple.'

Shannon visited her local nurse every two days to have the stitches and dressing changed for four months after the surgery.

She said: 'I couldn't wear a bra because it was so painful and my boobs completely dropped.

When she woke up from her surgery she screamed in pain, her nipple was purple and she felt like her chest was going to burst open.  At one point blood was 'squirting' from her breasts and it was not cleaned up (pictured)

'I wasn't happy at all with the results.

'A cone had formed on the right side of my leg so I asked the clinic if I can have it revised - they eventually agreed after eight months.'

In March 2019, Shannon flew to Turkey again for three days - she requested another uplift and for fat to be removed for her bum.

She claims she was injected three times with general anaesthetic because the dose was initially not enough.

She said: 'The second time was a living nightmare. I was injected in the lift on the way down to theatre but I didn't fall asleep, nor the second time.

'The surgeon told me to get onto the metal bed and then he strapped me down - I was so scared.

After he saw her nipple for the first time after surgery, Shannon said the surgeon removed it and left it hanging on by one thread 

The salon owner said she was in so much pain she couldn't wear a bra and so her breasts, she had augmented as part of the procedure in Turkey, dropped

In March 2019, Shannon flew to Turkey again for three days - she requested another uplift and for fat to be removed for her bum - and she has been left with a lot of scarring as a result

'I wasn't weighed so they didn't determine the appropriate dosage.

'I woke up and my bum was bigger than the first time - he didn't remove the fat as discussed - he filled it again.'

Shannon says her botched surgery has left her with a bruised body and an uneven bottom.

She flew home after three days and could barely look in the mirror because her new body left her 'horrified'.

After complaining, the clinic blocked Shannon on social media so she was left to her own devices to try and find someone to revise it.

Surgeons have refused in the UK where BBL surgery is illegal.

She claims she was injected three times with general anaesthetic for the second procedure, because the dose was initially not enough. When she woke up she found the fat in her bottom had increased instead of decrease. Pictured: Her 'botched' breasts which were left with painful scars

Drains were also not used post-surgery and as a result fat leaked out of her body and onto her clothes, pictured

The company which left Shannon in this way have now blocked her on social media and doctors in the UK cannot help her as Brazilian Butt lifts are illegal

She said: 'I was desperate to have everything removed. I just wanted my old body back.'

In October 2019, Shannon flew back to Turkey for three days to have the implants and fat removed from her bum by the surgeon.

However, she claims she awoke to discover no difference.

She said: 'He took my money and all he did was stitch up my boobs again.

'I have been left with horrendous scarring and barely any confidence.

'I wanted surgery so I can feel good in my own skin, but now I dread summer because I have to cover up.

'My nipples are too high up and my bottom half is too big. I am so embarrassed and wish I had done my research. I should have waited until I was older.'

Shannon urges other women to love their body they way it is and to avoid going abroad at all costs.

With a Brazilian butt lift, fat is taken from various parts of the body and put with the buttocks.

It has grown increasingly popular in the United States, becoming the fastest-growing type of plastic surgery, according to 2015 statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

The rate of buttock lift procedures rose 252 percent from 2000 to 2015. The total went from 1,356 to 4,767 procedures over the course of that time.

Injecting fat into the butt can lead to problems if done improperly, including fat embolism - which is when fat enters the bloodstream and blocks a blood vessel.

The estimated death rate for BBL is 1 in 3000, according to PlasticSurgery.org.
