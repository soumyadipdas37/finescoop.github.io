Australian rapper The Kid LAROI has shot to international stardom since releasing his first single Blessings in 2018. 

And on Friday, the Sydney teenager, 17, released a music video for his track Wrong, in which he cuddles up to American porn star, Lana Rhoades.

The Kid LAROI, who's real name is Charlton Kenneth Jeffrey Howard, is also joined by US rapper Lil Mosey, who drops in for a quick verse.

In the video, the 24-year-old porn star plays a seductive librarian while Laroi and Mosey, 17 and 18, respectively, are mischievous students.  

The Kid LAROI tries to seduce Lana, but she brushes him off before Lil Mosey drives down the school hallway in a golf cart and the rappers start a party in the gym.

The principal then shows up and everyone stops dancing, but the teacher decides to join the party, busting out some moves of his own. 

The Kid LAROI wraps his hands around Lana's waist and the pair gaze into each other's eyes before the camera cuts off.

'Get back to work!' Lana then snaps at The Kid LAROI, finally revealing that the rapper was just day dreaming about her in the library.     

The rapper previously teased the music video three weeks ago with a picture of him and Lana posted to Instagram, captioned: 'YOU BAD AND YOU KNOWWWW IT.' 

It isn't the first time he has shouted out an attractive woman, having recently released a track called Addison Rae, named after the famous TikToker.   

The Kid LAROI was born in Waterloo, Sydney but was raised in Broken Hill in rural NSW before moving back to the city at 11 and starting his music career at just 13. 

Big name! Lana Rhoades is an American porn star with 12.4 million Instagram followers 

He earned his first hit with Blessings in 2018 when he was just 15 and subsequently toured Australia with the late Juice WRLD, who guided The Kid LAROI as his protege. 

The teenager is also an Indigenous artist from the the Kamilaroi people, which is where the name Laroi originates from.  

He released his first commercial mixtape F*ck Love in July and now lives in Los Angeles with his mother and brother.
