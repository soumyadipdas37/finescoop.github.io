MTV is bringing back Teen Mom Australia for a second season this year.

The popular series follows young women who fell pregnant as teenagers as they navigate motherhood.

Original cast members Ammi Chambers, 20, Sita Masima, 20, and Georgina Manios 'Georgie' Manios, 21, are all back, in addition to a brand new mum.

Melbourne mum Tanisha Kandia, 19, and her two-year-old baby daughter Bianca have joined the cast this year.

According to MTV, viewers will follow Tanisha as she navigates difficult relationships with both her ex-partner and her own mum.

'We’re incredibly excited to bring audiences a second season of Teen Mom Australia,' said Helen McMurdo, Senior Director of MTV’s Youth & Entertainment Brands.

'The success of season one saw not only global audiences fall in love with the honest and endearing stories of these strong Australian women.'

Original cast member Georgie Manion revealed last year that she planned to fall pregnant at a young age.

The now 21-year-old says she planned her pregnancy when she fell in love with her first boyfriend John, but now regrets the decision after the pair split following the arrival of their first child.

Speaking to WHO magazine at the time, she recalled how she and her ex, who she shares her daughter Evie with, first met when she was 15 and were 'really in love.'

'The discussions started when I was really young - which was stupid - I think I was 16,' Georgina explained.

It wasn't long before the brunette - who dropped out of high school in year ten - fell pregnant at 17. 

'We were trying for two weeks and I fell pregnant,' she added.
