New South Wales has reported five new coronavirus cases, including one in hotel quarantine and four linked to Sydney's CBD cluster.

One of the new cases enjoyed drinks at Kuleto's Cocktail Bar in Newtown, in Sydney's inner-west, between 6.30pm and 9.30pm on August 28.

Anyone who was at the venue for at least an hour during this period must get tested immediately and isolate until midnight on September 11, even if their test result is negative.

The venue has been closed for cleaning. 

The CBD cluster has now grown to 61 cases. 

A healthcare professional has also tested positive for COVID-19 - however NSW Health said  in a statement that case will be reported in Sunday's figures. 

The health professional worked two shifts while they were potentially infections - including one at Concord Hospital emergency department on September 1.

The worker was on shift between 2pm and midnight.

They also worked at Liverpool Hospital's emergency department on September 3 from 8am to 6pm.  

The medical professional became unwell on September 4 and immediately got tested and isolated.

They wore full personal protective equipment at all times while in contact with patients and a surgical mask at all other times.

'All patients and staff members who were in contact with the health professional are being contacted and advised to get tested and self-isolate,' NSW Health said.

There were 30,339 coronavirus tests conducted in the last 24 hours, with 94 cases being treated by NSW.

Six people are currently being treated in the intensive care unit.

People in the Sydney Metropolitan, Nepean Blue Mountains and Central Coast regions are urged not to visit loved ones in aged care facilities.    

'This decision has been reached after careful consideration of the risks of COVID-19 being introduced into an aged care facility while the CBD cluster is brought under control,' NSW Health said.

'While we understand and acknowledge this will be difficult for many families on Father’s Day, our priority is to prevent the spread of the virus to the most vulnerable people in the community.'
