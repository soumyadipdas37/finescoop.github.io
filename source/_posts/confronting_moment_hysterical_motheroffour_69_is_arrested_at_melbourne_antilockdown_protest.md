Confronting footage has emerged of a 69-year-old dog walker screaming hysterically as six police officers detained her during an anti-lockdown protest.  

The video shows the mother-of-four being arrested at Elsternwick Park, 10km southeast of Melbourne's CBD, on Saturday.

'Give me my phone!' the woman can be heard yelling she is surrounded by several officers.

Two officers then pull her hands behind her back to handcuff her.

'Keep your hands behind your back, you're under arrest,' an officer orders.

The grandmother begins wailing 'no' and attempting to briskly walk away from police before she is cornered at a fence and handcuffed.

She is then escorted to another area of the park to speak with officers, who remove the cuffs and hand her a penalty notice.  

Speaking to the videographer following the incident, she broke down in tears.

'It hurt,' she says.

'I have never been treated like this in my life.'

The woman then collapsed on the ground and curled into a ball crying.

Up to 150 people gathered in the city's southeast on Saturday to protest against Melbourne's Stage Four restrictions. 

Victoria Police issued 21 fines and arrested 16 demonstrators as up to 150 people clashed with officers during the rallies. 

Law enforcement teams circled Elsternwick Park included officers from Public Order Response, the Mounted Unit, Air Unit and Highway Patrol. 

Multiple demonstrations have taken place in Melbourne over the past few weekends as conspiracy theorists, COVID-19 deniers, and fed-up residents call for the end of lockdown. 

On Sunday, a small group of demonstrators gathered in Chadstone Shopping Centre to sing John Farnham's 'You're The Voice' before dispersing minutes later as Public Order Response Teams arrived on the scene. 

The protest, which organisers had originally touted as the 'biggest ever' with around 700 people tipped to be in attendance, dissolved in less than five minutes and resulted in two arrests and six fines.
