Channel Nine have confirmed Love Island Australia will return in 2021.

With coronavirus restrictions halting overseas travel and production, the reality TV show was in fear of being axed.

However, during Nine's Upfronts on Wednesday, the network revealed the series will film in a villa on Queensland's Gold Coast.

Love Island Australia is produced by ITV Studios Australia, and it's previous two seasons have been filmed in Spain and Fiji.

It's unclear if Sophie Monk will be returning as the host of the dating series, but her name did come up elsewhere in the announcements.

Nine have announced the exciting reboot of Beauty And The Geek - which Sophie will host. It last aired on Channel Seven in 2014.

The new Beauty and the Geek promises to deliver laughs, tears and everything in between as two groups of people from completely different worlds are set to collide.





 

After a six-year hiatus from screens, Nine has also chosen to reboot Celebrity Apprentice Australia.

The first three celebrities announced for the lineup are celebrity trainer Michelle Bridges, Nova host Nova Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli, and Olympic gymnast Olivia Vivian.

They will be vying to become the next Celebrity Apprentice by impressing and avoiding the dreaded words 'you're fired!' from British billionaire and business magnate, Lord Alan Sugar.   

 

Fans will be pleased to know that The Block, Married At First Sight, Lego Masters and Australia Ninja Warrior have also all been renewed by Nine for 2021.

MAFS will return for its eighth season, bringing with it a new expert. 

Certified clinical sexologist with over 20 years’ experience, Alessandra Rampolla, will bring her expertise in sexology and join resident experts John Aiken and Mel Schilling to pair 20 brave singles from across Australia. 

'With my particular expertise, I hope to contribute to the complex mix of components that ensure marriages not only work but thrive in the long haul. One of my strongest core beliefs is that sexual expression and compatibility are vital in building, nourishing and maintaining healthy romantic relationships, and it is my pleasure to help guide our participants in balancing this important factor in their brave quest for love,' Alessandra said in a media statement issued by Nine.

Popular drama Doctor Doctor will also return for another season.
