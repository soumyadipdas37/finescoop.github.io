Hugh Jackman and wife Deborra-Lee Furness stepped out for a walk in New York City on Thursday.

The pair put safety first as they wore face masks while strolling with their dogs, Dali and Allegra. 

Wolverine actor Hugh, 51, and his actress-wife, 64, were both dressed casually for their walk and chatted happily during the outing.

At one point the couple appeared to be distracted by something on Hugh's iPhone.

The Greatest Showman star held up the device as Deb leaned to see what all the fuss was about. 

For the outing, Hugh wore comfortable sneakers, black sweatpants and a grey sweater that read 'East Hampton Gym'.

Meanwhile, Deborra-lee opted for her usual all-black ensemble and added to her look with pink sneakers and a light blue mask.

The couple and their children Ava, 14, and Oscar, 20, recently returned to New York from their stunning holiday home in the Hamptons. 

In July, Hugh revealed he was homesick for Australia after a lengthy lockdown in New York City due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Deborra-lee and the couple's children, Oscar and Ava, had initially been in Melbourne when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March.

But they returned to the U.S. just four days later in order to keep the family together.

Later this month, Hugh will virtually attend The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

He is one of five nominees up for an Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Limited TV series or Movie for his role as Frank Tassone in Bad Education. 

'I'm humbled by the nominations for both me and the film and excited to be named with such a talented group of actors,' Hugh said in a statement at the time. 

Due to the global health crisis, the Emmy Awards will be a bit different this year. 

Jimmy Kimmel will host the show from a stage inside California's Staples Center, which will have no red carpet or audience, Variety reported last month.
