Last week, the cook revealed the bub was already overdue - joking that her baby has 'bad habits' and is tardy like their mother.

In an Instagram post shared on Saturday, the star shared a selfie in which she flaunted her baby bump.  

She wrote in the caption: 'Y'all I'm still here! Baby is late (like its mother to a meeting). Father unimpressed with bad habits already starting in utero!' 

Excited: Ash announced that she was expecting her first child with Peter (pictured) on her HIT 101.3 breakfast show in March 

Ash recently revealed she learned she was expecting while on the set of Seven's All New Monty: Guys and Gals.  

She told The Daily Telegraph: 'I had no idea I was pregnant and I was so sick… just absolutely so ill during the filming of that show, I can't even tell you.' 

In between rehearsals for the strip show and early starts on Sea FM, the radio host thought she was just exhausted. 

'I get up for breakfast radio every morning and was absolutely burning the candle at both ends, so I just thought it was that,' Ash said. 

Instead of pulling out of the show, Ash soldiered on, saying: 'I just thought, 'whatever, this is a great experience. Whatever is happening to you now is not that debilitating, just work through it', which I did.'  

Ash announced tat she was expecting her first child with Peter on her HIT 101.3 breakfast show in March. 

The chef and former cooking show star has been dating the builder since 2017.
