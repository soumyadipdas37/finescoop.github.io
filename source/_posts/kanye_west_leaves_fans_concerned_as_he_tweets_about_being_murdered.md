Kanye West lefts fans concerned on Friday as he shared a disturbing tweet about being murdered and having his eldest daughter taken away from him.

The 43-year-old rapper, whose mental health issues have been well documented, posted and then deleted the disturbing message - which was addressed to daughter North, seven - early on Friday morning. 

'NORTHY I AM GOING TO WAR AND PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE AND IF I AM MURDERED DON'T EVER LET WHITE MEDIA TELL YOU I WASNT A GOOD MAN... WHEN PEOPLE THREATEN TO TAKE YOU OUT OF MY LIFE JUST KNOW I LOVE YOU.' the designer wrote.

Along with the message Kanye shared a photo of North looking playful and throwing up two peace signs.

Although the Faded hitmaker quickly deleted the post, concerned fans rallied round to express their fears for the star. 

'We saw your deleted tweet. You need help from doctors, family and friends. this is not going to end well without that. first doctors.' One user wrote.

'He needs help ya'll. Real Help. Stop feeding into this.:(' came another concerned message.

Concerning behavior: The rapper is seen here on Wednesday leaving youth services at Yeezy Christian Academy in Calabasas

Kanye's concerning post came after his latest Twitter rant which got him suspended for 24 hours by the microblogging site earlier this week.

The All Day hitmaker shared a video of himself urinating on his Grammy Awards and has posted a string of messages about his battle with record labels Universal and Sony - including screenshots of his contracts with the former.   

On Wednesday, the rapper had also been forced by Twitter to remove a post featuring the phone number of Forbes' Chief Content Officer, Randall Lane. 

Once the suspension was lifted the rapper was tweeting again on Thursday, taking aim at the music industry and calling on artists to unite to change the system.

Meanwhile, Kanye is still getting support from wife Kim Kardashian as they try to work through their marriage issues amid concerns for his mental health.

'Kim is holding onto her marriage with Kanye and knows that he bipolar and struggling with his mental health and wants to be there for him and help.' a source told US Weekly.

The Keeping With The Kardashians star knows and is aware that her husband struggles with his mental health, so she wants him to know she is doing her best to empathize.

'She is continuing to support him and does her best to understand him and where he is coming from. She knows he is unconventional and has always known that.'

Kanye first acknowledged his bipolar disorder in 2018, a condition that is associated with episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs and can be controlled with medication.

Kim hinted last month that his struggle with bipolar was to blame for his recent erratic behavior, that has seen him embark on the unlikely bid for presidency and get emotional at his first campaign rally in South Carolina while discussing abortion.

Two months ago, the Runaway hitmaker ruthlessly lambasted Kim and her famous family on Twitter.

During the aggressive tirade, Kanye alleged that Kim was trying to 'bring a doctor to lock [him] up' and compared her mother Kris Jenner to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

He even admitted to his followers that he had been trying to divorce Kim for two years.

Kanye later apologized to his online audience and to Kim for the out of line tweets and he has since left talk of his marriage off social media.

Kanye and Kim wed in 2014 and share four children together, daughters North, seven, and Chicago, two, and sons Saint, five, and Psalm, one.
