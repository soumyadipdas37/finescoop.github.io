She was forced to celebrate Father's Day without her husband Lance 'Buddy' Franklin, who is currently locked down at an AFL hub in Queensland.  

But Jesinta Franklin made sure not to spend the milestone occasion alone, recruiting her younger sister Aleysha to keep her company instead.  

Appearing somewhat sombre, Jesinta was spotted pushing her six-month-old daughter Tullulah while strolling around Bondi with Aleysha.

The former Miss Universe Australia revealed a glimpse at her model physique in a black scoop-neck skivvy and black leggings. 

Going makeup-free, Jesinta completed her outfit with white runners, acetate sunglasses and a grey jumper which she tied around her waist. 

At one stage, the glamazon stopped pushing the stroller to check on little Tulluah inside.

The doting mother smiled sweetly at the tot, who was swaddled in blankets and shaded beneath the stroller's sleep cover. 

Elsewhere on Sunday, Jestina posted an Instagram photo of her Sydney Swans star husband pushing Tullulah's pram, alongside a bitter-sweet Father's Day tribute. 

Jesinta captioned the image: 'Happy 1st Father's Day @buddy_franklin23 . So sad we can't be with you today, we are sending lots of virtual cuddles via FaceTime.
