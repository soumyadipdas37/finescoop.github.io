Angus Robertson made the comments in an article for the pro-independence The National newspaper

The former leader of the SNP in Westminster faced furious calls to apologise after claiming that the deaths of elderly Scots would benefit the independence movement.  

Angus Robertson, who worked closely with Nicola Sturgeon - including as her deputy - until losing his Moray seat in a shock result in 2017, made the comments in an article for the pro-independence The National newspaper.

He highlighted the growth in support for independence since the 2014 referendum in which the country voted 55-45 to remain in the UK.

'This could be in significant part because of the underlying change in the electorate, with roughly 55,000 predominantly ''Yes'' supporting 16-year-olds joining the electorate and 55,000 predominantly ''No'' supporting older voters passing away every year,' he wrote.

'Since 2014, this has added around 330,000 voters to the electorate, with a likely net gain of over 100,000 for independence.'

His comments were attacked by Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, who took Mr Robertson's seat from him in 2017.

It came after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer (left, yesterday with wife Victoria) said he was 'frustrated' over talks of a new Scottish independence referendum.

He said: 'Disgraceful and deeply disappointing comments from Angus Robertson. Suggesting that the most vulnerable age group, who have been hardest hit through the tragic loss of so many lives throughout the pandemic, are a boost to his independence obsession. A new low for the SNP.'

And Labour SNP Monica Lennon said: 'The man tipped as a successor to Nicola Sturgeon thought this was OK. Not OK.'

Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Sir Keir said that the SNP Government in Holyrood should be focusing on the Covid-19 pandemic.

He told Sky News: 'I think another independence referendum will be divisive and that's why the Labour Party will be campaigning into the May elections on the economy, rebuilding the economy, on ensuring our public services are in the right place and defeating coronavirus.

'I'm frustrated in a sense that in the middle of a pandemic we've got the SNP talking about independence, we've got the Tory party talking about Brexit when, in my view, they should be focusing on pulling together to defeat the virus.

'One of the things I think will take many, many people by surprise is that there hasn't been a Cobra meeting for months.'

This comes as a series of polls have found a majority of Scots now support independence.

The latest poll, by Survation, found 53 per cent of people were in favour of independence, with 47 per cent against.

In August, a similar poll run by Panelbase showed support at 55 per cent.

Asked whether there should be a second independence referendum if the SNP win a majority in the next election, Sir Keir said: 'The Labour Party will be campaigning into May on the basis that what we don't want is another divisive referendum.'
