A daughter tries to reign in her vivacious mum who wants to look 'boobalicious' on her wedding day in Say Yes To The Dress Lancashire.

In tonight's episode of the TLC show, vivacious bride-to-be Wendy, 60, arrives at the Ava Rose Hamilton boutique looking for a revealing, showstopping dress to say 'I do' to.

Determined not be defined by her age, Wendy is after something sexy with plenty of wow factor - much to the dismay of her daughter, Lucy, 

'I have a verve for life and I'm not ready to hang my heels up yet,' she explains. 'As you get older it becomes more difficult to be, if you like, "age appropriate."'

Turning to super stylist Gok Wan, Wendy tells him exactly what she wants. 

'I'm after something boobilicous,' she smiles cheekily. 'I won't be wearing a pie crust!'

But Wendy's entourage, including her daughter Lucy, want Wendy in something more demure for her big day. 

'My role today is to make sure that she doesn't show off too much cleavage,' says Lucy. 'If she wears something too revealing, you will be able to see it on my face straight away! I don't want her to look trashy with too much boob out!' 

Back to the matter at hand, the bride-to-be makes it crystal clear to Gok what she doesn't want to look like walking down the aisle.

'I'm terrified of looking like Pepper Pig's mother!' she says, much to Gok's bemusement. 'She's not the tiniest girl on the planet. She's quite shapeless and rotund!' 

Looking to get the show on the road, the super stylist takes Wendy upstairs to begin trying on dresses.

And for the bride-to-be, dress number one is just what the doctor ordered, with plenty of sparkle and with a low neckline. Instantly, Wendy's trust in Gok is vindicated. 

'Gok does seem to understand that I want lots of bling and sparkle and crystals,' she says. 

With the dress on, Wendy feels like a million dollars. 

'It's fabulous, I've actually got into a wedding gown and I can't believe it. Gorgeous!' she smiles. 'I'm feeling like a Princess already, I just hope everyone else thinks the same.' 

Walking out in front of her entourage, Wendy radiates confidence. Asked by Gok if the there's enough boob on show, she declares 'you can never say too much can you.'

With bated breath, the bride-to-be awaits her entourage's feedback. 

'I like it, it's figure-hugging but it's not too tight on her tummy so I think that's going to give her more confidence straight away,' Lucy says to Wendy's surprise. 

But for friend Jan, it's not the cut of the dress that's the problem, but the colour. 

In agreement, the bride-to-be's other friend Wendy bluntly says 'It's just not doing it for me at all. Less it more!' 

Impressed by the dress's elegance, Wendy excitedly agrees to try it on. But once the gown is on, she is less than impressed. Pictured, in gown two

Taking the entourage's feedback onboard, Gok decides to try Wendy in something more paired back and Hollywood, presenting Wendy with a glamorous gown with lacy sleeves. 

Impressed by the dress's elegance, Wendy excitedly agrees to try it on. But once the gown is on, Wendy is less than impressed. 

'This dress doesn't make me feel anything at all,' she says, underwhelmed. 'It makes me feel old! I'm looking for something sassy and really fabulous and this just doesn't meet the criteria.' 

But in stark contrast, Lucy thinks her mum is onto a winner. 'You just look like a bride,' Lucy says. 'I think it's ticking boxes that you want you dress to tick, it is lovely!' 

But fighting Wendy's corner, Jan argues that the more traditional look isn't necessarily the right look. 'It doesn't knock me out, I'm thinking the dress is way too plain for Wendy's personality.' 

With her entourage divided, Wendy has a dilemma on her hands.

Wanting to find the sweet spot between dresses one and two, Gok senses that Wendy is leaning towards something with a tighter, racier fit and with more wow-factor. 

The bride-to-be is delighted with dress three and says it's 'mouth-wateringly glitzy and sparkly, red carpet stuff!' (pictured)

Wendy isn't the only one delighted with dress number three (pictured) - her daughter Lucy and entourage are equally as elated 

And, with dress number three, Gok thinks he's hit the nail on the head. 

'There is not another gown in this boutique that has this level of sparkle,' he says triumphantly, showing Wendy dress number three. 

'It's mouth-wateringly glitzy and sparkly, red carpet stuff!' she beams. 

With the dress on, Gok helps Wendy to realise her inner Joan Collins, the perfect balance between sassy and sophisticated! 

'Oh wow, magnificent! It makes me feel like a film star,' Wendy says gleefully. 'I feel fabulous, sassy, sexy, full of fun and it's just so me!' 

With a few bits of lace added onto the dress, it's time for Wendy to show her entourage. 

Will dress three be a winner or is it back to the drawing board? Happily, third time is the charm for Wendy, and her entourage are blown away! 

All smiles, Lucy gushes over how breathtakingly beautiful her mother looks. 'Look how happy you are in that dress,' she says. 

'I love it, you're glowing in it and you look so happy. That's the main thing!' And after three dresses, Wendy finally wins over Jan.

'I can just see you walking down the aisle and people will gasp!' With all the feedback she needs to hear, Wendy says yes to the dress!
