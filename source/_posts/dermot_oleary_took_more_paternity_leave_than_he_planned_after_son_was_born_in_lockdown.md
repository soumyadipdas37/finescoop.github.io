Dermot O' Leary has admitted he's been able to take more paternity leave than he planned after welcoming his first child during lockdown.

The presenter, 47, admitted it was 'odd' becoming a father to his son Kasper in the midst of the crisis, but has been grateful to be given the chance to spend more time with his family.

Dermot and wife Dee Koppang announced the birth of their son in July after marrying in 2012 after first confirming they were expecting back in February.

Speaking on Thursday's Lorraine, Dermot said: 'It was a very odd time to have a kid but at the same time it gave you that enforced time to be with him.

'So I was able to take a lot more paternity than I probably would have been able to normally. 

'I don't for one minute think that's a good thing in terms of the world and the terrible situation we find ourselves in but you've got to take your blessings where you find them.'  



Dermot recently marked his eighth wedding anniversary with wife Dee, and joked they'd welcomed a low-key celebration as they both adjust to life as new parents.

He said: 'We went out for dinner which was a novelty as well. Normally going out for dinner would be a lovely thing, but something you take for granted. 

'It was so nice to be able to go out to a restaurant. We got so excited about the mundane things. 

'Someone brought us bread and butter to start and we were like, ''Thank you SO much, this is so nice of you''. We were so excited about having a little bread and butter to start.' 

Dermot was a guest on Lorraine to chat about the release of his new children's book Toto The Ninja Car and the Mystery Jewel Thief, the fourth in his series of novels.

Asked about reports surrounding The X Factor's future, Dermot said: 'No I haven't sort of thought of that too much yet until the live shows, I both miss it and realise I have weekends!'

It's been claimed that the singing series may not return to screens in 2021, after Simon Cowell previously announced it would be taking a year-long hiatus.

Dermot also updated fans on the whereabouts of his wedding ring, after it was stolen while he was exercising in the gym.

He said: 'If it annoys you Lorraine then it must be bad. It was a real shame… fingers crossed he'll get caught. 

'He broke into my locker and took my whole bag and obviously that had everything in it. I always take my wedding ring and jewellery off in case it gets snagged.'

Lorraine airs weekdays from 9am on ITV.
