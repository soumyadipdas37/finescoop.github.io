Like many women, Ireland Baldwin has had to put off getting her hair done at a salon due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

But on Thursday, the 24-year-old celebrated on social media as she finally treated herself to a trip to the hairdresser.

'Bye quarantine hair,' she wrote on an image of herself behind the wheel of her car that she posted on her Instagram Story.

Her long hair, dark at the roots and blonde at the ends, was tied up into a tight topknot.

As the Instagram Story unfolded, Ireland was seen pulling off the scrunchie and letting her locks fall loose.

'I am not this man... I am not,' she said. 'I'm a blonde.'

She then added: 'bye you ugly mop won't miss u.'

Back to blonde: The 24-year-old was later snapped outside a salon in West Hollywood with silver tinfoil strips in her hair after getting it colored

The daughter of Hollywood stars Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin was clearly committed to getting her blonde back.

She was later snapped outside a salon in West Hollywood with tinfoil strips in her hair from a coloring session as she collected a delivery of food. 

Ireland was dressed in a navy crop top and black leggings and had a brown plaid shirt knotted around her waist.

A disposable mask which she presumably had to wear inside the salon dangled from her neck as she made sure to stay socially distanced from the food delivery guy.

Ireland was raised by her famous Oscar-winning mom in Los Angeles following Basinger's divorce from actor Baldwin in 2002 and famously had a troubled relationship with her father in her youth.

Last month, she shared on Instagram that she had marked six years free from anorexia and bulimia. 

In 2018, she had spoken candidly about the struggles she faced, explaining: 'I battled with many eating disorders and body issues as a younger girl and it took me a long time to find self love and acceptance!'

She shared: 'I would eat a meal or more like a bite and have to run to the nearest bathroom or find digestive pills or run until I couldn’t feel my legs right before bed.

'I used to read people’s comments when I first started modeling and anytime anyone told me I was too tall or too fat to have done a job, I would run on a treadmill for the entire duration of at least three episodes of Friday Night Lights that I had on box set.'  

Ireland said she decided to talk publicly about her journey in the hope of encouraging others not to suffer in silence and to seek help. 

'Trust me, all of that pain and destruction I inflicted on myself wasn’t worth it. Turning down so. Many. Sides. Of. Fries. Wasn’t worth it!!' Ireland said. 

'Love yourself!! You are beautiful!! Enjoy your food. Eat ice cream with your friends! Workout and eat healthy to take care of your mind and body but find your healthy balance! Life is too short.'
