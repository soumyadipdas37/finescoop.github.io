He may be one of the biggest stars on the planet. 

But Zac Efron, 32, looked like one of the locals as he jetted into Ballina airport on a Jetstar flight with rumoured girlfriend Vanessa Valladares last Tuesday. 

The Hollywood hunk and his brunette companion cut a low-key figure in surgical face masks and casual attire as they disembarked the aircraft.

The twosome, who were returning from a ski trip in Thredbo, kept their head down as they made their way out of the airport and towards a parked car. 

Ever the gentleman, Zac was seen carrying Vanessa's carry her duffle bag as he lugged his own luggage and a khaki backpack.   

Zac covered his famously-ripped physique in a button-up blue shirt, and black jeans.

Attempting to go unnoticed by onlookers, the High School Musical star covered his head with baseball cap. 

Vanessa meanwhile wore a baggy grey T-shirt and black high-waisted trackpants. 

The brunette beauty completed her look with a small Louis Vuitton handbag and a claw-style hairclip.   

Home at last! The Hollywood hunk gladly helped the brunette carry her luggage as they disembarked the budget aircraft

The Hollywood reportedly met Vanessa in July when she was working as a waitress.

She's rumoured to have quit her job now and is said to be staying with Zac at Belongil Beach.  

Last month, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles.

'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source revealed. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.'  

Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months ago in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.

But it seems his request to have his tourist visa extended from three months to 12 months was granted, hence why he cancelled his trip home.

Daily Mail Australia understands Zac received a last-minute refund for his ticket.
