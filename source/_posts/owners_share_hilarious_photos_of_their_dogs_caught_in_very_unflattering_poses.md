Everyone who has a dog knows that they can be an endless source of joy and amusement. 

And this collection of photos of pooches in unflattering poses certainly demonstrate this fact.

The snaps were posted on Facebook by owners from around the world under the hashtag #unflatteringdogphotochallenge.

A selection of the best were then compiled by Bored Panda and, of those, FEMAIL has shared some of the funniest hounds below.
