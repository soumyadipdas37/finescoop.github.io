Eddie McGuire has certainly been making the most of his time on the Gold Coast since completing his mandatory two-week quarantine. 

The Millionaire Hot Seat host, 55, was spotted merrily chatting to partygoers as he picked up some alcohol Friday night, while his AFL team and their families remained under strict quarantine.   

Clutching a carton of guava-flavoured Vodka Cruisers and a plastic bag of limes, Eddie was seen laughing and joking with lucky fans including a festively-dressed blonde woman.

Eddie McGuire, 55, merrily chatted to Gold Coast partygoers as he headed out to buy Vodka Cruisers and limes on Friday night - one day before being busted at a nightclub with his teenage son

Eddie, who completed his isolation at the Gold Coast AFL hub on September 15, seemed thrilled to be able to mingle with the general public once again.   

Swapping his Millionaire Hot Seat suit for a more casual ensemble, Eddie wore a white button-up shirt, black polar fleece jumper and a pair of blue trousers.

He completed his low-key look with a pair of blue loafer shoes. 

Fancy seeing you here! Eddie was seen laughing and joking with lucky fans including a festively-dressed blonde woman

His outing came a day before Eddie was pictured partying at Gold Coast nightclub Pink Flamingo with his 19-year-old son Joe. 

The Collingwood president himself has been a harsh critic of the 'idiot' players who recently breached the code's strict quarantine protocols and called for anyone who broke the rules to be slapped with $100,000 fines.   

Eddie said after finishing his mandatory two weeks of quarantine, he had decided to take his son and crew from Millionaire Hot Seat out for dinner.

'The people over at the restaurant said 'come over and have a drink'': Eddie said after finishing his mandatory two weeks of quarantine, he had decided to take his son and crew from Millionaire Hot Seat out for dinner

'The people over at the restaurant said 'come over and have a drink',' McGuire said.

'My boy is 19, he hasn't been out for the best part of six months so I took him across and bought him a beer.'

Meanwhile AFL players, including from McGuire's team, and their families were holed up at the league's hotel hub under increasingly strict conditions.  

Several AFL players have been sent home from Queensland for breaching COVID-19 rules, with McGuire earlier this year calling for anyone who broke the rules to be hit with a $100,000 fine.   

Doting father: 'My boy is 19, he hasn't been out for the best part of six months so I took him across and bought him a beer,' Eddie said
