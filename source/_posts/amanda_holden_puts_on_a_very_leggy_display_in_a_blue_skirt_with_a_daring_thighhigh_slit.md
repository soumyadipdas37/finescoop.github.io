Ofcom confirmed to MailOnline that they received 277 complaints of which 235 related to Amanda's dress.   

Her gown featured a sweetheart neckline and was cinched around her svelte waist, teamed with a pair of sparkling silver barely-there heels.

However at the time, some fans claimed Amanda had suffered a nip slip in the look, and they took to Twitter to question if they'd seen more than they'd bargained for during the show.

One wrote on social media: 'Is it me or Amanda's nipples nearly hanging out of her top?', while a second asked, 'Are Amanda's nipples on show?'

Another shared on Twitter, 'Just me, or does Amanda's dress make it look like her nipples are out?', before adding: 'To be clear... I'm not offended just commented on the obvious nipple shadow.'

Clearly shocked, one viewer wrote: 'Is it me or can you see Amanda's nipples?' 

MailOnline contacted Ofcom, as well as Amanda's representatives and a Britain's Got Talent spokesperson for comment at the time.

This is not the first time Amanda's ensembles have caused a stir, as last year her raunchy ensembles sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who thought they were too revealing for a family show.

Amanda made an impression in thigh-skimming gown by Ziad Nakad, showing off a liberal amount of leg thanks to the asymmetric hemline.

While the blonde beauty had also risked a wardrobe malfunction in a cut-out number by Jennifer Clair.

The stunning jewel hued frock featured a cut-out at the bust, threatening to expose her cleavage, as well as a high-high split running up her right leg.

Scandal: Amanda's wardrobe has led to some controversial moments in the past after a daring Julien Macdonald gown she wore during the semi-final of BGT three years ago attracted a staggering 663 Ofcom complaints 

She then dared to bare in the revealing, spider web number which attracted the Ofcom complaints.

While the next night she revealed her ample cleavage in a plunging, midnight blue gown, adorned with white floral detail and sequins. 

Despite the controversy over her looks, Amanda told You magazine at the time that she was delighted her remarkable figure still attracts attention: 'I love it that people are still talking about my tired old breasts and I'm nearly 50!'

She added: 'No one talks about [BGT co-host] Alesha Dixon's – she's got great boobs by the way – and she's eight years younger than me.

'Age is totally irrelevant, thanks to people like J-Lo, who is 49 and just a sexy, hot woman who dresses for how she feels.'

Amanda's wardrobe has led to some controversial moments in the past after a daring Julien Macdonald gown she wore during the semi-final of BGT three years ago attracted a staggering 663 Ofcom complaints. 

Ofcom said that while it recognised the dress 'had potential to offend some viewers during what is a family show' - the outfit 'would not have exceeded most viewers' expectations'.

And this wasn't the first time risque outfit choices on Britain's Got Talent caused fans to lodge official complaints.

In 2016, Ofcom again decided not to investigate the ITV show after outfits worn by Holden and fellow judge Alesha Dixon sparked 90 complaints from viewers.

Meanwhile Diversity's Black Lives Matter inspired performance during the show's first semi-final attracted 24,500 complaints to OfCom, who have since announced they will not investigate any further.

ITV has 'stood with Diversity' as they featured adverts in national newspapers in support of the controversial dance. 

ITV are believed to have spent around £260,000 on the newspaper ads with full-page monochrome pieces in The Metro costing £36,461 and £27,700 in The Mirror.

On Saturday, Amanda shared a snap of her ensemble on Instagram and captioned the image: 'BGT tonight 8pm @itv! So excited for a show full of incredible acts + we get to see a theatre show (finally!) with a performance from the cast of Hairspray.' 

She wore her golden locks in bouncy glamorous curls and and opted for full coat of make-up in neutral tones. 

Amanda's pals gushed over the stunning look, as Mollie King wrote: 'Wow looking gorgeous!' and Helen Flanagan left heart emojis underneath.
