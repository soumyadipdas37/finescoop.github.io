A pensioner has been reunited with her wedding ring almost 40 years to the day she lost it while playing catch with her son in their garden.

Paula Walter couldn't have wished for a better ruby anniversary present when the 18-karat gold band was unearthed by gardeners who were laying turf at her home in Plymouth.

The 65-year-old and her entire family had searched repeatedly for the ring over four decades, but with no luck.

Desperate to find it, they hired a metal detector for two days but even that glimmer of hope was dashed.

So when gardener John discovered the gold band and returned it to Mrs Walter, she was more than shocked. 

'Not only did they do an amazing job on the garden, they're also treasure hunters,' she said.  

Mrs Walter married husband Joe at St Peter's Church in Crownhill, Plymouth on 28 August 1980. 

This 18 karat gold band flew off Mrs Walter's finger while she played catch with her son in the garden

She only wore the wedding band for a short period before it was lost.  

The pensioner vividly recalls the day she lost it while playing catch with her son in the garden.

At some point the precious band flew off her finger and onto the grass.

Unwavering faith. Mrs Walter was convinced she would one day be reunited with the ring she lost 40 years ago 

A comb of the area proved fruitless and over the years both her and her family would sporadically go in the garden to hunt for it.

The ring even became a running family joke. Anyone stepping into the garden would be reminded by Mrs Walter to be on the look-out.

It wasn't until local company Man for All Seasons was hired to clear her garden that the mystery was eventually solved.

Mrs Walter's unwavering faith led her to cheekily ask the workmen to be on the look out for her ring. 

Paula Walter said the workmen were not only gardeners but treasure hunters too after they discovered her ring

The gardeners weren't hopeful but much to their surprise the ring turned up at the exact spot it was lost all those years ago.  

Mrs Walter said: 'It really made my day, my 40 years really.'
