We don't know about you, but as the seasons change, so does our skin and hair.

The combination of different kinds of weather, different allergens, changing pollution levels and switching from air conditioning to central heating, all take their toll.

So if that sounds familiar, you may already be experiencing a few problems like dry and dull skin.

And as the climate starts to become more and more wintry, we can expect chapped lips and wind burned cheeks too.  

But all is not lost. With a few small amends to your beauty regimen you can tackle the chill and prep yourself for the months ahead. 

Here are a few tips to get you started.

1. Stay hydrated

This is a rule to live by no matter the time of year. It's just as important to stay hydrated in the autumn and winter as it is in the spring and summer. 

Dehydrated skin is often the reason for dull skin so make sure you're getting enough water throughout the day and top up at night too to quench your skin while you sleep.

Carrying a water bottle with you is the best way to keep drinking so why not treat yourself to a new one like this sweet yoga pose print style by Typhoon?

2. Look after your lips

When those icy winds are blowing and the temperature drops, we all suffer from chapped lips.

It's so annoying. After all, trying to apply lipstick when your lips are in a state is just a disaster!

So take some time to care for them and you'll have a perfect pout all winter.

Use a gentle scrub developed just for the lips to buff away any flaky skin cells. This one by Nails Inc is ideal and not only will its dual exfoliating formula work to gently lift impurities and hydrate, but it turns into a subtly tinted balm too, providing added protection from the elements. Genius!

L-R: Nails Inc Just Kinda Bliss Magic Lip Scrub to Tinted Balm (£9.99) and Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream Lip Protectant Stick (was £19.99, now £14.99) at Very

And really up the ante with the iconic Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream lip balm. As well as moisturising and softening lips, it will relieve chapping and cracking and guard against the damaging effects of UV exposure too, thanks to the built in SPF15.    

3. Exfoliate for autumn

We all know that ashy, grey tinge the skin on our legs and arms can get when it's cold outside. 

This is down to our limbs getting very limited exposure to the sun and the fact we wrap ourselves up as warm as can be from about October to March...

So a couple of times a week, treat yourself to an exfoliation session while you're in the shower or bath. It doesn't have to take long and the result will be smoother, brighter skin all year round.

Us a scrub like this one by Sanctuary Spa. Apply in upward circular motions, before rinsing off any residue and moisturising.

4. Eye up the new season 

There's something about dragging yourself out of bed when it's still dark outside that makes mornings even more painful than normal. Plus, it seems to have a major effect on our eyes, which end up looking puffy and surrounded by ageing dark circles. 

So use a product that can calm these issues, leaving you bright eyed and bushy tailed even in the depths of winter.

Elemis Pro-Collagen Eye Revive Mask (£55) at Very

The Elemis Pro-Collagen Eye Revive Mask is going on our beauty shopping list. Formulated with Flash Filler Hyaluronic Acid, Watermelon Snow Algae and antioxidant rich Bush Clover, it will deeply hydrate and help to reduce the visible signs of tension and strain around the eyes.

It's cool and refreshing and can be used overnight or as part of your morning skincare regime.

5. Switch up your formulas

If you're suffering from dry, flaky skin then help to soften and disguise it with cream formulas, rather than layering on powders which will only work to accentuate those problem areas.

So opt for hydrating cream blushes and cheek stains as well as liquid bronzers.

NIP + FAB Blush Drops Sunset Gold (£12.99) at Very

NIP + FAB's Blush Drops are the ideal way to get a rosy glow that will sink into the skin like a dream, rather than drying it out.  

6. Sleep like a princess

Getting enough sleep in general is the ultimate beauty hack, whatever your age or the time of year.

But in addition to this, do your hair a favour by sleeping on a silk pillowcase. 

It's a great way to reduce the breakage and damage that occurs to our hair as we toss and turn in the night. 

Plus, some people claim that sleeping on a silk pillowcase can help to prevent wrinkles too, so... why wouldn't you?

Hotel Collection Luxury Silk Standard Pillowcase (was £49, now £35) at Very

This version by Hotel Collection, comes in three colours (ivory, pink and platinum) and is currently reduced in price, so snap it up now before it's gone for good.

7. Oil up...

Have you noticed that as we move into the autumn and winter, our hair starts to get static, frizzier and look a bit ratty? 

If that sounds like your barnet then we recommend giving your locks some nourishment with a rich and fragrant hair oil.
