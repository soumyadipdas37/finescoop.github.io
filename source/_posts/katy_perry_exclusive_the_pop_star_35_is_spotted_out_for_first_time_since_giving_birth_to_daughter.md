Though this is Katy's first documented outing since welcoming Daisy Dove, she gave her devout Instagram following a peak at her post-baby body in a snapshot posted on August 31.

'Hair and makeup by: @exhaustion,' captioned Perry jokingly, while also tagging the makers of her harness and underwear.

Back in March, Katy revealed through the music video for her song Never Worn White that her and Orlando were expecting their first child together.

The following month, the couple announced the gender of their unborn baby as she shared a snap of the actor covered in pink cake frosting. Katy simply captioned the sweet snap: 'It's a girl!'

It is the first child for the couple, who got engaged on Valentine's Day in 2019, however Orlando already shares son Flynn, nine, with ex-wife Miranda Kerr.

Earlier this month, Katy and Orlando postponed their wedding for the second time as they wanted to focus on 'delivering a healthy child' together.
