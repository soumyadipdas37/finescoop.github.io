Olivia Wilde was recently tapped to take on the next Marvel superhero film.

But the actress/director is enjoying some downtime during her holiday weekend, as Hollywood continues to bounce back from COVID-19.

She was all smiles Monday, as she showed off her gorgeous figure in a chic one-piece swimsuit, while splashing around at the beach in Malibu, celebrating Labor Day with friends.

She told InStyle in January: ' My film Don’t Worry, Darling is a leap of faith because I’m putting myself in the film, which is madness. 

'I took so much pleasure in removing myself from the process, so now I’m very curious to see how I’ll be able to take care of everything from within.'

It's among several projects on her directorial slate, including a holiday comedy for Universal Pictures and a biopic about Olympic gymnast Kerri Strug for Searchlight Pictures.

Wilde made her feature directorial debut last year with the critically-acclaimed teen comedy Booksmart, starring Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever.
