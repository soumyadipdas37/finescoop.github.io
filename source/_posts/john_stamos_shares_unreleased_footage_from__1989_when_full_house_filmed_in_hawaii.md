John Stamos gave his followers a treat over the weekend.

To celebrate how many of his fans registered to vote, the actor shared unreleased, behind-the-scenes footage from August 1989 when the Full House cast filmed in Hawaii.

The 57-year-old star was seen hugging Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen - who are now 34-years-old - and there was a clip of Lori Loughlin as well.

Stamos, who played Uncle Jesse Katsopolis on the original program and its sequel series Fuller House, posted the video to Instagram on Saturday. 

'Full House Hawaii ‘89,' Stamos wrote in the caption dating the video. 'Thank you guys for showing up to vote through #goodtovote!' 

He added: 'We more than doubled our voter mark! So as promised, here is some unreleased OG footage from Full House when we shot the Hawaii episode.' 

Gushing over the bond his co-stars created, he wrote: 'You can see how much we loved each other off camera - that still exists today. It's not too late to register.'  

The video captures sweet moments between the cast, including Stamos cuddling up to his on-screen nieces played by Mary-Kate and Ashley.

The post came nearly two weeks after Stamos and his two-year-old son Billy recorded a video promising the behind the scenes video if at least 100 fans registered to vote.

'I don't normally pimp my kid out for anything,' he joked. 'Everybody's gotta register to vote.'

Loughlin, who was seen in short bits of the video, was written out of the final season of Fuller House due to her involvement in the college admissions scandal. 

She was also missing from a Zoom reunion of the cast earlier this month, as she prepares to serve a two-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to paying $500,000 to get her daughters into USC as rowing recruits.
