A victim of a Tinder creep who trolled eight women after they rejected his sexual advances is now being subjected to horrific abuse from a fake account. 

Thomas McGuirk, 28, from Bondi, was sacked from his IT job last week after Ebonie Sanderson, 26, posted images of vile abusive messages he sent her on Instagram. 

Since she came forward, another eight woman from multiple cities have shared their eerily similar experiences of being bombarded with horrific insults after turning the Tech worker down.  

Despite the public furore, with thousands rallying online to denounce his actions, Sydney brewery manager Erin Hinds, 26, has copped fresh abuse from a fake Instagram account using the same repertoire of derogatory phrases as Tom.

The account @suetrumpbbg on Tuesday called Ms Hinds an 'attention seeker' and claimed her account was all 'lies'. 

'Loved how easy you were,' @suetrumpbbg wrote.   

'There is nothing wrong with me, I am not the evil attention seeker here and [sic] opens her legs up to get fame.' 

The user claimed to have evidence of McGuirk and Ms Hinds messages that would validate that there was 'another side to the story', but never produced the 'evidence' despite Ms Hinds and other commenters requests.

Early ramblings referred to McGuirk in third person, before the user, who has no posts or followers, insinuated he had met Ms Hinds. 

When Ms Hinds' followers confronted the user, speculating it was McGuirk, they became targets in the bizarre tirade.

The user launched a fresh tirade against Ms Hinds calling her an 'attention seeker' for speaking out about her treatment

'I'm better looking than any guy you could get,' @suetrump replied to one commenter. 

To another they wrote: 'You are a little girl! Go back to your room little one! Stop trying to act tough! I don't hit women lucky for you! Keep spreading your legs for $8 a month.'  

 The user returned again to troll her on Wednesday morning on another post, writing: 'Can't believe how much you are milking this!!! all for opening your legs lol.' 

Ms Hinds blocked the account and is going to the police to apply for a restraining order. 

Ms Hinds was not the user's only fixation- with McGuirk's first known victim, Ms  Sanderson, also collecting disparaging remarks from @suetrumpbbg on one of her posts.

Last week, Ms Sanderson shared voice messages McGuirk had sent her calling her a 'disgusting fat pig' after she declined an offer to go to his house. 

Her post was shared by feminist icon Clementine Ford and her army of followers who flagged the disgraceful behaviour to his boss at Invenco. 

CEO Dave Scott fired him immediately upon listening to the tapes and McQuirk promptly shutdown his social media accounts, which have not been active since.  

On Tuesday night, the Instagram user flocked to Ms Sanderson's page to regurgitate McGuirk's previous insults. 

'You shouldn't be calling other people pig, when that's you in the photo,' @suetrump wrote. 

'1000000 she calling people when she is the real pig [sic].'    

'Attention seeker! Trying to get money from making a situation much bigger!' 

Ms Hinds saga began when she met McGuirk on Tinder last month before the pair spent the night together at his Bondi home. 

But two days later when she told him she was not interested in taking things further, he bombarded her with horrific derogatory messages. 

'I said sorry, I have changed my mind. It was fun but we really don't have chemistry. That is when he flipped the switch,' Ms Hinds previously told Daily Mail Australia. 

'He went crazy.'

The account also took to Ms Sanderson's page to level abuse (pictured) on Tuesday night

'He started calling me a w***e and a s**t then taking pictures of my friends from social media and sending them to me saying that we are all retards, disgusting w****s with bad dental hygiene, and s***ts only worth one f**k each.' 

Ms Hinds blocked him, but the abuse kicked off again the next day when she matched with a man called 'Ryan' on Tinder who claimed to be Tom's friend. 

Ryan called her a s**t and said that he and Tom planned to go to her work, with Ms Hinds warning she would call the police if they did. 

Ms Hinds said the hate campaign was 'terrifying'.

'It's so overwhelming. It's hard to fathom that this is happening,' she told  Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday. 

'It is getting so out of hand.' 

Ms Hinds said it is difficult to comprehend the experiences someone may have had which could lead to such behaviour.

 Despite her harrowing ordeal, Ms Hinds said she has been comforted by the overwhelming support of friends and strangers. 

'It's really surreal. I didn't expect there to be so many other women. I've had so many women and men message me to say thank you for speaking up, we are behind you. 

'To have all of that support has been really amazing.' 

On Tuesday, six more women came forward to Daily Mail Australia to share their horror stories with the 28-year-old Bondi 'playboy'.

There interactions with McGuirk all took place within the past 18 months in Newcastle to Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sydney. 

Gold Coast victims include beauty vlogger Jess Turunen, Woolworths manager Chantelle Robinson, 26, and Melbourne makeup artist Hem Mason, 29, who matched with while based in the Queensland city.

There stories all start out the same, with cheesy-pickup lines rapidly escalating into sexual advances before McGuirk badgers them to meet up. 

But when his proposal is knocked back, he suddenly snaps.    

He launches into a sickening attack inundating their inbox with belittling names until they are forced to block him. 

If they are lucky it ends there. Others are tracked down onto other platforms where the abuse continues.  

Now, Ms Hinds wonders if it will ever stop.
