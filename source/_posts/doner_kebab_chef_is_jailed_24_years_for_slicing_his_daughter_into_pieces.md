A Turkish kebab shop worker who killed his daughter and used a doner meat knife to dismember her body has been sentenced to 24 years in prison.

Hasan Uslu strangled 32-year-old belly dancer Didem Uslu to death and stashed her chopped-up body parts in a freezer because 'she came home drunk.'

The killing took place in the district of Kesan in the north-western Turkish province of Edirne.

Didem Uslu, 32, a belly-dancer, was found expertly carved up by police officers in woodland and her kebab-chef father, Hasan, was detained on suspicion of her killing. He has now been sentenced to 24 years in prison

Uslu told the court that it was his daughter's fault, saying she insulted her mother when she arrived home and then argued with him when he ordered her to be respectful.

When she argued back, he said he lost his temper, and then strangled her to death. 

The kebab cook was arrested after the dancer's arm was found wrapped in newspaper in local woodland by a man collecting pine cones near a local mosque on January 9. 

Police tested the arm's fingerprints and found that it belonged to Didem Uslu.

An investigation found that her father had been trying to dispose of her body in a nearby forest piece by piece. 

Uslu attended court via a video call while his wife - accused of failing to report the crime to the police - did not attend the hearing.

The father asked the court to be released, saying he is danger of contracting Covid-19 in prison, arguing that his age and underlying health conditions put him at risk.

However, the court found Uslu guilty of 'deliberately killing' his daughter, and sentenced him to 24 years in prison.

Sati Uslu, his wife, was reportedly acquitted of the charge of failing to report the crime. She said she felt unwell after the killing and had gone to her bedroom where she fainted. 

In his confession to the police last year, Uslu stated his daughter had psychological problems, Hurriyet reported.

Uslu claims Didem insulted him and insulted his wife and then he strangled her on December 14, 2018, the Turkish daily reported.

Didem's mother Sati Uslu and younger sister Ozlem were also detained by police investigating the gruesome crime in the Kesan district of Edirne Province, although Ozlem has since been released.

After the dancer's dismembered arm - hacked off at the shoulder - was found wrapped in a newspaper in woodland, police were alerted.

They then used sniffer dogs to trace other parts of the body, all cut with very precise and straight incisions.
