Vanessa Hudgens flawlessly channeled the film Moulin Rouge in a figure-hugging red satin gown, which showcased her incredible curves.  

While putting on a busty display in a stunning floor-length frock, the 31-year-old actress held onto a wine glass and donned a pair of long black gloves. 

She styled her dark tresses in a sleek updo, while allowing her bangs to cascade down the left half of her face.

In addition to the seductive evening gown's plunging neckline, a flirty high-cut slit hovered above her upper thigh, giving a glimpse of the star's sensational legs.   

'One day I’ll fly away.... (name that movie),' the High School Musical alum captioned two sultry images of herself for her 38.8 million Instagram followers. 

Her comment section was flooded by fans referring to her by the name of the 2001 musical's star, Satine, which was famously portrayed by Nicole Kidman.

'I’ll name that movie, but first can u let me pick my jaw up off the floor, SATINE!' one of her followers gushed, to which she replied, 'lloool love yoooou.' 

Hudgens made sure to sport the character's signature red pout and black heels, while adding a more modern winged liner to the look. 

On her Instagram Story, she posted another shot of herself in the gown with a beaming grin and standing on one leg.

Then, she shared a brief video of herself mouthing the lyrics to one of the movie's tracks' Your Song, sung by Ewan McGregor and Alessandro Safina.

In the footage, she can be seen in the car with the song blasting. 

Hudgens' affinity for Baz Luhrmann's film dates as far back as 2011, when she said she 'fell in love' with Moulin Rouge on her first viewing to MTV News. 

'I have not stopped watching it since,' she gushed nearly a decade ago.  

In 2016, she also channeled Satine in a custom photo booth at Cinespia’s Valentine’s Day celebration of Moulin Rogue. 

Last July, she even posted a snap from the audience after attending a performance of Moulin Rouge The Musical on Instagram. 

'Well that was a blast,' she captioned a shot of the stage.
