She's expecting her third child with husband John Legend.

And on Monday, Chrissy Teigen shared a sweet video to Instagram showing her firstborn Luna helping out with a sonogram.

The four-year-old helped guide the doctor's hand over her mommy's tummy and called out excitedly when the fetus came into view on the monitor.

Cute: She's expecting her third child with John Legend. And on Monday, Chrissy Teigen shared a sweet video to Instagram showing her firstborn Luna helping out with a sonogram

Chrissy, 34, smiled happily as she switched her gaze between the monitor and her daughter.

In the caption alongside the clip, the Cravings cookbook author admitted to feeling nervous in these relatively early days of her pregnancy.

The couple only confirmed they were expecting again three weeks ago. 

'Before I’m able to start feeling the kicks, the anxiety gets the best of me and any little bits of spotting or pain freak me ouuuuuut,' she wrote.

'one day I swear I’ll buy one of these machines but by then I’ll be all done with having monsters!' she said, before adding 'all is well' and tagging her two doctors. 

Hands on: The four-year-old helped guide the doctor's hand over her mommy's tummy and called out excitedly when the fetus came into view on the monitor

Siblings: Both Luna and her brother Miles, two, were conceived thanks to IVF after Chrissy and John had embryos frozen due to a long struggle with infertility. Baby number three, though, was a surprise and was conceived naturally

Both Luna and her brother Miles, two, were conceived thanks to IVF after Chrissy and John had embryos frozen due to a long struggle with infertility.

However, in a surprise, they found out earlier this year that Chrissy had conceived naturally and the announced their happy news in the music video to John's latest single Wild, which premiered on August 13. 

'It was a surprise. A little quarantine surprise, I guess you could say,' John shared with Craig Melvin while on the Today Show recently. 'But we're very excited, and we're grateful for all the well-wishes we've gotten from people all around the world.' 

Meanwhile, on Sunday, the couple and their two kids were seen visiting Chrissy's new Cravings HQ in LA.

She posted some snaps from the occasion and shared: 'I cannot explain what this photo means to me. So many dreams come together. Every random idea, every silly night text to the team, the little blog from 14 years ago, all manifested there to feed you is fulfilled. Cravings HQ is *nearly* done!!!'

Dream come true: On Sunday, the model and cookbook author visited her new Cravings HQ in LA and showed off the workspace in a series of photos on her Instagram 

Family: Chrissy was joined by hubby John and their kids as they toured to lavishly appointed set up
