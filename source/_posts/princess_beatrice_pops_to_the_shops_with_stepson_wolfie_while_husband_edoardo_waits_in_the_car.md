Princess Beatrice was on stepmum duties as she popped to the shops with husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and his four-year-old son, Wolfie. 

Beatrice, 32, and Wolfie went into a London branch of Waitrose to pick up some groceries while property developer Edoardo, 37, waited in their Range Rover outside. 

The princess, the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, made sure Wolfie was safely in the back seat before climbing in the passenger seat next to her husband. 

It is the first time they have been seen out together since Beatrice and Edoardo secretly tied the knot on July 17 in Windsor, with Wolfie acting as best man.

It is the third time Beatrice has been seen running errands in London in recent days. 

Last week she was seen picking up a bag of organic groceries and stopping off at baby shop The Little White Company to pick up a gift.

The outings suggest she and Edo are settling into married life in London. Wolfie also plays an important part in their lives together in the city, with friends previously speaking of the good relationship Beatrice has with her new stepson. 

Beatrice and Edoardo headed off to France for a low-key honeymoon shortly after their private wedding on July 17.  The couple exchanged vows in front of immediate family, including the Queen and Prince Philip, at All Saints Church, Windsor.

A source told the Mail on Sunday that Beatrice and Edo had planned to skip a traditional honeymoon, but decided at the last minute to take a trip across the Channel.

‘The wedding was arranged in a couple of weeks, and with lockdown their choice of honeymoon destinations was severely curtailed.

‘They weren’t going to bother but at the last minute they decided to pack up the car and head out. They’re a very down-to-earth couple.’ 

It is understood that they are planning a trip to Lamu Island, off Kenya, where Edo’s family own a home and where he took Beatrice in the early days of their romance.
