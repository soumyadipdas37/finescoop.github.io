An affordable cider from Aldi Australia has been named one of the 'best in the world' by a panel of experts.

Judges awarded Storm Brewing Apple Cider a trophy at the tenth annual International Cider Challenge in Sussex, southeast England, on August 12.

The cider - which is sold exclusively in Aldi stores across Australia - is described as 'refreshing and delicious', with a sweet taste that's perfect for the warm summer days ahead.

And at just $16.99 for a 10 pack of 375ml cans, which works out to be $1.69 per can, it's excellent value - considerably cheaper than other leading labels.

At just $16.99 for a 10 pack of 375ml cans, it's excellent value - considerably cheaper than other leading labels

Ten packs of Somersby cider cost $22 while James Squire‘Orchard Crush’ is even steeper at $31.49.

Now in its tenth year, the International Cider Challenge is regarded as one of the most respected and influential cider competitions in the world.

Winners are chosen by independent judges through blind taste tests according to taste, appearance and aroma.

The nod comes weeks after Aldi launched an affordable range of naturally-made wines for Australian customers, with vegan-friendly vintages for $6.99 and organic reds for $9.99.

Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz bottled at vineyards in Gulgong, in the central west region of New South Wales, went on sale on August 5 as part of the German-owned supermarket's bi-weekly 'Special Buys' offer.

Aldi in August launched bottles of organic Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon (centre-right and right) for $9.99 and vegan-friendly Pinot Grigio and Sangiovese (left and centre-left) for $6.99

A product description on Aldi's website claims the 'Gangsta Garden' reds are 'intense, rich wines exhibiting the vibrancy and the power of Mother Nature'.

Bottles of vegan-friendly 2019 Pinot Grigio and Sangiovese from Italy are only $6.99 while six-packs of Mountain Goat Steam Ale - one of Australia's first organic-certified beers - are just $14.99 with cases of 24 for $59.95.

Described as 'crisp, refreshing and full of character', the ale is touted as a 'great introduction' for first-time craft beer drinkers. 

The drinks are available in selected stores in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and the ACT along with a wider collection of affordable alcohol.
