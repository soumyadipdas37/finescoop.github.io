She was sent home by Locky Gilbert during Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor, but Izzy Sharman-Firth has revealed she'd already moved on.

The 29-year-old former Bachelor hopeful was asked about her relationship status during an interview on Thursday's episode of The Project.

And a 'smitten' Izzy confessed she's happily in love with a new man after getting dumped by the Survivor star.  

New love: She was sent home during Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor, but on Thursday, Izzy Sharman-Firth revealed she'd already moved on

'I'm extremely smitten. I'm very much in love!' she giddily told the show's panelists.

Izzy also made her new relationship 'Instagram official', sharing a series of photos with her new beau on the social media app on Thursday.

'And outside the mansion,' she captioned them, including a photo of herself and her new boyfriend gazing at each other adoringly.

While she didn't reveal her beau's name or give details about their relationship, Izzy also shared a video of herself giving him a quick kiss on Instagram Stories.

During her appearance on The Project, Izzy was also asked about her mum, Christina, who shocked viewers when she asked Locky, 31, for his sperm during Wednesday's home visit.

'We just wondered... This is probably a little, tiny bit out there, but, you know, I've always said to Isabella, if she doesn't really find a man and she feels like a baby, is there any chance, as a consolation prize, just a little bit of sperm...' she asked.

While Izzy wasn't in the room during the awkward moment, she said she doubted that her mother was being serious. 

'I wasn't there in the moment so I heard about it when we were having dinner after that and I thought mum was joking to start with - she was joking, just to clarify!' she laughed. 

She added: 'She was joking, she has a funny sense of humour. I don't think she meant it.'
