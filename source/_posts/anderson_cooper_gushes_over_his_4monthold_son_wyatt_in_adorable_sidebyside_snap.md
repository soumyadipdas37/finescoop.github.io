Anderson Cooper welcomed his first child, Wyatt, via surrogate in April and is every inch a doting dad. 

The 53-year-old CNN anchor gave an update on his son who will turn five-months-old in just two weeks, calling him 'such a happy baby.'

Cooper shared an adorable snap, with his 2.5m Instagram followers on Friday, in which he laid side-by-side with his son in bed.

The son of Gloria Vanderbilt wore black frame glasses and a soft maroon T-shirt as he flashed a bright smile to the camera. 

Meanwhile, Wyatt seemed to only be in a diaper and a white long-sleeve shirt that was pulled behind revealing his round baby belly. 

'My son will be five months old in less than two weeks,' Cooper captioned the selfie. 'He is such a happy baby even though he has started teething.' 

He went on to describe his son's growing love of being read to with a classic children's book.

Co-parents: Cooper talked about why he brought in his ex-boyfriend Benjamin Maisani to co-parent his son, so Wyatt would be 'surrounded by love' (Cooper and Maisani in 2015)

'He loves being read to and so far Dr. Seuss is his favorite,' he added. 'Particularly, One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.' 

Though he joked 'Ok, that's my favorite, but he does seem to like it a lot.' 

The journalist has previously opened up about his choice to co-parent Wyatt with his ex-boyfriend Benjamin Maisani, who he split from in 2018 after ten years together.  

Speaking in the June Pride issue of People, he said 'I knew what it was like growing up without a dad,' adding, 'If there was ever something that happened to me, I would want Wyatt to be surrounded by love,' in regards to his father Wyatt Cooper passing away during surgery when he was just 10. 

Siblings? In the same issue of the magazine, the new dad said he hasn't ruled out welcoming more children in the future 

Change: Despite adjusting to his new schedule, which includes waking up around 7 a.m., after anchoring his CNN show every weekday night, his son has 'changed everything,' while speaking to WSJ. Magazine in August 

In the same issue of the magazine, the new dad said he hasn't ruled out welcoming more children in the future. 

'I need to probably sleep a little bit more and clear my head, but I think it would be great, one day, to have a brother or sister for Wyatt,' he said.  'I haven't ruled anything out down the road.' 

Despite adjusting to his new schedule, which includes waking up around 7 a.m., after anchoring his CNN show every weekday night, his son has 'changed everything,' while speaking to WSJ. Magazine in August.

'It's changed everything,' he admitted. 'I've often in my life felt like I was waiting for my actual life to begin - it's obviously ridiculous because I'm 53 years old - but… I've been very focused on getting to some place, getting a story. Because I’m focused on him, it gives an order to everything.'
