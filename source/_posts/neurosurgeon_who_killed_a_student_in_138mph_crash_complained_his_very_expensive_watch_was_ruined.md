A drunk neurosurgeon who killed a medical student in a crash complained that his very expensive watch and car had been ruined in the collision. 

Neurosurgeon Dr Jonathan Nakhla, 36,  is said to have been drunk behind the wheel going 138mph when he flipped his Audi R8 Spyder in Mobile, Alabama. Samantha Thomas, 24, who was sitting in the passenger seat, died from the force of the collision. 

Nakhla was in court this week for a preliminary hearing relating to a manslaughter charge for the young woman's death.  

Investigators at court Wednesday said first responders recalled Nakhla being more worried about his 'very expensive' timepiece than Thomas's condition. 

Dr Jonathan Nakhla, 36 (left), from Mobile, Alabama, has been charged with manslaughter in a crash that killed Samantha Thomas, 24 (right)

Nakhla was allegedly driving at speeds topping 130mph on the morning of August 1 when he swerved to avoid hitting another vehicle. (Pictured: An ambulance at the crash scene)

He is also said to have told someone on the phone 'I know baby, you loved that car', while being treated in the back of the ambulance, WKRG reports.   

The court also heard the pair, who were neighbors, were caught on CCTV drinking next to the pool during the day. 

At around midnight, Nakhla drove Thomas in the car to get ice cream, he is said to have told police. 

The deadly crash happened within five minutes of the pair leaving the apartment building. 

Nakhla did try to unbuckle Thomas's seatbelt to treat her, the court heard, before realising that she was already dead. 

Nakhla's lawyer said he was driving an Audio R8 Spyder (similar to one pictured), which can go from 0 to 60mph in under 4 seconds 

Prosecutors have alleged that Nakhla was over the legal alcohol limit but toxicology results are still pending. Nakhla's legal team deny the allegations, suggesting the results from the breathalyzer are inaccurate.   

Nakhla was sacked from his role at Mobile Infirmary after being charged with manslaughter last month.  

In addition to the manslaughter charge, Thomas's father has filed a lawsuit against Nakhla, accusing him of causing the death of his daughter.   

At the end of August, Harold Thomas, brought a civil lawsuit against Nakhla, claiming that his 'reckless driving' while 'under the influence of alcohol' resulted in Thomas' death.
