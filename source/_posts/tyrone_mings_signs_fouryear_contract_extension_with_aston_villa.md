Tyrone Mings has signed a contract extension with Aston Villa which will keep him at the club until 2024.

The defender, who initially joined on loan from Bournemouth in January 2019, helped play a key part in the club's promotion to the Premier League and subsequent survival last season.

The centre back's performances earned him an England call-up in October 2019 and he was part of the most recent Three Lions' squad for the UEFA Nations League fixtures earlier this month. 

Aston Villa have confirmed that Tyrone Mings has signed a contract extension until 2024
