They kept fans entertained over the summer, when they shared snaps of videos of their fun-filled times at home together during the COVID-19 lockdown.

'But more importantly a wonderfully hilarious time. Bring it on!'

'I cannot wait to get stuck in and lead my team to victory each week… I love you Emily, but watch out! I'm so excited to start!

'I've been the biggest fan for years, I used to go and sit in the audience when I first moved to London and can't believe I'm a team captain now!'

Insiders previously claimed the decision came as a blow to programming chiefs, who have long relied on her star quality to attract viewers. 

Although Holly had worked in television for several years before Celebrity Juice, landing the role on the show in 2008 helped make her TV hot property.

She joined This Morning a year later and still hosts the show with Phillip Schofield. Celebrity Juice is also where the term 'Holly Willoughbooby' was coined to described her curvaceous figure.

Her resignation came shortly after her husband Dan Baldwin – one of Celebrity Juice's creators – stopped producing the show.
