Model Rachael Finch just celebrated her daughter Violet's seventh birthday.

And the 32-year-old wellness guru decided to treat the youngster to a bit of time away in the wild on Wednesday.  

Rachael and Violet enjoyed the benefits of a secluded tiny house in the coastal town of Kiama, just two hours away from Sydney. 

Into the wild! On Tuesday, model Rachael Finch headed off the grid to spend quality time with her daughter Violet, seven, in a tiny holiday house. Both pictured

The home offers sweeping views of the countryside, with it perched in lush greenery. 

The cladded cottage also features over-sized windows, along with a large fold out bed, and has a number of household amenities. 

Rachael was clearly impressed with her find. 'Checked-in! Our home for the next few days,' she wrote alongside the image on Instagram. 'My kind of getaway!

Over on her stories, Rachael showed herself and Violet entering the house, which features a small galley style kitchen and small bathroom.

It comes after Rachael celebrated the youngster's birthday, with her getting a ladybird birthday cake, based off the children's cartoon Miraculous Ladybug. 

She posted a family photo of herself with her husband Michael, their three-year-old son Dominic, and the birthday girl.

Violet's celebration also included a children's entertainer dressed as the character Ladybug, from the children's series, in a red and black polka dot outfit and a blue wig. 

Her special day also included a ladybird birthday cake that appeared to have black and red marzipan icing. It was decorated with a ribbon and topped with a mask. 

Rachael wrote in the caption: 'A birth-day always turns into a birth-week.'
