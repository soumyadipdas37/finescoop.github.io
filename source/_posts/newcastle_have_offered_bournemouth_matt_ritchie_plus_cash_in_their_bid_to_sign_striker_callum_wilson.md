Newcastle have tempted Bournemouth into selling striker Callum Wilson by offering their former midfielder Matt Ritchie in a player plus cash deal. 

Sportsmail understands Aston Villa will rival the Magpies in their bid to sign the 28-year-old England international, who was unable to prevent the Cherries from being relegated last season.

Wilson, who scored seven Premier League goals in 2019-20, is high on Steve Bruce's wish list after watching his side struggle to hit the back of the net in the last campaign. Joelinton joined for a club-record £40million but scored just two of the team's 38 goal tally.

Meanwhile, Dwight Gayle suffered a knee injury during pre-season with Andy Carroll struggling to reach full fitness after returning to training.  

Ritchie's possible departure may leave Newcastle fans disappointed, with the 30-year-old becoming a fan favourite during his time at St James' Park. 

He joined the club for £12million from the Cherries in 2016 and has gone on to make 148 appearances, scoring 24 goals, but Newcastle are lacking funds this summer, with Bruce only being given a budget of around £30m after a Saudi-backed takeover bid collapsed.

The club will therefore have to generate funds from player sales to provide new recruits for Bruce. He has already snapped up Jeff Hendrick on a free transfer and received a boost after Matty Longstaff signed a new deal. 

Wilson joined the Cherries from home-town club Coventry during the summer of 2014 and scored 20 times in 45 league games to help them win promotion to the Premier League in his first season.

He announced himself on the big stage with five goals in his first six games and, after overcoming two serious knee injuries, scored on his full England debut in a 3-0 friendly victory over the United States in November 2018.
