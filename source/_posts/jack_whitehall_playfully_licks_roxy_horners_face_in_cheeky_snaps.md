They recently sparked engagement rumours when she was seen wearing a gold band on her wedding finger.

But Jack Whitehall and his girlfriend Roxy Horner brushed aside the speculation as the model uploaded images from his London restaurant residency from over the weekend on Instagram on Monday.

The comedian, 32, looked completely smitten with the blonde beauty, 29, as he playfully licked her face for a cheeky snap.

The couple proved inseparable as they cosied up to each other at the industry event, where they were Kate Moss' younger sister Lottie and Jack's former A League of Their Own co-stars.

Online sensation Roxy caught the eye in a nude off-shoulder mini-dress, complete with ruffled sleeves.

Her funnyman beau, meanwhile, cut a typically casual figure by sporting a grey sweatshirt and black jeans.

When contacted by MailOnline, a representative for Jack said the couple are not engaged. 

They were said to have made their romance exclusive just before the UK went into lockdown in March.

A source told The Sun at the time: 'Jack and Roxy are enjoying being in isolation together. It's all very new but they're in their own little bubble and things are perfect at the moment.

All in the details: Star-drop earrings, wavy tresses and a neutral-toned make-up look rounded off her appearance 

'Being on lockdown in a honeymoon period is certainly one way to get to know each other quickly. But the more time they spend together the happier they seem.

'Both have had their share of heartbreak and struggled a bit to find love. It's time they had some luck.'

Roxy has a string of famous exes, having previously been linked to A-list actor Leonardo DiCaprio and singer Jake Bugg who she split from in December.

Jack has been linked to various women since calling it quits with actress Gemma Chan, 37, in December 2017 after six years together. She is now in a relationship with screen star Dominic Cooper.
