A horticulturalist has quit his job after selling a multi million-dollar apartment complex that he won in a fundraiser.

Nick Matthews scored the Gold Coast beach-side complex in May after purchasing a $5 ticket for the RSL Art Union - a group that supports military veterans - on a whim. 

On Friday, the 30-year-old sold the stack of five fully furnished luxury apartments to a single buyer.

While the buyer's identity and final sale price remain confidential, selling agent Travis Miller confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the property was valued at $6million earlier this year.

Mr Matthews described the sales process as 'long and emotional' and revealed he had to leave his job to keep up with the demands.

'There were lots of meetings to be at and big decisions to make, it just got too hard to juggle a job on top,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

'I felt like I was letting work down and had to put my personal life first.' 

All apartments feature ocean views, swimming pool and garage parking, and are located within minutes from the Palm Beach precinct.

The penthouse - which was temporarily occupied by Mr Matthews and his girlfriend Tamesha - boasts three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a spacious living area, double garage and an outdoor entertainment area overlooking the water. 

The couple have already splashed out on a four-bedroom home in Upper Coomera, north of Palm Beach, to live closer to family and friends.

Upon learning he'd won the complex, Mr Matthews booked an appointment with a financial planner to ensure he did not squander his prize.

He told the publication that he is looking forward to possibly starting his own business.

'Not too many people are in a position to pack up their desk and walk out, I do feel very privileged.'
