Summer complemented her holiday look with a pink rara miniskirt which highlighted her leggy frame. 

She added a boost to her height with floral heels and donned a pair of chunky earrings. 

In keeping with her fiesty nature, the red-headed beauty captioned the snap: 'My attitude is based on how you treat me'.

The snap comes after Summer denied that she is dating Hollyoaks actor Fabrizio Santino, 37, after they were pictured looking cosy with one another.  

Summer told MailOnline: 'We are JUST friends!'

Fabrizio played Ziggy Roscoe in Channel 4's Hollyoaks between 2013 and 2015, and was previously linked to Danniella Westbrook.

Summer has been living with her mother Sabina and the family at their rural home ever since moving back in following her break-up with Bake Off judge Paul last year.

Her sole focus has been on her seven horses and two foals - Rainbow and Storm. 

She previously admitted how she was 'besotted' with Paul when their romance first began but was warned by her mother that relationship could 'explode'.

Summer dated the TV star for two years before the relationship imploded in arguments and legal battles.
