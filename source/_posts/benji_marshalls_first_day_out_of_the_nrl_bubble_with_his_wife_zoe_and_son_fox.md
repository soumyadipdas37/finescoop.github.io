Benji Marshall played his final game for the Wests Tigers on Saturday after learning through the media he would not be re-signed for 2021. 

However, the 35-year-old was all smiles as he spent his first day out of the NRL's biosecurity bubble on Monday at the launch of Pixar Putt with his wife, Zoe, and their two-year-old son, Fox.

The family were in good spirits as they tested out the Pixar-themed mini-golf course at Bankwest Stadium, in western Sydney.

The rugby league player looked stylish in an all-white ensemble featuring shorts, sneakers and a hoodie.

Benji was also sporting a large leg brace following his injury during Saturday's game.

Zoe, 36, cut an effortlessly chic figure in a pair of denim jeans and a white T-shirt, which she paired with white sneakers and a brown coat.

The mother of one wore her cropped black hair in a half-updo and concealed her gaze behind trendy sunglasses. 

Their son, Fox, looked adorable in a pair of chinos and a grey jumper as he enjoyed trying out all the obstacles. 

The outing comes after Benji turned down an offer to bring his family on the field for his final game in a swipe to the Wests Tigers after learning through the media he would not be re-signed to the club.

He chose to walk his honorary lap alone to mark his send-off at Bankwest Stadium, on Saturday night.

His wife and son were nowhere to be seen while outgoing teammate Chris Lawrence accompanied Marshall with his wife, Kathrynn, and their daughter, Emme.

The NRL had successfully applied for an exemption for the two players to have their families on the field following the Wests Tigers v Eels showdown.

But the sportsman refused the invitation following the team's decision to let him go, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

Benji had been hoping to play for another year with the Tigers, and only found out he would not be re-signed for 2021 after reading about it in the news.

None of the players has been picked up by other clubs so far, including Benji.
