She is an actress and director.

But Katie Holmes put her inner fashionista on full display while out in New York City on Thursday.

Clad in a sophisticated, sleeveless white top, the actress, 41, looked super stylish while making her way through the bustling Big Apple.

Covering up her face with a black face mask as a precautionary measure against COVID-19, Katie seemed deep in thought as she crossed the street in her pristine white sneakers.

The Dawson's Creek star propped on a pair of sunglasses whilst covering up her figure with blue jeans.

She slung a woven white bag over her arm, where she placed her essentials items.

Katie gave the summery look a hint of pizzazz with layers of gold necklaces and a bold red manicure.

Katie has been spotted out in the Big Apple during the pandemic, at times accompanied by her 14-year-old daughter Suri, whom she shares with her ex-husband Tom Cruise.

The star is notoriously private when it comes to discussing her teenage girl, but last month she gave rare insight into their lives together during an interview with the Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph.

The actress revealed how quarantining with Suri in New York has made her 'look at everything' she has, and celebrate simple tasks such as making dinner.

'I like to keep her out of my interviews, but I will say that this time of quarantine has been such a lesson,' Katie told the publication via a video conference app.

'Just really looking at everything you have and celebrating the simplicity of making dinner and [spending] that time together.'

Katie, who got her big break starring in the hit series Dawson's Creek, added she feels 'very blessed' with her life.

'When I think about my life, I feel very blessed. I have felt very lucky and I rely on my instincts a lot but I also forgive myself for mistakes,' she said.
