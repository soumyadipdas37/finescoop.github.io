Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt got together online for their table read of Fast Times At Ridgemont High and the images were shared for the first time on Monday.

This is the first time the ex spouses have been seen together since they said hello to each other backstage at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in January - he won for Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and she got an away for The Morning Show.

The 50-year-old blonde beauty and the 56-year-old veteran movie star - who were married from 2000 until 2005 - both beamed during the charity event which will air on September 17.

Jennifer looked far younger than her years with her blonde hair worn down as she sported a fresh tan wit a dark top.

Brad had longer than usual blonde hair with a green top as he resembled his scruffy image from his hit film Legends Of The Fall from 1995.

The former power couple famously worked together on an episode of her hit TV series Friends. 

Aniston and Pitt seem to have become friends again since he split from Angelina Jolie in 2016.

Rare: Brad famously made a guest appearance on Friends in 2001, but the couple have rarely worked together despite maintaining a friendship even after their divorce; shown in 2001

Last year, Pitt made an unexpected appearance at Aniston's 50th birthday celebration, where the two had a genial chat. Aniston had invited him, and the two reportedly had a significant chat, though she cut it short to allow other guests to spend time with her.  

He is currently reportedly romancing model Nicole Poturalski with whom he has been spending time in France and Berlin.

Also on the Fast Times live read was Dane Cook, Morgan Freeman, Henry Golding, Shia LaBeouf, Matthew McConaughey, Jimmy Kimmel, Julia Roberts, John Legend and Ray Liotta. Pitt's friend Sean Penn, who was the star of FTARH, was also on the screen. The film came out in 1982 and was an instant cult classic.

 In August Cook said it was Aniston who made the live read star studded.

 He told Extra the Friends veteran was the first star to sign on for the live table.

'I think Jennifer Aniston was lovely and the first person to say, "I’m in," and then it just started to rocket after that,' said the 48-year-old Employee Of The Month star.

Pitt as well as Julia Roberts, Sean Penn, Morgan Freeman, Shia LaBeouf, Matthew McConaughey, Jimmy Kimmel and Henry Golding then joined in.

Cook told Extra's Billy Bush: 'I wanted to do something that lightens the mood, can help people, and at the same time, I wanted to do something that felt celebratory, because we don’t have movies.'

The stand-up comedian then added: 'We started making phone calls. I think Jennifer Aniston was lovely and the first person to say, "I’m in," and then it just started to rocket after that.'

Dane said a lot more big named were coming forward.

'You haven’t even heard all the names. In the next 24 hours, your mind is going to be blown!' On Friday more stars will be announced.
