She shares son Mack, two, and baby daughter Scout Heather, one, with her husband Michael Willesee Jr.

And on Thursday, Allison Langdon spoke candidly about the challenges she's faced as a mother.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, the Today show co-host, 41, said she 'struggled to cope with stress and fear' after welcoming her son in 2017.

'I was in the office because I was not okay and I struggled with the baby at home. In my mind I had a plan for how to care for the baby but sometimes there's not a solution with a newborn,' she said.

'It took a mate a couple of months in to say "I don't think you're doing as great as you think", for me to realise. And I said "Yeah, I'm not doing great at all",' she added.

Allison went on to say it's important to communicate and start a conversation with others as they may be struggling.

She said: 'We all have the power to save someone's life and change someone's life with a conversation this year. 'It's never been more important to reach out.'

The mother-of-two welcomed her second child, a daughter named Scout Heather, in March last year. 

Allison has been married to fellow journalist Michael for 10 years.

Meanwhile, Allison hosts Nine's Today show with Karl Stefanovic and the breakfast program has recently managed to beat competitor Sunrise in the ratings.

Through the first eight days of September, Today has had more east coast viewers than Sunrise.

On Monday, Today delivered its closest five-city metro result compared to Sunrise since Lisa Wilkinson was Karl's co-host in 2017.
