He's one of Australia's most well-known celebrity chefs.  

And the 41-year-old recently saw his once-lucrative restaurant empire enter voluntary administration in February. 

In addition to his career in the kitchen, he is also a father-of-two - but would you recognise him from this throwback photo taken when he was a little kid? 

Guess who! He's one of Australia's most well known celebrity chefs but would you recognise him from this throwback photo taken when he was a little kid?

In the photo posted to Instagram on Thursday, the young tot is sporting an oversized Scout uniform.

The adorable kid in the photo is none other than former MasterChef judge, George Calombaris.   

'Not sure what’s more funny. The carpet or the wannabe Scout! Circa 1981,' he captioned the photo.

In February, George's MAdE Establishments business folded with just $389 in the bank and owing staff $1.2million in wages and entitlements.  

The business - which previously operated operated 18 venues including the Press Club, Gazi and Hellenic Republic - was put into voluntary administration, leaving about 400 workers in limbo.  

George said he was 'devastated' when his empire went into administration on February 10. 

'I truly regret it has come to this.' The 41-year-old recently saw his once-lucrative restaurant empire enter voluntary administration in February

'To all my team, I truly regret it has come to this. On a personal note, the last few months have been the most challenging I have ever faced,' he wrote on social media.

'At this time, while personally devastated, I remain thankful to my family, friends, the MAdE team, our loyal and regular customers.

'I am so sorry all our collective efforts have not provided to be enough. I'm gutted that it's come to this.' 

The chef is currently running online cooking tutorials called 5pm cook along with George Calombaris.
