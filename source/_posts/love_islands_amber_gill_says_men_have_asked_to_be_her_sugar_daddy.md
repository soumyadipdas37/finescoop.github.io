Love Island's Amber Gill revealed she has had people offering to be her sugar daddy in her DMs since she appeared on the show.

The reality star, 23, detailed her shocking encounters online with Kaz Crossley, Snoochie Shy, and Jordan Hames on BBC 1xtra’s Slide Into My Podcast on Friday.

Explaining how one person even offered her £60k, she said: 'I think I've only had two DMs ever about sugar daddies and I actually accepted the message, not because I was gonna accept the offer, but because I couldn't see like what it was. 

Shocking: Love Island's Amber Gill revealed on Friday that people have asked to be her sugar daddy, while speaking to Kaz Crossley (L) and Snoochie Shy (R) about her experiences online

'You know, when somebody sends something, you can't see what it is, because it's like you need to accept the message in order to see what it is. And I was so intrigued by what was being said.

'I was like, wait, somebody would pay like 60 grand for me to go and spend, like, three days with them?

'And, I don't know. Where was it? I think it was like Dubai or something like that. Madness. So I took the message. But I never replied to the person.'

Wow: Amber (pictured in February) explained that one person even offered her £60k to spend a long weekend with her in Dubai, though she insisted she 'never replied' to them

Surprise: Amber said, 'I was like, wait, somebody would pay like 60 grand for me to go and spend, like, three days with them?'

Adding that the follower kept increasing the amount in a bid to get her attention, she went on: 'So this person keeps like upping the offer. Because obviously I don't ever reply and I don't open them anymore because now I know what it is. 

'And they keep saying, "OK, well, not 40 grand then, we'll do 50 grand for three nights." And I'm [thinking], oh my gosh. 

'Imagine if I [said] yes. And then they were like, "no, actually this is somebody and it went out to the press or something - Amber's got a sugar daddy."'

Insistent: Adding the follower kept trying to get her attention, she went on: 'they keep saying, "OK, well, not 40 grand then, we'll do 50 grand for three nights." And I'm like, oh my gosh'

Not for her: Amber also said, 'Obviously I don't ever reply and I don't open them anymore because now I know what it is'

Last month, Amber branded her ex-beau Greg O'Shea 'pathetic' after he replied to her tweet about winning Love Island a year ago.

She took to Instagram to mark the year anniversary since she was crowned the winner of the ITV2 reality series alongside Greg, 25.

Greg, who dumped Amber just weeks after leaving the villa, replied to her celebratory tweet writing: 'Congrats'. 

Although Amber didn't directly respond to Greg over Twitter, she later said that the tweet was 'pathetic' in response to a fan who claimed it was 'gas' on Tik Tok.

After one TikTok user wrote: 'negl tho but it was ac gas when Greg replied to ur tweet ahahaha yup gregor,' she replied: 'Is gas pathetic? Cos yeah same xx.'

Amber also appeared to air her thoughts the next day in another tweet, which read: 'When people are unhappy within themselves they interpret everything as bitter and shade throwing.

'Let them misinterpret they cannot comprehend someone being unproblematic and unbothered. We don't need any more negativity in 2020 let them be on their b*****it.'

In demand: Amber won the hit reality TV show and £50,000 prize money last year with Irish rugby player, Greg shortly before he dumped her via text (pictured on Love Island) 

Amber recently admitted that she is now 'super-careful' with dating after appearing on the dating series.

The reality TV star revealed that she is 'inundated with proposals in her DMs' but insisted that she doesn't want to be seen as a 'sex symbol'. 

She told The Sun: 'I get inundated with proposals in my DMs but I don't think they mean it and, because of Love Island, I'm now super-careful when I'm dating. 

'I don't want to be thought of as a sex symbol. Oh, God, no! I don't want to be that because there's more to my personality than that.'

Amber insisted that she has a lot more to offer than just her looks and doesn't want people jumping to conclusions based on her appearance or stint on the reality show.

She added: 'I would roll my eyes if someone came up to me in a pub or club and started going on about how gorgeous I was, rather than engaging me in a proper conversation.' 

Amber won the hit reality TV show and £50,000 prize money last year with Irish rugby player, Greg.

The couple met towards the end of the show after she was sidelined by her previous love interest, Michael Griffiths, who began dating Casa Amour newcomer, Joanna Chimonides. They have since split.
