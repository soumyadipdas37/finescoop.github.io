Fiona Falkiner and her fiancée Hayley Willis announced on Monday that they're expecting a child, after a difficult IVF journey. 

And that same day, the happy couple shared their joy in a pregnancy photo shoot in Sydney. 

Fiona, 37, looked positively glowing as she locked eyes with sports reporter Hayley, 30, and cradled her growing baby bump in a stretchy black frock.

The former Biggest Loser host added a tailored black blazer, and kept light on her feet in pristine white sneakers.

Her blonde locks framed her face, drawing attention to a simply radiant complexion.

Appearing in a state of bliss, Fiona gazed adoringly at Hayley, who also placed an affectionate hand on her partner's burgeoning bump.

Not long ago, Fiona spoke about her 'traumatic' and 'lonely' IVF journey in an interview with The Daily Telegraph.

She told the newspaper: 'It is you and your body against all odds. Women don't really talk about it until after the fact. It can be really quite traumatic.'  

Hayley also revealed that she, too, hopes to carry a baby once Fiona has given birth.

'Fi is going first because she is older. I really want to carry a bub too but Fi will go first just because of the body clock on fertility, so her going first is best,' she said.
