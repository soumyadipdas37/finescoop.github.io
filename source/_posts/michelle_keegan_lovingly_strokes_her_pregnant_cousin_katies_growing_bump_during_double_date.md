She turned heads when she stepped out in an off-the-shoulder nude knitted dress.

And Michelle Keegan sweetly stroked her cousin Katie's baby bump as they headed out for a double date in Cheshire with their partners over the weekend.

The actress' cousin shared a snap of the tender moment as they enjoyed a curry together to try and induce her labour, two days after passing her due date.

Michelle displayed her svelte physique in a form-fitting taupe midi dress with off-the-shoulder detailing as she caressed her cousin's growing bump.

Stylist Katie looked equally radiant in a form-fitting nude dress with a white shirt overlay as she shared several snaps from the evening.

Michelle was joined by her husband Mark Wright as they posed for a group snap after the meal, though Katie lamented the spicy curry failed to start her labour.

She penned the caption: 'Curry didn’t work. But what a lovely evening @michellekeegan.'

Katie and Michelle have been no stranger to a night out together and have previously been spotted in an array of glamorous social media snaps.

Michelle recently admitted she loved the lockdown period because it has given herself and Mark the opportunity to spend quality time together, walking their dogs, doing jigsaws and cycling near their Essex home. 

The experience has also given the actress the opportunity to start writing her own material, and she has already had interest from production companies about potentially developing her projects. 

She said in a recent interview with Cosmopolitan magazine: 'We [Mark and I] were saying we'd enjoyed it. It's been nice because we've both been working from home. 

'Normally we could be out all day or I have to go to Manchester [to film Brassic] or Mark is in London. I'm taking my dogs for daily walks, I've been doing a jigsaw a week and I've taken up cycling on a proper road bike. We go out three times a week and do 11 miles!

'I'm writing two things. I've never had the time to sit down, write and research and I'm really enjoying the process. It's a comedy drama and a mini-series drama.'
