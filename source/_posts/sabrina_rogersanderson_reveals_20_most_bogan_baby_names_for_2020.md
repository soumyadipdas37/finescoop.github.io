A parenting author has revealed the most 'bogan' baby names in Australia of 2020 - including Carryn, Klowee, Tygrrr, Jinx and Pistol.

Sabrina Rogers-Anderson, the author of The little book of BOGAN baby names, compiled a top 10 list of the unique names for boys and girls on birth certificates around the country.  

Carryn and Klowee are just some of the more unusual spellings of traditional names parents are using.

While 'Karen' has been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons in 2020, Sabrina said in a humorous piece for Kidspot that naming a child 'Carryn doesn't fool anyone'.

Other very unusual names for girls that made the list include Chablis, Corona, Graceland, Honestee, Jezzabella, Jinx, Jumelle, Klowee, and Pistol.

'Honestlee, this hurts my head. I'm already not a huge fan of the next-gen virtue names, but a misspelt one to boot? I'm out,' she joked about the name 'Honestee'.

Among the most baffling choices for boys are Axe, Bamboo, Chaton, Dagger, Jaguar, Jevin, Mordax, Rad and Tygrrr.

The addition of x and y are becoming increasingly common, with parents naming their son bizarre names like Jaxtynn, in which Sabrina described as a 'train wreck'.

'Just when I thought the random insertion of X's and Y's into children's names was over, this little fella pops up,' she said.
