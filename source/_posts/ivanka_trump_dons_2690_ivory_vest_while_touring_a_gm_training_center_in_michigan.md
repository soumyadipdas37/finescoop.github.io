Ivanka Trump cut a stylish figure in an ivory vest and matching dress pants on Wednesday as she toured General Motors' Technical Learning University in Warren, Michigan. 

The 38-year-old White House senior adviser paired her $2,690 sleeveless top and $995 bootleg pants from Akris with a matching tie-dye face mask during the visit hosted by GM CEO Mary Barra. 

President Trump's eldest daughter appeared to be in bright spirits and was seen elbow bumping electrical apprentice Sylvia Tran as she met with students at the new training center in suburban Detroit.

Outfit of the day: Ivanka, pictured with Deputy Secretary Karen Dunn Kelley, paired her $2,690 sleeveless top and $995 bootleg pants from Akris with a matching tie-dye face mask

Ivanka has faithfully donned a protective face covering for the majority of her public outings, despite her father's wavering stance on masks. She also donned protective glasses as she walked through the facility. 

The former businesswoman has taken great care to match face masks to her outfits throughout the pandemic, with Wednesday's monochromatic look being no exception. 

Ivanka was dressed to impress in her designer vest, which featured a nipped-in waist and layered peplum hem that flattered her figure.   

She topped off the look with a pair of classic white pumps, with the only pop of color coming from her tie-dye mask and the red string bracelet she had on her left wrist. The mother of three has been wearing the bracelet off and on for a few years now.

Although she hasn't spoken about its purpose, it does bear a resemblance to the type of red string that Kabbalah practitioners wear to ward off the 'evil eye.'

Her makeup was also perfectly applied, and she stuck with her go-to beauty look: smokey eye makeup with dark lashes and a rose lip. 

Ivanka's visit to the training center included a stop in the electrical apprentice classroom and an interactive demonstration in the electrical apprentice robotics lab. 

In addition to giving at least one student an elbow bump, she had conversations with several others. She also learned about how GM's training initiatives for both new and veteran employees.   

'This is something that the president has been passionate about since the day he took office, championing the American worker and creating more pathways and opportunities for the American workers,' Ivanka said, according to CNBC.

Passion project: GM is among several corporations supporting White House programs to promote investments in worker training. Ivanka is leading those efforts

GM and White House officials said the meeting at GM's technical center was scheduled long ago and was not a political event.

Warren is in Macomb County, north of Detroit, which will be pivotal to winning Michigan's electoral votes in November. Preserving U.S. manufacturing jobs has been a focus of President Trump's administration since its first day.

Big U.S. corporations face a challenge during a charged campaign season. Barra and GM have not endorsed a candidate in the presidential contest, and will not, company officials said. 

Still, GM has much at stake in policy decisions Trump — or his successor — will make on issues such as tailpipe emissions, autonomous vehicle safety rules, trade, and taxes.

GM is among several corporations supporting White House programs to promote investments in worker training. Ivanka is leading those efforts, including an advertising campaign called 'Find Something New.'
