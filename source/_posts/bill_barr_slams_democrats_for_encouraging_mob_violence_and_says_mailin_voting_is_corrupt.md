Attorney General Bill Barr accused Democrats of encouraging mob violence in US cities as he railed against mail-in voting and mocked the idea that Trump will 'seize power and all that s**t' if he loses in November. 

In a wide-ranging interview with WGN radio aired Monday, Barr claimed that Chicago is 'out of control' following a recent spike in violent crime, alleging that the city 'provides multiple opportunities for corruption'. 

Barrr's harshest criticism came for mail-in voting, however, which he claimed eradicates the idea of a secret ballot, leaves voters open to influence and presents the opportunity for ballots to be bought.

Barr called the recent uptick in violence in US cities 'another very disconcerting development', placing the blame with the Democrats. Pictured, a protester whose feet caught fire after a Molotov cocktail exploded on him in Washington on September 5 

'Just think about the way we vote now,' Barr said. 'You have a precinct, your name is on a list, you go in and say who you are, you go behind a curtain, no one is allowed to go in there to influence you, and no one can tell how you voted. 

'All of that is gone with mail-in voting. There's no secret vote. You have to associate the envelope in the mailing and the name of who's sending it in, with the ballot.

'There's no more secret vote with mail-in vote. A secret vote prevents selling and buying votes. So now we're back in the business of selling and buying votes,' he continued.

'Capricious distribution of ballots means (ballot) harvesting, undue influence, outright coercion, paying off a postman, here's a few hundred dollars, give me some of your ballots.' 

The attorney general also accused liberals of attempts to create an 'incendiary situation' where there will be a 'loss of confidence in the vote' after some floated the idea that Trump will refuse to leave office in the case of a Biden win.  

'You know liberals project,' Barr said. 'All this bulls--- about how the president is going to stay in office and seize power? I've never heard of any of that c**p. I mean, I'm the attorney general. I would think I would have heard about it. 

'They are projecting. They are creating an incendiary situation where there will be loss of confidence in the vote,' he added. 

'Someone will say the president just won Nevada. "Oh, wait a minute! We just discovered 100,000 ballots! Every vote will be counted!" Yeah, but we don't know where these freaking votes came from.'

The idea that mail-in ballots will lead to mass voter fraud has been repeatedly pushed by Trump despite the dangers of coronavirus spread if voters must go to physically cast their vote. 

There is no evidence to suggest that there is an increased risk of fraud with mail-in ballots.  

Barr told the local station that he spent some time in Chicago when he first served as attorney general during the Bush administration but it is not now the city it was. 

'I like Chicago, but things now seem very much out of control,' he claimed. 

'There's certainly a culture here that seems to be unique and provides multiple opportunities for corruption. And the public integrity part of the U.S. attorney's office has never been at a loss for work,' Barr later added.

Barr also railed against mail-in ballots. Pictured, a protest to support the USPS  in NYC. Americans are expected to vote by mail in large numbers due to the COVID-19 pandemic

'Many cities have sort of unique cultures (of corruption). L.A. has a different kind of corruption. New York has a different kind. Washington is corrupted by power in many ways. This (Chicago) is sort of, well, I'm not sure what I can say and get away with it.' 

He called the recent uptick in violence in US cities 'another very disconcerting development', placing the blame with the Democrats, stating 'increasingly the message of the Democrats appears to be "Biden or no peace".

'As an attorney general, I'm not supposed to get into politics,' Barr added of the election, before declaring the the U.S. had reached a choice that could take them toward socialism if Trump does not win. 

'I think we are getting into a position where we're going to find ourselves irrevocably committed to a socialist path. And I think if Trump loses this election, that will be the case. In other words, I think now there's a clear fork in the road for our country,' he continued. 

'What's very strange that all the great thought that has inspired our country… the principles and the thinking behind it have been forgotten by a large segment of the people. 

'Not even forgotten, because they probably were never taught about it, they've never considered it.'
