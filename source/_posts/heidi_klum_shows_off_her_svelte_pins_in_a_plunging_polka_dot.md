She has just wrapped on the most recent series of America's Got Talent, which was won by spoken word poet Brandon Leake.

And Heidi Klum was already back to business on Thursday evening, as she did some late night filming for another project just a day after the finale aired.

Wow! Heidi Klum was already back to business on Thursday evening, as she did some late night filming for another project just a day after the finale aired

The television host's thigh-skimming gown featured puff ball sleeves and ruched detailing across the middle of the garment.

Heidi teamed the stylish number with a pair of strappy stilettos, which were tied around her ankle and boosted her already statuesque frame.

She wore her blonde locks in a loose style in soft waves, and sported a glamorous coat of make-up including a bold red lip and heavy eye make-up look. 

Tiring! Heidi later shared an image after finishing filming wrapped in a big white duvet, while travelling on the back of a golf buggy

Heidi was most recently serving as a judge on NBC's America's Got Talent after returning to the show following a brief hiatus.

Now the reality show has come to an end, she will be heading to her native Germany this fall with her four children, whom she shares with ex-husband Seal.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the next season of her series Germany's next top Model can't film as usual in Los Angeles where Heidi lives, and so instead she is having to relocate to Berlin for three and a half months to film the show there.

No doubt also accompanying her will be husband Tom Kaulitz, a guitarist with German rock band Tokio Hotel.

She and Tom, 31, tied the knot in secret in February 2019 after starting to date in early 2018.
