Cat and husband Patrick recently relocated to the UK after living in Los Angeles for 14 years, where she hosted US series So You Think You Can Dance?

Speaking about her move to the US, she said: 'I think the thing that would surprise the young me about her future is what's happened in America.

'I mean, I never went to America when I was a kid. I never went to Disneyland or anything like that, I'd never even seen it before.

'And when I did go, I never made a great proclamation: ''I'm going to crack America.''

'A relationship had just ended and I just fancied a fun adventure. It did feel crazy at times... There's no way my 16-year-old self would believe me if I went back and told her she'll be there one day.'

Coming home: Cat and husband Patrick recently relocated back to the UK after living in Los Angeles for 14 years, where she hosted US series So You Think You Can Dance?

Happy: Cat and Patrick headed out and about with their family for the day to enjoy the warm sunshine

The veteran host also recently confirmed that she will be reuniting with her SMTV co-hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly for a one-off special looking back at the beloved Saturday morning show. 

The presenter told The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X that she's already filmed the special and it will air at the end of the year.

'I can confirm… yes.' Cat teased, when asked about it by Chris. 'We have filmed a documentary, it's going to be aired at the end of the year.

'We went back to the studio where we did it. They rebuilt the set. We all cried. I walked in and [Ant & Dec] were doing their interview and Dec was crying and I was like ''ok you're crying!'' and then at the end of my interview I was like [sobs] ''waaah!'' 

Off we go! The family later sat down for lunch in a pub before heading home together
