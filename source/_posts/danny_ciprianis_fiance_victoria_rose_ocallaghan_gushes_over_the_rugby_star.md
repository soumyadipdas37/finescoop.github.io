In her lengthy caption, Victoria penned: 'I can’t say I’ve ever been a great fan of public displays of affection however I’m all for breaking out of my comfort zones so here goes. It’s been very challenging to read what I’ve read about myself lately...

'Life always balances itself out perfectly though. I lay back every night feeling completely grateful for my perfect Family and amazing Friends...

'I wake up every morning appreciative that I am lucky enough to spend another day with all the people I love. Ive spent a lifetime making sure everyone else is ok so it’s the greatest feeling to be showered with the love I get from you.

'I love you. I fully accept you. I am so proud of the man you are. What you have achieved and I am counting down the sleeps until I become your Wife'.

Danny will become a stepfather to her two children, Jade Austin, 24, and a teenage son, 14, when the pair marry in October. The sportsman will take on the role of step-grandfather after Victoria's daughter Jade became a mum four years ago.

Danny's fiancée gave birth to her first child when she was just 14, with the pair often mistaken for sisters now that Jade has a daughter of her own.

The pair went public with their relationship in June, with Danny saying the mental health campaigner makes him 'the happiest man in the world.'

Danny, who's previously had long-term relationships with Kelly Brook, 40, and Katie Price, 42, referred to Victoria's children on Instagram, saying: 'You make me want to be the best man I possibly can for you and our family.'

The rugby player found love again four months after expressing his heartache over the tragic death of ex-girlfriend Caroline Flack, who he described as 'so kind and so beautiful' in an emotional video on social media.

Danny's new fiancée was born Victoria Rose O'Callaghan and is from Derby, but has also used the surnames Hare and Newbold throughout her life.

Victoria has had two long-term relationships before falling for Danny, including with Steven Austin, who is the father of her daughter, and ex-boyfriend Gavin Dunnicliffe.

Danny's future wife also had a brief fling with Alex Reid, 45, in 2012, shortly after his split from ex Katie Price.

Victoria welcomed her first child when she was 14 with former partner Steve, who tragically died aged 22 in September 1999, leaving the young mum to raise their baby on her own.

Zara Newbold, 31, who's Victoria's half-sister, told MailOnline of her sibling's difficult past, and said her and Danny are lucky to have found each other.

Speaking at her home in Derby, Zara said: 'She was very young when she had her first baby. She and Steve were happy together and I think they would have had a long lasting relationship...

'But he died in not a very nice accident leaving Vicky with a young baby, which was hard for her. We grew up in Derby but Vicky later ventured out, she wanted bigger and better things. She moved to Essex and then London.

'I hope Danny will provide a good, solid and loving relationship for her. That's all she wants, not the fame and fortune. She had been single for a while and when she said they were together I wasn't surprised. She knows a lot of A-listers. And we spoke again after he proposed.

'I've not met Danny yet but looking forward to. We've spoken and he sounds very nice, very chilled. She couldn't have met a better person.'
