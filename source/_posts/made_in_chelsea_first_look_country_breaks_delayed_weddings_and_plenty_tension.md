Questions urgently need answering during the new series, namely will Olivia Bentley be in with a chance of a summer fling as some new faces join the group on her country getaway with close friend Tiffany Watson? 

There may well be plenty of opportunity, with Harvey Armstrong, Emily Blackwell, Verity Bowditch, Freddie Browne, Maeva D’Ascanio, Sam Holmes, Amelia Mist, Tristan Phipps and James Taylor also along for what promises to be an eventful ride. 

However the close proximity could lead to heated face-offs as Verity and Tristan meet for the first time since ending their relationship over the phone.
