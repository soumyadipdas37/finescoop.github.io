Juventus have terminated Gonzalo Higuain's contract a year early, paving the way for him to join David Beckham's Inter Miami, according to goal.com

The 32-year-old striker is believed to be on his way to America after his agent agreed personal terms on a two-year deal with the MLS side.

The Argentine is surplus to requirements at the Allianz Stadium and Andrea Pirlo is looking to replace him with Barcelona forward Luis Suarez.

Higuain's brother - Nicolas - landed in Italy on Tuesday for negotiations with Juventus over his departure.

He was expected to meet Juventus directors to discuss details of terminating Higuain's Â£6.3million contract by mutual consent.

Now those talks appear to have been concluded, Higuain is set to link up with David Beckham at his new MLS franchise Inter Miami.

Higuain has won three Serie A titles with the Italian club.
