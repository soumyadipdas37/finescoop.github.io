Ian Somerhalder also appeared at the socially distanced premiere of his upcoming  documentary, Kiss the Ground.

While the pair posed for a few shots wearing masks, which had the name of the Woody Harrelson-narrated documentary emblazoned on them, they eventually slid them.

Additionally, Somerhalder sported a wide grin, as he expressed his gratitude by placing his two hands together, in a gesture of appreciation.

The new Netflix documentary, which will be released on September 22, takes a closer look at climate control and ways we can change the way we treat our planet. 

Created by filmmakers Josh and Rebecca Tickell, Kiss the Ground aims to show viewers how to stabilize the Earth's climate, restore ecosystems, and replenish food supplies. 

'There's so much bad news about our planet, it's overwhelming. Truth is, I've given up,' the film's narrator, Woody Harrelson, told People last month. 'This is the story of a simple solution, a way to heal our planet. The solution is right under our feet — and it's as old as dirt.' 

The outlet revealed the film's trailer detailed how 'destroying soil in agriculture has created an influx of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.'

'To cure our planet we need to cure our soil,' a title card reads, with an expert speaking about biosequestration. 

The star-studded documentary includes appearances from Patricia Arquette, Gisele Bündchen, Jason Mraz, David Arquette and more.
