Olivia Culpo is known for having an incredible fashion sense. 

And on Wednesday, the model and former Miss Universe winner put on an utterly chic display yet again as she stepped out for dinner in Sherman Oaks, California. 

The 28-year-old beauty exuded old Hollywood glamour in a tailored cream ensemble as she enjoyed a night out with friends.

For her upscale meal at celebrity favorite Le Petit Trois, Culpo radiated elegance in a very dressy outfit. 

Wearing a white St John dress, Olivia paired the pristine garment with more unforgiving white accessories as she dined al fresco. 

The brunette stunner threw on a pair of beige Texas Paris boots that elevated her already formal look, as she carried a matching Bottega Veneta bag.   

She wore her signature brown locks perfectly tied back in a low bun, rounding out the sophisticated look with a pair of statement gold Balenciaga earrings.

She was accompanied by a male friend who cut an equally stylish display as the two chatted up a storm. 

The Rhode Island native was seen perusing the menu and sipping on a vodka martini before switching over to a fruity pink cocktail.

In another snap Culpo was seen making a repulsed face, clearly having a hard time stomaching the strong drink. 

The fit model braved the very messy burger in her all white ensemble, jokingly telling her followers that she would stop with the food content, before adding that she doesn't get out much.

Later in the night, the stunner posted a video of her getting attacked by kisses from her dog Oliver Sprinkles in a sweet Instastory.  

Recently, Olivia spent time with her NFL boyfriend Christian McCaffrey, 24, in North Carolina where he plays running back for the Carolina Panthers.  

The loved up pair started dating in May of 2019 and have been inseparable ever since. 

The relationship is her first public one since her breakup with wide receiver Danny Amendola after a messy on-and-off three year relationship.
