MasterChef stars Callum Hann and Laura Sharrad failed to walk away with the $250,000 grand prize this season.    

But the pair proved to still have a firm friendship when they attended Winter Market at the Green in Adelaide on Sunday. 

Callum and Laura joined forces during a Q&A to speak about their visions as restaurateurs and their love of the industry.

The pair also spilled on their experience on MasterChef: Back To Win, while Laura talked about running Nido under strict COVID-19 rules.  

Laura looked animated, as she pushed her chestnut brown tresses behind her ear. 

The cooking star spoke playfully into the microphone. Meanwhile, Callum gesticulated heavily during his time on the stage.

Laura kept her look glamorous wearing a pink turtleneck sweater which she paired with tight blue jeans and a black jacket. 

The 'pasta queen' finished her outfit with nude-hued heels.  

She opted to wear her luscious brown locks down by her shoulders. While she finished her look with a matte makeup style.

Callum looked handsome in a pair of blue jeans along with a maroon shirt which he wore partially unbuttoned. 

He finished his outfit with a faded blue denim jacket.

Callum and Laura are known to be great friends on and off the screen. 

Happy go lucky! Laura was only too happy to speak to the gathered audience at the event

Beloved South Australian chef Callum broke down in tears in a July episode, as he spoke of sending Laura home in an elimination round.   

After finishing his cook, Callum fought back tears: 'I think it is starting to hit me,' he said.

'This is very real, there's a 50-50 chance I'm going home or getting to the semifinal, which means I'm sending Laura home.'

Laura was equally upset at the possibility of sending Callum home, with her also breaking down in tears.  

This isn't the first time the Adelaide-based pair have met up. They joined Poh Ling Yeow for a lesson at Callum's cooking school this month. 

The 2020 season of MasterChef: Back to Win was taken out by Emelia Jackson.
