The biracial siblings rarely post about each other on social media, and Sofia actually used to say she was 'closer' to Paris Hilton than Nicole.

'It's really nice to have [Paris] kind of, as like a sister, because she's been through it all!' Richie told Wonderland Magazine back in 2016.

'She gives the best advice and she wants the best for me and she sees how my path is going. She's really rooting for me and giving me the best tips, how to avoid certain things and how to be the best version of myself that I can be.'

As for Nicole, the ex-girlfriend of Scott Disick noted: 'She used to take me to fairs and all sorts of things. It was bizarre! It was definitely a weird life, going out and seeing her with a million paparazzi.'
