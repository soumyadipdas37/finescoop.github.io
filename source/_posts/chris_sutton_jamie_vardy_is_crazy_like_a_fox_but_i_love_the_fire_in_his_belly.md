title: CHRIS SUTTON Jamie Vardy is crazy like a fox but I love the fire in his belly!

There was a flappy eagle celebration when he scored at Crystal Palace. The cupped ears towards a wall of Sheffield United supporters, many of whom gave a middle-finger salute in return. How about the time he took a bow in front of West Ham fans at London Stadium?

You’d be hard-pressed to find a bigger wind-up merchant than Jamie Vardy. Sunday was the latest example of him poking fun at the opposition. He put a penalty away then cupped his ears towards the empty seats at the Hawthorns. 

The thought of that is slightly odd to me - I can’t ever recall cupping my ears after scoring, even when supporters were there!

But it’s good that Vardy, at 33, still has that fire in his belly. He’s pumped up, and if he’s getting to perform these celebrations it means he’s doing his job by scoring goals. 

The race for the Golden Boot is up and running. Mo Salah got his three goals on Saturday, two from the penalty spot. Vardy is on his way, too, despite West Brom’s attempts to deny him.

Slaven Bilic’s formation of choice in the Championship was 4-2-3-1, but yesterday he opted for 5-4-1. It didn’t work. I have a friend who supports West Brom and asked him recently what it will take for them to survive. 

‘Pray,’ he said. These players have a significant scrap on their hands.

Vardy's celebrations, including him taunting an empty stadium, mean he is back in business
