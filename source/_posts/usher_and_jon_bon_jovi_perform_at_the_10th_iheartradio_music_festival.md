It kicked off with a bang on Friday with appearances from Alicia Keys, Offset and more music industry luminaries.

And on Saturday, the iHeartRadio Music Festival continued its 10th annual edition with performances from headliners Usher and Jon Bon Jovi, along with other beloved artists.

Usher, 41, broadcast from a red-lit stage in Burbank, California, beaming from the stage in a futuristic outfit.

The Grammy-winning singer this month released a new single called Bad Habits, from his forthcoming solo studio album – his first in four years. 

Usher showed off his cool ensemble – consisting of a plasticine bomber jacket that was akin to a police uniform and tailored slacks with substantial buckles – on social media as well. 

Bon Jovi, meanwhile, rocked the stage from Nashville, Tennessee, led by Jon, 58, in all black. 

The event isn't allowing any in-person attendance, however, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The crooner and his band – who've been active in the music scene since 1983 – are on the cusp of releasing their 15th studio album, the unfortunately titled Bon Jovi: 2020.

The record was initially scheduled for release in May, but was delayed due to the pandemic.

In the interim, Jon wrote two more songs, one in support of the #BlackLivesMatter movement and in protest of George Floyd's death, and another titled Do What You Can inspired by the fight against COVID-19.
