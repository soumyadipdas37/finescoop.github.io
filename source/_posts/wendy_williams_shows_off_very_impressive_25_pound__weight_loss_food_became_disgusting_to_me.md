It was a new look for The Wendy Williams Show and it was not all the socially distanced audience. 

The 56-year-old chat show host showed off a very impressive 25 pound weight loss during the show's season 12 premiere on Monday.

She looked in great shape as she paraded around the set of her talk show in a fluorescent green long-sleeve dress with a cinched waist.

Wendy proudly declared 'I mean I've lost 25 pounds' as a socially distanced audience consisting of her staffers cheered her on.

Her explanation for how she was able to lose the weight was simply that she grew tired of food.

Wendy said: 'And I didn't do it on purpose it was just that food became disgusting to me. I was cooking at first and it was all good, I was shoveling stuff in my mouth.'

As the television personality often used to document her meals on social media, several photos from her eating escapades were shown on the screen behind her. 

She explained: 'Everything from hot dogs to lobster, king crab legs all that stuff, but then it became I’m done with food and then I got my colonoscopy.'

Wendy said that it may be too much information but she had her regular procedure done and the doctor revealed how much weight she had actually lost.

Definitely pleased with herself, she said: 'I haven’t weighed this little since high school.'

The Wendy Williams Show shut down production in mid-March, as the coronavirus continued to spread, but she did film some shows from home.

The show was shut down indefinitely for Williams to focus on her health issues related to Graves disease, with Williams revealing in June why she stopped filming from home in a video to her fans.

Last month, Wendy may have hinted at her healthier eating habits as she gushed that the 12th season of her eponymous daytime talk show would return on September 21 while posting a photo of herself enjoying some cubed watermelon. 

'I can’t wait to get back to all of YOU and to my AMAZING staff and crew!!! I’m sooo excited to bring you silly, funny, glamour and hopefully brighten your day during these crazy times that we’re all living in…even if for just an hour,' she wrote.

'I miss you and can’t wait to get back in my purple chair and show you what we did to the set. I LOVE you for watching!'
