Few have forgotten when Drew Barrymore flashed late night host David Letterman during a 1995 appearance on his show.

So, the newly minted daytime host, 45, reflected on her wilder days while opening up ahead of the premiere of her namesake talk show on CBS Sunday Morning.

Recognizing the fine line between must-see-TV and the inappropriate, the lifelong actress said: 'I think if there's one thing I've learned in a very long life in front of people is there is a line.'

'There is TMI. And I kind of know what that line is, and it's a feeling,' Drew went on.

While her decades of experience being interviewed helps, she was also blessed with hosting advice from Letterman himself.

Drew's first talk show appearance was a visit to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson when she was just seven.

When CBS's Lee Cowan asked if Letterman or fellow late night talent Jimmy Fallon had any tips about the 'secret sauce' of talk show success, Drew said staying consistent was key. 

'They all say pace yourself, which, of course, I in my stubbornness was like, I've been working since I was 11 months old! You don't even know my work ethic.'

Drew previously opened up about her saucy moment on Letterman in a 2018 interview with Late Show host Stephen Colbert, telling him it was now a 'distant memory' for the mother-of-two. 

'I literally was like, "What?" I sometimes think, "That doesn't feel like me." It's like a distant memory that doesn't seem like me – but it is me,' she dished.

But Drew made it clear she has no regrets about her completely carefree days, saying: 'That's kind of cool. I'm still down with that.'

'I'm a mother of two. I don't know. I'm such a different person now that it doesn't feel like me, but I'm still into it.'
