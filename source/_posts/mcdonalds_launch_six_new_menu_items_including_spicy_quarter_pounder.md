McDonald's has delighted fans by launching six new menu items.

The fast food chain is expanding its Quarter Pounder with Cheese range with three variants of the classic fan favourite available from next Wednesday at all stores across the UK. 

From 7th October – 17th November burger fans can take their appreciation to new heights and enjoy a Spicy Quarter Pounder with Cheese, a Quarter Pounder Deluxe as well as the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese which launched in August.

The menu sees three new Quarter Pounder burgers including deluxe (left), double (centre) and spicy (right)

The new Quarter Pounders aren’t the only items being added to the menu – fans will also be able to get their hands on the new McChicken BLT from 7th October, along with the much-loved Nacho Cheese Wedges (£1.79) which will be returning as a portion of five or a Sharebox (£4.79). 

McDonald’s customers rejoiced back in August when the Double Quarter Pounder was added to the permanent menu, alongside a Triple Cheeseburger.



McDonald's Quarter Pounders are made 100 per cent British and Irish beef.

The Spicy Quarter Pounder is made with two slices of pepper jack cheese, onions, jalapenos, mustard and a spicy ketchup in a sesame seed bun.

For those feeling fancy try McDonald’s are also offering a Quarter Pounder Deluxe for £4.89.

The patty is topped with shredded lettuce, a slice of tomato, slice of cheese, pickles, fresh onions, cool mayo, ketchup, mustard, and streaky bacon all in a round sesame topped bun.

The two new variants will be available alongside the classic Quarter Pounder with Cheese and the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese. 

 The Salted Caramel Latte completes the line-up of limited-edition classics available until 17th November.

The fast food chain is also bringing in a McChicken BLT for £5.19 as part of its new range

It comes after the fast food giant announced the Jam Muffin, that starts at 99p as well as a Dairy Milk McFlurry and a Cadbury Caramel McFlurry last month. 

In line with Government guidance, social distancing and safety measures at restaurants remain in place. 

This includes hand sanitiser at every entrance for delivery couriers, dine-in and takeaway customers, table-service and contact tracing for customers who dine-in, and carefully managing the number of customers and crew inside each restaurant.
