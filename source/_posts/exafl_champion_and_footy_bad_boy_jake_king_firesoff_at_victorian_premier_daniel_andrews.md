Former AFL star Jake King has labelled Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews a 'dumb arse' in an emotional and expletive-ridden video posted to social media. 

King, who retired in 2014 after playing 107 games for the Tigers and kicking 79 goals, lashed out this week after the premier revealed he would not be lifting Stage Four lockdown as planned. 

The near 13-minute rant comes amid a plethora of criticism aimed at Mr Andrews' stubborn plans to keep Victorians locked down for close to the remainder of the year.

Jake King has unloaded on Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews in an emotional video 

'I've attempted this twice now,' King begins, 'and to be honest, I've found it extremely difficult to do without swearing.'

King confesses that he's 'not a very educated bloke' academically before unleashing on the premier in a raw display of emotion.

Known for his rugged and tough performances on and off the field, King has made headlines since leaving the game mostly over his friendship with colourful Melbourne bikie Toby Mitchell. 

Mitchell, who has been shot multiple times and now rides with the Mongols, has helped promote King's tattoo parlour in South Melbourne, which has been closed under the state's draconian lockdown laws. 

'Dan Andrews, what you're doing mate, is the biggest crock of sh*t I have ever heard. And you saying you take responsibility of what you're doing is the safest thing for the Victorian people - you must be brain dead,' King says.

The 36-year old blasts Mr Andrews for the flow-on effects the lockdown has had on the mental well-being of Victorians. 

Just last week, senior doctors across Melbourne urged politicians not to support a state of emergency extension, saying the move threatened to destroy the mental health of fed-up Victorians.

The letter was later supported by more than 600 doctors who pleaded with the Victorian Government to consider 'an alternative medical response' to the crisis. 

In King's video, the former champ questions the mental state of the premier himself. 

'There is something seriously wrong with you,' he says.

King explains that most of the people dying from COVID-19 are elderly citizens with existing medical conditions. 

'The elderly are letting go because we're not there to support them, thanks to you,' he says. 

In angry outbursts, King is seen losing his cool as he speaks passionately about the mental toll of the lockdown on his fellow Victorians. 

'You're a deadset coward,' he says. 'You're as weak as ... it's really hard doing it without swearing.'

King says he is fed up with Mr Andrews' press conferences where he routinely states his lockdown measures are to ensure the safety of Victorians.  

'I'm starting to get fed up with seeing you say you care on the news, you couldn't care less, you imbecile,' King barks. 

'You talk about kids and their education. How the kids are our future. Mate, you couldn't give two stuffs about the kids ... it's depressing, it's stressful and you're traumatising these poor friggin kids.'

King claims practically everyone he now interacts with is suffering from depression. 

'Depression is the norm. Everyone's got it now. Because of you, you imbecile,' he shouts. 

'And the way that you're trying to run this state. It's a joke. It's not okay.'

King describes the emotional and financial toll of the lockdown on his friends and family, whom he has been unable to visit now for months. 

He lashes out at everything from dodgy welfare payments to the ever increasing costs of electricity, gas and water. 

'You haven't made it mandatory for them to help us out, have you you dumb arse. We can't afford it. Everyday people can't friggin afford it,' he says.

'And then their mental state is dropping. Enormously. It's starting to piss me off and it's starting to piss everyone else off. '

As he looks at a text book lined with notes, King continues to tick off points as he cuts loose on the premier. 

He attacks bureaucrats and politicians for failing to take pay cuts and public transport continuing to operate with practically no-one on board. 

'We can't go anywhere you d**khead ... Why are parking inspectors still f**king working,' he shouts.  

By the end, King fights off tears as he addresses the personal toll of the lockdown on his own business and life. 

King says he was forced to attend a funeral for a mate who suicided during lockdown via Zoom web conferencing. 

'I couldn't give his dad, his mum, his brother or his sister a hug,' he says. 'I couldn't show them my support. I couldn't be there to say my goodbyes. You took that away from me. I'll never get that back.'

King said people he had grown up idolising had now 'buckled at the knees'. 

'My mates, who all need help, who I talk to day in, day out on the phone, listen to them cry. How tough they're doing it because they've got no money, because they don't have a job anymore, because they don't know what to do with themselves,' he says. 

'Well I'm not good either. Enough's enough. My business has suffered enough, my family has suffered enough, my brothers, my sisters have suffered enough, my mates have all suffered enough. Find out a way to get this state back open.'

King ends by pleading with the premier to establish a panel of ordinary Victorians to advise him on a way forward out of lockdown.
