Edouard Mendy is currently undergoing a medical ahead of his £22m move to Chelsea from Rennes. 

The 28-year-old goalkeeper is set to sign a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge and will compete with under-fire keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga for the No 1 jersey. 

Blues boss Frank Lampard confirmed the Senegalese would be a Chelsea player subject to being given the all-clear following the medical test and also praised Petr Cech for his role in bringing Mendy to the club.

Frank Lampard praised the role of technical and performance advisor Petr Cech in the deal 



Lampard said: 'Petr was important in that. It's a particular position and he has had a big say and was very instrumental.'

The Chelsea manager was however sympathetic towards Arrizabalaga's situation following a string of high-profile mistakes.  

'I think competition is a regular thing at a club like Chelsea. The goalkeeper situation isn’t always as clear cut as that. Kepa himself wants to improve his own performances,' Lampard added. 

'It’s in everyone’s hands to push and develop to try and get in the team. I am not making any final statements at all in this minute.

'It is the hardest position because of the individual nature of it and mistakes get punished with goals. I understand that and as a manager I have to be sympathetic to that point. I am very aware of that.'

The Blues boss is also hopeful that Mendy will be in the squad to face West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday.  

'As far as I'm aware, as long as he passes his test with us on Thursday and if that is negative then he should be okay to play.'
