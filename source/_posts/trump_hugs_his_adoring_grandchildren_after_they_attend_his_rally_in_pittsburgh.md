President Trump spent Tuesday night tough-talking at a raucous rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

But the Commander-in-chief showed a softer side straight after leaving the stage. 

The 74-year-old was photographed hugging his adoring grandchildren Arabella Kushner, nine, and Joseph Kushner,six, as he made his way back to Air Force One. 

Despite taunting Joe Biden and boasting about his first-term achievements up at the podium, the President looked just like any other grandfather as he enjoyed the precious moment. 

Arabella and Joseph had joined their parents, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, to attend Tuesday night's rally, which was jam packed with more than 1,000 supporters.

Making memories! Jared and Ivanka appeared to be eager to introduce their eldest children to the rough and tumble of politics by bringing them along for the quick campaign trip. Arabella was seen snapping some previous moments on her iPhone 

The foursome were seen on the tarmac in Pittsburgh on Tuesday night. The youngest member of the family, three-year-old Theodore, appeared to have stayed behind back in Washington, D.C.

The First Daughter looked chic in a beige coat and bright red turtleneck, as she waved to the crowds and sported a beaming smile. 

It appeared Jared was also in an upbeat mood, seen grinning after his father-in-law's hour-long stump speech. 

The political couple have much to smile about, as it appears all-but-certain Trump has the numbers to push through a new Supreme Court justice before the November 3 election.

During his appearance in Pittsburgh, Trump took aim at Presidential rival Joe Biden, saying he would destroy Pennsylvania's energy industry because he will be pressured by the 'radical left' and their plans for a Green New Deal. 

He also mocked Biden for wearing a face mask, and made a joke about the Democrat nominee's alleged plastic surgery. 

Elsewhere, the Commander-in-chief also professed his love for fracking and the police, before he mocked Elizabeth Warren over her claims that she had Native American ancestry.
