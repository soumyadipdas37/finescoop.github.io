Eliminated Bachelor star Paige Royal has revealed she's been 'fighting off a monster virus' during Melbourne's stage-four lockdown.

The 31-year-old reality TV star shared a photo of herself holding a rose to Instagram on Monday, and revealed she's been feeling unwell.

'Who would have thought a rose I bought a few weeks ago is not only still alive but healthier than I have been. I have been fighting off a monster virus that thankfully is not COVID,' she wrote.

'Melbourne Stage 4 lock down is difficult but I cannot wait for us to come out on top and to be allowed to travel and see loved ones again. I especially can't wait to see my Bachy girls but I'll just continue cheering them on my tv screen for the time being.'

Paige went on to say 'the past 12 months has had some crazy highs and some super lows.'

'I felt like things really caught up with me in this lockdown as I was forced to be alone with my own thoughts. I am so thankful to my friends who have been there for me through it all,' she said.

She ended: 'If you're having a bad day, bad week or just a questionable bloody 2020, don't be afraid to reach out and let someone know you're not ok, we are in this together.'

Paige appeared on Locky Gilbert's season of The Bachelor but was one of the first women sent home.

Following her elimination, the reality star revealed on Instagram she bought herself a rose after she failed to score one from Locky.

'While I didn't receive a rose in the mansion, I did receive one tonight because I bought one for myself,' she said, before adding: 'It is important to love yourself.'

In the clip, the model sported a black singlet and wore her brunette locks loose as she held up the flower.

Paige showed off her natural beauty with minimal makeup and appeared to have a filter on the video.

After her short-lived stint on this year's season of the hit reality dating show, the 31-year-old moved on with new boyfriend, Matthew Sannen.
