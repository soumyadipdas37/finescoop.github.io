She's the daughter of one of the nation's biggest music stars. 

But Anais Gallagher has ditched her bustling life in London for a quieter dwelling in Dorset, after moving to the countryside with her boyfriend Julius Roberts.

The child of Oasis legend Noel Gallagher and Meg Matthews, 23, recently shared a glimpse of her new home in the sprawling fields, as she raised a family of goats with her chef beau.

In recent video posted to Instagram, Anais shared a glimpse of her journey to the country with boyfriend Julius and their pals, as London continues to be gripped by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Along with enjoying dinner and card games by candlelight, the model proceeded to chase after a field full of goats, before relaxing in a field to enjoy the stunning views.

On Sunday, Anais also took to social media in the midst of her relaxing country walk, though she appeared to be struggling with the chilly weather.

She then went onto find the views from an incredible waterfall in the middle of the picturesque countryside.

It seems that Anais has taken travel inspiration from her beau Julies, who states on Instagram he left London in 2017  

Anais first revealed her romance with chef Julius in July, and has since shared a slew of loved-up snaps with him.

Typically Anais isn't shy when it comes to displaying her incredible physique and has previously shared plenty of scantily-clad Instagram snaps.

In May she set pulses racing again in a picture showing her just in her underpants and a cropped cardigan. 

Before then, she smouldered in a racy set of Agent Provocateur lingerie complete with suspenders and stockings.   

The model posed wearing an underwear set, including a suspender belt in her mother Meg Mathews's home on social media.

Speaking previously to NME, Anais told how it was normal for her to watch her father perform on stage as a child and she has only become 'emotional' watching his shows more recently.

Anais revealed the band's Wembley Stadium gig in 2009 is her earliest memory of an Oasis performance.

She said: 'Obviously I went to lots of Oasis gigs, but this is the one I can remember most vividly.

'I particularly remember being very upset there were no Cadbury Buttons in the dressing room – a huge travesty for eight-year-old me.

'People expect the memory of Oasis to have been just as crazy for me as it was for them, but I was born watching my dad onstage so it didn't really faze me.

'I've only started getting properly emotional when I see him onstage recently. Before, I was slightly oblivious.'
