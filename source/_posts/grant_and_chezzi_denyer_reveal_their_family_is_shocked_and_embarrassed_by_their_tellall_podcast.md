Their no-holds-barred podcast has seen them discuss their affair, sex life, drug dependency and parenting struggles.

However, Grant and Chezzi Denyer have admitted that their candid revelations have taken their mortified family members by surprise.

Speaking to WHO Magazine, Chezzi, 41, explained: 'They said, "You're just so honest. Aren't you embarrassed? And I was like, "No, that's just us."'

Chezzi, who is pregnant with the couple's third child, went on to admit that her clan's concerns surrounding her honesty didn't deter her.

'If you think this is hashtag juicy, then get ready - we're just warming up,' she cheekily added.

In the tell-all interview, Grant added that they shared a unique bond because she had 'cared for him in his darkest hour'.

Speaking of the monster truck accident which almost took his life in 2008, he said: 'I depended on her. She illuminated the path out of trouble for me. That's a pretty thick bond - more than for a couple of people who met in a seedy nightclub.'

Chezzi remained by her husband's side every step of the way during his recovery, and they ended up marrying in 2010. 

This comes after Chezzi revealed on their It's All True podcast that she and Grant had started dating when they were both with other people.

'It was a rough journey - it wasn't like what you see in the movies,' said Chezzi, who was Grant's producer on Sunrise when he joined the program as a weatherman.

When they first got together, Chezzi was married to another man, and Grant was dating another woman.

'It was problematic; it took a long time to navigate,' Grant said.

In another episode Grant revealed how his life went downhill during an addiction to painkillers.

The Family Feud host was on a concoction of Endone and morphine while recovering from a broken back injury after his monster truck accident.

The side effects from his drug use were so bad that the star once woke up surrounded by faeces and believed his wife was being raped by an intruder.

Grant and Chezzi share two daughters, Sailor, eight, and Scout, four, and Chezzi recently confirmed she was pregnant with their third child.
