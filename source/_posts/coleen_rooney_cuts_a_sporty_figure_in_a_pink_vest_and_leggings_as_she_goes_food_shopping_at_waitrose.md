She is in the midst of a WAG war with her arch rival Rebekah Vardy.  

But Coleen Rooney put her legal woes to one side as she headed out food shopping at Waitrose in Cheshire on Thursday. 

The mother-of-four, 34, cut a casual figure in a pink P.E nation vest top and black leggings.

She teamed her sporty look with trainers and wore a black vest underneath her pink top. 

Coleen tied her hair in a high bun and added a touch of glamour to her look with her dazzling diamond earrings. 

The WAG appeared in good spirits as she left the shop laden with bags and headed back to the car.

Coleen's very public feud began when she accused Rebekah, wife of footballer Jamie Vardy, of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies. 

It has since been claimed that Coleen wants to undertake 'forensic analysis' of Rebekah's electronics to look for evidence, according to a report from The Sun. 

A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'Coleen met with her lawyers and they’ve told her they need to continue putting together more evidence.

'She needs to prove that Becky was directly responsible for the leaks or, at the very least, that the information came from her social media account.

Healthy appetite: Coleen certainly has her hands full with fours sons and husband Wayne to feed

'Coleen is adamant she is right, but in a legal setting the evidence she has may not be enough to cross the threshold.'  

It was also claimed by the publication that Coleen and her legal team will reportedly need a court order to be able to do so. 

Coleen reportedly declared that she 'won't be bullied' by Becky when their libel case goes to court.

A source told The Sun that 'Coleen is totally confident. She says she won't be bullied and is ready for a scrap.'    

Coleen has also said she won't be intimidated by 'strong-arm tactics' saying Rebekah's attempt to hurry along legal proceedings are 'laughable'.

This follows further claims that Coleen said she is 'not worried at all' about Rebekah's apparent rush to bring their WAG war to court 'immediately'.  

According to reports, Coleen has told pals that her WAG rival is only speeding things up as she's 'concerned' what Coleen's lawyers will find. 

MailOnline has contacted Coleen and Rebekah's representatives for comment.
