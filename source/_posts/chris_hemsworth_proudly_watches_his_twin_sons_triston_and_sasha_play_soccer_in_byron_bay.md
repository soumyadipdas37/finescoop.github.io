He's the Hollywood superstar with a reported net worth of $130million. 

But Chris Hemsworth, 35, looked like any other doting father on Saturday as he watched his twin sons Tristan and Sasha, six, play soccer in the New South Wales coastal town of Byron Bay. 

The father-of-three stood on the sidelines as he kept a watchful eye over his boys as they raced around the field together. 

Soccer dad! Chris Hemsworth, 35, proudly watched from the sidelines as his twin sons Triston and Sasha, six, played soccer in Byron Bay on Saturday 

Displaying his bulging biceps during the sun-drenched outing, Chris sported a T-shirt emblazoned with the words 'It's all good'. 

He also wore a pair of khaki cargo pants and black running shoes. 

Chris' bronde locks were swept neatly to the side, while his famous visage was obscured behind black sunglasses.

Clutching a blue drink bottle in one hand, Chris was seen pacing up and down while fully focusing his attention upon the energetic youngsters. 

The boys looked cute as a button in casual clothing as they practiced kicking a ball through the net. 

In April 2019, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Chris and his actress wife Elsa Pataky, 44, had signed Tristan and Sasha up for junior football in their hometown.

The boys were said to have joined the 'mini roos' at Byron Bay Football Club, close to their home. 

Chris and Elsa are also parents to eight-year-old daughter India.  

In April, Chris revealed he was struggling to get their three children to concentrate on their studies while homeschooling amid the coronavirus pandemic.

'Home schooling them is an absolute challenge. It's three hours of negotiation and maybe 20 minutes of actual work,' he said at the time.

The star, who was self-isolating with his family in their $20million Byron Bay mansion, added: '[My children] just crave interaction with other kids so much, obviously, and that's a challenge.'

Despite being Hollywood megastars, doting parents Elsa and Chris are very hands-on with their children and are regulars at the school gate. 

The couple relocated to New South Wales from Los Angeles in 2014, and haven't looked back since. 

Elsa previously told Stellar in 2017 that she enjoyed the more laid-back lifestyle in Byron Bay and was happy to be treated more like 'a local' than a celebrity.
