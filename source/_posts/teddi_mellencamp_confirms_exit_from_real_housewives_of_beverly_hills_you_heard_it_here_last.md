The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Teddi Mellencamp confirmed Tuesday that her Bravo contract 'was not going to be renewed.'

'It was sad. It feels like a break-up almost because you develop such strong relationships with the cast with the crew and you get to do incredible things that you probably never get to experience without the show,' the 39-year-old daughter of John Mellencamp said via Instagram.

'That being said, I'm really looking forward to the future and being able to focus on my family, my friends, all in. I really feel like I have some exciting things ahead.'

'You heard it here last!' The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Teddi Mellencamp confirmed Tuesday that her Bravo contract 'was not going to be renewed'

Teddi had appeared on the show for three seasons after joining in 2017. The 10th season came to a close earlier this week with the final reunion show.  

A production insider previously told DailyMail.com: 'Teddi will be advised this week that she will not be picked up for another season.' 

'The network has not been impressed with her performance on the show,' the insider continued. 'They considered cutting her last season but gave her one last chance.’ 

'She is boring and stale and does not offer anything to the franchise with her robotic and staged delivery when interacting with the other cast members.'

'The issue is, the other cast members don't particularly like her and beyond Kyle [Richards] no one is friends with her.

'Kyle will most likely dump her, when Bravo does.'

It seems that Teddi's off-camera pursuits have also raised questions about her suitability to be on the show. 

The mother-of-three defended her All In weight loss program in an Instagram video posted Tuesday, after receiving criticism over the program's restrictive nature and alleged aggressive nature of the brand's coaches.

The insider added: 'The network has been less than impressed with the war she is in with influential Instagrammer Emily Gellis.

The source added: 'The network has not been impressed with her performance on the show.

'It is concerning that she is pushing a business that young women, Bravo's key audience, are claiming is unhealthy and downright dangerous.'

'Regardless of how much Teddi begs to keep her job when she is told, the network will not change their mind. She's done.'

Alleged former clients of Teddi's program have come forward with their experiences, shared by Gellis, claiming that they were initially restricted to approximately 500 calories while being required to do a daily hour of cardio. 

The program, which prides itself on 'accountability' has four different levels starting with a two-week Jumpstart plan before clients can move to the Monthly program, Weight and Workout and then maintenance. 

According to the site, it costs $599 for the two-week Jumpstart program, $399 for the monthly program, $165 for the Weight and Workout program and $95 for a Maintenance program. 

All In also offers a postpartum plan, that Teddi has advertised on her own social media after welcoming her daughter Dove seven months ago.

A registered dietitian messaged Gellis asking her followers to 'report' All In to the 'dietics licensing board in their state,' claiming that the program was 'violating licensing laws and causing harm from nutrition coaching.' 

The influencer wrote a post herself saying 'Not one medical professional has messaged me saying this diet is OK.' 

Teddi and her husband of nine years Edwin Arroyave welcomed their youngest child, daughter Dove, in February. They are also parents to son Cruz, 6, and daughter Slate, 7. 

Meanwhile, Denise Richards, who is married to Aaron Phypers, recently announced she won't be returning to Real Housewives of Beverly Hills after two season. 

Accusations the Wild Things actress had an affair with Brandi Glanville became key focus last season despite her efforts to have the storyline scrapped via a cease and desist. 

Newcomer Garcelle Beauvais along with show veterans Lisa Rinna, Kyle Richards, Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley are expected to return.
