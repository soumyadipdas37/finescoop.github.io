The build-up to the new Premier League season has begun in earnest after the fixtures for the 2020-21 campaign were released.

Clubs are slowly returning to training ahead of the September 12 restart date and are beginning to book in friendlies to build their fitness levels over the next three weeks.

This pre-season may be a little different to the globe-trotting tours and International Champions Cup we have become used to, but there is still plenty of action to look ahead to. So keep track of all the arranged fixtures and results with our handy guide.
