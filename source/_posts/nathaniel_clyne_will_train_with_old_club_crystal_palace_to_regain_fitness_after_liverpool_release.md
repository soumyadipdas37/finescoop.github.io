Former Liverpool defender Nathaniel Clyne will train with Crystal Palace to boost his fitness levels and potentially earn a return to Selhurst Park.

Right-back Clyne, 29, was released by the Premier League champions back in June having missed all of last season because of a cruciate ligament injury.

Clyne came through the academy ranks at Palace and played 137 times for the club between 2008 and 2012 before signing for Southampton.

The right-back missed all of last season with injury and hasn't played since a loan spell at Bournemouth in 2018-19

Current manager Roy Hodgson played Clyne 14 times when manager of England and has now allowed the free agent to train with his squad for the rest of September.

He could have the opportunity to win a contract at Palace with Hodgson in need of cover in the full-back areas when he begins training from Monday.

Hodgson said: 'He didn't train with us today, I haven't seen him.Â 

'He was coming to be tested so he could take part in some training over the next couple of weeks where he is keen to show his fitness to us and other clubs.

Palace manager Roy Hodgson confirmed Clyne will have the chance to regain his fitness

'We are happy to welcome him into the fold and give him that opportunity.'

Palace did sign right-back Nathan Ferguson this summer with Joel Ward and Martin Kelly other options in that position.

Ward started their Premier League opener against Southampton, a 1-0 win, last Saturday while Kelly played in Tuesday night's Carabao Cup defeat to Bournemouth.

Clyne hasn't played a senior game since May 12, 2019 when he was on loan at Bournemouth from Liverpool.

His last appearance for Liverpool prior to that was on December 29, 2018.
