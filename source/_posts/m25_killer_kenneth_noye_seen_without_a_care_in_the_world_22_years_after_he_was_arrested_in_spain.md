Road rage killer Kenneth Noye has been spotted laughing while walking down the street in south east England on the 22nd anniversary of his arrest in Spain.

The 73-year-old gangster was controversially released from a life sentence in June last year after stabbing Stephen Cameron, 21, to death in May 1996.

After the murder, Noye fled the country, sparking a two-year international manhunt before he was arrested in Spain in August 1998.

Stephen's fiancée Danielle Cable, just 17 at the time of the murder, helped identify Noye in a Spanish restaurant before he was arrested and later testified against him in court.

He was pictured last weekend enjoying the bank holiday near a railway station in south-east England, according to the Mirror.

The 73-year-old gangster, pictured, was controversially released from a life sentence by the parole board in June last year after stabbing Stephen Cameron, 21, to death in May 1996

 

Kenneth Noye, now 73, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 16 years for the murder of Stephen Cameron after he stabbed the 21-year-old to death on the M25 in 1996

One onlooker told the Mirror he looked 'happy' and didn't have 'a single care in the world' before adding: 'Despite being in his 70s he still looks really fit and strong.'

Noye made headlines earlier this year after he was pictured visiting the scene where Stephen was killed.

Just days after the 24th anniversary of the murder, Noye was spotted at the M25 slip-road near Swanley in Kent where he killed Stephen.

Noye returned to the murder scene at 4pm on May 28 in his black VW Tiguan, a brand new £25,000 car he bought shortly after his release from Standford Hill.

After leaving an Asda, Noye made his way along the B2173, past the road where Stephen and his family lived before joining the A20. 

It was the exact same route Danielle, who has since been given a new identity, and Stephen took. 

He then drove to the roundabout and traffic lights where he killed Stephen before heading in the direction of Surrey.

It is unclear why Noye was in the Swanley area. 

Noye also served 14 years in prison for handling gold bullion stolen in the 1983 Brink's-Mat heist and he is thought to have millions hidden from the £26million robbery.

The 73-year-old, who was also once acquitted of murdering a policeman after claiming self-defence, was allowed to walk free after the Parole Board ruled he was safe for release.

On his release from jail in June, Stephen's family branded his sentence 'not justice' and a senior detective in the case said it was 'a joke'.

But Noye's plan to return to his £2 million Spanish bolthole, a hilltop mansion, was thwarted after he was told he must live in Britain as a condition of his release.

Under the conditions of his release, Noye can only leave the country in 'extra special cases' such as a family bereavement.

Whilst on-the-run for Mr Cameron's murder, Noye lived under a fake name and hid in fishing villages near Cape Trafalgar, in Cadiz province.

He is believed to have kept hold of his four-bed villa in Atlanterra, which was looked after by his sons Brett and Kevin.
