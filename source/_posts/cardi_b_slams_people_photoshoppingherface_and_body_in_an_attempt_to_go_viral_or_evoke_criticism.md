Cardi B didn't hold back after she saw an altered image of herself online, which she believed was posted to incite the public to 'bash her.' 

In the images, the star, who was purchasing $5,000 gifts for children in need at Target, can be seen wearing a cropped grey hoodie and a pair of fitted sweatpants. 

In a since-deleted Instagram post, she wrote: 'It's the fact that people try to photoshop my face and body to post on their platform so people can bash me and make me feel down on my appearance on purpose….and the fact this a paparazzi picture from months ago.'

'That's why I pray everyday and God keep blessing me triple in people face cause they done tried everything to bring me down from making rumors about me to now photoshopping me tryin to make me go viral with a photoshop pic of a paparazzi pic from months ago,' she fired to her 75 million Instagram followers.

'The sad sh*t is that the people that be doing these rumors and be trying to make people bash me about my looks are WOMEN,' the mother-of-one concluded.  

In another deleted post, she questioned if people photoshopping her made them laugh or 'feel better.'
