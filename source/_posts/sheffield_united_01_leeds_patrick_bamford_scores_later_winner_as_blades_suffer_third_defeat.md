We’ve all heard the old adage about strikers who can score goals in the Championship but not in the Premier League. Patrick Bamford is proving the antithesis of that maxim.

So much was made of Leeds needing to sign a goalscorer this summer. They would struggle, we said, if left to rely on a centre-forward who netted just 16 times from 45 appearances for the second-tier champions last season. He should, said the Expected Goals (XG) boffins, have scored 35 times 

But here he is, three games and three goals later in the Premier League, the latest a cute header to win this Yorkshire derby at the death. He is, for the record, the first Leeds player ever to score in his first three top-flight matches for the club. 

Patrick Bamford's late header gave Leeds a 1-0 victory over Sheffield United at Bramall Lane

The striker met Jack Harrison's cross to steer an effort across goal and beyond Aaron Ramsdale

It's now three defeats from three games for Chris Wilder's side who are yet to score this season

Sheffield United (3-5-2): Ramsdale; Basham; Ampadu; Robinson; Baldock; Lundstram (Norwood 64); Berge; Osborn; Stevens; McGoldrick (McBurnie 74); Burke (Sharp 74)

Subs not used: Fleck; McBurnie; Sharp; Lowe; Jagielka; Foderingham 

Booked: Lundstram; Baldock

Leeds (3-1-4-2): Meslier; Ayling; Koch; Cooper; Philips; Costa (Poveda 66); Klich; Dallas; Harrison; Bamford; Roberts (Rodrigo 45, Ailoski 90)

Subs not used: Struijk; Davis; Caprile; Shackleton

Booked: Philips 

There were only two minutes remaining when winger Jack Harrison loaded a cross from the left and Bamford peeled free on the fringe of the six-yard area.

It needed a scruffy connection to score, for this was all about direction, not power. And so Bamford provided it, guiding back across goal to leave the previously impassable Aaron Ramsdale wrong footed.

The victory leaves Marcelo Bielsa’s new boys on six points and Chris Wilder’s Blades - their old Championship adversaries - on none. And Wilder has much to ponder despite an improved performance.

The absence of Jack O’Connell from the home team-sheet was followed by Wilder revealing the centre-back will miss the entire season with a knee injury. Already working within a restricted budget and having made no secret of his desire for a striker, O’Connell’s loss could well cause a few quick recalculations for the Blades boss.

What he would have been hoping for, then, was some overdue inspiration at the top end of the pitch. Wilder’s side were the only non-scorers in the Premier League in the opening two weeks and registered a divisional-low of 13 shots.

For the best part of half an hour they barely looked like adding to that tally, let alone score a goal. It was all Leeds as right-back Luke Ayling brought a flying save from Ramsdale and Bamford headed over from eight yards.

So the sight of home midfielder John Lundstram striding onto a rolling ball unopposed eight yards out was entirely out of sync with the balance of the game. No matter. All he had to do was steer it either side of Illan Meslier and the Blades were up and running for the season.

It is difficult, then, to attribute this to a miss or a save. Lundstram’s connection was true but Meslier bettered that with a disbelieving instinct as he extended an arm to divert clear. 

John Lundstram forced a great save from Leeds goalkeeper Ilan Meslier in the first half

It was a great opportunity for the Blades to score their first league goal of the campaign

Stuart Dallas managed to go round Aaron Ramsdale but Chris Basham cleared off the line

Ramsdale soon produced a fine stop of his own at the other end - shovelling around the post after Stuart Dallas had scooped towards the top corner - but the half ended with another stupendous save from the granite wrists of Meslier, this time to deny George Baldock’s wicked drive.

And so the tale of two goalkeepers extended into the second half, Ramsdale fisting to safety Helder Costa’s low blast before smothering Mateusz Klich’s devilish delivery into the goalmouth.  

But Ramsdale needed centre-back Chris Basham to preserve that clean sheet on 61 minutes when Stuart Dallas skipped around him and snapped a shot on goal from a tight angle. Basham, though, had read the unfolding danger and recovered to hack clear from the goal-line.

Meslier, too, had to rely on a Blades centre-back to maintain his shutout, only this time it was a point-blank miss from Jack Robinson, who stabbed wide from three yards out amid a crowd of bodies from a corner.

And how Wilder was left to rue that miss when Bamford climaxed a Leeds break to win this first Yorkshire derby in the Premier League for 20 seasons. 

It was a physical battle between the two Yorkshire rivals with Leeds coming out on top

Marcelo Bielsa's side have now won back-to-back league games and currently sit in sixth place

Host commentator

Sportsmail's live coverage is heading to north London now for Tottenham's clash against Newcastle!

Join me using the link below for the 2pm kick off.

It's all over! Leeds have the bragging rights!

They left it very late, but Patrick Bamford's header into the far corner proved enough for Marcelo Bielsa's side. That's two wins from their first three fixtures.

As for Sheffield United, they are really struggling. It was a much improved performance, but Illan Meslier stood tall when needed to shut them out against all the odds. They sit rock bottom for now.

90+4min: It looks as though the misery will continue for Sheffield United after that late Patrick Bamford header.

That's three in three now for the Leeds man. He's well and truly silencing his doubters.

90min: We're into five minutes added time! Is there hope for the hosts? Remember they haven't scored a league goal this season yet.

Marcelo Bielsa has made another change. Bizarrely it's the substitute Rodrigo who has been hooked off. Ezgjan Alioski is on.

88min: First blood in the Yorkshire derby! It's Patrick Bamford who has made the breakthrough once again!

The in-form striker was able to wriggle between two defenders and guide Jack Harrison's sublime ball back across Aaron Ramsdale and into the far corner. It's a brilliant header.

84min: Ouch. George Baldock has just slammed into Illan Meslier after Oli McBurnie's little flick inside the box, and both players went down straight away. Baldock's first touch was heavy, and his momentum carried him straight into the midriff of the Leeds stopper. They'll be fine to continue.

82min: What a chance! The hosts have gone so, so close to finally opening the scoring! A superb in-swinging delivery from the right deceived Oli McBurnie's diving header, and Jack Robinson could only divert wide after dangling out a hopeful leg just yards out.

78min: Ian Poveda spearheads a rapid Leeds breakaway, but his effort from the edge of the area was palmed clear once again by Aaron Ramsdale. 

The visitors are able to recycle possession, and a devilish ball curled back into the area from Stuart Dallas forces the Sheffield United keeper to deflect behind for a corner.

72min: Rodrigo bends an effort straight at Aaron Ramsdale as we edge into the latter stages of the clash. Still goalless...

Billy Sharp and Oli McBurnie have replaced Oliver Burke and David McGoldrick.

70min: George Baldock is shown a yellow card for a rash lunge in on Stuart Dallas.

Play is then stopped after a powerful strike from Rodrigo was blocked bravely by Ethan Ampadu, who fell straight away to the turf. That looked very painful, and the medics are on.

He's soon able to continue, thankfully. 

67min: Ian Poveda is on for his Premier League debut after replacing Helder Costa.

65min: Stuart Dallas hurtles down the flank and delivers into the box. His ball in is met by Rodrigo, but the substitute can only guide his header comfortably off target after flinging himself forward. 

64min: Oliver Norwood is on to replace John Lundstram in Sheffield United's first change of the afternoon. The midfielder was so unlucky to have not netted the hosts' first goal of the campaign in the first half.

62min: Chris Basham has to scramble back and clear Stuart Dallas' weak effort away from the empty goalmouth! A routine punt forward somehow managed to squirm through the home side's defence, and Aaron Ramsdale's rush out to the edge of his area handed Dallas a glorious opening.

58min: John Lundstram is the next player to go into the book after a trip on Stuart Dallas.

The hosts soon piece together a lovely move down the right side, which ends with Enda Stevens forcing Illan Meslier to palm away an effort bound for his near post. Lundstram had teed up his team-mate with a cheeky back heel.

56min: Aaron Ramsdale comes to the hosts' rescue once again. Patrick Bamford is played inside the box, but struggles to fashion an angle to shoot under pressure from Jack Robinson. The Leeds striker's effort is then stopped by Ramsdale at the foot of his near post.

54min: Both sides are looking to hit each other on the counter in the early stages of this second half. It is the final ball that is again lacking, however.

Mateusz Klich whips a dangerous cross into the box with plenty of power, but Jack Robinson is able to clear.

48min: Jack Harrison drives down the left almost immediately after the restart and his cross is blocked by Chris Basham. There are vague appeals for handball, and referee Paul Tierney gives a wry smile. Nothing doing, however.

From the corner, the ball nodded into the air and towards the far side of the box. Helder Costa then forces Aaron Ramsdale into another sharp stop down low to his left.

46min: Welcome back to the action at Bramall Lane! Will we see out first goalless draw of the season?

Leeds' club record signing Rodrigo has replaced Tyler Roberts at the break.

John Lundstram couldn't believe it. Neither could I. Maybe even Illan Meslier himself couldn't...

After just one minute of added time, that's the break! We're goalless at Bramall Lane with both goalkeepers producing heroics.

Illan Meslier denied John Lundstram and George Baldock in spectacular fashion, while Aaron Ramsdale leaped to his right to claw away Stuart Dallas' goalbound strike.

Join us for the second half soon!

44min: The corner that came from Illan Meslier's stop sees Ethan Ampadu go to ground under pressure from Stuart Dallas and appeal for a penalty. Referee Paul Tierney is having none of it. 

Sheffield United come forward again as we edge towards the break, although Oliver Burke opts to shoot rather then feed through a very unimpressed David McGoldrick on the right side of the box. His effort is comfortably blocked.

40min: Both goalkeepers are absolutely excelling so far. George Baldock rolls past the sliding Jack Harrison on the edge of the area, and cannons an effort towards Illan Meslier's near post. The Leeds stopper's strong palm prevents the hosts from netting their first league goal of the season.

38min: Aaron Ramsdale is forced into action to deny Stuart Dallas! The Leeds man attempts a clever effort from the edge of the box with the outside of his right boot, but Ramsdale is able to leap across and palm around the post.

36min: This game is flowing nicely from end to end! Leeds lose the ball and Oliver Burke is able to race into the area, but his effort from the left is smothered brilliantly by a sliding Robin Koch.

34min: Jack Harrison's cross from the left picks out Patrick Bamford, who drifts between Ethan Ampadu and Jack Robinson inside the box. The in-form Leeds striker, who has netted in both league games this season, rises highest and nods over the crossbar. 

30min: Wow, what a save! Illan Meslier denies John Lundstram in spectacular fashion! Ben Osborn races down the left flank and crosses into the box. David McGoldrick cleverly flicked the ball backwards into space for Lundstram, who thinks he has scored after letting fly across the Leeds stopper.

28min: Mateusz Klich tries his luck from distance at the other end, but his powerful strike deflects up into the air and Aaron Ramsdale claims under pressure from Patrick Bamford.

26min: Stuart Dallas wins a free-kick, which Kalvin Phillips then lifts into the box from the right side. Patrick Bamford wins his header, but is only able to glance his effort narrowly off target.

22min: That's much better from the hosts. Chris Basham races forward superbly and plays the ball into the left channel. Oliver Burke then collects possession and, after a sharp flick on the byline, Ben Osborn smashes in an inviting cross which Jack Harrison is able to hoist clear.

20min: Enda Stevens and David McGoldrick look to combine sharply down the left-hand side, but Luke Ayling and Helder Costa are able to scamper across quickly. The Leeds full back wins back the ball.

16min: It's been an impressive start from Leeds. They have hassled and harried Sheffield United at every twist and turn, and the home side's wide players have been forced to slot into a back five because of the tempo.

13min: David McGoldrick tries to break clear behind the Leeds backline once again, but goalkeeper Illan Meslier was fastest and pounced on the loose ball forward.

11min: Ethan Ampadu steps in to break up a Leeds attack, and Sander Berge then races towards the box. He played the ball across to David McGoldrick on the right, but the frontman's attempted cross was cut out by Mateusz Klich.

10min: This clash has unsurprisingly got off to a lightning fast tempo! Paul Tierney plays advantage after Kalvin Phillips felled David McGoldrick, and Ben Osborn then plays through John Lundstram. His effort is dragged wide of goal.

Phillips is then booked for that foul. He'll have to be very careful for the rest of this one.

5min: Luke Ayling forces Aaron Ramsdale into a sharp save down to his right. The Leeds full back, who has started the game incredibly high down the right side, jinks one way, then the other, and fires towards the far corner from 20 yards.

4min: Mateusz Klich collects the ball inside the final third after a flowing breakaway and is able to shift a wonderful pass across to Jack Harrison on the far side. His ball across the box is blocked.

2min: Sander Berge lofts the ball forward for David McGoldrick, who is wearing the captain's armband for the hosts today, and the striker does well to hold the ball up. He is closed down quickly, though, and Leeds are handed a goal kick.

1min: We're underway at Bramall Lane!

Right then, we're just minutes away from this local rivalry kicking off!

Any last-minute score predictions?

Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa has faced the cameras for his pre-match interview and admitted that he is hoping his team are harder to break down at the back today.

He said: 'We hope to score as many as we did the first two games and concede less.'

All those chaotic training sessions are paying off for this Leeds team under Marcelo Bielsa!

They went toe to toe with champions Liverpool on the opening day, despite conceding four, and netted four against Fulham last week to pick up their first win of the season.

BT Sport pundit, and former Leeds defender, Rio Ferdinand watched one of the team's sessions in preparation for this derby and admitted he was shocked with the work rate! Let's see if they prove crucial again today.

Just under 20 minutes to go until we're underway for the first Yorkshire derby of the season!

The lack of squad depth may come back to haunt Chris Wilder this season now Jack O'Connell requires surgery on a knee injury.

The Blades boss has just confirmed to BT Sport that the defender may be ruled out for the rest of the season.

He said: 'Jack O'Connell is possibly out for the season and probably needs a knee operation. He tried to come back and then had to have a scan. We had to adjust pretty quickly and he established himself in the Premier League last season. It is a huge blow for him and us.'

John Fleck also misses out with a minor setback.

The last time these two teams faced off in the Premier League was a 2-2 draw at this ground in 1994!

It is also the first Yorkshire derby in the division since 2001, when Leeds hit six past Bradford City.

Ethan Ampadu is making his first Premier League start for Sheffield United today, with John Egan suspended following his red card last week.

The 20-year-old is spending the season on loan at Bramall Lane from Chelsea.

Sheffield United are the only top flight team yet to score this season, but face a Leeds side who have shipped seven goals in their first two games back in the big time.

We've already seen tonnes of goals behind closed doors this year, so hopefully we'll see plenty more this lunchtime!

The hosts have made three changes from the team that lost against Aston Villa last weekend. 

John Egan is suspended and drops out alongside Jack O'Connell and John Fleck. Ethan Ampadu, Jack Robinson and Ben Osborn have come in.

Leeds, meanwhile, made just the one change. Tyler Roberts has been drafted in for the injured Pablo Hernandez.

Starting XI: Meslier, Ayling, Koch, Cooper, Dallas, Phillips, Klich, Costa, Roberts, Harrison, Bamford

Substitutes: Caprile, Alioski, Struijk, Davis, Shackleton, Poveda, Rodrigo

Starting XI: Ramsdale, Basham, Ampadu, Robinson, Baldock, Lundstram, Berge, Osborn, Stevens, Burke, McGoldrick

Substitutes: Foderingham, Sharp, McBurnie, Jagielka, Norwood, Fleck, Lowe

Welcome along to Sportsmail's live coverage of Sheffield United's home clash with Leeds.

It is the first Yorkshire derby in the Premier League in 19 years, and the hosts will be hoping to finally get their first points on the board.

They face a Leeds side who simply cannot stop scoring... or conceding.

This has all the makings of a classic, so stay tuned!
