Britney Spears took to Instagram to endorse an 'insightful and life-affirming' book called The Inner Goddess Makeover on Tuesday. 

While the 38-year-old performer typically shares high-spirited dance videos with her followers, she urged her 26.4 million followers to pick up a copy of the tome by writer Tanishka, which is a combination of autobiographical accounts and ancient women's wisdom.

'I promise … this is a good one,' she captioned a shot of the book's cover. 'It is a workbook that helps you strengthen all aspects of your womanhood.'

In her caption, the Grammy-winning performer also confessed she has 'only studied the chapters' she thought she would 'most benefit from' from the 224-page guide. 

According to the The Inner Goddess Makeover summary, it is broken into 'seven steps to meet and understand the seven universal feminine aspects.'

Britney expressed her hope that the principles would 'strengthen' her 'Just a Touch of Rose' and 'RED' projects, which she has recently began to open up about.

After a number of her followers inquired about her choice to repeat one outfit multiple times, Spears provided some clarification, earlier this month. 

'A lot of people have been saying that a lot of my posts are not new but they're old. But just to let you guys know, none of my pictures or posts are more than a month old,' she explained.  

'Yes, I know I did wear the same top 17 times. But it's for a project, Project Rose. And you will be seeing way more of Project Rose in the future,' she noted. 

Britney previously referred to her personal photo project as the 'Just a Touch of Rose' shoot in an August 21 post.

Since March 25, Spears has shared 17 depictions of the flower as well as countless rose emojis embedded in her captions.

'Some say they smell the fragrance of roses while communicating with angels in prayer or meditation. Did you know? I didn't either!' the Mississippi-born blonde wrote on July 21. 

She continued: 'Angels use rose scents as signs of their spiritual presence because roses have energy fields that vibrate at a high electrical frequency - the highest of any flower on Earth! Pssss ... in other words buy some damn roses!'

Britney's latest post comes as the fate of her conservatorship and financial freedom has been the dominant topic among her droves of fans. 

While Britney herself hasn't directly brought up the issue on social media, many fans have speculated that her seemingly innocuous posts – whether they display yoga and dance routines, a flowery photo project, or new fashions – betray a secret or encoded cry for help.

Last week, it was reported her stars' divorced parents Jamie and Lynne Spears are allegedly 'at war with each other' over what's best for her.

'Lynne wants a care plan established that would transition Britney's personal life out of the conservatorship,' a source told Us Weekly on Monday.

'Jamie has told her that Britney needs long-term monitoring, and he doesn't think she is prepared to take such a drastic action.' 

Britney is reportedly more engaged than ever in the legal battle, wanting to unseal details of her conservatorship rather than keep them 'hidden away in a closet as a family secret.'
