They might be somewhat of an unlikely country duo, but their combined vocal talents have created something irresistibly catchy. 

On Thursday, Keith Urban unveiled the new music video for his duet with Pink, called One Too Many – which the pair debuted via a virtual performance at this week's American Country Music Awards.

The dreamy video sees Urban, 52, taking one of the song's first lyrics – 'Woke up on a couch, sunrise' – quite literally: he wakes up on a sofa at sunrise, in the middle of the ocean.

The Australian crooner is decked out in his 90s-style Goo Goo Dolls hair, a black t-shirt and faded jeans along with black boots.

He sits and stands on his waterlogged couch, rocking out on his acoustic guitar as if he were on stage. 

Soon, he is joined in the clip by Pink, 41, as she walks along the surf at the coastline, singing against a lovely hued sunlit sky. 

The Don't Let Me Get Me songstress is in a silky and rather modest white floral dress, with a bow at the collar.

While the pair share the screen at certain moments, it's evident that the video, much like the song itself, was conceived and produced during the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore the artists remained apart.

The bluesy song has elements of pop, folk and modern country thrown into the mix, with lyrics ruminating on the pressures of being in a relationship. 

The video contains passages with actors on other floating couches, as they act out the trials and tribulations of love.

The two musicians debuted the new song, from Urban's brand new album The Speed of Now Part 1, at Wednesday's 55th annual ACM Awards.

And while Keith was present on stage as host of the awards, Pink joined him virtually for the duet.  

Earlier this week, Urban spoke about how he has 'always loved Pink’s voice' in a media statement. 

'Her artistry and her multi-faceted ability to create, and her God-given talent, truly makes her one of the greatest voices of our time,' the 15-time ACM Award-winner noted.

Speaking with ET Canada, Keith added, 'And again, her as a person, it's also why she's been around a long time. She's absolutely astounding and it was great to get to do that with her.'

While the global coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns presented challenges for the musicians to collaborate, they are proud of the end result. 

The Speed of Now Part 1 is the eleventh studio album by the New Zealand-born country singer and husband of Nicole Kidman. 

The album was released Friday.
