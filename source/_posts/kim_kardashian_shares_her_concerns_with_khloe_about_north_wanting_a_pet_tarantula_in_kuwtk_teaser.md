Kim Kardashian has been very open about her fear of spiders.

But it seems like daughter North, seven, does not share her phobia in the least bit.

In the latest teaser for Thursday's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim shared her concerns to sister Khloe Kardashian about North wanting a tarantula as a pet.

Kim rocked a gray sweater with her locks half-up, and half-down as she chatted with Khloe, who donned a zip-up jacket. 

'So North conned me in to go to this pet store, that was right near her school and she wants to see the tarantulas,' Kim tells Khloe.

'I go up to the lady and say listen, I'll pay you a $100 bucks just say they are mean to kids, not good pets, they bite everyone, say whatever you got to say, I'll pay you,' the mother of four explained.

'The woman is like, "They make great pets, do you want to hold it?" Pulling it out, showing her. I'm literally like,' as she makes an exacerbated facial expression.

Riveted: Khloe looked very interested at Kim's story about her visit to the pet store with North

Directly to the camera, Kim says: 'I have a pretty awful relationship with spiders. I absolutely hate them.'

A flashback of a Kardashian holiday caught on KUWTK plays, where her mom Kris Jenner tells Kim there is a spider on her. 

'No there's not mom' as she ran around looking very upset, before screaming and ripping off her jacket and then crying.

In the clip, Kris told her to stop and tried to help her get the spider off as well as calm Kim down, who was hysterical at this point. 

Back to the present day camera interview, Kim says: 'But North has brought up several times now that she wants a pet spider. And that is absolutely never going to happen. Like never, ever, ever, as long as she is living under my roof. Never going to happen.'

Khloe then suggested to Kim to 'just get over this fear of yours,' before Kim mentioned 'Just like whales for you.'

Khloe is terrified of whales, which is was also documented on the show after she couldn't get herself to go in the ocean because she was terrified.

No to pet spiders: Back to the present day camera interview, Kim says: 'But North has brought up several times now that she wants a pet spider. And that is absolutely never going to happen. Like never, ever, ever, as long as she is living under my roof. Never going to happen'

Khloe says: 'Oh stop it! Who the f**k would even approach a big a** whale. That's like sick,' as Kim says: 'That's like the same thing with tarantulas.'

Khloe noted that North 'knows that's your biggest fear like on the planet,' which left Kim speechless.

Directly talking to the camera, Khloe says: 'North has always had an obsession with spiders. We don't know why. It's so ironic because Kimberly is so afraid of them. North touches spiders, North catches spiders and I think she just wants to share her love of spiders with her mom. So I want to be supportive of North and plan something to help Kim conquer her fear of spiders.'

Thinking of a plan of action: Directly talking to the camera, Khloe says: 'North has always had an obsession with spiders. We don't know why. It's so ironic because Kimberly is so afraid of them. North touches spiders, North catches spiders and I think she just wants to share her love of spiders with her mom. So I want to be supportive of North and plan something to help Kim conquer her fear of spiders'

Khloe then asked Kim what she plans on doing, to which Kim said: 'Maybe I'll be sitting there and looking at my phone and I'll be like "Oh My God did you hear the news? All these kids died from tarantula bites!"'

Adding: 'I'm just going to scare the s**t out of them' as Khloe says: 'That's not good.'

KUWTK season 19's next episode airs on Thursday on E!. 

Her plan: Khloe then asked Kim what she plans on doing, to which Kim said: 'Maybe I'll be sitting there and looking at my phone and I'll be like "Oh My God did you hear the news? All these kids died from tarantula bites!"'

Too funny: Adding: 'I'm just going to scare the s**t out of them' as Khloe says: 'That's not good'
