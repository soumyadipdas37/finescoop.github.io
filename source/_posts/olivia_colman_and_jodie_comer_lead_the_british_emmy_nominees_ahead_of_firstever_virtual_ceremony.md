Olivia Colman and Jodie Comer are among the British nominees ahead of this year's Emmy Awards, which will take place with a largely virtual ceremony due to the pandemic on Sunday night.

The Crown star, 46, has been recognised in the Best Actress in a Drama Series category for her portrayal of the Queen in the Netflix hit, while fellow thespian Jodie, 27, is looking to hold the prestigious title once again for Killing Eve after winning the award last year. 

Producers have sent over 130 home video kits to stars for their remote speeches, and Jimmy Kimmel will anchor the show from LA's Staples Centre as other presenters are set deliver gongs to some of winners' homes in full tuxedo hazmat gear.

Competition: Olivia Colman (L in the Crown) and Jodie Comer (R in Killing Eve) are among the British nominees ahead of this year's Emmy Awards, taking place on Sunday night 

Olivia won instant acclaim late last year when she debuted in her two-season run as Queen Elizabeth II, taking over the Royal role from Claire Foy.

Jodie, meanwhile, has won consistent plaudits for her compelling portrayal of assassin as Oksana Astankova/Villanelle in the BBC America spy thriller series.

Screen stars Olivia and Jodie will compete with other big names in the business, including Jennifer Aniston, The Morning Show; Laura Linney, Ozark; Sandra Oh, Killing Eve; and Zendaya, Euphoria.  

Normal People's Irish star Paul Mescal, 24, scored his nomination for Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role as Connell, but his co-star Daisy Edgar-Jones and the BBC show were snubbed, a decision he previously insisted was 'disappointing'.

Impressive: The Crown star, 46, (pictured at the 2019 Oscars) won acclaim last year when she debuted in her two-season run as Queen Elizabeth II, taking over the Royal role from Claire Foy

The actor is competing against Jeremy Irons for Watchmen, while The Crown's Helena Bonham Carter and Westworld actress Thandie Newton go head to head for the Supporting Actress in a Drama Series prize.

Other British nominees include Succession stars Brian Cox and Matthew Macfadyen, who have scooped nominations in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor in a Drama Series categories respectively.

Outstanding drama series, considered by many the biggest award on the night, will this year feature The Crown, Better Call Saul, The Handmaid's Tale, Killing Eve, The Mandalorian, Ozark, Stranger Things and Succession. 

Jennifer Aniston is nominated for her role in Apple TV+'s The Morning Show, Laura Linney is up for Ozark and Comer's Killing Eve co-star Sandra Oh also grabbed a nod.

Starry: Other Brit nominees include Succession stars Brian Cox (pictured) and Matthew Macfadyen, who have scooped nods in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor categories 

HBO's Watchmen is the most nominated show, with 26 nods, including for outstanding limited series.

Host Jimmy, 52, admitted the traditional glitz and glamour could end up a 'beautiful disaster' as the Emmys becomes the latest major awards show to grapple with holding a ceremony during a still-raging pandemic.

A first look at the special gear revealed presenters protective attire - a typical black hazmat suit with an oversized black bowtie over a triangular patch of white dress shirt with white sleeve cuffs.

Costume designer Katja Cahill and producer Guy Carrington worked with a hazmat manufacturer on the custom look. 

He's back: Producers have sent over 130 home video kits to stars for their remote speeches, and Jimmy Kimmel will anchor the show from LA's Staples Centre (pictured in 2016)

Executive producer Reggie Hudlin previously guaranteed an entertaining show, telling Variety: 'From category to category, it’s going to change throughout the broadcast. 

'Some of them may not work, but we said, "Let's just experiment and have the audience a little more on the edge of their seats."'

Although Reggie added that technical difficulties will likely arise, funnyman Kimmy is gearing up to keep audiences entertained as he added: 'I think he’s hoping things go wrong. 

'If we’re in someone’s house and something extraordinary happens, why would you want to cut it off? 

'We’re thankful ABC understands our problem. It could come way under, it could go over. It might be on time. I think that’s unlikely.'

The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards take place at 1am UK time on Monday.
