She is one of the world's most iconic models.

And away from the runway, Kate Moss nailed off-duty chic as she stepped out in an effortlessly cool ensemble in London's Hampstead on Thursday.

The model, 46, donned a statement stone coloured trench coat and black cowboy boots as she ran errands during a low-key outing in the capital.

Kate paired her eye-catching £1,695 coat, which featured colourful doodles and scrawls, with a simple grey woolen jumper and black leggings.

The catwalk queen accessorised her stylish look with a black quilted handbag which was tucked under her arm and trendy black shades.

She kept her blonde tresses loose on her shoulders while she radiated natural beauty by opting for a minimal make-up palette.

Kate appeared distracted as she fiddled with her bag as she walked before chatting on her mobile phone.

Kate returned to London last month after she had been isolating in her Cotswolds mansion with her daughter Lila, 17, alongside Kate's long-term partner Count Nikolai von Bismarck, 33, and her half-sister Lottie, 22.

The troupe were also joined by Kate's hairdresser friend James Brown. 

A source told MailOnline: 'Kate and James have been friends their entire careers, they're like family. They're very comfortable living together. 

'It's an added perk that James is a hairdresser and has been able to lend his hand when it comes to overgrown roots and out of control hair.

'Lottie, who's dyed her hair pink in lockdown, has also formed a close bond with James – and regularly shops with him when getting food for the house.'

After putting her boozy benders behind her years ago, Kate recently said she now prefers to balance her life with yoga and enjoys watching Netflix before bed.

Two years ago, she told NBC's Megyn Kelly: 'I take care of myself now, I'm a good girl. I go to bed, I drink lots of water, not too much coffee, and I'm trying to cut down on cigarettes.'

In the mid-90s, the mother-of-one spent her days moving from the catwalk to the bar, with The Groucho Club, The Ivy and her friends' luxurious pads in NW1 all second homes.

After attending a week-long detox in Turkey back in June 2015, the runway sensation wound up being escorted off an easyJet flight home after her airport drinking session took a heavy turn.

Last month she told Elle: 'I hit the sack at 11pm-ish and watch Netflix before I go to sleep.

'I deal with stress by doing yoga. It helps me concentrate on the here and now.'

Kate's close friend, DJ producer Fat Tony, 54 - who has been sober for 14 years - recently revealed the model has been clean for two years.

He said: 'Kate's been clean for over two years. Me and my sober mates now have a better time than we ever did when we used to drink and take drugs.'

Kate was a member of The Primrose Hill Set - a name given to the all-star group of residents of the leafy London neighbourhood, who were known in their heyday for their raucous behaviour with stories of their antics becoming the stuff of legend.
