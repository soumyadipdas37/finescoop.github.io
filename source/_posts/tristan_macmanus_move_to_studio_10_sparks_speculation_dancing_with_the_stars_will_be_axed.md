Studio 10 will officially welcome its new host, Dancing With The Stars judge Tristan MacManus, next week, following a month of shock redundancies at the network. 

And as the morning show prepares to enter a new era, reports have emerged claiming Dancing With The Stars may be in trouble. 

'With reality TV show ratings sliding backwards this year, there is news that Ten is poised to pull the pin on its expensive dance series, Dancing With The Stars,' The Daily Telegraph's Annette Sharp reported on Sunday.

'The relocation of popular Irish dancer and judge Tristan MacManus to Ten’s morning show, Studio 10, last week was interpreted by industry stalwarts as confirmation the dancing show was for the chop,' she added.  

Neither Tristan, nor his fellow judges Sharna Burgess and Craig Revel Horwood have commented on the fate of the glitzy reality show. 

However, host Amanda Keller previously admitted she's concerned about the show's ratings, especially going up against Channel Nine's Married At First Sight in 2021.

'I haven’t heard anything but I really hope we go again. The schedules, obviously, for so many shows are out of whack,' she told TV Tonight when quizzed on whether DWTS will return in 2021. 

'It's hard [to top the ratings] because every year we’re up against Married At First Sight,' Amanda said.  

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Ten for comment.

Axed: Last month, Channel Ten made 25 employees redundant, including Kerri-Anne Kennerley (left), Natarsha Belling (right) and weatherman Tim Bailey 

It comes after regular Studio 10 panellists Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling were axed from the network last month due to budget cuts.

Tristan and Sarah will be joined by newsreader Narelda Jacobs, showbiz reporter Angela Bishop, and contributors Denise Drysdale, Jono Coleman and Craig Bennett.

On Thursday morning, Joe Hildebrand announced his resignation from the show.
