Australians can finally start planning their summer holidays as airlines ramp up flights to celebrate the reopening of borders.

Qantas will resume flights between Sydney and Adelaide on Thursday while Jetstar has announced a 36-hour 'flash sale' of tickets for the two cities kicking off at midday on Wednesday.

The airline will offer 5,000 one way flights between South Australia and NSW for just $59 with holidaymakers urged to get in quick.

Virgin Australia is also set to kick off a string of services between NSW, Queensland, the ACT and South Australia for the first time in months.

The good news for travellers comes after it was announced South Australia would reopen its border to NSW from midnight on Wednesday while five NSW shires have been added to the Queensland border bubble.

Daily Qantas flights between Sydney and Adelaide will be offered from Thursday with airfares starting at $213.

Jetstar will also ramp up flights between the two cities from five per week to twice a day from October.

By November 1, Jetstar will offer these routes three times a day.

It will be the first time since July Qantas has offered flights between Sydney and Adelaide due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

'The resumption of Qantas flights from Sydney to Adelaide and additional Jetstar flights on the route will be fantastic for tourism operators and local businesses in both South Australia and New South Wales,' a spokesperson said.

From November Jetstar will offer services between Sydney and Adelaide three times a day

Virgin services to the Gold Coast (pictured) from Canberra will also ramp up to five flights a week in October

'With the ongoing travel restrictions, we're pleased to be able to help more travellers explore world class destinations in their own country while getting more business and people back to work.' 

Meanwhile, those hoping to get away for the summer can take advantage of Virgin's latest flight offers that span across the country.

From October 12, three return flights a week will be on offer between Canberra and Adelaide.

Return flights to Sydney from Adelaide will ramp up to daily on October 2 and twice daily from November 2 with ticket sales opening on Wednesday.

Canberrans will also be able to enter into Queensland from Friday as long as they don't travel through a hot spot on the way.

This means an influx of residents in the ACT will have to fly into the sunshine state. 

Virgin Australia in response will increase flights between Canberra and Brisbane to daily return services through October - as well as five flights a week between the nation's capital and the Gold Coast.
