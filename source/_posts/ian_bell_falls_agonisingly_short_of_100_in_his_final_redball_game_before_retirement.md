Former England batsman Ian Bell narrowly missed out on scoring a century in his final red-ball innings before retiring from first-class cricket.

The 38-year-old, who was the last member of England's 2005 Ashes-winning team still playing red-ball cricket, received a guard of honour from players and the umpires as he walked out to bat at Cardiff on Tuesday.

And Bell fell agonisingly short of a fairytale ending to a memorable career in Warwickshire's Bob Willis Trophy match.

Bell made 90 before he chopped on off the bowling of Glamorgan seamer Timm van der Gugten.

The former England batsman will retire at the end of the 2020 domestic season.

The five-time Ashes winner has spent his entire career with Warwickshire and has announced his decision to call time on his playing days when the Bears wrap up their commitments this season.

'It's true when they say you know when the time's right, and unfortunately, my time is now,' the 38-year-old said in a statement.

Ex-England batsman Ian Bell announced he will retire at the end of the 2020 domestic season

'While my hunger and enthusiasm for the sport that I love remain as strong as ever, my body simply can't keep up with the demands of the game to the standard of which I expect of myself.'

Bell will perhaps be best remembered by England fans for being part of the side which reclaimed the Ashes in 2005, but he would lift the urn on four further occasions during a Test career which yielded 7,727 runs and 22 centuries.

He won 118 Test caps in total, while he played in 161 one-day internationals and eight T20 internationals.

He was part of England's 2005 Ashes winning side and went on to win the urn four more times

Across his first-class career Bell has scored 20,300 runs at 43.46, with 57 hundreds. 

He made his Test debut in 2004, an impressive 70 against the West Indies showing signs of what was to come, and the runs rarely dried up.

The 2005 Ashes success was followed by the 2009 regaining, 2010 defence and further wins in 2013 and 2015. 

The 38-year-old has admitted that he will step away from the game due to his advancing age
