Suncorp will shut down 20 branches around Australia as part of a major overhaul of the bank.

The closures include nine Queensland branches in response to the coronavirus pandemic and growing trend towards online banking. 

The banking giant announced on Wednesday that over the counter transactions by customers have declined by almost 25 per cent in the 2019-20 financial year and plummeted 60 per cent in the last four years. 



Branches to be closed include Beenleigh, Burpengary, Elanora, Hamilton, Sherwood, Stafford, Victoria Point, West End and Biloela in Queensland, the Courier Mail reported.

The closures follow reports earlier this week Suncorp plans to slash up 10 per cent of its staff as part of the bank restructure.

The number of job cuts are yet to be confirmed by the bank, which is Queensland's biggest company.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Suncorp for more details regarding branch closures and job cuts. 

Most Suncorp branches across Australia remain temporarily closed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
