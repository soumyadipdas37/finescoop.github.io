Kylie Jenner loves to do photo shoots with her best friend Anastasia Karanikolaou, who is better known as influencer Stassie Baby.

And on Tuesday the pals - who have been close since high school - were at it again as they posed in front of the Keeping Up With The Kardashian star's $36.5M estate in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles.

'My twinnnnn,' said the 23-year-old single mom in her caption.

The look of the day: Kylie Jenner loves to do photo shoots with her best friend Anastasia Karanikolaou, who is better known as influencer Stassie Baby. And on Tuesday the pals - who have been close since high school - were at it again

Labor Day, which announces the unofficial start of fall, was only one day away and the ladies were already in dark colors.

Kylie and Stassie seemed to have the exact same hair color and style - light brown hair parted in the middle and slightly curled.

The Kylie Cosmetics founder had on a gunmetal gray silky dress with a cowl neck that went to her feet with a swishy mermaid finish. Stassie had on the exact same dress only in deep black.

Both ladies added a pair of platform black sneakers that clearly had a generous heel built in.

But while Kylie had on white rim sunglasses, her bestie went without shades. 

They were on the the gray tile steps of Jenner's mansion with a large dark gray door in the background.

Kylie bought the big home in April; it also has a swimming pol and tennis court.

The star could be seen posing against her toffee-colored Mercedes G-wagon in the snaps as she put on a flirty display for the camera. 

Her hourglass curves were on full display in the trendy ensemble. Complementing her red bottoms, the bombshell carried a fiery Bottega Veneta chain pouch.

Kylie also shared an older snap with her fans, showing her modeling a black net bodysuit for a mirror selfie.

'Going through old pics & found this little gem' she wrote in the caption. 

Meanwhile a source recently revealed Kylie would consider having more children with Travis Scott. 

The former couple are currently not together but the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star would consider adding to her brood eventually with the SICKO MODE hitmaker, with whom she already has daughter Stormi, two.

Speaking to Us Weekly's Hot Hollywood podcast, a source said: 'Kylie and Travis have been so shaky for a while now. They are so on and off and it changes almost month to month. 

'Neither of them is fully committed or attached to one another romantically at this time and Kylie is definitely crushing on a few other guys as of late. [They could get back together] but right now doesn’t seem like the time, but again, their dynamic changes often. 

'They are still young and figuring out their next steps ... Kylie definitely wants more kids, she’s just not sure about if it will be with Travis, but again, it could happen one day.'

Meanwhile, it was claimed in March that Travis' relationship with the 23-year-old star was stronger than ever following their brief split. A source said: 'Kylie and Travis truly enjoy one another and are in love, but it can often be hard navigating their lives at such a young age. 

'The couple needed to take a step back to reevaluate many things, but in doing so, they are better now than ever.'

In December, Travis spoke of his close bond with Stormi and pledged to always love Kylie even if they weren't together. He said: 'Stormi is one of the best human beings I know. She's like my best friend. She makes life a little bit easier. She just inspires me and she surprises me every day with how she's thinking. It's so crazy.

'I love her mommy and I always will. The hard part about relationships is just trying to be in one without a million outside voices interfering.'
