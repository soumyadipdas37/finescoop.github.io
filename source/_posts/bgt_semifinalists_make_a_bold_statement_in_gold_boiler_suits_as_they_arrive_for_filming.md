They're set to go head-to-head for a spot in October's live final.

And the Britain's Got Talent semi-finalists were in high spirits as they arrived for filming in London on Friday.

The contestants were dressed in gold boiler suits and protective face masks as they headed into the socially-distanced set to film the semi-finals.

Stars in the making! Britain's Got Talent's semi-finalists were in high spirits as they arrived for filming in London on Friday

As they headed into filming, the contestants were certainly dressed to win as they donned reflective gold boiler suits with their protective masks.

They'll be hoping to win over the virtual audience, along with judges Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, David Walliams and Ashley Banjo, to win a spot in the final, which will air live in October.

Due to the COVID-19 crisis, bosses have introduced strict new social distancing measures for filming, which includes the judges being placed on separate desks two metres apart.

Raring to go! With their bold metallic ensembles the contestants were on a mission to catch the judges eye during their performance

Determined: They'll be hoping to win over judges Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, David Walliams and Ashley Banjo, to win a spot in the final, which will air live in October

Simon Cowell will be noticeably absent from the semi-finals after breaking his back in a freak accident on his electric bike.

The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest.

Asked ahead of the show's semi-finals whether he worried the 2020 series was a right off, he said: 'Yeah, for a moment! But then I thought, "Where there’s a will, there’s a way!"

'I just thought that if we can talk to each other all over the world on something like Zoom then there must be a way for us to do the live shows.' 

Changes: Due to the COVID-19 crisis, bosses have introduced strict new social distancing measures for filming, with the semi-finals being pre-recorded for the first time

Simon underwent emergency surgery in America after the accident in Los Angeles earlier this month, and has been recovering after having a metal rod installed in his back. 

The BGT semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. 

As usual, Ant and Dec will host the semi-finals, with the pair forming a 'cohort,' meaning they do not have socially distanced from each other.

Plans: Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs

Transitions: Some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences’ reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen

Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs.

With safety concerns paramount, some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences’ reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen.

The series will then culminate with the live final where one act will triumph as Britain’s Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance.

Britain's Got Talent returns on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.

Two metres! The judges have also been placed on separate desks to ensure they adhere to social distancing measures
