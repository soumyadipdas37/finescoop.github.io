They may not have been paired together on Married AT First Sight.  

But Ivan Sarakula, 31, and Natasha Spencer, 26, certainly made for a convincing couple when they made their acting debut in an eyebrow-raising real estate video released this Wednesday. 

In the clip, Ivan - who is a real estate agent - Ivan acts as Natasha's loving husband, as well as a father to their three fictitious children.  

Surprise! Married At First Sight stars Ivan Sarakula, 31, and Natasha Spencer, 26, played the role of a married couple in an eyebrow-raising real estate video released on Wednesday 

The clip begins with a slick-looking Ivan driving up to the sprawling property in a luxury car. 

Looking sharp in a well-tailored suit, the fictitious father is then greeted at the front door by his pretend daughters.

In a subsequent shot, a glamorous-looking Natasha is seen preparing a platter of meat and cheese, before greeting her 'husband' with a kiss on the lips. 

Honey, I'm home! In the clip, Ivan - who is actually a real estate agent - plays loving husband to Natasha and doting father to their three children. Natasha is seen greeting her 'husband' with a kiss on the lips 

Family time: Elsewhere in the clip the 'family', including a newborn cradled by Ivan, are cosied up on the couch watching television together 

The 'family' are also seen sitting on the couch watching television, with Ivan cradling a newborn baby. 

Other shots show them enjoying a meal outside at sunset, having fun by the pool and dancing. 

On Saturday, Ivan teased the video by sharing a photo of himself with his MAFS co-star inside the stunning property. 

'Some video. Nothing major,' he wrote in the caption. 

Teasing! The woman whose young daughters played Ivan and Natasha's children quickly commented on the post: 'I love how everyone just assumes they are together'

'You should never assume. Only smart people know that,' Ivan responded.

Meanwhile, Natasha was married to Mikey Pembroke, but the two had a very bitter split on the show.
