Tim Sherwood, Tony Pulis, Glen Johnson and Clinton Morrison will reportedly be part of a new-look Soccer Saturday panel for the first weekend of the season following Sky Sports' summer shake-up.

Long-serving regulars Matt Le Tissier, Charlie Nicholas and Phil Thompson were all axed last month as part of a cost-cutting initiative by the broadcasters.

Paul Merson and host Jeff Stelling survived and will feature in Saturday's show alongside Chris Kamara, with the panel set to be rotated during the opening weeks of the new campaign, according to The Athletic.

Tony Pulis and Clinton Morrison are also set to appear on this weekend's show

Glen Johnson will also form part of a new-look show following a summer shake-up

Sportsmail reported last week that Sky Sports planned to audition pundits to find replacements for the sacked trio before deciding on a regular panel.

Last Saturday Stelling presented a shortened show providing live updates from the first round of the Carabao Cup alongside Merson, Danny Gabbidon, Morrison, Jamie Mackie and Paul Cook.

Southampton's trip to Crystal Palace is the only Saturday 3pm kick-off of the Premier League's opening weekend, but there are nine games in the Championship and a full schedule in both League Ones and Two.

Stelling appears set to continue in his role as anchor of the popular show, despite Sportsmail revealing last month that he could walk out after being left disillusioned by the shock decision to axe Le Tissier, Nicholas and Thompson.

Like Le Tissier, Charlie Nicholas also received the chop from Sky ahead of next season

The huge revamp left Stelling bemoaning 'one of my saddest days ever' during his time with the broadcaster. He tweeted at the time: 'One of my saddest days ever at Sky Sports with the departure of three of my best mates. They have been part of a team that for me was the best.'

His thoughts have been echoed by Kamara, who admitted to Sportsmail this week that he was 'absolutely gutted' about the sacking of his former colleagues.

'Obviously I'm gutted, absolutely gutted,' Kamara said . 'And I know they are. I've spoken to Thommo and Charlie and I've text Le Tiss… we were such a good team and it was all going well. 

'Decisions were made, we don't have any say in those. Whoever made (them) has done it and the boys accept it.

'I can honestly say they are the best fellas you could ever wish to meet. They are top-drawer and it's been a great time to have worked with them over the past 15 years or so.' 

Long-serving pundit and former Liverpool captain Phil Thompson has also left the show
