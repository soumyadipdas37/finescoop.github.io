She is one of the modelling industry's brightest young stars with legions of followers on social media.

And Lottie Moss cut a stylish figure as she enjoyed an evening with a friend at the Bluebird cafe in London on Saturday.

The model, 22, wrapped up in a black knee-length coat with a white faux fur lined collar which she wore over a dark minidress.

Lottie, who is the younger sister of fellow model Kate Moss, also sported a pair of black boots for the day. 

The former Made In Chelsea star styled her blonde locks into pigtails for the outing as she strolled through the capital with her pal.

Carrying a black handbag, Lottie completed her look with small silver hoop earrings. 

Meanwhile, in the romance department, Lottie was seen putting on a cosy display with a mystery hunk earlier this month, following a lavish meal with friends in London.

The model and her companion arrived at Kensington's Nam Long Le Shaker restaurant and bar shortly before midnight and were seen hugging amid their multiple cigarette breaks outside the popular venue.

Elsewhere, Lottie fuelled dating speculation as she spent time with Love Island star Chris Hughes during a recent holiday.

In videos and pictures shared to Instagram, Chris, 27, can be seen putting on a cosy display with the blonde, and even proceeds to drape his leg over her.

Media personality Chris split from his ex-girlfriend, Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson, in April.

It came after Lottie was linked to Roman Kemp amid claims she had been on a 'tipsy' date with I'm A Celebrity star and Capital FM host.

News of their alleged fling came just three weeks after the broadcaster split from his girlfriend of three years Anne-Sophie Flury.

A mutual friend told The Sun on Sunday: 'They have known each other through the party circuit for a few years, but nothing has ever happened before.

'Roman's always thought she was beautiful, and decided to pluck up the courage to ask her out.'

MailOnline contacted representatives for Lottie and Roman for comment at the time of publication.
