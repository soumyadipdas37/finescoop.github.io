This is the unusual moment that a group of friends play a human version of table football, where players use their mouths to blow a ball into a goal.

Ivan Bodylevskii, 30, captured hilarious video footage of a group of men playing the bizarre game whilst working in Turkey.

Players have to put their heads through holes in a special board and begin blowing air from their mouths to move a small red ball around the pitch.

In the video, which was filmed before coronavirus measures came into force, the two teams are made clear to spectators as the holes are coloured either blue or purple.

The game has no rules apart from one main objective, to score a goal in the opposite team's goal.

At one point in the tournament, the purple team manage to get the ball past the goalkeeper and score a goal, triggering cries of excitement from the other players.

There are also a number of own goals as the goalkeepers attempt to stop the opposing team from scoring, the unusual footage shows.

In the video, a sporting match is also being played on a normal football pitch behind the football table. 

But this game still has a fun twist, as all the players are wearing large zorb balls, or human hamster balls as they are also known.

Mr Bodylevskii said that the human-sized football table took around two hours to construct, adding that the lighthearted game was extremely 'productive'. 

He said: 'For work, we were looking for different football type of game whilst in Turkey.

'The board took about two hours in total to assemble and is very productive, with the team with the best lungs winning.

'I filmed this before the coronavirus pandemic, I'm not sure if they play the game at the moment.'

The hysterical video footage was taken by Mr Bodylevskii in February this year.
