Gary Lineker's brother Wayne has revealed a bizarre criteria for his future girlfriend - which includes 'giving up her career, having no children, being able to cook and loving R&B'.

The list was posted to the club owner's Instagram account with the hashtag 'banter' but sparked outrage on social media from followers disgusted with Wayne's demands - such as 'loving the gym and having body definition, and not being my age as that would just look weird'.

'Truly unprecedented levels of creep exuding from Wayne Lineker these days,' one unimpressed Twitter user wrote.

Last month, Wayne hit back at haters who criticised a video shared of him picking which 'dream doll' to take on a date at his club in Ibiza - and knocking the rejected women in the pool by their chests.

Taking to Instagram yesterday, Wayne wrote: 'So, my family have decided I need a girlfriend for my own sanity and health...so here’s my criteria.

'OK, let’s start this off like I’m normal: strong, nice, and loving personality. Now to more important things:

'You must like older men but only me...You have to be a worldly and above 30 (OK, 28 29 could work) but not my age as that would just look weird.

'You must like to travel and to fly business class and stay in incredible hotels. Be prepared to give up your career or job or at least be able to work from a laptop on a tropical beach somewhere. 

'You will need to spend the summer in Ibiza and the winter in Dubai with two weeks in the UK for Christmas and New Year with the families and holidays to the Maldives.'

The club owner then explained that any potential love interest should come without children because his 'are all grown up'. However, he added that 'a dog is acceptable' if they have a passport.

He continued: 'You must be able to cook as I love cooking, especially Waitrose ready made meals. You also don’t need to be verified I can sort that for you. 

'House music and R&B lovers only. No heavy rock or pop music. You must like Netflix especially Money Heist and also real crime. No chick flicks, watch them with your mates. 

'You need to be confident enough to be able to go to the front of the queue in nightclubs and accept a table and free drinks from the owners.'

Wayne insisted that any girlfriends should have a driving license to share his Bentley and a future 'Lamborghini Jeep' purchase.

He also refused to consider any women who have posted teeth whitening posts, appear on OnlyFans, or dating websites, and who are 'boring' or bad at geography.

'You must love the gym, healthy food and have body definition as I will have soon,' he added. 'Accept and love my children and grandchildren and realise no more kids for me.. (never say never though).

'You must be able to let my PA book all yours and our flights and purchase items online for you. You must be able to accept my friends as I will accept yours and accept I have to reply to girls direct messages and not just guys.'





However, some people (pictured above) could see the funny side of Wayne's announcement

Despite finishing the post with '#banter', some social media users were left unimpressed with Wayne's demands.

One person wrote: 'Wayne Lineker is an actual embarrassment, nah I'm not having it. How is a man of 58 years of age seriously writing a girlfriend requirement list on his Instagram. Don't know what's worse, that or the sad and desperate girls about to message him.

'Has Wayne Lineker been hacked or is he just being himself? Hard to say', another added.

However, some people could see the funny side of Wayne's announcement and said: 'You tell 'em Wayne', while a second added: 

MailOnline has contacted Wayne's representative for comment. 

Entrepreneur Wayne Lineker, from Leicester, is the younger brother of former British footballer Gary Lineker. 

The 58-year-old, who now lives in Essex in the winter, owns several bars, clubs and restaurants across Europe, including Linekers Bar in Marbella, Spain, and O Beach in Ibiza, which are often visited by celebrities and reality stars. 

Father-of-four Wayne has had several girlfriends and has been married once before. 

Nightclub owner Wayne Lineker, 58, was once regarded as a better footballing prospect than his brother Gary 

He had all his children with his first wife, including three daughters Duane, Tia and Sean and a son called Freddie. 

The business owner and grandfather has reportedly been single since he split from his ex-fiance Danielle Sandhu, 27, in 2018 after meeting at his club.  



At the age of 14 he left school and worked with his father, a greengrocer, selling fruit and vegetables. 

Growing up he and Gary would play football together but Wayne never pursued it as a professional career despite being once regarded as a better footballing prospect. 

Wayne and his brother are said to be estranged and reports in 2015 suggested their rift began in 2008 when Gary took his bride-to-be Danielle Bux to meet Wayne. 

Following an uncomfortable first meeting Wayne's then girlfriend Ana Tanaka was not invited to the couple's wedding on the Amalfi coast despite being together for 18 months. As a result, he declined the invitation. 

In 2006, Wayne was handed a two-and-a-half year prison sentence after he was convicted for a £220,000 tax fraud.
