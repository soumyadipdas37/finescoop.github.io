A thug was caught on camera smacking a man around the head with a pool cue before punching him to the floor in a vicious brawl.

The violent attack was caught on CCTV at the pub on Tuesday evening as other drinkers obliviously carried on their conversations.

The incident was triggered after the victim moved one of the balls on the pool table before the brute launched his assault.

In the clip, two men can be seen leaning over a pool table to pick up their cues as half a dozen other patrons sit at tables around the room.  

One of the men, who is wearing a black Nike sweatshirt, takes his place at the head of the table as he prepares to take his shot.

He appears to ask a third man, who is wearing a black T-shirt, to move out of the way after he started a conversation with his opponent. 

But the man in the T-shirt seems to be unhappy at the request and retaliates by throwing the cue ball off the table.

The first man then launches his assault as he swings the wooden stick violently toward the victim who begins to stumble.

He follows it with tirade of punches which send the victim flying into a table before he tumbles over a stool.

The assailant is held back and leaves the pub as the victim remains lying on the floor.

But other drinkers seem unconcerned at the events as they continue sipping their beers with one even stepping over the victim to reach the bar. 

The 44-second clip has been viewed over half a million times but it is not yet known where it was recorded.

It was originally posted in a tweet alongside a caption that read: 'Never touch another man's balls.'
