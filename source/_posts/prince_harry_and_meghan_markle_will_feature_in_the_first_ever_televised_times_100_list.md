The promo video showcases a montage of famous faces including tennis stars Serena Williams and Roger Federer while the words 'pioneers', 'artists', 'icons' and 'titans' flash up on the screen.  

It then teases that there will be appearances on the show by the Sussexes and other stars, while there will be performances by Halsey, Jennifer Hudson and The Weeknd.  

The switch to a televised unveiling comes as TIME has been forced to ax its usual in-person events due to the coronavirus pandemic.

At last year's event, honorees including Taylor Swift and Nancy Pelosi gathered for a star-studded bash at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City.  

TIME studios president Ian Orefice said the 2020 broadcast celebration will bring an alternative and 'brand-new experience' to the ranking.

'In a year in which we are unfortunately unable to convene the TIME100 community together in person, we are excited to celebrate the extraordinary achievements of the members of this year's list with a brand-new experience on ABC that will allow more people to participate than ever before,' Orefice said in a statement.

Sandra Oh will also make an appearance on the show - which marks the first time TIME's annual ranking of the 100 Most Influential People will be broadcast in a TV special

TIME executive editor Dan Macsai said the show will 'recognize the extraordinariness of this year.' 

The TIME100 special will air on ABC on Tuesday September 22, announcing the names of the 100 most influential people in the world according to the magazine. 

ABC promised the show will offer 'an entertainment-filled inside look at the leaders, creators and everyday heroes comprising the 2020 list ahead of its TIME print debut.'

The list will also be published on TIME's website on September 22 and the full TIME100 issue of the magazine will be available on September 25. 

Meghan and Harry have had a tumultuous year. This month, it emerged they had signed a multiyear deal with Netflix, said to be worth upwards of $100 million

The appearance of Harry and Meghan on TIME's list comes after a rocky year for the former Royals after they announced they were dramatically exiting the Royal Family back in January. 

Nine months on, the couple have left life in the UK and are now living in a $14.7 million estate near Los Angeles with baby Archie. 

This month, it emerged the couple have founded their own production company and signed a multiyear deal with Netflix, said to be worth upwards of $100 million.
