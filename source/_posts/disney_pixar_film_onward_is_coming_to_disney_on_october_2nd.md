The Disney Pixar film 'Onward' is launching on Disney Plus in the UK and Ireland on October 2, 2020.

The computer-animated urban fantasy-adventure film was released in cinemas on March 6, 2020, and features the voices of Tom Holland, Chris Pratt, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Octavia Spencer. 

The film is set in a once-enchanted world where instead of using magic, the mythical creatures have turned to simpler, scientific ways to carry out everyday tasks.

On Ian Lightfoot (Holland)'s 16th birthday, he and his brother Barley (Pratt) get an unexpected gift: a spell that will enable them to spend one more day with their late dad.

But when the spell goes horribly wrong and only their dad’s bottom half appears, the elf brothers must embark on an extraordinary journey aboard Barley’s epic van Guinevere to find a Phoenix Gem and complete the spell before the sun sets. 

Little do they know that their fearless mum, Laurel (Louis-Dreyfus), is hot on their trail. She teams up with a part-lion, part-bat, part-scorpion, former warrior – aka The Manticore (Spencer) – and heads off to find them before they release a perilous curse.

Like any classic fantasy quest, their epic journey is filled magic spells, cryptic maps, impossible obstacles and unimaginable discoveries. 

This lighthearted tale of brotherly love shows how the two must learn to value each others' quirks and use their differing skills to be able to see their late dad again.
