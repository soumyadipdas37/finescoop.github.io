The Bachelor's Irena Srbinovska really is the whole package.

Not only is she beautiful, smart and caring, the blonde beauty is also an excellent cook.

In news that will no doubt be welcomed by Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert, Irena told The Huffington Post that she loves baking, and has won several cooking competitions in the past.



Irena wowed the judges at Tastes of Central Geelong comp back in 2013, with her 10-layered chocolate-coffee Opera cake, and took home the top prize.

She did it again a year later, this time at the Central Geelong Bake Off when she churned out an impressive 500 macaroons.

Following the victories, Irena almost opened her own local cafe.

The Victorian nurse told The Huffington Post that she wouldn't rule out appearing on MasterChef Australia after competing on The Bachelor. 

'I don’t like to say never,' she told the publication 'I do love to cook so maybe Masterchef.' 

'I’ve always wanted to work in the food industry, like having my own vegan cafe is my dream,' she added. 

What an effort! She once competed in the Central Geelong Bake Off, where she churned out an impressive 500 macaroons
