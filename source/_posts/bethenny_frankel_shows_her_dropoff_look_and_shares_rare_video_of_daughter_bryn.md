She's built her massive Skinnygirl brand from the ground up, but still makes time to be a devoted mother to her baby girl.

And Bethenny Frankel showed off her 'drop-off' look while chatting with fans on Instagram Friday morning.

The 49-year-old reality television star looked fresh-faced for the morning commute before sharing a video of daughter Bryn, 10, on the way to her first day of school.

The former Real Housewives of New York star wore a chic black blouse and appeared relatively makeup-free.

'On my way to get a mammogram today just ahead of Breast Cancer Awareness Month,' she told her fans. 'Hope you're doing well.'

The former couple were married in March 2010 and received their own Bravo spin-off about their wedding.

Bethenny and Jason legally separated in December 2012, but the entrepreneur recently admitted to Andy Cohen that they have yet to finalize their divorce.

'I'm still married...Crickets again! And scene. And we're back. And we're walking,' she told the Watch What Happens Live host when asked if she would be marrying her boyfriend Paul Bernon.
