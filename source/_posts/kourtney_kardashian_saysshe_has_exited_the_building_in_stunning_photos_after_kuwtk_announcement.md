She and her family announced this week that their landmark reality series Keeping Up With The Kardashians would come to an end in 2021 after 20 seasons on E!

And Kourtney Kardashian appeared to nod at the series' impending end in her Instagram caption on Saturday.

'she has exited the building,' the 41-year-old KUWTK star wrote along with a slew of stunning self-portraits.

Kourtney put her toned midriff on display in a silk crop top and a pair of white drawstring trousers.

Her lengthy raven hair was tightly slicked back and styled into a chic braid. 

The POOSH founder accentuated her high cheekbones with a generous amount of highlighter and a few swipes of warm toned bronzer.

Her brows looked perfectly sculpted and she dusted a light amount of brown eyeshadow on her lids.

Kourtney included a stop-motion style video of her strutting down her home's hallway in her fashion forward fit and a pair of dark tinted sunglasses.

Kourtney is no stranger to providing fashion inspiration for her 101million Instagram followers.

On Friday, she uploaded a pair of stylish throwback photos taken during her trip to Wyoming in June with ex Scott Disick and their three children.

She posed in front of multiple stacks of hay as the ranch's picturesque hills rested behind her.

Like in Saturday's Instagram photos, Kourtney went for a slicked back look that showed off her enviable facial features.

Kardashian has been spending a ton of her time with Disick, after the 37-year-old Talentless founder split from his girlfriend of three-years Sofia Richie, 22, in May.

Scott and Kourtney, who split in 2015 after nine years together, share sons Mason, ten, and Reign, five, and daughter Penelope, eight.

Despite all their bonding time, sources close to the former pair refuted all claims that they planned to rekindle their romance to TMZ. 

Kourtney Kardashian recently opened up about what dating is like in her family on the latest episode of Kate Hudson's podcast, Sibling Revelry.

When asked "who gives the best relationship advice," the eldest of the Kardashian-Jenner children immediately selected sister Khloé, 36. 

'Khloé's is harsh, harsh advice,' explained Kourtney to Kate, 41, and her co-host Oliver Hudson, during an interview at Kate's home, pre-pandemic.

She added that she just 'wouldn't go to Kim [Kardashian-West] for relationship advice.'
