Lily Allen and David Harbour are reportedly married.

The couple have tied the knot in Las Vegas, a day after they were revealed to have obtained a marriage license, according to The Sun. 

Lily is said to have used her married name - from her previous marriage to ex-husband Sam Cooper - to wed at the Graceland Wedding Chapel on Monday.

According to TMZ, the pop star, 35, and the Stranger Things actor, 45, have registered to marry in Sin City with a license that is valid for 12 months.

Public records obtained by the publication state the expiration date for the license is September 6 2021 - meaning they will need to wed within a year.

MailOnline has approached reps for the couple for comment. 

This comes days after Lily was seen strolling through New York flashing a sparkling diamond ring - fueling the unconfirmed rumours she and David are engaged.

They were with her daughters Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven, while taking a stroll through the city.

The quartet have been in New York of late - with the sudden license application hinting that the next stop on their jaunt could be Vegas.

To actually get married, the certificate has to come through - and this has yet to be issued.

Although TMZ have suggested they could tie the knot without it, and file it afterwards to make it official.

When seen last week, Lily lowered her protective face mask to sip an iced drink, flashing the sparkling jewellery as she did.

This was not the first time she had been seen wearing the ring; the Hard Out Here songstress debuted it last year, on her ring finger.

The couple were first spotted at the theatre in London last August and their relationship has gone on from strength-to-strength.

The mother-of-two previously took to Instagram to laud her new healthier lifestyle after she quit drinking - which is thought to be down to David.

She told her fans: '9 months sober today! And the beginning of an ab is appearing. Very pleased!'

Lily revealed she had turned to the bottle when experiencing trouble in her personal life in an interview with Stereogum in 2018.

Singer Lily, who has bi-polar disorder, said: 'I think I'm a raging co-dependent and then when I feel like I can't cope, I abuse alcohol and drugs to plaster over some stuff, but I've never been somebody that craves a fix.'

London-born Lily had shared snaps from the family's break in Croatia, as they prepared for their vacation to come to an end on Saturday.

As well as uploading a snap the happy group aboard their boat, the singer also shared a heartwarming clip of her beau dancing with little Marnie. 

In the video, the actor is seen holding the youngster in dance pose as he rocks with her to and fro while Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk plays in the background.

Wearing a yellow playsuit and red-and-white baseball cap, Marnie stands elevated on a chair on the boat to meet the actor's height as she gets into the spirit of things.

As her elder sister loudly giggles away in the background, Marnie adjusts her headgear before asking her famous mother if she's filming her.

Also amid the selection of images shared were breathtaking scenery shots from their time sailing the welcoming azure waters off the Adriatic Coast.

Captioning the snaps, Lily wrote: 'Bye bye Croatia. We had the best time, will definitely be back. Special shout outs to our amazing crew on Nostra Vita and @goolets for sorting everything out for us so last minute. Trip of a lifetime for sure.'   

Over the past two weeks, the couple had been seen soaking up the sunshine during their break with Lily's daughters, who she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper.

Lily has previously been open about her struggle with alcohol and substance abuse, saying she turned to it when she experienced trouble in her personal life. 

To mark the past 12 months of being tee-total, Lily posted bikini photos alongside one of the star looking noticeably worse-for-wear. Lily captioned the post: '1 year completely sober! So grateful for my health and happiness.'

It is thought Lily gave up drinking around the time she started dating David.
