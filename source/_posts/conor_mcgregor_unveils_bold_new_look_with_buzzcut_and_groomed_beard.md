Conor McGregor has unveiled a bold new look just weeks after he was accused of exposing himself to a woman in France. 

The Irish UFC star, 32, took to Instagram to unveil his new buzzcut and groomed beard while showcasing his muscles following a gym session. 

Giving his trademark glare to the camera, the controversy-garnering sportsman stood with his hands on his hips and donned garish pastel striped shorts.

Conor was shocking his fans with his new style as he posed for the snap. 

Earlier in the week, Conor shared a collection of holiday snaps to Instagram. He posted a slew of photos with his son Conor Jr, 3, onboard a luxury dinghy.

The family has been sailing in the Mediterranean on McGregor's £3million yacht The Devocean as he waits to hear whether French prosecutors will press charges. 

In the snaps, McGregor's eldest child snuggled up to him as he looked into the distance at the nighttime marina. He captioned it with a heart emoji.

The star also shared a video of himself and Conor Jr being sailed on the dinghy to their luxury yacht.  During the clip, McGregor kissed his eldest child on the cheek and said: 'I love you, champ.' 

McGregor was released without charge earlier this month but could face further action over allegations that he 'exhibited his private parts' to a young married woman in a bar on the French island of Corsica. 

Since his arrest, the sporting star has posted pictures of his family splashing in the Mediterranean including his mother Margaret and sister Aoife.

Just last week, McGregor raged at 'vicious lies' in a now-deleted Facebook post in which he hinted that DNA and CCTV footage could clear his name.

'The truth is the truth and it gives me wings! I know my character! God bless DNA! God bless Cctv! God bless Eye witness! God bless the truth!,' he wrote. 

'The truth is power! I am free! 'Never will a dime be paid to anyone coming at me with vicious lies! Not now not f****** ever! I will fight! And I am only beginning my fight!

'I will not allow these people to just accuse me and then disappear into the dark to attempt to ruin someone else's life! No f****** way!'

McGregor was released without charge after his arrest, but the criminal case is still active and he could be summoned before a magistrate.

The fighter was waiting for the results of 'key physical tests' and 'the examination of film evidence' before learning whether he will be re-arrested. 

A prosecuting source on Corsica confirmed to MailOnline earlier this month that McGregor was 'free to travel while enquiries continue.'

He said test results were 'still being analysed' and evidence including potential camera shots were still being gathered by judicial police supported by gendarmes.

Other potential witnesses to the bar incident were also being interviewed, while the alleged victim was also being kept informed of developments.
