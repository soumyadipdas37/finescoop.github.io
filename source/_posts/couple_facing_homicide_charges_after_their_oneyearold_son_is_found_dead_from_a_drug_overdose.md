 A couple have been arrested after their baby boy died from a drug overdose inside their Pennsylvania home. 

Tracy Humphreys and Thomas Snelsire, both aged 45, turned themselves into police last Thursday, and are now facing criminal homicide charges over the death of their one-year-old son, Thomas, dead. 

Authorities were called to the couple's Baldwin home on September 13 after Thomas was discovered unconscious. 

However, a criminal complaint claims that the baby had been dead for 'some time due to the condition of his body'. He was reportedly found wrapped in a blanket on the property's front porch.

Police searched the property and discovered plastic straw in the baby's pack-n-play crib with 'an unknown white powder in the straw.' 

Pills, cocaine and heroin were also uncovered in the home. 

A subsequent autopsy determined the tot had fentanyl in his system and had died from an overdose.  

Meanwhile, police also performed a drug test on an 11-year-old boy who was living with Humphreys and Snelsire at their home. 

The boy is reported to be Humphrey's biological son and the test revealed that that he had cocaine in his system. 

Humphreys and Snelsire are now additionally facing child endangerment and drug possession charges.

WPXI reports that a detective 'filed two separate child endangerment reports on the couple earlier this year'. 

However, a Children & Youth Services caseworker completed an inspection of Humphrey and Snelsire's home just last month and found no drug paraphernalia or evidence of narcotics use. 

The pair remain behind bars. 

Meanwhile, a relative has started a GoFundMe page to raise funds for baby Thomas' funeral. 

'Tommy brought his family so much pride and joy. He was such a happy baby and his family would like to see Little Tommy off in the most respectful way possible,' the organizer - Samantha Snelsire- wrote. 

'Little Tommy will truly be missed and a part of his family's life will forever be broken due to this unpredictable and tragic accident.'

According to the criminal complaint, obtained by WPXI, a straw containing a suspicious substance was found in Thomas' crib
