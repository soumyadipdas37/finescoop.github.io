Speaking during an interview on the Made By Mammas podcast, Holly said: 'At the beginning with Luka, I thought it was absolutely terrifying.

'It's like the best and worst thing to ever happen to you.'

She continued: 'It's terrifying. You're exploding with love but you don't know what you're doing. You're absolutely exhausted and fumbling around just trying to survive.'
