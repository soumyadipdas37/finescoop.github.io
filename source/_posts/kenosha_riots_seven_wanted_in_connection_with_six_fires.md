Anger at Blake's shooting, captured on video that went viral, led to street skirmishes with protesters hurling firecrackers and bricks at police in riot gear who fired volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets. 

Protests devolving into violence left countless buildings burned, businesses looted and destroyed, cars charred and streets littered with debris. 

The situation escalated on August 25 when 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, who is white, opened fire on demonstrators with a semi-automatic rifle, killing two people and injuring a third.

Officials instated a 7pm curfew the same day as the Rittenhouse shooting in an effort to curb the violence as more than 1,000 National Guard troops descended on the city. Those troops have not yet been withdrawn.

The 7pm curfew was lifted by officials on Wednesday.  

United States Attorney Matthew Krueger said in a statement today:  'With remarkable speed, the ATF's National Response Team has already processed the fire scenes and isolated images of individuals who may have important information.

'Now we need the public's help in reviewing these images. The U.S. Attorney's Office, with the ATF and our state and local partners, will continue working to hold accountable anyone responsible for the arsons that devastated Kenosha.'

Special Agent in Charge Kristen de Tineo of AFT's Chicago Field Division said: 'We are asking the community to look at these images and videos and provide information to help solve these arsons.

'Engaging the community is imperative to not only solving these arsons, it will help the community heal and build trust among all Kenosha stakeholders.'

Speaking after the curfew was lifted yesterday,  Mayor John Antaramian said: 'After consulting with local law enforcement agencies, I have decided the curfew is no longer needed. 

'The last several nights have been relatively peaceful in the community, and in the judgment of law enforcement, it is appropriate to remove the curfew.'

But Antaramian warned that he would not hesitate to reinstate the curfew if more violence erupted in its absence, saying: 'Criminal activity will not be tolerated and arrests will be made if needed.'

The move to lift the curfew, which was originally set to expire next week, came the day after President Donald Trump visited Kenosha and toured property damage and held a roundtable discussion with law enforcement and local officials.

Wisconsin's governor and Kenosha's mayor, both Democrats, had urged Trump not to visit because they feared it could exacerbate the unrest in the city. 

'While presidents are always welcome to come to this great city, this is not the best time for a visit,' Mayor Antaramian said in a statement Sunday. 

'We are hurting today and we are focused on healing, coming together as a community and rebuilding. There is a lot of listening we need to do in Kenosha and I worry that a visit from the president will delay this important work.' 

But the president ignored his plea and in the end concerns about stoking violence were not manifested. 

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden followed Trump's lead and is planning to visit Kenosha with his wife Jill on Thursday.

The Biden campaign said that the former vice president will 'hold a community meeting in Kenosha to bring together Americans to heal and address the challenges we face.' Afterward, both Joe and Jill Biden will make a 'local stop.'  

Biden had hinted on Monday after delivering a speech in Pittsburgh that he was considering going to the Wisconsin city. 

His campaign has already reached out to Blake's family and plans to meet with them on Thursday during his visit. 

'Biden's contacted the family,' Jason Blake, Blake's uncle, told DailyMail.com. 'They've had a phone conversation with my brother. I'm sure they're going to make their way to meet with my family.'

'We want someone in the White House that will unite the whole country,' he added.

'We believe Biden is trying to united all Americans. I'm grateful to be able to meet him. I'm going to demand from him what we demand from anyone else - that there be legislation and laws protecting African Americans' safety and well being and that we have economic opportunity to build up our own communities.'
