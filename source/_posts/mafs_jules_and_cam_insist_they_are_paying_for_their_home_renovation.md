Married At First Sight's Jules Robinson has insisted that she and her husband Cameron Merchant are paying for the renovations to their $1.8million Sydney home.

Earlier this month, the reality TV couple moved into their house in the sought-after Sydney suburb of Kirribilli, which is also where the Prime Minister's residence is.

But on Tuesday, rumours swirled that the reno was part of a sponsored deal when The Block's Mitch Edwards and Mark McKie showed off the work they had done on Jules and Cameron's pad in a segment on the Today show.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday afternoon, Jules said they paid for the renovations out of their own pocket.

'Of course not! We have no association with The Block other than being very good friends with Mitch and Mark,' she said. 

Mitch and Mark had completely upgraded their dark kitchen to a bright white space with pops of sage and modern appliances.

BEFORE: Jules and Cam's original kitchen was dark and basic to begin with 

AFTER: Mitch and Mark completely upgraded their dark kitchen to a bright white one with pops of sage and modern appliances

Jules is also pregnant with her and Cam's first child, so the Block contestants upgraded the baby room ahead of the birth.

The Today show segment also featured product names and price tags for goods from Bunnings, Kmart, Resene, Babyology and Verde Baby. 

Jules and Cam have maintained a close relationship with Channel Nine since their season of MAFS came to an end last year.

BEFORE: The couple's nursery room was bare before it was renovated 

AFTER: Jules is pregnant with her and Cam's first child, so the Block contestants upgraded the baby room ahead of the birth. They went for a gender neutral look

The network even paid for the couple's wedding in exchange for the exclusive broadcast rights. The ceremony was eventually aired on A Current Affair. 

After shooting to fame on Nine's social experiment, Jules is now an ambassador for numerous brands including Olay, Weight Watchers and Always Discreet. 

Meanwhile, Cam has recently been spruiking food delivery service Every Plate, Soda Stream and Coles cookies on Instagram.
