Chessington World of Adventures is offering visitors personalised face masks showing terrified expressions for photos as they enjoy the theme park's rides.

Thrill seekers would normally race to see their hilarious pictures after going on the attractions but they now have to wear coverings on many due to the coronavirus.

The 'coaster faces', which start from £6.80, were introduced to the Surrey resort so riders will still get fun souvenir snaps to take home.

Visitors have to upload pictures of how they think their faces will look when going on popular rides such as Dragon's Fury and Rattlesnake.

Their mouths are then printed on to face coverings, which look like people's normal reactions to the rollercoasters.

A spokesman for Chessington said: 'As soon as guests step foot off their favourite ride, they rush to see their photo snapped mid twist and turn.

'However, with face masks currently mandatory on a number of our rides, those memorable and often hilarious reactions have been masked.'

They added: 'We think this is a great way to ensure guests get that souvenir shot once again.'

Face coverings have been required on a number of rides at Chessington since it reopening following the Covid-19 outbreak.

Masks have to be worn on Vampire, KOBRA, Scorpion Express, Tuk Tuk Turmoil, The Gruffalo River Ride Adventure, Room on the Broom and Tomb Blaster.

Visitors also have to have their temperature taken upon arrival to ensure they are not showing virus symptoms.

Chessington has played host to a Covid-19 drive-through testing centre on one of its car parks.

The hurriedly established facility, which had six stations made up of an open ended tent and portable hit, was first used by NHS staff but is now open to the public.

Pictures showed few cars enter and leave the site earlier in the pandemic, when it was made to cater for hundreds.

Even the few NHS staff who did arrive were only admitted if they had an email confirming an appointment, and NHS ID.

The nearest testing centres to those living in the far west of London are Chessington, Heathrow and Twickenham.
