Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's X-rated collaboration WAP is making history.

The song spends its fourth week at No. 1 on Australia's ARIA charts this week, breaking a record previously held by the legendary Salt-N-Pepa.

With four straight weeks at the top, WAP now holds the record for the most weeks at No. 1 by a female-lead hip hop song.

The record was previously held by Salt-N-Pepa's 1992 classic, Let's Talk About Sex. 

The WAP music video has garnered over 182 million views in the month since it was released, smashing YouTube records along the way.

The raunchy video was shot in West Hollywood, CA in the middle of pandemic lockdowns.

Cardi notably spent $100k on coronavirus testing and 'everybody on the shoot had to get tested for coronavirus,' the Bronx-born beauty told i-D in a new interview last month. 

WAP has been streamed more than 300 million times on Spotify and Youtube since its release, according to Bloomberg.

The song spent two weeks at number one on America's Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first female rap collaboration to debut in the spot.

It also received the most first week streams ever and became the most streamed track of 2020 on Spotify and the most streamed song of the week on Youtube the week of its release.

The music video has become a viral sensation, largely in part due to a cameo from Kylie Jenner that was widely parodied online. 

It also went viral when conservative pundit Ben Shapiro awkwardly read out the filthy lyrics during an episode of his podcast.
