Wolves have announced their second signing in two days as they secured the signature of Fernando Marcal from Lyon.

The 31-year-old left-back, who featured and helped Lyon reach the 2019/20 Champions League semi-final, has signed a two-year deal at Molineux. 

The Brazilian will report for testing on Monday at Wolves HQ, one week before Nuno Espirito Santo's side begin their Premier League season away to Sheffield United.

Club chairman Jeff Shi expressed his delight with Wolves' latest capture, as he told the club website: 'We are very pleased Marçal has joined the pack.'

'Having played over 280 games in top leagues, as well as Champions League football, Marçal will add a huge amount of experience to our young team.

'He is a player with the technical ability to be able to contribute in the build up play from the back, all the way through to threatening the opposition in the final phase.'

Marcal's arrival has capped off a busy couple day at Molineux, as he joins club-record signing Fabio Silva as another new addition to Nuno Espirito Santo's side.

The 18-year-old wonderkid arrived from Porto and signed on the dotted line, costing the Midlands club in the region of £35million. 

Silva had a £112million buy out clause in his Porto contract, but the Portuguese giants have been forced to consider substantially lower offers following the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
