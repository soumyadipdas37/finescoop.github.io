Rory McIlroy's wife Erica has given birth to the couple's first child, the four-time major winner has revealed.

Golfer McIlroy revealed the happy news on Instagram, announcing the couple have named their daughter Poppy Kennedy McIlroy.

The little girl, who was born on Monday in Florida, 'is the absolute love of our lives,' the proud dad told fans. 



Sharing a black and white photo of himself holding the newborn's hand, the 31-year-old also thanked staff at Jupiter Medical Centre in Florida for their 'amazing care.'

'Poppy Kennedy McIlroy, born August 31st, 12:15pm. She is the absolute love of our lives. Mother and baby are doing great,' Rory wrote.

'Massive thank you to all the staff at Jupiter Medical Center and Dr Sasha Melendy for their amazing care 

The golfer had said he was willing to withdraw from last week's BMW Championship or the upcoming Tour Championship if Erica went into labour.

He is due to compete at East Lake on Friday, although he is no longer scheduled to give an interview on Thursday afternoon.

The news that Rory and Erica were expecting was only revealed over the weekend as the golfer said his daughter was due 'any day now'. 

The news was broken on The Golf Channel's live broadcast of the BMW Championship on Friday evening, with the sportsman explaining that he was ready to pull out of the copmpeition as soon as he got a call.

'I didn't think it was something that I really particularly needed to share out there. It's a private matter, but we're really excited and can't wait for her to get here,' he said on Friday.
