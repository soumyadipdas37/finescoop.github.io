Australia's worst postcodes for mortgage stress have been revealed amid fears the first recession in three decades will worsen an already dangerous situation.

Digital Finance Analytics calculated that three-quarters of borrowers were struggling to pay their bills in parts of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and some regional areas.

That is significantly higher than the national average of 40 per cent as the coronavirus lockdowns cripple the economy.

In February, before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, 33 per cent of home borrowers lacked sufficient funds in the bank to meet their expenses.

Six-month mortgage repayment holidays had shielded struggling mortgage holders from the full effects of the lockdown but the banks are now asking for their money and pressuring borrowers to sell if they can't pay up.

Digital Finance Analytics said the problem in outer-suburban areas was set to worsen in March as extended mortgage repayment reprieves ended.

'This is a social disaster not just a financial disaster,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Some of these people have some of the lowest savings and therefore are only a month away from not being able to pay for all of the bills,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It translates into both social and economic pressures as well and it translates into things like violence and drugs.

'This is the foothills of the problem not the pinnacle of the problem.'

At Rowville in Melbourne's outer south-east, 84 per cent of home borrowers were in stress in August.

Epping in the city's north had 78 per cent of borrowers in stress.

Sydney's south-west was also in bad shape with 74 per cent of mortgage holders in duress in Abbotsbury, Bossley Park and Edensor Park.

Mr North said these outer-suburban areas with new houses had a higher proportion of migrants. 

'A lot of people, often migrants, coming in and buying those properties - the McMansions on small lots,' he said.

'Big mortgages are reliant on multiple incomes and unfortunately, it's all going a bit wrong now.' 

Australia's biggest cities weren't the only areas in trouble, with 76 per cent of borrowers struggling at Clarkson, Merriwa and Mindarie in Perth's north.
