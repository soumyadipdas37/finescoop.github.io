Actress Sherrie Hewson unveiled the results of her second facelift live on Loose Women on Tuesday. 

The TV star, who turns 70 on Thursday, showed off hew new taut complexion and admitted she was feeling much better about herself.  

The former Coronation Street star's brother Brett Hutchinson, 71, passed away from a brain tumour in April this year, following a battle with pneumonia and she said this had changed her outlook on life.

All change: Sherrie Hewson revealed the results of her SECOND facelift ahead of her 70th birthday on Loose Women on Tuesday

She said: 'When my brother was ill, I thought I'm gonna save some money and take my family on a lovely holiday.

'Covid happened, so I thought I'll give some money to charity and the rest of it I'm going to treat myself.'

She continued: 'At this age what happens with your face is all that lovely plump face, is gone and your face drains and you just have like a skeletal face. 

 She said: 'When my brother was ill, I thought I'm gonna save some money and take my family on a lovely holiday Covid happened, so I thought I'll give some money to charity and the rest of it I'm going to treat myself'

'I know how old I am I know I've got wrinkles, but I just want to have some sort of plumpness back which made me feel a little bit better about myself.

'I have been an empty vessel for many years. 

Sherrie says she was 'completely broken' when Brett passed away in April – and she couldn’t visit him because of coronavirus restrictions.

Sherrie said: 'I know how old I am I know I've got wrinkles, but I just want to have some sort of plumpness back which made me feel a little bit better about myself'

Making decisions: Sherrie has said she is more determined than ever to live life to the full after losing her beloved brother Brett to a brain tumour back in April 

But she said she is more determined than ever to live life to the full.  

She told the Sunday Mirror: 'I am still not very strong, I still have moments. Whenever I hear any Motown music, which he loved, I just cry. The pain is so terrible, my heart is broken.

'I mean, look at my brother. Two years ago he was the healthiest thing on this planet. So none of us know what’s going to happen.

'I wish I had planned more when I was younger. Instead I just went steaming ahead, thinking I was going to live forever.'

Sherrie had her first facelift when she was aged 50 in a bid to try to save her marriage to her ex DJ Ken Boyd, who she accused of cheating on her. The couple divorced in 2011.

She previously said: 'After turning 50 you get those saggy arms and start to put weight on that you didn't have before.

'Suddenly your face has got all of these wrinkles. Everything starts to change.'

At the time, Sherrie said she had been inspired by Sharon Osborne's 'amazing' cosmetic surgery, Sherrie had a facelift, fillers, Botox and threading.
