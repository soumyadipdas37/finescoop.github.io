Jon Hamm has opened his heart and his home to a new furry companion.

The Mad Men actor and avid dog lover, 49, welcomed his new rescue pooch, Splash, into his life on Wednesday. 

Los Angeles based nonprofit organization, I Stand With My Pack, helped create the union after the dog was returned twice because of his 'puppy energy' and took to Instagram to announce the heartwarming news.

'He was returned twice at the shelter because of his puppy energy. We rescued him and found him the best home. He lives a fairy tale life now. Happy adoption Splash. We are over the moon for you,' the shelter wrote. 

In the adorable photo, Jon can be seen in his backyard cuddling up to his new pet as he lounges barefoot in black shorts and a black T-shirt. 

For the casual day with his new canine, Jon wore his salt 'n' pepper hair short and added a pair of reading glasses.  

The lawn could be seen scattered with Splash's belongings as the four-month-old Shepherd mix sat with his new owner in his 'furever' home.

The veteran actor looked smitten with his new golden pooch as he held his new boy close and gave a closed mouth smile for the camera.  

Jon who has no children of his own has always been a long-time proponent of animal rescue, 'It’s easy to do and inexpensive,' the actor told People in 2015. 

His last dog, Cora - also a Shepherd mix - was with Jon for 14 years before she devastatingly passed in 2017.

The actor adopted her when he was with actress Jennifer Westfeldt. The animal loving couple welcomed the dog early on in their relationship, Cora staying with Jon two years after they split.

Jon has openly spoken about pet adoption and how it has impacted his life 'in such a positive way.'

'Pets can bring to us a sense of love and pride and all of those wonderful things.' He added that something bringing 'pure joy and love' is a nice thing 'to have in your life' he continued to People. 

Though he is no doubt enjoying time with his new companion, the actor has been gearing up for a couple projects. 

Virtual hang: The movie icon teased a virtual hang to support small theater in his hometown of St. Louis. Independent theaters are struggling immensely due to the pandemic prompting Jon to give back to his roots 

Speaking to Hoda Kotb on an episode of Today, Hamm discussed the virtual hangout he is promoting to support small theater in his hometown of St. Louis. Fans will donate money which puts their name in a raffle to have a 'virtual chat' with Hamm.  

The actor who 'earned his equity card' working in small theaters wants to give back to the struggling arts businesses that gave him the experience to make it as a working actor. 

In addition to giving back to his community, the actor also is preparing for the release of Top Gun Maverick, a sequel to the 1986 classic film starring Tom Cruise.  

Hamm will be playing alongside Miles Teller as well as Top Gun original actors Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer and Jennifer Connelly. The film is set to be released on December 23, 2020 and according to Hamm will be 'everything you hope it's going to be.'
