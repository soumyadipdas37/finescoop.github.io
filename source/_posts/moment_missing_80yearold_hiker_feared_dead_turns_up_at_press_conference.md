This is the incredible moment a missing 80-year-old hiker feared dead was today reunited with his loved ones following a tireless three-day search.  

Harry Harvey was reported missing in the Gunnerside area of Richmondshire, North Yorkshire, at around 1.30pm on Sunday.

The pensioner, described as a 'competent hiker', was miraculously found alive by a wildlife photographer earlier this morning.

A police press conference was organised for today where his family, from Tynemouth, North Tyneside, planned to appeal with people walking in the Dales to keep their eyes peeled for the missing 80-year-old. 

But as the press conference was about to begin at the Tann Hill Inn, one of the most remote pubs in England, a Land Rover pulled into the car park.





To everyone's shock, Harry was helped out by members of a mountain rescue team and his tearful family ran over for an emotional reunion. 

Police said Harry had fallen outside the remote village of Keld and had lain on the moor since Sunday, surviving two nights in the open.

Just as the press conference was getting underway he was found by a local person walking near Keld, who raised the alarm. Knowing his family were nearby making their appeal, the rescuers wasted no time in speeding Harry to Tann Hill.

Mountain rescue teams, who based themselves at the Tan Hill Inn, worked through the night to find Mr Harvey. Local residents and workers were asked to check sheds and barns after Mr Harvey did not reach the pub to meet a friend as intended.

Those involved include Swaledale Mountain Rescue Team, Teesdale & Weardale Mountain Rescue Team, North of Tyne Mountain Rescue, Northumberland National Park Mountain Rescue, Cleveland Mountain Rescue, RAF Mountain Rescue and Mountain Rescue Search Dogs England. 

More than 60 people were involved in the search operation along with the police helicopter and specialist search dogs and handlers.



A spokesperson for Swaledale Mountain Rescue Team said yesterday: 'The team will be out again today searching for Harry in the Tan Hill area. Thanks again to the other Mountain Rescue Teams and Mountain Rescue Search Dogs assisting us.

'Huge thanks also to local people supporting us with food, shelter and off-road transport, Ghyllfoot Tearoom Gunnerside, Tan Hill Inn, Kings Head, Gunnerside and Gunnerside Estate Gamekeepers.'

The team say that to search the vast area effectively using search dogs they need as few scents in the area as possible, hence why they have not asked for public assistance with the searches. 

North Yorkshire Police said this morning: 'Harry Harvey has been found safe and well. He was found by a wildlife photographer who had seen our appeal and noticed Harry waving at her from the direction of Keld.'

Inspector Mark Gee said: 'This is fantastic news that Harry has been found safe and well. I want to thank all the search volunteers for their time, as well as gamekeepers, estate owners, farmers and local residents for their help and understanding.

'Thanks also to the Tan Hill, who looked after the volunteers and Mr Harvey's family.' 

When Harry went missing he was wearing a dark jacket and trousers, walking boots and carrying a large dark rucksack containing all of his camping and hiking gear.
