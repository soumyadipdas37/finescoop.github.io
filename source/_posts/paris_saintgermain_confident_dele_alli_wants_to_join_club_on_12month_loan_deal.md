Paris Saint-Germain are confident Dele Alli wants to join the club as talks with Tottenham continue over a 12-month loan deal.

Alli started the opening game of the season against Everton but was hauled off at half-time and then left out of the trips to Lokomotiv Plovdiv and Southampton.

The arrival of Gareth Bale on a season-long loan deal from Real Madrid has also intensified competition for places and forced Alli out of the first team picture. 

PSG are confident of signing Dele Alli on a 12-month loan deal before the October 5 deadline

Alli has been left out of Tottenham's last two squads against Plovdiv and Southampton

The England international has struggled for consistency for much of the last two seasons

However, Mourinho's ruthless decision to not name him in his squad has come as a shock to both Alli and his Spurs team-mates. 

The England international has struggled for consistency over the past two seasons but has been a regular since Jose Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino.

According to the Telegraph, PSG are now the favourites to be his next club, though the two sides are only discussing a loan move rather than a permanent deal.

Alli scored eight goals in 25 Premier League games last season as Spurs finished sixth

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is thought to prefer a loan move, in the knowledge that Alli's value has suffered through a combination of poor form and a depressed transfer market. 

PSG have a good relationship with Spurs having sold Lucas Moura and Serge Aurier to the Premier League side in recent years and that could help them to clinch a deal before the transfer deadline on October 5. 

Alli still has four years left on the contract extension he signed back in 2018 and Spurs are hopeful a loan move will help him to recapture his best form.

There remains interest in Alli from Inter Milan but the Serie A club may struggle to finance a loan move for the 24-year-old.

Last season the former MK Dons midfielder, who joined the club in 2015, scored eight goals in 25 Premier League games as Spurs finished sixth in the top flight.
