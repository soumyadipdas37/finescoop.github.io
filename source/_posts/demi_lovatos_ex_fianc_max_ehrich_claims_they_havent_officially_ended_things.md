Max Ehrich has insisted he has not officially ended his engagement to Demi Lovato, despite the singer revealing last week they have broken up after six months together.

The actor posted a stream of Instagram Stories, which he has since deleted, on Sunday night, in which he claimed the former couple have not spoken and 'haven't even officially ended anything to each other.' 

The new posts come after a source told People on Saturday that Demi, 28, made Ehrich 'aware that the relationship was over and it was going to come out in the press.'

Demi - who's a recovering addict - met Max in March, began quarantining together immediately, and they got engaged in July.  

Max claimed over the weekend that he learned that their six-month relationship over via reports in the press last Thursday, alleging cast and crew of his film Southern Gospel witnessed him learning about his break-up 'in a tabloid' while on the Atlanta set.

In a new stream of posts on Sunday Max again hit back at source claims that Demi had told him the relationship was over, writing on Stories:

'Up to this moment we haven't spoken over the phone... we haven't even officially ended anything to each other. Literally. I'm here in real time with y'all. I love Demetria and just want her to be healthy and safe.'

He wrote in another Story: 'If you're reading this ... I love you always.... unconditionally... not matter what'.

Max also told his followers to 'go stream' Demi's track It's OK Not To Be OK, telling them ' They lyrics are incredible. Her voice is impeccable. Keep it at #1 forever. It's what Demetria deserves. I love you.'

He also pleaded 'Give her the Grammy she deserves!' and declared 'Demetria is THEE best female voalist alive. And everyone should know it.'

'She inspires me every day and is an INCREDIBLE human being. I know it's not her writing these stories. It's a machine. I love her unconditionally. Demetria I love you always and forever.'  

The 29-year-old actor alleged Saturday morning that cast and crew of his film Southern Gospel witnessed him learning about his break-up 'in a tabloid' while on the Atlanta set.

'This is the God's honest truth of how I found out about the ending of the engagement,' Max wrote to his 1.6M Instagram followers.

'To find out over the Internet was beyond anything I could've ever imagined a person could do to another human. Leave me alone.'

However, a source told People on Saturday that the 28-year-old pop star made Ehrich 'aware that the relationship was over and it was going to come out in the press.'

Since then Lovato and the four-time Daytime Emmy nominee have completely wiped each other from their respective social media accounts.
