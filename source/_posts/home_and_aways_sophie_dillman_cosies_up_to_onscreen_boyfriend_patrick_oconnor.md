Sophie Dillman and Patrick O'Connor play loved-up couple Ziggy Astoni and Dean Thompson on Home and Away.  

On Tuesday, the pair - who also happen to be dating in real life - couldn't wipe the smiles off their faces at work on the long-running drama. 

At one point Patrick had his arm around his girlfriend as they chatted to a cameraman between scenes at Sydney's Palm Beach.

Sophie looked casual chic in a black printed T-Shirt with a matching black leather-type skirt which featured a front zipper and a thigh-high split. 

She complemented the look with an oversized button-up denim shirt, and a simple, always-fashionable pair of black sneakers. 

The blonde beauty wore her long tresses down for the scene and appeared to be wearing light makeup.

Smitten: Sophie and Patrick have been going out for a number of months after meeting on the Channel Seven drama.

Sophie has been a cast member for slightly longer than Patrick, having portrayed Ziggy Astoni since June 2017. 

In the beginning, their characters Dean and Ziggy didn't get along. But over time they became close friends, and eventually, lovers. 

Similarly, Sophie and Patrick's romantic relationship seems to have blossomed from a friendship, simply achieved by spending time together.
