Face mask rebels in east Java have been ordered to dig graves for coronavirus victims as punishment.

Eight people who refused to wear face masks in Gresik regency were made to dig graves at a public cemetery in Ngabetan Village Public Cemetery. 

The people being punished did not participate in funeral services but two were assigned to dig each grave.

Cerme district head Suyono said: 'There are only three available grave diggers at the moment, so I thought I might as well put these people to work with them.
