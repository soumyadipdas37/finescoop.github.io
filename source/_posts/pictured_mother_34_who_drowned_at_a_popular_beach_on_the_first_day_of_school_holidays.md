A mother who drowned in rough surf while her 11-year-old daughter watched in horror has been identified as a Toowoomba nursery worker.

Natasha Thorpe, 34, was swimming with her daughter at the unpatrolled First Bay beach in Coolum on Monday, on the Sunshine Coast, when the pair were dragged out to sea.

Witnesses said the girl was able to make it back to shore, but Ms Thorpe was spotted floating in the water. 

Surfers rushed the mother to the sand and performed CPR for about 30 minutes until paramedics arrived, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Ms Thorpe was holidaying in the area with her extended family who were all nearby when she drowned. 

Sergeant Peter Blake from the Coolum Police Station told ABC News it was an 'absolute tragedy'. 

'Her brother and her father, as well as mum and her daughter, were all the vicinity of where this happened,' Sergeant Blake said.  

He said the water looked inviting but it was potentially dangerous for people who weren't used to swimming in the surf.

'It's not exactly clear how she got into trouble, but there is a lot of water moving around with the swell that is coming in,' he said.

A report will be prepared for the coroner.
