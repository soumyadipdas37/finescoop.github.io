A 33-year-old woman is fighting for her life in hospital after suffering what doctors believe was a heart attack at her own wedding. 

The bride, from the Sadot Negev region in south Israel, collapsed during the ceremony on Sunday. 

Some of the guests were medical professionals who were able to keep the woman alive until paramedics arrived, IsraelHayom reported.  

The bride, who is herself a doctor, was rushed to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba in a critical condition. 

The woman received CPR en route to the hospital, local media said.

She is currently being treated in the intensive care unit in the cardiology wing of the hospital. 

The wedding was held in the garden of a private home, with weddings halls closed amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Traditionally weddings in Israel are lavish affairs, attended by hundreds of guests. 

But current regulations because of Covid-19 mean the bride and groom are allowed no more than 20 guests each in attendance to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. 

There have so far been around 113,000 known diagnoses of coronavirus in Israel and 906 deaths.
