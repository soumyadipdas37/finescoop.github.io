Three-time Grammy winner P!NK called her 14-year marriage to her 'favorite sweet little dirtball' Carey Hart both 'awful' and 'wonderful' while championing couple's therapy.

'It is our relentless and stubborn idealism that keeps us together,' the 41-year-old Pennsylvania-born pop star - who boasts 79.6M social media followers - explained on Monday.

'Marriage is awful, wonderful, comfort and rage. It is boring, terrifying, and a total nail biter. It is loving another fallible creature while trying to love yourself. It is a lifetime of coming back to the table.

'People laugh at us because we're either fighting or laughing. They roll their eyes when we talk about therapy. But I'll tell you what. It's worth it. All of it. Even when it isn't.'

Pink (born Alecia Moore) went on to write that therapy isn't for 'weak people or hippies or liberals' in a bizarre political spin.

'It's for broken people that want to be whole,' the Hurts 2B Human songstress continued.

'Therapy isn't for weak people or hippies or liberals': Pink and the 45-year-old retired motocross racer - who split in 2003 and 2008 - openly admit the 'only reason that we're still together' is their marriage counselor, Vanessa Inn (pictured)

The Hurts 2B Human songstress told Inn during their Instagram Live on June 19: 'Without Vanessa translating for me for the last 18 years, we would not be together. We just wouldn't'

'I love you babe!' The attachment parents are raising their children - daughter Willow Sage, 9; and son Jameson Moon, 3 - in a gender-neutral environment (pictured January 2)

'It's for runaways that want a family. It's a lesson on how to sit down and listen. How to love yourself so that the other person can, too. I love you babe. I'm grateful we made it to this photo.'

Pink and the 45-year-old retired motocross racer - who split in 2003 and 2008 - openly admit the 'only reason that we're still together' is their marriage counselor, Vanessa Inn.

'I think partners, after a long time, we just speak - I can't say it's a man and woman thing. I think it's a partner thing and spouse thing that you just speak two different languages and you need someone to hear both of you and then translate it for you,' the Lady Marmalade alum told Inn during their hour-long Instagram Live conversation on June 19. 

Airing Wednesday on CBS! Pink and Keith Urban will debut their new duet One Too Many at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville for the 55th Annual ACM Awards

'And without Vanessa translating for me for the last 18 years, we would not be together. We just wouldn't. Because we are not taught as kids how to have relationships, how to get along with people.'

The attachment parents are raising their children - daughter Willow Sage, 9; and son Jameson Moon, 3 - in a gender-neutral environment.

Pink and Keith Urban will debut their new duet One Too Many at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville for the 55th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards, which air Wednesday night on CBS.
