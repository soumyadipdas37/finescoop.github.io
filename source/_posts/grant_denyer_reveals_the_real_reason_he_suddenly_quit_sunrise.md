Grant Denyer quit his job at Sunrise live on air in 2013. 

At the time, he blamed exhaustion for the exit, but on his podcast with wife Chezzi Denyer, It's All True?, the 43-year-old revealed there was more to the story. 

The TV personality confessed this week that he is an 'empath' - which the dictionary defines as 'a person with the paranormal ability to perceive the mental or emotional state of another individual'. 

Struggle: Grant Denyer (picrured) quit Sunrise in 2013. At the time, he blamed exhaustion for the exit, but on his podcast with wife Chezzi Denyer, It's All True? he revealed there was more to the story, revealing he's an 'empath' and struggled to cover devastating events

That sensitivity made him vulnerable to covering devastating events like natural disasters, such as the Queensland floods in 2010 and 2011 and the Christchurch earthquake in 2011. 

Explaining that both he and his wife Chezzi are empaths, Grant referred to the coverage as 'a very heavy toll'. 

'You are there telling human stories but people are hurting and we are both empaths so... you just get really weighed down with it. It was a hectic period and I was like, I don't think I can do this anymore. I was wiped,' he said. 

Difficult: That sensitivity made him vulnerable to covering natural disasters, such as the Queensland floods in 2010 and the Christchurch earthquake in 2011. 'I'm seeing bits of body and a headless torso sitting in the driver's seat. I wasn't equipped to see that s**t,' he said

The former Family Feud host explained that the graphic scenes he encountered left him traumatised. 

'I'm there and I'm seeing bits of body and a headless torso sitting in the driver's seat. I wasn't equipped to see that s**t. There was bits of brain everywhere. You go from a decapitation to a cat up a tree,' he said on the podcast. 

Grant spent time at a Thai health facility in 2013, with his manager Titus Day saying the host was being treated in Thailand for an 'ongoing unknown stomach illness'.
