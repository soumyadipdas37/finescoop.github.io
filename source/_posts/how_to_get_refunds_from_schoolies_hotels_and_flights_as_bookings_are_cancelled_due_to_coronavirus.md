Schoolies who were hoping to travel to Queensland for their end-of-year celebrations could be eligible for a refund while others are likely to be left disappointed. 

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk cancelled this year's event on Friday to stop the spread of coronavirus leaving thousands disappointed.    

Interstate revellers who planned to travel to the sunshine state for their post school celebration will be able to use COVID-19 travel restrictions as the basis for a refund.

However youngsters from Queensland looking to celebrate in their home state will need to check the terms and conditions of their bookings for a refund. 

Fair Trading executive director Brian Bauer told Quest Newspapers Queenslanders may not be able to use coronavirus as an excuse.

'Queensland school leavers are still allowed to travel to the Gold Coast and so are able to take up their bookings and have an end-of-year celebration,' he said.

'But they will need to comply with the restrictions in place, including social distancing and limits on gatherings in holiday units.

'These consumers are unlikely to be automatically entitled to a refund. However they may still have options under their booking provider’s terms and conditions.'

All Schoolies Week 2020 official events have been cancelled by the state government.

This could be handy for Queenslanders, as anyone who has booked a package which includes an official Schoolies event would qualify for a refund if part of their deal is cancelled. 

Mr Bauer said Schoolies should check the terms and conditions of their booking to see if they are able to receive a refund, voucher or credit.

Ms Palaszczuk said cancelling the major end-of-high-school celebrations was a tough decision. 

'It poses a high risk,' she said.

'High risk, not only the people who attend, all the young people, but also all the people they come in contact with, and of course their families and their friends and their grandparents.'

'So, we've had to take that very tough decision. So there will be, unfortunately, no concerts, no organised events, because there can be no mass gatherings.' 

Ms Palaszczuk said the chief health officer and director-general of education will be writing to every school in the state to inform them and ensure students understand the rules.

The premier said students can still book end-of-school holidays with their friends but it should be a quieter celebration.  

'Just as any other person can go along and book accommodation, people are welcome to continue to do that, in those small groups, right across Queensland,' she said.

'There is nothing wrong with small groups of people finishing school, booking somewhere close to where they live as well.' 

Ms Palaszczuk is urging people to celebrate their achievement by holidaying in Queensland and supporting local businesses and tourism operators. 

'It's a tough year for everyone. And hopefully, hopefully, things will get better by the end of next year, and we can have a double celebration.'

'But we're in a world pandemic, and I just hope everyone understands that.'

Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said the current Year 12 group has had a 'really difficult year'.

'This is a rite of passage. Your last year of school is such an important year... and so much of it has had to change for this group,' Dr Young said. 

'But look, I think this group is one of the most resilient, innovative groups, and I'm looking forward to seeing what they will put in place instead of that traditional mass gatherings on the beaches and so forth.'

Schoolies week first began on the Gold Coast in the late 1970s in the weeks following final exams with the Broadbeach Hotel as the main meeting place.

Events began to be organised in 1980 when the Gold Coast started attracting students from all over the country to celebrate.
