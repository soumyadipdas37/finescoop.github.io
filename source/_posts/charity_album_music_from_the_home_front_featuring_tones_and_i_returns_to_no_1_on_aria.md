A COVID-19 charity album featuring Jimmy Barnes, Tones and I, Delta Goodrem and Guy Sebastian has returned to number one on the ARIA charts. 

Music From The Home Front spent two straight weeks at number one in June and July after the online concert of the same name aired on ANZAC Day. 

This week, the album was re-released as a triple vinyl record, giving it a huge second wind and taking it back to the top spot.

All of the profits from the album go towards the Support Act charity, which is supporting artists, crew and music workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The top three spots on the chart were all Australian artists with the second spot taken out by Powderfinger with a 20th anniversary reissue of Odyssey Number Five.

Meanwhile, Fremantle band San Cisco came in at number three with their fourth album Between You And Me.

'It shows just what a special moment it was for Australia, and how our artists come together and heed the call when we need them most,' Mr Rosen said. 

'I would also like to congratulate the awesome Powderfinger on reaching #2 with their 20th anniversary edition of Odyssey Number Five. It is a landmark album by one of this country's great bands. 

'And congratulations to San Cisco, on debuting at #3 on the ARIA Charts with their wonderful independent album Between You And Me. They are all part of a great week for Australian artists on the ARIA Charts.'

Meanwhile, the singles chart was dominated by US artists with Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's WAP in the top position. 

It is the fourth week in a row that WAP has managed to stay at the number one position.  

Mood by 24kGoldn and Iann Dior came second while Jason Derulo's Savage Love took out the third spot.
