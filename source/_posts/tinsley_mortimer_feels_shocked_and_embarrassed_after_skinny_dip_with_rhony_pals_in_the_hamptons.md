The Real Housewives Of New York looked back at their wild trip to The Hamptons in a new teaser for the second part of their season 12 reunion.

Tinsley Mortimer admitted she was 'shocked' by her behavior during the debauchery-filled trip during an exclusive preview for DailyMail.com, telling Andy Cohen she was a bit 'embarrassed' by her skinny-dipping escapades.

The Bravo host told Tinsley, 45, he was 'impressed' that fellow Housewife Leah McSweeney, 38, was able to convince her to strip down and hop in the pool.

I did that?  Tinsley Mortimer admitted she was 'shocked' and 'embarrassed' by some of her wild antics during THAT crazy girls trip to The Hamptons this season

Bare it: During the trip Leah McSweeney was able to convince Tinsley and fellow Housewife Sonja Morgan to strip down for some skinny dipping 

'I was shocked too,' Mortimer said. 'Trust me. I was like, "What if my mom sees me?"'

'I'm such a great influence,' Leah said, adding that she's sure Tinsley's mom Dale Mercer 'really appreciates it.'

Mortimer went on to reveal that she was less worried about stripping down and more concerned with her plain underthings.

'I was embarrassed because I was like, "My God. If I'm going to strip down I might as well have on a cute bra and underwear on," and I had tan colored underwear.'

Leah reassured her she looked good while Mortimer admitted she was happy with her figure.

Persuasive! The Bravo host told Tinsley Mortimer he was 'impressed' that fellow Housewife Leah McSweeney was able to convince her to take off her clothes

Shocked: 'I was shocked too,' she said. 'Trust me. I was like, "What if my mom sees me?"'

Convincing: 'I'm such a great influence,' Leah said, adding that she's sure Tinsley's mom Dale Mercer 'really appreciates it'

Nude: 'I was embarrassed because I was like, "My God. If I'm going to strip down I might as well have on a cute bra and underwear on," and I had tan colored underwear' 

'I was so much thinner than I am now,' Tinsley said. 'I'll take that body now.'

'Yeah, and I wasn't and they still talked me into in, Sonja added.

During the reunion they also tried to solve the mystery of who left a vibrator on a plate of chicken picatta.

Andy got straight down to it, demanding to know: 'Who put the vibrator in the chicken?'

Sonja Morgan was the first to chime in, claiming Leah McSweeney was responsible before realizing she actually could have been the culprit.

Whodunnit: Andy asked the gals who was responsible for putting a vibrator on a dish of leftover chicken during the debauchery-filled group trip 

Who did that: Somehow, a pair of glasses ended up in a wine glass and a vibrator ended up in a plate of chicken piccata during the wild evening

Whoops: Sonja Morgan was the first to chime in, claiming Leah McSweeney was responsible before realizing she actually could have been the culprit

'Leah did! Cause I tried to stand it up and it wouldn't,' Morgan admitted.

'Oh I guess I did,' she then shrugged.

'No one remembers,' Leah said in the background.

But Ramona Singer, host of the debaucherous evening, had her theories, telling Andy: 'Dorinda gifted us a lot of stuff.

'I think at night when they were all drinking and I left they were playing with the vibrators and somehow one just popped into the chicken.'

Not me! Ramona Singer, host of the trip, had her theories, telling Andy 'I think at night when they were all drinking and I left they were playing with the vibrators and somehow one just popped into the chicken'

An abundance: Dorinda chimed in reminding everyone she brought an entire box of adult items on the trip

Travel toy? They continued on the topic of sex toys as Andy asked Luann de Lesseps about why her bag was vigorously vibrating when they arrived at the airport for the getaway

Dorinda chimed in reminding everyone she brought an entire box of sex toys on the trip.

Trying to get a word in, Lead said: 'Me and Sonja were molesting the vibrator.

They continued on the topic of sex toys as Andy asked Luann de Lesseps about why her bag was vigorously vibrating when they arrived at the airport for the getaway.

'It was a juice mixer!' she said while trying to stifle her laughter.

Not what you think! 'It was a juice mixer!' she said while trying to stifle her laughter

Nope: Ramona wasn't having it, telling Andy 'That doesn't make that much noise!'

Ramona wasn't having it, telling Andy: 'That doesn't make that much noise!'

'I swear to God!' the former Countess said while Sonja defended her.

But it turns out Luann did have a little something extra in her bag, admitting: 'Andy, I had a vibrator in my bag, but it didn't go off because I had to replace the batteries.'

The ladies will dish even more details during the second chapter of Real Housewives Of New York season 12 reunion, which airs Thursday night at 9pm on Bravo.
