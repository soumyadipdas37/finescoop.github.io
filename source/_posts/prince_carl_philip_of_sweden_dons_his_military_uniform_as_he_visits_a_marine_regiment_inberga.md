Prince Carl Philip of Sweden donned his military uniform today when visiting a marine regiment in Berga.

The royal, 41, a former Major in the Swedish Navy, sported a green camouflage jacket and matching trousers for his solo outing, with the father-of-two appearing without his wife Princess Sofia.

He toured the 1st Marine Regiment and the 4th Naval Warfare Flotilla in Berga, Sweden, speaking with officers and crew members.

The prince was taken around the surrounding woodland and even shown some of the machinery used by the groups.

Wearing black boots fit for the occasion, the royal appeared to mean business as he walked across the grounds with a military hat covering his locks.

The 1st Marine Regiment forms a vital link between Sweden's naval and army forces, according to its website.

'The regiment's coastal rangers and naval personnel have a variety of advanced, highly mobile weapon systems giving them the capability to control coastal areas effectively,' it added.

Meanwhile, the 4th Naval Warfare Flotilla is tasked with a variety of roles including submarine hunting and naval and airspace surveillance.

Known as Sweden's real-life Prince Charming, Carl Philip broke the hearts of royal-watchers across the globe when he announced his engagement to former reality TV star Sofia Hellqvist in 2014, four years after news of their relationship first hit headlines.

The couple welcomed their first son, Prince Alexander, in April 2016 and another little boy, Prince Gabriel, arrived in August the following year.

The prince is the only son of the King and Queen of Sweden and is fourth-in-line to the throne.

In 1980 a law was passed which gave his older sister Victoria precedence in the line of succession.

The royal's visit comes after his wife Princess Sofia of Sweden said she would never want a version of 'Megxit' to happen within her royal family - stating she has 'found such a fantastic balance'.

The 35-year-old royal shared her thoughts in a documentary titled Princess Sofia: Project Playground which aired on Swedish channel TV4. 

According to Royal Central, when asked about whether she would ever consider following the lead of the Duke, 35, and Duchess of Sussex, 39, the former model said: 'No. Not really. I think I have found such a fantastic balance, and I really see it as a positive that I have made it through these stormy years. 

'It is such a huge advantage, in that we have the opportunity to stand a little in both worlds.'  

Princess Sofia has much in common with Meghan with neither having any royal connections when they met their princes - Harry and Carl Philip - and leaving behind the showbiz world for a rather more sedate life.
