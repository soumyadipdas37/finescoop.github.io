A coronavirus vaccine set to be rolled out in Australia in January will require two injections and is expected to provide immunity for several years, health minister Greg Hunt said today.

The federal government has signed a deal to buy a vaccine being developed at Oxford University and will also produce one being developed at the University of Queensland if they are deemed safe.

In total the government wants to roll out 80million doses next year, including 3.8million for vulnerable people and healthcare workers in January and February.

Mr Hunt today revealed that both vaccines will require two injections to be effective.

'It's likely that both vaccines will require what's called a double shot, or an initial vaccination and a booster approximately a month later,' he told reporters.

He said they will likely provide immunity to coronavirus for several years.

'The best advice that we have - and it's not determined yet - is that there is likely to be multiyear protection,' he said.

'Nobody can say whether it will be lifetime.' 

Researchers at the University of Queensland are in early controlled-group stages in the testing of their vaccine - known as phase one - while the University of Oxford scientists are at the more advanced phase-three stage involving 30,000 people.

Once approved, the vaccines will be rolled out to Australians who want one for free. A vaccine will not be compulsory.

'Australians will gain free access to a COVID-19 vaccine in 2021 if trials prove successful,' Mr Morrison said.

'By securing the production and supply agreements, Australians will be among the first in the world to receive a safe and effective vaccine, should it pass late-stage testing.

'There are no guarantees that these vaccines will prove successful, however, the agreement puts Australia at the top of the queue if our medical experts give the vaccines the green light.'

Late last month, volunteers aged 55 and over were urged to help with the next phase of human trials for the University of Queensland's vaccine.

The tests would gauge if the vaccine is safe for older people, virologist and project co-leader Professor Paul Young said.

'As most people are now aware, Covid-19 appears to have a higher degree of disease severity in older individuals,' he said.

'By conducting this expanded safety study, we'll be able to gather key data to support the large-scale efficacy trials.'

UQ is recruiting 48 volunteers between 56-65 years of age and another 48 volunteers aged 66 years and over.

The team was aiming to start the new trials within three weeks, with volunteers required to make nine visits for two doses and 'regular bleeds'.  

The global progress in vaccine development comes as Melbourne residents were told they would remain under coronavirus lockdown until at least October 26. 

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has outlined a four-step plan for the state to return to normality if case numbers continue to fall. 

From September 14, the nightly curfew will start an hour later at 9pm and run until 5am.

People living alone can nominate a friend or family member who can visit them and two hours of daily exercise will be allowed, including 'social interactions' such as having a picnic at a local park or reading a book at the beach. 

Further restrictions could be eased from September 28 and the government will consider lifting the curfew entirely from October 26, depending on case numbers. 

'We can't run out of lockdown. We have to take steady and safe steps out of lockdown to find that COVID normal,' Mr Andrews said on Sunday. 

Under Mr Andrews' roadmap out of lockdown, residents will have to wait until November 23 for all retail stores to reopen.

The university received a request from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to use its newly patented DNA-based molecular clamp technology to fast-track the vaccine after the virus hit Australia's shores in January. 

A team of 20 researchers have spent the last 15 months preparing for a 'rapid response'. 

The technology uses the DNA sequence of the coronavirus released by China to produce a protein that's the same as the one on the surface of the actual virus.

That protein will be the essence of the vaccine, capable of generating immune system responses that protect people.
