Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly entered the race to land Jorginho from Chelsea by opening talks over a loan move to the French capital.

The Italy midfielder has started the Blues' first two Premier League games of the season but was substituted in both before being dropped for Saturday's 3-3 draw at West Bromwich Albion. 

With the summer arrival of Kai Havertz, competition is high for a starting spot in the Blues midfield and the 28-year-old could be open to a move away from west London.

According to Telefoot, French champions PSG have already 'established a connection' with Chelsea over signing Jorginho on loan.

However, Thomas Tuchel's side are expected to face a fight for the signature of the former Napoli star from Arsenal who are also keen on landing the player. 

Jorginho arrived at Chelsea in 2018 in a move worth around £57million as he followed manager Maurizio Sarri from Napoli where he had starred in Serie A.

Despite Sarri's departure a year later, he remained a key part of Lampard's side that finished inside the top four last term to seal a return to the Champions League.

Meanwhile, Chelsea's midfield clear out could see N'Golo Kante leave the club, with Manchester United making a shock enquiry for the 29-year-old.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek may also be surplus to requirements as Aston Villa, West Ham and Southampton chase England's World Cup star from two years ago in Russia.
