The 74-year-old executive produces and stars in Christmas on the Square, based on the single of the same name.

Helmed by Grey's Anatomy actress/director Debbie Allen, the movie also features Treat Williams (Blue Bloods), Josh Segarra (Orange Is the New Black) and Jeanine Mason (Roswell, New Mexico).

Baranski (The Good Fight) stars as Regina, a rich woman with a heart of coal, who returns to her small hometown after her father's death, with plans of evicting all his tenants and selling the land to a mall developer.

But she's soon moved by the Christmas spirit, after connecting with the townspeople, reconnecting with an old love and meeting an actual angel (played by Parton).
