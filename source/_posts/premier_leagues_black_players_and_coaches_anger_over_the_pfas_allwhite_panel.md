A number of the Premier League's black players and coaches have complained to the PFA over the union's decision to appoint an all-white selection panel to begin the process of replacing chief executive Gordon Taylor. 

Sportsmail has been told that there is considerable unhappiness amongst players at the narrow composition of the three-person panel, to be chaired by former England defender Gary Neville, on the grounds that it does not reflect the fact that around 30 per cent of PFA members are black.

Neville's panel is completed by PFA Board member Edward Canty and Oxford defender John Mousinho, who is also on their management committee. The trio have been tasked with appointing four independent non-executive directors, who will then lead the search for Taylor's replacement.

The 75-year-old announced he was standing down last year following almost 40 years in charge of the union after PFA chairman Ben Purkiss launched a public challenge to his leadership by calling for a review of its governance, but his departure has been protracted as Taylor has insisted on leading that process himself.

In a statement announcing the formation of the selection panel last month the PFA said that the four directors ultimately chosen would lead 'a robust independent and transparent recruitment process' for a new chief executive. Given the manner in which the panel has been set up however, many players are understood to lack confidence in the PFA's decision-making.

The failure of the PFA's leadership to adequately reflect the membership has long been a source of frustration to many players. Former West Ham winger Bobby Barnes has a senior role as one of two deputy chief executives under Taylor, but there is no other ethnic minority representation in the leadership team.

In addition there is only one black player - Manchester United's third-choice goalkeeper Lee Grant - on the 13-strong management committee comprised of current players. As a result a number of disillusioned black players and coaches have held talks about forming their own union or pressure group to provide support to others from minority backgrounds, but nothing has been formalised.

The unhappy players have no problem with Neville, who is widely respected for his experiences and contacts within the game and has won the trust of many due to his growing awareness diversity issues. 

The former England assistant issued a public apology to Raheem Sterling in June after admitting he let him down during a team meeting at Euro 2016, when he failed to offer the England winger sufficient support after he had been a victim of racial abuse.

A number of PFA staff are also understood to be concerned at the make-up of the selection panel, which they feel does not reflect well on the organisation. Following a summer in which the issue of racial equality has dominated many aspects of sporting discourse, with Premier League players still taking the knee before matches and the Black Lives Matter logo being placed on all shirts last season, there is a general sense of astonishment that the PFA could show themselves to be so tone deaf on the subject.
