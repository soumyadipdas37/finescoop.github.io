Taiwan has criticised and threatened to fine two pop singers after they agreed to perform patriotic songs on a Chinese TV show celebrating the country’s upcoming National Day.

The Taiwanese stars, Ouyang Nana, 20, and Angela Chang, 38, are scheduled to appear on state television tomorrow and sing nationalistic songs such as ‘My Motherland’, a performance seen by as a propaganda coup for Beijing.

Taiwanese authorities warned that the stars could be violating the law and face a fine up to NT$500,000 (£13,381) if they insist to perform in the Communist country.

The stark warning comes amid rising tensions between Taiwan and China, which has been flexing its muscle by conducting military drills and threatening to seize the self-ruled island by force.

Over the weekend, state broadcaster CCTV announced its TV special marking the Communist regime’s 71st anniversary on October 1, also known as China’s National Day.

A raft of the country’s most popular singers and actors will appear on the show and perform patriotic songs, including the 20-year-old musician Ouyang Nana and 38-year-old singer Angela Chang.

Nana, known as a cellist and the daughter of a famous Taiwanese politician and an actress, has won extreme popularity in China after actively appearing on Chinese TV shows.

The 38-year-old singer, Chang, rose to fame after starring in multiple popular Taiwanese dramas and became an international star when two of her albums sold millions in Asia in the 2000s.

The state media’s announcement was slammed on Monday by Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which warned the Taiwanese pop stars could face punishment if they insist to perform on the Chinese television.

The authorities reportedly said that citizens should not support and assist the Chinese Communist Party in carrying out propaganda against Taiwan and harming the island’s national identity.

A MAC spokesman added that the Taiwanese officials were closely monitoring the situation and would deal with the incident accordingly if they found the pop stars had violated the law.

In response to the news, Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang told local media on Sunday: ‘Taiwan is a democratic and free country. Some people enjoy freedom and democracy and use Taiwan's health insurance resources. She's going as a public figure to China to sing inappropriate songs.’

The TV show is scheduled to air on Chinese television on Wednesday evening.

The 20-year-old Taiwanese musician Nana has faced controversies last year after claiming she ‘was from China’ and ‘proud of being Chinese’.

The pop star’s statement came after she had appeared to be censored and cut out from pictures by a Beijing TV station reporting about a fashion shoot that featured her and three other young actresses.

Nana's father, 58-year-old Ouyang Long, is the spokesperson of Beijing-friendly Kuomintang, the main opposition party in Taiwan.

He reportedly said in a Kuomintang meeting earlier this month that the party's attitude towards Taiwan's political situation was 'no unification, no independence, no military force', which seems to have caused an outcry among Chinese web users and landed his daughter in trouble.

China considers Taiwan part of its territory, to be absorbed into the mainland, by force if necessary, even though it has been self-ruled for more than seven decades.

Beijing has ratcheted up pressure on the democratic island since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who rejects its view that Taiwan is part of 'one China'.

Last year, Taiwan accused China of violating a long-held tacit agreement after its fighter jets - for the first time in years - crossed the median line of the waters that separate the two sides.

Washington's increased outreach to Taiwan under President Donald Trump has become yet another flashpoint with Beijing, as the US and China clash over a range of trade and security issues, as well as the coronavirus pandemic.

In recent months Taiwan has reported a sharp rise in incursions by Chinese warplanes into its air defence identification zone (ADIZ).
