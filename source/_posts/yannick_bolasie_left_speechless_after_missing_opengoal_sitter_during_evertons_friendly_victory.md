Yannick Bolasie has admitted there were 'no excuses' for his embarrassing open-goal miss for Everton in their pre-season friendly win over Preston on Saturday.

The Toffees winger was given the ball in the six-yard box with the goal gaping but somehow managed to kick the ball behind him. 

Bolasie saw the funny side after the match as he posted on Twitter with an embarrassed Homer Simpson GIF saying: 'No excuses....I have no idea #lostmyhead.'

But thankfully for Bolasie, Carlo Ancelotti's side ran out 2-0 winners at Goodison Park. 

And Everton's new £21million signing Allan was in attendance as he watched on from the stands.  

The Brazilian watched Jonjoe Kenny score his first senior Everton goal as he buried the ball into the net after seven minutes.

Bernard flourished in a central role, surging upfield with the ball at his feet and supplying a number of incisive passes.

Indeed, it was Bernard skipping forward and funnelling the ball to Richarlison which opened up Preston for Everton's second goal on 65 minutes, as Dominic Calvert-Lewin steamed in to force home from the left-wing cross. 

The lone downside for Everton arrived with an injury for Mason Holgate, who hobbled off 14 minutes before half-time after hurting himself stretching to tackle in his own half.

Holgate was replaced by Kyle John, joining fellow Academy products Anthony Gordon, fresh from signing a new five-year deal with the Club, and goalkeeper Harry Tyrer on the pitch.

The Toffees face Tottenham in London in their first Premier League game of the 2020-21 season on September 13.
