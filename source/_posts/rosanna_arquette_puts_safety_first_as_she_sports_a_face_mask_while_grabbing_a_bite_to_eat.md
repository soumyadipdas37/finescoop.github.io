She is a successful film and television actress with a career spanning more than 40 years.

And Rosanna Arquette cut a casual figure as she grabbed a bite to eat with a friend at Howdy's in Malibu on Tuesday.

The Pulp Fiction star, 61, opted for a laid back look for the outing, donning a white T-shirt with a Native American print.

The actress also sported a pair of black trousers with matching sandals and a black sun hat. 

Rosanna put safety first amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic as she donned a tie-dye face mask along with a pair of black gloves. 

The Desperately Seeking Susan star completed her look for the day by carrying a black handbag. 

Rosanna was one of the first women to call out film producer Harvey Weinstein on his predatory behaviour, an act which helped to spark the #MeToo movement.

Speaking in 2017, the actress said her career suffered after she rebuffed Weinstein's advances in the early 1990s as she claimed he tried to put her hand on his erect penis during a hotel meeting. 

Rosanna's Oscar-winning sister Patricia, who has been supportive of all the women who came forward, wrote about her sibling's bravery at the time.

'I am very proud of my sister @RoArquette and all the women and men & police who spoke up in this article,' she wrote.

In the wake of telling her story, Rosanna told Variety of the backlash she faced after speaking out, admitting that things had not got better since coming forward.

She explained: 'I don’t have an agent, so. I think there’s backlash for sure. There’s a lot of people that made a lot of money from him, and continue to.

'There’s a boys club that protects the boys. He’s just one of many men, as we’re seeing more and more men being exposed for their awful behaviour and their abuse of power.

'I think Hollywood keeps looking at their watches like, "When is this gonna end?" And it’s not. It’s not going to end until people stop this bad behaviour.'
