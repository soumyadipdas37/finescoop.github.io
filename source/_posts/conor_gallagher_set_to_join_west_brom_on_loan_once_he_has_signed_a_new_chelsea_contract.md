Conor Gallagher is poised to join West Brom from Chelsea on a season’s loan following a series of phone calls between Slaven Bilic and Frank Lampard.

As reported by Sportsmail last Thursday, the 20-year-old midfielder was prominent on Albion’s radar in the build-up to the new campaign and Albion manager Bilic’s relationship with Blues boss Lampard – the pair were team-mates at West Ham in 1996-97 – helped tip the balance in West Brom’s favour.

Bilic and Lampard are believed to spoken three times last week about Gallagher, who is expected to sign a new deal with the Blues before completing his switch.

Gallagher, who had also attracted attention from Crystal Palace and Leeds, could make his Baggies debut at Everton on Saturday.

Bilic remains desperate for Albion to make more signings ahead of the window closing next month, and he hopes to seal the capture of former Chelsea centre-back Branislav Ivanovic on a free transfer.

The Croatian would also like a pacy centre-forward although Albion’s attempts to sign Karlan Grant from Huddersfield have so far been frustrated by the Championship club’s £17million asking price.

Gallagher has never played in the Premier League but was impressive on loan at Charlton and Swansea last term.

His versatility should also come in useful to Albion, who went into the opening game of the campaign with a squad that was barely stronger than the one promoted from the Championship at the end of July. They were beaten 3-0 at home by Leicester.

Albion have secured permanent deals for three of last season’s four loan stars, Grady Diangana, Matheus Pereira and Callum Robinson. But a move for a fourth, Filip Krovinovic, is currently stalling over the terms of his proposed loan deal from Benfica.
