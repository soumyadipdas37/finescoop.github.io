Four men are at the centre of a police hunt today after a gang punched and stamped on a man who died in hospital two weeks later.

Victim Simon Whisker, 40, had to be rushed to hospital where he died 12 days after he was punched by four men on London Road in Croydon on July 1. 

Detectives have released images and CCTV of four men they would like to speak to in connection with the incident. 

Mr Whisker was involved in a fight with a group who knocked him to the ground with a series of violent punches before stamping on him.

He was taken to hospital, treated and discharged but almost two weeks later he died in the early hours of July 13.

The case is not being treated as a murder inquiry, detectives revealed.

Extensive enquires have been carried out by detectives from the South Area Command Unit but so far there have been no arrests. 

Enquiries to establish the circumstances continue.

'We are not treating this as a murder inquiry at this time. We just want to find out who was responsible for the attack on Simon.

'I am asking the public to contact us if they recognise any of these males.'
