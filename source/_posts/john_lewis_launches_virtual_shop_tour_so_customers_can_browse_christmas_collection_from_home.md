For many, the thought of battling crowds to do the Christmas shopping will put plans of an annual festive trip into jeopardy. 

But John Lewis has launched an online feature that means customers can 'visit' its Oxford Street department store without leaving their sofa. 

The retailer has released a virtual tour of the festive pop-up on its website, allowing shoppers to 'walk' through the space and admire the displays of festive table settings and twinkling Christmas trees. 

In the virtual tour (pictured), the flagship shop boasts the largest ever Christmas Tree forest, showcasing seven new festive trends and room sets as well as a one stop gift emporium

When it comes time to buy, there is the option of clicking on individual products or sections, which leads customers to the corresponding section of its online shop - and the item can be purchased in just a few clicks. 

Dan Cooper, partner and head of Christmas at John Lewis & Partners said: 'We know that Christmas might look a little different to our customers this year, with smaller celebrations at home and video calls to loved ones. 

'But we also know that many are looking forward to the small joys that the festive season brings: from decorated fireplaces to wreaths on doors.

'This year we have created a Christmas shop that will of course delight and inspire our customers but we have also focused on making it a simple journey that means they can tick off their list happily and safely.' 

Using a computer, smartphone or tablet, people can take a virtual stroll through the shop, clicking through the steps in the virtual shop to see this year's Christmas themes brought to life

The measure has been introduced as high street retailers brace for a different - and challenging - festive season, with questions over how many shoppers will be willing to venture out to usually busy high streets. 

John Lewis has reported an earlier than usual interest in Christmas shopping, with festive sales up by 112 per cent compared to the same period in 2019. 

The retailer will be hoping Christmas will be a time to reverse its fortunes. 

Earlier this month John Lewis axed its staff bonus for the first time since 1953 after losing £635million in six months and closing eight stores. 

The group said it plunged to the pre-tax loss for the half year ended July 25 after being impacted by a £470million write-down on its stores.  

 Those wishing to browse all that is on offer at the flagship store customers can pick up their computers, smartphones or tablets and take a look without even leaving the house
