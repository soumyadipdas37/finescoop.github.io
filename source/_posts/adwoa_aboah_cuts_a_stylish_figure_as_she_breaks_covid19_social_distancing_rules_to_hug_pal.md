The catwalk model seemed in high spirits as she greeted a pal with an elbow bump before flouting the current guidelines with a swift embrace. 

Despite her confident and relaxed demeanour, Adwoa recently discussed her insecurities in social situations and and asserted that she felt she 'wasn't white enough, nor Black enough' during her teenage years.

As she graced the September 2020 cover of ELLE magazine, Adwoa confessed to the publication: 'I'd watch from the sidelines as certain friends flourished in social situations, all carefree and glowing, while I quietly hid my insecurities and internalised my shame.

'I, like many others before and after me, never felt as though I fit in. I wasn't white enough, nor was I Black enough. Boys weren't into my braids, so I conformed – painfully relaxing my hair, which didn't win them over either.'  

On her experience at school, she admitted her strong desire to 'be like everyone else' but failed many exams.

She wrote: 'According to school standards, I wasn't academically strong, pressure that was only made worse by my dyslexia and the multitude of exams I failed'

Adwoa said she wanted to 'conform to be like everyone else', which, ironically, would 'be a massive detriment to my career today', but at the time was her 'deepest fantasy'.
