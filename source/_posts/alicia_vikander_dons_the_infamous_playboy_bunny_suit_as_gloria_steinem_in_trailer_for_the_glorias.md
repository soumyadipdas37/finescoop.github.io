Oscar winner Alicia Vikander donned the infamous Playboy Bunny suit as feminist icon Gloria Steinem in the second trailer for Julie Taymor's biopic The Glorias, which dropped on Monday.

The 86-year-old women's rights activist went undercover at the New York Playboy Club to detail how employees were exploited and mistreated in an article for Huntington Hartford's Show magazine back in 1963.

'We get a pay cut if you don't smile,' she said in the preview, suggesting they 'join a union.'

'If you don't fit into your costume. Or if you don't do the Bunny dip while serving.'

Upon the publication of Steinem's article 'A Bunny's Tale,' a chauvinistic male colleague quipped: 'How about next time going undercover in the porno business?'

The Swedish 31-year-old portrays Gloria from ages 20–40 when she co-founded Ms. magazine with Dorothy Pitman Hughes, played by R&B songstress Janelle Monáe (Harriet, Hidden Figures).

Fans get to see how Steinem selected her iconic glasses despite being told of the specs: 'Those are too big they hide your beautiful face.'

Oscar winner Julianne Moore portrays Gloria after age 40 when she helped campaign for the Equal Rights Amendment and headed up the historic 1977 National Women's Conference.

The story, based on Steinem's 2015 memoir My Life on the Road, depicts surreal scenes where all four Glorias - including Lulu Wilson and Ryan Kira Armstrong - all interact on screen at once.

The Glorias features the legendary Bette Midler - who's only an Oscar away from EGOT status - as New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug, who co-founded the National Women's Political Caucus with Steinem.

Julianne revealed: 'She did [come to the set]. She was there during rehearsal and stuff. Oh [it was] terrifying. Julie [Taymor] asked me too. "What do you think about her being on set?" I'm like, "Just don't tell me when she's watching. I don't want to know." She's incredible, so generous'

'She was there but there were a lot of us there. And then there was a play based on the book too and I went to the play. And she came out at the end for a talkback and on her way by she waved. I was like oh my god! She said hi to me!
