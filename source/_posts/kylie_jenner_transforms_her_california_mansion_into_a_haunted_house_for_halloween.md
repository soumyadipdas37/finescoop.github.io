The Kardashian-Jenner clan notoriously go all out for a holiday.

The star gave her Instagram followers a tour as her team completed work on the spooky makeover, with her daughter Stormi, two, getting equally excited by the decor.

'We are in full Halloween mode, setting up all these cute little things,' Kylie told her fans.

She first showed off her living room with candles and spooky trinkets decorating the tables and book shelves. 

Two creepy witch statues also stood in one corner to greet the star's guests. 

Next up was a peek outside, with Kylie's back yard covered with a huge orange light installation.

Stormi was excited to see the twinkling lights covering the garden greenery, running around in the cute video as her mom followed.

Kylie's outdoor firepit was lit to add to the ambience as she showed off two huge mummy figures guarding a doorway back into the house.

Into the kitchen, and Kylie already had her trick or treat goodies ready with iced biscuits and bowls of candy laid out on the counter.

The 23-year-old moved into a new £29m mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, during the coronavirus lockdown and has wasted no time in getting settled in with Stormi. 

The huge home boasts seven bedrooms and 14 bathroom, as well as a bar and games room, and a home cinema.

Outside there is a tennis court an an outdoor projection screen while two lavish guest apartments are also on the estate, perfect for the star's extended family to visit.

Kylie - who has topped Forbes' list of youngest self-made billionaires for the past two years - bought the 15,350 square feet pad in April. 

It's unclear if Kylie will be completely ditching her Hidden Hills digs, a neighborhood her family and friends have colonized throughout the years.

The social media sensation picked up her current property in 2016 for $12million.

The mansion sprawls over 13,200 square feet, according to real estate site Trulia.
