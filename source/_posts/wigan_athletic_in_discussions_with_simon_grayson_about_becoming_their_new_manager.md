Wigan AthleticÂ are in discussions with Simon Grayson over becoming their new manager.

The 50-year old is wanted by the club's administrators to provide more experience ahead of caretaker Leam Richardson, who has welcomed the move. It was hoped he would be in charge for their League One opener with Ipswich Town on Sunday but he has asked for more time to consider the realms of the job before taking up the reins. It is understood Grayson may prefer the role of consultant while the club remains in a state of flux.

Grayson was previously in charge at Sunderland and Blackpool and knows administrator Gerald Krasner from his time at Leeds United.

The club's squad has been decimated by key player sales since the end of last season which also saw a frustrated Paul Cook leave as manager.

And Grayson's task could be all the greater after Middlesbrough made a move for Wigan's captain Sam Morsy.

The 29-year-old played 40 times in the Championship last season and was instrumental in the club's push up the table before they went into administration.

Morsy was not in the squad for Wigan's Carabao Cup defeat at Fleetwood on Saturday with the possibility of a move happening. It's unlikely Wigan will accept Boro's opening offer but talks are ongoing for the Egypt international.

Middlesbrough, meanwhile, signed goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli on loan from Fulham yesterday and are close to agreeing a contract with former Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo on a free.
