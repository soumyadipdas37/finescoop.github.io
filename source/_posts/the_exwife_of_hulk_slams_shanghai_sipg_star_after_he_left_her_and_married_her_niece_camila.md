Hulk's ex-wife has slammed her niece who married the Brazil star after he had left her, claiming she has 'had to bury a daughter while she is still alive'.

The 34-year-old is thought to have split from wife Iran Angelo de Souza in the summer of last year before announcing he was dating her niece Camila just a few months later.

But speaking to Portuguese outlet Record recently, Iran criticised Camila and claimed she sacrificed everything for a girl who has now eternally and irreparably damaged her feelings by marrying the forward herself.

The Shanghai forward has also changed the biography on his social media to 'married'

'I wake up and go to sleep without understanding why everything happened to me,' Iran told Record via MARCA.

'The pain is very great, sometimes I think it will tear my heart out. She was a daughter to me. 

'I gave everything to this girl since she came into the world. I sacrificed my dreams so many times to make her dreams come true. And here I am not just talking about material goods, because these are easy to give when you have money, but love, affection, attention, respect ... everything. 

'She knew my weaknesses, insecurities, pains, fears and had my unconditional love. She managed my life, and for me everything what she said was good, it was correct, it was ethical. 

Hulk and Iran had three children together, Ian, James and Alice whilst they were married

The Shanghai SPIG star however ended the 12-year marriage with Iran in July 2019

'She was perfect in everything and I gave her the direction of my life. If I was wrong, my God, it was because I loved and trusted too much.' 

Shanghai SIPG forward Hulk - whose real name is Givanildo Vieira de Sousa - was married for 12 years to Iran. 

The couple had three children: Alice, Ian and Tiago, but despite admitting he was unfaithful during their marriage he denied cheating on Iran with Camila.

'I never had a relationship with Camila when I was married,' Hulk said on Instagram via Quem. 'I am a man. I was not happy in my marriage.

'I had countless reasons. I spent my entire marriage betraying Iran. She lived a single life. I just wanted to have the status of wife of the Hulk.

'Camila came to China. I don't think I'm an ugly person and I'm young. Camila is young and extremely beautiful. We ended up getting involved. We were single.

'We came back from China and told the family when you came back and you went to media. I have a clear conscience and peace. If you want to continue cursing me and treating me like a monster, the choice is yours. But criticize on top of the truth.'

He also accused Iran of telling lies before revealing he only stayed with her because she fell pregnant with their first child.

'I started dating and in less than a month you got pregnant. Ian, Tiago and Alice with the blessing of God,' he continued.

'My marriage didn't come out of love, out of passion, nothing, it was an accident that you got pregnant with Ian. And I took over.

'From the moment I started dating you, I started supporting you and your whole family. the whole Paraíba (state) knows that.'
