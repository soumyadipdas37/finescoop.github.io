She recently landed a singing role in an upcoming Christmas film.

And Caprice Bourret looked down in the dumps when she stepped out to grab a cup of coffee in London on Thursday.

The model, 48, opted for a laid back look for the day, donning a black hoodie along with a pair of matching leggings with a pink print.

In keeping with her athletic look, Caprice also wore a pair of black trainers and carried a matching bag with her.

Styling her platinum blonde locks into a ponytail, Caprice chatted on the phone as she strolled through the capital.

The former Dancing On Ice star appeared to go makeup free for the outing.  

It comes after Caprice will take on a singing role in the film, The Gift, for the first time since her lead in Rent on the West End and Debbie Does Dallas the Musical.

A source said: ‘Caprice has landed a leading role in an upcoming Christmas film called The Gift.

'She is really excited but also slightly nervous because she has a singing part. It is the first time she has sang in about 15 years, since her theatre days when she starred as the lead in Rent on the West End and Debbie Does Dallas the Musical.

'She actually has a good singing voice! She saw the final script today at a meeting with the director.

'Acting is something she wants to focus more on in the future and Caprice always tells pals that it is a great creative outlet for her.'

Caprice has spent lockdown at her London home with her millionaire husband, Ty Comfort, and six-year-old sons, Jett and Jax.

In June, she was shocked to learn that she tested negative for coronavirus antibodies, despite her family contracting the virus.

Caprice recently enjoyed a family getaway to Ibiza where she was seen showcasing her stunning figure in a collection of bikinis.
