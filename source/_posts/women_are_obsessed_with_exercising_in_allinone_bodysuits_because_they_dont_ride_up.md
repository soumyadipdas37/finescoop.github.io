Australian activewear brands are curating all-in-one workout bodysuits for their customers, which promise to mould perfectly to a woman's curves.

The fashion trend, which has seen muted all black tones being sold alongside vivid neons, claims to be more efficient for certain types of exercises - like HIIT - because loose clothing doesn't get in the way.

Instead women are bringing understated style to the gym floor or Pilates studio, with open backs and cross straps helping you feel supported and cool even when the workout involves jumping or running.

Alicia Superina, founder of Solo the Staple, has spearheaded the look Down Under with her range of sleek silhouettes. 

'I love HIIT training and reformer Pilates and the effect that these disciplines have on my body and mind,' she wrote on her website.

'However, what I didn't love was my activewear: leggings designed for running, sports bra and a tank top that always got in the way. I was constantly tucking in or readjusting.'

After two years of research Alicia launched her brand on Valentine's Day in 2020, with a collection of highly practical $180 bodysuits - and they have been selling out ever since.

'These are perfect for dancing. No fabric holding me back,' one Solo the Staple customer wrote on Instagram

It's a similar success story for Paris and Samantha, the duo behind activewear brand Paris and I, who created a range of 'luxe bodysuits' which are biker short length in June 2019.

The $129.99 moisture wicking suits are super stretchy with a 'scrunch' design around the bottom area to accentuate your glutes.

In a recent post on Instagram the ladies drew attention to a number of 'copy cat' brands making cheaper copies of their ensembles, minus the good quality fabric.

Pip Edwards' Bondi label P.E Nation created the $220 Drive Force Catsuit complete with a v-neck in honour of the trend, and has sold out in size extra large.

'In a form fitting shape, this performance catsuit features a hidden shelf bra for extra support with adjustable shoulder straps and a criss-cross back,' the website read.

'The one-piece features ribbed panelling for further support throughout the legs, with sand colour piping detail and a P.E Nation flat rubber print on the side leg.'  

Running Bare has similarly jumped on the movement with the $139.99 Lotus Medusa Catsuit which has 'no uncomfortable hemlines, tops that ride up' or ill-matching coordinate separates.

While it's certainly a bold look in comparison to the average t-shirt and leggings combination, the benefit of simply having to wash one item of clothing before hitting the gym again is a major plus. 

'These are perfect for dancing. No fabric holding me back,' one Solo the Staple customer wrote on Instagram.

'It fits like a glove. I couldn't be more impressed with my bodysuit,' said another.

A third added: 'I'm a 12-14 with a booty and bust and love it. No hitching up pants or muffin top so it gives a lot more freedom and confidence'.
