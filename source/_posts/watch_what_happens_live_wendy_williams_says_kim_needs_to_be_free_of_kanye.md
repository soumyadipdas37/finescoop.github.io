The future is looking bleak for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's marriage, according to a prediction made by Wendy Williams.

The 56-year-old daytime darling gave her unfiltered thoughts about Kim and Kanye's relationship while chatting with Andy Cohen on the Watch What Happens Live After Show on Sunday night.

Williams thinks the couple should split up 'sooner than later' adding that Kim 'needs to be free' of her husband and able to get back into the dating realm.

During her appearance on WWHL earlier in the evening Wendy had said she 'expects' the couple will put an end to their marriage and Andy followed up on her prediction asking when she thinks it will happen. 

The talk show host quipped in response: 'Sooner than later, hopefully.' 'Why do you say hopefully?' Cohen wanted to know.

'She needs to be free,' Wendy explained of the 39-year-old mogul. 'She needs to be free to date. She can’t be caught out there dating other men and cheating and things like that.'

'They can’t have an open relationship. That seems like a nice thought but, you know, they can't have an open relationship,' she continued. 'They’ve got four children and I bet you she spends all of her time with them as opposed to him.'

'She needs to be free,' Wendy explained. 'She needs to be free to date. She can’t be caught out there dating other men and cheating and things like that. They can’t have an open relationship. That seems like a nice thought but, you know, they can't have an open relationship.'

'I know she still works but, you know, she’s the primary parent and he’s off in Wyoming making music and clothing and trying to figure out his life. And urinating on Grammys. Just saying,' Wendy added.

As just one example of the 43-year-old rapper's recent erratic behavior, Wendy was referencing a social media video the rapper shared earlier this month of himself seemingly urinating on one of his Grammy Award statutes in a toilet.

Earlier in the night Williams shared her thoughts on the imminent end of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Kanye running for US president during a segment titled Don't Mask Your Opinions.

Andy while wearing a green screen face mask with superimposed images asked Wendy for her opinion on KUWTK coming to an end.

'Good for them. They had a good run and now they can make all of their money with their social media followers and Kim definitely has got it in spades. She can slowly work on her divorce and life goes on,' Wendy responded.

Andy later asked for her response to Kanye running for US president.

'With the Birthday Party, are you part of that? No, Kanye, sit down and be well. Sit down, Kanye, and be well and figure out your life,' Wendy replied.

Kanye announced on July 4 on Twitter that he was running in the 2020 presidential election and told Forbes that he was campaigning as an independent under the Birthday Party 'because when we win, it's everybody's birthday'.

It was reported earlier this month that Kanye received assistance from Republican Party operatives to secure ballot access in some states and the rapper has not denied that he would be a spoiler candidate in the presidential election.

The Kardashians also announced earlier this month that the family reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians will come to an end in 2021 after 20 seasons.

Wendy earlier was asked by a virtual audience member to give details about her 'new man on Instagram'.

'I haven't been seeing a new man on Instagram. I've been showing you pictures of me with friends and when I do find the man-man, he will not be on my Instagram. That is one thing I will not be doing,' Wendy said.

Wendy also admitted that she 'can't wait to get back to dating I will not lie about it.'

Another virtual audience member asked if she ever regretted anything that she said on The Wendy Williams Show.

Just friends: 'I haven't been seeing a new man on Instagram. I've been showing you pictures of me with friends and when I do find the man-man, he will not be on my Instagram. That is one thing I will not be doing,' Wendy said

'No regrets,' replied Wendy.

Wendy filed for divorce in April 2019 from her second husband Kevin Hunter after it was reported that he fathered a child with another woman and their divorce was finalized in January 2020.

Season 12 of The Wendy Williams Show premiered on September 21.
