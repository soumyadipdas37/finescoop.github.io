He's the Australian actor known for his rugged movie star looks.

And it seems that Joel Edgerton has had a bit of a slim down of late. 

The 46-year-old was spotted going for a surf in Sydney's Bondi on Tuesday, showing off his new ripped abs and toned physique.

The Great Gatsby star showed off his new look as he stripped off his wetsuit after a surf. 

He showed off his washboard abs as he changed into a sports jacket for the drive back home. 

Joel, who is dating Australian fashion editior Christine Centenera, also sported a scruffy beard.

It remains unclear if Joel has shaped up while in lockdown for an overall health kick, or if he's preparing for a new role. 

It comes after Joel candidly revealed his battle with anxiety last month. 

The notoriously private actor opened up about the condition, which has affected him from his 20s, while speaking to the ABC's Australian Story.

Joel said his battle with anxiety has left him 'terrified' of attending his own red carpet film premieres. 

'I'm someone who suffers from anxiety and I know most of the time it is pretty mild for me,' the 46-year-old revealed.

'A lot of that... had to do with being scrutinised and not handling it well and not handling big crowds very well,' he added.

Joel further admitted that it meant he didn't always cope well at glitzy Hollywood premieres.

'Just going to the premiere of a movie and I know everyone thinks this is glamorous, but it's sort of terrifying,' he revealed.

Despite his struggle, the Boy Erased star admitted he believes his anxiety helped him land his first on-screen gig in the hit 90s drama Police Rescue.

'I think I got the job on Police Rescue as my character was extremely panicked and anxious and that's how I felt going to the audition,' he said.

'So they probably thought I was just acting really well,' he added with a laugh.
