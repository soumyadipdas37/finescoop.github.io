Kathy Hilton is reportedly in talks to join the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills.

The socialite, 61, is said to have been approached by producers who want her to make regular appearances as a 'friend of the show'. 

Kathy, mother of Paris Hilton, 39, and Nicky Hilton Rothschild, 36, already has links to the popular series due to her sisters being Kyle Richards and former RHOBH star Kim.

According to TMZ, the mother-of-four 'hasn't made a decision' but is 'definitely interested' about the offer.

Kathy's sister Kyle, 51, is a series regular and has appeared on the show since series one, while her other sibling, Kim, 55, was a full-time member until series six but now makes brief appearances.

The socialite, married to Richard Hilton, 65, has made guest cameos on the show in the past.

MailOnline has contacted Kathy's representative for comment.

Series 11? The socialite, 61, is said to have been approached by producers who want her to make regular appearances as a 'friend of the show' (the series 10 cast pictured)

This isn't the first time Kathy has been rumoured to join the show and in 2019 her sister Kyle addressed reports she could be a series regular.

Kyle said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen after a fan asked if she would like Kathy to join: 'I would be happy; I've had one sister on, why not have another sister on?   

'My sister Kathy is actually — people don't know this — she is one of the funniest people there is. She's a practical joker and she's very, very funny. So I think she'd be an amazing housewife, actually.'

Earlier this month, Paris' heartbreaking film This Is Paris debuted on YouTube; the movie offered many new details about Paris' childhood. 

Future plans? According to TMZ, the mother-of-four 'hasn't made a decision' but is 'definitely interested' about the offer (pictured with husband Richard Hilton) 

On Monday Kathy's hotel heiress daughter Paris' documentary-style film This Is Paris debuted on YouTube; the movie offered many new details about her childhood. 

In the footage, Paris reveals she was sent off to a camp for troubled youth when she was 16-years-old.  

She ran away from several camps before landing at Provo Canyon School in Utah where she claims she was beaten, drugged and sent to solitary confinement. She was there for 11 months, only leaving when she turned 18-years-old.

When Paris talks this over with sister at the designer's New York home, Nicky reminds her that she did a lot of 'naughty' things in NYC at 16 to cause such serious action.

Nicky did not say what the naughty things were but she asks her sister if she ever apologised to their parents for her actions.

Paris does admit during the documentary that she constantly partied at nightclubs using her fake ID and she also cut school.

Meanwhile, her mother Kathy was hoping to make Paris into a debutante.

Paris is seen reliving the nightmare that was Provo and often cries in the documentary as her painful experiences have given her PTSD resulting in regular nightmares which has led to crippling insomnia.
