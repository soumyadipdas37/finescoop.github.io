Nothing says autumn quite like an influx of check coats and jumpers. Every year, in the lead up to October, the plaid brigade arrives, but this season it is more colourful than ever.

Thanks to the bright collections of high end brands such as Shrimps and Dries van Noten, the heritage pattern has filtered down to the High Street.

Keen on accessories? Try teaming an Alice band with a blazer.

Heading to a socially-distanced dinner? Pair ballet pumps with a pleat skirt and slouchy knit.

There is no such thing as too much tartan. It’s chic to be square.
