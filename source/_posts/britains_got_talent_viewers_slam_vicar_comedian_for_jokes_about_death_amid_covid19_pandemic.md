Britain's Got Talent viewers were left unimpressed when contestant Allan Finnegan made jokes about death during Saturday night's semi-final. 

The Scouse vicar drew ire from fans on social media after many thought some of his jokes were insensitive in the wake of people losing their lives amid the Covid-19 outbreak.

Allan often uses his job as a Baptist minister in his act and began his routine by joking about forgetting the name of a deceased person while at their funeral. 

Not happy: Britain's Got Talent viewers were left unimpressed when contestant Allan Finnegan made jokes about death during Saturday night's semi-final

He said: 'I forgot to put the deceased’s name down on my notes, I think it’s Hilda but I can’t be sure, the next minute it feels like a game of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?

'I'd have loved to have gone 50/50 or phone a friend – I am just glad it wasn’t Deal Or No Deal, I wasn’t going to open that box for no offer.'

He then made a joke about his only uncle passing away after he had picked his name in a family Secret Santa.

He said: 'Just before Christmas my only uncle passed away, God rest his soul and well… I had him in the Secret Santa so every cloud, saved me 20 quid that did.'

Routine: The Scouse vicar drew ire from fans on social media after many thought some of his jokes were insensitive in the wake of people losing their lives amid the Covid-19 outbreak 

Unimpressed viewers took to social media to react to his routine, with one writing: 'Joking about death during a pandemic! Tasteless!'

Another said: 'Don't find joking about death funny and especially in the current time.'

Another viewer added: '#BGT awkward as hell and not at all funny, a "comedian" joking about death in the current pandemic where so many people have lost loved ones.

'Very poor taste. Shame on the producers for allowing this @BGT'. 









Reaction: Unimpressed viewers took to social media to react to his routine, with one writing: 'Joking about death during a pandemic! Tasteless!' 

Allan's performance drew mixed reactions from the judges, with Ashley Banjo commenting: 'You had some good moments, but halfway through it lost me, I don't think it landed and hit as much as you wanted it to.'

David Walliams had a more positive reaction, saying: 'Good comedians need to be memorable and you're really memorable, you're Scouse and a man of the cloth, really liked that the jokes were about what you do.'   

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Britain's Got Talent for comment.  

Britain's Got Talent continues on Saturday September 19 on ITV.  

Response: David Walliams enjoyed his routine, saying: 'Good comedians need to be memorable and you're really memorable'
