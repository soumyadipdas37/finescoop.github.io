Taking to Instagram, other users have shared snaps of their indulgent dish, with many saying it's a great hangover cure or way to use up leftovers. 

To make the dish, Del revealed he lightly toasted two slices of thick bread and put it aside.

Next, he boiled cauliflower florets, drained them and set them aside before making a roux sauce with flour and butter.

Del then added milk to the mix and let the sauce thicken, before adding two tablespoons of mustard powder and a pinch on nutmeg.

Some instagram users have used crushed cauliflowers and cheese to make the dish more like a classic toast topping

To get the sauce cheesy, Del then mixed mozzarella and cheddar into the sauce and stirred.

After letting it sit for five minutes, he poured it on the uncooked side of the toast and baked it in the oven until golden. 

Many internet users praised Del's recipe, and said they'd be whipping up the dish soon. 

'Making cauliflower cheese this afternoon. On toast??!! I’ll try that tomorrow,' one excited Twitter user said.
