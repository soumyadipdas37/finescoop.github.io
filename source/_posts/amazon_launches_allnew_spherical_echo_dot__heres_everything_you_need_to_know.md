Listen up Amazon Alexa smart speaker fans! Amazon has introduced a new member to its Echo family, built with recycled materials and featuring low power mode, enhanced audio and fun spherical design.

Among the new slew of gadget releases from the mega-retailer are redesigned smart speakers, including the All-new Echo (£89.99), All-new Echo Dot (£49.99) and All-new Echo Dot with Clock (£59.99).

The next-generation Echo combines the best of Echo and Echo Plus into a single device at the same affordable Echo price. Its all-new design and fabric finish boasts a bright LED light ring at the base of the sphere for a smart, modern finish.

The new Echo also sounds significantly better; thanks to a 3.0-inch woofer, dual-firing tweeters, and Dolby processing that delivers stereo sound with clear highs, dynamic-mids, and deep bass.

Plus, for the first time, Echo also comes with a built-in smart home hub, with support for Zigbee, and it supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

Amazon's All-new Echo Dot features the same globe-like design and fabric finish as Echo, making it a stylish way to add Alexa to any space.

It's compact, but packs in a powerful 1.6-inch front-firing speaker, producing crisp vocals and balanced bass for full sound you can enjoy in any room of your home.

The new Echo Dot with Clock comes with the same enhancements like the new Echo Dot, plus a simple LED display so you can glance at the time, temperature, timers, and alarms.

And now, the tap-to-snooze feature that customers love on Echo Dot with clock will also be available on Echo Dot and Echo.

The new devices have been built with the planet in mind as they've been created with 100 per cent post-consumer recycled fabric, 100 per cent recycled die-cast aluminium and post-consumer recycled plastic.

Plus, all wood fibre-based materials used in Echo device packaging are made entirely from responsibly managed forests or recycled sources.

The All-new Echo (£89.99), All-new Echo Dot (£49.99) and All-new Echo Dot with Clock (£59.99) can be pre-ordered from Amazon, with the release date set for October 22, 2020.
