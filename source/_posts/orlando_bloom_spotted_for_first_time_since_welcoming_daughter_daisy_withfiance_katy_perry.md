Orlando Bloom recently became a father again, when fiancée Katy Perry gave birth to daughter Daisy last month.

And the British actor has finally come up for air, after enjoying some quality family time in isolation.

He cut a casual dad look Sunday, as he was spotted out for the first time since welcoming Daisy Dove, grabbing some takeout for his family in Santa Barbara.

The 43-year-old donned a long-sleeve grey Alpinestars shirt, black shorts, matching black flip flops and a grey bandana as a face mask.  

His outing came just one day after new mom Katy, 35, was spotted for first time since giving birth, as she enjoyed some retail therapy.

Orlando and Katy introduced their bundle of joy to the world on Wednesday, August 26 via Unicef, for whom they serve as Goodwill Ambassadors.

The humanitarian agency released a statement on behalf of the parents: 'We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter.

'But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was.'

The statement was posted to Unicef's Instagram, as well as Orlando and Katy's, accompanied with a sweet black-and-white photo of Daisy's hand holding mom and dad's fingers.

They used the opportunity to encourage donations to Unicef, adding: 'In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival. 

'By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your [heart emoji] can bloom with generosity.'

A source recently told ET Online that the happy couple 'can’t get enough of their daughter Daisy.'
