A former prison inmate has shared the horrific story of when he was allegedly groomed and raped by a guard at just 16 years old.  

Jamie, now 42, was placed in a New South Wales youth detention centre almost 30 years ago and said he was 'bullied' for his disability and unusual hair colour. 

The 42-year-old, who changed his name to avoid being identified, claimed one of the guards gave him extra cigarettes before repeatedly raping him for six months. 

Jamie has now filed a statement of claim with the NSW Supreme Court and shared gruesome details of the allegations for the first time, news.com.au reported.  

Jamie, 42, has filed a claim to the NSW Supreme Court (pictured) after he was allegedly groomed and raped by a NSW prison guard at 16-years-old in juvenile detention 

He claimed the guard 'took a liking' to him after he was 'bullied' (file image pictured). He claimed the guard gave him extra cigarettes before raping him over a six-month period

The 42-year-old said he was 'in juvie for mucking up' and quickly became an 'outcast' and a 'loner'. 

Jamie claimed one of the prison guards 'took a liking' to him and began giving him more than the permitted six cigarettes per day.    

'We'd get locked down at night and he'd come sit down and talk with me. That's when the abuse started.

'I kept it myself. Way back then, gay people used to get bashed. I was scared if I said anything it would end up bad for me,' Jamie explained.

The 42-year-old said he didn't speak up about the repeated abuse because the man who allegedly raped him told him not to. 

'He just said, "imagine if anybody found out" and "I wouldn't be here to protect you",' Jamie explained. 

Jamie also claimed the prison manager knew about the abuse and would taunt the then-16-year-old with questions and sly comments.  

The 42-year-old said the experience had left him struggling to hold down a job, with bad nightmares and a drug addiction.    

Jamie is suing for damages, interest and the costs associated with his life and after prison. His lawyers will meet with lawyers for the state of NSW on Thursday.

But his lawyer Sheree Buchanan, an abuse law specialist at Shine Lawyers, said a particular piece of legislation in NSW places victims at a disadvantage.  

The Civil Liability Act was amended in 2004 so people injured in custody must prove a 'permanent impairment' that is above a 15 per cent threshold to be compensated.  

Ms Buchanan said it was made to 'prevent fanciful claims' but it was 'offensive' to survivors of sexual abuse. 

Shine Lawyers wrote a letter to the NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman and asked for the legislation be amended in May. 

Mr Speakman told Daily Mail Australia the NSW Government 'acted swiftly to implement all of the civil justice recommendations of the Child Abuse Royal Commission'. 

When contacted by Shine Lawyers he 'sought urgent advice from the Department of Communities and Justice' and 'the Department is currently considering options for potential reform'.   

Lawyers for the State of NSW have filed documents to the Supreme Court that do not admit to Jamie's claims that he was abused in custody. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Shine Lawyers for comment.
