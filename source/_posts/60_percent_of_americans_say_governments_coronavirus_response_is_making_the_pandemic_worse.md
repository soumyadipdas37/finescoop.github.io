Sixty percent of Americans say the federal government's handling of the coronavirus crisis is making the pandemic worse, according to a new poll. 

An Axios-Ipsos poll found that 80 percent of Democrats believe the White House's response to the virus is making the country's recovery from the pandemic worse, and just 19 percent believe it is making it better.

Republicans, on the other hand, voiced their support for the White House and just 25 percent say its handling of the pandemic is making the country’s recovery worse. 

Meanwhile, 74 percent say the government is making recovery better.

Today there are more than 6million cases of the virus and over 183,000 deaths in the US.

Independents largely agree with Democrats with 68 percent saying the government isn’t helping.   

Trump has falsely insisted that the US has the world’s lowest mortality rate of the virus, but a new New York Times analysis released Tuesday revealed the US accounts for more than its population’s share of COVID-19 deaths.

The US accounts for four percent of the world’s population and for 22 percent of COVID-19 deaths, the report found.

According to Johns Hopkins data for the 20 top countries most affected by COVID-19, the US has the 11th lowest case-fatality ratio at three percent.

The US also has the most cases of infection and highest number of deaths from COVID-19 in the world. 

Axios-Ipsos started launching polls to measure American trust in the federal government in handling the virus in late March. 



Back then more than half of Americans said they trusted the government to look out for their best interests.   

This week that trust sits at just 32 percent. The index has been stuck in the low 30s for months as the pandemic wears on.  

The Trump administration has been heavily criticized for its handling of the virus. Trump has repeatedly insisted the US has the lowest mortality rate for the virus in the world, but experts say that's not true

The poll found that most Americans don’t trust President Donald Trump to give them accurate information regarding the virus.

The poll also showed that just 31 percent of Americans trust Trump for accurate COVID-19 information and 46 percent say they trust Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for accurate virus information.

Despite the lack of faith among Americans, the poll showed that 57 percent of Americans say they're somewhat or very hopeful the US will get the pandemic under control within the next six months. 

Meanwhile, 43 percent are not too hopeful or hopeful at all.  

The Axios-Ipsos poll surveyed 1,100 adults from August 28 to 31 with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.
