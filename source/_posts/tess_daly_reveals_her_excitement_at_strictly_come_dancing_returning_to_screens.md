Filming for the new series is reportedly scheduled to begin this week, with the professional dancers' group routines to be pre-recorded after they completed two weeks in isolation.

It comes after the news that Strictly has cancelled its annual Blackpool special due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A BBC spokesperson told MailOnline that the series will not 'physically' travel to the famous Tower Ballroom this November, but promised to celebrate the 'iconic' venue from their studio in Elstree, north London.

Strictly has introduced numerous measures and changes to ensure the safety of contestants and crew during the COVID-19 crisis, and has delayed its launch until late October.

In a statement the BBC spokesperson said; 'Blackpool is a milestone moment in every series of Strictly that our audience, our celebs and professional dancers look forward to.

'Whilst we'll be unable to physically go to Blackpool this series, we'll still be celebrating this iconic venue and bringing it to life from our studio in Elstree.'

Strictly usually travels to Blackpool for one weekend towards the middle of the series in November, with the remaining celebrity couples getting the chance to perform in the legendary Tower Ballroom. 

It comes following reports that this year's stars could undergo daily checks for COVID-19 during filming after a crew member tested positive.

Earlier this week, the hit BBC One dance show was said to be in a crisis following the news with 'everyone told to leave' and the set given a 'deep clean.'

A source told The Sun: 'Nothing is being left to chance after this positive test. A lot of money has been spent on ensuring everyone on the show has access to testing.

'If required, those taking part could even undergo daily checks to make sure they remain virus free.

'The key thing for producers is knowing that if a case emerges that they can react to it to make sure it doesn’t become a massive crisis.'

The source added that the 'nightmare scenario' is a case going 'undetected' and 'spreading' throughout both cast and crew.

The Sun has also claimed that bosses have a list of 'stand-by' celebrities for the show in case a star falls ill with relatives likely banned from rehearsals and no live studio audience allowed.

MailOnline contacted representatives for Strictly Come Dancing for comment at the time.
