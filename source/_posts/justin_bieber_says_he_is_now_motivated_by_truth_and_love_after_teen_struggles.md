'I come from a small town in Stratford Ontario Canada,' the Sorry hitmaker wrote. 'I didn't have material things and was never motivated by money or fame I just loved music.' 

'But as I became a teenager I let my insecurities and frustrations dictate what I put my value in,' he said of the young fame and success he achieved as a young teen. 

During the peak of his success Justin had many public experiences that caused an uproar, including being forced to leave a monkey in Germany after not having proper clearances to bring the animal back to the U.S. 

In January 2014, Bieber was arrested for alleged drunk driving and drag racing.

 'My values slowly started to change,' he said. 'I let ego and power takeover and my relationships suffered because of it.' 

Adding that now he truly desires 'healthy relationships,' and that he now wants 'to be motivated by truth and love.' 

'I want to be aware of my blind spots and learn from them,' he added. 'I want to be aware of my blind spots and learn from them.' 

'I want to walk in the plans god had for me and not try and do it on my own,' he wrote. 'I want to give up my selfish desires daily so I can be a good husband and future dad.'

In recent years, Justin has been more open his faith and last month shared photos being baptized with his wife Hailey.  

They were being baptized by pastor Judah Smith, who joined them on a boat to perform the ceremony in a lake.  

'The moment @haileybieber my wife and I got baptized together!' the devout Christian wrote to his 143million Instagram followers at the time. 'This was one of [the] most special moments of my life. Confessing our love and trust in Jesus publicly with our friends and family.'

Justin and Hailey decided to bath in God's glory. The couple got down to their swim attire for the religious rite, which was performed by pastor Smith.

Smith put his hand on Bieber's back to bless him before holding hands with the couple and praying to Christ.

Then, the man of God let Hailey and Justin float down and submerge themselves in the healing waters.

Justin was grateful to be able to have the experience with family and friends. 

E! host Jason Kennedy seemed to reveal that he was there, commenting: 'One of the top moments of my life doing this with you.' 

One of Justin's other spiritual mentors, pastor Carl Lentz, also commented, telling the Biebs: 'Amazing. love you.'

Justin's Idaho baptism with Hailey was very different from a previous blessing Carl performed upon him and later recounted to GQ.
