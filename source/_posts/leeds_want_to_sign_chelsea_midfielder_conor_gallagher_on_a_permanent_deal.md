Leeds United want to sign Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher on a permanent deal.

The 20-year-old is due to sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge before being allowed out on loan with a number of clubs pushing for his signature.

West Brom and Aston Villa have already pushed their claims to take the England U21 international for the season but Leeds have such faith Gallagher will fit into Marcelo Bielsa's style they are willing to buy him.

Chelsea are unlikely to agree to that though as manager Frank Lampard rates Gallagher highly.

Leeds recruitment has stalled recently amid rival interest in their targets, notably Udinese's Rodrigo de Paul and defender Josko Gvardiol from Dinamo Zagreb, whom Leeds agreed a Â£19m fee for.

They have explored alternatives with Liverpool's Harry Wilson, PSG's Julian Draxler and Barcelona's Rafinha among them.
