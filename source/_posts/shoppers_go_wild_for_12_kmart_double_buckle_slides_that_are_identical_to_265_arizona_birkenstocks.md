Bloggers are raving about $12 slip-on sandals from Kmart that are practically identical to a designer pair worth $265.

The 'Double Buckle Slides', which are available in black and white in women's sizes six to 11, are a carbon copy of the iconic 'Arizona' style from footwear label Birkenstock.

And with Kmart's discount dupe coming in a whopping $253 - or 22 times - cheaper, they are the obvious choice for cash-strapped Australian fashionistas in the midst of recession-proofing their finances.

The slides have received the seal of approval from leading influencers, with Melbourne stylist Maria - who posts on Instagram as 'The Budget Savvy Girl' - calling them her 'current obsession' and the 'most comfortable' she has ever owned.

Followers agreed, with many leaving comments praising the trendiness and affordability of the summery shoes.

'I'm wearing these today, so comfy. I love them,' one woman replied.

'Have these in white, can totally related to the obsession,' said a second, while a third called the slides 'such a bargain'.

The shoes are the latest piece of Kmart clothing to grab attention on social media, following a pair of stylish $22 trousers that look similar to a $1,390 pair from Italian luxury house, Bottega Veneta.

The sandals are also available in white with gold hardware, and come in women's sizes six to 11

The 'Tapered Leg Pants' have been flying out of stock since they were seen on Canberra fashion blogger 'This is Genevieve', who posted a series of outfit photos on Instagram featuring the bargain buy.

The pants - which come in beige and black and are available in sizes six to 20 - sit high on the waist and hang loose in a flattering cut that can be cuffed at the ankles, creating the illusion of longer legs.

Genevieve's followers couldn't believe the pants had come from the famously affordable retailer, with many noting the likeness to expensive pieces from designer labels.

'No WAY these are Kmart - I want!' one woman replied.

Another said the post had inspired her to buy beige trousers for the first time in years after almost a decade of shunning them for black.

Other gushing responses included 'wow, these are gorgeous', 'amazing!' and 'love'.
