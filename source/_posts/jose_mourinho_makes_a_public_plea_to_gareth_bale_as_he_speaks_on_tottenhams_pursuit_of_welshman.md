Jose Mourinho insists that it is 'no secret' that he tried to sign Gareth Bale when he was Real Madrid manager – but has refused to comment on the Welshman's proposed transfer to Tottenham.

Bale is on the cusp of sealing a sensational return to White Hart Lane and is currently in talks with Spurs over a loan move.

While a move appears to be imminent, Mourinho refused to be drawn in on the move before admitting that he has wanted to sign the 31-year-old in his previous job at the Bernabeu.

'Even before that, I tried to sign him for Real Madrid which was not possible to do during my time there,' Mourinho said in his Wednesday press conference. 'But the president followed my instinct and my knowledge and the season I left he brought Gareth to the club. 

'There is no secret on that. Even Gareth knows that. But I’m not going to speak about him anymore because he is a Real Madrid player.'
