The Royal Navy's new £3.1 billion aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth finally set sail from Portsmouth today to join a dozen US and UK F-35B stealth fighters for drills in the North Sea.

It comes after four postponements earlier this year due to a coronavirus outbreak among the crew and bad weather.

The Navy's 65,000-tonne warship sailed out in glorious sunshine on Monday to take part in a major exercise with the new RAF and USAF F-35B Lightning jets, seven other British vessels, an American destroyer and Dutch frigate.

The 900ft titan, one of two newly built carriers, was hauled out of the harbour by six super-powered tugs as hundreds lined the coast to watch her go.

HMS Queen Elizabeth departs from the Naval base on September 21, 2020 in Portsmouth, England. The £3 billion aircraft carrier was due to sail last week but was delayed due to high easterly winds

The colossal warship sets sail from Portsmouth today to head up to the North Sea for several weeks to be put through its paces with other vessels and fighter jets before it can get the war-ready seal of approval

The colossal machine of war heads out into the English Channel on Monday after it was postponed four times due to coronavirus and weather issues 

Big Lizzie and her 1,700 crew will travel to the North Sea for training with the new V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing) F-35 jets from the Dambusters squadron.

Big Lizzie and her 1,700 crew will travel to the North Sea for training with the new V/STOL (vertical and/or short take-off and landing) F-35 jets from the Dambusters squadron.

She will join a fleet of two Type 45 Daring-class destroyers also from Portsmouth, two Type 23 Duke-class frigates, a submarine, an American destroyer, Dutch frigate and two support vessels from the civilian-crewed Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

HMS Queen Elizabeth will be put through her paces for several weeks so that she can be declared fully fit for war later this year.

Her first operational deployment is scheduled for 2021. 

Two previous departures, one in April and the second in September, were cancelled after a small number of crew members tested positive for Covid-19. 

On the most recent occasion 'fewer than 10' were reportedly infected by the virus. 

HMS Queen Elizabeth is to join a task force of two Type 45 Daring-class destroyers also from Portsmouth, two Type 23 Duke-class frigates, a submarine, an American destroyer, Dutch frigate and two support vessels from the civilian-crewed Royal Fleet Auxiliary.
