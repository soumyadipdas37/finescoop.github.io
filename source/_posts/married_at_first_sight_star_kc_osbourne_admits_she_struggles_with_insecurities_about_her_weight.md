KC Osborne recently stunned in a lingerie campaign, and fans were quick to tell the reality star that she had a 'perfect body'.  

But the former Married At First sight star has opened up about her insecurities and pleaded with fans to not compare their figures to hers. 

Posting to Instagram on Wednesday, the 31-year-old explained that recently she lost 'too much weight' and has been working towards a 'healthy weight'. 

'No one is perfect!' On Wednesday, former Married At First Sight star KC Osborne (pictured)  told fans not to compare their bodies to hers - as she revealed she struggles with 'insecurities' 

'To all my girls that write to me about having the perfect body as much as I am flattered, it's not true,' she began. 

'The past few months I dropped 2 much weight and it was not intentional. I have been eating a lot more to get back to my healthy weight! I am also back dancing so my abs are looking solid.'

The dance instructor then pleaded with her 207,000 followers not to 'compare themselves' to people on Instagram and admitted that she also has 'insecurities' about her weight.

'As long as you are healthy it's honestly all that matters,' she added. 

'I am naturally very petite but when I drop weight I also have insecurities about my size... We are all born different shapes and sizes. 

She added: 'We have to embrace that. Eat well, do some exercise and do NOT compare on Instagram because no one is perfect.'

Last week, KC's ex, Michael Goonan, reflected on the couple's decision to end their relationship on the podcast Reality TV & Me.

He explained because of the lockdown restrictions in Melbourne, he and KC were constantly with each other and rarely had time apart. 

'Amplify that with lockdown, you develop a relationship a lot faster and you develop a lot stronger feelings than you would in a normal environment,' Michael said of his relationship with KC.
