The next series of Strictly Come Dancing, due to hit our TV screens in September, will be the 18th run of the UK’s favourite dance show. 

Only one professional dancer has appeared in every series and that’s the ever-popular Anton du Beke, who finished as runner-up last time out.

If you have always wanted to meet Anton and see him perform live, then this is your chance to join him and his long-term dance partner and fellow Strictly favourite Erin Boag – on an exclusive eight-day Danube river cruise.

On this cruise, guests will enjoy a guided tour of Budapest, pictured, and see other cities on the Danube 

You will be joined by Anton and Erin 

Anton du Beke and Erin Boag have danced together for 20 years and are two of the nation’s all-time favourite ballroom stars. Their charisma, chemistry and dazzling choreography have wowed audiences around the world. Anton, affectionately known as the ‘king of ballroom’, is the longest-serving professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing.
