Billy Crudup made his second jump to TV last year, receiving critical acclaim for his role in The Morning Show on Apple TV+.

And the New York-born actor's performance alongside Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon earned him his first Emmy nomination.

He seemed to encourage his young fans to vote Sunday, as he gave them a special shoutout in his acceptance speech for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

The 52-year-old said in his speech: 'This is a pretty incredible experience. Thanks a lot to the Academy. Obviously, the caliber of actors in the category... it's just some of the most esteemed actors that I'm familiar with, and have been for a long time.

'I knew the second I got this part that it was something to be fortunate about, so I tried to thank everyone who's been involved in this project and in my life, loving and supporting me already. 

'So, if I haven't thanked you, please call me and yell at me, because I've been meaning to. It has taken an army of support, and I am incredibly grateful.'

He continued: 'To the young people in my life, my glorious son Will, my nephews, Ash, all my godchildren... Please save us. Sorry to ask. But thanks in advance for all of your help.'

First nomination: It came after the New York-born actor nabbed his first ever Emmy nomination for his role in The Morning Show on Apple TV+

Stiff competition: Crudup beat out Nicholas Braun, Kieran Culkin, Giancarlo Esposito, Matthew Macfadyen, Bradley Whitford, Jeffrey Wright and his Morning Show costar Mark Duplass for the coveted gold statue

Crudup beat out Nicholas Braun, Kieran Culkin, Giancarlo Esposito, Matthew Macfadyen, Bradley Whitford, Jeffrey Wright and his Morning Show costar Mark Duplass for the coveted gold statue.

He stars in the show, which was renewed for season two in April, as Cory Ellison, a new executive looking to shake things up at a major news organization, which has recently become the subject of a #MeToo scandal. 

Costars Duplass, Aniston and Steve Carrel were also nominated, as was director Mimi Leder, but Crudup took home the show's only prize at the awards show, making it the series' first Emmy.

Crudup previously told IndieWire of his character: 'Part of the joy is I’m old enough to know a good character like that when I get it.'  

He added: 'I couldn’t understand him. It was so intoxicating. Something seemed familiar to me about this type of person, but at the same time it was impossible to know what could be motivating him. I wanted to figure it out by playing him. The allure was the mystery.'
