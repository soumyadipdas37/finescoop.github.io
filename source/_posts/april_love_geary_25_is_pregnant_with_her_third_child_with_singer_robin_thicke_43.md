April Love Geary is reportedly pregnant with her third child with 43-year-old fiance Robin Thicke.

The 25-year-old  star was last seen covering her midsection with her arms while in an oversized pink dress in Malibu on Saturday.

April gave birth for the first time in 2018, four-years after she began dating Thicke. 

Robin proposed to April in December of 2018, while she was pregnant with their second child, daughter Lola. 

Last week the IMG model fired back at baseless body shamers who have been openly criticizing the weight she has gained since giving birth to her daughters.

'Just letting you know that I'm not really bothered by all your guys' comments when you say I was 'so much more attractive' when I was skinnier,' began Geary, who posted the video to her Instagram Story.

'Because before having babies, I didn't have this fat a** and I am forever grateful for this baby weight,' concluded April, before zooming in on her filtered face.

In the video, April looked noticeably makeup-free and had her golden hair parted to one side.

Although she did not provide specific examples of the body shaming she has been receiving online, Geary made clear with her tone that the frequency of such comments is high.

Back in February, April caught some flack online after sharing a sultry Valentine's Day snapshot with her 173,000 Instagram followers.

In the photo, she posed with her pert derriere towards the camera, while donning a red satin bra and a thong. She posed next to Thicke and wrote: 'His main course.'

Keyboard warriors eagerly took to April's comment section to criticize the inappropriate nature of the picture and condemned her for setting a 'bad' example for her two daughters.

'They have girls no less. Sad thing is that she actually believes this is EMPOWERING. Quite the opposite. What this SCREAMS is 'I'm INSECURE!' Secure is when you don't have to prove it in PUBLIC,' wrote one especially irate commenter.

To which April replied: 'no this picture screams 'I'm in lingerie standing next to my fiancé.'  

In a recent interview with ET, Robin opened up about life in lockdown with his fiancee and their two daughters.

'I will never regret getting extra time with my kids. I am making the most of it,' the Blurred Lines singer said.

By strictly quarantining at their Malibu home, April has had plenty of time to snap and share photos of her family with her 173,000 followers on Instagram.
