They've been back to work on the soap with strict new social distancing rules.

And Coronation Street star Elle Mulvaney cut a casual figure as she strolled onto the set to film more scenes with some of the show's younger cast on Friday.

The actress - who plays teen Amy Barlow - opted for an oversized white denim jacket as she headed into Media City in Manchester to film the scenes.

Elle donned the white jacket with jeans and a black t-shirt as she played with her phone while walking to the set.

Also seen heading to filming was her co-star Alex Bain, who plays her cousin Simon Barlow on the soap.

The young actor - who recently found love again with a new girlfriend after splitting from the mother of his child Levi Selby - donned a black tracksuit with a gold Fendi-inspired print.

Elsewhere on-screen siblings Adam Hussain, 19, and Tanisha Gorey, 18, were seen arriving separately, as the soap ensures strict social distancing measures are followed during production.

The pair play twins Aadi and Asha Alahan, and have been recently been involved in a storyline which saw underage Asha embroiled in a 'sexting' scandal after sending a revealing image to her school crush.

Mollie Gallagher, 21, who plays Roy Cropper's niece Nina, was also focused on her phone as she arrived in an oversized pink jumper and sports leggings.

Joining her was Ruxandra Porojnicu, 26, who plays Alina Pop, as the cast headed back to set to film more scenes.

Meanwhile, this week sees Coronation Street return to its usual six episodes per week.

Despite not going off air during the coronavirus lockdown, the soap had to ration episodes to just three a week, while production was halted for several months.

But with filming having recently resumed, albeit with social distancing restrictions, fans will now have a more regular fix of the Manchester-based soap.

Coronation Street continues on Monday at 7:30pm and 8:30pm on ITV.
