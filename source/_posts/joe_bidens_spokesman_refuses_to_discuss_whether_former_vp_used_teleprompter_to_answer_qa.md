Joe Biden's spokesman called claims that the Democratic nominee used a teleprompter in a recent Q&A a 'distraction' by the Trump campaign.

The former vice president, 77, spoke with union members earlier this week and was filmed asking someone to 'move it up here' before answering a question.

Biden's national press secretary told Fox News last night that the suggestion was 'straight from the Trump campaign talking points.'

'And what it does, Bret, is it's trying to distract the American people from,' TJ Ducklo said before Bret Baier cut in.

Ducklo said that the issue was just another 'distraction' by the Trump campaign

'They (the Trump campaign) are using it, can you answer me yes or no?' Baier asked.

Ducklo replied: 'They talk about it every day, Bret, because they don't have a coherent strategy ... they talk about it every day because they don't have a coherent argument for why Donald Trump deserves reelection, deserves four more years.'

'We know that he lied to the American people. We know that he has not shown leadership during this crisis and they are desperate to throw anything they can against the wall to try to distract from that fact.'

Ducklo said he refused to respond to Trump campaign questions 'funnelled through Fox news.'

Biden's alleged use of the teleprompter in his Q&A with the AFL-CIO union members goes towards mounting evidence that he is in cognitive decline.

The Trump campaign has savaged Biden with adverts filled with the 'diminished' former VP's rambling answers to questions, one titled: 'What happened to Joe Biden?' aired last month.

Trump has tried to stir fears that 77-year-old Biden is not mentally fit for the White House and has boasted of his own cognitive powers - claiming he had dazzled doctors by reciting 'person, woman, man, camera, TV' in a memory test.

Biden has dismissed the issue and said he looks forward to going head-to-head with Trump in the fall election debates.
