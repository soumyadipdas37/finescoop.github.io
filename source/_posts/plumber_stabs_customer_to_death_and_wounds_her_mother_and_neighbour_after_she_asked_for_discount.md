The 43-year-old man, whose name has not been disclosed, is said to have stabbed paramedic Inna Murzaeva, 32, to death before badly injuring her mother and their male neighbour who had tried to protect the women.

The horrifying incident occurred in the city of Almaty, in the north-eastern part of the country, on September 4.

According to reports, Inna invited the plumber to her apartment after finding him online.

Negotiations between the two of them slipped into a quarrel after Inna asked the man to lower price for his service.

The plumber then badly injured the client's mother and their male neighbour who had tried to protect the women

When heated debates got out of hand, the plumber pulled a homemade knife from his pocket and attacked Inna and her 63-year-old mother, reports said.

The women's terrified screams alarmed a man living next door who immediately rushed for their help and was badly stabbed as well.

After turning the place into a slaughterhouse, the thug fled, covered with his victims' blood, and he was seen hurrying away by witnesses.

An eyewitness said to local media: 'The man was holding a homemade knife-like weapon with blood dripping from it. We called the police and an ambulance.'
