Pip Edwards showed off her shorter haircut during a game of tennis in Sydney's Bondi Beach on Thursday.

The P.E Nation co-founder, 40, proudly flaunted her new blonde bob, after recently lopping off several inches.

The activewear designer, who previously had a shoulder-skimming style, first showed off her trendy 'do on Instagram last week.

'This hair length! Love love love,' a friend commented on her Instagram post at the time.

Dressed in an all-black ensemble, Pip appeared focused on her game as she enjoyed a round of tennis.

She paired workout tights with a slogan T-shirt emblazoned with P.E Nation's logo in white lettering.

Pip also donned a pair of red, white and black sneakers, as she expertly swung her racket on the court.

Having a great time, Pip laughed in between hitting the ball while chatting with her opponent.

She also shared a photo of herself on the tennis court on Instagram, this time with her T-shirt off, showing off her P.E Nation sports bra.

'Ball girl. Thanks for running me all over the court today @jessengels,' she captioned the post.

Tennis appears to be a favourite sport for the star, and she regularly shares photos to Instagram of herself sweating it out on the court.

'Sports Nation. Find the sport that you love and one that makes you feel good!' she captioned one such post last month.
