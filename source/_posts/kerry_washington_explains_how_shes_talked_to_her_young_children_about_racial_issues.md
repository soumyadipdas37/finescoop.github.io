'In a lot of ways, I have to make sure that I am taking care of myself as I'm having these conversations,' said the actress, who portrayed Olivia Pope on the political drama Scandal. 'And, just on a daily basis, doing what I need to do to stay calm and to stay present and stay informed so that I can really be there for them as the world unfolds around them.'

The A-list actress said she continues to honor the memory of and seek justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT who was fatally shot March 13 by Louisville Metro police after they raided the wrong home.

'I wear the Breonna Taylor T-Shirt, you know, [that reads,] "Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor,"' said the Little Fires Everywhere start. 'So if I'm going to wear that, which I do proudly, I'd be ready to have that conversation in my house and answer those questions.'

Washington added that 'such a big part of it is knowing who your kid is and as you're having the conversation, like watching and listening for the cues to be present for this stuff.

Ellen told Washington, 'Good for you for continuing the conversation about Breonna Taylor because we can't stop that until they are arrested'

'A lot of us remember the moment in our own childhoods when we were first confronted with negative views about race with racism, with institutionalized racism.'

Ellen said in response, 'Good for you for continuing the conversation about Breonna Taylor because we can't stop that until they are arrested. It's crazy that they have not been arrested yet.'

Washington said that she and her spouse, a former All-Pro NFL defensive back for the NFL's Raiders, are also teaching their two kids about Black history and 'with a focus on Africa,' which is usually not in the traditional curriculum.

'I was walking them through lots of different African cultures,' she said. 'The Nubians, the Maasai warriors, Egyptian culture and just like scouring the internet for projects I could do with them and children's books about those cultures to really immerse them.'

'Our whole house has become a classroom, really,' Washington said. 'They both do online work with their classes, but I've also been really trying to use this time to teach them things that maybe not be on the curriculum.'

'A lot of times kids when they're learning about Black history in particular, you learn about Civil Rights and then Jim Crow era. You learn about all the things that Black people were told we couldn't do. 

She said she believed 'it was really important to kind of immerse them in the rich culture of who Black people are and were even before the Martin Luther Kings and the great, great civil rights leaders.'
