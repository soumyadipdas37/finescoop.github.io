Armie Hammer has put his historical Los Angeles mansion, located in the exclusive Hancock Park area, for $5.8M.

The grand home that has an Old World feel is an English Tudor-style mansion that was built in the 1920s when show business was in its early days in Southern California and Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks Sr were major stars.

The Social Network actor has listed the property just two months after announcing he is divorcing his wife Elizabeth Chambers with whom he has two children, Harper, aged five, and Ford, aged three.

A classic: The grand home that has an Old World feel is an English Tudor-style mansion that was built in the 1920s when show business was in its early days in Southern California. Here he is seen with estranged wife Elizabeth Chambers in 2018

The home has an impressive facade as it is three stories high and has many Tudor touches such as a red brick exterior and lead glass windows with pitched roofs.

He and his now estranged spouse bought the home in 2018 for $4.7M and is clearly looking to make a tidy profit.

The 6,275 square foot property has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms, and clearly has been nicely remodeled by the exes who lightened up the walls and made the home look overall more polished.

The entry way is meant to make a good impression as it has a long foyer and a wood staircase.

Calming quarters: The living room is inviting with wood floors and quaint French windows that hark back to another era and the fireplace adds another cozy touch

Old world with a modern touch: There are beams on the ceilings that are painted white with black accents as well

There is a roomy wood-paneled dining room that can seat 10 people at least.

The office could double as a comfortable library. A family room that is surrounded by French windows, service quarters, and a generous laundry room are also included.

The kitchen looks recently remodeled with white cabinets, dark gray quartz counters, French windows, an island with a sink and faucet, and wood floors.

In the front yard there is a gated that leads to the driveway that has mature trees on both sides providing privacy.

In the back yard there is a swimming pool and spa with plenty of room for outdoor entertaining.

Busy actor Armie and his stunning wife Elizabeth - who used to make for a power duo on the red carpet - announced their split in July.

'Thirteen years as best friends, soulmates, partners and then parents,' the pair wrote in identical statements in July.

'It has been an incredible journey, but together, we've decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage.'

Plenty of space for good dreams: One of the bedrooms has high ceilings, an ornate chandelier and pinks walls

A touch of a bygone era: The bathroom nicely has the old green tiles from the 1920s with double cabinets

Another old-fashioned touch: The bathtub is lined with beautiful tiles in black and dark green

'As we enter into this next chapter, our children and relationship as co-parents and dear friends will remain our priority,' they continued.

'We understand this news lends itself to public dialogue, but in the interest of our children and our family, we're asking for privacy, compassion and love during this time.'

Hammer has complete the movie Rebecca where he plays Maxim de Winter. He also has Death On The Nile in post production and Next Goal Wins.

He is on pre-production on his TV series Gaslit and he has been announced as the star of Find Me.

Plenty of room for a Hollywood soiree: The backyard has room for a living room area as well as a dining room table

Swim season: A large swimming pool with an adjacent hot tub is surrounded by flagstone and has a view of the back windows

It looks like paradise: The pool had large boulders with mini water falls that emptied out to the blue-bottom pool
