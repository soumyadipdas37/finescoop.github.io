The Duchess of Cambridge is known for her thrifty fashion sense - and it seems she is once again passing that lesson onto her children.

Kate, 38, who is a fan of recycling her favourite looks, dressed Prince Louis, two, in a blue jumper that belonged to his seven-year-old brother Prince George, when meeting with Sir David Attenborough at Kensington Palace, People reported.

The £65 knitted number by London-based Wild and Gorgeous was seen on George during his first tour of Canada with the Duke, 38, and Duchess of Cambridge, and their daughter Princess Charlotte, five, in 2016.

Kate is continuing the tradition of reusing her favourite children's clothes, with Princess Charlotte having previously sported her older brother's navy cardigan in 2018.

The mother-of-three, dressed in a £1,295 Gabriela Hearst denim shirt frock, completed Louis' ensemble with a pair of navy shorts and smart matching indigo socks.

Prince William, Kate and their children met with Sir David, 94, last week for a private screening of his new environmental documentary A Life On Our Planet in the Kensington Palace grounds.

While there was no official dress code for the occasion, it seems both the Cambridge family and Sir David decided blue was the colour for their meeting.

The family showed off their impressive outfit choices in two photographs released by the palace to mark the occasion, with the first showing Sir David as he met with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children. 

 Kate managed to perfectly coordinate her entire family's attire, with the Cambridges wearing an array of blue outfits as they met with Sir David Attenborough on Thursday (pictured)

Dressed in a dapper blue linen jacket and navy strides, the naturalist, who hit headlines recently after joining Instagram and amassing a million followers in just four hours, is seen standing a safe distance from the family who are gathered around a bench in their gardens. 

Meanwhile Kate is seen smiling in her on-trend denim shirt dress and £475 navy Rupert Sanderson pumps. Charlotte, five, meanwhile opted for a slate blue dress, with a pair of sky blue pumps.  

Gabriela Hearst is a label famed for their accessories, and has amassed a host of famous fans in the form of the Duchess of Sussex, Anne Hathaway and Oprah Winfrey. 

The Duchess of Cambridge's long-sleeved denim dress is Italian-made, 100% cotton and features a shirt style collar, front button closure and adjustable sleeve length.

It appears high-street brand Zara could be becoming a favourite of young royal Charlotte, who wore a £23 Zara floral Peter Pan collar dress for the meeting with Sir David and a pair of sky-blue laceless pumps.

Charlotte was seen donning the brand's sold-out houndstooth dress in May, which also featured the shop's distinctive ruffled collar.

Sir David gifted seven-year-old George a fossilised giant shark's tooth to mark their first meeting, after discovering how the young prince was such a fan. 

The Prince, who wore a £40 Trotters navy checked shirt - as did little brother Louis - and £50 Start-Rite school brogues, handled the giant tooth with evident amazement.

William laughed with the broadcaster while wearing a navy jumper and blue chinos underneath his grey blazer.

Kate recently revealed that her youngsters were 'massive fans' of Sir David, and were disappointed they didn’t get to meet the national treasure during their parents' catch up with him for ITV documentary, Prince William: A Planet For Us All.

William and the veteran broadcaster watched A Life On Our Planet, a revealing and powerful first-hand account in which Sir David reflects on both the defining moments of his life as a naturalist and the devastating changes he has witnessed.

Socially distanced in the open air, the Duke of Cambridge and Sir David were offered directors' chairs with their names printed on the back - but in a change of plan they sat in each other's seats.
