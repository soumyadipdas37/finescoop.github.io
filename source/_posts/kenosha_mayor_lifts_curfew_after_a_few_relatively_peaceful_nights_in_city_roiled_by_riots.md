Officials in Kenosha, Wisconsin, have lifted a curfew in the city that was roiled by a week of riots and unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.   

'After consulting with local law enforcement agencies, I have decided the curfew is no longer needed,' Mayor John Antaramian said in a statement Wednesday. 

'The last several nights have been relatively peaceful in the community, and in the judgment of law enforcement, it is appropriate to remove the curfew.'

But Antaramian warned that he would not hesitate to reinstate the curfew if more violence erupted in its absence, saying: 'Criminal activity will not be tolerated and arrests will be made if needed. 

'I am hopeful there will be no need to reinstate the curfew in the near future.'

Kenosha emerged as the latest flashpoint in a summer of US demonstrations against police brutality and racism after 29-year-old Blake was shot seven times in the back by police officers on August 23, leaving him paralyzed.

Kenosha emerged as the latest flashpoint in a summer of US demonstrations against police brutality and racism after 29-year-old Blake was shot seven times in the back by police officers on August 23.

Anger at Blake's shooting, captured on video that went viral, led to street skirmishes with protesters hurling firecrackers and bricks at police in riot gear who fired volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets. 

Protests devolving into violence left countless buildings burned, businesses looted and destroyed, cars charred and streets littered with debris. 

The situation escalated on August 25 when 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, who is white, opened fire on demonstrators with a semi-automatic rifle, killing two people and injuring a third.  

Officials instated the 7pm curfew the same day as the Rittenhouse shooting in an effort to curb the violence as more than 1,000 National Guard troops descended on the city. Those troops have not yet been withdrawn.

The move to lift the curfew, which was originally set to expire next week, came the day after President Donald Trump visited Kenosha and toured property damage on Tuesday (pictured)

The move to lift the curfew, which was originally set to expire next week, came the day after President Donald Trump visited Kenosha and toured property damage and held a roundtable discussion with law enforcement and local officials.  

Wisconsin's governor and Kenosha's mayor, both Democrats, had urged Trump not to visit because they feared it could exacerbate the unrest in the city. 

'While presidents are always welcome to come to this great city, this is not the best time for a visit,' Mayor Antaramian said in a statement Sunday. 

'We are hurting today and we are focused on healing, coming together as a community and rebuilding. There is a lot of listening we need to do in Kenosha and I worry that a visit from the president will delay this important work.' 

But the president ignored his plea and in the end concerns about stoking violence were not manifested.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden followed Trump's lead and is planning to visit Kenosha with his wife Jill on Thursday.  

The Biden campaign said that the former vice president will 'hold a community meeting in Kenosha to bring together Americans to heal and address the challenges we face.' Afterward, both Joe and Jill Biden will make a 'local stop.'  

Biden had hinted on Monday after delivering a speech in Pittsburgh that he was considering going to the Wisconsin city. 

His campaign has already reached out to Blake's family and plans to meet with them on Thursday during his visit. 

'Biden's contacted the family,' Jason Blake, Blake's uncle, told DailyMail.com. 'They've had a phone conversation with my brother. I'm sure they're going to make their way to meet with my family.'

'We want someone in the White House that will unite the whole country,' he added.

'We believe Biden is trying to united all Americans. I'm grateful to be able to meet him. I'm going to demand from him what we demand from anyone else - that there be legislation and laws protecting African Americans' safety and well being and that we have economic opportunity to build up our own communities.'

'We appreciate the manner and approach his campaign are taking,' he continued.

During his own visit to Kenosha on Tuesday, Trump did not meet with the Blake family, nor utter the paralyzed black man's name.  

During his roundtable discussion, Trump called rioters 'domestic terrorists' and suggested that white police officers who shoot or kill unarmed black people 'choked' or are 'bad apples,' refusing to believe there's a systemic problem between law enforcement and America's black community.   

'The vast and overwhelming majority of police officers are honorable, courageous and devoted public servants,' Trump said. 

'They're incredible, yet many politicians ignore their sacrifice and ignore the African-American, Hispanic-American victims,' the president continued, speaking of crime victims of color, not those who have been unarmed and shot by officers, which have inspired weeks of Black Lives Matter protests.

When asked specifically about Blake being shot Trump responded, 'I feel terrible for anybody who goes through that.' He added that it's a 'complicated subject.' 

Vouching for police officers Trump explained: 'you have people who choke.'    

'And if they make a wrong decision one way or the other, they're either dead or they're in big trouble,' Trump continued. 'And people have to understand that. They choke sometimes. And it's a very tough situation.' 

The president suggested that the police involved in the shootings and killings of unarmed black people amounted to some 'bad apples.' 

Trump pooh-poohed a reporter's question about whether he believed systemic racism existed, which has been the main theme of the Black Lives Matter movement. 

'You just keep getting back to the opposite subject,' Trump said. 'We should talk about the kind of violence we've seen in Portland and here and other places, it's tremendous violence.' 

'This is what this is all about,' Trump said.  

He laughed off the idea that most of the Black Lives Matter protests have been peaceable, pointing to the rubble he had just observed.  

'I keep hearing about peaceful protests ... and then I come to an area like this and the town is burned down,' Trump said, sassing at reporters in the room for covering the protests like that. 'By and large this is not peaceful protesting,' he later added.
