For the first time in nearly a century the iconic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will not be taking to the streets of New York City.

At a press conference on Monday Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the parade will be held virtually this year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 

'It will not be the same parade we're used to,' de Blasio said. '[Macy's is] reinventing the event for this moment in history. And you will be able to feel the spirit and the joy of that day.'

The parade will not be live this year but viewers can watch it online and on TV, the mayor said, adding that Macy's will release additional details soon.

He praised the retail giant for successfully adapting its Fourth of July fireworks display and expressed excitement for how it will reimagine the parade as well.  

'There are some things we still can't do,' de Blasio said in reference to the parade. 'We're looking forward to a lot of them coming back in 2021.'

Macy's addressed the upcoming changes in a post on its website, writing: 'Following our successful, safe and innovative production of Macy's 4th of July Fireworks®, it is our intention to similarly reimagine Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade this November.' 

This is a developing story.
