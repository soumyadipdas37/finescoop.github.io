She has a flair for fashion as well as her singing and performing skills.

And Ashley Roberts wore yet another stylish ensemble as she left her Heart FM radio duties in London on Wednesday.

The Pussycat Dolls star, 39, rocked a double denim ensemble as she exited the Global Studios in Leicester Square.

Ashley opted for a pair of high-waisted mom jeans with one leg a dark denim and the other lighter.

She teamed the item of clothing with a patchwork jacket, which had frayed detailing, and a stylish white T-shirt.

Ashley finished her look with large gold hoop earrings, brown Ray-Ban sunglasses and a Louis Vuitton graffiti-style handbag.

The singer styled her blonde locks into a sleek sweptback hairdo and added a slick of radiant make-up.

Ashley also took to her Instagram to show off her outfit as she posed with co-host Amanda Holden for some fun snaps.

Sitting on a staircase, the two stars folded their arms and posed up a storm as they hilariously joked about dropping a mix tape.

Ashley captioned the photos with: 'Mix tape drops tonight. DM for bookings #mashley #mashleysmixtape.'

Earlier this month, the star turned 39 and was spoilt with cakes, champagne and cards from her extended family at Heart Radio.

Ashley also enjoyed a lavish dinner at a Famiglia in Chelsea to mark the milestone.   

The media personality recently revealed she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future.

Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine in July, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption.

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

The blonde also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 30.

They called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018.

The TV star said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.'
