Selling Sunset star Amanza Smith has revealed she is back in touch with The Script's Danny O'Donoghue following their past whirlwind romance. 

Earlier this month, the real estate agent, 43, revealed she had enjoyed a short-lived 'rebound' relationship with the Irish musician, 39, following her divorce from NFL star Ralph Brown, 41. 

Discussing their past romance on Tuesday's This Morning, Amanza, admitted she was back in touch with Danny after contacting him on Instagram where they 'had a laugh'.

The reality star, who has two children Braker, eight, and Noah, 10, also admitted she was 'naive' to 'leak' news of their relationship in the first place. 

Amanza was joined by co-stars and best friends, Jason Oppenheim and Mary Fitzgerald, for the interview with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. 

The former model said: 'I was a bit naive... I did my first Irish press and I thought that would be a cute story. Months later now, it's followed me.

'I actually spoke to Danny a couple of days ago on Instagram, I let him know, "I don't know if you've seen this, but I just thought you should know I sort of leaked this to the press in your neck of the woods."

'We had a laugh, he was like, "It's all good, you gave me a 10/10, so..."' 

Earlier this month, Amanza shared news of her past romance with Danny on Irish programme, Six O'Clock Show, with Muireann O'Connell and Martin King.

She said: 'I had a whirlwind romance with one of your people right after my divorce I think. I was going through it, it was a rebound but no we had a lot of fun together actually.

'It was short lived because we live across the pond from one another and it was the first person I actually dated right after my divorce.

'So this was a long time ago, this was like eight years ago but he's an awesome guy and we had a lot of fun.'

She added: 'Look we had an amazing time, I thought I was in love and it ended about as quickly as it started. But I mean we would still be friends.

'Once in a blue moon he'll pop his head in and say, "What's up?" and you know ask how we're doing, ask how the kiddos are and stuff. 

'Yeah he's good, I'd give him a ten. You're welcome Danny.'

On series two and three of Selling Sunset, Amanza shared glimpses into her life as a single mother.

During the show, her ex Ralph went 'off the grid' and she applied for full custody of their children - Braker, eight, and Noah, 10.

Revealing why she chose to document that on the hit Netflix series, Amanza said: 'When I signed on to do Selling Sunset season two, my life was very different.

'The children's father was still very present in our lives, that wasn't the situation until less than a month into filming season two that all switched, so through filming season two you kind of see my fumbling a little bit through a hard time. 

Feud: Elsewhere during the interview, Mary spoke about her feud with co-star Christine Quinn

'After filming for several months and the situation hadn't changed it. I didn't know that was going to be the situation and I had to share that with the audience, otherwise I look like a bit flighty, late.

'It made sense to me to open up to the show and everybody to what I was dealing with behind-the-scenes. It was a natural thing, it wasn't like I made the decision, "Oh, let me share this with the world."'

Amanza also discussed being the 'new girl' in the office despite calling twins Jason and Brett, who run The Oppenheim Group, which sells multimillion dollar properties to the rich and famous of LA, and Mary her best friends.  

She said: 'I'm not really the new girl I'm the oldest in the office, and I've known Mary, Jason and Brett for about 19 years so I'm definitely the newest agent, but not at all the newest member of the family.'

Argument: In the second series, the two became embroiled in an argument after Mary suggested that Christine and her husband Christian Richard had started dating while he was still with his ex, something they both deny

While Christine also lashed out at Mary, 40, after she failed to invite co-worker Davina Potratz to her wedding to Romain Bonnet, 27.

Talking about the drama and her former BFF, Mary said: 'I would say it's arguing with the girls, I can't do conflict, and I think a lot has happened since the show started. It's kind of difficult for me.

'We had a conversation not too long ago and we're trying to get back on better terms we talked about what's happened in the past and we're just trying to get back to a better place.'

Talking about her husband Romain, who makes regular appearances on the show, she added: 'He's doing great, he's enjoying this whole thing our relationship is awesome, we actually just got back today from a little trip, so we're happy, we're good.'

Mary also dispelled any 'favouritism' in the office due to her past relationship with boss Jason.

She said: 'I wouldn't call it an affair, we had it a long time ago, there's no favouritism, anything I get I earn, and most of my clients I get from the girls. I don't get much from the show.'

Meanwhile, Jason, who is president of The Oppenheim Group, wanted to stress to fans that it took him years to secure big clients and commission.

He said: 'Real estate has been in our family for generations. After a few years of travelling and trying to figure out that we wanted to do, but it was real estate that we were most passionate about.'

'My concern is with people watching Selling Sunset is that they will just get their real estate licence and become millionaires.

'My first few years were really touch, I was at the corner of someone's office on a tiny desk making very little money for the first two-and-a-half years.'

During the show, they've had celebrity guest clients including Larsa Pippen and Queer Eye's Karamo Brown.

Discussing whether the clients want to be filmed, Jason said: 'It's really up to the client, if they don't want to be on camera they're not on camera, most of our clients are happy to be on camera, but we always defer to that.'

The most recent series, the third season, aired in August and it showed Chrishell Stause's shock split and divorce from husband Justin Hartley.

It also featured Christine's lavish wedding to Christian after the second series focused on their elaborate engagement party.    

 

Prior to their wedding, Richard, 41, who is said to have a net worth of $20 million and retired at 40 from the tech world, bought Christine her $5 million dream home for them to live in. It earned her a staggering $150,000 commission.
