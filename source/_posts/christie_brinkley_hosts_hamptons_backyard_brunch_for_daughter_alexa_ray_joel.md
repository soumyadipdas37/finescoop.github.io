Bellissima Prosecco brand ambassador Christie Brinkley hosted a backyard brunch at her Hamptons mansion on Tuesday for her eldest child Alexa Ray Joel and her longtime fiancé Ryan Gleason.

The Yahoo! cameras were rolling as the 65-year-old eighties supermodel prepared 'summery and delicious' recipes like watermelon cucumber salad with help from her 'talented' 39-year-old future son-in-law, who's a restaurateur.

Gleason and the 34-year-old singer got engaged way back on January 1, 2018 after a five-year romance, but COVID-19 has surely ruined any wedding plans.

'Yoo-hoo, I'm on Yahoo!' Bellissima Prosecco brand ambassador Christie Brinkley hosted a backyard brunch at her Hamptons mansion on Tuesday for her eldest child Alexa Ray Joel and her longtime fiancé Ryan Gleason

Alexa is Christie's only child from her nine-year marriage to five-time Grammy winner Billy Joel, which ended in 1994.

'Even if you can't get to the beach this summer, it's important to bloom where you're planted,' Brinkley (born Hudson) told Yahoo Life on Tuesday.

'Montauk is a gorgeous little beach town that sits all the way out on the tip of the island. It's one of my favorite places to sit and watch the sunset, sip a glass of wine and listen to great music. I heard John Legend play there last summer and it was epic.'
