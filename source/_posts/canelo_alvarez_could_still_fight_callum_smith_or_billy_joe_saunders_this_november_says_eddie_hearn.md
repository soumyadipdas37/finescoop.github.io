Eddie Hearn remains hopeful Canelo Alvarez could still face British world champions Callum Smith or Billy Joe Saunders this November despite the pound-for-pound star's messy legal situation with his promoters and broadcasters.

Canelo is currently at war with Golden Boy and DAZN after they failed to agree terms for his next fight and has subsequently filed a lawsuit alleging a breach of contract, seeking damages of at least $280million (£216m).

Sportsmail understands that DAZN had grew tired of Golden Boy's failure to deliver the trilogy fight with middleweight kingpin Gennady Golovkin and rejected a number of possible opponents put to them by the promotional company. 

Canelo Alvarez's next fight is shrouded in doubt amid legal dispute with Golden Boy and DAZN 

Eddie Hearn is hopeful Callum Smith (L) and Billy Joe Saunders (R) could still fight him this year

Smith and Saunders - who was due to fight Canelo before the coronavirus pandemic, and then ruled out a revised September date - were both mentioned to DAZN but negotiations never materialised.

Matchroom boss Hearn is confident that Canelo will return to the ring this year and believes a fight against either Smith or Saunders is still possible.

'We want to see him back in the ring particularly because the two fights there for him are Callum Smith and Billy Joe Saunders, two of our guys. I want them to have the opportunity to fight Canelo,' he told Sky Sports. 

'Hopefully it (legal dispute) gets resolved and we see Canelo back in the ring - he's one of the biggest stars in world boxing and is a terrific fighter.

Hearn expects pound-for-pound star Canelo to return to the ring at the end of this year

The Matchroom boss admitted a fight between Smith and Saunders can't happen without fans

'I think the plan is still for Canelo to box in November, or at least this year.

'If he does, I've got my fingers crossed they pick Callum or Billy.'

A Battle of Britain between Smith and Saunders has also been considered, but Hearn admits a fight of that magnitude cannot be staged behind closed doors.

He added: 'If Canelo doesn't pick them, they should fight each other. But if there's no fans, how do you do Smith vs Saunders?

'Right now it's about keeping the fighters active but also recognising some fighters are better for 2021.'
