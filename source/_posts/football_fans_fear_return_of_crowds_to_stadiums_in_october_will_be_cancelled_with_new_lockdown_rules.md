Football fans desperate for a return to normality could be made to wait even longer amid fears that plans to return to stadiums next month will be shelved by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

With coronavirus cases on the rise again in England, government officials are set to take action and impose tighter Covid-19 restrictions in a bid to prevent a second wave of infections across the country.

Social gatherings of more than six people is set to be banned in England from Monday which would likely see sporting events suffer a huge setback in getting fans back into stadiums.

Johnson announced in July that spectators would be able to attend live sporting events in person from October as the country edged towards a sense of normality.

However, new lockdown rules could put these plans on the back-burner on Wednesday afternoon, leaving sports supporters distraught at the thought.

One Twitter user questioned what would happen to smaller clubs if they will be made to wait for gate revenue once again.

The tweet read: 'Don’t think it’s looking good for fans getting back into football stadiums next month. I wonder if #CUFC will knock this weeks season ticket payments on the head. Really don’t know how some clubs are going to survive this. Grim.'

Another suggested that fans shouldn't be given hope of any sort of a return unless a vaccine has been found for the virus.

Twitter user @PiiaMay said: 'So the UK all in again for more restrictions? Yeah.. that's why Fans back in the stadiums won't happen there. That's why it shouldn't happen anywhere unless there's a vaccine. This virus is still out there and people act like it isn't.'

Up until this week, many sports, including football, have been holding test pilot events in an attempt to get fans back into grounds.

Brighton welcomed 2,500 fans into the Amex Stadium for their friendly with Chelsea last month, while sports like snooker and rugby have also had spectators attend.

Horse racing is also looking to make the transition back but will also likely be affected by the new rules.

The crowd pilot at Doncaster on Wednesday will still go ahead as normal where over 3,000 paying spectators will be allowed in to watch the action.

The intention has been to allow a small number of paying spectators into the racecourse every day of the meeting which culminates in the St Leger on Saturday when there would be a crowd of over 5,000.
