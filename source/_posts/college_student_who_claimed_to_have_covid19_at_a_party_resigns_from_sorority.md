A Texas Tech University student who was partying when she claimed to have coronavirus in a video that went viral last week has resigned from her sorority.

The video showed an unidentified female bragging about her party life despite testing positive for COVID. 

Since the incident, the university has launched an investigation into the video and her sorority, Alpha Phi, condemned her behavior.

'The behavior in that video is appalling. When chapter leadership learned of this member’s behavior, the chapter immediately initiated judicial proceedings. The member has since chosen to resign outright,' a sorority spokeswoman told KWTX.

The Office of the Dean of Students and Student Conduct shared in a tweet on September 6 that they were aware of the video and were addressing the matter

The spokeswoman said that the chapter will 'cooperate fully with university officials and do all we can to support contract tracing to protect other students and ensure any members who may have been exposed are quarantined immediately pursuant to our COVID protocols'.

The Office of the Dean of Students and Student Conduct shared in a tweet on September 6 that they were aware of the video and were addressing the matter.

A DailyMail.com request for comment to the university was not immediately returned on Monday.  

In the brief clip, the girl sits with friends and pans to show the party she's attending in what appears to be a yard. 

'Yes I have COVID, the whole f**king world has COVID,' she asserts in the clip. 'All of these people have COVID. So stop getting on my tip, stop getting on my tip. Like, I'm having a good time.'

It is unknown whether others in attendance at the party are affiliated.

On Monday, the university reported an additional 189 new cases. Of those new cases, 173 were students and 16 were employees. 

There are now 1,280 total confirmed cases. Of those, 1,152 are students and 128 are employees. No deaths have been reported.

In a letter released on September 8, Texas Tech’s President Lawrence Schovanec said that the university had been met with a series of 'challenges' since resuming classes.   

'The first two weeks of classes have presented its share of challenges. Our plans have been tested, but I am very proud of your resilience and your focus on the well-being of our students,' Schovanec said in the release.

'I know that further challenges await us as we continue to work through this pandemic. I am proud of our university community and the way you have supported one another. I deeply appreciate all that you are doing.'
