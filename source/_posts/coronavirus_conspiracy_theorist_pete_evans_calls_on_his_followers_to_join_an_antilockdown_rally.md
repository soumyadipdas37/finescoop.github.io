Celebrity chef and conspiracy theorist Pete Evans has encouraged his followers to attend a 'freedom day' protest to call for the end of coronavirus lockdown.

The dumped My Kitchen Rules host appeared in a promotional video for the nationwide rally, which is happening on Saturday.

'I invite everybody to stand tall and share their love,' Evans said.

Evans, who wore a Bunnings Warehouse cap, grinned to the camera while delivering his short message.

The video urges Australians to unite and stand up for 'freedom', against restrictions introduced to stop the spread of the virus.

More than 26,000 Australians have contracted COVID-19 and 737 people have died. 

'This is a scam and we all know it,' one woman says in the video. 

'This is a political agenda. We will make these bastards accountable.'

A man says: 'The evil has placed their cards on the table for everybody to see. The world has awoken.' 

A Facebook post for 'freedom day' said the Saturday event is 'Australia wide'.

'One day. One nation. The people unite and stand for our freedoms,' the post read.

'Let's make this a public holiday and day none of us will ever forget. The first annual freedom day.'

The Voice for Victoria post said Victorians should not attend the protest on Saturday as they were being 'set up' by the government.

'We have listened to the voices of our community who do not want this to go ahead,' the post said. 

'Victoria is being set up on Saturday, but when it comes to the rest of Australia, we need you to stand on the 5th.'

The post claims Premier Daniel Andrews would use the protest to justify an extension of Melbourne's Stage Four lockdown.

Victorian Police have vowed to stop protests from going ahead. 

'You can't ignore the reality you're in and give yourself a leave pass and go and do something that, in all likelihood, will contribute to the spread of this (virus),' Mr Andrews said.

'That's not safe, not smart, not lawful and Victoria Police will do whatever they have to do, within a framework of course, of being proportionate and fair.'

It comes after pregnant woman Zoe Lee Buhler was charged with incitement for creating a Facebook post about a rally in Ballarat. 

Evans shares dozens of posts, memes, and videos a week on social media denying the severity of coronavirus while hawking phony 'health' products. 

He has been widely criticised for falsely referring to the health crisis as a 'plandemic' orchestrated by government officials.
