Coleen Rooney was seen dashing out to pick up some essentials after it was claimed she wants a last minute exit from her libel court case against Rebekah Vardy.

The mother-of-four headed into Waitrose to pick up some bits and pieces in Cheshire on Wednesday.

She wore a simple white hooded sweater with black leggings and trainers as she headed back home, with her brunette locks worn down and straight. 

No diva: Coleen Rooney dashed out to pick up some essentials as it's claimed she 'wants a last-minute exit from her upcoming £1million libel court case against Rebekah Vardy'

All change: It's been reported that Coleen wants to end the £1 million High Court libel battle against Rebekah Vardy, set to take place from November (Vardy pictured in May 2019) 

She had a slight smile on her face as she made her way down the street in the wake of the latest updates about the case.  

It's been reported that Coleen wants to end the £1 million High Court libel battle against Rebekah Vardy, set to take place from November.

Sources claim those close to the wife of Derby County footballer Wayne Rooney, 34, have been encouraging her to settle their dispute privately, after her rival, 38, confirmed she is taking part in Dancing On Ice and has vowed to 'clear her name'. 





The pair have been at loggerheads ever since Coleen accused Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy's wife of leaking stories about her to the media last October - a claim she fiercely denies.  

An insider told The Sun: 'Things have gone much further than many had expected. 

'Coleen is a rather shy and private person, so the idea of having personal matters relating to her and Wayne raked over in court is something that fills her with dread.' 

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Coleen and Rebekah for further comment.

The new claims came after I'm A Celebrity star Becky addressed their highly-publicised feud on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain, when she also revealed she's set to take to the rink and appear on next year's edition of Dancing On Ice.

The reality star said: 'Look, we tried to sort things out amicably, it just didn't work. I understand people think it's ridiculous, but what was I meant to do? I need to clear my name. 

'I want to clear my name. I will do whatever that takes. I hope it's going to be resolved soon. It's just one of the things that has to go through the process unfortunately now.

'I found it really tough. But to be fair Piers, in comparison to what some people have gone through with COVID and things like that, it's incomparable.'

She added of her ITV stint: 'I'm so ready for the sequins and the full glam squad. After months of lockdown it'll be nice to get the glam on... I just think I want everyone to laugh at me really!

Rink ready: The brunette revealed she is due to start training for next year's Dancing On Ice 'in a couple of weeks'

'My dad taught me how to stand up on a pair of skates when I was about 7 years old, we used to go skating a lot when my mum and dad split up, we would go with him to the local ice rink. 

'I'm really excited actually. The only time I've been ice skating since is when we take our kids to the rink.' 

Asked whether her husband Jamie, 33, is excited to see her compete on the show, she added: 'He says he hopes I don't fall over too much so I hope I don't fall over too much!'

Rebekah added that she decided to sign up for the show as she wanted 'everyone to laugh at her,' and revealed she is due to start training 'in a couple of weeks.' 

The brunette explained: 'I'm really looking forward to getting my teeth into that and get going with it. I'm going to give 100 per cent effort throughout. And I hopefully won't knock my Shergar teeth out.'

According to The Mirror, Coleen and Rebekah will face off in November – just over one year after the former accused the latter of leaking stories about her.  

Rebekah is seeking substantial damages in the subsequent libel trial, as she claims to have suffered 'severe and extreme hostility and abuse' in the fallout after the claims were published on Instagram. 

The Mirror reports that judge Mr. Justice Nicklin has stated a preliminary trial will decide the 'natural and ordinary' meaning of Coleen’s social media posts.

He has also given Coleen until October 2 to serve a 'statement of case'.

In the September 17 court order he stated: 'It is ordered by consent that there be a trial of the preliminary issue of the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of.'

The half-day trial, he has stated, would be heard by a judge specialising in media and communication after November 15.

As of September 25 Coleen had yet to file a defense, though it has been revealed by the judge that she isn't obliged to do so until 28 days after the preliminary hearing.

The full statement: Coleen's very public feud began when she accused Rebekah of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies

Court costs are expected to stay under £25,000 on each side, according to the publication, with any party exceeding the limit being required to justify them. 

It has since been claimed that Coleen wants to undertake 'forensic analysis' of Rebekah's electronics to look for evidence, according to a report from The Sun.

A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'Coleen met with her lawyers and they've told her they need to continue putting together more evidence.

'She needs to prove that Becky was directly responsible for the leaks or, at the very least, that the information came from her social media account.  

'Coleen is adamant she is right, but in a legal setting the evidence she has may not be enough to cross the threshold.'        

Making a case: The news comes as Rebekah is set to head-to-head with Coleen, after sources claimed their High Court battle is due to begin in a matter of weeks

Earlier this year, Coleen was also accused of leaking stories to the press by Rebekah after she told in a bombshell legal document how she had been left suicidal by the accusation that she had leaked stories about Coleen and her family.

She also claimed in the document drawn up for her libel battle against Coleen that the stress of the scandal had left her fearful of losing her unborn baby at the time and suffering panic attacks that made her too scared to leave her home.

The I'm A Celeb star complained of being made a 'scapegoat' by her rival seeking to blame her for stories appearing when in the past Coleen had approved of her friends leaking gossip about her.

The document says Rebekah believes she 'has deliberately been made a scapegoat (sic) by the Defendant (Coleen) for past 'leaked' stories.'

It points to previous stories about Coleen and Wayne with some 'in particular about their marriage, which have in fact come from the Defendant's friends, at times even with the Defendant's approval.'  

The paper states that Sun journalist Dan Wootton had said on talkRADIO on October 19 last year that Coleen had 'manipulated the media to tell stories about her own life'.

Wootton added that he had 'written many, many stories' about her marriage and 'lots of other things around the Rooneys' that had come directly from friends of Coleen including some told 'with her (Coleen's) approval', says the document.

He went on to say on talkRADIO that nothing had ever come from 'any of the Vardys', it adds.

Rebekah describes in her document how Coleen's public denunciation of her on Instagram while she was seven months pregnant had 'gravely injured her reputation'.

Detailing how Coleen had 'caused her enormous distress and very extreme embarrassment', she disclosed how she had been bombarded with abuse on social media.

Rebekah said that the widespread damage to her reputation was illustrated by research showing her name had become a more popular search term than 'Brexit' on Google in the UK on the day the scandal broke.

She also claimed that it led to her name appearing 276,822 times on Twitter on the same day, more than triple the number of mentions of Boris Johnson who had had his name published only 80,704 times.

Coleen made headlines around the world last October when she made her devastating claim that Rebekah had been leaking stories about her and her family to the Sun newspaper. 

She released the statement: 'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account / individual it's come from.

'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's ……………. Rebekah Vardy's account.'

Rebekah immediately denied the claims and has since been fighting to clear her name and demands Coleen withdraw the claims against her. 

She hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations, writing: 'Can’t believe I’m even having to write this. I’m pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this. 

'I’m now having to take legal advice as I can’t deal with this stress myself when I’m this pregnant. As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.

'I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for. If you thought this was happening you can could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'

She continued: 'Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself. 

'I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this especially when I'm heavily pregnant. 

'I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened [broken heart emoji].'

'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation
