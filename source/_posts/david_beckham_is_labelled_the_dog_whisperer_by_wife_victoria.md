He was famed for his almost telepathic crossing technique during a stellar career with Manchester United, Real Madrid and the England national team. 

But David Beckham hinted at a no less impressive ability to read the minds of his three pet dogs as they relaxed at home on Sunday evening. 

The former footballer, who hung up his boots following a brief spell at Paris Saint Germain in 2013, appeared to entrance dogs Olive, Fig and Sage while feeding them treats. 

Here we go: David Beckham was filmed as he fed the family's three pet dogs while relaxing at home on Sunday night 

In a short video shared by fashion designer wife Victoria, David, 45, illustrates their obedience by instructing them to behave as he gives each of them a dog biscuit. 

Heard off camera, Victoria, 46, poked fun at her husband by calling him the 'Dog Whisperer' - a reference to celebrity dog trainer Cesar Millan - while their three pets dutifully lined up at his feet. 

Working his way down the line,  David is seen instructing Fig to raise both front paws, which she does obediently, before receiving her well earned treat.

A job well done: David looked pleased after treating Olive, Sage and Fig on Sunday night

The post comes after David, who is reportedly being lined up for a stint on Celebrity Bake Off, honed his culinary skills by experimenting with recipes during lockdown.

According to reports, Victoria 'couldn't get enough' of David's homemade pizza after using various different toppings.

Although it has been claimed that the fashion designer who is known for her love of steamed fish and vegetables, is 'back to clean eating' now autumn is approaching.

A source told The Sun: 'Victoria hasn't touched a carb since 2001. But at the start of lockdown, David started experimenting with recipes — making the dough from scratch and trying various toppings.'

They added: 'Victoria eventually relented and had a small slice. Things progressed and, basically, she couldn't get enough of David's delicious golden dough balls.'
