EastEnders actress Lacey Turner has announced she is pregnant with her second child.

The star and her husband Matt Kay, welcomed their daughter Dusty in July 2019 after suffering two miscarriages, and admitted to OK! Magazine this week that they 'feel so lucky' to have conceived again. 

Lacey, 32, gushed that their happy news was a 'miracle', a day after it was reported she would be taking another extended break from BBC soap EastEnders.

Speaking to OK!, Lacey said: 'We feel so lucky to be expecting our second baby, as it took so long to get Dusty.'

The star, who is 16 weeks pregnant, had two miscarriages before conceiving her daughter Dusty, 14 months.

'It took so long with Dusty,' explained Lacey. 'But now they're coming along like buses! After the heartbreak we went through, it's a miracle to fall pregnant so quickly.'

Both of Lacey's miscarriages happened at seven weeks and she admits it is a 'huge relief' to be further along the pregnancy and past the heartbreaking milestone.

She admitted: 'I still feel nervous but I think I always will. I got past seven weeks, then nine weeks, and so on. They're all milestones. The 20-week mark is the point I feel like I can breathe a bit easier, as it's the halfway point. Although I went straight onto progesterone as I think that helped last time.' 

She added that she has been having private scans every two weeks due to her previous losses. 

On Sunday it was reported that Lacey is set to take a lengthy break from EastEnders just as her character Stacey Fowler has returned to Albert Square.
