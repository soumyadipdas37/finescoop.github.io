It was confirmed last week that The Voice Australia has found a new home in Channel Seven, after a nine-year run on rival network Nine.

And according to The Daily Telegraph on Saturday, Seven is 'set to axe coaches Boy George and Kelly Rowland' as part of a cost-cutting measure.

The publication understands the network feels Nine 'spent too much on B-listers' and is keen to spend their money on big-name replacements.

'One of the big changes Seven plans to make is how much is being spent on judges,' a source close to The Voice reportedly said.  

'They believe Nine was simply paying too much for a bunch of B-listers.'   

It is claimed Seven is 'in talks' with American R&B star Usher, while other replacements include Kylie Minogue and homegrown talent, Jessica Mauboy.

While Delta Goodrem and Guy Sebastian are believed to be safe, Seven are reportedly casting their eye over Delta's rumoured $1.5million per year salary.

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Seven for comment.

Nine 'failed to renew the contract' for the 2021 season, with Seven jumping on the deal 'very quickly', it was confirmed last Saturday, 

Sonia Kruger, who previously hosted the singing competition and is now over at Seven, will host the series in 2021.

In a statement, Seven's CEO and managing director James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'.

James has changes in mind for the show, with less episodes and a tighter production schedule.

'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter timeframe,' he said.

A Channel Nine spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia last Sunday: 'Unfortunately due to the age of the show and declining demographic profile, The Voice had become by far the poorest financial performer on our slate.'

'We wish 7 well in their quest to revive yet another Nine show.'

'We are very excited about the schedule we have now set for reinvigorating our slate and we will have announcements at our upfronts on September 16. We remain focussed on our audience and the financial performance of Nine.'

Delta, who is the longest-serving coach on The Voice, revealed to Who magazine in May why she keeps returning each year.

'I have been thankful to have been a part of the show since its inception which means I'm also a part of its evolution,' she said.

'I take great pride in the incredible show we make and the phenomenon it continues to be.

'The amount of magical moments that I have been a part of and that have happened over the years will always stay with me.'
