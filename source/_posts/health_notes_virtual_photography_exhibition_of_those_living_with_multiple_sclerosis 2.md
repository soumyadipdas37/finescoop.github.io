A virtual photography exhibition is shining a light on the remarkable lives of people living with multiple sclerosis (MS).

The online gallery was created by fine art photographer Hannah Laycock, who lives with the neurological condition. 

Among the images on display are photos of Lesley Bain, an oncology nurse told to shield but who continued working remotely for the sake of her patients, and Stuart and Lucy Wood, a father and daughter both living with MS.

The exhibition can be found at livinglikeyou.co.uk, which provides advice on how to live well with MS.

Sorry ladies, but men don't exaggerate their symptoms when they get the sniffles. Research carried out by Utrecht University compared how men and women fared when they caught the common cold, and found there was absolutely no difference between the sexes.

'It's commonly believed that men exaggerate the severity of their illness when infected with a respiratory virus,' said Eva Lutgerink, who carried out the research. 

'But our results show that there are no differences between men and women in their reports on the symptoms.'

Children with asthma can now breathe more easily – thanks to a new smartphone game that teaches them to use their inhaler.

The game, called Rafi-tone, features a robot which shows youngsters proper inhaler technique, meaning their medication is far more likely to be effective.

When the child is breathing and inhaling medication with a spacer correctly, Rafi fights off attacking colourful cartoon-style baddies.

It's specifically designed for children who use an inhaler with a spacer, a tube and mask attachment that helps deliver vital asthma drugs. However, many children struggle with the bulky equipment, and some also find it frightening.

Rafi-tone was developed by University of Manchester ophthalmologist Professor Tariq Aslam to help his son, also called Rafi. 'Instead of the usual tears and screams Rafi was distracted by the screen display and took the medication silently and properly,' says Prof Aslam. 

'I was amazed to hear him say, 'That was really good daddy, can we do it again in the morning?' '
