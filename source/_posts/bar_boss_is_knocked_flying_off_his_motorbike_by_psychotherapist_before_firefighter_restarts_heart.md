A motorcyclist is 'lucky to be alive' after he was knocked off his bike by a renowned psychotherapist before needing to be resuscitated.

Alan Lorrimer's heart stopped after 81-year-old Dr Joseph Berke smashed into the back of his bike on a roundabout in Hertfordshire on July 24 last year.

Shocking dashcam footage from a nearby lorry caught the moment Lorrimer was hit by Dr Berke's black Citroen Picasso at 9.55am.

Lorrimer, a bar and music venue boss, was thrown from his bike and lay in the road as Dr Berke, from Highgate, London, slowed down before continuing down the South Mimms interchange where his lawyer said he was looking for somewhere to stop.

The founder and owner of Piano Works in London suffered a heart attack as a result of the crash and was saved by an off-duty firefighter who performed CPR.

Lorrimer was then taken to Royal London Hospital by air ambulance where he spent three days in intensive care being treated for a broken shoulder bone, three broken ribs and scarring to his knee. 

In a statement read at Stevenage magistrates, Lorrimer said: 'I was stationary at a red traffic light on a bright sunny morning and the next thing I knew I was lying on my back in the middle of the road of a busy roundabout.

'The pain was excruciating and I couldn't get up. Suddenly I passed out and started having a heart attack.

'A firefighter called Curtis rushed across and started CPR. The first time he tried there were no vital signs and it was only on the second attempt that I started to breathe again.

'If it hadn't been for Curtis I honestly believe I would be dead. I feel lucky to be alive.'

Dr Berke who is described as a 'pioneer in medication-free therapy', is known for having treated Mary Barnes, a schizophrenic Scottish nurse who later became a famous artist, writer and mystic.

He did not appear in court because of coronavirus self-isolation but admitted to driving without care or attention and his insurance company has admitted liability. 

Lorrimer's lawyer Laura Swaine said her client was still suffering from physical and mental scars and that he was pleased Dr Berke had pleaded guilty. 

Appearing in court, Lorrimer said that he was diagnosed with moderate PTSD and requires 16 sessions to try and help him get over it.

He also said: 'I am told he was interviewed by police at the time and he said his brakes had failed. The vehicle inspectors said there was nothing wrong with them.' 

Speaking through his lawyer Jonathan Black, Dr Berke said he had been trying to find a Kwik Fit and had not noticed the traffic lights on the roundabout.

Black said: 'He tells me that he has tried to call and find out what has happened to Mr Lorrimer but he was told that there was no information available.

'He said I pray for him everyday that he gets better. There is no reason to believe that this is not genuine.

'After the accident from Mr Berke, he looked for the first place he could stop. He didn't drive off. He struggled to get out of his car.'

Black also said that the event was a one-off and out of character for Dr Berke, describing it as 'an extremely unfortunate incident'. 

Dr Berke was handed a six-month driving ban and fines and costs totalling £700 which needed to be paid within 14 days.

Alongside the off-duty firefighter who performed CPR, a nurse and a soldier also rushed to Lorrimer's aid and to say thank you, he tracked them down and held a party for them.

Speaking after the hearing, Lorrimer said he was pleased that Dr Berke had been handed the maximum sentence but would have liked the opportunity to speak with the psychotherapist, who he says has not apologised.

He said: 'This has been a year and three months since the incident and he has made no contact with me either to ask after me or to apologise.'
