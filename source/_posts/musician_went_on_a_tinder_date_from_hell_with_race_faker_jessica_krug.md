A Tinder user has revealed how bogus black professor Jessica Krug spewed anti-white hate and lectured him for hours about systemic racism on a 'date from hell'.

Musician Ken Pazn, 30, was expecting an afternoon of flirty fun after he swiped right on Krug's profile and suggested a romantic stroll in Manhattan.

But he was soon regretting the February 2018 hook-up after Krug began boasting of her hatred of white people and attacked him for being too 'passive' in the 'war' on gentrification.

'I have never met anyone more racist than her,' Pazn, who is Afro-Latino, told DailyMail.com in an exclusive interview.

'It was all F whites, F the police, F capitalism, all of that stuff. You could not believe the look on her face when I revealed I had friends of all races.

'I feared she was ready to fistfight me if challenged any of her views. I would have liked some physical action – but not that kind.'

Krug began boasting of her hatred of white people and attacked him for being too 'passive' in the 'war' on gentrification during their date 

Krug was a little too political for his taste when he came across her profile in which she begins by describing herself as a dancer and historian living in 'El Barrio'

Pazn votes Democrat and says he's a believer in the principles behind Black Lives Matter but not the violence and angry rhetoric adopted by some protestors.

He wondered if 38-year-old Krug was a little too political for his tastes when he came across her profile in which she begins by describing herself as a dancer and historian living in 'El Barrio'.

Pazn, who performs under the moniker King Pazn, said he backed off after Krug began saying 'some pretty wild things'

'Please be about something larger than yourself. I am all about surviving pending revolution,' Krug goes on.

'Your passion for moving our people forward together will hook me; paving your way to other countries will not. Upwardly-mobile bougie types, swipe left.'

Pazn changed his tune, however, when he randomly passed by Krug in the street and noted how attractive she was.

'She had said some pretty wild things when we began talking so I backed off a little bit,' said Pazn, who performs under the moniker King Pazn.

'I think it's a little hypocritical when people resent individuals for being a different ethnicity. They throw around terms like white privilege but I myself feel very privileged to be Afro-Latino.

'To be honest her opinions are pretty standard in the New York arts and music scene. I don't agree with them but these are the sorts of people Tinder routinely matches me up with.

'When I passed by her in person, I thought wait a minute, she is very fit, she has a great figure. I thought why not her send her a message and see how things go.'

Pazn said settling on a venue was far from straightforward as Krug refused to go to 'gentrifier spots', warning him in a message that she wouldn't deal with 'stupid nasal voices talking about how edgy our hoods are.'

In Krug's Tinder bio she writes, 'Please be about something larger than yourself. I am all about surviving pending revolution'

Krug described herself as a 'dancer, historian, organizer' in her Tinder profile and used this mirror photo in shorts and a crop top 

Eventually they agreed to meet for a walk in Fort Tyron Park, in upper Manhattan's Hudson Heights neighborhood.

Like the numerous academics and students who spent years interacting with Krug, Pazn said he had no reason to think that the identity politics firebrand was faking her race.

'At no stage did I question her authenticity. There are many pale Latinos in my neighborhood, we come in many shades and colors. I didn't really pay much attention to her accent,' he said.

'Jessica was wearing short shorts and a red top, she looked good, she was showing off her legs. There was something off about her demeanor though, she didn't smile much, she wasn't very tactile.

'The conversation immediately turned to politics. She asked me about the neighborhood and I told her a little bit about the history.

'She then started questioning why I was referring to it in such a ''passive'' way. She wanted a stance, she wanted a stronger opinion. It became pretty clear she wanted me to criticize white people.

'I tried to switch the topic to salsa dancing but it was soon back to politics. She told me this story about how she had encountered a white guy at some event and almost started a fight with him.

'I asked if she had white friends at the college where she worked. She said she worked with whites but didn't trust them.

'We covered the history of world colonization, the European invasion, Christopher Columbus – I was there for a date and instead I was getting a lecture.'

Pazn decided to tell Krug how some kids at his black and Hispanic-dominated school had been picked on or even beaten up because they were white. She replied: 'Ok, so what?'

With the date descending into frosty awkwardness, he tried to impress her by revealing he could speak fluent Russian because his parents had lived there for a while. 

'I noticed she had a Marxist symbol, maybe a hammer and sickle tattoo, on her back. I thought telling her this could boost the attraction levels,' he said.

Krug revealed on last week that she has lied about being black her entire career

'She responded by attacking my parents for 'poisoning my upbringing' and 'kissing white a**' by taking me to a predominantly white country.

'I asked her what she thought of about Che Guevara. She didn't like him either - because he was too white.

'I stuck it out for a few hours hoping it would go somewhere. But unless that meant going to war against white people and taking back what had been stolen from Indigenous people, it wasn't happening.'

Pazn said he was so despondent after he got home from the disastrous rendezvous that he decided against further Tinder dates.

He says it's becoming impossible to meet people within liberal arts circles who do not have some degree of sympathy with Krug's radical anti-white positions.

Pazn actually Tweeted about his 'date from hell' last Wednesday, coincidentally one day before Krug outed herself as a white Jewish woman from Kansas City, Missouri who had spent decades posing as a black and later black-Hispanic academic and prominent opponent of systemic racism.

In a lengthy confession titled 'The Truth, and the Anti-Black Violence of My Lies', she wrote: 'For the better part of my adult life, every move I've made, every relationship I've formed, has been rooted in the napalm toxic soil of lies. 

'To an escalating degree over my adult life, I have eschewed my lived experience as a white Jewish child in suburban Kansas City under various assumed identities within a Blackness that I had no right to claim: first North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness.'

Krug was spotted for the first time since the scandal broke last week and since resigning from her post as a professor of African American studies at George Washington University 

After Krug's mea culpa made global headlines, some fellow academics cast doubt on her honesty, saying she only came clean because Hispanic scholars were about to out her. George Washington University has said Krug will not be teaching in the Fall however her outraged colleagues are pushing for her time at the DC-based school to be put to a permanent end.

'I think it's hilarious this whole time she was masquerading as a Latina. It also explains why her butt was flat, she wasn't packing much peaches,' Pazn joked.

'I had always thought that maybe she hated herself because she was so light-skinned. Now it's obvious that was the case.

'What most disappointed me about all this is that she's a college professor. To think of someone teaching this racist ideology – because it is racist – to impressionable young people is really worrying.

'I did actually come across Jessica's dating profile again but quickly swiped left. I don't think she's going to find what she's looking for unless Malcolm X pops up on Tinder.

'She's actually more suited to the blackface character Robert Downey Jr plays in Tropic Thunder.'
