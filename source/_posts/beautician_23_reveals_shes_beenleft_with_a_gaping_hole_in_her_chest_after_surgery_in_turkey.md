A woman who travelled abroad for cosmetic surgery has been left with a gaping hole in her chest from the botched boob job. 

Cherrise Massay, 23, who lives in Salford, Manchester, went under the knife in Istanbal, Turkey, after friends recommended a clinic.

The beautician paid £5,500 for a breast uplift, augmentation and a Brazilian butt lift.

However, she woke from the eight-hour surgery to find her bottom had been filled with breast implants.

The mother-of-two was soon required to have emergency surgery and three blood transfusions, which were only the start of her 'living nightmare.'

Cherrise said: 'I researched the clinic and saw amazing results as four friends had been there. Everything seemed legit and I couldn't wait to get rid of my saggy boobs after breast feeding.

'Initially, I wanted a fatty lump removed from my bottom as I had a BBL in February in Miami.

'But after my consultation, I agreed to have implants as it sounded better - however I did not think it would be breast implants!

'I woke up from the surgery and I didn't feel well. I knew something was wrong. I begged the nurses, who couldn't speak English, to help me as I couldn't even lift up my head.

'It took two days of complaining for them to realise - something isn't right.'

The beautician (pictured) had to be rushed to intensive care for three blood transfusions after her body began to reject the implants

Cherrise recalls having six drains attached to her breasts, bum and stomach, with all filling rapidly with blood.

She was rushed to intensive care for three blood transfusions.

The 23-year-old was told her body was rejecting the bum implants and she was put under local anaesthetic whilst they were removed.

Cherrise said: 'I instantly felt better when I woke up from surgery.

'I was shocked when I saw the implants they put in - they were different sizes and for breasts!

'My breasts looks good but swollen which is normal however my one nipple kept on bleeding.

'They kept putting small plaster-like strips over it to mask the bleeding and the fact it was rising.

Cherrise (pictured before) was diagnosed with necrosis, when she visited A&E in the UK where doctors were horrified to see what had been done to her body 

'But I was told the bleeding was normal.'

After one week, Cherrise returned back to the U.K. and immediately went to A&E.

She was diagnosed with flesh eating bacterial necrosis, but the bleeding was a good sign because it meant the skin wasn't completely dead.

She said: 'Doctors were horrified to see what they had done to me.

'I had to go every other day to get the bandages changed and it went from bad to worse.

'My nipple was purple in Turkey and I was told it was bruising but after a couple of weeks, it was jet black.

'Two weeks after the surgery, I noticed my nipple was lifting despite being on strong antibiotics to try and stop the infection.

Cherrise (pictured) said within weeks of having surgery her nipple fell off, leaving a 'gaping' hole in her chest 

'Four days later on September 21, my nipple completely came off.

'I fell to the floor as I saw it peel off with the bandages. I am completely mortified.'

Cherrise claims to have been left with a 'gaping' hole in her chest which she says has a 'horrific' smell.

Holding back the tears, Cherrise said: 'I feel like i'm in a horror film - i can't even get away with it.

'It stinks like a dead body because it is rotting flesh.

'I can't forget about it because it is burning and my whole breast is in pain.

'I am at risk of contracting sepsis and the clinic in Turkey don't even care - they have blocked me!' 

NHS doctors told Cherrise that they suspect an artery was caught when inserting the implant.

Cherrise (pictured) admits she regrets going to Turkey for surgery and hopes sharing her story will stop other women from going abroad for procedures 

They are monitoring the infection but may have to take the implant out.

Cherrise said: 'I am happy to take the implant out if necessary.

'I regret going to Turkey, I wish I had just kept my saggy boobs.

'I am going to need a skin graft on my nipple in the future which will leave me with more scars.

'It is too late for me and I have a long road to recover but I hope my story will stop other women from going abroad for surgery.

'The surgeons I visited don't care about you, they just want your money - I have learnt the hard way.

'I wouldn't wish any of this on my worst enemy - it is truly horrendous.

'I wish I had saved more and got the surgery in the UK, I was quoted £8,800.

'I am urging girls to save more and steer clear from Turkey - it doesn't matter if your friend has been or you have done research!'
