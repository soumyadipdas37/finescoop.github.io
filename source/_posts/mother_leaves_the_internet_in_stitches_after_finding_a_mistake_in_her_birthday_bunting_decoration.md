An Australian woman has left the internet in stitches after purchasing a $4.50 celebration sign from Kmart only to find it had a major spelling mistake.

The mother shared an image of her faulty decoration on Facebook, blaming the discount retailer for spelling 'Happy Birthday' incorrectly on her husband's special day.

'WTF Kmart?????? Harpy Dipthbay!!!!! WTF?????' she captioned the photo.

More than 10,000 people on social media 'liked' the post, calling the issue 'peak 2020' and a fabulous description of birthdays during the coronavirus pandemic.

'The person who assembled it probably can't read English and is doing the assembly based off the colours. The letters they swapped around are the same colours. (R and P both yellow, D and B both red),' said one person.

'Wonder what the Kmart elves were on when they put that one together?' said another.

A third added: 'It looks like someone has been celebrating before the party'. 

Some suggested that it was an easy fix and she could just pull all of the letters off the string and start from scratch.

On the Kmart website the Glitter Happy Birthday Bunting product is said to contain 13 pieces and has 'Happy Birthday spelled out'

But others said leaving it misspelt would be far funnier in photos and she should take advantage of the mistake.

There are three reviews giving the three-metre decoration five stars out of five.
