Eric Dier was caught up in a hilarious moment when he sprinted to use the toilet during Tottenham's Carabao Cup clash with Chelsea, with Jose Mourinho running after him.

The hosts were trailing 1-0 thanks to Timo Werner's first-half strike, but with 15 minutes to the England midfielder was spotted charging off the pitch.

Dier did re-emerge from the tunnel moments later, before reports from the ground later stated the midfielder had simply dashed off to use the toilet.

Tottenham went on to win the game on penalties after Erik Lamela's equaliser and Mason Mount's inaccurate spot-kick, before Mourinho and Dier both confirmed what had happened in the second half. 

Dier said: 'He [Mourinho] wasn't happy but there was nothing I could do about it, nature was calling.

'I heard there was a chance when I wasn't on, but thankfully they didn't score. For one to fall our way is a very nice feeling.'

Mourinho added: 'Dier had to go, no other chance, he had to go. Maybe it's a normal thing when you are dehydrated, have nothing in your muscles. 

'I knew he had to go but i was trying to put some pressure on him to have him back for the remaining time. He was a great example for everybody.'

Both Dier and Mourinho confirmed what had happened to Dier with 15 minutes to go
