She's been living it up on a two-week cruise in Croatia with her multi-millionaire husband Christian Richard. 

But Thursday marked the end of Christine Quinn's trip with the retired tech entrepreneur as they were seen heading to an airport in Split.

The Selling Sunset star, 31, quenched her thirst with a can of Coca Cola as she engaged in conversation with the businessman, 41, after revealing her outfits on the series cost $1,000 (£781) per day.

Cutting a typically chic figure, the real estate agent stunned in a white crop top and a cowboy-inspired skirt.

The reality star nailed daytime glamour by wearing nude heels, and accessorising with oversized shades and a floppy hat.

Christian, meanwhile, dressed down in a white T-shirt, grey jeans and black canvas trainers,

Season three of Selling Sunset saw Christine tie the knot with her partner at a downtown Los Angeles cathedral in December 2019, following a whirlwind romance.  

Earlier this week, Christine detailed the ins and outs of her daily routine on the show in an interview with Vogue magazine.

The Oppenheim Group employee told the publication: 'I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of makeup. How I look on [Selling Sunset] is not how I look when I wake up in the morning.

'When it comes to the show, I don’t do my own hair. I do my own makeup because I love doing it. The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two and a half to three hours. My glam isn’t cheap, either — $1,000 a day, if I go all out. It’s expensive to look this cheap.

'It’s important in a world where there’s this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia. People think that [things are] real, and they’re not.' 

The blonde recently admitted she  has shed a tear or two over 'hurtful' trolls reacting to her role on the Netflix hit. 

The siren told The Sunday Times: 'People that don't know me say hurtful things. I'm just like, "Ugh, whatever." I don't know these people. 

'But when I hear stuff from other people… That's upsetting. Sometimes, it hurts my feelings. Sometimes, it makes me cry.'

Although she's as vulnerable as the next person, Christine clarified she has no intention of toning down her villainous persona.
