Shocking footage shows a teenage schoolgirl swinging a small family dog around her kitchen before stuffing him in the fridge.

NSW Police and the RSPCA are investigating the Sydney girl and her friend after they shared the shocking animal abuse on Snapchat.

Video shows the Bede Polding College student grabbing the brown Pomeranian named Oscar by the neck and roughly swinging him around the room.

She then taunted the agitated pet by appearing to bite him on the nose, with the mocking caption 'get mad, tiger'.

Finally, the girl carried Oscar to the fridge saying 'you want to go in there?' before shoving him on to a shelf inside and closing the door.

The second girl filming the abuse laughed hysterically as the helpless pup was trapped inside.

Bede Polding principal Mark Compton strongly condemned the footage and said the school had dobbed the girls in to police and the RSPCA.

'The College finds this footage most disturbing and does not condone this behaviour at all,' he said.

'Indeed we will be taking appropriate action and we will be informing the relevant authorities as you would expect.'

In a further statement to parents, Mr Compton said the school was 'deeply disappointed' with their behaviour and would take swift action.

'Two students from the College recently shared online footage of the mistreatment of a family pet,' he said.

'The College has been working closely with the family of the students to respond to this distressing incident. 

'Though this incident happened away from the school, the College has high expectations of students at all times. 

'The police and RSPCA have also been informed about this matter.' 

The video was met with widespread outrage when it was shared on other social media channels.
