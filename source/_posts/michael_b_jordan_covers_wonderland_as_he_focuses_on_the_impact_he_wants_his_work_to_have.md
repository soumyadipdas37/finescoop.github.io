He recently lost a dear friend and costar from one of the most successful films of the last decade.

And Michael B. Jordan struck a stately and regal pose on the cover of the Autumn 2020 issue of Wonderland Magazine, in an upscale ensemble that was head-to-toe Coach – the luxury brand for which the actor is a spokesman.

The Black Panther star, 33, looked confident in the outfit of varying greys, wrapped in an earth-toned blanket as he sat on a couch.

Jordan sported a healthy mustache in the shot styled by Toni Blaze and Jason Rembert, with photography by Blair Caldwell.

He wore a ribbed grey sweater, similarly colored zip vest, and shiny matching slacks.

The Just Mercy actor's sneakers were Coach issue as well, in grey and tan accented with dark red.

Michael's Instagram feed is currently peppered with promotional posts for Coach, including a special CoachxBasquiat collection featuring the artwork of groundbreaking 1980s artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.

His feed also contains several shares dedicated to his late Black Panther costar Chadwick Boseman, who tragically passed away last month at the age of 43 after a years-long and secret battle with colon cancer.

The sought-after Fruitvale Station actor was most recently seen in Malibu, California last week, along with Lupita Nyong'o and others to attend a memorial service for the fallen star.

For Wonderland, Michael discussed his journey in Hollywood so far, which recently included Just Mercy — a socially relevant film he produced and starred in opposite Jamie Foxx based on the memoir of Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative. 

The Creed star also addressed 'using his influence to uplift the next generation and the impact he wants his work to have.'

Up next for Jordan is an eclectic and intriguing group of projects.

He will reprise his villainous role of Erik Killmonger from Black Panther in the Marvel series What If...?, which ruminates on alternate universes/storylines within that sprawling comic book world.

Michael has also wrapped production on action-adventure/crime caper Tom Clancy's Without Remorse, opposite Jamie Bell, Cam Gigandet and Jodie Turner-Smith.

He's also preparing for at least four additional projects, including an untitled David O. Russell film with Christian Bale and Margot Robbie, an actioner called Methuselah, and Wrong Answer, based on the true story of an Atlanta math teacher who altered his students' test scores to get funding for his school.
