Laurence Fox has revealed that his 'friend of ten years', actress Rebecca Front, has blocked him on Twitter over his views of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The star of ITV drama Lewis said on social media today that it is was the 'most painful cancellation I've had yet' after The Thick of It star disagreed with his #AllLivesmatter posts.

The actor courted controversy in June this year month after a recent tweet he posted, which said: 'Every single human life is precious! The end!'  It is a clear nod to the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by killing of George Floyd by police officers. 

He also penned a piece for The Spectator saying he would continue to speak out against the 'inconsistent god of progressivism'.

In the column he added: 'Righteous global outrage at a cruel and vile killing has morphed into a different agenda. 

'Similar things have happened with other movements; #MeToo,Extinction Rebellion, Brexit, even the Covid-19 pandemic. 

'The left rightly expose great chasms of inequality and hypocrisy in society — then proceed to throw themselves like lemmings into that void, unable to obey their own edicts.

'Desperately important causes have been politicised to the point of meaninglessness, opportunities for action hijacked swiftly by the cynical actors.'

Since then the actor has been using the #AllLivesmatter on a variety of Twitter posts on his account.

The actor courted further controversy after a recent tweet he posted, which said: 'Every single human life is precious! The end!

Today, Fox shared a screenshot of a conversation with Front. In the messages, Fox said: ‘Why would you block me? Have I said anything that could upset you? What a shame. Anyway, you are never blocked from me.’ 

Front replied: ‘Oh Lol, I think it was the #AllLivesMatter stuff that finally tipped me over the edge It seems to me so glaringly obvious that All Lives Matter – you’d have to be a psychopath to disagree – that it should be equally obvious it doesn’t need a slogan. ‘Black Lives are systematically undervalued. Their work opportunities are fewer, their health outcomes far worse, the criminal justice system works against them. I think the least we can do is let them have a f***ing slogan. 

‘But there are many, many things we clearly disagree on and, fond as I am of you, looking at your Twitter feed I just felt uncomfortable about the company you’re keeping. I’m sorry. I wish you and your lovely boys well. We’ll just have to agree to differ.’ 

Fox replied: ‘“The least we’re can do is let them have a f***ing slogan.” Jesus/ ‘It’s ok to disagree. But it’s the right thing to do to talk first before you cancel me. 

Especially given how racist the phrase you just wrote is. I thought we had more in common.’
