Machine Gun Kelly is set to work with iconic actors Robert De Niro and John Malkovich on a new motion picture called Wash Me in The River.

The motion picture, which will be directed by Randall Emmett, will focus on a recovering opioid addict who's seeking justice against drug dealers who sold the narcotics that killed his fiancee, with law enforcement investigating the situation, Deadline reported on Wednesday. 

The 30-year-old rapper/actor, whose real name is Colson Baker, is currently working with his love interest Megan Fox and Emmett on a movie called Midnight in the Switchgrass.

The film is expected to be a sough-after commodity at the Toronto Film Festival, according to Deadline.

Emmett told the outlet he 'couldn’t be more excited to work with' De Niro again and is 'so grateful that he is supporting me as a filmmaker now.'

He continued: 'Colson was always my first choice to play the lead in the movie and John has been an icon of mine since childhood. Having them both attached with Bob is a dream come true.'

The movie's production is slated for November 9 in locations including Georgia and Puerto Rico.

Migos member Quavo has also been negotiating to appear in the movie, according to Deadline.

Two-time Oscar-winner De Niro was seen in two of last year's most prominent films - Joker and The Irishman - and is slated to appear in this fall's The Comeback Trail with Morgan Freeman, Tommy Lee Jones, Emile Hirsch and Zach Braff.

Malkovich, a two-time Oscar nominee, has been seen in a number of TV series the last few years, including Space Force, The New Pope and Billions; and in the films Valley of the Gods and Arkansas.
