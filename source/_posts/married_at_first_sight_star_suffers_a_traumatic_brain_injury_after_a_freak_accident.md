A Married At First Sight star has been left unable to walk or pour herself a cup of coffee after suffering a traumatic brain injury following a freak accident.

On July 19, 28-year-old Bel Clarke, who starred in the New Zealand version of the reality series, decided to take her dog Millie for a walk before heading to the airport to pick up her mother.

During the walk, Millie ran underneath Bel's legs, causing her to lose her balance and fall backwards onto a concrete footpath.

'I just remember getting up and running, going "Where am I? I don't know where I am or who I am or what happened",' she told Stuff.com.nz. 

Bel managed to walk herself back home, but said it felt like someone was repeatedly 'bashing' her on the brain.

The reality star then drove to the airport to pick up her mother, but blacked out several times during the drive.

Later that day, she went on to hospital and doctors diagnosed her with concussion, before sending her home to rest.

'If I could describe it, it would be my brain is coming out of my eyes and my ears, and I was just screaming in pain. I have endometriosis which is really bad, I thought I'd experienced bad pain, and I have not,' she said.

A few days later, her family rushed her back to hospital and doctors revealed she'd experienced a traumatic brain injury.

Brain Injury: Bel's speech is now slurry, she uses a walking frame, and she's also coping with memory loss and chronic migraines
