TOWIE's Chloe Brockett has spoken out after viewers raised concerns she was being 'bullied' by her older co-stars Olivia Attwood, 29, and Nicole Bass, 28.

Chloe came under fire from some of her fellow castmates after she had a fling with her former BFF Ella Rae Wise's ex Jack McDermott.

After Wednesday's episode aired, fans on the show deemed it 'uncomfortable' viewing, feeling the 19-year-old was being picked on by her peers.

I'm fine: Chloe wrote: 'I know there's a lot of talk atm about me being bullied, I appreciate everyone's concern, however this is a show and everyone is entitled to their own opinions'

During a discussion with her mum and Joey Turner said: 'I've had Olivia call me a poisonous little snake.   

'Sorry you don't even know me. You're a old lanky troll, who really should be Pinteresting her wedding instead of slagging off a 19-year-old.

'It's embarrassing. If you've got something to say, say it to me.'

Hurtful: According to Chloe, Olivia called her a 'poisonous little snake'

Chloe wrote: 'I know there's a lot of talk atm about me being bullied, I appreciate everyone's concern, however this is a show and everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I am completely FINE. Towie would not allow bullying to go on and always put our welfare first.' 

One fan replied: 'Really mature tweet there. The girls have clearly had it in for you for a while now and they are just showing their true colours, as long as you are being looked after, supporter and know people care about your wellbeing that's all that matters. Forget them. 

'Disgusting': 'Think its so disgusting 'mature' women @Nicolecharbass @oliviajade_att are bullying a teenager @ChloeBrockett1', wrote one viewer

Others noted: 'Ever since Chloe B has been on TOWIE people have been bullying her... the same people sharing BeKind on their Instagram later that night.'

'I can't help but love Chloe B. I think last year with everyone bullying her, it's nice to see her come back so fierce. Go on girl,' a third chimed.

Tension: Ella was devastated when she discovered Chloe's betrayal

A fourth viewer added: 'I found it really uncomfortable to watch. I thought the show didn't need to show people digging you out like that. I didn't like it.

'Think its so disgusting 'mature' women @Nicolecharbass @oliviajade_att are bullying a teenager @ChloeBrockett1. But then they'll be the first to preach about trolling and online bullying etc,' typed another.  

While a different viewer typed: 'Olivia, Nicole and Clelia look so cool getting involved with Ella and Chloe's feud! It's honestly brave that they've chosen to forego storylines of their own in favour of bullying a teenager! They're not dry at all!'
