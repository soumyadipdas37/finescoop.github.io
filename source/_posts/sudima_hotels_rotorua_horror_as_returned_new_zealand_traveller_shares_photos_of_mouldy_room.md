A couple forced into hotel quarantine says they were forced to sleep on a blood-stained mattress surrounded by mouldy walls and torn curtains and often went hungry as staff forgot to deliver meals. 

Mark, who wished not to use his last name, and his partner had been staying at the Sudima Hotels at Rotorua, on New Zealand's north island.

The pair had returned from visiting Mark's sick father in the United Kingdom and were placed into mandatory two-week quarantine. 

Mark said the living conditions at the hotel were 'depressing' and compared it to prison, New Zealand Herald reported. 

Photographs from his room show ripped curtains hanging over the windows and an off-colour stained mattress.

Mould was also pictured growing in the corners of the walls as well as on the bathroom taps.  

'It really was the most disgusting experience,' Mark said.

'We were horrified to have been treated like this in our own country and feel New Zealanders should be made aware of just how low the standard is for the unlucky ones that get the short straw isolation accommodation.'  

Mark claims the food was inedible and staff often forgot to deliver the meals to the room.

He also had to pay $42 for a bottle of wine and a 'ridiculous' $10 for a microwave pie and chips.  

The complaint comes after a guest staying at Sudima Hotels escaped the premises for half-an-hour on Wednesday.

The man has tested negative to COVID-19 and no charges have been laid.

Mark said he was 'not surprised the man wanted to escape'.  

A Managed Isolation and Quarantine spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia it had received a complaint from the couple.

'Managed Isolation and Quarantine can confirm that it received complaints from the couple and that an MIQ complaints staff member had apologised to the couple for their experience,' the spokesperson said.

Sudima Hotels said in a statement it sincerely apologised to the couple.   

'We can confirm that this guest was moved to another room during their stay. We apologise strongly for any issues our guests experienced,' the statement said.

'Constraints placed on our operational teams while operating as a Managed Isolation Facility have interrupted some maintenance schedules, however Sudima Hotels has now actioned the guests concerns and audited all rooms across the property.'
