Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is interested in joining former club Manchester United in the race to sign Sergio Reguilon.

Spurs want to sign a left back before the transfer window closes and the Real Madrid defender is emerging as a contender to fill the role.

The 23-year-old could be available for around £25million - a price tag that both Spurs and United would be able to meet.

Sportsmail understands discussions regarding the full-back's possible departure will intensify this week - but sources close to Reguilon say the two Premier League clubs are leading the chase.

Sevilla, where he spent last season on loan, has also been mooted as possible destination for Reguilon, who made his international debut for Spain earlier this month in the 4-0 win over Ukraine.

Real Madrid are prepared to cash in on Reguilon this summer despite his impressive displays whilst out on loan last season as they are well stocked at left back.
