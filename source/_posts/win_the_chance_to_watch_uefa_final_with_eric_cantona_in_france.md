The King himself will be the host for a 'suave summer soiree'.

He'll be right there to discuss game tactics and exchange poetry, too, if the winner so desires.

Hotels.com said: 'Eric will be handing over keys to the luxury abode in Provence for two nights, as well as hanging around to enjoy the big game build-up and the match itself. That means it's time to start practising your anthem singing, chants and most importantly, your Cantona poetry.'

Cantona, the firm added, has been 'diligently preparing Casa De Cantona for his guests' arrival, making sure his VIPs have the ultimate viewing set-up and the best room in the house'.

You can see these preparations for yourself on this YouTube video.

At the time of writing the teams left in the competition are: RB Leipzig, Atlético Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, Lyon, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. 

The final will be played at Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica in Lisbon, Portugal, but it will be closed to fans.

Cantona claims that Casa De Cantona is the next best thing.
