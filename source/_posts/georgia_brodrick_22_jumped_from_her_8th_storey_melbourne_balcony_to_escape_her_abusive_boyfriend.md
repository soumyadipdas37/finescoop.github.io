A young dancer threw herself from an eighth storey balcony because she felt there was no other way to escape her abusive boyfriend.

Georgia Brodrick, 22, has bravely opened up about the day she hurled herself over the balcony of her apartment in Melbourne's CBD. 

On the morning of July 17, a hysterical Ms Brodrick called her father to come pick her up after learning her controlling boyfriend had cheated on her.  

'My dad didn't make it before I jumped,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Brodrick, who is unemployed as a result of the pandemic, has blacked out the moment she fell from her balcony (pictured above) and plunged to the ground

She landed on a fence and her body bounced into a nearby ditch.

The young woman was so battered that doctors gave her a ten per cent chance of survival.

'I was rushed to the Alfred Hospital where they put me in an induced coma and performed emergency surgery to my left arm as it was partially amputated,' she said.  

Ms Brodrick was unconscious for seven days with a broken back, neck and leg, but says she is no longer in pain.

She has blocked out all memories of the horrible moments before she jumped.

Because of the damage, Ms Brodrick is now in a wheelchair after being in the trauma ward for three weeks where she had to be fed through a tube. 

'All the doctors believed that it was a miracle that I survived without any brain damage,' she said.  

Ms Brodrick and her partner had started fighting but when she tried to escape him and leave, she claims he turned abusive

The young woman said she never realised just how much she was being manipulated by her partner.

'If I tried to leave him he would sit at the front door and wouldn’t let me out of the apartment,' she said.

'My family tried to warn me because they could see through his manipulation, so he constantly put them down and blamed them for my insecurities.

'He made me feel like he was the only person who truly loved me ... I am safe with my family and am getting the help I need.'

Ms Brodrick said she is happy to have survived as she feels like she isn't being 'controlled' anymore and is positive about her future.

When she was put into an induced coma Ms Brodrick's friends started a GoFundMe to help with future surgeries. 

'She has had a lot of surgeries but she will still have a massive recovery ahead,' the fundraiser read.

'There is going to be a lot of cost to get our girl back on her feet as she may never be able to walk properly again.'

'The money will be going to get her Dialectical behaviour therapy as well as rehab and other treatments along the way.' 

Ms Brodrick hopes to walk again by Christmas, but doesn't know if she'll ever regain full function of her left arm.

'At the moment I can only wiggle my fingers a tiny bit,' she said. 

Her advice to others in the same situation is to seek help as soon as possible.

'Please speak to a family member or a close friend that you trust, ask them for help and organise a plan to get out of the dangerous situation.'
