Tottenham fans have reacted with delight to the news that Gareth Bale has returned to the club.

It was announced on Saturday that the Welshman will spend the next season at the club on loan from Real Madrid. 

The news comes seven years after the 31-year-old left the club, following a memorable six-year stint at the old White Hart Lane.

After Tottenham broke the news, fans flooded onto social media to give their immediate reaction to the news. 

Nigel Parker tweeted: 'Yessss back home where you belong' while RyanGoldy8 commented: 'This is the greatest day of my life and I'm fully including my wedding day in that Gareth Bale is home'.

A number of users joked about the Welshman being the best replacement for himself, since he left in 2013.





One user commented: 'Tottenham finally replace Bale...with Bale. Fair play, great signing and a great player, definitely gonna be frighting going forward.' 

Erik Lamela was seen as the replacement to Bale when he joined from Roma in 2013 for just under £26m.

GabriFifa tweeted: 'Erik Lamela, from being the "Bale replacement" to now being replaced by Bale.'





A number of supporters also joked about Bale and his love of golf.

Kobey Davidson joked about Tottenham's video unveiling Bale, 'Not gonna lie disappointed it was not a golf video.'

While ElNino posted a picture of golf flags posted on the goal-line at the Tottenham Hotspurs Stadium with the caption 'Spurs have already made some adjustments in the goal post for him.'

During his first-spell at the club, Bale scored 55 goals in 203 appearances, winning the PFA Player of the Year during his last year at the club.

Tottenham fans might have to wait a month for the winger to make his second debut with the club as he recovers from a knee injury sustained on international duty with Wales.

They will be hoping the signings of Bale and Sergio Reguilon, also from Real Madrid, will help propel them into Champions League qualification this season.
