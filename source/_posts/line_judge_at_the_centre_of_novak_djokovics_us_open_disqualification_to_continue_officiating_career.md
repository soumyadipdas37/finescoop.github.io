The line judge at the centre of the Novak Djokovic US Open disqualification is planning to continue her officiating career, despite being shaken by her unwitting part in the controversy that rocked Flushing Meadows.

Laura Clark, who Djokovic accidentally hit in the throat when he swished a ball away in anger during his fourth round, was back on duty 48 hours after finding herself at the centre of an international sporting incident. 

A spokesperson for the US Tennis Association confirmed that, after being told to rest up at her hotel the following day, she worked at two more matches during the tournament before returning to her home in Kentucky.

According to a source who worked alongside her in New York, she returned to call the lines on the second Tuesday, despite being shocked by her new-found notoriety and the abuse she received via social media. 

The match was, however, a relatively low-key doubles affair on the Louis Armstrong Stadium and not on Arthur Ashe where the incident occurred.

The source said: ‘She noticeably had the mask up over her face and a cap pulled down low, it looked like she didn’t want to be recognised, understandably,’ adding that she was considered ‘a popular member of the team who is highly regarded and reliable’. 

Clark then worked on another match before returning home to Owensboro, having told colleagues that the incident would not put her off the job she loves.

In the wake of the match, Djokovic checked on her by phone and apologised for distress caused. He also issued a statement asking fans to desist from abusing her on social media accounts, which were quickly locked. 

Clark was shaken by the incident at Flushing Meadows but was back on court within 48 hours 

While some of the trolls were his fans, notorious for targeting anyone they consider doing down their hero, the abuse was added to by gamblers who had lost money through the default, as is sadly commonplace in tennis.

Clark, whose accounts showed her to be a lover of fine wines and country music, was ordered by officials not to publicly discuss the incident.

Djokovic left the stadium half an hour after being told by Referee Andreas Egli that his US Open was over, having failed to give his obligatory press conference.

According to the USTA one thing he did in that time was to provide a sample for doping control, who require anyone losing from the fourth round onwards to be automatically tested. Sources reported that he was calm and polite while going through the process.

Djokovic will not be renewing acquaintance with Clark in Paris, and due to the drastically pared down schedule at all levels of tennis for the rest of the year she is unlikely to be working much anyway before 2021.

The 33-year-old Serbian stated at the Italian Open that he had moved on from the incident, and it certainly looked that way as he won the title in Rome for the fifth time.

As he prepares to challenge Rafael Nadal and Dominic Thiem when the event starts on Sunday, organisers were fearing last night that the number of spectators could be further cut due to rising Coronavirus cases in Paris.

French government ministers were meeting on Wednesday to discuss whether to impose further restrictions, including reducing maximum gatherings at events, which currently stand at 5,000.

Roland Garros originally had ambitions to run at 50 per cent capacity, before that was cut to 11,500 and then 5,000. That may go down to just 1,000 allowed only on the Court Philippe Chatrier, subject to ministerial decisions.

Stockport’s Liam Broady moved into the final round of the French Open qualifying event when he defeated Holland’s Botic Van De Zandschulp 7-6 7-6.
