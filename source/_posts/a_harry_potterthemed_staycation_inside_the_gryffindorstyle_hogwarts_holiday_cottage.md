Here's the perfect lodge for a magical staycation.

Harry Potter fans can step inside the world of their favourite wizard - thanks to a cottage in Yorkshire that mesmerisingly mimics the Gryffindor wing of Hogwarts.

The abode, modelled after the movies' portrayal of J K Rowling's wizarding kingdom, features six handmade wooden four-poster beds, a lounge area that resembles the students' common room complete with a crackling fireplace - and a kitchen where Potterheads can magic up a mug of pumpkin juice if they fancy.

Harry Potter fans can step inside their favourite wizard's world - thanks to a cottage in Yorkshire, The Dorm, that mesmerisingly mimics the Gryffindor wing of Hogwarts as seen in the movies. Pictured, the bedroom and lounge area complete with a sign stating 'Broom Parking Only'

The bathroom was inspired by the opulent prefects' washroom, located on the fifth floor of Hogwarts. There are stained glass windows, with one depicting the image of a mermaid from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

The magic continues in the bathroom - a space inspired by the opulent prefects' washroom.

Details include gold faucets, Gothic-style mirrors and shell-shaped washbasins. 

There are also stained glass windows, with one depicting the image of a mermaid from the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire movie.

The otherworldly rental property, called 'The Dorm', is part of the six-acre North Shire holiday campsite at Liverton, on the edge of the North York Moors National Park, and is the brainchild of business entrepreneur and designer Carol Cavendish, who opened the site in 2010.

The Dorm comes just 18 months after Carol created another Harry Potter-themed property called the Groundkeeper's Cottage.

The quaint stone-built cottage is a real-world version of Hagrid's Hut, which is located on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. 

Like The Dorm, it also sleeps six people. Standout features include medieval-looking turrets, mismatched stained-glass windows and a freestanding copper bathtub.

Other themed North Shire accommodation includes a Lord of the Rings-inspired hobbit house called Shire House and an old barn that has been transformed into 'Le Petit Chateau', which comprises four luxury suites.

Commenting on the latest edition to her holiday business, Carol says: 'Today, when there's so much fear around the pandemic, people are looking for ways they can step back from reality for a short time and be comforted in a world of make-believe, which is just what The Dorm aims to do, along with our other accommodation.' 

The Dorm costs £50 per night per person based on six people sharing. Visit northshire.co.uk to book.
