There was a chance meeting a couple of years back between the golden symbol of Britain's middle-distance past and one of the brightest sparks of the present. Bright in a couple of ways, actually.

It took place at Imperial College London, where Lord Coe was visiting one day to give a talk.

Spotting him on campus was a mechanical engineering student called Daniel Rowden, who had once applied to Oxford. As it happens, he rejected their offer, and that is how he came to be at Imperial when the winner of two Olympic 1500m gold medals came into view.

Daniel Rowden is one of Britain's most promising young talents in the 800m discipline

'I just randomly saw that he was doing an interview so I went up to speak to him after,' Rowden says.

'I said something about wanting to beat one of his British 800m records. He was very polite, but obviously had no reason to know who I am.'

The likelihood is he does now. Having just turned 23, Rowden has stepped out of obscurity in the past few weeks with all the suddenness and excitement of a last-bend kick.

Which in itself is appropriate, given he has been finishing races like a rocket, most obviously in Zagreb on September 15, when he blitzed the straight in a quality field and crossed the line first in 1min 44.09sec.

For folk outside the sport, the speed of those numbers might not be obvious, but in everyday English, he equalled the personal best of Steve Ovett and it was the third quickest time in the world this year. 'When it's put like that, it sounds cool,' says Rowden. 

Rowden spoke exclusively to Sportsmail having burst onto the track and field scene this year

He is one of five British men to have gone under the 1:45 line in the 800m during 2020

As a grade-seven piano player who was struggling to walk 16 months ago, and who recently used Pi to settle a debate with his coach, he has a fascinating story away from the track.

On it, he believes he can win a medal at the Tokyo Olympics as the leading male in a revived British middle-distance scene.

In 2020 alone, five British men have gone under the 1min 45sec line that identifies the 800m runners of promise, with Rowden now top and ahead of Jake Wightman, who himself is the second quickest British 1500m runner in history behind only Mo Farah.

There isn't a golden candidate in the mould of Coe, Ovett or Steve Cram, but increasingly there are global medal contenders and more depth in quality across those two distances than there has been since the Eighties.

Rowden's place in that modern landscape is the most interesting, partly because he has been an unknown outside of committed athletics circles, but also as a consequence of how bleak his situation looked in 2019 when he sat out the entire season.

The reminder of those times is the large V-shaped scar across his stomach, the legacy of a medical issue that hindered him for the better part of seven years and was not fully diagnosed until late 2018.

The straight A student has enjoyed a remarkable rise since recovering from a mystery medical illness in 2019 that has left him with a scar across his stomach

He had won a European Under 23 silver medal in 2017 and reached the senior 800m semi-finals a year later, but pushing on with the condition was impossible.

It eventually required a four-hour operation in April 2019.

'From the scar it looks like I've been bitten by a shark,' Rowden says. 'The problem started right back when I was 14 or 15. I would have an intense stomach pain, usually after a training session. I couldn't walk sometimes on the more intense days. After a time, that costs you. Over the years I visited doctor after doctor to work it out. There were no answers. A UK Athletics doctor eventually suggested MALs (median arcuate ligament syndrome).

'Basically muscles in the bottom of your diaphragm wrap around your celiac artery and for some they wrap too tightly, which restricts the blood flow. A specialist agreed and last year I went for surgery. I couldn't get out of bed for a while. It was a good eight weeks before I could jog.'

Even now, the discomfort is not entirely removed, but Rowden's progress in a truncated 2020 season was startling, culminating in that run in Zagreb and a British title win over Wightman.

Rowden has been making waves domestically since recovering from his illness

A significant element was his move a year ago to train under the former European Indoor gold medallist Matt Yates at Woodford Green in London, and alongside 1min 44.52sec runner Jamie Webb.

There are occasions when Rowden's academic and sporting worlds collide. 'One time Matt (Yates) was trying to get me to run slightly outside the centre of lane one on bends to protect my ankles,' he says. 'He put some cones down the middle of lane one and I said it didn't make any sense because it was a longer circuit.

'He said it would only be a short extra distance, and I argued that it was further than he thought.

'I used Pi to explain that it was around three metres extra a lap and six extra for the 800, so around three quarters of a second. He then got rid of the cones.'

Rowden's expectations are grand, with the belief that across the next year he can get his time down into the 1min 42sec zone that has been necessary to get on the past two Olympic podiums.

'I do think it is possible to get in the 1:42s next year,' he says. 'It would be a big jump, but I think I can. My aim is to win a medal in Tokyo.'
