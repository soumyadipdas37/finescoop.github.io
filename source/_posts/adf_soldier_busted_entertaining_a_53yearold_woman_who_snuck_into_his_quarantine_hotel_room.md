A young Australian soldier snuck a 53-year-old woman into his quarantine hotel room before both were caught and fined $1,000.

Daily Mail Australia understands the woman, who wasn't in quarantine, was staying on level one of the Pier One Hotel in Sydney's Walsh Bay when she saw the 26-year-old through his window. 

The Royal Australian Air Force soldier was having a beer in his room on the third level when he held up a sign with his phone number, telling her he was in mandatory 14-day isolation.

The woman, who was drinking at the time, then phoned the man before sneaking into his room.

Australian Defence Force officers who were in charge of security at the hotel became suspicious when they heard a female voice coming from the soldier's room.

The woman was caught by ADF officers leaving at 12.45am on Tuesday morning, before police were called. 

New South Wales Police said in a statement that the solider and the woman were fined after he 'entertained' the hotel quest.  

'The woman was directed to check-out immediately and attend a COVID testing facility before self-isolating at her Hornsby home,' the statement read. 

'The man remains in hotel quarantine and the ADF are conducting further investigations.'

NSW recorded seven new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday.

This includes four in hotel quarantine - with three overseas travellers and one returned traveller from Victoria - and two linked to a known cluster while another is still under investigation.

All passengers who were on the same flight as the infected NSW resident returning from Victoria in Sydney are in hotel quarantine.

Two of the new cases are linked to the Concord Hospital and Liverpool Hospital cluster.

Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant says authorities are concerned about a drop in testing rates - with 8835 tests conducted in the latest 24-hour reporting period, down from 9316 the previous day.

She wants daily testing back above 20,000 ahead of the school holidays which start on September 26.
