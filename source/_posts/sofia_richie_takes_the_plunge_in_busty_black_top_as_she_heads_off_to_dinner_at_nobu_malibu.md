Sofia Richie took the plunge in a busty black top when she was spotted heading off to dinner in Los Angeles this Thursday.

The 22-year-old daughter of Lionel Richie was swinging by Nobu Malibu which has become known as a Kardashian hot spot.

She reportedly recently broke up with her heartthrob beau of two years Scott Disick who shares three children with his ex Kourtney Kardashian.

When she was seen stepping out this Thursday she wore a gleaming pair of black slacks that perfectly complemented her top.

She added a splash of color to her ensemble with a pair of snakeskin print stilettos and accessorized with a pair of sunglasses.

The half-sister of Nicole Richie made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as she emerged from lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Scott and Kourtney have stayed friendly and were seen swinging by Nobu Malibu with friends and their children the very day it reopened for dine-in this June.

What a venue: She reportedly recently broke up with her heartthrob beau of two years Scott Disick who shares three children with his ex Kourtney Kardashian

This May Scott checked into rehab for 'emotional issues' and 'past traumas,' but checked out shortly thereafter. 

In the wake of his decision to leave rehab Us Weekly reported he and Sofia were 'on a break until Scott straightens himself out more.'

Finally on May 27, the day after his 37th birthday, the magazine revealed that Scott and Sofia had decided to end their romance.

Sofia was seen spending time with Scott in July and there were rumors they may have reignited their relationship.

The dynamic duo spent Independence Day together and a People source said in mid-July that they are 'trying to make things work while taking things slow.'

But in early August an Us Weekly source: 'Scott and Sofia have simmered down a little and Scott has been making a big effort to refocus on himself and his family.'

By mid-August an E! News insider said: 'They have been off and on for two months. Sofia really pushed to make things work between them after they initially broke up, but Scott officially called it off recently and they are no longer speaking.'

Meanwhile a source recently told TMZ that Scott and Kourtney 'are not a couple, even though they've been hanging out more since his breakup with Sofia.' 

Dampening hopes of a reunion even further the insider shared: 'It's highly unlikely Scott and Kourtney will ever get back together as a couple. They still consider themselves a family and co-parenting their three children is a priority for both.'
