Premier Daniel Andrews has been urged to sack his 'clueless' health minister over her handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Jenny Mikakos has escaped relatively unscathed from the mounting public backlash against the Andrews government - until now.

But on Wednesday night, Health Workers Union boss Diana Asmar insisted Mr Andrews has no choice but to demand her resignation over the state's crisis and her 'breathtaking incompetence'. 

Victoria was hit with an unprecedented second wave of COVID-19, where daily infections soared beyond 700 at the peak.

An inquiry is now underway into the failures of the mandatory hotel quarantine system and whether the government could have done anything differently to avoid the outbreak.

'For the good of your government, for the good of health workers I represent, and for the good of all Victorians, Ms Mikakos must go,' Ms Asmar wrote in a letter to Mr Andrews on Wednesday, Herald Sun reported.

Ms Asmar said that throughout the pandemic, 'not once has she displayed even a basic understanding of her portfolio.' 

According to the letter, Ms Mikakos was warned further deaths in aged care homes were imminent given the lack of supplies, and added that the 16,000-strong union would not support Labor at the next election.  

The 14-day new case average for Melbourne also dropped below 30 to 29.4, while it is down to 1.1 for regional areas

'This is entirely about Ms Mikakos’ competence as your Health Minister, which is at the heart of your government’s response to this current pandemic,' she said.

Ms Asmar warned 'all Victorians' are now paying the price for Ms Mikakos' 'utterly dysfunctional... incompetence.'   

Mr Andrews is yet to publicly address the letter.   

He let it slip that Victoria's restrictions could be eased even quicker than he set out in the state's 'roadmap to recovery'. 

As the crucial 14-day average for new cases dropped below 30 for Melbourne, the premier was asked if the government might go further than planned on Sunday, when any relaxing of restrictions are set to be announced.

Even at anti lockdown protests, like this one in Melbourne on September 19, people still wore masks while refusing to cooperate with the lockdown orders

'Yes, I am. But I'm not in a position to give you the full list of what we're looking at,' Mr Andrews replied at Wednesday's press conference.

Victoria reported another five coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, taking the state toll to 771 and the national figure to 859, as new cases dropped to 15.

The 14-day new case average for Melbourne also dropped below 30 to 29.4, while it is down to 1.1 for regional areas. 

There was also good news on cases with an unknown source over 14 days, with that figure dropping to 41 in Melbourne.

There are none in regional Victoria.

Authorities want Melbourne's new case average between 30 and 50 before they consider easing restrictions next Monday, with an announcement expected on Sunday.

Some Melbourne measures were eased on September 14.

Under the government roadmap's September 28 changes announced earlier this month, public gatherings would be allowed for five people from two households. 

Schools, childcare and some workplaces would open, along with outdoor pools, while personal trainers could operate with two clients.

There could be outdoor religious services for up to five people, plus a leader. 

Mr Andrews also clarified rules around Melbourne residents who worked in regional areas, given the difference in coronavirus restrictions. 

They must have a valid worker's permit and they must comply with Melbourne's stricter measures.

For example, a Melbourne worker cannot go to a regional restaurant for a meal.
