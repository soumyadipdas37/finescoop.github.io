A support worker claims she has the UK's most pampered cat - a bald Sphynx feline rides in a pram, has a car seat and even shares bubble baths with her. 

Billie Jo Miller, 30, from Nottingham, records the life of four-year-old Frank enjoying a life of luxury with her and her housemate Lee Taylor, proving you don't need fur to be fabulous. 

The 'clingy' cat never likes to leave his owner's side and is treated to gluten-free dinners, massages and even wears a dickie bow. 

Spinal and brain injury care specialist Billie Jo became the unusual-looking pet's 'adoptive mum' after looking after him while her pal Lee moved house. 

Now the duo share Frank as a mutual pet and hilarious photos show the range of outfits that the cat sports to avoid getting 'sunburn' while out and about. 

Is this the UK's most pampered cat? Billie Jo Miller, from Nottingham,30, loves to spoil her Sphynx cat Frank, four. Pictured: the cat neck-deep in bathwater and bubbles as his wrinkly skin enjoys a soak alongside her last Tuesday

Billie Jo said: 'He's probably the most pampered cat. 

'He jumped in when I was already in the bath and had been for a while. He's such a clingy cat and doesn't leave my side. 

'He still didn't look happy after it. I think it was because I'd been in there for so long - he got bored.'

I sent this picture to Lee and saidm "How close is too close?". 

Frank is no ordinary cat and can be a bit 'clingy' Billie Joe admitted. Here he's pictured making himself at home in a box on top of the cooker

Do you like my style? Pampered Frank has his own stylish wardrobe, completed with a dickie bow that he wears around the house 

'He's always laughing because I've also got a chihuahua, Moo, that doesn't like walking because the grass is bigger than him, so I bought them both a stroller and my friend was like "you're going too far now"!'

The diva cat has also been treated to a wardrobe full of clothes, which he wears to avoid getting his pink skin sunburned. Mum-of-one Billie Jo even bought him a stroller and car seat for the days he spends at her house. 

Billie Jo said: 'I don’t think you ever really own a cat, they own you. We’ve never formally discussed who owns him if I’m honest we just refer to him as our cat.

Because Frank has no fur, he cannot go outside like a 'normal cat,' Billie Jo explained, because he's sensitive to UV rays so he could get sunburn or also suffer frostbite

'[Frank's] quite high maintenance. He stays with me more now than he does with my friend. 

'Frank can't go outside like a normal cat because he's sensitive to UV rays so he could get sunburn or also frostbite. 

They're indoor cats. 'He's got a whole wardrobe full of clothes because he gets too cold. 

'He has his own car seat, a stroller and he bathes with me sometimes. 

'Frank's also gluten [intolerant] so I'll be making him a gluten-free birthday cake too. 'Part of it's a little bit extra on my part. 

Lee and Billie Jo have been sharing Frank ever since Lee moved in with Bille Jo. The pair like to take pictures of the cat's luxury lifestyle

Doting cat mum Billie Jo lets Frank sleep in her bed and loves to hive him massages every once in a while 

'You don't need to give them massages but he does get one. 

'You have to really keep on top of them. They can come across a lot of problems if you don't look after them properly. 

'He has to have weekly baths. They've got no fur so they get dusty and secrete oils.

'You get them used to water when they're very young because they have to have such regular baths and you have to put cotton buds down their ears and get between their toes. 

'They're a genetic mutation at the end of the day.'

It's Bat Cat! On top of gluten free dinners, bubble baths and massages, The Sphynx cat even has his own superhero costume.

Frank has a very stylish wardrobe, with floral shirts and camo jumpers. Billie Jo admitted she could be quite 'extra'
