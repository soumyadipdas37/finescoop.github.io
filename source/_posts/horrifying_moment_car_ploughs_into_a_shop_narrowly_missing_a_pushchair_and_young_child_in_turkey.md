This is the horrifying moment that a car ploughed into a shop in southeastern Turkey, narrowly missing two children. 

CCTV footage captured the moment the car slammed into the shop in Gaziantep after its driver lost control today. 

The car barely misses two children whose parents were shopping in the area.

Three people were injured and rushed to the hospital, according to Demirören news agency.   

At the beginning of the clip, three adults can be seen standing outside a store with a young child standing near a second child in a pushchair. 

A white car loses control, driving towards the shop on the pavement before slamming into its stock and store front.

The car appears to hit the three adults as well as the stock on the pavement outside the shop.

It narrowly misses the pushchair and young child, who runs into the road away from the incident. 

Pedestrians and passengers from passing cars who witnessed the incident run towards the car.

One car passenger opens the door of the vehicle before it has stopped moving and climbs out.  

One man pulls the young child and pushchair away from the crowd. 

At the end of the clip, CCTV from inside the shop shows a worker serving a customer moments before the car ploughs through the window. 

The worker then begins moving pieces of broken glass and rubble to free a pedestrian who has been hit by the car.
