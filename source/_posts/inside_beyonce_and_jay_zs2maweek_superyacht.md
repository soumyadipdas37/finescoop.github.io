Beyonce rang in her 39th birthday in style last week on board a luxury liner with her husband and children. 

The Grammy-winning singer has been cruising around the coast of Cavtat, Croatia with Jay-Z, their daughter Blue Ivy, eight, and three-year-old twins Rumi and Suri. 

Travelling in true A-list style, the family have been on the new Benetti-built superyacht LANA, which costs an eye-watering $2 million a week to rent.

The 351-foot long and 45-foot high luxurious yacht is one of the most impressive liners on the water currently, and is even longer than a football pitch. 

The vessel boasts a stunning exterior design with spacious social areas, ample lounges and cozy salons in a soft colour palette to create a sense of 'serenity' among the VIP guests.  

The design of the liner is meant to mimic the 'motion and fluidity' of the sea, with incredible high ceilings being the product of fine Italian craftsmanship and attention to detail.

The singer was no doubt pleased to have a relaxing getaway, as despite the pandemic, she has remained busy these last few months with the release of her visual album Black Is King.

Black Is King was initially intended to be a companion piece to Beyonce's songs from The Lion King, but took on new meaning following the recent reckoning on racial injustice.

'The events of 2020 have made the film's vision and message even more relevant, as people across the world embark on a historic journey. We are all in search of safety and light,' she wrote on Instagram.

'Many of us want change. I believe that when Black people tell our own stories, we can shift the axis of the world and tell our REAL history of generational wealth and richness of soul that are not told in our history books.'

The film boasted a star-studded cast including Lupita Nyong'o and Naomi Campbell, however had a disappointing debut weekend on Disney +, according to data analyzed by Yahoo! Finance.

The film was described by Disney as 'a celebratory memoir for the world on the Black experience'.
