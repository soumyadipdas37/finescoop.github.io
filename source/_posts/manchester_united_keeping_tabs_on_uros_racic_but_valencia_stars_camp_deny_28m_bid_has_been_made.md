Manchester United are monitoring Valencia star Uros Racic but have not made an offer for the midfielder, according to reports in Spain.

The Sun claim United are weighing up a £28million (€30m) move for the Serbian and are hopeful that fee will be sufficient due to the Valencia's financial problems.

But Valencia-based journalist Hector Gomez reports that while United's interest in Racic is very real, his camp have denied any bid for the 22-year-old - who has a £92million release clause in his contract at the Spanish outfit - being placed.

'Racic's camp confirm interest from Manchester United for the player but NOT the €30m offer. Let's see if there really is a final offer or if it only remains as interest,' Gomez tweeted.

A box-to-box midfielder, the 22-year-old central midfielder is known for adding defensive power and a tireless work ethic to the team.

The Sun also report he is equally adept with his feet and is not opposed to the idea of shooting with either foot, and idolises current United star Paul Pogba. 

The Serbian starlet made his first senior appearance for Valencia off the bench in their 4-2 La Liga win against Levante on Sunday.

But he has generally failed to settle in Valencia after joining the La Liga outfit from Red Star Belgrade in the summer of 2018.

He has been out on loan spells since arriving at the Mestalla, last season turning out for both Famalicao in Portugal and Spanish outfit Tenerife.

But should he arrive at United he will provide further competition to compatriot Nemanja Matic in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s crowded midfield.

As revealed by Sportsmail on Monday, United are also eyeing a dramatic swoop for Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale.

The Red Devils' hopes of landing first-choice target Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund appear to be fading, leading them to turn to Madrid outcast Bale who could arrive on a season-long loan.
