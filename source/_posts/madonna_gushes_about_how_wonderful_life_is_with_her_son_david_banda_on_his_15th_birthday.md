David was the first child Madonna adopted - having fell in love with the 13-month-old boy, who was sick with pneumonia, when she discovered him in 2006 at a Malawi orphanage she partially funded.

His adoption was finalized in 2008 after much controversy over the fact that the Levitating songstress had not lived in the African country for at least a year, which is reportedly a requirement for adoptive parents.
