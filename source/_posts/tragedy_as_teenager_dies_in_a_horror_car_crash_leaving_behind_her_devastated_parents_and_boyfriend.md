A teenager has left behind her devastated family and devoted boyfriend after tragically crashing into a tree near her home.   

Laura Hall, 19, died in a horror car accident about 11km west of Cummins, on the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia, just before 7am last Wednesday. 

Ms Hall was less than one kilometre away from her family home when her ute swerved off Warrow Road and smashed into the tree.   

The teenager is survived by her loving parents Cliff and Brigette, her two brothers Jared and Issac and her boyfriend Evan, The Advertiser reported.

Devastated friends and family members have paid tribute to the teenager on social media.  

Ms Hall's aunt, Danielle Crosby, remembered her nice as a 'beautiful girl'.

'You will be so sadly missed, 19 is just too young.   

'Forever in our hearts! Flying high with the angels, till we meet again,' she wrote. 

Ms Hall was an active member in her local community, who played netball for the Ramblers, and won the secondary school division of the National Merino Challenge in 2018. 

Laura was also awarded a $5000 scholarship to pursue her agricultural science degree at the University of Adelaide last year. 

'It's hard to even put into words, such a beautiful young woman taken too soon. Such fond memories of Laura. 

'Our thoughts and love are with you Brigette, Cliff and family,' one tribute read.

'I will remember Laura as a polite young netball player and as a coach she did everything asked of her,' Ms Hall's former netball coach said. 

The teenager's family have asked for donations to be made to Mentally Fit EP, a local mental health support charity, in her memory.      

A private funeral will be held for Ms Hall next Tuesday in Cummins at 2pm.    

'Deepest sympathy and love to you all. 

'Just the biggest tragedy, such a beautiful life taken much too soon. There are no words,' another mourner wrote.    

SA Police said Ms Hall died before emergency services arrived on the scene.

Major Crash Officers from Adelaide were also flown to the site to investigate the circumstances surrounding the crash.  

Ms Hall was the 66th life to be lost on South Australian roads this year.
