Despite the painful ordeal, Katie also took to Instagram Stories on Tuesday to reveal her feet are finally on the mend, as she shared a video of her plaster-free legs perched on her car's dashboard.

She wrote: 'Trying to wiggle my toes, my feet still swollen but I'm getting better, still no walking or standing allowed though.' 

On Saturday Katie took to Instagram to share a snap from her wheelchair as she reflected on her 'tough journey' and reassured fans she's 'feeling stronger and determined' on Saturday.

One week earlier, Katie announced that she was taking a break from social media to heal after breaking both her feet and ankles in a horror accident.

Katie shared a recent snap of her sat in her wheelchair with her booted feet, and wrote: 'Happy Saturday. I’m back online and just want to thank everyone for all the love and support! 

'It’s a tough journey, but I’m feeling stronger and determined to get through this with all the support of my family, friends, followers and my amazing man @carljwoods.

'Carl and I will be posting a lot more content together on our joint page @adventuresofkatieandcarl and look out for our new YouTube travel channel coming very soon.'

Mere hours later Katie went onto share a loved-up snap with her beau Carl and penned the caption: 'Saturday Vibes with my prince @carljwoods.'  

It comes after Katie revealed she feared that her horrific foot injury would leave her 'paralysed,' after she plummeted 25ft off a wall at a theme park in Turkey and landed on her feet.

Katie explained how her feet are 'destroyed' following the incident, and admitted she has returned to The Priory to learn to 'walk again.'

The star, who was on holiday with her boyfriend Carl and her children Princess, 13, and Junior, 15, at the time, said doctors told her they have amputated legs with injuries similar to hers.

Speaking to The Sun, she said: 'The doctors said I'm lucky I'm not dead. I could have hit my head and I could have been paralysed, I am actually lucky I landed on my feet.'

She added: 'I thought, "I'm never going to walk again". The doctors said they've cut off legs before after seeing injuries like mine.'

Katie underwent an eight-hour operation to rebuild her feet after she was 'mucking about' following a few drinks and jumped off what she thought was a 'small wall' at the Land of Legends theme park. 

The model revealed how she has returned to The Priory because her 'mental health' has been 'badly affected' by her injuries.  

Take a break: The-mother-of-five announced the week before that she was following doctor's orders and taking a break from social media to heal following the horrific injuries 

She last visited The Priory in September 2018 and spent 28 days in the facility after her family urged her to seek help following wild partying antics in Mallorca. 

It comes as the star revealed how 'everything' has hit her 'so hard' and she feels 'humiliated' at the prospect of having to learn to 'walk again'.

She spoke of how everyday tasks are 'impossible' including going to the toilet, cooking, reaching for the cupboards and taking a bath where she could 'drown'.

Katie, who is also mother to Harvey, 18, Jett, seven, and Bunny, six, explained how she is 'embarrassed' of having to be pushed around and told how people treat her 'differently'.   

She explained how she 'feels sorry' for boyfriend Carl who has doted on her since the accident and said that it is 'demoralising' seeing him push her in the wheelchair.

But the CBB star described how she would be 'lost' without her beau and revealed how she can still 'keep Carl happy in the bedroom' with him having 'no complaints'. 

However Katie also vowed that she is 'never drinking again' following the traumatising accident and plans to cover up her 'mangled' feet with tattoos.
