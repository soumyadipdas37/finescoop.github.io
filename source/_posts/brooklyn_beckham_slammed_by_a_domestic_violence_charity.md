Brooklyn Beckham has been slammed by a domestic violence charity after a picture was shared on Instagram of him holding his fiancée Nicola Peltz's neck.

In the snap posted earlier this week, David Beckham's eldest son, 21, flashed his tattooed arms as he held the actress, 25, by the neck while drinking wine at dinner.

The founder of KWRO Women's Rights Organisation said it was 'disgusting' to share online and believes it is a mistake to turn such a serious matter into a joke.

Concerns: Brooklyn Beckham has been slammed by a domestic violence charity after a picture was shared on Instagram of him holding his fiancée Nicola Peltz's neck (pictured)

Founder Dianna Nammi admitted she thinks the picture should be deleted from Instagram and the couple should be forced to publicly apologise.  

KWRO is a charity that campaigns against issues such as domestic violence, honour-based violence and forced marriage.

Reacting to the picture of Brooklyn holding Nicola by the throat, which was posted by the Bates Motel star, Ms Nammi said: 'It is disgusting and I think with serious matters no one should allow themselves to make a joke.

'This is very important, an organisation like ours has seen so many women become victims of honour based violence, domestic violence, forced marriage - and they have been strangled by their own family and they have been killed by husbands, partners or boyfriends.

'So we are talking about real life, even if it's a joke it is disgusting in my opinion. I think it should be banned from Instagram this kind of picture. He is 21 so mature enough to know it is a very serious matter and I think he has to apologise openly and tell people that he made a huge mistake.

'We are talking about living people - it is not a doll to play with, so I think this is sending a very wrong message, a very dangerous message to young people especially.

'This kind of attitude is not acceptable and both men and women, especially women, need to be respected and their life needs to be celebrated.

'It is so dangerous and his position is so important and not only him but his family need to discuss it to say something in the media that they are not that approving of that, because of their position especially.

'In his position he should not do it at all and not even be thinking about that and I could not believe this kind of thing has happened. He is mature enough, he is not a baby playing with a doll.

'We are talking about an adult man talking about his girlfriend - and his girlfriend definitely must not accept that. I urge them to put a message of apology on Instagram and Twitter and everywhere on the media for their wrongdoing.

'People like us fighting on a daily basis, talking in schools, trying to educate people about the issues of domestic violence and how to have a healthy relationship.

'On a daily basis we are trying to bring these things to the school curriculum - for example healthy relationships need to be educated to people - but one message from an irresponsible like him gives a very big message to the whole world and this is so dangerous.

'I think he has to really learn how to treat women, he has to go to healthy relationship education courses and learn how to act as a responsible human being.'

Citing the honour killing of Banaz Mahmoud - whose brutal honour killing was recently portrayed in a two-part ITV drama - she added: 'We have had cases in the past, Banaz Mahmoud was one of those case for example - she was strangled by a family member because she had a boyfriend.

'There are so many cases like that and people who are still at risk of being killed by their own family members.

'And people like him should be a role model for positive change.

'It is a really bad picture and he has to apologise to the public for such a dangerous message to the world and his followers.'

MailOnline reached out to representatives for Brooklyn and Nicola for comment.  

The photograph also caught the attention of Brooklyn's fans, who were alarmed by the way he clutched her throat. Some warned it could normalise domestic and sexual violence to their combined Instagram following of more than 14million people.

Jaye Taylor said: 'Every girlfriend he has had there are photos of him holding them round the neck. Even when he puts his arm around them it's really tight and looks like a headlock.

'Really odd the way he's never pictured with any male friends just his gfs who he falls in love with in two mins and then holds them by the throats etc.'

What's going on? The photograph also caught the attention of Brooklyn's fans, who were alarmed by the way he clutched her throat.

Jordan Moral asked: 'Why is he choking you though?'

Another user echoed Jordan, saying: 'Why is he choking you?'

A disturbed fan added: 'You all into some freaky s**t.'

The celebrity couple were at it again last week, when Nicola uploaded a black and white snap of her holding a topless Brooklyn by the throat while his face is covered in shaving cream.

She captioned the snap: 'i love you more everyday.'

Brooklyn replied: 'I'm the luckiest boy in the world to have you by my side.'
