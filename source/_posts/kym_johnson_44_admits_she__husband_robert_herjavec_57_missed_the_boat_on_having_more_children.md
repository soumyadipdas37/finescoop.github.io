Dancing With The Stars' Kym Johnson is a doting mother to her children, twins Haven and Hudson, two.  

But on Thursday, the professional dancer, 44, admitted that she and her billionaire husband, Robert Herjavec, 57, won't be having anymore children.  

Australian personality Kym appeared on The Morning Show via a live cross and said that that age is the reason why they're not expanding their brood. 

'Maybe if we were younger!' Dancing With The Stars' Kym Johnson, 44, admitted on The Morning Show this week that she and her billionaire husband Robert Herjavec, 57, 'have missed the boat' on having more children. They're pictured with their twins Hudson and Haven

'If we were younger, definitely, but I think we have missed that boat,' she said.

'But we're not going to have any more kids even though we would probably like to,' she added.  

The Sydney-born beauty told hosts Larry Emdur and Kylie Gillies that she and her husband are lucky to have two healthy children.

Robert, who is a Canadian businessman and an investor on the show Shark Tank, also made an appearance on the morning program along with their cherubic twins. 

Elsewhere in the interview, Kym revealed that she and Robert have spoken about relocating to Australia. 

She said that because his company, cyber security firm Herjavec Group, is based in the US, they can't move Down Under yet.

But Kym optimistically added that it could happen in the future.

She also revealed that their plans to be back home with family and friends for Christmas was ruined thanks to the pandemic. 

'We were going to come back for Christmas, but I can't quarantine with two babies in a hotel room for two weeks,' she explained.

Kym and Robert welcomed their twins in 2018. 

The couple married in 2016, a year after meeting on the US version of Dancing With The Stars where they were first paired up.
