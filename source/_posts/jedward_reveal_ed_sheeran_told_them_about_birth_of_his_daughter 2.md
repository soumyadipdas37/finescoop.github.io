Ed Sheeran and his wife Cherry Seaborn announced the birth of their daughter Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran, on Tuesday morning. 

And just an hour later, Jedward, both 28, took to Twitter to share their congratulations and revealed that the singer, 29, had in fact told them his happy baby news via DM the day before his public announcement.

The Irish twins shared a screengrab of the sweet message from Ed, which had been sent to them in a private Instagram message on Monday afternoon, adding that they: 'kept it a secret obviously.'

What!? Jedward took to Twitter on Tuesday, where they revealed that Ed Sheeran, 29, had told them about the birth of his daughter Lyra via DM a day before publicly announcing her arrival

Ed had sent Jedward - whose real names are John and Edward Grimes - a direct message on Instagram, on Monday afternoon, to tell them his happy news ahead of announcing it to the world.

He wrote: 'I love you guys. Sorry I've been off socials for so long, just popping in to tell you you're awesome and hope to see you soon! I've got a daughter now by the way, you're gonna love her Xxx.'

Sharing a screengrab of the message to Twitter on Tuesday morning, Jedward tweeted: 'Hi Twitter @Edsheeran has some news for you and us. We kept it a secret obviously. Welcome Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran.'

The unlikely friendship began  a few years back, when they all happened to be in Toronto, Canada at the same time, and Ed realised who they were. 

Happy news: Ed and wife Cherry Seaborn announced the birth of daughter Lyra Antarctica to the world with a sweet Instagram post on Tuesday morning

Proof! Ed had sent Jedward a direct message on Instagram, on Monday afternoon. The duo shared a screengrab to Twitter on Tuesday as they celebrated the news

 

'So I shouted out to them, 'Jedward' and took them in my car and we went to my hotel,' Ed told the Irish Sun in 2017.

'Then they just started being Jedward and buying Justin Timberlake vinyls on eBay, like loads of them at once.'

At one point the Grammy winner also claimed: 'If an EDM collab would happen with anyone it would happen with Jedward.

'I love Jedward, it's like a puppy, there is no way you can dislike Jedward,' asserted the superstar singer. 

In April 2017, the famous twins to took to Instagram where they shared a fun video of themselves larking about with Ed, proving that the friendship was real. 

Ed took to Instagram on Tuesday morning, sharing a picture of Lyra's booties and a colourful blanket and revealed Cherry gave birth last week. 

He wrote: 'Ello! A quick message from me as I have some personal news that I wanted to share with you... 

'Last week, with the help of an amazing delivery team, Cherry gave birth to our beautiful and healthy daughter - Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran. 

'We are completely in love with her. Both mum and baby are doing amazing and we are on cloud nine over here. 

'We hope that you can respect our privacy at this time. Lots of love and I'll see you when it's time to come back, Ed x.'

Baby news: Ed and Cherry first met at school and were able to keep the pregnancy quiet during the global COVID-19 lockdown

'Best books ever': Ed tweeted about his love for the Pulllman trilogy back in 2015

It's been claimed that the name was inspired by the main character in Ed's favourite book series, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials. 

Lyra Belacqua, also known as Lyra Silvertongue, is the heroine of Pullman's trilogy.  

Lyra is a young girl who inhabits a parallel universe and finds herself embroiled in a cosmic war between Lord Asriel on the one side, and the first angel to come into being, called The Authority, and his Regent, called Metatron, on the other. 

In 2015, Ed tweeted: '[By] far, Philip Pullman - his dark materials are the best books I've ever read.'

The couple have been together for five years, with Ed confirming last summer that he and Cherry, 28, tied the knot in a private ceremony in January 2019. 

Singer Ed first revealed Cherry was his wife in an interview with Charlamagne The God to promote his album No.6 Collaborations Project.

After Charlamagne The God asked about lyrics on the album which refer to the singer's 'wife', Ed admitted that he wrote the words before the couple tied the knot, but he 'knew that we'd be married' by the point that the song came out. 

The Grammy winner and Cherry wed in a ceremony that saw just 40 close friends and family in attendance, according to a report in The Sun.  

Popped the question: Ed announced his engagement to Cherry, 26, in January 2018 with a candid Instagram snap

Ed announced his engagement to Cherry in January 2018 with a candid Instagram snap, gushing to fans: 'Got myself a fiancée just before new year. We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well xx'

The couple are thought to have started dating in 2015, with Ed's best pal Taylor Swift sharing a photo of the pair kissing on her Instagram account.

Ed and Cherry first met as children when they both attended Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham, Suffolk. 

But Cherry moved to the US for university, meaning the friends lost touch. After working on Wall Street, she moved back to the UK in 2016 to be with Ed.  

During his candid 2019 interview with Charlamagne The God, Ed spoke about the sacrifices he would be willing to make for Cherry and their future family.
