They tied the knot back in a romantic ceremony back in December 2016, following three years of dating.

And Margot Robbie and her husband Tom Ackerley, both 30, looked as smitten as ever on Friday, when they were spotted enjoying a relaxed stroll in London.

The Australian actress donned a protective face mask as she walked alongside her handsome British husband, who guided their beloved pooch Boo Radley via a leash.

The Suicide Squad star looked casually cool for the outing, wearing a baggy white sweater, which she teamed with cropped faded jeans.

With her flat brown sandals perfectly matching her large leather handbag the screen star accessorised with a chunky necklace and stylish sunglasses.

Wearing her golden tresses in tousled waves, Margot looked relaxed and happy as she strolled with producer Tom, who donned a taupe windbreaker with khaki shorts.

Strolling arm-in-arm through the English capital's busting streets with their rescue dog, the couple enjoyed lunch together before making their way home. 

Margot and Tom have been married since 2016, after first meeting in 2013 on set of World War II drama Suite Française in France.

The pair went on to become roommates, with a group of other friends, as they lived together in a property in London.

In an interview with Elle back in 2018, blonde beauty Margot admitted that she and Tom had initially decided to keep their romantic relationship to themselves.

She said: 'We kept it a secret. Because we weren't really taking it seriously. "Oh, whatever, we're just mates, we're just mates." And then… everyone found out.'

And their reluctance to reveal that they were dating appeared to be for good reason, as the screen star went on to admit that the revelation didn't go down too well.

'It was dramatic,' she recalled of the moment her friends found out. 'I'm not going into the details, but s**t hit the fan.

'Our house turned into The Jerry Springer Show for a moment there. But then the dust settled, and it was all good.'

In February, Margot, who splits time between the US and the UK with Tom – in between all of their other travels – opened up about her hectic life with her beau.

She told The Project host Carrie Bickmore: 'My mom is like, "You have got to leave work at work, so you guys can have time for yourselves."'

She added: 'We don't get as much downtime as we'd probably like, but we both really like what we do!

'We don't have time for chill, but we have a lot of fun and we love what we do.'
