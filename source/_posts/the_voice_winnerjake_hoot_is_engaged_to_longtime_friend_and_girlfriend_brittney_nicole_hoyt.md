Jake Hoot is engaged to longtime friend and girlfriend of six-months, Brittney Nicole Hoyt, 32.

The 32-year-old winner of The Voice orchestrated a 'surprise' proposal on September 20 that took place in Hoyt's hometown of Phoenix, Arizona and included her closest family members.  

'I knew how important being around family was to Britt, and with her birthday coming up, I knew it would be the perfect time to do it!' explained Hoot to People on Tuesday. 

'[Brittney is] one of seven, so arranging everyone to fly in and it still be a surprise was tough, but we all coordinated how it would happen, and it went off without a hitch!'

Despite his best efforts, Brittney caught on to Jake's plan when she noticed her family was waiting around idly at the proposal location. 

Jake said that Brittney totally 'lost it' once the reality of the situation finally set in.

'I had to keep her moving forward because she was crying and trying to fall down on me! Then after I popped the question, we were both so emotional that I almost had to wrestle her arm to put the ring on her hand!' recalled the musician.

Brittney, who happens to run the nonprofit The Radiant Initiative, could not help but gush over her stunning engagement ring, which she described to the outlet as her 'dream ring.'

'A striking oval diamond with small dainty diamonds all around the band. It's more than I could've ever dreamed of.'

The pair originally met seven years ago, while performing as wedding singers at a mutual pal's wedding, but they, eventually, 'went [their] separate ways.'

They were then 'brought back into each other's lives while doing missions in Nicaragua' and Hoot said that that trip made him realize Hoyt was bound to be his wife. 

'Her heart for others and love for God made me fall in love with her. I'm so glad God blessed the broken road that brought us back around to each other numerous times!' he gushed.

Brittney admitted that she 'also knew when [they] reconnected in Nicaragua' that they belonged in one another's lives romantically.

'Jake and I had known each other for years, even though I had always loved many things about him, it always felt like the right person, wrong time. It was a love out of time,' explained Hoyt to People.

'This time in Nicaragua it was as though the blinders fell off my eyes, he was the right person, right time. I love Jake's heart for the Lord, how consistent he is no matter who he is around, I love his heart for missions, the poor, I love his humility, his integrity, I knew he was someone I could build a life with.'

Jake, who won the seventeenth season of the singing competition series The Voice in 2019, happens to share a five-year-old daughter named Macy with ex wife Jessica Lynn Steele.

He recalled asking Macy 'numerous times' about what she thought of his plans to marry Brittney and he claim that 'she has told [him] yes.' 

Hoot could hardly contain himself as he expressed his excitement over what the future holds for himself and his bride-to-be.

'Growing old with my best friend, sharing all the highs and lows, slow dancing every day, doing missions together, and expanding our family,' he said.

Brittney mirrored her fiance's statement as she opened up about what excites her about their love-filled relationship.

The future: 'Growing old with my best friend, sharing all the highs and lows, slow dancing every day, doing missions together, and expanding our family,' gushed Jake to People

'I'm so excited to spend every day with my very best friend! I love the day-to-day chores as much as the high, fun exciting moments that life brings to us,' she admitted.

'I'm excited to buy a house, build a family, travel, do missions, make music and love each other for the rest of our life.'

With the engagement so fresh, the pair did not have any set wedding plans to discuss, but Jake did tell People that he has 'been writing a lot, and working on an upcoming album that is set to release in November.'

He added: 'Also have been spending time with Brittney and Macy!'
