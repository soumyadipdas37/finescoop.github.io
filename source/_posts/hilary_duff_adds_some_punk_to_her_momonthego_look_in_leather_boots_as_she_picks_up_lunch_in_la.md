Hilary Duff has been spending plenty of quality family time with her husband and kids during quarantine.

But the former Disney star is ready to get back to her routine, as Hollywood bounces back from the COVID-19 pandemic.

She added some punk to her mom-on-the-go look, as she grabbed lunch at an Italian deli in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles, during a busy day of errands.

The 32-year-old donned a plain white v-neck t-shirt, tied at the waist, with a mid-length satin grey cheetah print skirt.

She accessorized with diamond hoop earrings, a silver watch, silver and gold rings and a black face mask.

Hilary carried a quilted black leather handbag on a gold chain, strapped across her chest, as she grabbed her takeout.

She finished the ensemble with a pair of maroon leather Gucci boots, featuring large gold-encrusted jewels on the strap, paired with shimmering black and gold socks.

She's preparing to return to the set of Younger in a few weeks, after COVID-19 forced production to shutdown on the seventh (and likely last) season back in March.

Creator Darren Starr told TVLine earlier this week: 'We are unofficially planning [Season 7] as a final season.' 

But a spinoff based on Hilary's book publisher character Kelsey Peters was announced in development back in May.

Meanwhile, the fate of Hilary's Lizzie McGuire reboot, which hit a snag in production back in January, is still up in the air. 

After filming two episodes, original show creator Terri Minsky exited the project as showrunner, over apparent disagreements with Disney+ over the mature nature of some of the content.

Hilary updated E! News back in July: 'We are very much still in conversation with them a couple of times a week, which is really nice.

High hopes: Hilary updated E! News back in July: 'We are very much still in conversation with them a couple of times a week, which is really nice... I have high hopes that we are going to make it work'

'We started shooting, and then obviously that got on hold for a couple of different reasons not involving the pandemic, but you know what, I have high hopes that we are going to make it work.' 

The So Yesterday artist has also suggest moving the show to Hulu, so that the show can grown with its fanbase for a more authentic adult experience.

She added: 'It's like a responsibility to [Lizzie], honoring her and the fanbase that grew up with her. We kind of put her on pause, and had to go back to the drawing board, but I feel optimistic that it will happen.'

Hilary starred as the titular preteen girl on the Disney Channel show, which originally ran for two seasons, from 2001 to 2004, also sparking a 2003 movie, which got a wide theatrical release.
