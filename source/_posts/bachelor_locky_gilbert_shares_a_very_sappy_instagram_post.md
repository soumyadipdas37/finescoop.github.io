Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert chose Irena Srbinovska as his winning contestant during The Bachelor's emotional finale on Thursday.

And a day later, the 31-year-old tattooed hunk revelled in their newfound love, sharing a very sappy post to his Instagram feed.

Alongside several photos of the pair next to a campervan in the outdoors, Locky told his fans that he's 'so happy right now' and has 'everything he'll ever need'.

'Yep I'm set, everything I'll ever need right here. Van, bike, swag, girlfriend and the outdoors,' Locky wrote in the caption, alongside the hashtag 'so happy right now'.   

In the photos, the former Australian Survivor star could not wipe the smile off his face as he enjoyed quality one-on-one time with Irena, 31.

One particular shot saw a casually dressed Locky wrapping his arms around Irena's slender frame, as they stood beside the campervan.

Irena, 31, looked equally ecstatic to finally be able to go public with their romance.  

Just hours prior on Thursday, a conflicted Locky chose Irena as his winning contestant during The Bachelor's emotional finale.

'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told her.

'When I think about our future together, I'm so excited and I can't wait to just travel the world and make all your dreams come true.

'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.' 

Moments earlier, he'd delivered the bad news to runner-up Bella Varelis - despite having told her beforehand that he was 'falling in love' with her.
