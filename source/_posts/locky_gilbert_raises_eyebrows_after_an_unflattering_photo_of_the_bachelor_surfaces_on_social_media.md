The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert is known for his adventurous side, with a penchant for skydiving, riding motorbikes and even taking part in Survivor Australia.

But on Wednesday, fans saw a different side to the 30-year-old hunk, after an unflattering photo of the thrillseeker emerged on social media.

The old image was of Locky in the back of a van resting on his front on a mattress, wearing just a pair of fitted briefs.

He told the ladies: 'It's just television. And your health and safety is far, far more important and is far more of a priority. Look after yourselves. I'll see you as soon as we're back.'

The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel Ten

Health and safety: : 'It's just television. And your health and safety is far, far more important and is far more of a priority. Look after yourselves. I'll see you as soon as we're back,' Osher said
