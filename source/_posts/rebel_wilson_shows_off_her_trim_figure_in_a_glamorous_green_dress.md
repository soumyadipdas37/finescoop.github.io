Rebel Wilson has continued to flaunt her shrinking frame on social media after losing weight on a health kick.

This week, the Australian actress shared a series of flattering photos taken by her personal makeup artist Matthew VanLeeuwen.

In the images, the 40-year-old showed off her trim physique in a loose green dress.

She also showed off her natural makeup, which was flawlessly applied, and perfectly styled blonde locks.

The photos were met with an overwhelmingly positive response from Rebel's followers, with one writing: 'You are so gorgeous!'

Caroline Wozniacki commented: 'I wish I could look this good chilling at home.'

After months of rigorous exercise and dieting, Rebel finally revealed her magic weight loss number last week.

The Australian actress revealed she is currently 83kg (13 stone, or 183lbs).

The blonde uploaded photos of herself flaunting her slimmed-down figure in a blue wrap dress, explaining in the caption that she's not far off her goal weight of 75kg (11.8 stone, or 165lbs).

'Thanks for all the love so far on my "Year of Health" journey,' she wrote in the caption of her post. 

'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself "hmmmm...better not" and had a bottle of water instead. 

She added: '8kg to go until I hit my goal - hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'

Rebel has lost an estimated 18kg since the start of the year, after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.

'So for me 2020 is going to be called "The Year of Health",' she wrote on Instagram at the time.

'So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she declared.

'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'
