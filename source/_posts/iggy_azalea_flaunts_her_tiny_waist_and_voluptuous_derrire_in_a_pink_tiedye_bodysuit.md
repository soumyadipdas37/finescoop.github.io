She's known for her incredible curves and voluptuous derriere. 

And on Tuesday, Australian rapper Iggy Azalea flaunted her finest assets when she shared a sultry shot with her 14 million followers on Instagram.

The 30-year-old showed off her flat stomach and curvaceous derriere in a pink tie-dye bodysuit.

She had her long blonde tresses plaited behind her hair, while she accessorised her look with oversized designer sunglasses. 

It certainly didn't take the Australian singer long to bounce back to her pre-baby body, after welcoming her first child earlier this year.

Earlier this month, Iggy didn't have an inch to pinch as she danced and gyrated around in the skimpy swimwear in one social media video.

Iggy recently denied that her incredible post-baby body was the result of plastic surgery. 

She told a fan on Twitter that her toned physique was down to a healthy diet and the fact that she was already in great shape before falling pregnant.  

And while that may well be true, it doesn't mean that Iggy has never gone under the knife before.

Body: The blonde bombshell has denied having butt implants, but there has been speculation that she may have undergone a Brazilian butt lift 

She has openly admitted to undergoing some procedures, including rhinoplasty and a breast augmentation.

The blonde bombshell has denied having butt implants, but there has been speculation that she may have undergone a Brazilian butt lift.

Plastic surgeon to the stars, Michael Salzhauer (aka Dr. Miami), who has not operated on the rapper, told Daily Mail Australia last year that Iggy's 'shape' is a dead giveaway.  

'Her shape and personal history makes me think she has,' he said, adding that telltale signs of a Brazilian butt lift include: 'A very small waist and big buttocks.' 

A Brazilian butt lift is a form of buttock augmentation, which enhances the size and shape of a patient's bottom using a fat transfer from other areas of the body.
