Nadia Bartel is spending some quality time with her sons ahead of Father's Day. 

On Saturday, the 35-year-old shared a number of photos of Aston, four, and Henley, one, in an Instagram post. 

The images showed the boys playing outside their home, smiling and cuddling as they did.

The photos come after Lauren Mand, the girlfriend of her ex, Jimmy Bartel's girlfriend, revealed she's gearing up to celebrate Father's Day. 

She shared an Instagram Stories post on Friday that showed her wrapping gifts.

Lauren declared in June that she 'loved' Jimmy's sons, and after Jimmy posted a photo of his kids playing his backyard, Lauren commented: 'My besties! Love them'. 

Earlier this year, Lauren told her Instagram followers that coming home from work to the two young boys was the 'highlight' of her day.
