She was taken to Sydney Hand Hospital for treatment.  

Daily Mail Australia understands the woman was walking her dog in the mall when it set upon the American bulldog.

The two dogs began to fight and the woman tried to break them up before she was bitten on the hand 

Both dogs are believed to be on a leash at the time of the attack.

The two dogs are now in custody of the Sutherland Shire Council. 

Michael McCammon said he heard a lot of screaming after the woman was bitten.   

'One lady came in looking for ice and a plastic bag which made me think maybe she lost a finger or something, because there was a fair bit of blood,' he told Nine News.

'Another guy came in looking for ice, a [firefighter] came in looking for ice, and everything was going a bit wild.' 

A spokesman for Sutherland Shire Council told Daily Mail Australia the animal believed to be responsible has been seized.

'This incident is currently under investigation by NSW Police, and Council staff will continue to support this investigation as required,' the spokesman said.

'Sutherland Shire Council requires all dog owners to keep their pets on a leash at all times when in public areas, unless they are in one of Council’s designated off leash areas.

'Council has the power to take action against those who fail to fulfil their responsibilities as a pet owner, including imposing financial penalties, animal management orders or the seizure of any animals that have attacked a person or animals.'
