Musician Eddy Grant is suing the Trump campaign for copyright infringement over the use of his hit 1980s song 'Electric Avenue'.

Twitter on Tuesday removed a tweet by President Trump after it received a copyright complaint from musician Eddy Grant, whose song was featured in the clip.

The 55 second video showed a fast train representing the Trump/Pence campaign speeding down a track.

It was cut with a slower Joe Biden pumping a railroad handcar down the tracks with Grant's song playing throughout the duration of the video. 

Lawyers for Grant, who lives in Barbados, filed the lawsuit in the Southern District of New York, seeking unspecified damages. 

The complaint read: 'None of the Plaintiffs, nor any agent on their respective behalves, has licensed any rights in the Composition to either Mr. Trump or [the Trump campaign], or otherwise consented to Defendants' use of the Composition in connection with the Infringing Video.'

The campaign video was tweeted by Trump on August 12 and was removed 20 days later, on September 1

In the cease-and-desist letter included in the court filing, one of Grant's lawyers stated that the singer had sustained 'substantial damage and irreparable harm' after the song was used in a 'controversial political campaign.'

The campaign video was tweeted by Trump on August 12 and was removed 20 days later, on September 1. 

By that time, it had already accrued around 50,000 replies, 14,000 retweets and more than 350,000 likes.
