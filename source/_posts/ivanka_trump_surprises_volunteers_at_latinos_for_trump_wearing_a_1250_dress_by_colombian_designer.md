Ivanka Trump donned a $1,250 dress by Colombian fashion designer Johanna Ortiz to surprise volunteers at the Latinos for Trump headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday.

Ahead of her roundtable discussion with Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, which was scheduled for later in the day, the 38-year-old White House senior adviser met with her father's supporters who have been working to help get him reelected.  

Ivanka was strategic when picking her outfit, opting to support a Latina designer while visiting the campaign group's headquarters, where she was photographed wearing a mask while speaking with volunteers.

Outfit of the day: Ivanka cut a stylish figure in the white crepe frock, which featured voluminous sleeves, a squared neckline, and a peplum waist that highlighted her figure

She cut a stylish figure in the white crepe frock, which featured voluminous sleeves, a squared neckline, and a peplum waist that highlighted her figure. 

The first daughter paired the long-sleeve midi dress with gold stiletto sandals and a playful blue and white tie-dye mask. 

Ivanka has faithfully donned a protective face covering for the majority of her public outings, despite her father's wavering stance on masks. 

She has also taken great care to match them to her outfits, with Wednesday's look being no exception.  

Safety first: The first daughter wore a light blue and white tie-dye mask that matched her dress 

Greeting: Ivanka gave a volunteer a fist bump while visiting the headquarters 

Secretly smiling? While the lower half of Ivanka's face was hidden behind her mask, she had a twinkle in her eye as she walked around and spoke to her father's supporters Sa

Cheese! Ivanka took to Instagram to share photos from the event, including a picture of of herself flashing the peace sign while posing with a woman wearing a Latinas for Trump shirt 

Her long blonde hair was center-parted and styled in loose waves, a departure from her typically poker-straight locks. 

While the lower half of Ivanka's face was hidden behind her mask, she had a twinkle in her eye as she walked around the headquarters with Gov. Ducey.

She was photographed waving and speaking to volunteers, and at one point, she gave the woman she was talking to a fist bump.  

Ivanka also volunteered to work a phone bank at the headquarters and was seen using a cellphone to call someone.

After her visit, she sat down with Gov. Ducey and others to participate in a roundtable discussion about America's working families. 

The first daughter later shared photos from her trip on Instagram, writing: 'Joined Governor @dougducey and many new friends for phone banking and great discussions today in Phoenix. 

'Heard incredible success stories from hardworking Arizonans — they credit @realdonaldtrump pro-growth economic policies. Arizonans know that POTUS will continue to fight hard for them for the next four years!!'

Ivanka's trip to Arizona marks the first time the first daughter has visited the state since her father was elected.

Second Lady Karen Pence is slated to visit Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson on Thursday, where she will speak to military spouses. 

Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence is expected to be in Arizona on Friday to participate in a roundtable discussion for Hispanic Heritage Month.  

It's been a busy week for Ivanka, who was on hand to watch President Trump preside over the signing of historic diplomatic deals between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.

President Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, United Arab Emirates (UAE) Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed, and Bahrain's Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani each signed four copies of the Abraham Accords — one in English, one in Hebrew, and two in Arabic.

The leaders also signed a treaty of peace, diplomatic relations, and full normalization and a declaration of peace — three copies of each were signed, one in English, one in Arabic, and one in Hebrew.

Ivanka donned a mint green dress for the occasion, and she had a bright smile on her face as she walked with her husband Jared Kusher to the South Lawn of the White House, where the signing took place.
