Charity volunteer Aleksandra Timoshchenkova, who helped the family to collect money for Yegor's treatment said: 'The boy was found lying unconscious in a pool of blood.

'The dogs were still tearing him apart.'

According to reports, the dogs managed to break out of their enclosure because Yegor's father had failed to close its door properly.

During the attack, they ripped off the boy's genitals, anus and tore the femoral artery on his left leg, say local media. 

Considering the severity of his injuries, Yegor was transported by a military helicopter to the city of Dnipro to receive the medical care he needed.

The boy was admitted to Dnipro Regional Children's Hospital where four crews of surgeons started battling for his life.
