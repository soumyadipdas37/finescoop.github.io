An Australian live export ship has disappeared off the Japanese coast after being hit by a dangerous typhoon.

Two Australians, two New Zealanders along with 39 people from the Philippines are on board the vessel as well as 5,800 cattle. 

The Japanese coast guard are now searching for the Gulf Livestock 1 that sent a distress signal after being hit by the typhoon in the East China Sea on Wednesday.

A lifeboat and a Filipino crew member were found drifting in the water on Wednesday night, the ABC reported.

The crew member had not sustained any life-threatening injuries. 

The vessel had left New Zealand on August 14 and was due to arrive in China on Friday. 

Rescue teams are continuing their search for the ship but are struggling against strong winds and rain from Typhoon Maysak. 

More to come.
