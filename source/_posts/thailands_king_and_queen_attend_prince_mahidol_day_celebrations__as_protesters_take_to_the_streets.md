Thailand's king and queen have attended celebrations at a hospital as crop-top-wearing protesters mocked his clothing and called for his power to be reduced.

King Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida were at the Siriraj hospital in Bangkok for Prince Mahidol Day - to commemorate his contribution to medical education.

The monarch, who spends much of his time in Europe, laid a wreath at the foot of his grandfather's statue, local media said.

It is not clear if his mistress Sineenatra Wongvajirabhakdi, who was reinstated as his royal consort after being released from jail earlier this month, was at the event.

She has been given back her royal and military titles after she was previously accused of seeking to undermine the monarch's official wife, the queen.

It comes as a thousand demonstrators rallied at parliament as it debated amending the constitution, one of the demands behind nearly two months daily protests.

Protesters wore crop tops and sprayed a democracy plaque outside the building as they mocked the king for his clothing.

The two-day session of parliament was convened on Wednesday and was expected to vote late tonight on whether to accept a motion for constitutional changes.

But a lawmaker aligned with the government proposed the vote be postponed to November and a new committee be set up to study details around the process first.

The proposal was met with resistance from opposition parties and also angered the protesters.

Anon Nampa, one of the protest leaders, said: 'Do you hear the people? Or is the building so thick?'

The protesters want to change a constitution they say was engineered to ensure ex-junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha stayed on as prime minister after last year's election.

They want his departure and some protesters also say the constitution gives too much power to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.

The biggest demonstration so far drew tens of thousands of people over the weekend.

The 2017 constitution was written by a military-appointed committee and passed a nationwide referendum in 2016 at which opposition campaigning was banned.

Prayuth said the 2019 election was fair.

On Wednesday, hundreds of royalist from the Thai Pakdee group marched to the parliament to submit a petition opposing constitutional change.

The assembly combines an elected lower House of Representatives and a military-appointed Senate.
