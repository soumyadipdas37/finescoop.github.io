The Grammy winning singer and A Star Is Born actress, 34, told CBS' Lee Cowan in Sunday's sit down interview that the pressures of fame had caused her to contemplate suicide.

Gaga - born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta - said she channeled that pain and darkness into her latest studio album Chromatica.

Reflecting on her mental health struggles, she explained: 'I didn't really understand why I should live other than to be there for my family. That was an actual real thought and feeling: 'Why should I stick around?'' 

And depression is a lonely place, she said.

Lonely place: 'I totally gave up on myself, I hated being famous. I hated being a star. I felt exhausted and used up,' Gaga said in the TV sit down

 It's not always easy, if you have mental issues, to let other people see. I used to show. I used to self-harm,' Gaga shared. 'I used to say, 'Look. I cut myself. See, I'm hurt.' Cause I didn't think anyone could see. Cause mental health, it's invisible.' 

She added: 'I totally gave up on myself, I hated being famous. I hated being a star. I felt exhausted and used up.'

However, the recording artist says she has moved through her feelings of despair and come to embrace her life again. 

 'I don't hate Lady Gaga anymore,' she said in her CBS interview. 'I found a way to love myself again, even when I thought that was never gonna happen.'

Moved forward from pain: 'I don't hate Lady Gaga anymore,' she said in her CBS interview. 'I found a way to love myself again, even when I thought that was never gonna happen'
