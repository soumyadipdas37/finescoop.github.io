Yves Bissouma was dismissed for a reckless challenge on Jamal Lewis during Brighton's Premier League win at Newcastle after referee Kevin Friend consulted a pitchside monitor following a check by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR).

Technology intervened with a minute of normal time remaining after Albion midfielder Bissouma caught opponent Lewis in the face with his studs as he moved his leg up and backwards behind him while the pair competed for the ball.

The video replay looked horrifying as unfortunate defender Lewis looked to have been caught full in the face at force by the underside of Bissouma's boot.

Experienced official Friend was told to take another look at the clash on a monitor by the sidelines, reviewing the ugly incident several times in slow motion before changing Bissouma's punishment from a yellow card to a straight red.

The Malian playmaker looked concerned for Lewis even after he received his marching orders.

Both players had slumped to the turf in obvious pain as a result of the challenge, although Lewis eventually rose to his feet and was able to continue after having a black bandage wrapped around his head to ensure the bleeding was stemmed.

Fans on social media likened the challenge by Bissouma, who had played an important part in his side's comfortable victory, to an acrobatic wrestling move.

Many viewers were reminded of legendary American wrestler Shawn Michaels, who was known for his wild finishes for the entertainment of television audiences.

One called the move a 'beautiful tribute' to the revered wrestler, while others debated whether Bissouma deserved his punishment.

Former Premier League winner Chris Sutton called the red card a 'joke', while critics described the high foot as 'cynical'.

Brighton coach Graham Potter said: 'I couldn't see the challenge from where I was and I haven't seen it back.

'I don't think there will be any intent from Yves so if it's violent, it's violent. But I don't think he was looking to hurt anybody – he's not that type of player.'
