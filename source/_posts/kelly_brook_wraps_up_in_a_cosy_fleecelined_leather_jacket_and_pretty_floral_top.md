Kelly, who was spotted with her long-term beau Jeremy Parisi on Monday, previously opened up about intimacy in their relationship. 

In July, Kelly claimed that sex gets better with age and said her longterm love is a big fan of her curves.

Speaking on Vicky Pattison's The Secret To... podcast, she said: 'My boyfriend is 35 and he is Italian, so, you know, he likes a nice large curvy woman so that's always a good thing! I think your sex life gets better as you get older!

'You get confident! You are not so hung up on stuff. You know what you enjoy. You know what you like, so you are not as scared to tell them.

'When you're young you don't tell them. They are like 'is that nice?' or whatever and you're like 'yeah!' When you're older you are gonna make sure you get what you want!'  

The pair have been dating for nearly five years, having started dating in 2015.
