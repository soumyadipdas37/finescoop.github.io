It's hot or Not time again as Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai reveals what's been making him feel warm and what's been leaving him cold this week.   

Pierre Gasly 

With all respect due to the immense brilliance of Lewis Hamilton, his sheer dominance has strangled the life out of those who prefer a bit more unpredictability with their sport. For that reason, Pierre Gasly winning in Italy came at just the right time.

Jake Wightman

He ran the fastest 800m by a British man since 2012 earlier this week and last month he became the second quickest ever over 1500m, passing Seb Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram in the historic timings. Athletics could be about to disappear from terrestrial TV just when it’s getting interesting again.

Alfie Barbeary

On his first Premiership start, the 19-year-old was repurposed from hooker to flanker and responded by scoring a hat-trick against Leicester. On the strength of his introduction for Wasps, it seems fairly bankable that we’ll be hearing an awful lot more about him.

Novak Djokovic

In this period of reflection, when he looks within and turns this into ‘a lesson for growth as a human being’, perhaps we should all be a little thankful for Super Novak. For how many other sportsmen have offered such a rich variety of distractions and giggles during this wretched year?

Owen Farrell

Or more appropriately the disciplinary framework that gave the Saracens fly-half a five-game ban instead of 10 for the horrible challenge that concussed Charlie Atkinson. Their methodology, including character references and past behaviour, is based on the British judicial system, which makes it quite hard to knock. Except this was one of those cases that really could have been decided in silence – watch the tape, see the obvious, early dinner.

Martin Kaymer

It’s wonderful to see such a nice guy playing well again. But how galling to get within five holes of a win in each of the past two European Tour events, only to lose both. He hasn’t won since 2014 and you sense that may just have influenced a few of the closing putts that stayed up.
