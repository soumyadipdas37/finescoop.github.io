She's been blissfully dating her handsome boyfriend Joshua Gross for just over two years.

And on Saturday, Sophie Monk enjoyed a romantic date night at home with her beau. 

Posting to Instagram, Joshua shared a snap of the 40-year-old star sitting by the pool enjoying dinner in her 'trackies'.

'Date night and trackies...' he captioned the photo. 

Sophie looked casual chic in a tan jumper and grey track pants. She wore her blonde locks up in a bun and went makeup free for the date. 

The couple were enjoying a glass of white wine each along with oysters and what appeared to be a pear salad.

Last month Sophie admitted that much to her irritation, the medical supplies executive hasn't popped the question yet. 

The blonde beauty revealed to Studio 10  that she's so desperate to tie the knot, she'd happily accept an onion ring instead of a diamond at this point. 

'I'm dead set in love. I think I've been shouting it everywhere,' she told the panel of hosts.

However, it was after host Sarah Harris asked if there would be wedding bells soon that Sophie's true desperation was revealed.

'No he hasn't asked me to marry him yet...' she exclaimed.

'I'd take an onion ring at this point,' she added.
