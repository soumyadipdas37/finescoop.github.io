Malin Akerman was snapped looking casual while running errands Wednesday in Los Angeles.

The Stockholm, Sweden-born beauty, 42, wore a black top that read, 'Year of the Woman,' with dark blue jeans with white sneakers.

The actress, who plays Lara Axelrod on the TV series Billions, wore a patterned face mask and listened to music on headphones on the weekday outing.

Malin, who was raised in Canada, has been married to British actor Jack Donnelly, 34, for more than two years, and she has a seven-year-old son named Sebastian from her marriage to Italian musician Roberto Zincone.

She chat last month with Entertainment Tonight about she can get uncomfortable watching her own films.

'I always love to watch the movie once, just to see how it all comes together. But it is a little bit of that kind of cringey feeling,' she said. 'Maybe I’ll sit for a few minutes ... but a lot of my films I can’t sit with my whole family and watch, especially not with my son yet.'

She said that an exception to that rule is her film The Sleepover, co-starring Ken Marino and Joe Manganiello: 'I am looking forward to this one, because we will be able to view it as a family.'

Busy: Malin appeared in the Netflix film The Sleepover with Joe Manganiello 

In the Netflix film, she plays Margot, a former master thief living as a suburban mom.

She said her son would enjoy the scene when 'the kids [discover her] secret lair with all of the gadgets.

'My son, his brain is going to explode because he is all about that stuff,' Akerman added. 'He’s very into Spy Kids and all the gadgets that they have. And then the other scene that I’m really excited for him to see is the fight scene.

'To see his mom kick a**, I think it will be interesting to see how he reacts to that. He’ll either like it, or be weirded out by it.'

The actress, who's also been seen in Watchmen and A Piece of My Heart, said she loved 'doing stunts' for the film.

'Stunts, especially, is such a fun day of feeling cool,' she said. 'And then you see the replay of it, because you see the stunt people around you going, "Wow!" You’re in it and you’re doing it and you watch the replay and you go, "Wow! I felt so much cooler while I was doing it."

'It really is so much fun to get to do that and you really don’t get to do it very often.'

Next up for Akerman is the holiday comedy Friendsgiving, which also features Donnelly. The film comes out in theaters and via streaming platforms October 23.
