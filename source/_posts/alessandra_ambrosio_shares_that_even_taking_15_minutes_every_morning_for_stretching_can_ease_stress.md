Alessandra Ambrosio has the key to dealing with stress amid COVID-19.  

The 39-year-old model - who has Anja, 12, and Noah, eight, with Jamie Mazur - has revealed that in spite of her hectic schedule, she always makes time each day to 'take care of [herself]'.

 'I've always tried to keep my beauty routine as simple as possible and that didn't change when I had my kids. What I've focused on since having kids is creating time to take care of myself,' said the workout queen. 'Even if it's just 15 minutes in the morning for meditation, stretching or yoga - it helps me get centered and ready to conquer whatever the day is bringing my way.'
