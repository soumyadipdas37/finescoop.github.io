She's been keeping her 8.3million Instagram followers entertained with glam social media shoots this year.

And Winnie Harlow shared another sizzling set of snaps on Monday, wowing in a racy look for photographer Walter W. Brady.

The catwalk star emulated Olivia Newton John's character Sandy in Grease, with her all-black look, captioning the shoot 'Greased Lightening'.

The Canadian beauty wowed in a tiny buttoned bandeau top, highlighting her toned waist.

She added a pair of black tights layered over hot pants and teamed with racy lace-up boots.

To complete the retro look, her hair was styled into volumnious curls, while dramatic eye makeup was the finishing touch.

Winnie posed next to her car while also showing off her incredible look inside her plush pad.

The model has been enjoying some time with her Los Angeles Lakers beau Kyle Kuzma over the past few weeks.  

The couple, who have been dating since May, had been separated since the NBA restarted its 2020 season in Disney World. 

The NBA only recently started to allow family and close friends into its Florida-based bubble as long as they adhere to daily coronavirus testing.

Winnie, who shot to fame on America's Next Top Model, and Kuzma appear to have fallen hard for each other in the short time they've been together.

Connecting romantically in May, the pair had been spotted out together during quarantine and Harlow shared a gushing, PDA filled post for Kuzman's 25th birthday this summer.

While apart, the pair had been keeping up with one another via FaceTime.
