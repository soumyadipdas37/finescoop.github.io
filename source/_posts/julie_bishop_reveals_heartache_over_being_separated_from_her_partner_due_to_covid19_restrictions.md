Julie Bishop has opened up on the heartache of being separated from her partner due to coronavirus border closures.

The former Foreign Minister, 64, was no stranger to jetting to different states around Australia or countries as part of her job.

But Ms Bishop has been stuck in Perth for the past six months and has not seen her partner David Panton, who is in Sydney.

'The first place I will go is to Sydney to see David,' Ms Bishop told The Daily Telegraph about borders reopening. 

'We FaceTime. It isn't great but it is all you can do because he can't get in here (WA) and I can't go there without having to get an exemption. It is very difficult but I know a lot of families have been separated in this way, it is challenging.' 

Ms Bishop also revealed said she does not miss politics after 20 years in parliament. 

The private life that comes with being Chancellor of the Australian National University is something that was a long time coming, she said.

Ms Bishop is also working with Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation to help raise awareness and funds.

The foundation is close to her heart after two of her sisters were treated with ovarian cysts when they were younger.

With almost 14,000 women dying from ovarian cancer each year, Ms Bishop is pushing for early detection tests. 

'I think there needs to be a greater effort to find better treatments along the road to a cure and that is most certainly why I think we need an early detection test,' she said.
