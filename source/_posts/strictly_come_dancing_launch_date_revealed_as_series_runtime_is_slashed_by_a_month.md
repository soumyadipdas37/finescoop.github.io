Strictly Come Dancing's run time has been slashed by a month as less contestants have been signed up and more precautions are being taken amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

According to The Mirror, the dancing show will premiere on Saturday 24th October, far later than the typical September launch. 

The series will then conclude on 19 December, meaning it will only have a nine week run instead of the typical 13.

However, the series is still set to allow the contestants equal time to shine, as the shorter run time coincides with the fact that only 12 celebrities have signed up for the series this year, instead of the typical 15.  

A Strictly spokesperson declined to comment when approached by MailOnline. 

Just last week, the final line-up of celebrities taking part in the upcoming series were revealed. 

Hold off: According to The Mirror , the dancing show will premiere on Saturday 24th October, far later than the typical September launch (pictured: contestant Jamie Laing) 

Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, 57, and YouTube star HRVY were confirmed as the final contestants this year's Strictly Come Dancing.  

They joined Jason Bell, Ranvir Singh, Clara Amfo, Caroline Quentin, Jamie Laing, Bill Bailey, JJ Chalmers, Max George, Maisie Smith and Nicola Adams on the line-up. 

The reports come after it was claimed the show has been left in crisis as a crew member tested positive for coronavirus.

As a result 'everyone was told to leave,' according to a source, who also claimed that the set was given a powerful deep clean as show bosses await the results of a third medical test on the lighting expert. 

According to The Sun, the lighting expert spent a week working on the dance contest's set.

Following his positive test result, at least five staff who were in close contact with him were sent home and told to self-isolate and await tests of their own, according to the report.

Additionally, a deep clean of the set using powerful electrostatic sprayers, was apparently ordered. 

The report also claims that a third test on the worker is anxiously being waited for, after a second medical check on his Covid-19 status came back as 'inconclusive.'  

The publication's source also claimed that panic spread quickly among the professional dancers who were due to start filming in the studios tomorrow. 

Precautions! 'Everyone was told to leave,' according to a source, who also claimed that the set was given a powerful deep clean as show bosses await a third test result

A source told The Sun that the crew member would have been in close contact with 'dozens of others' on the set of Strictly.

The insider said: 'They were hours away from starting filming for the pre-­recorded professional group dances when they got a call to say that one of the crew members had tested positive when turning up for another job.

'Everything juddered to a halt while worried bosses worked out what to do. This is the worst-case scenario for Strictly, as they've gone to extreme lengths to make the show safe up to this point.

'Starting a show then stopping mid-production is the most expensive thing that could happen, so they're praying it's not more serious than just one person potentially having it.' 

The source also insisted that filming in the studio needs to begin this week if the show is going to be able to film the group dances ahead of the series' scheduled start date, admitting that it's already 'a race against time.'.  

A source told MailOnline: 'the crew member is no longer on the production and has had a negative NHS test result.

'Procedures were followed and stringent protocols have been put in place just in case, but recording isn't due to happen until later this week so there is minimal impact.'
