A $30 matte lipstick loved by Kylie Jenner has been crowned the best shade in Australia after thousands of beauty fans voted for their favourite formula.

MAC's best-selling 'Velvet Teddy' has earned a cult status with its universally flattering nude shade that suits many skin tones all over the world.

And it's no surprise the iconic product has been voted the winner after taking out the 'best lipstick' category in the coveted Mecca Beauty Election 2020 awards.

The popular lipstick has earned a cult status with its universally flattering nude shade that suits many skin tones all over the world

With a deep 'beige-meets-rosy' undertone, the fan-favourite shade offers long lasting colour with 'comfortable all-day wear'.

The lipstick contains vitamin E to ensure the colour 'glides onto lips smoothly without causing skin dehydration'. 

More than 600 fans have left glowing 4.7 star ratings on the Mecca website, with many describing it as the 'perfect nude shade'.

'Hands down the best lipstick. It's beautiful - nice scent and a gorgeous velvety texture with a stunning matte finish,' one fan said.

Another woman said: 'There is a reason the Velvet Teddy is time and time again the most popular colour in the Mac range. It is the perfect well defined nude needed in every girls kit. Just buy it - you will not be disappointed.'  

One single woman described the shade as the 'best lipstick wingman ever'.

'I recently bought this amazing shade to celebrate heading back in to the dating world. It has survived two out of two dates without the amazingly rich pigment fading let alone slipping, bleeding, sliding or gravitating to my teeth,' she said. 

'Even when making out (both dates were great kissers, thanks for asking), this incredible lipstick was reliable. Best lipstick wingman EVER.'

One fan said the lipstick lived up to its expectations, saying 'The reviews were right, Velvet Teddy is a great product! The colour is a totally appealing, in-between kind of shade that just works. No strong taste or smell. A winner.' 

Another woman agreed, saying: 'I wanted to see what the hype was about with Velvet Teddy and happy to say it lived up to the hype completely. 

'I have medium olive skin and Velvet Teddy works really well for a deep-tone nude on my lips. It is really sophisticated and I adore how it wears as well.'

Others revealed they have been buying the same shade for years, with one woman saying: 'I have used this as my go-to for years - by far my personal favourite and lasts all day.'

The runners-up in the lipstick category includes $30 Mecca Cosmetica tinted lip de-luscious with SPF 25, $46 Too Faced lip injection extreme, $42 Nars lipstick and $18 Mecca Max gloss boss lip gloss.
