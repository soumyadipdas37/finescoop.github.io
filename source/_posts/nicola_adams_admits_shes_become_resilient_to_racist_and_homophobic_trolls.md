Nicola Adams claimed she's become 'resilient' in the face of homophobic and racist online trolls against her and girlfriend Ella Baig, 22.

The Olympic gold medallist, 37, spoke candidly to Women's Health Magazine on Tuesday, and admitted she used to ignore hateful comments before but now speaks out against them publicly to help others.

Explaining her reasoning, she said: 'I've become resilient to the comments I get online – I'll block people rather than reply.

'But recently, Ella and I decided to fight back, because maybe there are people out there who aren't able to cope with these sorts of messages; people who might find it comforting to know that even though I'm an Olympic champion, people still say horrible things to me.'

Nicola went on to detail the microaggressions she's experienced over the years, saying she's aware she's been 'treated differently' because she is a black woman.

The professional boxer explained that she knew she was being discriminated against because of 'subtle things, like people moving their handbags away from me or security guards following me around shops.'

Nicola and Ella have been in a relationship with each other since 2018, and the blogger lives with the athlete in Leeds. 

Of how she feels being part of an interracial couple, she went on: 'The first time my partner Ella and I really considered that we were an "interracial" couple was when a woman commented on a picture of us on social media saying she was proud of us for being one. We just feel like two ordinary people.' 

Her candid chat comes amid reports that Karen Hauer could be paired up with her in Strictly Come Dancing's first same-sex pairing. 

According to bookmakers Ladbrokes, Karen is firm favourite to team up with Nicola, with her odds coming in at 5/4.

She's battling it out with Katya Jones who is at 2/1, while Oti Mabuse comes in at 3/1.

A source told Express.co.uk: 'The fingers are pointing towards fan favourite Karen and Nicola being paired together to make Strictly history.'

They continued: 'It goes without saying all of the female professionals would love to partner with Nicola this year.

'It’s the most sought after position in showbiz right now and it looks like Strictly stalwarts Karen, Katya and Oti are the front runners.'

A Strictly representative declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.  

Karen meanwhile has previously expressed her desire to be partnered with a female contestant.

She said to The Sun on Sunday: 'It’s a beautiful way to showcase emotion on stage and I’d definitely like to do it.

'I’ve danced with women a lot over the years, so I feel very comfortable about it. All the dancers would love to see it on the show.' 

Nicola has also shared her excitement with dancing with another woman as she explained: 'It's amazing to be a part of the movement for change, diversity and breaking boundaries in the entertainment industry.'  

Speaking live from her home on BBC Breakfast, Nicola said of her groundbreaking all-female pairing: 'It's really important, it's a big step for the show as well. It's nice to see we've been able to move on and I just can't wait to get some dancing done really.'
