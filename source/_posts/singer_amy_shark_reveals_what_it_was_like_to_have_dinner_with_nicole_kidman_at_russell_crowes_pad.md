'I just happened to be in New York working and he was like, 'Hey, before you go home, there's someone in town that wants to meet you,'' she said. 

The  Gold-Coast born musician went on to reveal that Russell was having a 'dinner party' at his 'New York penthouse' and fellow Aussie, Deborra-Lee Furness was there. 

'[Russell] knows I love theatre, so I thought she was my guest,' Amy adds.
