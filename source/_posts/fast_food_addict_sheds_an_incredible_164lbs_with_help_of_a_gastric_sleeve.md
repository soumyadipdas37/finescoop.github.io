A fast food addict who used to consume up to 2,000 calories in one sitting and was labelled a 'whale' by strangers has shed an incredible 164lbs with the help of a gastric sleeve.

Julie Garte, 35, from Miami, weighed a colossal 342lbs at her heaviest - but now, five years later, she flaunts her size six physique with pride after spending $17,500 on the weight loss surgery, as well as a tummy tuck and breast lift and enlargement.

Training to be a personal trainer, Julie revealed that her weight first started creeping up as a side effect of the medication she was taking to treat her bipolar disorder.

But by the time her tablets were changed, it was 'too late' because Julie's binge eating had already spiralled out of control - with the 'emotional eater' devouring McDonald's near-daily.

After deciding 'enough is enough', Julie overhauled her diet - sticking to mainly vegetables and chicken instead - and said she's 'finally living after years of hiding away'.

Julie (pictured recently) weighed a colossal 342lbs at her heaviest - but now, five years later, she flaunts her size six physique with pride after spending $17,500 on the weight loss surgery, as well as a tummy tuck and breast lift and enlargement

Julie's bad eating habits spiralled out of control because she used food as a coping mechanism to deal with depression. 

Julie said: 'One day, I looked in the mirror and my reflection blew my mind. It was a real wake up call and I decided enough was enough.

'I didn't want to spend another decade sleeping and eating. I knew I needed surgery to keep the weight off after years of yo-yo dieting.

'It was always easier to eat fast food washed down with two litres of cola followed by anything sweet. I was an emotional eater and used food to cheer myself up but would instantly feel sad again after consuming up to 2,000 calories in one sitting.'

Breakfast - Usually skipped.

Lunch - McDonald's Big Mac, french fries and six chicken nuggets (all large)

Dinner - Pizza or spaghetti bolognese 

Snacks - Ice cream, cookies and crisps

Breakfast - Half a bagel with cream cheese and hard boiled egg

Snack - Piece of fruit

Lunch - Roast vegetables and chicken

Dinner - Fish and vegetables

Julie was pre-diabetic and required physiotherapy three times per week. She started her journey by working out with the help of a personal trainer before having a large part of her stomach removed in 2015.

She then had a tummy tuck and breast lift and enlargement in 2017 which cost $12,000 and a revision in 2018 priced at $5,500.

Julie said: 'I made small changes to my diet such as replacing cola for water and cooking rather than going to a drive through. Now, I love to cook home-made dishes and eat sweets in moderation!

'I am so confident now - I smile at strangers and go out of a weekend! I spent years being taunted because of my weight - strangers would shout "whale" and "fatty" as I passed. 

'It is so hurtful that people can be so cruel - they judged me without even knowing my story.'

Julie initially piled on the pounds as it was a side effect of the medication she was taking to treat bipolar disorder.

She said: 'I have never felt so happy and motivated in my entire life. I want to help overweight people experience these feelings too which is why I am training to be a personal trainer.

'I am finally living after years of hiding away. I've been told I am an inspiration which definitely spurs me on to keep on going.'

A gastric sleeve is where a large part of the stomach is removed during surgery so it's much smaller than it was before. 

This means the patient cannot eat as much as they could before the operation and they'll feel full sooner.
