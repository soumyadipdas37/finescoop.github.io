Tottenham had a request to host 8,000 fans in their Premier League opener against Everton this weekend rejected by the Government. 

Clubs in England have been hopeful of gradually introducing spectators by taking part in pilot events, with aims of bigger attendances in October. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a 'review' into plans to re-open stadiums on Wednesday after a rise in coronavirus cases.

And Spurs were among the clubs who were duly turned down by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in their bid to welcome more fans for their game against the Toffees at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday.

Boris Johnson has announced a 'review' of plans to reopen stadiums for sport fans in October

They had proposed allowing 8,000 spectators inside their new £1billion ground, with 4,000 sitting in premium seats and the other 4,000 through general admission. 

The Premier League is desperate to secure the return of supporters in the coming months amid fears a lack of revenue from ticket sales is costing clubs dearly.

Chief executive Richard Masters said it was 'absolutely critical' fans were allowed back into grounds as soon as possible, disclosing that the absence of supporters could cost top-flight clubs around £700million over the season.

Brighton welcomed 2,500 fans for their friendly against Chelsea at the Amex last month 

A number of test events in sport have already been held successfully this summer, with Brighton allowing 2,500 supporters for their friendly against Chelsea at the Amex last month.

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport confirmed that test events for the rest of this month would be capped at 1,000 spectators, and that the Government would review plans for an October 1 permanent return of spectators nearer the time.   

Premier League clubs including Manchester United had joined Spurs in planning proposals to host test events at their first home matches of the season. United were hoping to allow 12,000 fans into Old Trafford for their fixture against Crystal Palace a week on Saturday.
