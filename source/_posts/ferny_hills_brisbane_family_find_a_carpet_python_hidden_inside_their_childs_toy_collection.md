A family were horrified when they discovered a huge carpet python curled up inside their child's playroom.

Snake catcher Bryan Robinson travelled to Ferny Hills, 18km north-west of Brisbane, on Tuesday to remove a carpet python from the home.

The snake was hidden on a shelf behind a box filled with dolls.

If the snake is a python, it is not venomous. 

Don't ever try to pick up a snake. 

Don't ever kill one.

If you have one in your house, call a snake catcher.

A social media post by Snake Catchers Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan and Gold Coast, compared it to a scene from E.T. where the alien hid inside of the cupboard.

'They noticed the animal there in the corner. It didn't come at them or surprise them or anything like that,' Mr Robinson told 7news.com.au.

'It was simply a carpet snake curled up in a corner.'

He believed the snake came through one of the doors in the house.   

Carpet pythons are a snake that does tend to stray towards taking refuge in homes.

They are also not an unusual type of snake to find around Brisbane. 

'As a general rule, snakes will occupy pretty much any niche within the suburban environment,' Mr Robinson said.
