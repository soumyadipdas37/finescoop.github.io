She is known for her acting and presenting talents. 

But Amanda Holden looked like she should pursue a career on the catwalk as she left the Global Radio studios after her Heart FM show on Wednesday.

The broadcaster, 49, looked chic in a green leopard print Topshop dress with a plunging neckline and skater hem as she strutted through Leicester Square.

The Britain's Got Talent judge added height to her frame with a pair of black towering strappy sandals and accessorised with a matching Gucci bag.   

Amanda sheltered her eyes with a pair of stylish tortoiseshell shades and wore gold hoop earrings with a dangling pendant.  

The blonde beauty kept her tresses swept back in a ponytail and opted for a natural makeup look that highlighted her radiant glow. 

The mother-of-two seemed in a playful mood as she showed off her bronzed legs from inside the studio, as she unfolded them and swivelled around on a chair in a fun Instagram video.

The Britain's Got Talent judge recently spoke on the show's controversy regarding Diversity's dance performance about Black Lives Matter and police brutality.

Ofcom complaints have soared to 23,308 over the performance which featured a portrayal of a policeman kneeling on Ashley Banjo's neck. 

On Good Morning Britain this week, Amanda said: 'It is extraordinary. I think the number of negative complaints means this conversation is right and fundamental and should continue to happen.

'What hasn't really been highlighted is the fact that we were inundated with overwhelming positive response, hundreds of thousands of them.

'As BGT family, and Diversity is very much part of that family, and Ashley is doing a phenomenal job on BGT, we stand by him and stand by that performance 100 per cent.'

The star added of Ashley Banjo: 'He sends out positive vibes to both the haters and the lovers of the piece that they did. He is saddened by negativity.' 

Presenter Piers Morgan, 55, reiterated his support for the routine saying: 'If you can't handle that without feeling the need to never watch BGT again or to complain to Ofcom, there's something wrong with you. 

'You, you're the problem! You're part of the problem.

'By the way, if you don't like me saying this, then don't watch us either. Don't watch Good Morning Britain. Because I agree with Ashley Banjo and Diversity. And if you can't handle it Britain, wake up.'
