Emily Ratajkowski kept things comfortable as she stepped out in New York on Tuesday morning.

The 29-year-old model hid her famous figure underneath an over-sized sweatsuit while grabbing breakfast with her husband Sebastian Bear-McClard.

Out and about: Emily Ratajkowski kept things comfortable as she stepped out in New York on Tuesday morning

Peeks of Emily's long, chocolate brown colored hair peered out from underneath the hood of her sweatshirt.

She stepped out wearing white Nike tennis shoes and carried a reusable water flask into a restaurant. 

Ratajkowski hid her eyes underneath a pair of dark sunglasses and wore a black face mask to match her husband's covering.

Sebastian was equally casually clad in a dark red sweater paired with grey running pants and matching trainers.

Emily recently released a bombshell essay through New York Magazine where she detailed being sexually assaulted by photographer Jonathan Leder in 2012.

In Buying Myself Back, Ratajkowski discussed a particular incident during a photoshoot in the Catskillls where Leder plied her with alcohol to the point of her passing out, only for Emily to wake up and find 'his fingers suddenly inside of [her]'. 

Years after the assault, Leder chose to publish her Polaroids in an $80 book, some of which were 'the most revealing and vulgar' photos from their 2012 shoot.

After publication, Emily embarked on a legal battle claiming she never consented to publishing the images.

Leder vehemently denied the claims of sexual assault.

Heather Tynan, the editorial director of his company, Imperial Publishing, released a statement attacking the model and accusing her of trying to drum up press for herself with the story.

'We are all deeply disturbed to read Ms. Ratajkowski’s latest (false) statements to NY mag in her never-ending search for press and publicity,' she said in the statement released on Imperial Publishing's website.

'Of course Mr. Leder totally denies her outrageous allegations of being "assaulted." It is grotesque and sad that she is so vindictive to lie in such a way to the press routinely.'
