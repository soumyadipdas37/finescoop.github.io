Burnley are making an £8million move for Mainz attacking midfielder Robin Quaison.

The 26-year-old Sweden international can also play as a second striker or on the wing and scored an impressive 13 goals in the Bundesliga this season.

Stocky and quick, Quaison's goalscoring threat and dribbling ability has drawn attention from top clubs in Europe including Tottenham.

He has a buy out clause understood to be around £14m but Burnley will test the water to see if Mainz are willing to take a lower offer.

Meanwhile, Burnley are braced for another bid from West Ham for James Tarkowski. West Ham have had two offers rejected so far, the last at £24m rising to just under £30m. 

They have received enough encouragement to believe a deal could be reached but Burnley have to pay a sell-on to Brentford and find a suitable replacement.

They have considered Nottingham Forest's Joe Worrall but he is valued at £12m and they did not wish to pay more than £6m.

It's also understood that any potential sale will include a 27.5 per cent sell-on fee to Brentford of any profit on the £3.5m Burnley paid for the 27-year-old Tarkowski in 2016.
