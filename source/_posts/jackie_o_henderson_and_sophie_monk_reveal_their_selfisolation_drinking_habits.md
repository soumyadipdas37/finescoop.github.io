Jackie 'O' Henderson and Sophie Monk have revealed their surprising drinking habits while in hotel quarantine.

Speaking on the The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday, the two friends admitted they were actually quite restrained compared to other middle-aged women.

'How many wines are you guys having a night?' Jackie's co-host Kyle Sandilands bluntly asked the pair, who are both in self-isolation at the moment.

'They monitor you here. You're only allowed a bottle a night,' Sophie, 40, said. 

The admission prompted Jackie, 45, to laugh out loud, seemingly confirming that she is facing a similar restriction. 

'That's it!' Sophie added, leaving Kyle in shock. 

Kyle then joked that the two women would be 'fermenting fruit' in the bathroom in order to make alcohol.

The radio host previously admitted that she was going to have to isolate for a full month, in Melbourne and when she gets home to Sydney.

'My life is f**ked... I can't get out of Melbourne. I am going to be stuck here for the rest of my life,' she said on her KIIS FM show last week.

'I have to do 14 days quarantine in my room here and then another 14 days when I get to Sydney.'

Jackie explained that she understood why she had to quarantine in Melbourne, after there was a COVID-19 outbreak on set of The Masked Singer.

But she slammed the need to quarantine again in Sydney, described it as 'odd'.

'I don't mind doing the quarantine, but it seems odd to do the double quarantine,' she said.

'Because at the end of this quarantine I will be tested and if I'm negative then I definitely won't have it.'

The NSW government requires the majority of people entering the state from Victoria to isolate for 14 days or comply with their permit conditions.
