She expecting her first child with boyfriend Neil Goldsmith in December.

The expectant mother was simply glowing as she posed in her kitchen wearing a fitted black dress that clung to her pregnancy curves.

'I love to cook, and I reeally love to eat! (Even more so, now that I’m pregnant!)' She captioned the post. 

'And since I’m cooking from home all the time these days, @everyplate.au has been a godsend!'

The reality star wore her long blonde locks loose and was sporting natural-looking makeup, including mascara and pale pink lip gloss. 

Last month, Carly told 9Now that she already knew she was pregnant even before taking a test. 

'I knew that I was pregnant before I even missed my period and took a pregnancy test, it was really weird,' she said.

'She claimed she had noticed her body was subtly changing, and also had a hunch about the gender of her child.

However, she said her doctor accidentally revealed her child's gender during a routine scan, and it was the opposite of what she and Neil were expecting.

'I was just in pure shock. Not because of disappointment, but just because of surprise,' she said.
