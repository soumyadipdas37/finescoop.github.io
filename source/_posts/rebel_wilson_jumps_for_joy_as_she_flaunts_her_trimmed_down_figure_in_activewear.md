Rebel Wilson has been on a health and fitness journey this year, losing at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone).

And on Friday, the Australian actress was jumping for joy as she flaunted her shrinking frame in a photo shared to Instagram. 

The 40-year-old revealed her slimmed down pins in black exercise leggings as she posed in front of a fountain in New York. 

Thrilled: Rebel Wilson, 40, (pictured) was jumping for joy as she flaunted her shrinking frame in a photo shared to Instagram on Friday, following her astonishing 18kg weight loss 

Rebel added a black jumper and trendy Moschino bag to the look, while sweeping her blonde locks back under a cap. 

She wore minimal makeup, allowing her natural beauty to shine through. 

'Recreating ISN'T IT ROMANTIC in Central Park today and rocking a bum bag like a BOSS,' she captioned the picture.

The Pitch Perfect star also shared the photo to her Instagram Stories. 

Last month, Rebel highlighted her weight loss as she shared several photos to Instagram of her slimmer frame in a tight blue wrap dress.  

The Australian actress explained that she is inching closer and closer to her goal of 75kg.

'Thanks for all the love so far on my 'Year of Health' journey,' she captioned the post. 

'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself 'hmmmm...better not' and had a bottle of water instead.'  

She added: '8kg's to go until I hit my goal - hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.' 

Getting into shape: The post comes after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020

The post comes after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.

'So for me 2020 is going to be called 'The Year of Health'. So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she told her Instagram followers.

'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'

In May, Rebel revealed she was trying to get down to her goal weight of 75kg (165lbs or 11.8 stone).
