Megan Thee Stallion isn't mincing her words, and in this case individual letters, when she shared a direct message to her 'haters' that came in the form of eye-blasting bling.

On Friday, the Savage star took to Instagram on Friday to flaunt a set of seven diamond rings that spelled out 'F**K YOU', which Page Six Style confirmed to be worth $200,000.   

Keeping her message simple, but far from sweet, Megan captioned the short video and two photos with: 'dear haters,' along with two middle finger emojis and a third emoji of a sun face with its eyes closed.

Take that haters! Megan Thee Stallion took to Instagram on Friday to showcase a set of seven diamond rings that spelled out 'F**K YOU'

For the quick clip, Megan had a male friend do a close-up camera shot that panned her fingers to showcase her blinged-out message.

'She means what she say and she say what she means,' the man could be heard saying as he slightly moved the camera, which Megan then chimed in by adding: 'Or your b**ch a**'

The friend quickly followed that up by repeating, 'Or your b**ch a**' several more times.

Wanting to add an exclamation point to her post, the Hot Girl Summer rapper ended by flashing her two middle fingers, which also helped showcase her long, personalized finger nails.

The rings were reportedly designed by jeweler to the stars Elliot Eliantte. Each of them features about 18 carats of VS1 diamonds, that totals 126 carats in all, and are set in 14K white gold.

'Megan had a message she wanted to get out and this was the format she decided to go with,' a representative for the jeweler said.

It's believed Eliantte also designed Megan's massive 'Hot Girl' diamond necklace, worth about $425,000, that she showed off on Instagram in July.

Megan has had her share of critics, both professionally and personally, that she may be directing her message towards.

From her meteoric rise to the top of the music charts, trademark twerk and revealing ensembles, to her denial and then accusation that Tory Lanez accidentally shot her in the foot two times in July, the Texas native has been good fodder for both journalists and social media trolls.  

In August, Megan (born Megan Pete) accused Lanez of shooting her after they had attended a pool party at Kylie Jenner's mansion on July 12.

She had previously remained silent about identifying the alleged shooter, even after he was charged with carrying a concealed weapon at the time. Megan said she was prompted to come forward with her version because Lanez's publicist had been spreading false information about the incident.
