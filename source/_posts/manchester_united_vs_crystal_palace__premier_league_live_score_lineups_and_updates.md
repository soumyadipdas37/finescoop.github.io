Manchester United finally get their Premier League campaign underway as they welcome Crystal Palace to Old Trafford this evening.Â 

United go into this contest without the reinforcements Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would have been after in the close season, with the Jadon Sancho saga rumbling on while a left back has not yet been brought in.Â 

Meanwhile, Palace will be looking to pick up from where they left off in last week's season opener against Southampton, in which a Wilfried Zaha strike was the difference for the Eagles.Â 

Sportsmail's OLLIE LEWIS will provide live EPL coverage of Man United vs Crystal Palace including score, lineups and build-up.Â
