Tyson Fury has urged Anthony Joshua to 'grow a pair' and step in to fight him this December if his planned trilogy clash with Deontay Wilder doesn't go ahead.

The self-styled Gypsy King has been training throughout lockdown in preparation to face Wilder for a third time, but the fight has been repeatedly pushed back.

The December 19 Las Vegas showdown has been called off again with Bob Arum confirming they are searching for new dates, and Fury - who has already agreed the financial side on a two-fight deal with Joshua for next year - has ordered his British rival to meet him for the undisputed heavyweight crown. 

Tyson Fury want Anthony Joshua to step in if he can't fight Deontay Wilder in December

Speaking to talkSport, WBC champion Fury said: 'I will be fighting in December either against Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas or Joe Bloggs.

'I have made it very clear that if we cannot fight in America then I want a homecoming in the UK and I don't care about a crowd.

'I am about one-hour from going AWOL unless I get some good news.

'Tell AJ to grow a pair and step up to fight in December. If Wilder doesn't happen then let's get the AJ fight in December.

Joshua has a defence of his unified world titles against Kubrat Pulev pencilled in for this year

'If Wilder doesn't happen in December then I will step in and smash Anthony Joshua into next week.'

AJ has a mandatory defence of his IBF and WBA and WBO world titles against Kubrat Pulev pencilled in for December time but Fury is keen on bringing forward their Battle of Britain.

He added: 'I saw him get knocked out by Andy Ruiz Jr and then go back to his corner and jack it in.

'I don't think the rematch performance was a masterclass, that rematch was like watching paint dry.

'I have been in loads of dog fights and won them all, he has been in one and got beat.

Fury's proposed third fight has been repeatedly pushed back and does not have a new date yet

'Joshua is not man enough for me. Have you ever seen a knife go through butter before?

'I knock AJ out in three rounds. How would he get out the way of me? Is he fleet footed enough to get away from me?

'I would cut him down in two, it is not about tactics, it is about balls, guts and determination and I have those in abundance.

'Once this fight gets made I will show you what to do with a bodybuilder like that, you cut him in two.

'He jacked against Ruiz and he will do it again, once you have quit once you will quit again.'
