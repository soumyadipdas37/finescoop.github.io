Florida resident Bounty Cheramy, 22, was charged with driving under the influence after he crashed his Mazda car into an electronic road sign that said 'Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over' with a BAC level twice the legal limit

A Florida resident was arrested for drunk driving after crashing his car into an electronic road sign that said 'Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over', officials say.

Bounty Cheramy, 22, was arrested early Sunday after he slammed his Mazda into the sign trailer that displayed Charlotte County Sheriff’s Office’s campaign against drunk driving.

Police found Cheramy outside his car around 12.30am on the Tamiami Trail in Port Charlotte.

Cheramy’s car sustained 'heavy front-end damage' in the incident and the roadway sign was knocked over.

Cheramy told police he was talking to a friend on the phone when he 'suddenly struck something' but was unsure 'what he had struck or how he was hit', according to the arrest affidavit.

Police said he smelled of alcohol and was swaying back and forth and could not focus on the deputy’s questions, according to The Smoking Gun. 

'He was oblivious to the fact that he ran over that sign,' Charlotte County Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer Claudette Bennett told NBC 2.

'In this case, the gentleman who was driving had no idea he even hit anything,' she added.

Cheramy claimed he had been studying with a friend before getting behind the wheel that night.

Cheramy was given a series of field sobriety tests and took two breath tests, which found blood alcohol content levels at .166 and .161, twice the .08 legal limit in Florida.  

The Charlotte County Sheriff’s Office said they often place drunk driving safety signs in 'problem areas' to educate drivers.

He was charged with DUI and DUI damage to property or another person. He was bonded out on $6,000. 

He is scheduled for arraignment on September 16.
