Within hours of posting his affectionate birthday message, the tweet had been shared nearly 20 thousand times and liked nearly 200 thousand times and counting.

The film features an all-star ensemble cast in addition to Zendaya and Timothee including, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa and Javier Bardem.

Both the 1984 and 2020 films were based on a novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert in 1965. The book also spawned a mini series in 2000.    

Dune follows Chalamet's Atreides and his family as they embark on a trip to desert mining planet Arrakis to oversee the extraction of melange, the most valuable substance in the universe.

A royal decree awards Arrakis to Duke Leto Atreides and ousts his bitter enemies, the Harkonnens.

However, when the Harkonnens violently seize back their fiefdom, it is up to Paul, Leto's son, to lead the Fremen, the natives of Arrakis, in a battle for control of the planet and its spice.

The official trailer of the much-hyped film is set for an early September release and the motion picture will hit theaters on December 18.

Zendaya, meanwhile, has been working on season two of her dark HBO teen drama Euphoria. Production on season two was scuppered due to the coronavirus.

The birthday girl did give anxious fans a glimmer of hope for new episodes back in August when she told told Jimmy Kimmel Live guest host Ben Platt that a possible 'bridge episode' is in the pipeline.

'We're trying to figure out how to eventually be able to create a season two that we're all really proud of and get all the best out of it that we want but also still being very safe,' she explained. 

'So, we might end up doing a little bridge episode. I don't really know how to describe it, but an episode that we can do with a limited amount of people in a safer environment that can, I don't know, give people something.'

She went on to say that season two of the series had been shut down because of the pandemic just two days before they had been scheduled to begin shooting. 

The critically acclaimed series earned Zendaya her first Emmy nod for her starring role as teenage drug addict, Rue.
