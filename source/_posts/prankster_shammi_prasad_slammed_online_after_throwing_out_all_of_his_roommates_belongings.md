A serial prankster with more than 13million followers has been accused of 'crossing the line' after filming the moment he threw out all of his brother's belongings from their home.

Shammi Prasad, from Queensland, decided to remove everything his brother and roommate Jayden owned as payback for him continually staying at his girlfriend's house.

Upon Jayden's return Prasad was seen in fits of laughter as his brother walked into his empty bedroom only to learn his beloved items were lying in the bottom of a skip bin.

But many of his followers took aim at Prasad, adding the 'disgusting' prank that was filmed last week had gone too far.

'So this is now the third weekend in a row Jayden's gone away to stay with his missus and we all know Saturdays are for the boys,' Prasad says at the start of the video.

'If he's not going to be here for a Saturday, he doesn't deserve to be here at all.'

Footage shows the prankster tossing Jayden's speakers, a full-length mirror, a television and a mattress into the skip bin.

Jayden eventually returned home to find an empty room with even the closet and drawers completely stripped.

After learning his items had been thrown in the bin, Jayden then stormed out of the home while his brother and the cameraman erupted into laughter.

Prasad is known for his outrageous pranks but many were unimpressed with the video.

'This crossed a line,' one wrote.
