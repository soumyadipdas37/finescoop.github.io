Speaking to panellists Christine Lampard, Carol McGiffin, Kelle Bryan and Stacey Solomon, Katherine opened up on her lockdown experiences, admitting she misses being on stage, but that she has enjoyed spending this quality time with her loved ones.

She said of lockdown: 'It actually has been really lovely. Obviously I miss being out there and I can’t wait to be back on the stage and back with the orchestra and the audiences. 

'But I don’t think I’ve ever been in the same house as my husband for anywhere near this amount of time, ever! So we’ve had to get used to living with each other as well.'
