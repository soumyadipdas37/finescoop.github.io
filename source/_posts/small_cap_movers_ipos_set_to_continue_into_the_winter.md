A resurgence in IPOs is underway following the dearth of new listings seen during the coronavirus crisis.

Coppa Club and Tavolino owner Various Eateries this week announced plans to float on the junior market, hoping to raise up to £25million to capitalise on the crisis in the hospitality industry.

The founder is restaurant superstar Hugh Osmond, who grew Pizza Express from a small chain of 12 restaurants to a 367-strong estate at the turn of the millennium.

London has seen plenty of fundraisings this year from listed companies as early pandemic rescue issues to strengthen balance sheets turned into opportunistic fundraisers during the summer, particularly as the life sciences sector needed support for COVID-19 projects.

But after consultancy Elixirr launched the first 'lockdown IPO' in July, the market has made a decisive move to traditional growth capital according to finnCap. The broker adds we should expect more flotations this winter, as companies are attracted by a functional regulatory framework allowing them to raise capital with relative ease.

'The equity capital markets have shown themselves to be a good place to be,' said Christopher Raggett, co-head of corporate finance at the broker. 'IPOs are looking more attractive.'

Looking at this week's performance, the AIM All-Share rose 0.9 per cent to 955, under-performing the FTSE 100 index's 3.8 per cent jump to 6,022.

Among the risers, project portfolio and performance management software firm i-nexus Global soared 75 per cent to 5p after boasting its sales pipeline was rebuilt to pre-coronavirus levels.

Elsewhere, recruiter Hydrogen Group climbed 43 per cent after revealing plans to go private and buy out shareholders at 40p a share.

Remaining in the biotech space, Redx Pharma jumped 18 per cent to 65p after unveiling a new collaboration with US company Jazz Pharmaceuticals to discover and develop two targeted cancer therapies.

Moving on, driver monitoring technology firm Seeing Machines shot up 28 per cent to 4p after signing an initial deal with a global semiconductor company to license its Occula Neural Processing Unit.

Turning to the fallers, Phimedix slumped 78 per cent to 0.9p after announcing it has until September 14 to instigate a reverse takeover, otherwise shares will be suspended.
