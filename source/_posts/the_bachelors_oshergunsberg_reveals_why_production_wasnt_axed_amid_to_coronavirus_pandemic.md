Osher Gunsberg has revealed why producers decided to continue The Bachelor via Zoom rather than abandon the series when COVID-19 hit. 

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph this week, the 46-year-old explained that it didn't make sense to stop the season altogether.  

'We were pretty deep into filming and it didn't make sense to abandon the series, and we knew we had to finish it,' he told the publication.

Osher pointed out that it would have been unfair to Locky Gilbert and the women on the show to axe the season altogether. 

'These people had all put their lives on the line hoping to find love and we wanted to give them that chance so we did everything we could to make that happen,' Osher said. 

The Bachelor was forced to suspend on-site production of the show back in March.

In a world first, The Bachelor continued production via digital means, including Zoom.

Osher confirmed that contestants had each other's phone numbers and communicated regularly while the show was being produced in lockdown.  

In the promo for next week's episodes, Osher tells the remaining contestants that The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.

After an emotionally-charged rose ceremony, Osher pulls Locky aside to explain that they 'can't keep everybody safe' and he must say goodbye immediately.

The adventurous heartthrob is then seen revealing the situation to the ladies, adding: 'It just sucks to leave all you guys.'   

'You never want to say goodbye, especially not this way... A lot of my heart's been ripped out,' he tells producers. 

While filming on location was suspended, Locky instead did 'virtual dates' via Zoom with the women, which they have dubbed as 'love in lockdown'.

The Bachelor continues on Channel Ten, Wednesday, 7.30pm
