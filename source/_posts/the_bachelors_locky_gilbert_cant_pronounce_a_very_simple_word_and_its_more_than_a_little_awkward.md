Locky Gilbert's mispronunciation of the word 'girl' did not go unnoticed during Thursday's finale of The Bachelor.

The 31-year-old reality star repeatedly referred to the show's finalists, Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska, as 'giwls'.

Talking about Irena, 31, Locky admitted she was 'everything' he could ever want in a 'giwlfriend'.

'Irena's one of the most caring people I've ever met. She's everything you want in a giwlfriend,' he said. 

'I see a future with her, I see a family with her, I can see it's so perfect with Irena that I don't wanna mess it up.'

Venting their frustration on Twitter, fans also noticed Locky's seeming inability to pronounce the word 'girl'.

'I just want Locky to learn how to say the word "girl". Too much to ask?' asked one viewer.

Locky appeared torn between both Irena and Bella, 25, throughout the show's finale, telling both girls he loved them.

'I would rather only be in love with one girl, but I'm in love with both of them,' he confessed, before ultimately choosing Irena.
