Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is set to join Center Parcs owner Brookfield Asset Management to lead its push into sustainable investing. 

The 55-year-old will be vice-chairman at the Canadian investment firm, which manages more than £400billion of savers' money. 

He will act as the head of its environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing.

His pay has not been disclosed. The job is the latest environment-focused position he has taken on since his time at the Bank ended this year. 

The Canadian is the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance, and is finance adviser to the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow next year. 

Brookfield chief executive Bruce Flatt said: 'Mark's insights and perspectives will add tremendous value to our global investing activities for the benefit of our investors.' 

Mounting investor focus on ESG has forced major UK companies to make changes – for example mining giant BHP will sell its thermal coal assets.
