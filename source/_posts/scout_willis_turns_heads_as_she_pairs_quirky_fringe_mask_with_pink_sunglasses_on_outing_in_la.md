Last week, Scout posted a sweet snap of her pup to her Instagram and alongside it, she gushed about what the dog means to her. 

'This dog...I cannot even begin to put words together to accurately describe my devotion to this magical, mystical creature that I have the sacred privilege of caring for,' she wrote.

'I consider Grandma one of my closest friends and despite the fact that I when I found her I wasn’t even interested in having a dog, she is the absolute dog love of my life! GRANDMAAAAAAAA I just love her so much.'
