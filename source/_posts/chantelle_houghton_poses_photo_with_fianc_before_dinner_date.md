The photo comes after Chantelle Houghton said she still loves her ex-husband Preston.

The beauty waxed lyrical about her former flame, saying the Ordinary Boys singer is a very special person and he will even be invited to her wedding.  

She told The Sun: 'Preston is a one-off person. What we had was real back then and I still love him so much.'

The mother-of-one admits that property developer Michael, 35, who she lives with in Wickford, Essex, is perfect for her.

The pair have only been dating for a short time but have known each other for nine years as Michael was Chantelle's mother's neighbour. 

She said at the time of their engagement: 'OK, I know it's lockdown and isolation but he just asked me to marry him: I said YES. I will love him for ever.'  

They had only started dating in January and decided to move in together at the start of lockdown.

And by April they were engaged after Michael got down on one knee while they were making spaghetti bolognese at home.

Chantelle found fame on Celebrity Big Brother 4 in 2006, where she was tasked with trying to the convince her fellow housemates she was a genuine star, by claiming she was a member of the pop group Kandy Floss.   

She went onto win that series of CBB and sparked a romance with Ordinary Boys singer Preston.

They married seven months after leaving the house, before splitting in June 2007.

She previously admitted that the pair are still friends despite their turbulent relationship. 

Appearing on This Morning recently, she told hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford: 'We're still in touch, we actually did a photo shoot together.

'It's lovely, obviously the romance didn't work out but we're still friends which is amazing.'
