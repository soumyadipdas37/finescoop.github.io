Animal rights activists linked to Extinction Rebellion have blockaded a Manchester slaughterhouse this afternoon.

Activists locked themselves onto coffins outside the entrance of Tulip pig slaughterhouse and a banner was laid outside the entrance which read 'ANIMAL FARMING = PANDEMICS & CLIMATE CRISIS'.

Demonstrators also climbed on the roof of the Pilgrim's Pride Ltd's slaughterhouse as part of the Animal Rebellion protest.

The group, which is aligned with Extinction Rebellion, said they took part in the demonstration to 'stand against the many injustices which face non-human animals, the workers, the climate and those that choose to take similar action.'

Harley McDonald-Eckersall, a spokesman for Animal Rebellion, said, 'We are shutting this slaughterhouse down because we see no lawful activity being done here. 

'It is contributing to the gassing of pigs, the destruction of our climate and the spread of deadly diseases between workers.'

Greater Manchester Police today confirmed that so far six people have been arrested - three men and three women - all on suspicion of aggravated trespassing. 

The individuals remain in custody for questioning. 

A spokesperson for Pilgrim's Pride Ltd said: 'We are working closely with the local police to resolve an issue regarding activists trespassing at our Ashton-under-Lyne site as safely and quickly as possible.

'While these activities are an inconvenience to operations, our main concern is ensuring the welfare of the animals in our care and the safety of our people, as well as the protesters who are putting their own safety at risk.'

Police said they are currently 'engaging' with a woman on the roof.
