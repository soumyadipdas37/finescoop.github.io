Emma Roberts has had quite the week, recently signing a first look deal, which includes a new TV series.

But the New York-born actress' most exciting bit of news is that she's expecting her first child.

She showed off her baby bump Monday in a strapless one-piece bathing suit, as she took a dip while celebrating Labor Day at home in Los Angeles with partner Garrett Hedlund.

The 29-year-old donned a navy blue swimsuit with red floral embellishments, paired with red Mulberry cat-eye sunglasses.  

She and Hedlund, 36, confirmed their first pregnancy last week, while revealing that they're expecting a boy. 

Roberts served goddess vibes, showing off her pregnant belly in a white off-the-shoulder dress, while cozying up to the Tron: Legacy actor.

'Love you,' Aunt Julia Roberts commented, while Scream Queens costar (and fellow new mom) Lea Michele wrote: 'You will be the greatest mama. I love you Em! Boy moms together.'

A source recently told People that the couple has gotten 'very serious' in their relationship, and they are 'beyond excited to be having a boy.'

The insider added of the parents-to-be: 'Garrett thinks Emma is amazing. They will be great parents.' 

The American Horror Story star was first romantically linked to Hedlund back in March of 2019, shortly after calling off her engagement with Evan Peters, 33, after seven years together. 

She recently celebrated some other big news, signing a first-look deal with Hulu, focusing on adapting books for television.

Inked through her production company Belletrist TV, her first project will be an adaptation of Carola Lovering's 2018 novel Tell Me Lies.

Since Belletrist was started by Roberts as a book club with pal Karah Preiss (who also serves as executive producer), they shouldn't have any trouble coming up with more content.

Roberts told British Vogue last month: 'I always love the feeling of starting a new book that you’ve been excited to read. Especially lately, just diving into a new book and really getting to spend the day or the night reading has been such a luxury. 

'It gets me so excited, because then I keep thinking of all the friends I’m going to get a copy for, if they’re going to like it, and what we’re going to talk about. I just think a good book is just the best conversation starter.'
