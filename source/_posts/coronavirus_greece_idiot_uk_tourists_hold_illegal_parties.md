Idiot' British tourists are holding illegal 'f*** corona' parties in Zante where they shun masks and social distancing.

Footage shows drunk clubbers descending on bars, beaches and boats despite the ongoing pandemic.

Punters raved about making it to the island despite the virus and shared pictures under #Zante2020 during parties in the resort town Laganas.

'F*** Corona' raves were being held on beaches when the pubs and bars closed, with local police struggling to disperse them.

It comes amid a spike in infections on those returning from the Greek party island as the resort's vice mayor blasted it as 'mayhem'.

Charalambos Varvarigos made the comments and requested more officers from Greece to cope with the crowds.

A club worker told the Sun: 'Most bars and clubs have respected the rules. These idiots have spoilt it for everyone.'

They anonymous source added: 'There are illegal beach parties organised every night called ''F*** Covid-19 Parties''.

'Lots of people are very upset about what these clowns have done, and lots of people will now be catching Covid.'

Holidaymakers returning from Zante have been forced to self-isolate and Tui stopped flights there after six clusters of the virus later emerged back in the Britain.

But there are fresh fears that there are more bringing back the deadly bug but are asymptomatic.

Top grammar school Sir William Borlase in Buckinghamshire had to delay its reopening this week after 20 students came home from Zante with Covid-19.

The bar shared video on its Facebook with the caption: 'We can't dance inside but no one stops us from dancing in the street.'

More clips from the island sees ravers packed on to boats and in other clubs flouting social distancing rules and few wearing masks.

The Greek island of Zante has since tried to crack down on visitors failing to socially distance.

Boat parties are now banned and gatherings of more than nine people – indoors and outdoors – have been banned. Masks must be worn in public spaces.

But police commander Sotiris Siatis has said there are not enough in his team to enforce the restrictions.

Wales on Tuesday advised passengers returning from Zante to quarantine for two weeks and offered Covid-19 tests within 48 hours of their return.

The UK Government has decided not to impose restrictions on people entering England from Greece and Portugal.

Scotland is also including Greece on its quarantine list, though in Wales the restriction only applies to the six named Greek islands.

These are Mykonos, Zakynthos, Lesvos, Paros, Antiparos and Crete. Local media reports say there have been 25 infections on the island, none being British.
