Savvy flatmates who launched a gut health business during the coronavirus pandemic have made $250,000 as lockdown spending boomed. 

Reever Botha and Vlad Kosovac launched PuraU in March this year as Australians were ordered to stay home due to the COVID-19 outbreak. 

But the timing couldn't have been better for the 25-year-old business partners, who earned $25,000 in the first three weeks their product was on the market. 

Mr Botha said it was 'daunting' launching their Gut Cleanse Kit as the pandemic took hold, but the pair went on 'full steam ahead'.

'We're happy to say we launched through COVID,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It was a shinning light for us, E-commerce has boomed. People are at home and have the opportunity to buy things on their phone.'

Mr Kosovac said the global health crisis meant the business partners needed to refocus their launch plan.

'We initially said we need to work a lot smarter, use the pandemic as a strategy.  It was about acing our marketing,' he said.

After four months, the business made $250,000.  

It's been a 'stressful' road to success for the pair, who first met at a business seminar in Sydney.

Mr Botha had completed a bachelor of business management at Queensland University of Technology and begun to attend seminars in the field.  

'I knew I wanted to have my own business, I didn't want to go down the corporate path,' he explained.   

The pair 'bonded' at the seminar and kept in contact for a couple of months.

They met for coffee in Brisbane and the rest is history. 

'F*** it dude,' Mr Botha recalled. 'Let's start our business together'. 

The pair quickly decided to focus their product on digestion, as they are both passionate about health and fitness.   

'Our guts have been rotten our whole life. So that's one thing we're passionate about, so we thought lets smash it out of the park,' Mr Botha said.

Mr Kosovac, who is from Melbourne, then moved to Queensland to live with Mr Botha in his parents' Brisbane home. 

While he misses Melbourne, Mr Kosovac said he would have moved anywhere for the benefit of the business.

'I gotta do what's best for the business. It didn't matter where,' he said. 

The business partners spent about six months conducting research and developing a plan. They then found a manufacturer and received approval from Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).

The pair run the business from Mr Botha's family home and a mini-warehouse but are concerned they're running out of space as the business continues to take off.

'We found it harder the more we grew, this house isn't ginormous. We have to go downstairs, ship the products,' Mr Kosovac said.

Mr Botha added: 'When we started growing phenomenally, I was very nervous.

'We don't have the processes in place to meet the growth.'

The pair, who are 'taking every day as it comes', are seeking a commercial warehouse and are looking to hire. 

'We're happy,' Mr Botha said.

'We spent a lot of time money and effort for 12 months without seeing a return. 

'There were times when we wanted to give up. We're just happy we've stuck with it, we've done everything right.' 

Mr Kosovac said the global health crisis meant the business partners needed to refocus their launch plan. 'We initially said we need to work a lot smarter, use the pandemic as a strategy. It was about acing our marketing,' he said

The pair are now hoping to take their business into retail, with their sights set on Priceline. 

The PuraU three-part Gut Cleanse Kit supports natural cleansing and a healthy immune system.

The pills - which are vegan and Australian made - can relieve acne, eczema, rosacea, bloating, indigestion, gassiness and gut inflammation.  

All PuraU products have been developed by a naturopathic and herbal expert and the goods were permitted for use by the TGA.  

The website reads: 'Good people deserve good guts'.  

'We're here to help you calm those gut gremlins and get your insides feeling shipshape'.  

Mr Botha concluded: 'Throughout this pandemic, it's shown why people should be on top of their health.'
