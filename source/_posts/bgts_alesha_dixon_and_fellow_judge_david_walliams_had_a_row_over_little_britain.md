Britain's Got Talent judges David Walliams and Alesha Dixon reportedly had a war of words after the singer told him his Little Britain antics were 'inappropriate'.

The TV star, 41, is believed to have made the comments in jest, however according to the Sun David, 49, was upset and left the studio as soon as filming was over.

David's old Little Britain characters included black woman Desiree DeVere and bearded transvestite Emily Howard. 

Awks! Britain's Got Talent judges David Walliams and Alesha Dixon reportedly had a war of words after the singer told him his Little Britain antics were 'inappropriate'

The spat allegedly began during the deliberation stages of the show, and a source revealed: 'When the artist who Alesha had backed got through she basically turned to David and said, 'Well that's payback for all your inappropriate Little Britain antics.' 

'It was quite catty, although Alesha later insisted she was only joking. But David was stunned. Obviously he is not racist or homophobic, or anything-phobic in the slightest — he was upset.

'Words were exchanged, and the rest of filming was pretty awkward.' 

Claims: The TV star, 41, is believed to have made the comments in jest, however according to the Sun David, 49, was upset and left the studio as soon as filming was over

Despite the awkward exchange it has been claimed that neither party has held a grudge and they remain pals.

An insider revealed that Alesha has insisted that her comments to David were only made as a joke. 

MailOnline have contacted representatives for David, Alesha and BGT.

In June, David Walliams and his Little Britain co-star Matt Lucas apologised for their use of blackface after the series was removed from streaming services.

In a joint statement the pair insisted it was 'wrong' to portray characters of other races, but reiterated it's something they have apologised for in the past.

At the time, Little Britain was removed from streaming services including Netflix and Britbox following concerns its use of blackface was no longer acceptable in wake of the Black Lives Matter Movement.

Apologising: In a joint statement the pair insisted it was 'wrong' to portray characters of other races, but reiterated it's something they have apologised for in the past

In the statement posted to Twitter, David wrote: 'Matt & I have both spoken publicly in recent years of our regret that we played characters of other races. Once again we want to make it clear that it was wrong & we are very sorry.'

Matt went onto share the same statement with fans, after Little Britain was removed from several streaming services earlier this week.

It came amid claims Netflix are no longer in talks with Matt and David about reviving Little Britain, as bosses were concerned about backlash given the show's current controversies.

A source told The Daily Star: 'Netflix bosses were really keen to make a new series of Little Britain. The plan was to give Matt and David even more license to be controversial. 

'In the current climate, Netflix can't be seen to be championing offensive comedy.

'The chances of any revival at this stage are slim-to-none.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives for David Walliams, Matt Lucas and Netflix for further comment at the time. 

Earlier this week Alesha told critics to 'kiss my black a**' as she threw her support behind her Britain's Got Talent co-judge Ashley Banjo in the wake of the controversy surrounding Diversity's Black Lives Matter-inspired performance.

Anymore? The decision comes as Netflix was earlier this year said to have been in discussions with them about making a new series of Little Britain 

Alesha waded into the ongoing row about the politicisation of the ITV1 talent series as Banjo, 31, shared a post on Instagram from a critic telling him to keep politics out of entertainment.

Alesha commented 'they can kiss my black a**' under an Instagram post from a disgruntled social media user, who said: 'We the Great British Public will only support you if you entertain us and do not say anything about racism.'

The comment referred to the BLM-inspired dance which sparked more than 10,000 complaints to media watchdog Ofcom when it was performed on Britain's Got Talent on Saturday night.

Critics claimed the dance, which was a 'take on the unprecedented events of 2020', had politicised the entertainment show, with one Twitter user insisting 'they are a dance group not a political movement.'

The full post - which also referred to boxer Anthony Joshua and F1 champion Lewis Hamilton - read: 'Dear Joshua, Hamilton, Banjo and any other black public figures.  

We the Great British Public will only support you if you entertain us and do not say anything about racism. Thank you for your understanding.'  

Ashley shared a screenshot of a message written by a critic to his Instagram, and said in the caption: '1. You do not represent or speak for the Great British public. 

'2. Silence was never and will never be an option. 3. Change is inevitable... Get used to it.'  

Alesha wasn't the only celebrity to throw her support behind Ashley, as fellow Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden commented with a heart emoji.

JLS star Aston Merrygold added: 'It's like that yeah! Guess it's time to speak louder for the people that can't quite hear!' 

Former Britain's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan retweeted a post made by Diversity member Ashley, adding: 'I thought it was great. Ignore the haters, Ashley. Proud of you.'
