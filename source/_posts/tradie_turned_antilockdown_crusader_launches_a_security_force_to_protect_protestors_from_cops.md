Nathan Glover, from Mt Eliza in Melbourne's south, masterminded P.A.T.I.R

An anti-lockdown coronavirus sceptic has launched a makeshift security force to 'protect' protesters from police.

Nathan Glover, from Mt Eliza in Melbourne's south, masterminded the 'protection and tactical incident response' group known as P.A.T.I.R when police shut down anti-lockdown protests in the CBD during Stage Four lockdown. 

The 43-year-old is a regular at the demonstrations and has pledged his allegiance to future events, despite receiving large fines for flouting stay at home directives.

In a video released on Facebook on Saturday, the tradie modelled his new protective wear, which includes helmets, chest plates and motorbike vests. 

Mr Glover said the armour is necessary because it could 'take the heavy handed treatment' from police.

'I am not there to attack anyone, or fight anyone. If the police want to be brutal, I am there,' he said.   

'If you need care, P.A.T.I.R will be there. Our guys are highly trained. We're there for you guys to do what you do without getting messed up.'

In the video, he is seen hitting his arms, legs and torso with a stick while covered in armour to demonstrate the strength of the gear.

He wrote on social media that the makeshift taskforce is necessary because police 'get pleasure out of hurting people and have the emotional range of a sack of potatoes'. 

In subsequent video shared on Tuesday, Mr Glover introduced a long piece of metal wiring to add to his protective gear.

He said the metal had been donated by a screen door company that did not want to be identified.

Mr Glover also claimed the lockdowns in Melbourne ruined his music career and 'decimated' the live scene, according to the Herald Sun.

He added that he doesn't think COVID-19 is as much of a threat as leaders say.

'The fact they say it is contagious, this doesn't make any sense. It doesn't transmit through contagion,' he said. 

A contagion is classified as an illness that can spread from person to person through direct contact.

Mr Glover also claimed the government turned the city into a 'prison', and risks a $1,652 fine if he is involved in a future protest

According Health Direct, run by the Australian government, the virus spreads through droplets transmitted by touching an infected person, or an object or surface where an infected person has been.

Mr Glover risks a $1,652 fine if he is involved in a future protest.

Victorian Police are preparing for another round of demonstrations this weekend.

On Sunday, up to 250 residents amassed at Queen Victoria Market for a second day of riots as tensions escalate over the city's tough stage four restrictions, which prohibit Melburnians from leaving home for non-essential reasons. 

Protesters were outnumbered by a sea of police officers who flooded the scene to break-up the demonstration

Protesters chanting 'Freedom' and 'Power to the people' were outnumbered by officers, with some demonstrators throwing fruit at police after raiding market stalls. 

Victoria Police arrested 74 people and issued at least 176 infringement notices for breaching the Chief Health Officer directions. 

Officers said many protestors were aggressive and threatened violence towards officers, however no members of the force were injured.

'It was extremely disappointing to see people not just protesting, but putting the lives of other Victorians at risk despite all the warnings,' a Victoria Police spokesperson said.

'Our investigations into this protest will continue, and we expect to issue further fines once the identity of individuals has been confirmed.'

Victoria police warned that anyone caught breaching COVID-19 directives will be punished.

Melburnians will be fined almost $5000 if caught trying to sneak into regional Victoria under a tough new penalty. 

Melbourne remains in a Stage Four lockdown, meaning residents cannot leave their houses without a valid reason, and restrictions are in place to limit movement more than 5km from a person's home.

The restrictions remain in place, and both a State of Emergency and State of Disaster, have been extended a further four weeks.

On Wednesday, Victoria recorded eight new coronavirus deaths and 42 infections. The state's active cases dropped below 1,000.
