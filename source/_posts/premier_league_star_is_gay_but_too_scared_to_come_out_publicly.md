A gay Premier League player has revealed he is too scared to come out publicly because 'the game has not yet moved on.'

In an open letter to Justin Fashanu's niece, the star described how living a secret life was having a 'massive impact' on his mental health.

He added that it was 'virtually impossible' to have a relationship. 

The footballer who has spoken to some of his teammates about his sexuality told Amal Fashanu that he has known he is gay since he was 14.

In the letter first published by The Sun, the player wrote: 'Even though society has moved on massively since I was a teenager, the game simply hasn't.

'Those running it need to put more measures in place so gay players know they will get the support they need.

'The powers-that-be are only playing lip service to the issue.'

The soccer star's letter comes after another anonymous gay player's letter was published by the newspaper in July.

Ms Fashanu, who runs the Justin Fashanu Foundation, said that the player felt a 'weight off his shoulders' after reading that letter.

'I hope to put the two in touch to discuss their situations,' the 32-year-old activist said.

He killed himself in 1998 aged 38.

Today there are no openly gay footballers playing in the UK.

The Premier League says it 'remains committed to supporting any who want to come out.'
