She is known for her wild antics on Ex On The Beach. 

And Jemma Lucy commanded attention once more in a scarlet top and mini skirt as she headed out for lunch in Mayfair on Sunday afternoon.   

The reality star, 32, displayed her sensational curves as she strutted through the city with her pals and headed for a bite to eat.

In a bold move, she decided to go braless and she contained her ample assets in the strappy backless vest.

Jemma was also close to exposing her pert derrière as she donned a metallic leather mini skirt with splits on either side. 

The reality star added a designer touch with her glittery Louboutin trainers and she injected a splash of colour with her turquoise clutch bag.

Jemma styled her raven tresses in a high ponytail and opted for a full coverage makeup look. 

As well as her toned curves, the star revealed her multiple tattoos as she strolled. 

Jemma is never one to shy away from controversy, and previously defended using the N-word, citing the fact that her daughter is mixed-raced. 

She shocked fans in December when she filmed herself singing along to a rap song, which used the slur.

After receiving a fierce backlash from her followers, Jemma hit back with a video claiming it was 'not her fault' as she was simply singing along to the lyrics, before referencing that she has black friends and also a mixed race child.

Jemma, who welcomed her first child in May 2019, shared a clip citing: 'So the moral of the story is, it's not my fault when the rappers use the N word in songs.' 

Back in December 2018, Jemma stunned fans when she announced she was pregnant, and the controversial star admitted that she debated not going through with having her first child yet decided to 'do the right thing'.

In her initial pregnancy announcement, she vowed to never reveal the father's identity after a secret two-year romance.

However, she has now divulged details of their 'toxic' relationship which included a kidnap attempt and bids to abort her child.

She welcomed her daughter on May 25, and has chosen not to disclose her baby girl's name or share any pictures of her face.
