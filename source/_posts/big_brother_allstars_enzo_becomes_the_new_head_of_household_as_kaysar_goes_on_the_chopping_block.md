After his longtime friend Janelle Pierzina was evicted last week, Kaysar Ridha has found himself on the chopping block once again on Sunday's night episode of Big Brother All-Stars.

Thursday night's episode ended with a unique contest to determine the next Head of Household, where the houseguests had to roll tennis balls up large inclines and get the balls to land in three holes.

While Kaysar tried his hardest to win and secure his safety, he would ultimately find himself on the chopping block again, with a rather surprising selection made by the new Head of Household, Enzo Palumbo.

Tyler says in confession that he can't have Kaysar to win because that would be very bad for him because he was gunning for Kaysar.
