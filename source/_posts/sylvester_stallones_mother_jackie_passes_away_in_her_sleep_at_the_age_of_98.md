Sylvester Stallone's mother Jackie has passed away at the age of 98, as confirmed by her youngest son Frank.

In a post shared to Instagram, Frank stated that Jackie 'died in her sleep as she had wished' on Monday morning.

'This morning my brothers and I lost our mother Jackie Stallone . She was the mother to four children, Tommy, Sylvester, Frankie and my late sister Toni Ann,' began the 70-year-old Grammy Award winner.

He wrote that Jackie 'was a remarkable woman' who worked out 'everyday' and was 'full of spunk and fearless.'

'It was hard not to like her, she was very eccentric and flamboyant person.'

Frank provided some impressive details regarding his mother's life, including that she 'lived through prohibition, the depression and World War II.'  

'I would talk to her for hours about the 20's 30's and 40's. It was a history lesson. Her mind was as sharp as a razor till the day she died.

'She never wore a mask a true revolutionary gal. I guess I'm drowning my emotions in tears and to much vino. But when you've known someone for 70 yrs it tough and sad.'

Frank informed his following that Jackie 'had seven grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren' and that his older brother Sylvester 'took care of her like a Queen for all of her life.'

'I will never be able to call my mom again or have her yell at me why I never got married . But we all loved her and her sprit to survive and prevail . I'll miss you always mommy. @officialslystallone,' he concluded.   

Jackie also leaves behind husband of over two-decades Stephen Marcus Levine.

She is also mother to late actress Toni D'Alto, who passed away at the age of 48 after a lengthy cancer battle in 2012. She shared Toni with ex husband Anthony Filiti.

Although she happened to give birth to three famous faces, Jackie - who dubbed herself the #QueenofHollywood on Instagram - also achieved fame during her lifetime.

Jackie was one of the key creators and trainers on G.L.O.W., The Gorgeous Girls of Wrestling, 'a syndicated TV show from Las Vegas that ran for five years in the 1980s,' as stated by her official website.

She always had a deep love for fitness and for championing women in the competitive, televised athletic sphere.

Jackie, born Jacqueline Frances, ran away from home at the age of 15 and briefly worked as an aerialist in the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Baily's The Greatest Show on Earth.

As she grew older, she became 'the first woman to have a daily TV show on exercise and weight lifting in Washington, D.C,' which led to her opening her own all-female gym called Barbella's.

Jackie is also known for appearing in the popular Richard Simmons Silver Foxes exercise tapes, which provided low-impact exercise routines for senior citizens. 

But Jackie's biggest passion was astrology, having written a famous book on the subject titled Star Power: An Astrological Guide to Supersuccess, which was published in 1989.

She studied astrology for 15-years under the supervision of a plethora of acclaimed astrologers, including the 'protegees of Evangeline Adams, the greatest astrologer of the Twentieth Century.' 

Jackie's passion, eventually, led her to getting 'astrology accepted as an accredited course in many colleges and universities.'

Stallone also appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother in 2005, where she had an iconic run-in with former daughter-in-law Brigitte Nielsen. 

Brigitte was married to Sylvester from 1985 until their divorce in 1987 and she had not seen Jackie face-to-face since then.

Jackie was the season's 'surprise ninth guest,' so when the Rocky IV star saw her former mother-in-law enter the house, her jaw totally dropped. 

The moment made its way into reality TV history due to the dramatic nature of Jackie's entrance. She had on an extravagant fur coat and seemed to enjoy Brigitte's unfiltered shock.

Up until her death, Jackie could be seen engaging in weight lifting exercises, which she often filmed and uploaded to her Instagram page.

She would also refer to herself as Mamma Rambo, Mamma Stallone and Mamma Rocky as a way of paying homage to her Sylvester's most legendary roles.

The eccentric socialite, who boasts over 26,000 followers on the platform, achieved internet fame for her ultra Hollywood lifestyle and her incredibly youthful demeanor.

She also used her page to gush over her famous offspring, to express her love for thrift shopping, and to celebrate her longstanding marriage to husband Stephen Marcus Levine.

The pair, who wed in 1998, most recently appeared on Jackie's Instagram on New Year's Eve.

'Happy New Year. I feel deep in my heart that 2020 will be a great year for America! We will stop sticking our noses into other people’s business and start paying attention to ourselves!' she wrote, while sharing a toast with Stephen.
