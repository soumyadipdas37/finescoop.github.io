Brits are making the most of the sunshine today ahead of wrapping up warm as temperatures are expected to take a tumble with lows of 13C later this week.

Today has seen highs of 19C and sunny skies but the balmy temperatures are set to drop when wet and windy weather arrives on Wednesday. 

Rain is expected across the south west of the country on Thursday and Friday, with the potential for thunder storms. And by the weekend temperatures will have plummeted to 13C.   

People were spotted making the most of the last of the good weather by walking through the Long Walk at Windsor Castle and others were spotted next to the Serpentine in Hyde Park. 

The West Woods on the edge of Wiltshire's Marlborough Downs seemed deserted despite the good weather.

Later today, a cold front will move eastwards across UK with a ridge of high pressure building in behind. Patchy rain and drizzle will move in from the west but it will be bright in the east. 

And the drizzly weather is set to continue throughout the country as it will be mostly cloudy with the odd spot of rain for a time in East Anglia and south-east England but it will be bright for the rest of England. It will be cloudy in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales with patchy rain slowly spreading eastwards. 

It will be cloudy with patchy rain and drizzle for a time in central, southern and south-east England, which will very slowly push eastwards through the day.

Tomorrow will be mainly dry but with a few showers in the south west as low pressure takes charge from Wednesday with wet and windy weather for most areas.

Wednesday is set to start off dry in the east but there will be cloud and heavy rain in the west, which will spread eastwards across all areas later and be accompanied by brisk winds. 

On Thursday, most areas will be bright although there will be scattered showers in south-west England. It is set to be grey with rain in northern and eastern Scotland 

Sunny spells and showers can be expected on Thursday, some thundery. And the heavy rain will continue into Friday with strong to gale force winds in the south.

A Met Office spokesman said: 'A weather front sitting across the UK will continue to move eastwards this Monday afternoon, bringing cloud and patchy rain to much of Scotland, Wales and northern and southwest England, with brighter conditions and a few showers following in Northern Ireland. 

'Away from the weather front in the east and southeast it’ll be a largely bright day with warm sunny spells.

'Tonight the band of cloud and patchy rain sitting across the UK will continue to move east and weaken, it’ll be mostly dry with clear spells either side of this and feeling chilly for many with a touch of frost in places.'
