Sydney Swans star Elijah Taylor has been arrested in Perth on Sunday. 

CCTV footage appeared to show Taylor being taken into custody by officers and put into a police vehicle in Langford, in the city's south east, at about 1.25pm. 

It's understood Taylor is being questioned by police at Cannington police station, 7News reports. 

The teenager's manager said he is cooperating with police, but no charges have been laid. 

 Taylor, 19, is being investigated by his team the Sydney Swans and the AFL over the allegations made on social media

Lekahni Pearce (pictured) - the now ex-girlfriend of 18-year-old Sydney Swans rookie Elijah Taylor who snuck into his AFL quarantine hub - made domestic violence allegations against the young footy player

Taylor was suspended last month for the remainder of the 2020 season after sneaking his then-girlfriend Lekahni Pearce, 18, into the Swans' AFL quarantine hub at Perth's Joondalup Resort.

Taylor's senior teammates reportedly discovered Ms Pearce in the hotel premises and raised the alarm. 

She had reportedly crossed a golf course to be reunited with her then boyfriend. 

Ms Pearce had just completed her own mandatory self-quarantine period after flying in from Sydney.

Taylor was sent home in the aftermath of the scandal, while his club was fined a total of $50,000 - with $25,000 suspended.

Earlier this month Ms Pearce made allegations of domestic violence against Taylor.

Ms Pearce alleged the acts took place three times in Sydney prior to the COVID-19 pandemic

She also shared a photo of her bruised face and levelled a series of accusations against the rising star in an Instagram post. 

Ms Pearce alleged the acts took place three times in Sydney prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.    

'The Sydney Swans are aware of allegations made on social media regarding first year player Elijah Taylor,' a statement read.

'The allegations are very serious and are being treated as such.

'The club had notified the AFL and is not in a position to comment further at this time.'

The AFL integrity unit is handling the investigation over the alleged incident.
