The 24-year-old midfielder has fallen down the pecking order at Emirates under Mikel Arteta

The Italian outfit would reportedly pay Arsenal a total of £22million for the transfer in two instalments of £11m.

Torreira made 39 appearances for the north London club last season, in which he scored two goals and supplied one assist.

However manager Mikel Arteta has opted for Mohamed Elneny and Granit Xhaka in the heart of the midfield this season.

Arsenal are keen to let Torreira leave during this transfer window in order to raise funds for new additions before the deadline in October.

Arteta's side opened their Premier League campaign in style on Saturday, sealing a comfortable 3-0 win at Fulham.
