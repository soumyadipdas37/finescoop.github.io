Hilaria Baldwin has revealed Alec stopped off to get pizza while she was having contractions on the way on the hospital, because 'he gets cranky when he's hungry'.

The couple welcomed their son, Eduardo Pau Lucas, two-weeks-ago and proudly showed him off via Zoom during their interview on Ellen, set to air on Wednesday.

The actor, 62, who has five children under seven with Hilaria, 36, as well as daughter Ireland, 24, talked about the perks of being an older dad and if he wants any more children.

Introducing Alec, Ellen said: 'You have a new baby, when are you going to stop?'

To which the Beetlejuice star joked: 'My wife is a collector, some people collect cars, others artwork, my wife collects babies. 

'When the baby gets to be two-years-old and they're not the vending machine like they used to be, we look at each other and think "time to have another baby".'

Ellen then asked: 'You had four boys in a row, but I know she wants to have a girl. Are you going to keep trying to have a girl? Is it that important?

Alec said: 'I'm not going to keep trying, I've done trying,' adding Hilaria would have to remarry if she wanted to have more children. 

Discussing how he stopped off for pizza while Hilaria was having contractions, Hilaria, holding Eduardo in her arms, said: 'In his defence it was my idea because the last two babies I had, I didn't invite him into the delivery room until I had my epidural, because he drives me crazy.

Ellen asked: 'You had four boys in a row, but I know she wants to have a girl. Are you going to keep trying to have a girl? Is it that important?' To which Alec said he is 'done trying'

'So this time round during Covid it's much more complicated so he had to come round with me. 

'We're walking around and my contractions start and I say "you need to eat something because later on I'm going to kill you if don't eat something because I'm not going to be able to handle you", so yes it was my idea'.

Talking of her newborn son, she added: 'He's not a girl but he's perfect.'

Alec and Hilaria are proud parents to Carmen, seven, Rafael, five, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, two. 

Talking about being an older father, Alec said: 'On one level you appreciate it more, when I was younger, work was primary I had to divide my time with that.'   

'But with all my sons they can be a bit curt from time to time, so I sometimes pretend I'm an old man and deaf at the dinner table and tell them "what did you say?".
