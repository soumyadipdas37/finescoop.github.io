A pair of $22 Kmart trousers are flying out of stock after being worn by one of Australia's top stylists - and they look almost identical to a designer pair more than 63 times the price.

Canberra fashion blogger 'This is Genevieve' sparked the rush by sharing a series of outfit photos on Instagram featuring the discount store's beige coloured 'Tapered Leg Pants'.Â 

The pants - which come in beige and black and are available in sizes six to 20 - sit high on the waist and hang loose in a flattering cut that can be cuffed at the ankles, creating the illusion of longer legs.

They are remarkably similar to $1,390 high-waisted trousers from Bottega Veneta, an Italian fashion house known for its luxury leathers and tailoring.

Both styles fasten at the waist with a hook and eye detail and have large belt loops, big enough to slide even the thickest accessories through.

Genevieve's followers couldn't believe the pants had come from the famously affordable retailer, with many noting the likeness to expensive pieces from designer labels.

Similar styles cost $109 from streetwear brand Stussy, $79 from Dickies and $99 from Australian e-commerce label Lioness.

'No WAY these are Kmart - I want!' one woman replied.

Another said the post had inspired her to buy beige trousers for the first time in years after almost a decade of shunning them for black.

Other gushing responses included 'wow, these are gorgeous', 'amazing!' and 'love'.

And it's not the first pair of low-priced Kmart trousers that have captured the imagination of Australian fashionistas this month.

Sydney fashion blogger Angel Perez, who posts on Instagram as 'Styling Mum and Bub', caught followers' attention in early September when she shared a series of outfit photos in the retailer's cream 'Pleated Jeans'.

They are remarkably similar to $295 palazzo pants from Australian designer label Aje, which is headquartered in Sydney's Paddington.

Both trousers have deep double-front pockets, flared hems and thick waistbands that sit high above the hips in a flattering style that conceals the tricky-to-tone expanse of the lower stomach.

The biggest difference is that Aje's are almost 12 times the price.

Women have been racing to Kmart to buy the 'perfectly elegant' discount dupe which looks considerably more expensive than its bargain tag.

Comments on stylist Angel Perez's Instagram reveal just how taken people are with the design, with responses including 'so elegant', 'love this look' and 'beautiful pants'.

'I love how high-waisted those trousers are!' one woman replied.

Another said she'd been inspired to buy them after seeing how flattering and well tailored they appeared on Ms Perez.
