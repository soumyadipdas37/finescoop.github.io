Lucy Hale appears to be stepping up her exercise routine and strength training.

The Pretty Little Liars alum, 31, headed out on her near-daily hike with weights firmly fastened around her ankles through the hills of Studio City in Los Angeles on Monday.

With the sun glaring down on yet another warm summer day, the Tennessee native showed off her petite figure in a grey and charcoal-black leggings and a matching grey crop top.

The crop top gave a hint of her toned midriff as she briskly walked along the winding trails, despite having the added weight on each of her legs. 

To help block out any harmful rays from the sun, Hale wore a black baseball cap over her dark tresses and stylish sunglasses.   

She also carried a container of water and had a black pack over her right shoulder that presumably held her phone any any other essentials.

During her solo hike, Hale opted to not wear a protective mask, but as soon as she reached a parking lot where people were congregating she quickly put one on. 

Earlier in the day, The Memphis-born star took to Instagram and shared a photo of herself with her mother with the headline: 'Happy birthday to this angel. I love you momma!!!!!'

In recent days, Hale has been working out with celebrity trainer Adam Nicklas, which has included using weights and resistance bands. 

Hale has had more time on her hands now that her Riverdale spinoff, Katy Keene, has been canceled by The CW after just one season. She has been very open about her disappointment over the musical comedy drama series ending 'prematurely' and how she wanted it to go on for many more seasons.
