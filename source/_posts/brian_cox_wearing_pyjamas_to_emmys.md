Brian himself tested positive for Covid but said 'he has a good immune system' and it didn't affect him too much. 

He said: 'It was the weirdest thing, I was coming to see my sister [in Scotland], so I knew I was going to get quarantined, so I thought I’d better get tested. 

'I got tested and a few days later they said you had it and have the anti-body. And I said “when?” I couldn’t remember for the life of me.

'I do remember way back in December when I came back for Christmas, I had a fit of sneezing for four days and the doctor said that was a symptom. 

'It just shows that this has been around for a lot longer than we might think. I’ve got a good immune system.' 

Brian said he hasn't minded being in lockdown too much.   

'I have actually enjoyed this lockdown,' he said. 'Me and my wife have thrived on it as we’ve managed to catch up on several series’. 

'I miss work as I wasn’t able to go back and have half hour in my trailer, I love my sanctuary.'
