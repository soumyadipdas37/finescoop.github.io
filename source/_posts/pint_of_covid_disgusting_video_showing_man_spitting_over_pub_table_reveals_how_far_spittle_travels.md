A video of an elderly man sitting in a pub in the UK, talking to a friend over pints has provoked 'disgust' over coronavirus fears. 

The footage captured by other pub-goers shows a visible spray of saliva coming out of the man's mouth when he talks.

The clip, believed to have been filmed in Manchester, was posted to Twitter and has since gone viral with over 2.8m views.

The other pub-goers filming the video expressed their horror at the visible spray of spittle with one saying: 'The guys giving showers!'

His friend replies: 'F***ing disgusting.'

The footage provoked more disgust with Twitter users after it was shared online on September 18, with the caption, 'THIS IS COVID'.

One person commented on the video's inadvertent advocacy for the use of facemasks.

'Everyone who ever claims that masks don’t work, needs to see this video,' they wrote.

There were also tongue-in-cheek comments made about new government Covid restrictions expected to be announced today, with one Twitter user writing: 'It’s ok, the pub shuts at 10. That’ll solve this.'

However, some people pointed out that the man could suffer from a medical condition.

One person wrote: 'It’s sad that y’all don’t know that some old people have a condition that causes them to not be able to hold in their spit and most of them don’t even know they’re spitting.'
