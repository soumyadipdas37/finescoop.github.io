A McDonald's worker who left a customer speechless when she paid for his meal has revealed how she's been buying people dinner for months in daily acts of kindness. 

In a heartwarming video posted to Twitter, Enya Vegnere, 19, from Coventry, who is paid £7.25-per-hour, could be seen using her bank card to pay for a meal Joshua Henry, 25, ordered at a drive-thru.

The student has so far spent more than £50 on random acts of kindness to customers who she thinks will appreciate it. 

'I couldn't tell you how many times I've done it,' Enya said, speaking to The Sun. 'I don't do it for rude customers - just the people who are polite to me.'

Joshua Henry was touched by Enya's generosity and said that it had made his week (pictured)

She continued: 'My motto is "takers eat better but givers sleep better." I don't do it for recognition - I just think it's nice to do nice things for people.'

'You never know what someone is going through and what a kind gesture could do.'

In the clip which was shared online by Joshua, Enya can be seen paying for his meal after he phoned his mum to check if there was anything she wanted from the fast food chain.    

Shocked at Enya's kind gesture, he exclaims: 'So you're gonna pay for my meal?' to which she replies: 'Yeah because you called your mum and asked if she wants anything from McDonald's.'

Enya (pictured) has since revealed that she treated Joshua to a hot chocolate and a couple of burgers, which came to £4 

The finance student has since told the publication that she wanted to reward Joshua's 'thoughtfulness' after choosing to ring his mum.

She added that she treated him to a hot chocolate and a couple of burgers, which came to £4.  

'He was made up and he got in touch later to say thank you,' she explained. 'He said it made his week. But it was really nothing, I didn't want any recognition or praise.'

Joshua went on to say that he has since paid forward the act of kindness when he visited Greggs and paid for the meal of the person in the queue in front of him.

He branded Enya a 'credit' to her family, adding that her generosity put a smile on his face and made his week.
