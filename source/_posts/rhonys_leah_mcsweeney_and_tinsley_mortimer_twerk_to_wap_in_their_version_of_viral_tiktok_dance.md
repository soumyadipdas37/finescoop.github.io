Tinsley Mortimer and Leah McSweeney are the best of friends.

So they weren't afraid to make things a little saucy while hanging out in Scottsdale, Arizona together this week.

McSweeney, 38, and Mortimer, 45, tried their best to recreate the viral TikTok dance inspired by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's X-rated track WAP, getting down on their hands and knees to shake it in a new video shared on Leah's social media.

The girls were dressed to match, both donning longsleeve grey crop tops with Daisy Dukes, dark baseball caps and white sneakers.

While they weren't perfectly in sync both ladies gave it their all as they dropped down, twerked, crawled and spread eagled right on the AstroTurf of the Scottsdale Four Seasons.

'WAP > BDE @tinsleymortimer,' Leah captioned the post, referring to 2018's favorite NSFW acronym about male anatomy, before adding the sassy dancing girls emoji.

Good for her: Cardi and Meg would have been proud of Leah and Tinsley

Leah revealed her daughter Kier, 12, was behind the camera in her caption, adding: 'Also I think Kiki is a future film maker' with a laughing with tears emoji.

The girls got plenty of attention with the post.

Castmate Sonja Morgan had a question, taking to the comments to wonder: 'How do you that gurl? I’m actually on the way to the chiropractor. Literally. Now and watching this.'

The ousted RHONY castmate returned to the comment section later to say: 'Teach me for Ramona’s next party.'

Last week Tinsley gave Leah a surprise birthday welcome when the fashion designer and her daughter traveled to Park City, Utah to spend time with Mortimer and fiancé Scott Kluth at their Montage Deer Valley suite. 

The reality star seemed genuinely shocked when she walked into the suite to find an array of cake, balloons, confetti and other party favors.

'Oh my god. You're f***ing kidding me right now?' McSweeney blurted out with obvious excitement in a video that was posted on her Instagram page. 

With her hands over her face, the birthday girl repeated: 'Are you kidding?' a couple more times, which garnered an abundance of laughs from Mortimer and Kluth, who likely was behind the camera.

After surveying the decorations that were set up in a living room space, the two ladies embraced in a heartfelt hug.

It turns out Mortimer also got her friend and former castmate a gorgeous personalized birthday cake and gifted her with a pink Chanel purse, said to be worth over $5,000, according to Page Six.

Moments later, Mortimer took over the camera duties and everyone sang Happy Birthday with one candle on the cake.  

'Thank you my love @tinsleymortimer and Scott [Kluth] and of course my Kiki for making my birthday extra extra special. THIRTY EIGHT DON’T HATE,' she wrote in one of her Instagram posts. 

It turns out the ladies shifted the party from Utah to Arizona. Later in the day, Mortimer took to her Instagram page and posted a photo of herself and McSweeney sitting side-by-side on a small private plane.  

'Next stop Scottsdale HAPPY HAPPY BDAY,' she wrote in the caption.

Mortimer, 45, left The Real Housewives Of New York City in November after four seasons so that she can relocate to Chicago and marry Kluth, who's the CEO of Coupon Cabin.

But it's already been announced that she will appear in the season 12 reunion next month in New York that will be hosted by Andy Cohen. 

The 52-year-old producer has said the special will be filmed in person, but he maintains there will be a lot of COVID-19 protocol in place to keep everyone safe.

McSweeney joined the cast of RHONY this past year for season 12.
