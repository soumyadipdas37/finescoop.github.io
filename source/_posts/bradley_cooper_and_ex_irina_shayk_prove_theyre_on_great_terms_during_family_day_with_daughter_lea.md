Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk proved they were quite the amicable exes while spending time with daughter Lea in New York on Thursday.

The A Star Is Born actor/director, 45, and model, 34, looked happy to pause their busy schedules to spend time together as a family.

Bradley doted on little Lea, three, carrying his girl in his arms while mom Irina walked to his side.

The Russian stunner was effortlessly sexy while wearing a large olive shirt open over a black crop top and matching bike shorts. 

She accessorized with tiny, oval sunglasses, a little eggshell-hued bag, and a peace-themed face mask which she peeled on and off throughout the trip.

Bradley looked laid back in dark hoodie and tapered track pants pushed up towards his knees. 

Cooper was rocking longer hair than normal for his latest role, seen with a bit of a ponytail popping out the back of his baseball hat.

Lea looked angelic, donning a lacy white frock while dad carried her around.

Bradley is back in NYC after spending time in Southern California shooting a yet-to-be-titled Paul Thomas Anderson film.

The former couple have been making the most of their time together, making these first public appearance together in over a year this past Tuesday.

Bradley and Irina began dating in 2015. Lea was born in 2017 but the pair called it quits in June 2019.

The couple haven't let the end of their romance or their very busy schedules interfere with their co-parenting.

'There are still challenges because he does have a very busy schedule and she’s back at work now so there are times they have to compromise, and they do,' a source told HollywoodLife in March.

'He’s been making an effort to take projects that aren’t too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he’s very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he’d carry her everywhere.' 

'He’s totally devoted to Lea, it’s really sweet to see how much he loves being a dad,' the insider went on.
