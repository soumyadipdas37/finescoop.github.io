Lydia Hearst struck a pose for a sultry poolside shoot that was shot via FaceTime while she was in quarantine — with her husband Chris Hardwick serving as the photographer's on-set assistant. 

For the spread featured in the September issue of Maxim, the 35-year-old actress showed off her figure in a variety of bodysuits and a pair of thigh-high boots, which she had no problem getting wet.

It was Lydia's first time in front of the camera amid the coronavirus pandemic, and Scott Buccheit photographed her from afar using FaceTime.

In one shot, the model can be seen sitting on the pool steps wearing a black see-through mesh leotard over a matching triangle top. Her wet hair is slicked back, and a diamond ring is sparkling on her left hand, which is held up to her face. 

Another shows her modeling an off-the-shoulder floral leotard and suede thigh-high boots while standing in the pool. Lydia also donned a long-sleeve bodysuit featuring a plunging neckline as she floated in the water.   

The Z Nation star was joined by her comedian husband Chris, 48, who assisted with the shoot, and their dog, an Otterhound named Zoltar. Behind-the-scenes photos show her cuddling the beloved pooch, and at one point, she even brought him into the water with her.

Lydia, who is the great-granddaughter of publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, has wanted to be an actress since she was a child. In her interview with Maxim, she recalled being on film sets with her famous mother, Patty Hearst. 

However, she actually got her first big break as a model after famed fashion photographer Steven Meisel shot her for the cover of Vogue Italia's April 2004 issue. 

'My life changed overnight when I did the cover and editorial for Vogue Italia,' Lydia recalled. 'In my fashion career I have had the opportunity to travel the world and work with some of the most iconic designers and photographers to date. 

'Because of my work in fashion, I developed my own unique and personal sense of style, and learned how to be comfortable in my own skin.'

Lydia eventually transitioned into acting, and in the past five years, she has appeared in eight movies, including Between Worlds with Nicolas Cage and #Horror with Natasha Lyonne and Chloe Sevigny. 

She is also co-executive producing and co-starring the vampire movie With Teeth with Malin Ackerman. They plan to film the flick this fall, depending on the pandemic.    

Lydia's latest shoot perfectly captures the feel that summer is ending and fall is right around the corner, a season that Lydia is likely looking forward to considering her love of horror.  

She found her match when she met Chris, who loves the genre as much as she does. The couple channeled their shared passion when they planned their Sci-Fi/horor-themed wedding in 2016.

'Horror movies temporarily create the emotional experience of fear without the devastating consequences — because in reality no psychotic killer, ghostly demon or chainsaw-wielding murderer is truly after you,' Lydia said. 

'It’s not just about cheap thrills and jump scares. Most great horror films rely on atmosphere and suspense rather than gore,' she noted. 

'I love a film that isn’t just scary, but that is effectively creepy. Creepy is much more difficult to pull off. 

'I also love the feeling of that adrenaline rush when you’re captivated by a great film and are engulfed by the feeling of suspense.'
