She won the heart of Richie Strahan on The Bachelor in 2016, and following their split she appeared on the second season of Bachelor in Paradise. 

But Alex Nation has revealed the shocking reason why she won't return to the Channel 10 spin-off for its upcoming fourth season. 

Commenting on an Instagram post from the Dramatic Podcast, the 28-year-old explained that her 'days in paradise' were done.

Dramatic noticed that the reality star had commented on a Facebook post by fellow Bachie alum, Chelsie McLeod, which hinted that Chelsie was set to star on Paradide. 

'OOFT!!! @alexandranation has expressed her interest to join @chelsiemcleod in Paradise!! I personally would LOVE to see this happen.. raise your hand if you’re with me,' she wrote. 

Alex was quick to dispel the rumour commenting: 'My days in paradise are [sic] DUN.'

Remember this? Alex won the heart of Richie Strahan on The Bachelor and following their split she appeared on the second season of Bachelor in Paradise (pictured) 

She went on to further explain the reason behind her decision, claiming that when she was on the show 'it was about finding love'.

'Honestly, with the way that it’s all formatted now. I couldn’t think of anything worse,' she began.

'Back in my day (because I was legit almost 5 years ago) it was about finding love over women tearing each other down and toxic masculinity.'

The reason: She went on to further explain the reason behind her decision, claiming that when she was on the show 'it was about finding love' not 'toxic masculinity'

She continued: 'Don’t get me wrong, Fiji with a few legends and a cuppla mango daiquiris would be fab but I’d prefer to stay in lockdown.' 

Alex rose to fame on the 2016 season of The Bachelor, where she won the heart of rope-access technician Richie Strahan.

They split after several months and Alex later came out as pansexual and revealed she was engaged to a woman - but this relationship didn't last either.
