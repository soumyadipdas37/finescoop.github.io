Jimmy Barnes has revealed that he underwent cosmetic surgery to change a feature he was always self-conscious about. 

The 64-year-old says he had his ears pinned back - a procedure called otoplasty - on his 40th birthday in 1994. 

The rocker told The Courier Mail on Saturday: 'I'm happier with them. Before, wearing a pair of sunglasses would look funny, putting a hat on made me look ridiculous.

'I was self-conscious about it. I got teased a lot when I was a kid,' he admitted. 

The Working Class Man singer described the procedure as a 'gift to himself' for his 40th birthday, and had the work done in France.   

Jimmy says that he never kept the procedure secret, admitting: 'Nobody asked me. A journalist did ask once if I had a face lift and I could answer 'No!''

He went on to say that his wife, Jane, and his children, preferred his old ears, but he's happier with how he looks now.   

'It made me feel more comfortable and I could cut my hair short and didn't have worry or care about photos. This has streamlined me a bit; I'm much more aerodynamic,' he said.    

Jimmy is currently back out on the road for the first time since COVID-19 restrictions came into play.

The rocker performed at Top End Breakout Tour in Darwin on September 26, where he was joined by a number of other acts for a live, eight-hour mini festival. 

Jimmy had been quarantined in the Southern Highlands in order to cross into the Northern Territory ahead of the gig. 

Jimmy told The Daily Telegraph: 'We are starting up in Darwin but we want to be playing everywhere'.
