Liverpool made it three wins out of three with a 3-1 comeback win over fellow high-flyers Arsenal.

Despite dominating the opening stages of the game, it was Mikel Arteta's Gunners who took the lead in the first-half when Alexandre Lacazette finished off a fine team move with a scuffed finish over Alisson. 

But the Reds turned the game on its head before half-time thanks to goals from Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson, before Diogo Jota sealed his first Premier League appearance for the Premier League champions with a match-sealing third late on.

Sportsmail rates each player who took to the field at Anfield...

Liverpool continued their fine start to the season with a 3-1 win over Arsenal at Anfield

LIVERPOOL (4-3-3)

Alisson Becker – What he does so well is burst into life when needed and made a couple of super interventions in the second period – 7.5

Trent Alexander-Arnold – Ran the game from right-back, an assist for Robertson, some glorious deliveries and a shot that struck the bar – 8.5

Joe Gomez – Stepped back into his position with the minimum of fuss, be good to see him get a prolonged sequence of starts now – 7

Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold (left) ran the game from right-back and laid on an assist

Virgil Van Dijk – You watch him sometimes and think he finds it all too easy; looked like he was never out of second gear – 7.5

Andrew Robertson – If you are going to make a mistake that leads to a goal, the best way to atone is with a goal of your own – 7

Gini Wijnaldum – Quietly effective, nothing out of the ordinary but kept the team ticking along as he usually does – 6.5

Fabinho – He might just be the best central defensive midfielder in Europe, cruised through the cost in imperious fashion – 8

Fabinho (left)'s performance might just prove he is one of the best midfielders in Europe

Naby Keita – Some nice moments and good use of the ball but you watch him and feel like there is so much more to come – 6.5

Mohamed Salah – No goals but was strong and he was quick and he’s started the season in blistering form – 8

Roberto Firmino – Gets said he doesn’t score enough but without him, Liverpool aren’t the same team. Arsenal didn’t know how to contain him – 7

Mohammed Salah (right) was not on the scoresheet but was still one of the best on the pitch

Sadio Mane – Perhaps fortunate to only be booked for an early elbow and that was a blot on a relentless evening when he scored again – 7

Subs: Adrian (GK), Minamino, Jones, Milner, Jota, Origi, Williams

Manager: Jurgen Klopp – You can see in his face that he still believes there is room for improvement but he had his team drilled perfectly and this was a statement of intent - 7

ARSENAL (3-4-3)

Bernd Leno – Needed to be stronger for Liverpool’s first goal, weakly palming the ball into Mane’s path – 5

Rob Holding – Much better than in the Community Shield against the same opponents, resilient and made some crucial interventions – 6.5

David Luiz – One superb moment to read a Van Dijk header and this was so much better than his nightmare here 12 months ago – 6

David Luiz (second right) was still on the losing side but was much improved at centre-back

Kieran Tierney – Left isolated by the system and received no help in his forlorn attempts to keep hold of Salah – 5

Hector Bellerin – Spent the evening working out how to keep Robertson and Mane in check but not to any great success – 5.5

Granit Xhaka – Couple of big tackles early on but spent the rest of the time being harangued and was eventually replaced – 5

Mohamed Elneny – Most industrious member of Arsenal’s midfield, worked so hard to try and repel the Red tide – 6

Mohammed Elneny (right) was one of the more industrious members in the Arsenal midfield

Ainsley Maitland-Niles – Didn’t know whether he was a wing-back or a full-back and should have worked in tandem with Tierney – 5

Willian – Frustrating night for the Brazilian, got no change out of Robertson and saw very little of the ball in an attacking sense – 5.5

Alexander Lacazette – Alert, as every good striker should be, to take advantage of a gift but wasted a chance to score a second – 6

Alex Lacazette was alert to give Arsenal the lead but should have added more later in the game

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – That Arsenal only touched the ball twice in Liverpool’s penalty area in the first 45 minutes tells how quiet he was – 5

Subs: Runarsson (GK), Saka, Gabriel, Pepe, Nketiah, Kolasinac

Manager: Mikel Arteta – Had to ditch his plan to contain Liverpool but the introduction of Ceballos for Xhaka gave Arsenal some belated impetus – 6

Referee: Craig Pawson – He will be relieved that it was a night that was free of controversy but right to ask whether he let Mane off lightly in the first half – 6
