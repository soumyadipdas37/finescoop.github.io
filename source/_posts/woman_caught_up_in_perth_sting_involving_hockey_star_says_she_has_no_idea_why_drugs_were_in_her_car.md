A glamorous nightclub worker who was allegedly found with 100 ecstasy pills in her car as part of a drug sting focused on a young Australian hockey star has denied knowing they were there - as her ex-boyfriend claimed they belonged to him.

Mackenzie Rose Brewer, 22, was being watched covertly by police officers in May 2018 when she was allegedly seen driving to the home of Matthew Bird, then 21, in Bateman in Perth's south.

Bird - a former Kookaburras player - was sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison in November of that year for selling a prohibited drug and possessing a homemade knuckleduster.

Brewer (pictured) said multiple people had access to her car, while her ex-boyfriend told a court after being given immunity the pills belonged to him

Western Australia Police allege they saw Brewer run inside and then drive-off before a team of officers uncovered the bag of pills in a compartment of her car.

The drugs are alleged to have had a value of as much as $2,500 and the young woman has been charged with possessing the drug to sell or supply, The West Australian reported.

The court was told though the pills had a purity level estimated far below the 43 per cent average of between only 10 and 11 per cent. 

Her ex-boyfriend Oliver Hill - who has already been convicted of trafficking drugs - said the pills were his at the District Court of Western Australia on Monday after being given immunity to give evidence that would incriminate him.

'They were mine - I was planning on selling them that weekend,' he said.

Hill said his own car was faulty so he used Brewer's to move drugs, while the accused 22-year-old said a lot of people were allowed to use the vehicle.

She also told police she had run into the home to get her bank card. Her DNA was not found on the bag containing the pills, the court heard.

Brewer does not have a criminal history and the court was told police did not find any incriminating text message on her phone - nor any drug paraphernalia on her person.  

Bird had made his Kookaburras debut in January 2018 against the Netherlands in his home state of WA before his arrest and guilty plea led to his resignation from Hockey Australia.

Brewer's case continues.
