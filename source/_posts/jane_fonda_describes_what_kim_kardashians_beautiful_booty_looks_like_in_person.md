Jane Fonda admitted she could not stop staring at Kim Kardashian's world-famous butt when at Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party in 2012. 

During her appearance on Thursday's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, the 82-year-old actress keenly described her encounter with the 39-year-old reality TV star.  

'I was kneeling on the floor talking to Gladys Knight,' the seven-time Golden Globe winner recalled to the Bravo host. 'And, I turned around to get up and right in my face was this shape [mimes an hourglass figure.]'

She added: 'It went in like this and out like this, and I thought that is the most amazing behind I have ever seen, and, of course, it was Kim Kardashian.' 

The longtime political activist, then, approached the KKW Beauty founder to tell her: 'I've just been staring at your behind and it's beautiful!'

Fonda said the mother-of-four was 'very sweet' and that they use 'to go to the same manicurist.'
