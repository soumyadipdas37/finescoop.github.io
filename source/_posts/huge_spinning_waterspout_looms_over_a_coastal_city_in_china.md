Two waterspouts descended on a coastal city in eastern China today, leaving the locals stunned.

Footage released by the meteorological authority of Dalian shows one of them looming over a business district in the afternoon.

The spectacle occurred at around 2pm near the East Harbour Business District, according to Dalian Meteorology Bureau.

A clip released by the authority on social media shows a giant column spinning over the Dalian Bay, which is part of the Yellow Sea.

Earlier today, another waterspout was spotted rotating in the city's Jinpu New District at around 11am, a post accompanying the video said.

Meteorologists said that the majority of the city had showers and thunderstorms today, which created 'favourable conditions' for waterspouts.

The rare natural phenomenon is known as 'dragon sucking water' in Mandarin.

Waterspouts typically occur when the air temperature in the sky suddenly drops to a much lower point than the air temperature near the water surface.

According to the National Ocean Service of the United States of America, waterspouts fall into two categories: the tornadic ones and the fair-weather ones.

Tornadic waterspouts are usually accompanied by high winds and seas, large hail, and frequent dangerous lightning. They develop downwards from thunderstorms.

On the other hand, fair-weather waterspouts form along the dark flat base of a line of developing cumulus clouds. They develop on the surface of waters and work their way upwards.

As fair-weather waterspouts form in light wind conditions, they usually move very little.
