Eoin Morgan suffered a gruesome finger injury during England's T20 clash against Australia - but miraculously recovered quickly to carry on playing at the Ageas Bowl. 

The England one-day captain tried to stop Marcus Stoinis' drive through the covers in the ninth over of the match when the ball hit the top of his finger causing it to point in a different direction to the rest of his hand. 

Morgan was in visible pain as he was being treated by medics and was taken off for treatment but he heroically returned for the start of the tenth over meaning he only missed three balls.

Fans on social media grimaced as footage of the England captain's wounded finger was shown on live television. 

Though many supporters were keen to recognise Morgan's heroics in returning to the field so quickly. 

One fan described him as 'IRONFINGER', while another tweeted: 'Eoin Morgan has just dislocated his finger and is still fielding. That's my captain.'

Cricket fans praised Morgan for his bravery in carrying on in the field after the injury 

Another fan said: 'Eoin Morgan back on the field after heading off with a dislocated finger. He's made of strong stuff though, he missed 3 balls. #ENGvAUS'

At that point in the match, England had started well and were 53-3 after a flurry of early wickets. 

Morgan was responsible for one of them with an impressive run-out to get Steve Smith out in the fifth over.

David Warner had been sent packing for a duck while Mark Wood got Alex Carey out shortly afterwards.

Australia were trying to level the series after a stunning collapse gave England victory on Friday night in Southampton. 

The visitors' collapse of six for 50 in eight overs meant Morgan's side won the opening match in the final over.
