An honorable judge finds himself on the wrong side of the law after his son gets into a deadly accident in the first trailer for Your Honor.

Bryan Cranston stars as highly-respected New Orleans judge Michael Desiato, whose life is turned upside down when his teenage son Adam (Hunter Doohan) is involved in a deadly hit-and-run accident. 

As Desiato vows to help his son and cover up the crime, they learn the victim was the son of a ruthless mob leader (Michael Stuhlbarg), who will stop at nothing to find those responsible for his son's death.

The trailer begins with Adam, dazed and bleeding, holding a phone in the middle of the street, dialing 911, as the rotating camera reveals the crashed Volvo station wagon in the background.

When the dispatcher answers, '911, what's your emergency?' Adam doesn't respond, clearly distraught.

Adam is then seen back at home, literally washing the blood off of his hands, choking back tears, as he's heard telling his father, 'Dad, I hit somebody, and I left him. I left him there.'
