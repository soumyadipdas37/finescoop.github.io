Edouard Mendy has reportedly said his goodbyes to his Rennes team-mates ahead of his imminent move to Chelsea.

The 28-year-old has been pursued by the Blues as manager Frank Lampard wants a new goalkeeper to usurp much-maligned Kepa Arrizabalaga as his No 1.

And L'Equipe claim the player has informed the Rennes squad that the deal is set to be completed.

Talks with Mendy's club Rennes have been ongoing but according to his agent Djily Dieng a significant breakthrough has happened over the past few days.

'The deal with Chelsea is almost done. Only the formalisation is remaining,' he told Extra Time on Thursday afternoon as per Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano. 

'It could be completed even in the next hours'.

Mendy is set to become the seventh signing in an extraordinary summer of spending for Chelsea after Sportsmail revealed at the weekend they had agreed a £25million fee with the Ligue 1 side.

Mendy was initially pulled out of training on Friday after Chelsea's bid was accepted and was subsequently left out of Rennes' 4-2 victory against Nimes on Sunday.

Chelsea conceded 54 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and manager Frank Lampard wants Mendy to help eradicate such a poor record.

His arrival would take Chelsea's outlay this summer beyond £250m following the purchases of Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr, Thiago Silva  and Kai Havertz.
