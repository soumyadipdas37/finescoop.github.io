Cate Blanchett is currently in Italy for the 77th Venice Film Festival.

And on Friday, the Australian actor looked incredible in a black and white ensemble for the premiere screening of her mini-series Mrs. America.

The 51-year-old was impeccably stylish in a white wide-legged jumpsuit by Stella McCartney that featured a black floral print.

Her accessories were kept to a minimum with a statement gemstone ring and a gold chain bracelet. 

For makeup, the Thor star kept things to a minimum to emphasise her radiant and youthful visage.

She had on a hint of blush on her cheeks that matched her light pink pout, and mascara on her lashes, while her blonde locks were styled in a part to the left.

Cate took to the stage to discuss her miniseries Mrs. America, which is based the Equal Rights Amendment movement in the US in the 1970s.

The Academy Awards-winning actor stars as conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly alongside fellow Aussie Rose Byrne as feminist journalist Gloria Steinem.

She shared the stage with Italian actor Alberto Barbera at Campari Boat Cinema.

Cate heads the jury at Venice during an historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight. 

She recently revealed she prefers to be referred to as an actor than an actress, as she often found the latter term to be used in a 'pejorative sense'.

Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor.

'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.'
