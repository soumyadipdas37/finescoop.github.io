Nike is designing workout wear for moms-to-be.

The sporting giant announced the launch of their first dedicated maternity collection dubbed Nike (M) on their blog this week. 

To create the four-piece collection of essentials, designers combed through pregnancy findings and gathered their own data.

Notes: 'The more we listened to expecting mothers and postpartum mothers, the more we learned, reworked and innovated through inclusive design,' shared Carmen Zolman, Nike Senior Design Director for Apparel Innovation

Nike (M) 'supports women during all stages of pregnancy and beyond,' the brand said.

'There are so many reasons that make sticking to sport difficult through pregnancy and motherhood, but we see this chapter as anything but a stopgap in a woman's journey through sport,' said Carmen Zolman, Nike Senior Design Director for Apparel Innovation.

'The more we listened to expecting mothers and postpartum mothers, the more we learned, reworked and innovated through inclusive design.' 

Tried and tested, nearly 30 female athletes who were pregnant or postpartum gave designers detailed feedback on fit, feel and function.

The Nike (M) Collection consist of four workout essentials: a pullover, bra, tank and leggings, with items priced up to $85.

The line launches on the brand's website on September 17th.

Size matters: 'I loved how soft the Nike One (M) tights were and the fact that if you were a size medium before, you could be a size medium in the Nike (M) line,' said golder Michelle Wie West (pictured)

Several professional Nike athlete mothers shared their feedback.  

'I loved how soft the Nike One (M) tights were and the fact that if you were a size medium before, you could be a size medium in the Nike (M) line,' said golder Michelle Wie West.  

Retired British track and field athlete Perri Edwards added, 'The Nike (M) sports bra is great because it’ll give me easy access for when I want to breastfeed.'

'The leggings give you options of wearing over your tummy or showing your tummy, and the maternity shirt has this extra material for the extra weight that I’m carrying. 

'You look very smart, very comfortable, very hip,' Perri said. 

As the largest supplier of athletic footwear in the world, the US based sports and fitness company has their finger forever on the global pulse.  

In 2017 they added athletic hijabs to their offerings for female athletes. In February, their fall/winter 2020 New York fashion show featured models of all shapes, sizes and ethnicities including Olympians, LGBTQ activists and kids.
