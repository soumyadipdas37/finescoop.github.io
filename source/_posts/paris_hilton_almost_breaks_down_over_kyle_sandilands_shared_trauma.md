Paris Hilton almost broke down while learning about Australian shock jock Kyle Sandilands' troubled childhood during an interview for her new documentary this week.

The 39-year-old was being interview on KIIS FM's The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Tuesday, when the pair both shared their childhood trauma. 

'My heart crushed for you,' Kyle, who is known for his larger-than-life persona, told the heiress turned reality star turned entrepreneurial powerhouse. 

Tough: Paris Hilton, 39, (L) almost broke down as she listened to shock jock Kyle Sandilands (R) discuss his troubled childhood during interview for new documentary on KIIS FM on Tuesday

'I understand, I had a sh*t childhood as well. Homeless, parents didn't want me, threw me out, sh*t like that,' Kyle continued. 

'Hearing your story from your childhood, very different upbringing from me, but to realise the loneliness, the sadness, how you created a shell. 

'I couldn't be more impressed...I felt such a connection. I wanted to reach into the TV screen and give you a little squeeze. I thought it was amazing.' 

Paris could then be heard with a shaking voice telling Kyle and co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson how she was becoming emotional: 'You're going to make me cry, thank you,' she sobbed.     

In Hilton's movie, the Simple Life star shares that at age 16 while living in New York two men took her out of her bedroom in the middle of the night to transport her to a boarding school for troubled teens. 

Sympathy: 'I understand, I had a sh*t childhood as well. Homeless, parents didn't want me, threw me out, sh*t like that,' Kyle continued during the interview with Paris

The fragrance mogul said she was beaten, drugged and placed in solitary confinement without a blanket or food. 

Paris and Kyle then bonded over not being happy as she spoke of how money and fame could not buy happiness. 

'I was not happy for so many years. But now, I am so happy. I am so in love. I am in the most incredible relationship. The whole world now knows the truth about me. 

Compassionate: Paris could then be heard with a shaking voice telling the Kyle and offsider Jackie 'O' Henderson: 'You're going to make me cry thank you'

'I no longer have to hide behind this shell or this character. I can finally be myself. '

Paris admitted she was nervous about 'putting herself out there' in the film. 

The movie was shot over a year and a half. It was meant to be about her life as a businesswoman but it was instead about her deepest secrets. 

Paris said she was no longer scared of having to 'grow up' and is now excited about the next phase of her life.  

Finding happiness: 'I was not happy for so many years. But now, I am so happy. I am so in love. I am in the most incredible relationship. The whole world now knows the truth about me

Speaking of her younger years, and her Paris Hilton persona, the heiress said: 'I'm not a dumb blonde, I'm just very good at pretending to be one.' 

'Success has always been something that has driven me.' she continued: 'I think growing up in my family has always been a lot to live up to.' 

Paris said her trauma at the schools she went to inspired her to become successful, so nobody could control her or tell her what to do.    

In addition to her tell all, the film has also generated buzz because Paris drops much of her recognisable baby voice, unveiling a smoother, deeper voice that she claims is how she really talks.  

Stars in her eyes: 'Success has always been something that has driven me.' she continued: 'I think growing up in my family has always been a lot of live up to.'
