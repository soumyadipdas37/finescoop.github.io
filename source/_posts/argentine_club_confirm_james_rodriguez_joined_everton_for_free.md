Everton paid no transfer fee for James Rodriguez, Argentine club Banfield have confirmed.

The Merseyside outfit pulled off the shock signing of the Real Madrid forward this summer, signing a two-year deal at Goodison Park. 

It had been thought that Everton had paid as much as £20million to land the Colombia international, but it has now been claimed this is not the case.

According to Marca, a statement made by Banfield insisted that there was no fee involved.

Banfield, who sold Rodriguez to Porto in 2010, were due a small percentage of the sell-on fee and chased up the details of the deal to find out what they would be entitled to. 

However, the club treasurer Ignacio Urquiza said: 'Unfortunately for the pass of James Rodríguez from Real Madrid to Everton Banfield does not correspond to money. 

'The transaction was made without cost, as if it were a free player. The pertinent consultations have already been made to the two clubs involved and to the corresponding organisations. 

'In all cases they confirmed to us that the club will not receive money as a solidarity mechanism.'
