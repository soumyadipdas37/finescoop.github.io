The rumored full title of Sacha Baron Cohen's sequel to his wildly successful 2006 comedy Borat hints at a connection to Vice President Mike Pence.

The sequel is reportedly entitled Borat: Gift of Pornographic Monkey to Vice Premiere Mikhael Pence to Make Benefit Recently Diminished Nation of Kazakhstan, according to a now-deleted listing at the Writers Guild of America website (via The Film Stage).

While the title has yet to be confirmed with any official marketing materials, it does fall in line with the full title of the original film: Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.

If the title is legit, it could hint that Pence could at least tangentially figure into the plot, even if he doesn't appear in the film himself.

The title also insinuates that Pence has ties to Russia, calling him 'Mikhael Pence' instead of Mike Pence, and giving him the Russian title of Vice Premiere instead of Vice President.

Still, it remains unclear why a 'pornographic monkey' would be given as a gift to Pence, and how that would 'make benefit' Kazakhstan, or how the country has been 'recently diminished.'

The original 2006 film featured Cohen playing his Borat character, which he first debuted on his hit TV series Da Ali G Show.

Borat was a TV reporter from Kazakhstand, who was sent to America with his producer Azamat (Ken Davitan).

While Borat is sent to report on the American way of life, he quickly becomes obsessed with the old TV series Baywatch, as he begins a quest to find and marry star Pamela Anderson.

There were first hints that a sequel was happening in August, when Cohen was spotted in his iconic Borat suit driving in an old pickup truck.

Then it was reported in September by Collider that the Borat sequel has already been filmed, and even screened for unspecified industry types.

There is still no word on if there is a film studio behind the project yet, or who paid for the sequel's production budget.

The now-deleted Writer's Guild of America post also revealed that several different writers worked on the Borat sequel script.

The screenplay is credited to Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Dan Swimer, Peter Baynham, Erica Rivinoja, Dan Mazer, Jena Friedman, and Lee Kern with story by Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Dan Swimer, and Nina Pedrad.

Hines, Baynham and Mazer all got screenplay credit on the original Borat movie, with Cohen, Baynham, Hines and Todd Phillips getting story credit.

Swimer, Kern and Hines have worked with Cohen on his hit Showtime series This Is America, while Rivinoja wrote for South Park and worked on movies such as Girls Trip, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Trolls.

Friedman had written for Late Night with David Letterman and The Conners, while also acting in films like Palm Springs, while Nina Pedrad has written on 30 Rock, New Girl and Will & Grace.  

Larry Charles directed the first Borat movie, though it isn't clear if he directs the sequel, or when it may be released.
