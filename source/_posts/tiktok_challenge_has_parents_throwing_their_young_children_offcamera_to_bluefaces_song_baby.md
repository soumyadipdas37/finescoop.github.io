A new TikTok challenge has parents and older siblings picking up their babies and toddlers and literally throwing them off-camera.

The challenge has social media users dancing and lip-syncing to the song Baby by Blueface, in which the artist raps: 'No baby, we can't have the baby. If you don't take this Plan B, b****, it's plan C.'

And at that charming lyric, mothers and fathers are playfully tossing their children away, with viewers left to hope they've made a soft landing on a mattress nearby.

Bye! They dance and lip-sync to a song while holding the child, then throw them

Everyone's doing it: Both moms and dads are taking part in the questionable challenge

The lyrics: It's done to song the Baby by Blueface, in which the artist raps: 'No baby, we can't have the baby. If you don't take this Plan B, b****, it's plan C'

See ya! Some of the parents are a bit gentler than others, with a few merely making the throwing motion but clearly placing the baby on a soft surface off-camera

Some of the parents are a bit gentler than others, with a few merely making the throwing motion but clearly placing the baby on a soft surface off-camera.

Others wholly chuck their children in a fluid motion, cradling them before sending them airborne beyond the camera's view.

One little girl, in particular, got quite a lot of air as her dad tossed her upward and outward.

Alarmingly, several of the parents don't even seen to look at where they've thrown their children to ensure they've landed safely, and instead simply continue to dance while facing the camera.

In one clip, a young boy is doing the dancing, tossing a baby that appears to be his little sibling.

Spreading it: The musical artist himself has even promoted the challenge on social media, sharing several of the videos on his Instagram page

'I'd be disappointed if my mom threw me then proceeded to shake a** for the internet,' wrote one commenter

The musical artist himself has even promoted the challenge on social media, sharing several of the videos on his Instagram page.

'Grab da nearest baby,' he wrote, captioning one set of clips.

But while the videos seem to be earning attention, they're hardly getting positive feedback.

'I'd be disappointed if my mom threw me then proceeded to shake a** for the internet,' wrote one. 

'Umm I don’t like this trend lmfaooo,' wrote another, while a third said: 'Imagine tossing your infant child for a blue face tiktok challenge.'

'Someone should legit call child services on these people,' said yet another. 

'I dunno bro... maybe I'm being overly pessimistic but I can't imagine how something like this doesn't go left, like s*** be funny til it's not funny, you know what I mean?' wrote one more.

Why though? Mother-of-two Mikayla Matthews went viral for another TikTok challenge in which she spilled water on her baby

'Poor baby the water is probably cold!' wrote one commenter, while another added: 'I feel like the water went in her eye the second time so it probably hurt more' 

Mother-of-two Marlena Docter tried the prank on her two boys, with the younger one bursting into tears and the toddler exclaiming: 'I don't like wet clothes'

 

Commenting on the video, one person wrote: 'Poor little boy,' to which Marlena replied: 'I did feel bad but he was fine!'

Wet: American hairstylist ReAnna tried the trend on her daughter Rainey, who seemed less than impressed by the prank

Another one: TikTok user Summer Pohl tried the prank on her baby, who appeared to see the funny side of it 

This is hardly the first TikTok challenge that has had parents pulling questionable behavior with their young children. 

Earlier this year, parents were making videos along to the song 'Ah Eh - Always a Queen,' wherein they spilled water on their unsuspecting and surprised babies.  

Utah mother-of-two Mikayla Matthews, 20, filmed herself splashing her baby, who immediately burst into tears.

Her video racked up over a million views and mixed comments from followers. 

'Poor baby the water is probably cold!' wrote one commenter, while another added: 'I feel like the water went in her eye the second time so it probably hurt more.'

Meanwhile, mother-of-two Marlena Docter tried the prank on her two boys, with the younger one bursting into tears and the toddler exclaiming: 'I don't like wet clothes'.

'This trend seems mean and cruel,' wrote one commenter. 

'I don't like this trend at all, all the kids get really upset over it. Not funny,' wrote another.
