This is the tear-jerking moment a cancer-surviving bride collapsed into her husband's arms after suffering a fit on her big day. 

Hayley Hale had put off marrying fiance Matthew, 37, for almost a decade because she was so embarrassed about her severe daily fits - and she even pretended that marriage 'wasn't a big deal' despite wanting nothing more than to be his wife.

The mother-of-two, of Rhymney Valley, Wales, suffers from non-epileptic attack disorder, which causes her brain to randomly blackout and a loss of control of her limbs. 

But Hayley finally found the courage to walk down the aisle in front of 75 guests after battling breast cancer for two years.

Yet when she reached the end of the aisle in Caerphilly, Wales, she suddenly blacked out before Matthew reacted quickly to stop his bride falling to the floor. Two minutes later, she opened her eyes and was lifted back to her feet by the groom.

She said: 'I remember waking up to Matthew holding me in his arms at the altar and I shouted to everyone in the room to say I was fine and I'm back in the room. Everyone laughed.

'Yes I fitted but I also married my husband and the love of my life. It took 75 people to see me fit on the aisle but I got to have a wedding we deserved.'

The drama unfolded after former cleaner Hayley, who has two children Milly, 18 and Charlie, 11, beat cancer. She was diagnosed in October 2016 after finding a lump in her breast.

Hayley underwent a lumpectomy, mastectomy on her right breast, chemotherapy, a hysterectomy followed by another mastectomy on her left breast over a two-year period.

She was also suffering dozens of seizures a day which are so aggressive and unexpected she has broken her right elbow, fingers, toes, and right ankle several times.

But despite the setbacks, she went on to have her dream wedding day.

'Walking up the aisle without fitting was my dream and I did it,' Hayley said. 'I'd fitted 10 times that morning getting ready. It was ridiculous.

'I just didn't want it happening as I made my way up the aisle and would be sprawled out in my wedding dress with my hair and legs everywhere, all over the floor.

'I walked to Etta James' At Last because I'd finally found the courage to do this and I was at last cancer free. Mum and Dad walked me up the aisle, and Dad was waving and skipping to distract me as I have fits when I'm anxious.

'I reached Matthew and I was so relieved that I'd done it. All the guests were crying. I looked at Matthew and was so happy that my belly began to feel warm and my head felt fuzzy and then I was gone.'

Hayley has decided to speak out and share the stunning photograph for the first time after her emotional wedding day on August 17, 2018.

It is currently believed that non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) (also known as non-epileptic seizure disorder, NES) is the brain’s response to overwhelming stress but there may be other causes.

NEAD can be divided into two types: organic non-epileptic seizures (physical) and psychogenic seizures (emotional).

Organic seizures have a physical cause, such as diabetes. Because organic NES have a physical cause, they may be relatively easy to diagnose and treated when the underlying cause is found.   

Psychogenic NES seizures are caused by mental or emotional issues. They may happen when someone's reaction to painful or difficult thoughts and feelings affects them physically.

Psychogenic seizures include different types, but the most common type of NES is dissociative seizures. These happen unconsciously, which means that the person has no control over them.

NES can be difficult to diagnose because they can appear similar to epileptic seizures.  There are no symptoms that will definitely identify NES from epileptic seizures.   

Psychotherapy is the recommended treatment for NES, and people can recover or reduce their seizures. 

For some people, NES may disrupt their daily life or they may want to avoid activities in case they have a seizure. However, becoming isolated and anxious can may make seizures more likely.

Her life changed in May 2008 after suffering her third ectopic pregnancy. Matthew found her collapsed behind the wheel of her car and rushed her to hospital where doctors said she was 10 minutes from death.

Hayley survived after having her right Fallopian tube removed but she was diagnosed with PTSD and non-epileptic attack disorder.

The couple went on to have their first child together, Charlie, one year later and Matthew eventually quit his factory job to become Hayley's carer because her fits were so aggressive she wasn't allowed to be alone with her children.

It was as she was recovering from her hysterectomy in August 2017 that she decided to marry Matthew who first asked her to be his wife nine years earlier.

The pair tied the knot at Ystrad Fawr Registry Office one year later after Hayley was declared cancer free.

She said: 'I no longer wanted the fits to get in the way of my happiness and our future. I wanted to show our kids that nothing stops me and they were so proud.

'Walking up that aisle was a huge obstacle for me and I did it - it was the best day of my life. I got to marry the man of my dreams.'
