Studies have shown that patients with Type 1 or type 2 diabetes face up to three times the risk of dying if they catch Covid-19. 

Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high. You may need to change your diet, take medicines and have regular check-ups. 

Talking to the magazine, she said: 'I do feel at risk. I'm very strict about quarantining and who is in my bubble.  

'We have a whole section of the house: When you go out in the world and buy something, it has to sit in this purgatory.'

During the candid interview, Halle also revealed that she thought she had bone cancer after breaking three ribs while filming John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum in 2019.

The star explained that she didn't experience any pain and was suddenly left unable to breathe on set.

Halle said: 'I thought I had bone cancer. I thought it was early osteoporosis. I couldn't understand why this was happening to me when I was really physically fit.'

The star added that she has linked the accident to her diabetes, she explained: 'I have a propensity to fracture bones faster than other people.' 

At risk: Halle admitted that she feels 'at risk' from Covid-19 due to having diabetes, she was diagnosed with Type 2 after falling dramatically ill on the set of US series Living Dolls in 1989

Speaking out: Talking to the magazine, she said: 'I do feel at risk. I'm very strict about quarantining and who is in my bubble.' 

For her interview, Halle looked sensational as she wowed in a stunning photoshoot for the publication.

The actress displayed her age-defying figure in a collection of stylish ensembles which included a sparkly zebra print mini dress with a leather corset.

While a different look saw Halle go braless in a daring and plunging gold metallic jumpsuit.

Elsewhere during the interview, the star branded her historic Oscar win as 'one of my biggest heartbreaks' as she remains the only black actress to score the top accolade. 

Scary: During the candid interview, Halle also revealed that she thought she had bone cancer after breaking three ribs while filming John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum in 2019 but linked it down to her diabetes 

She also spoke about her 'angry fights' with troubled director Bryan Singer on X-Men.   

Halle  was diagnosed with diabetes after she fell dramatically ill while on the set of US series Living Dolls back in 1989.

After passing out one day, she woke up in hospital to discover she had been in a coma for a week with doctors saying her condition had passed beyond the stage where a diet change or new exercise regime would stop it progressing.

She told the Daily Mail in 2005: 'Diabetes caught me completely off guard. None of my family had suffered from the illness and although I was slightly overweight in school, I thought I was pretty healthy. 

Worrying: The star explained that she didn't experience any pain and was suddenly left unable to breathe on set

'I fell ill - dramatically - when I was on the TV show, Living Dolls, in 1989. I felt I needed energy but I didn't even have a minute to pop out and get a chocolate bar. I didn't really know what was wrong. 

'I thought I could tough it out, but I couldn't have been more wrong. One day, I simply passed out, and I didn't wake up for seven days, which is obviously very serious.'

She added: 'They told me I might lose my eyesight, or I could lose my legs. I was scared to death, I thought I was going to die.' 

Halle has credited the Keto diet for helping her manage her diabetes and is believed to test her her blood sugar levels with a pinprick a couple of times a day.

In 2018, the star claimed she had 'reversed' her diabetes with a healthy Keto lifestyle. It follows a low-carbohydrate, high-fat plan, and is quite similar to the Atkins diet.

She wrote: 'The keto lifestyle offers so many benefits such as weight loss, (moms that's how we get rid of our baby bellies), appetite control, more energy and better mental performance. 

'If you're like me, you can possibly reverse type 2 diabetes, you'll experience better physical endurance, better skin and also less acne if that's an issue.'

Making history: Elsewhere during the interview, the star branded her historic Oscar win as 'one of my biggest heartbreaks' as she remains the only black actress to score the top accolade (pictured in 2002) 

Earlier this year, Halle also spoke to Women's Health about her Keto diet, she said: 'After being diagnosed with diabetes at 22, I adopted what I now know was basically a keto diet. 

'My doctors told me I'd have to keep an eye on how I ate to stay healthy, and I took it to heart. I wanted to get off of insulin, so I decided to say goodbye to processed carbs and sugar like baked goods and white bread—and it has seriously paid off.

'For more than 15 years, eating this way has helped me manage my diabetes—but it's also given me a ton of energy and helped me maintain my weight and stay in shape.'

Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high.

It can cause symptoms like excessive thirst, needing to pee a lot and tiredness. It can also increase your risk of getting serious problems with your eyes, heart and nerves.

It's a lifelong condition that can affect your everyday life. You may need to change your diet, take medicines and have regular check-ups.

It's caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin. It's often linked to being overweight or inactive, or having a family history of type 2 diabetes.  

Type 2 diabetes can cause health problems such as heart disease and stroke, loss of feeling and pain (nerve damage) – causing problems with sex, foot problems – like sores and infection, vision loss and blindness, miscarriage and stillbirth as well as problems with your kidneys

 A healthy diet and keeping active will help you manage your blood sugar level. It will also help you to control your weight and generally feel better
