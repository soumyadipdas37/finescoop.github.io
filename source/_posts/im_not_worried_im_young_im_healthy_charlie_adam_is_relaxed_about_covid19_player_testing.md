Charlie Adam insists he is not concerned about playing football alongside players who have not been tested for coronavirus. 

The Dundee midfielder, formerly of Liverpool, Stoke and Blackpool, added that he is completely relaxed about the prospect of contracting COVID-19, boldly stating: 'I'm not worried. I'm young, I'm healthy.'  

The 34-year-old's comments, amid a discussion on coronavirus player testing on BBC Sportsound, comes with players in the Scottish Premiership being regularly tested, but players in the Scottish Championship or below not routinely tested. 

Charlie Adam says he is not concerned about picking up the virus, insisting he will 'deal with it'

'Everybody knew the R rate was going to go higher because everybody kept coming out the house,' Adam, who plays for Dundee in the second-tier of Scottish football, began. 

'There's got to be a point where we've got to move on and... I understand it's getting higher. It will get higher because there's so many people out now.

'But if we're going to shut down football, let's just shut down pubs, restaurants - everything again and the economy will go bust.'

Scottish Premiership teams are in a testing bubble with two checks each week, but this does not apply to the Scottish Championship, League One or League Two. 

However, when questioned about whether he feels comfortable playing amongst players not regularly tested, Adam was unequivocal. 

'No. I'm fine. I'm happy. I'm playing. That doesn't bother me,' Adam stated.

The 34-year-old revealed coronavirus does not come into his mind when playing football 

'Covid does not come into my mind. It's all about playing football. Because that's my job, that's the excitement, that's the buzz I get from it.

'And do you know? If I pick the virus up, then ok, - I'll deal with that.

'I'll have to isolate and things like that... but I'm not worried. I'm young, I'm healthy, that's how I feel. Everybody might be different...'
