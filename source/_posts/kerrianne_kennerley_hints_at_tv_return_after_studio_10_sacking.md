Kerri-Anne Kennerley has revealed how she really feels about being made redundant from Studio 10 last month.

Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, the 66-year-old TV icon was nonchalant about her sacking - and hinted at a return to television. 

'Mate, it is what it is, it's the nature of television. I've seen and been through it all before,' she told the paper. 

She's back! Kerri-Anne Kennerley (pictured) has revealed how she really feels about being made redundant from Studio 10. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, the 66-year-old TV icon was nonchalant about her sacking - and hinted at a return to TV

The morning television veteran then added tellingly: 'and I'll be around to see it happen all again.' 

The star fought back tears as she bid farewell to viewers on August 12, less than 24 hours after being sacked from the network as a cost-cutting measure.

Kerri-Anne, who was axed from Channel 10 along with 25 other staff members, appeared to shake with emotion while addressing her departure. 

All okay? 'Mate, it is what it is, it's the nature of television. I've seen and been through it all before,' she told the paper

She acknowledged that the coronavirus pandemic had made it necessary to tighten the budget, and thanked her friends and colleagues for their support.

'I just know I'm back on the 'lazy Susan' of television. Yeah, it's very, very tough for a lot of people,' she began.

'But I've always worked on a personal level, the Charles Darwin theory that says to survive you don't need to be the most intelligent, you don't have to be the strongest, but you have to be, to survive, the most adaptable,' she said.

Kerri-Anne, who joined Studio 10 as a part-time panellist in September 2018, went on to say just how much she treasures the friendships she's made along the way.

'I've had a ball! And the reason why I've got this outfit today is because, if you're being run out of town, get in front of the parade or get in front of the crowd and make it look like a parade!' she added with a salute. 

She will depart the network in September, but remains under contract at Channel 10 on 'gardening leave' until the end of the year.
