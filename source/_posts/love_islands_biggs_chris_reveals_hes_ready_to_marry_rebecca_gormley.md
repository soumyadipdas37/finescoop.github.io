They met after they starred on Love Island together last year - and now Biggs Chris is ready to make things official with girlfriend Rebecca Gormley. 

Talking to MailOnline, Biggs said he's more than happy to walk down the aisle with the brunette beauty, but he wants HER to do all the running around.   

Biggs, 27, said: 'I’m waiting for Rebecca to ask me to marry her. I’m waiting for the ring, she got down on one knee yesterday as a joke.'

She replied: 'You’ll be waiting for a long time cause I’m not getting down on one knee.' 

Car repair specialist Biggs, initially had his eye on twin Jess Gale when he entered Casa Amor in Love Island, but hooked up with Rebecca after leaving the hit show. 

He and Rebecca, 21, visited Glasgow’s The Dhabba restaurant for a double date with his parents on Sunday night.

They enjoyed lamb cutlets, chicken curry and wine with Chris’s family in a corner of the restaurant tucked away. 

The couple told MailOnline they enjoyed spending their isolation together and it seems it's helped their relationship go from strength to strength.  

She added: 'I’m enjoying Scotland. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and the people are so nice.   

'Obviously with lockdown we haven’t really been going out, just staying in. We came here tonight and we’ve been staying at a lodge in the Lochside hotel which was phenomenal. 

Casual: Rebecca posted a picture of her look from inside the restaurant on Instagram on Monday morning 

'The scenery was so green and there were so many cows.'

The couple were even given a Bentley to drive around in while they were in Scotland. 

Rebecca said: 'It’s been nice. We've been spending time here and then going back to Newcastle to spend time with my mam and my brother. 

'We’re splitting it between the two houses. I’ve been trying lots of Scottish food.'

Later on the couple took to Instagram but as Biggs cosied up to Rebecca in bed he said she stunk of onions. 

Rebecca concluded: 'Our meal was so nice at the indian but I literally ate a full bowl of onions.'
