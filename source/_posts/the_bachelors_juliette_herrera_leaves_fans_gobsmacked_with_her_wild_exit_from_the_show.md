Outspoken Bachelor star Juliette Herrera made a wild exit from the show on Wednesday. 

The 34-year-old stylist left fans completely gobsmacked when she went on a tirade to Locky Gilbert about ignoring messages in her 'DMs' for him, before being sent home.

Fans couldn't believe what they were watching, with some flocking to Twitter to talk about the drama.

'I'm screaming Juliette just left... What a queen,' one viewer hilariously wrote. 

'Juliette has surprisingly become the MVP,' another added. 

One fan joked: 'Juliette for the Bachelorette 2021.'

Another cheekily added: 'Juliette went home go back to ur DMs girl I'm rootin for u (sic).'

Just before being sent home, Juliette confronted Locky Gilbert about not having a single date with him. 

She then went on a cringeworthy rant about ignoring direct messages on Instagram for him. 

'I messaged you and tried to reach out to you,' Juliette said. 

'I thought, ''does he know that in my DMs I'm not replying to, like, certain people from LA? I could be talking to TikTok stars and rappers. But I'm ignoring them for you." Like, Young Thug's producer. And The Chainsmokers.'  

'I have to remember who I am!' Just before being sent home, Juliette confronted Locky Gilbert about not having a single date with him. She then went on a cringeworthy rant about ignoring direct messages on Instagram for him

'I … I don't know who that is,' Locky said. 

'Harvey Luna – with four million TikTok followers – follows me and talks to me!' she said.  

Juliette defiantly added: 'I have to remember who I am. Hello! I'm amazing!'

'And if that's too confronting for Locky, then just get rid of me. Because I have DMs to go back to.'

Soon after, Juliette is seen getting driven home from the mansion.   

'I think it was the right thing to send Juliette home. I mean, I don't think she's the right person for me,' Locky said. 

Shocked: 'I think it was the right thing to send Juliette home. I mean, I don't think she's the right person for me,' Locky said

During Wednesday's episode, Juliette wasn't the only one sent packing from the mansion. 

Teachers Maddy Carver and Steph Harper were booted from the show, after they both failed to score a rose from the handsome adventure seeker.  

Elsewhere, Locky intercepted Bella Varelis to question her about her intentions after she accused Irena Srbinovska of 'manipulating her way through the show'.

While it didn't look promising for the petite brunette, Locky eventually handed his final rose to Bella. 

The remaining women competing for Locky's love include Bella Varelis, Irena Srbinovska, Izzy Sharman-Firth, Kaitlyn Hoppe and intruder Bec Cvilikas.

In a preview for Thursday's episode, Irena appears to breaks down in tears as she reveals she 'can't listen' to former friend Bella anymore.
