She has been enjoying time with her boyfriend Kyle Kuzma.  

And Winnie Harlow put on a loved-up display with her basketball beau as she posed on his lap and flaunted her signature raven locks on Monday.  

The model, 26, looked every inch the doting girlfriend in a matching Hills jersey and wrapped her arms around her other-half in the Instagram post captioned: 'Twin.'

The former America's Next Top Model contestant looked radiant as she posed with the LA Lakers basketball player in a hotel lobby. 

Winnie opted for a laid-back look in grey tracksuit bottoms and a jersey with red Hills lettering to complement her beau who donned the blue alternative. 

The beauty highlighted her eyes with bronze eyeshadow and swept mascara over her fluttery eyelashes.

Finishing her look, Winnie accessorised with oversized gold hoop earrings and carried her evening essentials in a red crossbody bag. 

Meanwhile Kyle, 25, showcased his tattooed arm in a grey jersey with blue writing as he held his model girlfriend.

Earlier this month the couple enjoyed a relaxing and fun day of leisure on the golf course due to his Lakers team having a day off. 

Winnie posed for several shots holding her golf club over her shoulder, as she competed with her NBA star beau. 

The couple's date did not violate the NBA's rule that all players remain in the bubbled environment in an effort to stave off the still raging COVID-19 pandemic.

The pair, who have been dating since May, had been separated since the NBA restarted its 2020 season in Disney World.
