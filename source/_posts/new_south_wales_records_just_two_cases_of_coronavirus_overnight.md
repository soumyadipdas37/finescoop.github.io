New South Wales has recorded just two more cases of coronavirus with both in hotel quarantine. 

The new infections on Tuesday have brought the state's total number to 4,017. 

Despite there being no new locally acquired cases, health authorities are urging residents to get tested for the mildest of symptoms.

The drop in infections comes after it was announced Queensland would open its border bubble to include five more shires in NSW. 

Both of the COVID-19 cases recorded in NSW on Tuesday are in returned travellers in hotel quarantine (pictured workers wear face mask at Opera Bar in Sydney)

NSW Health said testing numbers had declined in recent weeks to more than 7,000 each day. 

'NSW Health is appealing to the community to come forward for testing right away if you have a runny nose or scratchy throat, cough, fever or other symptoms that could be COVID-19,' health authorities said.

'If people don’t come forward and get tested, we can’t keep the pandemic at bay.

'We would like to see testing levels above 20,000 as achieved last week, particularly in South Western Sydney, and ahead of school holidays. For the sake of your friends and family, get a test.' 

There are 77 patients being treated for COVID-19 with three in intensive care and one on ventilation. 

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced on Tuesday as of next weekend the state would be open to more NSW residents after recording zero new cases. 

Residents of Byron Shire, Ballina, Lismore, the Richmond Valley including Casino and Evans Head, Glen Innes and 41 other postcodes will be added to the Queensland-NSW border bubble from 1am on October 1.

Ms Palaszczuk said those 125,000 NSW residents will be able to travel freely in Queensland and residents of her state will also be able to travel in far northern NSW. 

More to come.
