After taking off her mask, Kate admitted her appearance on the show was 'one of the most extreme experiences I've ever had'.

'I can barely see anything out of the mask, so this is the first time I've ever seen you guys. This is the first time I've seen what this room looks like,' she said.

Speaking about her dress, she added: 'I think it weighs about 15 kilos. It's really bloody heavy. And it's got momentum, too. Like, if I go in one direction, I've got to watch the inertia 'cause it might pull me back.'
