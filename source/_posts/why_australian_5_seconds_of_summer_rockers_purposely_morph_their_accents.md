Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer (5SOS) have been criticised in the past for their strong American, and specifically Californian, twang.

Band members Luke Hemmings, Calum Hood, Ashton Irwin, and Michael Clifford have developed hybrid accents since relocating to Los Angeles several years ago.

But there is a reason behind why the pop-rock band, who hail from Sydney, purposely morph the way they speak overseas.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday, Luke's older brother Jack Hemmings revealed the mystery surrounding his famous sibling's unusual accent.

'We definitely give it to him a little bit... it's more noticeable when we're with him over here in Australia,' Jack said of mocking his brother's American twang.  

'I think depending on where he is, if he's here or he's back home [in the States], he has to sort of morph his accent so he can be understood,' Jack explained.

He added: 'I know when I'm visiting him over there, It's hard to get your point across every now and then, or when you're trying to order. He sort of has to be a hybrid depending on where he is.'

In 2018, 5SOS singer Michael Clifford spoke about his newfound American accent during an appearance on KIIS FM's Kyle And Jackie O show. 

'I think all of us kind of have to chameleon a little bit into other accents,' he explained on behalf of the band.

'People in other countries just don't understand Australians and that's a fact.'

He added: 'If anyone from Australia has travelled overseas, no one knows what the f**k we're talking about, so you have to change your accent and you have to adapt.'
