While many would-be holidaymakers have been forced to cancel their end-of-summer jaunts due to the coronavirus pandemic, there was nothing holding back the well-heeled shoppers who jetted out to Italy last week for a lavish celebration hosted by Dolce & Gabbana.

Lady Kitty Spencer, 29, led the fashion pack as they descended on Florence for a busy schedule of dinners, dancing and haute couture runway shows to showcase - and sell - the label's latest designs to their wealthy clients. 

Fashionistas flew into Tuscany to enjoy at least three different events hosted at exclusive venues across the city.

The Alta Sartoria show - literally translated to mean 'high-level formalwear' - saw models donning intricate kaftans and flowing bottoms as they strode through Palazzo Vecchio, the hulking 12th-century fortress which sits at the heart of Florence. 

Monica Belluci, a long-time muse of co-founders Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce, kicked off proceedings while the glitteratti looked on. 

Two nights later, guests gathered at Villa Bardini for the breathtaking Alta Moda show, considered to be the centrepiece of the fashion house's latest offering.
