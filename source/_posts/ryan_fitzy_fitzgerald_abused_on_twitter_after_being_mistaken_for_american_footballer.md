Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald experienced a case of mistaken identity on Monday. 

A rabid NFL fan mixed him up with Dolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, and hilarity ensued. 

The fan Tweeted a stream of abuse at the 43-year-old, apparently angry at the American footballer, not the Australian radio host with a similar name.

The clearly irate fan wrote: '@FitzySA Fitzgerald you suck!!! You need to be on the bench!!!!' 

They went on: 'Old a*s... SCARED OF GETTING HIT A*S!!! Wtf???!!?? Guaranteed to throw a pick a*s!!!'

Fitzy took the trolling in good humour, replying to the hapless fan as if he was in fact  Ryan Fitzpatrick.

The clearly irate fan wrote: '@FitzySA Fitzgerald you suck!!! You need to be on the bench!!!!'

He Tweeted back comically:  'F**k you Julie, I give my everything for Miami, football is my life. 

'You don't know how hard it is carrying all that pressure for the team, plus those line backers want to inflict pain and that can really hurt.'

Fans seemed amused by the exchange, with one person Tweeting: 'Awesome comeback!' 

Loves a joke: Fitzy took the trolling in good humour, replying to the hapless fan as if he was in fact Ryan Fitzpatrick



He Tweeted back comically: 'F**k you Julie, I give my everything for Miami, football is my life'

While another happily joined in the fun, writing: 'I agree Julie !! Can't kick, can't handball ! Sh**house that Fitzy !!' 

He may not be any good at football, but the former Big Brother star is a beloved radio personality. 

Fitzy is best known as a breakfast radio host on his Nova FM radio show, Fitzy & Wippa, which he co-hosts with Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli.
