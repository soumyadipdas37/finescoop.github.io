It lasts on the skin for over 48-hours so the customer doesn't need to keep reapplying and it can clear up major skin markings in as little as seven days.  

'Use on very dry skin: rough feet, itchy legs, scaly hands, parched face - it's even great on lips. For best results, apply at night to wake up dewy and hydrated,' the website read. 

'Omg the best ever! I've since used it on a scratch from my naughty cat and it's healed so quickly,' one woman wrote on the offical Instagram page. 

'I literally cried after trying this product on my constant dry lips, after spending hundreds on trying to find something that helped, this has been a saviour,' said another.

'Not only is it good for my lips...it is has helped my dermatitis on my hands which I have struggled with for so long! Much loved and used product.'

'The natural ingredients especially within this product are amazing! I love that there isn't petroleum jelly or any other classified substances that aren't necessarily good for the skin. I have an obsession with the texture of all Lanolips products and especially the golden dry skin salve,' said a third.

Another added: 'I put this on my scar last night around 10pm, it is 9am at the moment and my scar and the skin around it still feel incredibly moisturised and feel great! I don't feel that uncomfortable pulling when I stretch or reach anymore. I will definitely continue to use this'.

Kirsten's favourite product is still the tried-and-tested $18.99 101 multi-purpose balm

Lanolips founder Kirsten Carriol was first exposed to the healing effects of lanolin after her father, a molecular scientist and sheep farmer, told her that wool contains the oil, which mimics the same hydrating oils of human skin.

The mother-of-two launched her brand in 2009 in ode to this wonder ingredient and it has quickly picked up a large celebrity following, with the likes of Drew Barrymore, Kaley Cuoco, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Sienna Miller using the balms.

Kirsten's favourite product is still the tried-and-tested $18.99 101 multi-purpose balm because it's the 'beating heart of the range.'
