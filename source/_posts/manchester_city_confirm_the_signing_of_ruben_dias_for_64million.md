Manchester City will finalise the £64million signing of Benfica defender Ruben Dias this week with Nicolas Otamendi travelling in the opposite direction for a separate £13.7m.

Dias captained and scored for Benfica in their 2-0 win over Moreirense on Saturday before hugging sporting director Rui Costa as he said his farewells.  

Talking to Benfica TV afterwards, the 23-year old said: ‘This was a special moment for me and I think everyone understands why. I'm very happy of course, it was a very important game for me and being able to mark this game with a goal was very special. I believe that everyone already has an idea of why I hugged Rui Costa.’

Manchester City will finalise the £64million deal for Benfica defender Ruben Dias this week

Manchester City's Nicolas Otamendi will go the opposite way for a separate fee of £13.7million

Otamendi, 32, is expected in Lisbon on Monday.

Benfica coach Jorge Jesus said: 'He's a player we're sorry to see go, he came through the academy, is our captain and plays for the national team. Otamendi is a player we'd like to have. Though the player who joins us will have to understand that my ideas are completely different from those at Manchester City.'

City moved for Dias after growing frustrated by Sevilla's valuation of Jules Kounde.

Meanwhile, Barcelona remain interested in City defender Eric Garcia though may have to sell Jean-Clair Todibo before they can bid. Todibo has attracted interest from Everton and Fulham. 

Barcelona have agreed to pay £18m to Ajax for right-back Sergino Dest. The deal put paid to the chance of Norwich City defender Max Aarons joining Barcelona though he has interest from Bayern Munich.
