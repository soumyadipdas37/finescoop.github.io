Sheffield United will bring in Scotland forward Oliver Burke this week as part of a swap deal with West Bromwich Albion for Callum Robinson.

Burke is not required at the Hawthorns and spent the last season on-loan at Spanish side Alaves.

Meanwhile, Robinson spent the last season on-loan at the Hawthorns and impressed the club during their promotion winning campaign.

Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder is also looking to complete the £11m double signing of Derby County full-backs Jayden Bogle and Max Lowe.

Bogle, 20, has also had interest from West Ham and Fulham during the summer. 

Talks are ongoing with both players left out of Derby's squad that faced Barrow in the Carabao Cup on Saturday.

Burke and Robinson are currently away on international duty and will finalise their transfers once they return.

Meanwhile, West Brom have signed Brighton goalkeeper David Button for an undisclosed fee.

The Baggies confirmed the transfer this morning ahead of a pre-season friendly against the Seagulls.

He is expected to provide competition to number one keeper Sam Johnstone this season.
