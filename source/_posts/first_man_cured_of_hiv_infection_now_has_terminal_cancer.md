Timothy Ray Brown, the first person known to have been cured of HIV infection, says he is now terminally ill from a recurrence of the cancer that prompted his historic treatment 12 years ago.

Brown, dubbed 'the Berlin patient' because of where he lived at the time, had a transplant from a donor with a rare, natural resistance to the AIDS virus. For years, that was thought to have cured his leukemia and his HIV infection, and he still shows no signs of HIV.

But in an interview, Brown said his cancer returned last year and has spread widely. He´s receiving hospice care where he now lives in Palm Springs, California.

'I'm still glad that I had it,' Brown said of his 2007 bone marrow transplant.

'It opened up doors that weren't there before' and inspired scientists to work harder to find a cure, which many had begun to think was not possible, the 54-year-old said Thursday.

'Timothy proved that HIV can be cured, but that´s not what inspires me about him,' said Dr. Steven Deeks, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has worked with Brown to further research toward a cure.

'We took pieces of his gut, we took pieces of his lymph nodes. Every time he was asked to do something, he showed up with amazing grace,' Deeks said.

Brown was an American working as a translator in Berlin in the 1990s when he learned he had HIV. In 2006, he was diagnosed with leukemia.

Dr. Gero Huetter, a blood cancer expert at the University of Berlin, believed that a marrow transplant was Brown's best chance of beating the leukemia. 

He wondered, could he also cure Brown's other life-threatening disease by using a donor with a gene mutation that provides natural resistance to the AIDS virus?

Donors like these are very rare and transplants are risky. Doctors have to destroy the patient's diseased immune system with chemotherapy and radiation, then transplant the donor´s cells and hope they develop into a new immune system for the recipient.

Brown´s first transplant in 2007 was only partly successful: His HIV seemed to be gone but his leukemia was not. He had a second transplant from the same donor in March 2008 and that one seemed to work.

Since then, Brown has repeatedly tested negative for HIV and has frequently appeared at AIDS conferences where cure research is discussed.

'He´s been like an ambassador of hope,' said Brown´s partner, Tim Hoeffgen.

A second man, Adam Castillejo -- called 'the London patient' until he revealed his identity earlier this year -- also is believed to have been cured by a transplant similar to Brown´s in 2016.

But donors like these are scarce and the procedure is too risky to be widely used.

Scientists have been testing gene therapy and other ways to try to get the effect of the favorable gene mutation without having to do a transplant. At an AIDS conference in July, researchers said they may have achieved a long-term remission in a Brazil man by using a powerful combination of drugs meant to flush dormant HIV from his body.

Mark King, a Baltimore man who writes a blog for people with HIV, said he spoke with Brown earlier this week and is grateful for what Brown has contributed to AIDS research.

'It is unfathomable what value he has been to the world as a subject of science. And yet this is also a human being who is a kind, humble guy who certainly never asked for the spotlight,' King said. 'I think the world of him.'

The vast majority of humans carry the gene CCR5. 

In many ways, it is incredibly unhelpful. 

It affects our odds of surviving and recovering from a stroke, according to recent research. 

And it is the main access point for HIV to overtake our immune systems. 

But some people carry a mutations that prevents CCR5 from expressing itself, effectively blocking or eliminating the gene.  

Those few people in the world are called 'elite controllers' by HIV experts. They are naturally resistant to HIV. 

If the virus ever entered their body, they would naturally 'control' the virus as if they were taking the virus-suppressing drugs that HIV patients require.

Both the Berlin patient and the London patient received stem cells donated from people with that crucial mutation.

WHY HAS IT NEVER WORKED BEFORE?

'There are many reasons this hasn't worked,' Dr Janet Siliciano, a leading HIV researcher at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told DailyMail.com. 

1. FINDING DONORS

'It's incredibly difficult to find HLA-matched bone marrow [i.e. someone with the same proteins in their blood as you],' Dr Siliciano said.

'It's even more difficult to find the CCR5 mutation.' 

2. INEFFECTIVE TRANSPLANT LEADS TO CANCER RELAPSE

Second, there is always a risk that the bone marrow won't 'take'. 

'Sometimes you don't become fully "chimeric", meaning you still have a lot of your own cells.'

That is one of the two most common reasons for previous attempts failing: their immune system is not fully replaced, then the cancer comes back and they can't survive it.  

3. GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE: THE OLD IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKS THE NEW ONE

The other most common reason this approach has failed is graft-versus-host disease.

That is when the patient's immune system tries to attack the incoming, replacement immune system, causing a fatal reaction in most. 

4. UNKNOWN QUANTITIES

Interestingly, both the Berlin patient and the London patient experienced complications that are normally lethal in most other cases. 

And experts believe that those complications helped their cases. 

Timothy Ray Brown, the Berlin patient, had both - his cancer returned and he developed graft-versus-host disease, putting him in a coma and requiring a second bone marrow transplant. 

The London patient had one: he suffered graft-versus-host disease. 

Against the odds, they both survived, HIV-free.

Some believe that, ironically, graft-versus-host disease might have helped both of them to further obliterate their HIV. 

But there is no way to control or replicate that safely.
