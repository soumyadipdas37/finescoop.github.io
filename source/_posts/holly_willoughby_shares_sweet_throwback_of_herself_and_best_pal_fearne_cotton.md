They are long-term pals and starred in comedy panel show Celebrity Juice together.

So it's no surprise Holly Willoughby was among Fearne Cotton's nearest and dearest wishing her a happy birthday on Thursday as she turned 39.

The This Morning presenter, also 39, took to her Instagram Stories to share a sweet throwback of the duo together at the National Television Awards in 2017. 

Love! Holly Willoughby was among Fearne Cotton's nearest and dearest wishing her a happy birthday on Thursday as she turned 39

Holly looked lovely in a pale pink gown as she pouted for the snap, while Fearne opted for an elegant black dress with statement earrings.

She captioned the snap: 'Love you Cotton Chops!'

Earlier in the day, Fearne enthused watching her daughter Honey, four, getting ready for her first day back at school was the 'best birthday gift'.

The TV star, who raises her mini-me and son Rex, seven, with husband Jesse Wood, shared a image of Honey in her black, grey and white school clothes.

The presenter said in an accompanying caption: 'The best birthday treat. Watching my big girl go off to her school induction. Bursting with pride. My fellow Virgo queen.'

The TV and radio star marked her birthday with a fresh-faced snap of herself wearing a baggy T-shirt and holding a mug in her hand.

Fearne wore her pink locks up in a messy bun and showcased a selection of jewellery including a necklace with her daughter's name on.

She wrote in the caption of the image: 'This is 39. Last nights make up on. Hair breaking free. The only one up in the house. I probably won't change but I'm always expanding and improving. 39.

'I won't let anyone dim my light, I will keep dying my hair pink, I will dress as I always have, I will keep loving with my whole heart, I'll send over the top texts to people I adore, I'll keep letting go and learning.

'I'll say 'I love you' 'I'm sorry' 'thank you' 'F**k it', I'll keep trying, I'll keep trying to not try so hard, I'll keep being me. This is 39.'

Holly once again wished her pal happy birthday in the comments section of the post, while many of her other famous pals also sent their well wishes.
