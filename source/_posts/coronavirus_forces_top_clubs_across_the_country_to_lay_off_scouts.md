The coronavirus crisis is threatening to decimate English football's vast scouting industry.

Clubs across the country — including Arsenal and Everton — are laying off scouts who are being locked out of games.

Traditionally the network of hundreds of talent-spotters who are employed to unearth the next generation of top players ply their trade at reserve and Under 23 matches as well as attending big games in the top division. 

Arsenal released scout Brian McDermott and their heads of UK and international scouting

But biosecurity guidelines brought in to keep stadiums and training grounds free of Covid-19 mean many scouts and indeed agents are finding themselves unable to get in.

Some clubs are saving money by scrapping regular payments to freelancers, while others are making staff roles redundant and not renewing contracts. Instead, some are asking their in-house analysts — usually employed purely to analyse forthcoming opposition — to run the rule over players via video tape.

Before the pandemic, scouts could attend first-team games at any level simply by contacting the home club and asking for a ticket. Now, guidelines say that only six are allowed — one each from the next three opponents due to face the two clubs playing in any particular match. But it is further down the food chain where the problem is being most keenly felt.

Everton are another big club who have laid off scouting staff amid the coronavirus pandemic

For example, a big Under 23 — or Premier League 2 — game such as Friday's Manchester United v Liverpool contest or next weekend's clash between Chelsea and Arsenal would attract as many as two dozen scouts. Now most scouts, if not all, are being refused access.

The problem is not helped by the fact many PL2 games are being played at training grounds rather than satellite stadiums. Covid-19 measures are particularly stringent at training grounds given the possible proximity of visitors to first-team players and staff.

It was revealed last month that Arsenal had released Stewart Houston, Pat Rice, Brian McDermott and their heads of UK and international scouting as part of their coronavirus cost-cutting scheme.

Meanwhile, it is understood that Everton have not renewed the short-term contracts of a number of scouts that ran out at the end of last season.
