An NHS worker who admitted she did 'f all' during the pandemic and claimed coronavirus was a 'load of bs' is now being investigated. 
Care UK employee Louise Hampton, who yesterday rallied in London with 10,000 other anti-lockdown protesters, said that 'our service was dead.'
'This is my certificate of bks.' Ms Hampton said in the video as she brandished a card given to her and other NHS workers. 'I didn't clap for the NHS, I didn't clap for myself. Because why would I clap for myself when I did f all?'
Ms Hampton's stark message comes amid rising fears over a backlog of millions of cancer screenings and other operations which have been delayed by the pandemic.

Ms Hampton has since posted a selfie while on the way to London to join more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters who believe coronavirus is a hoax at the 'Unite for Freedom' rally on Saturday (pictured  Protesters march towards Westminster from Trafalgar Square during a demonstration organised by a group called 'Stand Up X', in London on Saturday)
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yesterday he believed that a backlog of cancer patients awaiting treatment would clear 'within a matter of months.'
Speaking to ITV, Mr Hancock admitted that the number of cancer patients waiting longer than 62 days - the standard the Government wants to see - increased 'substantially' amid lockdown. 
Mr Hancock said 'We've had to take action right across the NHS to make sure that we deal with Covid, and it was very important when there were a lot of new cases of Covid that people weren't made more at risk because of treatments, especially for cancer.
'But now it's incredibly important for people to come forward.' 
He refused to a put a 'precise date' on the number the backlog would be cleared by, because he said that 'depends on how much Covid there is'.
But Cancer Research UK estimates 2.4 million people were waiting for a cancer screening, further tests or cancer treatment at the end of May, with a backlog of around 2.1 million people left waiting for breast, bowel or cervical screening. 
Cancer Research UK says that 3,800 cancers would normally be diagnosed through screening in this time period.
There were nine coronavirus deaths and 1,276 cases recorded in the United Kingdom on Friday.
Meanwhile, Cancer Research UK estimates 2.4 million people were waiting for a cancer screening, further tests or cancer treatment at the end of May, with a backlog of around 2.1 million people left waiting for breast, bowel or cervical screening.
The Royal College of Surgeons revealed last week that 2 million operations have been delayed because only the most urgent surgeries are going ahead.
In the clip posted to Ms Hampton's Facebook page, she said 'I'm an actual NHS worker and apparently I worked really hard during Covid. Did I bks. That's why it's a certificate of bks.
'Our service was dead. We weren't getting the calls, it was dead. Covid is a load of bks, so this is my certificate of bks.
'I didn't clap for the NHS, I didn't clap for myself. Because why would I clap for myself when I did f all?'
Ms Hampton posted a selfie yesterday as she headed to London to join more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters at the 'Unite for Freedom' rally.
She wrote 'En route to Trafalgar Square! So excited! We are the 99% #London #Plandemic #Covid1984'
At the event, demonstrators called for an 'end to Government lies' and the restoration of all freedoms as they marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament.
The day after posting her video, Ms Hampton posted saying she had received 'so many messages of support' from people, including NHS workers.
But she added 'A few people close to me have labelled me ''mental'' and even said I need sectioning for my video! 
'Also I don't deserve my children! However, if people want to believe the narrative that's up to them. I will keep speaking my truth!!!'
Ms Hampton has made a series of posts online about the virus using the hashtags #Covid1984, #NWO, #SaveOurChildren, #Plandemic and #WeWillNotBeMuzzled.
She also posted a meme which read 'If you've ever wondered whether you would have complied during 1930s Germany, now you know.'

A Care UK spokesman told MailOnline 'We are aware of this video, which we consider to be materially inaccurate in a number of ways, and can confirm that a member of staff is subject to investigation.
'We expect all our colleagues and services to support the work of the NHS in giving the public the right information and support during the pandemic. 
'Our call centres were, in fact, exceptionally busy, handling a peak of 400% more calls than usual. 
'Our teams showed huge commitment and dedication in delivering the service, and we have rightly thanked them for the efforts they have made.'​​
