An NHS worker who admitted she did 'f*** all' during the pandemic and claimed coronavirus was a 'load of b******s' is now being investigated. 

Care UK employee Louise Hampton, who yesterday rallied in London with 10,000 other anti-lockdown protesters, said that 'our service was dead' in a Facebook video post.

'This is my certificate of b*****ks.' Ms Hampton said as she brandished a card given to her and other NHS workers. 'I didn't clap for the NHS, I didn't clap for myself. Because why would I clap for myself when I did f*** all?'

It is not clear exactly what Ms Hampton does at Care UK, but the company said in a statement - refuting her allegations - that their call centres have been exceptionally busy, suggesting she answers calls.

Ms Hampton's broadside comes amid rising fears over a backlog of millions of cancer screenings and other operations which have been delayed by the pandemic.

There was just one coronavirus death in the United Kingdom on Sunday and another 1,715 new cases were recorded. The death toll from the disease now stands at 41,499 and there have been 334,467 cases. 

Meanwhile, Cancer Research UK estimates 2.4 million people were waiting for a cancer screening, further tests or cancer treatment at the end of May, with a backlog of around 2.1 million people left waiting for breast, bowel or cervical screening.

Ms Hampton has since posted a selfie while on the way to London to join more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters who believe coronavirus is a hoax at the 'Unite for Freedom' rally on Saturday (pictured:  Protesters march towards Westminster from Trafalgar Square during a demonstration organised by a group called 'Stand Up X', in London on Saturday)

Another 1,715 people have tested positive for coronavirus today in the biggest daily rise in 12 weeks

 But, in a positive sign, the country's death toll is remaining low as just one person died after testing positive for the disease bringing the UK's total fatalities during the pandemic to 41,499

The Royal College of Surgeons revealed last week that 2 million operations have been delayed because only the most urgent surgeries are going ahead.

In the clip posted to Ms Hampton's Facebook page, she said: 'I'm an actual NHS worker and apparently I worked really hard during Covid. Did I b*****ks. That's why it's a certificate of b*****ks.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yesterday he believed that a backlog of cancer patients awaiting treatment would clear 'within a matter of months.'

Speaking to ITV, Mr Hancock admitted that the number of cancer patients waiting longer than 62 days - the standard the Government wants to see - increased 'substantially' amid lockdown. 

Mr Hancock said: 'We've had to take action right across the NHS to make sure that we deal with Covid, and it was very important when there were a lot of new cases of Covid that people weren't made more at risk because of treatments, especially for cancer.

'But now it's incredibly important for people to come forward.' 

He refused to a put a 'precise date' on the number the backlog would be cleared by, because he said that 'depends on how much Covid there is'.

But Cancer Research UK estimates 2.4 million people were waiting for a cancer screening, further tests or cancer treatment at the end of May, with a backlog of around 2.1 million people left waiting for breast, bowel or cervical screening. 

Cancer Research UK says that 3,800 cancers would normally be diagnosed through screening in this time period.

'Our service was dead. We weren't getting the calls, it was dead. Covid is a load of b*****ks, so this is my certificate of b*****ks.

'I didn't clap for the NHS, I didn't clap for myself. Because why would I clap for myself when I did f*** all?'

Ms Hampton posted a selfie yesterday as she headed to London to join more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters at the 'Unite for Freedom' rally.

She wrote: 'En route to Trafalgar Square! So excited! We are the 99% #London #Plandemic #Covid1984'

At the event, demonstrators called for an 'end to Government lies' and the restoration of all freedoms as they marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament.

The day after posting her video, Ms Hampton posted saying she had received 'so many messages of support' from people, including NHS workers.

But she added: 'A few people close to me have labelled me ''mental'' and even said I need sectioning for my video! 

'Also I don't deserve my children! However, if people want to believe the narrative that's up to them. I will keep speaking my truth!!!'

Ms Hampton has made a series of posts online about the virus using the hashtags #Covid1984, #NWO, #SaveOurChildren, #Plandemic and #WeWillNotBeMuzzled.

The hashtags have been widely used by those who believe that the coronavirus is part of a conspiracy to establish a new world order (NWO) and impose authoritarian measures similar to lockdown on a permanent basis. 

Ms Hampton also posted a meme which read: 'If you've ever wondered whether you would have complied during 1930s Germany, now you know.' 

A Care UK spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of this video, which we consider to be materially inaccurate in a number of ways, and can confirm that a member of staff is subject to investigation.

'We expect all our colleagues and services to support the work of the NHS in giving the public the right information and support during the pandemic. 

'Our call centres were, in fact, exceptionally busy, handling a peak of 400% more calls than usual. 

'Our teams showed huge commitment and dedication in delivering the service, and we have rightly thanked them for the efforts they have made.'​​

It comes after the Health Secretary has warned that nationwide restrictions cannot be ruled out should England see a spike in coronavirus cases this winter.

Matt Hancock also hinted that restrictions may not be eased over Christmas to avoid an 'uptick' in the number of Covid-19 cases.

Speaking to The Times, Mr Hancock said countries in others parts of the world were already experiencing a second wave, adding it was 'a very serious threat'.

But he said the UK was managing to keep the number of new cases 'flat' through the test and trace system and local lockdowns.

Describing the worst-case scenario, he said the UK could be battling bad flu and a growth in coronavirus as people spend more time indoors.

He continued: 'Cases go up again, and we have to use very extensive local lockdowns or take further national action.

'We don't rule that out, but we don't want to see it.'

BBC's Newsnight reported that a 'reasonable worst-case planning assumption' presented to the Government warned there could be up to 81,000 excess deaths directly attributed to Covid-19 between July and next March.

The broadcaster said the scenario was laid out in a document signed off by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) for the Cabinet Office at the end of July.

His comments come as local Covid-19 restrictions were eased in northern England, which will allow social gatherings between two homes from Wednesday in Bolton, Stockport, Trafford, Burnley, Hyndburn and parts of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees.

Mr Hancock told The Times that a second wave could be 'avoidable but it's not easy', with schools reopening next week presenting new challenges in stopping the spread of the virus.

In an interview with ITV News, Mr Hancock said: 'We're doing a huge amount of planning to make sure that the NHS is prepared and can cope to make sure that people can have as much freedom to enjoy Christmas, to enjoy winter, as possible.'

But when asked whether there will be special rules to allow more people to visit one another over Christmas, Mr Hancock suggested it could lead to a rise in the number of people catching the virus.

'The danger of a rule like that is that it increases the spread of the disease,' he said.

'I mean, there are an awful lot of things I'd love to be able to do, but the risk of them is that we see an uptick in the disease.

'Hence, we've had to take decisions that you wouldn't ever want to.'
