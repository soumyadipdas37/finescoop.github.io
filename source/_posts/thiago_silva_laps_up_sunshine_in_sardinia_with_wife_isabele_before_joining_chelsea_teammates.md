Thiago Silva is lapping up the last of the summer sunshine before his attention turns to his first season with Chelsea. 

The veteran defender is enjoying a break in Sardinia with his wife Isabela, who posted a picture of them on a boat off the coast. 

Silva played his last game for PSG in the Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich before signing with the Blues as a free agent.

Frank Lampard has afforded the 35-year-old some extended time off to recover and he is recharging the batteries in idyllic surroundings. 

His wife shared two snaps of them both in swimming gear and wrote the caption: 'It's beautiful when someone chooses to stay when they can leave. 

'I never looked for perfection, and we are that, the “imperfect” choice, but surely, the most certain thing we did in life, I love you.'

The couple are in Sardinia and Silva has been given time off after the Champions League final
