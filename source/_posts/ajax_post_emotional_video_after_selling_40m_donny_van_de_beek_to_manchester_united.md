And the Dutch club posted a video ofÂ Van de Beek's time at the club, with the midfielder speaking to his Dad on the phone in the voiceover.Â

'You were there for my debut. My first goal. You were there for me when they sang my name,' Van de Beek says.

'I am so thankful for all your supportÂ from trainers, team-mates, fans and from you guys. Thank you, Dad. Thank you for everything.

'Now it's time. Time for the next step. Time for a new dream.'Â 

A product of Ajax's famous academy, the midfielder has made 175 appearances for the Dutch club, scoring 41 goals.Â

He won the Eredivisie and the Dutch Cup in the 2018-19 campaign, and was part of the Ajax side that was beaten by United in the 2017 Europa League final.Â 

Van de Beek left the club on Wednesday and joined United on a five-year contract, with an option to extend for a further year, believed to be worth around Â£107,000-a-week before bonuses.

He becomes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first signing of the summer and could now form part of an exciting midfield trio alongside Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes.

Solskjaer added: 'Donny has all of the technical attributes needed to perform in this team and has the personality required to succeed at Manchester United.

'His ability to see space, time his movements and read the game will really complement the qualities that we have in midfield and his arrival really strengthens the depth of talent we have in that position.

'Donny's performances in the Eredivisie and in Europe have been excellent over the last few years and we are all looking forward to working with him.'Â Â Â
