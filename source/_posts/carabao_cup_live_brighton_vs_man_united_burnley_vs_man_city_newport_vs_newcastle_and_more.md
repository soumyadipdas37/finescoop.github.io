The Carabao Cup fourth round action continues on Wednesday as Brighton and Manchester United meet for the second time in four days with Graham Potter's men looking to avoid another narrow loss.

There are four teams looking to book a spot in the quarter-finals of the competition, joining Tottenham Hotspur who saw off Chelsea on penalties on Tuesday night.

Sportsmail will provide live EFL Cup coverage of Brighton vs Man United including latest scores, lineup and build-up as well as scores from elsewhere.

Host commentator

In the match that kicked off at 5.30pm, League Two side Newport County currently lead Newcastle 1-0 thanks to an early Tristan Abrahams strike. We are into the second half at Rodney Parade and what a way that would be to start off the night if that scoreline stays the same.

So what will the Carabao Cup bring us this evening as four teams look to join Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-finals of the competition following their shootout victory over Chelsea last night?

Hopefully a little bit more drama in the actual 90 minutes to be honest after a largely dull affair at White Hart Lane but otherwise good evening and welcome to our live coverage.
