Zendaya won over audiences last year with her breakout leading role in HBO's hyper-stylized teen drama.

And the former Disney Channel star has been recognized for her performance, which landed her her first Emmy nomination.

She made history Sunday, when she became the youngest winner in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.

The 24-year-old was surrounded by friends and family, as she telecasted her acceptance speech from home.

She said in her speech: 'I just wanna say thank to the TV Academy, to all the other incredible women in this category. I admire you so much. Whoa, this is crazy. Thank you HBO and A24 for all your support. Thank you to my family and my team, who's all here. I'm really grateful to have all of you here. 

'To the incredible cast and crew of Euphoria, I'm so lucky to go to work with you everyday, and I'm inspired by everything you do. And to [creator] Sam Levinson, I appreciate you so much, you're my family. I'm so grateful for Rue. I'm so grateful that you trusted me with your story, and I hope I continue to do you proud. 

'I know this is a really weird time to be celebrating, but I just wanna say there is hope in the young people out there. I know that our show doesn't always feel like a great example of that, but there is hope in the young people. And I just want to say to all my peers out there, doing work in the streets: I see you, I admire you, I thank you. Thank you so, so much.'

She beat out Jennifer Aniston, Olivia Colman, Laura Linney, Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer, who was previously the youngest winner, when she won the award last year at 26 for Killing Eve. 

Zendaya stars in Euphoria as Rue Bennett, a 17-year-old drug addict reacquainting herself with high school and her deadly habits after finishing rehab. 

She previously wrote on Instagram in July about her first nomination: 'I’m honestly speechless, my heart is just overflowing with love and gratitude. I’m so incredibly honored to work beside the talented people that I get to call family. 

'I am a small piece of a big beautiful puzzle and I’m so proud of all of you. Thank you to everyone out there who’s watched and given our show life, thank you @samlev00 @hbo @a24 for everything and @televisionacad for this beautiful acknowledgment, thank you, thank you, thank you. We out here Emmy nominated y’all!!'
