Kate Middleton appeared relaxed as she recycled her pink £29.50 M&S trousers to meet with parents helped by peer support networks during the Covid-19 pandemic today. 

The Duchess of Cambridge, 38, lived at her Norfolk home of Anmer Hall during lockdown but is now back at her London home of Kensington Palace with Prince William, 38, and their children Prince George, six, Princess Charlotte, five, and Prince Louis, two.

The mother-of-three was effortlessly elegant as she joined the fellow parents in London this morning, opting for a simple white t-shirt and rewearing her M&S pink suit trousers for the visit. 

The duchess was greeted in the autumn sunshine in the picturesque Old English Garden in Battersea Park where she spoke with the mothers, whose children were in pushchairs, as they sat socially distanced on wooden park benches.

The Duchess chatted with parents helped by different peer groups - such as Home-Start, National Childbirth Trust (NCT) and Mush - and heard how they had struggled to meet up during the Covid-19 lockdown.

She wore her hair in her signature bouncy blow dry and kept her makeup neutral for the event.

The royal swapped her usual heels for a pair of comfortable trainers, and appeared relaxed as she stepped out in the autumnal sun to meet with fellow parents.

Ahead of the visit, the Duchess held a video call with eight organisations to speak about helping parents with young children.

The Duchess of Cambridge, who spent lockdown in Norfolk with Prince WIlliam and their three children, was effortlessly elegant on the park visit 

Meanwhile, at the park, Kate was told how peer groups struggled to meet up during Covid-19 lockdown and how important access to outside space is to their health and wellbeing.  

Among the groups was Home-Start, whose volunteers give thousands of hours of help to parents tackling issues such as postnatal depression, isolation and bereavement.

Others included Parents 1st, the Island House Charity Community Parent Programme based in Tower Hamlets, Better Start Blackpool, NCT, Applied Research Collaboration - North West coast, the children's charity Coram, and Leeds Dads.

Peer-to-peer supporters can range from paid professionals and trained volunteers to more informal parent networks.

A key part of many peer support networks is the ability to meet up and spend time together, which has been affected by COVID-19.  

Her visit today comes after she joined Prince William to highlight how communities have coped during Covid-19 in London last week.

The Duke and Duchess travelled to London Bridge and Whitechapel last week, where they celebrated the traditions of London’s East End by making Jewish bagel snacks and meeting with Muslim volunteers supporting the community during the coronavirus outbreak. 

The couple, who had not appeared together in public since July, appeared relaxed during the outing, and were said to be keen to shine a light on individuals and businesses who have gone above and beyond to help others during the pandemic.
