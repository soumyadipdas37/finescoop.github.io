Australian fitness queen Kayla Itsines has shared the simple lunch she eats when she's busy juggling clients and looking after her one-year-old daughter - and it only takes five minutes to make.

The 29-year-old, who recently split from her fiancé Tobi Pearce after the couple built a global fitness empire worth $696million, said this is her 'go-to meal' on busy days'.

'I usually have all of the ingredients in my fridge already so it's really quick to put together,' Kayla posted on Instagram.

Kayla explained that she likes the simple dish, because it's 'full of fresh vegetables' but also has some rice and tuna in it, which fills her up and gives her lasting energy throughout the day.

'I don't really measure anything, but if you want to make it you'll need a handful of cherry tomatoes, half an avocado, around a quarter of a cucumber, red onion, a can of tuna and half a cup of rice,' Kayla said.

'I add a drizzle of balsamic glaze, a drizzle of oil and some salt and cracked pepper and throw everything into a bowl and it's ready to eat.

'It literally takes five minutes to make!' she added.

The 29-year-old (pictured) typically has two breakfasts - usually some eggs on toast and a green tea before training and then some fruit and yoghurt and a coffee after training

Kayla typically uses brown rice as it has more complex carbohydrates than white rice and so it will keep you fuller for longer.

She also said that vegetarians and vegans could substitute the tuna out for chickpeas, tofu or eggs if they eat them instead.

Thousands who saw the simple recipe were impressed with it, and said they couldn't wait to try it for themselves.

'This is my go to lunch as well! The only difference is I add lemon juice and chilli flakes,' one woman wrote. 

'This looks delicious!' another added. 

Lunch for Kayla (pictured) is usually something like the tuna and rice dish or some form of carbs and some protein, while dinner is the same: quality protein and a small portion of carbs

Kayla (pictured) said if she is craving sugar, she often has a cup of tea as she says many confuse hunger with boredom

When it comes to the rest of her day on a plate, Kayla's diet is similarly health-focused, but also delicious.

'If I'm craving sugar, I'll have a cup of tea or something like that. I think a lot of people confuse hunger with boredom,' she said previously.

Earlier this month, Kayla split from her fiancé Tobi Pearce after the couple built a global fitness empire worth $696million.

The 29-year-old founder of the Bikini Body Guide, who shares a one-year-old daughter Arna Leia with Tobi, broke the news to her 12.6million Instagram fans.

In 2018, Forbes estimated the couple's shared net worth to be $696million.

The couple welcomed their first child together - daughter Arna Leia Pearce - in April 2019, just two months after Tobi surprised Kayla with an engagement party.

After meeting in late 2012, the pair launched the Bikini Body Training Company and went on to amass a following of more than 20million fitness enthusiasts worldwide thanks to their workouts, app and health books.

The pair were named joint fifth on the Australian Financial Review's Young Rich List for 2018, making them the wealthiest self-made 20-somethings in Australia.
