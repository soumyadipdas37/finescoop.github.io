Bella Varelis has long been a rumoured frontrunner on The Bachelor with Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert - but not anymore.

The marketing manager has seemingly proved she doesn't win Locky's heart by flaunting her friendship with intruder Bec Cvilikas in Sydney's Bondi. 

The two rumoured top five contenders, both 25, were busted having brunch on Sunday at a popular local haunt.

The proof Bella Varelis DOESN'T win: Bachelor favourite is BUSTED having brunch in Bondi with intruder Bec Cvilikas just weeks before the finale 

Bella has long been a favourite to be one of Locky's final ladies, while intruder Bec entered the season during the 'Love In Lockdown' filming break from the mansion.

The pair were all smiles during their morning catch-up, sharing laughter and friendly conversations with the waitstaff. 

Despite many stars flying under the radar while the season airs, Bella and Bec chose to dine at Bills cafe in Bondi - a popular spot for tourists and locals alike.

Clearly not trying to hide their friendship, they chose to sit out in full view of passersby on a curbside table.

Dressed casually, Bella and Bec wore stylish activewear ensembles that highlighted their enviable figures. 

The pair enjoyed coffee and juice, before tucking into a mix of sweet and savoury breakfast items. 

While they both ordered savory toast dishes with poached eggs, Bella also appeared to indulge in a side of ricotta hotcakes.

Bella showed off her sculptured pins in a pair of tiny grey shorts, and rugged up with a cosy green jumper with the words 'Hawaii' emblazoned on the front. 

Meanwhile, Bec risked a potential wardrobe disaster as she ate while wearing a long-sleeve white crop top that hugged her physique.

Embracing their natural features, Bella and Bec chose to wear minimal makeup out to breakfast and left their locks down.

In August, photos emerged from the mansion of the top five rose ceremony, which included Bella, Bec, Izzy Sharman-Firth, Kaitlyn Hoppe, and Irena Srbinovska. 

Bec appears to step into the BFF-shaped hole in Bella's Bachelor journey following her tense falling out with Irena.

On Thursday's episode Bella told Irena their friendship was over, because she could no longer trust her.

During the cocktail party, which was filmed in early July, Bella accused Irena of lying about her communication with Locky while the cast was in lockdown and labelled her a 'manipulative little b**ch'.

Now fans are now convinced Bella and Bec's newfound friendship is a major spoiler.

Their solid bond appears to be proof neither of them ends up with Locky, as the 'winner' is rarely seen with former rivals in the lead up to the finale airing.

While it rarely happens, it's important to note that some former Bachelor 'winners' have remained friends with their mansion rivals.

Bachelor Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson's 'winner' Laura Byrne was spotted hanging out with Top Four star Florence Alexandra in the lead up to her finale in 2017.

Chelsie McLeod, who briefly dated Bachelor Matt Agnew before splitting, also hung out with the cast from time-to-time.

Walk and talk: Following Bella and Bec's breakfast date, they chose to walk Sydney's iconic coastal walk between Bondi and Bronte

Following Bella and Bec's breakfast date, they chose to walk Sydney's iconic coastal walk between Bondi and Bronte.

While wearing hats and sunglasses at times during the walk, they chose to forgo masks that would have helped conceal their identities better.

They didn't appear to mind being potentially spotted by fans of the successful franchise as they walked the busy track.

Defiant star? It comes after the So Dramatic! podcast reported that Bella wasn't given her cocktail party photo last week as a 'punishment' for being seen with Bec

It comes after the So Dramatic! podcast reported that Bella Varelis wasn't given her cocktail party photo last week as a 'punishment' for leaking spoilers.

The producers apparently weren't happy that she'd been pictured spending time with intruder Bec.

A Channel 10 spokesperson denied this, however, telling Daily Mail Australia on Monday: 'This claim is completely false. Bella was given all her cocktail party photos.'

The Bachelor continues on Wednesday from 7:30pm on Channel 10
