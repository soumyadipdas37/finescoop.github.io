She has reportedly caught the eye of one of Hollywood's hottest and well-known actors, Zac Efron.

And it isn't difficult to see why the former High School Musical star, 32, appears to be infatuated with Australian beauty Vanessa Valladares - who was working as a waitress at her local cafe until her rumoured romance with Zac came to light.

Despite her previous foray into hospitality, it appears the 25-year-old's true passion lies within modelling, which is evident in the professional pictures uploaded to her Instagram platform.

Stunning snaps lining her Instagram account show the brunette beauty partaking in a series of photo-shoots for local Australian clothing brands.

Vanessa makes the most of her statuesque figure and stunning good looks as she works her angles in the sizzling snaps.

Currently sporting shorter curlier locks over her longer tresses, she has also proven that she's not shy of switching up and experimenting with her look.

Vanessa has also shown herself to be quite the water baby thanks to her slew of bikini-clad snaps at the beach.

With her sun-worshipping lifestyle, Vanessa will undoubtedly enjoy the beachy way of life Los Angeles has to offer if she plans on joining her rumoured beau Zac there once COVID-19 travel restrictions are lifted.

The practice of spirituality also appears to be an extension of Vanessa's happy and relaxed way of living.

She regularly shares spiritual quotes under her social media pictures and often practises gratitude.

In pictures dating back to 2015, the budding model is also quite the jet setter thanks to bucket list trips to the likes of India and Indonesia.

Vanessa was working at the Byron Bay General Store café, presumably to make extra cash in light of the CVOID-19 pandemic, when she met Hollywood star Zac.

She's rumoured to have quit her job now and is said to be staying with Zac at Belongil Beach. The pair have even enjoyed a ski trip in Thredbo together.

Last month, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles.

'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source revealed. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.'

Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months ago in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.

But it seems his request to have his tourist visa extended from three months to 12 months was granted, hence why he cancelled his trip home.

Daily Mail Australia understands Zac received a last-minute refund for his ticket.
