For most homeowners hoping to sell a property, the polish comes out in a bid to get the place in tip top condition ready for potential buyers. 

However, this selection of bizarre real estate agent photos, shared to Reddit and Powersiteblog, prove that some people still have quite a lot to learn - so it's no surprise their listings are still on the market. 

Amongst the amusing images, which have been taken all over the globe, includes a homeowner who superimposed a flower pot on the kitchen worktop to make it look more homely, and a garden which features grass far too green and pristine. 

Elsewhere, another person posted an advert to try and entice someone to rent a bedroom in his family home - with rules including 'no laundry' and 'no cooking.'

There's no denying a pot of flowers would brighten up any home - but it doesn't have the same appeal when it's Photoshopped onto the picture.  Pictured, in an unknown location

One person, from an unknown location, stumbled upon this 'spot the difference' snap, before asking: 'Can real estate agents catfish you?'

While many spend thousands furnishing their homes to impress potential buyers, one person, from an unknown location, had a very different idea instead

it's supposed to be the size of the rooms and features of the building that garner appeal, but this homeowner, from an unknown location, decided to use a different technique in the form of fancy dress 

This homeowner, from an unknown location, made no efforts to have a quick tidy up before taken a series of snaps
