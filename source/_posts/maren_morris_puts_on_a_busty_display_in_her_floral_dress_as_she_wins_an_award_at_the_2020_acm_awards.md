Maren Morris was off to a strong start at the 2020 Academy of Country Music on Wednesday after she'd already won an early award for her Miranda Lambert collaboration Fooled Around And Fell In Love.

The 30-year-old country singer lit up the ACM Awards red carpet in Nashville with a summery dress decorated with colorful floral designs.

The songstress looked to be in high spirits after admitting earlier this week that she suffered postpartum depression following the birth of her son in March.

Maren flaunted her curves in her low-cut, long-sleeve dress, which featured bursts of fiery orange and deep crimson.

The outfit was decorated with palm fronds and other tropical plants. 

The Middle singer kept all eyes on her with a pair of neon orange open-toe heels that were strapped around her ankles.

 She had her brunette locks swept back and framing her twisted gold hoop earrings.

The latest: Maren says she's through the worst of her battle with postpartum depression, five months after giving birth to her son Hayes Andrew. She appeared Monday on CBS This Morning

On Monday, the singer appeared on CBS This Morning and opened up about her struggle with postpartum depression following the birth of her son.

The Grammy-winning artist, who welcomed son Hayes Andrew March 23 with husband Ryan Hurd, said that she was flanked by a strong support system and received mental health services amid the difficult time, which coincided with the early days of the coronavirus pandemic shutdown.  

'Fortunately, I was able to do phone therapy during the pandemic,' the country music artist said, adding that she was surrounded by 'people that love [her] around [her] that are like, "Hey, if you're drowning right now, there's help."'

The My Church artist explained the turmoil she experienced at the time, saying, 'You're trying to become a new mother and good parent and do everything right and you just feel like you suck at every level.

'And then the one thing I've always felt like I have a handle on is my music. And to not be able to tour and have to furlough my band and crew, it was just a lot.'

Morris underwent 30 hours of labor and doctors had to perform a cesarean section in welcoming the child.
