 This the moment a Co-op shopper becomes furious and starts smashing wine bottles and throwing items in the store aisles after being told to observe social distancing rules.   

The footage shows the woman yelling and knocking wine bottles off the shelves, when staff at the shop in Lingfield, Surrey, asked her to follow the one-way system. 

The angry shopper then exits the store, leaving behind her a trail of glass and wine all over the floor. 

The outburst that was captured on CCTV took place in May. 

A staff member who wishes to remain anonymous described to Metro how the angry shopper started screaming at her and other workers. 

She said: 'She got very angry and started shouting at me and my colleague who were serving customers from behind the protective till screen.

'She stormed up to the till screen and just flipped out, punching and kicking it before rushing over to the alcohol aisle where she started grabbing bottles of wine, sending them smashing them to the ground.

 The CEOs of 23 retailers co-signed a letter to Boris Johnson asking for legal protection for shop workers who face violence and aggression from customers.  

  Alex Norris MP is due to get a second reading of his private members bill 'Assaults on Retail Workers ' this Friday, 25th September. 

 In the letter, it's stated : 'In partnership with our colleagues on the front-line, with USDAW and with a cross-party coalition of MPs, we support Alex Norris' Private Members Bill to provide that greater protection for our colleagues.

'This united response from business leaders, trade unions and frontline workers should demonstrate the need for these additional protections. We believe there is a clear and broad-based consensus behind this Bill, and we ask that the Government acts now to support this important Bill and find time for it to pass through Parliament.'

 Jo Whitfield, CEO, Co-op Food,  said: 'Our nation's shop workers are heroes and as important key workers they have played a vital role in providing communities across the country with access to food, household goods, financial services, prescriptions and medication all the way through lockdown. It is simply not part of their job to face a torrent of verbal or physical abuse and we want the Government to do their bit in introducing legislation that will make shop workers feel safer when they go to work.'
