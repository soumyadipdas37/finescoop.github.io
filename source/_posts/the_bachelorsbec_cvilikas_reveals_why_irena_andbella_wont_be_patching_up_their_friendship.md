Jealousy and competition for Locky Gilbert quickly turned friends Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska into enemies on this season of The Bachelor. 

And on Thursday, evicted intruder Bec Cvilikas weighed in on the feud that divided the mansion.

Speaking on the Kyle and Jackie O Show, Bec revealed Bella, 25, and Irena, 31, have still not patched up their friendship, despite filming the show months ago.

'They don't talk, they definitely don't talk,' she said, when was asked if there was still bad blood between the two.

'There's no like full on bad blood, they're not b**ching about each other,' she continued. 

'I don't think anything will ever be patched up to be honest. Everything is too far gone with them.'

Bec also told the KIIS 106.5 radio hosts Bella, 25, wasn't happy with how she was portrayed on the show.

'She's been pretty upset to be honest. It's not nice when people have been making up such insane rumours about her.'

'The way Bella has been portrayed, there are missing pieces. She's not a villain or a bad guy,' Bec added.

When asked if there was a side to Irena audiences didn't see, Bec explained: 'There's no good and bad guy in this whole situation.'

'I think maybe people saw Bella as the Disney princess at the beginning and jealousy plays a massive part of this show this sometimes, and this was their way of tearing her down.'   

Bella and Irena's feud began shortly after the contestants returned to the mansion after three and a half months of lockdown.

On-site production of The Bachelor was suspended from mid-March until the first week of July, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

During the first post-lockdown cocktail party, a furious Bella, 25, accused Irena, 31, of lying about the extent of her contact with Locky during self-isolation and called her a 'manipulative little b***h'.

The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10
