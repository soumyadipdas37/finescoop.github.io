A former Premier League player accused of carrying out a £5.3m investment fraud will be tried in one of London’s new Nightingale courts.

Ex Charlton Athletic defender, Richard Rufus, 45, allegedly enticed investors into a massive foreign currency scam between 2007 and April 2012

Prosecutors claim money was not invested and was spent on ‘personal expenses and lifestyle.’

Richard Rufus, pictured arriving at an earlier hearing at Southwark Crown Court last year has been told he will be tried in a new Nightingale Court in March 2021. He has been charged with foreign exchange fraud

Rufus has been told his three-week case has been listed for the Prospero House nightingale Court in Southwark, pictured

The former player, pictured left, was forced to retire from football in 2004 after suffering a career-ending injury

Rufus, who is out on bail, did not appear in a brief video-link hearing at Southwark Crown Court to set his trial date.

Judge Deborah Taylor sent him for a three-week trial in March next year at Prospero House, one of the new Nightingale courts.

After retiring from professional football in 2004 due to injury, Rufus turned to work in the financial sector.

When he was 29, he underwent an operation on his knee in the United States, but it was not successful.

Rufus, of Crystal Palace, southeast London, denies three counts of fraud by false representation, possessing criminal property and of carrying out a regulated activity when not authorised.
