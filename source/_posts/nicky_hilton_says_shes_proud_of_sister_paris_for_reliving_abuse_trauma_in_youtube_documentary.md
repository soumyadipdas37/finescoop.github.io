She's been doing the rounds during a scaled back New York Fashion Week.

But socialite Nicky Hilton put fashion to one side to comment on her older sister Paris' new YouTube documentary in an interview with E! News Wednesday.  

'It was very, very emotional,' Nicky, 36, said of watching This Is Paris for the first time.

Shared her feelings: Nicky Hilton, pictured at a NYFW event Wednesday, told E! News it had been 'very, very emotional' to watch older sister Paris' YouTube documentary This Is Paris 

Nicky said she watched the documentary with sister Paris, 39, who for the first time talks in the film about abuse she suffered while at boarding school in Utah.

'We watched it together. We laughed. We cried. I'm just so proud of her, because going through so much trauma and reliving it with the whole world watching is very brave,' she told E!

Nicky, who is married to banker James Rothschild with whom she shares two daughters, revealed that Paris hadn't wanted to screen it for their mom Kathy Hilton. 

'She said, 'I don't want mom to see it.' I was like, 'Well she's going to see it in a few weeks when it's on YouTube for the whole world to see,'' Nicky shared.

In This Is Paris, Paris recounts how her parents had her taken by two men from her bedroom and sent off to a camp for troubled youth when she was 16.

She says she ran away from several camps before landing at Provo Canyon School in Utah where she claims she was beaten, drugged and sent to solitary confinement. She was there for 11 months, only leaving when she turned 18.

In the film, Paris is seen talking about that time with Nicky and Nicky reminds her that she did a lot of 'naughty' things in New York Cityv when she was 16 that led to the action taken by their parents. 

Nicky did not say what the naughty things were but she asks her sister if she ever apologized to their parents for her actions.

Paris does admit during the documentary that she constantly partied at nightclubs using her fake ID and she also cut school. 

Paris is seen reliving the nightmare that was Provo and often cries in the docu as her painful experiences have given her PTSD resulting in regular nightmares which has led to crippling insomnia.

In the spotlight: Paris hosted an outdoor screening of the documentary in LA on Monday night and has revealed she has PTSD stemming from the abuse she suffered as a teen
