Footy fans have slammed Essendon players after seeing them laughing together despite being down by 59 points in a must-win match.

The Bombers were playing to secure a spot in the finals but at halftime on Sunday they were already down by ten goals against the Geelong Cats, in Brisbane. 

During the team huddle cameras captured the Essendon players laughing and joking together, which infuriated fans and former players. 

Former AFL great Shane Crawford wondered how supporters of the club felt after seeing their team laughing while so far behind their opponents.

'Imagine throwing that picture out to Instagram or Twitter and asking all the supporters 'What is going on?' he told the Wide World of Sports' Full Time.

'The thing that I don't like when sides lose, especially in really important games, you see players with big smiles on their faces interacting with opposition players.'

The former Hawthorne captain said having a bit of fun was one thing but when a team is vying for a finals spot fans expected more intensity.

After the game, which saw Geelong destroy Essendon 108 points to 42, fans savaged their team on social media.

'That's absolutely piss poor! As an Essendon supporter I'm bloody angry,' one man wrote to Twitter. 

'God we are now officially rabble at the moment! Laughing and joking among themselves and the opposition while we're getting beaten by 10 or more goals!' another fan added. 

'Didn't Essendon play better in the 3rd quarter, maybe they needed the joke before the first bounce,' a third fan quipped.

Former Essendon great Matthew Lloyd also took aim at his old club saying it had become 'the laughing stock' of the competition. 

'The Bombers have got no respect in this competition anymore, and that hurts me to say that ... from where my heart is as an Essendon person,' he told AFL.com.au. 

'We used to have a great identity at that club, and that all has been lost.

'So it's time they get their act together both on and off the field to try to right the wrongs, because it's becoming really tiresome.'

However not everyone was angry, some fans took to social media to defend their team's actions. 

'That’s it, the world has officially gone mad. How dare they laugh at themselves,' one Facebook user wrote.

'Sometimes to break the feeling of despair is to make a joke.. laughter changes the way a person thinks and feels,' a second user replied. 

'Oh my God .... that is appalling. Trying to put some positivity in their heads. Disgraceful behaviour,' another fan added.
