They recently announced they are set to welcome their second child later this year.

'I don't know if this is wishful thinking, but there's lots of kicks right now, so for me I'm like alright we have a little soccer player, rugby player' Matty J said. 

'I would love a little boy,' he added. 

Meanwhile, Laura stayed mum during the discussion, making sure not to reveal whether or not she knew what gender their soon-to-be bundle of joy was. 

Elsewhere in the interview, Matty spoke about the signs that made him guess that Laura was pregnant.

'There were so many obvious signs. You were sick in the morning, you were a little bit tired all the time, you stopped drinking wine at night,' he said. 

Laura admitted she was crazy hormonal and 'angry' about everything, which she believed 'gave it away' a bit. 

Laura confirmed that while the new baby is a 'lockdown baby', it was a planned pregnancy. 

'It's a covid baby but a very planned covid baby. It coincided at the same time,' she exclaimed.

'Marlie-Mae learning shocked face couldn't have been timed any better.. WE'RE HAVING A BABY!' Matty wrote alongside a family photo on Instagram.

'Please brace yourself for twice the amount of dad jokes,' he added.

'I reckon we've kept this little beach ball under wraps for long enough..... Halfway to number 2,' Laura wrote in a separate post, shared to her own account.  

'A big shout out to @matthewdavidjohnson for his contribution,' she cheekily added.

'You’re hands down my favourite Bachelor, I love you forever and our little family.'
