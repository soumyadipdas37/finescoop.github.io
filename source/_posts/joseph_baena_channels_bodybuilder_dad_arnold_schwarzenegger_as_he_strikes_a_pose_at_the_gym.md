He's the son of the most famous bodybuilder of all time.

And Joseph Baena made the most of those good genes on Wednesday, when the 22-year-old flexed up a storm at the gym.

The offspring of Arnold Schwarzenegger shared the images to Instagram for the benefit of his more than 211,000 followers.

In one flex pose, Baena looked strikingly similar to his father from photos taken over 50 years earlier.

Joseph also shared a video to his Instagram Stories labelled 'BACK DAY,' in which he performed the classic bent over row lift.

The exercise does indeed target a variety of back muscles.

Baena often likes to showoff a few flexing moves that his father made famous as a world champion bodybuilder beginning in the 1960s.

Schwarzenegger is still considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding.

Baena's mother, Mildred Baena, was the Schwarzenegger family's housekeeper when she had an affair with the Terminator star.

At the time he was married to Maria Shriver, the journalist who mothered of all his other children - Katherine, 30, Christina, 29, Patrick, 26, and Christopher, 22.

The actor hid the fact that he was Joe's father for 15 years. Mildred Baena had claimed the boy was the son of her now-ex-husband Rogelio Baena until 2011.

Schwarzenegger and Shriver separated in 2011 after the Los Angeles Times revealed he had an affair and fathered his youngest son more than 14 years earlier.
