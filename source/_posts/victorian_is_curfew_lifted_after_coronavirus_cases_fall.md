Melbourne's 9pm curfew will finally be lifted after the state recorded just 16 new cases on Sunday. 

Victoria also suffered another two deaths in the 24 hours to Sunday morning, taking its total to 784.

The number of new cases and deaths is up from Saturday's total of 14 cases and one death.

The two-week rolling daily case average of 23.6 is well under the 30-50 case average health authorities were aiming for. 

Meanwhile, no new coronavirus infections were detected in NSW on Sunday, the first zero-cases day in almost four months.

The state has in the past week recorded several days of no new local cases, but this is the first day where there were also none in hotel quarantine.

The last time zero cases of any kind were reported in NSW was June 10, before infected Victorians caused an outbreak in Sydney.

There are still 90 active cases in NSW, nine of whom are in hospital and three in intensive care.

Just 18 cases were detected over the past week, only one of which was from an unknown source.

The tiny number of new cases in recent weeks led to South Australia opening its border to NSW and increases pressure on Queensland to follow suit.

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, facing an election next month, is stubbornly refusing to open the NSW border.

She demands there be no community transmission for 14 days in a row, despite there being almost none for weeks.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian continues to reap the benefits of nipping an outbreak in Sydney in the bud with no new cases on Sunday

NSW Health official Christine Selvey urged residents with any symptoms to keep getting tested despite there being so few cases.

'We continue to ask people to remain vigilant and come forward for testing immediately if symptoms such as a runny nose, scratchy throat, cough or fever appear,' she said.

'This is particularly important with the start of the school holidays and increased movement of people around the state.'
