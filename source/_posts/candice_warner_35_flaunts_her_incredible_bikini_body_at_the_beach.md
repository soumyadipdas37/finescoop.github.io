She's set to star in the new TV series SAS Australia, which was recently filmed in the NSW Snowy Mountains and will air on Channel Seven next month.

And it seems the gruelling challenges and training sessions have done wonders for Candice Warner's already phenomenal physique.

The 35-year-old looked nothing short of sensational as she went for a swim in Sydney's Maroubra Beach on Tuesday while sporting a skimpy orange bikini.

Candice, who is the wife of cricketer David Warner, appeared to be rocking the natural look as she sauntered out of the ocean makeup free.

The mother of three raised a smile as she soaked up the sunshine, letting her wet hair gently cascade down her back to dry in the breeze.
