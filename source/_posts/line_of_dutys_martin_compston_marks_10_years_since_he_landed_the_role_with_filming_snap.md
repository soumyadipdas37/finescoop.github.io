He's been back to work on series six, after production was delayed by COVID-19. 

Line Of Duty star Martin Compston marked a decade since he landed the role of DS Steve Arnott with a fun behind the scenes snap on Thursday.

The actor shared the image alongside co-stars Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar with the caption: '10 years later...' as he prepared to film another of the show's iconic interrogation scenes.

Line Of Duty's first series aired on BBC Two in March 2012, although it's likely Martin would have landed the role many months earlier.

His snap proved the cast have barely changed despite years battling 'bent coppers' in the fictional AC-12. 

Martin shared the snap after filming for series six resumed in early September in Belfast, with showrunner Jed Mercurio admitting he's still hopeful the show will return to screens in 2021.

In a recent photo from the set, Martin posed as his character DS Steve Arnott while sitting behind a glass wall, which appeared to be in a prison. 

Martin also posted the picture to his own Instagram where he captioned it with: 'Officially back in business #waistcoatup #lineofduty6.' 

The actor also posted a fun snap of himself getting his longer locks, which he grew during lockdown, cut by hair stylist Cat Coogan.

The star also posted up a picture of himself in police uniform teasing fans: 'In The civvies, must be Line of Duty 6.' 

Vicky McClure took to Instagram to post a picture of herself with Martin at a distance, which she captioned: 'Hello mate'

Series regulars, Martin, Vicky McClure (DI Kate Fleming) and Adrian Dunbar (Superintendent Ted Hastings), also issued statements about their return to filming.

Martin, 36, said: 'It's been a long few months and it will be a different way of working from when we stopped, but I'm delighted to be back on the case with the Line of Duty team!' 

Vicky, 37, added: 'Been sitting on these incredible scripts for some time now, so I'm really looking forward to getting back to it and seeing the Line of Duty family.'

Executive Producer for World Productions, Simon Heath, said: 'It's been almost six months since we stopped shooting.

'But following our implementation of all the industry Covid protocols, we're delighted to be able to resume filming series six safely.'
