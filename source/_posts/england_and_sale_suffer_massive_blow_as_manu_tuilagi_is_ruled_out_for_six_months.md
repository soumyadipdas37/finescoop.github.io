Sale and England have suffered a major blow after Manu Tuilagi was ruled out for six months with a torn Achilles.

The centre suffered the injury during Tuesday’s victory over Northampton and will undergo surgery next week.

The powerhouse is going to be sidelined for England's final Six Nations clash against Italy, which was postponed by the coronavirus crisis, and all of the autumn internationals that follow. He is also expected to miss next year's Six Nations competition.
