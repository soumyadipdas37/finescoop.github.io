It's fair to say 2020 has been memorable for all the wrong reasons, but on Thursday night a tiny team from the Faroe Islands can secure a success the likes of which the country has never seen before.

Meet Klaksvik, a side made up of part-time carpenters, painters and accountants, who are just 90 minutes away from reaching the group stages of this season's Europa League.

Irish side Dundalk are all that stands in their way as they bid to become the first ever Faroese side to reach the heady heights of group-stage European football.

Klaksvik is a tiny fishing town in the Faroe Islands but their football team have been impressive

After being forced to play their home qualifying matches away from their tiny 2,600-capacity stadium, Klaksvik are already in uncharted territory but can go one step further should they get through their tough test on Thursday night.

Klaksvik is a tiny fishing village on the Faroe Islands, and their team became national champions for the first time in 20 years in 2019. That gave them a shot at Europe, first of all in the Champions League qualifying rounds.

Incredibly, they drew Slavan Bratislava and received a bye to the next round after the heavily-fancied Slovakian side endured a spate of Covid-19 infections.

Onto the next round, they were beaten by Young Boys, a side with huge European pedigree, dropping them down to the Europa League - where they were still massive underdogs to get past the next hurdle.

They faced Georgian champions Dinamo Tbilisi last Thursday looking to secure a play-off spot, and incredibly flew through 6-1 against a side few expected them to beat.

More than half of the Klaksvik squad work jobs alongside their footballing careers, with one player recently finishing his apprenticeship as an electrician.

As reported by the BBC, Jacobsen works in the nearby fishing factory, while there are students, accountants and painters littered throughout the squad.

After their near-miraculous home victory over Tblisi last week, they are now in Ireland to face Dundalk, a side who have previously got through to the group stages. 

'This is the biggest game in our history, by far,' Sigurjon Einarsson, an editor at the dimma.fo website, told the BBC. 'It's the first time our team has had a chance to get into the group stage of the Europa League. A team from the Faroe Islands - I never thought I would see that happening, not in my wildest dreams.' 

This is a team that trains at 5pm daily to ensure that their squad can work their normal jobs before turning their attentions to football.

They have an annual budget of just £1million, a figure dwarfed by every other team in the European competition. 

The team have been forced to play their home European qualifiers away from their own ground

Their home stadium has just 530 seats, and they have been forced to play their home European qualifiers at the country's national stadium due to their own home not meeting UEFA's criteria. 

If they are to get through tonight, Klaksvik could potentially come up against the likes of Arsenal, Tottenham, Celtic, Leicester and Rangers, a vision that seemed impossible just 11 years ago when they were relegated to the second tier of the Faroe Islands' national league. 

Now, though, in 2020, they are firmly looking up.

'We are like a family,' Jakup Biskopsto Andreasen, their 22-year-old captain, said. 'All the players from Klaksvik have a really good connection and we are close friends.' 

Manager Mikkjal Thomassen is hoping to go where no previous Klaksvik team have been

It is a football-mad island, and the whole community are said to rally together to get behind the team. Last season, for their title decider against B36, it was reported that 70 per cent of the town's population travelled to Torshavn to watch the match. 

'You meet people on the street everywhere, when you go for a walk, and everyone is talking about football,' adds Andreasen. 'People here are very excited about seeing their team making an effort to get into the group stage. 

'It would be an amazing achievement for us to get to the group stage - maybe we can bring Faroese club football onto the world map.

'We are not there yet, but we will go after our chance. It is quite unrealistic when you think about a Faroese team in the group stage. It would be a fulfilled dream for us.'
