Sony announced pricing and release dates for its PlayStation 5 Wednesday and retailers opened pre-orders of the console one day earlier than expected – creating a buying frenzy among the gaming community.

Gamers around the world ran to their computers, smartphones and tablets to reserve a console, but many were met with broken links, page time outs and the dreaded ‘out of stock’ message.

Major retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop and Walmart were all sold out within hours, some even in minutes.

The PlayStation 5 was not the only technology up for grabs, as Nivida’s new RTX 3080 graphics card went on sale Thursday, but was also sold out in minutes.

Many gamers flocked to Twitter to share their frustrations, with some saying the technologies were mostly bought up by bots or people looking to flip the console for more than what it costs.

PlayStation 5 pre-orders were not set to open until Thursday, September 17, as the gaming system shared a tweet shortly after the event: ‘PS5 pre-orders will be available starting as early as tomorrow at select retailers.’

However, many retailers seemed to jump the gun and offer the gaming console earlier- even without having any physical systems.

GameStop shared a news release stating it was now taking pre-orders for the PS5 Wednesday evening and quickly ran out of stock.

Jason Celso was also unable to secure the gaming console, but is hopefully to have better luck pre-ordering the Xbox Series X

However, it seems those who beat the rush and pre-ordered a PS5 are already trying to ‘flip them on Amazon and Ebay’ for a higher cost
