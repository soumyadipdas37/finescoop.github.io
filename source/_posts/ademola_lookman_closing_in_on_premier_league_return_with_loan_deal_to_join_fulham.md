Fulham are on the verge of confirming the loan signing of Ademola Lookman from RB Leipzig.

Lookman will join the Cottagers on an initial loan deal for a fee of around £2million in a switch that is set to be wrapped up in the next 24 hours.

The move will see Lookman return to the Premier League following his £22.5m move to Germany from Everton last summer.

The Bundesliga side snapped up the 22 year-old, who started his career at Charlton, after a previous successful loan spell at Leipzig.

But his second stint has not gone to plan with Lookman starting just once in the league last season.

Fulham have lost all three of their league games this season since their return to the Premier League.

Mario Lemina also joined the club on a temporary deal leaving Southampton in a loan move 

They have strengthened their goalkeeping department with the addition of Alphonse Areola, their full-backs by bringing in Antonee Robinson, Kenny Tete and Ola Aina and in central midfield with Mario Lemina. Harrison Reed and Anthony Knockaert also had their loan moves made permanent.

And vice chairman Tony Khan confirmed they are determined to continue strengthening, particularly in defence, after their humbling 3-0 home defeat to Aston Villa on Monday.

He said: 'I apologize to Fulham supporters for our performance tonight. We've looked to add centre-backs since Wembley. 

'I'm sorry we haven't yet as two got Covid and we lost a free we thought was close and had another issue with a fourth centre-back. 

'I promise players in and better efforts from this squad.'

The 3-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa caused Tony Khan to issue an apology via social media

Khan continued to apologise and pledged that the playing squad would enhance their efforts
