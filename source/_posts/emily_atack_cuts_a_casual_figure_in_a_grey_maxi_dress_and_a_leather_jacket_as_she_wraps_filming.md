She is the leading lady in The Emily Atack Show which airs later this autumn. 

And Emily Atack looked effortlessly stylish as she left filming for her new TV series at the Clapham Grand in south London on Thursday evening.  

The Inbetweeners star, 30, had been hard at work and looked stunning as she strutted out of the venue holding a well-deserved bottle of wine.

Emily has been hard at work filming all week. 

On Wednesday, she said: 'Show one is done, I'm home. I'm up so early tomorrow because I have to film two more shows tomorrow and then two more the next day. 

The actress gave an exaggerated yet comical sigh of exhaustion and added: 'No, [but] it's great, I'm having the best time, and thank you everybody for coming, it was a socially-distanced audience obvs.

'And to everybody that is just helping me make the sketch show that I wanted to make. I'm just so happy, my heart is full, and I'm going to bed, bye!'

Emily will also keep viewers entertained as she performs impressions of beloved celebrities such as Gemma Collins and Holly Willoughby. 

She discussed the new show with ITV and said: 'I am thrilled to be announcing this. I want to create and write a sketch show that gives snap shots into the weird and hilarious world of everyday life as a young (ish) person. 

'I can guarantee whatever age you are you will relate in some way! It’s a dream come true, since I was a child this is the kind of television I’ve wanted to make and be part of. I can’t quite believe it.' 

The new series features six 45-minute episodes and will hit small screens on ITV2 later this year.
