Atletico Madrid 'are close to signing Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira on a season-long loan' - but Thomas Partey isn't part of the negotiations.

The Uruguayan's game time became more limited once Mikel Arteta replaced Unai Emery as Gunners boss last season and he hasn't featured so far in this campaign.

But Atletico manager Diego Simeone admires the 24-year-old and is working on an arrangement to take him for the season.

Torreira is keen to join Atletico but, according to the Evening Standard, the deal hasn't yet been completed because Arsenal want to include an obligation to buy Torreira in any loan deal.

In addition, Atletico need to sell players to make room in their wage bill, which is holding up the move going through.

In a disappointment to Arsenal fans, Atletico want to keep midfield transfer target Partey and he isn't part of the negotiations for Torreira.

Torino have also tracked Torreira during this summer window but it appears Atletico are now favourites to win the race.

Arsenal paid £28million for Torreira when he joined from Italian club Sampdoria in 2018.

He played frequently under Emery during his first campaign at the Emirates Stadium but suffered an ankle injury in his second and was only used sparingly post-restart.

Arsenal have been linked with Ghanaian midfielder Partey for much of the summer but his £45m release clause has proved prohibitive.
