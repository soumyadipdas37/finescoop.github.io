Gemma Collins appeared to take a swipe at ex James 'Arg' Argent on Wednesday – by declaring she has never been in love with anyone she worked with.

The pair met and worked with each other on hit TV show TOWIE, going on to have a high profile on-off romance, which came to an unceremonious end earlier this year.

And during her new Gemma Collins Love Lounge podcast on the BBC, where the topic of discussion was love in the workplace on Wednesday, the 39-year-old TV personality was quite forthcoming on the matter.

She said: 'Personally I've never fallen in love with anyone in the workplace – I couldn't think of nothing worse. I went to work to work. I didn't go to work for love.

'Yeah, I mean, I don't put work and love in the love in the same category and yeah, I can honestly say I've never ever, I can honestly say, liked anyone – fancied anyone – that I worked with.

'But I'm quite proud of that fact but I do know friends that have fallen in love with people in the workplace.

'Some people who I used to work with did fall in love in the workplace and went on to get married, but they'd always be arguing at work and to be honest it was very problematic, and I think that's what put me off.

'But I have witnessed that. I do know of people, again, that are carrying on with people in the offices, I hear it all the time and it goes on, we can't deny it.

'I always say, what's meant for you won't pass you by, it's just that George Clooney hasn't realised that I'm the love of his life yet.'

Gemma's words come amid reports she has given a 'deeply personal' interview on Piers Morgan's Life Stories.

The former TOWIE star is said to have spent 'more than six hours' filming the show on Friday in an episode which will air later in the year.

She will reportedly discuss her 'toxic' on-off relationship with Arg on the show and some of her previous exes.

Gemma and James split for good in July after she posted break-up texts on her Instagram account in which he called her a 'hippo' and a 'fat f**k'.

The former couple had split in 2019 after Arg, who admitted he is a cocaine addict and overdosed twice last year, refused rehab yet they reconciled weeks later.

They got back together late last year after jetting off on holiday to Dubai in a final bid to resolve their issues.

Gemma originally dumped Arg after he refused rehab and said their relationship was over until he beat his addiction once and for all.

But less than three weeks later, MailOnline exclusively revealed the reality TV pair were spotted holding hands and kissing on a romantic trip to the £250-a-night Palazzo Versace Hotel.

The duo briefly dated in 2012, before embarking on a tumultuous love story, which of it documented on TOWIE, from December 2017.

Meanwhile, it was recently revealed that Gemma has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by two YouTube pranksters, who have started up The Romford Research Institute For Peace to make themselves qualify to have the power to nominate.  

Company directors Josh Pieters and Archie Manners insist the reality personality has spent much of her life dedicated to finding peace, and even referenced her relationship with James Argent as a point of her peace-finding ability. 

The YouTube duo have hit headlines previously with such stunts as interviewing Carole Baskin and tricking Love Island's Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury into believing James Corden is interviewing them for America's The Late Late Show.

One of the criteria to have the ability to nominate an individual is to be a 'director of a peace research institute'. This is the category Josh and Archie fall under. 

Speaking to The Sun, the duo, both 27, said: 'The GC has spent 39 years promoting peace and harmony across Essex – and beyond. If you look at what peace really means, take for example her on-off relationship with James Argent – no one died....

'It was a conflict that did appear to be resolved peacefully and we at the Romford Research Institute think this is a great demonstration of world peace.'

Josh explained: 'We believe in the GC effect, which is a peer reviewed hypothesis that if Gemma spent a long weekend in North Korea she could use the skills as seen in Towie to attempt to bring peace to the region.'

Archie added: 'She is arguably more peaceful than Donald Trump. And it's the same with Kanye West. His nomination has been successful and he will be considered.' 

The duo's pranks have become prolific, with their Carole and Molly-Mae pranks following on from them luring Katie Hopkins abroad to be given a fake award which spelled out the words 'C**T'.

Trump's nomination has caused controversy after a Swedish legislator put the President's name forward for the 2021 awards. 

A legislator nominated Trump for his efforts in the Middle East and has said he received a phone call of thanks from the US president.

Magnus Jacobsson, a member of Sweden’s Parliament for the Christian Democrats, wrote on Twitter that he was 'on my way to the stable with my daughter' when he got the call.

'We had a good conversation about peace in the Middle East and the Balkans. I wish the President good luck with the peace processes,' Jacobsson wrote.

Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed last month to a deal normalising relations that was signed at the White House on September 15.

Earlier this month, Jacobsson also nominated the governments of the US, Kosovo and Serbia for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to secure a peace agreement between the two former Balkan war foes.
