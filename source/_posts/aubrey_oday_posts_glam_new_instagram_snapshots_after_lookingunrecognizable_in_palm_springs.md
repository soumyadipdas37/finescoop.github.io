Aubrey O'Day was recently pictured out in Palm Springs looking remarkably different than the ultra glam persona she often showcases on social media. 

But the 36-year-old Danity Kane alum was back to business as usual on Monday evening when she posted two stunning videos to her Instagram Story.

In the brief clips, O'Day had on a full face of makeup and her signature blonde tresses were styled in beach waves.

She put her ample chest on display in a black crop top that completely exposed one side of her bra. 

The singer did not say a word to the camera, instead, she pouted her lips and played with her freshly styled hair.

She also playfully stuck out her tongue just before the clip came to a close

In a note layered over top her video, Aubrey informed her nearly 1million followers that she was jamming to music, while 'redesigning [her] glam room.'

She returned to her Story to post a video of her showing off her curvaceous frame in her bathroom mirror.

The mirror clip allowed Aubrey to showcase her figure flattering high waisted trousers that she paired with her chic crop top. 

The Instagram star applied a quirky bunny rabbit themed filter to her video.

On Sunday, Aubrey relied solely on her natural beauty as she took her two dogs for a walk and picked up some food to-go in Palm Springs. 

The sighting came just a week after she posted an advertisement for the Flat Tummy App on her Instagram account that showed her in a revealing swimsuit, though it appears to have been heavily airbrushed.  

'Can't wait to see the progress as I continue the workouts,' Aubrey captioned the snap from August 20, which she posted to her 936,000 followers.

She added: 'Nothing beats a poolside workout, and with my new @flattummyapp I can do my workout anywhere, anytime.' 

What was recognizable about the 5′ 4″ star's appearance was her tattoos. Aubrey has previously shown off her bar code neck tattoo, and Latin scripture ink on her torso.

The Latin slogan emblazoned on her side reads: 'Per aspera ad astra,' loosely translated as 'through hardships to the stars.'

The star - who has appeared in both Celebrity Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother - has posted a series of bikini shots on social media over the last few months, though it is not clear when the pictures were taken. 

On July 15, she posted a string of bikini shots, wearing Rihanna's Savage X Fenty line and made sure to tag the brand in her post. 

Aubrey is still an active member of the band Danity Kane, which now appears to be a duo, having reunited for a second time as a trio in 2018.

Along with singer Dawn Richard, the pair released the electronic single New Kings earlier this year in March. 

She has also been posting videos of fans dancing to their new music on her Instagram account. 

Last week, Aubrey posted a tribute to her beloved pooches on Twitter for National Dog Day, showing off their multicolored fur. 

Fans have speculated about her changing looks over the years, but in an interview Aubrey admitted that she knows 'all the tricks' when it comes to making your appearance seem different. 

'I've had lip fillers and Botox. I put a lot of filters,' she told UsWeekly just last year, adding: 'I know all the tricks and I use them.'

However, she denied rumors that she's had extensive plastic surgery done.  

The reality star allegedly had an affair with Donald Trump Jr. in 2012, while he was married to his wife Vanessa Trump.

The pair met while on the set of season 5 of the Celebrity Apprentice back in 2011.

Aubrey publicly called Donald Jr. her 'ex' for the first time during the season premiere of MTV's Ex on the Beach, last year, before also calling him her 'soulmate.' 

She also split from Jersey Shore's Paul 'DJ Pauly D' DelVecchio in July 2017, and it is not clear if she is currently dating.  

As well as her singing and TV career, the star made a name for herself opting for daring red carpet ensembles, often wearing very little while turning up to events.
