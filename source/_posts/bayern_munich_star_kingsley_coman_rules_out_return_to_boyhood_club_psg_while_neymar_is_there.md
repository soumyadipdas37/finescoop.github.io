Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman has ruled out a return to his boyhood club Paris-Saint Germain days after scoring the winner in the Champions League final against them.

Coman, who came through the youth ranks and broke into senior football with PSG, has admitted that Neymar's presence at the club would mean he would not return to Parc des Princes.

The Frenchman ended up being the hero for Bayern as he headed in the only goal of the final to sink his former club in the biggest game in world football.

Coman admitted that he felt 'sick' after scoring such an important goal against his 'favourite club', but basked in the glory of Bayern's triumph at the end of a mightily impressive season.

Despite his love for the French champions, he has ruled out a return this summer.Â 

'It's complicated. If Neymar is on the left. No, it's almost impossible. Paris is not in my career plans,' he told Telefoot.

'I have maybe eight to 10 years at a high level, so we can't close the door. In my head, there are memories of childhood. There is a little less good, but I kept the good memories of my time at PSG.'

He added: 'PSG will always be my favourite club. But, for me, it was the right decision to leave and maybe if I hadn't left I might not have won this Champions League.

'I didn't make an easy choice, but I always thought that, with my qualities, I could play for a big club.'
