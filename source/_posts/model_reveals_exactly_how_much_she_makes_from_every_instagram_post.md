Two glamorous Instagram influencers have revealed how much money they earn from each post - and have shared tips on how you can get paid on social media app. 

Models Olivia Evi Plant, 18, and Gina Vuletich, 30, are represented by Market Vogue - a Sydney-based creative digital agency for influencing, modelling, and casting.

The blonde-bombshells have thousands of followers each on their Instagram profiles but have completely different stories of success. 

Ms Plant's social media career began when she was still in high school, with the Gold Coast local earning almost $30,000 in Year 12 last year - while Ms Vuletich balanced her growing online profile with full time work.

But Ms Plant's hard work almost went down the drain when her Instagram account - which had more than 100,000 followers - was deleted for violating community guidelines.  

'Six years of hard work was gone. I had over 100k followers and one day I was just scrolling on Instagram and it said I got logged out,' she said.

'I tried logging back in and they said I violated the guidelines even though I didn't do anything wrong.'

The 18-year-old is currently rebuilding her Instagram platform and has about 9,000 followers.

Ms Plant said she would make a few thousand dollars for her Instagram posts.

'Every person is different. Like definitely with people with over 500k on Instagram get like 15k per post, up to 20k,' she said. 

'It really depends on how many followers you have or how good your engagement is.'

Ms Vuletich, who has Croatian heritage, built her social media presence on the side while working full time

Despite the bad luck, the teenager hsa found success on video-sharing app TikTok after a dancing video with her mum went viral. 

The snippet was viewed 40 million times and gathered more than two million likes.

'There was one viral video that blew up overnight and I kept trying make videos like that and they all just kept blowing up I didn't really know what was going on but it was cool,' she said.

She now has 1.3million followers on TikTok. 

Ms Vuletich, who has Croatian heritage, built her social media presence on the side while working full time. 

She moved to Australia from New Zealand nine years ago and began influencing in 2015.

'Started out getting free products, fake tan, skin care. Then as I grew bigger and bigger that's when I started putting a price tag on things,' she said. 

The 30-year-old said modelling is a great way to get your foot in the door as an Instagram influencer.

'I had my full-time job. I was an Executive assistant at the time, and I was probably modelling once a week,' she said.

'I was doing handbags seasonal, clothing, beauty you name it.' 

Ms Vuletich said she began to charge about $100 per Instagram post when she had between 8,000 and 10,000 followers. 

'They would say ''send us your offer and tell us how you'd promote our brand'',' Ms Vuletich said. 

'So I would say ''hey guys this skin care brand suits me as I love organic etc, I would love to showcase your product like this, and I would like to be paid $120 for one story and a post''.' 

Ms Vuletich said it took her five to six years to build her profile, describing it as a 'slow burn'. 

'Because I was working full time as a Finance Executive,' she explained. 

'I'm career focused so trying to focus on that as well as the social side of things can be full on.

'Some girls do like five to six posts per week where mine was two to three. And I think that has an effect.' 

Ms Vuletich said she makes about $30,000 a year from her side hustle.   

'Every six weeks I get $500 worth of hair from a sponsor which is my colour, cut, and toner,' she said.

'And then my extensions on top of that, and that's another $600 every six weeks so that's $1,100 almost every month for free on my hair alone. 

The influencer is now charging between $250 and $350 per post.

Both women heaped praise on their representation, Market Vogue, claiming the agency makes it easier to find work.

Ms Vuletich said she was initially worried about the agency taking a bigger cut of her earnings but she quickly realised how many extra job opportunities she received. 

'I would have never had that opportunity before,' she said, adding the agency is 'actively going out there looking for work for me'. 

'I'm too busy to do that, I have a full time job. I wouldn't have time to get that work.'

Mr Boyd said influencer marketing continued to prove successful for businesses because influeners have 'genuine relationships' with their audience and become trusted.

For those looking to break into influencing, Mr Boyd said it is important to be 'consistent' and 'patient'. 

'Nothing happens overnight,' he said.

'There is no secret to success on social media and there are no short cuts. 

'It has taken a few years for some our models to grow their accounts.'

Mr Boyd also spoke about the power of TikTok and its popularity with Generation Z.

'If TikTok isn't in your play book for advertising this year, I would recommend reviewing the numbers and consider how popular the app is,' he said.
