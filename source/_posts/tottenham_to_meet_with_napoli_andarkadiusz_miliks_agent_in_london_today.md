Tottenham are reportedly set to meet with Napoli and Arkadiusz Milik's agent in London today to negotiate a deal over the striker's potential transfer.

Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is desperate to bring in a striker in the closing stages of the summer transfer window to provide back-up for England international Harry Kane.

And according to Calciomercato, both Tottenham and Napoli - plus Milik's agent - will meet to try and thrash out a deal.

Napoli striker Arkadiusz Milik has reportedly emerged as a target for Tottenham this summer

The Poland striker appeared to be on his way to Roma this summer, signing on loan with an obligation to buy for £16.5m plus up to £6m in add-ons and bonuses.

However, that move collapsed after Milik took too long to come to an agreement over his departure from the Serie A outfit.

There are reportedly a number of issues that need to be resolved between the player and the club, regarding outstanding wages, fines and image rights. 

Reports suggest that if Tottenham were to launch an offer of £17.5m plus £6m in bonuses, then a deal could be struck this summer.

Milik joined Napoli back in 2016 from Dutch side Ajax, and has gone on to feature 122 times for the club - scoring 48 goals and providing five assists.
