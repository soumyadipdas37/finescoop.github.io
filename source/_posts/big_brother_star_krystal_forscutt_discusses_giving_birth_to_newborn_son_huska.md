Speaking of Neil, she wrote: 'I was so happy to have @futureflip by my side supporting me, I actually can't believe I let him come near me this time. I may have pushed his hand off my legs a couple of times though'.

Krystal went on to explain that giving birth to Huska resulted in a 'little bit of damage' as she had some 'internal bleeding'.

She said she was 'kept under observation for a few hours' before being cleared.

'Every ounce of pain couldn't be more worth it for the gift in the form of this beautiful little boy,' she gushed.
