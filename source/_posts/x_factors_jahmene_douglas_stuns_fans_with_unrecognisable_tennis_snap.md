He rose to fame on the ninth series of The X Factor in 2012. 

And Jahmene Douglas stunned fans as he uploaded a trendy tennis snap, with some saying he looked 'totally different' from his X Factor days on Twitter on Thursday. 

The singer, 29, looked casually cool in a green bomber jacket and white baseball cap, as he sported a beard and donned black aviators.

In another photo Jahmene showed off his curly hair and asked his followers if he should keep it or chop it off. 

Fans couldn't get over his handsome looks as one wrote: 'You look totally different! You look good either way tbh you do you'.

Another typed: 'Keep the hair it's amazing', a third chimed: 'Keep it, either way you look great. Hope you are well Jahmene.'

Back in 2017, Jahmene reflected on his 2012 stint on The X Factor, criticising the ITV talent show for not offering enough support during the contest and its aftermath.

The singer, who was runner-up to James Arthur- has openly discussed his ongoing battle with depression and explained the show didn't give the hopefuls the support they needed as they were catapulted into the spotlight. 

Speaking to the The Sun Online, Jahmene claimed there was no care given to any of his fellow acts as they came to terms with their newfound fame.

He told the publication: 'There’s no care for you, if you aren’t signed to Syco the show just doesn’t…there’s nothing for you after the show. 

'I came from witness protection to being watched by 15 million people a week, and there’s no one talking to you… there’s no therapist on the show, you’re just expected to cope.

Adding: 'I think it is a problem that needs to be discussed, the mental health of contestants after the show.' 

An X Factor spokesperson told MailOnline: 'The welfare of The X Factor contestants is of utmost importance to the show. Support, including a psychologist if required, is provided throughout the series.' 

Jahmene has since been working on his new EP Incomplete, which is released on October 2.
