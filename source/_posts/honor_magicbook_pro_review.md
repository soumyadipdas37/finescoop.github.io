Are you looking for the best laptop for gaming, video and photo editing, or for streaming movies and TV shows? If so, you might want to consider HONOR's latest offering.

Whether it's for professional use or for leisure, the high performance MagicBook Pro offers fast processing, impressive battery life, immersive audio and visual quality for a wide range of tasks and lifestyles.

The laptop is currently reduced from £1,019.97 down to £849.99. The brand is also treating its customers to a free HONOR MagicWatch 2 or HONOR Magic Buds and HONOR Router 3 with the purchase of the laptop.

The sleek MagicBook Pro boasts a lightweight and durable aluminium design, weighing just 1.7kg and 16.1 mm thick at its thickest point. It is available in a smart Space Grey colour.

There are multiple ports, including: one 3.5mm headphone jack and two USB 3.2 Gen 1 port on the right, plus one USB 3.2 Gen 1 port, one USB-C port and an HDMI port on the left.

Its narrow 4.8mm bezel is all thanks to the concealed display controller board. The webcam has also been moved from above the screen to under a key. While I'm not a fan of the unflattering camera angle (double chin alert) it does offer better security and means it is only visible when you need it.

Speaking of security, the laptop also features a finger print power button, meaning the only person getting access to your laptop is you.

The 2020 MagicBook Pro features a 6.1 inch HONOR FullView display with a 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, making it aesthetically beautiful. The laptop's aspect ratio is 16:9 aspect ratio and resolution is 1920 x 1080.

It features 100 per cent sRGB, offering HONOR's best colour display yet. The truest to life colours and flicker-free technology are designed to help creative workflow, meaning it is the perfect device for productivity, as well as editing photos and videos. The flicker-free display also helps to reduce blue light in darker environment, meaning less eye strain and fatigue.

Virtual surround speakers are perfect for using streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, as well as watching YouTube videos and playing online games. The laptop offers a truly immersive experience and decent sound quality.

The MagicBook Pro has up to 11 hours all-day battery life, and a super fast charge offering 50 per cent charge in the first 30 minutes. I could also play online games in their highest resolution for at least a few hours without having the laptop on charge.

Dual fan and dual heat pipes offer sustained performance and efficient thermal management, keeping the laptop cool even when you're streaming a high resolution game, movie or powerful software.

The new MagicBook Pro comes equipped with the all-new AMD Ryzen™ 5 4600H Processor to help improve battery life, as well as an ultra-fast 512GB SSD storage drive and up to 16gb DDR4 dual-channel RAM for faster gaming performance. 

Windows 10 is pre-installed, along with a one month trial of Office 365. It is a shame HONOR didn't pre-install Microsoft Office like they did with the MagicBook 14, especially when this is being described as a laptop 'for professionals'. 

Overall, HONOR has gone above and beyond with the 2020 MagicBook Pro and I am thoroughly impressed with its gaming, streaming performance. The narrow bezel and large screen is also absolutely fantastic. The attractive sleek design and bright screen is also a big pro.

I would have preferred a larger hard drive, purely to be able to store more games and large video files, so I will have to continue storing my video edits on an external hard drive.

In terms of value for money, I think the MagicBook Pro offers a great deal of premium features at a lower price point, making it accessible for young professionals and students.
