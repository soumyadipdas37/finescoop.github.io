Lady Gaga recently spilled her soul, opening up about her past struggles with suicidal thoughts during an intimate interview on CBS Sunday Morning this weekend.

After an emotional few days - which kicked off with the release of her new 911 music video on Friday - the native New Yorker was ready for a bit of pampering and self love.

Gaga, 34, put a casual twist on her typically wild style while heading to a Sephora on the Upper Westside with mom Cynthia on Sunday, rocking a pink sweat-set with a Matrix-chic patent leather jacket.

Providing maximum amounts of drama, Gaga - birth name Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta - let her shiny jacket sweep down to her equally edgy shoes.

She leveled up her petite 5foot2 form with a pair of platform boots which matched her jacket's slick appeal.

Her mom, who is president and co-founder of Gaga's Born This Way Foundation, went for a significantly more subdued look, opting for a simple track suit dressed up with a classic Gucci purse.

Though Gaga's face was hidden under a hoodie, sunglasses and a sparkling mask, the wild style and flowing aqua tresses made it hard for Gaga to fly under the radar.

The NYU alum recently revealed how dealing with fame pushed her into a dark place before she was able to channel the pain into the making her new album Chromatica.

Gaga explained how the pressure of the spotlight was so harsh that she began thinking about suicide almost daily, a confession she made to CBS's Lee Cowan on Sunday.

'I didn't really understand why I should live other than to be there for my family. That was an actual real thought and feeling: "Why should I stick around?"'

Laid back: Her mom, who is president and co-founder of Gaga's Born This Way Foundation, went for a significantly more subdued look, opting for a simple track suit dressed up with a classic Gucci purse

She added of her depression: 'It’s not always easy, if you have mental issues, to let other people see. I used to show. I used to self-harm. 

'I used to say, "Look. I cut myself. See, I’m hurt." Cause I didn’t think anyone could see. Cause mental health, it’s invisible.'

Gaga (whos also opened up about the mental trauma that comes with fame, while showing off her at-home recording studio.  

She said: 'This is the piano I've had for so many years. I've written so many songs on this piano. And I think, "Oh my gosh, it's so special, this piano, I love this piano." I don't know how to explain.

Inner pain: Gaga explained how the pressure of the spotlight was so harsh that she began thinking about suicide almost daily, a confession she made to CBS's Lee Cowan on Sunday

Suicidal thoughts: The 34-year-old said: 'I didn't really understand why I should live other than to be there for my family. That was an actual real thought and feeling: "Why should I stick around?"'

'I went from looking at this piano and thinking, "You ruined my life!" I was like, "You made me Lady Gaga. My biggest enemy is Lady Gaga!"'

The Born This Way artist continued: 'That's what I was thinking. My biggest enemy is here. "What did you do? You can't go to the grocery store now. If you go to dinner with your family, somebody comes to the table... It's always about you. And your outfits, look at your outfits! Why you gotta be like that?!"'

She also explained the lyrics to her song 911, for which she recently dropped the music video: '"Pop a 911," that's a reference to the medication that I have to take when I used to panic because I'm Lady Gaga.'

Hiding the pain: She added of her depression: 'It’s not always easy, if you have mental issues, to let other people see. I used to show. I used to self-harm. I used to say, "Look. I cut myself. See, I’m hurt." Cause I didn’t think anyone could see. Cause mental health, it’s invisible'

Own worst enemy: Gaga added: 'I went from looking at this piano and thinking, "You ruined my life!" I was like, "You made me Lady Gaga. My biggest enemy is Lady Gaga!"' She's pictured at the August 2020 MTV Video Music awards above

Gaga added of Chromatica: 'There's not one song on that record that's not true. Not one. I totally gave up on myself, I hated being famous. I hated being a star. I felt exhausted and used up.'

But she's since found a way through her depression, thanks to her latest album, which recently won her three MTV Video Music Awards. 

The Stupid Love artist said: 'I don't hate Lady Gaga anymore. I found a way to love myself again, even when I thought that was never gonna happen.

'Now I look at this piano and I go, "Oh, my god, my piano! My piano that I love so much; my piano that lets me speak; my piano that lets me make poetry; my piano that's mine."' 

Used up: Gaga added of Chromatica: 'There's not one song on that record that's not true. Not one. I totally gave up on myself, I hated being famous. I hated being a star. I felt exhausted and used up'
