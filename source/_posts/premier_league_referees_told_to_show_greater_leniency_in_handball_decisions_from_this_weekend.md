Premier League referees have been told to show greater leniency with the new handball rule after an intensifying backlash against decisions given over the weekend.

According to The Athletic, the Premier League has not enjoyed the increasingly  negative response to the new rules and will encourage greater subjectivity among referees, starting this weekend.

But remarkably, even with supposed greater leniency, Eric Dier's controversial handball in Tottenham's 1-1 draw against Newcastle at the weekend would still be awarded.

Andy Carroll headed the ball against Eric Dier's arm to earn Newcastle a penalty at Tottenham

Steve  Bruce opposed the penalty decision that helped earn Newcastle United a point

The lighter rules would still see players penalised for the ball hitting their hand if their hand is above their head, meaning Neil Maupay would still see his handball in Brighton's defeat by Manchester United given again.

But for Crystal Palace's Joel Ward and United's Victor Lindelof, spot-kicks would not have been given.

The news will offer some form of respite for Premier League managers and players, who have been united in making a widespread call for the rule to be softened.

But for many, the amendments will ultimately not be strong enough. Even Steve Bruce, the Newcastle manager, said Dier's handball should not have resulted in a penalty for his side.

'The whole VAR thing and handball in particular this year is a total nonsense,' admitted Bruce. 'Maybe we can all get together and stop it because we're ruining the spectacle. 

'We've got away with one today, but it could have quite easily been at our end. I should be delighted but I know it'll bite me eventually. That's wrong.' 

Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher has been vocal against the new handball rules

Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher branded the Dier punishment a 'disgrace' and 'absolute joke'.

He added: 'Whether it's the Premier League, the FA, FIFA, Pierluigi Collina (chairman of their referees' committee), whoever's involved in this — stop it, because you are ruining football for everybody.'

On Twitter, Gary Lineker said: 'Ludicrous. Utterly ludicrous law exacerbated by VAR. Can we have our game back please?'
