He jetted into the Greek capital this week to film scenes for his new drama Man Of God.

And Mickey Rourke turned heads in a semi-sheer black lace shirt as he arrived at the Acropolis in Athens on Thursday ahead of filming. 

The actor, 67, looked effortlessly cool as he walked among cast and crew as they took in the ancient historical landmark.

Micky styled his quirky shirt with ripped blue jeans and gold-capped brown boots, while he covered his eyes in dark shades.

The Wrestler star also followed guidance as he also had with him a white face mask.

Mickey, who tied his blonde locks into a ponytail, looked at ease as he walked around and chatted to his companions.

The star takes on the role of 'Paralyzed Man' in Man Of God, Yelena Popovic's drama about Greek saint Nektarios of Aegina and his trials and tribulations. 

Mickey's outing comes after he seemingly reignited his most ongoing feud with Robert De Niro in July, which originally restarted last year.

In an Instagram post, Mickey claimed that director Martin Scorsese wanted him to be in his 2019 crime film The Irishman, but De Niro refused to work with him.

He wrote in the lengthy barrage of words: 'Hey Robert De Niro, that’s right i am talking to you, you big f***ing crybaby.

'A friend of mine just recently told me that a few months back you're quoted as saying to newspapers ‘Mickey Rourke’s a liar he talks all kind of s**t!’'

Rourke made the revelation about Scorsese wanting to set up a meeting about a possible role in The Irishman, and DeNiro's rebuttal of him being in the film, during an appearance on an Italian talk show last September.

De Niro's reps were quick to respond at the time with a statement saying Rourke was 'never asked to be in The Irishman nor was he ever even thought of, discussed or considered to be in the movie,' in a Page Six article titled -- Robert De Niro: Mickey Rourke is lying about The Irishman snub. 

'Listen Mr.Tough Guy in the movies, you're the 1st person that ever called me a liar and it was in a newspaper,' Rourke continued in the Instagram post. 

It's at this point that The Wrestler star made a harsh promise to the two-time Academy Award-winner.

'Let me tell you something, you punk a**, when i see you i swear to God on my Grandmother, on my brother and all my dogs, i gonna embarrass you severally 100%.'

He concluded the post by signing-off: 'Mickey Rourke 'as God is my witness.' 

Rourke has been very open about how he used to look up to DeNiro as an acting role model before they starred together in Angel Heart. But that all changed for him when he went to introduce himself on the set.

'About five minutes later, [De Niro] comes over he said, I think it's better if we don't talk because of characters in the movie. It's better if we don’t say hello, talk or anything,' Rourke added in the 2019 interview.

'It hurt my feelings a little bit 'cause I looked up to him.'

He added, 'I don't look up to [DeNiro] no more; I look through him, I came up from the s***. He doesn't know that life. I lived that f***ing life, so every time I look at him in the face, I look right through his ***hole.'
