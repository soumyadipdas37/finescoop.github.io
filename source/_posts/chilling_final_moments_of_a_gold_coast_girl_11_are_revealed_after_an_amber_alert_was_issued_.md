An Amber Alert was issued for a missing 11-year-old girl before chilling footage revealed her final moments.  

Laine-Ella Hyland, from the Gold Coast, was reported missing after she left her Main Beach home 'because of a disagreement with her mother' on August 18. 

She hasn't been heard from since she reportedly visited a friend's house on August 24 and Queensland Police issued the urgent alert on Thursday.    

Police also released CCTV video of Laine-Ella's last confirmed sighting and called for 'urgent public assistance' in finding the missing girl.

Queensland Police released chilling CCTV footage (pictured) of Laine-Ella's last confirmed sighting at Main Beach on August 18. She appeared to say goodbye to two girls 

The footage showed Laine-Ella, dressed in a grey hoodie, and two other girls walk out from a residence on Cronin Avenue on August 18. 

The two taller girls took turns hugging Laine-Ella before she walked down the stairs and out of view. 

Regional Crime Coordinator Detective Superintendent Brendan Smith said police were looking to speak with the girls in the footage. 

'We want to identify those two girls because they may assist us with who she's with or where she is,' he told reporters on Friday.   

Supt Smith said it was a 'massive concern' that Laine-Ella had not been seen for ten days. 

'Most runaways would be seen by somebody so that's really heightened my concern.

'This person could be anywhere so please come forward with the slightest but of information,' he said.  

Supt Smith said Members of the Homicide Squad, PolAir and 'other more covert strategies' were being used to search for the missing girl. 

Queensland Police hold 'serious concerns' about Laine-Ella's welfare and said she was last seen at a friend's home in Southport on August 24 (the Gold Coast pictured) 

'We just want to find her, we just want her to come home. 

'If she's got concerns about her home life and that's why she's refusing to come home we will address that once we find her,' Supt Smith said.   

He explained that police were anxious to see 'proof of life'.

'Ten days is a long time... I'm hoping it's because she doesn't want to be found but I can't rule out foul play.'   

Supt Smith also said Laine-Ella could have been abducted or assisted by another family. 

'Abduction is at the top end but we're also looking at people actively assisting her to stay away from home. 

'Some of the people we have been dealing with have not been telling us the whole truth,' he told reporters on Thursday.   

It is not known whether Laine-Ella is being held against her will.      

Laine-Ella is described as Caucasian, with a slim build and about 150cm tall, with shoulder-length blonde hair and blue eyes.  

Police urged members of the public to look out for Laine-Ella around Southport and the Gold Coast as well as in south Brisbane. 

Anyone who has seen Laine-Ella or has further information has been urged to contact Queensland Police.
