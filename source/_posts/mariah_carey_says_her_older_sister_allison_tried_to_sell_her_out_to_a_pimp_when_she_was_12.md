Mariah Carey opened up about childhood trauma she attributes to her older siblings - including an allegation her sister Allison, who she described as 'troubled and traumatized ... tried to sell [her] out to a pimp.'

In a passage in her new book The Meaning of Mariah Carey, Carey, 50, said of her sister Allison: 'When I was 12 years old, my sister drugged me with valium, offered me a pinky nail full of cocaine, inflicted me with third degree burns and tried to sell me out to a pimp.'

Winfrey, on The Oprah Conversation, asked the singer about why she feels her siblings - sister Allison, 57, and brother Morgan, 60, who she described as 'extremely violent' - treated her as such.

'We don't even really know each other, and that's the thing' she said. 'We didn't grow up together, but we did.

'Like, they were on their journeys, by the time I got into the world, they had already been damaged, in my opinion. But again, I wasn't there. I was dropped into this world and I literally felt like an outsider amongst my own family.'

The Grammy-winning singer in the new memoir said that both siblings have been 'attacking' her verbally for years.

She told Oprah that her siblings 'just grew up with the experience of living with a Black father and a white mother together, as a family, and I was, for the most part, living with my mother, which they saw as easier, but in reality it was not.'

In the chat with Winfrey, the mom-of-two - to twins Moroccan and Monroe, nine, with ex-husband Nick Cannon, said that her relationship with her mother continues to be strained.

'I think it's really a tough job to be a mother ... so I literally try to make my kids' lives amazing,' the Vision of Love artist said. 'But we all make mistakes...

'I would say the neglect was on several levels. I always felt dirty, I didn't feel put together, and' her mother was leaving her 'with people who were not safe.'

She said: 'I stayed in the car until he tried to get me to touch him. Then I tried to get out. For her to ask me to talk to him in his car, it didn’t seem that strange...

'At the time, it didn’t come up in my mind, she was my mother. That’s what you ask me to do and I’ll do it.'

Meanwhile, back in in 2016, Mariah's brother lashed out at the pop diva, calling her selfish for abandoning their struggling sister who was released after being arrested for prostitution.

Morgan made the scathing remarks during an interview where he discussed all the issues faced by the 'broken family' - and also called on his superstar sister to splash her cash and help fix things
