She has jetted to Marbella for a girls' holiday after ringing in her 25th birthday.

And Chloe Ferry made sure all eyes were on her as she slipped into a busty black corset during a night out with pal Bethan Kershaw in the Spanish city on Friday. 

The Geordie Shore star, 25, put on an eye popping display in the skintight number, which featured a belt detail which cinched her in at her narrow waist.

Wow! Chloe Ferry made sure all eyes were on her as she slipped into a busty black corset during a night out with pal Bethan Kershaw in Marbella, Spain on Friday

Chloe teamed her top with a tiny pair of denim hotpants, while she boosted her height with sexy black knee-high boots.

The reality star carried her essentials in a simple black handbag, while she accessorised with a silver watch and dainty gold earring. 

Chloe upped the glam with a generous palette of make-up for her night on the town, while her blonde locks were styled in a half up, half down 'do. 

Bethan meanwhile slipped into a form-fitting peach mini dress, which she paired with pointed nude heels and a taupe handbag.

Earlier in the day, the girls flaunted their figures in skimpy swimwear as they soaked up the sun at their resort.

While Bethan left little to the imagination in a barely-there black two-piece, Chloe highlighted her curves in a plunging white belted swimsuit. 

They also posed up a storm as they donned matching ruched dresses in hues of lime green and blue.

Back in May, Chloe cried 'tears of happiness' as she thanked her followers for their support during her weight loss journey in an emotional Instagram clip. 

Despite her transformation, the beautician recently admitted she still doesn't 'feel great' about her figure.

Chloe said the trolls have got 'inside my head' after being inundated with cruel taunts calling her 'fat and ugly every day'. 

The reality star's girly getaway comes after she ignored speculation she had faked a trip to Ibiza and had instead secretly joined her ex boyfriend Sam Gowland, 25, in Dubai.

It had recently been reported that the star had back together with her co-star ex - despite being in the throes of filming Celebs Go Dating. 

A source told The Sun the former-couple were said to be 'reconnecting'; but fans also connected the dots.

An insider said: 'Chloe's taking it really slowly and she's keen to keep it quiet as her friends will all be furious after all the drama. It's a chance for them to reconnect.'

MailOnline contacted Chloe and Sam's representatives for comment at the time. 

The present season of Celebs Go Dating signed Chloe up amid what appeared to be the complete end to her and Sam's romance.

The couple - who have been on/off for years and had a turbulent relationship since first getting together in 2017 - were believed to split for good in February.

This is thought to be what prompted her to sign up for the virtual version of the celebrity dating show.
