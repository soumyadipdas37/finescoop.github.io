She's known for making a fashion statement.

The 34-year-old fashionista also made sure to sport a face covering on her quick jaunt around the block with her pet pooch.

Palermo rocked a heavy beige cardigan with chocolate brown stripes and bright yellow accents on her shoulders.

The former reality television star sported a pair of black slacks which were cropped above her ankles and featured delicate white pinstripes.

She pounded the pavement in black leather loafers while her Maltese pup, Mr. Butler, walked beside her.

Olivia slicked back her chestnut hued hair into a messy bun and kept a pair of dark frames over her eyes.

The Project Runway guest judge wore a thick silver chain around her neck, but her most vibrant accessory was certainly her bubble gum pink face mask. 

She's also been actively advising her 6.4 million Instagram followers to 'wear a damn mask' or 'scarf, or like me a combination of both!'

'However you choose to style your mask, wear one that covers your mouth and nose to help protect yourself and others,' she told her fans last month. 

Palermo rose to fame starring alongside Whitney Port in The City, a New York-based spin-off from the popular MTV program focused on Lauren Conrad's life, The Hills. 

She has been married to German model Johannes Huebl, 42, since 2014.
