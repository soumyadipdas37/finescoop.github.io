A beloved mother and owner of a high-profile music venue in New Zealand has died after a gruelling battle with cancer.

Gabrielle Mullins, 61, was diagnosed with stage four cancer in her lungs, brain and other areas around her body in March before the country was placed into lockdown.

The mother-of-one was due to undergo experimental treatment but tragically died on August 27 surrounded by loved ones.

Ms Mullins has since been remembered as a 'force of nature' who fought her illness to the end.

The 61-year-old had ran the gig venue, Powerstation, along with her partner Peter Campbell in Auckland since 2009.

The venue had welcomed the likes of international stars like Lorde and Kendrick Lamar, and had been voted Best Large Music Venue in New Zealand in 2014.

A GiveALittle fundraiser had been set up to raise money so Ms Mullins could undergo the highly expensive Keytruda treatment.

Keytruda, which is unfunded by the government, is an immunotherapy treatment which helps the immune system detect and fight cancer cells.

The treatment however, can also affect normal healthy organs affecting the way they work and can lead to life-threatening side effects in severe cases.

More than $16,000 was raised for Ms Mullins to undergo the treatment before she passed away.

On top of her diagnosis, the coronavirus pandemic effectively forced Powerstation to close.

A close friend, Carmel Bennett, said the cancer had come on aggressively.

'She fought the hell out of it, she truly was a force of nature,' Ms Bennett told Stuff.

'She was just so passionate about the Powerstation and about life in general. Everything was detailed.'

 When speaking about her daughter Coco, partner and two dogs, Ms Bennett said 'they were the loves of her life'.

Another 'heartbroken' friend, Lizzie Garneau who started the fundraiser, said Ms Mullins would be forever missed.

'I am so grateful to have found my soul sister here,' she wrote.

'And what a sister, Gabrielle’s amazing spirit, compassion, energy and wisdom has imbued me with resilience through all of our lives and I can feel her around me right now - to soothe understand laugh love encourage and know that everything will be ok. 

'Gabrielle is a true icon, a woman of incomparable spirit music style grace generosity wit sparkle. For ever and ever missed.'

Powerstation also paid tribute to the 'heart and soul' of the venue. 

'The many people who have had the privilege of knowing this formidable, caring and beautiful woman will know that without Gabrielle, The Powerstation would not exist today,' the group wrote on Facebook.

'Gabrielle had a truly generous spirit and an infectious, irrepressible energy. Her shining, sparkly legacy can be seen and felt through every part of our venue, and our lives – from the incomparably electric atmosphere, to the artwork, adornments and smallest touches that she created with such love and care that make our space so special to us all.'

A funeral was held for the Ms Mullins on September 4.
