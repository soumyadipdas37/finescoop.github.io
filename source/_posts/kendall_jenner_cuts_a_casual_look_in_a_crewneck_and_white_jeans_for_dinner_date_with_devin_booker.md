Last week, they ventured to Idaho with pop star Justin Bieber, 26, and his wife Hailey, 23, who happens to be Kendall's longtime best friend.  

In June, Kendall and Devin were seen getting into the same SUV as they left a dinner date at Nobu. Prior to this they allegedly embarked on a road trip to Arizona in April.   

Devin, who attended University of Kentucky and Moss Point High School, Grandville High School, reportedly made $27M in 2019, after signing a $158 million maximum contract extension with the Phoenix Suns, who he has played with since 2015.

Kendall is notoriously tight-lipped about her romances and despite being linked to celebs including Harry Styles and Kyle Kuzma she rarely confirms the romance. 

Previously when linked to the Detroit Pistons player, Jenner refused to directly name Griffin because she 'likes to keep [her] private life private.'

But she did reveal to the magazine that the person she was dating happened to be 'very nice' and that she was 'happy.' 

She added: 'I have someone being very nice to me.'

Though neither of them spoke publicly about their breakup, it was alleged that Griffin's trade from the LA Clippers to the Detroit Pistons had a hand in their split.
