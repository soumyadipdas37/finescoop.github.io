Bath made sure the playoff race will go to the tape after a dominant win over Worcester where they scored six tries.

In doing so they stayed one point behind fourth-placed Wasps with just three regular-season matches to go, Bath hoping for just a third semi-final appearance in a decade.

The win was typified by a newly-electrified forward pack who beat Worcester up and made space for the backs.

Elliott Stooke scored twice and Tom Ellis, Jack Walker, Tom de Glanville and Josh Matavesi added the rest.

With Wasps moving six points ahead of them earlier in the evening, Bath needed a bonus-point win to keep the pressure on – especially with a trip to second-placed Sale coming on Sunday.

Lucky, then, that their all-important fourth try came just before half-time. It was typical of the new gnarly Bath that has emerged chiselled since lockdown, with strong biffing from the forwards followed by fast feet out wide.

De Glanville scored it on the left, his third in seven league games this season, and it calmed Bath down after a shaky start.

Seven minutes in hooker Walker was intercepted by Billy Searle who ran one in and converted to set home minds racing, but soon Bath were back. Ellis and Stooke took a try each before they let Worcester off the hook.

Zach Mercer dropped the kick-off after Matavesi’s second conversion and Samoan Ed Fidow raced away with the ball to score immediately.

Searle hit a post with his kick, and by the time Walker and then de Glanville had took Bath’s third and fourth tries the blue, black and white were turning Worcester black and blue.

As if to demonstrate that Warriors had made 112 tackles by the break – Bath just 29. At least Searle kicked a penalty before the half was out to close the gap to 11 on the scoreboard.

That was as close as they came. Bath soon were well clear. Stooke scored his second down the blind side after a maul and then Matavesi threw a ridiculous dummy, stayed still and instead ran over Justin Clegg and went straight through to score and convert his fifth of the night.

It remains to be seen if Bath will have enough to beat Exeter away if they make fourth next month, but at least at last they are timing their dip to the line.
