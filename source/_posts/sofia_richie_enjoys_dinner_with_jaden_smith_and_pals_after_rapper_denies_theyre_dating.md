Sofia Richie and Jaden Smith enjoyed dinner with pals in Malibu on Friday night, after he was pictured holding hands with model Sab Zada. 

The pair have sent tongues wagging in recent weeks, but Sofia's former flame Jaden recently denied they were dating. 

The blonde beauty, 22, turned heads in a cheetah print coat and flared jeans as she left Nobu separately from Jaden, 22.

Sofia teamed the statement coat with a black starry silk face mask and a cowl neck jumper. 

The daughter of Lionel Richie added a boost to her height with black heeled boots and toted a small designer handbag.

She wore her blonde looks down in a middle parting and accentuated her striking looks with an understated palette of make-up.

The two were joined by friends outside of the cinema before walking off hand-in-hand after watching the late night film. 

Sab is best known for her @Pasabist Instagram handle as she has earned a following of over 554K.

The romantic outing comes at an interesting time as just weeks ago he had sparked rumours of romance with Sofia, as they took to the beach for Labor Day weekend. 

Childhood pals: 'But, me and Sofia have been friends for like 10 years. We've been going to the beach pretty consistently for 10 years too,' he said

Loyal: He added: 'But, yeah, we're just homies and we love each other and it was fun'

He has since set the record straight, revealing he and Richie are 'just homies' and have been enjoying each other's company as beach buddies for the better part of a decade.

He said on On Air with Ryan Seacrest: 'You know, I actually don't look at the internet, so I didn't see that.

Jaden and Sofia were previously rumoured to have a brief teen romance, which lasted from 2012 to 2013, when they were both 14.   

The model recently split from Scott Disick, 37, 'for good,' after three years of dating.  

The TV star and Sofia ended their turbulent romance earlier this summer, and they are now no longer on speaking terms after 'Scott officially called it off.' 

An E! News insider claimed that their age difference and different lifestyles, as Scott has three children, ultimately became an issue for the celebrity duo.
