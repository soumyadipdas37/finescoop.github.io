Love is in the air! Francesca Farago and Jef Holm were spotted jetting into Los Angeles on Friday, where Francesca planted a kiss on her new beau's cheek 

The couple could hardly keep their hands off each other upon returning to the City Of Angels.

Francesca tenderly embraced Jef as they waited for their luggage before leaving the transport hub with their dogs in tow.

Francesca rolled her suitcase and Louis Vuitton bag across the street while holding  the leash to her white Pomeranian, who happily scampered by her side.

Bachelorette vet Jef had his hands full with luggage as he strolled beside his girlfriend, supervising their other pooch.

Making comfort a priority for their flight home, Francesca slipped into grey biker shorts, a Harley Davidson T-shirt, and protective black face mask.

Jef was equally dressed down in his red flannel shirt, denim cut-offs, and white sneakers.

Francesca and Jef appear to have recently returned from Las Vegas, where the Netflix star posted a sizzling lingerie snap from the balcony of her hotel room.

While the couple certainly seem infatuated with one another, Jef insists they are taking their relationship one day at a time.

'She's a lot of fun to be around,' Holm told E! News. 'We've been hanging out and getting to know each other. She's a great person inside and out and we have a lot in common. I definitely have a crush on her.'

'People are quick to put a title on things but we're just in the beginning stages and are taking things slow.'
