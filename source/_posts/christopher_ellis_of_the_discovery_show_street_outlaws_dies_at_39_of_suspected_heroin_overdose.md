Sad end: Christopher Scott Ellis has died at the age of 39 it Oklahoma City, it was revealed on Wednesday by TMZ

A roommate, who had not seen Christopher in several days, had tried to get into the residence to check on him with no luck as the door was locked.

He then contacted two friends to help him unlock the door, which they did, and upon entrance to the home, they found the star dead.

According to the site, Ellis 'was found slumped forward with his head laying on a table with a metal spoon, a liquor bottle, and a syringe nearby.'

The syringe contained 'a small amount of a dark liquid' the officer noted as consistent with heroin, added the site.

Bad turn: The mechanic passed away after an apparent heroin overdose, the site reported, and had been dead for several days when he was found at his home on September 9

But the other friends maintained that they were aware Chris had a drug problem.

It was added that police believed there were no signs of foul play.

The initial autopsy was 'inconclusive,' according to the site, and a toxicology report is still pending.
