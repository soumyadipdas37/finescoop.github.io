A World War II submachine gun is among dozens of illegal firearms seized by police in Tasmania as part of a crackdown on firearm trafficking.

The machine gun, as well as pistols, a silencer, Taser and firearms parts, was discovered last week at Parattah, about an hour north of Hobart.

A 63-year-old man has been charged with a host of firearm offences, including illegal trafficking and possessing unregistered and prohibited guns.

Detective Inspector Damien George said the machine gun find was 'most troubling'.

'The individual in question had gone to a reasonable effort to conceal that weapon,' he told reporters on Wednesday.

The guns were uncovered with the help of a specialist sniffer dog.

A 57-year-old man from Richmond, near Hobart, has also been charged with illegal gun trafficking.

It is alleged he had been operating as a licensed firearms dealer.

Police have seized some 40 guns since the operation began in May.

The two men are expected to face court in early 2021.
