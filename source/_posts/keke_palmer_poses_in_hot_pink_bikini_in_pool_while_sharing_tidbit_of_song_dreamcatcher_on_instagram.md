Keke Palmer posed in a hot pink bikini Sunday on social media while sharing a tidbit of her new song Dreamcatcher.

The 27-year-old entertainer sparkled in the short video clip that she shared with her roughly 9.9 million followers on Instagram.

Keke in the video stood in shallow pool water in her bright bikini and beamed while putting her hand on top of her long, curly hair as she struck a pose.

The opening lines to her new song Dreamcatcher were then heard, 'Hope it helps you sleep' and Keke also wrote 'Dreamcatcher' in the caption.

Keke glittered with the help of a filter and smiled as she apparently missed her mark singing along to the tune.

The Illinois native released her third EP titled Virgo Tendencies, Pt. 1 in August through her record label Big Bosses Entertainment.

Dreamcatcher was the second song on the 12-track project.

Keke last week hosted the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards from New York City amid the coronavirus pandemic.

She performed her song Snack that was released in July as the third single from her EP.

Disney+ announced last month that Keke will voice a new character in the upcoming revival The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder.

Keke will voice 14-year-old activist Maya Leibowitz-Jenkins in the upcoming animated series.

The streaming service also shared some artwork of Maya, depicting a fierce teenage girl wearing grey jeans, sneakers and an ochre colored zip up.

Maya has her brunette hair cornrows with some bright red highlights and in the image was standing proud with her cartoon fist raised and a look of determination on her face.

The original Proud Family cartoon aired on the Disney Channel from 2001-2005, and no release date has been announced yet for its reboot.
