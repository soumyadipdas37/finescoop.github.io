With working from home the new normal for so many of us, it's no wonder that people are looking for ways to make the process easier. 

If you're short on space, then a folding computer desk is a great option. And they're not as expensive as you might think. 

In fact, the Cherry Tree Furniture Compact Foldable Computer Desk is only £46.99 - and it's proving to be a big hit with Amazon shoppers. So much so in fact that the affordable folding desk has received a near-perfect average rating of 4.6 out of 5. 

The Cherry Tree Furniture Compact Foldable Computer Desk has received over 1,000 glowing reviews on Amazon and an impressive average rating of 4.6 out of 5

The Cherry Tree Furniture Compact Foldable Computer Desk couldn't be simpler to use. You don't even need to get your tool kit out. Flat packed and ready to use, you can have the desk up in seconds. 

The super compact desk folds flat for easy storage and mobility so you can place it wherever you want. When you're done working, just close it up and store neatly away. Simple. 

With over 1,000 reviews on Amazon, shoppers are impressed with the contemporary folding design and comment on how well it fits into their space.

The low price means it is pretty basic in design and doesn't offer shelving and drawers for your paperwork and other office essentials. But for the price, it's hard to argue with the value, and it's large enough to house a laptop, keyboard, mouse, paperwork and other office paraphernalia.

In fact, it's the simple, no-frills no-fuss design has made it so popular with Amazon shoppers.

One shopper left a five-star review, writing: 'Yes its cheap and cheerful, but it does the job and that is all that matters! Very sturdy, well constructed and folds flat. If you have a small space, this is ideal, it fits into anywhere! I am really impressed with this and can recommend.'

'3 steps from fold away to work away!' wrote another delighted shopper 'There is zero assembly required.. it all comes flat in the box. 

'Lift the desk up, prop the legs out to either side and slot the desk in. Sturdy, stylish and space saving. Simply lift desk, tuck legs in, slot away or prop up against a wall to open up space again. Bargain.'

You can set up and store away the desk in seconds, which is ideal when working from home

A third added: 'Amazing cost benefit. Bought this desk to be able to work from home during lockdown. The desk is perfect to fit a laptop, documents and a drink. Very lightweight, easy to carry around and move to different places in the house.'

The coronavirus has meant that many of us are having to re-think our working environment. If you're tight on space then having a folding desk that can be set up and stored away in seconds is a worthwhile investment.  

'Blown away by this,' wrote one shopper. 'Wasn’t expecting much and as it was for occasional use in spare room, didn’t give it much thought. However lockdown necessitated this became in use full time and it has been perfect. 

'Great size, sturdy and looks really good. Plus of course when all this is over - it can be folded away really easy. Super impressed.' 

Cherry Tree Furniture also offers a 3-Tier Foldable Display Shelf Unit, which can be folded when not in use to save space. And it's a very affordable £31.99.
