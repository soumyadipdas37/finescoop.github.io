Viewers quickly took to social media to hit out at the host for forgetting about the current rules amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

One user said: 'Alex touching Max just then so much for distancing,' while another added: 'Back in the lift, touch him on the arm, no 'distancing' Alex'. 

Another viewer said: 'Oh dear, Alex Jones *touched* Max George. They'll be letters!' 

The show came to an end before the lack of social distancing could be addressed on the air.

Max, 31, is the second star from The Wanted to join Strictly after his former bandmate Jay McGuinness previously won the series in 2015.

Speaking of following in Jay's footsteps, Max said: 'There's no comparison, but he might be able to mentor me through Zoom. He did say he can imagine me like a little schoolboy, nervous.'

Max rose to fame in 2009 with the group - completed by Siva Kaneswaran, Tom Parker and Nathan Sykes - known best for hit song All Time Low. 

Max was the third star to be announced for this year's Strictly following actress Caroline Quentin and NFL player Jason Bell.

Also taking part this year are Radio 1 presenter Clara Amfo, Good Morning Britain's Ranvir Singh and former professional boxer Nicola Adams.

Nicola will make history on this year's show as part of the programme's first same-sex pairing. 

Fans will be delighted to hear the Strictly news - after worries the series would be axed this year thanks to the pandemic.

The intimate nature of the series means social distancing is impossible - but the pros have started rehearsals, with their celebrity counterparts slowly being unveiled over the coming days.

Other stars rumoured to be taking part include Denise Van Outen and Bill Bailey.
