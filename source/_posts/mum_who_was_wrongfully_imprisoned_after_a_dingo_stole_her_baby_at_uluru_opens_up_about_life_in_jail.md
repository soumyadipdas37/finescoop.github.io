A mother who was wrongly imprisoned after a dingo stole her baby has opened up about the impact of the case and her time in jail.  

Lindy Chamberlain famously lost her nine-week-old daughter Azaria when she was dragged from a tent in Uluru, in the Northern Territory, on August 17, 1980.    

The disappearance led to a series of court cases and coroner's inquests that saw Chamberlain, 72, receive a sentence for life imprisonment. 

The Queensland-based grandmother-of-three also discussed the infamous 'black baby dress' and said it was made for her eldest son, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Chamberlain (pictured) was wrongfully sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in 1982 and said her time in jail taught her to develop patience 

Chamberlain (pictured with ex-husband Michael Chamberlain) also said a 'black baby dress' which convinced Australians she was a witch had been made for her son  

An upcoming documentary 'Lindy Chamberlain: The True Story' will reveal new details of the family's experience and home movies of Azaria. 

Narrated by Sam Neil, the Network Ten exclusive draws on interviews with eyewitnesses, high profile media identities, high court judges and family friends. 

It will also show the impact of the case on Chamberlain's other children, Aidan, 46, Reagan, 44, and Kahlia, 37. 

Chamberlain famously screamed 'a dingo's got my baby!' to her fellow campers when the infant was dragged from the tent.  

Previously unheard recordings will show Chamberlain discussing a black baby dress decorated with red ribbons with her mother. 

The homemade dress bizarrely convinced many Australians the mum was involved with witchcraft and had somehow been responsible for Azaria's death.

'In this tape, recorded years before Azaria was born, I talk about how I'd made the black dress for Reagan and how much I liked it and how much Michael hated it,' she said.    

Chamberlain was wrongly jailed for murder and her ex-husband Michael was sentenced as an accessory in 1982. 

Lindy Chamberlain was a 32-year-old mother of three (she is pictured with husband Michael and sons Reagan and Aidan) when she returned to the family tent to find an empty bassinet 

She was released in 1986 upon the sensational discovery of the baby's yellow matinee jacket at the base of Uluru.     

Chamberlain also reflected on her time in prison and said it taught her to be patient.

'In the early days they tried to break me by giving me extra nasty jobs, but I would whip through anything and they soon realised it wasn't working.'

She said her biggest regret was not the three years she spent in prison but the way her case affected others who were involved. 

Some witnesses were not believed by the police force and legal system and felt traumatised by the process. 

'It makes me sad that they feel responsible that I went into prison,' she said.  

The family were acquitted responsibility after a fourth coroner's inquest in 2012 which found that Azaria died 'as a result of being attacked and taken by a dingo'.  

A royal commission exonerated her of murder in 1988. Lindy Chamberlain is pictured during the late 1980s with her eldest son Aiden, second son Reagan, daughter Kahlia who was born as her mother served a life sentence and husband Michael
