Megan Thee Stallion has recently gotten back to work, giving her first virtual concert amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

But the Houston-born rapper is also enjoying some leisure time, getting away for a tropical vacation. 

She put on a cheeky display Monday in a neon green bikini, as she went yachting and snorkeling with her gal pals, following a night of partying in what appears to be Turks and Caicos.

The 25-year-old soaked up some sun, as she lied on her stomach, while sporting a pair of clear sunglasses.

She also geared up in an orange life preserver, a pair of goggles and a snorkel, as she sat on the edge of the boat.

She appears to be working on a project in Turks and Caicos, appearing in tags from her dancers, hairstylist and personal photographer.

The WAP artist previously posed for an impromptu shoot, rocking a similar neon bikini top and white bottoms.

It was layered with a sheer white two-piece coverup and finished with blue frameless sunglasses, matching her short wavy 'do.

She also posted videos from a celebration on Sunday night, writing: 'Last night was too lit. why we clown everywhere we go'

She had plenty to celebrate with her and Cardi B's hit track WAP becoming the first No. 1 female rap collab in the UK.

The Savage artist recently told Elle: 'Although we have so many incredible women in hip-hop killing it right now and in the past, there’s still a shift [that needs to happen] around the perception of a woman owning her sexuality.

Megan continued: 'Powerful women who have agency over their bodies aren’t something to look down on.'
