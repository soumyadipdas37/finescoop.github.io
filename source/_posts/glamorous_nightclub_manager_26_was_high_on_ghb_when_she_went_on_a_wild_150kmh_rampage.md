Skye Melissa Fuller, from the Gold Coast, admitted she had taken the psychoactive drug when officers found it along with two other illegal steroid-related substances and a syringe in her handbag

A nightclub manager was high on GHB when she went on a wild 150km/h rampage, bumping into guardrails and swerving into oncoming traffic, a court has heard.

Skye Melissa Fuller, from the Gold Coast, admitted she had taken the psychoactive drug when officers found it along with two other illegal steroids and a syringe in her handbag. 

Police prosecutor Sergeant Kylie Vanderbyl told the court the 26-year-old was driving at excessive speed, and collided with guard rails and barriers on either side of the Pacific Motorway at 12.35pm on May 8.  

'The silver Holden Captiva was observed swerving in and out of lanes, tailgating vehicles, reducing speed before accelerating and tailgating and other vehicles were required to move out of the way to avoid a serious collision,' she said. 

Sgt Vanderbyl said when officers finally pulled Fuller over, she appeared confused about where she was.

'Police allege the defendant's driving was dangerous, she put her own life at risk and other road users,' the prosecutor said.

'She was nervous and trembling and her pupils appeared to be small and pin point in size. She appeared confused.

Sgt Vanderbyl noted Fuller, who manages a nightclub in Surfers Paradise, was 'extremely apologetic and clearly distressed' by her actions.

Fuller's defence lawyer Nicholas Crawford said his client was diagnosed with a serious illness and 'spiralled' and began to abuse 'illicit substances' in April this year when her health deteriorated, the Courier-Mail reported. 

She pleaded guilty to six offences including dangerous operation of a vehicle while adversely affected and excessively speeding and three counts of unlawful possession of a dangerous drug. 

Chief Magistrate Terry Gardiner disqualified Fuller from driving for nine months and sentenced her to 15 months' probation.

Mr Gardiner warned Fuller to take the consequences seriously so she doesn't land back in court.
