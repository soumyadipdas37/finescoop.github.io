Marisol Nichols' amazing story of balancing being a Hollywood star and an undercover agent in the battle against human trafficking is headed to the small screen.

Sony Pictures Television has optioned rights to bring Nichols' story to the TV, Deadline reported on Monday.

The story of the 46-year-old actress, who plays Hermione Lodge on The CW's Riverdale, comes after she revealed her efforts with law enforcement in a piece with Marie Claire earlier this year.

Nichols said that she's been collaborating with police, FBI and Operation Underground Railroad putting her acting talents to use playing the roles of people involved in the situations.

In the operations, which took place on a global level, Nichols portrayed wither a parent looking to prostitute their child; or a child involved in the process.

She's expected to both star in and executive produce the adaptation, according to the outlet. 

Nichols has also been seen on shows including Teen Wolf, 24, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Law & Order: SVU, and played the role of Audrey Griswold in 1997's Vegas Vacation.

Out and about: The actress was snapped earlier this year at a SAG luncheon

In addition to Riverdale, she's also in the film Spiral, a reboot of the Saw series. 

Six years ago, she began Foundation for a Slavery Free World, an anti-human trafficking nonprofit.

'Once you dive down this rabbit hole, it’s hard to turn it off; you can’t un-know it at all,' Nichols said in a statement on the site. 'And so I’ve tried and will continue to try to give a voice to this issue, lend whatever I can to help make a difference and to mobilize people to stand together to put an end to this because to me, the biggest problem of it is that most people don’t even know it occurs.

'Good people don’t know. And if good people don’t know about it, we can’t do anything about it.'
