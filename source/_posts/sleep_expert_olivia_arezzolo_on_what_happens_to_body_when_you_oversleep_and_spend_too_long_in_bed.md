Lack of concentration, headaches, fatigue and even obesity are just some of the things that happen to your body when you oversleep, a sleep expert has claimed.

Olivia Arezzolo, from Sydney, said while you might think that spending more than nine hours sleeping regularly would have you leaping out of bed the next day, in fact it can often mean the opposite.

'Studies show that long sleep is as problematic as short sleep - it can increase your risk of mortality by up to 30 per cent,' Olivia told FEMAIL.

'This is mainly derived from a cluster of cardiovascular illnesses linked to oversleeping, such as heart disease, diabetes and hypertension.' 

Olivia detailed the five things that happen to your body when you clock too many hours of shut-eye, and the 10-step bedtime routine to follow for the perfect night's sleep.

 1. Fatigue

The first thing oversleeping can paradoxically lead to is a sense of fatigue the next day.

'Oversleeping regularly can throw off your body's natural circadian rhythm, or our internal body clock,' Olivia said.

If you continually sleep for more than nine hours, you might wake up feeling groggy or almost jet-lagged and in need of another nap because your internal clock is out of sync:

'Oversleeping limits serotonin production, a hormone which usually makes you feel alert and energised,' Olivia explained.

'In the absence of light, the body produces melatonin - the hormone which makes you feel sleepy. When you're sleeping, it's likely to be dark.

'Hence, more darkness can lead to more sleepiness even the next day.'

2. Headaches

The second thing to watch out for if you're guilty of too much sleep is headaches.

Many people can often struggle with headaches at the weekends when they sleep in and try to 'catch up' on sleep.

'Many individuals are chronically sleep deprived,' Olivia said. 

'So if you are trying to amend your sleep patterns, you may find yourself needing to sleep more for a small period of time to "catch up" on the sleep you've missed for weeks, months or even years.'

The expert warns against trying to do this in order to get back on track, but rather recommends re-setting your body clock.

'The typical adult needs between seven and nine hours sleep per night,' Olivia said.

If you're trying to find your sweet spot, then go to bed at around 10pm one weekend without an alarm set and without drinking alcohol and then see when you naturally wake up.

1. Create a sleep sanctuary: Remove any blue light from iPhones and devices and keep your bedroom for sleep and relaxation.

2. Block blue light: Do not allow blue light into the bedroom and restrict this two hours from bedtime.

3. Set a goodnight alarm for your phone: At this point switch it off so you wake fully refreshed.

4. Diffuse lavender: Diffuse lavender either onto your pillows or throughout the room to promote relaxation.

5. Have an evening shower or bath: This helps to promote relaxation 45-60 minutes before bed.

6. Drink chamomile tea: Do this an hour before bed to make you calm.

7. Take a magnesium supplement: This helps the muscles to relax.

8. Practise gratitude: Think about what you are grateful for.

9. Try meditation: This can be useful to help you sleep.

10. Practise deep breathing: This makes it easier to sleep.

3. Lack of concentration

According to Olivia, researchers often find that men and women who get a regular seven-hour sleep each night perform better in cognitive tests than those who regularly fluctuate between oversleeping and under-sleeping. 

Sleeping in regularly can mean you wake up feeling groggy and struggle to concentrate without a strong dose of caffeine.  

4. Low mood and depression

One of the more serious side effects of oversleeping is low mood and even depression. 

'Research shows links between oversleeping and depression,' Olivia said.

'For those diagnosed with the condition, evidence pinpoints that 40 per cent are also considered hypersomniacs (long sleepers).'

Olivia said this may be to do with biochemical changes in the brain associated with the happiness hormone serotonin.

'When you spend lots of time in bed, you are likely to be reducing your physical activity levels which are important for the release of feel-good endorphins, serotonin and dopamine,' she said.

Try to stick to a regular sleep schedule as much as possible, even at the weekends when it can be tempting to spend longer in bed. 

5. Obesity

Finally, sleeping too much can even lead to you putting on weight and obesity.

'Research shows long sleepers gain 1.58 kilograms per year more than regular sleepers,' Olivia said.

They are also reportedly 21 per cent more likely to develop obesity.

If you're looking to reset your bedtime routine, Olivia recommends blocking all blue light from phones and iPads in the bedroom, drinking some chamomile tea before you slip between the sheets and taking a warm shower before bed. 

If you're looking for a supplement that might help, she also recommends magnesium or a magnesium spray on your stomach and pulse points.
