Liverpool are interested in signing Wolves forward Diogo Jota as a back-up option for their front three.

Jota was an unused substitute in Wolves' 2-0 victory over Sheffield United on Monday but was left out of Nuno Espirito Santo's squad for the Carabao Cup defeat by Stoke on Thursday.  

The Reds are stepping up their transfer activity with Thiago Alcantara having completed a £25million move to Anfield on Friday.
