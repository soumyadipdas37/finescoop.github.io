And Catherine was clearly feeling the cold as she added a pair of cosy Ugg boots to her look. 

At one point, the stunner even sported a white face mask and a purple hairnet as she cheerfully walked about the set. 

Despite the coat and boots combo, Catherine still managed to look super glam as she worked on her new project, with her brunette tresses styled into chic waves, while she sported a sleek palette of make-up. 

The TV star appeared at ease as she joined her co-stars in a restaurant as they continued to film scenes for the show.

Viewpoint, one of the ITV's first post-lockdown series, recently saw production suspended after a positive coronavirus test on set. 

But things were swiftly back to normal thanks to the safety protocols in place, with stars Alexandra Roach and Dominic Allburn also joining Catherine on set on Tuesday. 

Catherine's outing comes after she furiously took to Instagram on Monday to call out the social media user as she insisted: 'This s**t don't wobble.'

Referencing her strict workout schedule, the actress proved she's proud of how far she's come from being a size 22 teen as she added: 'I guarantee I could deadlift or squat your entire body weight, my love.' 

The Strictly Come Dancing star addressed the naysayer directly as she said: 'It's not often your Auntie Cath gets trolled, I'm very lucky like that. I've got lots of wonderful, positive people in my life.

'You do get the occasional twonk, so to the guy yesterday who said I had 'big fat legs', babes, I've been training these legs for seven years. This s**t don't wobble, and I guarantee I could deadlift or squat your entire body weight, my love.

'So things just got really awkward, really fast, didn't they? God bless ya, darling. Find the light, come on.'

The thespian has gushed about embracing her figure ever since she famously shed an impressive seven dress sizes. 

In an interview on Loose Women back in 2018, Catherine confessed she would have resorted to having a gastric band fitted as she struggled to control her weight as a size 22 teen. 

The TV star said she would have jumped at the chance to have weight-loss surgery when she was larger.

Joining a discussion on the rising number of teenagers being fitted with gastric bands, the mother-of-one told Janet Street-Porter, Stacey Solomon and Ruth Langsford her lack of education around food contributed to her gradual weight gain. 

She said: 'I used to be overweight and when I was a teenager my education on food wasn't the best so I was in a desperate place and probably would have jumped on that.' 

Tipping the scales at 15 stone, Catherine's weight plummeted leaving her a size 12, and following the birth of her first child Alfie, the blonde beauty lost another two stone leaving her a size 8 to 10.
