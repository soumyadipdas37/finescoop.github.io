Arsenal have announced plans to welcome up to 15,000 fans back to the Emirates next month.

Subject to government approval, they are working towards supporters returning for Sheffield United’s October 3 visit, with fans set to be allowed in stadiums again for reduced capacity matches from the start of the month.

Arsenal expect the allowed initial capacity to range between 15 and 25 per cent which, in their near-61,000-seater stadium home, equates to between 9000 and 15,000 supporters.

Priority access to the available tickets will be given to Arsenal’s gold season ticket holders and premium members. Arsenal have 48,000 eligible fans and all tickets will be distributed following a ballot.

Rather than renew their season tickets, supporters have until 5pm on September 10 to make the initial payment required to secure their place in the ballot scheme for the lower capacity games.

They will then pay for each match ticket that they have been awarded.

All supporters who attend will have to follow a number of strict guidelines including staggered arrival and departure times, the wearing of facemasks in all queuing areas, observe social distancing and will not be allowed to celebrate goals together.
