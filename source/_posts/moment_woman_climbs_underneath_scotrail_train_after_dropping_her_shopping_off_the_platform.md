A daring woman shocked passengers when she climbed underneath a ScotRail train to retrieve shopping which had fallen onto the tracks as she boarded. 

The traveller had been boarding a train at Troon station in Ayrshire on Tuesday when items appeared to drop from a bag onto the tracks beneath the locomotive. 

Footage from the incident shows two onlookers passing the woman products which had missed the gap as she moved her shopping bags safely inside the train.

She then returned to the train doors as a fellow passenger told her 'we cannot get down', but moments later she made the dangerous decision to ease herself below the train.

Another woman stood with her arm blocking the train door in an apparent attempt to stop the locomotive from leaving the station.

She emerged with the lost bag a few seconds later, throwing the item inside the train as the cameraman said: 'I've never seen anything like it in my life.'

The passenger then boarded the train as the clip came to an end.

ScotRail today reminded the public 'not to trespass anywhere on the railway' as they could be at risk of 'serious injury.'
