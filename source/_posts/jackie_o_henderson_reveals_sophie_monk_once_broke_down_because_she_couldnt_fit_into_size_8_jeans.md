Jackie 'O' Henderson has revealed she forged a close friendship with Sophie Monk over a moment of insecurity. 

The women met in 2000 when Sophie was a contestant on reality singing competition Popstars, where Sophie became part of girl group Bardot, and Jackie was a judge.  

Speaking to Stellar this week, Jackie, 45, says she came across Sophie, 40, weeping during a photo shoot when she could not fit into a pair of size 8 jeans.

'I just couldn't believe that Sophie could be insecure because she was so beautiful. There was a photo shoot and there was something about jeans,' Jackie said. 

Sophie recalled the moment also, explaining: 'They brought racks of clothing for everyone and all of the jeans were a size 8, and they had to get in different clothes because I couldn't fit into them.'

She added: 'I went into the bathroom crying and Jackie came in going, 'Don't worry, you look beautiful,' so that made me feel better. I was about 19 and was so insecure at that age'.

Sophie says that she was 'in awe' of Jackie from the moment they first met, and the feeling was clearly mutual. 

'I'll never forget seeing Jackie and thinking, 'Who is this girl?' because she was so gorgeous and I was in awe of her. 

'She really took me under her wing, because I was quite an insecure girl, getting into the industry, and we just kind of hit it off,' the Love Island Australia host added.
