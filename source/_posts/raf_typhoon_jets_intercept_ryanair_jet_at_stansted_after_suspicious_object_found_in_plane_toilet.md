Two RAF Typhoon fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Ryanair flight that landed at Stansted airport this evening after 'suspicious objects,' were found in an on board toilet.

Armed police surrounded a Laudamotion flight arriving at London Stansted from Vienna after it landed at around 7.20pm on Sunday.

Passenger Joanna Czechowska said Essex Police had boarded and took away two men after 'suspicious objects,' were found in the toilets.

Ryanair, which owns Laudamotion, said its crew were alerted to a 'potential security threat' while on board.

A company spokesman said: 'The crew of a Ryanair flight from Vienna to London Stansted this evening were alerted of a potential security threat on board. 

'In line with procedures, the captain informed UK authorities and continued to London Stansted, where the aircraft landed normally and taxied to a remote stand where passengers disembarked safely.

'Passengers in London Stansted waiting to depart to Vienna were transferred to a spare aircraft to minimise the delay to their flight.

'This is now a matter for the local police.' 

Passengers on board say the plane was surrounded by armed police from Essex constabulary, after it pulled up to an isolated part of the airport. 

It's understood police have now stood down from the scene. 

Both Typhoons circled over the airport several times, before the passenger flight had landed at the scene.

Flight radars spotted both jets flying down to the Essex airport from their base at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire

An RAF spokesperson said: 'Typhoon fighter aircraft from RAF Coningsby were launched this evening to intercept a civilian aircraft. The aircraft was escorted safely to Stansted.' 

The jets are thought to have then headed in the direction of Cheltenham to be refueled, before appearing to return towards base at RAF Coningsby.
