Karl Stefanovic welcomed his fourth child, daughter Harper May, just a few months ago with wife Jasmine Yarbrough, 36.

And the Today show host, 46, has revealed he's already thinking about having more children with Jasmine. 

'It's perfect to come home and be with Harper and however many more kids we have,' Karl told The Sunday Telegraph when quizzed about expanding his brood.

'You don't take it for granted, the ability to have a child, and I think we'll try to whenever the timing is right,' he added.   

Of his Father's Day plans, Karl revealed his plans to celebrate with Harper and the three children he shares with ex-wife Cassandra Thorburn: sons Jackson, 20, and River, 12, and daughter Ava, 15.

'The kids adore [Harper], so it's a nice point in our lives to be able to celebrate being a dad,' he said.

It comes just weeks after New Idea magazine reported that Karl and Jasmine are keen to give Harper a younger sibling. 

An insider claimed Karl has been telling colleagues at Channel Nine that he and Jasmine are keen to give Harper a younger sibling. 

'A second baby is not far away and due to COVID, they have decided to increase their family,' a source alleged.

 'Karl is telling his network colleagues they want a new baby brother or sister for Harper as soon as possible. His Today co-workers have said they are already planning that it will be sooner rather than later,' they added. 

Jasmine and Karl welcomed their daughter Harper on May 1 at Sydney's North Shore Private Hospital.  

In a statement to the Today show at the time, Karl said: 'Harper and Jasmine are doing well and dad had a great night's sleep.'

He added: 'I am in awe. Harper is absolutely perfect.' 

Karl met shoe designer Jasmine in late 2016, five months after his split from his wife of 21 years, Cassandra.

The new couple wed in a lavish ceremony at the One&Only Palmilla resort in San José del Cabo, Mexico, in December 2018.
