Oh my! Anthea Turner, who was due to marry business tycoon fiancé Mark Armstrong, 55, this month, was not letting the news get her down as she took to social media to share a snap of her jaw-dropping figure during a holiday in Greece

Flaunting her toned stomach and perky cleavage, she jumped into the ocean in joyous fashion while beaming at the camera. 

She then shared a snap of her washing rack to announce she was back home.  

 Sharing a caption alongside the snap, she penned: 'Back from my beautiful Greek Odyssey to Santorini, Naxos and Crete. This was the last shot taken while saying goodbye to the Aegean Sea the second shot taken this morning !!...

'Nothing like a white wash to say “I’m Home” I love coming home and even though we Brits have turned complaining into a national sport its still the place that holds my heart - Show you a other shots when I’ve sorted myself, lots more washing'.

Anthea was supposed to exchange vows with Mark this September, but the couple have had to postpone their wedding plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

She recently revealed that she and Mark were forced to postpone their wedding in Italy, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,

The celebration was originally scheduled to take place this September, but the couple announced in May they've pushed back their nuptials.



Anthea told HELLO!: 'Mark and I had planned to go out and look at venues in March and then set a date for September.

'Mark is from Italy, his family are from Milan, so it seemed the perfect place for us. 

'It will be next year now. I am not even in any angst about it. When we do it, it will be small and cute, just with our close friends and family.'

The TV veteran was previously married to ex-husband Grant Bovey for 13 years, but the couple split after he cheated on her with a woman half her age in 2013.

Anthea's first marriage was to her manager, former DJ Peter Powell, in 1990, with the couple splitting up eight years later.

On finally finding The One, the media personality gushed about her man of 13 months, who had planned a trip to Rome for her 60th birthday: 'Mark is the absolute love of my life, we adore each other.

'He makes me smile every day and we are excited about our life together. Sometimes, when you are a bit older and you have lived, something tells you this is so right, you just know.
