She's been able to return to her job as a nurse after testing positive for coronavirus in April.

And Rachel Fenton looked sensational as she enjoyed a night off from the NHS frontline and stepped out at Novikov in London on Wednesday.

The Love island star, 28, put on a very busty display as she flaunted her ample assets in a black cut out dress for the outing.

Wow! Rachel Fenton put on a very busty display as she took a night off from her job as a nurse to enjoy a trip to Novikov in London on Wednesday

Rachel sizzled in the statement garment which boasted a gold zip up one side and long-sleeves. 

Letting her dress do all the talking, she kept her accessories to a minimum only adding a small bracelet and toting a Christian Dior Saddle bag.

The blonde beauty, who celebrated her birthday last weekend, added some extra height to her ensemble with a pair of clear heels.

Rachel wore her long locks down and poker straight and also added a full face of makeup including a pink lipstick to accentuate her pretty features.

Rachel's outing comes after her coronavirus battle earlier this year, which saw her lose her sense of taste and smell, and also experience sleep disturbance and flushed cheeks.

In April, Rachel explained that she was thrilled to be able to return to work after recovering from COVID-19, but had be tested negative twice before she could resume her nursing job.  

She said: 'They swabbed me straight away and came back positive so I then isolated, I needed two negative swabs before I could come back on the ward which I've got now.

'The patients that are coming to us, we are swabbing them for coronavirus and when they come to the ward so they usually have to wait for a day in the rooms before they can have the procedure so their swabs can come back.'

'Some of them have come back positive, and most of them negative luckily.'

The blonde beauty rose to prominence after appearing in the second season of Love Island where she met and embarked on an 18-month romance with Rykard Jenkins.
