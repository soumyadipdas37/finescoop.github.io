Arabella's outing comes after it was revealed earlier this month that her latest boyfriend is 'play 35-year old boy' Morad Izemrane.

The Love Islander and her new man were  seen looking close in Ibiza toward the end of August, just weeks after she went public with Josh Newsham and four months after splitting from Wes Nelson.

As well as unveiling Morad's identity, The Sun reported that he was arrested for stealing a pricey Rolex from a woman he had a tryst with in a toilet.

According to the publication, he was arrested on accusations of 'affectionate theft' against the Italian woman when attempting to fly from Ibiza to Palma the next day.
