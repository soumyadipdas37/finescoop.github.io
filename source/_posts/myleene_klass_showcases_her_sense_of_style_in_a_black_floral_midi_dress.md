She never puts a foot wrong when it comes to her sartorial displays.

And Myleene Klass looked radiant as ever as she arrived at Global Studios to present her show on Smooth Radio on Thursday.

The media personality, 42, showcased her sense of style as she donned a black midi dress with a white floral print.

The garment featured a high collar while Myleene added height to her frame with a pair of black boots.

The former Hear'Say singer sported a black fedora hat while she also carried a matching handbag.

Looking in good spirits as she arrived to the studio, Myleene completed her look with a pair of sunglasses.  

Myleene's latest appearance came after her recent social media run-in with a troll who claimed her boyfriend Simon Motson will cheat on her.

The broadcaster recently posted a gallery of sweet images with the PR executive beau, 45, to celebrate five years since they had met.

However a troll wrote underneath: 'Not long before this one cheats on you. Dear oh dear, heading for the lawyers are we?'

In a pointed response, she fired back: 'He wishes! Cheating exes usually get a house, a car and a fat pay-off, in what appeared to be a dig at her ex-husband Graham Quinn, who left her on her 34th birthday in 2012.

The heartbreaking incident came just six months after the couple's wedding, but they had been together for 11 years at the time, after meeting when Graham became the bodyguard for Myleene's pop group Hear'Say in 2001.

The former couple are parents to two daughters, Ava, 13, and Hero, nine and Myleene was devastated to learn that he had secretly bought a bachelor pad for himself – meaning that he must have been planning his departure for some time.

The TV star was said to be blindsided by the split after supporting Graham, but it was never publicly confirmed if he cheated.

Myleene is now in a happy relationship with PR exec Simon who she began dating in 2015 after being introduced by two mutual friends.

They welcomed their first child together, son Apollo, in August last year.
