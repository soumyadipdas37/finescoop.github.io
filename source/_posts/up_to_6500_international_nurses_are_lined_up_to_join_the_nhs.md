Thousands of international nurses are reportedly lined up to join the NHS as England's chief nurse outlined plans to spend up to £180 million to boost numbers ahead of a second wave of coronavirus.

Ruth May told the Independent that 6,500 nurses were 'on the order book' to join the health service, with almost two dozen travelling from India in the past two weeks.

Ms May told the news site that 2,500 retired nurses who rejoined to help during the first stage of the pandemic were being supported to stay on, as the health service aims to prevent operations being cancelled this winter.

England's chief nurse has said up to 6,500 international nurses are lined up to join the NHS as bosses plan £180million recruitment drive to boost numbers ahead of Covid second wave

She told the Independent: 'Nurses were at the forefront of the Covid-19 response, they have worked so hard.

'The public have seen the breadth and depth of what nurses and midwives can do.

'I know they will, as a profession, step up yet again for the challenging few months we'll no doubt have.

'We will no doubt see that nurses will be in the forefront of the response during winter, and that's exactly why we want more nurses, that's why we're asking people to join our profession.

'We don't just want people to clap for nurses, we want people to become a nurse.'

The Department of Health and Social Care has provided £28 million to boost international nurse recruitment, while hospitals have £150 million to spend on existing nurses to boost their training and keep them in the health service, the Independent reported.
