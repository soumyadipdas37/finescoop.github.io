Paul died in 2013 in a fiery car crash when riding in the passenger seat of a Porsche. He was 40. 

Meadow, who spent most of her childhood living with her mother, Rebecca Soteros,  in Hawaii, decided to move to California and live with her dad a year before his death.

The duo became very close during that time. 

His brother Cody told PEOPLE at the time, 'He loved being a dad. He was so proud of her,'

In April Meadow shared a never seen before video of her surprising the Fast and the Furious star on one of his birthdays.

'I never thought I’d share this,' Meadow wrote in the caption accompanying the video. 'But it felt right. Be good. I love you. Stay safe. xx.'

The clip shows Paul opening a door and jumping back as he sees his daughter.

He falls back on a bed laughing and says 'You just scared the hell out of me,'  before giving meadow a big hug. 

In 2017 Meadow settled settled a wrongful death lawsuit with Porsche.

The actor star was killed in a car crash in November 2013 while a passenger in a Porsche Carrera GT driven by Roger Rodas - who also died.

According to documents obtained by The Blast, Meadow reached an agreement with Porsche, with both parties requesting the wrongful death case be dismissed.

The terms of the resolution were kept confidential.

She sued the company in 2015, claiming her father had survived the crash initially but was burned alive because he was trapped by his seatbelt.

The lawsuit also claimed Porsche knew the Carrera GT 'had a history of instability and control issues'.  

Law enforcement previously ruled the cause of the crash was speeding at rates between 80mph and 93mph.

The car careered off the road into a concrete lamp post and two trees and burst into flames.
