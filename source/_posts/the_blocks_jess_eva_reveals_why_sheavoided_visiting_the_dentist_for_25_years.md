The Block star Jess Eva has revealed why she refused to visit the dentist for 25 years.

Speaking on Triple M's Moonman In The Morning on Thursday, the reality star said she avoided going to the dentist after a traumatising experience.

'[My horror story with dentists started] in the school dental van. It was a caravan and all the trainee dentists would practice on you,' she explained.

'I went a few weeks ago for the first time in 25 years!' The Block's Jess Eva has revealed the reason why she refused to visit the dentist for 25 years. Pictured left; before her visit and right; after visiting the dentist

'They would say I'd need to extract your tooth and wouldn't numb it properly. I could feel the roots coming out of my gums,' she added.

Jess went on to say:'My last experience was when I went a few weeks ago for the first time in 25 years because even the sound of the drill gets me sweaty.'

She said she still felt anxious visiting the dentist after her traumatising experience 25 years ago.

'The anxiety continues because when I finally did go to the dentist, I looked up at his face and he said "suction" to the nurse,' she explained. 

Jess continued: 'And I thought he said "suck" and I started sucking on his finger and he said "what are you doing?"'

This comes after Jess revealed her and husband Norm Hogan have spent the entire $209,000 prize money they won on The Block just two years ago.

Speaking on Triple M's Moonman In The Morning on Friday, Jess revealed the couple blew the cash on swimming pools, gambling and 'helping out their friends'. 

'The first thing we bought was two above-ground pools... and we handed them out to our friends like lollies,' she said.

'We just had friends who had been wanting a pool for ages... They're $5000 each, so there's $10,000,' she said.

Jess also revealed the couple spent a portion of the prize money betting on a tennis match between Maria Sharapova and Ash Barty.

She also revealed she and Norm paid off a friend's car loan, bought two lawnmowers and even bought a block of land in Queensland's Russell Island.
