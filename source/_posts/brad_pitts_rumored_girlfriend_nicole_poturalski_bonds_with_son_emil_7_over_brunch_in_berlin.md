Peek-a-boo! Two-time Oscar winner Brad Pitt's rumored girlfriend Nicole 'Nico Mary' Poturalski sported a $95 WRSTBHVR royal blue 'Corby' hoodie and matching Prada purse while revealing her 'favorite Sunday activities' in Germany

Nicole Instastoried sugary waffles smothered in a certain sweetened hazelnut cocoa spread with the caption: 'My two weak points when it comes to food - Nutella and [mayonnaise].'

Poturalski then rocked out to John Paul Young's 1977 disco song Love Is in the Air while strolling with her seven-year-old son Emil from her open eight-year marriage to restaurateur Roland Mary.

The Polish-born beauty reportedly met the Oklahoma-born 56-year-old at the 68-year-old father-of-five's restaurant Borchardt where Pitt's Château Miraval 2019 Rosé Provence is sold. 

Nicole and Brad were first spotted publicly canoodling on November 24 when they attended Kanye West's oratorio Nebuchadnezzar together at the Hollywood Bowl.

'Brad thinks Nicole is beautiful and kind,' a source told Us Weekly last Wednesday.

'He has absolutely no plans nor any desire to ever get married again. Brad doesn't want a girlfriend that he's with every day.'

Much ado was made of how the Ad Astra action star jetted Poturalski to his French home Château Miraval on August 23, which would've marked his sixth wedding anniversary to Angelina Jolie had they not split.
