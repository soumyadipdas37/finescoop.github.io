Former Manchester City and Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure has apologised for an 'inappropriate joke' which resulted in him reportedly being dropped from this weekend's Soccer Aid charity game.

A report claims the 37-year-old was asked to leave the team hotel after posting content on a group message chat which offended fellow squad members. 

He reportedly bragged in a WhatsApp group he could get 19 women to their five-star hotel in Cheshire and also allegedly posted a porn video of a naked woman in a bath in the chat on Thursday night.

Toure has admitted his mistake and regrets the negative publicity which has deflected from Sunday's fundraising game for children's charity Unicef at Old Trafford.

'I would like to apologise to everyone involved in Soccer Aid for an inappropriate joke I deeply regret,' he wrote on Twitter.

'It was meant as a joke however I lacked thorough consideration for the feelings of other participants.

'That being said I deleted the jokes within minutes and I immediately apologised to all inside the group.

'We gather for a good cause and this deviates the focus of the game which is to bring everyone together to help children around the world.'

Despite his apology, other players were reportedly 'disgusted' by them and he was still forced off the show. 

The ex-Manchester City midfielder was said to have posted the messages in a Whatsapp made up of his World XI team, with ex-Manchester United defender Patrice Evra among them.

But women's players Julie Fleeting and Lianne Sanderson - as well as singer Chelcee Grimes - were also in the chat.

Toure was reportedly ordered to delete the messages as soon as Unicef and ITV bosses found out and apologise to those in the group.

He was also allegedly told his position in the team was under threat and other players were said to still be seething during breakfast this morning.

Toure added: 'It's sad to see an inappropriate joke I made attract the attention which should be fully devoted to the beauty of the charity game.

'Regardless of the circumstances, I want to take full responsibility. I am a grown man who should not be engaged in such jokes.

'I am very sorry for my mistake and I wish everyone all the best with Soccer Aid on Sunday in raising awareness and funds for important causes.'

Soccer Aid is played every year and sees an England XI side and World XI team - both made up of ex-players and celebrities - face off and raise money for charity.
