Fiona Falkiner is pregnant with her first child after undergoing IVF with her fiancée Hayley Willis. 

The former Biggest Loser host, 37, announced the happy news on Monday, posting a photo of Hayley, 30, cradling her baby bump. 

'It’s official our little family will be gaining a member, baby Falkiner will be joining us in 2021,' model Fiona wrote in the caption.

'We are so excited about this new chapter of being mums together and giving this little bundle all the love in the world! Thank you to everyone who sent us prayers and baby dust, it worked!!!!' 

Meanwhile, journalist Hayley, who proposed to FIona in April 2019 after 10 months of dating, posted the same image with her own heartfelt caption. 

'We did it my love. It’s hard to put into words how incredibly proud I am of you. All of our family dreams are finally coming true,' Hayley began. 

Baby joy! 'It’s official our little family will be gaining a member, baby Falkiner will be joining us in 2021,' model Fiona shared  

'Feeling incredibly blessed and absolutely over the moon to begin this new chapter of our lives. I can’t wait to be a Mumma with you!'  

'Baby Falkiner due March 2021!' she added.  

Fiona and Hayley have been documenting their journey to have children together via their new podcast, What The IVF?  

Baby bliss: 'Feeling incredibly blessed and absolutely over the moon to begin this new chapter of our lives. I can’t wait to be a Mumma with you!' Hayley wrote on her Instagram page 

In one episode, Fiona revealed she'd recently suffered what she thought was a devastating setback after believing she'd taken her hormonal medication at the wrong time. 

She said: 'I just cried all night long. I was filled with complete fear and dread and thought I had put everything in jeopardy after all we had been through. I have never beaten myself up so much'.   

Luckily, the former TV host quickly learned she'd taken the medicine at the right time.

Fiona recently revealed her 'traumatic' and 'lonely' journey in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. 

She told the paper: 'It is you and your body against all odds. Women don't really talk about it until after the fact. It can be really quite traumatic.'  

In the same interview, Hayley revealed that she, too, hopes to carry a baby, shortly after Fiona gives birth. 

Hayley said: 'Fi is going first because she is older. I really want to carry a bub too but Fi will go first just because of the body clock on fertility, so her going first is best.'

Fiona and Hayley became engaged during a romantic trip to Vanuatu last April.

Hayley presented her partner with a diamond ring on a private beach at The Moso resort at sunset.  

The pair have recently since purchased a house together, and are preparing to tie the knot later this year in an intimate ceremony.  

The lovebirds haven't announced a wedding date, but they've previously stated that it will be a 'low-key' affair with friends and family.
