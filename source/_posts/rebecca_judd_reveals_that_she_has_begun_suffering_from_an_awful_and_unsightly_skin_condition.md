She is known for her model looks and flawless beauty. 

But on Tuesday, Rebecca Judd revealed that she recently began suffering from an 'awful' skin condition. 

Speaking on her podcast 3pm Pick Up, the 37-year-old explained that she now gets cold sores.   

Affliction: On Tuesday, Rebecca Judd (pictured) has revealed she has recently started suffering from cold sores 

'I'm a newly cold sore person and it's awful,' she shared.  

Cold sores are blisters that form on the lips or surrounding skin and are caused by a virus, known as herpes simplex (HSV).  

The mother-of-four didn't reveal how she caught the affliction, however it is usually spread through direct physical contact such as kissing or sharing drink containers with someone who has the virus.

Last week, Rebecca indulged her sweet tooth, tucking into three blocks of chocolate.  

The AFL WAG, who is currently in hard lockdown with her family at her $7.3million mansion in Brighton, showed off her enviable haul of chocolate treats on Instagram.

Bec had already tucked into a block of Darrell Lea's new Bondi milk, and was about to munch on some Rocky Road and Caramilk too, washing it all down with a cup of tea.

Rebecca has often spoken about her obsession with Caramilk, and even wowed fans when she made some cookies with the chocolate last month. 

But, while Rebecca loves her sweet treats, she balances her desserts with a healthy lifestyle.  

Back in April, the Postcard presenter explained she's been doing a daily Pilates session from Keep It Cleaner, and posted a demonstration video on her Instagram page.

She said that no equipment was needed and it's perfect for everyone to do while stuck at home while they are self-isolating.
