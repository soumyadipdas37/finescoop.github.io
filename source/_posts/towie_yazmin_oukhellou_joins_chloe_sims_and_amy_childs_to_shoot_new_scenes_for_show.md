Their long-running reality show TOWIE is celebrating its 10-year anniversary.

And Yazmin Oukhellou, Chloe Sims and Amy Childs were spotted out and about in Essex as they shot fresh scenes for the ITVBe favourite on Thursday.

Yazmin, 26, put on a decidedly eye-popping display, stepping out in a deeply plunging grey tie-front top, which she teamed with a pair of light blue jeans.

Accessorising with a long gold pendant necklace and octagonal tinted glasses, the reality star looked tanned and toned as she stepped before cameras.

Boosting her raven locks with matching hair extensions, the TV personality highlighted her good looks with a rich palette of makeup.

Meanwhile, Chloe, 37, also put on a head-turning display, arriving for her day of work in a white crop top, which she teamed high-waisted baggy jeans.

Not to be outdone, Amy teamed a crisp white blouse and indigo skinny jeans with a leopard-print coat, while she added extra height to her frame with nude heels.

A host of other stars were also seen stepping out for a day of filming on the show, including Mario Falcone, Charlie Sims, and Bobby Cole Norris. 

Meanwhile, show original Sam Faiers and her sister Billie were seen arriving at the famous Faces nightclub on Friday morning.

Sam, 29, shot to fame on the ITVBe show as one of the original stars in its 2010 inauguration yet has since claimed she would not return to the screens alongside fellow alums - yet she and Billie are back.

The siblings went for low-key ensembles as they headed to filming yet seemed to be carrying their glad rags in large bags ready to get changed inside. 

Pals: During their stroll, the pair were seen with co-star Mario Falcone and his son, Parker Jax

Prior to filming, Sam insisted: 'I won't be getting involved because, to be honest, it's like I'm at a completely different stage in my life now,' she told The Sun. 'I don't even know what I would do on there any more. 

A representative for ITV told MailOnline: 'We are grateful Sam and Billie were able to take time out of their busy schedules to participate in our special anniversary programme....

'They are hugely popular with the viewers and we all enjoyed laughing at old clips and reminiscing about their time on the show. Viewers can join them in celebrating ten years of TOWIE this Sunday on ITVBe at 9pm.'

Sam herself revealed she was returning to film retrospects, as she detailed her contribution to the anniversary after making the U-turn: 'We're not going back on to the show to film as such but we're doing the 10 year anniversary best bits...

Sam shot to fame in TOWIE in 2010, with her on-off relationship with Mark Wright and her subsequent engagement to Joey Essex making her a show hit. 

Since leaving the show, she has scooped her own reality show, The Mummy Diaries, with her partner Paul Knightley and their kids, Paul, five, and Rosie, two. 

Her friendship with Amy Childs - who is returning for the anniversary - was one of the central elements and won the hearts of many fans.

Despite this, the girls sadly fell out when Amy left the show.

In 2011, Sam said of their now-defunct friendship: 'When she was in Celebrity Big Brother I gave her all the support in the world...

'I put her in my column and tweeted about her constantly. But when the last series of TOWIE started I didn't even get a text or a phone call. I feel very let down...

'TOWIE was a massive thing for both of us, and it would only take one phone call to show we're still friends. We're just not close any more and it's sad.'
