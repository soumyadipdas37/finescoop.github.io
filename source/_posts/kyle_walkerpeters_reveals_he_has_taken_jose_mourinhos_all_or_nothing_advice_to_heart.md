Kyle Walker-Peters has revealed he has taken on board some infamous advice from Jose Mourinho in his bid to impress with Southampton.

The Tottenham boss delighted supporters of all clubs with a recent tirade in Amazon's fly-on-the-wall All or Nothing Documentary, in which he urged his group of players to be 'b******s' and unleash their nasty side.

Walker-Peters departed the club to re-join Saints on a permanent deal this summer, but the enigmatic and frank message from Mourinho appears to have left its mark on him.  

Kyle Walker-Peters revealed he has taken on board some infamous advice from Jose Mourinho

Mourinho urged his Tottenham stars to be 'b*******' in the Amazon All or Nothing documentary

He told The Sun: 'Sometimes you need to be a bit of a b*****d and you need to upset the person who is trying to dominate you.

'It's something I've really developed in my game. In the last seven games of last season I was thinking of ways to be nastier on the pitch.

'Not nasty in terms of going into stupid tackles, but putting my opponent off, or irritating him. The way I like to irritate them is I know they don't like to chase me.

Mourinho was left irritated by the nature of the squad he inherited from Mauricio Pochettino

Walker-Peters has vowed to use aggression to impress after joining Southampton permanently

'So in possession, I'm always running, moving. If I'm on the ball, I'm dribbling. I know wingers hate tracking the full-back. I'm very fit and I can run.

'It doesn't have to be with a tackle, it can be a b*****d in terms of, "I'm going to make you run and have a horrible game".' 

Walker-Peters impressed down Southampton's right flank last season, and earned himself a move to the south coast outfit in a £12million deal.

The right back, who moved from Spurs for £12million, is also hopeful of an England call-up

And with Gareth Southgate having to handle a selection dilemma in most positions ahead of next summer's European Championships, Walker-Peters is hoping he can mount a late push to be included in the squad.   

'The only way of getting into the England team is by playing regularly and performing,' he added.

'I felt I did that towards the end of last season and now I need to continue that and show consistency and then there's no reason why I won't get selected for England.'
