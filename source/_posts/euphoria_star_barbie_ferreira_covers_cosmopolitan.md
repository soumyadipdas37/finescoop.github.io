Euphoria star and model Barbie Ferreira is opening up about her 'crippling anxiety,' 'depression issues, eating issues, paranoias,' and the other 'weird things' she insists are a result of the internet.

The 23-year-old covers the November issue of Cosmopolitan, where she gets candid about mental health — and the pressures and world events that have negatively impacted her generation.

'As an elder Gen Z, we’ve gotten our fair share of bad times,' she said. 'I mean, my first day of kindergarten was 9/11. We were the guinea pigs of the internet — you’re 11, and the darkness of the entire world is just packed into your computer and you’re scrolling through it.

'As an elder Gen Z, we’ve gotten our fair share of bad times,' she said. 'I mean, my first day of kindergarten was 9/11. We were the guinea pigs of the internet'

'That had to do something to my brain,' she went on.

'I mean, I got crippling anxiety. A lot of depression issues, eating issues, paranoias, and just weird things that I’m one thousand per cent certain are from the internet.'

The star also admitted to working through a Juul addiction. 

'I don’t know if we’re designed to do that... to chat online with strangers when you’re nine. God knows who I was talking to,' she said.

Feeling things deeply, though, may have helped her career. Barbie says she was an 'emotional' and 'empathetic' kid, which led her to acting.

Fun! These days, she said, an addiction to the game Animal Crossing takes up a lot of her time online

These days, she said, an addiction to the game Animal Crossing takes up a lot of her time online — so much that if she didn't create structure for herself, she'd be up playing at 4 a.m. 

But having a fun, mindless hobby may be just what she needs to keep her mind of more serious issues plaguing the country. 

Barbie said that in the past four years, the country has become a more 'hateful' place, which has contributed to a lot of 'sadness' and 'mental neuroses,' particularly in younger people. 

'In the years since Trump was elected, I’ve noticed how popular very, very hateful beliefs are,' she said. 

'It’s a disservice to oneself to think that everyone thinks the way you do. It’s more apparent now than ever in my life that I am living in a different world than a lot of people.

'We think we’re the greatest country, we think we’re perfect, we think we’re the land of the free, but inherently, we’re not. We’re disillusioned about the country. 

'I think that’s where Gen Z gets a lot of the angst and the sadness and the mental neuroses. We still haven’t reckoned with this.' 

In the interview — which hits  newsstands on October 13 — Barbie also discussed her role in the new film Unpregnant, a comedy about abortion. 

'Normalizing abortion is what we have to do,' she said.

'Society puts this pressure on people who are getting abortions, that they should feel a lot of guilt and shame and really emotional about it. Most people are just relieved.'

On TV: Barbie plays Kat Hernandez on the HBO show Euphoria

Showing up: On September 9, she attended the premiere of the film, a drive-in event hosted by HBO Max in Glendale, California

On September 9, she attended the premiere of the film, a drive-in event hosted by HBO Max in Glendale, California.

She wore a blue watercolor dress for the occasion, which she smartly accessorized with a protective face mask.

Face masks may make doing makeup a bit easier, but the star still fully embraced cosmetics, adding extra glamour with blue eyeshadow and long lashes.
