Police are investigating after Love Island star Jack Fincham and other party-goers shared pictures and videos on social media of a packed party on Bank Holiday Monday.

Hundreds of revellers ignored social distancing rules at a £120 a ticket party held in a marquee set up by The Swan Pub in West Maling, Kent.

Social media posts shared by Jack clearly showed party-goers ignoring rules by hugging and kissing and dancing together.

Ex On The Beach star Youssef Hassane also shared several videos from the gathering at the 'Wings of the field' in London Road, Wrotham, Kent, from 1pm to 8.30pm on Monday.

In a comment on one clip he wrote: 'All like minded people loving life and not a single mask in sight.'

Organisers, The Swan pub in West Malling, Kent, claimed the event that cost £120 a ticket would be following social distancing guidelines.  

The shindig led to a backlash of criticism from people in the county for its lack of social distancing and now Kent Police and Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council are investigating the event.

Social, not distant! The Love Island personality, 26, decided to film the event and upload around 10 Instagram Stories on Monday afternoon and evening, as he and his friends attended the BBQ and disco held at The Swan in West Malling, Kent

The local authority, which granted permission for the event, confirmed rules were breached.

A spokesman for the council said: 'The event details and risk assessment shared with us and Kent Police did not give rise to concerns.

'Media coverage of the event, however, does indicate that the measures agreed were not followed and that rules were breached.

'We are now working closely with Kent Police who are leading on the investigation and will be taking appropriate action.'

Flouting the rules! The Swan threw a huge event - charging revelers £120 each for the pleasure - promising to adhere to social distancing and the pandemic public safety guidelines

Police confirmed patrols attended the party to 'remind people about social distancing'.

Spokesman Andy Saunders said: 'We were aware of an event held in a marquee in Wrotham on Monday which had permission to take place under a Temporary Event Notice.

'During the event, patrols attended the venue to remind people about social distancing advice and encourage them to adhere to COVID-19 regulations.   

Jack has since deleted a string of Instagram posts from the party. 

The Swan had posted the following message to Facebook ahead of the event: 'Your tables will be positioned 2 metres apart and you will be allowed to dance at your tables only'

The pub has also removed all traces of the event from their Facebook page, which had previously advertised the party with a picture of a marquee and balloons and details of the food, drink and music.

The Swan charged revelers £120 each for the pleasure - promising to adhere to social distancing and the pandemic public safety guidelines.

It posted the following message ahead of the event: 'Your tables will be positioned 2 metres apart and you will be allowed to dance at your tables only.

'There won't be a dance floor and we ask that you don't form the conga at any point.

Breaking the rules: 'There won't be a dance floor and we ask that you don't form the conga at any point. We will be adhering to COVID-19 guidelines and expect everyone joining us to do the same, if our rules are followed we will stay healthy and safe,' was also promised by The Swan

'We will be adhering to COVID-19 guidelines and expect everyone joining us to do the same, if our rules are followed we will stay healthy and safe.'

Yet Jack's social media posts saw him kissing an unknown brunette woman on the cheek while they partied under the marquee, hugging his friends as they drank and dancing with a mass of people as night fell.

Caution: Police confirmed patrols attended the party to 'remind people about social distancing' 

The party - which featured food, a DJ, tables intended for no more than eight people, and unlimited alcohol - comes after new rules to crack down on mass gatherings came into force on Friday - leading to £90,000-worth of fines issued by Sunday night.

The regulations - with were put in place ahead of the bank holiday weekend - gives police the power to hand out £10,000 fines. 

Current government guidelines state people from different households can meet in an outdoor space in a group of up to six. It is also acceptable for people to meet in a  a group of two households in any location. 

Criticism: The local authority, which granted permission for the event, confirmed rules were breached 

Sarah Richards complained to police on social media about the party, saying: 'Please tell me how this is allowed and yet my lovely friends who have wanted to get married for two years have had to postpone their wedding twice this year as they can't have more than 30 guests?'

While other brides have fumed about the bar's event during a pandemic which has seen them forced to postpone their weddings.

Kirsty Mayle criticised the Love Island winner Jack Fincham and others who were seen at the party, saying it was 'a slap in the face' to brides.

The 29-year-old was set to marry her partner in Kent but had to rearrange due to coronavirus restrictions, limiting numbers to just 30 - including staff at the venue.

Musical chairs! The promise to keep attendees to their own tables had, evidently, been abandoned by this point

She said: 'We have postponed our wedding twice now after being told last week that we could marry in a register office, but my dad wouldn't be able to walk me down the aisle, our vows would be shortened to only include legal parts and guests were not permitted to speak to each other inside the venue.. Then a reception would not include any music and [everyone is] seated at all times.

'Not only does this event make me angry as a bride it makes me angry as a local resident to this pub, while others are struggling to keep their hospitality business afloat and keeping in line with guidelines these organisers have shown a real greedy side to themselves.

'Love Island stars are paid to promote track and trace yet are promoting a rave event without social distancing. It's a joke and complete slap in the face to brides and the wedding industry.'  

The Swan has been approached by MailOnline for comment.
