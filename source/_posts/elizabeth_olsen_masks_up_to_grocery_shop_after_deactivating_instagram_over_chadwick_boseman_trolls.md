Independent Spirit Award nominee Elizabeth Olsen went grocery shopping at Whole Foods in her native Sherman Oaks on Thursday alongside her fiancé, Milo Greene singer Robbie Arnett.

The 31-year-old actress and the 28-year-old musician - both rocking Birkenstock-style sandals - stocked up on food as well as a case of Mountain Valley spring water.

Elizabeth made sure to protect herself and others from the coronavirus by wearing a cloth mask, which California Governor Gavin Newsom made mandatory for all public outings on June 18.

As of Thursday, there have been over 244K confirmed COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County, which has lead to 5,888 deaths - according to Johns Hopkins University.

Last month, Olsen spoke at length of the garden she, Arnett, and their landscape designer Heather Trilling planted in their backyard.

'The garden reminded me there was always something to look forward to even in the smallest moments,' the Sorry for Your Loss producer-star told THR magazine.

'I was reminded by my friends' kids, who would visit my fiance, Robbie Arnett, and me in our backyard, social distancing, of course. And we would walk around picking and eating tomatoes, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and bagging up lemons for the road.

'This magic and simple joy an ever-changing garden can bring is a constant reminder for me, of my gratitude for our health and my hope for the future.'

Elizabeth's sighting came two days after she mysteriously deactivated her Instagram account reportedly after trolls went after her for not publicly mourning the death of her Avengers: Endgame castmate Chadwick Boseman.
