They went through a sticky patch in their marriage a couple of years ago.

But it seems that Jennie Garth and Dave Abrams have their relationship back on track as the couple enjoyed a shopping trip together on Tuesday in LA.

The two were snapped leaving a store in Pasadena, California, after picking up some purchases.

Garth, who found fame as Kelly on Beverly Hills, 90210, was dressed in a long gray shirt left loose over black cycling shorts and stepped out in black sneakers.

The actress wore her blonde hair tied back from her face and she sported spectacles and a purple cloth face mask.

Abrams, 39, an actor, wore a black t-shirt and shorts with black and white trainers. 

He had on a green peaked cap, black-framed spectacles and knotted a bandana around his face as a covering.

Garth and Abrams began dating in fall 2014  following the actress' divorce from second husband Peter Facinelli the previous year. 

They became engaged in April 2015 and exchanged vows in July that year.  

However, they separated in 2017 and in April 2018 they filed for divorce. But then in February 2019, they got back together and had the divorce proceedings dismissed.

In an interview with People, Gary had explained: 'Dave and I fell in love really fast and got married within six months,' Garth said. 'We rushed it too much, and that hurt us.'

Garth, who was married to first husband, musician Daniel B. Clark from 1994 to 1996, told the publication that the thought of going through a third divorce 'really devastated me.' 

She told People: 'We definitely had to just part ways completely. And just when I felt whole again, we started hanging out. He needed to go away and figure everything out.' 

She added: 'Marriage is not like a fairy tale. It's a process, and it's about continuously wanting to make it better.'
