RuPaul won the the Emmy Award for Outstanding Host For A Reality Or Competition Program for a record fifth time in a row for his work on RuPaul's Drag Race.

The 59-year-old host set a new record for the most victories in the category’s 13-year history with his win Saturday on the fifth and final night of the virtual 2020 Creative Arts Emmy Awards.

In his acceptance speech, RuPaul, full name RuPaul Andre Charles, dedicated the win to the late Chi Chi DeVayne, and urged fans to get out and vote in the upcoming general election.

'On behalf of VH1, World of Wonder, and our incredible cast and crew, I want to thank the Academy for this great honor. I've always said, every time I bat my false eyelashes, I'm making a political statement. Well, tonight, the only political statement I want to make is this: Love,' RuPaul said in his victory speech.

'Love for our LGBT brothers and sisters, love for Black queens and brown queens, and love for the United States of America, where a little gay boy with nothing more than a pussycat wig and a dream can build an international platform that celebrates sweet, sensitive souls everywhere,' he added.

He then encouraged people to vote on November 3.

'I'd like to dedicate this Emmy to one of my girls, Chi Chi DeVayne, may you rest in power and perfection,' RuPaul said before concluding his remarks.

Award dedication: In his acceptance speech, RuPaul, full name RuPaul Andre Charles, dedicated the win to the late Chi Chi DeVayne, shown in 2016 in New York City at the season eight premiere of RuPaul's Drag Race
