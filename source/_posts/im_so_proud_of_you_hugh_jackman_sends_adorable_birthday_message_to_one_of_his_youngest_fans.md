Hugh Jackman made an adorable video for one of his youngest fans on Tuesday. 

The Hollywood star shared a clip to Instagram in which he wishes a young girl called Julia a happy birthday. 

The 51-year-old said in the video: 'Hi Julia! I am so proud of you for concentrating, you're doing so well. I am going to practice hard today too.'

The actor then went on to quote P. T. Barnum, who Hugh played in the 2017 film, The Greatest Showman. 

'Like P. T. Barnum said, no one made a difference by being like anyone else. Happy birthday,' Hugh said. 

He then shared a second clip, which showed gorgeous little Julia saying the word 'concentrate' and pointing to her chin.

In the video, the toddler explains that she learned that word 'from Hugh Jackman' as well as Sesame Street character, Elmo. 

Hugh wrote in his caption for both clips: 'Hi Julia. I'm so proud of you. Keep concentrating! I love Elmo too. Happy birthday! Love Hugh.' 

It comes after a successful week for the Australian star, who is celebrating the Emmy win for his latest film, Bad Education.
