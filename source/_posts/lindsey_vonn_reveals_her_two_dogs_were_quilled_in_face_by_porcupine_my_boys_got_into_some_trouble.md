'They ran out of the house and chased after a porcupine... as boys do. Incredibly thankful that they are ok.'

She went on to acknowledge her family, friends and medical experts who helped her precious pooches.

Lindsey wrote: 'I also greatly appreciate my family and friends for helping them make it home safe and the love and care that they got from White Pine Vet You guys are the best!'

Lindsey definitely has a passion for canines as last month it was announced that she and one of her other dogs Lucy were hosting reality TV adventure show The Pack.

Vonn and her dog Lucy are hosting the unscripted series, which celebrates the bond between people and their canine companions.

The Pack will follow 12 human/animal duos as they travel around the world and compete for a $500k personal prize and $250k to their animal charity of choice.

The Amazon Studios produced show was filmed earlier this year and is set for release later in 2020.

During production the show donated $250k to across charities from each country they visited.

Lindsey said she was thrilled to do the show because of her own love of dogs.

'I have overcome many obstacles in life, but one thing that has reigned true during good times and bad has been the love of my dogs,' said Lindsey Vonn.

'Like many times before, Lucy will be by my side on yet another one of life's adventures, and I'm excited for everyone to watch and cheer on these incredible contestants and their beloved companions.
