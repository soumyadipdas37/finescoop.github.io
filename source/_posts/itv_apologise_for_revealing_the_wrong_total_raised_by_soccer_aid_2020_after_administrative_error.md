ITV have issued an apology after revealing the wrong total raised by Soccer Aid 2020.

Following the the annual celebrity charity match on Sunday, it was announced that the donations had amounted to a record total of £11.5 million.

However, taking to Twitter on Tuesday, ITV admitted that due to an 'administrative error', the total was in fact two million less at £9.3 million. 

Big mistake: ITV have issued an apology after revealing the wrong total raised by Soccer Aid 2020

The broadcaster was quick to ensure that the total raised was still the highest in the event's history.

A tweet shared by the ITV press centre read: 'Last Sunday’s Soccer Aid event was watched by millions on ITV whose donations contributed to a record fundraising total which will help Unicef provide a better start in life for young people in need across the world. 

'Regrettably, due to an administrative error within ITV, the total figure raised of £11.5m announced on air by ITV at the end of Sunday night’s Soccer Aid for Unicef was incorrect. 

Whoops: Following the the annual celebrity charity match on Sunday, it was announced that the donations had amounted to a record total of £11.5 million

'The total amount of money raised by the end of the show as £9.3m. This is still the largest sum raised in Soccer Aid for Unicef history – beating the £6.7m raised in 2019.' 

The message continued: 'ITV would like to apologise fully for this error, which should not detract from the commitment made by all those involved, including Unicef, the players, coaching staff, production and all supporting partners, as well as the huge generosity of the public, who we would like to thank again for making the event such a success.

'As previously planned, all donation platforms will remain open until Tuesday 6th October and ITV will continue to promote the event on air and online to deliver the highest possible final total.' 

Big error: However, taking to Twitter on Tuesday, ITV admitted that due to an 'administrative error', the total was in fact two million less at £9.3 million

Following the originally announced wrong total, celebrities such as host Kirsty Gallacher and player Ore Oduba shared their jubilation at the £11. 5 million raised. 

The highly popular match saw team England lose out after team Rest of the World beat them on penalties.

The charity game saw famous faces such as Mark Wright, Marvin Humes, Olly Murs, Joe Wicks, Joel Dommett, Paddy McGuinness, Alfie Allen, James Bay, Chunkz, Liv Cooke, John Bishop, Danny Jones, Yung Filly and Tom Davis play for England.
