Sam Thompson is doing his best to move on from his ex girlfriend Zara McDermott.

The Made In Chelsea star was pictured enjoying a night out in London on Saturday with a stunning mystery woman, just over a week after his split from Zara was confirmed. 

As photos of Sam leaving the Amazonico restaurant with the pretty brunette emerged, Zara took to Instagram to share a poignant quote, admitting 'we all make mistakes.'

Sam wore a black T-shirt with matching skinny jeans and brown Chelsea boots for his night out while his female companion was chic in a cream coat layered over a mini dress and teamed with heels.

The pair left the restaurant together and were spotted sharing a conversation outside. 

Sam returned to his London home over the weekend after spending a few days in Suffolk with his sister and MIC co-star Louise and her boyfriend Ryan Libbey. 

Zara was also spotted out in London on Saturday night, hitting Novikov restaurant in Mayfair with some friends.

The ex Love Island star has been keeping busy with her own friends but alluded to her single status with a post on her Instagram Stories on Monday morning.

Zara shared a quote from US motivational speaker Steve Maraboli which read: 'We all make mistakes, have struggles, and even regret things in our past. But you are not your mistakes, you are not your struggles, and you are here NOW with the power to shape your day and your futute.'

She wrote alongside the quote: 'I look at so many quotes online every day and they make me feel less alone. If you are going through a hard time. I have found that this really helps.'

While Zara has yet to publicly confirm or deny claims she cheated on former beau Sam, 28, she has been sharing cryptic quotes on social media. 

The singer wrote earlier this week on her Instagram Stories: 'Your heart knows the way, run in that direction.

Love always won in the end. No matter how it happened, no matter what it took, no matter what it meant. Fair or not, true or not. Love won.'

Pals? Sam and his companion were in close conversation outside the plush restaurant

Adding a sad face emoji, Zara's second post then stated: 'We have all hurt someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident. We have all loved someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident. 

'It is an intrinsic human trait, and a deep responsibility, I think, to be an organ and a blade. But, learning to forgive ourselves and others because we have not chosen wisely is what makes us most human. 

'We make horrible mistakes, it's how we learn. We breathe love, it's how we learn, and it is inevitable.'

A source revealed to MailOnline that a tryst took place between Zara and 'someone in the music industry' around the time she took part in X Factor: Celebrity.

The reality star appeared on the series last summer and autumn, as part of the Love Island pop group No Love Lost.

At this point, she had been in a relationship with Sam for several months – but it's said the newly-single star has only recently found out about the infidelity. 

A source told MailOnline: 'Zara cheated on Sam with someone in the music industry. Someone connected to the X Factor.

'Sam is obviously distraught about this. He only found out about it very recently and has escaped for a few days. 

'Zara regrets it and feels terrible. She knows it was a huge mistake and is extremely upset.

'Zara and Sam split towards the end of last month. They had been arguing a lot since moving in together as a result of lockdown and things just built up between them.

'Zara has moved back to her parents' house in Essex where she's taking some time for herself, she really loved Sam so this hasn't been easy for her.

'Sam has gone away to have a break from it all and clear his head away from Zara and social media.' 

MailOnline contacted representatives for Zara and Sam for comment at the time.
