This is the incredible moment a paraglider is in perfect symmetry with his reflection while spiralling over a lake in Austria.  

Helmut Eichholzer, 44, had been paragliding with a group of friends at Bischling Werfenweng in Salzburg when he was able to execute a ground spiral above a crystal clear lake. 

Mr Eichholzer, from Kuchi, Salzburg, grazed the surface of the waters with the tip of his wing to form a perfectly aligned reflection of himself in the lake before landing just seconds later.

During the clip, which was filmed by fellow pilot Roland Brunnbauer on September 5, the paraglider swirls over the lake and carefully manoeuvers his equipment so that he and his reflection are in perfect symmetry.

He then lightly touches the water with the tip of his wing before landing in the water. 

Mr Eichholzer said: 'A photographer invited some Austrian top pilots for a photo shooting early morning sunrise.

'Therefore, we meet up in the late evening on the peak of Bischling. We made a fire, had a nice evening together and slept in our sleeping bags.

'We had about six pilots and started with our glider from our sleeping place in 15 minute intervals. Everybody tried to do a spiral and touch the water with the wing tip. It looks easier than it is.

'I had the perfect feeling with my 'Ozone ZeoliteGT glider' and could do the wing touch in a perfect way.

'My focus right after the wing touch was to swim as fast as possible to the bank. The water was quite cold.

'If I entangled with the lines of the glider, it would be really dangerous! For safety reasons we had a stand up paddle placed on the bank.

'In retrospect, it was worth the effort and risk.'
