A woman who asked two handsome male police officers to take off their clothes when they turned up to shutdown her party told the shocked officers they were the 'worst strippers ever' when they refused.

Jess Griff recorded herself and the two NSW Police officers on TikTok after they showed up at her front door following a noise complaint 

'Cops rocked up to my house for a siblings 18th cause of a noise complaint, they said "party on guys",' she captioned the video.

Ms Griff appeared to be in high spirits and complimented the officers on their good looks when they showed up at her front door. 

'Hot boys, yeah the absolute boys came to the party,' she said laughing into the camera. 

Ms Griff then tells them, 'You guys are the worst strippers I've ever paid for aye', as they chuckle at her. 

Ms Griff continues to record the herself telling one of the officers to 'get your gear off' while his colleague laughs in the background.

She then moves her hand towards their gun in the holster asking them 'what they're going to do' if she were to touch it. 

'Yeah the boys get with it,' she once again says as she places her arm around the other officer as he announces their departure. 

In a second clip, the pair tell the group to 'keep the noise down or we'll have to come back'. 

Ms Griff's video has been watched more than 654,000 times on the popular social media app and received close to 100,000 likes

'Only in Australia,' another wrote.

However, others slammed Ms Griff for her comments towards the officers asking what would have happened if the roles were reversed. 

'Imagine if a male did this to a female officer. Your reactions would be different,' one commented.

'Now imagine the uproar if the roles were reversed,' another wrote.
