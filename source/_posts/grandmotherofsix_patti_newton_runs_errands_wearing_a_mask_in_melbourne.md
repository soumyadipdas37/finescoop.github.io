Patti Newton recently became a grandmother for the sixth time.

And the TV legend was spotted out and about in coronavirus-stricken Melbourne on Thursday while wearing a protective face mask.

Patti, 75, wrapped up warm in a winter coat and patterned blouse, which she teamed with blue leggings.

Patti was seen parking her car outside her home and entering the front gate, after running errands in the suburb.

Melburnians must stay within five kilometres of their homes when venturing out for necessary goods and services, due to the state's stage-four lockdown.

Last month, Patti and Bert Newton's daughter, Lauren, gave birth to her sixth child.

Lauren announced the happy news on August 21, sharing a photo to Instagram of her husband, champion swimmer Matt Welsh, holding their newborn son.

The couple named their son Alby James Newton Welsh.

For much of her pregnancy, Lauren had been separated from her five children, Sam, 11, Eva, nine, Lola, six, Monty, two, and Perla, 19 months, due to a health issue.

She revealed on August 25 that she was finally leaving hospital after 80 nights.
