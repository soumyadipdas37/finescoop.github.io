As The Bachelor finale grows closer, it's starting to look like previously rumoured 'winner' Bella Varelis won't be Locky Gilbert's final lady after-all. 

On Wednesday, Bella's mother left an explosive comment on Instagram that could spoil the ending of the entire series. 

In the process of defending her daughter, Bella's mother has seemingly proved the marketing consultant, 25, isn't dating Locky.

Bella's mother, Kim Cutajar, couldn't resist sharing a show of support to her daughter after she was painted in a less-than-favourable light on Wednesday's episode.

'Beautiful girl, very proud of you for speaking out and standing your ground. I’m sure the truth about what happened will come out soon. Love mum xx,' she wrote.

The cryptic message insinuated there was more to the story playing out on screen and hinted Bella doesn't end up with Locky after the finale.

In August, footage was posted of Bella getting emotional while watching her red carpet arrival alongside her friends and family at a private Bachelor premiere viewing party in Sydney.

The marketing professional was seen holding back tears as she watched the first episode, as her mother, Kim, sobbed into a tissue beside her.  

As a potential early clue Bella was not going to win the competition, a friend captioned footage from the viewing party at the time: 'We are all so proud of you.'

In another sign Bella won't be the last woman standing, the rumoured frontrunner has been flaunting her friendship with fellow contestant Bec Cvilikas - something winners rarely do.  

Victorian nurse Irena Srbinovska, 31, is currently the hot contender on the betting apps.
