National carrier Qantas has ended its 30-year sponsorship of Rugby Australia, saying 'this pandemic has been the undoing'. 

Qantas' chief customer officer Stephanie Tully issued a statement on Wednesday announcing the long-running partnership was over. 

'In an environment where thousands of our people have lost jobs and thousands more are stood down while they wait for flying to restart, we can't maintain these sponsorships in the way we have in the past,' Ms Tully said. 

'While we're dealing with this crisis and its aftermath, the cash cost of our sponsorships has to be zero.

'Qantas has had a very long association with Rugby Australia and the Wallabies, and we've stuck with each other during difficult times. Unfortunately, this pandemic has been the undoing.' 

More to come.
