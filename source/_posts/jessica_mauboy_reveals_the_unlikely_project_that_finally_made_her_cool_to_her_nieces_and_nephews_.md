She's been a pop star for years, but Jessica Mauboy confessed her nieces and nephews have only recently started to think of her as being 'cool'.

In an interview with The Daily Telegraph on Thursday, the 31-year-old revealed it took her rapping to a series of kids' books to win the approval of the younger members of her family.

'Now I am relevant,' she joked.

Jess recorded rap songs set to the stories of Pig the Pug and Dharma the Llama as part of a collaborative project with retailer Big W.   

'It was hilarious when I told them. I played it to my family and tested it on my nieces and nephews and now I am cool apparently,' she added. 

'They've read these books in class and now Aunty Jess is reading them, so they think it is cool. It makes me smile.'

Jess said she hoped the recordings would inspire kids to pick up a book and start reading again. 

And after announcing her engagement to longtime boyfriend Themeli Magripilis in October last year, Jess revealed she's been feeling pressure to have children of her own.

In an interview with Who magazine in October last year, Jess confessed both hers and Themeli's families have been asking when they'll have kids.

'My sisters always say, "When are we going to have a little Jess or little Themeli running around?"' she said.

'And Them's parents are getting much older and they're like, "When are you going to have a baby? I want to have a little grandson or granddaughter."'

She added: 'They're freaking me out!'  

'It was hilarious when I told them. I played it to my family and tested it on my nieces and nephews and now I am cool apparently,' she said of her latest musical project
