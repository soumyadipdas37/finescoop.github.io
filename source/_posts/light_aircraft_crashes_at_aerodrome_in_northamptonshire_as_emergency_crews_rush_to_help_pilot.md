Emergency crews are at the scene of a plane crash following a mock dogfight between British and German World War 1 aircrafts.

A triplane, bearing RAF insignia, is said to have spun out of control and hurtled nose down into Sywell aerodrome in Northamptonshire.

It is understood that a practice display was being held before the tragedy unfolded.

A pilot told MailOnline: 'The whole airfield has been closed down.

'There were German biplanes and triplanes bearing the Iron Cross insignia battling it out with their British rivals when the British plane crashed.

'Some of the planes are replicas, some are originals which have been lovingly restored.'

The flyers are a group of enthusiasts who formed The Great War display team.

A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said: 'We were called about it at 11.50am and are working with other emergency services at the scene including Fire, EMAS and the Air Ambulance.

'One person (the pilot) is currently being treated at the scene for their injuries.'
