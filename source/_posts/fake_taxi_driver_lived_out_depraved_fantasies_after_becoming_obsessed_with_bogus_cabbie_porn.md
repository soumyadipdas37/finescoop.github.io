A predator who posed as a taxi driver to prey on drunk women before sexually assaulting them in his car, has been jailed for 30 months. 

Atila Ardic, 25, was disqualified and had hired a car from an online rental service by posing as his mother in order to carry out his fantasies.

He attacked his first victim after picking her up as she drunkenly tried to hail an Uber home from a Christmas party in Covent Garden on 8 December, 2017.

She woke up in the backseat to find Ardic forcing himself on her before she fled to her home, where her boyfriend found her bruised and crying.

Ardic drove to a garage immediately after and helped himself to a packet of cigarettes using the victim’s card, which she had dropped in her hurry to escape.

He struck again the following evening, preying upon another woman on her way home from a party who fell asleep before waking to find his hand under her clothing.

He hurled abuse at the victim as she broke free, calling her a ‘f***ing b***h’ before she escaped and reported the ordeal to police.

Atila Ardic, a sexual predator who posed as a mini cab driver to carry out two sexual assaults on vulnerable women who were on nights out, has now been jailed for two and a half years

When he was arrested Ardic had ‘fake taxi driver’ porn on his phone and had been looking at the films before he attacked women.

Ardic claimed he had carried out the abuse because of ‘feelings of inadequacy’ about not having a girlfriend, Wood Green Crown Court heard.     

Judge John Dodd QC said  the first victim believed Ardic had been trying to rape her.

He added: ‘The facts are deeply concerning frankly.  

‘[The first victim] fell asleep and woke to find you in the backseat with her trying to sexually assault her.

‘This was a sexual assault that came to an end only because she was able to fight you off.

‘This must have been terrifying. She didn’t start the evening in an injured state and by the time it came to an end she had bruising.

‘She dropped her purse. You remarkably having conceded defeat, drove off immediately to a garage and at her expense bought a package of cigarettes and then drove home.’ 

Judge Dodd went on: ‘You didn’t stop there. The following day you did exactly the same thing cruising the streets looking for [the next] victim... who fell into your grasp.

‘The only reason you were out in the small hours of the morning was to find suitable victims.

‘There was abuse of trust - both of these women believed they were getting into legitimate cabs.

‘You effectively took these girls to assault them from a public place. You had been looking on your phone at porn sites and porn films focusing on this particular genre of the fake cab driver assaulting women.

‘The whole gravity of this case is that you were masquerading as a cab driver assaulting vulnerable women.’

Ardic told Wood Green Crown Court he carried out attacks because of ‘feelings of inadequacy’

Ardic, from Finsbury Park, admitted two counts of sexual assault and theft and fraud by false representation in relation to stealing the first woman’s purse.

He shut his eyes as he was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for the ‘absolutely horrible’ offences. 

He was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment and placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register.
