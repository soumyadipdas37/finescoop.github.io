Sky drama Brassic has started filming for a brand new third series.

Cast and crew were seen on location in Lancashire - with those on set donning face masks and protective plastic visors before cameras started rolling.

Notably absent was Michelle Keegan, one of the stars of the show, who didn't appear to be needed for the scenes shot on Monday morning.

A new addition to the cast was spotted, in the form of a cute French bulldog, who was seen peeking out of actor and co-creator Joe Gilgun's backpack.

He was seen with a face mask on - albeit not around his face - as he got his make-up touched-up before shooting the new scenes.

Tom Hanson was spotted sheltering under a blue umbrella, looking jovial, despite having a large plastic visor attached to his head.

Aaron Heffernan was taking no chances, sporting a visor as well as a mask - designed in the colours of an Irish flag.

The third season was confirmed in June, when Michelle - who plays Erin - took to Instagram to celebrate the series two finale.

Shooting had not been able to start on the third run of episodes, due to the COVID-19 lockdown this summer.

Michelle, 33, shared snaps from behind-the-scenes of the Sky show, larking around with her castmates.

She posed with the likes of co-stars Ryan Sampson, Parth Thakerar, Damien Molony and Joanna Higson.
