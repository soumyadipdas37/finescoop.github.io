Taylor Hill was among the glamorous arrivals on the red carpet for the opening ceremony of the socially distanced 77th Venice Film Festival.

The model, 24, looked stunning in a cut-out skin-baring gown as she attended the Lacci red carpet in the Italian city on Wednesday evening.

Taylor cut an elegant figure in the paisley print dress in hues of pink and purple, which she adorned with a selection of dazzling jewels.

Taylor wore her brunette locks up in a chic plaited up do, while enhancing her striking features with a heavy pallet of make-up in bronze tones. 

The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It starts on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.

Though the event is still taking place, it is a markedly toned down affair to previous years amid the coronavirus crisis, with temperature checks and mask wearing becoming mandatory.
