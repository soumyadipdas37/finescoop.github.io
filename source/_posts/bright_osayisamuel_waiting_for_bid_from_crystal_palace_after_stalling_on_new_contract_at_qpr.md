Queens Park Rangers winger Bright Osayi-Samuel is hoping Crystal Palace make a bid for him this summer, according to reports.

The 22-year-old has been linked with a move to Selhurst Park in recent days and has stalled on signing a new deal at QPR.

Sky Sports are now reporting that Osayi-Samuel is waiting for Palace to firm up their interest to sign him before the window shuts next month, given that he can depart for less than £5million this summer.

The report adds Palace have been monitoring him for more than 12 months now and have already raided QPR this summer after signing Eberechi Eze for £19.5m.

The Championship side want Osayi-Samuel to sign an improved deal to stop him leaving for the Premier League on the cheap, while also believing the right-sided player needs another year with them.

Osayi-Samuel was the subject of two bids from Belgian side Club Brugge this summer, the second of which was accepted by QPR, but the player himself turned down the move.

QPR took up the option to extend his contract by 12 months earlier this year, but that means he will become a free agent next summer if he continues to stall on a new deal.

The report adds they would be open to selling now if he could be loaned back for this season.

Palace meanwhile are also reportedly interested in signing Jeremie Boga as a replacement for Wilfried Zaha, who is determined to leave Palace this summer and has attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and Monaco.
