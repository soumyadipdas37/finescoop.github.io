Less than 24 hours after making Emmy history on Sunday night, Zendaya was congratulated by her Euphoria co-star and ex-boyfriend Jacob Elordi.

The 24-year-old actress (real name: Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman) became the youngest to win the Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series award for her portrayal of Rue in HBO's Euphoria.

She was also just the second Black woman to win in that category, following Viola Davis' win for playing Annalise Keating in How To Get Away With Murder, with Elordi, 23, taking to his Instagram story to honor her.

Elordi shared a photo of Zendaya with the caption 'Congratulations captain @zendaya' with a black heart emoji, followed by 'Bravo' and a purple heart emoji.

Zendaya has yet to publicly respond to Elordi's congratulatory message on social media at this time.

Zendaya's win was even more impressive considering who she beat out for the coveted award.

The actress was going up against Jennifer Aniston (The Morning Show), Olivia Colman (The Crown), last year's winner Jodie Comer (Killing Eve), Laura Linney (Ozark) and Sandra Oh (Killing Eve).

Zendaya plays Rue Bennett on HBO's Euphoria, a teenager who spent her summer in a treatment program trying to get sober, as she comes home for a new school year.

Elordi played local jock hero Nate Jacobs, who often clashes with Rue and her new best friend Jules (Hunter Schafer).
