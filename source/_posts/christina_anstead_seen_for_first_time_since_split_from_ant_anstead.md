Christina Anstead was seen heading out in Los Angeles by herself on Monday.

Wearing all dark colors, the 37-year-old blonde beauty from Anaheim, California kept her head down as she held on to a green smoothie while carrying a take-out lunch in a brown paper bag.

This is the first time the Flip Or Flop star has been seen since announcing she and  husband Ant Anstead are separating.

Anstead had on a black T-shirt partially tucked into her skintight dark denim jeans with a rip in one leg and a pair of heavy lace-up military boots with a thick sole.

She had on dark sunglasses and her hair nicely coiffed with several beaded bracelets on her wrists and a black manicure.

A black Louis Vuitton purse hung from her shoulder and was open. She also had on a long necklace with a large crystal pendant. Hoop earrings rounded out her street style.

Meanwhile, on Sunday Christina's ex Tarek El Moussa boasted about how happy he is with 33-year-old fiancee Heather Rae Young of Selling Sunset fame.

Tarek went as far as to say he was having a 'dream' life with Young.

The two are now decorating their new home in Newport Beach, California after getting engaged in July.

'I think we found the perfect couch for the new house today!! Okay...it may not seem exciting but to me it really is! We also found a ton of other stuff and I can’t wait to show you!' he said.

He and his future wife were sitting on a sofa. 

Tarek then added: 'I don’t know...I’m just so excited about life!! I’m in love, I’m engaged, Flipping 101 is on the air and Flip or Flop is on the way. I’m telling you...it’s possible to accomplish those things you have been dreaming of. I dreamed of this life and I got it by believing I could do it and working my tail off!! If there is something you want just go for it! I’m yelling at you to chase your dreams!'  

His post comes two days after Christina shared her second marriage was coming to an end after being wed for less than two years.

Christina shared a contemplative shot for her 1.4 million followers, showing her and Ant silhouetted against the sunset, walking on a beach.

Farewell: Christina took to social media on Friday to reveal the 'difficult decision' she's made with husband Ant to call it quits, after less than two years of being hitched

She captioned the photo with: 'Ant and I have made the difficult decision to separate. We are grateful for each other and as always, our children will remain our priority.  

'We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future,' Christina concluded.

She and the For The Love Of Cars presenter, 41, wed on December 22nd, 2018, and share son Hudson London, whose first birthday they celebrated earlier this month.

Navigating the future: It remains to be seen whether Ant will stay across the pond, or return to co-parent his young son in Orange County with Christina

Christina recently unveiled the ninth season of her HGTV real estate show Flip Or Flop with ex Tarek El Moussa, to whom she was married from 2009 until 2018.

She and Tarek share daughter Taylor, nine, and son Brayden, five. 

Ant, for his part, also has children from a previous marriage, to Louise Anstead - daughter Amelie, 19, and son Archie, 14. 

The news of Ant and Christina's split comes after the British born Ant was recently able to fly home to be with his older children after a months-long delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier in lockdown, Ant had explained that due to flight cancellations he was unable to be with his two older children.

The doting dad was grateful for 'modern communications' and relied on daily FaceTime calls to bridge the gap between himself and his kids.

Better times: Ant had lamented being separated from part of his family due to the pandemic and said the separation wasn't easy; seen on Instagram with their blended family

However, the separation wasn't easy and he lamented not being able to get his blended family all together. 'I am so over 2020 now!!!! This last week has been particularly TOUGH,' he wrote in June.

Clearly, the stresses of this year also took their toll on his relationship with his second wife, in spite of a cheery post in August celebrating their dating anniversary. 

It remains to be seen whether Ant will stay across the pond, or return to co-parent his young son in Orange County, California with Christina.
