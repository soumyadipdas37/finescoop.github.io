Berklee Maguire was killed in the devastating explosion at around 7am on Thursday outside Oklahoma City

A 14-year-old girl has been killed in a home explosion outside Oklahoma City, which obliterated her family's house and injured her parents and brother.

Berklee Maguire was killed in the devastating explosion at around 7am on Thursday in the northeast Oklahoma City suburb of Edmond, family members and the Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office confirmed.

Investigators believe the explosion may have been caused by a propane leak from a log lighter in the family's fireplace, which could have been ignited by a spark, according to KFOR-TV.   

Berklee's father Shawn was seriously injured in the explosion, and is currently being treated in an ICU, according to a GoFundMe campaign set up to help the family recover. 

Her mother Tanda and brother Hayden were both hospitalized in less serious condition.

Images from the scene show the total devastation in the wake of the explosion, which blew the garage door off a neighboring home, and scattered debris across several yards.

'[The house] was leveled like an EF5 tornado came through here,' said Oklahoma City Fire Department Battalion Chief Benny Fulkerson, according to The Oklahoman.  

Several hours after the explosion, insulation from the destroyed house was still drifting from the sky on the 8000 block of Northeast 139th Street.

Nicholas Nadeau, Enforcement Officer with the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Administration, told KFOR that the suspected cause is a log lighter with an open valve. 

He said propane gas vapor could have filled the home, which would spark an explosion with any ignition, such as plugging in a coffee pot, or even turning on a light.

Kenneth Wagner, the Oklahoma Secretary of Energy and Environment, released the following statement: 'We are deeply saddened to learn of the loss of a family member and are praying for the comfort of those grieving and the full recovery of those harmed in this tragic incident this morning.'

'We are committed to fully investigating and understanding the cause of the incident in hopes of ensuring something like this never happens again,' he continued. 

'The Oklahoma LP Gas Administration is working with both local law enforcement and safety authorities to secure the area and launch an investigation.'

Friends and family expressed their shock and grief at the sudden loss of young Berklee, as her father fights for his life in the ICU.

'Absolutely heartbroken at the news of the explosion of our friends’ home this morning. Please pray for the Maguire family,' wrote family friend Jemma Stemmons on Facebook.

'Mom and dad are severely burned and injured. They lost their 14 year old daughter. Their 12 year old son was also in the home and sustained some injuries,' Stemmons continued.

'Our girls and their community of friends are so very sad. This family has touched a lot of lives. Please keep these teens in your prayers as well.'

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt released the following statement: "Sarah and I are heartbroken by the news of an explosion at a home in Edmond this morning and the tragic loss of a child. I am actively monitoring the situation and have offered our full support as the response and investigation into this incident continues."
