A great-grandfather who was brutally attacked in his own front yard has been laid to rest in a casket adorned with vegetables.     

Emiliano Lombardi, 84, was buried at a ceremony in Perth attended by over 100 friends and family members on Friday.  

Mr Lombardi was slashed with pieces of broken mirror after going to investigate a noise outside his home in East Cannington on August 16.  

The great grandfather was remembered as 'helpful' and left mourners with a traditional recipe for a pasta sauce as a parting gift, Nine News reported.

Australia was shocked when horrific images emerged after Mr Lombardi suffered a broken nose, eye injuries, and numerous deep cuts.

Mr Lombardi's casket was decorated with a pile of homegrown fruits and vegetables to honour his passion for gardening.   

He was described as 'happy with a simple life' and was loved all the way from his native Italy to Perth.

Mr Lombardi's 'famous pasta sauce recipe' was also shared with mourners at the funeral.       

'Emmy's il sugo recipe' featured a traditional Italian tomato sauce with onion, sausage, garlic and chilli. 

Mr Lombardi's children have also spoken out on their father's tragic death and his fulfilling life.   

'He was so happy with so little and he just lived life on his own terms and helped others,' Mr Lombardi's daughter Laura Hussein said.   

News of the attack sparked an outpouring of support and prompted neighbours and local tradesmen to look after Mr Lombardi's home while he was hospitalised. 

Tradies volunteered to repaint and plaster the great grandfather's home, while neighbours visited daily to look after his chickens and vegetable garden. 

Businesses also offered to provide new furniture and bedding after his sheets were stained with blood.
