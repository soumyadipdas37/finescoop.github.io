Kevin Hart's wife Eniko bared her growing baby bump in a striking pregnancy photo shoot that put her belly front and center on Wednesday.

The 36-year-old model, who is expecting her new addition very soon, posed in an unbuttoned white blazer, which displayed her bare breasts and stomach.

While sitting on a wooden stool with one leg pointed to the floor, the beauty kept her tresses draped over one shoulder and sported a dusky eye-shadow.

'Strong, powerful, MAMA MAGIC,' Eniko captioned her latest post, less than a week after teasing her 3.4 million Instagram fans with behind-the-scenes snaps of her time on set with photographer Patty Othon. 

She competed her sultry ensemble with a number of gold bangles and two layered Juste Un Clou bracelets from Cartier, which are in the shape of a bent nail.  

On Thursday, she shared two similar snaps in the same outfit and more images in a skintight, sheer bodysuit with a split skirt.

Additionally, she slipped into a white cropped peasant-style top with drop shoulders and a white skirt with side splits.

The mother-of-one, who is currently expecting a little girl, announced her pregnancy in March. 

'Baby #2 in the midst of all of this we’re counting our blessings and couldn’t be more grateful! Soon to be a family of 6 #glowingandgrowing,' she wrote at the time on Instagram.

Eniko tied the knot with Kevin in 2016 and the couple welcomed their two-year-old son Kenzo in November 2017.

The following month, the Ride Along star admitted he had cheated on his wife while she was pregnant with their child.

Kevin also has two children from his first marriage - daughter Heaven, 15, and son Hendrix, 12.
