Two people were killed and six others were wounded during an early morning Sunday shooting at a home near New Jersey's Rutgers University campus. 

The shooting occurred at about 1.18am Sunday during an apparent house party in New Brunswick, New Jersey, authorities said, although it appears no students were involved in the incident.

Nearby surveillance cameras caught the moment when four people jumped out of a dark-colored car that stopped in the middle of the street near the house where the shooting occurred. 

Surveillance cameras caught the moment when four people exited a car and started shooting at an apparent house party in New Jersey at about 1.18am Sunday

The shooters then ran back to the car and took off, leaving two dead and six wounded 

The people - who were seen wearing hooded sweatshirts and long pants - then hustled towards the direction of the house while firing their guns, before running back to the car and driving away. 

The whole incident took place in under 30 seconds. 

When police arrived at the scene, they found eight people with gunshots wounds. Two of the victims - unnamed men - were declared died at the hospital, News 12 reported. 

More than 40 shots were reported to have been fired during the incident 

Neighbor Jacob Beacher, 20, told the news station that he ran over and tried to perform CPR and 'check for a pulse and stuff' when he saw two people lying on the pavement following the shooting.

More than 40 shots were said to have been fired during the incident, which may have occurred after an argument involving party's entry fee

Police have not yet identified a motive for the shooting. One of the victims who died was said to have been celebrating his birthday that night

He said he 'couldn't believe it,' when he saw someone his own age 'just bleeding out' on the ground. 

It's unclear whether the people Beacher tired to help survived the shooting or not, as none of the shooting victims have been named yet. 

ABC 7 NY reported that one of the men who died had been celebrating his birthday that night.  

A man told NBC New York that he was the organizer of the party - calling it a 'post-COVID party - and said that the shooting may have followed an argument over the event's entry fee.  

Police have not yet determined a motive for the shooting, the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement obtained by the New York Times.  

Locals said that the area where the shooting took place was known for housing students and for the parties held there. 

Resident George Biedenkapp told NJ.com that there had been a heavy police presence in the neighborhood for the past month, presumably on the lookout for parties, 'But then this weekend, nothing.'

Authorities are looking for the four gunmen, but have not yet released descriptions of them. 

Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call New Brunswick Police Department at 732-745-5200  the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office at 732-745-3948.
