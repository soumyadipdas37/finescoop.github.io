Thousands of Melburnians have placed their boots outside their homes in a united show of frustration with Premier Daniel Andrews over draconian lockdowns.

As hundreds of protesters clashed with police for a second consecutive day in the CBD, many other Melburnians protested legally in a silent protest amid growing calls for the Victorian leader to stand down. 

More than 3,000 initially registered their participation in Sunday's Give Dan The Boot at-home protest when it was organised earlier in the week. 

By Sunday, that number grew to 20,000 as Melburnians and other Victorians flooded social media with photos of shoes placed outside their front doors in protest of the Premier's handling of the state's horror second coronavirus wave.

Boots and shoes of all types, styles, sizes and colours were on display outside front doors, on letterboxes and driveways and even tied to front gates and fences, along with handwritten 'Give Dan the boot' signs.

A woman also put out her dolls' footwear while one man tied his work boots to the garbage bin.

'That's where you belong,' he wrote as the hashtag #givedantheboot started trending on social media.

One woman said the at-home protest was the first time she'd been involved in anything political.

Another woman wrote: 'Dan deserved the boot six months ago, for negligence, double standards, lies and arrogance. Remember you were appointed by the people for the people, not to hide your mammoth mistakes during this pandemic.'

Victorian Liberal MPs Richard Riordan and Beverley McArthur jumped at another opportunity to take a stand against the Premier.

The mass protest was organised earlier in the week by  Victoria Forward, the group run by 19-year-old Donald Trump supporter and Liberal member Edward Bourke. 

'It's time to stand up to Daniel Andrews, and now you can do it from home!' the Facebook event reads. 

'Please place a pair of boots or shoes at your front gate or around your fence this Sunday, 13th of September and post a photo to this event or use the tag #GiveDanTheBoot. 

The group stressed that no COVID-19 restrictions would be breached.

It comes as police made dozens of arrests in Melbourne's CBD on Sunday.

Huge crowds of protesters were filmed marching down empty streets in Melbourne for a second consecutive day.

Up to 150 protesters chanting 'Freedom' and 'Power to the people' were outnumbered by officers at Queen Victoria Market with some throwing fruit at police after raiding market stalls. 

Protesters yelled 'this is not a police state' and 'you've got to be on the right side of history'.

Footage of violent scuffles and officers on horseback moving through a group inside the market has been posted online.

The wild scenes come after police made 14 arrests and issued at least 51 infringement notices a day earlier on Saturday.

One man decided to put his boots out early asking what he did 'to deserve' having Mr Andrews as his premier.

Another shared a homemade sign she had made with the words #GiveDanTheBoot painted across a piece of cardboard.

One woman who doesn't even live in the coronavirus-riddled state said she too would hang out her shoes in support.

Mr Bourke's group Victoria Forward is well known for its highly critical stance on Mr Andrews.

In one social media post, the group insisted that 72 per cent of their 15,000-strong following wanted Mr Andrews to resign. 

Mr Bourke first rose to fame following a video interview with VICE Australia in 2016, where the then-15-year-old revealed his support of Donald Trump.

He also runs a government relations firm called 470 Bourke, where the teenager calls himself a 'seasoned political campaigner, activist, and strategist who has a history of success in his political predictions, comments and strategies'.

When Mr Bourke was 14 he started non-profit campaigns before taking on 'successful global political campaigns'.

The widespread public frustration comes after Mr Andrews revealed Melbourne's roadmap out of lockdown a week ago.

Currently Melburnians are in the midst of tough Stage Four restrictions which mean residents can only leave their house for four essential reasons - which as gutted local businesses and wreaked havoc on the economy.

These include for one hour of exercise a day, to give or receive care, for work or study and for necessary shopping.

Victoria has recorded 41 new cases and seven more deaths on Sunday to take the state's death toll to 723 and the national count to 810 since the start of the pandemic in late January.

While Melbourne will remain under stage four lockdown until at least September 28, stage three restrictions in regional Victoria are expected to ease within days. 

It comes after the state recorded just 37 new cases and six deaths on Saturday- the lowest number of new infections since the second horror wave of the virus began 11 weeks ago.

It's also the fourth consecutive day Victoria has recorded less than 50 new cases in a 24-hour period. 

Melburnians will enjoy slightly more freedom from midnight tonight when their daily exercise time is doubled from one hour to two.

The city's strict night curfew will also be reduced by an hour to start at 9pm instead of 8pm.

There's growing hope stage four restrictions will be lifted in two weeks if the rate of new daily cases stays under 50. 

Cafes, bars and restaurants will not be able to have customers dine outside until at least October 26, and only if the statewide case average has fallen under five for the previous fortnight.

Customers won't be allowed inside until November 23 and only if there have been no cases at all for the previous two weeks.
