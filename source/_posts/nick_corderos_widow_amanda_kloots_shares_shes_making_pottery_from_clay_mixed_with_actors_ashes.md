'It will just be this beautiful reminder of Nick instead of a sad reminder which is what they were,' Kloots, 38, explained

On her Instagram Story, Kloots, who married Rock Of Ages star Cordero in 2017, explained that she had scattered some of her late husband's ashes in the Pacific ocean.

She said she also plans to use some of them in jewelry she's planning to make.

'It will just be this beautiful reminder of Nick instead of a sad reminder which is what they were,' she said.

Gone but not forgotten: Cordero died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA on July 5 where he'd been hospitalized since March suffering from complications of COVID-19. He was 41

On March 30, Cordero was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles suffering from pneumonia and later tested positive for the coronavirus.

He was placed on a ventilator and in mid-April had his right leg leg amputated due to  complications.

He suffered severe lung damage, dropped 65lbs and was so weak he could not move or speak.

After more than 90 days in the ICU, he passed away July 5. He was 41.

Legacy: Kloots and Cordero married in 2017 and welcomed their son Elvis in June 2019. 'I want him to know Nick struggled to make his dreams come true and he never quit,' she told the NY Times of how she plans to talk to her child about his father

In an interview with the New York Times published on Tuesday, Kloots spoke about her commitment to raising her son to know his father. 

'I want him to know Nick struggled to make his dreams come true and he never quit,' she said.

'I want him to know his dad was a hard worker,' she added. 'And I'd love for him to know about all the people that he touched, the lives that he touched, and what a good guy he was.' 

And she told the outlet how much her little boy is helping her to face a future without Cordero. 

'Even when I want to be sad, he's just so cute that you end up smiling and laughing. He looks like Nick, and he has a lot of Nick's personality. I can already tell,' she said.

RIP: 'God has another angel in heaven now.... my heart is broken,' Kloots posted on July 5 as she announced the news that the Rock of Ages Broadway star had passed away
