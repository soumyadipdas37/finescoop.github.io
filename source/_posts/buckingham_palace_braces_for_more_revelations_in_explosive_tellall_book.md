Buckingham Palace is bracing for more explosive revelations with the publication of a tell-all book promising to reveal the truth behind the events of the Sandringham summit. 

The infamous summit, attended by the Queen, Prince Harry, Prince William, and Prince Charles took place in January and saw the royals bash out the details of Megxit.

Now, a new book promises to lay bare the events of the talks as well as revealing the truth of the relationship between Harry and William.  

Battle of Brothers: William, Harry and the Inside Story of a Family in Tumult is written by British historian Robert Lacey, whose previous works have included biographies of the Queen, Sir Walter Raleigh and Eileen Ford. 

As well as his work as an author, he is also known for consulting on Netflix's hit royal series The Crown. 

The book will give an 'inside look' into the princes relationship, starting from childhood up to the present day.

It will apparently lay bare details of William's misgivings towards the speed of Harry and Meghan Markle's relationship, as well as his feelings on Megxit, which saw the Sussexes quit the royal family. 

The book is also expected to include the Queen's 'angry' response towards Harry and Meghan's decision.  

It will be published on October 15. 

It comes after the release of the explosive Finding Freedom biography which charted Harry and Meghan's relationship and their struggles within the royal family. 

The controversial book, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, has raised eyebrows for its gushing praise and intimate knowledge of the Duke, 35, and the Duchess of Sussex, 39 - but the Duke and Duchess of Sussex claim they were not interviewed and did not contribute to the book. 

The biography offers a window into Meghan and Harry's lives during their time as senior royals, and is full of details on their shock exit from the royal family.

It addresses the alleged rift between brothers Harry and William, as well as the relationship between their wives.

Scobie said that while they did not interview the couple, 'many' friends gave them insights - providing 'a lens to the couple through their friends and their circle of aides'.

The royal commentator gave several high-profile interviews to publicise the book in the week since its release.

But royal expert Katie Nicholl said the authors may be the 'only winners' from the publication of Finding Freedom.

Writing in Vanity Fair, she asked if the book was 'worth it for Harry and Meghan' before adding: 'The irony of Finding Freedom is that, locked down in their rented mansion in LA, the Sussexes have less freedom than they did when they lived in Windsor.'

The book had reached number one on Amazon's Top 10 New York bestseller in 24 hours list on the day of its release for pre-order.

Meanwhile in July, 14 days before its release, the biography also topped the media giant's bestsellers list as royal fans rushed to pre-order their copy.

In other news, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are said to have agreed to star in a fly-on-the-wall Netflix reality series with cameras following them for three months.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are hoping to 'give people a glimpse into their lives and see all the charity work they do', according to a source.

It comes after the royal couple signed a £112million Netflix deal to make TV series, films and children's shows for the streaming service.

A source told The Sun: 'They may have had all these lofty ideas about producing epics highlighting environmental causes and the poverty gap, but Netflix obviously want their pound of flesh.

'It will all be very tasteful, and not Katie Price and Peter Andre-style reality TV, but they want to give people a glimpse into their lives and see all the charity work they do.'

According to the source, much of the series will be about their philanthropic work rather than what they get up to behind closed doors.

But they added: 'It will still be a fascinating insight and Meghan hopes viewers will get to see the real her.'

Ingrid Seward, Editor of Majesty magazine, said the couple were 'hypocritical' for agreeing to the reality series after they left the UK for the US for greater privacy. It is extraordinary. This is exactly what they said they wouldn't do,' she said.
