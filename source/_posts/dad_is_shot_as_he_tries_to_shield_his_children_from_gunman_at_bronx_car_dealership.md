The dad, who has not been publicly identified, was struck in the thigh by one of the bullets, police sources told DailyMail.com. 

He was transported to Jacobi Medical Center and is said to be in stable condition. 

Several other customers were seen milling around the dealership when the gunshots rang out, sending them running for cover.  

Police said they're searching for two suspects, one of whom carjacked a vehicle immediately after the shooting. 

The car, a four-door green sedan, was stopped at a red light just outside when the perpetrator approached, opened the door and pointed a gun at the 49-year-old driver, ordering him to get out.   

The first round of gunfire shattered a door in the dealership, sending customers running
