Shalina Abdulhussein, 39, was found slumped over a bathroom sink on the three-level Lady Rose catamaran on February 2

A mother-of-two who died on a party boat on the Sydney Harbour was likely killed by poisonous gas which leaked onto the ship from a faulty sewage system, an investigation has found.

Shalina Abdulhussein, 39, was found slumped over a bathroom sink on the three-level Lady Rose catamaran on February 2, 2019. 

She had been attending a birthday party on the ship before her body was discovered by a deckhand during the four-hour cruise.

Rumours quickly began swirling that she had been died of a drug overdose but her family vehemently denied those claims.

An investigation by the Office of Transport Safety has found a 'faulty waterless basin trap' within the sewage system led to the release of hydrogen sulphide into the cubicle.

Hydrogen sulphide is a colourless gas, which smells like rotten eggs. High-level exposure of the poisonous gas can be deadly.

The investigation found Ms Abdulhussein was likely overcome by the harmful gas before passing out and dying during the party, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Ms Abdulhussein had been on board the Lady Rose catamaran for a four-hour birthday party

Partygoers were treated for shock after Ms Abdulhussein was found. Some reported a 'weird smell' on board the ship

The investigation also found the crew lacked urgency in dealing with the gas as guests had reported a strong 'rotting egg' smell four hours before Ms Abdulhussein's body as found. 

The Lady Rose left Pyrmont at 12.30pm with the 27 party guests on board. Within half an hour of their trip passengers complained of a smell. 

Several passengers then began feeling unwell and began vomiting. 

The master of the boat was informed of the issue at 2.50pm.

He decided to dock at Bailey’s Marine, White Bay to empty the sewage system.

Ms Abdulhussein had entered the cubicle at 3.30pm, before the ship had docked. 

She was later found slumped over a bathroom sink and could not be revived.

The captain of the ship Paul Titze, 45, of Botany, has been charged with multiple offences by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) relating to the incident.

Titze has pleaded guilty to unreasonably placing the safety of another person at risk, court records show, the Daily Telegraph reported.

However, he has pleaded not guilty to operating recklessly or negligently while master of the Lady Rose on February 2, 2019.

The case has been adjourned and the matter will return for a hearing at a later date. 

Ms Abdulhussein's death has been referred to the coroner.
