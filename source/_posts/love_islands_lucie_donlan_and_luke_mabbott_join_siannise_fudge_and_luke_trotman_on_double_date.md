Lucie Donlan and Luke Mabbott enjoyed a double date with Siannise Fudge and Luke Trotman at STK in London on Saturday.

The Love Island stars looked in good spirits as they arrived to the venue with their respective significant others.

Lucie, 21, looked sensational in a black sheer jumpsuit with structured shoulders and a floral embroidered print.

The beauty added height to her frame with a pair of heels while she also carried a black handbag.

Lucie styled her platinum blonde locks into an updo while her beau Luke M, 24, looked dapper in a houndstooth blazer with matching trousers and a white shirt. 

Meanwhile, Siannise cut a glamorous figure for the evening in a skintight white minidress with a deep v-neckline.

The TV star, 25, wore a pair of nude heels and carried a bejewelled handbag while she let her raven tresses fall loose down her shoulders.

Luke T, 23, looked suave in a gold and cream printed shirt along with beige trousers and a pair of white trainers. 

The outing comes after Lucie went public with her Love Island beau Luke at the start of July.

Soon after the announcement, Luke branded the surfer his 'partner in crime' in a sweet social media post.

The former heating engineer and the model looked loved-up as they shared a hug on the beach during a romantic surfing trip in Yorkshire.

Luke and Lucie sported matching wetsuits as they put on a cosy display in the image uploaded to the hunk's platform, which he captioned: 'My partner in crime.'

The surfer commented: 'Youuuu' with a heart-eyed emoji, while fellow Love Islander Luke Trotman, who confirmed the pair's romance days earlier, cheekily wrote: 'Double date but no surfing.' (sic)

Just hours after going Instagram official, the Luke's ex-girlfriend Demi Jones – who he was partnered up with on Love Island's winter 2020 series – appeared to make a thinly-veiled dig at her co-star as she liked a tweet about being 'better off alone'.
