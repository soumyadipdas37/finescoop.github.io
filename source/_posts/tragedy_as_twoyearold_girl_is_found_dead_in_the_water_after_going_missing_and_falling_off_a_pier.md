A two-year-old girl has drowned in coastal Victoria after wandering away from her family and falling off a pier. 

A frantic Triple-0 call was made at about 1pm on Thursday when the child vanished from The Esplanade in Portarlington, 28km east of Geelong.

A police search was launched and the girl was found face down in the water at a nearby pier.  

A Victoria Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the toddler was unresponsive and could not be saved.

Officers desperately performed CPR on the two-year-old until ambulance crews arrived. 

Paramedics were seen working on the little girl for close to an hour, The Geelong Advertiser reported. 

'Unfortunately she died at the scene,' the spokeswoman said. 

Police will prepare a report for the Coroner.
