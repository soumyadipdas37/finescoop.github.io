They are currently expecting their third child together.

And Chrissy Teigen and husband John Legend, 41, looked every bit the doting parents as they loaded up on groceries at Bristol Farms in Beverly Hills on Thursday.

The 34-year-old model put her burgeoning baby bump on display in a black crop top as she walked cautiously through the store's parking lot with daughter Luna, four, and son Miles, two, in hand.

Chrissy paired her sports bra with some black biker shorts and a leopard print kimono that featured a black satin collar. 

She slipped her feet into a pair of black strappy sandals and she had her purse strewn across her body. 

Teigen's lengthy golden hair was parted down the middle and styled in effortless waves.

The Cravings CEO had on a pair of aviator shades and she adhered to California's face mask guidelines by donning a black cloth mask.

John was in charge of pushing the family's packed cart back to their parked vehicle.

The All Of Me singer looked stylish in a patterned button down shirt, off white trousers, and a pair of squeaky clean sneakers.

The couple's daughter and eldest child Luna let her personality shine through her ensemble by pairing a polka dot sundress with a gold metallic purse.

Miles had on a charcoal toned graphic tee with the entire alphabet printed on it in bright yellow lettering and a pair of maroon sweatpants covered in lightening bolts.

Chrissy and John, who wed in 2013, announced the news of their pregnancy via the music video for John's latest single Wild, which premiered on August 13.

In the emotionally charged music video, Chrissy rested her hands on her baby bump, while John tenderly held her.  

Chrissy went on to confirm the pregnancy herself in selfie videos showing off her already visible bump.

She later revealed that the baby, who comes after she and John welcomed Luna and Miles through IVF, was conceived naturally and a surprise for the couple.   

'It was a surprise. A little quarantine surprise, I guess you could say,' John shared with Craig Melvin while on the Today show.  

'But we're very excited, and we're grateful for all the well-wishes we've gotten from people all around the world. Thank you so much.'
