Winter Wonderland 2020 has been cancelled over coronavirus concerns.  

Organisers of the Hyde Park event have today revealed that the event would not be going ahead. 

The London attraction, which started 13 years ago, brings in millions of families each year.   

Winter Wonderland said in a statement: 'Hyde Park Winter Wonderland has always been about bringing friends and family together in a fun, safe and interactive environment to celebrate the festive season.

Organisers of the Hyde Park event have today revealed that the event would not be going ahead 

'Our team has worked tirelessly, exploring every possible option in the hopes of being able to move forward with the event in a responsible manner and provide London with some much-needed festive cheer.

'However, in light of ongoing health concerns, travel restrictions and uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, and considering the size and scale of this event, we just couldn't find a way to do that without compromising the magical attractions, shows, rides, bars and experiences that make Hyde Park Winter Wonderland so special.'

Organisers said that Hyde Park Winter Wonderland would be returning in November 2021. 

'We cannot wait to bring friends and family back together to celebrate the festive season next year!' they said.
