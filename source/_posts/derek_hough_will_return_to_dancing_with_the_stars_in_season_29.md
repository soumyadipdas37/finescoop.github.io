Four years after leaving ABC's hit reality series Dancing With the Stars, Derek Hough is slated to return, in some capacity.

Hough, 35, a professional dancer and older brother of Julianne Hough, who won the MirrorBall trophy a record six times, was a dancer on the show from 2007 to 2016.

He has since been keeping busy as a judge on NBC's World of Dance alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo, but Good Morning America teased on Twitter that Hough will make his DWTS return, but the full reveal won't happen until Tuesday.

'TUESDAY: @DerekHough is coming BACK to @DWTS - but what will he be doing? TUNE IN TO @GMA TUESDAY TO FIND OUT!' read the GMA tweet, plus the hashtags #DancingOnGMA #DWTS.  

Hough was not listed as one of the professional dancers featured this season which were announced in August, nor was he one of the celebrity dancers announced on Monday.

It's possible that Hough could be revealed as one of the new judges, since ABC has yet to confirm the judges for the upcoming 28th season.

Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tomoli and Len Goodman have served as the longtime judges on the show, though the network has teased many changes for the upcoming season, many of which were already announced.

ABC made the surprising announcement in July that longtime host Tom Bergeron, who has hosted all 28 seasons of the show, is leaving, along with longtime co-host Erin Andrews.

They are being replaced by Tyra Banks, who is hosting the show solo and was said to spearhead the 'creative refresh' of the show as host and executive producer.

Shortly after Tyra Banks was announced as the new host, sources told DailylMail.com that Hough had been approached to return to DWTS.

'Derek has already been asked if he is interested in coming back to Dancing With The Stars,' a source told DailyMail.com.

'They have always liked working with him because he is very professional and really talented plus just an overall nice guy. The celebrities trust him.

'And it does not hurt that he has a huge following and fans want him back,' the source added.
