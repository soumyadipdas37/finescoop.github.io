Pizza Hut has been pulled from the brink and thousands of jobs have been saved as its creditors and landlords have agreed to its proposed restructuring plan.

Under the deal, known as Company Voluntary Agreement, the chain's landlords have agreed to receive reduced rent for 215 restaurants, which will remain open, keeping 5,000 jobs safe.

However the company will still go ahead with plans to shut 29 underperforming restaurants, putting some 450 jobs at risk.  

Rescued, for now: Pizza Hut said the CVA gave them 'a strong platform to secure the long-term future of the business'

A CVA is a deal struck between a company that has run out of money and its creditors. It puts a legal ring-fence around the firm to ease pressure from its creditors, such as HMRC, the Pension Protection Fund and landlords.  

Generally, it means a business is allowed to exit leases on unprofitable stores, and is gifted better terms by landlords.  

The CVA will only affect Pizza Hut Restaurants franchises - not its Pizza Hut Delivery business, which is operated separately.  

If a vote had not passed, the chain could have collapsed without extra funding – a CVA can only be granted by the courts if a company can show it will face administration without the support.

 

But unlike administration, CVAs are adopted by businesses that, although extremely distressed, still have a shot at survival. 

A Pizza Hut Restaurants spokesperson said: 'We are delighted to have reached such a constructive position in partnership with our landlords and creditors.

'We appreciate the support of everyone involved and this outcome provides us with a strong platform to secure the long-term future of the business including over 5000 jobs and over 200 restaurants.

'Our focus is now "business as usual" supporting all of our team members and continuing to provide a Covid-safe restaurant experience for our guests.'

High street chains like Pizza Express, Yo! Sushi and Byron Burgers have all used CVAs during the pandemic to secure restructuring deals with major site closures. 

Last week, Revolution Bars revealed that it was weighing up options, including a CVA, in a bid to survive the coronavirus crisis.

Retailers have also relied on the form of insolvency, including New Look, which has signed rental agreements based on sales, rather than a fixed amount.

Landlords and creditors have continued to vote favourably on CVAs, preferring to secure agreements based on lower rents than risk pushing retailers or restaurant chains towards more severe insolvency processes by rejecting proposals.

Pizza Hut, which was founded in the US in 1958, had put foward plans for a CVA earlier this month after saying that 'sales are not expected to fully bounce back until well into 2021' - despite a quick and safe reopening of sites.
