Malin Andersson exuded confidence as she danced in her sitting room while wearing black lingerie after her abusive ex Tom Kemp was jailed last Thursday.

The Love Island star, 27, looked sensational as she delivered an animated performance to Britney Spears' 2000 hit Stronger.

Malin displayed her incredible curves in a black lingerie set with a balcony bra, which had caged detailing, and matching thong bottoms.

The body confidence advocate appeared in high spirits as she performed an energetic routine to the classic noughties single.

Malin styled her brunette locks into a relaxed high ponytail and appeared to go makeup-free as she displayed her radiant complexion.

The mental health campaigner exuded confidence and appeared care-free as she gave the performance her all in a passionate routine.  

Malin captioned the fun video with: 'NOW I'M STRONGER THAN YESTERDAY.'

The reality star's ex Kemp was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court last Thursday after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in a series of Instagram posts last year.

But Kemp, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.

Speaking after his conviction this month, a friend of Malin told The Mirror: 'Her nightmare is over at last.'

The media personality told a friend she 'couldn't move for about two weeks' after the attack.

Malin and Kemp had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims he had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth.

Their baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.

They split again last March, with Malin admitting it was better to end things between them as she and her partner struggled with their grief. 

Malin now wrestles with PTSD, after the abusive relationship left her mental health and self-esteem in tatters.

She told The Sun: 'You just feel helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, depression, anxiety.

'The emotional abuse stays with you a lot longer than the physical. It takes a long, long time to heal.'
