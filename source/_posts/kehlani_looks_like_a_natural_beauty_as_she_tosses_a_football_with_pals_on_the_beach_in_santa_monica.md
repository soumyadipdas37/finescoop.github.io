Kehlani enjoyed some sun-soaked downtime with her pals at the beach in Santa Monica on Thursday. 

For her outing, the 25-year-old singer had her dark tresses tied back into a bun and showcased her natural beauty with minimal makeup and oversized clothing.

As she caught up with friends, the Oakland native could be seen tossing a football with a bright smile across her face.

Opting to ditch her bright yellow sandals, the mother-of-one could be seen strutting around the sand barefoot in a white Thraser t-shirt and cargo pants.  

While she kept her accessories to just a pair of gold hoop earrings, she displayed her heavily tattooed arms and neck. 

The Good Life hitmaker, who has 'Espíritu Libre' (meaning 'free spirit' in Spanish) across her temple and four small dots under her eyes, later covered up with a black and white flannel.

She was joined by a mystery blonde woman, who closely flanked her side in a black sports bra and a pair of long patterned board shorts. 

The vocalist, who publicly identifies as queer and pansexual, has been single after splitting from boyfriend YG in February. 

While gracing the cover of Teen Vogue in May, she opened up about only knowing only single moms and absent fathers, with few examples of healthy relationships.

'I have one married couple in my family and it's my grandpa and his wife, and it's still kind of a relationship that… still feels far away to me,' the two-time Grammy nominee revealed. 

She added: 'I'm used to single moms. I'm used to baby daddies not being around. I'm used to arguments and fights and people not talking to each other and people having mass secrets.' 

The performer continued to explain how the lack of role models growing up made it difficult for her to know what a loving relationship should look like and that 'love doesn’t have to be difficult.'

Amicable: Kehlani confirmed she had split from YG in a track titled Konclusions. The couple first went public with their romance in September 2019.

The singer also insisted she is still friendly with her former lover, YG, and she doesn't think their whirlwind romance was too fast. 

Speaking to The Breakfast Club, she said: 'I don't think it was too fast. He said I love you first. He's such as passionate person that I'll never take that away from him. When he cares about something, he cares about it.'
