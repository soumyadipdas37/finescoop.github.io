Newly-engaged Kerry Katona touched down at Gatwick Airport with her fiancé Ryan Mahoney and her children on Sunday, after their Spanish break.

The Atomic Kitten star, 40, cut a casual figure in a bright pink tracksuit and opted not to wear her flashy engagement ring for the flight. 

However, Kerry appeared to have broken the 14-days mandatory quarantine upon her arrival to the U.K as she was pictured on Monday driving back to the airport with her eldest daughter Molly, to pick up a missing suitcase.

'I always knew if I was going to do it, I'd want to hop on a plane and do it in Vegas in a chilled-out way.'

A source told the publication: 'Ryan is really close to all of Kerry's kids so he made sure he involved them before asking for Kerry's hand in marriage. He got Kerry a massive two carat diamond ring and showed it to the girls first and they all loved it.'

Since then, Kerry took to Instagram to confirm the news as she shared sweet snaps with her family with the caption: 'Well what a b****y amazing 40th I’ve had.... honestly couldn’t of spent it any better with the people I love the most'.

Alongside a diamond ring Emoji, she then bashfully rounded out the post by writing: 'and with a massive twist too..... here we go again!'
