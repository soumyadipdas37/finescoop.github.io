Captain 'Sully' Sullenberger III launched a scathing Twitter rant denigrating President Donald Trump and urging the military and Americans to 'vote him out' following a report that the president called dead war heroes and veterans 'losers and suckers'. 

Sullenberger rose to fame for his 'Miracle on the Hudson' emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on January 15, 2009.

The former Air Force pilot and captain, who retired as a commercial pilot in 2010, is now using his voice to denounce Trump's time in office. 

'I am a veteran. I volunteered for military service during wartime. So did my father. His generation saved the world from fascism,' Sully tweeted Friday.

'For the first time in American history, a president has repeatedly shown utter and vulgar contempt and disrespect for those who have served and died serving our country,' he added.

The Atlantic published a damning report late Thursday where sources alleged Donald Trump called dead war heroes and veterans 'losers' and 'suckers' and he refused to visit a veteran cemetery in France in 2018 because he didn't want to pay his respects

His Twitter thread came one day after The Atlantic published their damning report on Trump's disparaging comments on veterans and soldiers.

Sullenberger stressed that Trump is not fit to hold office and urged his more than 120,000 followers to vote in the upcoming election.

'While I am not surprised, I am disgusted by the current occupant of the Oval Office. He has repeatedly and consistently shown himself to be completely unfit for and to have no respect for the office he holds,' Sullenberger said in his scathing Twitter thread.

'He cannot understand selflessness because he is selfish. He cannot conceive of courage because he is a coward. He cannot feel duty because he is disloyal.

'We owe it not only to those who have served and sacrificed for our nation, but to ourselves and to succeeding generations to vote him out,' he added with a link to The Atlantic story.

The shocking article released late Thursday revealed Trump reportedly called US soldiers injured or killed in war 'losers' and questioned the country’s respect for them.

The report cites four unnamed people with first hand knowledge of Trump’s comments. 

Trump canceled a visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Parks in 2018 because it was raining and sources said he didn’t want to go to ruin his hair and because he didn’t see why he should honor dead soldiers.

'Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers,' the magazine quoted Trump as saying.

The report also said he referred to the more than 1,800 marines who died at Belleau Wood on France as 'suckers' for getting killed.

Trump also allegedly disparaged the military service of the late former president George H. W. Bush and objected to having wounded veterans be involved in a military parade.

Sullenberger closed out his rant uring his followers to 'vote him out'

The White House rejected the story saying, 'This report is False. President Trump holds the military in the highest regard,' White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said to the Washington Post.

'He’s demonstrated his commitment to them at every turn: delivering on his promise to give our troops a much needed pay raise, increasing military spending, signing critical veterans reforms, and supporting military spouses. This has no basis in fact,' she added.

Sullenberger has already voiced his support for Democratic nominee Joe Biden, joining him at a Nevada caucus rally earlier this year and endorsing his 2020 run.
