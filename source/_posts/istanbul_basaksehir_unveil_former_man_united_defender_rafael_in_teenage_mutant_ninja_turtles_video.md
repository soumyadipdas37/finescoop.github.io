Former Manchester United defender Rafael was revealed as a new signing by Istanbul Basaksehir, in a bizarre Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles themed video.

The 30-year-old Brazilian joins the Turkish side on a free, after he requested to leave Lyon after five years at the Ligue 1 club. 

And in the current day and age where football clubs look to unveil their signings with unique video announcements, the Turkish side did their bit to outdo them all.

The video posted on Twitter sees Rafael putting on the club's shirt to the theme music of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 

Rafael gets into the spirit of the club's unique idea, putting on an orange Ninja Turtles style mask and walking onto the club's pitch.

The popular children's television show saw four superhero turtles trained by their rat sensei, battling criminals in New York City.

One of the four turtles is called Raphael which is where the club have produced the link between their new signing and the show.

Transfer announcements have changed over the years from just the normal press conferences with the player doing a few keep-ups on the pitch.

Now many clubs get involved with seeing who can produce the funniest, most memorable transfer unveilings.

Rafael's announcement is one of the more bizarre ones of the summer so far to date.

Despite 12 months remaining on his contract Lyon, the club waived their right to a transfer fee to allow Rafael to move to the Turkish Super Lig.

The 30-year-old's game time has reduced in the past two seasons, only making 13 appearances in the last Ligue 1 season.

In a statement the Istanbul club said Rafael has signed a two-year deal with the option to stay for another season. The defender will wear the No. 4 jersey, Basaksehir added.

Before his move Lyon, the Brazilian played with his brother Fabio at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes and Louis Van Gaal.

During his seven seasons at the Red Devils, he won a FIFA Club World Cup, three Premier League titles, three English Super Cup trophies and two English League Cups.
