Instead of slow cooking a roast in the oven for hours, an Australian woman has revealed how she cooked one kilogram of lamb from Woolworths in her 5.3 litre Kmart air fryer.

Amy, from Brisbane, said the alternate kitchen gadget cooked the meat to a medium-rare perfection and only took one hour.

'The perfect roast lamb! Cooked in the 5.3L at 180 degrees Celsius,' Amy said and shared photos of the result to a popular cookery group.

The delectable images of the meat looked so mouth-watering it encouraged other home cooks to go out and purchase the $89 Kmart air fryer in order to replicate the meal.

'That is amazing!! Definitely going to try this,' one person said.

'Perfectly cooked, that's how one should eat lamb,' another said.

A third added: 'Looks good, bit rare for me - I just bought air fryer, will try.'

To season the meat, Amy rolled the lamb in oil then in a mixture of garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper until it was fully coated.

She then cooked the meat in the air fryer for 20 minutes, then flipped it over and cooked for a further 35 minutes.

After removing the lamb from the air fryer, she left it to rest for another ten minutes.

'This gives a medium-rare cooked roast, internal temp was 47 degrees when I took it out of the air fryer before resting,' she said. 

'The roast was so tender and tasty and the spuds were crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.' 

The recipe is super easy to complete and anyone can make it for themselves or their family at home.  

1. Preheat the air fryer for five minutes at 180 degrees Celsius 

2. Coat the lamb in oil, then roll it in a mixture of garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper until coated

3. Cook for 20 minutes, then flip onto other side and cook for a further 35 minutes 

4. Remove from air fryer and leave to rest for ten minutes before serving with vegetables and potatoes
