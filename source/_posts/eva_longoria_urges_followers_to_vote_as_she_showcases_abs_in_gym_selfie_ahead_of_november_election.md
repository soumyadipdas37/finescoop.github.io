Eva Longoria Baston opened the virtual Democratic National Convention back in August as she has repeatedly been an outspoken political activist for years. 

On Monday the Desperate Housewives actress, 45, proved that she takes no days off, as she continued her activism with a gym selfie. 

The Latina beauty showed off her killer abs in a matching blue spandex set as she prepared for her week of work ahead and urged her 8M Instagram followers to vote.

In the selfie Eva smiled in her mirror as she wore a two toned blue workout set with grey mesh detailing on the sides. 

The Texas born actress popped her toned leg with her hand on her hip, showing off every inch of her muscle tone as she flashed a fresh pair of matching blue sneakers.

She wore her hair up in a loose ponytail and flashed a makeupless face as she looked ready to take on the world.  

Eva captioned the photo 'Here’s to a great week ahead! Don’t forget to register to VOTE!' 

Vote: Eva co-founded a digital lifestyle community for the 'modern Latina' with fellow hispanic actress America Ferrera

 

Eva made sure to get in a good workout after a day of continued activism, as the 'She Se Puede' founder appeared on a live instagram with Oprah magazine earlier in the day. 

The digital lifestyle community was founded in part by actress America Ferrera, 36, as the two women wanted to create a platform for the 'modern Latina'.   

The movement aims to engage Latino voters ahead of the 2020 election by empowering them to have consistent civil discourse about the world and the future.  

Hours later Baston continued to hit the message home, posting another snap of her in a 'vote' mask as she flashed a peace sign for the camera.

 The mother of one has been hugely vocal about the importance of the Latinx vote in the upcoming election, hosting a series of live conversations on social media and urging her followers to get involved and make their voices heard. 

Speaking to her followers, the timeless beauty said 'I’m voting for my son, for my Latino Community, for women everywhere, and for our planet!!' 

When Eva is not busy being a supermom and an outspoken activist, the multi-talented star dotes on her adorable two-year-old son, Santiago, who she shares with husband of four years, José Baston, 52.

The Mexican businessman met his A-list bride in 2013 after they were set up by mutual friends though it did not immediately click. 

'I was getting out of a bad relationship, and he was getting out of a relationship, so there wasn’t a connection' she told People. 

Eva had previously broken it off after dating on-again-off-again beau Eduardo Cruz, brother of actress Penelope Cruz.   

The same friend must have had a good feeling because she re-introduced the pair about six months later and sparks flew.

'It was like the cliché angels singing and there was a glow around him and it was immediate chemistry' the actress gushed. 

He eventually proposed in December 2015 while on a romantic trip to Dubai and the pair wed the following year in Mexico. 

The pair gave birth to their son Santiago in 2017 and have been in parental bliss every since. 

Before the pandemic Eva was greenlit to develop a Latina-centered television drama with Universal called Tias.
