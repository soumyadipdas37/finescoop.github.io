Floyd Mayweather has reiterated his desire to train Deontay Wilder for his heavyweight trilogy fight with Tyson Fury. 

The retired pound-for-pound king made an offer to Wilder back in August with the promise he could 'teach him how to win again'. 

And Wilder has been given another opportunity to join forces with the legendary boxer as he looks to claim revenge against rival Fury.

Floyd Mayweather has again told Deontay Wilder he would train him for Tyson Fury trilogy fight

The Bronze Bomber was convincingly beaten by the Gypsy King in Las Vegas earlier this year

The American was stripped of his WBC world title in February as Fury battered him from pillar to post to inflict the first ever defeat on his career via a seventh-round stoppage.

Their trilogy clash is likely to happen early next year and Mayweather insists he can turn Wilder - who is already trained by his long-time coach Jay Deas - into a much better fighter for the third instalment.

Speaking to ClubShayShay, Mayweather said: 'Tyson Fury's solid, he's got skills.

'Deontay Wilder's got bombs, but we can make his skills a lot better.

Wilder was stopped in the seventh-round after a one-sided fight in Las Vegas

'I'm here to help fighters, even Wilder.

'I'm here, all he's got to do is let me know what he wants to do and we can make it happen.'

Mayweather's offer comes after he vowed to emulate his late uncle Roger by becoming a successful trainer. 

He was working closely in the gym with his protege Devin Haney and a number of young fighters earlier this year.

It is still not clear when Fury and Wilder will square off for the third and final time with Top Rank chief Bob Arum revealing they've had to abandon plans to stage it at the new £1.4billion NFL Raiders Stadium on December 19.  

Mayweather insisted he could improve Wilder's skills and said all he has to do is let him know

He said: 'We're moving off because there's five conference championship games that day and night, plus two NFL games.

'So we can't go with the 19th, we're looking at other dates right now because ESPN advised us, and Fox advised the PBC [which promotes Wilder].'

Fury's UK-based co-promoter Frank Warren, meanwhile, insisted the fight cannot go ahead without any spectators.  

He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'Not a fight of that magnitude.

'Wilder and Fury was the highest grossing fight to ever take place in Vegas. 

'We just can't lose that gate. It's a huge amount of money. We need the gate.'
