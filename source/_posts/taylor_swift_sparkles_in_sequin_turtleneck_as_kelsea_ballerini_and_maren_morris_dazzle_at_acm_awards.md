It was originally slated to be a star-studded event taking place in Las Vegas in April but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

And on Wednesday night, the Academy of Country Music Awards hosted a scaled back and socially distanced annual awards show in Nashville, Tennessee. 

But despite being a mix of pre-recorded and live segments, with performances taking place at three different venues in Nashville, the stars still managed to put on a fashion show for their big night. 

Taylor Swift kept her look low-key as she arrived at the famous Grand Ole Opry while Kelsea Ballerini and Maren Morris led the way on the red carpet at the Ryman Auditorium with gorgeous and colorful outfits
