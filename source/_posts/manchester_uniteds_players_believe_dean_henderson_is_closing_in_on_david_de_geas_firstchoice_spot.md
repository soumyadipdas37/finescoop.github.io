Manchester United players believe Dean Henderson is closing in on David De Gea's position as first-choice goalkeeper.

De Gea has started the season as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's No 1 in the Premier League following Henderson's return to Old Trafford in the summer following two successful season loan spells at Sheffield United.

But Sportsmail sources have described the battle to be United's recognised first-choice as 'very tight' while there is a sense among members of the United squad that Henderson is applying mounting pressure on De Gea.

Having come through the United academy, Henderson made his United debut in the 3-0 win over Luton in the Carabao Cup last week and is expected to be given a fresh opportunity in Wednesday's clash against Brighton in the same competition.

And another assured performance at the AMEX Stadium against Premier League opposition will push Henderson closer towards his ambition of overtaking De Gea.

Speaking earlier this month, Henderson heavily hinted that he wouldn't to be satisfied with a role on the United bench this season, saying: 'It wouldn't be clever for me to sit around and not play football, I don't think it would help any parties at all.

'You can get many things from training, and obviously learn off someone like David himself and the other goalkeepers and goalkeeper coaches. But I don't think there's any substitute for game-time.'Â 

Elsewhere, it is understood United are preparing to activate a one year extension option on midfielder Paul Pogba's contract.

The World Cup winner is approaching the final 18 months of his current contract - but can trigger an extra year on his deal to protect his value.

United, it is understood, are still to formally discuss a longer extension to Pogba's contract but know they have a safety net of extending his existing deal.
