Hollywood power couple of 37 years Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn return as Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus in the first teaser for The Christmas Chronicles 2, which starts streaming November 25 on Netflix.

In the preview, 'true believer' teenager Kate Pierce (Darby Camp) and her pal Jack (Jahzir Bruno) get a personalized tour of Santa's Village by the Claus couple.

'Mrs. Claus designed everything,' Santa noted.

The 13-year-old SAG Award nominee replied: 'Well, if she designed this place, I think it should be called Mrs. Claus Village.'

Santa then responded: 'I never thought of that.'

And Mrs. Claus sidled up to Kate and said: 'Of course he didn't.'

Oscar-nominated producer Chris Columbus (Harry Potter, Home Alone) directed and co-wrote the merry sequel with The Christmas Chronicles screenwriter Matt Lieberman.

Missing from the trailer was the sequel's villain - magical troublemaker Belsnickel - who's played by Deadpool 2 star Julian Dennison.

And while TCC2 features Judah Lewis, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, and Tyrese Gibson, Goldie's real-life son Oliver Hudson will not be back as deceased dad Doug Pierce in flashbacks.

The 2018 original flick managed to score an eye-popping 20M views in its first week of streaming despite having a 67% Rotten Tomatoes rating.

'Kurt has never had that many people see one of his movies in the first week ever,' Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos told Business Insider in 2018.

'That's a testimony to what we can bring to the market for storytellers today that we couldn't have 10 years ago...If every one of those was a movie ticket purchase, that's a $200M opening week.'
