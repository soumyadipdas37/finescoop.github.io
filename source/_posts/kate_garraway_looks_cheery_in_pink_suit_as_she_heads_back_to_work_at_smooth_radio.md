She's had a tough year after her husband Derek's battle with coronavirus.

But Kate Garraway looked in high spirits as she headed back to Smooth Radio in central London for the first time since her family drama on Monday morning.

The presenter, 53, looked like a ray of sunshine in a pink suit as she strutted into Global Studios. 

Triumphant return: Kate Garraway looked cheery in a pink suit as she headed back to work at Smooth Radio for the first time since her husband Derek's coronavirus battle on Monday

The Good Morning Britain presenter caught the eye in the salmon flared trousers and jacket which she teamed with a pink and white tie-collar blouse. 

Kate completed the look with nude heels and green hoop earrings as she beamed and waved for the camera.

She wore her blonde tresses in a chic bob and looked radiant in a natural covering of makeup.

Kate took a break from work to spend time with her children and husband, Derek Draper, who remains in intensive care as he continues to recover from COVID-19.

But last week she announced she would be returning to her Smooth Radio show so that Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.' 

She will record her show from 10am to 1pm everyday this week, after her friend Myleene Klass filled in for her during her break.

Recovery: The TV broadcaster looked in high spirits despite the tough year she has had with her family

Derek, 53, was hospitalised back in March after suffering complications from contracting COVID-19, and has remained there since.   

Last Thursday the TV star revealed how she celebrated her 15th wedding anniversary with Derek after being unable to visit him in hospital. 

Speaking on last Friday's Good Morning Britain, she revealed she was able see him later in the day, but admitted it felt 'strange' as Derek is in a limited consciousness state.

Wow: She stunned in the salmon number as she headed back to work after her break to be with her family

Quite the arrival! Kate rocked up to the studios on a snazzy motorbike, donning a safety helmet and mask

Kate revealed: 'We did our best to make it special. We had him on FaceTime. We raised a glass to say happy anniversary.

'I have a card to take to read to him. He was a prolific card writer for birthdays. He'd always remember. And hopefully he'll do it again.

'It will be strange reading to him, but this time I have made a bit more of an effort.'   

Strutting: She will record her show from 10am to 1pm everyday this week, after her friend Myleene Klass filled in for her during her break

All smiles: Kate turned back to beam at the cameras as she pulled open the door to the studios in London

Radiant: Kate looked glowing with a typically light covering of makeup and a slick of pink lip

Derek is now in a limited consciousness and is unable to talk - but can hear things. His carers have been playing GMB on TV for him, while Kate is on. 

Kate returned to the studio having taken time out to settle her children into school, after what has been a challenging six months for the family.

She shares Darcey, 14, and William, 11, with Derek. 

Standing tall: The star elongated her legs in a pair of nude heels which went perfectly with her suit

Classy: Kate showed off her waist in the high waisted pink trousers that were cinched in at her middle

Happy days: She appeared to be in a very good mood as she posed for cameras ahead of her work shift

Derek is one of an estimated just five people in the world whose bodies have been damaged so much by Covid. 

He has survived but for how long – or even if he can recover – the doctors can't say as his condition constantly fluctuates. 

Kate contracted coronavirus herself at the same time as Derek, but made a full recovery.
