Fulham are closing on a deal to bring Ademola Lookman back to the Premier League.

The 22-year-old left Everton for Red Bull Leipzig last year in a £16.5million deal but has struggled for playing time making just 13 appearances last season.

Now the former Charlton youth product is in talks with Fulham who have made an approach for a loan with option to make his move permanent.

The winger has watched Leipzig's first two games of the season from the bench with the Bundesliga side recording 3-1 and 3-0 victories.

Lookman failed to register a goal or assist for the German's in the 2019-2020 season and started just one game.

In his final season for Everton, the winger made 21 Premier League appearances and contributed two assists.

Scott Parker is looking to strengthen his squad before the end of the transfer window with his side suffering two defeats in their opening two fixtures.

There have been seven new arrivals at Craven Cottage this summer, three of which are loan deals.
