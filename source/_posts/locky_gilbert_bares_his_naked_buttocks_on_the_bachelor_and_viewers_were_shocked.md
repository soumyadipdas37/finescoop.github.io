Bachelor viewers were given an eyeful during Thursday's episode of the show when Locky Gilbert stood up naked in the bath.

The 31-year-old hunk was enjoying a virtual date with Izzy Sharman-Firth, when he cheekily stood up to reach for his glass of wine.

And it's safe to say most fans weren't expecting the raunchy moment, especially given the show's 7.30pm time slot.

'I am UNCOMFY with the angles I witnessed!' tweeted one unsuspecting viewer, while another wrote, 'Truly a miracle we didn't all cop and [sic] eyeful of testicle'.

One person said they felt like they were 'intruding on a very awkward Zoom call' after the coronavirus pandemic forced production of the show into lockdown.

'To the poor @Channel10AU editors that had to meticulously edit Locky's junk out of this scene, I'm so sorry,' tweeted one viewer.

Added another: 'The bubbles were disintegrating way too quickly for my liking... much like my mental health during 2020...'

After Locky stood suddenly in the bathtub, a shocked Izzy, 29, started laughing hysterically, which irked some viewers.   

'This is very boring TV. And I feel Izzy's laugh is totally fake, it has to be... sorry Locky's just not that funny,' tweeted one viewer.

Added another: 'Is it just me; or does Izzy have a laugh like a hyena?'

Things turned flirty when Izzy jokingly complained that there were 'too many bubbles' in Locky's bath.  

'Are you just getting me to stand up?' he asked, prompting her to respond, 'Yeah, I'd just like to see a little bit more of your skin.' 

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten
