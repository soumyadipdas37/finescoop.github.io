Funny-woman Amy Schumer is taking her Emmy loss in stride. 

The 39-year-old - who created Amy Schumer Learns To Cook with her husband Chris Fischer, 40, in quarantine - shared her would-be video acceptance speech on Saturday. 

The show was nominated for outstanding unstructured reality program but lost to Netflix's Cheer on Saturday.

Emmy nod: Amy Schumer shared her would-be video acceptance speech for if  her show Amy Schumer Learns To Cook won an Emmy the day after losing to Netflix's Cheer

In the one minute Instagram clip Amy is seen at her kitchen table with her husband Chris, their 16-month-old son Gene, and their nanny Jane.  

She captioned the video,  'Emmy loss. The vid we made in case we won. We lost to Cheer! I loved cheer! #amyschumerlearnstocook' 

 'This video they'll play if we win an Emmy. Jane, who do we want to thank' Amy started the clip, directing her attention to their nanny Jane who helped shoot the show. 

'Thanks for the people who are watching our show, thanks for all the support and love. Thank you Food Network thank you to amy especially and chris and this little guy' she added. 

Quaran-team: Amy self-shot the cooking show with husband Chris and nanny Jane during quarantine from the safety of their own home upstate

Casual attire: Far from the usual Emmy's glam, the comic and the family sat around in their comfortable lounge wear for the speech

Family time: The little family unit rattled off a list of names of people to thank as well they all sat around in their comfy clothes and played with 16-month-old Gene

The little family unit rattled off a list of names of people to thank as well they all sat around in their comfy clothes. 

The Expecting Amy star shared that they all had a great time making the show as she pet her dog Tati and engaged with her son Gene as he sat in his high chair and sucked on a spoon.  

'We really had fun making the show, thank you for voting for us! YAYYY!' she ended the video. 

The speech was quick to garner comments from supportive followers on social media. 

Paris Hilton commented with heart eye emojis and Booksmart actress Beanie Feldstein hilariously commented 'THATS MY BEST FRIEND GENE'. 

Chef life: Amy's husband of two years is a certified chef  who plays the role of mentor in the kitchen

 Amy has accredited a lot of the show's success to her nanny Jane who balances taking care of their son Gene and being the camerawoman. 

The quarantine cooking show has provided a lot of comedic relief during the pandemic. 

The show's humor comes from the family's dynamic as husband Chris is an actual chef who steers the kitchen ship while Amy busts his chops and sometimes overindulges in the beverage department. 

Like many during quarantine, people have been trying to master new kitchen skills which makes the show hilariously relatable in a world where everyone is baking bread on social media or consuming alcohol at odd hours of the day. 

Comedic relief: The quarantine cooking show has provided a lot of needed laughter during the pandemic as it is an incredibly relatable concept in a world where people are fine tuning their kitchen skills

The now Emmy nominated show is currently in its second season and is filmed in their rental house upstate where they've been staying after fleeing NYC. 

In addition to the Food Network show, Amy's HBO special Expecting Amy, was widely received for its raw and hilarious look into her life and journey to motherhood.  

The 72nd Emmy Awards, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel will air live on Sunday at 8P/ET on ABC. 

Success story: Amy has recently had a lot of success with both her Food Network cooking show and HBO special as the comedian and mother proves she can do it all even during a pandemic;pictured at a fundraiser November 2019
