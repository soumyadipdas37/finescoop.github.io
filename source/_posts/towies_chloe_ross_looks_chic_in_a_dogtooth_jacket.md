She rose to fame following her stint in ITV's The Only Way Is Essex.

And Chloe Ross put on a glamorous display as she stepped out in a dogtooth jacket and mini skirt co-ord in London on Sunday.  

The former TOWIE star, 27, looked chic in the retro ensemble which she styled with leather over-the-knee boots for karaoke with friends at Lucky Voice in Holborn.

Chloe layered the monochrome jacket, adorned with gold buttons, over a halterneck black top which she tucked into the skirt to showcase her gym-honed figure. 

The TV reality star flaunted her sun-kissed limbs in the stylish heeled boots and carried her evening essentials in a black shoulder bag.

Accentuating her pretty features, Chloe pulled her brunette locks into a sleek high ponytail and added a dash of highlighter over her cheekbones for the outing.

The star added gold hoop earrings and put on a playful display as she posed with her tongue out for the camera.  

Chloe's former castmates have been filming the new series of ITVBe's The Only Way Is Essex, which celebrates the show's 10-year anniversary in recent weeks. 

The 10th anniversary series was due to start filming in March 2020, but ITV bosses made the tough decision to put the production on pause due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Fans were left without their Essex fix until the show came back with a vengeance on earlier this month with former cast member Amy Childs returning.

The new series has got off to a shaky start as TOWIE received 176 Ofcom complaints after viewers said they were left feeling 'uncomfortable' during Sunday's episode. 

During the show, Olivia Attwood, 29, Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 25, were all accused of bullying 19-year-old Chloe Brockett.

The women started arguing when the group waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex, Jack McDermott.

While the episode was airing many viewers took to Twitter to say express their concern about the trio's treatment of much younger cast mate Chloe B.

And now 176 people have lodged a complaint against the popular reality TV show since Sunday.

An Ofcom spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.'

While a TOWIE spokesperson said: 'Only Way Is Essex follows the real lives of our cast and as such we see their celebrations, make ups, break ups and disagreements.

'What you see on screen is based on the thoughts and opinions they choose to raise as part of telling their story. We have a robust support system in place to ensure the cast are supported before, during and after filming.'
