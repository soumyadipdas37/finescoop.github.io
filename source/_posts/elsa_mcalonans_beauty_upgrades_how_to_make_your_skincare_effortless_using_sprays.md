WHAT'S NOW AND HOW TO DO IT: SPRAY ON SKINCARE 

They're the ultimate in effortless beauty — mists and sprays that keep your skin nourished, glowing and healthy.

The new Shiseido Ultimune Defense Refresh Mist (£56, shiseido.co.uk) helps skin to feel cool in hot weather, while reishi mushroom and iris root extracts moisturise and boost its protective barrier.

To plump up skin, try Beauty Pie’s Uber Youth Super Elixir Microbiome Mist-On Serum (far left, from £17.43, beautypie.com) which boosts collagen and smooths lines.

Or try Goldfaden MD Mist RX (left, £38, cultbeauty.co.uk) which uses aloe vera to hydrate.

Another fabulous lookalike beauty bargain from Aldi arrives this week. The new 14-shade Lacura Velvet eyeshadow palettes, with their matte and shimmering finishes, are similar to those by Anastasia Beverly Hills but, at £5.99 each (aldi. co.uk, or in store from Sunday), are a fraction of the cost.

Pick from the warm tones of Revival, cool shades of Moon Dust or neutral Desert Rain. Buying all three would still cost less than one of the Anastasia Beverly Hills palettes (£46, cultbeauty.co.uk).

VANESSA'S PRINCESS POUT 

Best known for playing Princess Margaret in The Crown, Vanessa Kirby looked regal at the Venice Film Festival.

And it was thanks, in part, to Giorgio Armani , which l a u n c h e d i t s Venezia make-up range, featuring new shades of Lip Maestro and Rouge D'Armani Matte lipstick, at the festival.

The actress wore its Eyes To Kill Classico Mascara (£30, armanibeauty.co.uk) and Rouge D'Armani Matte in Nightberry (£32).

THIS WORKS 

Becca Under Eye Brightening Corrector (£21, spacenk.com)

While illuminating the eye area can lift the complexion, often camouflaging is also needed to hide signs of ageing or fatigue.

Becca Under Eye Brightening Corrector (£21, spacenk.com), which does both jobs without settling in fine lines, has been launched in a limited-edition version, in partnership with Mental Health Mates.

 DO TWO-IN-ONE HAIR PRODUCTS WORK?

Nowadays, a shampoo and conditioner in one, which claims to do everything from cleansing to moisturising and frizz-taming, seems like the simplest option.

But top hairdresser Michael Van Clarke says: 'I've never been convinced by twoin- one. It seems in plain conflict. The conditioning ingredients in the same cleanser bottle must resist being washed straight out, so they are often silicones that stick and build up on the hair shaft.

'It's better to use a shampoo suited to your hair type, and a separate conditioner for texture.'

Try the silicone-free 3' More Inches Cashmere Protein Volumising Shampoo and Moisturising Conditioner (£54.50 each, vanclarke.com) for stronger, healthier hair.

Kerastase's Serum Universel, for £150

SHAMELESS INDULGENCE

Hair products are becoming more luxe, with high price tags to match. But even though our hair and scalp age faster than our skin, splurging on these treats still seems like an extravagance.

However, the new Kerastase Chronologiste antiageing range is more affordable than many luxury brands, and its blend of nourishing hyaluronic acid, abyssine (a regenerative marine molecule) and vitamin E is just as effective as pricier options.

The strengthening shampoo (£27.50, lookfantastic. com) restores a youthful bounce to hair, while the blow-dry cream (£34.90) tames and protects.

That said, if you really want to splash out, try the piece de resistance of the collection, Serum Universel, for £150. The caviar-like capsules leave hair shiny and smooth away frizz.
