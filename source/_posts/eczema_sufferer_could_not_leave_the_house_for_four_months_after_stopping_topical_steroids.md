A woman with eczema has revealed how she has finally soothed her skin by coming off all medication. 

Thalia Daw, 27, from Marlborough, was diagnosed with eczema aged five but her condition worsened significantly two years ago and she was prescribed mild steroids.

When the treatment didn’t work, a dermatologist prescribed Thalia with the topical steroids, Betnovate and Dermovate, as well as an immunosuppressant called Protopic.  

However her body rejected the steroids and Thalia, a brand account manager, began experiencing a rash and a burning sensation that spread across her body. 

After persevering for 18 months, Thalia came off the steroids but was left in state of withdrawal that caused its own symptoms, including leg blisters so painful that she was left unable to walk.

Thalia has since started to self-treat her condition with natural remedies such as regulating her water intake and said it has finally helped her skin.  

Brand account manager, Thalia Daw, 27, from Marlborough, could not leave her house for four months due to the severe withdrawal symptoms she suffered after quitting her topical steroid treatment for eczema 

Thalia, pictured now after overcoming the Topical Steroid Syndrome, lived as a shut in for months due to the severity of her symptoms. She said she was still healing 

The eczema sufferer could not walk unassisted, and had to use a walking stick or on occasion a wheelchair to get around, because the skin around her joints were so sore 

Thalia wants to speak out and raise awareness of topical steroid withdrawal and how dangerous it cam be. 

Speaking on the condition, she said: 'Topical steroid withdrawal greatly affected my social life for four months. I couldn’t go anywhere and I didn’t want anyone to see me. I shut myself away during that time.

'The recovery process took a long time and I’m still healing now. After two months, I quit using any form of moisturiser. I stopped showering and limited my water intake to one-litre a day. This all helped speed up the process but time was the key factor. 

'I had to borrow my boyfriend’s mum’s wheelchair to get some fresh air outside because my legs were so raw and blistered that I couldn’t bend them fully to walk. 

The skin around the brand manager's joints (including her elbow, pictured) was so painful she could not get around after stopping her eczema treatment 

Thalia documented how her skin evolved during the withdrawal process. After experiencing an eczema flare up after moving houses in 2018. Thalia's skin rejected the topical steroid treatment which that been prescribed to her and had to quit treatment altogether 

Thalia now. The 27-year-old could not leave her house, which she said has left her with post-traumatic stress disorder 

'I used the walking stick daily for a month until I regained my strength.

'My family and boyfriend have been an incredible support system through it all. I’m much healthier now but there are still days when I don’t want to get out of bed.

'It’s left me with anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Saying that, I feel more confident now and I don’t shy away from life. I’m excited for the future.'

After coming off the steroids, Thalia went too the doctor and tried to seek help for topical steroid withdrawal. 

'I went to the doctors numerous times. They just kept trying to prescribe me more steroids,' Thalia said.

'You’re made to feel stupid for explaining how you’ve self-diagnosed yourself with topical steroid withdrawal. In one appointment I broke down crying because of how dismissive the doctor was.

Thalia said her family and boyfriend (pictured) were an incredible support system throughout her ordeal

'I’ve never been offered any kind of help for the effects it’s had on my mental health.

'In small doses and for minimal amounts of time, these steroids can work for minor skin conditions but we need to stop over prescribing them on repeat prescriptions.

'There needs to be clear advice on where you can use it on your body and for how long. There are not enough studies into these side effects.

'If you’re experiencing topical steroid withdrawal, you are so incredibly strong. Healing happens and the journey is worth it. There are certainly dark days but the light does come.

'To anyone using topical steroid creams, please be careful and do your research. This illness is debilitating yet so completely preventable. 

The eczema sufferer (pictured) said she was never offered any help to deal with out her condition was affecting her mental health 

The 27-year-old was first diagnosed with eczema when she was five.She said she stopped moisterising her skin and limited her water intake to 1L a day to help with the healing process

Topical steroid addiction arises from the use of such creams to treat conditions like eczema. 

First described in 1979 in the International Journal of Dermatology, the theory is, over time, the skin becomes ‘addicted’ to the steroids. But it is not widely accepted among the medical community. 

Many have called the 'condition' a fad, however, it has been recognised by the National Eczema Association since 2013. 

Also known as red skin syndrome, the disorder does not have many statistics to show how common it is. One 2003 study from Japan, found that 12 per cent of adults who were taking steroids to treat dermatitis developed RSS. 

It occurs when steroids have been abruptly discontinued after a prolonged or inappropriate length of administration. Women who blush easily are thought to be most at risk. 

Topical steroid addiction has not been reported with correct drug use.

Symptoms include:

Excessive sweating and itching is a sign of recovery.  Many sufferers also develop insomnia. 

Treatment focuses on anxiety support, sleep aids, itch management, infection prevention and immunosuppressants.

Doctors should advise patients to avoid long term or high dose steroid use. Long term is considered to be one-to-two years of regular use.

Patients are also advised to cut down on steroids slowly but using a lower dose and gradually cutting back to, for example, every other day or a few times a week.
