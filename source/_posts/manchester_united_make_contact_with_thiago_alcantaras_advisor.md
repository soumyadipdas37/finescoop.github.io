Manchester United have reportedly made contact with Thiago Alcantara's advisor as they look to beat Liverpool to the signing of the Bayern Munich midfielder. 

German outlet Bild report that while United have not made an offer for the Spaniard, there has been contact between the club and the player's representatives. 

Liverpool have been viewed as favourites to land the 29-year-old after he told Bayern he would be leaving the club following their Champions League success in Lisbon last month.

But United, despite the imminent £40million arrival of Dutchman Donny van de Beek, have been credited with an interest in the former Barcelona man.

Bayern have set a £29m price tag on Thiago, a figure Liverpool or United are yet to meet, but the German and European champions accept the player wants to depart for a new challenge.

Thiago is out of contract next summer and with no desire to renew, Bayern will look to cash in so as to avoid losing him for nothing in 12 months time.

Manchester United are closing in on adding £40m-rated Donny van de Beek to their midfield

Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Welt Am Sonntag at the weekend: 'We are expecting an offer from another club in the next few days. 'He told us that at the end of his career, he would like to try something new.'

United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a plethora of options in midfield that will only grow with the arrival of Van de Beek.

And while it is not a priority area of improvement for his side, Alcantara is considered among Europe's finest in that position and would prove a quality addition, with Solskjaer looking to build on the club's third-placed finish in the Premier League last season. 

For Liverpool, they need to sell before moving for Alcantara and Georginio Wijnaldum could hold the key.

The Dutchman, who is also in the final year of his contract, has reportedly agreed personal terms to move from Liverpool to Barcelona this summer.

Wijnaldum is willing to swap England for Spain despite being a key man under Jurgen Klopp last term and discussions between the two clubs have already begun, according to Sport. 

The report claims that Barcelona are prepared to offer no more than £18m for the 29-year-old. But a free squad place and money to put into a replacement could see Liverpool take control of a Thiago pursuit. 

Thiago has been at Bayern since 2013 and has enjoyed much success at the club, winning the Champions League, seven Bundesliga titles and four DFB-Pokals.
