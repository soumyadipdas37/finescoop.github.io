Bella Varelis is widely rumoured to be one of Locky Gilbert's finalists on The  Bachelor. 

But it looks like the marketing consultant, 25, may have found love with another man: Gogglebox star Jad Nehmetallah.

According to Woman's Day magazine, the pair were recently spotted looking 'close' at a café in Burwood, Sydney, with a source saying the 'chemistry' between them was obvious.

New couple? Bachelor star Bella Varelis, 25, got 'close' to Gogglebox's Jad Nehmetallah, 34, when the pair were caught at a Sydney cafe together last week 

'She was very happy and laughing at everything he was saying,' an onlooker told the publication. 

The insider added that Bella and Jad seemed to be quite comfortable in each other's company.

'As they said goodbye he gave her a very tight hug... they seemed to be very close,' the source said.

Smitten? 'She was very happy and laughing at everything he was saying,' an unnamed onlooker told the publication of the striking brunette and Jad

The twosome reportedly have a number of mutual friends, and have previously spent time together at events around Sydney. 

While the meeting seemed innocent enough, Jad has been caught 'liking' a number of Bella's raunchy pictures on Instagram. 

Bella remains one of the front-runners on The Bachelor, with online betting agency Sportsbet tipping her for second place, behind Irena Srbinovska.

She had been an early favourite to win Locky's heart, but quickly fell behind nurse Irena, 31, as the season progressed.

In recent episodes, the former friends have clashed in the mansion as the competition for Locky's affection heats up.

The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10
