Earlier this month another home cook revealed how to make a similar three-ingredient Nutella cake

Earlier this month another home cook revealed how to make a similar three-ingredient Nutella cake using her slow cooker too. 

The woman also shared the recipe to the Slow Cooker Recipe and Tips Australia Facebook page and revealed she used Nutella, self-raising flour and eggs.

The woman said if she had more Nutella she would've added a glaze over the top instead of icing sugar.

By using the slow cooker, the cake turned out perfect and wasn't too dry.  

Soon after sharing the recipe online, other home bakers praised the woman and were eager to try make the cake themselves.
