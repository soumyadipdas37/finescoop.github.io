Demi Rose has admitted her world 'could have spiralled out of control' following the deaths of her parents, as she opens up about her grief in a new interview. 

The model, 25, suffered the loss of her father Barrie Mawby at the end of 2018, with tragedy striking again soon after when her mother Christine passed away in June 2019.

And amid her heartache, the star also discussed her mental health, telling how it almost 'got the better' of her during lockdown, in a candid chat to mark World Suicide Prevention Day next week.

Heartache: Demi Rose has admitted her world 'could have spiralled out of control' following the deaths of her parents, as she opens up about her grief in a new interview

Speaking to the Evening Standard, Demi shared how she's coping with her personal tragedy and reveals how her heartbreaking loss has in a way made her 'stronger'. 

The star revealed how she was forced to 'grow up' from a young age after her mother was left disabled following a heart attack, resulting in a then 17-year-old becoming her carer. 

She recalled that after losing her loved ones in quick succession left her 'angry, sad, bitter and lonely', but added that she was 'lucky' that she had a 'good support system' around her and didn't 'bottle up' her grief.  

Admitting that she could have easily succumbed to her anger and grief, Demi said: 'When my parents died my world could have spiralled out of control but you have to hang on.'

She went on to say that she was helped greatly by doing a lot of self-care and reading books about 'spirituality' and 'enlightenment', while she tried to look at her tragedy as part of 'life’s plan'.

Demi added that though she's been through trauma, she's come out 'stronger' and tries to reflect her strength through her positive and 'confident' social media posts.  

She went on: 'Behind closed doors there’s been a lot of torment and I suppose I have turned that into a positive as I feel I have been through so much nothing can push me down again'.

The social media sensation Demi also opened up about her mental health in the interview, and admitted it played a part in her recent move to Ibiza.

She explained: 'During lockdown I lived on my own in London and my mental health really did get the better of me. I had up and down days and with so much time on my hands I obviously had a lot of time to reflect on things.'

After battling her sadness while confined at home, when lockdown restrictions were eased, she made the decision to relocate to Spain, a decision she states is one of the 'best choices' she's ever made. 

Demi, who has teamed up with non-profit organisations We are Hummingbird and Panic Loves Company to film a video discussing her mental health, also suggested that the sunshine and abundance of friends she has in Ibiza have helped her immensely. 

Earlier this year, the brunette beauty revealed she is 'healing' from her parents' deaths following a tough year.

Hard: Admitting that she could have easily succumbed to her anger and grief, Demi said: 'When my parents died my world could have spiralled out of control but you have to hang on'

The Birmingham native explained how their tragic passings made her 'grow up really fast' as she opened up about dealing with grief during the recording of her PrettyLittleThing podcast episode.

She said: 'I've lost both of my parents, my dad cancer and my mum had a heart attack which caused a stroke when I was 17 and I was left as her carer as she was left disabled.

'I was caring for her for so many years, about 7 years,' explained the social media star.  

Demi then went into detail about the impact the death of her parents had on her and how she aims to help others experiencing the same thing.

Tough time: The social media sensation Demi also opened up about her mental health in the interview, and admitted it played a part in her recent move to Ibiza

She explained: 'Then my dad passed away with cancer and then my mum then sadly passed away 7 months after him with a stomach infection, and it just made me grow up really fast and be really really strong about things.

'And I think if I can inspire people by talking about grief, then you know if they can relate to me and they can understand it a little bit and I can help them then that's important to me.

After experiencing the loss of both of her parents, Demi admitted: 'I've gone through a lot, so I can talk on it.

'I feel like nothing can really affect me now, nothing can really make me feel a certain way - I've gone through it all.'
