She's been a stalwart on Australian TV for over 30 years, but Georgie Parker keeps her cards close her chest when it comes to her personal life.

The 55-year-old actress has been married to screenwriter Steve Worland for 21 years, but she rarely talks about him and is yet to share any photos with him on Instagram.

Georgie and Steve married in December 1999, and they have a 20-year-old daughter named Holly.

They rarely make red carpet appearances together, but made an exception for the 2015 Sydney premiere of Paper Planes, with Steve being the film's screenwriter.

In addition to Paper Planes, Steve has written scripts for a variety of movies and TV shows in both Australia and the USA, and is also an accomplished author.

Speaking to Good Health & Wellbeing in July 2019, Georgie confessed she had wanted to be a mother 'for a very long time', but simply hadn't met the right person.

'I just had to wait to meet the right guy! I kept on meeting guys I just didn't want to be a parent with, then finally I met my husband when I was 33. It was just the way it worked out,' she explained.

And the Home and Away star said the secret to their long-lasting marriage was maintaining separate interests. 

'We just give one another an enormous amount of space. We've never been joined at the hip, it's just not the way we operate,' she admitted.

'I think it's very healthy to do a lot of things separately, we have our own interests and I think that really helps. We do things independently, but also as a family, and as a couple.'

In an interview with The Daily Telegraph's Stellar Magazine in July 2017, Georgie said she made 'a conscious choice' to keep her family out of the spotlight.  

'I don't talk about my family at all... I think it's not their career - it's mine!' she explained.
