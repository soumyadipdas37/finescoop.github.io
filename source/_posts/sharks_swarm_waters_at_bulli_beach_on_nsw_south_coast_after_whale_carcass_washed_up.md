Sharks up to five metres long have swarmed a popular NSW beach after a whale carcass washed up on the rocks leading to a mass feeding frenzy.

Bulli and Sandon Point beaches near Wollongong on the state's south coast were closed on Thursday afternoon due to 'multiple large shark sightings'.

A day later monster sharks were spotted across the coastline circling around boats as local fishermen watched on in horror.

One of the huge sharks sunk its teeth into the motor of a local's fishing boat on Friday. Beaches were closed on NSW's South Coast due to multiple large shark sightings

Jake Brisbane was out fishing with a friend in Bulli Beach on Friday morning when a shark leapt from the water and sunk its teeth into the boat's motor.

'One of the most insane mornings on the water I've ever seen,' Mr Brisbane said sharing a video to Facebook.

He said another shark also appeared moments later hungry to find the whale.

Two other fishermen spotted what they believed to be a great white bigger than their five-metre long dingy.

In harrowing footage, the shark is seen cruising underneath their boat before circling around the area.

Police have since launched an operation to drag the whale back to shore.

The beaches are expected to be closed for another day to wait for the hordes of sharks to swim away.

Surf Life Saving Illawarra issued a stern warning to swimmers on Thursday.

'Surf Life Saving Illawarra is warning swimmers, surfers and divers not to enter the water at Bulli and Sandon Point beaches due to a significant number of large sharks in the area feeding on a dead whale carcass,' they tweeted. 

It's believed tiger sharks were also swimming at the area on Friday morning.

Anthony Turner, duty officer for Surf Life Saving Illawarra said people should avoid getting up close with the sharks.

'These sharks are quite large, they are larger than some of the boats we've seen on social media, under no circumstances should anyone be leaning or putting their body parts in the water,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 

'Even people on the rock platforms, we don't want anyone getting too close, the last thing we want is someone falling into the water with all the predators out there,' he said.'

The shark frenzy comes just days after a man was killed by a suspected great white on the Gold Coast.

Nick Slater, 46, died after he was bitten in the leg while surfing at Greenmount Beach in Coolangatta on Tuesday.

Surfers have since flocked back to the popular beach despite the horrific attack while helicopters and and jetskis patrol the area.
