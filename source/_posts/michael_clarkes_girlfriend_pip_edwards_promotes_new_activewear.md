She confirmed her relationship with Michael Clarke in July when they were spotted enjoying a romantic vacation in Noosa, Queensland.

And Pip Edwards looked incredible in her latest Instagram photo on Friday, while promoting new pieces from her own activewear label, P.E Nation.

The 40-year-old revealed her toned tummy and trim pins in a tank top and black leggings with zebra print detail, as she posed on the rocks at Sydney's Bondi Beach. 

No wonder he's smitten! Michael Clarke's girlfriend Pip Edwards (pictured), 40, revealed her enviably trim figure in activewear from her own label, in an Instagram post on Friday 

Pip accessorised with retro-themed sunglasses, and tilted her head to one side, looking completely in her element.

She styled her cropped blonde locks out, and showed off a radiant visage.

'Horizon-gazing and finding balance,' Pip captioned the post.

Michael, 39, separated from wife Kyly Clarke, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.

It is understood there was no third party involved in their shock split.

The Clarkes have said the 'amicable' decision to separate was 'the best course' for their four-year-old daughter Kelsey Lee.

Reports surfaced the retired Australian cricketer had begun dating Pip after his separation with Kyly became public knowledge.

Pip seemingly confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July, and the pair enjoyed a PDA-filled trip to Noosa, Queensland that same month.

Michael is notoriously private, and while hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip, he did recently say that he couldn't be happier.

'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now,' he told The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine last week. 'I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for.'

Michael went on to add that if negative attention is directed at his daughter or partner, it always hits him 'much harder' than if it were something 'thrown' at him.
