The Block contestants were left heartbroken on Tuesday night's episode, as the coronavirus pandemic meant the entire Melbourne set had to shut down for six weeks. 

But host Scotty Cam certainly kept momentum up during the difficult period, which saw filming come to a grinding halt back in March.

It was revealed this week that the presenter gave the Blockheads a number of video challenges for teams to complete at home, with the winners receiving money which would go towards their housing projects.

Keeping busy! One of the hilarious tasks was for the isolated contestants to take their bins out in style in the 'bin-iso challenge' - a trend which has featured many times on TikTok throughout the pandemic. Pictured: Harry and Tash 

One of the hilarious tasks was for the isolated contestants to take their bins out in style, in the 'bin-iso challenge' - a trend which has featured many times on TikTok throughout the pandemic.

In footage shared by Channel Nine, Harry and Tash were seen taking a somewhat flamboyant approach to the task - with Harry emerging playing an accordion, while Tash wore a skimpy bodysuit and knee-high boots as she pulled the bin behind him.  

But it was Luke and Jasmin who were crowned winners of the task, seen taking out the trash in an Addams Family-themed video - which saw their whole family dressed in gothic attire as they sauntered down the drive way together.

The bin challenge wasn't the only win for Luke and Jasmin, as they were also crowned the winners of a high-intensity home workout competition.

'Do the blockslide! Stay inside,' the pair said as they moved their bodies in the video, before bouncing in the air and saying: 'Lift those thighs, sanitize!'

The pair later admitted that the footage was 'cringeworthy'. 

'Making these really kept us occupied and the competition going! Everyone’s videos were so hilarious,' the pair said of the tasks.

Hilarious! In second place came George and Sarah, who gallivanted around their garden dressed as Pokemon

Gotta have faith! On another week, Harry performed a rendition of Faith by George Michael, using DIY objects to replace musical instruments as he danced around his home

In second place came George and Sarah, who gallivanted around their garden dressed as Pokemon.

On another week, Harry performed a rendition of Faith by George Michael, using DIY objects to replace musical instruments as he danced around his home.

Meanwhile, in another Tik-Tok inspired clip, George was seen switching places with Sarah in the mirror in a 'flip the switch' challenge. 

While Sarah was seen wearing high-vis clothing during the first half of the footage, the camera then flicked to George - who was seen sporting the very same shirt, which barely managed to cover his body.   

The Block continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine
