Travellers returning from Thailand and Singapore will no longer have to quarantine after they were added to the UK safe travel list tonight.

But Britons and holidaymakers arriving in Britain from Slovenia and the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe will face 14 days in isolation from 4am on Saturday. 

The Department of Transport announced the changes tonight. 

A spokeswoman said: 'People arriving in England from Slovenia and Guadeloupe from 4am Saturday September 19 will need to self-isolate for two weeks as the countries are removed from the travel exemptions list.

Data from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and Public Health England has indicated a significant change in both the level and pace of confirmed cases of coronavirus in both destinations, leading to Ministers removing these from the current list of Travel Corridors.

'Data from Slovenia shows that the weekly incidence (cases) per 100,000 has increased from 14.4 on September 9 to 29.1 on September 16. This equates to a 102 per cent increase. 

'There has been a sharp increase in the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 in Guadeloupe over the past 4 weeks, with a 558 per cent increase in weekly incidence per 100,000 between August 25 and September 15.'
