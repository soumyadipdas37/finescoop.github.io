She failed to find love with Nick Onassis on this season's Farmer Wants A Wife.

And on Tuesday, Liz Jelley, 34, slammed the show, calling it 'staged and manipulated' and said she was 'disappointed' she ever took part in it.

'It was a horrendous experience,' she told Kidspot, comparing the program to Married At First Sight. 

'It was a horrendous experience': Farmer Wants A Wife star Liz Jelley has slammed the reality show, branding it 'staged and manipulated' after appearing in the latest season 

The marriage celebrant revealed that leading up to her split with Nick the show's producers pitted the pair against one another to manipulate their break-up.

'I signed up for the old Farmer Wants A Wife – I didn't sign up for this bulls*** that I got. I am so disappointed that I ever went on the show. I didn’t go on to become an influencer or any of that crap,' she said.  

She also labelled the show's editing as 'horrendous,' adding that herself, Karissa Godfrey and Justine Adams have faced backlash from trolls online since their stint on the series.

'They throw some girls under a bus like myself and the hate that Justine and  Karissa and I have received has been horrendous,' she said.

Liz claimed that half her sentences were edited, and she was made to look like a jealous woman who was desperate to have a child. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Seven and production company Freemantle Australia for comment.

Nick added: 'I'm upset that Liz feels bad, but I just don't think that she's the girl for me. Forever.'

He said he thought they were too similar, but a tearful Liz claimed what they had was 'real', and she was disappointed that 'he didn't even want to try'.

The vineyard owner also admitted that he was still single, and said he 'knew in my heart it wasn't right' with Liz, and claimed he 'owed it to her to snap it off clean early'.

'She deserves someone, and that someone wasn't me,' he added.
