This is the moment a nimble squirrel makes a great escape when it is chased by two Golden Retrievers. 

A video captured in Merton, Wisconsin last week shows the moment Golden Retriever sisters Ruby and Stella spot a squirrel in their garden and start chasing it.

The squirrel makes a quick dash towards the fence with the two dogs hot on its bushy tail.

Ruby and Stella sprint toward the fence but the squirrel is too quick and nimble. 

It makes a spectacular getaway, hopping up on the fence and jumping over eight fence posts at lightening speed to escape.  

The Golden Retrievers chase it down the fence to the end of their garden but the squirrel has gotten away.

The dogs are left standing watching the squirrel leap towards freedom, tails wagging after their adrenalin-pumping chase.

Footage of the nimble escape was filmed on September 16.

The owner said: 'This squirrel has some series running and jumping skills.'

Golden retrievers are natural hunting dogs, and the name 'retriever' refers to the breed's ability to retrieve shot game undamaged, due to their soft mouth.
