Reece Hawkins' fiancée London Goheen has lashed out at online trolls after they accused her of editing an Instagram photo of her pregnant belly.

On Monday, the American model, 22, uploaded a photo of herself proudly baring her baby bump in a mauve bandeau top and mini skirt.

However, critics noticed that the awning above London's head appeared slightly bent in the photo, and it didn't take long for them to declare the optical illusion as 'proof' the image had been doctored.

London, who has previously complained about being 'harassed' by haters on Instagram, quickly uploaded a follow-up video to Instagram Story to prove the offending awning is in fact bent in real life.

'Here's the roof before y'all start attacking me again,' she wrote alongside three 'clapping hands' emojis.  

London and Reece revealed they are expecting a child earlier this month, just weeks after announcing their engagement.

However, London found herself in hot water with fans following the announcement after trying to charge followers $14.99 per month to see photos of her baby bump on OnlyFans. 

OnlyFans is a subscription-based adult website where content can range from something as innocent as a suggestive selfie, all the way to hardcore pornography. 

'She's literally charging people for her OnlyFans to view pics of her bump? What the f**k,' one follower wrote on London's pregnancy announcement.

Another person commented: 'Wow sis is really charging $9.99 per month to see her pregnancy photos lol.' 

Defending her decision, London told  Daily Mail Australia: 'I have chosen to show detailed parts of my pregnancy on that platform [OnlyFans] because I've had to experience harassment and bullying for the last two years over my relationship with Reece.' 

She added: 'I have 100 per cent control of my profile and what people have access to and comment on. I never said it was compulsory. People can choose if they wish to subscribe or not.' 

Reece also shares two children with his ex-partner Tammy Hembrow: son Wolf, five, and daughter Saskia, four.
