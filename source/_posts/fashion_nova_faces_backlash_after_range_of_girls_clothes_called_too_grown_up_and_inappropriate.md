Online retailer Fashion Nova has been slammed over its new range of children's clothes, with critics claiming the outfits are 'too grown up' for your girls. 

Fashion Nova, which is based in the US but ships to the UK, unveiled the collection last week with promotional images showing young girls dressed in high heels, midriff-baring tops and evening dresses. 

The pieces are designed to match adult versions available on the site. 

Shoppers took to Twitter to share their distaste, saying it is 'inappropriate' to create such designs for children and use young girls 'dressed like adults' to advertise them.

Others took issue with the names of the pieces, which include the $22.99 'Feeling Way Too Much' top and the $27.99 'Pulling Me Closer' pant.

After seeing the latest offering from FashionNova, @Snow_Blacck took to Twitter to share her distaste for the clothes and how the children were dressed. The Twitter user accused the company of creating outfits that are 'way too grown up and inappropriate' for young children and shared screenshots of little girls in heels and short skirts

Twitter user @Snow_Blacck, basked in the US, posted screenshots of some of the outfits, including a small sunkini set and a short skirt with matching crop top, expressing her distaste for the items. 

Both products appear to have been removed from the site. 

She wrote: 'NO FASHION NOVA. HELL NO. If you think these outfits are okay for little girls you’re wild. 

'These outfits are way too grown and inappropriate. These are not clothes for kids. These are grown club and brunch outfits. Stop it. Honesty where are y’all going with these outfits on? And heels? F***k no.'

Items of clothes on sale range from biker short sets to dresses with see-through tulle skirts. Some of the clothes' names were taken from the adult versions, many of which are listed as the same price.   

Others took issue with the names of the pieces, which include the $22.99 'Feeling Way Too Much' top (left) and the $27.99 'Pulling Me Closer' pant (right) 

One Twitter user shared this photo from the Fashion Nova website, despairing over the outfit

Examples of Fashion Nova outfits called out on Twitter include this matching black set (left) and another worn with boots (right) 

 



The names of the products concerned several people, with one person in particular suggesting that the names of some of the products were 'disgusting'

One person added: 'Nah, I get that they're trying to match the adults outfits with mini outfits but having a kid in a two piece set and calling it 'romantic escape' is just disgusting.' 

The unhappy social media users suggested the outfits were inappropriate and that clothing companies and parents should 'let kids be kids'. 

While acknowledging that not all the products on the fashion retailer's site were the same and drawing attention to some of the 'kid friendly clothes', one person said dressing them in heels and the names of the outfits made it inappropriate.   



Many people asked 'what happened to letting kids be kids' as they shared their horror at the latest clothing range which 'looks like they're playing dress up'

However, not everyone agreed with their protestations about the new clothing range, with some people stating that they do not think the outfits are bad. 

Several people suggested they were able to find 'plenty of appropriate outfits' on the site, including sweatshirts and T-shirts.    

Fashion Nova declined to comment.  



But not everyone agreed with the original tweet, with some coming to the company's defense to draw attention to the 'plenty of appropriate outfits' available on the site
