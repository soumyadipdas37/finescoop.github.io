Sydney has been rocked by 29 shootings in less than five weeks as bikie feuds and low-level drug wars explode in suburban neighbourhoods.

A worrying map has revealed Sydney's south-west is at the centre of the gang-linked violence, with over a dozen drive-by shootings in recent weeks.  

Acting Assistant Commissioner Peter McKenna said police were ramping up patrols and resources after a huge surge in shootings since August 1. 

Ten of the shootings have been in regional NSW and 19 in Sydney's central metro region, which covers the CBD, eastern suburbs, Inner West and Sutherland Shire. 

Just three days into the new month and there have already been three shootings - all in the central metro region.

In the most recent shooting, bullets were sprayed into a home in Fairfield Heights just after 10.15pm on Wednesday.

No one was injured during the shooting and police believe it was targeted.  

One of the attacks left infamous former Comanchero bikie Fares Abounader dead outside his home in Panania on August 29.

Police believe Abounader, who was present during the Sydney Airport bikie brawl, was a victim of a targeted shooting amid tension between the Comancheros and Bandidos.  

However, officers now suspect the botched hit on Turrella businessman Mohamed Saab three days earlier was related.

NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said there are now a handful of theories about Abounader's death.

'We've uncovered at least five indicators around why (Mr Abounader's) shooting occurred … we've had discussions with particular (bikie gangs) about acceptable behaviour. Anyone that participates in a public place shooting carries 25 years to life in prison,' Mr Smith said.

Mr Smith said both Abounader and Saab had alleged links to outlaw motorcycle gang conflicts, while most of the other hits are believed to be targeted. 

'It is not acceptable under any circumstances,' Mr McKenna said on Wednesday.

'It doesn't matter who is involved in these shootings - it's not acceptable and we will come down on them.'

Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith says the shootings are a result of individual conflicts, and could relate to low-level drug dealing which has been made harder given the border closures.

Shots were fired in a unit with three people inside on Columbine Avenue in Punchbowl on September 2

'We have seen COVID-19 putting some pressure in terms of the ability of organised crime to move illicit prohibited drugs into the state,' Mr Smith told reporters.

'There is some indication it's reflecting a higher than average price for drugs which is possible that some of this low-level stuff is a conflict occurring around the payment of drugs.'

Mr Smith said it was 'unacceptable' and 'dangerous' to other members of the public, warning the punishment could be life in prison.

'These people are taking a significant risk that they will spend a lifetime behind bars,' he said.

So far eight shootings have resulted in nine people being charged.
