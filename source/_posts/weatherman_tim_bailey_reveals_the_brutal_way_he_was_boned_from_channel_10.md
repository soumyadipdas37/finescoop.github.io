Tim Bailey has described his brutal sacking from Channel 10 after 28 years at the network.

'A knife through the back and through the heart, it's the best description of it,' he told Nine Honey on Monday.

Tim, along with at least 24 other stars, including Studio 10's Kerri-Anne and journalist Natarsha Belling, were sacked in a brutal afternoon of budget cuts last month.

Reported in The Sunday Telegraph this week, Tim said of his sacking: 'In that moment you begin to doubt everything you've ever worked for and ever done.'  

He said his new 2GB gig will give him a 'second chance' on radio.

'Ten letting me go turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me in a way,' Tim said of the sacking.
