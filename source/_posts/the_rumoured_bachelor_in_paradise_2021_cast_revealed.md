This year's season of Bachelor In Paradise certainly brought the drama.

And it looks like the 2021 season won't be any different, with Sportsbet revealing their predictions for the cast of the upcoming season.

It's believed a number of rejects from Locky Gilbert's season of The Bachelor are set to appear on the Channel Ten dating show.

Currently the front-runner at $1.50 to appear on the series is fiery redhead, Zoe-Clare McDonald. 

She is followed closely by Juliette Herrera at $1.65, while Areeba Emmanuel and Bec Cvilikas are both tied at $1.75.   

Others hotly tipped to star in the show from Locky's season include - Steph Harper, Marg Zogoulas, Izzy Sharman-Firth, Paige Royal, Nicole Campbell, Kaitlyn Hoppe and Roxi Kenny.

Runner-up Bella Varelis also seems likely to make an appearance, tipped at $3.75. 

Most surprising, however, is that 2020 Bachelor winner Irena Srbinovska is also predicted to arrive in Paradise, despite the fact she is currently still dating Locky.      

But the blonde beauty that stole the former Survivor star's heart is an unlikely contender, currently sitting at $15.  

Second time lucky? Runner-up Bella Varelis also seems likely to make an appearance, tipped at $3.75

This news comes after Locky took a rather brutal swipe at Bella on Sunday as he embarked upon his first hike with new girlfriend Irena.

Posting to Instagram Stories, the Survivor hunk made a sly reference to the infamous moment on The Bachelor when Bella claimed Irena was faking her passion for hiking just to get close to Locky.

'She does hike! I'm seeing it with my own eyes!' grinned Locky after placing a kiss on his ladylove's lips.
