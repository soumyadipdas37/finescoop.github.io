Every stylish woman knows that denim is a wardrobe must-have.

It's so easy to style, can be worn for almost any occasion and always looks good. That's why we all have cupboards spilling over with jeans, shirts, dresses, jackets and shorts all in various shades and washes of denim. 

But it's not just grown up girls who look gorgeous in this ultra versatile material.

A well cut pair of jeans looks great on men and little ones look adorable in denim too. Plus, when it comes to kids, this is one fabric that can be washed and tumble dried over and over again. Bonus! 

So why not give your family's wardrobes a bit of an upgrade with some brand spanking new denim pieces to see them through autumn and beyond?

That's the other thing about denim; it's ALWAYS on trend. 

Check out our top picks for all the gang. 

Dapper dads

If your man is stuck in a bit of a style rut then help dig him out with some new duds.

Denim is a good option as it retains its relaxed and laid back vibe even when it's a slightly smarter take on the look.

This shirt by Tommy Jeans, for example, has a sleek slim fit and in a darker wash is elevated to ideal date night wear.

And encourage him to believe that wearing it with jeans (i.e. double denim) is totally fine. It's all about how its styled and ensuring there's a difference in the shades of blue. These Levi's 501 straight cut jeans are just the thing.

No skinny jeans on our men please. That look is over, unless you're in a rock 'n' roll band. Everyone else just looks like they're a regular on TOWIE.

L-R: Tommy Jeans TJM Western Denim Shirt (£65) and Levi's 501 93 Straight Fit Jean (were £95, now £76) at Very

River Island Classic Fit Denim Jacket (£45) at Very

And for some light outerwear to layer over a T-shirt or fine knit sweater this season, he can't go wrong with a denim jacket like this one by River Island.

Gorgeous girls

As discussed, children look sweet in denim and thanks to its inherent durability it doesn't matter if playtime in the park leads to stains and scuffs.  

Dungarees are a cute look for girls of all ages and we like this pair by Mango Girls in a cool black wash.

Layer them over a long sleeve tee now, switching to polo necks when the temperature drops.

And the same layering trick can be used with this very stylish boilersuit by Mintie by Mint Velvet. And both all-in-ones can be worn with trainers too.

L-R: Mango Girls Denim Dungarees (£26) and Mintie by Mint Velvet Girls Zip Denim Jumpsuit (£45) at Very

River Island Girls Denim Smock Dress (£20) at Very

And for a more feminine take on denim, this smock dress from River Island's Girls collection is lovely. It's warm enough to wear it with bare legs at the moment and a pair of opaque tights will take it all the way through 'til next spring.

Brilliant boys

Your little man will be a cool little dude in some well chosen denim. 

If you can persuade him to ditch the football strip this short sleeve shirt is relaxed and ideal for weekends and days with the family.

And a pair of Levi's Boys 511s will stand him in good stead for days spent hanging out with friends. Even a temperamental teen couldn't argue with these classics.

L-R: V by Very Boys Short Sleeved Denim Shirt (was from £10, now from £7) and Levi's Boys 511 Slim Fit Jeans (from £30) at Very

Levi's Boys Denim Trucker Jacket (from £55) at Very

And just like dad, a denim trucker provides enough coverage for this transitional time of year.

Trendy toddlers 

Even the tiniest members of the family can be included in the denim trend.

And these outfit sets by V by Very are an efficient and affordable way to dress your mini mes. 

We love the polka dots and embroidered cherries on this sweet little denim dress and who can resist the frills on that white T-shirt? 

L-R: V by Very Girls T-shirt and Spotted Denim Dress Set (was from £20, now from £14) and V by Very Boys Tee And Denim Dungaree Set (was from £20, now from £13) at Very

And this cute striped top and denim dungarees set is a practical choice for little ones who are beginning to toddle about under their own steam.

Fashion maven mums 

Don't worry we're not leaving out the MOST stylish member of the family.

After all, denim is great for busy days that take in a school run, a dog walk and a diary full of work meetings. 

This lovely shirt with its ruffle collar is the perfect pick for all those video calls (and for anyone who's back in an office) and will look fab tucked into a leather midi skirt or tailored trousers.

And for jeans that flatter, these high waisted straight leg jeans will elongate the pins while also adding a bit of retro edge thanks to that cool bleached wash.

L-R: V by Very Ruffle Neck Long Sleeve Soft Denim Shirt (£28) and River Island High Waist Tapered Jean (£40) at Very

V by Very Faux Fur Lined Denim Jacket (£50) at Very

And postpone wearing your heavy winter coat for a while yet with this great denim jacket.

With its faux fur lining it'll keep you toasty well into winter.
