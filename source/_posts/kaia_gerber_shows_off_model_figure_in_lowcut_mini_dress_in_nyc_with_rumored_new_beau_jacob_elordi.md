She spent the best part of the summer hanging out with model and actress Cara Delevingne.

But lately, Kaia Gerber has appeared to be inseparable from Australian actor Jacob Elordi.

The 19-year-model and the 23-year-old star of The Kissing Booth and Euphoria were spotted out and about together in New York again on Wednesday.

Inseparable: Kaia Gerber, 19, was seen out and about in New York City with Australian actor Jacob Elordi, 23, again on Wednesday, continuing to fuel romance rumors between the pair

Kaia wore a floral print mini dress for the outing which she paired with black lace-up ankle boots.

She flashed cleavage in the frock thanks to its plunging neckline and the thigh-skimming ruffled hem showcased her long legs.

The daughter of Cindy Crawford wore her tinted pink bobbed hair tucked behind her ears and had on a black cloth face mask.

Jacob was more casually attired in a white t-shirt, blue jeans and tan shoes and in addition to a disposable mask, he sported a cap and sunglasses.

Earlier in the day, the pair had been snapped leaving a gym after a joint workout session.

Fueling rumors of a new romance, the purported lovebirds didn't practice social distancing and at one point, Jacob's hand lingered on Kaia's arm as they exited the building together. 

It's thought that they were introduced to one another by 13 Reasons Why actor Tommy Dorfman, a mutual friend whom they have both been spending time with during the coronavirus lockdown.

Then she sparked dating rumors after she and Delevingne, 28, were spotted affectionately embracing at a Black Lives Matter rally in July.

They also got matching 'Solemate' tattoos on their feet in August. 

However, a source told E! that the teen beauty is happy playing the field right now as she focuses on her career. 

'Kaia is the one that doesn't want to be in an exclusive relationship right now. She has a lot of projects on her plate and wants her freedom,' the source said.

'She does love hanging out with Jacob and they are spending time in New York City for the week while she works.'
