Francesca Packer-Barham may be worth over a billion dollars but the heiress proved she is just like the rest of us on Sunday. 

The 25-year-old eschewed the designer duds and dressed down in an eclectic, comfortable outfit as she headed to her best friend Ian Stewart's birthday party in Sydney.

Francesca opted for a loose, navy-blue sweat shirt with white graphic lettering across the front.

She teamed it with a pair of white tights in mixed pale blue designs, including paisley print, adding a hint of boho to the ensemble. 

A pair of white sneakers added to the cosy look, and she wore a wide-brimmed straw hat with embroidery  lettering across the rim. 

Francesca did flaunt some of her wealth, carrying a Louis Vuitton bag and wearing a string of pearls.

She carried her phone in one hand, along with a gift for her friend, which was nestled in a white paper carrier bag. 

Opting for a pink-toned make-up look, the brunette looked natural and relaxed as she joined her friends on a balcony, holding a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne. 

No stranger to dressing up for an event, while Francesca is not often seen in public, she does like to frock up for a fancy occasion.

The niece of billionaire businessman and casino baron James Packer did flash some cash recently. 

She reportedly set a new record, spending more than half a million at a recent jewellery auction. 

Private Sydney claimed the heiress was the mystery bidder of a stunning diamond ring, which went under the hammer by auction house Leonard Joel.

The brunette beauty, who counts PR queen Roxy Jacenko as one of her famous friends, reportedly dropped a cool $575,000 for the emerald cut diamond.
