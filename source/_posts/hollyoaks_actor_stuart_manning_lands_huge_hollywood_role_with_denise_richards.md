Stuart also posted several selfies from on set, while he also showed footage of stuntmen riding horses along past a small lake.  

In his captions for these posts, Stuart revealed that these snaps are from his time on set by including the hashtag #glowanddarkness.  

On one particular selfie featuring Stuart and three other actors, he wrote: 'Working with these guys on #glowanddarkness has been a dream. I can’t wait to share it with you all soon'.

 Writer Alejandro Gillermo Roemmers created the series, while Denise Richards, 49, and Jane Seymour, 69, are both set to star.

Being cast in the series will be a welcome change for Stuart, after it was revealed in 2018 that he was working as a delivery driver in between acting gigs. 

Stuart first hinted to his fans that he would be taking part in the programme back in March, when he shared a snap of himself with a massive bushy beard and longer hair.

The look is a striking change from his days on Hollyoaks, when he sported a clean-shaven look with short back and sides.
