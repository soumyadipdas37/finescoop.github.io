A group of volunteers have paid $600 in parking fines after leaving their cars on an empty street while they went around feeding the homeless. 

Brisbane River City Rotary Club members Will Bassett, Brooke Thomas and four others parked their vehicles on Qualtrough Street, in Woolloongabba, in late June.

They then walked around the city delivering warm meals to people living rough on the streets, before returning to find they had all been slapped with $100 fines.

Despite asking three times to be let off, Brisbane City Council refused to take back the fines. 

The typical two hour parking limit on the street was reduced to 15 minutes because an AFL game was being played at the nearby Gabba Stadium.

The time change occurs whenever an event is being held at the sporting venue and applies to all the streets that fall within the 'Gabba Traffic Area', 9 News reported. 

Mr Bassett admitted he was unaware of the time change and had regularly parked his car on the street during a food run.

'We thought it was two-hour parking as has been for most of the other time - but just on that day it had moved down to 15 minutes,' he said. 

Ms Thomas said it was a blow to the gut to be punished for helping other people.

'I had just given up my Sunday afternoon to organise and arrange these meals and to be hit with a fine was pretty disappointing,' Ms Thomas added.  

Brisbane City Council said it was the responsibility of drivers to be aware of the time limits.

Daily Mail Australia contacted Brisbane City Council for comment.
