Trent Alexander-Arnold has been named as the PFA Young Player of the Year for the 2019-20 season after a superb season for Premier League champions Liverpool. 

The 21-year-old beat Manchester United quartet Dean Henderson, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood, Chelsea duo Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic as well as Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish to the award.

He is the first Liverpool player to win the award since Steven Gerrard in 2001, with the last two editions of the accolade going to Manchester City duo Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane.

Alexander-Arnold played in every single Premier League game as Klopp's side registered 99 points as they romped to the top-flight title with relative ease.  

The Englishman contributed four goals and a whopping 13 assists despite playing on the right-hand side of the Liverpool defence. He finished second in the assists charts for the 2019-20 campaign to Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne, who laid on 20. 

His contributions meant the Merseyside club lifted their first ever Premier League trophy and their first top-flight success in 30 years.

The 21-year-old scored four goals and registered 13 assists over the course of the season

The right-back has since made 134 appearances in all competitions for the club and also helped his side win the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup in 2019.
