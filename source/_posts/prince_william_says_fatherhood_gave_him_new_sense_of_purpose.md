Prince William will reveal that fatherhood gave him a 'new sense of purpose' and helped spur him to protect the natural world in his new conservation documentary set to air next month.

The Duke of Cambridge will share his passion for the planet and search for ways to restore the environment for the next generation in his new ITV documentary Prince William: A Planet For Us All. 

The arrival of the new documentary, which was filmed by a production team two years ago, comes as Prince William gears up to join a star-studded line-up to give a virtual TED talk about climate change in October.

In his documentary, the prince will say: 'I have always loved nature and fatherhood has given me a new sense of purpose.' 

The royal, who shares children George, seven, Charlotte, five, and two year-old Louis, with wife Kate Middleton, will also describe how becoming a father helped change his outlook on the world.

He continued: 'Now I have got George, Charlotte and now Louis in my life - your outlook does change. You want to hand over to the next generation, the wildlife in a much better condition.

'Two years ago a film crew joined me on my search for ways to protect the natural world.

'I've always believed it's possible to give the young people hope and belief that things can get fixed. I have the belief that if we all work together we can make a difference.'

During the show, the prince meets people in the UK and abroad who are playing their part in protecting and restoring the environment, according to Kensington Palace.

The documentary also charts his journey from being passionate about conservation to wanting to play a greater global leadership role on the environment, the palace added. 

Naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who also makes an appearance in the programme, said: 'Kids know an awful lot about what is happening to the world.'

The royal will appear alongside a panel of keen environmentalist and celebrities at TED's Countdown Global Launch on October 10 to discuss how the world can tackle global warming and ensure a better, healthier future for the planet.

The Duke will be joined by impassioned activists at the online conference including Al Gore, and Hollywood stars Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jaden Smith. 

Earlier this year, Prince William launched the Earthshot Prize initiative, declaring the Earth was at a 'tipping point' and humans had just ten years to save the world.  

The Duke will take part in the fourth and final session of the conference, appearing alongside climate change activists, engineers and pop stars.

The session, which is titled 'Breakthroughs' is described online as 'exploring the nexus of protection, regeneration and transformation using powerful examples.
