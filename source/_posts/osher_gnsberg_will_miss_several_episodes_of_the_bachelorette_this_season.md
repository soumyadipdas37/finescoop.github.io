Channel 10 has confirmed that Osher Günsberg will be absent from a large portion of the upcoming season of The Bachelorette.

This is because he is self-isolating in Melbourne following a coronavirus outbreak last month on set of The Masked Singer, which he also hosts.

The Bachelorette is being filmed at a mansion in Oxford Falls, Sydney.

A network spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'He will not appear in some of the later episodes due to quarantine restrictions.'

Despite missing several episodes this season, Osher remains the official host of the dating show.

Channel 10 did not confirm whether a temporary replacement had been arranged.

Rumours are swirling that The Project's Tommy Little or former Bachelorette Sophie Monk could possibly step in.

The network previously said that filming of The Bachelorette was not impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak on The Masked Singer last month.

A Channel 10 representative said on August 23: 'The filming of The Bachelorette is not affected.'

Last month, seven dancers working on The Masked Singer tested positive for coronavirus. The show's stars, including Osher, were forced to self-isolate. 

The program is being filmed in Melbourne, which is at the centre of Australia's coronavirus second wave.

Osher has originally been scheduled to return to Sydney to continue hosting the sixth season of The Bachelorette immediately after production wrapped on the singing show.

 The Bachelorette began filming at the Bachelor mansion in Oxford Falls in late July.

Exclusive photos obtained by Daily Mail Australia showed this year's two Bachelorettes, sisters Elly and Becky Miles, meeting their suitors on the red carpet.
