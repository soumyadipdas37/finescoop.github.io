Sam Newman has backtracked on his extraordinary call to fellow Melburnians to protest the city's Stage Four lockdown measures after Victoria Police threatened to arrest him.

The polarising 300-game AFL champion and former Footy Show host sparked controversy on Sunday night when he called on Victorians to take to the streets in 'hopefully a state day of coordination'.

'Of all the protests that we have put up with, how about a quarter million of us gather in the CBD to take the City/State back, before EVERY previous march will have been pointless,' Newman tweeted.

The tweet landed Newman in hot water with Victoria Police, who threatened to arrest him for 'inciting a mass protest' against the measures introduced by Premier Daniel Andrews.

Newman set the record straight on Tuesday.

'I didn't encourage a quarter of a million people to march through the street,' he told Sunrise. 

'I said wouldn't it be great to have 250,000 people wandering through the city - I don't encourage people to do that but it was just a sign that this government should cautiously reopen business enterprises in the city before it rusts over.'

He reiterated calls for the Victorian government to reopen Melbourne as the city enters its fifth week of strict lockdown, which may be extended beyond September 13.

It comes as Victoria recorded 70 new cases and five deaths on Tuesday.

'Everyone's business is essential to someone. How about, instead of announcing the covert figures every other minute of what is happening, someone comes out and says that it would a good idea if we got act to reopening, rebooting the city,'  Newman said.

'It is nonsense to think we have to close down the whole of the central business district because we cannot be asked or cannot be given free chance to cautiously reopen enterprise here in Melbourne.'

Newman fired up after he was grilled by Sunrise host David Koch, who tried to defend the lockdown measures.

'It is alright for you Kochie, you are lolling about up in the beach up there telling us what we should or should not do. But we're down here locked up in what is virtually a prison,' he hit back.

'I said wouldn't it be great to think that people would be that annoyed about what is going on in this city, looking it down completely without cautiously reopening it. 

'I am not asking people to come from all over Victoria to protest. I'm not trying to get the police involved in this.'

'If they want to arrest me and put me in jail for this, that is fine. But I am not suggesting it. I never did in the first place.'

Newman later addressed his tweet on his weekly You Cannot Be Serious podcast, where he came under fire from co-hosts who labelled him 'irresponsible'.

'All I was trying to do was get enough people to get attention … I'm not advocating for people to come from all over Victoria to march up the city,' Newman explained on the podcast.

'I'm not advocating a rally as such. I just said wouldn't it be great that 250,000 people would march in the city. That is hyperbole, that is designed to get the attention of the government cautiously reopening business.  

'I couldn't give a stuff if they open the city or not because I don't have a business but people are actually about to lose their livelihoods through the inaction and the tringent requirements that this government is putting on people.

'All they do is tell you how many people have died and how many have contracted this virus. There's got to be other things they can speak about.' 

Newman fired off his extraordinary tweet after anti-lockdown protesters clashed with police in a dramatic stand-off in Broadmeadows in the city's north on Sunday night.  

AFL champion and former Footy Show host Sam Newman is known for his polarising views and Victoria Police has now threatened to arrest him for inciting protesters to gather in their hundreds of thousands to protest against Melbourne's Stage Four restrictions 

A Victoria Police spokesman said the force had its sights set on those they claim are 'coordinating and encouraging protest activity' on Saturday. 

MMA Fighter Vik Grujic responded to Newman's tweet by urging him to attend the Freedom Day mass gathering planned for that day in Melbourne's CBD - to which the footy great replied 'OK'. 

'Victoria Police expects to make further arrests over coming days in respect to individuals suspected of inciting illegal activity,' a spokesman said.

'Organising and participating in this protest would be a serious and blatant breach of the Chief Health Officer's directions and jeopardises the health of the entire community.

'Those still thinking of attending the CBD to protest can expect a swift and firm response from police.' 

The state's police force added its officers would not hesitate in issuing $1,652 fines or making arrests if breaches of Victoria's public health orders occur.

In a video post shared by Channel Seven on Monday, Newman said he intended to gather with protesters in the streets of Melbourne on Saturday if COVID-19 restrictions in the city were not eased. 

'They probably shouldn't [gather] but if the government act responsibly then we will act responsibly and not go there,' he said.

'Just give us a bit of easing of restrictions. I might use my hour's freedom and wear a mask and go into the city as part of my recreation and exercise and be part of the gathering.'

After one Melburnian suggested Newman had 'incited a riot' with his comments on Twitter, the footy great added: 'There'll be no rioting. No looting. No arson. No violence. Just an expression of desperation for our sanity.' 

'Very irresponsible from Sam Newman,' she said. 

'That's someone who was running for Melbourne mayor. If you want to be in lockdown for another six months then sure - join the protest.'  

Defending his position on the restrictions, Newman said it was the state government who were being irresponsible by enforcing economically-crippling social distancing restrictions. 

'If the Victorian government stop being irresponsible through this blanket lockdown, then we'll stop being irresponsible by urging mass rallies,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Monday.

'Give the hospitality, leisure, education, business and public service enterprises in this state a paradigm for a responsible return to civilization, rather than the hysteria being disseminated, while the country and world pushes on, carefully.' 

Sam Newman was flooded with responses following his plea to Melburnians on Sunday night

Fellow Melburnians desperate to regain their freedom joined the bandwagon on Sunday night in response to Newman's tweet. 

'Just tell me when and where never protested before but this is the most important thing we have faced in my lifetime. We ordinary Victorians must take our state back,' one man wrote.

Another added: 'A protest at some point needs to happen so our political class can get a sense of the real opposition to the unbalanced measures put in place.'

Another fan commended Newman on his wording.

'You didn't even mention what march, and even mentioned a State Day of coordination. Could be a march for Prostate Cancer. Or even a Pro Dan Andrews march. Could be a march of social distancing examples. Very cleverly worded,' one man posted.

But not everyone supported Newman.

'I have read your tweet three times and it's still incomprehensible. But good luck with whatever self-indulgent, poorly-conceived action you're proposing,' one woman posted. 

Another added: 'Of all the things you have said, this is highly irresponsible, you know your position... it's with these people's lives that you earned your living.'

Newman's tweet sparked a divisive reaction from the public (comments pictured)

Metropolitan Melbourne is subject to stage four restrictions including an evening curfew and a ban on travelling beyond a five-kilometre radius of home until at least September 13 amid reports strict lockdown measures will be extended.

Regional Victoria is under stage three restrictions which allows residents to leave home for essential purposes.

On Sunday night, confronting footage taken in Broadmeadows, in Melbourne's north, showed dozens of men dressed down in tracksuits and masks making their way through the streets as traffic was brought to a standstill.

The protesters claimed, when asked, that they were simply getting their daily exercise, which they are permitted to do within a five kilometre radius on their homes.

At least six people were arrested during the protests and police have not ruled out issuing further infringement notices. 

Victoria's stage four restrictions are due to end in two weeks, but the Premier has indicated they will likely be extended. Pictured are anti-lockdown protesters clashing with police in Melbourne's north on Sunday night

The latest protest comes anti-lockdown walkers were doused with pepper spray and struggled with police in Dandenong in Melbourne's south-east last Wednesday as community frustration with draconian Stage 4 restrictions reached boiling point.

Police issued $15,000 in fines and arrested four men.

Tensions in Dandenong had been flaring for days after a large group of residents decided to start walking at the same time and place.
