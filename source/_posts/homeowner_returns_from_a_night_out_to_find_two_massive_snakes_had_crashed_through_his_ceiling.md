A Queensland man got the shock of his life when he returned home from a night out to discover two snakes weighing about 18kg had crashed through his ceiling. 

David Tait found the huge coastal pythons in his Lacey's Creek home, north-west of Brisbane, on Monday after walking inside to find part of the fibro ceiling in his dining room had crashed to the floor.

Mr Tait went searching through his home and found the 2.5m and 2.8m snakes, one in his bedroom and the other in the living area. 

Steven Brown, 38, from Brisbane North Snake Catchers and Relocation, told Daily Mail Australia they were 'some of the fattest snakes' he had ever seen.

Mr Brown said the snakes - weighing about 10kg and 8kg - may have been fighting over a female and there was a chance she was still close by. 

'I did try looking for the potential female but there was no way I could get into the roof - it was impossible to get my arm in there. The home used to be the old Lacey Creek State School,' he said.

Mr Brown, who has been into snakes for the past 10 years and owned his own business for three, added it had been a busy start to snake season, which usually kicks off on September 1.

'It actually picked up about a month ago,' he said.

'Normally snake and breeding season starts on the first of Spring and I don't get many calls until a couple of weeks into it ... but this season has started early and it's been busy.

'I think that's because of the warm winter we had ... we didn't get that cold we usually do.'

One of the snakes was located in the bedroom of the Queensland home (pictured), which used to be the 'old Lacey Creek State School'

Meanwhile, Mr Tait said he occasionally sees snakes on his metal roof enjoying the sun.

'We have a lot of bush around here so you do see snakes,' he told The Courier Mail.  

'When I came back this morning there was a large slab (of ceiling) on the kitchen table.

'I guessed what had happened and went looking. I found one snake in the bedroom and we found one in the lounge room.'

Mr Brown said with spring just around the corner the incident was a timely reminder to be aware of snakes as breeding season begins. 

Social media users were shocked by the pictures. 

'Must be some good rats or possums on the menu there,' one user wrote. 

'Omg this is my fear. How heavy would these snakes be? And how can you keep them out of the roof?' another added. 

'They are gorgeous! They just need to brush up on their hide and seek skills a bit,' a third user joked.  

Mr Brown safely relocated the snakes and said they may have been fighting over a female and there was a chance she was still close by
