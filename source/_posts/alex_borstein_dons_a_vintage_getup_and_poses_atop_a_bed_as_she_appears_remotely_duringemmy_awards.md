Many nominees appeared remotely to learn the fate of their nominations during the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday evening.

And Alex Borstein put on an exceptionally glamorous display by lounging atop a giant bed located on her home's balcony, appearing very different from her character on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. 

The 49-year-old, who was nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy category, sipped on a glass of scotch and had on an ensemble worthy of 1940s starlet.

She wore a silky pink robe with black lace detailing that she layered over a black night gown.

Borstein rocked a bright blonde wig styled in glamorous finger waves and she had a pair of patent black pumps. 

The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel star had her adorable Yorkshire Terrier by her side as she and her fellow nominees Zoomed into their portion of the award show.

She was joined by her Mrs. Maisel co-star Marin Hinkle and fellow acclaimed actresses Insecure's Yvonne Orji, Glow's Betty Gilpin, The Good Place's D'arcy Carden, SNL's Kate Mckinnon, SNL's Cecily Strong, and Schitt's Creek star Annie Murphy.

The award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy ended up going to Murphy.

And, showing off her playful side, Alex pretended to be outraged by her snub by dramatically wailing 'What!?' into the camera.

Once Annie, who was surrounded by her Schitt's Creek castmates, finished giving her emotional acceptance speech, Emmys producers made sure to cut back to Alex so that audiences at home could further appreciate her set-up.

Alex plays the role of Susie Myerson on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, which earned her the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy in 2018 and 2019.

She has also earned several nominations for her voice over work in the popular adult animated series, Family Guy.

At this year's Emmy Awards, the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel earned 20 nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series and all of the main acting categories.

The series, which is available to stream on Amazon Prime, premiered in 2017 and wrapped its third season in December of 2019.

The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel was picked up for a fourth season, but, due to delays caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic, production has been thwarted.

The 72nd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards was a first of its kind event, which featured presenters in full hazmat gear, personally delivering awards to winners' homes.  

Host Jimmy Kimmel recorded live from Downtown Los Angeles, while producers sent more than 150 video kits to other talent, for them to record from home.
