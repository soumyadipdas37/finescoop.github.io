Laura Dern took part in an Instagram Live last week, from her home in Los Angeles - even though she was thought to be in the UK shooting the latest Jurassic World sequel.

The actress has been filming at Pinewood Studios, England, with her original Jurassic Park co-stars Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum - returning as a trio for the first time in the sixth film in the franchise.

But Laura, 53, cropped up on Instagram on Friday, taking part in a live chat with former UN ambassador Samantha Power, in support of presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Is Laura Dern KILLED OFF in Jurassic World: Dominion? The actress [pictured in 1993's Jurassic Park] has returned home to LA while her co-stars Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum remain in the UK shooting the dinosaur sequel

This came as a surprise to many fans watching the broadcast who had believed her to be in England, and many asked her about it in the comments.

But Laura and Samantha focused on politics, leaving the dinosaur chat out of it and Laura's return a mystery.

This begs the question - does her character, Dr Ellie Sattler - meet a sticky end in Jurassic World: Dominion.

Co-stars Sam and Jeff - who play Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ian Malcolm respectively - are meanwhile still together in the UK - even uploading a video of the pair of them performing a duet on the piano on Monday.

But Laura's return to Hollywood suggests her role in the new film is smaller than her co-stars, or that she has merely completed shooting so she can return to other projects in America.

MailOnline has approached Dern's rep for comment. 

If her role is watered down for Jurassic World: Dominion, does this mean a dinosaur finally gets the better of Dr Sattler.

Goldblum has already teased the first scene he shot with Neill and Dern as they returned to the franchise. 

And it sounds like it was a life or death scenario.

Killed off? Goldblum has already teased a life or death scene with Dern, saying, 'it was me and Laura and Sam in a jeep. I can't tell you any more about it, but it was very thrilling' [pictured in a 2018 ad for Jeep]

'It was a very thrilling day on set,' he told Entertainment Weekly. 'It was me and Laura and Sam in a jeep. I can't tell you any more about it, but it was very thrilling.'

He elaborated to Insider: 'The first thing that we shot... it was a scene with me and Laura Dern and Sam Neil and we were — I can't tell you much — but we were all day in a very tight, enclosed space.

'You'll see — it's a mystery you'll solve when you see [the movie]. The three of us were in a tiny little space and we were being menaced by — I can't even tell you — a surprising faction of prehistoric creatures that you've never seen before.' 

Fate? If her role is watered down for Jurassic World: Dominion, does this mean a dinosaur finally gets the better of Dr Sattler?

If Dr Sattler - who, in Jurassic Park I survived attacks from Velociraptors and a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and in Jurassic Park III saved the day from afar - does get killed off, it's likely to be near the end of the new film, as Neill previously told The Guardian: 'We're all the way through the film, Jeff, and me, and Laura.'

He was sure to assure fans that the trio of scientists - who will join newer stars of the franchise Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt in dealing with a troupe of dinosaurs loose on the mainland - will be involved in the action scenes.

'I can't give anything away, but a real-life dinosaur is a compelling thing to someone who has devoted his life to them,' he said of his paleontologist character's return. 'There will be screaming. We know this.'
