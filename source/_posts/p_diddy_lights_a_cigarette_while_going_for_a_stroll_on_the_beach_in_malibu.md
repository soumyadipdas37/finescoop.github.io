He is a successful rapper and businessman who is said to have an estimated net worth of $740million (£571million).

And P Diddy opted for a laid back look as he lit up a cigarette while going for a stroll on the beach in Malibu with a friend on Tuesday.

The record producer, 50, cut a casual figure in a light green hoodie with a bird print and dark green shorts.

The father-of-six also sported a white T-shirt and went barefoot for the outing. 

Diddy takes frequent trips to the beaches in Malibu and was recently spotted hanging out with fellow rappers Nas, Travis Scott, Quavo, and Swizz Beatz.

The entrepreneur owns a palatial mansion in Beverly Hills which he is said to have purchased for $40million (£30.9million) in 2014.

Diddy recently lent his voice to a political cause, along with over 100 other African-American public figures and leaders, which related to Joe Biden's Vice President choice.

The letter, which was published in the Atlanta Daily World on August 10, encouraged the 77-year-old Democratic presidential hopeful to 'choose a Black woman VP.'

'As someone who has said throughout the campaign that VP Joe Biden needs to choose a Black woman VP, the urgency for that pick has gone from something that SHOULD happen to something that HAS to happen,' read one portion of the emotionally charged letter.

'Failing to select a Black woman in 2020 means you will lose the election.

'We don't want to choose between the lesser of two evils and we don't want to vote the devil we know versus the devil we don't because we are tired of voting for devils—period.'

A day after the powerful letter was published, Biden announced that he had chosen U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, 55, as his running mate.
