Fans of some non-League clubs will be able to attend their teams' return to action this weekend — but won't be allowed a view of the pitch.

The Government have banned teams in the top six tiers from hosting supporters, and their fans also are not allowed to go to away games against lower-league opponents in FA Cup qualifiers. 

Wealdstone, who host Chesterfield in the National League on Saturday, will host a live screening of the game in the Ruislip Social Club at the Grosvenor Vale ground.

But all windows will be blockaded and views of the pitch closed off, so punters will be watching a match on TV that is unfolding yards away from them.

Corinthian Casuals, who face Dulwich Hamlet in the Cup on Saturday, branded the rules 'utterly baffling'.

They added: 'As the coronavirus is clearly clever enough to differentiate between supporters of Step 2 and 3 clubs, supporters of National League clubs — which include Dulwich Hamlet — are banned from spectating.'

Meanwhile, a Government bailout for the National League is expected soon.

Macclesfield Town have been expelled from the National League 13 days after being wound up.
