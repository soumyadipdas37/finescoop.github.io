He told HollywoodLife last week: 'Right now, the little one is actually in Phoenix and not in LA because Nicole will have to shoot a few things for Total Bellas. 

'And the [past] couple of days have pretty much like, just by myself, which I find it very, very lonely. I used to come home and just hold a bundle of joy in my hands. And it really just the most amazing thing.'

But he said the family was watching him on the show: 'He woke up, there was a big watch party today in Phoenix. Nicole and her sister [Brie Bella] and all the babies. And [Matteo] was actually awake to see the dance. I was like, "Yes, let’s go!"
