She has recently returned from a sun-soaked holiday in Turkey.  

And Ashley Roberts showed off her bronzed tan as she left work at Heart Radio Breakfast in London on Monday. 

The Pussycat Dolls star, 38, put on a leggy display in a stylish monochrome shirt dress as she left Global Studios.

The dress featured puff-ball sleeves and a black bandeau corseted waist, while the skirt came complete with a thick black trim. 

She accentuated her toned legs with black stilettos and accessorised her outfit with cat-eye sunglasses, a pearl necklace and a leather handbag. 

Ashley wore her blonde locks back in a low ponytail and amped up the glamour with a polished make-up look.

The When I Grow Up hitmaker appeared in high spirits as she strutted into Global Studios.  

Ashley reunited with Amanda Holden last week after taking a break in Turkey. 

Ahead of her return to work, the American dancer took to Instagram to share a scenic bikini-clad snap by the sea.

The Don't Cha hitmaker looked phenomenal in a barely-there red bikini. 

She added a caption: 'She holy hunni. How beautiful?! Here’s to looking and hoping for a brighter rest of 2020 #wecanhope #adventure #motherearth #grateful'.

Ashley revealed last month she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future. Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption.

 'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'

Ashley also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29. 

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018. 

She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.' 

She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.'
