A paedophile asked a young girl if she wanted to play a game of 'tip-tip' in the bushes before snatching and molesting her when she refused, a court has heard.

Sebastian Ngurruwuthun, 23, was jailed for a minimum of three years and five months in Darwin's Supreme Court this week over the brazen attack on an 11-year-old in May last year.

The court heard the young girl and her family met other parents and children at Nightcliff, in the city's north, to enjoy the annual Seabreeze festival, NT News reports.

Sebastian Ngurruwuthun, 23, has been jailed after a horrific attack on an 11-year-old girl at Sunset Park (pictured) during a family-friendly Darwin festival in May last year

As the parents set up a picnic, the victim and her younger sister began playing with other children in Sunset Park, at which point Ngurruwuthun started watching the group from a distance.   

He approached after seeing her alone and asked if she was wanted to play 'tip-tip' with him, pointing to an isolated area nearby.  

When the girl said no, Ngurruwuthun covered her mouth and dragged her into a shaded section of the park where he indecently assaulted her while pinning her to the ground. 

The horrific attack ended a short time later when a heroic resident rushed over after hearing her terrified screams, scaring the attacker away. 

In a victim impact statement tendered in court, the girl said she had feared for her life during the terrifying incident. 

'When my mum hugged me straight after the assault, I didn’t like it, I wanted to be free,' the girl wrote.

'At the time of the assault, I thought I was going to be kidnapped and I was going to die. I did fight back and shout and scream but I was scared that if I hurt him too much he would hurt me worse.' 

Ngurruwuthun pleaded  guilty to abduction and committing an act of gross indecency. 

During sentencing, Justice Judith Kelly noted he did not appear to show any empathy for his victim and continued the assault despite her screams and obvious distress.  

He was sentenced to four years and ten months behind bars, but will be eligible for parole after three years and five months.
