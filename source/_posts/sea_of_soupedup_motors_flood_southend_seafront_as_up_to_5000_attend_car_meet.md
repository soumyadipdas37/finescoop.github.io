A sea of souped-up motors flooded the Southend seafront last night as up to 5,000 petrol-heads attended an unofficial bank holiday car meet.

Police went to the Essex town to break up the gathering, which was illegal due to coronavirus restrictions preventing groups of more than 30 meeting together with the threat of a £10,000 fine for the organiser. 

Officers ordered the motorists to go home but did not issue any fines, although a driver was taken into custody nearby for driving without a number plate.

Today an Essex Police spokesman said officers were able to 'peacefully' break up the event but could not confirm how many people attended.

A spokesman for Safer Southend said: 'Officers are patrolling an unauthorised car cruise in Southend tonight with colleagues from Southend Police.

'There is currently an injunction in place in Southend to protect residents from any dangerous driving and ASB. Good engagements thus far and no issues.'

Meanwhile, the roads policing unit tweeted: 'Very lucky to have support from officers KD & EC this evening, whilst interacting with drivers of a Southend car meet they spotted a vehicle with no front number plate, unfortunately for the driver they have also failed a road side drug test - custody for 1 #NoExcuse.'

The threat of £10,000 fines for illegal gatherings were introduced after a series of mass raves.  

The first in London was issued to Jeremy Corbyn's brother Piers for a 'Unite for Freedom' rally in Trafalgar Square on Saturday.  

The 73-year-old meteorologist led more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters who believe coronavirus is a hoax before he was seen being hauled off by officers. 

He was among eight other offenders who were fined across the rest of England under new measures imposed on Friday.

The others that were fined had all been organising raves or house parties. 

A council spokesman confirmed the car meet (pictured) was unauthorised and that officers had spoken to those involved
