Arsenal's hopes of landing midfielder Houssem Aouar from Lyon are set to take a boost, with the French side looking likely to have found a potential replacement according to reports.

Aouar has been linked with a potential £45million swoop to the Emirates Stadium but Arsenal and Lyon have been unable to agree a fee.

However according to L'Equipe, Lucas Paqueta could be on his way to the French side from AC Milan, which could pave the way for Aouar to complete a Premier League move.

The report claims Paqueta is set to complete his transfer in the next few days after the Italian giants accepted an £18m bid for the Brazilian, with Milan due a percentage of any future sell-on fee.

Lyon had previously had a loan offer turned down with a £15milllion option to buy at the end of the season.

Although the transfer would make Lyon more comfortable with the idea of selling Aouar, there is still plenty of difference between last year's Champions League semi-finalists and the Gunners.

Lyon president Michel Aulas confirmed that they had received a 'tame' offer for the star from the Gunners, as they look to secure £45million for his services.

The 22-year-old could well be the missing piece to link Arsenal's midfield and attack, with his creativity likely to help unleash the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexander Lacazette.

Aouar scored nine goals and provided 10 assists in 41 outings for Rudi Garcia's side last season, and was instrumental in them reaching the Champions League semi finals. 

Arsenal though are running out of time to complete any deal, with the transfer window closing on Monday.
