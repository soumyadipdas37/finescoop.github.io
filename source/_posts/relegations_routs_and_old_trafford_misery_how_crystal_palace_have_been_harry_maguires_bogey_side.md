Since a seesaw 3-3 draw against Crystal Palace with Hull City in December 2016, Harry Maguire has suffered seven Premier League defeats against his nemeses.

The Eagles have had a field day against the England defender, scoring at least three past a defence marshalled by Maguire on six of the nine occasions when they have faced him.

Maguire's latest misery came on Saturday, when United slumped to a limp 3-1 defeat after their captain and central defensive partner Victor Lindelof were given a torrid time by the visitors.

Wilfried Zaha tormented United's defence before his late double added to Jordan Ayew's early opener, and the impact of both players will have been wearily familiar to Maguire.

Ayew also set Palace on their way to a 2-1 win at Old Trafford in August 2019, seizing on United's defensive frailities just weeks after Maguire had completed his long-awaited £80million move to the club from Leicester.

His record for his former team against Palace was even worse. Zaha again scored twice as his side ran riot with a 4-1 win at the King Power Stadium the previous February, leading to the hapless Claude Puel being sacked the following day.

Palace captain Luka Milivojevic scored a late penalty that day, and there had been nothing Maguire could do about the midfielder's superb long-range effort that had consigned Leicester to a 1-0 defeat at Selhurst Park two months earlier.

That defeat was still an improvement on the three successive thrashings Maguire had previously endured against opponents he must be sick of encountering.

Then regarded as one of the finest defenders not to play for a top-six club, the centre-back's reputation was not enhanced by an 8-0 aggregate scoreline against Palace during the 2017/18 season.

Zaha was again in on the act, joining striker Christian Benteke in scoring in both games as Palace won 3-0 at Leicester before a late-season 5-0 home rout featuring a late Patrick van Aanholt goal.

Benteke's last-gasp penalty in that spectacular second drubbing came after the targetman was fouled by Maguire and signalled the beginning of the end for Puel.

At least Leicester steered clear of safety that season. A month before Maguire signed for the Foxes, he suffered relegation with Hull courtesy of a 4-0 mauling at Selhurst Park.

Arguably Maguire's worst result against Palace was a 4-0 defeat that sealed relegation for Hull

Zaha and Benteke etched the writing on the wall for the Tigers with first-half goals, before Milivojevic added another penalty and Van Aanholt scored late on.

Maguire had some joy against Palace in that thriller in Hull in December 2016. Benteke and Zaha both scored, but the hosts' young prospect set up Adama Diomande's equaliser to make it 2-2 in a game that City would have won but for an 89th-minute Fraizer Campbell leveller. 

Little did he know that the draw would be the last point he would secure against Palace for almost four years.

There was respite from the ravages when United won 2-0 in south London in July – a result that Maguire must have hoped would signal an end to his wretched record against Palace.

The dreadful start to United's campaign, though, will not leave their skipper looking forward to the trip to Selhurst Park in March.
