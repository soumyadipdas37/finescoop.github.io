Penelope Cruz recently shared that she took up smoking after playing nicotine-addicted characters.

The 46-year-old veteran actress found herself hooked on cigarettes after her characters in Blow (2001) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) indulged in the habit on camera. 

After smoking for a 'few years', Penelope decided to quit to focus on achieving optimal health in order to have children, she told Stella magazine.

Ditch the habit: Penelope Cruz revealed she smoked for a few years after playing film characters that had a nicotine addiction. Cruz shared that she was inspired to quit when she and husband Javier Bardem, 51, decided to have kids; seen in January

The Spanish born beauty shares children Leo, nine, and Luna, seven, with actor husband of 10 years, Javier Bardem, 51. 

The two first met on set in 1992, but sparks did not fly until they starred opposite each other in Vicky Cristina Barcelona in 2008. 

Speaking to Stella magazine, Cruz shared that she led a pretty healthy life despite her shortcomings. 

'I don't drink, I don't smoke and I eat really healthily... I've always taken good care of myself and maintained a healthy lifestyle,' she shared.  

Blow: Penelope starred opposite Johnny Depp in film Blow where he played a drug dealer and she played his wife Mirtha Jung; 2001

Vicky Cristina Barcelona: Penelope won the Oscar for best supporting actress in Woody Allen's movie; 2008

Manolete: In 2008, the same year she won her Oscar, Cruz smoked during her role in Manolete with Adrien Brody

The actress continued to say that she has never been a drinker either, before sharing a bit about her previous tobacco vice.  

'I've never drunk alcohol, but I smoked for a few years because one of my characters did; I quit when I decided I was going to be a mother,' she shared. 

Penelope picked up the habit after smoking in at least three of her acting roles over the years. She reportedly used to smoke anywhere from seven to eight cigarettes in a day. 

She first smoked opposite Johnny Depp in the crime biopic Blow where she played wife to cocaine smuggler George Jung. 

Years later in 2008, Cruz smoked when she acted in Woody Allen's film Vicky Cristina Barcelona where she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  

Versace: Years later, Cruz played the role of Donatella Versace in Ryan Murphy's The Assassination of Gianni Versace; 2018

After quitting the habit, Penelope was seen holding a cigarette as she played the role of Donatella Versace in Ryan Murphy's show, The Assassination of Gianni Versace in 2018. But it is likely she did not inhale.

The stunning actress also opened up about her daily routine when it comes to maintaining a healthy life, insisting she always tries to get a good night's sleep, and finds meditation a great way to relax and refocus. 

'I try to get eight hours of sleep if I can, and I've started meditating again recently, which really helps me to appreciate the present moment,' said the ex of Tom Cruise.

Cruz continued, 'Just like the gym works the body, meditation allows you to calm the mind. Practicing it daily improves my ability to relax,' the working mother shared. 

She also credits feeling calm with immensely helping her skin.

Speaking to Women's Health in May of this year, Cruz shared her tips for looking ageless.  

She said she noticed a huge difference in her skin after cutting smoking and drinking out of her life and also said that she drinks 'gallons of water' which she was not doing in the past. 

The Vanilla Sky actress got her first dose of the beauty world growing up as her family owned a hair salon back in Spain.  

'I learned to do a bit of everything: cutting, curling and straightening hair, waxing, colouring, putting in rollers,' she shared. 

With regards to upcoming projects, Cruz and Antonio Banderas have resumed filming their international movie, Official Competition, in Madrid. 

The movie started filming in March, but was shut down eight days later due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
