People have only been able to digest milk products as adults for the past few thousand years - and it was the result of a 'lactose tolerance' genetic mutation.

Experts from the Johannes Gutenberg University, studied the remains of Bronze Age warriors that were slain in 1200 BC on a river bank in what is now Germany. 

A DNA analysis showed only one in eight had a gene that breaks down lactose - a type of sugar in milk. The mutation makes a special enzyme called lactase.

About 90 per cent of the population living in that same area have the ability to process lactose - suggesting the mutation spread in just a few thousand years. 

Lead author Professor Joachim Burger said this was a huge difference when there can't have been more than 120 generations of humans between then and today.

The study, published in Current Biology, found that aside from lactase tolerance and a few other genetic variants, the genomes of the Bronze Age warriors were similar to those of today's inhabitants of northern Germany and the Baltic Sea region.  

Professor Daniel Wegmann, of the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, said the only way to explain this difference to today is 'very strong natural selection'.

'We conclude that over the past 3,000 years, lactase-persistent individuals had more children or, alternatively, those children had better chances of survival than those without this trait.' 

'In each generation lactase-persistent individuals have a 6 per cent greater chance of surviving to reproductive age than non-lactase-persistent individuals,' he added.

But researchers say there is still no answer to why being able to digest the sugar in milk after infancy provided such a big evolutionary advantage.

Many people are still intolerant to milk. the team said. Without lactase, milk causes unpleasant and anti social side effects including flatulence and cramping. 

The study also analysed the genetic material in Bronze Age bones found in eastern and south-eastern Europe for comparison. 

Scientists found these also showed low frequencies of lactase persistence.

The warrior remains from the Tollense Valley are from what researchers say was likely the oldest known battle in Europe.

Remains were first discovered there in the 1990s, and for more than 10 years archaeologists have been systematically searching the river for more.

The bones of more than 100 individuals have been discovered, many of them exhibiting signs of violent combat.

Many contain arrowheads, while some skulls had been crushed by blunt objects.  

Several thousand men are estimated to have been involved, some of whom were on horseback, according to Wegmann. 

Milk is a weird thing to consume. It is a liquid made by a cow or other animal to feed its young - we squirt it from the cow's udders to obtain it.

According to the German research team - this gave those able to digest it during hte Bronze Age and beyond 'a remarkable selective advantage'.

When we are babies, lactase allows us to digest the lactose in our mother's milk. But after infancy, production used to stop. 

 Burger said each generation's lactase-persistent individuals have a six per cent greater chance of surviving to reproductive age than those without persistence.  

In 2007, the same team established almost none of the first sedentary farmers in Europe were lactase-persistent.

 'It is astonishing at the time of the battle at the Tollense, more than 4,000 years after the introduction of agriculture in Europe, lactase persistence in adults was so rare.'

 'With milk being a high energy, relatively uncontaminated drink, its ingestion may have provided greater chances of survival during food shortages or when supplies of drinking water were contaminated,' he added.

'Particularly during early childhood, in the years shortly after weaning, this factor often may have been decisive amongst prehistoric populations.'

Today, drinking milk is common practice in northern Europe, the US and a patchwork of other places but in many cultures it is strictly off limits. 

In 2000, China launched a nationwide campaign to encourage the consumption of milk and dairy products for health reasons.

It had to overcome the deep suspicions of older generations. Cheese, which is essentially milk that has been allowed to go off, can still make many Chinese people feel sick.

In northern Europe, more than 90 per cent of people are lactase persistent. But many Africans do not have the trait and it is also uncommon in Asia and South America.

The findings have been published in the journal Current Biology. 



A dairy allergy is when the body's immune system reacts unusually to dairy.



Reactions to dairy, like other triggers, are usually mild, causing red rashes, itches, swelling and even vomiting.



However, they can prove deadly and lead to anaphylactic shock - which can kill in minutes.



It leads to a catastrophic drop in blood pressure and can trigger a cardiac arrest - when the heart suddenly stops working.



About 20 people in the UK die as a result of anaphylactic shock each year, according to figures.



Experts are unsure how many people have a dairy allergies, but claim they are one of the most common types of allergies.



The NHS advises patients with a dairy allergy, or allergies to other potential triggers such as peanuts, to avoid the food completely.



Dairy allergy is different to lactose intolerance, which is a common digestive problem to lactose - often found in milk.
