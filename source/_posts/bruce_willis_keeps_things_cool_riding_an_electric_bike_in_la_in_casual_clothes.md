This year marks the 25th anniversary of Willis' hit film 12 Monkeys, which cast him as a time traveler named James Cole looking to quell the spread of a killer virus that has mankind living underground in 2035.  

It also starred Madeleine Stowe, Christopher Meloni and Brad Pitt, who received his first Oscar nomination in 1996 (Best Actor in a Supporting Role) for his portrayal of Jeffrey Goines in the movie. (The actor won this first Oscar this year in the same category for his role in last year's Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood).

The motion picture, which hit theaters December 27, 1995, was an international hit taking in more than $168 million, according to Box Office Mojo. 

The sci-fi film has renewed relevance, receiving extra attention this year with its topic matter amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (along with other films such as 1995's Outbreak and 2011's Contagion).

The film's director Terry Gilliam opened up on how he prepared the leading man for the role to PeopleTV last year. 

He said he told Willis, 'I don’t want Bruce Willis the movie star, I want Bruce Willis the actor,' adding that he wanted Willis to come on set without his entourage, which he dubbed 'naked.'

He added of the star, 'He did have his security guy, he did have his dietician. He had the truck with all the exercise equipment, and all that, but in Bruce Willis terms, that was coming naked, basically.'

Willis is father to daughters Mabel, eight, and Evelyn, six - with wife Emma Heming, 42; and to adult children Rumer, 32, Scout, 29, and Tallulah, 26, with ex-wife Demi Moore, 57.
