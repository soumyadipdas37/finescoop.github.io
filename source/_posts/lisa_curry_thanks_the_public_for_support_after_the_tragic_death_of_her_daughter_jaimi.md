Lisa Curry has thanked the public for their support following the death of her daughter Jaimi Kenny at the age of 33 on Monday.

The three-time Olympic swimmer, 58, shared a previously unseen photo to Instagram of herself holding hands with Jaimi, alongside a powerful message for all parents who have lost a child.

'Thank you so much for the outpouring of love and strength we are receiving. There are so many messages from so many people and it's difficult to get back to all of you but in time we'll try,' she wrote.

'Sadly, I know that we are not the only parents who have lost a child... so to all the parents who have lost a child, and to those who will, today, tomorrow... somehow I guess we get through it. The grief is immense and we are allowing it to take its course,' she added.

Lisa reminded her fans to hold their loved ones close before it's too late.

Jaimi died on Monday morning, after secretly battling an eating disorder for years.

The Kenny-Curry family confirmed her death that afternoon when they released a statement from her father, former Ironman Grant Kenny.

'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read the statement.

'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued.

'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child. 

'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us as the extra time we were able to spend with her.

'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for family and friends and we trust we will all be allowed to grieve in privacy.'

Jaimi had just turned 33 in June, with her mother taking to social media at the time to wish her a happy birthday. 

'Our first born. Really... where have all those years gone! Have a lovely day bubba. We all love you so much,' Lisa wrote.

Lisa and Grant, long considered sporting royalty in Australia, separated in 2009 after 23 years of marriage and finalised their divorce in 2017.

In May 2018, the competitive swimmer married entertainer Mark Tabone at their Sunshine Coast hinterland property.

In 2013, Grant welcomed a daughter named Trixie Belle with radio presenter Fifi Box, with whom he'd had a brief relationship the previous year.

Fifi did not acknowledge Grant was the father of her daughter until 2016.
