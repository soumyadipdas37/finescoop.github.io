They have defiantly denied claims they are back together following a series of cosy sightings.

But Married At First Sight stars Stacey Hampton and Michael Goonan joined forces yet again as they hung out with a few friends at the Burleigh Pavilion in Queensland on Wednesday.

In an Instagram snap shared by Michael, the 28-year-old looked like he was having a fabulous time as he got cosy with his 26-year-old ex.Â

'Soo good to have caught up with everyone in this pic - been far too long - what a weekend #team,' Michael captioned the image.

Given the circumstances of their break-up on Married At First Sight, Michael and Stacey's friendship has caught many fans by surprise.

The duo had ended things on bad terms at the cast reunion, which was filmed in January, when Stacey was accused of sleeping with another groom, Mikey Pembroke, which she strenuously denied.

Even before these allegations surfaced, the TV newlyweds had faced a string of setbacks - including Michael's boozy kiss with co-star Hayley Vernon (which he denied) and their bitter argument over Michael's drinking on their honeymoon.

The pair's closeness has sparked rumours they are dating again, but Stacey has insisted this isn't the case.

'No, we're just friends and we're civil,' the blonde bombshell told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Monday.

She added that she was Michael's 'wingwoman' during their trip to the Gold Coast.

'He had a fun time. He was hooking up with multiple girls,' she said, before clarifying that she wasn't one of them.

Michael also told the radio show: 'We're just good friends. She's not that stupid [to get back with me].'
