Kaia Gerber has been busy getting close to new flame Jacob Elordi, appearing almost inseparable from the Euphoria hunk since relationship rumors began flying around late last month.

But the second generation stunner, 19, seemed to be back to work when she shared a new Instagram selfie Wednesday.

Kaia wowed while letting a fluffy robe hang off her shoulders as she appeared in full hair and makeup but sans wardrobe.

Ooh la la: Kaia Gerber looked sultry while sharing a behind-the-scenes selfie from a recent photoshoot online Wednesday

The model daughter of Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber teased her decolletage in the bathroom selfie.

Though she was still getting dressed, Kaia seemed to be halfway ready for the camera. 

Her her pink tinted tresses were carefully pinned down so as to stay sleek as possible between styling and shooting.

The teen model - who also leads her own book club - also showed off a sultry bronze eyeshadow look and flushed cheeks, making it clear she already had time in the makeup chair.

She finished things off on a cheeky note, adding just a fairy emoji as the caption.

From the snap, it seems like Kaia was blending work and pleasure during her recent trip to Los Cabos, Mexico with Jacob and her parents.

But that didn't stop the Kissing Booth star Jacob from reaching out to his rumored ex Zendaya after her Emmy win this weekend. 

The 24-year-old actress (real name: Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman) became the youngest to win the Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series award for her portrayal of Rue in HBO's Euphoria. 

She was also just the second Black woman to win in that category, following Viola Davis' win for playing Annalise Keating in How To Get Away With Murder, with Elordi, 23, taking to his Instagram story to honor her.

Elordi shared a photo of Zendaya with the caption 'Congratulations captain @zendaya' with a black heart emoji, followed by 'Bravo' and a purple heart emoji.

Kaia and Jacob were first seen out to dinner together earlier this month at the upscale seaside sushi spot Nobu Malibu. 

A source told E! News at the time that their relationship was mostly platonic: 'Jacob definitely has interest in dating Kaia, but there is nothing serious going on there.

'They have many mutual friends and have hung out many times in the past. They both have very chill personalities and similar interests. Jacob makes Kaia laugh and her family adores him.'

The insider added: 'Kaia is keeping things friendly for now but there is flirtation between the two. She has told friends she is single and is only having fun and hanging out with people.'

But another source said that things had progressed beyond being just friends, later telling E! News: 'They've been inseparable for the last several weeks. They've been going out to dinner at night and working out together at the gym during the day.'
