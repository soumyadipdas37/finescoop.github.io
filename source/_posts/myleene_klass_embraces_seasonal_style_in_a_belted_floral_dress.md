Warm weather welcomed a seasonal look on Tuesday as Myleene Klass ventured out in a vibrant floral summer dress. 

The presenter, 42, caught the eye while taking advantage of persistently mild temperatures during her daily walk to London's Global Radio Studios. 

With a distinctive floral pattern, the below-the-knee dress ensured Myleene commanded attention as she made her way across the city's Leicester Square.

A belted waist drew attention to the Smooth Radio presenter's slim physique, while brown suede boots gave the overall look a tasteful flourish.

Rounding off her look with a smart Panama hat, Myleene greeted onlookers with a nod before making her way inside the studio. 

Myleene's latest appearance came after her recent social media run-in with a troll who claimed her boyfriend Simon Motson will cheat on her.

The presenter recently posted a gallery of images with the PR executive, 45, to celebrate their five year anniversary as a couple. 

However a troll wrote underneath: 'Not long before this one cheats on you. Dear oh dear, heading for the lawyers are we?'

In a pointed response, she fired back: 'He wishes! Cheating exes usually get a house, a car and a fat pay-off, in what appeared to be a dig at her ex-husband Graham Quinn, who left her on her 34th birthday in 2012.

The incident came just six months after the couple's wedding, but they had been together for 11 years after meeting when Graham became the bodyguard for defunct pop group Hear'Say.

Myleene, who shares daughters, Ava, 13, and Hero, nine with Graham, was devastated to learn that he had secretly bought a bachelor pad for himself – meaning that he must have been planning his departure for some time. 

The presenter is now in a happy relationship with Simon, who she began dating in 2015 after being introduced by two mutual friends, and the pair welcomed their first child together, son Apollo, in August last year.
