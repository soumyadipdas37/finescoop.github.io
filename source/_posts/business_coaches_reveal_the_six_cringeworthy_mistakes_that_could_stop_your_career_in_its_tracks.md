Exaggerating relationships with people you hardly know is one of the most career-damaging mistakes you can make at work, top business coaches have warned.

With one in 10 Australians now unemployed and competition for vacancies growing stiffer by the week, climbing the corporate ladder through strategic networking has never been more important for those lucky enough to have kept their jobs.

Before the coronavirus pandemic, Australia's unemployment level in February stood at 5.1 per cent but in July rose to a 22-year high of 7.5 per cent - that's more than one million officially out of work for the first time ever.

To help workers towards promotion, executives from the country's leading recruitment agencies shared tips in a blog post for Seek, advising Australians of six networking faux pas likely to jeopardise credibility and stop career growth in its tracks.

1. Exaggerating relationships 

Overstating professional relationships with people you barely - or don't - know is the fastest way to tarnish your reputation at work, Brisbane management consultant Jonathan Hall warns.

Mr Hall says exaggeration is perceived as 'inauthentic', especially if the only connection is an accepted friend request on Facebook or LinkedIn.

He advises only name dropping someone you know 'really well', ideally on both professional and personal levels.

2. Ignoring opportunities

Passing up an opportunity after a colleague or client has recommended you for it is a cardinal sin in the corporate world, according to Nicole Grainger-Marsh, an accredited executive coach at Sydney recruitment agency Precision Sourcing.

'I've been on the receiving end of people not following up on introductions I've made, and each time it leaves me feeling as if I wasted my contact's time,' she said.

Those who ignore her introductions never receive a second chance from Ms Grainger-Marsh, who argues that failure to follow through can be a 'career-limiting move'.

The correct approach is to follow up, then thank the facilitator for their referral by treating them to lunch or coffee, says executive consultant Jonathan Hall.

3. Taking, never giving 

Only contacting people when you need a favour is a sure-fire way to lose credibility quickly, Mr Hall warns, and won't be tolerated in professional circles.

'Maintaining your network is just as crucial as building it,' he said.

Ms Grainger-Marsh agrees, noting those who create the most lucrative, stable networks have given of themselves extensively in return.

To ingratiate yourself with people from every tier of your industry, she recommends providing referrals and sending articles or studies that might be of interest.

4. Choosing quantity over quality

Networks are only useful if they're nurtured, Ms Grainger-Marsh advises - and it's impossible to do that if you have a diary full of business cards belonging to people whose faces you can't remember.

She argues that quantity always trumps quality when it comes to connections in the corporate world.

Ms Grainger-Marsh advises categorising contacts into groups, like former colleagues, employers, industry peers and mentors.

Then you can determine which you should prioritise, depending on the benefits you hope to glean from each one.

- Do not include a photo or date of birth.

- Keep it short. It should only be one page in length, or a maximum of two if you are in a senior position.

- To impress 'D' personalities (typically MDs and CEOs), and 'Cs', such as CFOs, use clear headings and bulleted sections, written in a simple, consistent font such as Arial or Times New Roman, size 11 or 12. This makes it easy to comprehend for 'Ds', who tend to skim read, while also including the structure and consistency that 'Cs' look for.

- Keep sentences short and concise, and give proof supporting your career achievements. This appeals to 'D' and 'I' types who want facts and statistics, and 'S' and 'Cs' who are put off by excessive self-promotion.

- List your work history in chronological order.

- Impress recruiters by referring to their company's values in at least one of your career achievements.

- Ditch stock phrases like 'I'm a good team player' and 'I enjoy spending time with my family and friends' 

- Give at least one example of how you are motivated, and how you have and will motivate others.

- Mention two activities that demonstrate your personal values. This could be charity work (fundraising by running a marathon, for instance).

- Use positive language throughout that indicates a 'can-do' attitude.

5. Being unclear

Asking for help or introductions is perfectly acceptable, provided you are direct about what your request, Ms Grainger-Marsh says.

'The last thing you want to do is create work for people. The key is to make it easy for them, which will mean you get exactly what you need,' she said.

That could involve typing out a reference for someone to sign or summarising the kind of role you're scouting for in a one-page brief.

6. Pitching without building rapport

Diving head first into a sales pitch the first time you meet a prospective client or associate can do 'more harm than good', according to Mr Hall, who says it's 'essential' to build rapport first.

Building rapport involves discovering how you can help the other person, so he says it's crucial to remain open and amenable to requests.

'Trust that this will come full circle,' Mr Hall said.
