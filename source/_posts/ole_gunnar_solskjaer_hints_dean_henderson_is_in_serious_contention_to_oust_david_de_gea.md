Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has once again insisted that Dean Henderson has a serious chance of ousting David de Gea as Manchester United's first choice goalkeeper this season. 

Henderson penned a new five-year contract at Old Trafford after his successful loan stints with Sheffield United, and Sportsmail has previously reported the England international has demanded regular first-team action.

De Gea's position is under threat for the first time in 10 years at United, and Solskjaer explained how the healthy competition between the pair has reflected on the training field.

The United boss says he has been impressed by the standard on show in goalkeeping training

It is understood that De Gea, the highest paid player in the Premier League, will start against Crystal Palace on Saturday evening - but a number of high-profile errors in recent months has seen Henderson mount a strong challenge for his position.

The talented 23-year-old stopper has made it clear he will not be happy settling for a back-up role as his sights are firmly set on becoming England's No 1 choice at next summer's European Championships.

Solskjaer told MUTV: 'Dean Henderson has come in and he’s making this goalkeeper department a joy to watch. The level in training has been unbelievable.'

United pieced together a stellar run of form in the second half of the last campaign and secured a third-placed finish, guaranteeing them a much-needed return to the Champions League.

But after his team were dogged by too many poor results against lesser sides, Solskjaer has admitted United must improve in order to match the pace set by arch-rivals Liverpool and Manchester City.

'You need to be consistent to be challenging at the top,' he added. 'We need to close the gap and get closer to the top of the league. Of course we know that. 

'That comes with consistency and also with [the] experience that these boys have had. And the couple of new players we have in the squad will help.'

New signing Donny van de Beek has been named as a player to watch by Solskajer this season

His ranks have been strengthened by the arrival of midfielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax in a £40million deal, and the 23-year-old has been named alongside a surprise face as players to watch this year by Solskjaer.    

He said: 'We’ve spoken about Donny van de Beek, the level he’s showing and quality he’s showing. 

'And don’t forget Eric Bailly, because he missed up until February and missed more than half of the season. He came back stronger and stronger and towards the end of the season he looked really strong, so I think we’ll see a lot of Eric. He’s looked really strong in training as well.'
