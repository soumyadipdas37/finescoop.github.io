Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her boyfriend Riley Roberts have been spotted out and about in the trendy Meatpacking district of New York City, dining at a popular pizzeria before strolling the High Line.

The 30-year-old Bronx-based Congresswoman was sleek in black jeans, a black $450 Maje bomber jacket and black Spiderman face mask, $113 Birkenstock sandals and red leather Tefla tote, which retails for $257.

Her boyfriend of four years, a web designer, was coordinating with his girlfriend in a striking red jacket, with a matching red face mask, with trendy Allbirds, popular among tech execs, which retail for $95.

The two are famously low-key, with few even knowing she was in a relationship when she was elected in 2018.

Roberts, originally from Arizona, was present at her swearing-in ceremony in January 2019, and has made occasional, infrequent appearances on her social media. 

They live in the Bronx with their French Bulldog, Deco. 

Roberts is head of marketing at HomeBinder.com, which helps people manage the maintenance on their homes. 

He also works as a consultant to help tech startups grow revenue using marketing and development.  

On Thursday the duo made the most of a committee work day - a day when there were no votes scheduled in the House - to make the most of their hometown.

They were spotted running errands in CVS and makeup store Sephora before sitting outdoors at Italian eatery Serafina - famed for its pizzas, and popular with tourists and celebrities alike. 

Pizzas at the see-and-be-seen restaurant range from $16 for a simple margarita, to $29 for a black truffle pizza. 

The pair then strolled along the High Line - one of New York's most popular tourist sites.

Roberts, who like AOC was wearing a facemask for the majority of the time, took advantage of the hand sanitizer

The landscaped walkway, filled with sculptures and flanked by murals, is currently open from noon until 8pm, with a free timed-entry reservation system.

The site is operating on a reduced operating schedule, with fewer amenities, and limited capacity in order to allow for social distancing.  

AOC and Roberts then stepped up onto the High Line

The High Line was closed during the pandemic, but has recently reopened
