Lottie was recently linked to Roman Kemp amid claims she had been on a 'tipsy' date with I'm A Celebrity star and Capital FM host.

News of their alleged fling came just three weeks after the broadcaster split from his girlfriend of three years Anne-Sophie Flury.

A mutual friend told The Sun on Sunday: 'They have known each other through the party circuit for a few years, but nothing has ever happened before.

'Roman's always thought she was beautiful, and decided to pluck up the courage to ask her out.'   

MailOnline contacted representatives for Lottie and Roman for comment at the time of publication.
