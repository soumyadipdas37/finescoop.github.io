Australian Nutella lovers have been whipped into a frenzy by the news they can now buy hazelnut-flavoured biscuits made by the famous chocolate brand.

The confectionery giant launched the Nutella-flavoured biscuits last year and Australians have mostly had to look overseas so far to get their hands on the in-demand product.

But a popular Sydney convenience store has revealed it has now taken delivery of the biscuits - as well as another addition to the brand's product range in the Nutella B-ready chocolate bar.

The B-ready bar features a crunchy wafer shell with Nutella inside, while the biscuits are made from a shortbread outer layer encasing the hazelnut spread filling. 

Redfern Convenience Store in Sydney's inner-city has announced it has taken delivery of Nutella's in-demand new range of biscuits - as well as the popular B-ready bar

Redfern Convenience Store in Sydney's inner-city shared a photo on Instagram showing a spread of the two Nutella products to its 24,000 followers last week.

'I'm sure I'll spend at least $100 going here - so many options,' one fan of the nutty snack wrote. 

The new Nutella biscuit range has proven to be a hit success for parent company Ferrero since launching earlier this year.

Ferrero has expanded the product's distribution internationally following its initial launch in France, but it is not yet known if or when the company are bringing the biscuits to Australia.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ferrero Australia for further information. 

The chocolate manufacturer said sales of the new product in France are three times higher than its next nearest rival in the market.

Nutella's iconic chocolate spread was invented 55 years ago and the brand's products are sold around the world in 160 different countries. 

Last year, Nutella was rocked by explosive allegations the product relies on child labour.  

The hazelnuts which make Nutella, Ferrero Rocher, Kinder Surprise and Bueno chocolate are picked by immigrants and children in Turkey.

The European country is home to more than 400,000 family-owned hazelnut orchards where children as young as 10 work up to 10 hours a day for 95 lira (AUD$25) a day, according to a BBC News report.

In a statement obtained by Daily Mail Australia, the popular chocolate company said it was against child labour.

'Being a larger hazelnut user, Ferrero is committed to contributing to influencing and driving sustainable changes in the hazelnut production sector,' the statement read.

'This includes combating child labour with a multi-stakeholder approach that involves a combination of different measures, as in our Ferrero Farming Values Program (FFV).

'In fact, the complexity of the hazelnut supply chain means it cannot be transformed by one single actor, and cooperation is absolutely essential to tackling the issue of child labour.'
