Wild scenes have broken out in Brisbane after Black Lives Matter protesters converged outside of Queensland Police's headquarters after the death of an indigenous woman in custody.

Around 150 Black Lives Matter protesters gathered outside the headquarters in Brisbane on Friday, leading to several arrested as they clashed with police.

The group are protesting following the death of a 49-year-old woman in custody on Thursday, surrounding a busy CBD road and refusing to budge.

Protesters covered their hands in red paint and marked up the sign outside of the building to signify 'blood on the hands' of the institution, screaming 'f*** the police'.

Brendan Beavon, a lawyer who was passing by on his way to work, told Daily Mail Australia there were protesters sitting on the road.

'They were sitting on the roadway and shouting "murderers, murderers" and "blood on your hands",' he said.  

Protesters also shouted: 'How do you spell racist? QPS!'

Officers could be seen pushing protesters away from a police car attempting to make its way down the road.

A female protester said how she marched the same streets in 1994 for the same issues - but back then is descended into violence.

She said she hoped people would remain peaceful during today's statement, with the gathering crowd kneeling down in response. 

Brisbane City Greens Councilor Jonathan Sri was among the protesters, as well as prominent climate activists Emma Dorge and Alice Wicks.  

A 49-year-old woman was found dead in her watchhouse cell on Thursday.

She had been arrested on drug and property matters on September 6, and she was remanded in prison until October 7.

She was in the watchhouse waiting to be transferred to a correctional facility. 

'While the circumstances of the death are to be determined, the investigation will include consideration of any underlying health conditions,' Queensland Police Service said in a statement. 

The investigation into the woman's death continues. 

Mr Sri said the protest had started peacefully, and blamed the police for inflaming tensions.  

'An Aboriginal woman died in police custody and police haven’t explained why or how,' he told news.com.au.

'They haven’t released footage from the cell.

'Residents were protesting peacefully, spaced out safely, and without warning or negotiation police randomly arrested people, turning a safe situation into a tense one.'
