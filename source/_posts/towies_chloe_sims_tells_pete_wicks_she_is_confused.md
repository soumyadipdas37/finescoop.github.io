They appeared to be taking steps to fix their damaged friendship during last week's episodes of The Only Way Is Essex after months of not speaking.

Yet tensions are still awry between Chloe Sims and her best friend Pete Wicks during the upcoming episode of the show, as they hash out their differences over drinks.

Chloe, 37, reveals she feels 'confused' because Pete, 31, failed to contact her and reach out after they met up for a night out to try and begin fixing their relationship.

Awks! Tensions are still awry between Chloe Sims and her best friend Pete Wicks during the upcoming episode of the show, as they hash out their differences over drinks

It is unclear why the pair fell out in the first place, however Chloe previously explained that she felt Pete would 'dismiss' some of her emotions and opinions.

While meeting for a drinking Pete says to Chloe: 'Nice to see ya.'

Without conviction, Chloe replies: 'Yeah so nice', and Pete sarcastically tells her that she 'looks happy', as they sit opposite one another in a bar. 

Chloe says: 'I'm happy', and Pete quips back: 'Try and tell your face you're having a good time. No? Not quite there yet.'

Confused: Chloe, 37, reveals she feels confused as Pete, 31, failed to contact her and reach out after they met up for a night out to try and begin fixing their relationship

Revealing how she feels, Chloe says: 'I don't know what you want from me. One minute you're in the forest with Peggy with tears in your eyes saying how much you miss me and all this s**t.

'Then we have a really fun time and everything felt normal and you said yourself it felt like we hadn't been apart, and then nothing.'

Pete says: 'Well I don't know what you want me to say about it.'

What's going on? Chloe, 37, reveals she feels 'confused' because Pete, 31, failed to contact her and reach out after they met up for a night out to try and begin fixing their relationship

Explaining how it affects her, she adds: 'I find it really confusing, one of the main reasons I stopped talking to you before was because I couldn't work you out.'

While Pete simply says: 'Ok.'

Clearly frustrated, Chloe says: 'That's what you do, you say okay and I'm still none the wiser in no man's land. It's annoying and I'm sick of it.' 

Tricky: It is unclear why the pair fell out in the first place, however Chloe previously explained that she felt Pete would 'dismiss' some of her emotions and opinions

Pete and Chloe previously appeared to be fixing their broken relationship after bumping into each other in the park and admitting they had missed each other's friendship.  

They later decided to meet up for a drink where they said it felt good to be getting back to a place of normality between them.

However Pete's apparent lack of effort could prove a stumbling block between them on the road to recovery.
