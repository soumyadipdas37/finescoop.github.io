The courageous father who was wounded while protecting his three young children when shots were fired at a New York City car dealership has lost both his jobs due to his injuries.    

Earlier this week, Anthony Jefferson was praised as a hero for taking a bullet in his thigh while protecting his children from gunfire that erupted at On The Road Automotive in the Bronx. 

He was at the dealership that evening shopping for a vehicle to surprise his wife, Danica Jefferson, for her birthday. 

Anthony's already been discharged from a local hospital, but he's lost his two jobs in the process and his children are still in shock.

Danica told TMZ that Anthony cannot walk at the moment because of his sustained injuries from the shooting.

Subsequently, he's been fired from his jobs as head painter for a maintenance company and as a construction worker in the city.

And although he's begun recovery, Danica said Anthony will need to undergo surgery soon because the bullet is still lodged inside his leg. 

Danica added that their children, aged six, five, and two, have become distressed over the ordeal.

She told TMZ that the small children are hesitant to go outside the home, cry in their sleep and the two-year-old has asked: 'Why did the man shoot my daddy?'

The couple hope to have their children meet with a  therapist soon.

A photo shared to a GoFundMe showed where a bullet struck one of Anthony's shoes on Monday

A GoFundMe was set up by a family friend. The money will go towards the family's medical bills and to enroll the children in therapy.

'Due to his injury, Anthony lost his job and has to have surgery to remove the bullet. This Go Fund me is to help this heroic dad with his medical bills and his kids with therapy. They are beyond traumatized,' an accompanying message read.

The fund has raised nearly $8,400 of its $24,100 goal so far.  

Terrifying video captured the entire incident that took place at around 7.20pm on Monday in the Eastchester neighborhood. 

Video obtained by DailyMail.com showed the 39-year-old dad and his children sitting on a couch inside the used car shop when a man in a black hoodie ran up and began firing through an open glass door. 

The dad immediately scooped up his kids and dove to the floor, attempting to block them from a barrage of bullets with his body.  

Seconds later a door shattered, sending a shards of glass flying around the showroom as the family crawled to safety. 

Anthony was struck in the thigh by one of the bullets, police sources told DailyMail.com. 

He was transported to Jacobi Medical Center and is said to be in stable condition. 

Several other customers were seen milling around the dealership when the gunshots rang out, sending them running for cover.  

Police said they're searching for two suspects, one of whom carjacked a vehicle immediately after the shooting.

The car, a four-door green sedan, was stopped at a red light just outside when the perpetrator approached, opened the door and pointed a gun at the 49-year-old driver, ordering him to get out.   

Investigators believe the shooting is gang-related. 

Sources told the New York Daily News that a gang member was doing business in the dealership when their rival opened fire.  

The sources said investigators have not determined whether the father-of-three was targeted.
