He took a moment to thank his fan base as his very public legal war against ex-wife Amber Heard continued last week.

And amid the ongoing drama with his ex, Johnny Depp was seen arriving at the Maria Cristina Hotel during 68th San Sebastian International Film Festival on Saturday.

The actor, 57, opted for a typically quirky look as he arrived wearing a Ramones T-shirt and a baker boy style cap with aviator shades.

The Edward Scissorhands star layered his look with a suede jacket and teamed it with a pair of distressed blue jeans and black boots.

He also accessorised with a selection of scarves for the occasion, one of which he used to cover his face in accordance with coronavirus guidelines. 

The film festival will run from 18 to 26 September 2020 under safety measures like obligatory face mask use and red carpets without public due to the pandemic. 

Organizers have also reduced the number of film screenings as well as the seating capacity in cinemas.

On Friday Johnny took to his Instagram with a nostalgic-feeling video showing him seated at a desk, penning a letter of gratitude.

The text was copied into the caption of the post, which read: 'Hello All! I just wanted to thank you all once again for your constant and loyal support throughout many long and interesting episodes of my life...

'I am only here because of you — and I'm only here for you!!!' the caption continued.

The post comes as Depp received word Friday from a Virginia court that there will indeed be a delay in the defamation trial he is bringing against Heard in the American courts... but not for the reason he had intended.

As reported by Deadline, Circuit Court Chief Judge Bruce White has delayed the trial from January 11, 2021 to to May 3, 2021 – due to continued concerns over coronavirus.

Depp had initially filed a motion on August 21 to have the upcoming $50M defamation trial delayed so he could begin filming Fantastic Beasts 3 in London.

The Cry Baby actor filed court documents in a Fairfax County, Virginia court requesting the trial be delayed until anywhere between March and June of 2021, once filming was completed.

His ex Amber, 34, in turn filed a motion opposing the request. 

The court had initially set the trial to run from January 11, 2021 to January 28, 2021, though Warner Bros. recently revealed they plan to start filming Fantastic Beasts 3 in October in London, which will run through the end of February.
