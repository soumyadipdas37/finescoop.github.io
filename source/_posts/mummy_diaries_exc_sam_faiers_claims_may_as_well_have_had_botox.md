She has frequently denied undergoing any cosmetic treatments. 

And Sam Faiers was once again remaining defiant on Wednesday night's episode of The Mummy Diaries as she spoke to pal Luisa Zissman about botox.

The former TOWIE star, 29, enjoyed a day out of horse-riding with the former Apprentice contestant, 33, during which talk turned to cosmetics. 

No! Sam Faiers was once again remaining defiant on Wednesday night's episode of The Mummy Diaries as she spoke to pal Luisa Zissman about botox

Sam and her sister Billie have often been subject to conversation about their appearances during their decade in the spotlight yet remain defiant. 

While looking at herself in a compact mirror, Luisa admitted she could not wait for her next fix before saying to Sam: 'You've never had it have you?'

As Sam began inspecting her face and confirmed that while she has never had the treatement, she 'may as well have', as it is so widely speculated.

The pals then began discussing other places to have the treatment and Sam asks Luisa about having botox in her intimate areas - which Luisa soon corrected.

Defiant: The reality star insisted that she didn't want it done, instead choosing facials to refresh her skin, with Sam adding: 'We've never had Botox, we've always looked after our skin' (Sam pictured, left in 2012, right last year)

She uttered: 'No in your bladder!', in what is intended to stop frequent urination. 

Sam and Luisa then went on a horseride, where Luisa revealed her memory was suffering due to being hit by a horse while Sam claimed her memory was bad because she is a Capricorn.  

The Faiers sisters have always been defiant about their changing looks, with Sam insisting on an episode of The Mummy Diaries last year that they had never had Botox despite their 'faces changing' since starring on TOWIE.

In the scenes, the two reality stars went to have a lavish facial as part of Billie's wedding preparations ahead of her Maldives nuptials to Greg Shepherd.

However, chat soon turned to Botox when Billie revealed that her make-up artist had claimed some models have the treatment to lift their eyebrows.

While later on, she continued: 'I feel like when you're a celebrity, people assume you have work done.'

Sam went on to reveal that people speculate she's had her 'eyes done' and 'filler', but she insisted: 'I honestly have never ever had Botox.'

Referencing her TOWIE days, she added: 'I first went on TV ten years ago... your face changes from being 18 to 28. No one looks the same!'
