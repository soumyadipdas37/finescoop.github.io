Mira Sorvino is echoing the calls of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion fans everywhere and angling for a sequel.

The 52-year-old actress dished on her desire to reprise her famous role as Romy White from the 1997 comedy during a virtual video conference on Thursday.

The Oscar winner said the potential future of a Romy and Michele reboot or sequel is in the hands of the powers that be over at Disney but added that she would jump at the chance to work with Lisa Kudrow again. 

Look out Tucson! Mira Sorvino dished on her desire for a Romy and Michele's High School Reunion sequel while being honored for The Creative Coalition's sixth annual Television Humanitarian Awards

In the segment, Mira was being honored by actress Melora Walters at The Creative Coalition's sixth annual Television Humanitarian Awards. 

Towards the end of the video segment, Mira was asked by Variety's Mark Malkin about whether a Romy and Michele sequel is in the pipeline. 

'It's not in my hands. It's up to Disney,' the award-winner said. 'I would be so grateful if they would decide to do it.'

Her co-star Lisa Kudrow, who played Romy's best friend Michele Weinberger, is also up to revive the beloved classic.

'It's not in my hands. It's up to Disney,' the award-winner said. 'I would be so grateful if they would decide to do it.'

'I know that Lisa and that [screenwriter] Robin Schiff is interested in it. Maybe Alan [Cumming] is interested in it. I heard that maybe Janeane [Garofalo] is interested in it.'

She added: 'I love Lisa and I would do anything just to work with her again in any capacity.'

Speaking from her home, Mira was being honored with the 2020 Television Humanitarian Award for her tireless work to stop and bring awareness to human trafficking.

Previous years the honor has gone to stars such as Debra Messing, Chrissy Metz, Keegan-Michael Key, Anthony Anderson, Jill Soloway, Patricia Heaton and even Mira's Romy and Michele co-star Alan Cumming.

Romy and Michele's High School Reunion centers on two high school best friends [Sorvino and Kudrow] who invent fake identities as the inventors of Post Its to impress their high school class at their 10 year reunion.

It hit theaters in 1997 and has only gained in popularity over the last 20+ years, becoming a cult classic. 

'We always talk about it and we're always open to it,' Sorvino told ET back in May. 'We'd be very happy to revisit it as a sequel or a TV series. I think it would be so much fun. We've always loved each other.'

The idea for a reboot or a sequel has been floating around for years and as recently as this spring, Sorvino told reporters that she and her co-star were on board. 

'We always talk about it and we're always open to it,' Sorvino told ET in May. 'We'd be very happy to revisit it as a sequel or a TV series. I think it would be so much fun. We've always loved each other.' 

And, in 2019 the Might Aphrodite actress made similar statements to Us Weekly. '[We] are all down for it,' she said at the time. 'It's just [up to] the powers that be.'
