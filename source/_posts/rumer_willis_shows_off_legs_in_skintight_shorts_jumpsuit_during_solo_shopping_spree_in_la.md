Two days after being seen walking arm-in-arm with actor Armie Hammer, Rumer Willis stepped out solo for a day of shopping in Los Angeles on Friday.

The actress, who's the daughter of screen legends Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, was all about showcasing her fit figure in a skin-tight, one-piece shorts ensemble.

After making a number of purchases, Rumer, 32, met up with her younger sister Scout, 29, at the nearby Brentwood Country Mart for some more shopping.

With the temperatures soaring above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, Rumer's skimpy dark outfit was a perfect match for hot weather. 

She paired the pseudo-jumpsuit with knee-high white boots that would have made a fashion diva envious in the 1960s and 70s and dark sunglasses.

The Idaho native, who also split her time in Southern California since she was a child, pulled her dark brown tresses into a tight bun and wore a brown protective mask in accordance to health and safety regulations amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

At one point in the day, Rumer was spotted walking through a parking lot, back to her car, holding several white bags in her hands and her purse over her left shoulder.

While Rumer was in shopping mode, her new beau, Armie Hammer, was out taking a casual afternoon stroll by himself decked out in green shorts, a white t-shirt and grey sneakers.  

On Wednesday, Rumer and Armie, 34, looked like the picture of couple who are already an item when they were seen snuggling up next to each other while out an about.

The two did not seem shy with their public displays of affection as they left a cafe in Los Angeles.
