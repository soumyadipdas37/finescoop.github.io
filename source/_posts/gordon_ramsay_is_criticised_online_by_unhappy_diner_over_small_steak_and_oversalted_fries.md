Gordon Ramsay has been savaged online by a diner who recently visited one of his London restaurants and was left disappointed after being served a tiny steak and over-salted chips, costing £23.

Posting on Tripadvisor, Guillaume R left one star for the British chef's York & Albany eatery in Camden earlier this week, alongside a scathing review.

Titled 'Gordon is not Heston', referring to fellow celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal, the post suggested Gordon was treating his customers as a 'joke'.

'When one masters and creates molecular cuisine the other has come up with homeopathic cuisine,' the diner wrote.

'Gordon isn't Heston but Gordon is Jesus. He multiples the steaks. Give him a regular sized one portion steak in any restaurant and this is what he comes up with.

'Five slices of meat over-salted fries. £23...,' the customer added, alongside a photograph of the meal. 

'Gordon you made a name giving advice on how to run a restaurant. Let me give you my advice. This is COVID time. Hospitality sector is in bad shape. 

'Blatantly joking at your customers won't help your business,' the diner continued, before offering two stars for the 'polite staff'.

MailOnline has contacted Gordon Ramsay's representative for comment. 

The review comes after Gordon, 53, was mocked on Twitter last week for the Full English breakfast served at his Savoy Grill restaurant.

He posted a picture of the dish to his social media account to explain that it will be available at his London restaurant from September 21.

But social media users were left gobsmacked after discovering the meal - which includes two eggs, one sausage, a few strips of bacon, one tomato and one mushroom - cost £19.

Many people questioned 'where's the rest of it?’ - with one person even sharing a snap of a large traditional Full English made up of six slices of bacon, three sausages, two fried eggs and a large hash brown. But the photograph appeared to be too much for Gordon, who unleashed his well-known 'idiot sandwich' phrase on the Twitter user (above)

Many people criticised the steep price, while others questioned 'where's the rest of it?’ - with one person even sharing a snap of a large traditional Full English made up of six slices of bacon, three sausages, two fried eggs and a large hash brown.

But the photograph appeared to be too much for Gordon, who unleashed his well-known 'idiot sandwich' phrase on the Twitter user. 

The chef replied to the snap: 'That’s called a Full English Classic Heart Attack you idiot sandwich,' using the saying which he coined in a parody of his show Hell's Kitchen in 2015.
