Tiger Lily Hutchence, the daughter of late INXS frontman Michael Hutchence, has taken to the stage for the first time in Perth.  

The 24-year-old, who released her first album in May, performed at new East Perth venue, Barbes, on Wednesday. 

Performing under the stage name Heavenly, the brunette rocker looked deep in performance mode as she played on stage.

Tiger Lily was clearly in her element as she stroked the keyboard and sang with her boyfriend Nick by her side. 

 The beauty wore a tight-fitting graphic dress which she paired with black tights. 

She let her brunette hair fall stylishly past her shoulders.

Also in the band is drummer Scarlett Stevens from the band San Cisco. 

According to a report in The West Australian, the budding singer wowed the crowd with 'half a dozen melancholic alt-folk' tracks. 

She followed that stage debut with another performance on Thursday, at Fremantle Navy Club.

The news comes after Tiger Lily released a digital album entitled Tragic Tiger's Sad Meltdown via music-sharing platform Bandcamp earlier this year. 

She also published a short blurb about the inspiration behind her album.   

'A little tape recording I made while in Walyalup/Fremantle. It's many different versions of a few songs and recordings of our big beautiful ocean!' she wrote.

'Wish I could upload as one long dream but it won't work. Part 2 is the banger!' 

In 1997, when Tiger Lily was just 16-months-old, her father, Michael Hutchence, killed himself in a Sydney hotel room.  

Her mother, Paula Yates, was found dead at her home in London less than three years later.

Tiger Lily was raised by her mother's ex-husband, Sir Bob Geldof, alongside her three older sisters, Fifi, Peaches and Pixie.

Tragically, Peaches died of a heroin overdose in 2014.

Tiger graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London last year. Her two half-sisters attended her graduation ceremony.

Tiger Lily recently sparked rumours she is secretly engaged to her musician boyfriend Nick.

The couple, who live together in Fremantle, Perth, sent the rumour mill into overdrive earlier this month after their housemate uploaded a romantic photo of them kissing.

Michael's stepmother, Susan Hutchence, added: 'So romantic ♡.'   

Speaking to Woman's Day, a 'source close to the Hutchence family' said Tiger Lily was 'excited to spend her life' with Nick, a multi-instrumentalist who fronts psychedelic rock band Pond. 

'Tiger and Nick have spoken of their commitment to each other, and in their own way, they are engaged,' they said.

'They're both free-spirited youngsters and I can see them saying vows to each other, but not being husband and wife within the bounds of the normal institution of marriage.'
