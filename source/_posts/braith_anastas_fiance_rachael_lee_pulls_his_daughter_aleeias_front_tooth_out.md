She's a proud mum to two children and a stepmum to her fiancé Braith Anasta's little girl, Aleeia.

And on Wednesday, Rachael Lee shared with fans the milestone moment she pulled out six-year-old Aleeia's front tooth, in a graphic video she shared to Instagram.

In the footage, the little girl - who is the daughter of Anasta's ex-wife Jodi Gordon - is seen with her mouth open while Rachael attempts to pull the tooth out with a tea towel.

'Does it hurt?' Rachael calmly asks the little one, before saying: 'It's going to tickle a little bit. Not a ha, ha tickle, like an ouchie tickle!'

She then began a countdown, before pulling the front tooth out in one fell swoop.

As the family began to cheer, Aleeia then ran to the camera to proudly show off her new gap.

Alongside being a stepmum to Aleeia, Rachael also shares two-year-old daughter Gigi with Braith, 38, and has an older son, Addison, nine, from a previous relationship.

Friendly exes: Braith (pictured with his fiancée) recently revealed that his ex-wife Jodi Gordon sees their daughter Aleeia, six, more often now that she has quit Neighbours and returned to Sydney 

Jodi and Braith were married in 2012 and split in 2015 after three years of marriage.

The ex-NRL star began dating personal trainer Rachael in 2016. He proposed to her in October 2019, enlisting the help of their three children to pop the question, which brought her to tears.

Meanwhile, both Rachael and his ex-wife Jodi get on famously as they co-parent Aleeia.

Jodi gushed about Rachael to Daily Mail Australia back in 2017, saying: 'She's a great woman, she's an incredible mum and she's a super person.

When asked further about personal trainer Rachael, the actress added: 'I can't think of a better woman I'd want in my daughter's life.'

Braith recently explained that Jodi's recent return to Sydney, following her four-year stint on Melbourne-based soap Neighbours, means that she spends more time with their daughter.

'I'm really big on routine and structure so that Aleeia has routine. She goes to school Monday to Friday and is here with us as a family, and then Jodi has her on the weekends,' Braith said.

Meanwhile, Jodi is currently believed to be single following her split with her lawyer boyfriend Cedric in July, after six months together.
