Edinson Cavani is reportedly being eyed as a forward option by LaLiga champions Real Madrid. 

The Uruguayan is currently a free agent after his contract at Champions League runners-up PSG expired in the summer.  

Though his potential salary would be high, at around £6.4m-a-year (€7m), having not signed a single new player so far this window manager Zinedine Zidane could pursue a move for the 33-year-old, according to Spanish outlet MARCA.

Zinedine Zidane could pursue a move for Cavani having not signed anyone yet this summer

The report details that Cavani was offered to Madrid following their goalless stalemate at Real Sociedad on Sunday and the Spanish giants are considering a move.  

Madrid are thought to be attracted by the idea that Cavani's acquisition would not involve a transfer fee too. 

Since departing PSG in the summer, Cavani's representatives have spoken to a range of clubs, including Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Roma, Benfica and Brazilian side Gremio. 

Currently, Cavani himself is training back home in Uruguay following the end of his seven-year stay in the French capital. 

Cavani is PSG's all-time top goalscorer but found minutes hard to come by last season 

While in Paris, Cavani won six Ligue 1 titles, four French Cups and five French League Cups, though could not crown his time with Europe's ultimate prize after PSG lost out to Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League final. 

But the Uruguayan was prolific for the French powerhouse, scoring a total of 200 goals in 301 games in all competitions. 

That makes him PSG's all-time highest goalscorer, 44 goals ahead of former team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
