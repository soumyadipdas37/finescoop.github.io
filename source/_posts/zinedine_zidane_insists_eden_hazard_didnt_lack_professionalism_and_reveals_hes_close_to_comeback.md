Zinedine Zidane has hit back at questions over Eden Hazard's attitude after the Real Madrid star turned up for another pre-season out of shape.

Hazard was said to be seven kilos overweight after his £150million move to the Bernabeu last summer and managed just one goal as he spent most of the season sidelined with an ankle injury.

And the forward reportedly arrived out of shape once more, which prompted questions over his professionalism from members of the Spanish media.

Further flames were added to the fire when Roberto Martinez called Hazard up for international duty in the UEFA Nations League, only for the forward to not play a single minute of the two matches against Denmark and Iceland.

Diario Sport reported that the club feel Hazard should have not reported for international duty and stayed with Real to work on his fitness.  

The club then made the interesting move of posting an image of Hazard working out with a large barbell at their Cuidad training quarters, without any apparent context.

Real were said to be growing increasingly frustrated with the forward but Zidane defended his player, despite him not being fit to feature in the opening two games of the season, and revealed he is close to making a comeback. 

'Hazard is very close. He's training with the squad, he does well,' Zidane said.

'Hazard didn't lack professionalism. He's had a big issue. The ankle has bothered him for a long time. He's the first who wants to be okay.' 

Zidane's side face Real Valladolid on Wednesday before travelling to Levante on Sunday.
