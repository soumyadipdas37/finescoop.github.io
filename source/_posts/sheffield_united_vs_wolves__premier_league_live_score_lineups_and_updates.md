Sheffield United welcome Wolverhampton Wanderers to Bramall Lane in Monday night Premier League action. 

There is no Dean Henderson in between the sticks for Chris Wilder this season after he returned to Manchester United. But the return of Aaron Ramsdale from Bournemouth means he has another on the England team conveyor belt to call on.

For Wolves, fresh off news that Nuno Espirito Santo has signed a new contract, they will be looking to improve on last season which saw them finish seventh in the league and reach the quarter-finals of the Europa League, losing out to eventual champions Sevilla.  

Sportsmail's TOBY MILES will provide live Premier League coverage of Sheffield United vs Wolves including score, lineups and updates.
