Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez will complete a sensational move to Atletico Madrid after they agreed a fee with Barcelona.

Barca announced that they had agreed a deal which would see the Catalan club receive six million euros (£5.5m).

Suarez joined Barca in 2014 and helped the club win four LaLiga titles, four Copa del Reys and the Champions League in 2015.



Atletico confirmed via their official website that Suarez will join them subject to him passing a medical and his contract being formalised.

Barcelona, meanwhile, thanked Suarez for his significant contribution to the club.

The 33-year-old will have a farewell press conference at the Nou Camp on Thursday afternoon.
