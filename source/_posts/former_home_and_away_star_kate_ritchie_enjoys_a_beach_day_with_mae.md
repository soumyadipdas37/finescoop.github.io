She is every inch the doting mother to her sweet daughter, Mae.

And on Sunday, Kate Ritchie shared a snap of herself enjoying an idyllic beach day with the six-year-old, who she shares with former NRL star husband Stuart Webb.

The former Home and Away star, 42, and the youngster looked past their windswept appearance as they smiled for the camera.

The actress-turned-radio star sported large black shades as her brunette locks tumbled across her face. 

'Sandy seafood sticks and a wonderfully windy Sunday.. ☀️' she captioned the snap. 

Earlier this month, Kate revealed the sweet tradition she takes part in every year for Mae's birthday, in an interview with The Australian Women's Weekly.

The actress said they always bake a cake together to celebrate the occasion, from the magazine's Children's Birthday Cake Book.

Fun in the kitchen! Earlier this month, Kate revealed the sweet tradition she takes part in every year for Mae's birthday

Kate told the publication: 'My earliest memory of [the birthday cake book] was flicking through the pages in wonderful birthday anticipation. Something I do with my own daughter now.'

For Mae's first birthday, the doting mother baked a cake in the shape of the number one, which was covered in pink icing and pink chocolate drops.

When Mae turned three, Kate made a Barbie princess cake, and more recently, a cake in the shape of the number five, decorated with stars and ponies.

'Of the six birthday cakes I have baked for my daughter, three have come straight from the Australian Women's Weekly Children's Birthday Cake Book.'

Kate said that her little girl also enjoys the fun of creating something in the kitchen.

'It is just good fun with a lovely sense of achievement attached when we can stand back and marvel at our creations,' she explained.
