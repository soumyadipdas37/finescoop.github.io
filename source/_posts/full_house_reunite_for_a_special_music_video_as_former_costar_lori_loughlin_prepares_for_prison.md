In honor of National Dog Week, the cast of Full House banded together to create a special music video honoring golden retrievers, called 'Gotta Love a Golden.'  

The Zoom reunion occurred nearly six weeks ago, after Full House and Fuller House creator Jeff Franklin penned an original song, to raise money for animal welfare.  

'I called up the cast to see if they would be good sports and play along and everybody was up for it,' Franklin told ET, while noting the reunion coincidences with the 33rd anniversary of Full House.

He joked: 'Over the years, I have forced them to hang out with golden retrievers on the set everyday, so they really are fans of dogs and goldens in particular. It didn't take much arm twisting.'  

Among those also featured in the playful video were Bob Saget, John Stamos, Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin, Andrea Barber and Dave Coulier. 

As expected, Lori Loughlin did not make a cameo, as she awaits her imminent two-month prison sentence, due to her involvement in the college admissions scandal.

Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, paid $500,000 to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella into USC by pretending they were champion coxswains.

The actress, who played Aunt Becky on the hit sitcom from 1988 to 1995, was also absent from Netflix's fifth and final season of the show's spinoff, Fuller House, in December. 

Meanwhile, the cast did not appear to have any qualms about reuniting with Franklin, who was ousted from the Fuller House set in 2018.

Last year, shocking allegations surfaced against Franklin, who claims he was booted because of an executive producer trying to take advantage of the #MeToo movement. 

A number of Fuller House staffers claimed that Franklin ran a toxic writers' room, in which he frequently made inappropriate comments - especially toward the women he worked with. 

One woman said that Franklin would frequently boast about the 'orgies' he had over the weekend, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Another said that Franklin predicted one of the women on his staff was 'going to be pregnant next season' and that he wished 'I could make all the women on my staff get hysterectomies'. 

Two women said that Franklin had his assistant request that all the Fuller House writers come to his mansion, repeatedly reminding them to bring their bikinis.

Staffers also alleged that Franklin expressed his preference for male writers and complained about having to hire directors who were women. 

Franklin filed a new lawsuit against Bryan Behar in April, claiming the executive producer had been plotting to get him kicked off of Fuller House.

The Full House creator, who hired Behar, claimed he was 'resentful' of Franklin's success and was 'motivated by a secret hatred' of him.

'Behar concocted a plan to compile unflattering and distasteful information about Franklin that was either fabricated or twisted versions of events and presented it first to the media and then to Warner Brothers in an effort to get Franklin thrown off Fuller House,' states the suit, obtained by Deadline. 

Franklin was fired from Fuller House in 2018 and also lost his production deal with Warner Bros.

'I'm heartbroken to be leaving Fuller House,' he said in a statement at the time. 'Creating and running Full House and Fuller House has been the greatest joy.'
