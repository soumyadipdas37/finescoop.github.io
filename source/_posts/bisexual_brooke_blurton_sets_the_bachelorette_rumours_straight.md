Bachelor star Brooke Blurton has set the record straight about becoming the first bisexual Bachelorette. 

It was speculated that the beauty would be named this year's Bachelorette before Elly Miles and her sister, Becky were confirmed for the coveted role. 

Speaking to podcast The Babble on Tuesday, Brooke addressed the rumours: 'Look, there was no offer made, but I wouldn't say that I'm not open to it,' she said.

Brooke explained she recently heard she would need to grow her social media following in order to become the new Bachelorette - which she didn't agree with.   

'I don't know, I'd be very open to it,' she began.  

'I'm a little bit different in the sense that I date both sexes and whether Channel 10 and Warner Brothers would be up to a sort-of bi Bachelorette,' she added.

Brooke added she didn't know if an Australian audience would be ready for it.  

'I don't know what they would that look like or if Australia would be ready for that.'

Brooke went on to speak about her time on The Bachelor, saying she has worked the past two years to push herself away from the series.   

Change: 'I'm a little bit different in the sense that I date both sexes and whether Channel Ten and Warner Brothers would be up to a sort-of Bi Bachelorette,' she added

'I really am grateful for the opportunity around that show and how it really worked out in the end I guess,' she said. 

'Because, yeah, I probably came out of it the best way I could have possibly,' she added.

'Especially in that scenario with Honey Badger, you know, not choosing anyone in the end.'

Milestone: Brooke was the first-ever Indigenous finalist on The Bachelor

Brooke has been one of only a handful of openly bisexual stars of the series, Alex Nation being one of the few others. 

The pair had a steamy hookup on series two of Bachelor in Paradise last year.  

Brooke slammed the blonde following the series.    

Love: Brooke was in a short romance with Alex Nation while the pair were on Bachelor In Paradise last year but Alex decided to pursue a romance with Bill Goldsmith 

'I just think Alex never really was genuine with her feelings and I could really read through that,' she told WHO magazine last year.   

The brunette sensationally walked off the show after Alex 'dumped' her a few weeks into last year's season.

Alex explained that she had decided to pursue a relationship with co-star Bill Goldsmith instead.
