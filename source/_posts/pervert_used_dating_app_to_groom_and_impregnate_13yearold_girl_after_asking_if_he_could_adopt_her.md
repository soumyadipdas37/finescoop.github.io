A paedophile has been jailed after impregnating a 13-year-old girl he met on a dating app before offering to adopt her.

Matthew James McIntyre, 35, met his young victim through teenage dating app MyLOL in Adelaide in January 2020.

He later claimed that he used the app to communicated with his adult partner, despite them both living in the same house.

McIntyre said he initially thought the girl was 17 but messages showed he was aware of her real age after she spoke about school and buying a new school uniform.  

Their relationship came to light when a youth worker from the residential care facility found explicit text messages sent between the pair. 

One of the messages showed that the father-of-two had picked up his victim from the facility on January 9 and returned her in the afternoon after they had unprotected sex.

Text messages sent after their meeting showed the victim was trying to end her relationship with McIntyre, The Advertiser reported.

'You, on the other hand, persistently expressed a desire to meet up with her for sexual intercourse, even saying you wished to get her pregnant,' Judge Julie McIntyre said.

'At one point, somewhat oddly, you expressed a wish to adopt her and introduce her to your girlfriend and daughter.'

Judge McIntyre said the victim was vulnerable and suffering from personal issues including the terminal illness of her father.

She said McIntyre showed predatory behaviour. 

'Even when your victim told you she feared she was pregnant and would have to have an abortion because she was unable to cope with a baby you suggested she ought to keep the child and continue to have unprotected sex with you,' Judge McIntyre said.

The pair's relationship was reported to police, which led to the teenager taking a pregnancy test that turned in a positive result.

The 13-year-old later aborted the pregnancy.

McIntyre pleaded guilty to one count of communicating with a child for a prurient purpose with the intention of making a child amenable to sexual activity and one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 14.

He was sentenced to three years and nine months behind bars with a non-parole period of one year and eleven months.

Despite his early guilty plea, Judge McIntyre refused to grant a 40 per cent discount to McIntyre's sentence.

McIntyre will be eligible for parole in July 2022.
