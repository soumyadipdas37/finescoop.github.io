Australian personal trainer Kayla Itsines has shared her top tips for cleaning sweaty workout clothes, including only putting them on a cold wash soaked in baking soda and white vinegar.

The 29-year-old co-founder of the SWEAT app shared a detailed blog post addressing some of the common questions she gets asked about taking care of your athletic gear, which she washes after every use.

Kayla said they need to be treated differently to your regular clothes because most workout tops and shorts are elastic with moisture-wicking fabric.

After completing one of her zero equipment routines Kayla, who lives in South Australia, gets changed straight away and 'airs' the clothes out.

Instead of leaving the outfit bundled up in the washing basket, she said you should hang it over the back of a chair or outside so the sweat can dry.

If you're not planning on washing it that day, place the clothes in a sandwich bag and put them in the freezer because the cold will kill any growing bacteria.

Before washing use an old, soft toothbrush with soap on it to scrub gently at deodorant stains, so you prevent a build-up under the arms.

Kayla owns plenty of workout equipment

1. Remove the sweaty clothing immediately after finishing your workout.

2. Don't bundle up the clothes but instead leave them outside to 'air'.

3. Use an old, soft toothbrush to dab at deodorant stains under the arms.

4. Don't wash with fabric softener but instead use a citrus oil or baking soda.

5. Wash on a gentle, cold setting rather than a warm water cycle.

6. You don't need to separate the workout clothes from your regular items. 

When it's time to clean them properly, turn the clothing inside out so that the side that touched your body is getting the most soap and water on it. 

'Next time you wash your workout clothes, use half as much detergent and add half to one cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle of the wash. White vinegar will eliminate any lingering smell by breaking down the build up of laundry products,' Kayla said.

Avoid fabric softeners as they can damage the elastic fibres in the fabric. 

Instead add lemon juice to leave the clothes smelling fresh, or baking soda to remove the pungent scent. The soda will also prevent colour from seeping out the fabric.  

Kayla doesn't wash her workout gear with sheets and towels, as these will tend to be put on a warmer setting, but she does put them in with delicate items

'Finally, laundry detergent works just as effectively in cold water as it does in hot water so protect the elasticity of your workout clothes by using a cold wash cycle,' she said.

'Some washing machines may even have a specific sportswear setting that you can use.'

You don't need to separate them from the vast majority of clothing.
