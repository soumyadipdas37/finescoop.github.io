Marie Ward is single and lives in Herefordshire. She has two children, Luke, 32, and Bridie, 22, and works in retail.

MONTHLY FACIALS

Once a month, I get a 75-minute Bio-ultimate Age Defying Facial (£55, rosshealthandbeauty.co.uk). They use special probes to tone the muscles and stimulate collagen production before finishing with a face mask. I couldn’t get them during lockdown — and I noticed a big difference. I was finally able to go back last week, which felt amazing.

DAILY GOLDEN GLOW

I’m so pale I often look ill. So I religiously apply Decleor Neroli Bigarade Gradual Glow Tanning Lotion, every morning (£32, decleor.co.uk). It gives you a lovely, natural glow. I also use their Hydrating Facial Cleansing Milk and Toner (both £26), then the Aromessence Neroli Amara Serum (£56) instead of a cream moisturiser. I find that an oil absorbs better into the skin.

SPIN BUNNY

Three times a week, I do a one-hour spin class at my local gym. I find it hard work, but I do it with a great group of girls and the music is so motivational. I also do weights twice a week. During lockdown, I tried running, which almost killed me. I fell over in long grass and couldn’t lift my arm for weeks. I won’t be going back to that. I’m so glad the gyms have re-opened.

TRY LASH EXTENSIONS

A few years ago, I got a full set of eyelash extensions for a Christmas party (£55, rosshealthandbeauty.co.uk). They looked amazing, so I’ve had them topped up since then. Now I don’t need to apply mascara. You wake up first thing, look in the mirror and you’re half done! During lockdown, I had to rely on my Lancome Hypnose Custom Wear Volumising Mascara (£27, boots.com).

BUDGET BLOWDRY

In the mornings, I use BaByliss Thermo-Ceramic Rollers (£35, boots.com) to add volume to my hair. I rough dry it first, then put them in for ten minutes. I wash my hair first with Pantene Pro-V Colour Protect Shampoo and Conditioner (£2.50 each). I’ve been dying my hair blonde for decades and this maintains the colour (blushes.co.uk).
