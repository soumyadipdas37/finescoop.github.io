Curtis Pritchard appeared to be getting on famously with a mystery woman during a night out with his brother AJ on Saturday.

The dancer-turned-reality star, 24, looked cosy as he chatted to the brunette, who looked pretty in a floral blue and white dress.

Curtis also wore a floral patter, in an earth-tone short-sleeved shirt tucked into skinny black jeans.

He rounded off the look with white trainers.

He chatted animatedly to the mystery girl, while his older brother AJ, 25, stood by with his girlfriend Abbie Quinnen.

The group partied at Mayfair nightclub Lux, leaving at 3:30AM.

They had spent the earlier portion of the night at neighbouring hot spot Sexy Fish - where Curtis' ex-girlfriend Maura Higgins was reportedly partying with footballers.

Abbie - who, like Curtis and AJ, is also a dancer - was seen hanging off her boyfriend, who was dressed in all black.

Waiting for a car to collect them, blonde Abbie put on a very leggy display in a red skirt with a large split in the side.

She wore her golden locks loose around her shoulders and added a black jacket to the look.
