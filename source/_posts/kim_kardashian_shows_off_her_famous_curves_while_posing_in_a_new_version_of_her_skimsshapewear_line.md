She revealed this week that her uber popular reality series will be coming to an end next year.

But Kim Kardashian was back to focusing on her Skims business on Friday, posting a new selfie video to her Instagram Stories which showed off a new version from her shapewear line she's been 'working on'.

The brunette beauty, who turns 40 next month, wore a long-sleeve white top and matching floor-length maxi skirt in the sultry snippets, which allowed for a sliver of her midriff to show between the two garments.

Kim explained in the video that she was wearing Skims underneath the outfit, but they were different.

The mother-of-four went on to say that she was 'bothered by' the line created by previous Skims editions when worn under longer skirts and dresses, which showed above the knee. 

The new Skims were different in that they ended at the calf, as opposed to the mid-thigh.

The reality superstar added that she was especially excited about the new development since she wears so many three-quarter-length and full length outfits, and 'hated' seeing that line previously.

'I really wanted the same shapewear that snatched everything really good,' she added.

Kim also hiked up the skirt to show how her curvaceous derriere still had the same 'lift.'

The post comes after Kim K marked one year since the launch of Skims with a share in which she looked every inch the Hollywood pinup.

She wore underthings and sat atop a fabulously patterned car in two of the three photos.

'The SKIMS Special Anniversary Drop!' the mother-of-four said in her caption, adding there were four new shapewear styles, a new color, and 'a restock of our classic styles.' 

She also said in a video that it was very exciting to be at her one year anniversary and she was proud to introduce a new marble color.

This comes after the shocking news that her series Keeping Up With The Kardashians will end in 2021 with season 20.

The iconic reality TV series has followed the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family - including sisters Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe Kardashian, half sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, brother Rob Kardashian, and mother Kris Jenner - for 20 seasons aired over the past 14 years. 

Since finding fame on the show, each of the Kardashian-Jenner clan have gone on to forge their own careers in the fashion and business worlds, whilst each of the siblings - excluding Kendall - now have families of their own.

It has also been said that Khloe 'hasn't stopped crying' over the end of the show.

The Good American founder who has taken the change hardest.

Kris said on On Air With Ryan Seacrest: 'We had to tell the crew yesterday, so we were all crying. But I think Khloe...is probably the one who is taking it the hardest and really hasn't stopped crying since we announced. She's been so sweet and just emotional about it.'

Kris admitted it has been a 'hard' decision to make, but she felt it was the 'right time' to end the show.
