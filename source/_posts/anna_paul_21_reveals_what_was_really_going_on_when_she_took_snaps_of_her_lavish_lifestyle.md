A young social media influencer has revealed what was really going on when she took pictures of her 'lavish' lifestyle.

Anna Paul, from Queensland, has never been shy to talk openly about her family's struggle to make ends meet, in which she previously revealed they once owned an old van with 'milk crates' used as seats.

The 21-year-old has since built a legion of more than 1.1 million followers Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, and she's one of Australia's highest earners on OnlyFans where she charges fans a fee to view her X-rated content.

And while she's been able to sustain her luxurious lifestyle via the subscription service, Anna was forced to defend herself recently after a troll tried to 'expose' her by claiming she didn't grow up poor.

In a TikTok video, she shared the truth behind pictures of her 'wealthy' lifestyle taken during her teenage years - including a picture of herself enjoying first class and getting expensive gifts from her family.

'A girl tried to expose me for lying about being broke,' Anna said in her TikTok video.

Long before she made a living selling pictures and videos of herself, Anna shared snaps of herself in first class and a Louis Vuitton wallet gifted on her 16th birthday.

'My Instagram pictures are fake. Instagram is fake, Instagram is not real,' she said.

Sharing a picture of herself flying first class to Dubai, Anna said she was only upgraded to the seat after her brother vomited all over her in economy class.

'This is me in 2014. First class, right, rich. No,' she said.

'My whole family lives in Germany and we went to go visit them, but of course we couldn't afford plane tickets for everyone so my uncle bought two plane tickets - one for my brother, one for me in economy.

'And during the last 30 minutes of the trip, my brother vomited on me. He vomited all over the seats, and he vomited all over me.

'So they put us in first class in the last 20 minutes because we were minors and I flexed it. Instagram is fake.'

For her 16th birthday, Anna said her mother set aside some money from her welfare benefits over one year just so she could surprise her with an expensive Louis Vuitton wallet (picture)

For her 16th birthday, Anna said her mother set aside some money from her welfare benefits over an entire year just so she could surprise her with an expensive gift.

'My mother bought me a Louis Vuitton wallet. It cost $500... she got $250 on Centrelink a week and she saved up for a year,' she explained.

Anna shared a picture of a YSL purchase after she decided to spoil herself with the last $50 to her name.

'This is a $50 YSL lipstick. I bought this and I couldn't afford the train ticket home, I had to illegally jump on the train,' she admitted.

 Anna said her Tiffany and Co jewellery was gifted to her from her younger brother who found a lucrative way to save up for her birthday.

'When Atis was 13 he used to buy hookahs online for really cheap and then sell them at school for $10 each. For my 16th birthday he saved up for these for me,' she said.

Her video has since been viewed more than 2.4 million times after she wanted to prove that people should 'not believe everything they see' on social media. 

Anna has always been vocal about her upbringing, even revealing in her posts how her family once 'lived off $30 a week for grocery money to feed a family of four'.

She revealed her love for designer labels, saying she used to put $10 away a week just so she could save up money to treat herself with expensive products.

In September 2019, Anna shared a YouTube video revealing how she purchased herself her dream car after her family struggled to buy a 'modern' vehicle when she was young.

'I don't mean it as an ungrateful way. I'm very grateful that we were even able to afford a car,' she explained.

'The car that we then had was a white van that don't have any windows in the back and guess what, it didn't have any seats in the back either, it had milk crates on the ground at the back of the van we sat on as chairs.

'That's the car we had because that's all we can afford because we had no money.'
