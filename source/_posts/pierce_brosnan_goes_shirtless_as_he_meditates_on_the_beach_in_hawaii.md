He recently put his Malibu beachfront mansion, inspired by Tomorrow Never Dies, on the market for $100 million.

And Pierce Brosnan appeared at peace as he tapped into full relaxation mode for a yoga session on the beach near his home in Kauai on Tuesday.

The James Bond actor, 47, who purchased a cottage on the Hawaiian island in 2002, went shirtless to enjoy a spot of snorkelling before he meditated on the sandy shores of the holiday hot spot.

Looking as youthful as ever, the screen star sported swimming trunks while opting for comfort by going barefoot. 

The Mrs. Doubtfire actor was drenched in water after he took a dip in the sea, and was later seen sitting on a tree bark to perform a traditional lotus pose. 

Just days earlier, it was reported that the thespian has decided to move to Hawaii permanently as he put his Malibu mansion up for sale.

The sale will see the 007 star make a tidy profit after he created the estate by combining two separate plots of land that he purchased for just $5.1 million and $2.25 million in 2000. 

The oceanfront retreat spans more than an acre with two homes that combined to make nine bedrooms and 14 bathrooms. 

Pierce told the Wall Street Journal that when he realized 'Die Another Day' was a hit, he turned to his wife, filmmaker Keely Shaye Smith, 57, and told her 'go build your dream house. And she did'.  

The house was built in 2010 and has so many solar panels that the new owner will be able to heat the house, outdoor pool and guest cabana and still sell electricity back to the local grid. 

The home is exceptionally eco-friendly with all water being recycled on site in a purpose-built plant along with a waste disposal system, custom-built energy-saving lighting and a solar-powered revolving compost heap. 

When their dream home was first built, the pair were determined that it would set a new standard in being eco-friendly. 

Wow-factor! Just days earlier, it was reported that the thespian has decided to move to Hawaii permanently as he put his Malibu mansion up for sale 

In the listing featured on realtor Christopher Cortazzo's website, he describes the 'once in a lifetime' property in detail. 

'This retreat is surrounded by wrap-around lanais and courtyards that invite yoga at dawn, relaxing afternoons, sunset cocktails and effortless entertaining beneath the stars,' the description reads. 'On a rare parcel of more than one acre with approximately 117 feet of beachfront, Orchid House is created for resort-style living.' 

The TV and film star fronted four James Bond films from 1995 to 2002: GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day. 

Neighbours on Malibu's Broad Beach also include Cher, Mel Gibson, Steven Spielberg and Goldie Hawn.

Earlier this week, the hunk marked journalist Keeley's 57th birthday by painting a striking artwork.

Pierce shared his vibrant masterpiece that he created for his love and captioned the series of images: 'Happy birthday Keely my darling, thank God for you angel heart. 

'A few paintings on this day, with ever my love. 'Spring” still in the works!' ... 'My Old Chair.'
