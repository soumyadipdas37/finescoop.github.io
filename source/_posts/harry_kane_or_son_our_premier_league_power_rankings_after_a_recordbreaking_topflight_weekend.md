Each week throughout the 2020-21 season, Sportsmail will bring you a Power Rankings table, listing the top-10 hottest players in the Premier League.

As the stories of the season unravel, the rankings will provide a form guide with players moving in and out of the top 10 depending on both their performances in the previous fixtures and also in recent weeks.

So, in a gameweek that saw 44 goals scored over 10 matches, who wins a place in the second weekend of the new season's Power Rankings?

10. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - Arsenal

After netting a fantastic curling effort in the opening-day win over Fulham, Arsenal's club captain may have been disappointed not to grab a goal for the second weekend in a row.

But the 31-year-old did manage to grab an assist for close friend and strike partner Alexandre Lacazette to open the scoring, putting in a precise cross in from the left making it impossible for the French striker to miss.

The fact that Aubameyang is providing goals as well as scoring them is good news for Mikel Arteta and his Arsenal side, who have made a perfect start to the Premier League season to follow their success in the Community Shield.

The Gunners take on Liverpool next weekend in the top-flight, which means Arsenal's leader and main man will have to be at the top of his game if the north Londoners want to gain anything against the Premier League champions. 

9. Emiliano Martinez - Aston Villa

As debuts go, Emiliano Martinez's first performance in an Aston Villa shirt was not too shabby. 

The Argentinian shot stopper became an immediate fan favourite at the Midlands club by saving a penalty and keeping a clean sheet in Villa's 1-0 win over Sheffield United. 

The 27-year-old showed excellent reflexes to deny John Lundstram from 12 yards out, throwing himself down to his right to tip away the ball using his strong palms. If Martinez keeps up this vein of form then Arsenal may just regret letting their FA Cup-winning goalkeeper go.

8. Mateusz Klich - Leeds United  

Mateusz Klich had a goal and an assist in Leeds' first Premier League win against Fulham

Leeds' star midfielder scored a sensational goal against Liverpool in matchday one and continued his fine form by scoring one and assisting another in the Whites' thrilling 4-3 win over Fulham. 

Klich put Marcelo Bielsa's side 2-1 in front from the penalty spot, before playing a key role in Patrick Bamford's goal in the second period to extend Leeds' advantage. 

The Polish midfielder played a slick no-look reverse pass through to the Leeds No 9, who expertly curled home from inside the area. The season may be two games old but Klich is already turning into a vital player at Elland Road. 

7. Tariq Lamptey - Brighton

Chelsea must really regret letting Tariq Lamptey go. The young full-back impressed against the Blues on matchday one but put in an even better display as Brighton eased to a 3-0 win at Newcastle. 

The 19-year-old won a penalty for the visitors after just three minutes, with his pace causing so many problems for opposite man Allan Saint-Maximin that he had to go off injured in the first-half. 

Lamptey then played a delightful ball up the line to release Leandro Trossard, who crossed for Neal Maupay to score his second of the game. Brighton may sweat over a slight knock he picked up in the game but it was another superb display from the young right-back. 

6. James Rodriguez - Everton 

James Rodriguez scored one and was key in two more as Everton beat West Brom 5-2

Everton's marquee signing scored his first goal in his new colours during the Toffees' impressive 5-2 win over newly-promoted West Brom on Saturday. 

The Colombian's superb swivel-and-shot put Carlo Ancelotti's side 2-1 in front in the first-half, with James also having a role in getting Kieran Gibbs sent off just before the break.

The 29-year-old's brilliant scooped pass allowed Richarlison to slide the ball towards Dominic Calvert-Lewin for his second goal of the game, while the midfielder's superb corner landed on the head of the Everton No 9 who completed both his treble and the scoring at Goodison Park that day.  



5. Harry Kane - Tottenham Hotspur

The England captain became just the sixth player in Premier League history to register four assists in a match in Spurs' 5-2 win over Southampton. 

The 27-year-old set up all of Son Heung-Min's goals at St Mary's, with some of the assists being excellent passes into the South Korean, before grabbing a goal for himself at the end of the match. 

Jose Mourinho and Tottenham will be delighted Kane is off the mark in the Premier League after a disappointing match against Everton on the opening weekend. 

4. Dominic Calvert-Lewin - Everton 

Dominic Calvert-Lewin made it four goals in two games with a hat-trick against West Brom

Everton's main man up top added to his opening weekend winner at Tottenham with a superb hat-trick against West Brom on Saturday. 

All three of Calvert-Lewin's goals came from either in the penalty area or the six-yard box, hinting that the 23-year-old is an excellent poacher in front of goal. 

It may not have been the most glamorous of hat-tricks, but the young Englishman has the impression of a right-place-right-time sort of striker. 

Sadio Mane got off the mark for the season by netting two goals in Liverpool's win at Chelsea 

3. Sadio Mane - Liverpool 

Liverpool's No 10 had a relatively quiet opening day in front of goal but was still part of a front line that scored four goals against newly-promoted Leeds United.

The story was very different at Stamford Bridge in week two, with Mane scoring both goals to give the Premier League champions victory over 10-man Chelsea.

He showed great athleticism to meet Roberto Firmino's cross to head the Reds in front, while his second goal showed his relentless work rate by closing down Blues goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, intercepting his clearance and tapping into an empty net.

Wilfried Zaha scored twice against his former club as Crystal Palace beat Manchester United

2. Wilfried Zaha - Crystal Palace

The Ivorian winger made it the perfect return to Old Trafford by scoring twice to seal a shock Crystal Palace win at Manchester United. 

The 27-year-old gave the Eagles a two-goal lead in the second-half by scoring from the spot after the initial penalty from Jordan Ayew was retaken as David De Gea was caught off his goalline. 

Zaha confirmed the win just before the end of the match with a superb run, jink and finish past a despairing de Gea to maintain Palace's 100 per cent start to the season. 

1. Son Heung-Min - Tottenham Hotspur

Son Heung-Min was a devastating threat for Spurs and netted four times at St Mary's

Tottenham started the game against Southampton poorly. Jose Mourinho's side fell behind in the opening period and had countless attacks snuffed out due to offsides.

But an inspired Son Heung-Min turned the tables for Spurs. The South Korean was devastating on the break and scored four goals to hand the visitors victory.

Harry Kane will be grateful that he has another forward to share the burden of Spurs' goalscoring exploits this season - and with Gareth Bale now signed up, Tottenham could have a deadly trio on their hands.
