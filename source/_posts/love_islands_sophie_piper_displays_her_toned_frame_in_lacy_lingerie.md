She shot to fame on the first ever series of Winter Love Island earlier this year.

And Sophie Piper was every inch the star as she posed in racy lingerie for George at Asda's new Lounge Edit on Monday.

The reality starlet, 21, displayed her ample cleavage and taut midriff in an electric blue lacy bra paired with matching high-waisted underwear as she posed.

Her raven tresses were styled sleek and straight while fluttery lashes, kohl liner and rose gloss accentuated her pretty features.

She then slipped into a pretty floral terracotta bra as she reclined on a bed, displaying her slender waist in the radiant snap. 

Sophie was joined by lookalike sister Lili Piper in the shoot, with Lili wowing in a navy bra and joggers.   

Sophie's shoot comes following reports she split with Connor Durman just six months after leaving the villa.

The admin assistant and the coffee bean salesman, 25, met and fell for each over during the winter version of the ITV2 series in January this year, with the duo said to have taken things slowly once they got home.

However, amid the coronavirus pandemic, it's reported that the pair haven't seen each other since lockdown began and that they never even made their romance 'official'.   

A source told The Sun: 'Things just fizzled out. They never even went official.'

They continued: 'It just didn’t have a chance to get started because of lockdown and they both agreed it was better to just stay friends.'

When Connor was dumped from the South African villa, the pair vowed to continue their relationship once they got both got back to the UK.

However, things were not meant to be as they never got around to officially becoming boyfriend and girlfriend.

 MailOnline have contacted Sophie's representatives for comment. 

In February, Sophie insisted that she was not in a relationship with her reality co-star beau during a radio interview on Will Njobvu’s radio show on Capital XTRA alongside fellow evictee Leanne Amaning.

'No we are not together at all!' she declared. 'We are just seeing each other! It's a situation-ship. I will get to know him, go on dates with him.' 

Sophie, whose sister is Rochelle Humes, added: 'He's met both of my sisters at Aftersun the other day. I've met his sister. They think he's lovely. They approve.'

 Meanwhile, Connor was said to have denied the pair were on the rocks back in March, hinting that they were set to move in together. 

Elsewhere, it was recently announced that the TV series won't be airing another winter edition in 2021.

The summer 2020 series was cancelled in May due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and bosses at the channel recently announced that the next series of the ITV2 dating show won't be for another year.

'Love Island UK will return bigger and better than ever with an extended run in summer 2021,' ITV announced in a statement to MailOnline.

 The axing of both the summer 2020 series and a winter series in early 2021 is in large part down to the coronavirus pandemic, with restrictions on travel and filming causing huge issues for the show.

Pre-production on the winter 2021 series was scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, but with so many quarantine and social distancing measures still in place, it's thought it wouldn't be possible to fly cast and crew to location and work safely.

Instead producers are keen to focus on one bumper season of the show next summer, which will likely return to Mallorca, after the winter 2020 series took place in South Africa.
