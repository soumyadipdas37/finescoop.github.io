With just under one month until Season 16 of The Bachelorette debuts, a new promo reveals footage from what may be the most controversial season yet.

The new teaser (via Bachelor Nation YouTube) lays on the  puns rather heavy, with the 39-year-old Crawley, who first appeared on Season 18 of The Bachelor, revealing the drama gets started earlier than ever.

'Drama this soon, is a little bit crazy,' Crawley admits in confession, as the promo seemingly refers to the behind-the-scenes controversy that started this summer.

'You want Clare-ity,' the announcer says, while one contestant tells Clare, 'My heart is pounding,' and Clare tells another contestant, 'I'm so falling in love with you.'

Another contestant angrily adds, 'We caught you in a lie, as the announcer adds, 'You want us to Clare-ify.'

Then we see an angrier side of Clare, when one contestant says, 'I'm not done yet,' though Clare snaps back, 'You are done. Get out of here' before storming off.

Snarky announcer guy adds,' You want Clare-ification,' continuing the pun-heavy theme, as another contestant is seen crying in confession stating, 'You just don't know when it's going to happen.'

'But you don't have Top Secret Clare-ance,' snarky announcer guy adds, as Clare is seen kissing a blindfolded contestant.

A number of quick shots including Clare crying and a number of guys chasing after Clare, yelling her name, are shown, before the final shot with host Chris Harrison.

'Congratulations, you've just blown up The Bachelorette,' Harrison tells her, as the promo comes to an end. 

It was reported in August that Clare Crawley was replaced by Tayshia Adams, who appeared on Season 23 of The Bachelor, after Crawley fell for one of her original suitors while production was delayed due to COVID-19.

'One of her potential guys found a way to get in touch with her and they began talking,' a source told People in August.

'By the time filming officially began, they were basically already in love. No one else stood a chance. It just became so obvious from her subsequent few dates that her heart wasn’t in it and she just wasn’t feeling it. Then she said she wanted out,' the source added.

Production started last month at La Quinta Resort in Palm Springs, California last month, with Crawley spotted on the set, though it's not clear when Adams will begin her stint on the show.

A source added that, 'Tayshia was game and ready to go. What remains to be seen is if more men will be brought in now to give Tayshia a full roster of suitors.'

The Bachelorette wrapped filming last week, with the season premiere slated to air on Tuesday, October 13 on ABC.
