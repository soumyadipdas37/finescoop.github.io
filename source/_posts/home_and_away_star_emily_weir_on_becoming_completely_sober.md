Emily Weir plays resident beach babe Mackenzie Booth on Seven's Home and Away. 

Speaking to My Kitchen Rules star Romel Kouyan for his Instagram TV channel on Wednesday, the actress revealed why she went completely sober two years ago.

The 29-year-old explained how alcohol 'became a hindrance' and 'didn't mesh well' with who she was as a person.

Emily admitted that while she gave alcohol 'a good run for its money' in her early twenties, essentially, it just doesn't work for her. 

'It just doesn't mesh well with who I am or what I was about,' she told Romel. 'I did get to a point of drinking a lot, partying too much... it became more [of] a hindrance than anything else.'  

Emily went on to reveal how she had an epiphany one day, and made the decision to refrain from drinking.

'It's crazy looking back. To have made that decision, especially when it's embedded in not just our culture, but in the industry,' she said upon reflection.

'[But] I'm so much better off without it. It didn't work for me mentally, it was something that was holding me back,' Emily continued.

The soap star said the future appeared suddenly brighter and doors began to open, once she decided to quit and seek help through Alcohol Anonymous meetings.

'It was like winning the Lotto for myself and for all my extended family members,' she said. 

'My family still watches Home and Away. They call it Homie. When Homie is on ... everything just shuts down. You are not allowed to make calls or anything.'
