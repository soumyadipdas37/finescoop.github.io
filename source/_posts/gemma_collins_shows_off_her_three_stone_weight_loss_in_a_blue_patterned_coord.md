It comes after reports that Gemma is set to cash in with a mega bucks deal with fashion brand In The Style.

The deal follows the huge success of her meme collection with the retailer, with big names including Little Mix's Jade Thirwall seen wearing clothes from the range.

A source told The Mirror: 'Gemma's made a mint for In The Style – her meme range was a sell out and stars like Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall have been seen in her designs.'
