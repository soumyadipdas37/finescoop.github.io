She is enjoying the single life after splitting from Bachelor in Paradise bad boy Ciarran Stott earlier this year.

And Kirralee 'Kiki' Morris showed her ex what he's missing as she stripped down to a bikini at Kutti Beach in Vaucluse, Sydney, on Thursday.

The glamour model-turned-reality star, 33, flaunted her curves in a tiny two-piece while soaking up the glorious weather. 

Easy, tiger! Kirralee 'Kiki' Morris showed her ex Ciarran Stott what he's missing as she stripped down to a bikini at Kutti Beach in Vaucluse, Sydney, on Thursday

Kiki risked a wardrobe malfunction as she squeezed her buxom figure into the tiger print bikini and a pair of denim shorts.

The socialite has made no secret of the extensive cosmetic procedures she's undergone to achieve her glamorous appearance.

She has admitted to having a breast enlargement as well as various non-surgical skin treatments over the years.

In 2016, when she was contestant on Richie Strahan's season of The Bachelor, Kiki told OK! she'd had a boob job after being bullied for her 'flat chest' in high school. 

'I used to get teased for being so flat-chested,' she said. 'It definitely made me feel less self-conscious.'

In addition to plastic surgery, Kiki is also a fan of cosmetic injectables.

In 2017, she underwent Botox injections to reshape her jawline and relax the muscles around her jaw, which had become tight over time.

She said at the time that one reason for getting the procedure was to relieve the severe headaches caused by jaw pressure.

'I'm a notorious jaw clencher in my sleep so much so I wake up with migraines and from that it's contributed to my strong jawline,' she said.

She added that the procedure helped her 'achieve a slimmer jaw while correcting my jaw clenching habits'.

There has been speculation that Kiki may also have had dermal lip filler, as she often displays a plump pout in photos, but this has never been confirmed.

Meanwhile, Kiki keeps her skin looking smooth with regular laser treatments.

Bootylicious: In addition to this, she regularly undergoes radiofrequency cavitation to firm the skin around her buttocks. This procedure is also known as a 'non-surgical Brazilian butt lift'

'I get SGA laser treatment on my skin, which helps me with my breakouts and really keeps my skin looking healthy,' she told OK! magazine in 2017.

In addition to this, the bombshell regularly undergoes radiofrequency cavitation to firm the skin around her buttocks.

Over! Her beach sighting comes about eight months after she had her heart broken by womaniser Ciarran Stott (right) on Bachelor in Paradise, which was filmed in Fiji late last year

Her beach sighting comes about eight months after she had her heart broken by womaniser Ciarran on Bachelor in Paradise, which was filmed in Fiji late last year.

Right before the finale, Ciarran told Kiki he was in love with her and wanted them to leave the show together without going through the formality of a rose ceremony.

Unfortunately, the couple split up just a few weeks after returning to Australia.

Ciarran, who rose to fame on Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette, apparently 'ghosted' Kiki and moved from Sydney to Melbourne.
