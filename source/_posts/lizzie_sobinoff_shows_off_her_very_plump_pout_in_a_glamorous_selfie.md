Married At First Sight star Elizabeth Sobinoff underwent a complete transformation after first appearing on the show.

And the 29-year-old appeared to shock herself with her latest Instagram selfie, which showed off her very plump pout. 

In the image, Lizzie showed off a heavily filtered portrait photo, and claimed it doesn't even look like her. 

'Doesn't look like me': Married At First Sight star Lizzie Sobinoff, 29, showed off her very plump pout in a glamorous Instagram selfie. (L) Wednesday (R) on MAFS 

Lizzie had her brunette tresses out, while showing off her features. 

'Yeah, I don't even think this looks like me,' she captioned the post. 

Before adding: 'I was like "okay" the Instagram selfie mode with a swipe across to the 'Paris' filter does wonders.' 

Racy: Elizabeth shared raunchy photos of her boyfriend Seb Guilhaus, 32, (R) on Tuesday, including one in a pair of tiny red jocks 

Lizzie looked worlds away from her first time on the reality show back in 2019, when she was paired with Sam Ball. 

Lizzie is now in a relationship with Seb Guilhaus, with the couple going from strength to strength since getting together. 

The former jewellery store manager shared a number of raunchy pictures of the former Adelaide footballer to Instagram on Tuesday.  

Almost nude: In the accompanying image, which was split into four pictures, Seb was seen shirtless at a beach, and posing against a wall in various stages of undress



'I know I said I was giving posting a break but let's just give some appreciation for my man Seb Guilhaus,' she wrote.   

In the accompanying image, which was split into four pictures, Seb was seen shirtless at a beach, and posing against a wall in various stages of undress. 

In one frame, the tanned Adonis is seen rocking a pair of itty-bitty red jocks, that appeared rolled down, perhaps to avoid tan lines.  

Ringing it in: 'He said to me ''Is it S & L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it,' Lizzie wrote

Lizzy went on to promote the personal trainer's six-week challenge. 'Far out why would you not join his 6 week challenge,' she questioned.

Before adding: 'Get a glimpse of this every morning and night. He's going to kill me for posting this �� #sorrynotsorry.'  

She finished: 'Literally in the other room right next to me and has no idea' 

It comes after the couple sparked engagement rumours, after they swapped silver rings at the weekend.

So in love! Elizabeth often shares loved-up selfies with her hunky other half, after meeting him during her second stint on Married At First Sight  

Taking to Instagram, Lizzie shared a sentimental photograph of their new jewellery. 

'He said to me ''Is it S & L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it.'   

Over at Seb's Instagram, he wrote: 'Compromise ... give and take ... melding of two worlds.'

'For relationships to flourish we need to want to really be a part of each others worlds,' he continued. 

The rings were just a sweet gesture and not to signify an engagement. 

Happy couple: Since meeting on the popular dating show, Seb recently relocated to Sydney where they are now living as a couple
