A 'witch hunt' against a teenage boy has been sparked after a girl killed herself on school grounds. 

Maria Witehira's body is believed to have been found at Morrinsville College, on New Zealand's North Island, August 23.

The 16-year-old's sudden death sent shock waves through the small rural community, with some speculating Maria had been abused by a boy.

The boy at the centre of the rumours has since faced a barrage of abuse and threats online, his mother claimed.

'One person started a rumour and it became gospel,' she told the New Zealand Herald.

'None of them have asked him Maria's story.'

Maria's aunt, Shalima Gibson, said the boy had played no part in Maria's death. 

She said the teen had already been going through a lot.

The school board have gone into damage control, with principal John Inger urging students to think before they post anything.

Morrinsville College board chair Ngaire Te Ahu penned a Facebook post condemning the messages being posted on social media about Maria's death.

'I want to reassure all parents that the response from the principal and staff has been to provide strong support to ensure the well-being of all of those students and staff affected, especially through support actions taken by our guidance counsellors and external agencies.

'We at the school were very concerned that some of our students had been pointing the finger of blame for our student's passing unfairly by writing inaccurate, offensive and sometimes threatening comments on social media sites, and we appealed to parents to help us to stop this happening. Efforts were also made at school to stop this occurring.'

There is a coronial inquest underway.
