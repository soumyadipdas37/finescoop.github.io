Gregory Blue, 38, has been charged with robbery, assault and larceny in connection to an attack that took place outside a Chinese restaurant in December 2019

A man suspected of committing an armed robbery in Connecticut has attempted to explain away the presence of his blood at the crime scene by claiming that a phlebotomist had dropped his DNA from a plane. 

Gregory Blue, 38, was charged on Friday with first-degree robbery, second-degree assault and second-degree larceny in connection to the attack that took place on December 16, 2019, outside the Golden Palace Chinese Restaurant on Norwich-New London Turnpike. 

According to an arrest warrant affidavit cited by CT Post, a 45-year-old man walked out of the eatery at around 10pm and was approached by a man in the parking lot, later identified at Blue, who asked him for a light. 

The stranger then pulled out a gun and demanded that the victim hand over 'everything you have, or I am going to kill you,' the warrant stated. 

After ordering the victim to give up his cellphone and keys, the suspect momentarily lowered his gun. The victim made an attempt to wrest the firearm out of the robber's hands and a tussle ensued. 

The warrant stated the Blue struck the man in the head with the gun but the weapon did not fire.

A warrant states that Blue approached a 45-year-old man in the parking lot of Golden Palace restaurant in Montville, Connecticut, asking for a light, then pulled a gun on him and demanded his money, cellphone and keys 

During the scuffle, both men fell to the ground, and the victim told police that Blue stabbed him in the side with a knife. 

Despite his injury, the victim said he was able to get the gun away from his attacker, physically overpowered him and possibly even stabbed him with his own knife, sending the robber fleeing on foot up the nearby Route 2A on-ramp, reported Norwich Bulletin.

The wounded 45-year-old gave chase but Blue jumped over a guardrail and vanished in a wooded area.  

Police said the victim suffered minor cuts and stab wounds to his chest, back and finger, but refused medical attention. 

The gun used in the robbery was recovered two weeks later in the restaurant parking lot and turned out to be an Airsoft gun, according to the document.

Investigators at the scene observed a large blood smear on a metal guardrail on the on-ramp. Forensic experts were able to recover DNA from the bloodstain and from two hats the victim told police were knocked off the robber's head.

Blue was interviewed by investigators and swabbed for DNA in late June while jailed in Montville in connection to an unrelated crime. 

According to the warrant, Blue denied any wrongdoing and claimed that one of the detectives planted his DNA at the scene.

He then offered an alternative version of events, alleging 'that a phlebotomist who took his blood years ago dropped his DNA at the scene via airplane' according to the warrant.

The state forensic lab later confirmed the DNA recovered from the scene was consistent with Blue’s.

Blue has a prior criminal record in Connecticut that includes robbery, harassment and escape convictions. 

He is being held on $250,000 bail pending his next court hearing set for October 30. 

Blue faces additional charges of robbery and assault for allegedly trying to steal a bicycle from a man and stabbing its owner in April.
