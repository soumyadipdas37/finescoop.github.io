It doesn't take much for her to turn heads.

And Irina Shayk was at it again on Wednesday as she made her way through New York City.

The catwalk queen, 34, flashed her runway legs in a tiny pair of shorts and knee-high snake print boots.

Model behavior! Irina Shayk was at it again on Wednesday as she took the streets of New York City by storm

Irina oozed confidence as she strutted through the Big Apple in her revealing yet trendy outfit.

While flashing her legs with a tiny pair of shorts, she covered up the remained of her body with an over-sized 032c sweatshirt.

The model tucked a slim pair of shades into her neckline while carrying a majority of her belongings inside her leather purse, which hung off her shoulder.

Irina did not wear a face mask, but she did have one on her.

The model's stunning complexion was put on full display as she slicked her brunette tresses back into a neat little bun, while accessorizing with gold hoop earrings.

At one point, Irina appeared to stop for a selfie.

Irina did not appear to be joined by her three-year-old daughter Lea, whom she shares with her ex-boyfriend Bradley Cooper.

The couple split after four years together last year, and have been co-parenting Lea together ever since.

Bradley recently revealed he had been teaching their daughter how to swim in his bathtub while caring for his mother Gloria Campano at home.

'I'm with my daughter and my mother and my two dogs, and we have not left the house,' he said in a discussion with Interview Magazine. 'My mother is going to be 80, and she has a colostomy bag, so I can't let anybody in the house. And I can't leave the house, because if she gets it, it's over.'

'We live in a little townhouse, thankfully there's a backyard. I'm running a one-man preschool. We get up, we do swim class in the bathtub.'
