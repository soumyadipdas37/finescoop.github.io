With office workers now urged to work from home if they can, the thought of returning to the workplace has become a daunting prospect for many once again.

Companies across the country have invested thousands into making their headquarters Covid-safe - and one housebuilding firm has gone above and beyond.

Weston Group has invested £40million into a new state of the art complex, with its five star hotel-inspired decor and enviable facilities designed to lure nervous workers back to the office. 

Having dubbed itself the most luxurious housebuilder HQ in Britain, the Weston Innovation Centre is located in the Stansted Business Hub in Takeley, Essex, close to the airport.

More than 200 Weston Homes employees are expected to return to the brand new office on Monday 12 October, alongside reception staff, chefs for the on site brasserie restaurant (pictured), baristas to serve fresh coffee and, of course, a dedicated Covid-19 cleaning team

An assortment of lounges are provided for meetings or simply chilling out, and a bar for after work drinks - something many of us have missed during lockdown

A hotel-style entrance greets visitors, and access to the first floor is provided by a spectacular curved double staircase which rises through the chic atrium.

The underside of the double staircase is polished black with runway lighting, a design inspired by the Dolce and Gabbana flagship store. 

There is also a well-equipped and mirrored gym with a dedicated personal instructor to help train staff members, freeweights, an array of machines and upmarket changing facilities.

Crucially, the new headquarters will allow the group's staff to safely work and social distance from one another, with built-in screens separating desks and plenty of room to move around the open-plan space

The glass fronted building was designed by Weston Group's in-house architectural design studio, working in conjunction with leading London interior designer Oz Lancaster of OS Design, who collaborated with Weston on the luxurious hotel-inspired specification and interior design of the foyers, meeting areas, lounges and leisure facilities.

Bob Weston, chairman and managing director of Weston Group commented: 'The new state-of-the-art HQ building sets a benchmark for quality in terms of headquarter buildings and provides office space, amenities and leisure facilities to help ensure we deliver the very best working environment within the housebuilding industry.'

Weston Group financed the building of the new HQ from the HSBC Green Loan scheme (which supports sustainable projects) and the building has a BREEAM rating of VERY GOOD. 

The basement parking facility has charging for electric cars and Weston is committed to meeting government targets to shift the group's car fleet to electric cars.

Weston Group have sold the Weston Innovation Centre building to Uttlesford District Council and then leased the building back from the council, providing Weston with headquarters premises and the council with a long term investment asset.
