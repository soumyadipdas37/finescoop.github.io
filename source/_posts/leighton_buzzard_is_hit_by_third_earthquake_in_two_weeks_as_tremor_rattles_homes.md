A Bedfordshire town has been hit by a third earthquake in two weeks.

The earthquake was centered on Leighton Buzzard, just weeks after a 3.5 quake struck the same town, on September 8.

A third tremor, which hit at 11.20pm on Sunday, September 13, was measured by the British Geological Survey (BGS) at magnitude 2.1.

It is thought to have been an aftershock from the quake that was felt on September 8.

Twitter users in the town reported feeling the latest shaking shortly after 9.30am this morning.

One said: 'Was that another earthquake in Leighton Buzzard? Anyone else feel that?' 

The second Leighton Buzzard quake earlier this month was thought to have been an aftershock from the magnitude 3.5 quake that was felt on September 8. Pictured: A map showing the quake
