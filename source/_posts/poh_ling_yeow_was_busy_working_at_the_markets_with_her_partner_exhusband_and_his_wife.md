MasterChef's Poh Ling Yeow was in some cosy company as she worked at her food stall The Jamface Cakequarium at Adelaide Showground Farmers Market on Sunday. 

The 47-year-old chef was spotted cooking up a storm with her current partner Jono Bennett, her ex-husband Matthew Phipps and his new wife Sarah Rich.

Poh was busy making delicious treats,  including tarts and cakes as the shoppers lined up.

The former MaserChef star kept warm in black jeans, a green jumper and a colourful scarf.

She completed her comfortable ensemble with her pair of yellow sneakers and wore silver earrings.

At one point, Poh stood off to the side chatting to her ex Matthew and several other shoppers.

Poh and Matthew have remained friends since they split several years ago, and he's now married to her best friend and Jamface business partner, Sarah. 

The former couple met in 1990 - at the time both were Mormons - and were married for nine years. 

Poh then met Jono in 2009 on the first season of MasterChef. She was a contestant while he was working behind the scenes as a runner.

They started dating after the show's finale, and married five years later in 2014.

In an extraordinary twist, the two couples went into business together and opened their café, Jamface.

Poh has made no secret of the unusual arrangement, saying in multiple interviews that the four of them are adults who manage to make things work.

'He's my ex-husband. She's my best friend. And when we broke up, they got together and it's all dandy. It's actually really good!' she told Mamamia in 2017.
