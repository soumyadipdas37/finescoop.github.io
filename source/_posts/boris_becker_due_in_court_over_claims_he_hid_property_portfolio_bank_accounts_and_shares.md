Boris Becker will appear in court this week to face 19 criminal charges over claims he hid his property portfolio along with bank accounts and shares in an artificial intelligence firm during his bankruptcy hearings. 

The German former tennis star is accused of not complying with obligations to disclose information. 

The 52-year-old was declared bankrupt in June 2017, but now faces civil claims that he failed to fully declare his estate.

The High Court has imposed restrictions on the Grand Slam winner's finances for the next 11 years, as the Insolvency Service raised concerns over 'undisclosed,' transactions. 

It's alleged he hid his stake of shares in AI firm Breaking Data Corp and did not mention bank accounts in Belgium and Guernsey to bankruptcy proceedings. 

He allegedly had a flat in Coleherne Court, Chelsea, which went undeclared between June and October 2018, along with two other German properties. 

Becker has also been accused of not disclosing a £620,000 debt, hiding a £1.5million sum of money and not declaring bank accounts which were holding £1.2million.

Last year he agreed to a 12-year Bankruptcy Restrictions Undertaking after the allegations came to light. 

In the case, which is being prosecuted by the Insolvency Service, Becker has been charged with ten counts of concealing property from the bankruptcy receiver or trustee, two charges of failing to disclose property, three counts of failing to disclose details of an estate, concealing a debt, and three charges of omission in a statement of affairs by a bankrupt.

Becker has not yet entered any pleas and is due at Westminster Magistrates Court on September 24.
