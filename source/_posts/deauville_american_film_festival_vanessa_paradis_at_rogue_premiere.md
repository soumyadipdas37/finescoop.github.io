She made an elegant appearance at the Deauville American Film Festival's opening ceremony last week.

And Vanessa Paradis was back for another turn on the red carpet on Friday, as she arrived at the premiere for Rogue at the 46th annual event. 

The French singer, 47, looked typically chic in silver gown, which featured a tiered skirt and cape detailing around the collar of the dress.

Wow! Vanessa Paradis was back for another turn on the red carpet on Friday, as she arrived at the premiere for Rogue at the 46th annual event

Vanessa's gown featured glitzy buttons down the front of the dress and was cinched around her waist with a ruched belt, highlighting her svelte waist.

She teamed the dress with a pair of black velvet heels and accessorised with a beaded necklace and a selection of bracelets.

The media personality, who shares her two children Lily and John with ex Johnny Depp, swept her blonde locks back into a loose bun.

The Deauville American Film Festival is a yearly celebration dedicated to films from US cinema, and is held in the French city of the same name, and this year Vanessa has been appointed President of the Jury.

Vanessa's appearance comes after her testimony in her ex Johnny's libel case was cancelled last month.

The star, who was in a relationship with Johnny for more than 14 years and had two children with him, had been expected to give evidence in support of the Pirates Of The Caribbean star's case over a videolink.

But the court was told that there was no need for her - or his ex-fiancee in the 1990s, actress Winona Ryder - to give evidence because Depp's claim that he has never hit a woman was only tested by the defence regarding Amber Heard.

However their bombshell statements were released by the court, showing both stood faithfully by his side. Winona said she was 'absolutely shocked, confused and upset' by the allegations against him.

She added in her statement, provided in advance of the trial: 'The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved.

'I cannot wrap my head around these accusations. He was never, never violent towards me. He was never, never abusive at all towards me. He has never been violent or abusive towards anybody I have seen,' she added.

Johnny is suing The Sun publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) and its executive editor over an April 2018 article which alleged he was violent towards ex-wife Amber, 34, during their tumultuous relationship.
