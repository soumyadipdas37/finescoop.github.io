2DayFM cancelled its Grant, Ed and Ash breakfast show in August 2019 and replaced it with a daily music playlist hosted by Jamie Angel.

But now, the network is reportedly looking for a new radio host to front the show in 2021.

According to Radio Today, Sophie Monk, Julia Morris and Carrie Bickmore are in the running to host 2Day FM's Sydney breakfast show.

'Names being thrown around by industry insiders include Sophie Monk and another TV personality said to be in the mix is Julia Morris,' the website stated. 

Carrie Bickmore and her Project co-host Tommy Little could also be promoted to the 2Day FM breakfast show.

Carrie has been an anchor on the news and lifestyle program since its first season in 2009.

Meanwhile, former Bachelorette turned Love Island presenter Sophie Monk, 40, was recently announced as the new host of Seven's next season of Beauty and The Geek. 

Julia, 52, is best known for her role as co-host of Ten's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! Australia, alongside Dr Chris Brown. 

In August last year, Hit Network cancelled its breakfast show hosted by Grant Denyer, Ed Kavalee and Ash London after it suffered 18 months of dismal ratings.

It was replaced by a music-only program, until a new lineup is officially announced by Southern Cross Austereo.

The axing marked the network's sixth failed attempt to launch a successful breakfast show following Kyle and Jackie O's departure in 2014.

Previous hosts of the 2Day FM breakfast show include Rove McManus and Sam Frost in 2016, and Em Rusciano and Harley Breen in 2017.
