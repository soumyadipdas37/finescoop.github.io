She is now getting back to work as the modeling world resumes, with new restrictions, amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

And Bella Hadid is making sure her skin is plump and glowing as she used a coffee scrub before heading to work on Thursday. 

The 23-year-old model filmed her bare torso covered in the coffee grounds scrub and posted it to her Instagram Story.

'My bestie made me a coffee scrub before work this morning,' she wrote alongside the nude snaps. 'Blessed.' 

She went on to tag her friend Lauren Perez calling her `skin queen.' 

Bella recorded a boomerang video of her bare stomach and under cleavage covered in the brown scrub. 

Coffee scrubs are known to reduce inflammation, increase circulation, reduce puffiness and the appearance of cellulite among other benefits.

The sister of Gigi has been back in New York City to resume working, after spending most of lockdown in Pennsylvania with her family. 

Bella has been overjoyed at being back to work in the city amid the pandemic.

The model recently landed the Vogue Italia September cover alongside many other notable models like Emily Ratajkowski. 

 The 100 covers edition of the reputable magazine seeks to showcase celebrities and ordinary people of all ages, ethnicities and shapes who all have a story to share.

 She also posted some snaps from her Burberry campaign that was shot right before lockdown. The model is the face of their pocket bag as she posed with a panther statue for the shoot.

'This is my second campaign for Burberry and it is always such an exciting experience working with Riccardo - he has such amazing creative ideas and ways of interpreting a collection,' the stunner shared.   

The busy beauty has also been using her social media for immense good, telling her fans to vote and encouraging them to donate to many of the important social causes plaguing the United States and the world.

 Last week Bella made her virtual VMA's appearance as she presented Lady Gaga with the first MTV Trichon Award. 

The media buzzed as news dropped that she had run into her on and off ex-boyfriend The Weeknd - whose real name is Abel Tesfaye - at a rehearsal before the show. 

Though the two have had a rocky relationship, the pair reportedly did not have an awkward run in. A source revealed, 'They played it cool and crossed paths with each other, same place, same time' but appear to be on 'good terms.' 

Having spent the majority of quarantine on her mother Yolanda Hadid's Pennsylvania farm, it seems the model intends to stay in the city for fall as work slowly picks up again.
