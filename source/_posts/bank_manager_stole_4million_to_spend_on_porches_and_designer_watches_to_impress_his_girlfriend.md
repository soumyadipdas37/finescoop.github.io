Andi Lee, 39, who worked at the Doncaster Branch of the Bank of Melbourne, was obsessed with the high life, flashy cars and clothes.

He stole more than $4million to fund his lavish lifestyle between 2015 and 2019 as a way of keeping up appearances, posing as 'Mr Successful'.

 The 39-year-old has been jailed for seven years and eight months, after being sentenced over his crimes at Victoria's County Court on Friday.

He must serve at least three years and 10 months before being eligible for release on parole.

Lee earlier told the court he'd spent years trying to be someone he wasn't, until he couldn't tell the difference between lies and reality.

He pleaded guilty to three counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception.

His scheme involved scamming a series of unlucky customers through the offer of bogus term deposits. 

The money was funneled through a sophisticated web of transactions to his girlfriend, various associates and accounts set up under fake names. 

Of the money he stole, only $400,000 ended up in his own account.  

Some of his victims considered Lee their friend.

The bank manager even invited one couple to his wedding after using false documents to sign them up to a term deposit and stealing $1.5 million.

Lee splashed his ill-gotten cash on property and business ventures including restaurant investments.

Judge Frances Hogan labelled Lee's actions morally bankrupt.

He said it was a good thing he'd been caught because he hadn't been able to see a way out of his lies.

The bank has repaid his victims.
