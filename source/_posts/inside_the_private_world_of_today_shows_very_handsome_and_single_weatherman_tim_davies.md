Today show's Tim Davies has been the envy of many after filing a series of idyllic weather reports from sun-soaked Queensland over the last two months.

And the handsome TV personality has been having the time of his life on the job, as is evident in the numerous Instagram snaps taken from places such as the Whitsundays, Burleigh Heads and Noosa.

Tim, who appears to be single, has undoubtedly proven himself the perfect fit for the gig thanks to his knack for adrenaline-based travel and wholesome family values.

Tim, who has been a journalist for 15 years, has been actively enjoying the vast amount of activities the Sunshine State has to offer.

From scuba diving and snorkelling to sky-diving, the hunk has passionately exhibited his need for speed on social media.

'Social distancing with a difference - snorkelling Australia’s BREATHTAKING Great Barrier Reef, gliding along with green sea turtles,' he captioned a recent snap of himself jumping into the ocean.

Failing to show any signs of a relationship on social media, Tim's seemingly single status also allows him to make the most of his travelling TV commitments.

While he has been making the most of his time in Queensland, the Sydney based presenter has also proven that he is very much a family man.

Tim is incredibly close to his glamorous mother, Kate, and jokingly expressed his annoyance that he was unable to cuddle her in a gushing Mother's Day post in May.

Proving he's also ready for fatherhood, Tim has frequently gushed over his adorable godchildren on social media.

It appears that Tim's stay in Queensland was extended after State closed borders to all New South Wales in a bid to slow the spread of the deadly respiratory virus.

Last month, Tim copped backlash for his easygoing and carefree weather crosses from Queensland, which also appeared to double up as promotional tourism segments.

Viewers from coronavirus-stricken Melbourne were left understandably upset after watching Tim's inviting segments from Queensland - which is closed to all visitors from Victoria, NSW and the Australian Capital Territory.
