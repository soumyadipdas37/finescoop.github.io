Chess is a musical with music by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA fame, with lyrics by Ulvaeus and Tim Rice. 

It tells the story a politically driven, Cold War–era chess tournament between an American and a Soviet Russian, and their fight over a woman. 

In black and white stills from the music video, Amanda and Sheridan, 39, look as though they are having lots of fun as they giggle while in the recording studio.

Family comes first: Amanda's youngest daughter Hollie, appears in the video 

At one point, the firm friends embrace one another as they make the most of their singing experience. 

Amanda said: 'I got a great friendship out of this song in Sheridan Smith. I’d loved her for years and we’ve always hugged when we met but we didn’t know each other. 

'I really wanted her to duet with me on I Know Him So Well so I asked David Walliams for her number. 

'She was heavily pregnant, but she couldn’t have been nicer or more enthusiastic when I called her, and the final result is better than I even imagined.'

She continued: 'This is also the first single I ever bought for my mum who loved Barbara Dickson. We had all her albums and even though I have never to this day seen Chess, this is the song I’ve always loved.'

Amanda's album, Songs From My Heart is a collection of celebrated musical theatre numbers that showcase her impeccable vocal talents.

Family has always been at the heart of Amanda’s music.

Close bond: Amanda shared this throwback snap of herself with Sheridan as she spoke about recording the song with her when she was heavily pregnant 

Never forget: The pair also shared these sweet pictures on their Instagram stories 

The idea to create an album came about after Amanda and her daughters recorded Tightrope (from The Greatest Showman) for her husband, Chris, to mark their 10th wedding anniversary in 2018.  

Her debut single from the album, Over the Rainbow hit #1 on the iTunes chart.

The song helped to raise vital funds during the Covid-19 crisis, with all proceeds being donated to NHS Charities Together.   

Amanda is no stranger to the stage and has previously received an Olivier Award nomination for her debut West End role in Thoroughly Modern Millie.
