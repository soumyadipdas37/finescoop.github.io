Champions League semi-finalists Lyon have picked up just one win in their first four Ligue 1 games after a 0-0 stalemate against Nimes.

The hosts were much fancied for the tie at theÂ Groupama Stadium but struggled to find any rhythm and managed just four shots on target in the game.

Rudi Garcia's men failed to bounce back from a dismal 2-1 defeat to Montpellier on Tuesday as they lost further ground at the top of Ligue 1 with just five points from a possible 12 to start the season.
