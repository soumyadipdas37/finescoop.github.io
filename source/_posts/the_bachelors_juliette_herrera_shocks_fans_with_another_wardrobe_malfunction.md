She's the stunning brunette stylist who has become a firm fan favourite on The Bachelor this year. 

But on Thursday, Juliette Herrera shocked some fans of the series after suffering an X-rated wardrobe malfunction during a Zoom call with Locky Gilbert.

In the scene, the 34-year-old squeezed her curves into a tiny mustard dress that was too short to protect her modesty.

Look away, Locky! Juliette Herrera shocked some fans of The Bachelor after suffering an X-rated wardrobe malfunction during a Zoom call with Locky Gilbert

Due to the positioning of her laptop camera, Juliette's black underwear was visible to both Locky and the viewers watching at home. 

The dress was also low cut, allowing Juliette's cleavage to almost spill out on camera.

'Juliette’s dress isn’t the most Zoom appropriate, although I kind of think that’s the angle she’s going for,' one fan tweeted.

'Juliette we can see up your dress and also pls mute your mic,' added another.

'And again Juliette is wearing another different low cut dress,' tweeted one, while another wrote: 'Juliette in that dress, my areolas could never.'

This isn't the first time that the brunette beauty has shocked viewers with her wardrobe choices this season.

Not the first time! Last week, Juliette turned heads in a shimmering green frock that accentuated her eye-popping assets and left very little to the imagination

Understandably, the stylist's look sent Twitter into a meltdown, with one viewer writing: 'Juliette's boobs are the only thing that deserve a rose tonight.'

'Didn't Juliette say she wasn't a dress up type of girl? A dress like that doesn't scream "I don't normally wear dresses" to me,' another fan pointed out.

Meanwhile, a third tweeted: 'Wardrobe, please find a dress for Juliette that fits,' while another added: 'Don't know where to look re Juliette's dress.'  

'On the upside Juliette's plastic surgeon is getting free advertising tonight,' another added. 

'The hero of tonight's #TheBachelorAU is the tape holding Juliette's breasts within her dress,' wrote another fashion-savvy viewer.
