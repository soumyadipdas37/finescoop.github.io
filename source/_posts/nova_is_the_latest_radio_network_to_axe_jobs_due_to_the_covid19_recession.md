Last month, Southern Cross Austereo axed 19 regional breakfast programs in response to the COVID-19 recession.

And now Nova is the latest media company to axe staff in order to stay afloat.

On Tuesday, Radio Today confirmed that the radio network had decided to cut local workdays in Brisbane and Adelaide.

This change will see Nova Brisbane hosts Katie Mattin and Jack Tree, and Nova Adelaide announcers Rosie Panetta and Jarrod Walsh depart the business or be redeployed. 

According to the publication, the announcers were notified of the news on Friday after their shifts.

In Sydney and Brisbane, Kent 'Smallzy' Small is now set to host afternoons, while Dan 'DC' Cassin will do mornings.

Adelaide and Melbourne will see Jamie Row take on mornings, while Mel Tacina will host the afternoon shift.

Meanwhile, Perth is set to remain local, with Ross Wallman tackling mornings and Katie Lamb on afternoons.

Nova's programming and marketing boss, Paul Jackson, told Radio Today the network had been forced to 'review' the business as a result of the pandemic.

'It's been a tough time for all media industries during COVID and as a result we've reviewed every aspect of our business, including programming, to ensure we continue to deliver our listeners with the best content, announcers and shows, in the most efficient way,' he said.

'As a result of this review we've looked carefully at all our Nova workday announcers and unfortunately this has resulted in some talented broadcasters being made redundant.' 

It comes the Hit Network announced last month that it was cutting 19 regional breakfast programs, leaving many communities without a local brekky team.

Restructure: Southern Cross Austereo is the latest media company to axe staff in order to stay afloat. Nineteen local breakfast programs from the Hit Network are being shut down and replaced by larger regional programs, such as Hit101.3 Central Coast's Gawndy & Ash Pollard

The affected breakfast shows will be replaced by syndicated broadcasts from larger regional stations, such as Hit101.3 Central Coast's Gawndy & Ash Pollard.

The impacted radio hosts are reportedly being redeployed where possible, but some will be leaving the network.

It is yet to be confirmed how many employees are set to leave the business.

Southern Cross Austereo's content boss, David Cameron, said at the time that the business had to 'adapt' to the COVID-19 recession. 

'SCA has adapted to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 environment and will deliver a different programming model across our Hit regional network,' he said. 

'The changes will mean that unfortunately a number of our local breakfast shows will be impacted, and we would like to thank our dedicated and talented people who are affected today by this new approach.'
