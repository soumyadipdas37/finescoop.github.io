A photo contest has exposed some of the nation's messiest bedrooms - including clothes stored on the 'floordrobe', week's worth of old pizza boxes, and too much clutter.  

BedSOS is scouring the UK to find the most offending rooms, with the competition closing on the 14th September, and the lucky winner receiving a brand new bed worth up to £400. 

Danny Richmond, Managing Director of Bed SOS, said: 'We've seen a lot in our time, but even we were shocked by the state of some of the bedrooms in the entries so far. 

'With all the extra time people have been spending at home recently, it does make sense that things will be a little more cluttered than usual, but some of these take the cake!'
