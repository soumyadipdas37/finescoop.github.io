If you're a fan of Rihanna and have very deep pockets, then this London mansion is the perfect house for you - after the singing sensation spent two and a half years calling it home. 

On the market for a staggering £32million, the eight-bedroom property - which was said to have cost the 32-year-old A-lister £18,000 a week in rent - is found in the sought-after St John's Wood neighbourhood, just moments from the renowned Abbey Studios.

The gated home comes complete with a carriage driveway with parking for up to ten cars, a gym, six bathrooms, a media room and two entire floors for entertaining as well as the stylish furniture used by Rihanna during her time in the capital.

Having since returned to the US, the singer-songwriter spent more than a year secretly living in London before casually revealing in a May 2019 interview that she had made Britain her home.

On the market for a staggering £32million, the eight-bedroom property (pictured is a living room in the house) - which was said to have cost the 32-year-old A-lister £18,000 a week in rent - is found in the sought-after St John's Wood neighbourhood, just moments from the renowned Abbey Studios

The lucky buyer of Rihanna's (pictured right) former home (pictured left) will have easy access to the shops along the Finchley Road and St John’s Wood High Street and be within close proximity of St John’s Wood Underground Station (Jubilee Line) and the open spaces of Primrose Hill and Regent’s Park

The lucky buyer of her former home will have easy access to the shops along the Finchley Road and St John’s Wood High Street and be within close proximity of St John’s Wood Underground Station (Jubilee Line) and the open spaces of Primrose Hill and Regent’s Park. 

It was originally built in 1844 by wealthy builder William Holme Twentyman (1802-1884) and designed by renowned architect John Shaw Junior (1803-1870). 

The architect, a favourite of the royals at the time, was known for his elegant classical style and the five-storey home is trademark Shaw with a pillared entrance and multi-storey bays. 

It is the only one of Twentyman and Shaw’s original villas on St John’s Wood Park which has survived into the twenty first century, since all the others along the road were either demolished or adapted. 

The first owner of the house was Daniel Francis, a diamond tycoon who was a director and shareholder of De Beers Jewellers. 

The Francis family were followed in 1901 by Robert and Doris Partridge, owners of the famous Partridge Fine Art and Antiques Shop on New Bond Street, followed in the 1930s by Arthur Mitton Dickson, the head of Anglo International Bank on Lombard Street.

With a lavish white front and a luxurious landscaped garden, the five-storey property also features under-floor heating and even a lift for guests.

Rihanna - who was dating Saudi billionaire Hassan Jameel while living at the property, before the end of their relationship in January this year - said in a previous interview that she loved living in London with the anonymity that being in a big city brings - and had been 'keeping a little incognito'.

She told the New York Times: 'I enjoy walking around the block. When I go walking, I try to keep a little incognito.' 

However, with several bathrooms and two studies to choose from and with staff, including security guards, a private chef and a housekeeper on hand, her London lifestyle - which she paid £18,000-a-week for, according to The Times - was certainly out of the ordinary. 

Rihanna fans were sent into a frenzy last year after the singer revealed she'd been living in the capital for 12 months - with some already suspecting the move after she shared a selfie, taken inside the house, which featured a Sainsbury's 'bag for life'.

The exquisite property opens out on to manicured lawns in the landscaped gardens. It has an open plan kitchen, a reception room and family room. 

The home's entertaining space has been arranged so that the informal relaxation and leisure areas are on the garden floor whilst the more formal entertaining spaces are on the raised ground level. 

On the garden floor is a double-living room arranged to provide a family room and informal dining area with two sets of French doors opening onto the outside terrace. The large fully fitted kitchen is open plan with a central island, walk-in pantry, bar and separate wine storage.

Gary Hersham, Founding Director of Beauchamp Estates, said 'This magnificent house on St John’s Wood Park is perfect for a music, business or political mogul. It is one of the most important houses to come onto the market in the local area in recent years. 

'It is an exceptional property with the garden floor and large garden superb for relaxation whilst the reception room on the raised ground floor is wonderful for big parties.'

Michael Sulkin, Director of Aston Chase, said 'This house is the only one of Royal architect John Shaw’s original villas on St John’s Wood Park to have survived into the twenty first century.  

'The property represents a rare opportunity to be close to Central London yet benefit from the clever ‘V’ shaped plot which provides a 126 ft deep by 130 ft wide rear garden, normally associated with houses much further out in the suburbs.'
