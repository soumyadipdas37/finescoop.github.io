There were plenty of goals in Saturday night's Nations League matches, as Portugal ran riot against 2018 World Cup finalists Croatia in a 4-1 victory.

Elsewhere, Belgium asserted their dominance as the world's best national side and Kylian Mbappe stole the headlines with an incredible solo goal. 

Here, recap Sportsmail's Ieuan Ivett's coverage from Denmark vs Belgium, Portugal vs Croatia and Sweden vs France.

Host commentator

Well, we weren't short of goals tonight - thanks to Portugal. They ran away with a 4-1 victory against Croatia, with Joao Felix and Diogo Jota among the scorers. 

Elsewhere, Belgium asserted their dominance as the number one ranked team in world football with a 2-0 victory over Denmark. France only needed one goal to beat Sweden, after a magnificent solo strike from Kylian Mbappe. 

Denmark 0-2 Belgium

Portugal 4-1 Croatia

Sweden 0-1 France

Portugal add a FOURTH in injury time!

Croatia do get a consolation!  bruno Petkovic scores for the visitors in the 91st minute. It has no effect on the final outcome.

Croatia almost grasp a consolation through Marcelo Brozovic, who volleys the ball goal wards from the edge of the box but it goes just wide. He had Anthony Lopes beaten.

With just under ten minutes to go, France still just have a one-goal lead against Sweden. Elsewhere, Portugal are home and dry against Croatia and lead 3-0, while Belgium are cruising with a two-goal advantage against Denmark.

Dries Mertens pounces ob the ball inside the box to side foot the ball into the back of the net. Romelu Lukaku was fouled inside the box but the referee allowed play to continue, much to the delight of the Napoli forward. 2-0, game over.

Romelu Lukaku shows his pace, power and skill as he gets on the ball, does a step over and tries his luck from outside the box. He forces a save and wins a corner.

Joao Felix joins in on the act and add a third for Portugal as they run riot at home against 2018 World Cup runners up Croatia. His goal is the pick of the bunch, as he lashed the ball from outside the box.

Sebastian Larsson does well to control the ball, turn and unleash a shot towards the France goal. However, it sails wide. The visitors need a second for that two-goal cushion.

Wolves attacker Diogo Jota adds a second for Portugal as they take control on home soil. Raphael Guerreiro should get credit for the assist

Lucas Digne sent in a wonderful cross that was met by Olivier Giroud. However, the striker's header goes just wide of the right post. France are pushing for a second.

Yannick Carrasco now has a go for Belgium as he carries the ball into the box but his powerful effort goes slightly high and wide.

Belgium have started the second half on the front foot. Dries Mertens curled a cross to the back post which forced a corner from the Denmark defence. Then, Thorgan Hazard tried his effort from range but it went wide.

We are now entering the second period in the Nations League tonight, with each featured match seeing one goal scored in the first half.

Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe looked delighted as he gave France the lead just before the half-time whistle. 

He took on two defenders inside the box, and then squeezed his effort past Olsen from a very tight angle. A world class player doing world class things.

Denmark 0-1 Belgium

Portugal 1-0 Croatia

Sweden 0-1 France

France score and who else, but Kylian Mbappe? The PSG star finished off a wonderful solo goal as he places the ball past the helpless Robin Olsen after a great moment of brilliance. 1-0.

Manchester City right-back Joao Cancelo has given Portugal the lead! Hard to say they don't deserve to be ahead, as they have already registered 16 shots.

Marcus Berg tries to place the ball past Hugo Lloris in the France goal, who pulls off a spectacular save to keep the scoreline at 0-0.

Big chance for Portugal! Borussia Dortmund star Raphael Guerreiro surprised the goalkeeper with a quickfire attempt from the edge of the box but it smashes against the post!

After a fast-paced counter attack from Belgium, Yannick Carrasco finds Castagne inside the box but his finish goes high.

Inter Milan midfielder Christian Eriksen fired a bullet of a strike towards the Belgium goal and forced an outstretching save. Wonderful effort from Eriksen.

The visitors are asserting their dominance against the Danes as we head past the half-way mark in the first 45 minutes. They are controlling the possession and are playing keep-ball all over the pitch. 

Sweden missed a golden opportunity to take a shock lead against the French. Mikael Lustig surprised everyone, including Hugo Lloris in goal, as he fired an effort towards the top left corner but it goes just inches wide. Warning signs for France.

Portugal seem to be dealing without their star talisman Cristiano Ronaldo well for now. Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes tried his luck from range, but could not test Dominik Livakovic in goal. 

A chance also fell to Joao Felix, who could not wiggle his way past the defenders inside the box.

Goal for Belgium! Jason Denayer gets the better of his man from a corner and slots the ball past Kasper Schmeichel in the Danish goal. 

Moments before, the Leicester goalkeeper was called into action after Yannick Carrasco curled a long-range free-kick goalwards but he tipped it onto the bar.

France centre-back and Manchester United target Dayot Upamecano has been put into the book against Sweden, as has Pierre-Emile Hojberg against Belgium.

And we are underway as Belgium face Denmark, Portugal play Croatia and Sweden host France.

In front of empty stadiums, the players are singing their anthems ahead of kick-off.

The warm-ups are completed and the teams are just moments away from coming out the tunnel and beginning their Nations League journey.

There is no doubting that World Champions France are favourites to win tonight and among the top-tipped to win the Nations League and next summer’s Euros. They bring a strong run of six wins from seven into their tournament opener, with many of their world-class stars available for Didier Deschamps.

Sweden have a tough group stage ahead of them, with Portugal and Croatia making up the other places in the group. However, they will use the tough fixtures as preparations for next summer’s Euros and have always presented a strong, well-drilled side in past performances.

Roberto Martinez’ side were incredibly unfortunate to miss out on the Nations League semi-finals back in 2018/19, so will make sure not even goal difference can stand in their way this time. They are a formidable outfit, having won all ten of their Euro 2020 qualifiers before the pandemic.

However, this will not be an easy evening for Belgium, as Denmark are unbeaten in their last 15 competitive matches. Their record against the Red Devils does not make for fantastic reading, having lost six of their last 13 encounters.

Portugal XI: Lopes, Cancelo, Pepe, Dias, Guerreiro, Moutinho, Pereira, Fernandes, Jota, Felix, Silva.

Croatia XI: Livakovic, Jedvaj, Lovren, Vida, Barisic, Pasalic, Kovacic, Brekalo, Vlasic, Rebic, Kramaric.

Denmark XI: Schmeichel, Skov, Kjær, Christensen, Wass, Delaney, Højbjerg, Braithwaite, Poulsen, Dolberg.

Belgium XI: Mignolet, Castagne, Alderweireld, Denayer, Vertonghen, Tielemens, Witsel, Carrasco, Mertens, Lukaku, Hazard.

Sweden XI: Olsen, Bengtsson, Berg, Ekdal, Forsberg, Jansson, Larsson, Lindelof, Lustig, Olsson, Quaison.

France XI: Lloris, Upamecano, Varane, Kimpembe, Dubois, Kante, Rabiot, Digne, Griezmann, Giroud, Mbappe.
