Jamie Carragher believes the incessant demands for Liverpool to sign Thiago Alcantara pays a disservice to the members of the club's current midfield.

The Bayern Munich star has been heavily linked with a move to Anfield and Reds boss Jurgen Klopp refused to rule out a move for the Spain international ahead of the champions' thrilling 4-3 victory against Leeds in their Premier League opener.

Reports in Germany claim the 29-year-old has agreed terms with Liverpool and is desperate for a move, but Carragher maintains even if Thiago does not sign for them this summer, the club still have a 'fantastic' midfield at their disposal.

Carragher believes the clamour for the Bayern Munich star is disrespectful to the midfield

'I think the huge clamour for Thiago is a little bit disrespectful to Liverpool's current midfield three,' Carragher told Sky Sports on Saturday. 

'Yes he would add something different, no doubt. But if he doesn't come in, it's not the end of the world, this is still a fantastic midfield for Liverpool.'

Georginio Wijnaldum has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona in a move which could free up funds to help Liverpool land Thiago.

And former Reds centre-back Carragher appeared to confirm that the club need to sell before they can buy, as was the case when the club splashed out heavily on Virgil Van Dijk and Alisson after selling Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona for £142m a couple of years ago.

'Liverpool have got three or four players in the squad they are looking to move on,' Carragher added.

'It seems like they have to sell before they buy, that was the case with Dejan Lovren. He had to leave before a left-back [new signing Kostas Tsimikas] could come in. 

'Liverpool lost their best player [Coutinho] to bring Van Dijk in and the goalkeeper. There's no point buying for the sake of it, but I do feel they need someone to supplement the front three.'
