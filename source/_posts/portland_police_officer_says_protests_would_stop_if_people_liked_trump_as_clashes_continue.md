An armed police officer in Portland has said the violent protests could stop immediately if 'people liked our Trump government a lot more'.

The Oregon city has been gripped by unrest for months since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, although it has been a hotbed of anti-police sentiment for some time.

On Monday night, BLM protesters marched on a police union office as clashes continued on the 124th night of demonstrations, leaving one sergeant hospitalised after being punched in the face and five cops sprayed with a chemical irritant.

In footage taken during the latest night of protesting a woman confronted armed officers and asked how the unrest can come to an end.

One officer says: 'So you're asking how do we end it? It's got to be citizen and political will.'

The local resident replies: 'Is there a way we can take you guys out of having to be in this position?' 

Another police officer replies: 'If they were not out here, we would not be out here.

'If our people liked our Trump government a lot more, we probably wouldn't have this issue in the first place.'

A number of armed officers changed tactics and descended on a group of protesters before they had even started to march on Monday night

The first officer adds: 'We know this is going to run all the way to the election and all the way to inauguration.'

But the woman replies: 'Well it could run all the way until cops stop killing black people, but maybe you haven't.'

An officer responds: 'When's the last time in Portland?'

Many online have criticised the police officer's remarks about Trump, saying he does not understand that people are protesting police brutality and racism, rather than the Government.

Others have also pointed out how black people have been controversially killed by police in Portland in recent years, including Kendra James in 2003, Aaron Campbell in 2010 and Quanice Hayes in 2017, none of which were prosecuted.

Portland cop Capt. Mark Kruger kept his job after erecting public tributes to five Nazi-era German soldiers at a city park.

The latest confrontation came on the latest night of violence in Portland as BLM protesters and police clashed again.

A number of armed officers changed tactics and descended on a group of protesters before they had even started to march.

Police confiscated shields, used pepper spray and controversially tried to take a picket sign which read 'Vote'. 

The new tactic caught protesters off guard, causing them to splinter and delaying their march to the police union office.

But the activists soon regrouped and continued their march after police declared it an unlawful assembly and made 24 arrests.

They claim many protesters were posing as members of the press but were carrying weapons including knives and pepper spray. 

Police admitted using tear gas even though it has been banned for use by Portland Police, saying state law still allows it to be used in certain situations.

On Twitter, Portland Police said: 'There is a gathering in Kenton Park and learned that it was the initiation point of a planned unpermitted march. 

'Participants were seen wearing body armor and helmets. Officers observed shields and moved in to take them for safekeeping before they could be used.'

It comes after an anxious weekend in Portland after the far-right Proud Boys rally took place.

About 1,000 people gathered at the Proud Boys rally in Delta Park on Saturday, while a group of 500 left-wing counter-protesters massed at nearby Peninsula Park, leading to fears of clashes.

Ahead of the right-wing rally, which organizers said was to support President Donald Trump and 'to end domestic terrorism', Oregon Governor Kate Brown declared a state of emergency and Mayor Ted Wheeler said it poses the 'greatest threat we've faced so far' amid fears of clashes with left-wing protesters.
