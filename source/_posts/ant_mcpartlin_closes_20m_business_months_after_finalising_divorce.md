Ant McPartlin has closed his £20m TV business after finalising his divorce settlement with ex-wife Lisa Armstrong.

The TV presenter, 44, did have company Teecourt Limited which was used to pay his share of earnings for his television commitments with on-screen partner Dec.

However new documents filed with Companies House show that Ant has now had it struck from the register.

Records previously showed that Teecourt Limited retained earnings of £20 million, including £9 million in cash and £11 million in investments.  

The closing paper work is also thought to show that any remaining cash and assets have been stripped from the company.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Ant to ask for a comment.  

It comes after Ant and Lisa were granted a decree absolute in April 2020, which formally ended their 12-year marriage and 23-year relationship.

Moving on: The end of the business comes after Ant divorced his ex-wife Lisa Armstrong (pictured together in May 2017)

It was reported that TV host Ant handed over £31 million to Lisa in their settlement, including their £5million home in West London, after an 'eight-hour negotiation'.

The beauty expert was said to have been the 'peacemaker' during a the lengthy discussions about her divorce from the TV star, claimed The Sun. 

The publication first alleged the TV veteran offered up more than half of his estimated £50m fortune, but was 'delighted' that the case has come to an end as he can 'move on', two years after announcing their split.

However, as the news broke, the former Deuce musician took to Twitter to deny the reports, posting: 'Nope a load of nonsense AGAIN....' 

Since splitting from his ex-wife in 2018, Ant has splashed £6m on a seven-bedroom mansion complete with vaulted roof and media room for him and girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett in West London.

Teecourt Limited made £3m in the year to June 2018, reports The Sun. This time period covers the first part of his presenting break after his drink-drive arrest. 

Despite having some time off in this period, Ant and Dec were recently reported to have cashed in at least £15,124 a day last year after making an epic return to the small screen together.

According to records, the hefty sum was paid into just one of their firms, Hurley Promotions Ltd, with the company's profits increasing from £4.5 million to £5.5 million between 2018 and 2019.  

The iconic hosting duo joined forces at the Britain's Got Talent auditions for the first time in January 2019 following nearly a year off from working on TV together. 

Ant's personal issues saw him sit out the last few episodes of BGT, as well as Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, in spring 2018.

Cashing in: It comes following reports Ant and Dec cashed in at least £15,124 a day last year after making an epic return to the small screen together 

As Geordie presenter Dec was forced to front the latter episodes of their famous shows alone, as well as I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! with Holly Willoughby, he made £5,289,051 from June 2018 to June 2019.

According to The Sun, more than £4 million came through his company Deecourt Limited, while the remaining profit was paid into firms he co-owns with Ant.    

Ant first sought rehab treatment in June 2017 after becoming addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol following a botched knee surgery in 2015. 

He entered rehab for a second time in March 2018 after he was involved in a three-car collision in Richmond and was discovered to be over the limit behind the wheel.

The TV veteran pleaded guilty to drink-driving the following month and he received a record-breaking £86,000 fine, as well as a 20-month ban from driving.   

Ant and Dec, who have been presenting together since 1994, are estimated to be worth a whopping £62 million.
