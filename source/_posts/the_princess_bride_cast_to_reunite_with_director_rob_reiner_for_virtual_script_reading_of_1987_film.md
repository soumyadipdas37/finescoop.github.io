Wisconsin will be one of several key states that will likely play a key role in the presidential election in November. In fact the Badger State is one of three traditionally blue battleground states that Donald Trump flipped in the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.

Both President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden recently paid visits to Kenosha, Wisconsin this past week in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake and subsequent protests and cvil unrest. 

'I think most people are aware by now that Donald Trump has completely abdicated his duties as President to represent and stand up for all Americans,' Elwes said In a statement released through the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.

'He has failed to keep the country safe from COVID-19 and as a result he is responsible for the devastating chaos, violence and economic collapse that we are now experiencing.'

Reunion: Wallace Shawn and Mandy Patinkin are also taking part in event that's a fundraiser for the Democratic Party Of Wisconsin; the two actors are pictured with their late co-star Andre The Giant, who passed away in January 1993 at the age of 46

Reunion: Director Rob Reiner will also be taking part in the virtual reunion and Patton Oswalt will moderate a Q&A session afterwards

Elwes, 57, added, 'If America is going to have a real chance at healing we must get rid of Trump. And that is only possible if we win Wisconsin. I am thrilled to be part of this very rare reunion of my colleagues from The Princess Bride as a way to increase awareness and garner resources for the state that will determine the fate of America.'

Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, made a correlation between the fantasy adventure film and the upcoming election to hammer home his take on the campaigns.

'The 2020 election is just like The Princess Bride: giants, monsters, chases, escapes, miracles. We're thrilled that some of the world's greatest stars are joining us to relive the magic of my favorite movie in the world and help us safely navigate the fire swamp of Wisconsin politics,' Wikler said.

The Princess Bride was adapted William Goldman from his 1973 novel of the same name.

It tells the story of a farmhand named Westley (Elwes), who's accompanied by companions he's befriended along his journey, who must rescue his true love Princess Buttercup (Wright) from the odious Prince Humperdinck (Sarandon). 

The film essentially preserves the novel's narrative style by presenting the story as a book being read by a grandfather (Peter Falk) to his sick grandson (Fred Savage).   

On Friday, Elwes teased the virtual script-reading event on Twitter that will be held on Sunday, September 13, at at 4 PM PT.
