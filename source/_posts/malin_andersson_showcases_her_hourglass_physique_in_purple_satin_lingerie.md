Malin Andersson looked incredible as she slipped into plunging purple satin lingerie for a slew of sizzling Instagram snaps on Thursday.  

The former Love Island star, 27, put on a defiant display as she told fans she had 'finally realised my worth' after having her 'confidence stripped'.

The caption appeared to refer to her ex Tom Kemp, who was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court on September 3 after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.

Posing next to a potted plant, Malin showed off her hourglass figure in the busty bra and matching thong. 

The reality star wrote: 'I've got a smile on my face because I've finally realised my worth and no one can ever strip me of my confidence ever again.

'As always wearing @bouxavenue empowering my curves in their new AW20 collection.'

It comes after Malin recently shared lingerie snaps on her Instagram along with a post about body confidence. 

The mental health campaigner penned: 'EMPOWERING EVERY CURVE I HAVE! Our bodies are here to be loved, not hated on.

'Embrace every single inch - do it for yourself not them. Proud to be part of Boux Avenue AW20 campaign spreading the message of self-love and empowerment.'

The reality star's ex Tom Kemp was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court on September 3 after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade. 

He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.

The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in Instagram posts last year.

But Kemp, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.

Malin and Kemp had an on-off romance, splitting briefly during her pregnancy, amid claims he had been unfaithful to her, but reconciling shortly before the birth.

Their baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019. 

They split again last March, with Malin admitting it was better to end things between them as she and her partner struggled with their grief.

Malin now wrestles with PTSD, after the abusive relationship left her mental health and self-esteem in tatters.

She told The Sun: 'You just feel helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, depression, anxiety. The emotional abuse stays with you a lot longer than the physical. It takes a long, long time to heal.'
