Danny Clayton stepped out for a stroll in Bondi on Friday and he was in good company. 

The 34-year-old TV star walked along cheerfully with actress Charlotte Best, 26, who is known for her role as Annie Campbell on Home and Away. 

Danny looked casually chic, wearing a vintage hoodie in a grey tone, with a 1985 camping logo on the front.  

Out and about: Danny Clayton stepped out for a stroll in Bondi on Friday and he was in good company. The 34-year-old TV star walked along cheerfully with actress Charlotte Best, 26, who is known for her role as Annie Campbell on Home and Away. Both pictured 

He added a pair of pale, camel-coloured pants in a slim fit, and he walked along with his hands in his pockets. 

A pair of black and white sneakers completed the comfortable but fashionable ensemble.  

Danny's hair was styled in classic quarantine fashion, in a tousled and perhaps outgrown coif. 

Casual: Danny looked casually chic, wearing a vintage hoodie in a grey tone, with a 1985 camping logo on the front, and tan coloured pants. Charlotte meanwhile opted for a pair of retro-fit, wide-legged blue jeans with a high waist and a cropped black jumper

Charlotte meanwhile opted for a pair of retro-fit, wide-legged blue jeans with a high waist. 

She added a cropped black jumper with long sleeves, adding to the throwback quality of the look. 

The An American In Texas actress wore a pair of crisp, white sneakers and carried a red shoulder bag. 

Mates: The pals, who are currently both believed to be single, chatted happily as they strolled down the road together in the trendy Sydney suburb

Charlotte appeared to go makeup free, her naturally gorgeous face on display, and had her long, brunette hair down around her shoulders. 

She completed her ensemble with a number of rings and dainty earrings, as well as a spiral hair band around her wrist. 

The pals, who are currently both believed to be single, chatted happily as they strolled down the road together in the trendy Sydney suburb. 

 That's a change! DJ and TV star Danny often sports a dressier look
