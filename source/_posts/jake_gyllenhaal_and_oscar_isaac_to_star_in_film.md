Jake Gyllenhaal and Oscar Isaac have joined the cast of Francis And The Godfather, a movie about the making of the iconic 1972 mobster film.

Gyllenhaal, 39, will be playing producer Robert Evans, while Oscar, 41, is set to portray legendary filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, according to Deadline.

Barry Levinson, who has previously helmed Rain Man and Good Morning, Vietnam, will be directing the film.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, the film is based on the Mario Puzo novel of the same name and follows the son of a mob boss and his initial efforts to resist joining the family business - before embracing it.

The Godfather received widespread acclaim, and was awarded with an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor for Marlon Brandon, and Best Adapted Screenplay.

While there was plenty of drama on screen, there was also no shortage of it behind-the-scenes.  

The original Puzo script was set in Kansas City, but a then-31-year-old Coppola had to persuade producer Evans to film the movie in the more expensive city of New York, according to Deadline.

Even the time period the movie was set in was problematic. 

Coppola butt heads with the studio over the decision to place The Godfather in the 1940s, with the studio keen on saving money by setting it in the 1970s.   

'I mean, the script had hippies in it because it was being a - going to be set in the '70s,' he previously told NPR. 'And they wanted to shoot it in Kansas City. In fact, they took me on a trip to look around at Italian neighborhoods in Kansas City.'

The disagreements spilled over into casting, with the decision to bring Marlon and Al Pacino on board also contentious. 

It was an uphill battle casting Marlon, who stuffed cotton balls in his mouth to achieve Vito's rough voice during his screen test, according to Market Watch.

Additionally, 'uneasy' discussions occurred with real-life mob bosses, unhappy knowing their antics would be making it to the big screen. 

Stories about the behind-the-scenes drama have been circulating for years, but now it will all be coming to the big screen, with the film set to center on the director and studio chief desperate for a hit, according to Deadline.

Already, Coppola has given his seal of approval on the decision to bring Levinson on board.

'Any movie that Barry Levinson makes about anything, will be interesting and worthwhile!' he said, according to Deadline.
