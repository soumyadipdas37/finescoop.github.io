A felon has admitted that his girlfriend who visited him in prison every weekend for the past five years is 'borderline obsessive,' and he's worried about what their relationship will be like now that he is out of prison. 

Dylan, 30, from Chicago, Illinois, finally reunites with his girlfriend Heather on Friday night's episode of the We TV reality series Love After Lockup, and while the two can't keep their hands off each other, he is concerned she is a little too committed to him.

'Heather and I, we haven't spent that much time together before I had gotten locked up. Minimal interaction,' he explains in a preview clip from the episode. 

At last: Dylan, 30, from Chicago, Illinois, finally reunites with his girlfriend Heather on Friday night's episode of the We TV reality series Love After Lockup

Reunion: Heather can't keep her hands of Dylan, who spent the past five years behind bars 

Dylan met Heather at a party at his apartment just a few weeks before he got caught selling 100 pills of ecstasy to an undercover cop and was sentenced to five years in prison.  

'I've always been an entrepreneurial individual. When I was 18, I was modeling and in the clubs and I started selling drugs,' he explains in his testimonial. I've been arrested for at least 34 times, and I did five years on this one. 

'I've never really added it up like that,' he admits. 'It's crazy.' 

Dylan's shocking arrest record didn't deter Heather from pursuing a relationship with the man she said made her feel like a 'goddess' when he was behind bars. 

The two never even had sex before he was locked up, but she faithfully stuck by his side for his entire sentence. She even went out of her way to prove her devotion to him — and scared him a bit in the process. 

Missed connection: Heather and Dylan have never had sex because he was arrested just a few weeks after they had met 

Trouble: Dylan was arrested for selling ecstasy to an undercover cop and was sentenced to five years in prison. Heather visited him every weekend of his sentence

Surprise! Dylan has been arrested at least 34 times since he started selling drugs at age 18

'After a few weeks, she came to come visit me, and she had my name tattooed on her. "I'm always yours Dylan" on her stomach, and then my name in Chinese on the back of her thighs. My name in Arabic on her collarbone,' he recalls. 

'That's a commitment. You know, that's a forever thing right there and borderline obsessive. So I'm a little worried what the chemistry is gonna be like and how things are gonna work now that we're face to face 24 hours a day.' 

In the preview clip, the couple looks like they're about to tear each other's clothes off in the parking lot outside of the prison. 

'It feels surreal coming home. I can't even believe that I am outside these gates right now,' he says. 'You know, I thought there'd be some metal gates clanking and it'd be a scary process coming out. 

Committed? Shortly after his arrest, Heather shocked him when she revealed she had gotten his name tattooed all over her body 

Stunned: In his testimonial, Dylan admits they had 'minimal interaction' before he went to jail, and he thought the tattoos were 'borderline obsessive'

'You're leaving from [being] around a bunch of killers, but you know what? There's a beautiful sunny day. I got my beautiful girl coming to pick me up, and we got a beautiful life ahead of us.' 

Heather can't stop kissing him, and at one point, she pushes her backside into him saying: 'Touch my a**.' 

She tells him she has sex toys in the back of her trunk, and she encourages him to change outside.

Heather tries to excite Dylan even further by telling him they can role play later on, with him being a 'naughty prisoner' who doesn't want to go back to jail.

'Got some handcuffs?' he asks. 'Yeah,' she replies. 

Despite his reservations about their relationship, he is clearly excited to see her when he is released from prison 

Excited: The couple looks like they are ready to have sex in the parking lot

Change of heart? 'I don't know if I could have made it through this without her,' he tells the camera during their happy reunion 

Heather goes wild when he takes off his shirt, and she starts spraying his body with the cologne she bought him. She can't resist licking his chest before he finishes changing.  

'We've had in-person visits but, I mean, we sit across from each other. That's the first time I've ever touched her a**,' he notes. 'I've just seen it in pictures before.'

In his testimonial, he is admittedly wary of their relationship, but he never gives his girlfriend any reason for alarm during their reunion.   

'Heather's been amazing. One of the things that guys struggle with the most going through this experience is that they have a lot of instability on the outside,' he explains. 

'Heather's been there for me. She's been reliable. She's come to see me every week since I've been here, when I was seven hours away. I don't know if I could have made it through this without her.'
