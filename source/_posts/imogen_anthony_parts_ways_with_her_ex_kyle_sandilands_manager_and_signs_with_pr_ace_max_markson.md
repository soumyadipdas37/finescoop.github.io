She is hoping to shed her title as 'Kyle Sandilands' ex-girlfriend' to become a bonafide star in her own right.

And Imogen Anthony has now made a bold move in her quest for stardom by officially parting ways with the radio host's manager, Bruno Bouchet, and signing with one of Australia's most high-profile PR and talent agents, Max Markson.

The Instagram model, 29, has enthused that she is 'looking forward to working with Max and furthering her career in the fashion and film industry as well as increasing her work with animals.'

Imogen's impressive career move was announced by Max Markson's Instagram account, who detailed their excitement at signing the 'muse, enigma and chameleon'.

The social media stunner added in her statement that she was already hard at work with a 'movie coming up' as well as the release of her fashion capsule collection in 2021.

Max himself gushed over Imogen as he revealed that he had known her for a decade and 'knows she has so much to give to the world'.

'Her love of animals and her passion for fashion are inspirational. The 180 acre Rescue Farm in the Southern Highlands has over 100 animals including a camel! Imogen is an amazing person,' he said.

'There are lots of opportunities for her and for leading brands to work with her on exciting projects,' he added.

While Imogen's former manager Bruno will not be representing her on professional endeavours anymore, he will continue to handle her private business affairs.

Imogen was introduced to Bruno via her 49-year-old ex Kyle, who she split from in November last year. 

Kyle is now dating his former personal assistant, Tegan Kynaston.

Imogen's exciting professional news comes after a report revealed she has been eyeing up a career as an actress.

The Daily Telegraph claimed that Imogen 'has found a fresh passion for acting over recent months' and is exploring her 'options'.

'Imogen is a creative. She is driven by creating art and expressing herself in many different forms. Animals, acting and fashion are just a few of her great loves,' a friend of the star told The Daily Telegraph.

Imogen already has some acting experience under her belt, having briefly appeared in Fat Pizza vs Housos back in 2014.

She had a cameo in the film alongside her then-boyfriend Kyle, with the former couple playing drunken bogans who end up in a fight.

At the time though, the focus was on Kyle's performance, with the film's director Paul Fenech telling The Sydney Morning Herald in November 2014 that the radio shock jock could have a career in comedy.

'He has a lot of potential for comedy acting. He's really easy to work with, unlike many others,' he said at the time.

But in a surefire sign that Imogen is the one looking for acting opportunities, she has a profile on casting website StarNow.

In her bio, Imogen lists her talents as: 'Actor, Extra, Model, Other Film & Stage Crew'.

Her other skills include: 'Photographer, Dancer, Makeup Artist, Fashion Stylist, TV Presenter, Radio Presenter'.
