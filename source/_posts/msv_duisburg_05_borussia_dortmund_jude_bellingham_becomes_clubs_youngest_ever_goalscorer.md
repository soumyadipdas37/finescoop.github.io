Jude Bellingham scored on his competitive debut as Borussia Dortmund started the season with a comfortable 5-0 victory over MSV Duisburg in the DFB-Pokal first round.

Fellow Englishman Jadon Sancho put Dortmund ahead from the spot after 14 minutes against the German third division side before Bellingham became Dortmund's youngest ever scorer with a tidy finish. 

The hosts were reduced to ten men on 38 minutes as Dominic Volkmer was sent his marching orders and their misery was compounded when Thorgan Hazard netted from the resulting free-kick. Giovanni Reyna and Marco Reus added to the scoreline in the second half.
