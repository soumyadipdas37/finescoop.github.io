Erin Andrews praised her fellow former host of Dancing With The Stars on Thursday during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live.

The 42-year-old TV personality was asked by a viewer for her thoughts on new host Tyra Banks, 46, saying it would be a challenge to step into her shoes as the new host of the ABC dancing competition show.

'That's better than her saying, ''Eh, it's going to be easy taking over for this broad'',' quipped Erin who was replaced along with longtime host Tom Bergeron, 65.

She added: 'I think Tom's shoes are a little harder to fill. He's the guy, he was the quarterback of the ballroom. So, that was nice of her, but he's the man, he was the man on that show'.

Erin competed on season 10 of DWTS and finished in third place with pro partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy, 40.

She took over as DWTS co-host in 2014 on season 18 replacing Brooke Burke-Charvet, 49, who co-hosted from 2010 to 2013.

Tom had been hosting DWTS since June 2005.

He revealed in July on Twitter that he would not be returning for the upcoming 29th season of the show.

Erin earlier this month revealed that she was fired with a 'surprise' phone call.

'It was a surprise,' Erin told Extra. 'I got a phone call and I answered the phone. I was like, 'This isn't good.''

The host: Andy Cohen welcomed Erin onto the Bravo talk show

She also was supportive of DWTS hiring former pro dancer Derek Hough, 35, as a new judge in place of Len Goodman, 76.

'I think it's a good move by the show to bring back somebody that everybody loves,' Erin said.

Erin will get back to work Sunday as a sideline reporter for Fox NFL.
