The father of a 13-year-old girl has issued a desperate plea for her to come home after she vanished while visiting a boy she met online. 

Steven Pickford took his daughter, Gabbriela Pickford, to her mother's house in Kuraby, in Brisbane's south, on August 28 before she snuck out in the dead of night.  

Mr Pickford said Gabbriela's mother had seen social media messages between her daughter and a 17-year-old Logan boy. 

'She’s met a stranger off Instagram,' he told news.com.au.

'They don't know this guy, they can't find where she is.'

Mr Pickford said Gabbriela left her mother's house at about 10pm without money or her phone, shortly after downloading Instagram on her sibling's iPad. 

The family hasn't heard from the 13-year-old since Friday and she didn't show up for class at Runcorn State High School on Monday or Tuesday.  

'Come home, just come home. Where are you? Come home,' Mr Pickford pleaded. 

He said his daughter had never spent more than a night away from home by herself and it was out of character for her not to contact the family.   

Queensland Police have also put out an alert for information on Gabbriela's whereabouts. 

If you have any information, you can contact Policelink 24 on 131 444.
