The Borgias' Francois Arnaud has come out as bisexual.

The actor, 35, took to Instagram to speak candidly about his sexuality on Sunday, as he said he wanted to combat stigma and stop 'letting other people's assumptions of straightness stand uncorrected.'

Of his reasoning, he explained: 'Last week, I was chatting with work friends, and as I brought up a trip I'd taken with an ex-girlfriend, I asked myself —for the ten-thousandth time— how to tell such a story without making it seem like that was the whole story of me.

Honest: The Borgias' Francois Arnaud (pictured in 2018) came out as bisexual on Sunday via Instagram, as he said it's important to discuss his sexuality to combat stigma

'I'm sure many bisexual guys feel the same and end up doing as I did: letting other people's assumptions of straightness stand uncorrected. 

'Perhaps out of fear of oversharing. Under the guise of privacy, maybe. Probably because 'masculinity' is a most fragile currency, ready to nose-dive at the first sign of vulnerability or difference. 

'And because it's really f***ing scary to give up your privilege. Without a doubt because stigmas of indecisiveness, infidelity, deception and trendiness are still clinging to bisexuality.'

Claim to fame: Francois rose to fame as Cesare Borgia in the racy period drama, which ran from 2011 to 2013 and also starred Jeremy Irons

Thoughts: Francois said, 'I'm sure many bisexual guys feel the same and end up doing as I did: letting other people's assumptions of straightness stand uncorrected'

Time to change: Admitting he no longer wanted to stay silent, he said: 'But here's the thing. Silence has the perverse effect of perpetuating those stereotypes, making bi guys invisible'

Admitting he no longer wanted to stay silent, Francois went on: 'But here's the thing. Silence has the perverse effect of perpetuating those stereotypes, making bi guys invisible, and leading people to doubt that we even exist. 

'No wonder it's still a chore to acknowledge bisexuality without getting into lengthy explanations. So yes, labels are frustrating and words, imperfect. 

'But I've always considered myself bisexual. Not confused or trying to look edgy. Not disloyal. Not ashamed. Not invisible. Happy #bivisibilityday this Wednesday.'

Candid: He said he understood it's 'scary' to come out as 'stigmas of indecisiveness, infidelity, deception and trendiness are still clinging to bisexuality', but he wanted to change that

Francois rose to fame as Cesare Borgia in the racy period drama, which ran from 2011 to 2013 and also starred Jeremy Irons as Rodrigo Borgia, who became Pop Alexander VI.

The Canadian star has since starred in Midnight, Texas as Manfred Bernardo, while he made his debut in Xavier Dolan's I Killed My Mother.

Francois has previously been in relationships with Holliday Grainger, who also starred in The Borgias, from 2011 to 2012, he went on to date Evelyne Brochu for two years, and he also dated Sarah Gadon briefly in 2014.
