Miranda Lambert, Luke Combs and Maren Morris lead the pack for the Country Music Awards nominations which were announced on Tuesday morning. 

Luke Combs and Carly Pearce shared the news on Good Morning America with Ingrid Andress and Gabby Barrett listing off more names on YouTube and Facebook livestream.   

Lambert has the most nominations with seven, Combs has six and Morris got five.

Good girl! Miranda Lambert (pictured in 2019), Luke Combs and Maren Morris lead the pack for the Country Music Awards nominations which were announced on Tuesday morning

Also noteworthy is Justin Bieber landed his very first CMA nod for his song 10,000 Hours with duo Dan + Shay. 

That tune was noticed in the single of the year, musical event of the year and music video of the year categories. 

Justin's wife Hailey Bieber was featured prominently in the gushy video. 

Happy man: Luke Combs, seen with Nicole Hocking in 2018, has the second most nods

A good year for her: Morris has come in third place with a total of five nominations

And this year was the first time in 10 years that two women have been nominated in the entertainer of the year category.

Those ladies are Lambert and Carrie Underwood. 

Usually that category has mostly men in it.

New to it all: Also noteworthy is Justin Bieber landed his very first CMA nod for his song 10,000 Hours with duo Dan + Shay. Justin's wife Hailey Bieber was featured prominently in the gushy video; seen on Monday

The last time two women were nominated in that group was when Lambert and Lady A were listed in 2010.

The Female Vocalists of the Year are an impressive collection of talent: Lambert, Ashley McBryde, Morris, Kacey Musgraves and Underwood. 

In the Male category are Eric Church, Combs, Thomas Rhett, Chris Stapleton and Keith Urban. 

The 54th Annual CMA Awards will air on ABC. The air date has yet to be announced.
