The Block's Sarah and George Bragias recently spoke of the financial hardships they faced after losing their jobs to compete on the Channel Nine reality show.

And on Tuesday's episode, the Sydney-based couple suffered even more heartbreak as Sarah revealed she wasn't going to travel to attend her grandmother's funeral.

'I had to make the decision of not attending my grandmother's funeral,' the 27-year-old explained in a piece to the camera.

'We were supposed to go to Sydney, but due to the world and coronavirus we actually chose to stay in Melbourne.'

'We had to take into consideration the fact that we're going to a funeral where there will be old people,' she added.

Sarah explained that she and her long-time partner George didn't want to put her loved ones at risk or potentially put her work site at risk.

George went on to reveal the couple have instead decided to take a few days off filming to mourn to celebrate Sarah's grandmother's life.

Last week, Sarah revealed her mother had called her husband, George, and she 'could tell in his face something was wrong'.

'I got on the phone to my mum and straight away, I knew something was up,' she tearfully recounted.

Last thing: During last week's episode, Sarah confessed the possibility of her grandmother dying had been the furthest thing from her mind

Unable to continue speaking, George, 33, stepped in and added: 'Sarah's grandmother passed away, so yeah, it wasn't good.'

After taking a moment to regain her composure, Sarah confessed the possibility of her grandmother dying had been the furthest thing from her mind.

'When you're on The Block, you just don't think those things happen. You think that the world stops with you, but it doesn't,' she cried. 

It's the second death on the show in as many weeks, following the death of Daniel's grandfather just a week earlier.
