Second wife: Alec, 62, married Hilaria in 2012. He was previously wed to Hollywood star Kim Basinger from 1993 to 2002

This comes after she had a false labor alarm in late August.

She posted a selfie to her Instagram Story and explained: 'I've had a million kids but drove 3 hours to the dr today because I thought maybe I was in labor. You'd think I'd know by now.'

The 36-year-old, who wed Alec, 62, in 2012, went on: 'With living so far from the hospital due to COVID, I'm trying to anticipate labor even sooner.'

She added: 'Literally was there for 10 min and had to drive 3 hours back home because I was not in labor. I'm wiped.'

She added the graphics 'Road Trip' and 'Baby On Board'.

In 2019, Hilaria suffered two miscarriages as she tried to add to her family.

She and her actor husband want another daughter to their family after welcoming three boys and have publicly said they will continue trying until that happens.

Also in August, she revealed that her 'quarantine bubble' had thrown her a surprise baby shower.

'I can't believe that Alec didn't tell me... Because we all know that he can't keep secrets from me! So this was soooooo well done!' she wrote over an image of the Hollywood star with their kids and friends.

Sharing her journey: As with her previous pregnancies, Hilaria, 36, has been documenting her pregnancy online 

Alec and Hilaria have been self-isolating with their children at their home in the upscale celebrity-studded enclave on Long Island.

They left their New York City abode when the coronavirus pandemic broke out in March.

Hilaria announced her pregnancy in April, telling People at the time that she knew instantly that she had conceived again.

'I knew right away. I knew before I could take a test that I was pregnant,' she told the publication. 

'I've done this so many times that I really know that feeling. Even though I knew it would be early, I started taking a test every other day to kind of give myself a sense of how far along I would be. And right when I thought it would turn positive, it did!'
