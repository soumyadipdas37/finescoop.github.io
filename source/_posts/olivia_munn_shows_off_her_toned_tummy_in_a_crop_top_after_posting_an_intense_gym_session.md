News correspondent, TV host and film actress Olivia Munn was seen looking sexy and well put-together in Studio City, California on Saturday.

The X-Men actress, 40, displayed her enviable figure in a sporty ensemble, consisting of a flirty white crop top and retro dark blue Adidas sweatpants.

Olivia let her long straight raven dark hair hang long, and she covered up with black cat-eye sunshades and a high-tech looking black face mask with vents.

Her toned tummy was on full display as she ambled along, carrying a small black leather pouch and wallet.

Her vintage sweatpants sported the Adidas logo along with white piping down the sides. 

On her feet, the Newsroom star wore stylish wedge black sneakers with white soles.

The sighting comes two days after Olivia posted a positively galvanizing clip from a training session at the gym.

In the snippet posted to her Instagram, Munn can be seen matched up with her trainer Jeremy Marinas in a bout of wrestling.

The brief video shows a cat-like Olivia grabbing the man and deftly slamming him to the ground in an impressive roundhouse move. 

Later, she took to her IG Stories to show the bloody aftermath, as it seems she injured Jeremy on the wrist.
