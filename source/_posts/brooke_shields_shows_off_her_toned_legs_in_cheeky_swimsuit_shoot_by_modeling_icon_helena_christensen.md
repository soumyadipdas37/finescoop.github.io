Brooke Shields was an ageless femme fatale as she posed up a storm for some evocative Instagram snapshots.

The 55-year-old actress was film noir chic in the black and white pictures, which showed her rolling around the garden in a dark swimsuit.

Her leggy snapshots were taken by modeling sensation Helena Christensen who shot to fame as a Victoria's Secret Angel in the 1990s.

Brooke flaunted her assets in her high-cut one-piece, letting her straps slide evocatively off her shoulders.

'A great friend and a dream collaborator,' she wrote, adding: 'thank you for believing in my vision and helping bring it to life,' and tagging Helena.

After becoming a star as a model Helena also broke into photography and has previously snapped Brooke for Reserved magazine.

The dynamic duo have been friends for some time apparently as they were seen chatting amiably in New York a couple of years ago.

Brooke, who used to be Mrs. Andre Agassi, has been married since 2001 to screenwriter Chris Henchy who often works with Will Ferrell.

The Suddenly Susan star and her husband are the proud parents of two daughters, 17-year-old Rowan and 14-year-old Grier.

Meanwhile Helena has gone through three divorces and shares her 20-year-old son Mingus with her second ex-husband Norman Reedus. 

During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live last year, Brooke told Andy Cohen that she is 'afraid of' having plastic surgery.

'But I also like wanna do everything I can to just look my best and feel my best, so I recently discovered - I think it's like a trick, it's like a resource,' she said.

Brooke has turned to a body treatment called warm-sculpting, aka SculpSure, a non-invasive procedure in which lasers are used to burn away fat cells.

Last April she was announced as a spokeswoman for SculpSure, which has been cleared by the Food And Drug Administration.

What a pair: Helena previously snapped Brooke for Reserved; they are pictured at the launch party for its third issue at New York's Jane Hotel in 2015
