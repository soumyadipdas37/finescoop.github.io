The wife of NRL star Darius Boyd has revealed she is expecting another baby just a year after the traumatic delivery of the couple's second child.

Kayla Boyd, 32, shared the joyous news with her followers on Instagram on Friday.

She uploaded two pictures of her holding Romi Yves, her second child who is almost a year old, while five-year-old Willow, her first born, is kissing her baby bump. 

'Grateful to be growing another angel,' Ms Boyd wrote in the post. 

'We were going to keep this to ourselves for as long as we could, though we felt such beauty should be embraced.

'Incredibly blessed for this new season of life, our third baby due 2021.'

The couple's announcement follows Ms Boyd opening up about their desire to have a third child throughout the coronavirus pandemic.

'We're not trying, but we're not doing anything to prevent it,' she told The Courier-Mail earlier this year. 

It also follows the traumatic delivery of Romi, the couple's second child, in November 2019. 

Shortly after the birth, Boyd spoke about the 'trauma' he experienced watching his wife and then unborn child battle for lives. 

The Brisbane Broncos captain watched helplessly as his wife struggled through an eight-hour premature labour at Brisbane's North West Private Hospital.

Ms Boyd and the child became distressed during the labour process, forcing medical staff to perform an emergency caesarean to save their lives.

'It was pretty awful seeing Kayla in such pain, going through contractions while they tried to put an anaesthetic needle in her back,' Boyd told New Idea.

Mum and bub eventually pulled through, and Romi was born three weeks early on September 28, 2019. 

She weight 3.2kg and came following a miscarriage and abortion in 2016, and a failed IVF attempt.

'We didn't have anything prepared,' Ms Boyd said. 

'But Romi was ready and knew what we needed in our lives before we knew.' 

The introverted footballer said he cried with relief at the happy outcome.

Boyd was raised by a single mother, and has never known the identity of his father, making his time with his growing family incredibly precious. 

'I just want to grow my own little family,' Boyd said. 

'I was an only child and sometimes, seeing Willow around other kids, I felt she was lonely and needed a sibling.' 

Baby Romi helped put football strains to the back of Boyd's mind.

'I just remember looking up at Darius and he was crying, I was crying,' Ms Boyd told The Courier-Mail in December 2019, adding she hoped to fall pregnant with the couple's third by the end of 2020.

'If it did happen we'd be so happy.'

The Boyd's eldest daughter Willow (pictured with Romi) looked excited to have a baby sister in 2019 after the parents spent nearly two years trying for a second child
