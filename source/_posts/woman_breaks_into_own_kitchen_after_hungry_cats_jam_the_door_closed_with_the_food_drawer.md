This is the hilarious moment a woman realises she has been locked out of her kitchen by her cat who had pulled the drawer out to get treats. 

Rachel Straughan realised she was not getting into her kitchen in Morpeth, Northumberland, any time soon as the door wouldn't open.

As she films her kitchen through the window outside she says one of her pets have lodged the drawer against the door handle, jamming it shut.

One of Rachel Straughan's three cats, Luna, Mitsy or Effy, wanted to get some treats but ended up blocking the entry to the kitchen in Morpeth, Northumberland

One of her pets have lodged the drawer against the door handle, jamming it shut, as she realises she can't get into her kitchen 

One of her three cats, Luna, Mitsy or Effy, wanted to get some treats but ended up blocking the entry in the process.

Trying to and gain access into her kitchen, Ms Straughan had to break both the drawer and the door.

She says it took her half an hour to get in, where she found her cats had been tucking into their treats that were sprinkled all across the floor.

They'd burst the packet of Dreamies treats open and had a feast while they had unintentionally locked themselves in the kitchen.

The annoyed pet owner had to 'shoulder barge the door' to get it open, breaking both the door and the drawer in the process 

Their owner asks: 'Serious?' As the moggie stays perched on the counter, not realising the hassle it has caused. 

The annoyed pet owner then turns the camera on herself to explain how she managed to break back into the room.

She said she had to 'shoulder barge the door so that it was open three inches' so that she was able to get her hand through.

Once her hand was in, she knocked the drawer out on to the floor, causing it to break even further. 

After escaping the event with just a a few bruises on her wrist, she said that she 'couldn't believe' what had happened.
