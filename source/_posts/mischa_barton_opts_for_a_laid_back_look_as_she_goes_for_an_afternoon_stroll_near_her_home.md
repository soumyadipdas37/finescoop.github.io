She rose to fame for her role in teen drama The O.C. before she turned to reality TV with an appearance on MTV's The Hills: New Beginnings.

And Mischa Barton cut a casual figure as went for an afternoon stroll near her home in Los Angeles on Sunday.

The TV star, 34, opted for a laid back look for the outing, donning a pink jumper with a deep v-neckline.

The actress also wore grey tracksuit bottoms which she paired with black flats with a gold buckle.

Mischa styled her dark blonde locks into an updo for the day and completed her outfit with a gold necklace.

Enjoying a drink as she soaked up some sun, the star appeared to go makeup free for the outing.  

Mischa was on her own on Sunday after being seen out earlier this month with actor Gian Marco Flamini.

The couple were glimpsed arm-in-arm as they strolled around Echo Park Lake in LA, before they shared a sweet kiss.

The British–American star had previously been in a relationship with James Abercrombie, which ended in July 2019, though they were spotted together again in October of last year.

Following early roles in Lawn Dogs (1997) and The Sixth Sense (1999), Mischa burst into the spotlight with her starring role on The O.C., which premiered on Fox in 2003.

She played Marissa Cooper, a neighbor to Ryan Atwood (Ben McKenzie) and Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) in Orange County's Newport Beach who struggled with drug abuse issues.

Mischa departed the series following its third season, at which point The O.C.'s ratings began a precipitous decline.

Mischa's connection to Orange County made her a logical choice to join The Hills: New Beginnings, an update on the original MTV reality series.

She was featured in the first season, which began airing in June 2019, but her future on the series is currently uncertain.

Us Weekly reported in March that the actress wouldn't be returning for a second season of the revival and would be replaced by Caroline D'Amore.

Mischa denied the report on Instagram shortly after, writing, 'Lol. Where do people get their reporting from?'

She also took shots at Caroline: 'As if anyone would watch @Carolinedamore try to hoc her boring a** pasta bowls and greasy pizza on tv. Tried that it was like watching paint dry. Get the story straight first @usweekly.'
