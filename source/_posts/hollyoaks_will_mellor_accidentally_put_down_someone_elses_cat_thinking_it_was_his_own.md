Ex-Hollyoaks actor Will Mellor has revealed he accidentally put down someone else's cat thinking it was his own. 

The 44-year-old's pedigree Bengal cat Leo had been missing for eight months when a neighbour brought over a mog they thought might belong to Will.     

The star said he genuinely thought the cat was his, and when the vet said the it had throat cancer he agreed to have it put down. 

Unbelievable: Ex-Hollyoaks actor Will Mellor has revealed he accidentally put down someone else's cat thinking it was his own

He then displayed the cat's ashes in an urn for weeks - before his own cat one day finally turned up after being run over.   

Speaking on the Two Pints With Will and Ralf podcast, he revealed: 'I get a knock on the door — 'We've got your cat'. It was haggard. He had something wrong with his throat.

'So I took him to the vet, and they said, 'He's got throat cancer, got it really bad, we advise you put him down'.

'I thought, my daughter's going to be upset. So I brought him home, let them have one more day with the cat, taking pictures with him, saying goodbye to him.

Comical: Will was speaking on his Two Pints With Will and Ralf podcast

'On the day, I was so upset they put me in the relatives' room. It was terrible, I was so emotional. After, we buy a cheap urn for the ashes and put it on the side.

'Anyway, a month goes by and then the buzzer goes — 'We've got your cat, it's been run over'. It was someone else's cat. I've put down someone else's cat!

'So I'm like, 'Who the f**k's on my windowsill then? I've got the ashes of someone's cat on there, and they don't know where the cat is, and I've just killed it.'

A saga: Will said he was 'so upset' after they put down the first cat, storing his ashes on the window sill for weeks

While the family was happy that the real Leo had returned, Will had to take him to the vet to have his hip dealt with following his car accident. 

He said: '£5,000 in vet bills later… Do you know how much it is for a f***ing drip on a cat overnight? A saline drip? It's a fortune.'

In a cruel twist of fate, Will confided that Leo has once again run away: 'Window left open, the f**ker f**ks off and he's not been back since.

'I couldn't believe it. I was fuming. He's gone. He's cost me a fortune and he's just p****d off as soon as he was fit enough.'
