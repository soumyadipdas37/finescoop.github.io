An Australian man has shared his ingenious three-step trick for sealing a packet of chips with ease, so you don't have to find a rubber band to keep it air tight.

Paulio, who is from Melbourne, used a packet of Thins Light and Tangy chips to demonstrate the unique 'life hack' on TikTok.

He started by folding the corners down on either side of the packet away from him before rolling the packet downwards towards him.

When he reached the spot he was wanting to seal from he folded the two corners over the packet

When he reached the spot he was wanting to seal from he folded the two corners over the packet, so they were now in front of him, effectively sealing off any incoming air flow.

'When you tuck those little flaps over and give it a squeeze, your chips won't come undone,' he said.

Plenty of his fans on the social media site said they just solve the problem by 'eating all of the chips' in one go, but could see how this would be helpful if that wasn't your chosen method.

'Mate you're living in 2040,' one person said, pointing out how advanced the skill was for its time.

'Oh no I bought storage containers for my chips...' Said another. 

Paulio isn't the only Australian who has been showing off chip packet tricks, with another TikTok user crafting her Smith's Salt and Vinegar bag into a bowl.   

April-Joy Goodlet, from Brisbane, Queensland, demonstrated the trick on camera so she could share it with her fanbase.

'As you can see the chips are now on top, and it looks like a bowl, and you can eat all of your chips without having to do any washing up afterwards,' she said

'All you'll need is a packet of chips and not a bowl,' the 26-year-old said.

She started at the bottom of the packet, and began to evenly scrunch it upwards.  

'Usually I like to do it in a circular motion so it's nice and even,' she said.
