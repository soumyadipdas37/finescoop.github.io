Fears of a second coronavirus lockdown appears to have wobbled investor confidence and put the FTSE 100 on course for its worst day in three months.

London's blue-chip stock exchange slumped 3 per cent, or 194 points, to a two-week low of 5,813 this morning.

Travel companies, which were among the hardest bit by the lockdown, also suffered on the stock markets.
