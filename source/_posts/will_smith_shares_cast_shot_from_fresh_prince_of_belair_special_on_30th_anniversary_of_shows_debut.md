Smith, who starred on the show amid its six-year run, also remembered late actor James Avery, who died in 2013 at the age of 68.

He wrote, 'RIP James' in memory of the actor, who played the role of Uncle Phil.

Smith also shared a shot of himself and Janet Hubert, who played Aunt Viv until she was replaced by Reed amid bad blood with Smith and producers.

The two chat about their past problems in the special, HBO Max said, as they spoke for the first time in more than 25 years.

Hubert last month took to Instagram to deliver a challenge to the show in its reunion. 

She wrote, 'It's the 30th anniversary a Fresh Prince. And they want to start a war. Well here is my challenge - we can either keep this war going for another 30 years but I'm not going to, or you can sit down with me and talk to me and not about me Mr. Smith then let's do it.

'Can you only sit and talk about your strange unsavory problems in front of the world?'

She added, 'Accept my challenge or shut up! Either you're telling the truth and the BLACK MEN of the cast are telling the truth or I'm telling the truth. And only YOU and I... and quite a few others, know the truth let's do this do YOU have the courage? #seeyouinseptember.'

HBO Max said the show will be a 'funny and heartfelt night full of music, dancing, and more special surprise guests.' 

The special is slated to be directed by Marcus Raboy and air later this autumn.
