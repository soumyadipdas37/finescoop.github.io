Jose Mourinho is reportedly becoming increasingly frustrated with Tottenham for failing sign him a back-up striker for Harry Kane.

The Spurs manager has begun the season with Harry Kane still the club's only recognised centre-forward.

And The Sun claim the 57-year-old has told friends that he cannot believe a team of their stature is in such a position.

One of those friends is quoted as saying 'Tottenham is the only club in the world with one striker.

'It is the same as last season. Do fans really think Jose wants four left-backs, six wingers and one striker? It is incredible.'

It is easy to see why Mourinho would be unhappy when you compare his side's striking options with their closest rivals.



Arsenal have Eddie Nketiah, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang while Chelsea can call on the trio of Timo Werner, Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud.

Manchester City, meanwhile, have Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus and United boast Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Odion Ighalo.

Speaking about Tottenham's plans ahead of the window's October 5 deadline, Mourinho said: 'Is the club trying to build that balanced squad that we all want, yes we are trying. Let's see if that's possible.'
