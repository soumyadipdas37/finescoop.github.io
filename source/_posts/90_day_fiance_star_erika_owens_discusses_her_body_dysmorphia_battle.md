Australian 90 Day Fiance star Erika Owens has discussed her battle with body dysmorphia.

The former reality star took to Instagram on Thursday to reveal that she is 'back to being on bad b**** territory' after 'pulling herself back together' following a trigger.

The 24-year-old also preached that her worth was not defined by her weight but her 'caring nature, talent, creativity, uniqueness and soul.'

Erika, who also shared a proud snap of herself in pink lingerie while promoting her OnlyFans account, wrote: '⁣⁣It's been a hard week.

'As someone who is generally very confident and relatively positive, a trigger into old negative habits and intense body dysmorphia can truly feel like the end of the world.

'But after a little break, a lot of self-care, hard work and time spent doing what I love surrounded by people I love, I've finally been able to pull myself back together and head back into bad b**** territory.'

The star continued: 'My value isn't measured by f***ing kilograms - it's so much more. It's measured by my passion, my caring nature, talent, creativity, uniqueness and soul.

Erika added: 'Here's to celebrating ourselves ladies, men and non-binary folx - never forget how f***ing beautiful you are. And I'd you ever do, let me know so I can remind you'

'BUT even so - I'm still a babe, and I won't allow some anonymous coward (or 15 a****** every week) in my DM's try and take all the hard work I've put in to my physical and mental health away from me.

'Here's to celebrating ourselves ladies, men and non-binary folx - never forget how f***ing beautiful you are. And I'd you ever do, let me know so I can remind you.'
