Top Gun: Maverick star Miles Teller and his wife Keleigh Sperry celebrated their first wedding anniversary with a luxurious vacation to Tahiti on Tuesday

The Tellers were relieved they 'didn't wait a year' to get 'Maui-ed' in 2019 and, based on the bungalows on stilts, they appeared to be staying at the Four Seasons Bora Bora for their milestone.

Miles donned a yellow Aloha shirt and his 27-year-old Orange County girl wore a flower crown as they hopped in a boat for a romantic cruise around the four-star resort.

Their captain wore a face mask for the picture, but removed it so he could serenade the inseparable couple on the ukulele during their ride.

Teller originally met Sperry in May 2013 while attending a Grammy Awards afterparty for the Black Keys.
