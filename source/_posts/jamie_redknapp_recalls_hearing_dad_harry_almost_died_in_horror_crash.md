Jamie Redknapp has discussed the moment he found out his father Harry almost died in a tragic car crash which killed four people during a trip to Italy.

The former professional footballer, 47, explained it was the 'most difficult time of his life', as he discussed the ordeal during an appearance on Thursday's This Morning.

Jamie recalled his mother Sandra, 72, worrying that something had happened to her husband, after he uncharacteristically failed to call her one evening while on a trip with his friends at the 1990 Italy World Cup.

Jamie has just released his new autobiography, Me, Family and the Making of a Footballer, and revealed that he and his dad only spoke about the crash for the first time while penning the book. 

Recalling the night of the crash, Jamie said: 'I think that was most difficult time of my life, he's my dad and best friend. He went over to Italy during Italia 90. He'd gone over with friends, mum said something is not right as dad always calls.'

Explaining that they heard the news the following day, he said: 'They called in the morning to say Brian Tiler died in the crash but dad was ok. He had a broken leg and fractured skull, it was so tough for us all to go through.'

The minivan collided with a car full of three Irish fans who also all lost their lives.

Jamie said that his father Harry doesn't talk about the crash and opening up during the book was 'therapeutic' for the both of them.

He said: 'He's old school, he doesn't want to talk, he sort of buries it.'

The sport star also confessed that he believes his dad feels slightly to blame, because he should have been sat where Brian was in the minivan.

Detailing why they ended up swapping seats, Jamie said: 'He has time for everyone, I think the hardest thing was he felt for blame...

'He was spending time talking to Irish fans and when they got into the minivan and Brian had sat where my dad was supposed to sit.'

'It was a night of celebration and joy but didn't turn out that way. For Brian's family, he was a special guy, it was so difficult for them.'

Jamie revealed that the crash has affected Harry in many ways for example he will no longer eat pizza because it was the last thing he ate before the crash. 

Jamie said: 'We have never spoken about it and we sort of brushed it aside, but to get it out in the open there was almost a relief. 

'To sit down and go through it was quite therapeutic for both of us. He [Harry] felt like he was protecting us, but it's not always the best thing to hold things back.'
