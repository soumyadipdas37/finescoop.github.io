Love Island twins Jess and Eve Gale were pictured looking very glamorous when they left London hotspot Bagatelle on Sunday night. 

Jess risked a serious wardrobe malfunction wearing a lace sheer corset which had panels strategically placed to protect her modesty. 

She tucked her top into a pair of short denim hotpants, with her sister Eve, both aged 21, wearing a similar pair of shorts.

Daisy Dukes: The twins wore matching denim shorts and matching perspex heels as they posed together for a snap 

Eve wore a different top though, opting for a bright yellow satin vest top which showed off her ample assets. 

Both ladies, who appeared on the last series of Love Island wore matching perspex shoes, and Jess wore a white satin top worn over her outfit. 

Earlier on in the evening, the twins posted content from inside Bagatelle to their Instagram stories. 

Sheer delight: Jess teamed her lingerie top with shorts and a satin white top which was slung over her shoulder 

They showed off a giant ice-cream dessert which they shared with one another and showed off their fashion looks in greater detail in mirror selfies. 

Jess has been trying to move on since her split from Love Island beau Ched Uzor, 23, during the pandemic.  

It's been reported that lockdown made it impossible for the couple to 'build a relationship' as they were unable to meet up with one another.

In a statement shared with MailOnline, the blonde beauty confirmed the COVID-19 lockdown played a role in the demise of their romance, but insisted they continue to be friends. 

The statement read: 'After a whirlwind romance in the Love Island villa, unfortunately Jessica Gale and Ched Uzor have made the mutual decision to split.

'They have unfortunately felt the effects of lockdown separation but will continue as friends. 

'They wish nothing but the best for each other and full success in each others careers.'
