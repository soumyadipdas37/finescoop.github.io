Tammy Hembrow is known for flaunting her impossibly toned figure in a series of scantily-clad ensembles.

However, the social media sensation has raised the bar by inventing a daring new style trend, which gives the illusion of complete nudity, and has taken gyms by storm.

The 26-year-old, as well as fellow fitness enthusiast Pip Edwards, has been turning heads in skintight flesh-coloured Lycra shorts, which appears to double up as an essential piece of gym-wear.Â

Australian sportswear brand Echt has birthed the racy new design, which comes in a range of nude colours, and retails at $52.

And Tammy has certainly become a fan by showing off her curves in the figure-hugging number, which makes it look like she isn't wearing any clothes.

Tammy has also shared several snaps of herself highlighting her famous derriere in several other nude-coloured shorts and leggings.

Tammy has appeared to soak up the attention by onlookers by continuing to endorse the barely-there look during a slew of gruelling workouts.

In one Instagram snap, she is seen promoting a protein powder, while donning a pair of tiny skin-coloured shorts.

Proving that 'naked' look is versatile, the blonde has also dressed up her shorts with a matching crop top, skintight cardigan and handbag for a day out.
