An Australian fashion retailer is selling out of an underwire bikini top and matching bottoms after thousands of shoppers noticed how well it hugged their natural curves.

Glassons sold out of its $30 'tropical' coloured bikini after women started posting about it on Instagram but customers can still get the cut out bra-style top for the same price in white, pink and black shades.

Former Love Island star Cassidy McGill managed to pick up the tropical option and debuted it at Sydney's Shark Beach on Wednesday.

Her followers gave her ample compliments on the brightly coloured two-piece, calling it the 'cutest set' they'd seen in the lead up to summer.

'I love this bikini. It frames your body so well,' said one person.

Other ocean lovers have been rocking the sell-out tropical bikini on the sand in Queensland and even on their balconies in locked down Melbourne.

But for those who weren't fast enough to snap up the must-have print, Glassons has offered three other tones that are proving just as popular.

'I love this bikini. It frames your body so well,' said one person

The bikini is flattering on all body shapes and features a lovely floral print

The textured version still includes an underwire bra for support and a back clasp to easily keep it in place, but it's made from a ribbed nylon and elastane fabric.

It's perfect for those swimmers with larger bust sizes and can be paired with a 'cheeky' cut bikini bottom in the same material.

In July Glassons launched a 'dream bikini' designed by Jade Tuncdoruk which became a bestseller on the website.

It sold out within a month and is no longer on the website, but it did go a long way in putting Glassons on the swimwear map.

The little ruched number also comes in a black colourway, perfect for those who love a monochrome look

'I can't tell you how many times I've found the almost perfect bikini, only to find that it hurts my neck or digs into my hips or doesn't cover my boobs properly,' Jade said at the time.

'This bikini is made for women of all different shapes and sizes who want to feel comfortable and cute when they're walking down the beach.

'I also love the fact that the adjustable bottoms are a little bit cheeky and that you can wear the side ties as high on your waist or as low as you like. 

'My dream bikini literally is my dream bikini. I couldn't be happier with how it turned out.'

All of the Glassons styles are $19.99 for the top and bottom, sold separately, or $30 if you buy the set.
