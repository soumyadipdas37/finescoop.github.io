Kaley Cuoco was glimpsed this weekend enjoying a stroll in New York City.

The 34-year-old Big Bang Theory alum swept her signature blonde hair into an updo and cut a stylish figure in a bright blue tank top.

Showing off her toned gams in a pair of black leggings, she slung on a cross-body phone carrier and slipped into colorful sneakers.

Kaley warded off the rays with a baseball cap and took the precaution of wearing a mask amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Although she was initially self-isolating in California she recently crossed the country to finish filming on her upcoming HBO Max sitcom The Flight Attendant.

She posted a black and white selfie this week with her co-star Zosia Mamet, who is the daughter of legendary playwright David Mamet.

'Friends that get covid tested every few days , wear masks, take necessary pre-cautions, listen to production rules , wash hands all day long and respect the process together, get to act together,' wrote Kaley.

Tagging Zosia she wrote that 'this picture was taken right before we shot today’s scene in a very structured quarantined environment.'

She gushed: 'Very proud of our cast and crew at #theflightattendant and everyone @warnerbrostv & @hbomax for making this possible for us!'

Season one of The Flight Attendant has eight episodes, and filming on the sixth was underway when the shoot was suspended for lockdown in March.

One of the showrunners Steve Yockey appeared in a virtual panel for the Television Critics Association press tour in early August and hinted production was to restart.

He dished that 'assuming everything goes according to plan, you'll see it on HBO Max this fall,' according to The Hollywood Reporter. 

While in Los Angeles this April, Kaley and her second husband Karl Cook finally moved in together more than a year after their wedding.

Kaley told Access this March that she and Karl were planning to move into their luxurious Los Angeles home the following month.

They were waiting until renovation was completed on their Hidden Hills estate, which they jointly bought for $11.75 million according to Variety.

Their plan was to move into the property after she finished shooting The Flight Attendant in New York, but lockdown threw a wrench in that idea.

Although the actress and the equestrian married on a horse ranch over the summer of 2018 they had never lived together before this year.
