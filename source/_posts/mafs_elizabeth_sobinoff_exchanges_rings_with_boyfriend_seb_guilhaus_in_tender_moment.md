Married At First Sight star Lizzie Sobinoff is more loved-up than ever with her boyfriend, Seb Guilhaus.

And on Sunday, the 29-year-old exchanged engraved silver thumb rings with the hunky personal trainer. 

Taking to Instagram, Lizzie shared a sentimental photograph of their new jewellery.  

When's the wedding? Married At First Sight's Elizabeth Sobinoff (L) has exchanged rings with boyfriend Sebastian Guilhaus (R) in a tender moment on Sunday

'He said to me ''Is it S & L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it.'

Over at Seb's Instagram, he wrote: 'Compromise ... give and take ... melding of two worlds.'

'For relationships to flourish we need to want to really be a part of each others worlds.'

Ringing it in: 'He said to me ''Is it S & L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it,' Lizzie wrote

He finished: 'I'm quickly finding out it's so amazing to be able to do things we both enjoy, together.'

The rings did not appear to signify any engagement for the couple and were merely decorative for them.  

On Wednesday, Elizabeth decided to treat fans with a seemingly nude photo of the reality hunk on her Instagram page.

'In case you are having a bad day I hope this brightens up your world,' the 29-year-old brunette teased to fans.  

The image saw Seb flaunting his rippling muscles and sun-kissed glow, with the seductive photo cutting off just above his private area.

In an attempt to dispel rumours he was nude, Lizzie added: 'And yes, he has pants on!'

Fans in their masses were quick to comment on the saucy snap, with one writing: 'Oh how devastating for you, it must be difficult handling a body like this every day!'    

'Oh dear Lord,' another simply wrote, while a third gushed: 'Put it away Seb!'

A fourth fan laughed: 'And this is why I love you - thank you for sharing!'

Support: Lizzie was inundated with messages from fans - who absolutely loved looking at the steamy image

Elizabeth and Seb met while starring on her second season of Married At First Sight in 2020.

The pair were recently forced to spend three months apart due to the coronavirus pandemic, after she returned to Sydney for work while he stayed in Adelaide.  

She said they ultimately stayed connected through 'constant texting' while apart, and finally reunited in June.
