She recently announced she is pregnant with her second child to fiancé Matthew 'Matty J' Johnson.

And on Wednesday, Laura Byrne teased the name of their next baby during an interview with the Kyle and Jackie O show.

Host Kyle Sandilands asked: 'Will you be calling the new child also like a hillbilly female name as well? Are you doing the hyphenated thing?

The brunette beauty, who welcomed her first daughter Marlie-Mae in June 2019, said: 'We have an equally bogan name up our sleeves guys.'

'Don't worry, we're not going to disappoint,' she laughed.  

Last week, the couple hinted at the sex of their unborn baby, during an appearance on Studio 10.

Matty guessed they were having a boy, but said he would be happy with either gender. 

'I don't know if this is wishful thinking, but there's lots of kicks right now, so for me, I'm like alright we have a little soccer player, rugby player' he said. 

Meanwhile, Laura stayed mum during the discussion, making sure not to reveal whether or not she knew what gender their soon-to-be bundle of joy was.
