Kathie Lee Gifford is best known as an ebullient talk show host for morning TV.

But in the new trailer for the romantic comedy Then Came You, the 67-year-old New Yorker proves she has some acting chops too as she stars as a grieving widow Annabelle on a spiritual journey overseas.

In the first-look clip, the spunky American is seen winning the heart of Scottish Inn keeper Howard, played by Craig Ferguson, even though he is engaged to pinup Clare, played by Elizabeth Hurley.

Lovely lady: Kathie Lee Gifford is best known as an ebullient talk show host for morning TV. But in the new trailer for the romantic comedy Then Came You, the 67-year-old New Yorker proves she has some acting chops too as she stars as a grieving widow Annabelle on a spiritual journey in Europe

She falls for him: In the first-look clip, the spunky American is seen winning the heart of Scottish Inn keeper Howard, played by Craig Ferguson

The trailer opens with Gifford arriving in Scotland where she stays at an old castle owned by Howard who had to turn it into an inn for income.

'Is this your first time in Scotland?' asks Ferguson. 'My first time anywhere, really,' says Kathy who comes off as genuine and authentic which is the opposite of his  sarcastic Scot.

She is then seen in a black convertible sports car with Howard.

The other woman: But he is engaged to pinup Clare, played by Elizabeth Hurley

'I've never seen anything except through the movies,' explains the traveler, clearly wide eyed.

When she enters his office in a plaid outfit he laughs and says, 'Oh wow, didn't know Mel Gibson was having a yard sale.'

Gibson is Australian but starred in Braveheart about medieval Scottish patriot William Wallace.

They bond: 'Is this your first time in Scotland,' asks Ferguson. 'My first time anywhere, really,' says Kathy who comes off as genuine and authentic which is the opposite of the his sarcastic Scot

Instead of delivering a comeback, she says a simple, 'Good morning.'

The redhead is in awe of the natural beauty of Scotland. 'So much more beautiful than the pictures,' she notes.

Then she meets his fiance, the glamorous, stylish Clare who is played to perfection by red carpet favorite Hurley.

Clare gets right to the point: where is this American woman's husband?

She had a sad loss: Turns out he died a little over a year ago and now the widow wants to enjoy life a little



Turns out he died a little over a year ago leaving Annabelle lonely.

'I'm just about new everything these days,' explains Gifford's character as she hits a pub with her new best friend Howard.

It seems like the two start spending a tremendous amount of time together and possibly falling in love.

Then he explains his predicament.

'I'm embarrassed about running an inn in a place that used to be my home,' says Ferguson's Howard. 'So I do the housekeeping as well,' he adds.

The old castle has issues. When the water won't work in Gifford's bathroom, she heads into the basement herself to work on the plumbing.

He is immediately charmed and makes a crude joke about a 'petcock' - a small shut-off valve used to control the flow of liquid or gas - as he cannot seem to help making jokes here and there. 

After he discovers she keeps her dead husband's ashes inside an old chocolate box he says she is 'mad' but she corrects him: 'I'm just kind of sad.'

Next she is seen riding a bicycle; Kathy has kept a great figure and looks far younger than her years in a turtleneck and jeans.

It's hard on her: After he discovers she keeps her dead husband's ashes inside an old chocolate box he says she is 'mad' but she corrects him: 'I'm just kind of sad'

Is it love? She is then seen stroking his hair as they sit on the sofa: 'We're two people just trying to do the best we can do,' she says through tears

She is heard saying she has to make 'new memories or the old ones are going to kill me.'

Then the flirting starts: he says let's get drunk and she calls him 'cute.'

Hurley's Clare gets upset as she senses he has fallen for the 'simple woman' but he explains she is not that simple.

He is into it: He clearly has fallen for her by the end of the trailer as he admires her legs while she is in her nightshirt

Arlene, played by Phyllida Law, tells Gifford's Annabelle that she needs to learn how to be happy again; but it seems she has found happiness with Howard.
