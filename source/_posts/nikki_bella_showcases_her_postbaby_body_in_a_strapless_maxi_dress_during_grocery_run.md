Nikki paired her casual dress with some black sandals and a pillowed Chanel bag.

She had her cellphone pressed to her ear and she adhered to California's mask mandate by rocking a sparkly cloth mask in public.

The former professional wrestler exited the popular grocery chain with a single shopping bag.

With keys in hand, Nikki made her way back to her vehicle and headed home to her newborn.

And to celebrate her soon-to-be hubby's return to the dance floor, Nikki uploaded a steamy 'Hidden Cam' style video of herself and Artem to her Instagram page.

In the clip, Nikki and Artem held onto one another as they slow danced and shared a plethora of passionate kisses.

And last week, Nikki bravely showcased her postpartum body on Instagram and spoke candidly about the weight loss journey she is embarking on.

'I want to bring you all along in the realest, rawest way possible, so here I am. I am 18 pounds away from my pre-pregnancy weight,' revealed the brunette beauty.

Wearing just a black bra and panties, the reality star stood before the camera and gave her viewers a 360 view of her current form.

She added that her 'turn' in front of the camera was the 'scariest turn of [her] life,' due to how vicious the internet can be towards female bodies.

Nikki admitted to indulging in 'pizza quite a bit' and 'baked goods' towards the end of her pregnancy and that she used her pregnancy as an excuse to eat what she wanted.   

Despite using 'pregnancy as an excuse a lot' and having a gourmet chef for a fiance, Nikki said that she takes 'full accountability' for her missteps and that she is 'now on the journey to lose 18 pounds.'

'But in the healthiest way possible because breastfeeding, obviously, and giving my son the most amazing nutrition is number one,' she insisted.

'So there is gonna be no crash diets, there is gonna be no starving myself, it's gonna be bringing workouts back in and healthy nutrition, which I have been doing.'
