Being a contestant on The Bachelor may seem like a fairytale - but it appears life on-set is anything but rosy.

Limited catering options, hectic filming schedules and not being able to talk to Locky Gilbert off-camera are a just a few of the hurdles contestants face on the show. 

'The food options aren't very exciting – there are no banquets or lavish catering, not unless it's part of a date,' an on-set spy told Woman's Day this week.

According to the publication, the contestants are required to be on call 24/7.

'You're expected to wake up whenever producers tell you to,' the source alleged. 

The first cocktail party is filmed over several nights for as long as 12 hours at a time. 

Some of the women end up getting drunk simply out of boredom and find themselves saying things they regret on camera.

The television insider also claimed that Locky, 32, is off limits when the show isn't being filmed. 

'The girls are instructed not to talk to Locky when there are no cameras rolling – it causes continuity issues if conversations are had without them being recorded.'

It comes just days after an insider claimed that this year's season was 'a f**king punish' working for the production team at Warner Bros. because the cast wasn't up to scratch.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, the source claimed: 'Producers couldn't stand most of the girls.'

'They just wanted to be on the show to become famous. Some were fame hungry, some had dreams to become actors, and others were there for clout.' 

Producers apparently worked overtime to convince Locky to keep the few entertaining and engaging women in the mansion for as long as possible.
