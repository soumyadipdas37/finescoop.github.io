A year after Angie Kent's appearance on The Bachelorette, her best friend Yvie Jones has revealed what fans didn't see on TV.

Yvie, 47, briefly appeared on the show to attend a life drawing class with Angie, 30, and the show's remaining suitors. 

'I went on a date with Angie and eight guys - what's not to love? And Ciarran [Stott] got naked! There was nothing too exciting in that, believe me, but it was something. Someone got naked,' she joked in an interview with Daily Mail Australia on Friday.

But Yvie revealed Ciarran, 26, was never supposed to strip off for the life drawing class, and said the show had actually hired a professional model.   

'It was so funny, there was a guy out the back in a robe. He cracked the s**ts! Well, he cracked the sads. He was just put to the side. They bumped him!' she recounted.

'He was there waiting, and then Osher's gone, "Would anyone like to volunteer?" Ciarran's put his hand straight up, and all the guys rolled their eyes.

'They obviously knew him well already and just went, "Yeah, we knew he would." So there's this dude in a robe out the back kind of going, "Oh."' 

Yvie admitted she felt bad for the guy, after he missed his opportunity to appear on The Bachelorette. 

'It makes you wonder what happened to him, the poor thing. I should look him up. He's probably got a GoFundMe. Maybe it's on his Tinder profile - "I nearly was on The Bachelorette in the nude",' she joked.

'Poor guy. We never even got to see him. He would have manscaped the hell out of himself! Got a tan... He might be going to therapy now.'

Yvie said the man just left and went home after Ciarran decided to step in as the model, but she argued they should've been given a choice as to who would pose. 

'It would've been nice to get an option. Couldn't he have just dropped the robe and we could have gone, "Yeah, we'll choose which one we want,"' she added.
