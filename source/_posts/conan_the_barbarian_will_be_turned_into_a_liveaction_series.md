Netflix is developing a sword and sorcery series based on Robert E. Howard's 1932 character Conan the Barbarian from Pathfinder Media producing duo Fredrik Malmberg and Mark Wheeler.

The streaming giant execs are now searching for a director to helm the show as well as a writer/showrunner to pen the adaptation, according to Deadline.

Malmberg first teased the news Wednesday morning by quoting a different Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick: 'Today is a new day. I think we need ourselves some Conan. Ok, let me see what we can do. I'll be back.'

The original R-rated 1982 classic - starring Schwarzenegger - was directed by John Milius from a script co-written by Oliver Stone, which amassed around $300M in theaters and home video.

The 73-year-old former California Governor had revealed Milius was still working on a separate script for Conan the King as recent as last year when they reunited at Silicon Valley Comic-Con.

Richard Fleischer's PG-rated 1984 sequel Conan the Destroyer - featuring Grace Jones, Wilt Chamberlain, and André the Giant - was far less well received earning $31M at the global box office.
