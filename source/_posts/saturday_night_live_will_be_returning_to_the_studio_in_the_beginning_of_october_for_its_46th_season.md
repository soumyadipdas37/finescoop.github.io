It's been a strange year to say the least, but at least some familiar comforts are coming back.

Saturday Night Live, NBC's long-running and much loved comedy review program, will be back for its 46th season next month.

The news came with a brief and none-too-informative video on SNL's Instagram account, showing a slow zoom through the famed studio within NBC's headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza – or 30 Rock – in New York City's Midtown Manhattan.

As the camera slow zoomed through the darkened Studio 8H, sounds of a live audience and the trademark announcement 'Live, from New York' built to a crescendo before the premiere date appeared: October 3.

Show producers have yet to announce the host for the season premiere, let alone the musical performer or the slate of other talent booked for later shows.

The news comes after Lorne Michaels, SNL's creator, told Variety in July that the team was eager to get the show going again, minus the usual live studio audience, in time for the presidential election in November.

The late night sketch show has found renewed vigor and humor in recent seasons, thanks to its biting political commentary made fresh by Alec Baldwin's Trump impersonation, among others.

SNL's 45th season was of course cut short earlier this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Instead, the cast united virtually in May for three at-home episodes hosted by the likes of Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt and Kristen Wiig.

October 3rd's in-studio episode will be the first since its March 7th telecast, which saw actor Daniel Craig as host – initially booked most probably to promote his latest James Bond film No Time To Die, which has now been delayed until November 20th.

In the interim, Saturday Night Live received 15 Emmy Award nominations in July, including one for Best Variety Sketch Series and one for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for Brad Pitt's portrayal of Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The Emmys, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, are set to unfold on Sunday September 20th.
