She's the Irish rose who was left heartbroken after being rejected by Matt Agnew on The Bachelor in 2019.

But Emma Roche has certainly undergone a dramatic physical transformation since her failed stint on the dating show.

On Tuesday, the reality star, 33, surprised her Instagram followers by showing off her very plump pout and taut visage in a series of photos.

The beauty wore a full face of makeup, including dewy foundation, blush, and a smokey eye as she posed for a selfie.

Emma kept warm in a grey jumper and leopard-print headband while she styled her brunette locks out.

In another photo, the 33-year-old reality star flaunted her plump lips while wearing a black and white jumper.

It's unclear what Emma has done to enhance her looks, but last year she admitted to getting some 'subtle filler' to create the perfect jawline. 

'A pleasure welcoming The Bachelor's Emma Roche back to the clinic recently!'wrote the Cosmos Clinic.

'A subtle treatment of dermal filler to the chin enhanced her profile, created a more defined jawline, and achieved a more balanced overall appearance. Looking forward to seeing you again soon, Emma!'

Emma also usually tags the Cosmos Clinic in her Instagram selfies, along with her cosmetic nurse Benoite Boucoiran.

Meanwhile, Emma made it to the top four before she was eliminated on last year's season of The Bachelor.

She was known as a 'stage-five clinger' after becoming the first contestant to drop the L-bomb.
