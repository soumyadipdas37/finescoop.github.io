Â A deputy headteacher at a primary school has admitted watching videos of child sexual abuse - including rape - on the dark web.

Disgraced Richard Swinnerton, 30, admitted he was watching sickening abuse of minors on the internet for two years before he was caught.

He was eventually arrested by officers from the National Crime Agency at his home in May.

Deputy headteacher Richard Swinnerton, 30, admitted watching child sex abuse videos on the dark web

He admitted his offences and told investigators the footage he watched included adults raping children.

The paedophile from Middlesbrough later resigned from his job at St Clare's Catholic Primary School in the town.

He appeared at Teeside Magistrates' Court today (Monday) and admitted three counts of possession of illegal images of children relating to category A (the most severe), category B and category C.

The court heard when officers arrested him they seized his laptop which contained 87 Category A videos of child abuse.

He will be sentenced at Teeside Crown Court at a later date.

Speaking after his guilty pleas, the NCA said he used TOR software (The Onion Router) to make himself anonymous on the dark web.

Officers have found no evidence to suggest that any of the images were made at the school and there is no allegation of physical abuse.

NCA operations manager Julie Booker said: 'Swinnerton had gone to considerable lengths using TOR to commit his offences and thought he was anonymous on the dark web.

'Offenders who view child sexual abuse are contributing to ever more children being abused and condemning them to years of extreme trauma and suffering.

'Every child in an abuse image is re-victimised when the photograph is viewed or shared.

'Protecting children from sexual abuse and stopping paedophiles is a top priority for the NCA.'

After the hearing, a St Clare's school spokesperson said: 'This has been an upsetting matter for parents, carers, staff and the wider St Clare's community.

'We are grateful for the support we have received from them and we continue to assure them that the wellbeing and safety of children of St Clare's remains our priority at all times.

'It is also important to reiterate that this former employee's offences were not in connection with his employment at the school.'
