A bitter neighbourhood feud will now be played out in court as a retired barrister is accused of putting used tissues in a woman's exhaust pipe of her luxury car after she allegedly cut of the water supply to his apartment. 

Daniel Marash, 71, who was based in Hong Kong for decades before purchasing a property for $3.3million in Toorak, one of Melbourne's swankiest suburbs.

Marash will front the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Thursday to answer allegations he assaulted Merina Abdallahah and then placed the used tissues in the exhaust pipe of her luxury $150,000 Mercedes-Benz.

But Marash will argue the alleged assault was only him waving his fist at Ms Abdallah after she had cut off the water to his luxury apartment. 

He is also expected to allege his neighbour frequently closes the gates to the apartments, locking him out, and often phones him at 3am.

 'This was the third time it had occurred over a period of months. I approached Mrs Abdallah and her daughter to complain in the garage after I had turned it (water) back on and told her not to do it again,' he told the Herald Sun.

'She became abusive and claimed she turned it off as a sprinkler from my garden had caused damage to the wall at (a neighbour's) car park space.

'That was utter nonsense as the paint spots there had been there for years and we had an architect's report to that effect.'

Victoria Police confirmed in a statement that a '71-year-old Toorak man was charged with unlawful assault and tamper with motor vehicle in relation to an alleged incident that occurred at a Grange Road address in Toorak on 8 July 2019.'

Mr Marash will claim Mrs Abdallah has harassed him from the moment he purchased the property.

He is also expected to allege his neighbour frequently closes the gates to the apartments, locking him out, and often phones him at 3am. 

Marash's luxury apartment — which he bought for $3.3 million in 2000 — boasts three bedrooms and two bathrooms, a living room and entertainment room. 

Mrs Abdullah is the director of Domus Australia.
