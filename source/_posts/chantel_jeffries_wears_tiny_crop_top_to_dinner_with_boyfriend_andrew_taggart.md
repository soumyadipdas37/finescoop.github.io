She's a model and DJ who has been romantically linked to some of the music world's biggest current names in recent years.

And Chantel Jeffries had all eyes on her on Friday night, when she stepped out in style for a meal with her boyfriend Andrew Taggart at West Hollywood's Delilah.

The 27-year-old beauty proudly displayed her incredibly taut abs in a tiny black crop top, which she teamed with green checked trousers.

Layering up with a black leather biker jacket, Chantel stood tall in a pair of chunky black heavy duty boots as she made her entrance into the venue.

Wearing her chestnut brown locks in a high ponytail, while framing her face with long tendrils, she complied with COVID-19 regulations by sporting a face mask.

Meanwhile, The Chainsmokers star Andrew, 31, donned a white sweater, which he paired with camouflage cropped trousers and box fresh white Nike high-tops.

Amid the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, both Chantel and Andrew seem to have been travelling across the US and throughout North America.

In the same post from August 30, she included snaps of the two lovebirds while visiting Maine.

She beamed in a grey sweatshirt and tiny black shorts while blocking out the sun with thin black sunglasses.

Andrew embraced her in one selfie and wore a charcoal sweatshirt and an intriguing set of angular pentagonal sunglasses.

Chantel, who was previously linked to Machine Gun Kelly, Justin Bieber and Diplo, was first linked with Andrew in February.

She showed the relationship was heating up late in July with an Instagram photo shared with her 4.7 million followers of the two kissing while dining outdoors.

She shared the post the same day that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lambasted Drew's group The Chainsmokers for 'egregious social distancing violations' after the performed in front of a packed crowd.

Only a few mask wearers were seen at a Safe & Sound charity event in New York's Southampton.
