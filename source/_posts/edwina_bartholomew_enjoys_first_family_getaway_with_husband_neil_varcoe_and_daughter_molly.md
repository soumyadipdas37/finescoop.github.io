Sunrise's Edwina Bartholomew has whisked her family away for a country-side getaway.

The first-time mum shared a series of photos and videos to Instagram on Tuesday, showing her daughter Molly, and husband Neil Varcoe enjoying the mini-break.

The Channel Seven presenter indicated that the three are staying at Nguurruu Farm, 2 hours and 45 minutes south-west of Sydney.

'It's magic!' On Tuesday, Sunrise's Edwina Bartholomew enjoyed her first family farm getaway with husband Neil Varcoe and daughter Molly 

In one photo, Edwina can't wipe the smile off her face as she posed with her adoring family.

She captioned the sunny photograph: 'Our first family holiday @nguurruu_farm...It's magic here ☀️'

The 37-year-old added that she has been trading stories back and forth with the locals and was able to finally find the time to fit in a visit.

Edwina returned to her role as a presenter with the Channel Seven morning show Sunrise at the start of June - which is notorious for its gruelling early morning starts.

'Going back to work has been a challenge. I have loved having something "other" in the day but miss our mornings,' she admitted in an Instagram post.
