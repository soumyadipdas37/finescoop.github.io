A teenager has tested positive to coronavirus while in hotel quarantine just days before Western Australia is set to increase the number of overseas arrivals.

The 13-year-old boy is in quarantine in Perth after recently arriving from overseas and is a close contact of previously confirmed case.

The new case comes just a week before WA is due to increase its arrivals by 200 per week on September 27 before adding an extra 300 per week on October 12.

Premier Mark McGowan said on Friday at least one and possibly two extra quarantine hotels would need to be set up to accommodate the extra 500 returnees

Premier Mark McGowan said on Friday at least one and possibly two extra quarantine hotels would need to be set up to accommodate the extra 500 returnees. 

However a revival of the quarantine program on Rottnest Island isn't expected to be required.

WA has enlisted eight hotels to house people returning from overseas and Victoria, as well as airline staff.

Elective surgery may be impacted by the change to ensure medical support isn't compromised for the increased hotel quarantine efforts.

'I don't want to reduce elective surgery capacity but it may be necessary,' Mr McGowan said.

There are currently three active infections in WA and the total number of cases since the start of the pandemic is now 662. 

The new case comes just a week before WA is due to increase its arrivals by 200 per week on September 27 before adding an extra 300 per week on October 12

Meanwhile, the state has announced it will start testing wastewater for COVID-19 within the next month.

The analysis aims to identify the existence of the virus to enable more targeted campaigns encouraging people to be tested.

It has been used in other jurisdictions including the ACT and Queensland.
