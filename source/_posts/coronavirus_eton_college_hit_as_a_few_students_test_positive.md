Eton College has been hit by an outbreak of coronavirus after 'a few' students tested positive for the disease on their return from the summer holidays.

Final year students were the last to return to the prestigious college near Windsor in Berkshire yesterday and pupils were tested privately for the virus on arrival.

Eton confirmed several of their 1,300 students were found to have Covid-19 and those with positive tests have now been placed in isolation.   

Staff will trace the movements of students who caught the virus, and isolate any pupils and employees with whom they have had recent contact.  

It is thought the outbreak affects three of Eton's boarding houses: Angelo's House, Wooton House and Keate House.

The college would not confirm which houses were involved but said parents had been informed of the outbreak.

In a statement, it said: 'Acting on the advice of senior health professionals, Eton took the decision to test all pupils and staff for Covid-19 on their return to school, having carefully assessed the risks of transmission within our specific boarding context.

'In deciding to test, Eton has been determined not to put additional pressure on the NHS. Therefore, a contract has been taken out with a private provider and the school is covering all costs.

'On their return to the school, a few asymptomatic pupils have tested positive and the school is following Health Protection Agency advice in relation to their isolation and the tracing of their contacts.

The last of the school's students returned to the prestigious college near Windsor in Berkshire on Thursday and pupils were tested privately to avoid the use of NHS services

'Other pupils continue in school in accordance with the appropriate social distancing and other mitigating measures we have put in place.' 

The £42,000-a-year school was founded in 1441 and has many notable alumni including Prince William, Prince Harry and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

It is also where former PM David Cameron was taught, alongside Bear Grylls and actors Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie.  

The Government advises that international students travelling to the UK to attend boarding school self-isolate for two weeks before going back to the classroom.
