Mohamed Salah paid tribute to his seriously ill Egypt team-mate Moamen Zakaria after scoring a hat-trick in Liverpool's 4-3 victory over Leeds.

The forward celebrated his third goal at Anfield - his second from the penalty spot - by emulating Zakaria's celebration, pressing his hands over his ears.

Zakaria is suffering with incurable Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), commonly know as Motor Neuron Disease, which affects the brain and spinal chord.
