A photographer has captured the beaming faces of several pooches for a new collection aiming to keep dog adoption rates high after lockdown. 

London-based Liz Greggs captured the pets looking their happiest as part of a campaign organised by British rehoming charity All Dogs Matter. 

She has also revealed her top tips on how to capture your beloved pet's best features using a phone - by making sure the photoshoot is fun for your dog and using treats to keep them focused. 

The photographer said that keeping things short and having play breaks was the best way to make sure your dog was relaxed and poised for pictures. 

All Dogs Matter recorded a surge of interest in adopting pooches during lockdown and are hoping the photoshoot will help keep this rate high.
