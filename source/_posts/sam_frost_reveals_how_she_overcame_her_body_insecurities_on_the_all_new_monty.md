Sam Frost is stripping off for a good cause on The All New Monty: Guys and Gals.

And on Friday, the Home and Away star revealed on Channel Seven's The Morning Show how she was able to overcome her body insecurities.

The 31-year-old actress told hosts Larry Emdur and Kylie Gillies that doing the charity burlesque show has helped boost her body confidence.

'I think as females, we all have our own insecurities and it is really daunting to have to strip on TV and then in front of a large crowd,' she said.

'I think one of the biggest things that I was constantly reminded of was why were we doing it and it was breast cancer awareness.

'Any time I would start stressing out or feel insecure or anxious, I would think of the greater picture.'

For a good cause: The 31-year-old actress told The Morning Show hosts Larry Emdur and Kylie Gillies that whenever she felt nervous about showing her body, she would remind herself that the burlesque show was about raising awareness of early detection and prevention of cancer

Sam also credited her co-stars with supporting her during rehearsals and in the lead-up to the live performance.

She said: 'The girls were amazing. We all supported each other and we were all in the same boat, so it was a great sisterhood. That definitely helped me through it.'

Her co-star singer Danielle Spencer, who is Russell Crowe's ex-wife, added: 'There was a lot of support amongst the cast and the crew.'
