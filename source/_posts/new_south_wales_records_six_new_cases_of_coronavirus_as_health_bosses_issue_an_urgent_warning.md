New South Wales has recorded six new coronavirus cases overnight.  

Five cases were returned travellers in hotel quarantine while one has been linked to the Liverpool Hospital cluster, in western Sydney.  

Twenty-one cases have now been linked to the hospital. 

New South Wales Health warned despite the low number of cases, the virus was likely circulating in people who had mild symptoms.

'It’s vital that everyone who does have the virus is tested and diagnosed, in order to stop further spread to others,' the department said.

Four people are currently being treated in the intensive care unit with two of them placed on ventilators.
