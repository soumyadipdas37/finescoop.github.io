'Well tonight Matthew I'm going to be one of those people!!! But the difference is, I already know I look fabulous in these pics and it’s because I was TWENTY EIGHT years old!!! 

'And what's more I STILL HAVE THAT SWIMSUIT!!! It was a two piece by John Galliano and is in my dressing up box. 

'The pics were taken on my first trip to St Tropez and Port Grimaud in 1988. B****y hell, thirty two years ago, and when I went there recently I stood on that pier and thought it looked familiar....but it didn't click.

One wrote: 'Look b****y fab then and now. Why not post amazing photos of yourself? I know I would if I had one of me looking fantastic at 28 years old on a pier in St Tropez..in fact I would make it my profile photo.'

Youthful: Carol's fans told her she still 'looks amazing if not better'



'You're looking good girl': Fans soon took to the comment section to compliment Carol

Carol's post comes days after her Loose Women co-star Nadia Sawalha shared a throwback bikini picture, where she admitted she has spent too long hating her body.  

The TV star, 55, posted the 20-year-old snap on Instagram alongside a current one in a two-piece as she embraced her natural body.

She said the photograph, which shows her attempting to cover her body with her hands while on the beach, was sent to her by Carol.

The black and white snap shows Nadia standing alongside her friend and co-star Kaye Adams during a beach holiday.

In a lengthy caption, Nadia said: '@the_mcgiff just sent this pic she took twenty years ago to me and @kayeadamsofficial. 

'Saying ... Just had to send this to you two because it so perfectly sums up the old Nadia......look at the horror on your face because I was taking a photo of you!!! 

'And my god she's right.' 

She continued: 'I can actually remember the moment Carol took the photo . I almost wanted to cry because I thought I was so 'hideous ' a word I used all the time to describe myself back then ... look at me trying to cover my body ??

'It leaves me feeling so sad when I look back and think about how much of that holiday I wasted with 'stinking thinking ' feeling 'ugly ' comparing my figure constantly to Kaye Adams and Carol's gorgeous bodies.

'What a b****y waste of time. What a sacrilege.'
