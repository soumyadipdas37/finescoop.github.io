Kourtney Kardashian enjoyed a laid-back lunch outing at the Malibu hotspot Nobu on Sunday.  

While dining with pals at the trendy eatery, the 41-year-old reality's eldest child expertly stole the spotlight in a fun sweatsuit, which was designed after a bag of  Flamin' Hot Cheetos. 

While her preteen paired his bold look with a pair of light blue slides, the Poosh founder donned a reserved all-white ensemble and nude stilettos on Saturday.

While blocking out the California rays under a pair of retro sunglasses, she styled her oversized sweatshirt and fitted trousers with a matching handbag. 

In addition to a few other school aged children accompanying Mason, Kardashian appeared to be enjoying a day with Addison Rae, 19, and Harry Hudson, 27. 

As they exited the restaurant, the mother-of-three chatted away with her son and his friends, while sporting a white CDC-recommended face mask.

During the meal, Rae shared a Boomerang video of her pal at the legendary celebrity haunt. 

In the brief recording, the E! star can be seen playing with her sunglasses and pursing her lips with a pair of chopsticks and a delicious entrée in front of her.
