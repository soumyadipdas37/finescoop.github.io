Troubled Australian tennis star Bernard Tomic is no longer dating newly eliminated Bachelor contestant Kaitlyn Hoppe.

The pair had been in an on-and-off relationship for a number of years, and had reconnected about two months ago when Kaitlyn, 26, was kicked off The Bachelor.

But the blonde reality starlet confirmed on Friday that she was no longer in contact with the former world No. 17, telling The Daily Telegraph their 'friendship is definitely over'.

'I do wish him the best and I hope he finds his way and surrounds himself with people who have his best interests at heart,' she added.

Kaitlyn downplayed their romantic connection, but said she had stayed 'loyal' to the fallen sportsman for years.

'It's more like loyalty with him and I've always had a soft spot for him because I know a lot of people don't like him, but I wouldn't call it dating or a relationship,' she said.

It comes after Bernard and Kaitlyn had a very public row at the Hollywood Showgirls strip club on the Gold Coast earlier this month.

Their argument on Saturday, September 5, led to Kaitlyn leaving the club, while Bernard - a regular patron - was allowed to stay.

A source told Daily Mail Australia the altercation brought the club to a standstill.

'They got in a big fight at Hollywood Showgirls the other weekend... everyone heard and saw it,' the onlooker said.

'It was crazy, even for a night out on the Gold Coast. They were screaming at each other.'

Having long been regarded as the brightest future star in world tennis, Bernard's career is almost at a point of no return.

The world No. 209 has not won a Grand Slam singles match since mid-2018.

The former Wimbledon quarter finalist was such a prodigious young talent that at 12 he was signed by management giant IMG.

But after reaching a highest ranking of 17 in 2016, his career has been downhill ever since and marred by a number of incidents both off and on the court.

Kaitlyn is the daughter of former NRL star Sean Hoppe, who was the league's leading try scorer in 1995.

A former real estate agent and model, she entered The Bachelor as an intruder in episode two, but was eliminated on Thursday night.
