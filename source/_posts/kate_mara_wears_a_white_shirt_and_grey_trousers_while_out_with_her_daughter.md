In May she celebrated her daughter's first birthday while staying in lockdown in Los Angeles with husband Jamie Bell.

And Kate Mara stepped out with her little one, whose name she has not released publicly, as they enjoyed a stroll in Los Angeles, California, on Thursday.

The House Of Cards star, 37, put on a casual display for the coffee-run as she tucked in an oversized white shirt into grey jogging bottoms.

Kate completed her look by stepping out in a pair of white trainers, and she kept her personal items in a straw handbag.

Kate pulled her brunette locks back into a tight bun, and she kept safe amid the coronavirus crisis by wearing a surgical face mask.

The actress shielded her eyes with a pair of chic shades, and accessorised her relaxed look with a simple pendant necklace. 

Kate's little one looked adorable in a white baby romper, while she also wore a pair of white velcro trainers.

With Kate out running errands, she was without her husband Jamie, 34, with whom she has spent most of the year in lockdown. 

Kate announced the arrival of her little girl at the end of May 2019 on social media. Alongside a sweet photo she penned: 'We had a baby a couple weeks ago... Here are her feet.'

The couple first met as co-stars in Fantastic Four and began dating in 2015, before getting engaged in January 2017.

Kate and Jamie married in July 2017 and now split their time between Los Angeles and New York.

While the couple's daughter is the first child for Kate, she is Jamie's second child.

The former child star shares a son, who is six, with actress ex-wife Evan Rachel Wood, 32. The couple were married from 2012 to 2014.
