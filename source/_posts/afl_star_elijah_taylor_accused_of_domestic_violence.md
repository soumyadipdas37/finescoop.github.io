A young footy star who snuck his teenage girlfriend into the AFL's hub is now facing an investigation over allegations of domestic violence.

Elijah Taylor is being investigated by his team the Sydney Swans and the AFL after an Instagram post by his now ex-girlfriend Lekahni Pearce late on Saturday night. 

Taylor, 19, was already suspended for the rest of the 2020 season for sneaking Ms Pearce, 18, into his team's Perth hub just last month. 

The Sydney Swans posted a statement late on Saturday saying they were 'aware' of the 'very serious' allegations made online by Ms Pearce.

'The Sydney Swans are aware of allegations made on social media regarding first year player Elijah Taylor,' the statement read.

'The allegations are very serious and are being treated as such.

'The club has notified the AFL and is not in a position to comment further at this time.'

Drafted with pick 36 in the 2019 AFL Draft, Taylor played four games in his first year before being suspended over the COVID-19 biosecurity breach.

Taylor's senior teammates reportedly discovered Ms Pearce in the hotel premises and raised the alarm.

She had reportedly crossed a golf course and jumped two fences to be reunited with her then boyfriend. 

Ms Pearce had just completed her own mandatory self-quarantine period after flying in from Sydney.

Taylor was sent home in the aftermath of the scandal, while his club was fined a total of $50,000 - with $25,000 suspended.

Swans coach John Longmire said the Western Australian-raised AFL talent had been specifically reminded about the strict protocols before he travelled to Perth.

'We talked to Elijah specifically before we left and made sure that we all understand what environment we're going into,' Longmire told Fox Sports AFL 360.

'He still made a very poor choice, he still made a decision to deliberately breach the quarantine and it's unacceptable, and the ramifications are very much suited to what he did.'

'It was a decision that put so much at risk. He's only a young player, he's in his first year of AFL footy, but it was still a terrible decision that has big ramifications.'
