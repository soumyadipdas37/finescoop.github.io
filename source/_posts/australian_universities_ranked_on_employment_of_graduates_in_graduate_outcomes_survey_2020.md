It may not be among the most prominent of our tertiary institutions but Australian Catholic University has come out top in a new survey measuring how readily graduates find jobs.

The 2020 Graduate Outcomes Survey assessed students who finished their studies in 2017 from 79 different institutions, the highest participation ever.

It measured not only which institutions did best, but which degrees.

A survey has revealed the universities with the highest employment rates after graduation across the country (stock)

The Australian Catholic University (Strathfield, NSW, campus pictured) has the best employment rate for undergraduates three years after they finish university with 95.5 per cent of students now in jobs

'Three years after graduation there has been substantial improvement in full-time employment rates across universities so that all universities have full-time employment rates for undergraduates above 81 per cent,' the study said.

Twelve of the universities full-time employment rates increased by 20 per cent over the three-year period. 

The courses with the highest employment rates mid-term are:

The courses with the lowest employment rates short-term are: 

The Australian Catholic University (ACU) has the best employment rate for undergraduates three years after they finish university with 95.5 per cent of students now in full-time jobs.

Next came Australian National University and the nearby University of Canberra.

As well as graduates ,ACU also took out the top spot for those who completed their postgraduate studies in 2017.

On the postgraduate score, ACU was top, followed by Federation University Australia and The University of Notre Dame Australia.

In terms of fields of study, medicine graduates performed best, with 97.3 of those with a medical degree being employed three years after completing their course. 

Engineering fared almost as well at 96.3 per cent, while mathematics was the third best degree in terms of medium-term employability.

But it was not all good news for STEM graduates, with short-term employability - classed as those in work a year after graduation - being lowest for biology, science technology and general science and mathematics. 

The survey found average pay for graduates had risen only marginally when accounting for inflation, from $67,000 in 2016 to $75,000 in 2020.
