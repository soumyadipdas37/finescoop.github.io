Less than a month after announcing their shock split, Kayla Itsines and former fiancé Tobi Pearce were spotted out separately in Adelaide on Sunday.

The 29-year-old fitness queen was seen shopping with a friend at Unley Shopping Centre, and seemed to be in good spirits despite her recent breakup.

Smiling, Kayla showed off her incredible abs in a pair of black Nike sports shorts, which she teamed with a cropped white sweatshirt.

Her long brunette hair was worn in a high ponytail, and she rounded out her sporty ensemble with a pair of white Adidas tube socks and white sneakers.

The health conscious star was seen buying some juices at the supermarket, and later checked her phone as she walked alongside her friend and two young children.

Meanwhile, Tobi was spotted stopping by the home he once shared with Kayla, where he picked up their 17-month-old daughter, Arna Leia. 

He appeared downcast during the visit to the home.

A posting on realestate.com.au on September 2 revealed Kayla and her former partner were selling their sprawling property in South Australia. 

The stunning home in Malvern boasts spacious open-plan living, and while no price guide was offered, they were asking prospective buyers for 'best offers'.

Built on 3,193 square metres, the property features a tennis court, solar-heated swimming pool, 'fully-equipped alfresco pavilion', self-contained studio and cellar.

While Kayla wasn't home at the time, her mother, Anna, was on hand to greet Tobi and hand Arna over to her dad.

Keeping his head down as he left the property, Tobi was dressed casually in a pair of black Nike track pants, which he paired with a black Adidas hooded sweatshirt.

He also wore a tan coloured baseball cap and white sneakers, with Anna trailing behind him holding the little girl.

Later, Tobi and Arna visited Burnside Village shopping centre, with the little girl walking alongside her dad as he held her hand. 

Kayla and Tobi announced their split on Instagram on August 21, leaving fans of the fitness entrepreneur shocked.

The former couple created a global fitness empire estimated to be worth $696million.

'After eight years together, Tobi and I have come to the difficult decision to separate as a couple. We will always be family, and remain good friends and devoted parents to Arna,' she wrote on Instagram at the time. 

'We have grown up together in Adelaide, sharing a lifetime of experiences and special memories from moving into our first apartment and starting SWEAT from our lounge room to becoming parents to our beautiful daughter. 

'Our friendship remains strong as we parent Arna together and run SWEAT as business partners. Thank you for your support and kindness during this time.'

After meeting in late 2012, the pair launched the Bikini Body Training Company and went on to amass a following of more than 20 million fitness enthusiasts worldwide thanks to their workouts, app and health books.

They launched the SWEAT app in May 2017, creating the largest online community for women's fitness, and netting them more than $400million in just one year.  

The pair were named joint fifth on the Australian Financial Review's Young Rich List in 2018, making them the wealthiest self-made 20-somethings in Australia.
