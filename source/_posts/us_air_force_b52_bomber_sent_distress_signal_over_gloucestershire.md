A US Air Force B-52 bomber has sent out a distress signal after a mid-air emergency over Gloucestershire, it has been reported. 

The aircraft transmitted a 'squawk code 770, indicating general emergency, near Tewkesbury, UK', according to FlightRadar 24.

It is not clear what the incident was but planes regularly send out emergency distress signals for even minor problems.

Two of the giant planes flew over central Gloucester, towards Hartpury, Ashleworth and Tewkesbury, before coming back round over Up Hatherley, Shurdington, Brockworth Hucclecote and Barnwood. 

The nuclear-capable planes can each deliver 30 tons of bombs, missiles and mines. They're also protected by a remote control cannon.
