Aston Villa have sealed the £16m signing of Nottingham Forest full-back Matty Cash after beating off competition from their Premier League rivals. 

The Midlands outfit had a number of bids rejected for the 23-year-old but finally reached a breakthrough in talks with Forest this week. 

Now Dean Smith's side have now wrapped up the deal despite interest from the likes of Fulham and Sheffield United.

Smith said Cash had the potential to be a top star and believes he will have no problems gelling into the first team. 

'We are delighted to welcome Matty to Villa and believe we have secured one of England's brightest young prospects.

'He has an excellent playing record for a young player and we believe he will settle in easily and continue his rapid development into a top full-back.'
