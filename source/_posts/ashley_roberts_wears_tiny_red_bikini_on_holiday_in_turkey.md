Ashley was putting her breathtaking figure on full display for the impromptu shoot as she posed up a storm while thanking Mother Nature for her surroundings. 

She scraped her blonde hair into a high bun with tendrils surrounding her face, as she shared another shot with her arms lifted above her head. 

She added a caption on the duo of snaps reading: 'She holy hunni. How beautiful?! Here’s to looking and hoping for a brighter rest of 2020 #wecanhope #adventure #motherearth #grateful'

Ashley revealed earlier this month she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future. Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption.

Open and honest: Ashley revealed earlier this month she is open to the idea of adopting a child in the future. Speaking in an interview with Fabulous magazine, she said: 'I'm definitely open to the idea of adoption

'You just never know what the future is going to bring and the most important thing is to be happy and, whether my body naturally has kids or not, we'll see what life brings. I'm definitely open to that.'   

Ashley also reflected on dating following her split from Italian Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice, 29. 

The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018.

Red hot: She scraped her blonde hair into a high bun with tendrils surrounding her face, as she shared another shot with her arms lifted above her head

She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.' 

She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.' 

Ashley previously revealed she tried to freeze her eggs a couple of years ago, but the process didn't work.
