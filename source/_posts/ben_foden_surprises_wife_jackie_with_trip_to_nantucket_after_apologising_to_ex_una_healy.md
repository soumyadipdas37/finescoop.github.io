Ben Foden surprised his wife Jackie and their four-month-old baby daughter Farrah with a surprise anniversary trip to Nantucket, where they wed last August. 

Jackie took to Instagram on Sunday to share a slew of holiday snaps of the family at the beach alongside the caption: 'Thank you for such a lovely surprise anniversary trip Benny'.

It comes after the rugby player, 35, admitted it was 'wrong' to marry Jackie on the day his divorce from ex-wife Una Healy, 38, was granted.

Ben and Jackie packed on the PDA in the photos, with one showing the pair sunbathing on beach towels. 

In another snap the couple held hands as they walked Farrah along the pier.

She wrote: 'Happy 4 months to my beach baby... thank you for such a lovely surprise anniversary trip Benny'.

The holiday comes as Ben expressed his remorse about not showing more sensitivity to Una on the day their divorce was granted. 

The rugby ace, married Una in June 2012 after four years of dating, but their marriage ended in 2018 after he allegedly cheated on her with PR girl Becky Milne, who denied the claims.

Just one year later, Ben created shockwaves when he married his second wife Jackie on board a luxury yacht in Nantucket, Massachusetts, just two weeks after they started dating. 

The US socialite announced her pregnancy soon after, and the couple welcomed their daughter Farrah Abra Foden in May this year, born three weeks early following health complications. 

Speaking in a candid interview with TV presenter Sharon Carpenter on Instagram Live last week, Ben admitted he did not act in a particularly kind way towards Una.    

'I hold my hands up and say, it was wrong,' he said. 'My final decree didn't even come through until the morning of us getting married.'

The former England rugby player nonetheless maintained he had no regrets.     

'People will say I wasn't very ­respectful in what I did, getting married to Jackie very quickly, but you can't help the heart and we've got past it.'

The couple now live in America, where they are raising Farrah.

Ben also co-parents a daughter Aoife, eight, and son Tadhg, five, with Una.

Ben also described the period after he split from Una in his interview with Sharon Carpenter. 

He said: 'I did a lot of dating. I went a bit crazy for about six-seven months, on a few of the well known apps. I had a lot of fun.

'When I met Jackie, she was like no one I've ever met before in so many departments. She's very independent, very free-spirited. 

 'She was at a point where she was like, "I want to meet someone and get married and have kids". Even though in my head I was like, "Oh I don't really want to do that" I knew she'd make such a good mum.

'I knew she'd be really kind and respectful to my other kids from my other marriage.'
