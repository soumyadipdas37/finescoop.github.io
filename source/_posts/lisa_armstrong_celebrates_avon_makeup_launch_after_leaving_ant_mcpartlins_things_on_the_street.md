Lisa Armstrong put on a glamorous display to attend to launch of her much-anticipated Avon cosmetics range on Tuesday.

The makeup artist, 43, took to Instagram to share snaps from the virtual event just hours after leaving her ex Ant McPartlin's unwanted possessions on the street for people to take.

Lisa has named her new cosmetics line after the pals who supported her through her split from presenter Ant. The former couple split in 2018 after 12 years of marriage.

Lisa looked chic in a simple black blouse as she posed at the launch of her makeup range, with her blonde bob in a simple slicked-back style.

The Strictly Come Dancing makeup artist also shared a selfie from the event with details about which products she used from her line.

She penned the caption: 'Such a fun day launching my new make-up range to Avon's representatives and sales leaders. Was great to virtually meet you all, comment below if you were watching.....'

On Monday Lisa said a final goodbye to her ex Ant by leaving his unwanted possessions on the pavement for passers-by to take.

She placed the goods in boxes marked 'help yourself' and put them outside her west London property as she prepares to move out of the marital home she formerly shared with her ex.

The items were easily identifiable as Ant's because they included his Newcastle United shirts and a 'Team Ant' foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway.

There was also Ant's old dressing gown and a pile of board games.

Lisa, who received £31 million in her divorce settlement from Ant, was also throwing out a bowl used by labrador, Hurley, as well as a Banksy artwork calendar and a Jamie Oliver book. 

A source told The Sun that Lisa is leaving her West London house and wanted a 'big clear out.'

They added: 'Ant had already sifted through what he wanted to keep and had gophers collect them in recent weeks.

'What was left is being offered for free. His bathrobe has been taken. Footie memorabilia has also been given away. But it was the end for his Newcastle shirts.'

Another source said: 'Some of it is Ant's, some of it is Lisa's and some of it they bought together.' 

On Tuesday, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said he did not agree with Lisa's decision to throw out these possessions, even though she is divorced.

He was particularly astonished to see she had thrown out his book, though later in the show revealed she had contacted him to apologise.

Lisa split from Ant in 2018 after 12 years of marriage, and is now reported to be dating James Green. 

Lisa and Ant finalised their divorce back in April after their split in January 2018 following the presenter's highly documented battle with painkillers and alcohol.

The Saturday Night Takeaway star has continued his relationship with his former personal assistant and girlfriend of two years, Anne-Marie Corbett, 43.  

However last month Lisa appeared to confirm that she was dating her new lover James, after fans reached out on Twitter to congratulate her on the happy news.

Meanwhile, Lisa has also named her new cosmetics range after the pals who supported her following her split from Ant.
