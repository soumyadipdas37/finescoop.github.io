The happy couple were supposed to say 'I do' this year, but the global pandemic and staying in quarantine put a halt to their wedding planning. 

'It did affect it a little bit,' Lopez told Ellen DeGeneres in April. 'So we'll see what happens now. I really don't know what's gonna happen now as far as dates or anything like that.

'We are just kind of in a holding pattern like the rest of the world. So, again, it's just something we have to wait and see in a few months how this all pans out.'

Later that month, Alex told Jimmy Fallon that everything was a little more 'fluid' when it comes to planning their big day.

'We have to go with the flow now,' he said. 'Everything is fluid, everything's on just a pause. Obviously this is an unprecedented time, and for us, we just want to make sure that we think safety first and make sure that all the little ones are in a good place.'
