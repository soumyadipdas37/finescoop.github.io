Katie Price has penned a touching tribute to her terminally ill mum Amy as she marked Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Awareness Week on Thursday.

The former glamour model, 42, shared a post urging fans to donate to a charity appeal to fund research into the condition, which currently has no cure.

Amy was diagnosed with IPF in 2017 and was unable to visit Katie after being asked to shield during the COVID-19 pandemic, though the pair were able to reunite in June.

Katie first shared a pair of snaps alongside her mum from a recent holiday together, with the pair embracing in front of stunning beach views.

The star then reminded fans that they could donate to support life-saving research into IPF, which causes progressive and irreversible scarring of the lungs.

Katie went onto share a family selfie of herself alongside mum Amy, sister Sophie and brother Daniel.

She wrote: 'There are no words to express the love that my brother, sister @sophie_pricey and I have for our mum. As you know, this is something that's very close to my heart because my mum suffers from this condition. 

'This week is IPF week. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a lung condition that scars your lungs and reduces the efficiency of your breathing. 

'Approximately 6500 people are diagnosed with IPF every year. The @britishlungfoundation is asking for your support to help fund vital research and offer those with IPF hope for the future. See my latest story post for the link.'

In recent months Amy has been shielding from her family to protect herself during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Katie only able to see her mum through the window.

The pair were finally reunited in June after 10 weeks apart, though the star was unable to hug her mum as per social distancing rules.

After being diagnosed with IPF, Amy revealed she'd made the decision to move to Spain for the colder winter months in a bid to improve her declining health.

She said in April 2019: 'Late January I was suffering so much with the cold weather. I went to Spain and some friends found me a tiny little apartment by the sea.

'The warmer weather makes me feel much better. If I go walking in the U.K. I do 2,000 steps whereas in Spain I can do 10,000 steps and I don't cough.'

Katie also spoke at the time about how she first reacted to her mum's diagnosis, saying: 'The first time we appeared on the show I was crying. I couldn't cope and when you hear "terminal" you think she's not gone long left.'

Speaking about how IPF, a rare condition that causes progressive and irreversible scarring of the lungs, has progressed, Amy said: 'I’m not too bad. I went for tests this week with the transplant team, they keep an eye on me, my lung function tests have dropped a little bit but that’s to be expected with what I have got because it is a progressive illness.

'But they do all the tests on the other organs in your body to prepare you for when they think you need a transplant - I’m not yet [on the transplant list] - and what they do is that they look at everything to make sure you can cope with it - your heart, liver and your kidneys and all that - and they are still 100 percent, they are fine.

'So at the moment they go, "You are too healthy, go and enjoy yourself. And come back in six months."'

Katie has also said when the family first discovered Amy's diagnosis, she tried to offer her mum a lung.

'She wouldn't ever let me because I have kids but it's not that easy. There's not that many on the transplant list, they have to wait until you're nearly dead,' she said.

Amy told the panel she was hoping to go on a research drug because it 'wouldn't make her condition any worse.'
