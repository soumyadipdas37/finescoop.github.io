She recently shared a series of racy selfies that drew attention to her eye-popping cleavage.

But on Wednesday, Married At First Sight's Cathy Evans exposed a troll who mocked her appearance in the photos. 

The 26-year-old flaunted her ample assets in a black lacy bra and an unbuttoned white shirt as she spruiked a lingerie company on Tuesday.

'Why does it concern you?' Married At First Sight's Cathy Evans exposed a troll and slammed them for mocking her appearance after she shared a series of racy selfies 

But in the comments section a troll commented: 'wtf is wrong with her nose,' along with a laughing emoji. 

Cathy captured an image of the comment and shared it on her Instagram story, along with a message slamming the troll.

She wrote: 'wtf is wrong with your outlook on women's faces. 

 'Why does it concern you home my nose looks? What's worse is that this girl follows me to spew hate.'

Hitting back: The troll commented, 'wtf is wrong with her nose,' along with a laughing emoji. Cathy captured an image of the comment and shared it on her Instagram story and slammed the troll, saying: 'wtf is wrong with your outlook on women's faces'

The reality TV beauty ended her message by telling the troll: 'Focus your energy on other places.' 

On Tuesday, malicious messages from the keyboard warrior were far from Cathy's mind when she shared her raunchy photos.

She left little to the imagination in the photos of herself as she posed seductively in her lingerie.

In the images, Cathy wore her blonde locks loose in beachy waves and a full face of makeup, including a smokey eye bold brows and nude lips.

The racy post comes after she debuted her new boyfriend, Richard, in a loved-up Instagram post last week.

She shared an illustration of the couple created by T & D Collective, and explained in the caption that she won't be sharing many photos of Richard because he's a very private person.

Richard's face can't be made out in the drawing, presumably because he wants to keep his identity a secret, but he appears to have a beard and a sleeve tattoo.   

The reality star met police officer Richard shortly after filming Nine's social experiment, but this marks the first time she has shared a photo of him on Instagram.

Cathy was married to Josh Pihlak on the reality series, but the couple ended their relationship during the season after she clashed with his mother.
