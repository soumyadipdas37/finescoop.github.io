Highlighting her enviable legs, the TV and radio star's ensemble allowed her to soak up the sun.

The media personality opted for comfort when it came to her footwear choice as she wore a white trainer on her right foot, while her injured foot was protected in the mobility aid.

On Monday, the broadcaster revealed to MailOnline that her injury has now forced her to abandon plans to take part in the virtual London Marathon.

She said: 'A few weeks ago I sustained a stress fracture on my 3rd metatarsal. Frustratingly it’s very hard to spot on an X-ray and so it took quite a while to diagnose.

'Anyway, it happened six weeks ago and thankfully it is repairing well so I have to wear a support boot whilst I’m walking around to limit further damage until it fully mends.

'It was a consequence of excessive running in lockdown whilst preparing for the virtual London marathon. Sadly it means I can no longer run on October 4th but should be back running home from work in a month!'

Away from radio it was recently announced that the health conscious star is the face and voice of newly launched fitness app Start 2 Run.

The app is ideal for people who need help getting started running as well as people who want to up their running mileage or aim for a particular running distance goal.

Users will have Jenni with them for all their training sessions, encouraging and motivating, as well as providing tips and pointers.
