Swiss watchdog Finma has opened so-called enforcement proceedings against Credit Suisse

Switzerland's financial regulator is investigating the spying scandal at Credit Suisse.

Swiss watchdog Finma opened so-called enforcement proceedings against the lender.

Credit Suisse became embroiled in a spying affair last year,after it emerged that individuals at the bank had authorised private investigators to track former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan and former human resources head Peter Goerke.

Credit Suisse’s own probe concluded the surveillance had been initiated by then-chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee. 

Boss Tidjane Thiam resigned in February adamant he did not know about the spying but admitting it had caused anxiety and pain.
