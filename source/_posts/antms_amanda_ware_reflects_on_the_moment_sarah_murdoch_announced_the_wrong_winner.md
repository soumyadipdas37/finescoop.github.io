Kelsey Martinovich was mistakenly announced as the winner of Australia's Next Top Model by host Sarah Murdoch in 2010.

And a decade on, the real winner Amanda Ware has reflected on the epic live TV gaffe with podcast, Back From Reality. 

The model, 28, revealed that on stage she could hear producers screaming into Sarah's ear piece that she got the announcement wrong. 

'I still cringe to this day': Australia's Next Top Model's Amanda Ware has reflected on the moment host Sarah Murdoch announced the WRONG winner on the show

'She (Sarah) goes sheet white... I was scared she was going to keel over, and I could hear them saying the winner is Amanda. 

'And so Kelsey's obviously started making her speech, the fireworks have gone off. Honestly, I still cringe today. Even you saying it - my heart drops,' she told host Gabrielle Scawthorn.

Amanda continued: 'I don't think we realised that we couldn't film it again, I don't know about Kelsey or Sarah. I just know it's the most shocking moment.

'10 years on... I can't even watch it': The model, 28, said, 'I don't think we realised that we couldn't film it again, I don't know about Kelsey or Sarah. I just know it's the most shocking moment'

'Even today, I think it's still on Germany's top ten worst moments of TV ever,' she laughed.

Elsewhere, the Brisbane-born beauty said: 'It's still cringeworthy, even now, 10 years on... I can't even watch it... it's so embarrassing.

She added that the moment wasn't embarrassing for herself or Kelsey, saying: 'We didn't stuff up, there's nothing to say we did anything wrong, which is why I'm still sane today. 

'It wasn't our stuff up': She added that the moment wasn't embarrassing for herself or Kelsey, saying: 'There's nothing to say we did anything wrong, which is why I'm still sane today' 

'But I guess that's what you can take away from it, it wasn't our stuff up,' she concluded.

Amanda also revealed that the iconic ANTM gaffe has still stuck with her a decade on, and says it didn't have a 'detrimental impact' on her career. 

'[In] modelling you can kind of fall between the cracks quite easily, and as they kept saying on the show "be a blank canvas", "you can be anything" - but it kind of means boring.

'It helped me stand out from the crowd': Amanda concluded, '[In] modelling you can kind of fall between the cracks quite easily, and as they kept saying on the show "be a blank canvas", "you can be anything" - but it kind of means boring'

'I know that sounds a bit w***y, but moving on in my career that's what I kinda felt helped me stand out from the crowd was the show,' she said.

Since winning the show in 2010, Amanda has continued her successful modelling career, posing for the likes of Hervé Léger, Monique Lhuillier and Kenzo. 

In October 2019, she married British director Jack Lawrence in a lavish ceremony in Hawaii.
