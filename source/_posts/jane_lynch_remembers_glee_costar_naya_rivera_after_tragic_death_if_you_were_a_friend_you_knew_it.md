Jane Lynch is preparing for another fun project, as she hosts NBC's reboot of The Weakest Link, premiering Tuesday.

But the five-time Emmy Award winner's new role comes as she mourns the loss of a 'loyal' and 'protective' friend.

She recently remembered her friendship with Glee costar Naya Rivera, as she promoted her show on People (the TV Show), following the late actress's tragic drowning death back in July.

The 60-year-old said: 'The greatest thing about Naya Rivera was that she would be the first one to speak up if something was happening that wasn't right, that wasn't fair, that was cruel. If you were a friend of hers, you knew it, you could feel it.'

She continued: 'Just such a fierce force of nature that girl was. It's a great loss. It's a great loss for all of us.'

Naya's body was discovered July 13 in Lake Piru in Ventura County, California, five days after she went missing during a swim with son Josey.

She was 33 years old at the time of her death, leaving behind her five-year-old with his father Ryan Dorsey, 37, to whom she was married from 2014 to 2018.

The cause of death was ruled to be a drowning, and it was recently determined that the manner of death was accidental. 

Jane previously reminisced about Naya last month on The Today Show: 'My niece Megan was very close with Naya, and Megan always said that with Naya you felt like somebody had your back. She was somebody who wasn't going to let anybody mess with you.'

Niece Megan Doyle, who was an assistant on the Glee tour in 2009, shared a tribute to the Devious Maids actress on Instagram, after the news broke in July.

She wrote: 'She took me under her wing. Brought me into her crew. It didn’t matter that I was a lowly assistant at the time. When I think of my first four years in Los Angeles, I think of Naya.

Friend of the family: Jane previously reminisced about Naya last month on The Today Show: 'My niece Megan was very close with Naya, and Megan always said that with Naya you felt like somebody had your back'

'Being in Naya’s presence made me feel larger than life. It was like anxious Megan absorbed Naya’s fearless spirit by osmosis. When you were around her, you just . . . bloomed.'

Naya starred in Glee for the entirety of its run from 2009 to 2015 as Santana Lopez, a feisty high school cheerleader who came out as lesbian and married her best friend Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris).

Jane also reflected on the impact that moment left on the LGBTQ community: 'She was a great advocate and loved the fact that she and Heather Morris had the lesbian relationship on the show and how much that meant to so many young people.'

The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel actress has long been an out lesbian, revealing on SiriusXM back in 2016 that she never had an official coming out moment.

Jane recently revealed to ET Online that the character has stuck with her over the years, especially on her newest gig. 

She said: 'I always say that Sue Sylvester lives about a quarter of an inch below the skin, below the surface that you see here. 

'So I just kinda scratch her out and she can come out like the ride of the Valkyries... She's definitely in attendance when I'm doing The Weakest Link.'
