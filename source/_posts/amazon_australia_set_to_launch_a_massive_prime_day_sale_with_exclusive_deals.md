Amazon Australia is set to launch its epic Prime Day 2020 event, with prices slashed on tens of thousands of products from big brands and small local businesses.

Shoppers will get the first access to the biggest global shopping event of the year, with exclusive deals running from 12am on Tuesday, October 13. 

Amazon Prime members can expect huge savings savings across all categories including fashion, beauty, kitchen gadgets, electronics, food and drink and toys.

The annual event runs worldwide for two days but deals available through the global store ends at 6pm on Thursday, October 15, so Australians will get 66 hours to shop.

Country manager for Amazon Australia Matt Furlong said this year's event will feature small local businesses on Prime Day so shoppers can support homegrown brands.

'We're excited to offer Australian Prime members the chance to access fantastic savings across tens of thousands of products from international and Aussie brands across all categories for Prime Day this year,' Mr Furlong said.

'In addition, to help customers discover more local brands... we are proud to put small Australian businesses front and centre through our "Shop Local" store.'
