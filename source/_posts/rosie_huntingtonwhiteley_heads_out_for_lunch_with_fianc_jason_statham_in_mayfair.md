The trip to the U.K no doubt comes as a welcome break to Rosie, who recently admitted that she frequently comes under pressure to have invasive procedures in Los Angeles, where she lives, but she doesn't want to do anything 'extreme' to her body.

She told the Daily Mail's Eden Confidential column: 'I don't like to try anything extreme. I'm cautious, especially in LA where people are like, "Do you want breakfast and Botox?" and I'm like, "Uh, no. I'll take the breakfast and you can keep the Botox".'

However, Rosie - who has son Jack, three, with partner Jason Statham, 53 - admitted the one thing she never worries about is her famous pout.

She explained: 'I never worry about my lips. They stay in good shape.'
