Michael Strahan's beloved father Gene has died at the age of 83.

The retired football star's colleagues at Good Morning America took time during their Friday broadcast to honor the life of Gene and send their condolences to their colleague.

The touching tribute came on the same day that the late veteran was being laid to rest.

RIP: Michael Strahan's beloved father Gene has died at the age of 83 

This morning, we're celebrating the life of Michael Strahan's father Gene Willie Strahan who will be laid to rest today,' GMA tweeted. 'Our thoughts are with his family during this time.'

GMA host Amy Robach read a touching eulogy to honor Gene, Michael and their family during a difficult time. 

'We wanted to take a moment to say our thoughts and our prayers are with our colleague Michael Strahan and his family. His father Gene Willie Strahan Sr. is being laid to rest today,' the anchor said.  

Michael was, understandably, not on Friday's episode of GMA and has yet to comment on the sad loss.
