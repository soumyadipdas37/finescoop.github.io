Sophie has been a cast member for slightly longer than Patrick, having portrayed Ziggy Astoni since June 2017.

In the beginning, their characters Dean and Ziggy didn't get along. But over time they became close friends, and eventually, lovers.

Similarly, Sophie and Patrick's romantic relationship seems to have blossomed from a friendship, simply achieved by spending time together.
