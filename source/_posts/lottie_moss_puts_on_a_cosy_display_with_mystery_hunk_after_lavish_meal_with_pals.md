Lottie Moss was seen putting on a cosy display with a mystery hunk on Thursday night, following a lavish meal with friends in London.

The 22-year-old model and her companion arrived at Kensington's Nam Long Le Shaker restaurant and bar shortly before midnight and were seen hugging amid their multiple cigarette breaks outside the popular venue.

At one point, the man was seen placing an arm around Lottie as they chatted among themselves while standing with a large group of friends.
