They have been here for two months living on-site at cricket grounds from Worcester to Southampton but at the last Pakistan finally gained a victory from their bio-secure tour.

It looked as though Moeen Ali, in the worst form of his international career, was somehow going to conjure up a match-winning performance to give England a 2-0 Twenty20 series victory on the Emirates Old Trafford ground where they won the first Test.

But once Moeen had fallen for a brilliant 61 off 33 balls England were destined to fall short of Pakistan’s 190 for four, a result confirmed when Tom Curran could only hit one of the two sixes England needed off the last two balls from Haris Rauf.

A 1-1 drawn short-form series was no more than Pakistan deserved after their unfortunate defeat in the ‘Miracle of Manchester’ first Test and then two rain ruined Tests and a first Twenty20 game also destroyed by the elements.

Pakistan had put another highly competitive score on the board with half centuries from batsmen at opposite ends of their careers in teenage debutant Haider Ali and the 39-year-old veteran Mohammad Hafeez.

Haider is one of those who has been in the country two months without playing a game but how the 19-year-old made up for lost time when he was finally handed his Pakistan debut.

The teenager made a name for himself in the last Pakistan Super League by hitting 14 sixes in the tournament for Peshawar and now he immediately showed his class by striking his second ball in international cricket from Moeen over the long-on boundary.

It was a sign of things to come as Haider eased his way to becoming the first Pakistan batsman to reach a half-century in his first appearance, his 50 coming off 28 balls.

Only when Haider hit Lewis Gregory just over Sam Billings, who had advanced into no-man’s land from the mid-wicket boundary, did he show any sign of faltering before he was finally bowled by a perfect Chris Jordan yorker. No matter. A star is surely born.

The youth of Haider could not be in greater contrast to his partner in a stand of 100 for the third wicket in the veteran figure of Hafeez, who is prolific form himself.

Haider had not even been born when Hafeez made his first-class debut and was only two when the senior man made his Pakistan debut but the 39-year-old kept pace with his young team-mate before surpassing him on his way to an unbeaten 86 off 52 balls.

Hafeez struck six sixes in his third successive half-century, three of them coming off the unusually ineffective figure of Adil Rashid who was smashed for 40 in his three overs and was not given a fourth.

England, in truth, were not at their best again in the field and will look forward to welcoming back the big guns of Jofra Archer and Mark Wood to their attack for the first of six white-ball matches against Australia at the Ageas Bowl on Friday.

Billings error paled into insignificance compared to a bad drop by Curran off Imad Wasim’s first ball while much of the bowling again lacked England’s usual potency.

Gregory looked a shade below the level required to maintain a place in England’s white-ball set-up while Curran’s yorker to bowl Babar Azam was a rare superb delivery.

Moeen did take his first wicket for England this summer with his very first ball but was restricted to just the single over while the pick of the attack was England’s most experienced death bowler in Jordan.

England got off to the worst possible start in reply when Jonny Bairstow was cleaned up third ball by a rapid yorker he barely saw from Shaheen Afridi, who will go on from here to play Twenty20 Blast cricket for Hampshire.

Dawid Malan desperately needed another big score to stay in the side against Australia but after a lovely lofted drive for four off Imad he tried to strike his next ball over the short boundary and was expertly caught by Fakhar Zaman.

It did not seem to be a problem for England while Tom Banton and Eoin Morgan were together as England looked to pull off another seemingly challenging chase with relative ease.

But the game turned on the dismissal of both within seven balls, Banton running out his captain, hardly the greatest of career moves, before being trapped in front by the extreme pace of Rauf. The only surprise was that Pakistan needed a review to gain the decision as umpire David Milnes inexplicably ruled Banton not out.

Billings and Gregory both fell in the chase and when Moeen, who had only made 10 runs from his last four innings, lobbed up a caught and bowled chance to Wahab Riaz, another Pakistan player making his first appearance of the tour, the game was up for England. It is the first series in any format England haven’t won in this unique summer but it was one that Pakistan thoroughly deserved to share. Now for the Aussies.
