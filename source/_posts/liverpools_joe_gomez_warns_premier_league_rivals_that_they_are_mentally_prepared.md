Liverpool defender Joe Gomez has warned their Premier League rivals that the team is 'hungrier than ever' after being crowned champions last campaign.

The Merseyside club ended their 30-year wait for a top-flight title this summer, which built on their Champions League triumph from the season before.

Jurgen Klopp's side suffered a penalty shootout defeat by Arsenal in the new season's curtain-raiser, the Community Shield, but Gomez has insisted Liverpool are mentally prepared for the 2020-21 campaign.

'More than anything, the gaffer instils in us that it's a mental battle more than physical half the time, so we'll be ready and we have a squad full of quality to rotate when needs be,' he told the club's official website.

'The main thing is, mentally we are ready to go. And I think everyone is hungrier than ever.'

Liverpool and the Gunners played out a 1-1 draw at Wembley on Saturday evening with Reds youngster Rhian Brewster the player to miss in the shootout.

But Gomez has conceded that there were both pluses and minuses from the clash as the Premier League season start draws closer.

'We created a fair few chances,' he added. 'Obviously we relied on that spark and Mo and Taki [Mohamed Salah and Takumi Minamino] provided that. There's positives to take, as well as things we can work on.'

Liverpool kick-start their Premier League title defence on Saturday, September 12 at home to newly-promoted Leeds.
