Alessandra Ambrosio was stylish as ever when she was pictured shopping in Brentwood this Thursday.

The 39-year-old, who recently returned to Los Angeles after a holiday to the Maldives, modeled a summery floral sundress.

Her frilly ensemble slid off the shoulder at one end and was cut high enough to show off her vertiginous supermodel legs.

Alessandra was a lady in red as she put her sizzling summer body on display for Instagram this Thursday with a throwback snap to her Maldives excursion.

The former Victoria's Secret Angel was pictured posing up a storm in a scarlet string bikini from Gal Florpia, the swimwear line she co-founded.

For her latest photo-shoot she got snapped on a tree-lined path at the Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi resort.

She let her floral wrap slide sultrily down her shoulders and accessorized the ensemble with a pair of sleek sunglasses.

'Ale,' as she is affectionately known to her fans, added a splash of dazzle with earrings, a necklace and an ankle bracelet.

The Brazilian bombshell swung a wicker and brown leather handbag and brushed her luxurious hair from her face.

Her outfit was put together by stylist to the stars Heather Smith who per her website has worked with names ranging from Jennifer Lopez to Martha Stewart.

Alessandra is on vacation with her 12-year-old daughter Anja and her eight-year-old son Noah whom she shares with her ex-fiance, RE/DONE founder Jamie Mazur.

The sizzling sensation, who hails from the Brazilian town of Erechim, has gone into lockdown with her Italian boyfriend Nicolo Oddi and her children.  

Alessandra rose to international fame as a Victoria's Secret Angel, announcing that she was giving up the title at the end of 2017.

She has collaborated with her sister Aline and a pal called Gisele Coria to launch Gal Floripa, which debuted last March.

The brand takes its title from a nickname for Florianopolis, the Brazilian city where Alessandra gave birth to both of her children.
