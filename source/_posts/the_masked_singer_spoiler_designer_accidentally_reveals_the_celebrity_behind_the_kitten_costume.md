Costume designer Tim Chappel has accidentally revealed who is behind the kitten costume for The Masked Singer. 

Chappel made the blunder when asked if he was told who he was designing the elaborate costumes for by journalist Deborah Knight on Channel Nine's radio show 2GB 873 on Monday afternoon. 

While the radio clip has now been removed by Nine, Tim's answer confirms the guesses of avid viewers who have made this particular star's name trend on Twitter.

A fan of the show added:  'I know, I felt sorry for him. Hope he doesn't get into strife. Kudos to @deborah_knight fir not getting anymore out of him.'

Another wrote: 'DID @deborah_knight just get to the bottom of one of the biggest mysteries in Australian TV? The IDENTITY of one of the @maskedsinger_au celebrities????'

While other fans tweeted the identity of the celebrity behind the kitten mask, Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to republish. 

Meanwhile, Deborah tried to divert the attention from the accidental reveal. 

She tweeted: 'He also confirmed they will be filming the grand final.'

'Grand finale!' Deborah tried to divert the attention from the accidental reveal.

On Monday, Judge Jackie 'O' Henderson initially confirmed that an in-studio finale has been scheduled.

 A coronavirus outbreak halted production of The Masked Singer earlier this month, less than two hours before the finale was set to begin.

The 45-year-old confirmed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show that she was 'glad' the cast and crew would get a chance to 'finish it properly'.
