Jeff Daniels has taken on the colossal role of Former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, in TV miniseries The Comey Rule. 

On Saturday, the actor shared his thoughts on Donald Trump and American politics ahead of the show's premiere. 

Speaking to The Courier Mail, the 65-year-old says he feels there is a fundamental difference between Comey and Trump.

'For Comey, justice is bigger, truth is bigger than anything else, and the FBI is bigger than he is, and on the other side. 

'Trump thinks the biggest thing in the world is himself, and doesn't think about anything past the end of his nose,' he said. 

Jeff added that he hopes the American public will vote differently in 2020 than than did in 2016.

He told the paper: 'I think Americans need to put their phones down and they need to get educated. 

'My optimism tells me that because of the last three-and-a-half years, we know a hell of a lot more about Trump than we did back in 2016. 

'I fully hope that the American public is paying a little bit more attention in October 2020 than they were in 2016.'   

Earlier this month, Showtime released a new trailer for its upcoming miniseries, The Comey Rule, painting President Trump as 'a mob boss' and referencing the infamous 'Golden showers' allegations against him.

The trailer offered a sneak peek at the highly-anticipated drama series based on former FBI director James Comey's memoir, A Higher Loyalty.

The show, which features actor Brendan Gleeson as the president and Jeff as Comey, is scheduled to air in two parts beginning on September 27.

The limited series follows Comey through the ethical challenges he faced as FBI director under Trump's presidency, amid the investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.  

In his book, Comey, who was fired as the FBI director by President Trump in May 2017, alleged Trump wanted him to investigate the allegation and to prove it was a lie.

The first night of the two-night, four-hour event will explore the earliest days in the Russia investigation and the FBI investigating Hillary Clinton's emails, and how they impacted election night when Trump shocked the world. 

Holly Hunter is also set to portray Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, William Sadler will play Michael Flynn, and Peter Coyote as Robert Mueller. 

The Comey Rule is available to stream on Stan in Australia.
