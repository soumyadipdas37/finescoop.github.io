She's expecting her second child with actor husband Josh Brolin.

And on Monday, Kathryn Brolin showed off her growing baby bump in an Instagram snap.

'6 months and counting,' she wrote in the caption alongside the mirror selfie in which she's wearing a bra and sweat pants and posing with daughter Westlyn, who turns two in November.

Kathryn, 32, is a former assistant to the 52-year-old Hollywood star and became his third wife in 2016.

The couple confirmed back in July that they are adding to their family.

A week ago, Kathryn revealed via her Instagram that she and her daughter Westlyn had upped sticks and moved away from California.

Sharing a photo of herself and her child in a cavernous empty room in their new home, she shared: 'The rest of the year brings a new adventure. Decided to skip out on our beloved Cali and move across the country.'

She then tagged her mom Deborah Boyd-Brown, who is a luxury real estate broker in Atlanta, Georgia, suggesting that she has moved to be closer to her mother as she awaits the birth of baby number two. 

On Friday, she posted a photo of Brolin gazing moodily out of a window as she celebrated his arrival to join her and their daughter, writing in the caption: 'Reunited with my person.'
