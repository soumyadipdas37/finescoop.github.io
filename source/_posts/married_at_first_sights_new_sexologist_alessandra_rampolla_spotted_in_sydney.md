Married At First Sight's new relationship expert has been pictured on the set of the series again.

She threw a dark blue denim jacket over the top and carried a shopping bag from Sephora in one hand.

The soon-to-be reality star appeared makeup free, indicating that she was probably on her way to get glammed up.

Married At First Sight 'expert' Dr Trisha Stratford announced she would be leaving the show after seven seasons earlier this month.

Taking her place, sexologist Alessandra will join Mel Schilling and John Aiken as the show's newest relationship expert in 2021.

The 46-year-old is already a huge name in her native Puerto Rico, boasting 680,000 Instagram followers and hosting her own show 'Dare with Alessandra'.

'I am thrilled to be joining John and Mel in Australia's biggest social experiment,' Alessandra said in a statement.

'With my particular expertise, I hope to contribute to the complex mix of components that ensure marriages not only work but thrive in the long haul.

'One of my strongest core beliefs is that sexual expression and compatibility are vital in building, nourishing and maintaining healthy romantic relationships, and it is my pleasure to help guide our participants in balancing this important factor in their brave quest for love.'

A quick look at her Instagram page shows that she likes to work out, go to the beach, play with her dog Lola and make regular expert appearances on Puerto Rican television.

Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Alessandra was educated in the US and holds a master's degree in marriage and family therapy.

She is now a clinical sexologist with over 20 years of experience and a number of published books.
