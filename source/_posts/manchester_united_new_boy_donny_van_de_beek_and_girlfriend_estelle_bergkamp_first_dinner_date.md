Donny van de Beek was spotted enjoying his new surroundings as the Manchester United new boy went on a date night with girlfriend Estelle Bergkamp on Wednesday evening. 

The 23-year-old joined Ole Gunner Solskjaer's side from Ajax this summer in a £40m deal from the Dutch side, becoming United's first and only signing of the window thus far. 

While it has been an unconventional time with coronavirus restrictions, Van De Beek managed to take in the scenery of Manchester as he and girlfriend Estelle, daughter of Arsenal icon Dennis Bergkamp, went out in the city for the first time.

Despite United losing their Premier League opener to Crystal Palace, Van de Beek made a positive impact from the bench, as he pulled a goal back to give his new side brief hope of a comeback.

Solskjaer rewarded the new boy's cameo with a starting place in the side that beat Luton Town 3-0 in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday evening.

Van de Beek will be hoping he will be handed his first Premier League start when United travel to Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday afternoon.
