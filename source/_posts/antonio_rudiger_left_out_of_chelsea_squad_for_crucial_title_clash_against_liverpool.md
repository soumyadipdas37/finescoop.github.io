Antonio Rudiger has not been included in today’s squad to face Liverpool - throwing his Chelsea future into doubt.

The Germany international is fully fit but manager Frank Lampard has not included the central defender in his plans to face the Premier League champions.

Rudiger was an unused substitute in the victory over Brighton on Monday night.

The decision throws into question Rudiger’s position in Lampard’s plans for the rest of the season.

And with the transfer deadline due to close on October 5, Rudiger could become the subject of interest from rival clubs.

Rudiger has two years left on his contract, but Chelsea - as of yet - have not tried to renegotiate an extension.

Rudiger reportedly helped persuade Timo Werner to join Chelsea as the Premier League side pulled off a major coup in the transfer market. 

The RB Leipzig star agreed a deal to join the west London club in a £53million move, seeing off strong contenders Liverpool in landing the 24-year-old.

And fans believe that Rudiger, who plays alongside the striker for their country, Germany, may have had a helping hand in securing the deal.   

According to Bild (via Metro), those rumours seem to be true as the German outlet reported that Rudiger played a 'key role' in convincing Werner to join Chelsea instead of Liverpool.

The publication claims that the defender followed Werner's decision-making closely and often gave him glowing reviews of life in west London. 

Rudiger and Werner have a strong friendship, having played in the youth set up for Germany as well as coming through together at Stuttgart. 

Rudiger is also believed to have helped the Blues sign Kai Havertz who joined the Chelsea this summer from Bayer Leverkusen in a £89million move and made his debut in the west Londoners' 3-1 win over Brighton last Monday.
