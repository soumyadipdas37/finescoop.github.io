Victoria's lockdown will be eased and Melbourne's curfew scrapped - while NSW has recorded no new cases overnight in welcome news in Australia's fight against COVID-19. 

Melbourne's all-important rolling 14-day case average dropped to 22.1 cases on Sunday while Victoria's is at 0.6. 

That means the step two easing of Victoria's coronavirus restrictions can be applied tomorrow, in a welcome relief for Melbourne residents suffering tight Stage Four lockdown conditions and a curfew since August 2.

In more good news, New South Wales reported no new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.

Interstate borders are opening up, meaning a travel bubble is ahead. People may not be able to travel overseas but they will be able to holiday interstate, bringing much-needed business to tourism operators hit hard by the virus.
