She's just lounging around in her curlers.

But as usual, Miley Cyrus turned the seemingly mundane into another hot and risque spread of bombshell images on Sunday night, in honor of her performance this weekend at the 10th annual iHeartRadio Music Festival.

In the latest images, Miley, 27, laid around on a red satin bed, replete with lavish headboard and cheetah-spotted blanket.

 Who owns my heart?! ❤️ @iheartfestival @vijatm

The Midnight Sky songstress was clothed, so to speak, in a black bra top and glittery sheer stocking bottoms, along with matching opera gloves.

A la early-Eighties Madonna, Cyrus had on loads upon loads of silver bracelets and rings over the gloves, along with a cross pendant round her neck and some dangly earrings.

But without a doubt, the centerpiece of the images was Miley's coif, which featured large blond curls housed in a fishnet hair net.

The outspoken starlet sold the images with her trademark attitude, serving sex kitten expressions with a blood red lip and heavy eye shadow.

The Wrecking Ball hitmaker raised her feet behind her in what looked to be classic red-soled Louboutin pumps. 

'Who owns my heart?! ❤️' Miley asked in the caption, along with a skull emoji. 

She tagged both the @iheartfestival as well as her current photographer collaborator Vijat M, who's worked with the likes of Kylie Jenner, Lil Nas X and Paris Hilton in the past.

Some of the images from the shoot made it into the backdrop of her iHeartRadio performance on Saturday night, which saw Cyrus perform, among other things, a raw and full throttle rendition of the Blondie classic Heart Of Glass.

For her onstage look, the We Can't Stop crooner modeled another edgy sheer look, this time in a sexy black body stocking with artfully placed paneling. 

Miley has definitely been feeling her Seventies and Eighties rock goddesses of late, sporting a Par Benetar-inspired grown-out pixie haircut and posting vintage images of Blondie's Debbie Harry to her Instagram feed.

Miley's recent look was just the latest of a series in which she's pushed the envelope.

Last Thursday, the outspoken starlet danced topless in a black and white video clip on her Instagram feed, writing that 'being single means having more alone time to video myself stripping naked to Joan Jett'.

The gifted singer recently broke things off with her beau Cody Simpson, a fellow singer, whom she'd been seeing for 10 months.

It was just the latest breakup in a yearlong period that saw Miley end her decade-long on-off relationship with Liam Hemsworth last August with a divorce, followed by a brief rebound relationship with reality star Kaitlynn Carter.
