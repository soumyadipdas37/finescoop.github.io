She may have failed to find love after she signed up to Married At First Sight.

But it appears Stacey Hampton has finally found her Mr. Right - Melbourne businessman, Lee Thorpy.

The 26-year-old blonde beauty is planning to relocate from Adelaide to Melbourne to pursue her new romance, according to a source close to the blonde beauty.

'Stacey's head over heels for her new man, and I have never seen her happier,' the insider told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.

'She's already started to pack her bags and she's ready to get on the first flight out once border restrictions are lifted,' they continued.

And it seems as if the MAFS bombshell will have no problem relocating, with her activewear range and charity both based in Melbourne.

'Lee always sends her food, flowers and presents. They talk almost everyday and she is always telling her friends how she can't wait to start a family with him.'

Back in June, a source told Daily Mail Australia that Stacey and her man 'began as friends and while she found out bad news in her family, he was there for her and it blossomed from there'.

Stacey has since shared footage to her Instagram of a casually dressed man seated next to her in a luxury vehicle, alongside the caption 'missing you'.

Stacey also posted a photo of herself holding onto a Louis Vuitton shopping bag, with the caption 'so spoilt' and a love heart emoji.

Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Stacey for comment.

Stacey recently made headlines after she reunited with her 'groom' Michael Goonan for lunch after their tumultuous split.
