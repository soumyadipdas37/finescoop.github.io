Just a day after getting her heart broken during The Bachelor finale, Bella Varelis turned her frown upside down. 

The 25-year-old Bachelor runner-up beamed as she chatted with hunky Studio 10 host Tristan MacManus on Friday.

And after being left devastated by Locky Gilbert, it would be understandable if Bella was quietly wishing Tristan, 38, had been single and on The Bachelor instead.

Is Bella wishing he'd been The Bachelor instead? Bella Varelis grinned as she happily chatted with hunky Studio 10 presenter Tristan MacManus on Friday in Sydney after getting dumped by Locky Gilbert 

Unfortunately for Bella, however, the Irish TV star has been happily married to former actress Tahyna Tozzi for six years, and they have two young children together. 

Bella couldn't wipe the smile off her face as she chatted with Tristan in between takes of the morning talk show.

Wearing a pale blue floral print cropped shirt, which sat off her shoulders and was knotted at her waist, Bella basked in the sunshine as she talked with the TV host.

She also wore a pair of high-waisted white jeans, and her shoulder-length brunette hair was styled loose and straight.

Standing alongside Tristan in a pair of strappy nude coloured stilettos, Bella listened intently as he spoke to her.

The newly-appointed Studio 10 host looked suave in a charcoal grey suit, which he paired with a white shirt, which he wore open at the collar.

'I think, personally, he's a nice guy, don't get me wrong, but I think you dodged a bullet there,' Tristan told Bella of Locky Gilbert (pictured)

Speaking to Bella during the show, Tristan assured the former Bachelor hopeful that she was better off without Locky, 31.

'I mean, he was on there and he's telling two people he loved them. That's hard to hear,' he told her.

In photos taken on set of the morning talk show, at one point Bella appeared to wipe away tears while being interviewed.

While she seemed emotional in some behind-the-scenes photos, the brunette was far more composed during the official interview that went to air.

While chatting to hosts Sarah Harris and Tristan MacManus, Bella was measured and mature as she wished Locky and Irena Srbinovska the best in their relationship.

She also confirmed her return to the dating scene, but said she was focusing on loving herself for the time being instead of finding a man.

'I went in there hoping for a soulmate, and I actually did find that in some friendships,' she said optimistically.

Marching orders! The brunette beauty was escorted to set to begin the interview alongside host Sarah Harris 

'You come out, you learn so much about yourself and I know more about what I want in a man,' she added.

'I want a man who knows that he wants me and knows that he loves me.'

Bella also insisted that she genuinely fell in love with Locky during the show.

'Those three months during lockdown when you're on the phone every day, that's a real relationship,' she explained.

'It's not on camera, you're not saying things for production... it's just completely natural and it brings some normality into it, so I completely fell in love with him.'
