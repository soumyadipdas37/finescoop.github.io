She was back in the United States following a short business trip to Paris.

But Kylie Jenner looked poised for another business meeting on Sunday as she showed off a business chic coat.

The 23-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star posed in the look in a short video posted to her Instagram Stories.

Kylie wore a paper-thin pale yellow jacket with wide notched lapels and a black blouse on underneath.

She wore her lightened brunette tresses pulled back with voluminous strands resting over one shoulder. 

The reality star wore multiple jeweled earrings and sported cat-eye makeup.

She accessorized with a black alligator print handbag with a silver clasp.

Home turf: It wasn't clear what the faux billionaire was dressed up for, but she was back in the US following a quick business trip to Paris

Kylie leaned back to show off a bit of her outfit in the short clip, before leaning forward to highlight her impeccably made-up face.

It wasn't clear what the faux billionaire was dressed up for, but she was back in the US following a quick business trip to Paris.

She was spotted throughout the City of Lights, and also shared multiple snapshots from the photo to her Instagram.

Kylie took business meetings with executives from Coty Cosmetics, the company which bought a majority stake in Kylie Cosmetics, making her a near-billionaire.

Pandemic outrage: The trip sparked outrage from social media users, as she ignored California guidelines not to travel, and she seemed to have ignored EU travel bans on Americans

However, the trip sparked outrage from some social media users over her trip for non-essential reasons in the midst of a pandemic. 

'You don't have to deal with COVID if ur rich,' sniped one fan in the comments of a post.

'Is the pandemic over for rich people? I just see them taking luxurious vacations to tropical places or Europe like how is Kylie Jenner in Paris rn I don't understand,' wrote another.

Another remarked, 'Kylie Jenner going to Paris during Covid while the rest of the world can't travel or visit family in other countries/states due to border restrictions just doesn't sit well with me.' 

Kylie seemed to have ignored guidelines issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom restricting travel.

The state government's official website website currently urges people to only travel for 'urgent matters.'

There have been nearly 13,000 deaths from the pandemic in the state of California, with over 700,000 cases. 

In all of the US, 183,000 people have succumbed to COVID-19, while a stunning six million have tested positive for the illness

Puzzling: It's not clear how Kylie got an exemption to enter the EU, and she documented herself ignoring the 14-day quarantine period for entering France

Hanging out: Kylie shared some photos of herself hanging out with the Jenner family friend Fai Khadra

Other critics wondered how Kylie had even been admitted to Paris in the first place.

The European Union has instituted travel restrictions that ban people from the United States from entering any EU countries due to the US' failure to control its coronavirus cases.

Though the EU lists multiple exemptions to the travel restrictions, Kylie doesn't appear to qualify for any of them. 

The official website of the US Embassy & Consulates in France currently states all arrivals in France from the US 'must provide the results of a virologic screening test (such as a PCR test) taken less than 72 hours before departure indicating a negative result for Covid-19.'

The website also states: 'Travelers arriving in France must self-isolate for 14 days if they have no symptoms. Anyone displaying symptoms could be subject to quarantine for up to 30 days.'

However, Kylie documented herself enjoying the town and not quarantining.
