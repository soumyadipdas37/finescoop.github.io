Jennifer Lopez loves to put on a flashy gown to show off her hourglass figure.

But on Monday night the 51-year-old World Of Dance star took a much more casual turn as she dared to wear a triple denim ensemble. Her fiance, 45-year-old Alex Rodriguez, was much more dressed up in a light gray suit and a crisp white shirt.

It is very seldom that the two don't look in step while on the town.

The lookers were seen exiting the popular Carbone Restaurant in Manhattan.

Jennifer's look could not be missed as she modeled a denim jacket over a denim bustier. Her jeans were ripped in the knees, looking on trend.

And oddly the World Of Dance star's strappy shoes also looked to be denim as did her structure handbag from Coach, a brand she represents.

The only thing that was not denim was her face mask, which appeared to be black cotton with rhinestone studs.

The Bronx born babe had her highlighted hair pulled back and she had on pretty eye makeup, adding diamond stud earrings.

Her fingernails and toes were painted black. 

A-Rod was much more dressed up in a snazzy light grey suit and white shirt with no tie and a pair of black boots.

Matchy matchy earlier this year: They were both in black for the 26th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in January in Los Angeles

This sighting comes after the bombshell was seen with Alex and their combined four kids.

Jennifer has twins Max and Emme, aged 12, with her ex-husband, crooner Marc Anthony. Jennifer and Marc were married from 2004 until 2014.

Alex has two children with his ex Cynthia Scurtis - they are Natasha, aged 15, and Ella, aged 12. Alex and Cynthia were wed from 2002 until 2008. 

Good wishes: This sighting comes after the bombshell was seen with Alex and their combined four kids. 'Wishing everyone Peace and Love ❤️ Happy Labor Day!' said Lopez to her 131M followers

Smooch: Jennifer has twins Max and Emme, aged 12, with her ex-husband, crooner Marc Anthony. Jennifer and Marc were married from 2004 until 2014. Alex has two children with his ex Cynthia Scurtis - they are Natasha, aged 15, and Ella, aged 12. Alex and Cynthia were wed from 2002 until 2008

'Wishing everyone Peace and Love ❤️ Happy Labor Day!' said Lopez to her 131M followers.

Alex posted a similar photo only this time his future wife Lopez was in the tree too showing off her platform boots in a deep chocolate brown.

'Tree cheers!' began the former baseball star.

A new campaign for Jenny From The Block: The beauty has been modeling for Coach; here she is seen with her kids Emme and Max as well as her mother Guadalupe

'Wishing everyone a happy and healthy Labor Day, from our family to yours. I’m excited to be working the Cardinals-Cubs game at 4 p.m. ET today on @espn. I love holiday ⚾️!!

'How are you celebrating the holiday?'

In yet another photo, Alex is seen kissing Jennifer as he puts an arm around her waist while the kids smiled behind them.
