Pamela Anderson said she was never married to film producer Jon Peters in tweets shared Saturday morning.

The 53-year-old Baywatch star described her union with the 75-year-old former hairdresser as a 'bizarre lunch' in a series of posts.

The actress was reacting to reports that she'd struck up a relationship with her bodyguard of two years while locked down during the coronavirus pandemic.

'Pamela Anderson was never married to Jon Peters — it was just a bizarre lunch ... no "marriage" no "divorce" ... [sic],' read the first tweet.

The post may have been written by her publicity team, as it referred to her in the third person. 

Her account returned shortly afterward with a follow-up tweet that reiterated the first one with more detail.

'Pamela Anderson was never legally married to Jon Peters (life long family friend) no hard feelings — no Marraige, no Divorce... just a bizarre theatrical lunch — Pamela has a good sense of humor about it [sic].'

Sources previously told The Hollywood Reporter that Anderson and Peters hadn't filed for a marriage certificate after their wedding.

The two-time couple had a ceremony in Malibu on January 20 that was attended by Pamela's two sons and Jon's three daughters, as well as his ex-wife Christine Forsyth-Peters.

Although Anderson is treating the union as a goof now, both she and Peters sounded serious about it shortly afterward.

'There are beautiful girls everywhere,' the producer told THR after the nuptials.

'I could have my pick, but — for 35 years — I've only wanted Pamela. She makes me wild — in a good way. She inspires me. I protect her and treat her the way she deserves to be treated,' he continued, while also standing up for her artistic talents elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Pam shared a poem about her faux husband. 

'He's been there all along./Never failed me -/I'm ready now/and/he's ready too,' she wrote. 

Prior to their abortive marriage, Anderson and Peters had dated in the late 1980s.

More recently, Page Six has reported that Pamela is dating her security guard, whose name hasn't been released yet.

Her friends have claimed the relationship is 'the pandemic's sexiest tryst' in the report, which was published Friday.

The employee has reportedly been working for the Barb Wire star for two years, though it wasn't until their quarantine started that they began a relationship.

'He's in his 40s. A real man, finally,' a source said. 'He knows how to handle her. It's very cool to see. She's completely comfortable, and they're never out of each other's sight.'

'Security': Pamela appeared to share a photo of her bodyguard on Instagram, where she posted a saucy snap of herself posing by an elevator with the man's reflection visible

'He's not a Hollywood insider,' the source continued. 'That's perfect for Pamela.'

Her friends say the two have been 'camping out' at swanky hotels throughout Canada in recent months.

Anderson appeared to share a picture of the bodyguard on Instagram when she posted a steamy photo of herself posing by an elevator door with a man's reflection visible in the metal panel above her.  

'Security #whereswaldo,' she captioned the image, along with a pink flower and cat with heart eyes emoji.

The relationship comes eight months after she and Peters ended their union.

In addition to her marriage with Jon, Pamela has tied the knot a total of four times. 

She was married to Tommy Lee from 1995 to 1998, Kid Rock from 2006 to 2007, and Rick Salomon from 2007 to 2008.

Peters, who was part of the inspiration for Warren Beatty's iconic character in Shampoo, was married five times including the most recent nuptials.
