Ray Liotta and his girlfriend Jacy Nittolo were snapped enjoying a meal in Pacific Palisades, California on Thursday.

The Goodfellas star, 65, and his stunning girlfriend, 45, appeared to be wearing wedding bands as they dined at the swanky restaurant Porta Via Palisades.

Ray, who's slated to appear in The Sopranos prequel The Many Saints of Newark, was seen kissing Nittolo as they shared a lunch outdoors amid social distancing statues in California.

Romance: Ray Liotta, 65, and his girlfriend Jacy Nittolo, 45, were snapped enjoying a meal in Pacific Palisades, California on Thursday

The actor wore a white top and black-rimmed glasses at the eatery, while Nittolo wore a lacey black top with blue jeans and her brown locks down and parted.

Liotta and his love have been seen spending time with one another amid the COVID-10 pandemic, as they've worked out at Gold's Gym in Venice Beach.

Nittolo has alluded to the idea that theirs was a long-term relationship on Instagram: In January, she captioned a PDA shot, '2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025.........'

The Field of Dreams actor was past married to actress Michelle Grace from 1997 thru 2004. The pair are parents to actress Karsen Liotta, 21, who's appeared with her dad and Jennifer Lopez on the NBC show Shades of Blue.

In love: Nittolo also had a band on as she made her way out of the establishment 

This month marks the 30th anniversary of his signature film Goodfellas, in which he played the main role of Henry Hill.

Liotta reflected on appearing in the Martin Scorsese film, which also starred Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino, in a chat with Men's Journal in 2016.

'That was a pretty momentous moment in my career,' he said. 'The fact that Scorsese was directing. All of a sudden Bob came into the project.

He recalled: 'My mother was sick with cancer and died in the middle of us filming. The fact that that was going on made me less intimidated by the situation, I believe, because I was thinking, "My mother is dying of cancer. I am going to come here and be afraid of a guy who is an actor?"'
