Monica Aldama was spotted this Wednesday keeping her mask on as she arrived to work at Dancing With The Stars.

The 50-year-old, who rose to fame as coach on the Netflix show Cheer, was joined by her pro dance partner Val Chmerkovskiy.

Her competitor Chrishell Stause, who appears on the Netflix reality series Selling Sunset, was also seen showing up to work that day.

Aldama was California casual in a flowing pink T-shirt and a pair of black leggings, ensuring she kept her mask on.

Meanwhile Chmerkovskiy, whose brother Maksim also became a star as a Dancing With The Stars pro, stuck to head-to-toe black.

Stause, who is teamed with Gleb Savchenko, showed off her impressively sculpted tummy in a sheer mock turtleneck white crop top. 

Despite some recent drama involving the collapse of her marriage to This Is Us star Justin Hartley she was the picture of good cheer upon her arrival.

Season 29 of Dancing With The Stars introduces host Tyra Banks who was hired to replace Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews.

The season premiered last week, and on this week's episode Charles Oakley became the first celebrity contestant to be eliminated.

Dancing With The Stars judges decided to save the controversial Big Cat Rescue CEO Carole Baskin who became a figure of notoriety via Netflix' Tiger King this year. 

Aldama's latest sighting comes nearly a week after she publicly shared her reaction to the child porn arrest of Cheer star Jerry Harris.

'My heart is shattered into a million pieces. I am devastated by this shocking, unexpected news,' she wrote.

'Our children must be protected from abuse and exploitation, and I'm praying hard for the victims and everyone affected. Please respect our privacy as our family mourns during this heartbreaking time.'

Harris, 21, was arrested by the FBI last Thursday in Chicago and charged with producing child pornography.

Federal court records say he stands accused of trying to get an underage boy 'to produce sexually explicit videos and photos of himself.'

Days before his arrest, 14-year-old cheerleader twin brothers accused Harris of soliciting explicit photos from them and asking one of them for oral sex.

Harris has denied the allegations against him.
