She remains in the throes of newlywed bliss, after tying the knot with TV personality Joel Dommett in early September last year on the Greek island of Mykonos.

And Hannah Cooper marked the occasion in a unique way on Friday, when she took to Instagram to share shots of herself posing in the wedding gowns she'd rejected.

The model looked sensational in the several gowns she posed in – but she revealed that, in the end, her mother ended up finding the perfect dress on Pinterest.

She concluded: 'Please appreciate the PopSocks that I turned into a Bouquet.'

Her posts, which showed a wide variety of wedding dress styles, included the breathtaking lacy gown she eventually decided to wear on her big day. 

The day before, Hannah uploaded a video montage of their nuptials, as she wrote: '1 year later... and still my proudest work to date.

'Resharing because it’s the coolest thing we ever did. (Bar the Lockdown Rap video... that was pretty epic tbf) LOVE YOU S**T LOADS @joeldommet.'

For his part, Joel also marked the occasion on his own Instagram account, sharing a snapshot of himself carrying his bride at their wedding.

'Happy 1st Anniversary to MEEEEEE,' he wrote. 'I’ve been carrying @hannah_cooper_ for a year now and it’s really done my back in. Love you xxx.'

'Our first year of marriage has gone so quickly,' he remarked. 'Although we were inside for half of it so I’m expecting the 2nd year to drag a little more.' 

The couple wed in a romantic ceremony on the idyllic Greek island of Mykonos in early September.

Joel and Hannah enjoyed a romantic honeymoon in Mexico this January before the novel coronavirus pandemic spread across the globe.

The Masked Singer presenter announced his engagement to the stunning model in 2018.

On an episode of Loose Women, Joel revealed it was more love at first screen than sight, as he met the gorgeous blonde on Instagram.

He admitted it was a rocky road before he finally found The One, and it took an exchange of emojis to spark the beginnings of his and Hannah's relationship.

Joel divulged: 'She sent me an emoji with a cat with the heart eyes, and that was it.'

'I've been burned online with relationships before, but we met up and got on really well and went on a super first date. Now on every anniversary we replicate our first date.'
