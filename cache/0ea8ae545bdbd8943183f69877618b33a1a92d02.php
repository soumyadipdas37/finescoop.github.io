<p>Turning up the heat: Kady McDermott cut a glamorous figure as she took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a sizzling lingerie snap in Calvin Klein underwear </p>

<p>Kady looked tanned and toned in the two-piece which featured a thong with the designer's branding on the elasticated banding. </p>

<p>The soft bra meanwhile highlighted her washboard abs while teasing a glimpse of her cleavage.</p>

<p>The television personality wore her brunette tresses in a swept-over side parting and accentuated her golden tan with an understated make-up look.     </p>

<p>Toned: The Love Island star, 24, has been working hard on her fitness throughout lockdown and last month posed in this light green lingerie set </p>

<p>Kady recently left fans confused after she announced she is still with boyfriend Myles and they will live in their new home 'as a couple', weeks after confirming yet another 'break-up'.</p>

<p>The brunette previously took to social media to confirm she will be living in her renovated bungalow with former TOWIE star Myles, 26, when it is finished.</p>

<p>The duo bought a Hertfordshire property together in April 2019 with plans to completely transform it into a two-storey house.</p>

<p>Orange you glad you came: The television personality also littered her Instagram over the summer with snaps from her sun-soaked break </p>

<p>The brunette blamed their split on the pressure of the build which caused them to argue, as she joked that their renovation has been more stressful than having a baby.  </p>

<p>She wrote: 'Just to stop all the personal dms because we are literally get one every single minute, which is understandable.</p>

<p>'Me and Myles are will both be living in this house as a couple, couples do argue. It is a very exciting time for us both but also ridiculously stressful.</p>

<p>'Me and Myles can't wait to live in our forever home and will continue to share our journey with you.'</p>

<p>'Now I understand when people say renovating/moving home is more stressful than having a baby.' (sic)</p>
