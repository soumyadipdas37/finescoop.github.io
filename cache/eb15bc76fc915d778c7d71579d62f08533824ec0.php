<p>Grainne Kealy had her feet in the dangerous yet common position when the car she was in lost control going over ice and crashed into a wall in the irish town of Borris-in-Ossory.</p>

<p>Grainne Kealy, from Ireland, had her feet on the dashboard of her boyfriend's Jeep when it lost control going over ice and crashed into a wall</p>

<p>Despite the car only travelling 50km/h, Ms Kealy broke every bone in her face when the airbag inflated and sent her knees smashing into her head at 320km/h</p>

<p>Nearly 15 years on from the near-fatal crash, the 36-year-old is warning passengers to keep their feet on the floor when in the car.</p>

<p>'I was one of those people who had my feet up. I thought I was going to be more comfortable,' she told the New Zealand Herald.  </p>

<p>'The only thing I can hope for people is to learn from my mistakes and don't take the risk. You just don't know. You can't control every car on the road or the conditions around you.'</p>

<p>Since the December 2006 incident, Ms Kealy has had 16 operations and still suffers mentally and physically from her injuries. </p>

<p>The Irishwoman, who now lives in New Zealand, said it was hard coming to terms with her new appearance, and is on anti-depressants. </p>

<p>Ms Kealy said she has no memory of the three months leading up to the crash, the crash itself, and the month after. Pictured after the crash</p>

<p>She also said she has Acquired Brain Injury where she loses words in the middle of conversations, she finds it hard to focus, and she constantly gets headaches</p>
