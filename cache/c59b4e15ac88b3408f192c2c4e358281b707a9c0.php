<p>Glamazon: The swimwear, by designer Devon Windsor, featured long black gloves. The beauty had her flat stomach and endless pins on full display</p>

<p>She explained that she never thought about skincare until she got older. </p>

<p>'Growing up I didn't do much, you know I was brought up in New Zealand, and my mum was very no fuss and only used one moisturiser,' she said. </p>

<p>Georgia said that she credits her skin to a number of beauty products from cleansers to sunscreen. </p>

<p>So that's how she does it! This month, Georgia (pictured) revealed the secret behind her flawless skin to Mamamia podcast, You Beauty</p>

<p>Georgia's favourite cleanser is the Royal Fern Cleansing Balm which retails for $114 as it 'gives a nice cleanse without drying out your skin too much'.</p>

<p>She also said that she uses an exfoliant everyday, to help with 'blackheads and any impurities'. </p>

<p>When it comes to her favourite serum, the model revealed that her sister turned her onto the $148 Emma Lewishan Skin Reset serum which helps in 'getting rid of any pigmentation'.   </p>

<p>Model business: The New Zealand born beauty has walked the runway for Victoria Secret and has posed for the likes of Vogue, Marie Claire and Harper's Bazaar</p>

<p>Georgia also credits the importance of massaging face oils in to your skin to help reduce puffiness. </p>

<p>'It really does helps bring all the blood to the face and gets rid of any excess fluid that's sitting around or puffy eyes and it's a really good practice,' she added. </p>

<p>And, of course, sunscreen is a must with the model using two different types, including Dermalogica tinted sunscreen and the Rationale Beautiful Skin Superfluid. </p>
