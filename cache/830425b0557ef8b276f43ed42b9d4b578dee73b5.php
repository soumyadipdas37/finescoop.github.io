<p>'She's a single mom, but not like I'm a single mom. I have a lot of help - she doesn't,' Jennifer admitted to Cosmopolitan back in 2013.</p>

<p>'The biggest artists in the world performing at whatever venue they choose, doing all their hits and being able to launch a new single, launch a new album off the back of each episode,' Tedder explained in a recent interview.</p>

<p>Ryan continued: 'If you're Dua Lipa, The Weeknd, Harry Styles having the biggest moment of his career can go on and do a 90-minute set, do the whole album, play all of his hits and then an interview portion.'</p>
