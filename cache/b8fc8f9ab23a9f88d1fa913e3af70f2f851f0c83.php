<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you tell a drunk youngster they're 'sozzled' and get a puzzled look, refrain from calling them a 'wally' or a 'nincompoop'.</p>

<p>They probably won't have a clue what any of those words mean.</p>

<p>In fact they might think you're talking 'balderdash', except they probably wouldn't call it that... as it's yet another expression many young Britons wouldn't recognise.</p>

<p>Some 2,000 adults were given a list of words and asked which ones they had never heard before for a survey. </p>

<p>It found that 40 per cent of those aged 18 to 30 did not know what 'sozzled' meant. </p>

<p>'Wally' was not know by 36 per cent of young people, while 'nincompoop' fell outside the vocabulary of 28 per cent of respondents.</p>

<p>The survey by research firm Perspectus Global found 37 per cent of this age group did not know that 'bonk' was slang for sex or that a 'cad' was a dishonourable man.</p>

<p>Bestselling author Jilly Cooper – famed for her 'bonkbusters' – told The Times she feared 'plonk', or wine, would also soon be forgotten. </p>

<p>The survey, which was carried out by the research firm Perspectus Global, saw some 2,000 adults given a list of words and asked which ones they had never heard before. (Stock image)</p>

<p>The 83-year-old said: 'The words bonk and plonk describe two of the loveliest activities in the world. Let's make sure we carry on using them both.'  </p>

<p>She added that she would write a 'plonkbuster called Sozzled' to ensure the word stay in common usage.</p>
