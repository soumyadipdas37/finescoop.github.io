<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A floating dock crashed into a fleet of Russian warships after it was blown away by the high winds of Typhoon Maysak. </p>

<p>The naval hardware was blown off its moorings and collided with nearby ships and submarines at a shipyard in Vladivostok on Russia's far east coast. </p>

<p>The dock was damaged and had to be towed away but Russia's Pacific Fleet insisted there was no destruction on board the military vessels.   </p>

<p>The storm has caused chaos in Russia's far east after drenching North and South Korea and sinking a ship off the coast of Japan.   </p>

<p>Blown off course: A floating dock drifts in the winds of Typhoon Maysak after breaking free from its moorings at a shipyard in Vladivostok </p>

<p>Footage which circulated among military experts showed the dry dock drifting in the wind at the Vostochnaya Verf shipyard. </p>

<p>A dry dock can be drained of water after a ship has arrived, allowing naval maintenance workers to reach the parts of the vessel that would usually be submerged. </p>

<p>One Russian defence expert, Rob Lee, said the dock appeared to have collided with Molniya-class missile boats and submarines from the Pacific Fleet's 19th Submarine Brigade and 165th Surface Ship Brigade.   </p>

<p>A Pacific Fleet official told Russian news agency Interfax that three tugboats had been sent to rescue the floating dock after it suffered 'minor damage'. </p>

<p>Several people were on the dock when it blew off course but they were not injured and there was no major damage to the warships, the Russian military said. </p>

<p>'The dock has been towed, the degree of damage and the amount of damage will be determined after the situation has been resolved,' a statement said. </p>

<p>Other tugboats were put on alert while backup power supplies were put in place as Russia prepared for the storm. </p>

<p>Danger: The dry dock - used for maintenance on parts of ships that are usually submerged below the water - drifts towards submarines and warships </p>

<p>Collision: The floating dock was damaged and had to be towed away after hitting the pier - but the Russian military insists that the warships were not harmed </p>

<p>Storm: The typhoon caused a road accident in Vladivostok (pictured), brought down trees and left people without power in far eastern Russia </p>

<p>High winds overturned a truck in Vladivostok and brought down trees after a severe weather warning on the Pacific coast. </p>

<p>Thousands of people had their power supply cut off because of the typhoon, which had earlier reached winds of nearly 90mph when it made landfall in the Koreas. </p>

<p>One woman was killed in Busan in South Korea while more than 2,000 people were evacuated to temporary shelters.    </p>

<p>The storm later made its way northwards, passing into the Sea of Japan, before making a second landfall at Kimchaek in North Korea.  </p>

<p>Japan's coast guard is today searching for survivors from a ship that sank during the typhoon with 43 crew and nearly 6,000 cows on board. </p>

<p>The typhoon then reached Vladivostok and the Pacific Fleet, which is home to part of Russia's nuclear submarine force.  </p>

<p>In 2013, a fire broke out on a nuclear submarine near Vladivostok, injuring 15 seamen who were taken to hospital. </p>

<p>Footage showed another fire on a Kilo-class submarine in 2018, although Russian officials claimed it was part of an exercise.  </p>
