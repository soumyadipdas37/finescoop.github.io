<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>US private equity giant Apollo is in position to snap up Asda after its rival Lone Star backed out of the race at the 11th hour.</p>

<p>The two firms were vying for a majority stake in Britain’s third-largest supermarket from US retail giant Walmart.</p>

<p>Lone Star’s bid for Asda was not high enough for Walmart, sources told The Telegraph.</p>

<p>Lone Star’s bid for Asda was reportedly not high enough for Walmart leaving US private equity giant rival Apollo in position to snap up Britain’s third-largest supermarket</p>

<p>The two private equity groups were seen as the frontrunners after Walmart put the Asda stake back on the market. A decision is expected within days.</p>

<p>It is thought Apollo and Lone Star had both valued Asda at around £6.5billion, less than Walmart paid for the Leeds-based grocer in 1999.</p>

<p>They had also put retail heavyweights on their teams to help put together their bids, with former Debenhams boss Rob Templeman working with Apollo and ex-Asda boss Paul Mason with Lone Star.</p>

<p>Walmart was forced to put Asda back up for auction after a £14billion merger with Sainsbury’s was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority in April. The pair are not allowed to consider another merger for a decade.</p>

<p>Regulators said the tie-up would have made consumers worse off.</p>

<p>Walmart had considered spinning Asda off and floating it on the stock market. Asda is the only one of Britain’s top four supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – not listed on the London Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>If Apollo wins, it has been reported that its bid includes reviewing each of Asda’s 600 stores, rather than immediately firing the starting gun on mass closures and job losses.</p>

<p>It is not clear if other groups, such as UK-based TDR Capital, are in the running. Lone Star was contacted for comment yesterday.</p>
