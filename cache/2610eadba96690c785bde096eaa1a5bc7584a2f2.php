<p>It has also been said that Khloe 'hasn't stopped crying' over the end of the show.</p>

<p>Kris said: 'We had to tell the crew yesterday, so we were all crying. But I think Khloe...is probably the one who is taking it the hardest and really hasn't stopped crying since we announced. She's been so sweet and just emotional about it.'</p>

<p>Kris admitted it has been a 'hard' decision to make, but she felt it was the 'right time' to end the show. </p>
