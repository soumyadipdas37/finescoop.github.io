<p>Jodi and Cedric were first spotted together on July 3 enjoying a loved-up dinner date at Bondi's RAW bar.</p>

<p>At the time, Jodi could not wipe the smile off her face as she nestled in close to her former beau while leaving the Japanese eatery.</p>

<p>According to an insider, the glam mother-of-one was 'happier than ever' after meeting the Swiss lawyer.  </p>

<p>A source close to the pair revealed at the time that Jodi was 'beaming with joy' over Cedric.</p>

<p>'She's head over heels. They've been dating for a few months now, but things are still in the very early stages of their relationship,' they said.  </p>

<p>Change: She announced in January she was leaving her role as Elly Conway after three years on the soap </p>

<p>Jodi has had an eventful past year after sensationally quitting her high-profile acting role on Neighbours. </p>
