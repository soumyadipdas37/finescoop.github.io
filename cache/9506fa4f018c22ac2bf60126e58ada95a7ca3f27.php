<p>It is understood the pair have been in an on-and-off relationship for a number of years, which recommenced after Ms Hoppe was kicked off The Bachelor.</p>

<p>Ms Hoppe refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>A source told Daily Mail Australia the altercation brought the club to a standstill.</p>

<p>Forgotten tennis star Bernard Tomic and The Bachelor contestant Kaitlyn Hoppe were involved in a public screaming match inside Gold Coast strip club Hollywood Showgirls last weekend, it can be revealed (Pictured is Tomic at a Gold Coast nightclub in 2013)</p>

<p>'They got in a big fight at Hollywood Showgirls the other weekend... everyone heard and saw it,' the man said.</p>

<p>'It was crazy, even for a night out on the Gold Coast. They were screaming at each other.'</p>

<p>Having long been dubbed the brightest future star in world tennis, Tomic's career is almost at a point of no return.</p>

<p>Tomic, the former world number 17, has not played a professional match since March and has not won a Grand Slam match since mid-2018</p>

<p>The argument led to Ms Hoppe (pictured) leaving the club, while Tomic - a regular patron - was allowed to stay. Daily Mail Australia understands the pair have been involved in an on-and-off relationship for a number of years, including following Ms Hoppe's season of The Bachelor</p>

<p>Ms Hoppe refused to comment on the altercation when contacted by Daily Mail Australia</p>

<p>The world number 209 has not won a Grand Slam singles match since mid-2018.</p>

<p>The former Wimbledon quarter finalist was such a prodigious young talent that at 12 he was signed by management giant IMG.</p>

<p>But after reaching a highest ranking of 17 in 2016, Tomic's career has been downhill ever since and marred by a number of incidents both off and on the court.</p>

<p>Ms Hoppe is the daughter of former NRL star Sean, who was the league's leading try scorer in 1995.</p>

<p>A former real estate agent and model, she entered The Bachelor as an intruder and was quick to cause controversy.</p>

<p>Last month, a heated argument between Ms Hoppe and fellow Bachelor star Roxi Kenny stunned viewers of the Channel 10 show.</p>

<p>A jealous Roxi, 29, became furious after discovering her love rival had given leading man Locky Gilbert a kiss at the cocktail party.</p>

<p>At one stage, she said within earshot of Ms Hoppe: 'I'm sorry but I think that's really rude to everyone else. You kissed someone at a cocktail party.' </p>

<p>Bookmakers currently list Kaitlyn as a $15 chance to win the heart of The Bachelor, Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>The reality star's altercation with Tomic came just a day after two AFL players - Sydney Stack (left) and Callum Coleman-Jones (right) were kicked out of the league's COVID-19 hub for a brawl outside the same strip club</p>
