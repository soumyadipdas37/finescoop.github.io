<p>'I don't know. Who knows what the future kind of holds,' Rae said. 'I'm kind of just living life day by day and going through everything with a happy heart and humble mindset. It's all been really exciting. </p>

<p>'A lot of stuff keeps continuing to be presented to me, which is super fun, and I think there's plenty of opportunities and exciting things coming up,' she continued. </p>

<p>'I feel like, I'm really not a person to say no to anything, at any time, ever. I can never say no to anybody, let alone something that I'm actually interested in doing.'</p>

<p>Addison and Kourtney, 41, have documented their friendship on Instagram and in multiple TikTok videos, including some humorous clips that have them lip syncing to classic KUWTK clips.</p>

<p>The TikTok star also opened up about the famous duo's relationship and how it has flourished throughout the pandemic despite their more than 20-year age difference.</p>

<p>'At the end of the day, I think friendships are just what you make them,' she explained. </p>

<p>'What you have, like the time you spend with them, the things you enjoy doing. And if you have things in common, it just makes sense. I don't think that's anything to really judge people on. I feel like friendships can range from any age and I feel like everyone can relate to people in different ways.'</p>

<p>The age gap didn't stop the two from showing off their stunning figures in a bikini photoset posted to Instagram late last month. </p>

<p>'Kourtney and I just happen to have a great friendship, which is really fun,' Addison continued. 'She's been a great person to have in my life. She said in my YouTube video that I had great energy that she liked to be around. I think she has great energy as well and she has so much experience in her life that I can really just look at and kind of learn from.'</p>

<p>The social media star also expressed interest in having Kourtney and her mother Kris Jenner make an appearance on her Mama Knows Best podcast, which she hosts with her mother Sheri Easterling.</p>
