<p>A humpback whale which was freed from almost certain death by three men off the coast of California repaid the favour to its rescuers with a breathtaking display of breaches and dives.</p>

<p>The amazing hour-long performance was caught on camera moments after the creature was cut free from fishing nets.</p>

<p>When the boat came across the whale it was trapped with its tail and flippers hopelessly entangled in the nets.</p>

<p>Scroll down to watch video</p>

<p>Helping hand: Michael Fishbach and his two friends help to cut the net from the helpless humpback whale</p>

<p>The whale watchers first thought the humpback was already dead as it was floating on top of the water.</p>

<p>But then it let out a loud breath through its blow hole.</p>

<p>Michael Fishbach decided the best thing to do was to get into the water and snorkel alongside the stricken whale.</p>

<p>He said: 'As I swam alongside the animal our eyes met.</p>

<p>'There were no words we could share but I wanted to let the whale know that we were there to help.</p>

<p>'It took some effort to stay focused given the great emotion of the moment.</p>

<p>'The sight of this large and beautiful creature trapped and so close to death was almost overwhelming.</p>

<p>Danger: The huge creature could have easily overturned the boat but the rescuers were determined to cut the nets away</p>

<p>'I must admit I was a bit scared because I knew the whale was frightened and fatigued but could still kill me with one panicked movement.'</p>

<p>He said the whale's tail was so entangled that it was weighed down by about 15ft.</p>

<p>Michael got back on the boat and tried to cut the net off the whale with a small knife.</p>

<p>The trio managed to free one of the fins but the whale sensed freedom and swam away, pulling the boat with it.</p>

<p>But eventually it surfaced again and more net was cut away.</p>

<p>After about an hour of working the whale was totally free.</p>

<p>They pulled the remaining fish net onto the boat and watched the whale give a dramatic show of freedom.</p>

<p>Spectacular: The huge whale shows its splendour as it jumps out of the water</p>

<p>For the next hour they watched the whale breach around 40 times and then dive down waving its tail above the water.</p>

<p>Michael said: 'We all believed it was a least a show of pure joy, if not thanks.</p>

<p>'We were all proud and thrilled that we saved this fantastic young life.</p>

<p>'It was an incredible experience that none of us will ever forget.'</p>

<p>On the video a small girl can be heard saying: 'I know what she is doing. She is showing us that she is free.</p>

<p>Her mother replies to her: 'I think she is showing us a thank you dance.'</p>

<p>Michael spends two months every winter photographing whales in the Sea of Cortez.</p>

<p>He is the co-founder of the Great Whale Conservancy (GWC) Blue Whale Protection Program, set up to protect whales along the California coast from ship-strike caused injuries and death.</p>

<p>Thank you: The whale performed around 40 breaches and tail slaps in the hour after being freed</p>

<p>The whole rescue was captured on camera off the coast of California</p>
