<p>It comes after Zara detailed how she was victim to revenge porn twice and is now working with Refuge charity to try and overhaul and strengthen laws surrounding the heartbreaking crime.   </p>

<p>Speaking to Loose Women on Friday about her own experience, she said: 'I’ve been a victim of revenge porn, or what is called Image Based Sexual Abuse, twice in my life... </p>

<p>'Notably, when I came out of Love Island, and came out to images of me, what felt like, circulating around the whole world. It was one of the hardest things I went through in my whole life.'    </p>

<p>Pained: Zara spoke to the Loose Women panel about her heartbreaking experiences with revenge porn and her 'damaging' stint on Love Island</p>

<p>It comes after Zara split from Made In Chelsea regular Sam Thompson, 28, in September. </p>

<p>While Zara has yet to publicly confirm or deny claims she cheated on former beau, she has been sharing cryptic quotes on social media. </p>

<p>The singer wrote earlier this month on her Instagram Stories: 'Your heart knows the way, run in that direction.</p>

<p>Love always won in the end. No matter how it happened, no matter what it took, no matter what it meant. Fair or not, true or not. Love won.'</p>

<p>Adding a sad face emoji, Zara's second post then stated: 'We have all hurt someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident. We have all loved someone tremendously, whether by intent or accident. </p>

<p>'It is an intrinsic human trait, and a deep responsibility, I think, to be an organ and a blade. But, learning to forgive ourselves and others because we have not chosen wisely is what makes us most human. </p>

<p>'We make horrible mistakes, it's how we learn. We breathe love, it's how we learn, and it is inevitable.' </p>

<p>A source revealed to MailOnline that a tryst took place between Zara and 'someone in the music industry' around the time she took part in X Factor: Celebrity.</p>

<p>The reality star appeared on the series last summer and autumn, as part of the Love Island pop group No Love Lost.</p>

<p>What are you saying? The Love Island star took to Instagram Stories to share an emotive quote hinting that 'love won' in September</p>

<p>Who have you hurt? She then shared a second quote about 'hurting someone' and 'making horrible mistakes' </p>

<p>At this point, she had been in a relationship with Sam for several months – but it's said the newly-single star has only recently found out about the infidelity. </p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'Zara cheated on Sam with someone in the music industry. Someone connected to the X Factor.  </p>

<p>'Sam is obviously distraught about this. He only found out about it very recently and has escaped for a few days. </p>

<p>'Zara regrets it and feels terrible. She knows it was a huge mistake and is extremely upset.</p>

<p>'Zara and Sam split towards the end of last month. They had been arguing a lot since moving in together as a result of lockdown and things just built up between them.</p>

<p>'Zara has moved back to her parents' house in Essex where she's taking some time for herself, she really loved Sam so this hasn't been easy for her.</p>

<p>'Sam has gone away to have a break from it all and clear his head away from Zara and social media.' </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for Zara and Sam for comment at the time. </p>
