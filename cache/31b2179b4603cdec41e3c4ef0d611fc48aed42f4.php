<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paul Pogba is reportedly waiting for a chance to return to Juventus next year and is therefore stalling on a renewal of his Manchester United contract. </p>

<p>The Frenchman, who moved from the Old Lady to United in 2016 for a then-world record deal of £89m, has constantly been linked with a return to the Serie A champions. </p>

<p>With Andrea Pirlo, who Pogba played alongside in midfield during three of his four years in Turin, now the manager at Juventus, the 27-year-old is reportedly eyeing a reunion for 2021, according to Italian outlet Tuttosport. </p>

<p>Paul Pogba is stalling on a new Man United contract in order to sign for Juventus in 2021</p>

<p>Pogba played alongside current manager Andrea Pirlo during three of his four years in Turin</p>

<p>The report, which is the cover of Saturday's edition, claims that Pogba is stalling on signing a contract extension at Old Trafford, because he is waiting on a return to Italy. </p>

<p>The French World Cup winner currently has a deal at United until next summer, though there is an option to extend that by a year to 2022. </p>

<p>Any developments are not expected to take place this summer, with Pogba currently satisfied with the situation under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after United qualified for the Champions League. </p>

<p>Pogba in particular flourished post-lockdown, forming an impressive midfield partnership with January signing Bruno Fernandes. </p>

<p>The United midfield was strengthened further this week when United completed the £40million signing of Donny van de Beek from Ajax.  </p>

<p>Yet the situation and link between Pogba and Juve could resurface in January, with Pirlo said to be keen on bringing in the playmaker. </p>

<p>The pair won three Serie A titles together and reached the final of the 2014-15 Champions League, losing out to Barcelona in Berlin. </p>

<p>Former player Pirlo was Juventus' surprise choice to succeed Maurizio Sarri as manager</p>

<p>After originally coming through the United academy, Pogba moved to Juve on a free transfer in 2012, and it was in Turin where he first broke through on the European stage.   </p>

<p>Pogba last week became the latest high-profile player to test positive for coronavirus, with the new season starting on next week, on September 12. </p>

<p>That being said, due to their exertions in the Europa League last month, United's first game is not until Saturday, 19 September, when they host Crystal Palace.  </p>
