<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England have revealed their new home and away kit for next summer's European Championship.</p>

<p>The kit, designed by Nike, has taken inspiration from the one the Three Lions wore for the 1998 World Cup in France.</p>

<p>England supporters wanting to buy the shirt worn by the players will have to fork out a whopping £99.95. </p>

<p>An extra £59.95 will have to be spent on the shorts to complete the look with the socks not yet available to buy. Should fans want their favourite player's name and number printed on the shirt they will pay a total of £114.95 for the privilege.</p>

<p>England will wear the strip at next summer's tournament after Euro 2020 was delayed due to coronavirus.</p>

<p>The competition is still scheduled to take place around Europe next year between June 11 and July 11 with the final being held at Wembley.</p>

<p>England would have worn the kit at this year's tournament until it was delayed due to Covid-19</p>

<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold is England's first-choice right-back heading into the new season</p>

<p>Gareth Southgate's side have been drawn against Croatia and Czech Republic while their third Group D opponent is yet to be decided. </p>

<p>Those on social media were quick to point out similarities between that of the kit most recognisable from England's World Cup defeat by Argentina 22 years ago and the new one.</p>

<p>'Reminds me of this!' one wrote, attaching a picture of Michael Owen celebrating after scoring his wonder goal against Argentina. </p>

<p>Social media users were quick to point out similarities with the 1998 World Cup kit</p>

<p>England home vapor match shirt (as worn by the players): £99.95</p>

<p>England home vapor match shorts: £59.95</p>

<p>England home vapor match shirt with player name and number: £114.95 </p>

<p>Others pointed towards the price of the kit, adding that it is unrealistic to ask fans to pay such a high cost in a time of financial uncertainty.</p>

<p>One added: 'I like them - but you price me out of getting them for my two children. I simply can't justify that sort of money on two football tops. Pricing really needs to be reviewed and I am convinced you will sell so much more.'  </p>

<p>'Still in the midst of a pandemic and people are struggling financially and FA thinks it's acceptable to bring out a new shirt,' another wrote.</p>

<p>England captain Harry Kane commented on the kits, saying they both symbolise unity with the players and fans.</p>

<p>Kane said: 'This team is closer than it's ever been before — when we put on that England jersey, all club rivalries are set aside.</p>

<p>'We're united in our goal of representing our fans far and wide. This collection captures that feeling of togetherness we hold so dearly.'</p>
