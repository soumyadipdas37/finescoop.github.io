<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dr. Dre's estranged wife Nicole Young has given a justification for her request for a stunning $2 million per month in her divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>Young, 50, broke down the massive figure in new legal documents obtained by TMZ.</p>

<p>According to the filings, the vast majority of her expenses are listed as 'Entertainment,' and she's seeking $900,000 per month to cover those costs.</p>

<p>The breakdown: Nicole Young, 50, explained why she requested $2 million in monthly spousal support from her husband Dr. Dre, 55, in legal documents obtained by TMZ; shown in 2016</p>

<p>Young also says she needs $10,000 per month to keep the house clean and to get her laundry done, and she needs another $135,000 to pay for new clothes each month. </p>

<p>She including $60,000 monthly for education costs, including tuition and living expenses, though she didn't specify if that was for her own education efforts or if it was to pay for either her son Truice, 23, or daughter Truly Young, 19.</p>

<p>Dre's soon-to-be ex is also looking to keeping her charitable donations in place with $125,000 each month.</p>

<p>She's also on the hook for a $100,000 per month mortgage, and she says she needs a head-scratching $20,000 each month to pay for her telephone, cell phone and email use.</p>

<p>Stunning figures: Young says he expenses include $900K per month in entertainment costs, plus $135K for new clothes; shown with Dre and daughter Truly Young, 19, in February</p>

<p>Modest: Her current expenses come out to $2.5 million, so her request of a little less than $2 million is less than what she currently gets; shown in 2018</p>

<p>Although all her individual expenses weren't listed, her total monthly expenses came out to $2,530,000, so her request for $1,936,399 is actually more modest than what she had been spending.</p>

<p>As of now, Dre (real name: Andre Young) is covering all of her expenses. </p>

<p>In the filings, Young contends that the NWA member has been cutting off her allowance and has prevented her from using her American Express Black Card.</p>

<p>Young claims that the marriage began to go sour on April 1, when the Chronic rapper became intoxicated at their home in their Los Angeles home and began shouting, 'F*** you. F*** you. Get the f*** out. Get the f*** out. Go to Malibu.'</p>

<p>According to her, he tried to cut off the purse strings and told her, 'Do not spend one more cent ... period. You can't be mean and disrespectful and spend my hard-earned money. F*** that!!! Yes that's a threat ... I'm putting the beach house up for sale next week ...'</p>

<p>Dre is allegedly so angry at the accounting of his finances going on due to the divorce proceedings that he's threatening 'war.'</p>

<p>Accusations: Young claimed Dre sending his brother-in-law to pick up his Glock at her house, and wrote that he was violent during their marriage</p>

<p>Young described a chilling incident in the documents in which she became frightened of her husband after he sent his brother-in-law to the Malibu home where she was staying to pick up his Glock handgun. </p>

<p>She refused to give it up at the time and said that Dre had a 'history of violence and coercive control, both before and during the marriage,' though she doesn't specify any incidents of domestic violence.</p>

<p>The rapper infamously assaulted fellow rapper and TV host Dee Barnes in 1991, and he has been accused of other instances of domestic abuse since then.</p>

<p>'Any man that puts his hands on a female is a fucking idiot,' he said of the incidents in his 2017 docuseries The Defiant Ones. </p>

<p>Young wrote that Dre sent her text messages that she found threatening after their separation, including one exchange that read, 'Why are you ignoring me? Why are you ignoring me ... should I come see you?' </p>

<p>The latest: Dr. Dre's estranged wife Nicole Young has filed court docs asking for almost $2 million monthly from the rapper, who has a net worth of around $800 million. The former couple was snapped in late 2018 in LA</p>

<p>Young also wants the Beats by Dre mogul, 55, to pay her $5 million in fees she's spent on their split, TMZ reported.</p>

<p>Young, who is represented by attorney Samantha Spector, filed for divorce from The Next Episode artist earlier this summer after 24 years of marriage, as they share two children.</p>

<p>Insiders told TMZ that Nicole's quality of life has not changed since filing for divorce in July, as she resides at the Malibu, California home they had shared, with amenities such as luxury vehicles and a staff.</p>

<p>The former N.W.A. member and Young have been at odds over a prenuptial agreement, according to the outlet.</p>

<p>Young, who was previously wed to NBA player Sedale Threatt, said she initially signed one before their May 25, 1996 wedding, but Dr. Dre later destroyed it during the better times in the marriage two years later.</p>
