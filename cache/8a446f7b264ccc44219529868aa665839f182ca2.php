<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>As Doctor Who, Tom Baker fought Daleks and Cybermen, robot mummies and gothic monsters — but his latest 'creature feature' has taken the form of an accolade.</p>

<p>Australian palaeontologists have named a newly-found species of trilobite — a segmented sea creature from 450 million years ago — in honour of the actor. </p>

<p>Trilobites loosely resemble woodlice — and their closest living relatives include lobsters, crabs and scorpions. They fell extinct around 251.9 million years ago.</p>

<p>The fossil — 'Gravicalymene bakeri' — was found preserved in shale rocks in Northern Tasmania that date back to the so-called 'Late Ordovician' period. </p>

<p>Mr Baker said that he was 'delighted' to have the specimen named after him.</p>

<p>The researchers — Patrick Smith of the Australian Museum and Malte Ebach of the  University of New South Wales — said 'Doctor Who' inspired their scientific careers. </p>

<p>Australian experts have named a newly-found species of trilobite — a segmented sea creature from 450 million years ago, pictured left — in honour of Doctor Who actor Tom Baker, right</p>

<p>'I am delighted to be entitled at last. Will I be allowed to tack "Fossil" on official correspondence?,' Mr Baker joked.</p>

<p>'I hope the [Doctor] Who World will celebrate this fresh honour and will spread the news to those who live in remote places,' he added.</p>

<p>'Happy days to all the Who fans everywhere.' </p>

<p>The naming of the fossil is not the only time Mr Baker has been immortalised in stone — the 1977 Doctor Who serial 'The Face of Evil' depicted his likeness carved in rock on the side of a mountainside.</p>

<p>'I’m not old enough to remember Tom Baker’s episodes, which were originally aired in 1974-81,' Dr Smith said.</p>

<p>'However, growing up as a teenager when the series re-aired in the early 2000’s, I followed the show religiously and became convinced that a career in science was guaranteed to improve the world.'</p>

<p>'In particular, it inspired me to study the concept of "Time" – as the Doctor travels through time.'</p>

<p>'Hence, the area of science I specialised in is biostratigraphy, which is all about dating the age of Earth and its rocks.'</p>

<p>The newly-identified specimen is unusual, for while trilobites were common in Australia during the entire Ordovician Period, Gravicalymene bakeri belongs to a group that has not previously been discovered on the continent.</p>

<p>The fossil — 'Gravicalymene bakeri', depicted here in illustration — was found preserved in shale rocks in Northern Tasmania that date back to the so-called 'Late Ordovician' period</p>

<p>The naming of the fossil is not the only time Mr Baker has been immortalised in stone — the 1977 Doctor Who serial 'The Face of Evil' depicted his likeness carved in rock on the side of a mountainside, as pictured, near the village of the Sevateem</p>

<p>The researchers — Patrick Smith of the Australian Museum and Malte Ebach of the University of New South Wales — said 'Doctor Who' inspired their scientific careers. Pictured, Tom Baker, dressed as the Doctor, poses for publicity photos in 1975 with a squad of Daleks</p>

<p>'It was the character of Doctor Who — and especially the actor Tom Baker — that inspired me to explore the natural world,' Dr Ebach added.</p>

<p>'So, it is a joy to name a trilobite in his honour. My sister-in-law has even knitted a replica Doctor Who scarf for the occasion,' he concluded.</p>

<p>The full findings of the study were published in Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.</p>

<p>Pictured, Tom Baker as 'the Doctor'</p>

<p>Tom Baker starred in Doctor Who from 1974–1981.</p>

<p>He took over the lead role from Jon Pertwee at the end of the serial 'The Planet of the Spiders', appearing in 173 televised episodes.</p>

<p>He was joined in his travels through time and space by an assortment of companions — including journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and robotic dog K-9 (voiced by John Leeson and David Brierley). </p>

<p>Baker's bombastic portrayal is perhaps most well-known for his unusually long scarf and love of jelly babies. </p>

<p>His adventures — which ranged from gothic-themed B-movie pastiches to comedies influenced by script editor Douglas Adams — saw the Doctor face off against Daleks, robot mummies, murderous vegetation and vampires from the dawn of time. </p>

<p>He departed from the show at the conclusion of 'Logopolis' (to be replaced by Peter Davidson), an adventure that saw the Doctor injured falling from a radio telescope after saving the universe from the machinations of fellow Time Lord the Master (played by Anthony Ainley.) </p>

<p>A September 2020 poll by the Radio Times placed Tom Baker's performance as the favourite of the 'classic' Doctor Who leads — and fifth most-liked out of the main actors to have portrayed the role.</p>
