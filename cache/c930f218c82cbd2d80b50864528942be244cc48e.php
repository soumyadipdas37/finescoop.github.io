<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Champion jockey Oisin Murphy is facing a six-month ban from the sport after testing positive for cocaine.</p>

<p>The news comes as a huge bombshell for racing, with one of their star names facing a lengthy suspension if found guilty.</p>

<p>The positive test for the Class A drug came at a July screening at a race meeting in France, and The Sun report that the 25-year-old has been providing hair samples to the French authorities for the past month, which have come back negative.</p>

<p>Oisin Murphy could face a six-month ban from racing after failing a drugs test for cocaine</p>

<p>It has been reported that Murphy is now waiting on the results of a B sample, but if found guilty he could face a huge ban from the sport. The jockey alleges his positive sample came from a night out.</p>

<p>There is a chance Murphy could then appeal a guilty verdict, which means any decision on a ban will be delayed until after British Champions Day on October 17.</p>

<p>That would leave British racing chiefs in a difficult position, with the rider then potentially lifting a trophy at Ascot under a cloud.</p>

<p>Murphy, pictured riding at Newmarket last weekend, failed the test in France in July</p>

<p>The Irishman is one of racing's biggest stars, and was crowned champion apprentice in his first full season of racing back in 2014.</p>

<p>He won 168 rides in 2019 and was crowned Champion Jockey.</p>

<p>Murphy would not be the first high-profile jockey to face a drugs ban, following on from Frankie Dettori and Kieren Fallon.Â </p>

<p>Fallon was slapped with a six-month ban in 2006 and then an 18-month ban in 2008 following a second failed test, while Dettori was sidelined for six months after a registering a positive sample in 2012.</p>

<p>In 2017, Robert Havlin was also handed a lengthy ban, spending nearly 10 months out of the saddle after a failed drugs test in France.</p>
