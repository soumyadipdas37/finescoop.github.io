<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Trump’s approval rating has risen to the level before most of the country was forced to shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a public opinion poll.</p>

<p>A survey taken by Rasmussen Reports indicates that 52 per cent of Americans approve of the job the president is doing.</p>

<p>It is the first time since February 27 that Rasmussen has given Trump a 52 per cent approval rating.</p>

<p>In March, the coronavirus began to spread more widely forcing many states into lockdown.</p>

<p>The Trump administration was criticized for not taking the virus seriously enough and waiting too long to enact measures that could limit its spread.</p>

<p>The administration’s coronavirus response appears to account for the president’s relatively low approval ratings during the spring and summer months.</p>

<p>President Trump (left) has seen his approval ratings return to pre-COVID-19 levels, according to one polling organization, though other surveys show him trailing Joe Biden (right) in the race for the presidency</p>

<p>The latest Rasmussen survey found that 52 per cent of Americans approve of the job the president is doing - the first time since February 27 that Rasmussen has given Trump a 52 per cent approval rating. </p>

<p>Rasmussen, which is considered a polling organization that is friendly to the president, gave Trump a 42 per cent approval rating and a 55 per cent disapproval rating on June 29 - an all-time low.</p>

<p>At the time, the coronavirus began to make an even larger footprint in the middle of the country, where states had to adopt mitigation measures that negatively impacted the economy.</p>

<p>The president’s all-time high approval rating - 53 per cent - was recorded about a year ago, according to Rasmussen.</p>

<p>Trump’s high water mark bests that of his predecessor, Barack Obama, who peaked at 52 per cent in January 2011, according to Rasmussen.</p>

<p>Rasmussen conducts telephone surveys of 500 likely voters every night. It then compiles three-day rolling averages.</p>

<p>According to Rasmussen, Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, won re-election when they had 51 per cent approval ratings.</p>

<p>But other polling organizations believe that Trump’s approval rating is lower than what Rasmussen has found.</p>

<p>Trump is also believed to be on course to lose this November’s election to his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, the former vice president.</p>

<p>According to FiveThirtyEight, which factors in all available polling and then weighs them according to methodological standards and historical accuracy, Trump’s actual approval rating is 43.5 per cent while 52. 3 per cent of Americans disapprove.</p>

<p>FiveThirtyEight grades pollsters, including Rasmussen, by taking into account perceived biases and a record of accurately calling previous races. It gives Rasmussen a grade of C+.</p>

<p>As for this November’s presidential election, FiveThirtyEight’s projections give Biden a 70 per cent chance, while Trump has just a 30 per cent chance to win a second term.</p>

<p>Trump on Thursday lashed out at Fox News over the right-leaning network's new set of swing state polls, which showed the president losing to Biden.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Fox News released a fresh batch of polls that had Biden leading in Arizona, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Trump has traveled to both Wisconsin and North Carolina this week.</p>

<p>'Fox New polls are, as in the past, Fake News. They have been from the beginning, way off in 2016. Get a new pollster. I believe we are leading BIG!' Trump tweeted Thursday.</p>

<p>The US, which has now surpassed 6.19 million infections, has been averaging about 41,000 new COVID-19 cases per day for the past week.</p>

<p>Cases are now plateauing following an initial sharp decline in late July after surges in Sunbelt states saw average daily rates of 66,000.</p>

<p>Infections spiked across the US following previous holidays, including Memorial Day and July 4.</p>

<p>Health experts are warning that behaviors this Labor Day weekend will determine if there will be a COVID-19 spike in the fall - as a new forecast model is predicting that more than 410,000 Americans could die from COVID-19 by January if people don't continue to wear masks.</p>

<p>The University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation revised its forecast model on Friday to predict that deaths from COVID-19 will reach 410,000 by the end of the year.</p>

<p>That figure is more than double the current death toll of 187,750. The model predicts that deaths could also soar to 3,000 per day in December. </p>
