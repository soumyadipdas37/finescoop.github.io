<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A pregnant woman has been arrested in her own home over a Facebook post allegedly inciting anti-lockdown protest in Victoria.</p>

<p>Zoe Lee, 28, was handcuffed in her lounge room in front of her children on Wednesday afternoon and charged with incitement.</p>

<p>Several officers entered the house in Ballarat, northwest of Melbourne, with a search warrant and began reading the young mother her rights.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, incitement for what, what on Earth? I'm in my pyjamas, my two kids are here,' she said in obvious confusion.</p>

<p>'I have an ultrasound in an hour because I'm pregnant.'</p>

<p>Zoe Lee, 28, was handcuffed in her lounge room in front of her children on Wednesday afternoon and charged with incitement</p>

<p>Ms Lee's alleged offending post linked to a since-deleted 'Freedom Day Ballarat' event she created for 11am on Saturday on Sturt Street.</p>

<p>'Anyone from Ballarat please join us in our fight for freedom and human rights!' she wrote on Sunday with a link to the event page.</p>

<p>The increasingly hysterical mother insisted she wasn't breaking any laws by creating and then promoting the event. </p>

<p>'Actually you are, that's why we're arresting you in relation to incitement,' police replied.</p>

<p>Mother-of-two Ms Lee with her boyfriend James Timmins, who filmed her being arrested</p>

<p>Ms Lee's alleged offending post linked to a since-deleted 'Freedom Day Ballarat' event she created</p>

<p>Ms Lee offered to delete the post as her boyfriend James Timmins tried to mediate while cradling their infant child in his arms.</p>

<p>'How about she just doesn't do the event? It's not like she's done it, she made a post,' he said.</p>

<p>Police were unmoved, telling her: 'You've already committed the offence.'</p>

<p>Ms Lee was by this point crying so much she could barely protest 'I didn't realise I was doing anything wrong'.</p>

<p>Police said they would seize all electronic devices in the house including those belonging to Mr Timmins and Ms Lee's sister.  </p>

<p>Ms Lee allegedly created this event for Saturday at 11am on Sturt Street in Ballarat</p>
