<p>At the time, the England captain joked to his partner he would not cry on his wedding day and that he would only shed tears if England won a trophy. </p>

<p>He said: 'I always wind my missus up that I'd cry if we won a trophy with England. And she said if you don't cry when I walk down the aisle then she won't go through with it!</p>

<p>'I'm not a crier, I'm not someone who cries a lot. My missus has probably never seen me cry. So we'll have to see what comes first.'   </p>
