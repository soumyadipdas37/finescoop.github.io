<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Roy Keane clashed with Ian Wright on ITV whilst discussing James Ward-Prowse's sly tactics to cause Iceland's Birkir Bjarnason to miss a late penalty against England. </p>

<p>The Icelandic midfielder blazed over a stoppage time spot-kick just seconds after Raheem Sterling had put the Three Lions in front during England's 1-0 Nations League in Laugardalsvollur.</p>

<p>Replays showed that Ward-Prowse scuffed up the penalty spot with his boot just seconds before Bjarnson fired over, with ITV pundit Wright praising the Southampton man for using any means necessary to gain an advantage. </p>

<p>Footage shows James Ward-Prowse scuffing up the penalty spot just seconds before the miss</p>

<p>In the channel's England highlights show, Wright said: 'I don't mind that from an England player, (it's) a little bit of s***housery. </p>

<p>'What I like about Ward-Prowse is that he's got that about him, he's got that little bit of devil about him. </p>

<p>'It's cheating, maybe, but if that happens in a competition and we get something (good) from it then I'm not going to complain. It's happened and that gets us to the next round maybe. </p>

<p>Birkir Bjarnason (middle) went on to miss the spot-kick as England won 1-0 in the end</p>

<p>Wright hailed Ward-Prowse for the sneaky tactics, praising the 'devil' in him for doing it </p>

<p>Keane, however, was not best pleased with the tactics, and handed Wright an iconic death stare whilst hearing his views on the matter.</p>

<p>The former Manchester United captain then smirked: 'That's cheating. I don't like to see that. It's not allowed.'</p>

<p>Keane was also crticial of Bjarnason's pre-match attitude, as cameras showed the midfielder leaning against the wall while waiting to head of the tunnel just before the game. </p>

<p>Keane was less than impressed with the Southampton man's tactics and called it 'cheating'</p>

<p>Keane also slammed Bjarnsaon (second right)'s pre-match stance in the tunnel</p>

<p>Keane claimed he had no faith in the ex-Aston Villa man netting from the penalty spot because of his slack slance. </p>

<p>The Irishman continued: 'We spotted this before the game and that's why I never fancied him with the penalty. </p>

<p>'I understand players being relaxed sometimes but he's almost too relaxed. He looks like he's just waiting to go to the toilet or for a taxi.'</p>

<p>The victory for Gareth Southgate's side came in their first match of 2020 after the coronavirus hiatus delayed the March internationals and the 2020 European Champions - which will take place next summer. </p>
