<p>The 37-year-old actor in the black-and-white video stated that his late ex-wife's sister, Nickayla Rivera, moved in with him at the request of his five-year-old son Josey 'because she's now the closest thing he has to a mom'.</p>

<p>Ryan opened his post for his roughly 150,000 followers by stating his disbelief that he even had to address 'any of this nonsense'.</p>

<p>Emotional video: Ryan Dorsey posted an emotional video on Instagram on Tuesday slamming speculation about his relationship with the late Naya Rivera's sister</p>

<p>He revealed that he hasn't been following either social media or the news since former Glee star Naya accidentally drowned in July while boating on a lake with her young son.</p>

<p>'I usually don't read comments on my own stuff because I know how there can be 50 good things said and five negative ones. Somehow as humans we get those five negative ones stuck in our heads wondering how people could say certain things,' Ryan said.</p>

<p>He later blasted people for 'making assumptions' and wishing death upon strangers they 'know next to zero about'.</p>

<p>'It's truly sad that this is the world that we live in where people were raised to think it's OK to spew hatred, in general, especially when they make statements about a family who are dealing with a tragedy that I hope is so unimaginable that you or anyone that is close to you ever has to go through,' Ryan said.</p>

<p>Son's request: The 37-year-old actor in the black-and-white video stated that his late ex-wife's sister, Nickayla Rivera, moved in with him at the request of his five-year-old son Josey 'because she's now the closest thing he has to a mom'</p>

<p>He added that he 'can't even imagine' how he would feel as a parent if his child would 'do this to some strangers on social media' or in real life, while acknowledging it was unlikely that his own son would behave that way.</p>

<p>'He's a sweet, smart, caring, sweetest soul of a young man, who at the age of five is having to grow up so fast and grow up like so many of us didn't have to,' Ryan said.</p>

<p>'I think to myself how lucky I am to still have my mom and still have her help out in my life still," he shared, before describing his worries over Josey's future. "Then I think about how he won't have that same opportunity in his future. It makes me beyond sad. I ask myself why? What did he do to deserve this? I know he didn't do anything to deserve this, but the things people have said are sad,' he said. </p>

<p>Addressing nonsense: Ryan opened his post for his roughly 150,000 followers by stating his disbelief that he even had to address 'any of this nonsense'</p>

<p>Ryan also shared that he's 'probably lost a little over 20 pounds' since Naya's death on July 8.</p>

<p>He also talked about the nearly week-long search for Naya after she was reported missing on Lake Piru and said Josey was hopeful that his mother would be found alive.</p>

<p>'You know he's so smart and you know he witnessed a nightmare right before his eyes,' Ryan said. 'Then when you're with him every day during this, with his grandpas, and his grandmas, and his aunts and his uncles, and his whole family, and all you have is each other to lean on and to cry with, and you go through this nightmare. It's sad. The reality hits you and the grieving can start, but the sadness gets heavier because you know you're going to have to have conversation one on one with a little boy and tell him about our new reality.'</p>

<p>Ryan said that he told Josey that Naya was in heaven and the boy asked, 'Well, I want to go there. How do I get there?'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't wish that upon any of your ears to have to hear those words come out of the sweetest soul you know,' he added.</p>

<p>Weight loss: The actor also shared that he's 'probably lost a little over 20 pounds' since Naya's death on July 8</p>

<p>He then confirmed that Nickayla, 26, moved in at the request of his son.</p>

<p>'[Josey] asks me if Titi can live with us. ''I want Titi to live with us forever,'' because she's now the closest thing he has to a mom. You're going to need all the help you can get as a single parent trying to build your career and navigate this disaster with your child,' Ryan said.</p>

<p>Ryan said that he was determined to give Josey the family that he asked for even though 'it's temporary and it's not forever'.</p>

<p>'It's a temporary situation. After all that he's had to go through how could you deny him that? Because of what? What some strangers might think or say, or spew some hatred based on some ill-advised, ill-logical, misinformed tabloid?,' he added.</p>

<p>He praised model Nickayla and her family for supporting him after the tragedy.</p>

<p>'To have a young woman who is his blood, his Titi, who is willing to put her life on hold and sacrifice things, uproot her situation for the betterment of your child,' Ryan said.</p>

<p>Single parent: '[Josey] asks me if Titi can live with us. ''I want Titi to live with us forever,'' because she's now the closest thing he has to a mom. You're going to need all the help you can get as a single parent trying to build your career and navigate this disaster with your child,' Ryan said</p>

<p>The Ray Donovan actor said Nickayla has been helping him cope with his grief.</p>

<p>'So when you put your child to bed you don't always have to be alone with your thoughts and you don't have to be sad any day or night wondering when does it get better. At least you have someone there with you to talk to or just sit in silence and be sad with. You don't have to deal with being completely alone,' he said.</p>

<p>He also said that he hoped nobody in a similar position would have to deal with 'people following you or take pictures and creating a false narrative'.</p>

<p>Ryan described how two women who were 'not being covert at all, being disrespectful' as they followed him and Nickayla when they bought items for Josey's birthday party.</p>

<p>Former couple: Naya and Ryan are shown in January 2016 in Beverly Hills, California</p>

<p>He branded the speculation that they were in a relationship as 'absurd'.</p>

<p>'S*** man, I wish I was worried about a relationship right now. Not thinking about this and living with this every day,' Ryan said.</p>

<p>Ryan ended his video by sharing his hope that people will 'think twice before they go insert their opinion and jump to conclusions. Think about sending people DM's wishing death upon strangers who are dealing with so much that they know absolutely zero about'.</p>

<p>Major sacrifice: Nickayla, shown on Instagram with her late sister Naya in an August 2016 post, moved in with Ryan at the request of her nephew Josey</p>

<p>Nickayla addressed the speculation Monday on Instagram as she posted, 'What matters most I've learned, is to show compassion, not to judge others, &amp; never take a moment of life for granted. I hope you all do the same'.</p>

<p>Ryan and Naya got married on his birthday in July 2014 in Mexico and welcomed Josey on September 17, 2015.</p>
