<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sydneysiders are furious after a major threatened to shut down an iconic eastern suburbs beach this summer if crowds get too big amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Bondi Beach and other beaches were closed during March and April during the first coronavirus wave, and only reopened in May under strict restrictions.  </p>

<p>With more locals heading to the sand as the weather warms up, Waverley Mayor Paula Masselos warned beaches could close if large crowds pose a public health risk. </p>

<p>'If people don't do the right thing, and the beach has become too crowded then we'll have to look at how we manage those numbers because I don't want a repeat of what happened back in in March,' she told the ABC. </p>

<p>The warnings come after massive crowds of people flocked to beaches across Sydney last Sunday to enjoy the start of spring (Bondi Beach pictured)</p>

<p>'I think things are different and they'll have to be different because we're still in the middle of a pandemic.'</p>

<p>While Ms Masselos said she hopes beaches can remain open, locals have slammed the possibility as 'increasingly draconian'. </p>

<p>'I think it's probably safer to be outside down the beach rather than indoors at shopping centres and workplaces,' one Sydneysider wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>'Ridiculous. Beaches are places where people keep their distance naturally. If you can spend your whole day at a shopping centre, why not a couple of hours on the beach?' wrote another. </p>

<p>'The inconsistency of our increasingly draconian governments is getting laughable.'</p>

<p>'How can the beach be any worse than going to a supermarket? Police the behaviour, not the location. Social distancing is the same no matter where you do it,' another comment read.</p>

<p>'How can Scomo hold NSW as the golden state when you cannot go to the beach as normal. Stop messing around and get rid of the virus.'</p>

<p>Northern Beaches Council has also threatened to close its beaches 'if crowds become too large and unmanageable'.</p>

<p>CEO Ray Brownlee said rangers and lifeguards will continue to monitor coastal areas, and ensure the four-square-metre rule is being adhered to. </p>

<p>Sydney locals have slammed the possibility of beach closures as 'increasingly draconian' and said supermarkets pose a higher health risk </p>

<p>'Council is also increasing its cleansing regime of popular outdoor public places, providing extra restrooms in key locations, and reviewing the need for Council-sponsored outdoor events during summer,' he said. </p>

<p>During the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Sydney, some councils closed car parks, erected 'swim and go' signs and used restricted entry points to deter beachgoers.</p>

<p>The warnings come after massive crowds of people flocked to beaches across Sydney last Sunday to enjoy the start of spring.</p>

<p>Bondi and Coogee beaches were packed with thousands of people by midday while Manly Beach was much the same.</p>

<p>Lifeguards used loudspeaker systems to try and encourage swimmers and sunbakers to practice social distancing but photographs showed crowds packed together like sardines on the shore.</p>
