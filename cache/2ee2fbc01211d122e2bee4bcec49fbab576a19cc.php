<p>Since the birth of her seven-month-old daughter, Tullulah, the model has struggled to get any time to herself because newborns 'are so dependent on you'.</p>

<p>The former Miss Universe Australia, 29, told The Daily Telegraph on Thursday it was important to take time for oneself 'because otherwise your life becomes taken over by running the house and being a mum'.</p>

<p>Inner peace: Jesinta Franklin (pictured) is making it her mission to spend more time on herself now that her seven-month-old daughter, Tullulah, isn't so dependent on her</p>

<p>She spoke about her struggle to make time for herself during a photo shoot announcing Crown Sydney's partnership with Grown Alchemist.</p>

<p>It comes ahead of the casino complex opening in Sydney in December.</p>

<p>'In those first few months, there is no time for yourself. You really become dedicated naturally to your child and all of their needs because they are so dependent on you,' she said. </p>

<p>Priorities: The model, 29, said on Thursday it was important to take time for oneself 'because otherwise your life becomes taken over by running the house and being a mum' </p>

<p>'Now [Tullulah] is not so dependent on me, finding that time for myself is really important because otherwise your life becomes taken over by running the house and being a mum.'</p>

<p>Jesinta hopes to enjoy more quality time with her husband, Lance 'Buddy' Franklin, in the coming weeks, after he recently spent seven weeks away from his family playing AFL in Queensland.</p>

<p>The duo were separated due to the COVID-19 pandemic forcing footy players to self-isolate in 'hubs' away from the general public in order to compete. </p>

<p>At the time, Jesinta shared a post to Instagram about how much she was missing her husband.</p>

<p>'Happy 1st Father's Day <?php echo e('@'); ?>buddy_franklin23,' she wrote. 'So sad we can't be with you today. We are sending lots of virtual cuddles via FaceTime. </p>

<p>'Big love to all the other families who can't be together today x.' </p>

<p>Jesinta also told The Daily Telegraph she and Buddy 'would love to give Tullulah a brother or a sister' someday.</p>
