<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the shocking moment a racist pensioner is beaten up by two black passengers after he called them 'monkeys' on a bus in north London yesterday.  </p>

<p>The confrontation took place on a street around Edgware at around 6pm yesterday. </p>

<p>In the footage, the pensioner is accused of calling the black passengers 'monkeys' to which he replies: 'Yes you're a monkey'. </p>

<p>Other passengers stand between the arguing parties and try to defuse the situation, while encouraging the two black commuters to leave the bus. </p>

<p>They do, but more angry words are exchanged before the pensioner jumps to his feet and appears to swing at the black passengers. </p>

<p>He is then punched several times, leaving him with a black eye and a bump on his head.</p>

<p>The pensioner is accused of calling the black passengers 'monkeys' to which he replies: 'Yes you're a monkey'</p>

<p>The pensioner jumps to his feet and appears to swing at the black passengers. He is then punched several times, leaving him with a black eye and a bump on his head</p>

<p>The video was posted by Instagram user <?php echo e('@'); ?>jayjaydax who claimed that the man had racially abused the group of young passengers prior to the fight - calling the group 'monkeys' and 'n******'.</p>

<p>She wrote: 'We had just gotten on the bus, we decided to stand because the back had a couple people. My cousin was leaning on the hand bars and the man randomly pushed his elbow off. So he did the normal thing and turned around confused and asked, ''Why did you push my arm off?''</p>

<p>'The man then replied by shouting don't talk to me you monkey which is when my friend turned around and said what did you say.</p>

<p>'We were all so shocked and then the man proceeded by shouting ''Stop talking to me you monkeys, f*** off'' repeatedly.</p>

<p>She claims that another passenger on the bus reported the elderly man to the bus driver who called the police.</p>

<p>But she adds: 'The bus driver called the police on the white man but they clearly didn't get there in time. The man then began calling us n***** and saying we shouldn't be on the bus. He then kept coming forward as if he was going to push us.</p>

<p>'But then as you can see in the video, he ended up actually swinging for my friends which is why they hit him. It was simply self defence.'</p>

<p>The camerawoman said that the other bus passengers advised that the group leave the scene before the police arrived at the incident: 'Everybody on the bus suggested us leaving. They all already know how the system is. We would have been arrested.' </p>

<p>At the start of the clip, a young male in the group asks the old man: 'So we're all monkeys? I'm a monkey yeah?'</p>

<p>The pensioner retorts: 'F*** off! Yes you're a monkey.'</p>

<p>In the next clip, the black passenger vows to hurt the pensioner but his friends attempt to restrain him and beg him not to fight.</p>

<p>However, the young male continues raging and says: 'I'm going to f*** you up! Get off the bus!'</p>

<p>Hearing this threat, the furious pensioner gets up from his seat and starts to approach the younger man. </p>

<p>He shouts: 'Come on and come back I got ya!'</p>

<p>Other passengers stand between the pensioner and the black commuters and try to defuse the situation. One of the black passengers leaves the bus, though the confrontation continues</p>

<p>In a lengthy post accompanying the clip, <?php echo e('@'); ?>jayjaydax wrote: 'Imagine being on the bus minding your business when a man begins calling you a monkey and a n***** and shouting at you to get off the bus. Keep in mind he tried swinging first'</p>

<p>Several passengers try to restrain the pair as the black passenger says: 'Come off the bus now!'</p>

<p>But the pensioner shouts back 'I'm not getting off the f*cking bus!' </p>

<p>Passengers manage to briefly separate the pair and get the young male to exit the bus, though they continue shouting at each other.</p>

<p>The argument gets increasingly heated and another young male starts pushing his way back on the bus. </p>

<p>He comes towards the pensioner who tries to swing a punch at the young man and fails.</p>

<p>This leads to the young male repeatedly punching the pensioner in the head with a second black passenger getting involved too.</p>

<p>Eventually the two young males' friends pull him off the old man and tell them to 'leave it'. </p>

<p>In a final clip, the elderly man is seen bleeding with a black eye and a huge bump on his head from the fight. </p>

<p>An older bystander on the bus is heard telling the young group who beat the pensioner: 'If the police come, you are going to get in trouble!'</p>

<p>The pensioner continues sitting in his seat with blood and bruises on his heads as the video cuts to an end.</p>
