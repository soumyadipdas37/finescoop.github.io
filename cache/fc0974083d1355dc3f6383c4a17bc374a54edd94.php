<p>In a warning to other parents shared on social media, the sister said one of the gang 'tried to rip' the one-year-old from the pram before they fled the scene at the TK Maxx in Crewe</p>

<p>She wrote: 'I can't believe these four people tried to chore my one-year-old baby sister.</p>

<p>'They tried to rip her out the pram and followed the children around the shop. I'm reporting it to the police.'</p>

<p>The post attracted hundreds of comments, with one worried Facebook user adding: 'Same thing happened to us a month ago, tried to rip the child out through the back window on the car and we were sat in it.'</p>

<p>The post quickly attracted hundreds of comments leading to another woman coming forward according to Stoke on Trent Live.</p>

<p>She said: 'I was in Aldi earlier with my 17-week-old baby and they were acting so weirdly, leaning into his pram staring at him and watching my every move.</p>

<p>'They were following me around the store and I left in the end because of them!</p>

<p>'I honestly think if he didn't have the rain cover over him for COVID reasons, they would have fully reached in and tried to take him too.</p>

<p>'They were acting so weird, watching my every move and staring at my baby into the pram. They made me feel so uncomfortable.</p>

<p>'I was staring the woman out to let her know I saw what she was doing and to back off but they wouldn't leave me and my baby alone.</p>

<p>'It really freaked me out, it's definitely the same people.'  </p>

<p>A spokesman for Cheshire Police said they were aware of the report and added:' The incident has not been reported to us and we would encourage anyone with any information to report this to Cheshire Police via 101 or https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report'</p>

<p>It comes after reports there had been at least six kidnapping attempts in Worcester after men in a silver car tried to kidnap women and girls on six occasions since September 10.</p>

<p>On Sunday, a 15-year-old girl told police a car full of men had pulled up along side her while she walked to the shops and one had attempted to grab her. </p>
