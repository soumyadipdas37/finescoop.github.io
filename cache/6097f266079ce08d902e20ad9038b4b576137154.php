<p>SpaceX's Starlink satellite constellation grew a little larger Thursday morning, as the firm added 60 more devices to the network. The Falcon 9 rocket took off at 8:46am ET from Launch Complex 39-A at Kennedy Space Center carrying the new batch of broadband satellites</p>

<p>'What a beautiful sight,' SpaceX engineer and launch commentator Kate Tice said after the satellites floated away after a smooth deployment.</p>

<p>Falcon 9 took off on time, roaring its engines and releasing a stream of while smoke.</p>

<p>SpaceX had originally set Sunday as the launch day, which was set to see two separate Falcon 9 rockets take off from the Florida launch pad and would have been a first for the firm.</p>

<p>Stormy weather rolled in and thunderstorms forced the team to abort the mission, but the crew was able to send the new batch into orbit Thursday.</p>

<p>SpaceX confirmed the 60 Starlinks successfully deployed from the rocket's upper stage and are now floating in orbit.</p>

<p>Shortly after deployment, the Falcon 9 booster returned to Earth and landed on SpaceX's drone ship 'Of Course I Still Love You.'</p>

<p>The firm shared a tweet shortly after the mission regarding the satellites: 'In initial tests of Starlink, the team has been collecting latency data and performing standard speed tests of the system.'</p>

<p>'Results from these tests have shown super low latency and download speeds greater than 100 mbps – fast enough to stream multiple HD movies at once and still have bandwidth to spare.'</p>

<p>Internet service will first rollout as a pilot, which the firm said it needs about 800 satellites to start and has begun signups to test the technology. This is SpaceX's 12th Starlink satellite mission</p>

<p>SpaceX has hit a few bumps along its career, but has recently made strides in launching rockets. Just two weeks ago, it completed the first test flight of the massive Starship rocket that soared nearly 500 feet into the air</p>

<p>CEO Elon Musk has said that the price for the Internet - which promises gigabit speeds with 15 to 25ms latency - will be about $80 per month, making it competitive with other traditional high-speed providers like Verizon Fios. </p>

<p>The firm aims to have more than 1,000 satellites in orbit by the end of the year and has also been approved by the FCC to launch over 12,000 in total. </p>

<p>None of SpaceX's recent accomplishments can compare to their joint mission with NASA in May that sent astronauts Doug Hurley(left)  and Bob Behnken (right) to the International Space Station</p>

<p>The crew took off in an America rocket from Florida – a feat that has not been done in nearly nine years</p>

<p>The rocket, which aims to one-day bring humans to Mars, has experienced a number of setbacks – specifically exploding during testing.</p>

<p>And the SN6 prototype could make its first 'hop' today at the SpaceX testing facility in Boca Chica, Texas.</p>

<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched the fifth batch of its 'Starlink' space internet satellites - taking the total to 300.</p>

<p>They form a constellation of thousands of satellites, designed to provide low-cost broadband internet service from low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>The constellation, informally known as Starlink, and under development at SpaceX's facilities in Redmond, Washington.</p>

<p>Its goal is to beam superfast internet into your home from space.</p>

<p>While satellite internet has been around for a while, it has suffered from high latency and unreliable connections.</p>

<p>Starlink is different. SpaceX says putting a 'constellation' of satellites in low earth orbit would provide high-speed, cable-like internet all over the world.</p>

<p>The billionaire's company wants to create the global system to help it generate more cash.</p>

<p>Musk has previously said the venture could give three billion people who currently do not have access to the internet a cheap way of getting online.</p>

<p>It could also help fund a future city on Mars.</p>

<p>Helping humanity reach the red planet is one of Musk's long-stated aims and was what inspired him to start SpaceX.</p>

<p>The company recently filed plans with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to launch 4,425 satellites into orbit above the Earth - three times as many that are currently in operation.</p>

<p>'Once fully deployed, the SpaceX system will pass over virtually all parts of the Earth's surface and therefore, in principle, have the ability to provide ubiquitous global service,' the firm said.</p>

<p>'Every point on the Earth's surface will see, at all times, a SpaceX satellite.'</p>

<p>The network will provide internet access to the US and the rest of the world, it added.</p>

<p>It is expected to take more than five years and $9.8 billion (£7.1bn) of investment, although satellite internet has proved an expensive market in the past and analysts expect the final bill will be higher.</p>

<p>Musk compared the project to 'rebuilding the internet in space', as it would reduce reliance on the existing network of undersea fibre-optic cables which criss-cross the planet.</p>

<p>In the US, the FCC welcomed the scheme as a way to provide internet connections to more people.</p>
