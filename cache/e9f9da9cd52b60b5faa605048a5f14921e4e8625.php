<p>'I can't fathom life without you': Lucy Watson has revealed her pet dog Digby passed away over the weekend</p>

<p>The reality star wrote in a heart-breaking post: '3 weeks ago today was one of the happiest days of my life. 3 days ago was the worst. I lost my best friend.</p>

<p>'I still can’t believe this has happened and I honestly can’t fathom life without you, Digby.</p>

<p>'Life will bring you so high and then it will drop to a low you never thought possible. I knew this day would come, I used to tear up just thinking about it. </p>

<p>'I wish more than anything that we could have had more time together... But I am so beyond grateful for the time we did get to share and I know I loved you as much as physically possible every single day. </p>

<p>'Thank you for everything you taught me, it was the biggest honour to be loved by you (I know you were picky). Forever in our hearts ❤️ never to be forgotten.'</p>

<p>Lucy bought Digby, who was originally named Kevin, from Harrods' The Pet Kingdom in November 2013.</p>

<p>The media personality also expressed her gratitude towards fellow social media users who reached out to her with supportive messages.</p>

<p>Jewellery entrepreneur Lucy wrote: 'Thank you to everyone who has messaged me. It breaks my heart to hear how many of you have experienced a similar situation and I'm sorry to all of those that have gone or are going through this unbearable pain.' </p>

<p>The passing of Digby has no doubt come as shock to Lucy and her new fiancé James, 31, who popped the question during a romantic boat trip in Greece earlier this month.</p>

<p>Lucy and James have been going strong ever since meeting on the E4 series back in 2015, following her ill-fated flings with Andy Jordan, Jamie Laing, Spencer Matthews and Oliver Proudlock.</p>

<p>The loved-up duo left the show just a year after embarking on a relationship and bought their first home in London in August 2017.</p>

<p>They spent nearly 12 months renovating their Victorian home, an experience Lucy previously insisted was 'great' for their romance. </p>

<p>The designer told MailOnline in 2018: 'James is obsessed! He is really into architecture and interiors, and he's so hands on. Actually, I didn’t realise how hands on he'd be.</p>

<p>'At first, we clashed a bit. I am so stubborn and so is he. But then you just realise that you’re good at that and I’m good at that so it's best to work together. It's been great for our relationship.'</p>

<p>On how they've managed to maintain a long-lasting romance, the brunette told added: 'You have to choose the person that you’re with. </p>

<p>'You can fall into loads of relationships with people you just end up with, but you have to look at whether their personality and goals match up to yours. </p>

<p>'It breaks my heart': The media personality also expressed her gratitude towards fellow social media users who reached out to her with supportive messages</p>

<p>'I think a lot of people just end up falling into things, and it doesn’t work out as there wasn’t a lot of thought process that went into it.'</p>

<p>At the time, Lucy insisted she didn't feel pressured to get married or have kids, explaining: 'I don’t know when, but I know James will probably be the person I end up with, unless something drastic happens. </p>

<p>'I’m settled now for the foreseeable. Unlike my friends, I don’t have any set goals for marriage and kids. They put a lot of pressure on themselves to reach those goals, but I don’t. When it feels right for both us, then we will, but we’ll have to see.' </p>

<p>Nowadays, the influencer focuses on her accessory brand Creature Jewellery and vegan ventures, while the hunk is signed to Models 1 Management.</p>
