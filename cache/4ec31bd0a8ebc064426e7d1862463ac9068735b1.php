<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Waitrose has revealed plans to close four of its supermarkets, with the loss of 124 jobs - but one will be reborn as a Tesco.</p>

<p>The grocery chain said it will shut its Caldicot, Ipswich Corn Exchange and Shrewsbury sites, and sell its Wolverhampton store to rival Tesco.</p>

<p>It said it made the decision to shut the branches after it struggled to make them "profitable in the long-term" after a period of "challenging trading".</p>

<p>The Caldicot, Ipswich and Shrewsbury stores will close on December 6.</p>

<p>Waitrose said 124 staff at the three stores will face redundancy and will now enter into consultations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all 140 staff at the Wolverhampton store, which will shut on December 31, will be transferred to Tesco as part of the sale.</p>

<p>Three Waitrose stores will be shut while one will be sold on, together with staff, to Tesco</p>

<p>The closures are part of an ongoing review of the Waitrose store estate which started in 2017.</p>

<p>Berangere Michel, executive director of customer service for the John Lewis Partnership, said: "Closing any of our shops is always a last resort and is not a reflection on the dedication of our partners in Caldicot, Ipswich Corn Exchange, Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton.</p>

<p>"Sadly, we have not been able to find a way to make these shops profitable in the long-term, despite the hard work of everyone involved.</p>

<p>Wolverhampton's Waitrose (pictured) will be closed but its staff taken on by Tesco</p>

<p>"Our priority now is the wellbeing and future of our partners in these shops.</p>

<p>"We will do everything we can to support them and explore opportunities wherever possible for those who may wish to remain with the partnership."</p>

<p>Parent business John Lewis Partnership had said in July that it could close more of the supermarket arm's outlets as part of cost-saving measures.</p>

<p>Berangere Michel, executive director of customer service, said moves were 'last resort'</p>

<p>The group previously announced the closure of eight John Lewis retail sites, which put 1,300 jobs at risk, as part of its turnaround efforts.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the group will update staff on the progress of its strategic review and reveal how trading has been impacted by coronavirus.</p>

<p>Waitrose is expected to reveal higher sales after being boosted by demand for groceries and online deliveries in the face of the pandemic.</p>
