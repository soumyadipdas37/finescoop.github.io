<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Joe Rogan fans have been left disappointed after the outspoken comedian's podcast back-catalog was noticeably missing controversial episodes featuring the likes of InfoWars host Alex Jones and comedian Chris D'Elia who has been accused of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>The Joe Rogan Experience arrived on the music streaming service Tuesday, potentially taking listeners from the likes of Apple and Google where previous episodes are available.</p>

<p>However social media users and even past guests who episodes were missing suggested Spotify had censored the clips they wondered whether Rogan's $100million deal announced in May meant his non-politically correct style would change.</p>

<p>'If they left these podcast out just think about how many guest he can't have on without spotify's approval, so much for free speech Joe,' one fan wrote.</p>

<p>Joe Rogan fans have been left disappointed after the outspoken comedian's Spotify podcast back-catalog was noticeably missing controversial episodes</p>

<p>Interviews featuring the likes of InfoWars host Alex Jones (pictured) were not initially available but Jones said in a video that he spoke to Rogan who said the  interviews will be uploaded later</p>

<p>Others said Rogan was 'dead to me' if he didn't address the issue and claimed he had 'sold out.'</p>

<p>Rogan had previously reassured fans that the show will be exactly the same and it was just a licensing deal, 'so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.'</p>

<p>However the missing episodes prompted social media users to confront the brand online as they suggested Rogan may have had no idea himself that certain interviews were missing.</p>

<p>'When can we expect to see the full library of <?php echo e('@'); ?>joerogan's JRE Podcast on your platform? Some eps are missing,' one fan tweeted Spotify just minutes after the September 1 switchover began.</p>

<p>Spotify's customer care account managers seemed to believe it was down to a user glitch with one social media manager replying, 'Sorry for the confusion! Could you DM us your account's email address? We'll take a look backstage.'</p>

<p>Another replied: 'Can you tell us more about what's happening exactly? We'll help out.'</p>

<p>Rogan switched to the streaming service as part of a $100million deal that started Tuesday but some fans said he had 'sold out' when they saw missing clips</p>

<p>Blogger Mikhaila Peterson, the daughter of controversial professor and public speaker Jordan Peterson, said that her episode being left out was worse than getting demonetized from YouTube</p>

<p>However her August 2018 episode was added after she went on a Twitter rant on Tuesday</p>

<p>After others chimed in with accusations of censorship, the Spotify Cares account responded that it would pass along their 'input to the team for review.'</p>

<p>Some fans called it a 'huge fail' from Spotify and threatened to boycott the brand, noting that it was too much of a coincidence that the episodes missing happened to be some of the most controversial.</p>

<p>One includes where Joey Diaz joked about coercing female comics into performing oral sex —</p>

<p>An episode featuring marijuana activist Tommy Chong was also missing.</p>

<p>Eagle-eyed fans also pointed out that podcasts featuring right-wing figures such as Owen Benjamin, Stefan Molyneux, Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McInnes and Charles C. Johnson hadn't been uploaded.</p>

<p>Blogger Mikhaila Peterson, the daughter of controversial professor and public speaker Jordan Peterson, said that her episode being left out was worse than getting demonetized from YouTube.</p>

<p>'At least they didn't shut down my channel. However this is COMPLETELY different,' she tweeted on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Others were missing, including one in June with Chris D'Elia (left) who said he had never 'knowingly pursued any underage women at any point'</p>

<p>As others wondered whether the missing episodes were a stunt to generate a buzz about the switchover and demand for the interviews, Peterson tweeted: 'Is it censorship? A mistake!? Was it Joe's decision? Is it censorship!? Dun dun dunnnn.'</p>

<p>Day one of the programming on Spotify kicked off with a five-hour-long marathon cast with actor Duncan Trussell.</p>

<p>Shortly after she asked whether she was 'making a fuss for no reason,' noting that it was only the first day of the deal, Peterson told followers that 'Alex Jones says these episodes will be uploaded at a later date and it is not censorship.'</p>

<p>Her episode is now streaming on Spotify. </p>

<p>However others were missing, including one in June with Chris D'Elia who said he had never 'knowingly pursued any underage women at any point.'</p>

<p>Several women have recently claimed he exposed himself to them including actress Megan Drust, Laura Vitarelli, and another woman who has asked to remain anonymous for personal reasons.</p>

<p>Jones said in a video addressing the controversy that the podcast is currently in a 'no man's land' while they continue to migrate episodes until the end of September when it will exclusively be on Spotify.</p>
