<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The husband of a Russian socialite who is the Conservative Party's biggest female donor was secretly funded by an oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin, leaked files allegedly reveal.</p>

<p>Lubov Chernukhin has given £1.7m to the Tories and spent personal time with the last three Prime Ministers, including a dinner with Theresa May and tennis against Boris Johnson and David Cameron.</p>

<p>Now documents show her husband, Vladimir, was handed $8m (£6.1m), which initially came from a gold mining oligarch who is subject to American sanctions because of his close links to the Kremlin.</p>

<p>The findings were revealed in a BBC Panorama report based on a major leak of banks' 'suspicious activity reports', called the FinCen Files. Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers denied her donations were tainted with Kremlin interference.</p>

<p>Lubov Chernukhin has given £1.7m to the Tories and spent personal time with the last three Prime Ministers, including a dinner with Theresa May and tennis with Boris Johnson and David Cameron</p>

<p>Vladimir Chernukhin was sent the money in 2016 from a British Virgin Islands company linked to Suleyman Kerimov, a member of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament.</p>

<p>Kerimov was sanctioned by US officials in 2018 as part of a drive against those who 'play a key role in advancing Russia's malign activities'. He is also under investigation in France over claims of tax fraud.</p>

<p>Mr Chernukhin, 52, served as deputy minister of finance under Putin before he was sacked in 2004 and moved to London. He and his wife are now one of the most prominent Russian-born couples in the city and both have British citizenship.</p>

<p>Mrs Chernukhin began donating to the Conservative Party in 2012 with the majority - more than £1.5m - coming after the £6.1m payment linked to Mr Kerimov. However, it is not clear if any of this money went to the Tories.</p>

<p>The revelations come amid increasing scrutiny of large donations made to political parties from wealthy Britain-based Russians, with a parliamentary report recently claiming they could allow people to 'assist Russian influence operations'.</p>

<p>The Russia specialist Ed Lucas, who spoke at the official inquiry into Russian influence, told Panorama: 'The Chernukhins, pleasant people that they might be… are not fit and proper people to make donations to a British political party.'</p>

<p>Mrs Chernukhin contributed over £335,000 to the Conservative Party between January and July this year, according to Electoral Commission records.</p>

<p>The banker, 48, gave £200,000 to the Tory election campaign on November 6 last year, the same day the last parliament was dissolved for the general election. </p>

<p>Now documents show her husband, Vladimir, (left, when he served as deputy finance minister under Putin) was handed $8m (£6.1m), which initially came from a gold mining oligarch who is subject to American sanctions because of his close links to the Kremlin</p>

<p>Mr Chernukhin was sent the money in 2016 from a British Virgin Islands company linked to Suleyman Kerimov, (pictured) a member of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament</p>

<p>Records also show Mrs Chernukhin made two separate donations of £200,000 and £45,000 on March 16, alongside more than £59,000 on February 27.</p>

<p>The consultant has previously been named as the donor who shelled out for a place on the tennis court with Boris Johnson at a Tory fundraiser in February.</p>

<p>The election regulator said Mrs Chernukhin has given a total of £1,765,804 to the Party since she started donating in 2012, according to The Times.</p>

<p>She also enjoyed a night out with former PM May and six female Cabinet members at the exclusive Goring Hotel in London's Belgravia in April last year after donating £135,000 at another fundraiser.</p>

<p>At the time, the Tory Party insisted she was not a 'Putin crony' after she donated more than £1million over seven years.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson was challenged about the Chernukhins' £160,000 tennis match donation in 2018 when he was foreign secretary. </p>

<p>He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'If there is evidence of gross corruption in the way that gentleman… obtained his wealth... then it's possible for our law enforcement agencies to deprive him of his wealth.'</p>

<p>But he added 'all possible checks have been made and... will continue to be made' on donations. </p>

<p>The FinCEN files have prompted a raft of startling allegations, including that some of the biggest banks let criminals and fraudsters move dirty money around the world.</p>

<p>HSBC is one of several international banks whose name appears most in the cache of thousands of secret US government documents.</p>

<p>They show that HSBC continued shuttling funds through to accounts in Hong Kong months after it was warned about a Ponzi scheme worth £62 million.</p>

<p>When HSBC, the UK's largest bank, closed down the fraudsters' accounts they had already been drained of the millions.</p>

<p>HSBC said in a statement that 'all of the information provided by the ICIJ is historical.'</p>

<p>The bank said as of 2012, 'HSBC embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime across more than 60 jurisdictions.'</p>

<p>Along with HSBC, the other international banks which appeared most often in the documents were JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered and Bank of New York Mellon, the ICIJ reported.</p>

<p>Among the types of transactions highlighted by the report: funds processed by JPMorgan for potentially corrupt individuals and companies in Venezuela, Ukraine and Malaysia; and money linked to a Ukrainian billionaire processed by Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>One of Vladimir Putin's closest friends, billionaire Arkady Rotenberg may have used Barclays Bank in London to launder cash and avoid sanctions, the documents suggest.</p>

<p>In March 2014, Russia was hit with sanctions after the annexation of Crimea.</p>

<p>Rotenberg, a childhood friend of Putin, and his brother Boris were designated 'members of the Russian leadership's inner circle,' by the US Treasury Department.</p>

<p>It is alleged that an account called Advantage Alliance, set up with Barclays in 2008, was used by Rotenberg to transfer funds to buy millions of pounds worth of art in London.</p>

<p>The leaked dossiers suggest that many of the transactions through the account came after the Rotenberg brothers had been sanctioned.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Barclays said: 'We believe that we have complied with all our legal and regulatory obligations including in relation to US sanctions.'</p>

<p>'Given the filing of a SAR (suspicious activity report) is not itself evidence of any actual wrongdoing, we would only terminate a client relationship after careful and objective investigation and analysis of the evidence, balancing potential financial crime suspicions with the risk of 'de-banking' an innocent customer.'</p>

<p>The Rotenbergs have not commented.</p>

<p>The FinCEN documents are mostly files banks sent to the US authorities between 2000 and 2017, raising concerns about suspicious activity in their clients' accounts, Panorama said.</p>

<p>The programme called the documents 'some of the international banking system's most closely guarded secrets'. </p>
