<p>Police allege the pair got into a fight with a woman at 2.30pm onSaturday when Mr Sirbadhoo, 35, was injured.</p>

<p>Daniel John Gorshenin (pictured), 35, was arrested after Rohan Sirbadhoo was allegedly stabbed in his stomach at a home at Collaroy on Sydney's Northern Beaches</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gorshenin was arrested at a home in Davidson and was charged with reckless wounding to cause actual bodily harm.</p>

<p>Gorshenin appeared at Parramatta Bail Court via video link from Surry Hills police station on Sunday where he was seen muttering to himself 'this is crazy, crazy, crazy man' and 'the victim? what the f**k'.</p>

<p>Magistrate Andrew George had to tell the 35-year-old to be quiet.</p>

<p>'Do you want bail? You'll keep quiet, if I hear any more profanity … you will be refused bail – you are charged with a very serious offence,' he warned. </p>

<p>Police are investigating whether a possible love triangle triggered the alleged stabbing as the woman is believed to have known both men.</p>

<p>But Mr Sirbadhoo and Gorshenin were not known to each other, the court heard. </p>

<p>Gorshenin's defence lawyer pushed for him to be released on bail, stating he acted in self-defence.</p>

<p>She also said if the 35-year-old is held in custody the matter may not be resolved for a long time due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The magistrate granted bail but dubbed the self-defence line as 'lame'.</p>

<p>'I really can't see that being seen as an excuse in the circumstances,' Mr George said. </p>

<p>Under his bail conditions, Gorshenin is subject to an 8pm to 5am house curfew.</p>

<p>He must report to Bondi Police Station daily and cannot enter or go within 1km of the northern beaches unless attending court. </p>

<p>He is also forbidden from contacting the victim or any other witnesses in the mater.</p>

<p>Gorshenin is due to face Manly Local Court on October 8.  </p>
