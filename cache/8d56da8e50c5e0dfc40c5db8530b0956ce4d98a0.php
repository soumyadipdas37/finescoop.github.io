<p>High-rolling revellers piled out of exclusive private members' venue Mark's Club after 10pm last night - despite Boris Johnson's strict curfew</p>

<p>Partygoers were photographed leaving the Mayfair joint - where membership reportedly costs in the region of £2,000 a year - after 10.25pm last night</p>

<p>Those wishing to join the Mark’s Club need the support of two existing members who propose and second the application.</p>

<p>The two other members must also provide letters of support to the candidate. </p>

<p>These are handed in alongside application forms and a letter giving the reasons why the candidate wants to be a member of Mark's, according to its website. There’s also believed to be a one-off joining fee of £1,000.</p>

<p>On September 24, all businesses selling food or drink as well as social clubs and casinos - among others - must shut their doors at 10pm.</p>

<p>The club's safety guidance on its website currently states: 'In light of the government announcement on Tuesday, Mark’s Club now closes at 10pm, and members are required to wear masks when they are not seated at the table.' </p>

<p>Few guests wore masks as they left and some were seen hugging and kissing on the pavement outside</p>

<p>Witnesses slammed the scenes as 'another law for the rich and another for the poor' as people were seen at the club - dubbed a ‘haven of exclusivity’ - as late as 10.43pm</p>

<p>Membership of Mark’s Club (members pictured outside) is believed to cost in the region of £2,000 a year</p>

<p>The safety measures - which aim to make members 'feel as safe in your club as you do in your own home' - also include mandatory mask-wearing when leaving the club and regular antibody testing for employees.</p>

<p>There are also thermal imaging cameras in the club, as well as a germ-killing air filtration system.</p>

<p>The club has been popular with several senior Tories in the past.</p>

<p>David Cameron disclosed his membership at the club in the Commons Register of Interests after he was handed a free membership. </p>

<p>It states: ‘On October 1, 2015, I accepted honorary membership of Mark’s Club, a private members’ club of 46 Charles St, London. (Registered October 21.)’ </p>

<p>Mark's Club hosted the Vivienne Westwood Autobiography Launch on October 7, 2014 (pictured)</p>

<p>Mark's Club has been known to host swathes of celebrity clients, including Daisy Lowe (left) who was seen partying there on January 10, 2015, in London</p>

<p>Boris Johnson held a Christmas party there for supporters the year before that. </p>

<p>The club's dress code says: ‘Ladies should be elegantly dressed’ with denim, T-shirts, cowboy boots and ‘exposed undergarments’ banned.</p>

<p>Men are ‘actively encouraged’ to wear a suit and must wear a ‘jacket and collared shirt at all times’. The club was opened in 1972 by entrepreneur Mark Birley.</p>

<p>The current owner, restaurateur Richard Caring, bought Birley’s string of clubs for £100 million in 2007. </p>

<p>The club reopened after a multi- million-pound make-over by Paris-based designer Tino Zervudachi.</p>

<p>Mr Caring said the changes would ‘embrace Mark’s Club’s timeless tradition while evolving it to become a haven of exclusivity... reflective of today’s contemporary, global and sophisticated member.’ </p>

<p>Mark's Club have been approached for comment. </p>
