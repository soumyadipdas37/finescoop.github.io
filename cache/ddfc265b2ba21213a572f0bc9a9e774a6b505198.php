<p>David Copley, coroner's officer, told the court: 'At 15.04 on Sunday, September 13, a call was made to South Yorkshire Ambulance by Abigail Ellis.</p>

<p>'She stated that her son, Elon, was breathing, but was really poorly.</p>

<p>'He was bleeding from his leg or his tummy, she thought that one of the dogs had bitten Elon.</p>

<p>'She had been on the toilet and her partner Stephen was outside with another child and came running in.</p>

<p>'Officers attended and Stephen Joynes identified Elon to police officers.'</p>

<p>Elon, who was born on September 1, was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later.</p>

<p>No family members were present during the brief hearing and senior coroner Nicola Mundy released Elon's body so that a funeral can take place.</p>

<p>She said: 'I want to release Elon for the purposes of a funeral to proceed.</p>

<p>'I am aware that there is an ongoing investigation and I adjourn this inquest until matters are investigated.'</p>

<p>Emergency services were called to the home shortly after 3pm on Sunday, September 13</p>

<p>Prior to the inquest, police said the baby had suffered serious injuries after being attacked by a dog and died a short time later in hospital.</p>

<p>A police spokesman said that the dog was removed from the address and will remain in secure kennels until the force's inquiries have been completed.</p>

<p>Floral tributes were left at the family's mid-terrace house as well-wishers and neighbours offered their support for the family.</p>

<p>Elon was the third generation of Mrs Ellis's family to die in the house in recent years, after she lost her father and previous partner.</p>

<p>Mrs Ellis and Mr Joynes were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence after the incident.</p>

<p>Both have been bailed pending further inquiries. </p>
