<p>She revealed her shock at receiving the life-changing news after playing the same numbers for the past 20 years.  </p>

<p>'I marked the numbers with my birthday and things like that. I chose them so long ago now I don't know why I chose them,' she said.</p>

<p>'I play every week, and lately, I haven't had much luck. I'm always joking with the guy in the store that I never win anything.</p>

<p>'I guess I never won any smaller prizes because a big one was on its way! '</p>

<p>When asked how it felt to become an overnight multi-millionaire, the thrilled winner revealed it was just one of several life-changing moments she'd experienced.</p>

<p>'A few years ago a family member had a serious accident so I am very much aware of how your life can change in the blink of an eye,' she declared.</p>

<p>'This is another one of those life-changing moments but definitely a more exciting one. You really don't know what each day will bring.'  </p>
