<p>Barrie's post racked up over 3,000 views and over 200 likes, with several users congratulating the pair and hailing them the 'perfect couple'.  </p>

<p>Barrie and his former partner Tony, 55, hit headlines in 1999 when they became the first same sex couple to be formally registered as parents. Their surrogate gave birth to twins Aspen and Saffron.</p>

<p>The fathers, who are worth £40million and live in a £6million 10-bedroom mansion in Florida, went on to have three more children.</p>

<p>Barrie has said Scott, his PA of seven years, became a 'shoulder to cry on' when  former partner Tony, who is now in remission, was in hospital during cancer treatment in 2018</p>

<p>The couple previously announced they were expecting triplets, but in April shared a scan photo revealing just the one baby girl is on the way</p>

<p>The pair, who made their millions through ventures including a surrogacy agency and medical research firm, became civil partners in 2006 and married in 2014.</p>

<p>But Barrie previously told how they 'slid into a platonic relationship' after Tony was diagnosed with cancer in 2006.</p>

<p>He said Scott, his PA of seven years, became a 'shoulder to cry on' when Tony, who is now in remission, was in hospital during treatment in 2018. </p>

<p>Last year Barrie announced that Tony remained his 'true love' but they had ended their 32-year relationship. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Saffron has said she is 'not bothered' by her father and ex's relationship, provided they are happy together. </p>

<p>Earlier this year Barrie revealed he is expecting a baby girl with his daughter's ex-boyfriend via surrogate, with Barrie's ex Tony agreeing to be the baby's godfather. </p>

<p>Their surrogate, Marie, is from San Francisco and has previously worked with the couple for their agency, the British Surrogacy Centre. </p>

<p>The couple transferred three blastocysts (embryos) - two girls fertilised by Scott and one girl fertilised by Barrie. </p>

<p>All three men and the Drewitt-Barlow's children still live together in their Florida mansion, which has separate wings.</p>
