<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sole traders and small businesses could have found a loophole to JobKeeper 2.0, allowing them to claim $1,200 per fortnight while only working part-time.</p>

<p>From September 28, the coronavirus supplement will drop from $1,500 a fortnight to a more targeted payment based on hours worked. </p>

<p>Employees working 20 hours a week or more will be entitled to the full $1,200 payment, while people working less will receive $750.</p>

<p>Sole traders will need to demonstrate that they have 'been actively engaged in the business' more than 20 hours each week.</p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg (pictured) helped to create the JobKeeper payment.  Sole traders and small businesses could have found a loophole to JobKeeper 2.0, allowing them to claim $1,200 per fortnight while only working part-time</p>

<p>But Michael Croker, the tax lead at Chartered Accountants, told ABC it could very easily become 'a very loose test'.</p>

<p>'Now, you could be washing the dishes at night and thinking about your business at the same time,' he revealed.</p>

<p>While the loophole leaves room for exploitation, the CEO of the Council of Small Business, Peter Strong, said business owners often work constantly.  </p>

<p>'Lots of small business people go on holidays and still work more than 20 hours per week, just by the nature of what they're in,' he said.</p>

<p>Newcastle based hair salon owner Sandy Chong agreed that she feels she is constantly working.  </p>

<p>'If you own a business, you work 24/7,' she said. 'There is no small business owner who leaves their business at the door when they close the door.' </p>

<p>'And so I can understand that you would be washing up and you would be thinking about what it is that you need to do, how can I be resourceful at this time, and what is it that I need to do to make my business survive.'</p>

<p>She insisted that thinking about business while washing up should 'definitely' be considered working under the new guidelines.  </p>

<p>All businesses and not-for-profits seeking the JobKeeper payment will be required to demonstrate their business has been substantially impacted by the pandemic.</p>

<p>Eligibility will be re-assessed based on turnover in the September quarter of 2020.</p>

<p>JobKeeper has kept businesses open throughout the pandemic by paying staff wages. Pictured: People eat breakfast at Albert and Moore Cafe in Freshwater</p>

<p>When the payment reduces again in January, a new assessment will be performed, and will need to prove they still meet the requirements for the December quarter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, employees will be entitled for the full time or part time supplement based on their hours worked.</p>

<p>The reference periods for consideration will be the two fortnightly pay periods prior to March 1, or July 1.</p>

<p>The period with the highest number of hours worked will be considered.</p>

<p>That means if an employee was working above 20 hours prior to the pandemic, they will be entitled to the higher payment.</p>

<p>Similarly, if an employee has been working increased hours up until July, they will also be entitled to the higher payment rate.   </p>
