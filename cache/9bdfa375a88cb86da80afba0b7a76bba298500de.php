<p>West Ham are close to signing of Slavia Prague's Vladimir Coufal ahead a medical on Thursday</p>

<p>Right-back Coufal is in London and likely to cost around £4million and his expected transfer was confirmed by Slavia Prague’s president Jaroslav Tvrdik on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Bruges rejected an offer of £15m plus add ons for 28-year old Vanaken, a prolific goal scoring midfielder, who Moyes had identified as an ideal support for his attack.</p>

<p>Fiorentina rebuffed West Ham’s £22m bid for Milenkovic but were willing to negotiate. However, it is understood the demands of the player and his representatives were considered too high for West Ham to proceed.</p>
