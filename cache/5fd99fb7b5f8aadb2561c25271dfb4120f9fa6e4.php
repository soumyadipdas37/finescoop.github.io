<p>Bus to London has been founded by Guinness World Record Holders Sanjay Madan and Tushar Agarwal, who have already gained experience with their globe-trotting Adventures Overland tours.</p>

<p>The tour has been dreamed up for passengers who want to take a big road trip without the driving, so with that in mind, the organisers have made comfort a number one priority </p>

<p>The coach is fitted with luxurious Business Class seats, with two seats per row to maximise space for each passenger</p>

<p>The seats are fitted with TVs, tray tables and there are also numerous charging ports and on-board WiFi for those who rely on their tech</p>

<p>Founded in 2012, Adventures Overland tourists are personally led by Mr Madan and Mr Agarwal across continents full of exotic landscapes and harsh terrain.</p>

<p>They have taken passengers from as young as five to over 70-years-old, on their self-driving tours. </p>

<p>They have already made the colossal drive from Delhi to London in convoys of up to 15 SUVs for the last three years, leading around 30 participants.  </p>

<p>Mr Agarwal said the idea for the bus journey was originally inspired by a road trip he made to London in 2010. </p>

<p>'It is an absolutely fantastic journey,' he told CNN. 'There are a lot of people, travellers, who want to experience these overland journeys, but they don't want to drive.</p>

<p>'So, we came up with the idea of putting together a bus in which people can sit comfortably and go on long distance journeys. And that's how the idea of the Bus to London was born.' </p>

<p>'The best time to do this journey is between April and June, because that's when the weather is favorable to start the journey from India through to Myanmar, and to cross the high mountains of China and Kyrgyzstan,' Mr Agarwal said. </p>

<p>For a passenger starting in London, the first leg costs £4,350, for 15 nights to Moscow; the second is £5,000 from Moscow to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; the third is £4,350 from Kashgar, China, to Chengdu, China; and the fourth is £3,500 from Bangkok, Thailand to Impal, India. </p>
