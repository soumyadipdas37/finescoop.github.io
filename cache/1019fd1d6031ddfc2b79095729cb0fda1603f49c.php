<p>Happy: Jodie Turner-Smith has revealed her husband Joshua Jackson has become a 'new man' since they welcomed their baby daughter in April</p>

<p>Gushing about her husband she said: 'I'm really in love with my husband. That might be weird for people, but I'm doing a pretty good job of not shouting that from the rooftops as much as I would like to. He's a really amazing dude. </p>

<p>'Today's actually our two-year anniversary. It's only gotten better and I feel so grateful for that. That's why I share it sometimes, because I love him, I think he's hot, I think he's smart and he's incredibly talented. </p>

<p>'I feel so lucky to be in a relationship with somebody who feels the same about me, who is not shy about telling me that or uplifting me.'</p>

<p>Thrilled: The actress gushed she's 'really in love' with her husband as she marked their two-year anniversary, and she feels 'really lucky' to be in a relationship with him</p>

<p>Discussing how her spouse has changed since they became parents for the first time, she added: 'He's become a new man, a husband and father.'</p>

<p>The Queen and Slim star added that she hopes to create a stable and loving environment for her daughter after her own parents divorced when she was a child.</p>

<p>She said: 'You just want to create a better life – not that I had a bad life by any means – but the heartbreaks I had in my own life, ideally I want to save my daughter from having them.'</p>

<p>'It's a hopeful thing to decide to have a child. It's a hopeful thing to decide to love in this moment. </p>

<p>'As much as I am exhausted, as much as I am heartbroken about things that are happening and continue to happen, at my essence I am hopeful, otherwise I wouldn't be here celebrating my two-year anniversary with my husband, who I love dearly, and our daughter, who we brought into the world just a little while ago.'</p>

<p>Happy couple: Jodie and husband Joshua welcomed their first child together in April, after marrying last year (pictured in February 2020)</p>

<p>During the interview Jodie also praised the work of actresses including Michaela Coel and Viola Davis for offering stories that focus on black women.</p>

<p>She added: 'This is one of those conversations that people get really upset about, but the truth of the matter is, regardless of whether your family is telling you you're beautiful, everything in the media for a very long time has pointed towards [the idea] that darker women are less desirable.'</p>

<p>Since the birth of her baby girl Jodie has also revealed she's taken to using breast milk in her beauty treatments.</p>

<p>She told US Vogue: 'Ever since I had my baby, my current beauty secret is that I put breast milk in all of my face serums.</p>

<p>'My skin is very sensitive, so I use a light cleanser, and then I put on a serum with aloe and breast milk that I literally squeeze right into my hands from my boob.'</p>

<p>She added that she thinks it might be the 'lactic acid' which is so effective - and that the results have been 'revolutionary.'    </p>
