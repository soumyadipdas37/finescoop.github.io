<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Italy manager Roberto Mancini has revealed that he mistakenly didn't start Giorgio Chiellini against Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina as he didn't have his glasses on.</p>

<p>The Italian media widely expected experienced Juventus defender Chiellini to start in the Nations League game in Florence.</p>

<p>However, to much surprise, Lazio's Francesco Acerbi started instead as he won his seventh international cap. </p>

<p>Roberto Mancini has revealed that he accidentally left Giorigio Chiellini on the bench v Bosnia</p>

<p>Francesco Acerbi (left) started instead of Chiellini (centre) after Mancini mis-read the team-sheet</p>

<p>Mancini revealed that, rather remarkably, he didn't realise that Acerbi had been listed instead of Chiellini when he was shown the teamsheet prior to the game.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old admitted that Chiellini will now start Monday's game away to the Netherlands instead. </p>

<p>As reported by Football Italia, Mancini said: 'It was my fault.</p>

<p>'They showed me the line-up, I didn't have my glasses on and just said it was fine. I didn't notice Acerbi was there rather than Chiellini.</p>

<p>Lazio defender Acerbi mistakenly started and Chiellini will now play v Holland on Monday</p>

<p>'Anyway, we had planned originally for Acerbi to play one game and Chiellini another. I had asked Giorgio if he wanted to play today or on Monday with Holland, he said today, but we'll have to swap it now.</p>

<p>'It's not like we chose a goalkeeper rather than a defender, it's not a massive difference, but yes, it was an error.'</p>

<p>Bosnia took the lead in the 57th minute courtesy of Edin Dzeko.</p>

<p>However, Italy managed to get a point from proceedings, with Stefano Sensi scoring in the 67th minute. </p>

<p>The result saw Italy's run of eleven successive victories come to an end.  </p>
