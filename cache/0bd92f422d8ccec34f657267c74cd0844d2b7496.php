<p>Serafim and Milen stalked Macris for 19 days before carrying out the hit outside the couple's up-market home in the seaside suburb of Voula, the court was told.  </p>

<p>Macris was killed while sitting in his car, which was caught on CCTV. </p>

<p>The brothers were in Greece at the time of the shooting and had rented a Nissan Pulsar and used their own passports to check into a hotel.</p>

<p>The car was seen on CCTV footage passing Macris’ house six times on the days leading up to the shooting. </p>

<p>They were also seen in the same cafe where Macris had been dining. </p>

<p>Clothes similar to those in the CCTV footage were later found in Serafim's hotel room.  </p>

<p>Ms Karida previously revealed the pair's two children Achilles and Alexandra had learnt about how their father was killed by watching it on YouTube</p>

<p>Serafim had fled Greece the day after the murder but had returned in April 2019 where he was arrested by police who suspected he was planning another kill.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old's murder was linked to a Canadian branch of the notorious Outlaws motorcycle gang, which Serafim has the logo of tattooed on his left arm.  </p>

<p>Macris left Sydney in 2013 and started afresh in Athens where he ran a security company. </p>

<p>The brothers' mother said her sons were 'very good gentlemen' and claimed they were wrongly convicted. </p>

<p>'I'm very sorry about the lady, I'm sorry for her loss, but my kids is not that kind of persons,' she said in English outside court on Monday. </p>

<p>'My kids is very good gentlemen. I don't believe that they do that kind of thing to kill someone.</p>

<p>'And they have all families and kids. They never can do that kind of things, they have respect for the people.'</p>

<p>At a hearing in July, Ms Karida, who has two kids with Macris, broke down in tears and had to leave the room as the two Bulgarian brothers were led in.</p>

<p>'I am devastated but I remain strong,' Ms Karida told reporters at the time. </p>

<p>She previously revealed the pair's two children Achilles and Alexandra had learnt about how their father was killed by watching it on YouTube. </p>
