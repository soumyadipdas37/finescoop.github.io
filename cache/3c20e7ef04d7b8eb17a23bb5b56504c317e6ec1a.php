<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kind strangers have raised more than $180,000 for a young woman and her unborn triplets after her husband ended his life when they both lost their jobs due to COVID-19. </p>

<p>Matt and Ashleigh Conwell wanted desperately to have a family and were 'overjoyed' when they learnt they would soon be a family-of-five.</p>

<p>The parents-to-be, from Brisbane, had been tightly budgeting to care for their three unborn babies, but financial pressures began to mount when they lost their jobs.</p>

<p>Mrs Conwell, 29, who worked at the Flight Centre head office, lost her job as state borders were shut and flights were grounded around the nation.</p>

<p>Her 32-year-old husband, who worked as a cricket coach, was also one of the millions of Australians who suddenly found themselves unemployed during lockdowns. </p>

<p>All Matt and Ashleigh Conwell (pictured at their 2017 wedding) ever wanted was to have a family</p>

<p>Matt Conwell (pictured)and his wife both lost their jobs due to coronavirus, as they found out they were going to be parents to triplets</p>

<p>Knowing he would soon have three new mouths to feed with no income and no indication of when the pandemic would end, the father-to-be made a tragic decision.</p>

<p>On September 2, Mr Conwell was hit and killed by a 4WD in Carindale, south-east Brisbane.</p>

<p>Queensland Police confirmed it was suicide and Senior Sergeant Tom Nelson said the situation was 'very sad', the Courier-Mail reported.</p>

<p>To help with the enormous costs associated with being a single mum-of-three, devastated Mrs Conwell agreed to let her friend Alex Nesevski set up a Go Fund Me page.</p>

<p>'Ashleigh isn't the sort of person who would ask for help, and money can never replace the loss of her husband, but she knows she needs support,' Mrs Nesevski told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>She explained the costs of pregnancy, delivery and caring for triplets that would be 'challenging for any couple' are especially difficult for a jobless single mother. </p>

<p>'They were already stretching every dollar and budgeting tightly for the arrival of their unexpected but so very wanted family ... the financial hardship she now finds herself in is significant,' she said.  </p>

<p>'She has to see a specialist every two weeks because carrying three babies is a huge physical strain - growing bones and brains.'</p>

<p>Queensland Police confirmed it was a self-harm incident, with Senior Sergeant Tom Nelson saying it had been 'very sad'</p>

<p>The page has been overwhelmed with friends and family offering support for the young family, as the amount of money raised continues to surge.</p>

<p>'I passed the scene of the accident last Wednesday and I can assure you that the emergency services were doing all they could to help Matt,' one woman wrote on the fundraising page.</p>

<p>'I wish you the very best for the arrival of your beloved babies and for the beautiful life that you will create together with them and your families.'</p>

<p>Another shared: 'As someone who lost their husband before giving birth to our first child, my heart is broken for you. This will be the biggest ride of your life, but I promise you, these babies will get you through the darkest days and you will see the sun again.'  </p>

<p> The couple met in 2008 when Mr Conwell saw his future wife pictured on the cover of a local newspaper after she attended a fundraising event for leukaemia</p>

<p>Mrs Conwell's sister Emily Fallon, 27, told the Courier-Mail that her 'very caring and genuine' brother-in-law wasn't thinking clearly when he took his own life.</p>

<p>'It was a snap decision, a moment of clouded judgement, and totally out of character.' </p>

<p>She explained that he struggled after losing his job, but 'it wasn't meant to be this way'.</p>

<p>'This year's been tough for everyone, even the strongest people you thought could get through it ... it just shows suicide doesn't discriminate.' </p>

<p>Parents-to-be Matt and Ashleigh Conwell, from Brisbane , had been tightly budgeting to care for their three unborn babies after they both lost their jobs due to COVID-19  </p>

<p>Ms Fallon said the families rallied around Mrs Conwell with love and support to show that she will not raise her children alone.</p>

<p>A pregnant Mrs Conwell arrived at the scene and broke down and suffered 'extreme shock' following her 'beloved soulmate's' death.</p>

<p>Mrs Nesevski told Daily Mail Australia the mother-to-be has vowed to raise her children knowing who their father is.</p>

<p>'Losing Matt has placed an almost overwhelming burden on Ashleigh, and she's the strongest person I know.'</p>

<p>'She keeps saying "I'm going to be strong for our babies".'</p>

<p>Ms Conwell's sister, Emily Fallon, said her brother-in-law was 'genuine and caring' but had been struggling after losing his job</p>

<p>Mrs Conwell has also been joking that she is 'growing a mini cricket team in her belly'.</p>

<p>She vowed instil her late husband's morals into the triplets as they grow. </p>

<p>Queensland Cricket CEO Terry Svenson told the Courier-Mail the organisation was shocked to learn the tragic news.</p>

<p>He said many people worked closely with Mr Conwell since he started with the company in 2009 and that they would support his wife in any way they could.</p>

<p>A Go Fund Me page has been inundated with friends and family offering financial and emotional support to Ms Conwell (pictured with her husband)</p>

<p>The expectant mother was one of the first on the scene of the accident, where she broke down</p>

<p>Members of the Darling Downs association and Redlands Tigers cricket clubs described him as 'the loveliest bloke'.</p>

<p>Mrs Nesevski said the couple found out they were going to be parents in early June, but only found out they would have having three babies during the second visit to the doctor.  </p>

<p>'No one believed them when they said it was triplets - the family thought they were joking around. You don't think you'll end up with three in your first pregnancy.' </p>

<p>The couple met in 2008 when Mr Conwell saw his future wife pictured on the cover of a local newspaper after she attended a fundraising event for leukaemia.</p>

<p>Upon seeing her face and reading her name, the then 20-year-old contacted her on MySpace.</p>

<p>After weeks of messaging each other, 17-year-old Ashleigh agreed to meet at Cleveland Harbour in Brisbane's west.</p>

<p>Mrs Nesevski said she was hesitant to meet up with the stranger at first, but 'the date went extremely well,' she laughed.</p>

<p>Their 2017 wedding featured a copy of the news story that brought them together.</p>
