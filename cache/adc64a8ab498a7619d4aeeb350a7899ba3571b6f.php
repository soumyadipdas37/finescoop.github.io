<p>Woo! In a new preview for The Bachelor shared on Tuesday, Locky Gilbert (pictured) plays a very racy game with the girls</p>

<p>First in was Bella Varelis who applied lipstick in a mirror before approaching Locky's chest. </p>

<p>The 25-year-old marketing professional then left a lipstick kiss seductively on his chest. </p>

<p>Next in was Irena Srbinovska, 30, who also left a mark on Locky's chest, but one with a little more meaning. </p>

<p>Racy! The 30-year-old is stripped down to his underwear and blindfolded while the women leave their mark on his body</p>

<p>Smooch: First in was Bella Varelis who left a lipstick kiss seductively on his chest</p>

<p>'I decided to paint a heart, which was a symbol of when we first met on the red carpet,' she said. </p>

<p>When Bella caught wind of what Irena had done she was enraged.  </p>

<p>'Hang on a second, I also left a mark on Locky's chest. My whole body was fuming,' she said. </p>

<p>Sweet: Next in was Irena Srbinovska, 30, (pictured) who also left a mark on Locky's chest, but one with a little more meaning</p>

<p>Cute! 'I decided to paint a heart, which was a symbol of when we first met on the red carpet,' she said</p>

<p>Later in the clip, Bella is seen at the dinner party, ragingly angry, and decides to confront Locky.  </p>

<p>'I decided to say something to Locky because it seems like she's getting into his head,' she revealed. </p>

<p>Locky was having none of it, saying:  'I am actually pretty pretty upset, I have seen a side of Bella I didn't think I would see'. </p>

<p>Angry: When Bella caught wind of what Irena had done she was enraged. 'Hang on a second, I also left a mark on Locky's chest. My whole body was fuming,' she said</p>

<p>'I dont want her to get between us. I'm petrified I am going to lose him,' Bella insisted. </p>

<p>Locky is then shown insisting they go back to the party, while Bella tries to make him stay with her.</p>

<p>'I really hope it's not too late,' a distressed Bella says at the end of the clip. </p>
