<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 51-year-old woman who says she is often mistaken for someone decades younger has revealed that she is regularly confused for her own daughter's sister.   </p>

<p>Regional sales director, Rebecca Daubler, from Atlanta, Georgia, has always enjoyed taking care of herself, but like so many women, she felt intimidated by the notion that beauty is intrinsically linked to youth.</p>

<p>After going through a divorce at the age of 40, Rebecca decided to take the time to focus on 'personal growth,' and has since been inspiring women to embrace their beauty and sex appeal, regardless of their age.</p>

<p>Stunner: Mother-of-two Rebecca Daubler, 51, says she is regularly mistaken for someone decades younger because of her healthy lifestyle and strict workout regimen</p>

<p>Surprise! Rebecca (right) says people often confuse her for the sister of her two daughters, Callie (left), 21, and Mckenna (center), 23 </p>

<p>Confident: 'People are often surprised about my age. The fact that I get mistaken as my daughters' sister is my favorite,' the ageless mom (pictured with one of her daughters) said</p>

<p>Transformation: The Georgia native, who gets Botox every three months to maintain her looks, says she looks and feels better than she ever did in her twenties (left)</p>

<p>Feeling much more confident in her body now than she did in her twenties, Rebecca is no longer self-critical and chooses to focus on the positives. </p>

<p>She maintains a healthy diet and exercises five times a week – with weightlifting being a key tip in creating a killer 'rear view.' Rebecca has built up an impressive strength and can even hip-thrust 385lb.</p>

<p>Rebecca also indulges in quarterly Botox sessions and underwent a breast lift procedure in 2018 - although she insists that it's the fitness and diet changes that have provided her with a new sense of invigoration.</p>

<p>And all of her hard work has certainly paid off.  </p>

<p>The glamorous mother says she is often mistaken for being at least a decade younger than she is - and has even been confused for the sister of her two daughters, Callie, 21, and Mckenna, 23.</p>

<p>After ridding herself of the confining concept of youth, Rebecca has flourished in her fifties, and has even found love again.  </p>

<p>Looking ahead: Rebecca (pictured in her twenties) was inspired to focus more on her health and wellness after going through a divorce at age 40 </p>

<p>New normal: She says she used to think that you could only be beautiful when you are young but her new lifestyle has changed that opinion</p>

<p>Popular: Rebecca regularly receives messages from younger men online who say they want to date her - and tell her she is a 'goddess' </p>

<p>Since embracing her age, Rebecca has noticed she receives more advances from younger men with online fans deeming Rebecca a 'true goddess,' and 'hotter than the sun.' </p>

<p>She's now happily settled with her new partner, Len, 54, and continues to speak out on social media encouraging other women to embrace their age.</p>

<p>'After going through my divorce, I decided to take some time to focus on personal growth,' Rebecca said.</p>

<p>'Beauty has always been important to me but there is such a huge focus on youth now. I wanted to help both myself and other women feel beautiful as we age.</p>

<p>'I feel more beautiful now than I did when I was younger. Being sexy doesn't stop as you get older. I stand tall and wear my life experience with pride.</p>

<p>'Exercise and diet have been a game changer. I work-out five times a week and choose healthy, whole foods. I also indulge in great skincare and regular facials. </p>

<p>Message: The mom shows off her body on Instagram in order to try and inspire other women to embrace their age </p>

<p>Speaking out: 'Beauty has always been important to me but there is such a huge focus on youth now. I wanted to help both myself and other women feel beautiful as we age,' she said</p>

<p>Journey: Rebecca also uses photos of herself to track her progress, saying that they help her to 'see how far she has come' </p>

<p>'Lifting weights has been particularly amazing. Developing more muscles has made me both stronger and happier – and it's built a rear view that I'm proud of.</p>

<p>'I've loved the process. Taking pictures can show you how far you've come. I've learnt to embrace every imperfection and my body for all the things it does daily – like walking, and laughing, and loving.</p>

<p>'People are often surprised about my age. The fact that I get mistaken as my daughters' sister is my favorite.</p>

<p>'I'm very open about my age but most people guess I'm a decade younger than I am.</p>

<p>'I do tend to attract younger men now. Most of them say that they appreciate beauty but with the grace of an older woman.</p>

<p>'I get a lot of compliments about my legs, but also my laugh too. I tend to laugh out loud – head back, enjoying the moment – I think that kind of freedom exudes sex appeal.</p>

<p>'In the gym, men sometimes come to chat to me too. They're always very polite although I do get the giggles when they open by asking me about my outfit.</p>

<p>'I've been fortunate with dating. I'm very much a people person so making connections is easy for me. </p>

<p>Fan club: When she is in the gym, Rebecca says younger men will often approach her hoping to ask her out on a date </p>

<p>Criticism: Although the majority of women are supportive of Rebecca, she says she does face some rude comments from a few ladies who she believes are scared by her confidence </p>

<p>'It's not always about your outward appearance though. Someone once told me that my soul was beautiful. He said that my real beauty came from within and the part of me that's visible to the world was just an enhancement.' </p>

<p>Rebecca largely receives positive responses from other women her age, yet she has noticed that there still seems to be a pressure within society for women to tear one another down.</p>

<p>'I find most women that speak to me to be very supportive. I'm sure there's some that judge me but I don't seek those people out,' Rebecca said.</p>

<p>'I do think some women feel uncomfortable around women my age that are still vital and sexy. </p>

<p>'For example, during this year's Super Bowl halftime show, there was so much uproar about Jennifer Lopez, 51, and 43-year-old Shakira's performance. Strong, confident, and sexy women can be a lot to handle if you don't feel good about yourself.</p>

<p>'Instagram is amazing for fixing this. I've met some incredible women that live life the way I do and we empower each other – which can only make us stronger, happier, and healthier.</p>

<p>'I think the key is setting small goals. Reach out to people you admire for support. Don't be afraid to hire a trainer if you need help with exercise and accountability.'</p>
