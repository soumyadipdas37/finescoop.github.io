<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor's season eight finale aired on Thursday night. </p>

<p>And despite being the most watched non-news program of the night, the season finished at an all-time low in the ratings.</p>

<p>Just 694,000 viewers tuned in for the majority of the episode, with numbers peaking at 879,000 to watch the moment Locky chose Irena Srbinovska over Bella Varelis.</p>

<p>Disappointing: Despite being the most watched non-news program of the night, the Bachelor finished at an all-time low in the ratings on Thursday</p>

<p>Last year's finale with Matt Agnew 1.170million, making Locky's season the lowest rated in franchise history.</p>

<p>In fact, Locky was even defeated by Home and Away in his hometown of Perth, with  87,000 tuning for the Aussie soap compared to the 72,000 who watched Locky.</p>

<p>Overall, The Bachelor was the fifth most watched program of the night, with Seven News and Nine News occupying the top four spots. </p>

<p>The highest rated Bachelor finale was season three's Sam Wood, who pulled in 1.482million viewers back in 2015.</p>

<p>Tragic: In fact, Locky was even defeated by Home and Away in his hometown of Perth, with 87,000 tuning for the Aussie soap compared to the 72,000 who watched Locky</p>

<p>During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Bella and Irene that he was in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.</p>

<p>He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.</p>

<p>'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.</p>

<p>'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'</p>

<p>What?! Just 694,000 viewers tuned in for the majority of the episode, with numbers peaking at 879,000 to watch the moment Locky chose Irena Srbinovska over Bella Varelis (pictured)</p>

<p>As Locky tried to explain himself, a furious Bella stormed off and snapped: 'My God... Can I leave? I'm going.'</p>

<p>She later told producers: 'Who does that to someone? Who tells them they're in love with them and then... I just want to get out of here.'</p>

<p>After this emotional break-up, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena Srbinovska, telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her.</p>

<p>'Irena, every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that,' he told the 31-year-old nurse.</p>

<p>'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole package.'</p>

<p>The end! After his emotional break-up with Bella, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena (left), telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her</p>
