<p>'We apologise for our actions for which there is no excuse and we take full responsibility for our behaviour,' Dew said in the statement.</p>

<p>'The behaviour that took place and the filming and distribution of the footage was not appropriate and we have taken responsibility for what has happened,' Suns General Manager of Football Jon Haines said.   </p>

<p>Both Dew and Haines are both donating $5,000 each to programs supported by AFL Cape York, which provides education, employment and training for young Indigenous men. </p>

<p>Dew was reportedly filmed urinating by a colleague before the video was shared to a WhatsApp group and eventually wound up online, The Courier Mail reports.</p>

<p>The morning after the video was shot the staffer reportedly realised his mistake and asked everyone in the WhatsApp group to delete it - but it was already too late.</p>
