<p>Ahead of the new lockdown rules! Work has continued on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! 2020 amid claims the show is 'under threat' due to new lockdown rules in Wales</p>

<p>These include people unable to leave or enter the Conwy County Borough area or be in a ' bubble' with extended household members (people you don't live with) without a 'reasonable excuse'. </p>

<p>Yet despite the upcoming lockdown rules and claims the show could be 'under threat', work still continued on the I'm A Celebrity site on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Large cranes were seen being operated on the 200-year-old Gwrych Castle with scaffolding also erected on the building.</p>

<p>Work people could be seen preparing the area wearing high-vis vests while another member of crew could be seen signing in vans and lorries to the site.</p>

<p>Clock's ticking: New restrictions will come into force at 6pm on 1 October 2020 and will be kept under review (show hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly pictured)  </p>

<p>It comes after hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly made a quick trip to Wales in search of the new I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! castle on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The show, which was forced to move location from Australia to the UK due to the coronavirus pandemic, is said to be 'under threat' as the country is hit with new lockdown rules.</p>

<p>Brushing aside the drama, the series' hosts Ant, 44, and Dec, 45, appeared in great spirits as they posed in front of a sign directing them to Gwrych Castle for a snap shared to their joint Instagram account.</p>

<p>On site: Yet despite the upcoming lockdown rules and claims the show could be 'under threat', work still continued on the I'm A Celebrity site on Wednesday</p>

<p>Building preparation: Large cranes were seen being operated on the 200-year-old Gwrych Castle with scaffolding also erected on the building</p>

<p>Cautious: Work people could be seen preparing the area wearing high-vis vests while another member of crew could be seen signing in vans and lorries to the site </p>

<p>The presenters appeared to bring the jungle vibe to the chilly town of Conwy as they sported brown and camouflage print outfits as they prepared to film for the upcoming edition.</p>

<p>They captioned the image: 'Quick trip to Wales in search of the #imaceleb castle. If only there was a sign... <?php echo e('@'); ?>itv.'</p>

<p>Producers are set to entertain viewers by making the contestants face ghost trials to adhere to the 'haunted' theme of the castle.</p>

<p>For staff? Elsewhere, trailers and pods could be seen nearby to the Gwrych Castle, no doubt being used by staff for breaks and planning</p>

<p>Filming: The 20th series of the hit show is due to start filming later this autumn, but new lockdown rules which come into force on Thursday night could cause problems if they remain in place by the time shooting begins </p>

<p>Start date: ITV have yet to confirm a start date for the new series but the show traditionally begins airing in November, giving the chance for local lockdown measures to ease in the coming weeks </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'I'm A Celebrity is all about stars facing their fears - and this year will be as terrifying as ever, a real test of their bravery.</p>

<p>'Some trials will nod to the castle's spooky history - expect chilling trials with creepy tasks - they'll send a real shiver down celeb's spines.' An ITV representative declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.  </p>

<p>The 20th series of the hit show is due to start filming later this autumn, but new lockdown rules which come into force on Thursday night could cause problems if they remain in place by the time shooting begins. </p>

<p>Great success: The broadcaster has also had great success with filming their soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale under strict guidelines and under COVID-secure measures, so are well-versed in the restrictions </p>

<p>The new guidance for Conwy has been posted online by the Welsh government and states 'people will no longer be able to form, or be in, an extended household (sometimes called a bubble)'.</p>

<p>'This means meeting indoors with anyone who is not part of your household (people you live with) is not allowed at the moment, unless you have a good reason, such as providing care to a vulnerable person,' the new rules explain.</p>

<p>Another rule states that 'people will not be allowed to enter or leave the Conwy County Borough area without a reasonable excuse'. </p>

<p>The restrictions come into force at 6pm on 1 October 2020 and will be kept under review. </p>

<p>Exciting times ahead: It comes after hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly made a quick trip to Wales in search of the new I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! castle on Wednesday (pictured in 2019) </p>

<p>Bosses have reportedly forked out millions to make the 19th-century castle where this year's series is being held in North Wales safe.</p>

<p>It has apparently been a costly affair to transform the castle into a TV set, as workers installed electrics and pipes to provide the location with running water. </p>

<p>According to reports, the star-studded line-up of campmates will be housed under a waterproof roof in a show first to protect them from the bitter UK climate.  </p>

<p>Chilly! The change of location means a change of weather for contestants who will have to battle 8.5C (47.3F) temperatures and winds, a stark contrast to the blistering heat in the Australian jungle 22C (71.6F) (the Australian camp pictured in 2017)  </p>

<p>In pictures obtained by The Sun, a studio where hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly has been erected, as well as an uncovered area where contestants will be allowed to light a camp fire.</p>

<p>A section of the location where they will sleep has been covered with strong plastic to keep the winds and rain at bay. </p>

<p>Last month Kevin Lygo, the Director of Television at ITV, has revealed that all stars for this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! have been confirmed. </p>

<p>And while rumours circulate that Selling Sunset's Christine Quinn, presenter Vernon Kay, and Coronation Street's Beverley Callard have signed up, Lygo assures all of the as-yet-unnamed stars have been confirmed – despite the change of location.</p>

<p>Reports: Rumours swirl that Selling Sunset's Christine Quinn (left) and presenter Vernon Kay (right) could be set to enter the cast this autumn </p>

<p>Restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic forced ITV to switch locations to the Gwrych Castle, and has resulted in major changes to production, affecting everything from what food challenges stars will do to where they will sleep.</p>

<p>While creepy crawlies such as witchetty grubs have been a mainstay on the Australian menu, dining in north Wales will have more of a local flavour, as it's been reported their eating challenges will include sheep's testicles. </p>

<p>The change of location means a change of weather for contestants who will have to battle 8.5C (47.3F) temperatures and winds, a stark contrast to the blistering heat in the Australian jungle 22C (71.6F).</p>

<p>Contingency plans will be put in place to combat drastic weather changes, including make shift huts when they need protection from the elements.</p>

<p>Gwrych Castle was built by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh in the early 1800s</p>

<p>It boasts 250 acres of historic gardens and parkland, and was built as a memorial to his mother's ancestors, the Lloyds of Gwrych</p>

<p>The castle is thought to be haunted by a number of spirits, including previous owner Winifred Hesketh, the Countess of Dundonald who died in 1924</p>

<p>The Countess left the castle in her will to King George V and who then passed it onto the Prince of Wales (who became King Edward VIII) </p>

<p>Ghosts? The castle is said to be haunted by the Countess of Dundonald</p>

<p>The castle was passed to the Venerable Order of Saint John, and in 1928, Douglas Cochrane, 12th Earl of Dundonald purchased the castle for £78,000</p>

<p>During World War Two around 300 Jewish refugees lived at the castle, and was requisitioned as part of Operation Kindertransport</p>

<p>Following the war the castle became a visitor's attraction, but it has fallen into disrepair in recent years after a plan to turn it into a hotel never materialised.</p>
