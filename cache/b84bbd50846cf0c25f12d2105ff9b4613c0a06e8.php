<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you're a Spotify premium customer, you may be disappointed to learn you have missed out on a freebie - the music streaming giant was allowing households to claim a Google Nest Mini for nothing.</p>

<p>It is likely to have given away thousands to those who pay monthly for the service, with error messages now appearing after the offer popped up on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The streaming service will be sending the devices - usually worth £29 - to premium customers who applied when the offer was launched.</p>

<p>Freebie: Spotify was offering Google Nest Minis for its premium customers whilst stocks lasted - that appears to have been a day and a half</p>

<p>Google Nest Minis are a direct rival to Amazon's Alexa system – a smart speaker fitted with voice command and Google Assistant. </p>

<p>However, the offer was pulled due to high demand with hundreds of disappointed customers saying they were unable to get hold of one.  </p>

<p>This is Money explains what the offer was, who it was available to and whether any similar offers will be available in the future.  </p>

<p>Premium Spotify customers pay monthly for the service to ensure they don't have to listen to any adverts, unlike those who use the service for free.</p>

<p>For an individual account, it will cost £9.99 but students can get this reduced to £4.99 a month.</p>

<p>Spotify also recently released their premium duo offering where two accounts of people living in the same house can both use one subscription and pay a reduced fee of £12.99.</p>

<p>There is also Spotify family which allows 6 premium for family members living under one roof to be used under one subscription at £14.99 a month.</p>

<p>If you are a premium customer of Spotify, you would have been able to claim the device by logging into your Spotify account through an internet browser.</p>

<p>The deal will have appeared and customers simply click through the links to claim theirs. </p>

<p>It was available for both new and existing customers, however, Spotify have said that there was limited eligibility for those with Premium Family, Duo and Student.</p>

<p>It has told This is Money it will let us know if it plans to do a similar offer in the future and hasn't revealed how many were given away. </p>

<p>One expert believes it could be a move to encourage people to take out a subscription.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Uswitch said: 'Offering free tech has long been a staple of subscriptions services in other sectors to entice consumers to sign up. </p>

<p>'Given the expected consumer belt-tightening in the coming months, due to the Covid induced recession, this could be a shrewd move from Spotify to up its game and could give customers another reason to subscribe or stay subscribed. </p>

<p>'We'd expect the music streaming giant to ensure that existing premium customers are signposted to this deal, or they may risk alienating their existing subscribers.' </p>

<p>Spotify Premium customers pay monthly to avoid having to listen to adverts between songs </p>

<p>The offer seems to have come to an end with Spotify likely running out of stock due to high demand. </p>

<p>Frustrated users have taken to social media to say they are being told they are not able to redeem a Mini whilst others have claimed they are told they are not eligible despite being premium customers. </p>

<p>Spotify has not said whether the deal will be returning or advised of any future deals.  </p>

<p>One user said he specifically signed up to Spotify Premium to take advantage of the deal</p>

<p>Another user said she kept getting the same message, despite being a Premium customer</p>

<p>This is the sign that many users claimed to have received when applying for a Nest Mini</p>

<p>Another user claimed that she was told she wouldn't be able to redeem the Google Nest Mini </p>

<p>A Google Nest Mini is a small speaker that can be used for listening to music around the home or utilising the Google Assistant installed.</p>

<p>It can be controlled through your phone or Bluetooth with users able to ask the device to play a certain song, ask what the weather is doing today or read out a recipe.</p>

<p>Usually retailing for around £29, users can also set reminders and timers, check their Google calendar and make hands-free calls.</p>

<p>All that is needed is to say 'OK Google' or 'Hey Google' out loud and issue a command.</p>

<p>This does mean, however, that holders will have to have a Google account to use the device.</p>

<p>One feature that could appeal to many is the smart home tech element. </p>

<p>For example, if you have compatible smart home gadgets, like a Philips Hue Lightbulb or a Nest Thermostat, you will be able to control those using the Home Mini.</p>

<p>You can also, of course, link it to your Spotify account and simply say: 'OK Google, play Yesterday, by The Beatles,' for example.  </p>
