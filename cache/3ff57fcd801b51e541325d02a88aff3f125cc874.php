<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wolves right back Matt Doherty has completed an anticipated ¬£15million move to Tottenham.</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed on Friday that Spurs had agreed a fee with the Midlands side for the 28-year-old's services following a breakthrough in talks.</p>

<p>Now both clubs have now confirmed the full-back has signed a contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium until 2024 and will wear the No 2 shirt.</p>

<p>Tottenham have completed the ¬£15million capture of Wolves right-back Matt Doherty</p>

<p>¬†The 28-year-old leaves Wolves to sign a contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium until 2024</p>

<p>"You can probably see it in my face, I'm so excited to get going. One of the best days in my career so far." üì∫ <?php echo e('@'); ?>mattdoherty20's first interview as a Spurs player... #WelcomeDoherty ‚ö™Ô∏è #COYS pic.twitter.com/dy1YWtx6Gv</p>

<p>On the move, Doherty said: 'I am very proud to be joining such a big club. It has the best stadium and possibly the best training ground in the world from what I have seen.</p>

<p>'When you start something new you want to start well and get off to a fast start. I can't wait to get going.</p>

<p>'I wanted to travel down to play in the game [against Birmingham] and that's how excited I feel coming here.'</p>

<p>The 28-year-old is Spurs' third signing of the summer after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg joined from Southampton and Joe Hart arrived on a free transfer after leaving Burnley.</p>

<p>Doherty is Tottenham's third signing of the summer and will wear the No 2 shirt at the club</p>

<p>His arrival will allow Serge Aurier to move on but Tottenham are still to receive a suitable bid for the ¬£22m-rated full-back.</p>

<p>But the news of the signing of Doherty may still cause some Tottenham fans to raise a few eyebrows at his tweet from September 2013, which read: 'Yes I'm a HUGE Arsenal fan!'</p>

<p>Should Doherty prove himself on the pitch, however, Spurs supporters are likely to forgive any old allegiance towards their great rivals - especially given talisman Harry Kane was famously pictured wearing the Gunners' kit as a boy.</p>

<p>Doherty made 50 appearances for Wolves last season, scoring on seven occasions as Nuno Espirito Santo's men finished seventh in the Premier League and reached the Europa League quarter-finals.</p>

<p>One of Doherty's tweets from seven years ago was uncovered and might raise some eyebrows</p>

<p>The defender started his senior career with Wolves and played in League One with them in 2013-14 before helping the club earn promotion back to the top flight.¬†</p>

<p>Having established himself as one of the best full-backs in the Premier League, Doherty has now linked up with Jose Mourinho's men as he was so eager to do.</p>

<p>The signing addresses a noticeable gap in the squad, with Aurier guilty of some glaring errors with many fans blaming him for giving away needless fouls and penalties in the last campaign.</p>

<p>The club have also sold Kyle Walker-Peters to Southampton this summer, so they were in need of greater strength in depth in the position. Last year Kieran Tripper left for Atletico Madrid with no direct replacement.¬†</p>

<p>Doherty's arrival pushes Serge Aurier closer to an exit but Spurs are yet to receive any bids</p>
