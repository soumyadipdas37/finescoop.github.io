<p>Safety first: Crucially, all of the maternity bodysuits advertised 'non-compressive cores,' so as not to apply pressure on the stomach</p>

<p>In her Insta Stories, Kim showed off the new clothing and revealed that the new Skims still had 'butt-shaping' designs, but that a thinner fabric was used over the midriff 'so it’s not compressing on your stomach which is really important because you obviously don’t want to do that.'</p>

<p>'But you want to shape everything else around it,' she said.</p>

<p>'If only there were cute bras like this that were holding you up and snatching you and making you feel better about yourself while you can breastfeed — that would have been everything to me,' Kim continued while perusing her items. 'I never wore a maternity bra because there was nothing out there, so this was really important to me.' </p>

<p>Despite those practicalities, many social media users questioned why pregnant women needed to be sculpting their physiques at all.</p>

<p>'.... shape wear for pregnant bodies... what the f*** is this???' wrote one outraged Twitter user.</p>

<p>Another person offered a more sarcastic take: 'I'm sure that's the one thing pregnant women need above all! Being pressed to a slimmer figure.'</p>
