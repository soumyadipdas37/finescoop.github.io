<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Singing happy birthday may be good for timing how long to wash your hands, but a new study reveals it could also be spreading coronavirus infected droplets.</p>

<p>Aerosol researchers at Lund University, Sweden studied the amount of particles emitted when we sing, and the impact this has on the spread of Covid-19. </p>

<p>To understand how many virus particles are emitted when we sing, researchers had 12 healthy singers and two people with Covid-19 sing into a funnel. </p>

<p>The study shows that singing – particularly loud and consonant-rich singing found in songs like Happy Birthday – spreads a lot droplets into the surrounding air.</p>

<p>Researchers say if singers wear a face mask and venues practice social distancing and implement good ventilation, then the risk from singing can be reduced.</p>

<p>The NHS recommended people sing 'Happy Birthday' twice while washing hands as it was the perfect amount of time to ensure as many germs as possible are removed. </p>

<p>To understand how many virus particles are emitted when we sing, researchers had 12 healthy singers and two people with Covid-19 sing into a funnel</p>

<p>The idea for the study came off the back of a number of reports about the spread of Covid-19 in connection with choirs singing together, researchers explained.</p>

<p>Researchers say songs with a lot of consonants are particularly risky to sing as they push more droplets.</p>

<p>Songs with a higher proportion of 'B' and 'P' sounds pose the greatest risk.</p>

<p>This includes 'Happy Birthday', the song recommended by the NHS to time hand washing at the start of the Coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday lyrics: </p>

<p>Happy Birthday to You  </p>

<p>Happy Birthday to You</p>

<p>Happy Birthday Dear Name</p>

<p>Happy Birthday to You </p>

<p>'Different restrictions have been introduced all over the world to make singing safer,' according to study author Jakob Löndahl, associate professor of Aerosol Technology.</p>

<p>'So far, however, there has been no scientific investigation of the amount of aerosol particles and larger droplets that we actually exhale when we sing', he said.</p>

<p>Aerosols are small airborne particles - some of these particles are larger than others and the larger ones only move a small distance from the mouth. </p>

<p>'Some droplets are so large that they only move a few decimetres from the mouth before they fall, whereas others are smaller and may continue to hover for minutes,' said co-author Malin Alsved, a doctoral student.</p>

<p>'In particular, the enunciation of consonants releases very large droplets and the letters B and P stand out as the biggest aerosol spreaders', Alsved added. </p>

<p>During the research experiments singers had to wear clean air suits and enter a specially built chamber supplied with filtered, particle-free air. </p>

<p>In the chamber, analysis was conducted of the number and mass of particles emitted by singers during breathing, talking, different types of singing and singing with a face mask.</p>

<p>What they sang was a short and plosive-rich Swedish song, 'Bibbis pippi Petter', which was repeated 12 times in two minutes at constant pitch. </p>

<p>The same song was also repeated with the consonants removed, leaving only the vowels, according to the research team. </p>

<p>During the song tests, aerosols and larger droplets were measured using lamps, a high-speed camera and an instrument that can measure very small particles. </p>

<p>The louder and more powerful the song, the greater the concentration of aerosols and droplets, the researchers discovered.</p>

<p>'We also carried out measurements of virus in the air close to two people who sang when they had Covid-19, explained Alsved.  </p>

<p>'Their air samples contained no detectable amount of virus, but the viral load can vary in different parts of the airways and between different people. </p>

<p>'Accordingly, aerosols from a person with Covid-19 may still entail a risk of infection when singing', the researcher said. </p>

<p>What they sang was a short and plosive-rich Swedish song, 'Bibbis pippi Petter', which was repeated 12 times in two minutes at constant pitch</p>

<p>The researchers say that if we have a good understanding of the risks involved when a group of people sing together, we can also sing in a safer way. </p>

<p>The song can be sung with social distancing, good hygiene and good ventilation, which reduces the concentration of aerosol particles in the air. </p>

<p>Face masks can also make a difference in reducing the spread of droplets.</p>

<p>'When the singers were wearing a simple face mask this caught most of the aerosols and droplets and the levels were comparable with ordinary speech', says Löndahl.</p>

<p>'Singing does not need to be silenced, but presently it should be done with appropriate measures to reduce the risk of spreading infection'.</p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Aerosol Science and Technology. </p>
