<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Japanese convenience stores are testing out robots to stock store shelves in hopes of combating the country's labor shortage and allowing human workers to socially distance during a pandemic.</p>

<p>FamilyMart, Japan's second largest convenience store chain, has partnered with robotics company Telexistence on an android stock boy named Model-T, after Henry Ford's famous car.</p>

<p>Rather than use AI, Model-T is connected to a human operator who manipulates the robot's movements remotely using virtual reality (VR).</p>

<p>The seven-foot tall robot has a wide range of motion, necessary for lifting and moving products, with a lag time of only 50 milliseconds between operator and automaton. </p>

<p>This week Model-T was rolled out at Lawson, another convenience store that is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi. </p>

<p>Model T, a robot designed to stock shelves, is being tested out at FamilyMart and Lawson convenience stores in Tokyo. It's operated remotely by a human using a virtual reality console</p>

<p>In FamilyMart's pilot program, an operator logs into a VR terminal from Telexistence's office in Toranomon, Tokyo, and remotely operates a  Model-T installed at a store five miles away in the Toshima Ecomusee Town building. </p>

<p>FamilyMart says it wants to create 'a completely new store operation' by making restocking work automated and remote, saving a large amount of labor-hours.</p>

<p>While Model-T doesn't move very fast, or remove the need for human employees altogether, one operator could theoretically govern the movements of multiple robots in a number stores with the same layout and inventory.</p>

<p>For now, Model-T will restock plastic beverage bottles from the back of the store, which makes up a relatively large portion of the workload.</p>

<p>FamilyMart says Model-T could help address Japan's labor shortage and allow workers to maintain social distancing during an outbreak</p>

<p>Once its speed and accuracy are verified, Model-T will start handling other popular items, like rice balls, sandwiches and bento boxes.</p>

<p>FamilyMart says it hopes to deploy the Model-T in up to 20 stores by 2022, with the goal of eventually being in every location.</p>

<p>'By introducing Model-T into stores, FamilyMart store staff will be able to work in multiple stores from a remote location, which will help solve challenges around labor shortage and help create new job opportunities,' the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>A human operator uses Model T to restocks soda bottles at the FamilyMart in the Toshima Ecomusee Town building five miles away. The chain hopes to have robots in 20 locations by 2022</p>

<p>'It will also lead to the reduction of human-to-human contact to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.' </p>

<p>Japan has faced a critical shortage of labor for years, due to its low birth rate and rapidly aging society.</p>

<p>The population is expected to decline from about 127 million to about 88 million by 2065, according to the National Institute of Population and Social Security</p>

<p>Other Asian countries have upped the ante on robots, as well. </p>

<p>In Seoul, South Korea, robots at No Brand Burger take orders, prepare food and bring meals out to customers.</p>

<p>At Foodom in Guangzhou, China, robot waiters greet customers and guide them to their seats, recommend specials and take orders.</p>

<p>Robots cook the food, as well, which is delivered via conveyor belt.</p>

<p>FamilyMart was early to adopt automation - it tested out self checkout in 2006, long before it became commonplace in the West.</p>

<p>There are more than 24,500 FamilyMart stores across Japan, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
