<p>Gary McGaghey, finance chief for a project with Pepsi, was accused of 'twisted' behaviour because of the secret relationship.</p>

<p>The affair was exposed after Andrea Pirie, another Unilever director, took the consumer goods giant to an employment tribunal claiming she had been passed over for promotion. </p>

<p>Mrs Pirie alleged the affair with the woman – known only as Mrs X – meant she received preferential treatment.</p>

<p>Unilever executive Gary McGaghey (pictured) was forced to resign after a whistleblower revealed he was having a secret affair with a female colleague, known only as Mrs X</p>

<p>Global finance director Mrs Pirie claimed the relationship caused Mr McGaghey to become 'twisted' and created a 'hostile' work environment for women. </p>

<p>An internal investigation found the pair had an undisclosed relationship and exchanged 3,000 emails – ten of which breached the rules of Anglo-Dutch firm Unilever, owner of brands Dove, Lynx and Magnum.</p>

<p>Mr McGaghey, originally from South Africa, who worked for Unilever for 15 years, was forced to resign and Mrs X was disciplined. </p>

<p>Mrs Pirie, who was based in Kingston, south-west London, has been awarded more than £170,000 after she successfully sued Unilever. </p>

<p>She worked for the company for 19 years in senior roles across the world and had an overall pay package of £321,000 a year, but has now relocated to her native Costa Rica.</p>

<p>In 2015 she told her line manager that Mr McMcGaghey was having an affair after he did not give her a promotion she believed she was in line for.</p>

<p>Unilever director Andrea Pirie (above) exposed the affair after she took the consumer goods giant to an employment tribunal, claiming she had been passed over for promotion</p>

<p>A London South Employment Tribunal report said: 'It was Mrs Pirie's evidence that she had noticed a relationship between Mr McGaghey and Mrs X by the end of 2014 and began to notice, on her account, favourable treatment of Mrs X by Mr McGaghey compared to another work colleague.' </p>

<p>Mrs Pirie said: 'Mr McGaghey's relationship with Mrs X made him so twisted, he was creating a hostile work environment, especially for women. This environment meant [the other colleague] left and now he was treating me in a similar way.'</p>

<p>The tribunal said a Unilever investigation found that there had been a breach of the firm's code because 'a close personal relationship... had not been disclosed to the business'.</p>

<p>It accepted Mrs Pirie's claim of unfair dismissal and a whistle-blowing detriment for the treatment she later received relating to redundancy.</p>

<p>Mr McGaghey was not involved in the tribunal.</p>
