<p>To make the dish, Del revealed he lightly toasted two slices of thick bread and put it aside.</p>

<p>Next, he boiled cauliflower florets, drained them and set them aside before making a roux sauce with flour and butter.</p>

<p>Del then added milk to the mix and let the sauce thicken, before adding two tablespoons of mustard powder and a pinch on nutmeg.</p>

<p>Some instagram users have used crushed cauliflowers and cheese to make the dish more like a classic toast topping</p>

<p>To get the sauce cheesy, Del then mixed mozzarella and cheddar into the sauce and stirred.</p>

<p>After letting it sit for five minutes, he poured it on the uncooked side of the toast and baked it in the oven until golden. </p>

<p>Many internet users praised Del's recipe, and said they'd be whipping up the dish soon. </p>
