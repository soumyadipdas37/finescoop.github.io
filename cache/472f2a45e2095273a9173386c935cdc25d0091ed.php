<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The pub was probably the thing that I missed most during lockdown.</p>

<p>A swift half after work with colleagues, a mid-week vino with friends, a leisurely Saturday afternoon in a sunny beer garden . . . I felt lost without it.</p>

<p>Since lockdown lifted, many have done a brilliant job of welcoming back customers with open arms (not literally).</p>

<p>Since lockdown lifted, many pubs have done a brilliant job of welcoming back customers with open arms (not literally)</p>

<p>Others, however, have become what my cooler, younger cousin might call a ‘fun-sponge’. That is, they instantly soak up any sense of relaxed enjoyment.</p>

<p>Every business has its own set of new rules — which is fine.</p>

<p>But, with no consistency, customers cannot be expected to know these in advance, nor glared at if they unwittingly make a mistake.</p>

<p>Many have been dropping into the same watering hole for years and, suddenly, everything has changed.</p>

<p>Staff need to be trained to patiently guide customers through the new processes so they feel confident returning.</p>

<p>Many, for example, require you to book a table in advance — and may only allow a two-hour slot. Some welcome walk-ins, while others — or a specific one in Hampshire — will send you packing unless you’re a ‘local’.</p>

<p>Most ask you to jot down your telephone number so the Track and Trace service can contact you in the event of an outbreak.</p>

<p>Or as one rather abrupt sign in another pub said: ‘No phone number, no beer’.</p>

<p>Many require you to download an app so you can order and pay from the table (that you’re sternly warned not to leave unless you’re going to the toilet).</p>

<p>Others will let you order from the bar providing you stay behind a red line taped on the ground. Some insist you get the app despite knowing you will probably have to order the old-fashioned way because there is barely any wi-fi signal.</p>

<p>When the drinks arrive, some staff want you to take them off the tray as they hold it, while others will put them on the table.</p>

<p>If the service is great, no one will mind the extra faff or the fact that there is little room for a spontaneous tipple out any more.</p>

<p>But some staff have taken to acting like self-appointed prison guards, barking orders at customers as though they are virus-ridden inconveniences.</p>

<p>I’m sure they think they are helping to keep everyone safe. But if people are made to feel nervous and unwelcome, they’ll soon trade expensive rounds (£13.90 for a pint of Neck Oil and an Aperol Spritz in our local!) for a far cheaper glass of wine at home.</p>

<p>And it’s not just the pubs — shopping has also had much of the fun sapped out of it.</p>

<p>Some stores are only allowing in customers who have made an appointment — even if no one else is currently in the store.</p>

<p>Others make you queue outside. Once you’re in, browsing is out as you attempt to navigate impossibly complicated one-way systems and you can’t try anything on. Given you can take items home and then bring them back, this doesn’t really make much sense.</p>

<p>Why not have customers just pop unwanted clothing in a basket on their way out of the changing rooms?</p>

<p>And then, as we reveal on Pages 44-45, some retailers are giving up much-needed business because of a ‘computer says no’ approach to accepting cash. If staff are worried, pop on some gloves.</p>

<p>Shops, pubs and restaurants desperately need our support. If we abandon them now, we’ll lose them for good.</p>

<p>But businesses also need to help themselves. Right now, this means going the extra mile to put people at ease.</p>

<p>Happy customers are far more likely to spend more — and help breathe some life back into the economy.</p>

<p>Let them eat icing</p>

<p>Interest rates are not important to savers, according to one top boss at TSB.</p>

<p>They are ‘simply a little bit of icing on the cake’, says Andrew Davis, consumer director at the bank.</p>

<p>I’d hardly call TSB’s miserly 0.02 per cent easy-access rate ‘icing’, or even sprinkles.</p>

<p>To say interest rates don’t matter is a real slap in the face to the millions of savers who rely on returns from their nest-eggs.</p>

<p>Please do write to me at the email address below to let me know your thoughts on the matter — I’ll pass them on to Mr Davis.</p>
