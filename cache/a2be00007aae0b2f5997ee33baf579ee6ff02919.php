<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Premier Steven Marshall is set to announce South Australia will drop its COVID-19 border restrictions with NSW and the ACT. </p>

<p>Speculation is growing the state's transition committee will drop the 14-day quarantine requirements on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But Mr Marshall says he will not do anything that is contrary to health advice.</p>

<p>'We want to give as much of a leg up to those people who want to travel as soon as possible,' the premier said on Monday.</p>

<p>'The numbers are looking really good. Just four new (coronavirus) cases in NSW. If they give us the advice tomorrow, we'll be very quick to open that border.</p>

<p>'I'm very keen to open that border the minute I get the advice that it's safe to do so.'</p>

<p>In other changes to coronavirus rules, the premier said he was hopeful crowds of up to 25,000, or about 50 per cent capacity, would be possible at Adelaide Oval for any AFL finals matches.</p>

<p>He said significant crowds were at games over the weekend, and SA Health officials were reviewing how those games were managed to consider any next steps in increasing numbers.</p>

<p>SA reported no new virus cases on Monday, leaving the state's total since the start of the pandemic at 466.</p>

<p>The state has no active infections.</p>

<p>More to come.  </p>
