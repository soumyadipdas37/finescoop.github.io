<p>Garcelle added that she took issue with Richards being grilled by the other Housewives at every group gathering throughout the season.</p>

<p>'It was just like, back off a little bit, not every dinner needs to be about this. I think she's just had enough.'</p>

<p>Garcelle, who joined RHOBH in 2019, claimed that, both, her and Denise were 'warned' by their co-stars that a Housewife's 'second season' on the series can be the most tense.</p>

<p>'I believe she was warned prior to the season. That's what she says. And that's what I want to believe. Lisa Rinna was like, "the second season is usually when things happen" and I said, "Is that a threat?' And she said yes,"' she recalled.</p>

<p>In an interview with Us Weekly, Brandi spoke candidly about her side of the story and her intentions behind revealing the alleged affair. </p>

<p>'If I was just doing it to make a splash, why would I not have done it last season? Then they would have brought me back full-time this season because they would have had a giant full f**king story line,' she explained. </p>
