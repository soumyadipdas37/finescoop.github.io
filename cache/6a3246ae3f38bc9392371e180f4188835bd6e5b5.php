<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It was great night for HBO at the 2020 Emmy Awards in LA on Sunday night.</p>

<p>And leading the way for the premium cable and streaming service was the dark superhero series Watchmen which won top honors in four major categories during the Jimmy Kimmel-hosted telecast.</p>

<p>Watchmen, based on a 1980s graphic novel, won the Emmys for outstanding limited series, best actress, best supporting actor and best writing. </p>

<p>Nabbed trophies: HBO's Watchmen, based on a 1980s graphic comic and depicting white supremacy and police brutality, led the pack at the 2020 Emmys Sunday with four major wins</p>

<p>The series, which debuted last year, depicts white supremacists, police brutality and rows over mask-wearing, making it a timely piece of theatre that taps into the current zeitgeist of the United States.</p>

<p>Accepting the Emmy for outstanding limited series, Damon Lindelof and Cord Jefferson  dedicated their win to African-American victims of the 1921 Tulsa massacre.</p>

<p>'The only way to put the fires out is to fight them together,' said showrunner Lindelof.</p>

<p>'History is mystery -- it's broken into a million puzzle pieces. We know finding them will hurt. Sometimes we caused that hurt, maybe we even benefited from it,' added Lindelof, who is white.</p>

<p>Fight the fires: Accepting the Emmy for outstanding limited series, Damon Lindelof and Cord Jefferson dedicated their win to African-American victims of the 1921 Tulsa massacre</p>

<p>The winners of the Emmys this year accepted their awards from home, giving their acceptance speeches via remote camera link up. </p>

<p>Regina King, who won the lead actress Emmy for her work in Watchmen, was seen sitting in an armchair wearing a T-shirt that honored police shooting victim Breonna Taylor.</p>

<p>'This is so freaking weird,' the 49-year-old commented after being showered with confetti when her name was announced</p>

<p>Explaining why she was wearing the t-shirt, she said: 'Wearing Breonna´s likeness and representing her and her family and the stories that we were exploring, presenting and holding a mirror up to on Watchmen, it felt appropriate to represent with Breonna Taylor.'</p>

<p>She added: 'The cops still haven´t been held accountable. She represents just decades, hundreds of years of violence against Black bodies.' </p>

<p>'Freaking weird': Regina King, who won lead actressfor her work in Watchmen, was seen sitting in an armchair wearing a T-shirt that honored police shooting victim Breonna Taylor</p>

<p>Making a point: 'She represents just decades, hundreds of years of violence against Black bodies.' King, 49, said of honoring Taylor</p>

<p>'Watchmen was a story about trauma': King's co-star, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, won the Emmy for best supporting actor in a limited series</p>

<p>King's co-star, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, won the Emmy for best supporting actor in a limited series.</p>

<p>In his remarks, he shared: 'Watchmen was a story about trauma, and the lasting scars of white domestic terrorism, police corruption and brutality.' </p>

<p>In total, Watchmen took home 11 Emmys after racking up wins at the Creative Arts Emmys handed out for technical achievements.</p>

<p>That left the show two Emmys short of the all-time record of 13 held by historical mini-series John Adams. </p>

<p>Dutch courage: ABC's late night host Jimmy Kimmel served as emcee of the Emmys that were radically different from any other major awards show in Hollywood history</p>

<p>Pandemic mode: The awards show took place without an audience at LA's Staples Center and with the night's winners providing their acceptance speeches via video link</p>

<p>Fellow HBO show Succession - the saga of a powerful, backstabbing family - won big in the prestigious drama categories, while offbeat Canadian hit Schitt's Creek performed a clean sweep of the night's comedy prizes. </p>

<p>ABC late night talk show host Kimmel\ emcee'd proceedings from the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles.</p>

<p>There was no live star-studded audience and just a handful of celebrities who took part in person in the telecast after undergoing testing for COVID-19 and remaining socially distanced.</p>
