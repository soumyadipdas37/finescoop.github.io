<p>However, she has to pay a monthly mortgage of $2,160, as well as shelling out $350 per month on the water and strata rates, and other regular financial commitments.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old and her partner have moved in with her parents rent-free to save some money. </p>

<p>Mortgage: $2,160</p>

<p>Rental property: $350 (water rates, strata etc)</p>

<p>Spending: $600 ($150 a week)</p>

<p>Health insurance: $154.70</p>

<p>Phone: $129</p>

<p>Gym: $54.30</p>

<p>Chiropractor: $53.50</p>

<p>Brow appointment: $80</p>

<p>When it comes to how she spends her cash, the media professional said she allows herself $150 spending money per week.</p>

<p>She spends the rest of her monthly income on her health insurance, gym membership, mortgage, phone and rental property bills, chiropractor and beauty appointments.</p>

<p>'When my salary was impacted my partner took over our Netflix, Stan and Spotify accounts. He's also been covering my half of a meal service that we share for weekly lunches,' she told the publication.</p>

<p>This means that many of her weekday meals are free. </p>

<p>The woman said she makes savings by working from home on her laptop as much as possible, which means she buys far less cafe-bought coffee and meals.</p>

<p>'We go through a sh*t ton of coffee being at home, but we use the Nespresso machine instead of getting café coffee so it's saved us some cash there,' she said.</p>

<p>She has also saved money by switching to a cheap gym that only costs around $13.50 per week. </p>

<p>If she needs extra exercise, the media professional said she just embraces something free like a walk in her local area.</p>

<p>The woman addressed how her attitude towards money has changed since the onset of the global pandemic, as she has completely changed her discretionary spending (stock image)</p>

<p>The woman addressed how her attitude towards money has changed since the onset of the global pandemic.</p>

<p>She said she has now 'reined in' her personal spending as much as possible, especially within the beauty treatment area.</p>

<p>'Given my income has been so unpredictable, I've been putting a lot of my money into savings just in case I need to dip into it in an emergency,' she said.</p>

<p>At present, she has $20,000 in savings - and said it's the 'most she has had in a while'. </p>

<p>'After my experiences this year, it made me realise why it's really important to have some money set aside and not spend every single cent,' she said.</p>

<p>The woman said she knows she is 'lucky' because she has been able to live at home and therefore survive such a huge reduction in her income.</p>

<p>However, it has been a timely reminder to stop 'mindlessly' shopping and instead only buy herself items that bring her true joy. </p>
