<p> The Volusia County school district said Pennington did not contract the virus at work, but did not provide any evidence of that.</p>

<p>Greg told Daily Beast that Pennington was not afraid to go back to school as cases and deaths continued to rise in the country.</p>

<p>Pennington left behind various family members, including her 20-year-old son who is a collage student majoring in dance.</p>

<p>'She loved her son—did everything for him and also for the kids at the school,' Kathleen Carman, a former co-worker of Pennington, told Daily Beast.</p>

<p>Before Jones' death, he was a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and served in Operation Desert Storm.</p>

<p>'He was probably one of the most loved people [at Volusia County EMS] ever,' Greg said about his son, per Daily Beast. 'He was super with people. He was a calming influence, which I guess in that profession you need.'</p>

<p>Several tributes were posted in honor of Jones on social media and many recalled his kind nature.</p>
