<p>The footage, captured at Cahills Crossing in Kakadu National Park, in the Northern Territory, showed the four-wheel drive bravely driving through the water.</p>

<p>Onlookers filmed the crossing in the hopes of catching a glimpse of one of the crocodiles, with previous visitors to the site spotting up to 20 at a time.</p>

<p>The footage, captured at Cahills Crossing, Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, showed a four-wheel drive driving through the water</p>

<p>The driver, seen in footage supplied to NT News, slowly drove through the water as they made their way to the other side.</p>

<p>Water quickly enveloped the front of the vehicle as it reached halfway up the doors.</p>

<p>'That's pretty deep,' the woman filming said.</p>

<p>Suddenly the car started to shake as though it had run over something.</p>

<p>A crocodiles tail thrashed in the water as it swam under the car after lurking beneath the surface.</p>

<p>'You've just run over a crocodile,' the woman can be heard to say. </p>

<p>The crocodile appeared to swim away unharmed from the incident. </p>

<p>Cahills Crossing is known to be a dangerous area, with a 40-year-old man taken and killed at the site in 1987</p>

<p>Last month, Rachelle Wastle and her husband Peter were driving through the crossing when they were blocked by a dozen crocodiles. </p>

<p>Terrifying video footage shows the couple's car submerged into water as they attempted to cross to the other side of the river.  </p>

<p>The most famous death at the area was of a 40-year-old man, Kerry McLoughlin who was tragically taken and decapitated by a crocodile in 1987.  </p>

<p>The infamous Cahills Crossing is only a few metres wide, but it's one of Australia's most dangerous bodies of water.</p>

<p>Along with varying tides, the water flow is strong enough to overturn vehicles, and it serves as a feeding ground for saltwater crocodiles.</p>

<p>Dozens of divers try to venture across the submerged crossing, but end up being washed in to croc-infested waters.</p>

<p>Many have lost their lives, including fisherman, children, photographers, and backpackers.</p>

<p>Crocodile expert Grahame Webb said for every crocodile you can see, there are 10 you can't.</p>

<p>The most famous fatality at the Crossing was in 1897 when 40-year-old Kerry McLoughlin was decapitated by a crocodile on a fishing trip.</p>

<p>Rangers counted 120 crocodiles in the six-kilometre stretch around Cahills Crossing.</p>

<p>There have been five fatalities in the area so far.</p>
