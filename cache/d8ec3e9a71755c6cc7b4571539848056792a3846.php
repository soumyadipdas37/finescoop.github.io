<p>Adem Somyurek has spoken out for the first time since he was sacked in June as the minister for local government and small business, following a 60 Minutes expose on his alleged Labor branch stacking.</p>

<p>The Turkish-born former Right faction party powerbroker said Mr Andrews didn't understand how working class people often went outside after dark - despite being the leader of the Labor Party.</p>

<p>'To Andrews the curfew was a trifling thing: "Why would anyone want to go out after 8pm – you can't go to Coles or a jog so what is the problem?" He could not understand the fuss,' Mr Somyurek said in an opinion piece for The Australian.</p>

<p>Melbourne's five million residents have since August 2 been subjected to an 8pm to 5am curfew with fines of $1,652 if they are outside during those hours, in a bid to reduce active COVID-19 cases.</p>

<p>Victoria's Chief Medical Officer Brett Sutton earlier this month revealed the curfew wasn't his idea while the state's Police Commissioner Shane Patton admitted his force was only given a 'couple of hours' notice of the policy.</p>

<p>Mr Somyurek said Mr Andrews, after the hotel quarantining fiasco, became a more authoritarian leader who sidelined his ministers, including those with 'intimate knowledge of their portfolios'.</p>

<p>'Decision-making was centralised around the Premier, his private office and his department; department secretaries began reporting directly to the Premier as ministers were sidelined and the government began to operate in silos,' Mr Somyurek said.</p>

<p>Mr Somyurek said Mr Andrews, who hails from Labor's Left faction, had little regard for the economic cost of his Stage Four lockdowns.</p>

<p>'The loss of civil rights and economic damage are just collateral damage,' he said.</p>

<p>The Institute of Public Affairs, a free market think tank, estimated the Stage Four lockdowns would cost the Victorian economy $3.17billion a week.</p>

<p>By that calculation, six weeks of lockdown would cost the equivalent of Victoria's $17.7billion annual commonwealth allocation from the Goods and Services Tax proceeds. </p>

<p>The Turkish-born former Right-faction powerbroker said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews (pictured) didn't understand how working class people often went outside after dark - despite being the leader of the Labor Party</p>

<p>Mr Somyurek said Mr Andrews was an initially a consultative minister during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>That changed in June after the decision to use private security firms to guard quarantine hotels resulted in new outbreaks of the virus in the city's north and west.</p>

<p>This led to the Premier centralising power and decision-making in his office rather than debating the proposal Stage Four lockdowns with his cabinet ministers.   </p>

<p>Victoria's 761 deaths from coronavirus comprise 89.63 per cent of Australia's 849 fatalities.</p>

<p>The state's 20,042 cases also make up almost three quarters, or 74.5 per cent, of the total national case numbers of 26,898. </p>

<p>Mr Andrews' Labor government won a landslide re-election victory in November 2018, picking up wealthy electorates in Melbourne's south-east that had traditionally voted Liberal, including the seats of Burwood and Hawthorn previously held by Coalition premiers Jeff Kennett and Ted Baillieu.</p>
