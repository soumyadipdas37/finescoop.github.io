<p>Vogue injected a touch of glamour with delicate gold earrings and bracelets.</p>

<p>On her Sunday morning show on Heart, Vogue discussed a new dating app called String which allows users to communicate via voice notes only.</p>

<p>This prompted Vogue to play embarrassing voice notes from her husband Spencer, 32, as she said she’s not sure that they would have ever got married if they had met via voice notes.</p>

<p>She played amusing recordings from Spencer to her listeners, including messages where he told her that he’d taught their son his first swear word, and accidentally lost their dog (again).</p>

<p>Vogue said: 'I reckon if we had met over voice notes, I’m not 100% sure that we would have got married. He honestly leaves the worst voice notes! </p>

<p>'So I actually thought I’d go through my phone and I’m gonna show you some of stuff that he sends me, and these are actual real notes that he sends me! </p>

<p>'Right, we’ve got a dog called Winston that he’s nearly lost, not once, not twice, but on multiple occasions.'</p>

<p>Vogue then went on to play a voice note from Spencer: 'Hi darling, so you remember when I told you I forgot Winston on the way to the airport and I had to put him in a cab to pick him up? </p>

<p>New way of dating: On her Sunday morning show on Heart, she discussed a new dating app which allows users to communicate via voice notes only</p>

<p>'Well, I‘ve just taken him to the shop with me and I’ve left him outside the shop. Came home, realised he wasn’t there, went back to the shop and found him so don’t worry! Twice now, but we still have him.'</p>

<p>Vogue said: 'I mean he’s not even apologetic in that! I can hear humour in his voice, he finds it funny!!</p>

<p>She then added: 'Now, another one, I’m not sure that I can leave him alone with Theodore anymore because he’s just teaching him things that I’m not happy about'</p>

<p>Vogue played another clip from Spencer: 'Hi darling, so, I think I might have taught Theodore his first swear word accidentally. I said f*** and now he keeps on saying it. Sorry about that! You’ve got that to look forward to when you get home!'</p>

<p>Deal breaker: Vogue played embarrassing voice notes from her husband, 32, as she said she’s not sure that they would have ever got married if they had met via voice notes</p>

<p>Six weeks after giving birth to their youngest child, Gigi, in August, Vogue was forced to hit back at trolls after she was body-shamed for her post-baby weight loss.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old broadcaster garnered much adulation when she shared a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini for a tan tutorial on Instagram.</p>

<p>The star revealed that she had been subjected to some 'awful' comments for her appearance. </p>

<p>Insisting that she 'shouldn't be made to feel bad' for her own body, the mother-of-two shared a video of herself working out in a red top with black leggings.   </p>

<p>Captioning the silent clip of the fitness session, the Irish beauty wrote: 'There is no secret! I got a lot of comments and mails about the video I posted the other day. Mainly positive but my god there were some awful ones!</p>

<p>'I hate the term 'snapping back' it's not something I aspire to do after having a child nor do I think it's important. My body is different to other people's, I didn't do anything specific.</p>

<p>'I've only recently started training again, 4 times a week for 45 minutes a session. I try to eat healthily but I have not cut calories and eat a lot more than usual as I'm breastfeeding and it's important to keep calories up so you have a good milk supply.</p>

<p>'I trained the whole way throughout my pregnancy and I think that is a factor in the way I look now. I'm also VERY tall so there's a lot more room for a baby.' </p>

<p>Mummy shaming: Vogue was recently forced to hit back at trolls after she was body-shamed for her post-baby weight loss, six weeks after giving birth to her daughter Gigi </p>

<p>Revealing that she's been a fitness devotee for almost half her life, she continued: 'I've trained since I was 16, for me it's a great thing not only for my body but for my mind too.</p>

<p>'At the moment I feel permanently exhausted but training gives me energy and keeps my hormones under more control (they are still all over the place a little as with any new mother).'</p>

<p>Addressing the tanning video directly, she said: 'I didn't post that video to show off my body. I have always done tan tutorials, I don't feel the need to hide my body because as I've read 'it's unrealistic 6 weeks PP'.'</p>

<p>'What should a body look like after a baby?' Vogue challenged. 'There isn't a set way it should look. I don't want anyone to feel bad about their bodies and I certainly don't want to be made feel bad about my own. ❤️.'</p>
