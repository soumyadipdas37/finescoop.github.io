<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>'It's a miracle': The five-year-old boy allegedly beaten within an inch of his life has woken up in hospital - where his father is looking after him</p>

<p>The five-year-old boy who was allegedly bashed within 'an inch of his life' by his mother's boyfriend has woken up in hospital - with loved ones hailing it as a miracle.  </p>

<p>The child's relieved father was on Thursday night by the boy's bedside at Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney's west.</p>

<p>'He woke up (on Tuesday) and now his daddy is watching him,' the boy's aunt told friends. 'He's looking after him.' </p>

<p>A second close to the family confirmed the hopeful development to Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'It's a miracle - I couldn't imagine how (the father) would be if he lost him, he means the absolute world to him.'</p>

<p>Police found the infant at his mother's alleged 'house of horrors' in Cabramatta after a commotion about 9.50pm last Friday night.</p>

<p>The boy suffered bruises from 'head to toe' after a savage beating allegedly doled out by the boyfriend, a Vietnamese student. </p>

<p>Both the boy's mother, 31, and her lover, 20, were arrested and the child was rushed to hospital, where he was placed on life support.</p>

<p>The suspected abuse the boy suffered was so bad one of his doctors 'physically sobbed' at his injuries. </p>

<p>Both the boy's mother (left) and her boyfriend (right) have been arrested and charged - her with failing to protect, and him with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm</p>

<p>Police allege the infant was allegedly wounded by his mother's lover at some point between the beginning of July and the end of August. He was found here in a bad way last Friday night</p>

<p>The boy has woken up in hospital and his dad (above, on his second birthday) is by his bedside. 'I couldn't imagine how (the father) would be if he lost him'</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands police will allege the boy was struck in the head with a stick or wooden pole during the alleged ordeal. </p>

<p>A court has heard that the child had suffered brain injury and had splinters throughout his body. </p>

<p>The boy was in placed on life support and was in a critical condition. </p>

<p>It was five days before he came around. </p>

<p>But relatives are understood to be worried about the boy suffering lasting trauma as well as the ongoing effects of his head injuries. He remains in hospital. </p>

<p>The boy's father and mother have been estranged for some time, with both moving on with new partners in the past two years.</p>

<p>'I miss and love you so much', the father captioned a picture of his son on Facebook in 2018, after his relationship with the mother fizzled.   </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the boy's mother presented herself to friends as a doting parent who lavished her son with toys.</p>

<p>The mother - who can't be identified for legal reasons - described the five-year-old as her 'little prince'</p>

<p>Some of the mother's soppy posts to Facebook prior to her arrest by NSW Police last Friday</p>

<p>The boy's toys sat idly out the front of the woman's red-brick Cabramatta rental this week</p>

<p>Piles of water bottles, Red Bull and coconut drink were piled up in the home's front yard as police examined the crime scene at the weekend</p>

<p>She described the child as her 'prince' on Facebook and said she hoped he grew up to be 'obedient and smart.' </p>

<p>'You are all of my life,' she said.</p>

<p>The mother has been charged with failing to care for the boy.</p>

<p>Her boyfriend, a student originally from Vietnam, was charged with wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. </p>

<p>Police are investigating whether the boy suffered from ongoing abuse from his mum's boyfriend in the two months prior to him being found at home.</p>

<p>Both the mum and her boyfriend, who cannot be named as it would identify the victim, have been refused bail.</p>

<p>They will face court at a later date. </p>
