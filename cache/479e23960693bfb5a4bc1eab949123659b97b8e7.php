<p>Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has hit out at 'fake news' in a message posted on Instagram</p>

<p>In the image Suarez is seen smiling while in training with Barcelona.</p>

<p>There have been suggestions that the Uruguay international's contract, which has less than a year to run, could be terminated by mutual consent to allow him to depart.</p>

<p>However, it appears that a move to see Suarez leave Barcelona isn't as close as has been reported. </p>

<p>Suarez, who is into the last year of his deal, has been heavily linked with a move to Juventus</p>

<p>New Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman reportedly told Suarez that he isn't part of his plans</p>

<p>Reports indicated that Suarez has agreed terms on a £9million-a-year salary with Juventus.</p>

<p>Barcelona are in process of attempting to rebuild their squad, and have been boosted by the news that Lionel Messi will remain at the club this season.</p>

<p>Since joining Barcelona in 2014 he has scored 198 goals in 283 appearances.</p>
