<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 63-year-old jobseeker has won an army of fans after he donned his best suit and started handing out CVs at a railway station as he desperately searched for a job.</p>

<p>Trevor Walford, 63, was made redundant from his role as a restaurant manager during the pandemic.</p>

<p>But after spending months at home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, applying for hundreds of roles he decided to try something different.</p>

<p>In a bid to get back to work he travelled to Leeds railway station where he stood with a suit, sign and hundreds of CVs in the hopes of tracking down a new employer.  </p>

<p>Trevor Walford, 63, stood in Leeds railway station and handed out his CV after he got nowhere when applying to hundreds of jobs online. He is from Keighley, West Yorkshire</p>

<p>Mr Walford said: 'I live alone and after months of sitting here, applying for jobs online, I got tired of it all.</p>

<p>'I figured I should put myself out there, so that’s exactly what I did. I didn’t think much of it really.</p>

<p>'But when I was in Leeds station, the amount of people that came over - probably because I was in a suit and a crappy sign - and spoke to me, it was all just so brilliant. I spoke to so many people.'</p>

<p>Mr Walford said he was beyond devastated after being made redundant back in March having been in the restaurant business for many years.</p>

<p>He would spend almost every hour of every day trying to find roles but with restaurants closing around the country, he struggled to find work.</p>

<p>Mr Walford said: 'I suppose I am one of many who are in this situation - it has been a very difficult time.</p>

<p>'But after feeling sorry for myself, I realised that I do not want to just sit around and do nothing. I just cannot do that. So I begun looking for work anywhere I could get it.'</p>

<p>The former restaurant manager said he thought he would put himself out there</p>

<p>Mr Walford admitted he feels employees woMr uld shy away from hiring him because of his age and he thinks he has been shunned from certain jobs in favour of younger workers.</p>

<p>But Mr Walford added: 'I am as fit as I have been. I could probably do more push-ups than most 30-year-olds.</p>

<p>'Just because of my age, and previous roles, does not mean I am not happy to take a role - I would be happy to stack shelves.</p>

<p>'Right now, I need to keep my head above water. And I want to give myself the best opportunity to be back in work.</p>

<p>'That’s why I put the suit on and travelled to the station.'</p>

<p>He lost his job during the pandemic. Pictured above is an LNER train pulling in to Leeds station</p>

<p>After spending hours, he handed out well over 200 CVs and spoke to hundreds of people.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Mr Walford’s LinkedIn page registered more than 100,000 page views.</p>

<p>Mr Walford said: 'I’m blown away by all the support, but all I want to be back in work.</p>

<p>'I know it’s a difficult time right now, for so many people. My message to those in my situation would be to get out there and keep on pushing, keep on knocking on the door.</p>

<p>'If you show that you really want it, you’ll give yourselves the best chance possible. I hope I have done that.'</p>
