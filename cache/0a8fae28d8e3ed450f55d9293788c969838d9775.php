<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The AFL has officially banned Mad Monday celebrations in the Sunshine State days after a punch up outside a Gold Coast kebab shop.</p>

<p>Richmond players Sydney Stack, 20, and Callum Coleman-Jones, 21 were suspended for ten games after they broke the AFL's return to play protocols. </p>

<p>Footage shows the pair brawling on Friday morning after they were allegedly kicked out of a strip club. They were given lengthy playing bans and hefty fines over the scuffle. </p>

<p>Since the scandal erupted the AFL has contacted all 18 club bosses to put a stop to end of year celebrations in a bid to keep the code's reputation intact. </p>

<p>Mad Monday is an sporting rite of passage where players dress up, and come together to drink and celebrate the end of the sporting season with their teammates.</p>

<p>Any decision to give this type of festivity the green-light was likely to be questioned by the public during a ban on large group gatherings during COVID-19.</p>

<p>Officials asked clubs as early as August 24, before the latest gaffe, to call off celebrations across Queensland due to COVID-19, reported the Herald Sun. </p>

<p>Teams from New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia will be allowed to celebrate when they return home.</p>

<p>It is unlikely Victorian clubs will allow large gatherings upon their exit from Queensland while restrictions remain in place.</p>

<p>In Queensland private gatherings indoors are currently limited to ten people but licensed venues with COVID-safe plans are allowed larger numbers. </p>

<p>An AFL spokesman confirmed the decision to cancel this year's celebrations. </p>

<p>Sydney Stack, 20, and Callum Coleman-Jones, 21, landed the Richmond Football Club $100,000 fine over their actions.</p>

<p>The pair were ordered to pay $75,000 as well as facing lengthy playing bans and being kicked of Queensland by authorities.</p>

<p>The AFL said the pair breached the code's return to play protocols by taking an Uber, visiting a non-approved Gold Coast venue and becoming involved in the incident which required police intervention. </p>

<p>Footage from a kebab shop allegedly shows the pair fighting in the street.  </p>

<p>'Stack was detained by police and released a short time after,' an AFL statement read.   </p>

<p>The pair were involved in an altercation after being evicted from Hollywood Showgirls (pictured) on the glitter strip's Orchid Ave at 3.30 Friday morning</p>

<p>Under the AFL's COVID-safe plan players are only allowed to visit approved venues. </p>

<p>While official Mad Monday celebrations will be banned, some players are already organising to stay in Queensland for holidays when the season is over.</p>

<p>By then they will have have checked out of AFL hubs across Queensland, meaning they no longer need to comply with the code's COVID-19 protocols.</p>

<p>An official announcement is expected from Queensland Chief Health officer Dr Jeannette Young for players on post-season holidays. </p>
