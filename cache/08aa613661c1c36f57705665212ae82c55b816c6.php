<p>Candid: Ricky Gervais revealed to fans on Tuesday that he didn't tell his parents about his financial woes prior to his rise to fame as he 'tried not to be a burden' in their final days</p>

<p>'I hope they didn't worry about me. I tried not to be too much of a burden. I tried not to complain too much about anything. </p>

<p>'Because of that, I didn't want to burden them. You don't want them to feel... You don't want your parents to worry about you. </p>

<p>'So when they go, "Are you alright?" You go, "Yeah, I'm alright". You don't want to go, "No, I'm hating life. I've got no f****** money. I'm p****** in the sink".' </p>

<p>'No, I was always happy. They knew I was always happy. It wasn't like they were sitting around going, "I hope he becomes an international comedian before we die."'</p>

<p>Ricky explained: 'My mum saw a little bit of it, on the 11 o'clock show. I remember I went home after the 11 o'clock show and she was sort of proud of me, but embarrassed at the same time. </p>

<p>'She said to our neighbour, "Here's the one, the one on telly. I didn't teach him to swear like that!"'</p>

<p>Ricky also insisted fame meant nothing to his family and instead says it was more important that he was a 'happy' person. </p>

<p>Answering a fans 'lovely' question, he went on: 'They both knew I was happy, and I always have been. For them, fame would have been irrelevant. Thank you, lovely question to end.' </p>
