<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Piers Morgan launched a scathing attack on the Kardashian clan following the announcement their reality show is coming to an end. </p>

<p>Discussing the news on Wednesday's episode of Good Morning Britain, the 55-year-old host did not hold back with his withering scepticism as he claimed that the show's poor ratings must be the reason for the cancellation.</p>

<p>The broadcaster went on to state that Kim Kardashian would have been pleased by her husband Kanye West's recent mental health episodes as it would provide content for upcoming seasons.</p>

<p>Happier times: Piers Morgan launched a scathing attack on Kim Kardashian clan during Wednesday's GMB following the announcement their reality show is coming to an end</p>

<p>Kim, 39, shocked fans on Tuesday night by announcing that her family's iconic reality show is ending after 14 years on air, but did not give a reason for the decision.</p>

<p>Pretending to be in tears over the cancellation, Piers announced the news for GMB viewers as they looked back at a montage from the show. </p>

<p>As co-host Susanna Reid commented the Kardashian clan look different now to when  the show started in 2007, Piers chipped in 'Could it be a plastic surgeon by any chance?'</p>

<p>He continued: 'A bunch of very average looking dumbo bimbos have taken us all to the cleaners and made billions out of prancing around and doing this. </p>

<p>'They have taken us to the cleaners. Not a brain cell between them.'</p>

<p>Upsetting: The broadcaster went on to state that Kim Kardashian would have been pleased by husband Kanye West 's bipolar episode as it would provide content for upcoming seasons</p>

<p>Discussing Kim's recent career change as she studies to become a lawyer, Piers scoffed: 'She's become a paralegal she tells us. </p>

<p>'She latches onto crowd pleasing stories of injustice. Nothing wrong with that, if she'd done that from the start we would all probably have more respect with her.'</p>

<p>Reflecting on their friendship and famous falling out, he mused: 'I got on fine with her at the start but I fell out with her when she got into that nonsensical stuff where she posed topless with Emily Ratajkowski and flipped the bird and said look at us we're feminists. I thought "oh shut up".</p>

<p>'From there it's been a very long, tortuous journey. They're not feminists. They're just people making billions and showing us every tiny, slithering detail of their gory little private lives. </p>

<p>'They haven't done this [cancelled the show] because they're tired of showing us about their lives. It's the ratings.'</p>

<p>Shock announcement: Kim revealed her family has made the 'difficult decision' to end Keeping Up With The Kardashians in a shock statement on Tuesday night </p>

<p>Not sure if ratings were purely the reason for the cancellation, Susanna brought up Kanye's recent concerning behaviour. </p>

<p>The rapper was said to be in the midst of a 'serious bipolar episode' earlier this year when he announced that he would be running for President. </p>

<p>In a statement, Kim later said 'her family is powerless' as she discussed 'brilliant but complicated' Kanye's bi-polar battle after he accused her on Twitter of cheating with Meek Mill, being a 'white supremacist' and called her mother 'Kris Jong-Un' .</p>

<p>Not impressed: Discussing the news, the 55-year-old host did not hold back with his withering scepticism as he claimed that the show's poor ratings must be the reason for the cancellation</p>

<p>Susanna mused, 'I wonder if what Kanye's been through they've had a moment of soul searching? That selling your personal life constantly is probably not a great idea'. </p>

<p>Yet Piers was unconvinced, stating: 'No. It's about the ratings. She had Kanye's meltdown down as season 18!'</p>

<p>Mimicking Kim as he rubbed his hands with glee, he squealed: 'Kanye's having an episode, whap-a-woo that's 19 sewn up!'  </p>

<p>Later in the show, Piers went on to brand the Kardashian clan 'talentless' and 'vacuous' in another scathing putdown.  </p>

<p>Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which helped make Kim and her siblings Kourtney, Khloe, Kylie and Kendall household names and launched their careers in the fashion and beauty business, will air its last season early next year.</p>

<p>There was no reasons for the decision but E! said in a statement that it respects ‘the family's decision to live their lives without our cameras.’ </p>

<p>In recent years numerous siblings, most recently Kourtney, have been reluctant to film the show. </p>

<p>Kim has also endured a turbulent year with her husband Kanye's mental health battle and controversial presidential run putting unprecedented strain on her marriage.</p>

<p>The beginning of the end: Although Piers and Kim used to be friendly, he revealed that he grew frustrated with her after she shared topless selfies with Emily Ratajkowski claiming that they were 'feminists' </p>

<p>Throughout the years the show chronicled key events in the personal and professional lives of the California family, including Kim Kardashian's marriages to Kris Humphries and West, an armed robbery in Paris, the break-up of Khloe Kardashian's marriage to basketball player Lamar Odom, and the transition of family patriarch Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner.</p>

<p>In an Instagram message posted on Tuesday, Kim, wrote: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p>

<p>After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children.</p>

<p>'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Thank you and goodnight! Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which helped make the Kardashian/Jenners and their friends household names will air its last season early next year</p>

<p>Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.</p>

<p>'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.'</p>

<p>'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.' </p>

<p>While the show has undoubtedly had an extraordinary run, its more recent series have suffered poor ratings. </p>

<p>In April this year, it was reported that viewership had sunk to 871,000 viewers, making that episode the 4th lowest rated episode ever.  </p>

<p>At its peak, KUWTK earned E! its most-watched day ever, when 10.5 million viewers tuned in to watch Kim's ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries - the episode, Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event - Part 2, aired in 2011.</p>

<p>Keeping Up With The Kardashians was a ratings winner right out of the gate when it premiered in October 2007 on cable network E!.</p>

<p>It had been pitched by mom-of-six Kris Jenner to  TV host and producer Ryan Seacrest who was looking to bring a fly-on-the-wall show to E! following the huge success of MTV's The Osbournes that ran from 2002 to 2005.</p>

<p>Kris persuaded him that she and her children - three daughters and a son with former O.J. Simpson defense attorney Robert Kardashian and two daughters with Olympic decathlete Bruce Jenner - would be a perfect fit. </p>

<p>Fly on the wall: Keeping Up With The Kardashians was a ratings winner right out of the gate when it premiered in October 2007 on cable network E!</p>

<p>A few months before the first episode was set to air, a sex tape featuring Kris' daughter Kim Kardashian was leaked, generating headlines and interest in the 27-year-old.</p>

<p>She had made the tape in 2002 with then boyfriend Ray J but the timing of its release five years later couldn't have been better timed. </p>

<p>The publicity surrounding the sex tape considerably raised Kim's public profile; until then she was best known for being an assistant to Simple Life star and hotel heiress Paris Hilton. </p>

<p>Timing: Kris Jenner masterminded the reality show and a few months before the first episode aired, a sex tape starring her daughter Kim was leaked, generating huge interest in the series</p>

<p>The E! series made global stars of Kim and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian as well as her half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner. </p>

<p>In the past 13 years, they have grown up on camera, sharing their life and loves, heartache and happiness, their changing faces and changing bodies, and the births of their own children.</p>

<p>More than that, though, they have taken TV fame and spun it into a huge money-making empire, with a lot of help from social media and some very clever marketing.</p>

<p>They mastered the art of keeping hundreds of millions of Twitter and Instagram users engaged with multiple posts a day and then found ways to make money from it.</p>

<p>They used their platforms to sell everything from makeup and perfume to waist trainers and underwear, while also striking lucrative endorsement deals and signing up for high-paid public appearances.  </p>

<p>Throughout it all, Kris has managed her children's careers, taking 10 percent of their earnings in addition to her own fees from the TV show and its spin-offs.</p>

<p>While KUWTK may be coming to an end after 20 seasons, there's no doubt we haven't heard the last of the momager, her kids and grandkids. </p>

<p>Kylie Jenner - KUWTK made her a billionaire (well, almost) </p>

<p>She is the youngest of Kris Jenner's six children but she's also now the richest.</p>

<p>Kylie Jenner, 23, is the youngest but richest of the KUWTK stars</p>

<p>Kylie, 23, made the cover of Forbes magazine in 2019 as the 'the world's youngest self-made billionaire' after she sold 51 percent of her Kylie Cosmetics company to beauty giant Coty in a deal valued at $1.2 billion.</p>

<p>Forbes subsequently retracted the 'billionaire' title reckoning that, in reality, she was only worth an estimated $900 million.</p>

<p>Kylie's personal wealth came thanks mainly to her decision to start getting lip fillers when she was 18. And while she initially denied getting enhancements, she later acknowledged it and launched a collection of lip kits in 2015.</p>

<p>The following year, due to the tremendous success of her initial products, she launched Kylie Cosmetics. </p>

<p>Kylie has also partnered with sister Kendall in a clothing line, founded her own skincare line, Kylie Skin, and released her own fragrance through half-sister Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty.  </p>

<p>Kim Kardashian - Game app, shapewear and beauty products add up to $900 million</p>

<p>It can certainly be argued that without her sex tape, she and her family might never have achieved unimaginable wealth.</p>

<p>But while Kim Kardashian Superstar raised her profile, Kim, 39, made sure to capitalize on every opportunity that came her way subsequently.</p>

<p>Kim, 29, earns up to  a rumored $1 million for a paid Instagram post</p>

<p>Unquestionably the star of her family's reality show, her televised 2011 wedding to NBA pro Kris Humphries was a ratings blockbuster. Her divorce and subsequent marriage to rapper Kanye West kept fans fascinated by her private life.</p>

<p>Forbes estimates Kim's fortune to be $900 million.</p>

<p>In 2014, she launched mobile game app Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and it made $1.6 million in the first five days after its release. In 2015, she released her own range of Kimojis.</p>

<p>In addition to her TV fees, paid endorsements and appearances, the bulk of Kim's wealth comes thanks to her KKW Beauty company. </p>

<p>In 2019, the Product line raked in $100 million and she gained $200 million by selling a 20 percent stake in the company to Coty, the same company that bought Kylie's brand. </p>

<p>Her SKIMS shapewear launched last year is also a huge revenue generator and she can earn up to $1 million for a paid Instagram post. </p>

<p>Kris Jenner - the momager takes her cut to the tune of $90 million (at the very least) </p>

<p>As her daughters' manager, Kris, 64, get a 10 percent cut of each of their earnings</p>

<p>Kris, 64, is the mastermind behind everything Kardashian, and that's how she makes her fortune.</p>

<p>In 2018, Forbes reckoned her net worth to be $37.5 million but it's certainly grown plenty since then with some placing her true net worth at somewhere between $90 and $140 million.</p>

<p>The bulk of her income comes from her 10 percent fees as the manager of her children's careers.</p>

<p>She also has stakes in some of her kids' companies; for example, when Kylie sold her cosmetics company in 2019, Kris pocketed $60 million from the deal, Forbes reported.</p>

<p>Khloe Kardashian - denim and workouts bring her an estimated $50 million</p>

<p>Khloe Kardashian, 36, has dramatically transformed her look during the series</p>

<p>Khloe, 36, has carved out her own niche in the Kardashian family marketplace.</p>

<p>She is perhaps the sister who has most transformed their look in recent years, almost to the point of being unrecognizable.</p>

<p>Her fitness regimen in the wake of her divorce from Lamar Odom helped land her her own TV show Revenge Body, and she also hosted the TV chat show Kocktails With Khloe.</p>

<p>In 2016, she founded Good American, which began with a line of jeans and has since expanded to include bodysuits, activewear and swimwear. </p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian - lifestyle website helps Poosh her earnings to upwards of $35 million</p>

<p>Kourtney Kardashian, 41, makes most of her money from the TV show</p>

<p>Kourtney, 41, the eldest of the Kardashian siblings, is most reliant on the TV show for her income.</p>

<p>However, like her sisters, she makes money with paid product endorsements and paid Instagram posts.</p>

<p>In 2017 she partnered with fashion retailer Pretty Little Thing.</p>

<p>Then last year, Kourtney launched her lifestyle website Poosh where companies can sell their products directly to consumers attracted to Kourtney's brand.  </p>

<p>Kendall Jenner - modeling career enhanced TV fame for $30 million net worth</p>

<p>Kendall Jenner, 24, earns millions from her modeling career</p>

<p>Kendall, 24, turned her attention several years ago to trying to fulfill her dream of becoming a fashion model.</p>

<p>Thanks to her TV and social media celebrity, she won contracts with some of the world's top brands making her the highest-paid model of 2018, according to Forbes.</p>

<p>Forbes estimated her net worth at $22.5 million but it's only increased since then.</p>

<p>She has also teamed up with younger sister Kylie for clothing, jewelry and swimwear lines and like the rest of her sisters, she gets plenty of paid endorsement work.</p>

<p>Rob Kardashian - sporadic TV appearances net him $10 million</p>

<p>Rob, 33, is the only boy in the family of girls and has played a much more low-key role in the KUWTK world.</p>

<p>Initially featuring on the reality show, he subsequently retreated from the spotlight as he battled a number of health issues.</p>

<p>He had his won sock company Arthur George and in 2016, he agreed to star in a spin-off Rob &amp; Chyna, that followed his relationship with fiancee Blac Chyna and the birth of their daughter Dream.</p>

<p>His estimated $10 million net worth comes mostly from his TV appearance fees. </p>
