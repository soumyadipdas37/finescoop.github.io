<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Shamed England star Mason Greenwood is in more hot water - for holding rowdy house parties throughout the coronavirus lockdown at a secret address without the knowledge of his Manchester United bosses, MailOnline can reveal.</p>

<p>The young striker rented the three-storey property through Airbnb 'five or six times' during the pandemic where neighbours complained they were kept awake until the early hours by blaring music. </p>

<p>Now his club Manchester United are investigating amid claims the troubled star hosted his latest party on Friday August 28 – just eight days before he broke England team protocols by inviting the girls to the Saga Radisson Blu hotel in Reykjavik on September 5.</p>

<p>Greenwood, 18, yesterday issued a grovelling apology after being axed from England's squad for sneaking the two Icelandic women into the team hotel. </p>

<p>Mason Greenwood held six rowdy parties at this house (above) throughout the coronavirus lockdown, MailOnline can reveal</p>

<p>The 18-year-old was pictured today driving a brand new £58,000 Mercedes-Benz in Manchester after being kicked out of the England squad for breaching Covid protocols by sneaking two women into the team hotel in Iceland</p>

<p>Greenwood and England teammate Phil Foden (pictured together left) were sent home in disgrace after they smuggled an Icelandic model and her cousin into the Saga Radisson Blu hotel in Reykjavik on September 5</p>

<p>Nadia Sif Lindal Gunnarsdottir (left), 20, and her cousin Lara Clausen (right), 19, told how they spent the night with the England footballers after their debuts against Iceland, but said that the stars behaved 'like perfect gentlemen'</p>

<p>Sean McKay, who lives next door to the house Greenwood rented, which can sleep 13 people, said: 'Mason Greenwood has been holding these raucous parties down our road for months. He invites all these people round and the noise has been unbearable. I have been round there a number of times asking them to turn it down.</p>

<p>'The music can go on until 4am or 5am, keeping me awake with this deep booming bass. The house shakes and there's loads of raised voices and laughing.</p>

<p>'One night a group of kids were at the front door shouting: 'Mason Greenwood, we don't care who you are. You are a s*** footballer. Let us in or we'll break your legs.'</p>

<p>'I work normal hours and need to sleep. It's been a nightmare.'</p>

<p>Sean, 28, who works in advertising, went on: 'I know he's a young lad and I don't criticise him for having to party. But we are in a pandemic and most people are social-distancing. He clearly has not and somebody needs to speak to him.</p>

<p>'When I heard two England footballers were caught breaking social distancing rules, I knew one of them had to be him.'</p>

<p>He added: 'These young footballers have too much money and too much time. They need to learn the rules though like most of us have.</p>

<p>'All I want is for him to go away from my street and not to have any more parties so we can have some peace and quiet,' he added.</p>

<p>Sean was so incensed by the disturbance at the last party over the August Bank Holiday weekend he sent an email to property managers Urban Bubble in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>'It's now 12:47am Friday morning,' he wrote. 'And the loud music has returned with the same people hosting a party in the property next to ours. I've been round to ask them to keep the music quiet and they still haven't turned it down to an acceptable level. Food still keeps getting delivered to our house, this time turning up gone midnight.</p>

<p>'Whatever charges/punishments you are charging the owners, obviously are not working as the parties keep going on every couple of weeks, during the week.</p>

<p>The house rented by Greenwood sleeps 13 people and has until recently been available to rent on Airbnb and Booking.com</p>

<p>Alma Volk, from property management firm Urban Bubble, said the owner Jing Zhu was being investigated for breaching the terms of her lease for renting the property out</p>

<p>When approached about the parties, owner Mrs Zhu told Mailonline she no longer lives at the property (above) and is selling it</p>

<p>'We also happen to know the person hosting the parties is a Premier League football player at Manchester United, so charging the owner breach of covenant charges is likely not going to work as these charges won't be an issue financially for him.'</p>

<p>Alma Volk, from Urban Bubble, said the owner Jing Zhu was being investigated for breaching the terms of her lease for renting the property out on Airbnb and Booking.com.</p>

<p>Mrs Zhu told Mailonline she no longer lives at the property and is in the process of selling it.</p>

<p>A source at Manchester United said the club will be supportive of their young star over his troubles in Iceland and partying during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Greenwood and Manchester City star Foden, 20, were axed from the England squad and sent home in disgrace after sneaking model Nadia Sif Lindal Gunnarsdottir, 20, and her cousin Lara Clausen, 19, into the team hotel just hours after making their England debuts.</p>

<p>Icelandic authorities were furious at the breach of its strict Covid-19 guidelines while the pair also broke the 'bubble' rules designed to protect them and the England squad.</p>

<p>Footage showed the two Icelandic cousins nervously making their way to the hotel in the early hours of Sunday, with Lara saying she felt 'like an escort'.</p>

<p>They successfully made their way in, and a photo taken by them shows father-of0ne Foden in his pants with his bottom showing.</p>

<p>Nadia and Lara also posted a snap of them 'chillin with Mason Greenwood &amp; Phil Foden'.</p>

<p>The two girls (Nadia pictured right and her cousin and friend Lara left) pictured on the night they went to the England team's hotel to meet the young stars, who both made their debuts for the national team against Iceland on Saturday</p>

<p>The two girls are believed to have spent several hours at the hotel then left before breakfast.</p>

<p>England boss Gareth Southgate branded his young players 'naive' and said they had 'no alternative' but to axe them from the squad.</p>

<p>City slammed Foden's behaviour as 'totally inappropriate' while United were 'disappointed' in Greenwood.</p>

<p>In a statement afterwards, Greenwood said: 'Having now had the chance to reflect on what's happened, I can only apologise to everyone for the embarrassment I have caused.</p>

<p>'It was irresponsible of me to break the Covid-19 protocols which are in place to protect players, staff and the public. In particular, I want to apologise to Gareth Southgate, for letting him down, when he had shown great trust in me.</p>

<p>'Playing for England was one of the proudest moments in my life and I only have myself to blame for this huge mistake. I promise my family, the fans, Manchester United and England that this is a lesson I will learn from.' </p>

<p>It is understood that Greenwood has been tested regularly for Covid-19 during the pandemic and the results have always been negative. </p>

<p>He is also to be re-tested within days following his exclusion from the England squad. The player has also told the club that he has always done his best to stay within social distancing guidelines during the pandemic. Manchester United, however, declined to comment. </p>
