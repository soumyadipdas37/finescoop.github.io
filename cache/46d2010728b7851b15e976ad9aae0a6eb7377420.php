<p>But it appears the coastal town in northern New South Wales is struggling to keep up with the influx of newcomers arriving from big cities.</p>

<p>Locals tell Daily Mail Australia that a combination of factors - including poor infrastructure, COVID-19 and the Hollywood spotlight - has made Byron Bay a less desirable place to live. </p>

<p>Byron Shire has a population of close to 30,000, while the town of Byron Bay has a population of about 9,000.</p>

<p>Ray White real estate agent Matthew McCormack says the market is the strongest and most competitive it has been in five years.</p>

<p>'It's cut-throat at the moment, you've got to have your cash ready to go,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>With interstate and international buyers focusing on Byron, properties are apparently being snapped up sight unseen or via Zoom inspections. </p>
