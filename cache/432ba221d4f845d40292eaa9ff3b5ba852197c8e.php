<p>When asked when they will try for a baby, Molly-Mae, who has been dating Tommy for one year, said: 'Probably not ages, like, I've always wanted to have a baby slightly younger anyway, so not going to be super, super old or not going to be super, super young.'</p>

<p>'So as long as my family's happy and I'm happy and Tommy's happy, then that's all that really matters to me.</p>

<p>'You just become used to it which is disgusting really, but I'm literally a size 8 so if I'm fat and lardy... then you cannot pay any notice to it and I'm quite good at it now.'</p>
