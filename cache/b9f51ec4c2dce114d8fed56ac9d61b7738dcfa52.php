<p>In a statement to Daily Mail Australia last week, London defended her decision to show off her baby bump on OnlyFans.</p>

<p>More secure: London said she made the decision to post on OnlyFans because over the years she and Reece have been 'harassed to the point where we've had to seek legal action'  </p>

<p>'I have 100 per cent control of my profile and what people have access to and comment on.</p>

<p>'I never said it was compulsory. People can choose if they wish to subscribe or not. If people don't like the idea of it or disagree with my decision then they don't have to be involved...</p>
