<p>'I love this appliance! I love that you can throw everything in, press a button and have a perfect soup 21 minutes later! I love that the volume makes exactly two days of soup. I love that it blends and is super easy to clean.

One drawback however is that shoppers have found starchy ingredients like potatoes can cause some burning on the base. </p>

<p>'I love my soup maker and use it most days. In order for the contents not to burn and stick to the bottom make sure you put water in first and not the ingredients or it will catch and be difficult to clean. I’ve had various results using different ideas that I tend to wing in there depending what I have kicking about. The machine is super simple to use but can go wrong if you don’t follow a few rules, one being you need the veg pretty small or it won’t chop and will stop the blades.'</p>

<p>Another commented: 'There is nothing to dislike about this product. Easy to use and clean. We've gone mad on soups since having this and we've also cut down on waste because we're constantly using left overs. My friend recommended this to me I I would highly recommend this to everybody who wants to created quick and easy soup with very little fuss!' </p>
