<p>She said their relationship was special but they were too young to understand true love.</p>

<p>The pair have only been dating for a short time but have known each other for nine years as Michael was Chantelle's mother's neighbour. </p>

<p>She said at the time of their engagement: 'OK, I know it's lockdown and isolation but he just asked me to marry him: I said YES. I will love him for ever.'  </p>

<p>They had only started dating in January and decided to move in together at the start of lockdown.</p>

<p>And by April they were engaged after Michael got down on one knee while they were making spaghetti bolognese at home.</p>

<p>Chantelle found fame on Celebrity Big Brother 4 in 2006, where she was tasked with trying to the convince her fellow housemates she was a genuine star, by claiming she was a member of the pop group Kandy Floss. </p>

<p>She went onto win that series of CBB and sparked a romance with Ordinary Boys singer Preston. They married seven months after leaving the house, before splitting in June 2007. </p>
