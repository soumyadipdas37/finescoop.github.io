<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.' This opening line to L. P. Hartley's The Go-Between is one of the best-known in British literature. Published in 1953, the novel harked back to the start of the 20th Century, telling the story of a boy who, while spending the summer with a school friend at a grand country house in Norfolk, passes messages between his friend's elder sister and a local farmer with whom she is conducting a clandestine affair.</p>

<p>It was a world with which the author was familiar, as Hartley did indeed spend a summer with a school friend at such a house in Norfolk. But Hartley's own childhood home – Fletton Tower in Cambridgeshire – was itself grand too, with seven bedrooms and five reception rooms, extensive grounds, a stained-glass window, and, as its name suggests, a tower.</p>

<p>However, while Fletton Tower might look like it is in the heart of the countryside, it is only just over a mile from Peterborough city centre – an illusion created by the large numbers of trees that surround it.</p>

<p>'People just don't know we live here,' says florist and mother- of-three Joanne Poulter, who is selling the property</p>

<p>The Grade II listed property, which was built in the 1840s, was owned by the Hartley family for almost all of the 20th Century – they bought it in 1908</p>

<p>It still has lots of original features including a servant's hatch in the kitchen, a butler's pantry and a wine cellar</p>

<p>There is a snooker room, and the utility room is the house's former coal bunker. Outside there is a walled garden, a vegetable patch and triple garage. There is also a double-storey stable block and workshop</p>

<p>Joanne adds: 'The mature trees look amazing, especially at this time of the year. We can't be seen from the road. It's such a shock when you come down the drive and there's this really warm, cosy house'</p>

<p>A gym in the stables and a study with three work stations have been a godsend during the lockdown, says Joanne</p>

<p>'People just don't know we live here,' says florist and mother- of-three Joanne Poulter, who is selling the property. 'I've lived in Peterborough my whole life and before I came here even I didn't know the house was here. It's just like being in an oasis.'</p>

<p>She adds: 'The mature trees look amazing, especially at this time of the year. We can't be seen from the road. It's such a shock when you come down the drive and there's this really warm, cosy house.</p>

<p>'It's brilliant for parties, outside and inside.'</p>

<p>In his memoirs, Hartley, who died in 1972, referenced a Victorian bath at the house, which is still there. And Joanne has also kept on something else from the days when the Hartleys were there: a tradition of animal-rearing. 'They bred deerhounds,' she says. 'Well, we've got three goats. It's quite nice, because we get children peeking through the bushes to see them!'</p>
