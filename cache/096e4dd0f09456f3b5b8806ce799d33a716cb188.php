<p>A man walks into a Nisa store in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear on September 13 around 1.30pm wearing a scarf over his face</p>

<p>The shopkeeper was left with cuts and bruising but was not badly injured. </p>

<p>Chronicle Live reports that the suspect then left the store and fled down the street on foot. </p>

<p>Northumbria Police do not think the attack was related to a robbery and was possibly linked to an argument over the suspect being asked to wear a face mask. </p>

<p>Reportedly the shopkeeper made the request while himself being exempt from wearing one because of underlying health issues. </p>

<p>Police have released the CCTV footage in a bid to uncover further information from potential witnesses.</p>

<p>The suspect grabs the shopkeeper, who isn't wearing a face mask because of underlying health issues, and drags him onto the counter</p>

<p>The suspect is described as Asian, in his 20s or 30s, of slim build and wearing a grey and black tracksuit. </p>

<p>PC Martine Coxon, of Northumbria Police, said: 'The victim was working behind the counter but not wearing a mask as he is exempt due to underlying health conditions.</p>

<p>'Shortly before the assault he had asked a customer to put on a mask but the man challenged the staff member as he was not wearing a mask himself.</p>

<p>The suspect then punches the shopkeeper twice before fleeing the shop on foot. Allegedly the attack was sparked by the shopkeeper asking the man to put on a face mask</p>

<p>'The man left the store as a result of the verbal altercation and a short time later the suspect has entered the shop and assaulted him.</p>

<p>'There could be other motives for this attack, and we are keeping an open mind as to why the victim was targeted.</p>

<p>'However, we are now asking for your help to trace the person responsible for what appears to be an unprovoked attack.</p>

<p>'This type of violence is completely unacceptable and we are determined to identify them and put them before a criminal court.' </p>
