<p>Dominic captured images of the alleged offender on CCTV and wrote on the website Nextdoor: ‘This bloke just broke into my car. Keep your eye out’</p>

<p>He has played countless aristocrats on screen but velvet-voiced Charles Dance insists he is as common as muck. </p>

<p>The actor, 73, says: ‘My mother was born in London’s East End. She was one of three or four kids and did not have two half pennies to rub together.</p>

<p>'She went into service when she was 13.’</p>

<p>Charles, who has an OBE, added: ‘Because of the way my face is put together, I am often cast aristocratically. There is nothing aristocratic about me whatsoever. I am as common as muck, you know.’</p>
