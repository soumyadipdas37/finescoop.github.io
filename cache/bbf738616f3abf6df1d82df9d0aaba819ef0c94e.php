<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother traveling from Florida to Illinois on Southwest Airlines said she was escorted off her flight because her two-year-old son wasn't wearing mask as he snacked before takeoff.  </p>

<p>Jodi Degyansk and son, Hayes Jarobe, boarded their flight at Southwest Florida International Airport on Saturday with plans to return to their home in Chicago.</p>

<p>The pair had previously flown south to visit family in Naples, and didn't expect to have any issues on their return flight.</p>

<p>Degyansky, 34,  told News Press that the flight attendants on her plane to Florida had been very understanding regarding her son wearing a mask, but that wasn't the case on the trip back.</p>

<p>'On the way back I was surprised the flight attendants were much stricter,' she said. </p>

<p>Jodi Degyansk (right), pictured with her son Hayes Jarobe (left), said they were removed from a Southwest Airlines flight on Saturday over the face mask policy </p>

<p>Degyansky said that after they were in their assigned seats, Hayes took his face mask off to munch on some snacks that were served.  </p>

<p>Like many families, Degyansky has been forced to navigate pandemic-era CDC guidelines that might be difficult for young children, including wearing face masks for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>'We are trying to get used to it, but he's two,' she said. </p>

<p>On more than one occasion, Degyansky said she was confronted by flight attendants who told her that Hayes would need to wear a face masks throughout the flight.</p>

<p>'Flight attendants kept coming over asking if we would wear it the full flight, and I said he would. It definitely was a struggle but something we’re working on,' she told NBC 2. </p>

<p> Degyansky (left) said a flight personnel confronted them repeatedly about her son's face mask, and that she tried to adhere to the airline's guidelines</p>

<p>Degyansky: 'My toddler who literally turned 2 two weeks ago. ... I know you have to draw the line but let's be a little compassionate with everyone's individual circumstances'</p>

<p>She said repeatedly attempted to keep the mask on her son's face and tried to be in accordance with Southwest Airline's flight rules.</p>

<p>After another confrontation with a flight attendant, Degyansky and her son were asked to leave the flight. </p>

<p>'A couple minutes later, we were pulled back into the gate and I was asked to leave the plane accompanied by the manager, the supervisor, the flight attendants, and the pilot,' she said.</p>

<p>CDC guidelines state that any children aged two and up should wear a proper face mask if it's difficult to social distance.</p>

<p>'My toddler who literally turned 2 two weeks ago. ... I know you have to draw the line but let's be a little compassionate with everyone's individual circumstances,' she told News Press.</p>

<p>The flight attendant explained to Degyansky that some parents had used snacking as an excuse to not put face masks on their young children.</p>

<p>But Degyansky said she supports wearing face masks and acknowledged the how it can curb the virus' spread.</p>

<p>The pair eventually flew home on an American Airlines flight that day after paying an additional $600 for a new ticket </p>

<p>Degyansky: 'I want people to either do their homework before they choose to fly or find an airline that has more leniency'</p>

<p>'I'm sure other parents are going through this,' she said. 'I want people to either do their homework before they choose to fly or find an airline that has more leniency.'</p>

<p>Dr. Annette St. Pierre-MacKoul, a pediatrician in Fort Myers, told NBC 2 that she agrees with the CDC recommendations but said compassion should be shown as well.</p>

<p>'Two years old is the youngest they should be wearing masks because under two years of age it can actually be a choking hazard,' she told the publication. </p>

<p>'Between two and three I think it’s really not fair depending on the circumstances of where they were flying and what they were doing.'</p>

<p>Degyansky said it was embarrassing to have the plane return to the gate and be escorted off with flight personnel.</p>

<p>Degyansky (left), pictured with Hayes (right), said Southwest Airlines agreed to refund her the ticket money, but she had not received it as of Sunday</p>

<p>She added that Southwest Airlines offered to find her a flight for later in the day, but none were direct to Chicago. The next direct flight was on Monday.</p>

<p>She booked a flight on Saturday with American Airlines instead, but it came with a $600 charge.</p>

<p>'I just felt like I can't believe it happened. I was left scrambling — how the hell am I going to get home?' said Degyansky. 'What if I didn’t have the resources to buy a $600 ticket?'</p>

<p>She said that Southwest Airlines agreed to refund her the money, but has not done so as of Sunday.</p>

<p>Southwest Airlines sad in a statement that they are investigating the matter, but maintained that their flight policies should be followed as closely as possible.</p>

<p>'If a Customer is unable to wear a face covering for any reason, Southwest regrets that we are unable to transport the individual. In those cases, we will issue a full refund and hope to welcome the Customer onboard in the future, if public health guidance regarding face coverings changes,' a spokesperson told News Press.</p>

<p>'Caring for others with our Southwest Hearts is at the center of everything we do, which is especially important during this pandemic.</p>

<p>'We appreciate the ongoing support and spirit of cooperation among our Customers and Employees as we collectively take care of each other while striving to prevent the spread of COVID-19.'</p>
