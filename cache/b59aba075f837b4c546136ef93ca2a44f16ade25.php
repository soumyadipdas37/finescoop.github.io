<p>The US born world champion is staying in Bali, enjoying stunning views and incredible waves.  </p>

<p>The 48-year-old shared phenomenal videos and pictures of him and fellow pro surfer Betet Merta catching massive waves at Padang-Padang Beach in Uluwatu.</p>

<p>The pair shared incredible footage of themselves riding massive waves on a near empty beach in Bali</p>

<p>At one point the pair were double-barrelling in a wave, almost colliding into each other, as a cameraman captured the amazing footage. </p>

<p>'Double barrel with the king at Padang Padang <?php echo e('@'); ?>kellyslater,' Merta captioned the video.</p>

<p>According to Beach Grit, other people were also enjoying the popular holiday spot despite COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>The publication claims that there is a way to get around the travel ban, a hack that was revealed in a simple WhatsApp message. </p>

<p>The message claims that all tourists have to do is pay $1,700 for a 60 day Indonesian visa and book at least 10 days in Kandui Resort on the Mentawai Islands in Bali. </p>

<p>The individual would also have to return a negative COVID-19 test to ensure the safety of workers and others. </p>

<p>However travellers might struggle to find a flight heading to Bali during the worldwide pandemic. </p>

<p>Despite having low cases of COVID-19, Bali is yet to reopen fully to international arrivals and decided against it due to several travel restrictions from other countries. </p>

<p>Australians are unable to leave the country unless they have an exemption from the government. </p>

<p>Bali's governor said there are still some 'red zone categories' in Indonesia which makes it a bit difficult to reopen the island as well. </p>

<p>The country is also not accepting visas from international tourists until they can ensure all resorts, hotels, cafes, restaurants have a COVID-19 safety plan in place.</p>
