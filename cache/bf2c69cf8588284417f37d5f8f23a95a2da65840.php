<p>My Holly, you've changed: A member of the This Morning crew mistook a sex doll for Holly Willoughby on Tuesday</p>

<p>To which Phil added. jokingly: 'They did and they said, my God did you have a rough night out last night?'</p>

<p>Referring to the doll, Holly asked Phil: 'Have you replaced me already? You’ve upgraded me for a better model!'</p>

<p>Phil was seen laughing with the giant Barbie-like doll, who sat between them on the couch.</p>

<p>The figure was life-sized, blonde and wearing a kimono-style dress. </p>

<p>Not amused: 'A member of the crew, I won’t say who it was, came in this morning and thought it was me sat on the sofa! Shocking!' Holly exclaimed </p>

<p>The interview with the doll woman caused its usual titters among the presenting pair, who grilled her on where one stores a sex toy of such size.</p>

<p>'Where do you put them?' Phil asked. 'Next to the hoover under the stairs?' Holly suggested.</p>

<p>'We have storage boxes,' the lady replied.</p>

<p>'Where do you put that? Where does the storage go?' Phil pushed. </p>

<p>Phil added. jokingly: 'They did and they said, my God did you have a rough night out last night?'</p>

<p>'You can put things on top of the boxes. A lot of people put them in their shower with them!' she replied.</p>

<p>Grimacing at that, Holly added: 'Imagine how freaked out you’d be if you went to that persons houses.'</p>
