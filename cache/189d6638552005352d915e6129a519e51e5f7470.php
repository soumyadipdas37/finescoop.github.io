<p>Thousands of small and family-run businesses will be thrown a lifeline as the Morrison Government prepares to introduce new bankruptcy laws</p>

<p>The reforms, which will be unveiled by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Thursday, will cover around three-quarters of businesses subject to insolvencies</p>

<p>The reforms will draw on key features of the 'Chapter 11' bankruptcy code used in the United States. </p>

<p>Moving from a one-size-fits-all 'creditor in possession' model to a more flexible 'debtor in possession' model will allow eligible small businesses to restructure existing debts while remaining in control of their business.</p>

<p>There will be a period of 20 business days to develop a restructuring plan by a small business restructuring practitioner, followed by 15 business days for creditors to vote on the plan.</p>

<p>Costly administrators will be removed from the process unless the creditors refused to accept a debt restructure.</p>

<p>Josh Frydenberg said the new laws will apply a key feature of the US Chapter 11 laws that allows company directors and owners to maintain control of their business as they seek to restructure and trade out of ­insolvency</p>

<li><p>Moving from a one-size-fits-all 'creditor in possession' model to a more flexible 'debtor in possession' model, allowing eligible small businesses to restructure existing debts while remaining in control of their business</p></li>
<li><p>A period of 20 business days to develop a restructuring plan by a small business restructuring practitioner, followed by 15 business days for creditors to vote on the plan</p></li>
<li><p>A simplified liquidation pathway for small businesses</p></li>
<li><p>Red tape cuts for the insolvency sector. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>A senior government source told The Australian the changes would give small businesses 'a viable pathway out of insolvency without the vultures coming in and picking the eyes out of it'. </p>

<p>The changes follow the extension earlier this month of temporary insolvency and bankruptcy protections to support small businesses impacted by the COVID crisis.</p>

<p>As the temporary relief expires at the end of December, the number of companies being put into external administration is expected to increase.</p>

<p>Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe warned of the wave of business failures in August.</p>

<p>'There will be insolvencies. There will be bankruptcies. There will be some businesses that will not recover. That's the harsh reality of an economic downturn that's the worst in 100 years,' he told parliament's economics committee.</p>

<p>The longer-term reforms are earmarked to start on January 1, subject to parliament passing legislation.</p>

<p>'These are the most significant reforms to Australia's insolvency framework in almost 30 years, and will help to keep more businesses in business and Australians in jobs,' Mr Frydenberg said.</p>

<p>He said the government was also providing support totalling $314 billion to cushion the blow for households and businesses as part of its economic recovery plan.</p>
