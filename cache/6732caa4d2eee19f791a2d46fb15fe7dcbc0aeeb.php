<p>She did it again! Jennifer Lopez teased new music again by posing alongside famed producer Ryan Tedder in a social media post on Saturday</p>

<p>In one of the snaps, JLo flashed a sassy look by puckering up her lips dressed in a black tank top.</p>

<p>Her blonde-brown tresses were teased back in a messy style, a la 1980s Madonna, as some strands of hair fell in front of her eyes.</p>

<p>There's another selfie that looks nearly identical, with the exception that Lopez traded her pucker for a big beaming smile.</p>

<p>Tedder maintained his own pucker in both pictures, along with bulging eyes, while wearing a black sweatsuit jacket and black baseball cap. </p>

<p>'Omg omg omg omg!!! Love it,' one follower wrote, while many others wrote simple but excited comments like, 'Can't Wait For New Music' and 'YASSSS QUEEN.'  </p>

<p>Another fans wrote: 'Okkkkk I am very very readdddy,' as some people took their need for new music a little farther.   </p>

<p>'Jen stop playing with us. It's been forever and I still don't have a Spanish album,' one commenter shared, while another posted, 'You're playing with our emotions.' </p>
