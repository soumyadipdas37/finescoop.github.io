<p>Robert Brooks, 50, was behind the largest-ever drugs conspiracy investigation launched by the Easter Region Special Operations Unit, St Albans Crown Court heard. </p>

<p>But in August of last year detectives, having gathered the intelligence they needed, were ready to move against Brooks and his associates.</p>

<p>That month the network's last two deliveries were intercepted with 45 kilos of heroin and 70 kilos of cocaine being seized.</p>

<p>Taking into account the 39 deliveries detectives knew about, it was assessed that 1,835 kilos of Class A drugs had been imported with a total value was between £42million and £58million.</p>

<p>The drugs would come into the country from Europe hidden in lorries hidden under the bottom of consignments of worthless goods. </p>

<p>One such load was a shipment of spider catcher devices that were of such little value they were thrown away in a skip.</p>

<p>On arrival at the farm the drugs would be unloaded by a fork lift truck into sheds and barns that had been rented out at the farm.</p>

<p>From there a courier drove with the class A drugs to the north of England.</p>

<p>The court heard the crime network was connected to Europe and much further afield. </p>

<p>Brooks pleaded guilty to conspiracy to fraudulently evade the prohibition on the importation of a Class A drugs and possession of criminal property between November 2018 and August 2019. </p>
