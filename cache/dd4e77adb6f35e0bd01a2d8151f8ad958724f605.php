<p>In an interview with GQ Australia in May, Chris admitted that the older his children get, the 'harder' he finds it to be away from them for work.</p>

<p>'For a little while you don't think the kids notice and then you realise they do,' he said.</p>

<p>He explained that he often finds himself torn between wanting to make movies he's 'proud of' and being at home with his family.</p>

<p>'You can fall into a false sense of self-importance on a film set, where you feel you're special, so it's good to remind yourself that it's not that case. And kids certainly drive that home,' he added. </p>

<p>In a separate interview with the same publication in 2018, Chris admitted that he struggled to understand how his sons can be 'so different' despite being twins. </p>

<p>'Tristan is so athletic but there's not an aggressive bone in his body. He's the most emotional one. Whereas Sasha is like a little gangster,' he said at the time.</p>
