<p>Fledgling superstars: Kim Kardashian shared an epic throwback photo of herself with her sisters Khloe, Kylie, and Kendall Jenner on Friday </p>

<p>'Babies,' Kim, 39, captioned the snap.  </p>

<p>Pre-teen Kylie rocked a side-swept bang and allowed her freckles to shine through with hardly a touch of makeup on her face.</p>

<p>Kim still looked glam as she sat at the center of the table, with her honey-hued locks perfectly sleeked to the side.  </p>

<p>Kendall flashed a sweet smile as she posed in the back, years before becoming a superstar in the world of modeling. </p>

<p>It's Kim! Kim has returned to her natural black hair after sporting blonde locks in 2009</p>

<p>Throwback: Khloe Kardashian has remained a fan of the long, loose waves over the years</p>

<p>Khloe, meanwhile, was styled up with a berry pink lip and head full of loose waves. </p>

<p>She sat before a sleek silver camera - a rarity nowadays in the era of iPhones.</p>

<p>At the time the photos were taken, the women were all just beginning to take the world of reality TV by storm with their E! series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which debuted in 2007. </p>

<p>Little did the world know then just how their careers would take off. </p>
