<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Alisson Becker has praised fellow Brazilian Fabinho for his 'unbelievable' display against Chelsea on Sunday. </p>

<p>With Joe Gomez and Joel Matip unavailable, defensive midfielder Fabinho sat in at centre back and played superbly, nullifying Timo Werner and guiding the Reds to a clean sheet during the 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>And compatriot Alisson, who saved a second-half penalty from Jorginho to preserve the Reds' two-goal lead, was complimentary of Fabinho's performance, speaking to the official club website. </p>

<p>Fabinho filled in at centre half for Liverpool against Chelsea and was named man of the match</p>

<p>Fellow Brazilian Alisson Becker was full of praise for his countryman after his performance</p>

<p>'He [Fabinho] was a monster! Unbelievable, but it's what I expect of him,' Alisson said. </p>

<p>'If it's a surprise for you I would be surprised, because he is a top player. </p>

<p>'Anywhere he played, from number six or centre back, he always does his best and his quality permits him to play in different positions.</p>

<p>'He's a really smart player on movements and also one-v-ones. That was needed against [Timo] Werner, against [Kai] Havertz and the other players with really good quality, so I congratulate him as he was in my opinion man of the match.' </p>

<p>Fabinho dealt admirably with Chelsea's attacking threats in the Premier League on Sunday</p>

<p>The victory on Sunday also saw £20m signing Thiago Alcantara make his debut, following his move from Bayern Munich last week. </p>

<p>Yet it was Thiago who fouled Werner in the box to hand Chelsea a lifeline - but the usually dependable Jorginho could not outfox Alisson from the spot. </p>

<p>'I'm really happy because in the Community Shield we lost on penalties,' Alisson explained. </p>

<p>'When the goalie doesn't save any penalties you stay a little bit down and then you think, "I could do more, I could do it differently."</p>

<p>Alisson's save from Jorginho's penalty preserved Liverpool's clean sheet at Stamford Bridge </p>

<p>'But the secret is to keep on going, to know that you are in a good direction, in the right direction, working hard and we did it together – me, John [Achterberg], Jack [Robinson], and all the video team who help us a lot.</p>

<p>'Also with the rebound, Millie [James Milner] and Virg [van Dijk] did really well and I think they showed confidence in me that I would save the penalty.'</p>

<p>Both Brazilians could be rested for Liverpool's next game - a Carabao Cup third round clash at Lincoln on Thursday.  </p>
