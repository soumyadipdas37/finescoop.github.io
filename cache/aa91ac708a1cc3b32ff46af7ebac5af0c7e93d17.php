<p>The Melbourne Demons player left his club's bubble in Maroochydore on Saturday and visited 'unapproved premises', the league confirmed on Sunday.</p>

<p>Bennell, 27, was suspended for four games, to be served in 2021, while the Demons were fined $50,000. </p>

<p>Melbourne CEO Gary Pert said Bennell's actions were selfish and a 'clear breach' of the AFL's COVID-19 protocols.  </p>

<p>'He has made a very poor decision, which is incredibly disappointing,' Pert said.</p>

<p>'He has not only put himself, his teammates and the competition at risk, but he has failed to live up to the values of the Melbourne Football Club.'</p>

<p>Pert apologised for the midfielder's behaviour and said the club accepted the $50,000 fine. </p>

<p>Upon learning of a potential breach, the Demons immediately notified the AFL, which investigated the matter. </p>

<p>AFL General Counsel Andrew Dillon said the AFL's protocols are the competition's license to play and anyone breaching them will be held to account.</p>

<p>'Harley knew the rules and could have put his club and the competition at risk on the eve of a finals campaign,' Dillon said.</p>

<p>Bennell wasn't allowed back into the player bubble after the breach and will remain in isolation until he can leave Queensland. </p>

<p>It was the Melbourne Demons second COVID-19 breach this year after forwards Kysaiah 'Kozzy' Pickett and Charlie Spargo used an Uber to visit a social gathering in June.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two senior players came under fire on Saturday after television cameras caught them groping each other's buttocks during a team huddle.  </p>

<p>Christian Petracca and Jayden Hunt apologised for the incident before Demons captain Max Gawn condemned the pair's behaviour. </p>

<p>'As AFL players, we are role models and have a responsibility to showcase the right behaviours to the wider AFL community,' Gawn said.</p>

<p>'Christian and Jayden know that this was an inappropriate act, which is not in line with our expectations, or that of the league.</p>

<p>'As a playing group, we understand and respect the example we need to be setting, and will continue to reinforce this going forward.'</p>
