<p>'I’m really excited because 2021 is happening in whatever format it’s going to be in,' she confirmed. 'That will be 15 years we’ve been going - and I’ve been there for all of them!</p>

<p>No stopping them: Amanda Holden has confirmed that COVID-19 won't put a stop to Britain's Got Talent's return in 2021 - which will be the show's 15th season</p>

<p>'So hopefully, there’ll be a party!'</p>

<p>She added: 'I also turn 50 next year, so I’m expecting a joint birthday! In fact, as a present I think I should be able to press all the golden buzzers!'</p>

<p>Amanda and her co-judges - Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon - returned to screens this weekend for the first time since the pandemic put a stop to production on the current series.</p>

<p>The show resumes over September and October after a lengthy wait, with social distancing now in place and no studio audience.</p>

<p>Golden girl! The show's veteran judge, 49, has also pointed out that she turns 50 next year - and has laid out her ideas for a joint celebration</p>

<p>Show vet! 'I’m really excited because 2021 is happening in whatever format it’s going to be in,' she confirmed. 'That will be 15 years we’ve been going - and I’ve been there for all of them!'</p>

<p>The Kiss Me Kate actress said: 'Being a meter apart will be annoying because we’re a very emotive judging panel and we hug one another if an act has been particularly emotional and set one of us off crying.</p>

<p>'It’s going to feel very odd explaining to all our kids that they can’t come and hang out backstage.'</p>

<p>The semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. The final will then take place live in October.</p>

<p>As usual, Ant and Dec will host, and Ashley Banjo will replace Simon at the judges’ desk, after the head judge broke his back in LA three weeks ago during a bike accident.</p>

<p>Buzzed! 'I also turn 50 next year, so I’m expecting a joint birthday! In fact, as a present I think I should be able to press all the golden buzzers!' she added</p>

<p>A team! Amanda and her co-judges - Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon - returned to screens this weekend for the first time since the pandemic put a stop to production on the current series</p>

<p>Of recruiting Ashley, Simon said: 'Ashley will be a fantastic addition to the panel. He knows the power of the show; and the responsibility of it.</p>

<p>'I couldn’t think of a better person to sit in my seat whilst I follow doctor’s orders. I hate that stupid bike!'</p>

<p>Simon underwent emergency surgery in America after the accident in Los Angeles, but remains positive, praising his BGT team.</p>

<p>'The safety of everyone is more important. We’re going to have to rehearse acts in a completely different way. But everyone’s been up for it, the contestants, the crew and the whole team, it’s been amazing to see everyone come together and work so hard to get Britain’s Got Talent back on air.'</p>

<p>Ashley said of his new role: 'As if 2020 couldn’t get any crazier! It’s super humbling and super exciting!</p>

<p>They're back: The show resumes over September and October after a lengthy wait, with social distancing now in place and no studio audience</p>

<p>The Kiss Me Kate actress said: 'Being a meter apart will be annoying because we’re a very emotive judging panel and we hug one another if an act has been particularly emotional and set one of us off crying'</p>

<p>'I remember being on that stage last year and talking about how it’s been ten years since we won, and how people should never tell you, you can’t do something.</p>

<p>'Walking on that stage as a 20-year-old street dancer from the streets of East London and now I am walking out there and stepping in for the big man! It feels really nice, almost poetic.'</p>

<p>Ashley and his dance troupe Diversity famously beat off favourite Susan Boyle to win Britain’s Got Talent in 2009 in front of a TV audience of more than 20 million people. </p>

<p>Since then, Ashley’s career has gone from strength to strength - both performing and choreographing Diversity around the world and selling out nine UK tours, selling over 800,00 tickets in the process, as well as appearing as a judge on Got To Dance (Sky1), Dance, Dance, Dance (ITV) and Dancing On Ice (ITV) and presenting both Can’t Touch This (BBC) and Flirty Dancing (Channel 4). </p>

<p>She added: 'It’s going to feel very odd explaining to all our kids that they can’t come and hang out backstage'</p>

<p>Standing in: Former BGT winner Ashley Banjo will sit in for injured Simon</p>

<p>Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs.</p>

<p>With safety concerns paramount, some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences’ reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen.</p>

<p>The series will then culminate with the live final, in October, where one act will triumph as Britain’s Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance.</p>
