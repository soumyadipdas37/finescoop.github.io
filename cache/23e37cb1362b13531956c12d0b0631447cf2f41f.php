<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump asserted during the first presidential debate Tuesday that he paid millions of dollars in federal income tax as he defended himself against reports that he only paid $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>'I paid millions of dollars in taxes. Millions of dollars of income tax,' Trump told debate moderator Chris Wallace.</p>

<p>'And, let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers –' Trump continued.</p>

<p>He was cut off with Democratic candidate Joe Biden shouting, 'Show us your tax returns.'</p>

<p>'I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year. I went –' the president said, but was interrupted again by Biden.</p>

<p>'Show us your tax returns,' the former vice president insisted.</p>

<p>'You'll see it as soon as it's finished. You'll see it,' Trump said.</p>

<p>'Oh,' Biden sarcastically conceded.</p>

<p>The two candidates immediately clashed as they met on stage in Cleveland, Ohio Tuesday night for the first of three presidential debates.</p>

<p>Donald Trump insisted Tuesday during the first presidential debate that he has paid millions in federal income taxes</p>

<p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden challenged Trump to prove it by releasing his tax returns</p>

<p>The first debate moderator, Fox News' Chris Wallace, was forced to ask Trump about his taxes after The New York Times released a report Sunday indicating Trump only paid $750 in both 2016 and 2017</p>

<p>Fox News' Chris Wallace had to bring up questions over Trump's taxes after a New York Times released a report this week with sources claiming the president only paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he ran for president and first year he served in office.</p>

<p>Biden claimed Trump was able to pay so little because he 'took advantage' of the tax code.</p>

<p>'The tax code that made him – put him in a position that he pays less tax than a school teacher makes – on the money a school teacher makes is because of him taking – he says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code,' Biden said.</p>

<p>'That's why I'm going to eliminate the tax cuts,' he continued.</p>

<p>'Good. That's OK,' Trump said.</p>

<p>Wallace questioned Trump: 'Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?'</p>

<p>'Millions of dollars,' Trump said.</p>

<p>'You paid millions of dollars? So not $750?' Wallace clarified.</p>

<p>'And you'll get to see it,' the president affirmed.</p>

<p>'When?' Biden interjected.</p>

<p>Trump said Sunday, the same day the Times report was released, that he will release his tax returns after an audit is completed.</p>

<p>Tax returns were also an issue in 2016, when Trump refused to release them – a precedent set by previous presidential candidates but not required by law for an individual to run for office.</p>

<p>Just hours before taking the stage in the battleground rust belt state Tuesday, Biden and his vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris released their tax returns.</p>

<p>The Democratic candidate's taxes showed that he and his wife Dr. Jill Biden paid more than $346,204 in federal taxes and other payments for 2019 on an income of $944,737. The couple sought a refund of nearly $47,000, which brought their total tax bill for the year to $299,346.</p>

<p>Taxes for Biden's running mate and her husband, Doug Emhoff, a lawyer who has taken leave from his position as a partner with the firm DLA Piper, were also released Tuesday.</p>

<p>On an income of $3,018,127, they paid $1.2 million in taxes, which is three times the presidential salary.</p>

<p>Joe Biden released his and running mate Kamala Harris' latest tax returns ahead of debate Tuesday with records showing he and wife Jill paid more than $346,000 in 2019 on an income of nearly $985,000 and sought a refund of nearly $47,000</p>

<p>Trump suggested while facing off with Biden – and at times sparring with Wallace over speaking time – that he was able to lessen his tax burden by using legal measures he claims were passed by the Obama administration.</p>

<p>'Let me just tell you, it was the tax laws,' Trump said, admitting: 'I don't want to pay tax.'</p>

<p>'Before I came here I was a private developer, I was a private businesspeople,' he continued. 'Like every other private person, unless their stupid, they go through the laws and that's what it is.'</p>

<p>Then pointing to Biden on the opposite side of the stage, Trump added, 'He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for a tax credits – we built a building and we get tax credits.'</p>

<p>The Times report, based on information from anonymous sources, claims documents prove Trump did not pay income tax in 11 of the 18 years studied.</p>

<p>He was able to minimize his tax bill by reporting heavy losses across his business empire, including at his golf courses, according to the sources.</p>

<p>The president could face mounting financial pressure in the years ahead as tax records show he's carrying a total of $421 million in loans and debt that are primarily due within four years.</p>

<p>Trump has released any documentation to back up his claims that he has paid millions in taxes.</p>

<p>After the report dropped the Biden campaign was quick to rush out an ad showing the average American pays $12,199 in yearly taxes.</p>
