<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rambling. Wildly incoherent. Those beardy weirdies from Extinction Rebellion were out in Parliament Square again yesterday, subjecting all of us to hours of indecipherable gibberish. </p>

<p>Despite being supposedly educated, they’re a decidedly inarticulate rabble. Their speakers were about as stirring as the cider-fuelled Morris dancers at my local summer fete. </p>

<p>Mind you, things were no more inspiring inside the Commons, where MPs were returning from their summer hols. </p>

<p>Following weeks of lip-chewing ineptitude, that prize bungler Gavin Williamson was treating us to a statement on schools. </p>

<p>Yes, he’s still in his job. Amazing isn’t it? Perhaps he knows something about Boris that we don’t. </p>

<p> Those beardy weirdies from Extinction Rebellion were out in Parliament Square again yesterday, subjecting all of us to hours of indecipherable gibberish.</p>

<p>If so, all I can say is that it must be dynamite. The Education Secretary arrived in the chamber at 4.42pm, collapsing into his seat in an awkwardly arranged pile of limbs. </p>

<p>His face bore the anxious look of a child outside the head master’s study, awaiting an inevitable rollicking. </p>

<p>Over on the SNP benches, Pete Wishart (Perth and N Perthshire) and Patrick Grady (Glasgow N) pointed and giggled excitedly. </p>

<p>Williamson kicked off by regurgitating the whole A-levels fiasco. </p>

<p>He was ‘deeply sorry’ for what students had gone through last month. Once again, he seemed happy to lay the blame at Ofqual’s door. </p>

<p>Though that didn’t prevent him offering a short, nakedly insincere tribute to the education quango’s departing chief Sally Collier. </p>

<p>Gavin Williamson arrived in the chamber at 4.42pm, collapsing into his seat in an awkwardly arranged pile of limbs</p>

<p>That clothes peg-over-the-nose drawl of Williamson’s really is quite a thing. It could zap energy from the Large Hadron Collider.</p>

<p>Barely 30 seconds into his statement, faces around the chamber were already beginning to droop. It was as if someone had just flicked on a two-bar heater at Madame Tussauds. </p>

<p>Opposition benches were predictably unimpressed. Labour’s shadow education secretary Kate Green, in snazzy zebra stripes, was furious she’d only received a copy of Williamson’s statement several minutes before. </p>

<p>Not sure why. Others might have been grateful at being spared having to read it. </p>

<p>She accused Williamson of overseeing a summer of ‘chaos, incompetence and confusion’. </p>

<p>The SNP’s Carol Monaghan was also snippy about getting her copy of the statement so late. ‘I almost had time to read it,’ she deadpanned. </p>

<p>Lucy Powell (Lab, Manchester C) accused Williamson of ‘worse than incompetence’, he ‘couldn’t just wash his hands of responsibility’ for these farcical past weeks. </p>

<p>Williamson stood there sopping it all up, as best he could, delivering his usual jargonistic, nonsensical answers. </p>

<p>Occasionally he would rest his entire body weight against the dispatch box to feign nonchalance. </p>

<p>You do wonder how many more of these sessions he can endure. Compare his demeanour to Matt Hancock, who had earlier updated the House on the Government’s Covid-19 strategy. </p>

<p>Unlike Williamson, the tribulations of high office have no bearing on the Health Secretary’s wellbeing. </p>

<p>Extinction Rebellion's speakers in Parliament Square were about as stirring as the cider-fuelled Morris dancers at Henry Deedes' local summer fete - and things were no more exciting in the Commons</p>

<p>Not even a poorly received interview over the weekend, in which he needlessly blathered on about a second lockdown, seems to have zapped his enthusiasm. </p>

<p>Yesterday he was zestier and zingier than a pitcher of Aperol spritz. What a clever boy Matt had been: numbers being admitted to hospital were down, patients requiring ventilators were down and the latest coronavirus deaths stood at just two. </p>

<p>The track and trace system is supposedly whizz-bang (I’m not sure it is). </p>

<p>His predecessor Jeremy Hunt, who now chairs the Health Select Committee, congratulated him on his ‘impressive progress’. </p>

<p>Jim Shannon (DUP, Strangford) announced he had ‘not been found wanting’ during the crisis. </p>

<p>Even Hancock’s opposite number, Jon Ashworth, gave him an easy ride. </p>

<p>The only sharp surprise he got came from his own side, when Sir Edward Leigh (Con, Gainsborough) demanded the Government ‘get back to being a proper Conservative government’ and stop with all the nannyish restrictions. </p>

<p>Sir Edward complained that ‘the man in Whitehall doesn’t know best. Especially as he changes his mind every two minutes’. </p>

<p>Hancock endured two hours at the despatch box since he also had to host a session of departmental questions.</p>

<p>He looked like he could have happily stayed in the chamber right until suppertime. </p>

<p>His colleague in the Department for Education, by contrast, could not have bolted out of there fast enough </p>
