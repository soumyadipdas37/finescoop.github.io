<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Juventus are 'growing pessimistic over completing a deal for Luis Suarez' due to issues with the Uruguayan securing Italian citizenship. </p>

<p>The Turin club are at their maximum allotment of foreign players in the squad, which means Suarez has to obtain an Italian passport. </p>

<p>The process is a slow one and Juventus are increasingly concerned that the red tape will take up too much time. </p>

<p>Juventus need Luis Suarez to obtain an Italian passport if he is to complete a move to Turin</p>

<p>According to Goal, they are pessimistic about the deal being concluded, despite the fact that personal terms on a £9million-a-year deal have been concluded. </p>

<p>Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman has no place for Suarez in his side but a fee has not yet been agreed between both clubs.  </p>

<p>Juventus begin the defence of their crown on Sunday against Sampdoria and Pirlo is understood to be considering alternatives to Suarez. </p>

<p>Gonzalo Higuain's contract was terminated so the club are eager to arrange their striking options as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Andrea Pirlo is increasingly pessimistic about the chances of the Uruguayan joining </p>

<p>Suarez wants to leave Barcelona and Ronald Koeman has told him he is not in his plans </p>

<p>The situation with Suarez's passport application is a hindrance in this regard and Edin Dzeko might well join in the coming days. </p>

<p>His move from Roma is dependent on the capital club signing Napoli frontman Arkadiusz Milik. </p>

<p>Pirlo reiterated the urgency of signing a new forward over the weekend, saying: 'I need a striker as soon as possible. But the market is long. There will be time to be able to work until October 4.'</p>

<p>Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud has also been linked but dismissed that speculation last week. </p>

<p>Suarez remains of huge interest to Juventus but it seems bureaucracy may yet scupper his favoured move and prevent him teaming up with Cristiano Ronaldo in an all-star attack next season. </p>

<p>Edin Dzeko is another target and if he joins from Roma then the Suarez deal could be dead</p>
