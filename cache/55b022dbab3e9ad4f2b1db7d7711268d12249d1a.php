<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arjen Robben scored his first goal for Eredivisie club Groningen since coming out of retirement earlier this year.</p>

<p>Robben left Bayern Munich in 2019 and entered retirement after a stellar 10-year career that saw him win the Bundesliga title and DFB-Pokal double in his final season.</p>

<p>However, after a change of heart the former Netherlands international decided to make a sentimental return to the club where he started his career and subsequently scored in their preseason friendly.</p>

<p>Arjen Robben scored his first goal for Groningen since coming out of retirement this year</p>

<p>The 36-year-old found the net during Groningen's friendly against Arminia Bielefeld on Sunday afternoon after he pulled on the green and white shirt for the first time since April 28, 2002. </p>

<p>Robben slotted the ball past Arminia's goalkeeper with a low left footed strike from outside the box within the first 16 minutes of the game.  </p>

<p>Robben was, however, expected to make his debut against PEC Zwolle last month but decided to continue to develop his fitness in training before making a full return. </p>

<p>Robben slotted one home for the Eredivisie club in the 16th minute with his left foot</p>

<p>It was the first time Robben has worn his boyhood club's match kit since April 28, 2002</p>

<p>He told Groningen's official site at the time: 'I want to get even fitter before I start competitions. I had a very good training week, where I was able to do things to 100per cent.</p>

<p>'I'm really in a good position, but playing a match is completely different to training. After not having played football for a year, it is logical that you will experience some complaints.' </p>

<p>Prior to his retirement, the former Real Madrid and Chelsea winger won La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup, as well as two Premier League crowns over three seasons. </p>
