<p>The confronting footage was captured by mother-of-four Julie Hollis while her family were out on their daily walk around Footscray, west of Melbourne's CBD.  </p>

<p>Her daughter Elsie, five, was stopped mid-ride as Victoria Police officers checked identification to make sure the family were within 5km of their home. </p>

<p>A Melbourne family-of-six (Elsie Hollis, Mark Hollis, Wilbur Hollis and Edmund Hollis pictured left to right) were stopped by Victoria Police officers on their daily walk </p>

<p>Victoria Police officers stopped the Hollis family (Mr Hollis and daughter Elsie pictured) at a park in Footscray, west of Melbourne CBD, to make sure they were following coronavirus rules</p>

<p>'We drove down to Footscray park to go for a walk and scooter ride with the kids. It wasn’t scary as we knew police had been in the area.</p>

<p>'We were kind of expecting we may be asked. But as we knew we were within our 5km we were okay about it,' Mrs Hollis told Daily Mail Australia.    </p>

<p>Melburnians are battling through their tenth week of strict stay-at-home coronavirus measures and are only permitted to exercise for one hour per day. </p>

<p>Mrs Hollis, her husband Mark Hollis, and kids Leo, 13, Wilbur, 9, Edmund, 5, and Elsie often visit the park to get out of their house. </p>

<p>'The police officers we dealt with were really friendly and respectful during the process. </p>

<p>'Our oldest two boys were a bit nervous about it and asked questions but the little ones just wanted to know what they were asking,' Mrs Hollis explained.   </p>

<p>The mum and husband, who supply medical staff at festivals, have only been asked for their identification one time.    </p>

<p>Victoria Police officers and Australian Defence Force personnel conduct regular patrols throughout Melbourne to ensure restrictions are being followed.   </p>

<p>'It’s crazy, we can only leave the house for four reasons,' Mrs Hollis said.  </p>

<p>Melbourne is currently under a strict stage 4 coronavirus lockdown. The Hollis family have been keeping busy with bike rides, baking (Elsie and Edmund pictured) and online school </p>

<p>Melburnians are only permitted to leave home for one of four essential reasons including exercise, shopping and providing care (Hollis family playing Jenga at home pictured) </p>

<p>Victoria Police (pictured  on Bourke Street on Thursday) conduct regular patrols through Melbourne to ensure residents are adhering to coronavirus restrictions</p>

<p>These essential reasons include exercise, providing or receiving care, one household member going shopping and work.</p>

<p>Melburnians are also under a strict curfew and must stay inside between 8pm and 5am every night. </p>

<p>Individuals who fail to self-isolate or follow coronavirus laws can be hit with a $1,652 on-the-spot fine. </p>

<p>It is also mandatory for all Victorians to wear a face covering in public unless they are exercising or have a valid medical condition.     </p>

<p>Mrs Hollis said her family were 'all over' the harsh restrictions. </p>

<p>'Especially the kids not being able to do face to face school with their teachers. </p>

<p>'The younger ones all go to a catholic school and every morning in prayer at least one little prep kid says “I pray for coronavirus to go away so we can go back to school.” </p>

<p>Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is expected to announce a roadmap out of Victoria's current COVID-19 restrictions on Sunday (Leo and Elsie pictured making pasta at home) </p>

<p>'They all miss their friends and the playgrounds,' the mother-of-four said. </p>

<p>Mrs Hollis said the family spent lots of time together to pass the long hours at home.   </p>

<p>'We mostly play games, take the dog for a walk, bike rides, scooter rides, play iPads, playstation and watch movies,' she explained.   </p>

<p>Victorian premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Melbourne's Stage Four restrictions.</p>

<p>‘Everything is on the table,’ he admitted. ‘It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.’ </p>

<p>He is preparing to announce the government's plan for a pathway out of the current lockdown on Sunday and will release separate roadmaps for Melbourne and regional Victoria.   </p>

<p>Victoria announced 113 new cases and 15 additional deaths on Thursday, marking a second day of an increase in cases. </p>
