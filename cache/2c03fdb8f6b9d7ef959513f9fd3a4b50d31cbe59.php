<p>She replied: 'Not really, I don't wanna be rude in front of Peggy [Pete's dog], but you were a bit of an a***hole.</p>

<p>'Towards the end of our friendship I felt like you started dismissing my feelings and … are you going to look at me or are you going to look at the bush?</p>

<p>'I feel like you were dismissing how I felt a lot, I've confided in you, I've told you everything and told you all my secrets... and I know I'm a lot.</p>

<p>'I know I can be clingy and I can be jealous that is who I am, so if you don't like those things then we can't be friends cause I'm not going to change, I am who I am.'</p>

<p>Pete then tried to interject, telling Chloe to 'hold on, hold on', but to no avail as she continued to explain how she was feeling.</p>

<p>Pete then asked his former close pal, 'so why didn't ya?' with Chloe replying that she 'didn't know if you would be there even if I did reach out'.</p>

<p>During the interaction Pete appeared to be concentrating hard on what Chloe had to say about what went wrong between them.</p>

<p>Despite finally chatting about what the problem is, the pair did not reveal why they had fallen out in the first place in the clip.</p>

<p>Making up: Chloe and Pete are rebuilding their friendship after they went eight months without speaking </p>

<p>Pose: Frankie opted for an eye-catching black jumpsuit and added height to her frame with a pair of matching boots </p>

<p>Drama: The outing comes after Chloe and Pete finally had their first chat in eight months on Sunday's episode of TOWIE </p>

<p>In the previous week's episode, Chloe said of their feud: 'Me and Pete stopped speaking. We had a falling out since the end of January. It wasn't nasty, it was quite calm but I didn't want to have people around me who aren't 100%. I just said, "I can't have you in my life anymore."'</p>

<p>Later in the episode, Olivia Attwood met with Pete and took the opportunity to hear his side of the story.</p>

<p>Recalling their falling out, he said: 'We had a barney and the last thing she said to me was we didn't need to talk so, so be it.</p>

<p>Argument: Things got a little heated as Chloe aired her grievances and explained to Pete why she has been unhappy with their friendship, saying he had 'dismissed' her feelings</p>

<p>'We've been close for so many years and this was the first time we've disagreed and I've thought, 'you know what she doesn't want me in her life.' It's the longest we've ever gone without talking.'</p>

<p>Pete admitted he would like to patch things up with Chloe but he worries that their friendship was beyond repair.</p>

<p>He said: 'What does worry me, if I do reach out to her and she says f**k off, it'll hurt me. Do I want to save the friendship? Of course I do. Do I think it can be saved? No.'</p>

<p>Glamour: Frankie styled her blonde locks into loose waves for the day of filming </p>
