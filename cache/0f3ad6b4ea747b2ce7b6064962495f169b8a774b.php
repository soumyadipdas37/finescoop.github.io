<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Bronx man has been charged with criminal mischief after metal clamps were thrown on to New York subway tracks, causing a train to derail leaving injuring three people.  </p>

<p>Demetrius Harvard, 30, from the Bronx, was arrested immediately after the uptown A train was forced from the tracks as it arrived at Manhattan's 14th St - Eighth Avenue station.</p>

<p>The train pulled into the station at 8:17 am, and hit metal clamps which had been placed on the rails. </p>

<p>Police believe the suspect found a pile of tie plates, which are normally used to secure the train tracks to the foundations, on a pile of construction materials at the 14th St. station.</p>

<p>Harvard allegedly tried twice to throw the plates onto the tracks, sources told the New York Post. </p>

<p>Demetrius Harvard, 30, from the Bronx, was arrested in connection with Sunday's incident</p>

<p>Harvard was immediately taken into custody by transit police in New York City </p>

<p>Harvard has been charged with reckless endangerment, criminal mischief, assault and criminal trespass</p>

<p>The first time the debris was thrown onto the tracks, a good Samaritan went down and retrieved them, the Post reports.</p>

<p>But Harvard allegedly put the plates on the tracks a second time, just before the train came into the station. </p>

<p>When the train pulled in, three of the subway cars derailed - and Harvard was allegedly seen laughing as the train swerved.</p>

<p>'The investigation revealed that a 30-year-old male was seen throwing construction debris onto the northbound A-Train track which caused the first car on a subway train to derail upon entering the station,' NYPD said in a statement. </p>

<p>Harvard has been charged with reckless endangerment, criminal mischief, assault and criminal trespass. </p>

<p>Harvard was previously arrested on September 5 on charges of criminal mischief after allegedly hurling a metal bench through a bus window, according to the Post. </p>

<p>The uptown A train derailed in the West Village on Sunday morning</p>

<p>Subway service in Manhattan was severely impacted by the Sunday morning crash</p>

<p>About 30 people were evacuated from the train, and they helped detain Harvard - who was allegedly spotted celebrating his accomplishment. </p>

<p>Three passengers suffered minor injuries. </p>

<p>One refused medical attention. Another was treated at the scene while the third was taken to Bellevue Hospital for further treatment, officials said. </p>

<p>The wheels on one of the derailed train cars were destroyed in the crash, and a third rail in the station collapsed upon impact, knocking out power to all four tracks in the station. Other rails were also badly damaged. </p>

<p>The power outage affected other trains on the line, with an A train becoming stuck in a tunnel beneath 34th Street.</p>

<p>All uptown A, C, D, E and F trains were being rerouted, causing extensive delays in Manhattan. </p>

<p>Emergency services had to rescue people trapped in a tunnel beneath 34th Street</p>

<p>Several subway lines passing through Manhattan were thrown into chaos by the crash</p>
