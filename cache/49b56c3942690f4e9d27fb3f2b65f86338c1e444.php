<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Trans-Tasman bubble with New Zealand is back on with flights set to take off within weeks.</p>

<p>Travellers will be allowed to fly in from New Zealand into New South Wales without quarantining.</p>

<p>It's understood the federal government will initially only permit New Zealand residents to fly in.</p>

<p>NSW residents would then be allowed to travel across the Tasman by Christmas, The Sunday Telegraph reported. </p>

<p>It comes after Trade Minister Simon Birmingham expressed his hopes for a travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand by the end of the year.</p>

<p>But he says "first and foremost" Australian states must open up to one another as great progress is being made. </p>

<p>Senator Birmingham said opening up an international border with New Zealand would be a "great step" and work is being done to make sure this can be done in a safe way.</p>

<p>"We're making sure we have all the work done, all the preparations there so that we can safely achieve that bubble with New Zealand," the minster told ABC News Weekend Breakfast.</p>

<p>"It's up to them as to whether they choose to open up to Australia, but we're certainly making sure that we're prepared and I'm hopeful that could be this year."</p>

<p>More to come </p>
