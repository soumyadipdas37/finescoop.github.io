<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Queenslanders are stepping outdoors into a sunny new reality with the state on the cusp of being COVID-19 free.  </p>

<p>Only three new coronavirus cases were reported on Saturday after three consecutive days of zero new infections.</p>

<p>The low figures have prompted health authorities to ease restrictions on gatherings in the Gold Coast and West Morton government areas.  </p>

<p>Residents can now gather in groups of 30 and also visit aged care centres. </p>

<p>Queenslanders seemed to immediately enjoy their newfound freedom and have spent their days outdoors and sipping cocktails at bars.</p>

<p>Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young has even encouraged Queenslanders to get outdoors, and open the windows of their homes. </p>

<p>'Try not to shut yourselves in with air conditioning, remembering of course that we also need people to be cool,' Dr Young said.</p>

<p>'But wherever possible I strongly recommend that people move their lives, as much as possible, outdoors.' </p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has also promised more restrictions will be eased from October 1. </p>

<p>Restaurants will be allowed to seat one person every two squared metres instead of every four squared metres.</p>

<p>Stadium capacities will be increased from 50 to 75 per cent.</p>

<p>Outdoor school and sporting events will also be capped at 1,000 people, up from 500.</p>

<p>More people will also be allowed to visit theme parks and zoos at one time.  </p>

<p>'We are able to do this because Queenslanders have done such a great job… now we can help the economy recover more,' Ms Palaszczuk said. </p>

<p>The new found freedoms come five weeks after a new virus outbreak began at a Brisbane Youth Detention Centre, which peaked at 55 cases. </p>

<p>The Queensland and New South Wales border could also remained closed as a new locally acquired COVID-19 case was recorded in Sydney.  </p>

<p>The new case comes as NSW reached reached 17 days of the 28 days required for a border to reopen.</p>

<p>The potential setback comes as Ms Palaszczuk urged the federal government not to withdraw the Australian troops from the state's borders, including airports, on October 1.</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk says her state is being singled out as troops will remain on the borders of NSW, South Australia and the Northern Territory well into October.</p>

<p>'Treat Queensland like everyone else. Stop singling Queensland out,' the premier said.</p>

<p>Queensland had just five active virus cases on Friday morning, and if no new community transmission is recorded overnight it will have gone 16 days without such an infection.</p>

<p>Two new cases emerged on a ship off the coast of Cape York, but they won't be counted until they enter Queensland. </p>
