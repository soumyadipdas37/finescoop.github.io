<p>Changes: Millie Mackintosh has revealed she's returning to her sexy lingerie after being forced to give up breastfeeding her daughter Sienna</p>

<p>Millie told fans she'd been sent the sexy lingerie, but had been unable to wear the snap due to her breastfeeding.</p>

<p>But the star was now ready to don the revealing two-piece, writing: 'As my breast feeding journey has come to an end I decided it was time to treat myself to some new underwear! <?php echo e('@'); ?>agentprovocateur *gift.'</p>

<p>Hours earlier Millie also shared a glimpse of her vast wardrobe in the midst of a pre-autumn clear-out, candidly admitting that plenty of her clothes still don't fit her post-baby physique.</p>

<p>Revealing: The Made In Chelsea star told fans she'd been sent a sheer cream two-piece by a lingerie brand, and was finally ready to wear it after ditching her nursing bras</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Millie told fans that she was no longer able to nurse her daughter Sienna as she has Silent Reflux, a condition that causes children to bring up milk, or be sick, shortly after breastfeeding. </p>

<p>Sh  took to Instagram to give an update on her little one, and said she has to stop breastfeeding and start giving her a specific formula.</p>

<p>Detailing her concern for Sienna, Millie explained in a lengthy caption alongside a photo of the two of them: 'A big development for Sienna (and for me) a few weeks ago was the realisation and confirmation that she has Silent Reflux. </p>

<p>Candid: On Tuesday, Millie told fans that she was no longer able to nurse her daughter Sienna as she has Silent Reflux, a condition that causes children to bring up milk after breastfeeding</p>

<p>'She'd been displaying quite a few symptoms - distracted short breast feeds, crying every night, arching her back, going stiff, coughing and always trying to stand up.</p>

<p>'All of these symptoms were made worse when she started wearing her hip harness as she couldn't stretch out her legs which is what many babies do in response to reflux. </p>

<p>'We had assumed it was the harness itself causing her distress but it wasn't until I read <?php echo e('@'); ?>magic_sleep_fairy book that it all made sense.</p>

<p>'I felt so bad for not realising before as she seemed so happy in the day. I was reassured a lot of her symptoms were just 'normal' baby behaviour but I knew deep down that something wasn't right. </p>

<p>Struggle: Millie said Sienna was 'distracted short breast feeds, crying every night, arching her back, going stiff, coughing and always trying to stand up' which led to the diagnosis</p>

<p>'My mummy instinct was right and confirmed at an appointment with a Paediatric Gastroenterologist.'</p>

<p>Millie went on to talk about what she is doing to help Sienna, as she added: 'Sienna is now on medication and based on the professional advice given, it has meant my breastfeeding journey has come to an end much sooner than I had hoped. </p>

<p>'It was a really emotional decision to step back and transition to the suggested specific formula that helps with this condition. </p>

<p>'I reminded myself that firstly it's all about whatever is best for Sienna and secondly I am so grateful for the 4 months of beautiful bonding we shared during our feeding times (it's not a given for everyone) </p>

<p>'I was at peace with whatever need to be done in order to make Sienna comfortable.'</p>

<p>Hard: Of having to stop breastfeeding, she admitted 'it was a really emotional decision to step back and transition to the suggested specific formula that helps with this condition'</p>

<p>Millie hit out at trolls, as she begged 'mum police' not to judge her: 'I'm in no way suggesting anyone stops breast feeding just because their baby has reflux...</p>

<p>'my reflux / breast feeding journey with Sienna was exacerbated by her wearing a hip harness. </p>

<p>'Breast feeding became even more difficult (impossible to ever get her in a comfy position) and I did try to combi feed for a while but I found it all too much.</p>

<p>'It's been a tough few months, needless to say anxiety levels went sky-high and I'm still struggling with the emotional rollercoaster of being a new mum - the guilt, the worry, the panic and the other hundred things that I try not to overwhelm myself with!'</p>

<p>On Sunday, Millie marked her first four months of motherhood by reflecting on the highs and lows of becoming a mum.  </p>

<p>Reflux is when a baby brings up milk during or shortly after feeding. This is different from vomiting in babies, where a baby's muscles forcefully contract.</p>

<p>Other symptoms can include gagging, choking and excessive crying.</p>

<p>Reflux is common in babies but normally stops by the time a baby is a year old, when the ring of muscle at the bottom of their oesophagus fully develops and stops stomach contents leaking out.</p>

<p>Information on the NHS website states: 'Parents don't normally need to get medical advice if their baby seems otherwise happy and healthy, and is gaining weight appropriately.'</p>

<p>She  revealed that at times she's been 'beside herself with worry' and that the 'lack of time for self-care takes its toll sometimes'. </p>

<p>However Millie explained that getting into a routine and trying to be 'more relaxed' despite having 'always suffered with anxiety' has helped in an essay for Sheerluxe.  </p>

<p>One of the most difficult times for the new mum came when Sienna was diagnosed with hip dysplasia at three-months-old and had to wear a harness for six to 12 weeks.</p>

<p>Millie said: 'I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t beside myself with worry; the whole experience made me realise I have a lifetime of worry ahead of me.'</p>

<p>She explained how although Sienna did cry at first, she soon got used to the harness with Millie praising babies for being so adaptable. </p>

<p>Millie gave birth to Sienna in May during the coronavirus pandemic and national lockdown, something which she said was 'daunting'.</p>

<p>However although hating the idea of not being able to have her husband with her during the delivery, Millie said that her main concern was Sienna's wellbeing. </p>

<p>She added that her 'primal instincts' kicked in and that Hugo did get to be with her for a few hours at the hospital after their daughter was born.  </p>
