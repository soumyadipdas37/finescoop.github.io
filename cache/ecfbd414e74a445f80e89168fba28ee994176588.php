<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor's rumoured winner Irena Srbinovska has hinted she is no longer dating Locky Gilbert - sparking rumours the pair quietly split after filming the finale in July.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 31-year-old nurse liked an Instagram comment from a reality TV fan who said she was 'too good' for the former Australian Survivor star.</p>

<p>'You're too good for him tho!!!' the fan wrote alongside two rose emojis. As reported by The Wash, Irena was among the seven users who liked the comment.</p>

<p>Oh no! The Bachelor's rumoured winner Irena Srbinovska (pictured) has hinted she is no longer dating Locky Gilbert - sparking rumours the pair quietly split after filming the finale in July</p>

<p>While it's not conclusive evidence, the social media activity strongly suggests that Irena and Locky did not get their happy ending. </p>

<p>Of course, there are other possible interpretations.</p>

<p>While it can be seen as proof that Irena is no longer dating Locky, she may also have liked the comment simply because it was complimentary.</p>

<p>Alternatively, Irena may have simply liked the comment by accident, which is quite easy to do when scrolling through Instagram quickly.</p>

<p>The Melburnian has been the bookies' favourite since the first episode, but rumours are swirling that she isn't the clear-cut winner like in previous seasons.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has heard whispers that Locky actually rejects Irena and chooses Bella Varelis in the finale, but Bella turns him down because she can't handle the fact he is also in love with Irena.</p>

<p>He then makes a sudden about-turn and declares his undying love for Irena, who tentatively agrees to begin a relationship with him despite her misgivings about his lingering feelings for Bella.</p>

<p>These rumours are still unconfirmed, however, and the actual outcome of The Bachelor remains a closely guarded industry secret.</p>

<p>But it's interesting that this ending seems to correlate with trailers for the series, which promise a finale 'like no other' as Locky is forced to choose between two women he has fallen in love with.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>
