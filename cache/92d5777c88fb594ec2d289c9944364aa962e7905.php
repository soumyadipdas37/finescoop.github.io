<p>It’s a classic hue that never goes out of fashion. The top nail brands have uncorked their new autumn colours and red wine shades are more popular than ever. </p>

<p>As we enter the new season, the timeless classic colour, reliable red, is back on the scene and more popular than ever. Picture: Stock</p>

<p>A good budget buy, and good for nail health, is Barry M’s new Air Breathable Nail Paint in After Dark (£3.99).  </p>

<p>RACE YOU THERE  </p>

<p>On sale today: a good foundation that’s also a budget buy.</p>

<p>Perhaps that’s because the new Essence Pretty Natural Hydrating Foundation (£4.99) was developed after the brand held workshops asking customers what they look for in a make-up base. There are 31 shades. </p>

<p>It has a superlight texture that provides good coverage and a moisturising formula (which includes aloe vera) for a long-lasting, natural-looking matte finish.</p>

<p>IS THERE A NICER WAY TO WEAR A MASK?  </p>

<p>A university hospital in San Antonio, Texas, found medics who spritzed their masks with aromatherapy oil not only found the masks smelled better, but the oil helped with breathing, too, creating a sense of calm. </p>

<p>Some of us don’t feel comfortable wearing face coverings, but according to Sinead Duffy, founder of aromatherapy brand Yogandha, even the smallest drop of precious oils can transform the experience of wearing a mask.</p>

<p>‘Not only do oils smell nice, but they can support the respiratory system and calm you down if you feel anxious,’ she says.</p>

<p>THREE OF THE BEST DRY SHAMPOOS </p>

<p>In your 50s </p>

<p>Batiste Skinnydip Nice Dry Shampoo (£2.99) is a sweetly-scented spray that instantly refreshes hair. It has been designed with accessory brand Skinnydip. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In your 60s </p>

<p>Innersense Refresh Dry Shampoo (£22) has a foam-to-powder texture that feels like it’s soaking up oil. It dries up greasy roots using witch hazel and tapioca starch while adding fullness to hair.</p>

<p>In your 70s</p>

<p>Amika Phantom Hydrating Dry Shampoo Foam (£10) is perfect for all hair types and has a foam texture that absorbs oil. It dissolves instantly without leaving a sticky residue.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>SHAMELESS INDULGENCE </p>

<p>Voce Viva, the new scent from Valentino, now has a big voice behind it, as the Italian couture house has appointed pop star Lady Gaga to sing the fragrance’s praises in its publicity campiagn. (Voce Viva translates from the Latin roughly as ‘living voice’.)</p>

<p>The fragrance (from £55, nationwide from October 4) is a bouquet of white flowers, combined with orange blossom absolute, golden gardenia and a woody base of crystal moss and Madagascar vanilla absolute.</p>

<p>Fashionistas will notice that the little gold spikes running up the lid of the bottle are a nod to Valentino’s popular Rockstud shoes, beloved by celebrities including JLo, Reese Witherspoon and, we now assume, Lady Gaga.</p>
