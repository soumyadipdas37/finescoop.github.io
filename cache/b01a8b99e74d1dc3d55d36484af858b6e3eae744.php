<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> Good news. This is shaping up to be a busy season accessories wise, and accessories are, as everyone knows, the simplest, easiest and cheapest way to update your wardrobe.</p>

<p>Chunky gold chains and lockets, tick. Gold and pearl hoop earrings, tick. 'Heritage' silk scarves worn around your throat, tick.</p>

<p>All of the above will kick your look into next year and beyond. But the detail that looks like it will pull it all together (literally) is belts.</p>

<p>Yes, belts. Remember them? Sort of loved them and then . . . consigned to the drawer with the never-worn leather gloves and fussy evening bags. We haven't been wearing belt-friendly clothes for a while.</p>

<p>Belter: Kaia Gerber in Chloe - a belt may be your secret weapon this autumn says Shane Watson</p>

<p>In our sporty, smart-casual lockdown lives, belts have seemed superfluous, not to mention restricting.</p>

<p>But, strangely enough, a belt might turn out to be your secret weapon this autumn. It doesn't have to be wide with a slim, square buckle (though it could be), it might be a sliver of chain, or clunky and gold, or a classic, mid-width, black leather belt with a brass buckle. Just keep an open mind for now.</p>

<p>Get back to brass buckles with jeans.</p>

<p>The very autumn 2020 way to go is to wear a thick belt cinching in your fat woollen cardigan or tailored jacket.</p>

<p>This one, needless to say, requires a slim frame. We're not suggesting it's a great idea for everyone, but it's an example of what belts are meant to be doing: turning cardies into something less dozy weekend and more ripe for nipping to work, while also giving jackets a reboot (see Gigi Hadid in plaid, far right).</p>

<p>If you're interested, Zara does a good wide black belt (£17.99, zara.com). But more likely you're going to be wearing a regular leather belt, with an oval metal buckle (£15.99, zara.com) with your new wider-leg jeans and a tucked-in, or half tucked-in, shirt.</p>

<p>Or you're going to be wearing a high-waisted plaid skirt and a skinny polo neck, finished off with a narrow crocodile belt (£35, stories.com).</p>

<p>Or maybe a black waistcoat, a white blouse and high-waisted black trousers with a belt revealing a chunk of four solid chain links in the front (£15.99, zara.com). Here's the real point of belts and why we need to pay attention: you can see them now because your sweater is cropped, your top is partly or fully tucked in and your waistband is high up on your waist.</p>

<p>It's about a subtle change in silhouette, a waist-advertising shift, as well as being in the mood for a bit of bling.</p>

<p>These belts are also smartening, of course. If fashion has its way, you'll be wearing your wider trousers with a bold belt, a ruffle-fronted blouse, a blazer and, as previously advertised, gold and pearl earrings.</p>

<p>Think French sophisticate circa-1979 meets sharp Sloane Ranger. If you regret never getting around to buying one of those Gucci double G buckled belts, now is your moment (£250, matchesfashion.com).</p>

<p>After a similar effect for a lot less money? Try John Lewis's double O-ring belt (£26, johnlewis.com).</p>

<p>Last but not least, belts are old favourite restorers. Slinky chain belts like Zara's double link one with lobster clasp (£17.99, zara.com) give old separates a new contemporary edge. A gold belt with a chain (£19.99, zara.com) will transform winter's silky shirt dress.</p>

<p>Celine Dion poses in New York City. She wears a thin belt over a plaid co-ord</p>

<p>Last year's black jumpsuit? Try it this year with Massimo Dutti's double bit belt (£49.95, massimodutti.com).</p>

<p>Tailoring, from culottes to masculine trouser-suits, looks sharper with a belt. Try a vintage-style brown leather belt with a D brass buckle (£24.90, uniqlo.com) with one of H&amp;M's trouser-suits, designed with Italian tailoring label Giuliva Heritage.</p>

<p>Everything is instantly less utility with a belt. How do you make your jeans look modern? Add a horsebit buckle belt (£34.95, massimodutti.com) or one in snake if you prefer (£10, accessorize.com). How do you make last year's midi-dress look like this autumn's It-dress? Sling on a metallic belt (£15.99, zara.com).</p>

<p>You can't go far wrong.</p>
