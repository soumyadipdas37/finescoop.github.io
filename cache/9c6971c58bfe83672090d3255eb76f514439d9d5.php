<p>Adam Yates became the ninth Briton to wear the Tour de France’s yellow jersey</p>

<p>The decision saw Mitchelton-Scott’s Yates, who began the day four seconds down, elevated to race leader.</p>

<p>Yates said: ‘It’s not the way I imagined taking the jersey. I’m not sure what happened to Julian. If I’m honest I don’t think anyone wants to take a jersey like this but I guess we’ll wear it tomorrow.’</p>

<p>Bennett, Alaphilippe’s Deceuninck-QuickStep team-mate, became the first Irishman to wear green since Sean Kelly won the points classification for the fourth and final time in 1989.</p>
