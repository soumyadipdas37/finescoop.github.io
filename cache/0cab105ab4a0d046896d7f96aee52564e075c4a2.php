<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lindsey Vonn has proudly revealed her new smile while sharing graphic footage of herself getting veneers during her latest trip to the dentist.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old former Olympic skier took to Instagram on Monday to post a behind-the-scenes video of the procedure performed by Dr. Bill Dorfman, a Los Angeles-based cosmetic dentist who has appeared on ABC Extreme Makeover and Oprah. </p>

<p>'I got new teeth. Thx Dr. Dorfman. CAUTION...some gross content,' she captioned the video compilation, which begins with the dentist drilling down her front teeth. </p>

<p>Before and after: Lindsey Vonn, 35, shared a behind-the-scenes video of herself getting veneers on her two front teeth </p>

<p>Process: The video beings with cosmetic dentist Dr. Bill Dorfman drilling down her teeth </p>

<p>Dental veneers are wafer-thin shells of tooth-colored porcelain or composite that are cemented over the teeth to correct dental issues. </p>

<p>When getting veneers for the first time, a dentist will trim down each tooth and remove the enamel before taking an impression of the teeth. The mold will then be used to create the veneers. </p>

<p>In the video, Lindsey can be seen rubbing her tongue over her misshapen tooth after it was drilled down. </p>

<p>'Wait... What?' she wrote.  </p>

<p>Say what? In the video, Lindsey can be seen rubbing her tongue over her misshapen tooth after it was trimmed down</p>

<p>Candid: Lindsey admitted that there was plenty of drooling the procedure </p>

<p>Behind the scenes: Lindsey also shared an Instagram Stories video of one of her veneers being placed over her tooth </p>

<p>The athlete explained that her two front teeth were 'ground' down while showing off her 'freaky' smile. She even shared footage of herself heavily drooling. </p>

<p>'Do I dare see what it looks like?' she asked at the end of the procedure, but she was thrilled with the results. </p>

<p>'Yay,' she said, smiling for the camera. </p>

<p>Lindsey also took to Instagram Stories to share a close-up of her front teeth before she got new veneers as well as footage of the porcelain shells being placed over her teeth. </p>

<p>Happy smile: Lindsey shared a before-and-after photo on her Instagram Stories </p>

<p>Looking good: The former Olympic skier proudly showed off her new smile after the procedure  </p>

<p>Something different: The video was a far cry from the glamorous display Lindsey put on back in February 2019 </p>

<p>She ended the clip with a before-and-after photo of her veneers, writing: 'See... Much better! Thx <?php echo e('@'); ?>DrBillDorfman.'</p>

<p>It is not known whether the world champion skier paid for her new pearly whites or whether the treatment was gifted to her - however if she did have to foot the bill it will likely have cost her a pretty penny. </p>

<p>Veneers are considered a cosmetic procedure and are often not covered by dental insurance. </p>

<p>Traditional porcelain veneers cost on average $925 to $2,500 per tooth and can last 10 to 15 years, according to the Consumer Guide to Dentistry. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, composite veneers cost approximately $250 to $1500 per tooth but only last between five and seven years. </p>
