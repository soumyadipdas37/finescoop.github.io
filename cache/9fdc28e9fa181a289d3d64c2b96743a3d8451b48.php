<p>Street style: Irina Shayk looked simply sensational on Thursday, as she strutted down the street in a pair of black military-style boots in New York City</p>

<p>She accessorized with a large tote bag, which she kept on her arm, and a few pieces of gold jewelry. </p>

<p>During her solo outing, the mother-of-one's chestnut-brown tresses cascaded just past her shoulders.</p>

<p>As she forwent a CDC-recommended mask amid the ongoing pandemic, Shayk showed off her subtle nude lipstick and perfectly sun-kissed complexion. </p>

<p>Trendy: The Vogue cover girl, 34, sported a radiant tan under a pair of tiny, oval sunglasses, which added a stylish touch to her laid-back sweatsuit</p>

<p>Her sighting comes after a slew of platonic reunions with her ex Bradley Cooper, who is the father of her three-year-old daughter Lea.  </p>

<p>The former couple have been making the most of their time together, as they were photographed together on Tuesday and Thursday. </p>

<p>Bradley and Irina began dating in 2015. Lea was born in 2017, but they called it quits in June 2019.</p>

<p>Turning heads: While a tad loose-fitting, the supermodel's black crewneck sweatshirt and matching pants still managed to display her lithe physique</p>

<p>The couple haven't let the end of their romance or their very busy schedules interfere with their co-parenting.</p>

<p>'There are still challenges because he does have a very busy schedule and she’s back at work now so there are times they have to compromise, and they do,' a source told HollywoodLife in March.</p>

<p>'He’s been making an effort to take projects that aren’t too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he’s very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he’d carry her everywhere.'</p>

<p>Exes: Bradley and Irina split in June 2019 after four years together. They're seen at the 2018 Met Gala above</p>

<p>'He’s totally devoted to Lea, it’s really sweet to see how much he loves being a dad,' the insider went on.</p>

<p>He's been back in NYC after spending time in Southern California shooting a yet-to-be-titled Paul Thomas Anderson film.  </p>

<p>She has been spotted several times with her potential new boyfriend Vito Schnabel, who is a longtime pal and previously dated Heidi Klum. </p>

<p>Lingerie model: Earlier this month she shared an image from Intimissimi: 'The new bi-color triangle lace bra'</p>
