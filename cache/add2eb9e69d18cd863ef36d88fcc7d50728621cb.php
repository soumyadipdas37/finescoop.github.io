<p>It comes after Yazmin lifted the lid on her reunion with James during last Sunday night's episode of The Only Way Is Essex. </p>

<p>She spoke to Bobby Norris and Nicole Bass about how she ditched her gal pal Amber Turner while on holiday to enjoy a romantic reunion with her then ex James.</p>

<p>Confronting Yaz over the situation, he said: 'What I've heard through the Essex grape vine is that you skanked Amber at a beach club and jetted off to Mallorca to meet Lockie.' </p>

<p>Attempting to explain herself, she retorted: 'So I was on my first girls' holiday ever with Amber in Ibiza and I think that kind of, not worried James a little bit...</p>

<p>'But he thought God she's moving on with her life and he was messaging me every day like come out here, so I took the first flight out to Mallorca.'</p>

<p>Appearing happy with herself, she told Bobby: 'And I've got to say it was the best decision I've ever made.'</p>

<p>'They're getting along really well and sparks are flying – it's like the old days. They're on holiday with a large group of people but they're really reconnecting.'</p>
