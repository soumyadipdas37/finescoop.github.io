<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Drew Barrymore will be welcoming friends and co-stars from some of the biggest hits of her illustrious film career when her new daytime talk show premieres next week.    </p>

<p>On Tuesday, The Drew Barrymore Show announced a star-studded slate of guests expected for the premiere week, which will kick things off next Monday with a Charlie's Angels reunion featuring Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu, almost 20 years since the first film hit theaters.</p>

<p>Also on Monday, Barrymore, 45, will welcome her three-time onscreen love interest Adam Sandler, with whom she first starred in 1998's beloved period rom-com The Wedding Singer.</p>

<p>New venture: Drew Barrymore will be welcoming friends and co-stars from some of the biggest hits of her illustrious film career when her new daytime talk show premieres next week</p>

<p>It will be a special treat in particular to see Diaz, 48, in front of the camera, albeit as herself – the actress has stepped away from performing ever since 2014's Annie.</p>

<p>Cameron, Lucy and Drew appeared in 2000's Charlie's Angels, which was a worldwide hit that spawned a sequel in 2003 – Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, featuring Demi Moore.  </p>

<p>Sandler, 53, re-teamed with Barrymore in the cute 50 First Dates in 2004, and then ten years later for the less successful Blended. </p>

<p>Remember when: The new chat show host will welcome her three-time onscreen love interest Adam Sandler, with whom she first starred in 1998's beloved rom-com The Wedding Singer</p>

<p>It will of course be nice to see Drew catching up with her former co-stars, whom she reportedly still counts among her friends.</p>

<p>Other guest lined up for the rest of the premiere week for the one-hour nationally syndicated program include Gabrielle Union, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Eichner, Jane Fonda, Charlize Theron and Billy Porter.  </p>

<p>Barrymore's multi-format show will incorporate news-like segments in addition to standard chat show elements, all focused around Drew's infectious brand of optimism. </p>

<p>Good News: Barrymore's new multi-format show will incorporate news-like segments in addition to standard chat show elements, focused around Drew's infectious brand of optimism</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how exactly the star – who made her film debut at age five in 1980's Altered States – will actually welcome her guests, as concerns around the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic remain prevalent.</p>

<p>While the show is being shot and produced in New York City, other review shows there have continued to 'welcome' guests virtually via Zoom-like platforms.</p>

<p>While in-person reunions remain preferable – HBO Max's long-touted Friends reunion has again been delayed until next spring in hopes they can all sit on the same couch – it's very likely Drew will be surrounded by a bare minimum of other people for the start of this new endeavor.</p>

<p>Time will tell: It remains to be seen how exactly the star will actually welcome her guests, as concerns around the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic remain prevalent</p>

<p>Nonetheless, reuniting with her Angels will be a surefire way to start off the proceedings, as Drew, Cameron and Lucy had a phenomenal mix of chemistry and humor in their two Charlie's Angels action flicks. </p>

<p>The first Charlie's Angels premiered in theaters on November 3rd, 2000, which makes next week's reunion a 20th anniversary celebration almost to the date. </p>

<p>Last year, the franchise tried to capture that previous magic with a reboot starring Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska, but the film failed to make much of an impression with audiences. </p>

<p>Coming soon: The Drew Barrymore Show premieres on CBS on Monday, September 14th</p>
