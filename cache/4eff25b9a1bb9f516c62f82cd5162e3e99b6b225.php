<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A White Island eruption survivor has shown off her incredible recovery from horrifically burned legs after the devastating volcano blast.</p>

<p>Stephanie Browitt suffered burns to 70 per cent of her body and needed her fingers amputated after being caught in the horror eruption near Whakatane, New Zealand, last December.</p>

<p>47 people were trapped on the island when the volcano blew, sending ash, rocks, debris and 300C steam into the air at more than 100 metres per second.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old is among 26 survivors of the blast and now wears a full face mask to protect her healing skin.</p>

<p>Ms Browitt spent seven months recovering in hospital after the eruption.</p>

<p>Her 21-year-old sister Krystal and father Paul were among 16 Australians who died in the blast.</p>

<p>When first responders arrived on the scene after the explosion, Mr Browitt urged them to save his girls before coming back for him.</p>

<p>Krystal was killed in the initial blast, while Mr Browitt died later in hospital.</p>

<p>Ms Browitt has previously said despite the time that passed, she remembers the eruption like it was 'just yesterday'.</p>

<p>'Honestly, every time it's the ninth of each month I can feel my heart racing and my body tense as the memory of it floods back in my mind,' Ms Browitt wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p> The White Island volcano erupted on December 9 2019, with 47 people trapped on the island leaving 21 dead</p>

<p>'I get anxious. I hate it so much, it does not get easier. It just hurts more and more when I think about how much time has passed since I was last with my dad and sister.'</p>

<p>Ms Browitt said she keeps wishing she could turn back time and at least have looked for her sister and father and sat with them during the aftermath.</p>

<p>'We're just picking up the pieces of our new lives and doing the best that we can do,' she said.</p>

<p>'I just want to thank everyone for your kindness, compassion and constant support. You guys manage to put a smile on my face, even if just for a second.'</p>

<p>Ms Browitt's (pictured) sister Krystal and father Paul died in the horrific eruption in December 2019</p>

<p>Before the tragedy more than 18,000 tourists would visit the White Island volcano each year.</p>

<p>Six days before the eruption, on December 3 2019, volcanologists raised the alert level of White Island to level two, which is the most dangerous level a volcano can be classified as without erupting.</p>

<p>This was due to an increase in tremor levels, gas and unrest at the site.</p>

<p>A similar eruption occurred at White Island in 2016, but it was at night and no one was there. </p>

<p>24 Australians were among 47 tourists on New Zealand's White Island when it erupted.   </p>
