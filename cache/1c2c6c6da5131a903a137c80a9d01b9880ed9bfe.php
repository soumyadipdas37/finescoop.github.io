<p>Health complications: She also opened up on Insta about her health complications with her previous pregnancies, revealing: 'My placenta sucks'</p>

<p>Bed rest: But she remained optimistic about her new addition: 'We just have to get my placenta healthy again, and that means not moving so I’m on complete and total "don’t get out except to pee-pee" bed rest'</p>

<p>'I was stealing all his food because I was getting huge but he wasn’t getting big at all, so he had to come out early and Luna had to come out early. I was induced both times.'</p>

<p>But she remained optimistic about her new addition: 'Everything’s good. I’m feeling really good, but my placenta’s really, really weak and it’s causing me to really bleed a lot. So basically, it’s just pretty high risk.</p>

<p>'This poor thing has been through so much already. We just have to get my placenta healthy again, and that means not moving so I’m on complete and total "don’t get out except to pee-pee" bed rest.'</p>
