<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Harry Kane is expected to start for the fourth time in 10 days against Leyton Orient on Tuesday as Tottenham's search for a striker continues.</p>

<p>While Jose Mourinho will rotate his side for the Carabao Cup third round, including a possible debut for Joe Hart, he has limited options up front.</p>

<p>That is likely to mean Kane will not get a rest, despite playing all but eight minutes of Tottenham's three games in all competitions so far this season. The striker also started both of England's Nations League fixtures earlier this month.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho admits that Harry Kane is likely to start against Leyton Orient this week</p>

<p>Asked about Kane's involvement against Orient, Mourinho said: 'Harry in principle he has to be. We need, especially in these matches against these teams, in theory, inferior and, in theory, teams that are going to defend against you, you need a striker.</p>

<p>'I want Harry to play, let's see if he can, if he feels ready to move. He's an experienced player, he knows his body better than any sports science guy or any medical guy. If he is ready to play, of course he will.'</p>

<p>In indicating there will widespread changes to the side that beat Southampton 5-2, Mourinho added: 'In some positions, the squad gives us incredible options.</p>

<p>'If you look today to our bench, you can imagine that Serge Aurier is going to play, Joe Hart is going to play, Moussa (Sissoko), Toby (Alderweireld) is going to play. (Erik) Lamela is going to play.</p>

<p>Kane (right) has played all but eight minutes of Tottenham's first three games of the season</p>

<p>Mourinho says Kane will start on Tuesday as he has limited options to rotate his forward line</p>

<p>'You can imagine that some of these guys are going to play, replacing players from the same level, exactly players from the same level so you can imagine that some of them are going to play replacing others.'</p>

<p>Mourinho has previously suggested Dele Alli will also be involved, having been left out of the past two squads. </p>

<p>New signing Sergio Reguilon is expected to be fit to play 'by the end of the week' after an ankle issue, according to Mourinho, while Gareth Bale will feature after the October international break.</p>

<p>But Mourinho is planning to rotate his side and Joe Hart is in line to make his Spurs debut</p>

<p>'I don't know when Gareth can be back,' Mourinho said. </p>

<p>'The only thing that I know is that the motivation is high, he is so happy to be with a club of his heart, he is so happy to play for us and when a player has this motivation, many, many times you can shorten the period of recovering and shorten the period of getting fit and ready to play and we want to help him.</p>

<p>'So when he is available to train with the team, we are more than happy to have him and to be back to a level that maybe one of the best players in the world.'</p>
