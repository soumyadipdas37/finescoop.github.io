<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lionel Messi continued to delay a final decision on his future as the Barcelona board were thrown into turmoil on Thursday night by accusations of corruption.</p>

<p>Spanish outlet El Mundo reported in its Friday edition that the Catalan police force have filed a report to the judge investigating Barcelona’s hiring of social media consultancy L3 Ventures company to monitor its online presence - and concluded ‘possible economic crimes’.</p>

<p>The allegation, according to El Mundo, is that Barcelona paid up to 600 per cent above the going rate for the services of L3 Ventures who were employed to monitor Barcelona’s social media.</p>

<p>Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his board have been accused of corruption</p>

<p>Lionel Messi delayed a decision on his future after the accusations came to light on Thursday </p>

<p>The investigating judge will have to decide whether or not to act on the report and could ask Barcelona directors to testify.</p>

<p>Controversy around Barcelona’s link to L3 Ventures emerged in February when Cadena Ser reported that the company hired to monitor social media were linked to a series of social media accounts that ran negative stories about club figures who were in potential opposition to president Josep Bartomeu.  </p>

<p>Bartomeu and Messi have been at war after the captain made it known that he wanted to leave</p>

<p>Messi looked as though he was going to leave the club yet this week has brought fresh chaos</p>

<p>Barcelona cancelled their contract with L3 Ventures shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>In July, Barcelona made public the findings of an investigation by audit company PWC that ruled they did not commission L3 Ventures to run a smear campaign against important club figures.</p>

<p>The audit also suggested they did not pay over the market price for the services but El Mundo reported that the police report argues that an audit commissioned by an interested party could not be 'conclusive’. </p>
