<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A jailed crime boss serving 20 years for a machine gun trafficking plot has been awarded compensation after his designer shoes got lost in the the post.</p>

<p>Miekeil Dixon-Nash's £1,500 blue Christian Louboutin were lost when they were posted to him while he was serving time at HMP Swaleside in Kent.</p>

<p>A pair of golden Nike Air Max 97 trainers were also lost after they were posted to the prison.</p>

<p>The gangster, 30, claimed more than £4,500 in loses - which included the price of the £1,500 trainers, as well as for the time he was 'deprived' of wearing the shoes, The Sun reports.</p>

<p>Hearing the case, judge Caroline Wilkinson, at Central London County Court, accepted he owned the trainers and they were sent in.</p>

<p>But she awarded Dixon-Nash £144 for the Louboutins and £95 for the Nikes - because he could not prove they were new.</p>

<p>According to the Sun, which reports that the case may have cost taxpayers thousands of pounds, the judge said: 'I accept that he did own a pair of Christian Louboutin trainers and that he owned these trainers at the time they were sent into the prison. Unfortunately [they were] not returned to him. </p>

<p>Miekeil Dixon-Nash's £1,500 blue Christian Louboutin were lost when they were posted to him while he was serving time at HMP Swaleside in Kent</p>

<p>'He is therefore liable to be compensated for the loss of value to him of those trainers.' </p>

<p>Dixon-Nash was jailed along with his mother Claudette Dixon, 47, for a total of 34 years in 2018.</p>

<p>The pair and a 17-year-old boy were arrested following a shoot out in north London a year earlier. </p>

<p>Detectives investigating the shoot-out found a Colt 45, which was used in the incident and was linked to Dixon-Nash and the boy.</p>

<p>The boy's DNA was then found on a Mac 10 submachine gun in Dixon’s house, in Waltham Cross, Herts.</p>

<p>CCTV captured Dixon-Nash present at the fight and the 17-year-old picking up evidence afterwards. </p>

<p>Phone evidence revealed Dixon-Nash and the 17-year-old arranging a pistol linked to the shootings to be handed over to an associate — which was captured on CCTV.</p>

<p>All three denied conspiracy to supply firearms but were convicted at Wood Green Crown Court.</p>

<p>Dixon-Nash was jailed for 20 years, Dixon for 14 years, and the 17-year-old was sentenced to eight years in a young offenders’ institute. </p>
