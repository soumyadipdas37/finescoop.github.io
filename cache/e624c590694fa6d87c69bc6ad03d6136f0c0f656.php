<p>The model was formerly one of star Kylie Jenner's best friends, and the two often seemed inseparable, but Jordyn was cast out of the Kardashian–Jenner fold after it was revealed that Khloé Kardashian's cheating boyfriend Tristan Thompson had kissed her at a party.  </p>

<p>Last year, she appeared on Jada Pinkett Smith's Red Table Talk show on Facebook to admit kissing Tristan, though she claimed that it wasn't 'intimate.'  </p>

<p>She broke down during the interview, saying she was 'no homewrecker' and denying that she was the reason for Khloé and Tristan's split.</p>

<p>Following the revelations, her friend Kylie cut off contact.  </p>
