<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Protesters remained peaceful in Lancaster, Pennsylvania last night after it was revealed that Richard Munoz - the man whose death they were demonstrating against - had previously stabbed four people and tried to kill a police officer.  </p>

<p>A small group of protesters could be seen gathered in Lancaster last night, holding 'Defund the Police' and 'Black Lives Matter' banners, but their numbers had dwindled since the previous day. </p>

<p>Also in attendance were counter-protesters dressed in army fatigues, who told a DailyMail.com photographer they were there to support the police.  </p>

<p>The quiet night comes after it was revealed that 27-year-old Richard Munoz - who was shot dead by police on Sunday - was awaiting trial for stabbing and seriously injuring four people.  </p>

<p>Cops were called to a home in Lancaster at 4.15pm by Munoz's sister - who told the attending officers he had become aggressive toward their mother and was trying to break into her house.   </p>

<p>Body camera footage released by the Lancaster County District Attorney's Office shows the 27-year-old emerging from the house as soon as an officer arrived 10 minutes later.</p>

<p>Munoz could be seen charging at the officer while brandishing a knife above his head 'in clear view' and 'in a threatening manner' before the officer fired at him. He died at the scene.</p>

<p>Sunday's shooting sparked protests in the city, with people marching from the scene of the shooting to the Lancaster Police Department while chanting 'this is what democracy looks like'. </p>

<p>WGAL-TV reported that protesters also smashed in windows of police cars.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Munoz was awaiting criminal trial on four counts of aggravated assault before he was shot dead Sunday. He also had previous charges of stalking, harassment and criminal trespassing. </p>

<p>Last year, Munoz stabbed and seriously injured four people, including a 16-year-old boy. </p>

<p>Ricardo Munoz was fatally shot by an officer who authorities say was responding to a domestic disturbance call. He can be seen here holding a knife in his right hand</p>

<p>The officer responding to the incident fired several shots at Munoz</p>

<p>At the time, police said an argument between Munoz and several people became physical. He was punched and kicked by them before they walked away from the fight.</p>

<p>Munoz then retreived a folding knife from his backpack and stabbed four other people. It's not clear if the four people stabbed were involved in the initial argument.  </p>

<p>When police arrived at the scene, they found Munoz standing outside a home holding a knife to his throat. He refused to drop the knife when commanded to by officers, and then tried to jump over a handrail.</p>

<p>Cops then used a taser on him to subdue him, and he was taken into custody.  </p>

<p>Police Chief Jarrad Berkihiser held a brief news conference but shared very few details of the shooting. He said that people could remain near the crime scene, but urged them to stay calm and peaceful.</p>

<p>A 'final determination on the use of force' will be made by District Attorney Adams.</p>

<p>'We ask that acts of protest remain peaceful as violence and destruction of property will become headlines and serve no purpose for the safety and wellbeing of our citizens and neighborhoods,' the DA's office requested.</p>

<p>In a statement, Lancaster Mayor Danene Sorace said: 'This has been a heartbreaking day for our city. I grieve for the loss of life and know that there are more questions to be answered as the investigation continues.'</p>

<p>The Lancaster County District Attorney's Office is investigating the incident.</p>
