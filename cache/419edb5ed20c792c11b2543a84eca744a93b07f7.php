<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Roy Jones Jr has admitted he may come to regret agreeing to fight Mike Tyson in an exhibition, describing the former heavyweight champion as 'one of the strongest and most explosive' fighters ever. </p>

<p>Jones and Tyson are set to compete in an unofficial eight-round bout on November 28 in California, two months after the exhibition was originally supposed to take place at the Dignity Health Sports Park.</p>

<p>The fight was pushed back two months to attract a greater audience, which caused former four-weight world-champion boxer Jones to initially threatening to cancel the event before retracting his comments a few days later.</p>

<p>Roy Jones Jr has admitted he may come to regret agreeing to fight Mike Tyson in an exhibition</p>

<p>The duo are set to compete in an unofficial eight-round bout on November 28 in California</p>

<p>But speaking to Sky Sports about the fight at the weekend, Jones is adamant there will be no love lost between the duo and that he will be up against it. </p>

<p>'When it comes time to fight, we're going to fight. If it comes down to bite, we're going to bite. Whatever has to happen, is going to happen, that's just what it is,' Jones said.</p>

<p>'He's still Mike Tyson, he's still one of the strongest, most explosive people who ever touched a boxing ring. If anything, I made a mistake going in with him. He's the bigger guy, he's the explosive guy.</p>

<p>'He's going to have all the first-round fireworks, not me. I do have first-round fireworks, but he's known for more first-round fireworks than anybody to ever touch boxing, other than maybe George Foreman.</p>

<p>And Jones admitted he will still be up against one of the best fighters to have graced the ring</p>

<p>'With him having the first-round fireworks, he'll be against a guy smaller than him, maybe 40-50 pounds smaller than him. But who knows?'</p>

<p>Tyson is nevertheless leaving nothing to chance and last month enlisted the help of WWE icon Kurt Angle and former UFC champion Henry Cejudo for a weekend training session.</p>

<p>Tyson has not fought professionally since 2005, when he lost out to Kevin McBride in his final bout.</p>

<p>Tyson's opponent for November's fight, 51-year-old Jones Jr, meanwhile, has only been inactive since 2018, where he won via unanimous decision against Scott Sigmon.</p>
