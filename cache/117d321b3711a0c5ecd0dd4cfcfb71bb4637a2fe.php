<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jose Mourinho has pleaded for England to treat Harry Kane and his worn-out Tottenham stars with understanding and respect.</p>

<p>Gareth Southgate will name his latest squad on Thursday as Spurs prepare to face Maccabi Haifa in their third game in five days.</p>

<p>Kane is expected to start in the crucial Europa League play-off tie, which will be his ninth appearance for club and country in 26 days since the start of this season.</p>

<p>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho insists England must be careful with selecting Harry Kane</p>

<p>Gareth Bale has been ruled out of Tottenham's match against Manchester United on Sunday</p>

<p>Mourinho, who has complained bitterly about this week's schedule, takes his team to Manchester United on Sunday before an international break in which England play three times in seven days — against Wales, Belgium and Denmark.</p>

<p>'When Kane is fit, he should start every game for Tottenham,' said the Spurs boss, who started with him on the bench for a Carabao Cup tie at Chelsea on Tuesday. 'When you have such a player and you want to win every match, you play him. But you just can't do it.'</p>

<p>Mourinho says he trusts Southgate and his assistant Steve Holland to make the right calls on Kane and Eric Dier, who has also had a hectic start to the new campaign, playing the full 90 minutes in seven games for club and country. Harry Winks has played less because he withdrew from England duty last month and has not featured in every game for Spurs.</p>

<p>Mourinho insisted that he would not ask Gareth Southgate not to pick his English players</p>

<p>Dele Alli has been left out for four of the last five league matches, but will be named on Thursday as part of Spurs' 21-man squad to face Maccabi Haifa.</p>

<p>'I believe that Gareth and Steve care about the players,' said Mourinho. 'I don't think they want to be connected with something that can be a consequence of this week, plus the three matches the national team has, which is obviously too much, especially for my players.</p>

<p>'So I don't speak with Gareth, I don't speak even with Steve. And, of course, with Steve I am a very good friend. I just let them do their job with the freedom they deserve.</p>

<p>'I leave with them the respect they must have to their players because they are also our players so, hopefully, Gareth and Steve understand what happened with Tottenham players this week.</p>

<p>The Portuguese urged Southgate and assistant Steve Holland to be sensible with his players</p>

<p>'That's just my hope. I'm not going to call, I'm not going to beg. They deserve their freedom and I have the utmost respect for them.'</p>

<p>Mourinho also ruled Gareth Bale out of Wales duty as he fights to regain fitness having returned to Tottenham on loan from Real Madrid. Bale will not be ready for action until after the international break, with West Ham on October 17 his target fixture.</p>

<p>'He is working very hard, very professional, very happy, but not yet ready,' said Mourinho. 'The two weeks of internationals can be important weeks for his last phase of recovering and fitness problem, hopefully to play when we're back.'</p>

<p>Bale is yet to feature for Spurs following his return to the club from Real Madrid on loan</p>
