<p>The man behind the wheel, Marco Mazzetta, posted the video to YouTube claiming he was trying to defend himself after he believing he was in danger of being shot himself. </p>

<p>Mazzetta, who was driving along a highway in Orange County near Orlando said he only pulled his gun out after another driver, who was also caught on camera, began shooting at him first.   </p>

<p>A man was caught on camera shooting through his own windshield at another driver on a busy highway near Orlando, Florida</p>

<p>Driver, Marco Mazzetta, posted the video on YouTube claiming he was simply trying to defend himself </p>

<p>Footage shows another driver coming up close behind Mazzetta's truck</p>

<p>Dashcam video shows the other driver's car driving aggressively and at one point passing extremely close to Mazzetta's truck.  </p>

<p>Mazzetta then tapped his breaks causing the other car to bump into him from behind before speeding around him. </p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the second car can be seen to slow down before the driver pulled a gun out and pointed it at him through the window.</p>

<p>It prompted Mazzetta to take his own gun out and fired through his own front window, fearing he might be shot. </p>

<p>The man said he opened fire because the other driver flashed a gun at him first, circled</p>

<p>The other driver appeared to be driving recklessly around Mazzetta's car </p>

<p>Dashcam footage clearly captures the incident from both back and front of the car</p>

<p>Mazzetta told WESH 2, 'I'm not a fan of guns; I'm a fan of not getting shot. I know this video doesn't capture my smartest moments but I hope any idiot criminal with a gun watching thinks twice before loading, brandishing &amp; aiming their firearm at someone over a traffic infraction.'</p>

<p>Florida Highway Patrol has said that it shows how dangerous it is to argue with other drivers on the highway.</p>

<p>'You don't know the mindset of the other driver that you might get involved in some kind of situation. A lot of people carry weapons in their cars. This could have really escalated to somebody getting shot, somebody getting killed,' Florida Highway Patrol's Kim Montes said. </p>

<p>The other driver who held a shotgun out of the window ended up speeding away. Mazzetta later reported the incident to the police</p>
