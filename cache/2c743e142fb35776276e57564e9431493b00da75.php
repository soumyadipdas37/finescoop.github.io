<p>Protesters vandalized the building spraying 'Abolish' and 'Free them all' on the walls of the heavily fortified tower Wednesday. </p>

<p>Many carried signs that said Protesters 'ICE &amp; DHS agents of genocide' and argued with news photographers saying they weren't allowed to take their photos without their 'consent.'  </p>

<p>The doors to the building's Duane Street entrace were also smashed and covered with plywood on Thursday. </p>

<p>On Monday a whistleblower who previously worked at an ICE facility in Georgia filed a complaint to the Department of Homeland Security inspector general saying 'mass hysterectomies' on immigrant women and alleged medical neglect unfolded there.</p>

<p>Dawn Wooten, a former nurse at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, said in the complaint some women may have required a hysterectomy but 'everybody’s uterus cannot be that bad.'</p>

<p>She testified that the immigrant women were referred to one unnamed doctor outside the facility for the 'high rate of hysterectomies' and that a number of migrant women told her they were undergoing surgery without fully understanding why.</p>

<p>'Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy - just about everybody,' Wooten said. 'He's even taken out the wrong ovary on a young lady.'</p>

<p>ICE said in a statement that only two immigrants held at the center had been referred to an outside gynecologist for hysterectomies since 2018.</p>

<p>The Office of the Inspector General has opened an investigation into the allegations.</p>

<p>'The accusations will be fully investigated by an independent office, however, ICE vehemently disputes the implication that detainees are used for experimental medical procedures,' Ada Rivera, the medical director of the Healh Service Corps said to the Wall Street Journal. </p>
