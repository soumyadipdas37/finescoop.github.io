<p>Vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris has praised recent Black Lives Matter protests saying they are 'essential' for change in the country</p>

<p>Speaking at the NAACP convention, Harris praised the 'brilliance' and 'impact' of BLM</p>

<p>'The people's voices must be heard, and it is often the people who must speak to get their government to do what it is supposed to do, but may not do naturally unless the people speak loudly - and obviously peacefully.'  </p>

<p>Harris went on to praise the 'brilliance' and 'impact' of 'Black Lives Matter.' </p>

<p>'I actually believe that Black Lives Matter has been the most significant agent for change within the criminal justice system,' she said.  'I think, a community and the country speaking out, understanding that nothing that we have achieved that has been about progress in this country has come without a fight. Nothing that we have achieved in our country that has been about progress, and in particular around civil rights has come without a fight.'</p>

<p>It's not the first time Harris has defended the cause of protestors taking to city streets across the country.</p>

<p>'We must always defend peaceful protest and peaceful protesters. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder. Make no mistake, we will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice,' Harris said last month.</p>
