<p>Jessica, who is set to head Holland next week to film her new TV show, also revealed last week that she had her twelfth nose job, which she told MailOnline she didn't know she was set to have.</p>

<p>The reality personality shared a glimpse of her new nose via Instagram following the cosmetic procedure after visiting the Prof. Dr. Ali Gürlek in Istanbul, Turkey, on Wednesday, before she was seen leaving the city's W hotel the following day.</p>

<p>Jessica explained to MailOnline: 'Throughout the years I have had a lot of problems, I have had a lot of nose jobs done in Brazil, Colombia, Iran, America and here in Istanbul with great success.   </p>

<p>All in the details: She toted a quilted black handbag and added a stylish ring</p>

<p>'On the downside I've had infections with cartilage, but what caused problems was when they use cartilage from a donor and that's when my drama started a few years ago.</p>

<p>'My latest nose job was in January last year in Iran, the doctor cleared all my nose, removed all the cartilage and left it without any cartilage at all. That's why it was so shrunk.</p>

<p>'Now Dr. Ali Gürlek in Istanbul used cartilage from my ear and I can breathe much better now.'</p>
