<p>The latest: Last year, Mariah Carey was accused of using her ex-assistant Lianna 'Azarian' Shakhnazaryan AMEX card to pay for and conceal various alleged cosmetic procedures. On Friday, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Andrew Borrok sanctioned Lianna for destroying evidence that could have helped Mariah fight her $3 million lawsuit against the former assistant, according to Page Six; pictured January 13, 2020 in NYC</p>

<p>Judge Borrok found that Lianna did destroy WhatsApp messages, two videos and also spilled water on an old cell phone she then gave away after the lawsuit was filed against her by Mariah. </p>

<p>The evidence could have been used by Mariah and her team in her case, the Judge noted in his decision.</p>

<p>'Trading in her cellphone without taking any measures to save the videos, messages, and other date after this lawsuit was filed, when Ms. Shakhnazarian had an undeniable duty to preserve evidence, was grossly negligent, if not intentional,' Judge Borok noted in his decision Friday, the outlet reported.</p>

<p>Lianna's 'actions constituted spoliation of critical evidence and severely prejudiced Ms. Carey's ability to prosecute her case,' the decision read, per Page Six.</p>

<p>The Judge noted that during the trial, he will make an 'inverse inference' against Lianna, as well as ordering her to turn over her current cell phone so that it can be examined using forensics.</p>

<p>Judge Borrok ordered Lianna to pay Mariah's legal fees regarding the matter.</p>

<p>Last year, Mariah filed the $3 million lawsuit against Lianna in New York Supreme Court, alleging in the paperwork that she was a 'opportunist, a voyeur, a Peeping Thomasina and an extortionist' instead of being a 'loyal ally,' according to Page Six.</p>

<p>The suit noted that Mariah hired Lianna in March 2015 and paid her up to $327,000 to work for her.</p>

<p>The suit said: 'Azarian secretly videotaped Carey engaged in intimate acts that, if revealed, would be personally embarrassing and professionally damaging to Carey,' without explaining what the contents are.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the outlet reported that the paperwork said that after Lianna was fired in November 2017,  she allegedly threatened Mariah that she would be release the clips unless she gave her $8 million.</p>

<p>Mariah is suing her for breach of contract since Lianna signed an NDA when she started working for her as well as asking the judge to bar her from releasing any of the footage.</p>

<p>In January 2019, two months before filing the paperwork in New York, Mariah filed the lawsuit in the state of California, according to TMZ.</p>

<p>The outlet reported that Mariah claimed in the documents that Lianna allegedly took her credit cards to buy personal items, claiming that she was buying it for the star. </p>

<p>Lianna filed a countersuit in January 2019, alleging that she endured battery racial abuse from Mariah.  </p>

<p>DailyMail.com exclusively obtained court documents where Shakhnazaryan alleged that her former boss requested to use credit cards registered to her name on surgical treatments.</p>

<p>One invoice was for a total of $32,765, and included PLLA buttock filler injections, a LipoFreeze fat-melting laser treatment to her upper breasts and an firming ultrasound procedure to her neck and jawline.</p>

<p>A separate bill, paid for using Shakhnazaryan's own AMEX, totaled $7,915 and was for a vShape tightening radio-frequency treatment to the thighs. </p>

<p>Additionally, in 2017 Page Six reported that Carey underwent a 'gastric sleeve' procedure for weight loss.</p>

<p>A source told the outlet: 'Mariah has always been proud of her curves, but this summer, as her Caesars Palace residency came to a close, and then she went on tour with Lionel Richie, she noticed it became harder to dance, and she was getting a lot more criticism online from body shamers.'</p>

<p>Mariah has denied getting plastic surgeries in the past.</p>
