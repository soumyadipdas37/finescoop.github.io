<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A rapist who tried to blame an imaginary identical twin for the attack has been jailed for 22 years.</p>

<p>Khaled Argoub, 21, followed a woman off a tube and dragged her into a dark park where he choked her until she blacked out and sexually assaulted her.</p>

<p>He was sentenced at Kingston Crown Court on 17 September after being found guilty of two counts of attempted rape.</p>

<p>He was also found guilty of attempting to choke with intent, assault by penetration and three counts of sexual assault.</p>

<p>Khaled Argoub, 21, was sentenced at Kingston Crown Court after being found guilty of two counts of attempted rape</p>

<p>Argoub was given an extended sentence of 22 years for attempted rape, with the other sentences of nine and ten years to run concurrently. </p>

<p>Fourteen of those he will spend in custody. He will be considered for parole after serving two thirds of the 14 years. </p>

<p>The victim, who is in her 20s and cannot be named for legal reasons, was walking home from a night out with friends through Colliers Wood, south-west London.</p>

<p>CCTV footage shown at trial showed how Argoub followed her from the night tube, down Colliers Wood High Street before entering a residential road at around 3am.</p>

<p>When the victim was most of the way down the street, she noticed Argoub standing in the middle of the road 'smirking' at her, she later described.</p>

<p>The rapist then ran towards the victim, grabbed hold of her, and dragged her into Wandle Park.</p>

<p>He grabbed her from behind with his arm around her neck, chocking her before attempting to rape her. He also sexually assaulted her.</p>

<p>Biting his hand, which was covering her mouth, the victim was able to escape and ran to a nearby block of flats until officers arrived a short time after.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to hospital where she had significant cuts and scratches to her body and reddening to her neck. </p>

<p>Her voice was hoarse from the strangulation and she struggled to speak.</p>

<p>A search was conducted for the suspect, with helicopter and dog support but there was no trace of the defendant. </p>

<p>Officers found a baseball cap with a 'B' logo on the front at the scene.</p>

<p>Officers discovered a man fitting Argoub wearing a baseball cap on CCTV, which was found at the scene of the crime.</p>

<p>Twelve minutes later after the attack, he is seen re-entering the station heading towards Tooting Broadway and is no longer wearing the baseball cap.</p>

<p>A nail clipping was taken from the victim at hospital, which contained a partial DNA profile for Argoub.</p>

<p>He was arrested at 0.45am on 24 August and charged later that day.</p>

<p>Kingston Crown Court heard how during a police interview on 26 August, he had attempted to blame the attack on his imaginary twin brother.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Charlotte Newell said: 'He claimed to have a twin but did not know when he had last seen him or contacted him.</p>

<p>'This is of course in contradiction to him telling his housemate that he had no family in the UK.</p>

<p>Argoub was given an extended sentence of 22 years for attempted rape at Kingston Crown Court (pictured) with the other sentences of nine and ten years to run concurrently</p>

<p>'He said he got around London by following people because he is an animal and that he didn't know Colliers Wood area but his brother might.</p>

<p>'He said that he could not remember where he was on evening on 10 August but probably in bed sleeping.</p>

<p>'He was shown CCTV stills of the male at South Wimbledon and Colliers Wood but denied it was him and maintained that it could be his twin brother.'</p>

<p>Detective Constable Faye Castleman, the officer in charge of the investigation, said: 'On behalf of the victim and her family, I am pleased that justice has been served and I hope that this sentence can bring some closure for them.</p>

<p>'The victim was immensely brave throughout the investigation and I highly commend her courage. </p>

<p>'This case also recognises the importance of forensics in helping to identify offenders.</p>

<p>'We take these cases very seriously and I would encourage anyone who has been through a similar experience to come forward and report it to us in confidence.'</p>
