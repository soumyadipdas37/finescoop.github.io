<p>In light of COVID-19, the retailer is taking extra precautions to ensure team members and customers are safe during their shopping experience.</p>

<p>'We want to do our best during this challenging period to allow our customers to access service, advice and product when they need it,' it said on its website.</p>

<p>'We have expanded our cleaning routines across our stores, including increased cleaning throughout the day.</p>

<p>'Our teams have had additional training on maintaining good hygiene practices. To support this, stores may be operating a little differently than usual.'</p>

<p>All stores will allow a maximum of 100 people into each store at any given time - meaning larger stores will fall well within and smaller stores will meet the federal government's recommendations on social distancing.</p>

<p>Most stores are open but trading hours have changed so shoppers are advised to check the website for their local store.</p>
