<p>Bake Off star Nancy Birtwhistle has shared a simple yet effective tip for stopping glasses from steaming up while wearing a face mask, which involves putting a drop of dish soap on the lens and rubbing it in</p>

<p>Explaining in a comment that she uses 'eco friendly washing up liquid that has no harsh chemicals', Nancy squeezes a drop onto one lens.</p>

<p>She then rubs the detergent into the glass using her finger before wiping any residue with a cloth.</p>

<p>Nancy then puts the glasses on, while donning a stylish black and white polka dot face mask, to put it to the test.</p>

<p>Miraculously the side which had dish soap applied to it remained clear, while the other fogged up in seconds. </p>
