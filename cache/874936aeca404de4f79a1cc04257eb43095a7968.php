<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Belarus opposition leader tore up her passport to foil authorities trying to deport her to Ukraine in the dead of night, it was claimed today. </p>

<p>Maria Kolesnikova was driven to a border crossing in the early hours of this morning but 'took action' to prevent her 'forcible expulsion', Ukraine's government said, a day after she was allegedly kidnapped in Minsk. </p>

<p>Ukrainian media said Kolesnikova had torn up her passport to ensure that border guards would deny her entry - while two of her opposition allies entered Ukraine.</p>

<p>Belarus claims that Kolesnikova was arrested at the border, giving a different version of events in which the 38-year-old made an 'illegal' attempt to flee the country. </p>

<p>Border police made the extraordinary claim that Kolesnikova was 'pushed out' of a speeding BMW as it raced to escape the guards. </p>

<p>But Ukrainian government minister Anton Geraschchenko said today that 'it wasn't a voluntary trip' - praising 'this brave woman' for preventing her deportation. </p>

<p>Friends of Kolesnikova had been unable to contact her after she was allegedly snatched by masked men who bundled her into a van in Minsk on Monday, a claim which Belarus denies.    </p>

<p>Maria Kolesnikova (pictured) foiled an attempt to deport her across the Ukrainian border this morning, Ukraine's government said </p>

<p>Border police said that Kolesnikova was arrested at a crossing between Belarus and Ukraine (the approximate journey is shown on a map) </p>

<p>Kolesnikova is part of a female triumvirate challenging the rule of 'Europe's last dictator' Alexander Lukashenko, but was the only one who remained in Belarus after last month's disputed election led to a crackdown in the ex-Soviet country.</p>

<p>Belarus border police claimed to state media that she had arrived at the Aleksandrovka border crossing at 4am with the aim of fleeing the country.  </p>

<p>Kolesnikova was travelling with her allies Anton Rodnenkov and Ivan Kravtsov, members of the Coordination Council aiming to secure a peaceful transfer of power. </p>

<p>'Rodnenkov, Kravtsov and Kolesnikova passed the customs border control in a BMW car and headed for Ukraine,' claimed spokesman Anton Bychkovsky. </p>

<p>'However, as they saw border guards, the car abruptly picked up speed, which posed a threat to the life of a border guard. </p>

<p>'Kolesnikova appeared outside the vehicle. In fact, she was pushed out of the vehicle that kept moving towards Ukraine.'</p>

<p>The opposition leader was being held and 'an investigation is under way to legally assess the situation,' Bychkovsky said.  </p>

<p>However, a different narrative soon emerged from Ukraine, where deputy interior minister Geraschchenko said the opposition leader was transported against her will. </p>

<p>'It was a violent expulsion from her native country with the aim of compromising the Belarusian opposition,' he said. </p>

<p>'Maria Kolesnikova was not able to be removed from Belarus because this brave woman took action to prevent her movement across the border.' </p>

<p>He added: 'All responsibility for her life and health is personally carried by Alexander Lukashenko.'  </p>

<p>An 'informed source' gave a similar version of the story to Interfax Ukraine, saying that Kolesnikova had foiled Belarus's attempt to deport her. </p>

<p>'When attempting to deport her, she tore her passport and could not be allowed into the territory of Ukraine by border guards,' the source said. </p>

<p>Ukrainian border guards said that Kolesnikova had not entered the country, refuting initial claims that she had crossed the border.  </p>

<p>But Kiev's embassy in Minsk confirmed that Rodnenkov and Kravtsov had reached Ukraine, where they are 'undergoing the necessary border control measures'.  </p>

<p>A fellow ex-Soviet country, Ukraine has called for new elections in Belarus and joined the European Union in saying that last month's poll was not free or fair. </p>

<p>Russia, which backs Lukashenko, has alleged that 200 Ukrainian extremists were trying to foment trouble in Belarus, but Kiev denies this.   </p>

<p>Britain and Germany were last night demanding answers on Kolesnikova's whereabouts after she and the two others went missing in Minsk. </p>

<p>'Lukashenko's regime must make her safe return their highest priority,' said UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab. </p>

<p>His German counterpart Heiko Maas demanded 'clarity on the whereabouts and the release of all political prisoners in Belarus'.  </p>

<p>Kolesnikova's friends say she was snatched along with a spokesman and executive secretary of the Coordination Council. </p>

<p>'We still don't know where Maria is and what is happening to her,' said lawyer Maxim Znak, a member of the Council, which is facing a criminal probe that has seen some its members arrested and called for questioning. </p>

<p>Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya rejected Lukashenko's claim to have won the August 9 election with 80 per cent of the vote, extending his 26-year rule. </p>

<p>Tikhanovskaya, Kolesnikova and a third woman, Veronika Tsepkalo, fronted the campaign against Lukashenko which drew enthusiastic support at rallies.</p>

<p>But the aftermath of the election has degenerated into protests and a crackdown by police which saw 633 people detained on Sunday.  </p>

<p>The disputed election has led to mass protests in Minsk, pictured here on Sunday with people waving opposition flags </p>

<p>The European Union on Monday led calls for Belarus to immediately release the hundreds of protesters.  </p>

<p>'The EU expects the Belarusian authorities to ensure the immediate release of all detained on political grounds before and after the falsified 9 August presidential elections,' its diplomatic head Josep Borrell said.</p>

<p>'The EU will impose sanctions on individuals responsible for violence, repression and falsification of election results,' he added.</p>

<p>Canada's foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne called 'for the release of people detained including opposition members and journalists.</p>

<p>'The most recent arbitrary arrests of leading opposition voices and acts of repression are unacceptable,' he said.</p>

<p>Tikhanovskaya left the country under pressure from the authorities and was granted refuge by EU member Lithuania.</p>

<p>'The more they try to scare us, the more people will take to the streets,' Tikhanovskaya said in a statement.</p>

<p>Lukashenko (pictured in Minsk last week) is facing the biggest challenge to his rule since taking power in the ex-Soviet republic in 1994 </p>

<p>Police on Sunday appeared to be stepping up a campaign to quash the demonstrations, deploying troops, water cannon and armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>Local media reported hooded men in civilian clothes with batons chased and beat demonstrators. </p>

<p>Belarusian authorities had already detained several members of the Coordination Council and others have left the country under official pressure. </p>

<p>One, Olga Kovalkova, said on Saturday she was in Poland after security services threatened her and took her to the border.</p>

<p>Kolesnikova and other members including Nobel Literature Prize winner Svetlana Alexievich have faced questioning in a probe over an alleged bid to seize power.  </p>

<p>Kolesnikova, a trained flautist and music teacher, entered politics to run the campaign of another opposition politician, ex-banker Viktor Babaryko, who attempted to stand for president against Lukashenko but was jailed and barred from running.</p>
