<p>The Red Devils did not want to pay Bayer Leverkusen's asking price and decided to try and sign Sancho from Borussia Dortmund as an alternative. </p>

<p>But Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side did not pay Dortmund's £108m asking price last month and the England winger looks set to stay in the Bundesliga.    </p>

<p>Manchester United turned down the chance to sign Chelsea's new £89million man Kai Havertz</p>

<p>The Red Devils wanted to focus on trying to buy Jadon Sancho instead according to reports</p>

<p>Havertz trained with his new Chelsea team-mates for the first time on Saturday morning after sealing a record move from Bayer Leverkusen on Friday.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old attacking midfielder was this week unveiled as Frank Lampard's latest signing, and Blues coaches were putting him through his paces at Cobham.</p>

<p>The German joins Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Xavier Mbuyamba, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr, Thiago Silva and Havertz in signing for the Blues this summer, taking the club's spending to approximately £230m. </p>

<p>Havertz has revealed the opportunity to work with Frank Lampard had a 'big impact' in his decision to move to Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>'Of course he had a big impact on my decision because I loved him as a player and watched him very often, and I think I can learn from him now he is a manager as well,' Havertz told the official club website. </p>

<p>'I think he is a very humble person and a great guy and I can't wait to play with him and learn from him.</p>

<p>'He was very offensive like me and he loves to score goals, and I love to score goals as well so I think he will help me a lot in my position. Also maybe on the things that I can improve and I can't wait to work with him.'</p>

<p>Havertz's move makes the 21-year-old the joint most expensive player ever signed by a British club, along with Paul Pogba, who joined Manchester United in 2016.</p>

<p>The Germany international registered 18 goals and nine assists in 45 club appearances during the 2019-20 season. </p>

<p>But Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side did not pay Dortmund's £108m asking price last month</p>
