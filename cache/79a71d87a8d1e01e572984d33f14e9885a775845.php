<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Iranian women's rights activist has been arrested in Turkey and threatened with deportation, raising fears she will be tortured or executed.</p>

<p>Maryam Shariatmadari, 35, who fled Iran after taking part in anti-hijab protests, was arrested in the western Turkish city of Dinizli on Monday and taken to a detention centre for undocumented migrants.</p>

<p>In a video taken from the back of a police van and posted on her Instagram page, Maryam said she had been threatened with deportation by officers who questioned her right to be in the country.</p>

<p>'This is without cause. My name is in the system but they are refusing to check it,' she told her followers.</p>

<p>'They're about to send us for deportation. If there is anything you can do, please do it,' she added.</p>

<p>Her pleas caught the attention of human rights activists in both Iran and Turkey, who began campaigning for her release. </p>

<p>Many of them retweeted the video along with messages saying she faces 'possible torture and execution' if she is returned to Iran. </p>

<p>Maryam was arrested in Iran in 2018 after taking part in anti-hijab protests in the capital Tehran, spending four days in solitary confinement.</p>

<p>After being charged with violating national security she fled to Turkey, where she claimed asylum.</p>

<p>Turkey is home to dozens of Iranians who fled amid fears of persecution, though they are often not recognised as refugees, meaning their legal status is unsettled.</p>

<p>Activists fear that Shariatmadari, who took part in anti-hijab protests in 2018, will be tortured and possibly executed if she is taken back to Iran where she faces 'national security' charges</p>

<p>After spending a night in police custody, Maryam revealed on Tuesday that she had been freed and had been granted official refugee status.</p>

<p>However, she told The Independent that she had also faced pressure from police to sign papers promising to leave the country within weeks. </p>

<p>Gokhan Bozkurt, president of the Aydin Bar Association, which has been following her case, said: 'She is free now.</p>

<p>'The government might try to hand her over to Iranian authorities. But we lawyers are going to try to keep her in Turkey if she doesn't want to go to Iran.'</p>

<p>Maryam was part of a group of protesters who became known as 'the girl of Revolution Street' after the road in Tehran where they removed their headscarves during repeated demonstrations.</p>

<p>Shariatmadari (pictured) said police pressured her to sign papers agreeing to leave Turkey, before releasing her as international pressure mounted</p>

<p>The movement began in December 2017 but prompted many copycat protests, including one staged by Maryam in February the following year  </p>

<p>Video showed her protesting on top of an electrical box before being shoved to the ground by police, which friends said left her needing knee surgery.</p>

<p>Hijabs have been compulsory in Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979.</p>

<p>Maryam was initially charged with 'encouraging corruption by removing her hijab' and sentenced to a year in jail.</p>

<p>However, she was then re-arrested on national security charges as police seized her computer and arrested some of the lawyers representing her.</p>

<p>While out on bail she managed to flee to Turkey, where she now lives. </p>
