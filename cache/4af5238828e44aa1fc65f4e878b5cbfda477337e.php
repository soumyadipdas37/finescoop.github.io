<p>Her candid admission came shortly before Bella praised Network 10 - which screens both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette - in a series of posts on Instagram Stories.</p>

<p>'A big thank you to my Channel 10 family (you know who you are) for making me smile through the tough parts of last night,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'I know that you can genuinely find love on The Bachelor or Bachelorette. I genuinely did fall in love with Locky [Gilbert] and I mean, if the way I find my happily ever after is having to make one of them end up saying yes to me at the end, I guess maybe that's my way in,' she said.</p>

<p>'I don't know, it would be nice. I have been one of the girls, I think I'd have empathy with how they are feeling and being in that position.'  </p>

<p>Bella was left shell-shocked during Thursday's Bachelor finale when Locky, 31, told both her and love rival Irena Srbinovska he loved them - only to dump her. </p>

<p>'I just don't know if I can see us working,' Locky Gilbert told Bella, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me'</p>

<p>He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.</p>

<p>'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.</p>

<p>'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.' </p>
