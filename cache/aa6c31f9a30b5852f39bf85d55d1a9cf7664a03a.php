<p>Fine: The energy regulator punished the provider for failing to publish information that is likely to have pushed up wholesale electricity costs</p>

<p>SSE said in February 2016 that it was going to shut three out of four units at Fiddler's Ferry, a coal-fired power plant in Cheshire. </p>

<p>A week before the April 1 closing date, it signed a deal with National Grid that would keep the site on line. </p>

<p>But it was not until the day before the units had been meant to shut down that SSE told the market. </p>

<p>This resulted in four days' trading without the market knowing that more electricity was likely to be available than it was thought. SSE said it acted in 'good faith'.</p>
