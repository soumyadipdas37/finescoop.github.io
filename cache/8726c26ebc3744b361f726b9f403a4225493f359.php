<p>'You do get the occasional twonk, so to the guy yesterday who said I had 'big fat legs', babes, I've been training these legs for seven years. This s**t don't wobble, and I guarantee I could deadlift or squat your entire body weight, my love.</p>

<p>'So things just got really awkward, really fast, didn't they? God bless ya, darling. Find the light, come on.'  </p>
