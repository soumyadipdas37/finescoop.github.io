<p>A council spokesman said that no background or police check was conducted prior to the man's initial hiring, but once they were tipped off, his duties were changed and supervision applied.</p>

<p>'Once the (council) became aware of (his) previous conviction in May 2020, we treated the matter extremely seriously and took immediate action, including seeking advice from the relevant authorities,' the spokesman said. </p>

<p>The man's colleagues had questioned senior staff members about his employment after an online search found pornography charges back from 2014 for someone with the same name. </p>

<p>The council took immediate action and implemented new rules for the convicted paedophile.  </p>

<p>'We followed the advice we were given and put in place an appropriate plan (including the requirement that the officer always worked under supervision at public locations in a team, alongside another officer),' the spokesman said. </p>

<p>'(His) duties do not involve any supervision of children or direct interaction with any children or young people,' the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The man was hired as a gardener by a Perth council which allows him at playgrounds which are filled with kids (stock)</p>

<p>While the council insists the public's safety is of the 'utmost importance', the man is still employed by the council. </p>

<p>Photographs taken by The West Australian showed the sick paedophile within 50m of schools twice in the past month.   </p>

<p>Following an international police sting, the man was found to have paid a total of $2,350 to have abusive material sent to him, showing boys as young as six tied up. </p>

<p>He was arrested and was found with more than 5,600 images in his possession and 153 videos. </p>

<p>The man spent four years in jail after pleading guilty to his role in the webcam ring, and the judge noted it was his first offence.</p>
