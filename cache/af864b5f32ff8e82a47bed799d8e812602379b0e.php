<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Children who have previously caught the common cold have coronavirus antibodies that prevent them from developing the hyper-inflammatory condition called MIS-C, new research suggests.  </p>

<p>The rare disease is caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the same pathogen responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Research has found the condition, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), is different to both COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease. </p>

<p>However, little is known about why some children, roughly a month after being infected with the coronavirus, develop MIS-C symptoms. </p>

<p>Indicators of the disease include a rash, fever and abdominal pain as well as conjunctivitis, a cough and a headache. </p>

<p>Experts at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden compared healthy children with youngsters suffering from MIS-C and Kawasaki disease.  </p>

<p>Blood tests of 13 MIS-C-patients, 28 Kawasaki disease patients and uninfected children revealed the MIS-C cohort lack antibodies against the common cold. </p>

<p>Researchers say it is possible antibodies obtained after infection with the common cold could play a role in controlling the development of MIS-C.  </p>

<p>Experts at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden compared healthy children with youngsters suffering from MIS-C and Kawsaki disease. Pictured, symptoms of both diseases </p>

<p>Bertie Brown was admitted to Worcestershire Royal hospital earlier this year on his second birthday after developing a fever and rash across his body which is thought to have been MIS-C</p>

<p>The researchers looked for evidence of antibodies to the coronaviruses HKU1 and betacoronavirus 1, both of which cause what we know as the common cold. </p>

<p>Unlike children with Kawasaki disease and children with mild COVID-19, children who developed MIS-C were lacking antibodies to these mild coronaviruses. </p>

<p>Dr Petter Brodin, lead author of the study, told MailOnline there is currently no way to verify the theory that immunity to the common cold via antibodies offers protection against MIS-C, but it appears this may be the case. </p>

<p>'The fact that immunity to common cold coronavirus is usually quite short lived, and the fact that MIS-C typically affects teenagers, and the finding that MIS-C patients were the only group lacking these common cold coronavirus-antibodies, all suggest it is possible that having such antibodies might protect against MIS-C,' he said. </p>

<p>He believes common cold CoV antibodies and the memory B-cells that produce them may recognise SARS-CoV-2 virus and bind to it. </p>

<p>'Such events will give the immune system a head start in defending against the virus and might enable a more efficient antibody response that directly zooms in on the right parts of the new virus to neutralise it,' he adds. </p>

<p>MIS-C is a form of toxic shock syndrome which causes the body's immune system to attack its own organs. It is believed to be caused by infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 </p>

<p>Another finding of the study is that there are several antibodies present in MIS-C patients that attack the body's own proteins, a process known as a cytokine storm. </p>

<p>This form of immune self-sabotage is believed to be a major contributor to severe cases of MIS-C.    </p>

<p>However, while both illnesses are worsened by a cytokine storm, the processes are different for MIS-C and Covid-19.    </p>

<p>Scientists are unable to explain why adults tend to develop COVID-19 while children are more inclined to be struck with MIS-C, despite being caused by the same virus.</p>

<p>It is believed the hyper-inflammatory condition is a delayed immune response to the infection, rendering traditional throat and nose swabs redundant.</p>

<p>As a result, antibody testing is one of the only reliable ways to ascertain and diagnose the symptoms.  </p>

<p>As the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kawasaki-like condition was emerging and increasing in frequency. </p>

<p>Little is known about MIS-C, except it is rare, caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has symptoms similar, but not identical, to Kawasaki disease. </p>

<p>It almost exclusively affects children or young adults, in contrast to COVID-19 which rarely harms the young. </p>

<p>It emerged earlier this year with parents sharing heart-wrenching images of their children in hospital covered in bright red rashes. </p>

<p>In May, during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, doctors in America said the inflammatory condition could be affecting adults in their early 20s. </p>

<p>Although fatalities from MIS-C are very rare, they have been recorded. A 14-year-old boy in London died from the disease. and at least four reported deaths in the US.     </p>

<p>MailOnline reported in May that Birmingham-based researchers had found the first proof the Kawasaki-like condition, later named MIS-C, was caused by SARS-CoV-2. </p>

<p>This was confirmed in August when academics at  King's College London published a peer-reviewed study confirming the relationship. </p>

<p>Dr Manu Shankar-Hari, co-author of the August research, told MailOnline: 'There is no diagnostic test for Kawasaki disease or MIS-C.</p>

<p>'There are shared clinical features. Thus, best thing to do is to seek medical advice, if your child is unwell.</p>

<p>'This research highlights that, unlike Kawasaki disease, MIS-C is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with different clinical and immune findings.'</p>

<p>The inflammatory condition affecting children during the pandemic is linked to infection with the coronavirus, a peer-reviewed study confirms. </p>

<p>Researchers at King's College London discovered the illness, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), is different to Kawasaki disease. </p>

<p>The disease can manifest itself as a rash, fever and abdominal pain and is connected to previous infection with the same virus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes COVID-19.  </p>

<p>COVID-19 has to date killed almost three-quarters of a million people worldwide. </p>

<p>Scientists are unable to explain why adults tend to develop COVID-19 while children are more inclined to be struck with MIS-C, despite being caused by the same virus. </p>

<p>It is believed the hyper-inflammatory condition is a delayed immune response to the infection, rendering traditional throat and nose swabs redundant. </p>

<p>But more than two-thirds (68 per cent) of children in the latest study tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, proving they had been infected in the past. </p>
