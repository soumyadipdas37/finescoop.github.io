<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has finally put pen to paper on a bumper new Arsenal contract in what is a major boost for manager Mikel Arteta's rebuilding project.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old has signed terms until 2023 worth an initial £250,000-a-week but bonuses included in the contract can take it beyond the £350,000-a-week paid to highest earner Mesut Ozil.</p>

<p>'It's finally done, I am really really happy to be staying here,' Aubameyang said. 'This is my home. It's a great day. I want to become an Arsenal legend and leave a legacy. It's the time to work a lot but for sure I will give my best, as always.'  </p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has agreed a new three-year contract to remain at Arsenal</p>

<p>Aubameyang was coy over his long-term Arsenal future after their FA Cup win this year</p>

<p>But Mikel Arteta has convinced his star striker that his long-term future belongs at Arsenal</p>

<p>Arsenal streamed a live video of Aubameyang on the Emirates pitch to confirm the news and the striker face-timed Ian Wright to celebrate.</p>

<p>'Thank you for signing,' Wright said. 'Others have left us in the past but you stayed when we needed you most.' </p>

<p>Aubameyang joined Arsenal in January 2018 in a £56m move from Borussia Dortmund and has scored a stunning 72 goals in 112 games. </p>

<p>And since Arteta took over as Arsenal manager in December last year, Aubameyang has been in electrifying form.</p>

<p>He led the Gunners to FA Cup glory which in turn landed them with a place in this season's Europa League. He also scored a stunning goal in Arsenal's Community Shield win over Liverpool and found the net in their victory over Fulham on the opening day of the Premier League.</p>

<p>But at the end of the 2019-20 season, Aubameyang was coy over his long-term Arsenal future and wanted to see an ambitious summer of recruitment with Arteta at the helm.</p>

<p>Speaking after he scored twice in Arsenal's 2-1 FA Cup final victory over Chelsea, he said: 'I'm really not thinking about this. I just want to enjoy this with the guys and take the trophy.' </p>

<p>But Arteta has indeed overseen a bold summer in north London - Arsenal swooped for Willian on a free transfer from London rivals Chelsea and also signed defender Gabriel Magaljaes from Lille.</p>

<p>Dani Ceballos has also rejoined on a season-long loan from Real Madrid while players such as David Luiz and Bukayo Saka have signed new contracts at Arsenal.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old Aubameyang has made an outstanding start to Arsenal's 2020-21 season</p>

<p>He even teased the announcement on Tuesday, tweeting a picture of an hourglass</p>

<p>But it is Aubameyang's decision to remain at Arsenal that is the jewel in the crown of Arteta's summer work.</p>

<p>He even teased the announcement on Tuesday morning, tweeting a picture of an hourglass to send Arsenal fans into raptures. </p>

<p>Arteta's men are next in Premier League action in Saturday's late game against West Ham. </p>
