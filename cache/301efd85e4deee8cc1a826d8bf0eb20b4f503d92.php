<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tracksuit and trainers retailer JD Sports is continuing its battle with landlords, despite its half-year sales barely being touched by the pandemic.</p>

<p>Revenues dipped just 6.5 per cent in the six months to August 1, as its focus on 'athleisure' hit the spot.</p>

<p>Executive chairman Peter Cowgill credited demand from younger customers, who wanted to 'get out and socialise', for keeping sales above the levels seen at other fashion chains.</p>

<p>Rent battle: Revenues at tracksuit and trainers retailer dipped just 6.5 per cent in the six months to August 1, as its focus on 'athleisure' hit the spot</p>

<p>But JD, which also owns Go Outdoors, Blacks Leisure and Millets, is refusing to cut landlords any slack – by withholding rent on its 390 UK stores to draw landlords into negotiations to cut rent.</p>

<p>Cowgill said of the fight: 'Some people say it's like wading through treacle but it's thicker than that. </p>

<p>It's amazing that there has not been a recognition of the channel shifts that are occurring.'</p>

<p>Customers are increasingly shopping online rather than in stores and many city centres are now quieter than ever.</p>

<p>Profit slid to £41.5million in the six months to August, from £129.9million over the same period in 2019.</p>

<p>Shares jumped up 9.8 per cent, or 71.2p, to 705.8p yesterday.</p>
