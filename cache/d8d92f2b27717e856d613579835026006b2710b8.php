<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The grieving parents of a teenager who disappeared 22 years ago have issued a desperate public plea to find her body.  </p>

<p>Rachel Antonio, 16, vanished without a trace after being dropped off at a cinema by her mother in Bowen, in northern Queensland, on Anzac Day 1998. </p>

<p>Surf lifesaver Robert Hytch, then 25, was charged with her murder a year later and found guilty by a jury of the lesser offence of manslaughter - but was acquitted at a retrial in 2001.</p>

<p>Through each trial and re-trial, Mr Hytch consistently denied being in a relationship with the 16-year-old. But a coroner found in 2016 he had lied and the pair had been in an 'intimate relationship'.</p>

<p>Rachel's parents Ian and Cheryl Antonio have issued a desperate public plea to find her body</p>

<p>Coroner David O’Connell also found Mr Hytch fatally injured the teenager and hid her body, which has never been found. </p>

<p>Rachel's parents Ian and Cheryl Antonio are begging those responsible for answers. </p>

<p>'We're not after revenge of anything like that. We just want the whole truth and nothing but the truth,' Mr Antonio told Nine News.</p>

<p>'And we want the body, so we can put the body to rest. There are people that do know [where the body is] and we just wish they'd come forward and let us know.</p>

<p>The couple fear they will die without being able to give Rachel a proper burial.</p>

<p>'We don't think anybody's going to come clean,' he said. 'I don't think the police can do anything, I really don't.'</p>

<p>Ms Antonio added: 'I hope I do find where she is but I really don't believe that I will.' </p>

<p>A police reward of $250,000 for information leading to the location of Rachel's remains is still on offer. </p>

<p>In the teenager's diary tendered to an inquest, Rachel wrote of how she was scared Mr Hytch, who was the Bowen surf club captain, would break up with her if she didn't sleep with him.</p>

<p>Ian Antonio and wife Cheryl (pictured together at Mr Hytch's Supreme Court challenge of the inquest's findings in 2018)  have previously expressed their pain at not having a resting place for their daughter</p>

<p>'The biggest issue I have in my life right now is whether to do it - or not. Robert and I have been best friends for over two years and have been going out for six months. I can honestly say – I think I love him,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'Although Robert is 24 (almost 25), he is really caring. The only problem I have – is that I’m scared he will dump me afterwards. This shouldn’t really worry me cause he has been with me for six months already. I know he cares about me.'  </p>

<p>The inquest had used the diary as evidence, despite it being ruled inadmissible at trial. </p>

<p>Queensland Police are considering advice from the Office of The Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether Mr Hytch could be charged with perjury.  </p>

<p>'The DPP has concluded its consideration of the matter and it was referred to the Queensland Police Service for their consideration,' a spokeswoman for the Office of The Director of Public Prosecutions told The Courier-Mail in June.  </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia does not suggest Mr Hytch is guilty of any crime, only that police are considering the advice from the DPP about the possibility of laying perjury charges.</p>

<p>Mr Hytch appealed the coroner's findings and has always denied any involvement in her disappearance.  </p>

<p>Two men who came across Rachel on the night of her disappearance on the town's Queens Beach said at inquest she told them 'I'm waiting for my boyfriend'.</p>

<p>Coroner O'Connell meanwhile found Mr Hytch had left his brother's birthday party to hire a movie that night and was unable to account for a half-an-hour discrepancy in his movements.</p>

<p>The teenager's diary was tendered to an inquest (pictured as evidence) and formed the basis of a coroner's finding that the man acquitted of her manslaughter, Robert Hytch, had lied about his relationship with her</p>

<p>Police also found a tiny drop of blood on his sandal.</p>

<p>The inquest found the young girl was likely killed by the surf lifesaver - an outcome unsuccessfully challenged in 2018 by Mr Hytch in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Ian Antonio and wife Cheryl said in 2015 it was difficult not having a resting place for their daughter - as was coming to terms with the realisation they may never know what happened to her.</p>
