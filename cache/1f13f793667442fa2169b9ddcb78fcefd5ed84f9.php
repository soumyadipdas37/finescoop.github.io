<p>Katie, who was on holiday with her boyfriend Carl and her children Princess , 13, and Junior, 15, at the time, said doctors told her they have amputated legs with injuries similar to hers. </p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, she said: 'The doctors said I'm lucky I'm not dead. I could have hit my head and I could have been paralysed, I am actually lucky I landed on my feet.' </p>

<p>She added: 'I thought, "I'm never going to walk again". The doctors said they've cut off legs before after seeing injuries like mine.' </p>

<p>Katie underwent an eight-hour operation to rebuild her feet after she was 'mucking about' following a few drinks and jumped off what she thought was a 'small wall' at the Land of Legends theme park. </p>

<p>The model revealed how she has returned to The Priory because her 'mental health' has been 'badly affected' by her injuries.  </p>

<p>Katie, who is also mother to Harvey, 18, Jett, seven, and Bunny, six, explained how she is 'embarrassed' of having to be pushed around and told how people treat her 'differently'.   </p>

<p>She explained how she 'feels sorry' for boyfriend Carl who has doted on her since the accident and said that it is 'demoralising' seeing him push her in the wheelchair.</p>

<p>Take a break: The-mother-of-five announced last week that she was following doctor's orders and taking a break from social media to heal following the horrific injuries</p>

<p>'It was filmed prior to her hiatus.' </p>

<p>The star posted a statement to Instagram Stories last month which read: 'Katie is taking some time out of the media spotlight. </p>

<p>Katie's representative told MailOnline: 'Katie is taking a much needed break. Katie has found the past few weeks terribly draining, both mentally and physically challenging and in order to bounce back is convalescing.'  </p>
