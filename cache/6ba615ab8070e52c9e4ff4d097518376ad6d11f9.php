<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Southgate hailed ‘beautiful’ Phil Foden as he prepares to hand the Manchester City youngster his England debut tomorrow.</p>

<p>It is understood Southgate is giving serious consideration to starting the 20-year-old midfielder as England start their UEFA Nations League campaign in Iceland. </p>

<p>Southgate has looked at using Foden alongside Declan Rice and James Ward-Prowse in a three-man midfield in training at St George’s Park ahead of tomorrow's match — England’s first in 11 months. </p>

<p>Phil Foden (centre) could be set to make his first England start against Iceland on Saturday</p>

<p>Gareth Southgate has praised the 20-year-old star ahead of England's Nations League game</p>

<p>The England manager said: ‘We are conscious that he’s a hugely exciting talent and we didn’t want to expose that too early.</p>

<p>‘But now we felt at the end of the season and post lockdown he had a really good run of games.</p>

<p>‘You could see that physically he had adapted. I think it’s time to give him his head and we see him being with us moving forward. </p>

<p>'Nothing I have seen this week would suggest in any way that that’s not going to be the case. He’s a beautiful player to watch.’</p>

<p>Southgate has also confirmed he plans to hold a three-way audition for the position as first-choice goalkeeper ahead of next year’s European Championship.</p>

<p>Current first-choice Jordan Pickford appears to have got the nod tomorrow evening, but Nick Pope and Dean Henderson will have the opportunity to stake their claim.</p>

<p>Southgate is considering starting Foden alongside Declan Rice and James Ward-Prowse</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday how Pickford’s position as first-choice was under threat and Southgate said: ‘Everybody puts more emphasis on a change in the goalkeeping position than any other.</p>

<p>‘We would be more than comfortable with any of the three in goal and it is a big season for all of them in different ways and there will be that competition through the season.’</p>

<p>Kyle Walker is set to start at right back after being handed a recall.</p>

<p>Joe Gomez and Eric Dier look likely to start at centre back, and Kieran Trippier and Ainsley Maitland-Niles are vying for the nod at left back.</p>

<p>Captain Harry Kane is expected to be flanked by Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho. </p>
