<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fashion giant River Island has been blasted by parents for selling 'sexy' tight leather trousers for children as young as five.</p>

<p>The retailer was accused of 'sexualising children' after the range of black leatherette trousers was spotted on display in the kid's section of the store and online.</p>

<p>Angry mums have deemed the clothing 'highly inappropriate' and accused River Island of 'stripping the innocence away from kids.'</p>

<p>Some have now demanded River Island pull them from stock after one grandmother brought the matter to light while shopping with her daughter in Worcester.</p>

<p>Helen Richards, 60, had been browsing the aisles for an outfit for her nine-year-old granddaughter on Tuesday when she noticed the trousers on display.</p>

<p>Ms Richards, of Worcester, said: 'Why are they sexualising children? Why do they feel the need to put leather trousers for parents to buy for their child?</p>

<p>'It's so wrong, especially in this day and age. We shouldn't encourage our children to dress like that.</p>

<p>'There's more than one way to take away a child's innocence. I am so angry.'</p>

<p>The gran-of-seven said the £12.99 leatherette trousers were available to buy from aged five to age 12.</p>

<p>A pair of trousers from the range in question, purchased at River Island for £18, sized five-years</p>

<p>The trousers were seen by some parents to be 'tasteless' while others said that parents shouldn't assume everything is 'sexually motivated'</p>

<p>Ms Richards, who was shopping with her 33-year-old daughter Alison, added: 'It was the first time I have been shopping in months.</p>

<p>'I was shopping with my daughter who was looking for an outfit for her daughter.</p>

<p>'She pointed at these trousers, and I was so shocked. I am usually the one who mentions this sort of thing.'</p>

<p>Ms Richards said she was particularly concerned because of recent fears about a kidnap gang approaching children in Worcester.</p>

<p>She said: 'I thought I am not going to be one of those people who ignore it, especially with so much going on in Worcester at the moment.</p>

<p>'That sort of thing makes me think speak out. There are other options of clothes for children to wear.</p>

<p>'I was tempted to say something to the staff but it's not their fault.</p>

<p>'I think River Island should remove the clothing from their store immediately. I'm also worried the clothes might attract unwanted attention.</p>

<p>'Young people can't deal with that and it can take away their childhood.'</p>

<p>Other mums and dads flocked to social media with some urging parents to boycott the store.</p>

<p>Sally Wright wrote on Facebook: 'Who would want their children walking around like Kim Kardashian in leather pants? We should boycott the place until they are removed.'</p>

<p>Carlie Brown added: 'This is highly inappropriate and another example of our kids innocence being stripped away. Shame on River Island.'</p>

<p>Terri Hopcroft put: 'I'm all for children's fashion but please let kids be kids. Wouldn't dream of letting my two-year-old daughter run around in tight fitting trousers.'</p>

<p>Ally Moore said: 'Personally, I like to see children dressed like children. Pvc leggings on a little girl... a bit much.'</p>

<p>Others leapt to the defence of the store with Nicola Long saying: 'What's worrying is how adults are pushing their idea on everything being sexually motivation.</p>

<p>'It's a pair of trousers, how you see them says more about you.'</p>

<p>Jade Charlotte commented: 'No need to get angry, just don't buy them. If everyone thinks they're tasteless and doesnt buy them, then they'll stop making them.</p>

<p>'I dont particularly like them as I dont think it's a good look for most adults either. But I can't make that decision for other people!</p>

<p>'Basically, worry about what your own children are wearing, not other people's.'</p>
