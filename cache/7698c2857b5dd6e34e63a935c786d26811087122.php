<p>'No, no, just even hearing the words, I mean Byron was already teetering and now it's gone... that's terrible news,' Ed began. </p>

<p>He added that he's worried that Byron will soon be inundated with Hollywood stars if Zac moves there permanently. </p>

<p>Also living in the idyllic town is Hollywood heavyweight Chris Hemsworth and his wife Elsa Pataky, who live in a $20million mansion.  </p>

<p>'Because where one goes, they all follow,' Ed said. </p>

<p>His radio co-host Dave Hughes supported Zac, saying he wants the celebs in town.</p>

<p>'I want them there,' Dave said.  </p>

<p>Ed continued, saying that celebrities will push prices in the area through the roof and locals will have trouble getting into venues if stars are in town.  </p>

<p>'It's already expensive, prices will go through the roof, you'll try and go to a cafe and they'll be like, "sorry, not today" and there's four people in there and it'll be Efron and his buddies and someone else,' Ed said. </p>

<p>Dave argued that Zac 'blends in,' and finished: 'He wants to hang out in Australia and live a real life and I'm here for it.'  </p>

<p>Zac, who has been living in Byron Bay for months, is said to be dating local Vanessa Valladares. </p>

<p>Zac reportedly met Vanessa in July when she was working as a waitress in Byron Bay, at the Byron Bay General Store café.  </p>

<p>She's rumoured to have quit her job now and is said to be staying with Zac at Belongil Beach.</p>

<p>New flame? Zac, who has been living in Byron Bay for months, is said to be dating local Vanessa Valladares (pictured). Zac reportedly met Vanessa in July when she was working as a waitress in Byron Bay, at the Byron Bay General Store café</p>

<p>The pair have even enjoyed a ski trip in Thredbo together.</p>

<p>Last month, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source revealed. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.' </p>

<p>Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months ago in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.</p>

<p>But it seems his request to have his tourist visa extended from three months to 12 months was granted, hence why he cancelled his trip home.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands Zac received a last-minute refund for his ticket.</p>

<p>He's also reportedly been looking at properties in the area to purchase. </p>
