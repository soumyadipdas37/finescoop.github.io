<p>Winners: Phillip Schofield took a friendly jibe at Piers Morgan after This Morning beat Good Morning Britain to win a TV Choice Award</p>

<p>Alison made the announcement, taking the award out of the oven as she informed viewers there was no ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>She said: 'This Morning has won a TV Choice Award for Best Daytime TV show everyone. It’s in the oven. </p>

<p>'Because of Covid, there’s no award show or anything. This is the fifth one we’ve won now. We’ve beat GMB, Piers Morgan, Loose Women, The Chase.</p>

<p>Holly added: 'And we do like this award because it’s voted for by the readers.'</p>

<p>Hard luck: With fellow ITV series Good Morning Britain also up for the award, Phillip couldn't resist saying: 'Thank you, sorry Piers!' after his win.</p>

<p>Alison admitted she thought This Morning won the prize due to their coverage of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>

<p>She said: 'This is due to Covid why we’ve got this and we do deserve it. We do.'</p>

<p>It comes after Piers' co-host Susanna Reid called him a 'chubster', after he revealed he had put on half a stone on in lockdown.</p>

<p>Piers, 55, encouraged his co-host, 49, to fat-shame him live on Good Morning Britain on Monday, so he could use the insults as motivation to shed the pounds.</p>

<p>Gong: Alison Hammond made the announcement, taking the award out of the oven as she informed viewers there was no ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Susanna, who admitted she had put on a stone over the past couple of months, called the columnist: 'You fat person'.</p>

<p>Piers said: 'Like a lot of people in lockdown, especially when you bust your ankle up, I have put on weight.</p>

<p>'I am carrying too much weight. I reckon I put on at least half a stone, three quarters of a stone. I need to be fat-shamed to get it off.' </p>

<p>Taking the bait, Susanna told him: 'Yes, you fat person, lose the weight. It's about time, chubster.' </p>

<p>Holly added: 'And we do like this award because it’s voted for by the readers'</p>

<p>While Piers said the insults would help him lose the weight, Susanna said: 'That brings me out in hives just saying that.'</p>

<p>To which the Britain's Got Talent judge told her: 'No, that will genuinely have the right affect on me.</p>

<p>'I will go back today and probably eat a little less cheese and put the second bottle away and try to get back on the Peloton for the first time in a few months.</p>

<p>'I think we all need to be slightly shamed about weight.'</p>

<p>But Susanna disagreed and told him: 'No, I don't think shaming works. Sensible advice works. Throwing insults does not help people lose weight.'</p>

<p>Piers shouted: 'No, saying "stop chunking up fatso and eating so many cakes", that works. That's what you need to be told.'</p>
