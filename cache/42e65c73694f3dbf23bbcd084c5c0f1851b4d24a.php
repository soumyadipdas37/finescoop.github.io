<p>Britain's rail companies will slash one in ten services with the new autumn timetable as post-lockdown passenger numbers plummet </p>

<p>Operators are focusing resources on commuter and school services, meaning evening and weekend trains will be hardest hit, according to The Sunday Times.  </p>

<p>GWR said it was focusing on providing trains for people getting back to the office, and Sundays will be hardest hit, operating at 76 per cent of the normal timetable.  </p>

<p>CrossCountry Trains, whose routes include Aberdeen to Penzance, will still be running at only 65% of pre-Covid levels.  </p>

<p>The Leeds to Chester route, which ran hourly via Manchester Victoria, will now run only every two hours according to Northern Trains.</p>

<p>Some fast services on weekdays between Bristol and London are not being reinstated for now, being cut from six instead of eight.   </p>

<p>Rail operators have said services were unlikely to rise above 90 per cent until May next year, with few services being restored in the winter timetables.   </p>

<p>The Department for Transport said that it was 'inaccurate and untrue' that they would agree to fewer services operating in the long term. </p>
