<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Space debris — detritus orbiting Earth from satellites — is a growing problem which threatens the future of human space exploration. </p>

<p>To tackle this issue, the Business Secretary Alok Sharma has announced £1million in funding, via the UK Space Agency (UKSA), for seven space-cleaning programmes. </p>

<p>Astronomers are concerned that high-value craft in low-Earth orbit, such as the International Space Station (ISS), could be destroyed by a rogue piece of debris. </p>

<p>Currently, there is no way of accurately monitoring and tracking small pieces of debris which could be hurtling towards a multi-million pound satellite.</p>

<p>This infographic reveals which countries owns the most space debris. It reveals Russia is responsible for 14,403 pieces and the US comes in second with 8,734</p>

<p>Lumi Space </p>

<p>Working on photonic technologies to spot items in orbit and tell if they are junk or satellite.   </p>

<p>Deimos </p>

<p>This project focuses on the design, prototyping and demonstration of a Low-Cost Low-Earth Orbit Optical Surveillance Sensor.  </p>

<p>A '40x40 squared degrees one-eye' prototype will be built. </p>

<p>In the final solution, '9 eyes' will be combined.</p>

<p>Lift Me Off </p>

<p>Project will create an AI-powered algorithm that can differentiate between junk and actual satellites.  </p>

<p>D-Orbit UK </p>

<p>Tweak and repurpose existing sensors to spot and identify objects moving around a spacecraft. </p>

<p>Fujitsu and Amazon </p>

<p>Fujitsu and Amazon  will develop machine-learning methods to integrate planning for space debris into existing missions. </p>

<p>Mr Sharma said this will improve the commercial viability of missions that seek to remove debris.</p>

<p>NORSS </p>

<p>The project will rapidly design and deploy an extremely low-cost prototype optical camera system to track objects in Low Earth Orbit. </p>

<p>Andor </p>

<p>Will make 'significant improvements' to Andor's existing Balor very large area (17 megapixel / 70mm diagonal) scientific CMOS camera.</p>

<p>The proposed project will significantly increase Balor's sensitivity resulting in considerably faster imaging and/or enabling the tracking of smaller in-orbit debris.</p>

<p>It is believed there are around 160million pieces of debris floating around Earth, trapped in our planet's gravity and travelling at 18,000mph.</p>

<p>Of these, almost one million are believed to be larger than 1cm. If one of these were to collide with a satellite the damage would be devastating. </p>

<p>Not only would it destroy the craft, it would likely set off a chain reaction, seeing innumerable satellites knocked out of action. </p>

<p>This would have catastrophic implications for life on Earth, as modern society relies on satellite services for GPS, mobile communications and weather forecasting. </p>

<p>'Millions of pieces of space junk orbiting the earth present a significant threat to UK satellite systems which provide the vital services that we all take for granted - from mobile communications to weather forecasting,' says Business Secretary Alok Sharma. </p>

<p>He told The Telegraph that action to clean up space must be taken now, before it is too late. </p>

<p>'If we don't take action now, low-Earth orbit could become too perilous for satellites or even humans on the International Space Station,' he said. </p>

<p>Currently, there is no way to remove space debris, and only the biggest items in orbit can be spotted. </p>

<p>It is hoped the £1million funding will help make this possible from the UK. </p>

<p>It has been allocated to seven different projects, each with a unique pan to improve our understanding of our mucky orbit. </p>

<p>One project, dubbed 'Life Me Off', will create an AI-powered algorithm that can differentiate between junk and actual satellites. </p>

<p>Another, called Lumi Space, will use lasers to track and map the objects. </p>

<p>These seven made the cut from a total of 26 proposals, the UKSA says.  </p>

<p>Graham Turnock, Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency said: 'People probably do not realise just how cluttered space is.</p>

<p>'You would never let a car drive down a motorway full of broken glass and wreckages, and yet this is what satellites and the Space Station have to navigate every day in their orbital lanes.</p>

<p>'In this new age of space megaconstellations the UK has an unmissable opportunity to lead the way in monitoring and tackling this space junk. </p>

<p>'This funding will help us grasp this opportunity and in doing so create sought after expertise and new high skill jobs across the country.' </p>

<p>To tackle the issue of space debris, the Business Secretary Alok Sharma (pictured on Monday arriving in Downing Street)  has announced £1million in funding, via the UK Space Agency (UKSA), for seven space-cleaning programmes.</p>

<p>While the government funding will help astronomers identify space junk and avoid collisions, plans are also afoot to actively remove space debris. </p>

<p>Swiss firm ClearSpace received the go-ahead from ESA for a £100million mission to build a space 'tow truck' designed to remove dead satellites from Earth's orbit.</p>

<p>British engineers at aviation giant Airbus created a space harpoon that could help capture rogue satellites and pull them back down to Earth.</p>

<p>The 3ft (95 cm) missile would be fired from a 'hunter-killer' spacecraft, which would pull it – and its prey – back using a cord.</p>

<p>A Russian startup hopes a foam-spewing spacecraft that catches debris like a spider web and tosses them into Earth's atmosphere to burn up could be the solution. </p>

<p>StartRocket is developing a ‘Foam Debris Catcher,’ which is a series of small and autonomous satellites that collects and de-orbits space junk using a sticky polymer foam.</p>

<p>There are an estimated 170 million pieces of so-called 'space junk' - left behind after missions that can be as big as spent rocket stages or as small as paint flakes - in orbit alongside some US$700 billion (£555bn) of space infrastructure.</p>

<p>But only 22,000 are tracked, and with the fragments able to travel at speeds above 16,777 mph (27,000kmh), even tiny pieces could seriously damage or destroy satellites.</p>

<p>However, traditional gripping methods don't work in space, as suction cups do not function in a vacuum and temperatures are too cold for substances like tape and glue.</p>

<p>Grippers based around magnets are useless because most of the debris in orbit around Earth is not magnetic.</p>

<p>Around 500,000 pieces of human-made debris (artist's impression) currently orbit our planet, made up of disused satellites, bits of spacecraft and spent rockets</p>

<p>Most proposed solutions, including debris harpoons, either require or cause forceful interaction with the debris, which could push those objects in unintended, unpredictable directions.</p>

<p>Scientists point to two events that have badly worsened the problem of space junk.</p>

<p>The first was in February 2009, when an Iridium telecoms satellite and Kosmos-2251, a Russian military satellite, accidentally collided.</p>

<p>The second was in January 2007, when China tested an anti-satellite weapon on an old Fengyun weather satellite.</p>

<p>Experts also pointed to two sites that have become worryingly cluttered.</p>

<p>One is low Earth orbit which is used by satnav satellites, the ISS, China's manned missions and the Hubble telescope, among others.</p>

<p>The other is in geostationary orbit, and is used by communications, weather and surveillance satellites that must maintain a fixed position relative to Earth. </p>
