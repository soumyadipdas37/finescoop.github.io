<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Amanda Holden has been promoted to head judge for the Britain's Got Talent semi-finals to fill in for an injured Simon Cowell. </p>

<p>The presenter, 49, will take the prominent position on the judging panel for the semi-finals beginning this weekend, and joked she'd back 'musical theatre all the way,' if she had to make a deciding vote. </p>

<p>Simon, 60, was forced to pull out of BGT after breaking his back during a shock cycling accident, and has been replaced by Diversity star Ashley Banjo. </p>

<p>New job! Amanda Holden, 49, has been promoted to head judge for the Britain's Got Talent semi-finals to fill in for an injured Simon Cowell</p>

<p>Following news of her promotion Amanda told MailOnline: 'I will vote musical theatre all the way if I need to make a deciding vote!'</p>

<p>Sources also told The Sun that Amanda was the obvious choice for bosses to be head judge, given she's appeared on the panel since the show's inception in 2007.</p>

<p>An insider said: 'It makes total sense for Amanda to be head judge with a deciding vote in a deadlock situation.</p>

<p>Exciting: The presenter has landed the prominent position after Simon was forced to pull out of the semi-finals following a bike accident which left him with a broken back</p>

<p>'She's the only one, other than Simon, who has been there since Day One and has seen it all.</p>

<p>'She cannot wait for the responsibility boost and is certainly going to take it in her stride.'</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for Britain's Got Talent for comment.</p>

<p>Sensational: Amanda told MailOnline she'll 'back musical theatre all the way' if she has to make a deciding vote. She's been on the panel since BGT's inception in 2007</p>

<p>Amanda will join regular judges David Walliams and Alesha Dixon, alongside new judge Ashley on the panel for the first semi-final, which will air on Saturday.</p>

<p>For the first time in the show's history, the semi-finals have been pre-recorded to accommodate new measures introduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Simon was forced to pull out after breaking his back in a cycling accident, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. </p>

<p>The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest. </p>

<p>Plans: The BGT semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. The final will then take place live in October</p>

<p>Asked ahead of the show's semi-finals whether he worried the 2020 series was a right off, he said: 'Yeah, for a moment! But then I thought, "Where there’s a will, there’s a way!"</p>

<p>'I just thought that if we can talk to each other all over the world on something like Zoom then there must be a way for us to do the live shows.' </p>

<p>Simon underwent emergency surgery in America after the accident in Los Angeles earlier this month, and has been recovering after having a metal rod installed in his back. </p>

<p>The BGT semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. The final will then take place live in October.</p>

<p>Standing in: Former BGT winner Ashley Banjo will sit in for injured Simon, after he was forced to miss the semi-finals to recover from his back injury</p>

<p>As usual, Ant and Dec will host the semi-finals whilst Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams will join Ashley at the judges’ desk.</p>

<p>Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs.</p>

<p>With safety concerns paramount, some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences’ reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen.</p>

<p>The series will then culminate with the live final, in October, where one act will triumph as Britain’s Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance.</p>

<p>Britain's Got Talent returns on Saturday at 8pm on ITV. </p>
