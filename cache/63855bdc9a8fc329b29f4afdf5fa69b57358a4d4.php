<p>Making history: Boxer Nicola Adams is set to be in the first same-sex pairing on the BBC show</p>

<p>Katya is said to be 'one of the most competitive dancers' and is keen to 'push the boundaries' on the dancefloor, according to the source. </p>

<p>Producers decide the celebrity and professional pairings based on height, according to The Sun. </p>

<p>Katya measures at 5ft 5ins while former professional boxer Nicola stands at 5ft 4ins.   </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Katya told the Sunday Mirror: 'I would love to dance with a woman on the show. I think creatively it would be really interesting and I love coming up with new ideas for stuff. </p>

<p>It was announced this week that Nicola is set to be in the first same-sex pairing on the BBC show, as she said in a statement: 'It's amazing to be a part of the movement for change, diversity and breaking boundaries in the entertainment industry.' </p>

<p>Speaking live from her home on BBC Breakfast, Nicola said of her groundbreaking all-female pairing: 'It's really important, it's a big step for the show as well. It's nice to see we've been able to move on and I just can't wait to get some dancing done really.' </p>

<p>Revealing she approached Strictly with the idea for a same-sex pairing, Nicola explained: 'I asked the show about it. They wanted to know if I wanted to be on the show and I said "yeah I'll do it but I want to dance with another female dance partner.'"</p>

<p>'It's definitely a time for change and time to move on and be more diverse. This is a brilliant step in the right direction. It will be nice for the LGBT community to be able to see that there are same sex couples on the show as well.' </p>

<p>It's over: The couple's six-year marriage ended in 2018 (pictured together in 2019)</p>
