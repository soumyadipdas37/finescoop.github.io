<p>An MS-13 member pleaded guilty in federal court on Wednesday to his role in three murders that shook an Ohio community in 2015 and 2016. </p>

<p>Pedro Alfonso Osorio-Flores, 41,  has become the 19th gang member to formally admit to his crimes and his participation in a racketeering conspiracy in Columbus on behalf of MS-13.</p>

<p>A total of 23 members and associates with the transnational gang were charged in a February 2018 indictment in the Southern District of Ohio.</p>

<p>The original racketeering conspiracy charges included, 'five murders as well as attempted murder, extortion, money laundering, drug trafficking, assault, obstruction of justice, witness intimidation, weapons offenses and immigration-related violations.'</p>

<p>In his plea, Osorio-Flores accepted responsibility for the summer 2015 murder of Carlos Serrano-Ramos, the November 2015 murder of Wilson Villeda and the December 2016 murder of Salvador Martinez-Diaz.</p>

<p>Parties involved in the case have recommended a 40 to 45 year prison sentence</p>

<p>Authorities said Osorio-Flores, also known as 'Smokey,' helped murder 38-year-old Carlos Serrano-Ramos sometime in the summer of 2015.</p>

<p>He and other conspirators beat and stabbed Serrano-Ramos, who was believed to be from a rival gang, before burying his body in a shallow grave at Innis Park.</p>

<p>In November 2015, Osorio-Flores assisted in killing 17-year-old student Wilson Villeda with a machete. He was also believed by MS-13 to be in a rival gang.</p>

<p>Wilson Villeda (pictured), a 17-year-old high school student, was murdered with a machete by MS-13 gang members in December 2015</p>

<p>They buried Villeda's body in a shallow grave near the remains of Serrano-Ramos. Authorities discovered the two bodies later that year.  </p>

<p>The third victim, Salvador Martinez-Diaz, was shot dead by conspirators in December 2016. </p>

<p>Osorio-Flores watched Martinez-Diaz at the Resolute Athletic Complex before following him home. He provided Martinez' Diaz's location to MS-13 members so they could murder him when he arrived home.</p>
