<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Scotland's stricken lower league clubs have been warned that they risk disciplinary proceedings if they kick off the new season and fail to fulfil their fixtures.</p>

<p>Scottish football's Joint Response Group completed emergency divisional meetings with all of the clubs in the pyramid system on Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>And Sportsmail understands the situation in the lower reaches is now so grave that some clubs could run out of money in just five weeks.</p>

<p>Scotland's lower league clubs must fulfil their fixtures or they will risk disciplinary proceedings</p>

<p>Lower league seasons are scheduled to kick off on October 17 behind closed doors with no fans in grounds.</p>

<p>And while the Championship and League One are expected to defy a savage loss of income by starting on schedule, serious concern now exist over clubs below that level.</p>

<p>Both the Highland and Lowland Leagues are set to press the pause button on the new season after one senior source described the financial situation in both leagues as 'carnage.'</p>

<p>A number of League Two clubs have also expressed grave reservations over their ability to struggle on without gate income.</p>

<p>And that prompted league chiefs to warn of possible points deductions if they take a punt on starting the new campaign - then find themselves unable to continue.</p>

<p>Iain McMenemy, chairman of League Two Stenhousemuir, admitted on Friday: 'There are a number of clubs, ourselves included, that are really concerned about the finances.</p>

<p>'I think it's going to be difficult for us all to get through this season without any matchday income from fans.</p>

<p>'However, it was also quite clear that if there is only a couple of clubs who felt they couldn't play then they could be open to potential fines or disciplinary action.</p>

<p>'So clubs are all going into the competition seeking to avoid that.</p>

<p>'It certainly looks like the season will be starting with the Betfred Cup, as per the scheduled fixtures.</p>

<p>'The teams below the Premiership will all be starting in October.</p>

<p>'But, without doubt, there is concern within clubs over the financial impact it is going to have.</p>

<p>'Whilst some will get through it, some will not.</p>

<p>'And even for those that do the financial state they may be in next season remains to be seen.'</p>

<p>Currently government rules stipulate no need for lower league sides to tests players and staff on a compulsory basis.</p>

<p>With cases rising fast across Scotland, however, chairmen are worried that lower league sides could be ordered to follow the Premiership clubs by spending Â£3k a week on swab tests in return for starting the season.</p>

<p>'If testing for lower league clubs becomes compulsory in that is the thing that could push us over the edge,' admits McMenemy.</p>

<p>'It has become quite clear that the Scottish Government advice is that competitive sport can take place without the need to test.</p>

<p>Lower league seasons are scheduled to kick off on October 17 behind closed doors</p>

<p>'Premiership clubs have a different model in place and that is absolutely their prerogative.</p>

<p>'But we are going completely in line with Scottish Government advice that we can play competitive sport without the need to test.</p>

<p>'I'm pretty confident that's the way we will be starting for all the leagues below the Premiership.</p>

<p>'I think the league accept that the government advice is the government advice.'</p>

<p>With clubs across the UK robbed of their main source of income by coronavirus, Scottish sports minister Joe FitzPatrick has requested urgent talks with Westminster counterpart Nigel Huddlestone over a financial recovery package for sport.</p>

<p>Unlikely to be agreed in time to help clubs already struggling McMenemy added: 'Football is the only sector that has been left behind.</p>

<p>'Pubs, restaurants, cinemas, salons, outdoor live events have all now been allowed to open to some degree with the government knowing full well there are risks. Particularly in an indoor environment.</p>

<p>'They have all been given leeway to get some of their customers in, but football has not been given any leeway to get any customers in since the shutdown in March.</p>

<p>'I think it's long overdue that we did get a bit of leeway to prove that we can do things in a socially distanced manner, but it should also be recognised the role that football has in its communities.</p>

<p>'I think there is more chance of money being forthcoming from the UK rather than Scottish Government. But if the UK Government is putting money aside for all football then hopefully that would find its way to Scottish clubs sooner rather than later.'</p>
