<p>Nick Slater, 46, was fatally mauled at about 5pm on Tuesday off popular Greenmount Beach, on the Gold Coast tourist strip, where swimmers are protected by shark netting. </p>

<p>Early analysis of the tooth and the imprint of the animal's jaw on Mr Slater's surfboard revealed it was likely a 3.5m white pointer shark. </p>

<p>Nick Slater, 46, was fatally mauled at about 5pm on Tuesday off popular Greenmount Beach, on the Gold Coast tourist strip, in a rare attack where swimmers are protected by shark netting</p>

<p>A tooth lodged in a surfer's longboard has confirmed he was killed by a white pointer</p>

<p>The tooth left embedded in Mr Slater's surfboard has been taken away for analysis to find out what kind of shark attacked him</p>

<p>A photo of the tooth has been released by the Department of Fisheries, revealing it was 45mm long and 30mm wide. </p>

<p>It comes after Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced a large tiger shark was found tangled in a net off Greenmount Beach just hours after the tragedy.</p>

<p>'Further investigations will be conducted to discover if there is any link between it and the fatal attack,' Palaszczuk told state parliament. </p>

<p>The 46-year-old suffered serious leg injuries and was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene minutes after they arrived. </p>

<p>His death is only the second fatal shark attack at one of Queensland's 85 beaches that have been protected by nets and drum lines since 1962, the state government said.</p>

<p>Before nets were put in place, the last fatal shark attack off a Gold Coast beach - 24 of which are now netted - was in 1958. </p>

<p>Fellow surfer Jade Parker was getting ready to hit the water when he spotted Mr Slater floating motionless next to his board in the line-up.</p>

<p>Mr Parker found the 4cm tooth lodged in Mr Slater's board, which he said was from 'an obvious white pointer'.</p>

<p>'It was a good size bite to the board,' he told Seven Network on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr Parker said the injury stretched from the 'groin area to just below his knee'.  </p>

<p>'It was pretty much all taken... there was nothing there, it was just hanging there by not much,' he said. </p>

<p>'I do not want to get to the gory parts but he was in a bad way. He was not conscious. It looked like he had already pretty much passed away at that point in time.' </p>

<p>Gold Coast chief lifeguard Warren Young told Nine News by the time lifeguards got out to Mr Slater to bring him back to shore he was likely already dead. </p>

<p>Family and friends have flooded social media with tributes to Mr Slater, who has been described as an avid adventurer.</p>

<p>'I'll never forget the look on Dave's face as we found your car last night alone in the car park, confirmation of our worst nightmare,' Mr Slater's good friend Jasmine Robson wrote online. </p>

<p>Thomas Richard Tate, Mayor of the Gold Coast, offered his condolences to Mr Slater's family on Wednesday morning.  </p>

<p>'Last time we've had a shark attack is 1958, over 60 years ago,' he told Today.</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter how long it has been, still a devastating shock to the community of the Gold Coast.' </p>

<p>The mayor said the beaches would remain closed until it is determined the shark is no longer in the vicinity. </p>

<p>Mr Tate said the shark attack was a reminder to all beachgoers to 'look after your mates'.</p>

<p>'I mean really it brings to reality, when we go off the land we go into water, it is the shark's domain,' he said. </p>

<p>He said the attack could damage the region's COVID-19-ravaged tourism industry and urged people wanting to swim to do so north of Burleigh.</p>

<p>'It brings to reality, when we go off the land we go into the water, it is the shark's domain. The danger's there,' he said.</p>

<p>Queensland Lifesaving supervisor Nathan Fife warned swimmers that large fish 'bait balls' and whales migrating south were likely to attract sharks toward the coast.</p>

<p>'Don't swim at dawn or dusk. That is the time marine life is feeding,' he said.</p>

<p>Greenmount Beach is one of several on the Gold Coast that has a shark net. It also has eight drumlines.</p>

<p>Fisheries Minister Mark Furner said they were regularly checked and the government remained committed to the state's shark control program at 86 beaches from the Gold Coast to Cairns.</p>
