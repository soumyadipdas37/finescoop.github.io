<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Manchester United defender Rafael da Silva has mocked Alexis Sanchez after the forward revealed he wanted to leave the Old Trafford club after his first training session. </p>

<p>On Thursday Sanchez posted a video on Instagram explaining what went wrong during his spell as a United player, drawing strong criticism from Rafael.</p>

<p>The Chilean joined the club from Arsenal in January 2018 in a deal which saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan move in the opposite direction, but Sanchez was only able to score five goals in 45 appearances before spending the 2019-20 season on loan at Inter Milan.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old completed a permanent move to the San Siro last month and has since taken to social media to set the record straight.</p>

<p>'I want to tell you about my period at United, about many things that were said and that made me look bad,' said Sanchez.</p>

<p>'I got the opportunity to go to United and it seemed tempting to me. It was something nice for me, because, when I was a kid, I liked that club a lot.</p>

<p>'I ended up signing without much information about what was happening in the move. The first days that I was with my colleagues, sometimes there are things that you do not realise until you arrive.</p>

<p>'The first training I had I realised many things. I came home and I told my representative: 'Can't the contract be terminated to return to Arsenal?'</p>

<p>'They start laughing and I told them that something did not sit right with me. It (the contract) had already been signed.'</p>

<p>Rafael became a popular figure at United during a seven-year spell in which he won nine trophies, and the Brazilian has had his say on the Sanchez interview. </p>

<p>Responding to a Sport Bible Instagram post containing Sanchez's words, Rafael said: 'Maybe he saw a ghost and get scared that's explain why he play so bad every time.' </p>

<p>The right-back's put-down clearly resonated with United fans, gaining 1,500 likes.</p>

<p>Sanchez also implied he became a scapegoat at United, saying: 'I'm telling you my experience, the journalists at times would speak without knowing the facts and it hurt, they had no idea what was going on inside the club,' said Sanchez.</p>

<p>'They said it was my fault, and this, and that, but sometimes a player depends on the environment, the family that is created around him, and I think that in that moment we weren't really a family.</p>

<p>'And that translated onto the pitch, and since there needed to be someone to blame, they blamed me.'</p>
