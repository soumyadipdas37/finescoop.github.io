<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An ex-Comanchero bikie has showed off the five bullet holes in his body as he vows to turn his back on crime for his family. </p>

<p>Vince Focarelli survived six assassination attempts during his life as a gangster but says it was the 2012 murder of his stepson Giovanni Focarelli, 22, in Adelaide that forced him to reassess his life choices. </p>

<p>In a video interview with KiniTV Focarelli said leaving a life of crime could be difficult as it often leads to making 'easy money' as he showed off the wounds to his back, ribs, upper leg and temple. </p>

<p>He said: ‘I was shooting at people, I was getting shot, selling drugs, drinking alcohol, these are not things that you can easily get away from. </p>

<p>The former bikie spent time behind bars for multiple offences including possession of a firearm without a licence and one count of possession of a controlled drug.</p>

<p>Former Comanchero bikie leader Vince Focarelli (pictured) opened up about surviving six assassination attempts which left him riddled with bullets before giving up a life of crime </p>

<p>He turned to Islam while in jail, shortly after his stepson's murder, and said the religion helped him turn his life around. </p>

<p>Focarelli and his wife opened a restaurant in Adelaide in 2016, named La'Fig ­Cucin, and used their position to help feed the homeless and less fortunate.</p>

<p>The pair created a Tuesday night soup kitchen and had grateful people packing in for a feed. </p>

<p>But in 2017 he learned he would likely be deported back to Italy because of his criminal history.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting for deportation Focarelli chose to move to Malaysia where he remains today.</p>

<p>He took his elderly mother with him but had to leave his wife and stepdaughter behind.</p>

<p>Focarelli showed off scars from the times he had been shot during his career as a bikie (pictured), but it was the last assassination attempt which claimed the life of his stepson that changed his life forever</p>

<p>The reformed bikie didn't see his wife again until they celebrated Eid together in Malaysia last year. </p>

<p>He said she was forced to close their restaurant but they hoped they could open a new one in Kuala Lumpur someday. </p>

<p>Focarelli fell in love with the country almost immediately and said he was eager for his wife and stepdaughter to join him.</p>

<p>'I have never experienced any culture as beautiful as this. I feel free and I sleep well at night,' he said.  </p>

<p>Once a man who's life literally involved dodging bullets, Focarelli has now devoted himself to caring for his mother, who has stage-four cancer. </p>

<p>He said he would never turn back to a life of crime despite 'knowing that world' better than he knows his new world. </p>

<p>Focarelli (pictured) now lived in Malaysia and said he would never return to a life of crime, he would also like to have his wife and stepdaughter with him as soon as possible </p>
