<p>The blonde beauty clutched an iced beverage and a bag from M&amp;S as she headed to her swanky white Range Rover amid the news about her nomination.</p>

<p>Company directors Josh Pieters and Archie Manners insist the reality personality has spent much of her life dedicated to finding peace, and even referenced her relationship with James Argent as a point of her peace-finding ability. </p>

<p>The YouTube duo have hit headlines previously with such stunts as interviewing Carole Baskin and tricking Love Island's Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury into believing James Corden is interviewing them for America's The Late Late Show.</p>

<p>Peaceful profession: Gemma looked unfazed by her new dizzying height of stardom as she emerged in a black ensemble while sporting a protective mask over her face</p>

<p>Drink up! She was getting her caffeine fix </p>

<p>One of the criteria to have the ability to nominate an individual is to be a 'director of a peace research institute'. This is the category Josh and Archie fall under. </p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, the duo, both 27, said: 'The GC has spent 39 years promoting peace and harmony across Essex – and beyond. If you look at what peace really means, take for example her on-off relationship with James Argent – no one died....</p>

<p>'It was a conflict that did appear to be resolved peacefully and we at the Romford Research Institute think this is a great demonstration of world peace.'</p>

<p>Josh explained: 'We believe in the GC effect, which is a peer reviewed hypothesis that if Gemma spent a long weekend in North Korea she could use the skills as seen in Towie to attempt to bring peace to the region.'</p>

<p>Archie added: 'She is arguably more peaceful than Donald Trump. And it's the same with Kanye West. His nomination has been successful and he will be considered.' </p>

<p>The duo's pranks have become prolific, with their Carole and Molly-Mae pranks following on from them luring Katie Hopkins abroad to be given a fake award which spelled out the words 'C*NT'.</p>

<p>Trump's nomination has caused controversy after a Swedish legislator put the President's name forward for the 2021 awards. </p>

<p>A legislator nominated Trump for his efforts in the Middle East and has said he received a phone call of thanks from the US president.</p>

<p>Magnus Jacobsson, a member of Sweden’s Parliament for the Christian Democrats, wrote on Twitter that he was “on my way to the stable with my daughter” when he got the call.</p>

<p>“We had a good conversation about peace in the Middle East and the Balkans. I wish the President good luck with the peace processes,” Mr Jacobsson wrote.</p>

<p>Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed last month to a deal normalising relations that was signed at the White House on September 15.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Mr Jacobsson also nominated the governments of the US, Kosovo and Serbia for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to secure a peace agreement between the two former Balkan war foes.  </p>
