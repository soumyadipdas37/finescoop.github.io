<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Grady Diangana is due for a West Brom medical on Friday after agreeing personal terms with the Premier League new boys.</p>

<p>Diangana is poised to rejoin West Brom permanently on a five-year deal after the two clubs agreed a deal worth in the region of £20m including add-ons.</p>

<p>West Brom have moved quickly after finalising a deal with West Ham on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Grady Diangana will have a medical at West Brom on Friday ahead of a £20million move</p>

<p>The midfielder made 31 appearances on loan for the Baggies last term as they won promotion</p>

<p>Though Fulham boss Scott Parker is a big fan of Diangana and could yet launch a late attempt to hijack the deal and scupper his proposed return to the Hawthorns.</p>

<p>Diangana made 31 appearances for West Brom last season, scoring eight goals and setting up six more to play a key role for former Hammers manager Slaven Bilic's side as they won promotion back to the Premier League.</p>

<p>West Ham have been considering their options since Diangana's return ahead of the new season.</p>

<p>Diangana had spent pre-season with West Ham but has now agreed personal terms with Albion</p>

<p>David Moyes will use the funds to improve his squad - the Hammers have yet to make a signing</p>

<p>They initially hoped to offload one of their bigger earning stars such as Jack Wilshere, Felipe Anderson or Manuel Lanzini in order to raise funds for their own transfer business.</p>

<p>But having been unable to they are now open to cashing in on Diangana while they are keen on bringing in Said Benrahma from Brentford.</p>

<p>The England youth international made his senior West Ham debut in September 2018, scoring twice in an 8-0 League Cup win against Macclesfield, and has featured a total of 21 times for the club after coming through their academy.</p>
