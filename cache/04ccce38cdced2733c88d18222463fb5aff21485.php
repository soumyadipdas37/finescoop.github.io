<p>The Brexit Party leader heaped pressure on the Prime Minister, saying the current restrictions are a threat to freedom.</p>

<p>He told The Times: 'We stood aside for Boris Johnson's government, now many are questioning why we bothered.'</p>

<p>Nigel Farage has threatened to start an anti-lockdown party as he criticises Boris Johnson's draconian measures to curb the rise in coronavirus cases</p>

<p>He previously lambasted the government's measures, accusing Mr Johnson of adopting an 'authoritarian' response to the crisis. </p>

<p>The former UKIP tweeted earlier this week: 'The PM says we are a "freedom loving country", but will fine you £10,000 and send the army in if he likes.</p>

<p>'This is authoritarian – I don't believe his promises on testing or the competence of the government. We didn't vote for this.' </p>

<p>The Prime Minister's decision to impose the recent 10pm curfew has been hit by criticism after it was revealed the move was not advocated by Sage - the panel of scientific experts chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister's decision to impose the recent 10pm curfew has been hit by criticism</p>

<p>Sage members are said to be increasingly frustrated that they are being overruled while simultaneously being scapegoated for the harsher measures, according to the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>A former World Health Organisation director, Professor Karol Sikora, also highlighted concerns, saying: 'Where is the evidence? Closing a little early will just hurt so many business owners.'</p>

<p>Sage scientists are reportedly calling on the Government to release their advice to exonerate them from any part in mooting a pub curfew. </p>

<p>It comes as households in the Welsh town of Llanelli were banned from entering each other's homes and gardens from 6pm, with the nation's two biggest cities of Cardiff and Swansea following suit. Residents are also banned from entering or leaving the areas without a 'reasonable excuse'.</p>

<p>Britain's coronavirus R rate could now be as high as 1.5, government scientific advisers warned on Friday after rises in all regions of the country</p>

<p>It comes after lockdowns were already imposed in large swathes of the North East and North West of England. More than a quarter of the UK is under tighter restrictions, including half of the Welsh population. </p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been an 'acceleration of Covid-19 cases across the country, especially in the North West and the North East'.</p>

<p>'Working alongside our scientific and public health experts and local leaders, we are prepared to take swift and decisive action to reduce transmission of the virus and protect communities,' he said. 'I recognise the burden and impact these additional measures have on our daily lives but we must act collectively and quickly to bring down infections.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the capital was at a 'very worrying topping point' with rising Covid-19 cases, NHS 111 calls, hospital admissions and patients in intensive care units.</p>

<p>Public Health England data shows only a handful of London's 32 boroughs are now seeing a sustained rise in infections - including Redbridge, Hounslow, Barking and Dagenham and Enfield. The data is set to be updated on Friday, but gives an indication of which boroughs are struggling the most </p>
