<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona have decided not to pursue their interest in signing Inter Milan striker Lautaro Martinez.</p>

<p>The Argentinian striker has been strongly linked with a move to the Camp Nou this year and is valued at around £90million by the San Siro club. </p>

<p>However, given the financial uncertainty at Barcelona, the Catalans have been unable to meet Inter’s asking price and have subsequently withdrawn from the transfer race. </p>

<p>Barcelona have decided to give up on signing £90million Inter Milan striker Lautaro Martinez</p>

<p>Despite pulling out of a deal with Inter, Barca will continue to look to fill the void left by Luis Suarez - who completed a £5.5m to Diego Simeone's side after being told by Ronald Koeman he was no longer required at the Camp Nou. </p>

<p>Martinez would have been an ideal replacement for Suarez, having scored 14 goals in Serie A last season.</p>

<p>Although Barca will still look to replace Luis Suarez, who was sold to Atletico Madrid for £5.5m</p>

<p>If Barca boss Ronald Koeman signed Martinez he would not have the funds to purchase others</p>

<p>Barcelona knew that if they met Inter's asking price, they wouldn't be able to strengthen in other areas prior to the deadline of October 5. </p>

<p>Ideally, Koeman would like to add depth at centre-back and right-back before the summer window closes. </p>

<p>Martinez did have a £101m release clause in his contract but that option expired in July.</p>

<p>Inter are now asking for a minimum of £73m for their striker and will refuse to accept additional players as part of the deal, according to Calciomercato.</p>

<p>Given Martinez's move to Barca is now off the table, he is likely to agree news terms at Inter </p>

<p>As a move to Spain is now off the table, Martinez looks set to stay at the San Siro for another season. </p>

<p>Martinez's contract is due to expire in 2023, but it seems likely that the striker will agree new terms with the club.</p>

<p>While Barca have been linked with Lyon forward Memphis Depay, who Ronald Koeman managed at international level, as an alternative option for their forward line. </p>
