<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australia was plunged into strict lockdown at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic based on incorrect figures and a massive over-estimation of how many patients would require ICU treatment. </p>

<p>Research by The Peter Doherty Institute had estimated a peak daily demand of 35,000 intensive care beds would be required in the scenario of an uncontrolled outbreak in Australia.</p>

<p>But the modelling had confused ICU admissions with the number of people who would need to be taken to hospital during the pandemic.</p>

<p>As a result, New South Wales hospitals were predicted to be hit with 12,000 ICU patients rather than the 3,000 admissions the modelling had meant to show.</p>

<p>A young woman strolls down an empty Bourke Street Mall in Melbourne on Wednesday. Experts who predicted Australia's ICU demand at the start of the COVID-19 crisis made a critical error in data that guided the nation's response to the pandemic, it has emerged</p>

<p>Department for Health Secretary Brendan Murphy pictured in Canberra on Monday. As chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy had cited estimates of a peak daily demand of 35,000 ICU beds during an uncontrolled coronavirus outbreak as 'horrendous'</p>

<p>The data was used by the federal government to justify nationwide business shutdowns, border closures and social distancing restrictions when the virus took hold in Australia in March. </p>

<p>Then-Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said at the time the figures forecast an 'horrendous scenario' with a 'daily demand for new intensive care beds of 35,000-plus'.  </p>

<p>He said such a demand would be 'completely beyond the realm of any country to create'. </p>

<p>The Doherty Institute's Professor Jodie McVernon said the modelling mistake - which was published in April - was noticed in June and the government was notified, The Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>Disease modelling experts at James Cook University in Queensland noticed the error when they discovered a large discrepancy in predicted ICU admissions between different parts of Australia.</p>

<p>James Cook University infectious diseases physician Emma McBryde claimed her researchers had told the Doherty Institute of the mistake and the organisation said the error would be corrected.</p>

<p>The modelling though had confused ICU admissions with the number of people who would need to be taken to hospital during the pandemic. Pictured a near-deserted Bourke Street Mall on Wednesday</p>

<p>Large numbers of police patrol Melbourne streets on Wednesday.  The Doherty Institute's Professor Jodie McVernon said the modelling mistake was noticed in June</p>

<p>But she claimed no revision had been made three months later. </p>

<p>'Leaving something inaccurate uncorrected on the public record is pretty close to research misconduct,' she said.</p>

<p>'I strongly believe we lock down too hard.' </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Doherty Institute for comment. </p>

<p>The revelation comes as Australia's hopes for a coronavirus vaccine were put under threat after trials in the UK were paused over major safety concerns.</p>

<p>The federal and state governments have repeatedly said we will have to live with the virus until a vaccine is rolled out. </p>

<p>But the jab being developed at Oxford University is the only overseas candidate that Australia has agreed to buy while other developed countries have signed several deals.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has come under fire for 'putting all of Australia's eggs in one basket'.</p>

<p>Labor's health spokesman Chris Bowen said: 'The federal government needs to invest urgently in a range of potential Covid-19 vaccines.'</p>

<p>Victoria recorded 76 new COVID-19 infections and 11 deaths on Wednesday (pictured, two women in Melbourne wear face masks near the beach on Tuesday)</p>

<p>He pointed out that 18 countries have signed 51 deals to buy various vaccine candidates. The US has six and the UK has five. </p>

<p>Australia has also agreed to buy a vaccine being developed at the University of Queensland - but it only started human trials in July.</p>

<p>There are 37 vaccines in human trials around the world and Australia is trying to buy more of them.</p>

<p>Victoria meanwhile recorded another day of double-digit coronavirus infections on Wednesday, with just 76 new cases across the state.</p>

<p>A further 11 deaths have also been announced, taking the state's death toll to 694. </p>

<p>The figures are a marked jump from previous days after the state recorded 55 infections on Tuesday and 41 on Monday - the lowest number in two months.  </p>

<p>In order to move to the next step of easing restrictions on September 28, Melbourne must record an average daily infection rate between 30 and 50 over the next two weeks. </p>

<p>Cafes, bars and restaurants will not be able to have customers dine outside until October 26, as long as the statewide case average has fallen under five for the previous fortnight.</p>

<p>Step one: The first step will come in to place on September 13.</p>

<p>Step two: The second step will be implemented when Melbourne has 30-50 COVID-19 cases a day on average over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on September 28. </p>

<p>Step three: The move to step three will occur when there is a daily statewide average of five new cases over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on October 26.</p>

<p>Step four: The move to step four will come when there have been no new COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on November 23.</p>

<p>COVID Normal: After 28 days of no new COVID-19 cases, things will return to normal. </p>

<p>Queensland recorded eight new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, the state's biggest daily rise in nearly five months, including three more workers from Ipswich Hospital. </p>

<p>The other five cases were members of the same family who were under quarantine in a household when they were diagnosed. These cases are linked to the cluster at the Queensland Correctional Services Academy.    </p>

<p>The spike in cases follows New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian admitting she 'does begrudge' Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk of her decision to keep the southern border shut. </p>

<p>Speaking on Today on Wednesday, Ms Berejiklian said there was no health basis to keeping the border restrictions. </p>

<p>'I do begrudge her because the situation has got very low community transmission,' Ms Berejikilian said.</p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (pictured) has said she has no intention of opening her state's border this month </p>

<p>'And NSW has shown that you can have open borders.' </p>

<p>Tensions between the two leaders have been simmering for months over Queensland's decision to keep the southern border closed. </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian said a number of Queensland residents were in New South Wales hotels under quarantine with COVID-19. </p>

<p>She claimed if NSW had high numbers like Victoria then closing the border was a sensible measure, however, states with a confident health system and low numbers should not be isolated. </p>

<p>'When the case numbers are so low at this stage and yes, it's a daily battle, why would you close your borders? Why would you hurt your businesses and jobs in your own state?' </p>
