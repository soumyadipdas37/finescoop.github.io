<p>The spooky Gulag outpost of Kadykchan was officially closed after the fall of the Soviet Union and a coal mine explosion in 1996 which killed six.</p>

<p>Now it has been repopulated by pictures of its lost residents in a project by designers from two art studios from Yakutsk, the world's coldest city.</p>

<p>Artists have tried to breathe new life into ghost town built on Stalin's orders in Siberia by painting on the walls of the abandoned buildings</p>

<p>'Now Kadykchan is not so empty,' said one of the participants.</p>

<p>'There are people living along its central street, they are going about their usual daily business.</p>

<p>'They walk to work, meet their loved ones and wait for customers.'Â </p>

<p>The town in the wild Kolya region - which once had a thriving 10,000 population - was a staging post on Josef Stalin's notorious Road of Bones, built by political prisoners many of whom perished in this furnace of cold.</p>

<p>The spooky Gulag outpost of Kadykchan was officially closed after the fall of the Soviet Union and a coal mine explosion in 1996 which killed six</p>

<p>It has been repopulated by pictures of its lost residents in a project by designers from two art studios from Yakutsk, the world's coldest city</p>

<p>The town in the wild Kolya region once had a thriving 10,000 population but today it lies empty after being deserted for years</p>

<p>The deserted settlement's name in local Evenk folklore means 'Death Valley'.</p>

<p>One of those banished to a coal mine here in the Stalin purges was famous Russian writer Varlam Shalamov who wrote: 'Kolyma is Auschwitz without the ovens.'</p>

<p>A repeated victim of repression, he also penned: 'There is much that a man should not see, should not know, and if he should see it, it is better for him to die.'</p>

<p>By 1986 Kadykchan had a cinema hall, a House of Culture, shops and a restaurant called 'Polyarniy' along with a statue of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin.</p>

<p>The artists (pictured) spent four days at the ghost town painting its walls as they transformed the eerie town</p>

<p>The deserted settlement's name in local Evenk folklore aptly means 'Death Valley' but now lively pictures of residents adorn the walls</p>

<p>One of those banished to a coal mine in the Stalin purges was famous Russian writer Varlam Shalamov who wrote about the town</p>

<p>Coal from its mines was burned to heat remote villages in temperatures sinking to minus 55C.</p>

<p>The outpost became nonviable after the Soviet collapse in 1991, with a population exodus which increased after the mine explosion five years later.</p>

<p>A decision to close the town was taken in 2003, but several hundred refused to budge and remained until 2009.</p>

<p>By 2012 an elderly man with a dog was its final citizen but now it is empty apart from the newly-painted figures adorning its crumbling walls.</p>

<p>The town is a tourist attraction for people traversing one of the world's loneliest routes from Yakutsk to Magadan.</p>

<p>'We wanted to breathe a bit of life into the empty town,' said one of the artists.</p>

<p>'Now will live in Kadykchan forever,' said Rostislav Pavlov, head of the artistic odyssey.</p>

<p>'This was one of the purposes of our expedition to Magadan region, to revive the deserted town of Kadykchan.</p>

<p>'We bought paints and decorated the houses on its central street.'</p>

<p>Among the group were former residents of the town who returned to see their tumbledown homes.</p>
