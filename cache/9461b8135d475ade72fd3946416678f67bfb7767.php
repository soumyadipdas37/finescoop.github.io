<p>Australian foodies are marvelling over a mum's surprisingly 'genius' tactic for making a large batch of boiled eggs without the shell. Laura first cracked eight eggs into a heatproof bowl that was sprayed with oil, then placed the bowl into a pot and filled it with one cup of hot water</p>

<p>'I'm making potato salad and needed eight boiled eggs, chopped. Did you know you can just crack them in a bowl and put the whole bowl in the pot? No ice bath or peeling required,' she said online.</p>

<p>'The resulting bowl-shaped egg loaf is initially horrifying, but once you chop it up, it's wonderful!'</p>

<p>The time-saving hack quickly went viral and was shared more than 81,000 times online, as other foodies were left amazed.Â </p>

<p>'This is genius. I hate peeling eggs!' one person said online.</p>

<p>'That is a game changer!' another said, and a third added: 'So clever!'</p>

<p>'Then use a baking rack that has a smallish square grid, and simply push it through. Instantly diced,' a fourth suggested.</p>

<p>The easy cooking method can be completed as long as a heatproof bowl is used to place into a pot.</p>
