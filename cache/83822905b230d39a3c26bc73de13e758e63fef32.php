<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prince Harry is said to be 'upset' at being unable to travel to Balmoral to spend time with his brother and grandmother - while his wife is reportedly 'too busy' to worry about it.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old Duke of Sussex has missed the annual gathering in Scotland for the past two years.</p>

<p>Last year he and the Duchess intended to go during the first week of September, but later decided that Archie, then aged four months, was too young to travel.</p>

<p>She instead flew to New York to cheer on her friend Serena Williams at the US Open.</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are notably missing from the Royal party in Balmoral</p>

<p>The Scottish castle, built by Queen Victoria, has hosted summer gatherings for over 150 years</p>

<p>Prince Harry and his wife, however, have opted to remain at their Los Angeles mansion</p>

<p>This year Prince William has traveled to Scotland with his wife and their three children in what is believed to be the first time he has seen the Queen, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, since the coronavirus pandemic begun.</p>

<p>The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived in Scotland on August 4 for the start of their summer holiday.</p>

<p>The couple, who have been isolating at Windsor Castle, traveled by car to RAF Northolt, in west London, where they boarded a private jet. </p>

<p>They were followed by royal aides carrying luggage and a pair of dorgis, the Queen's beloved dogs which are a cross between a dachshund and a Welsh corgi.</p>

<p>It was the first time they had left Windsor Castle since March. </p>

<p>Prince Harry, however, would raise eyebrows by traveling during the pandemic, even though he likely could if he wished to.  </p>

<p>The U.S. government has ruled that anybody, with the exception of U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, and immediate family members, who has been in the United Kingdom during the past 14 days may not enter the United States at this time.  </p>

<p>On Monday In Touch Weekly reported that the prince is frustrated 'that he can't make' the journey, due to the coronavirus crisis. </p>

<p>His 39-year-old wife, however, is not concerned, the magazine reported.</p>

<p>'[She] doesn't feel like she's missing out,' an 'insider' said. </p>

<p>'She's been too busy decorating their new Montecito mansion.' </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved into their $14 million Californian mansion in July, and have been working on making it their home. </p>

<p>The Cambridges arrived at the Scottish castle on August 28. </p>

<p>The Sussexes were invited to join, and in March reportedly accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>By June, with the scale of the pandemic becoming clear, it was increasingly obvious that the trip would not happen.</p>

<p>Los Angeles-born Markle would perhaps find life at the imposing Scottish castle, built by Queen Victoria in 1853, a shock to the system.</p>

<p>Family members spend their time stalking deer, shooting grouse and fishing for salmon - something which the animal rights defender may not find amusing. </p>

<p>Both William and his Harry, hunted and shot from a young age. They were so enthusiastic that their mother Diana, Princess of Wales, jokingly dubbed them her 'Killer Wales'. </p>

<p>On Saturday William took his seven-year-old son, Prince George, on the grouse shoot with the family.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle was invited last year, but went to the final of the US Open in New York instead</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Harry and Meghan have appearanced on Zoom and via social media promoting their causes</p>

<p>Royal sources said Princess Anne and her husband, Vice Admiral Tim Laurence, were also present, as was her son Peter Phillips, who was staying on the estate with his daughters, Savannah and Isla. </p>

<p>It is not believed that his estranged wife Autumn was with them. The couple announced earlier this year that they were amicably divorcing.</p>

<p>Prince Edward and son James, Viscount Severn, 12, also took part in the shoot and were joined by his wife Sophie and daughter Lady Louise, 16, for lunch.</p>

<p>Neither the Queen, who still attends the lunch parties, nor Charles and Camilla were believed to have been present – possibly because the 94-year-old sovereign was concerned about breaking her 'Balmoral bubble'.</p>

<p>Although many summer shoots take place in the hills above her Aberdeenshire estate, the monarch also owns 2,940 hectares of private grouse moor at Corgarff and 4,688 hectares of sporting rights rented from a neighbor. </p>

<p>Even Kate has been photographed with a gun in her hands over the years, having shot grouse and pheasants. </p>

<p>She and her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, have been taught to stalk deer on the Queen's Scottish estate.</p>

<p>Since meeting his wife Meghan, Harry has hunted significantly less – although he did take part in the annual Boxing Day pheasant shoot at Sandringham in 2018. The duchess is known not to approve, although claims she had 'banned' him were wide of the mark.</p>
