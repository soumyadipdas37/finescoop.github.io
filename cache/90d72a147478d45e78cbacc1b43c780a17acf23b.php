<p>Sizzling display: Saira Khan showcased her incredibly-toned figure in white lace lingerie as she took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a candid comparison post</p>

<p>In a lengthy post, she told fans: 'We inhale and exhale, our tummy goes in and it comes out - that’s how we breathe, that’s how we stay alive.</p>

<p>'My tummy is not flat. It is rounded and when I eat, it gets full and gets rounder still. This is totally and utterly normal. If I did not eat - my tummy would be flat.'</p>

<p>After describing how she 'loves to eat', Saira continued: 'A 6 pack is not always a sign of a healthy body. Some people have gone to extremes to get one. Sometimes they have to virtually starve - that’s not healthy.</p>

<p>Stunning: Saira said: 'My tummy is not flat. It is rounded and when I eat, it gets full and gets rounder still. This is totally and utterly normal. If I did not eat - my tummy would be flat.'</p>

<p>'But a strong core, that allows me to live my life with quality and able to the things I want to do, is why I work it. A strong core also gives me confidence and comfort in my clothes. </p>

<p>'My core is my strength. So next time you look at your amazing figure - connect your mind to your core, remember it’s purpose - it’s there to hold you up strong and proud.</p>

<p>'Looking at someone else’s core and comparing it to yours, is an exercise that is pointless - look, admire respect and then work yours. Engage, feel and love your core today.'    </p>

<p>Love your core: In a lengthy post, she told fans: 'We inhale and exhale, our tummy goes in and it comes out - that’s how we breathe, that’s how we stay alive'</p>
