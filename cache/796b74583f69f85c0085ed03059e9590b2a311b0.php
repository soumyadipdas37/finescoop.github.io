<p>A team of researchers claim the dream you've experienced is just a continuation of what is happening in your every day life - with no deeper or hidden meaning.</p>

<p>Experts from the Nokia Bell Labs in Cambridge created a Natural Language Processing technique that can automatically analyse dreams and quantify them. </p>

<p>According to what sleep scientists call the 'continuity hypothesis,' our dreams reflect what we experience in our real lives and the new tool proves the theory.</p>

<p>Because our dreams reflect every day life, the authors say it could be possible to build a tool that could help in mental health diagnosis and treatment. </p>

<p>Have you ever woken up from a dream that made absolutely no sense and wondered what it was all about? Left baffled over whether there is a deeper meaning? Stock image</p>

<p>The tool looked at the dreams of 20,000 people including a war veteran. The tool categorised the dream and linked it to everyday life</p>

<p>Using the new 'Dreamcatcher' tool, the team had it study over 20,000 dream reports and found that what we dream is a continuation of what happens in everyday life.  </p>

<p>Among the people whose dreams the tool analysed were a female artist, blind dreamers, a schoolgirl, a war veteran and a cross-dressing businessman. </p>

<p>Researchers analised more than 20,000 examples of dream text.</p>

<p>These are a few examples:</p>

<p>They found a way to automatically place dreams on a scale that is commonly used by sleep experts called the Hall and Van de Castle system.</p>

<p>During the second century AD, Artemidorus Daldianus produced a five-volume work entitled 'The Interpretation of Dreams'. </p>

<p>In the 1890s, Sigmund Freud associated specific meanings to characters, objects, animals, and scenarios that frequently appeared in dreams. </p>

<p>More recently, sleep scientists have developed increasingly sophisticated ways of coding dreams - with more than 150 dream rating and content analysis scales available today including the best rated 'Hall and Van de Castle' system. </p>

<p>This coding system sees a dream as a cast of characters, a plot in which characters interact with each other and a process reflecting different active states.  </p>

<p>The problem is that this is an entirely manual process that takes a long time and limits the number of dreams that can be coded.</p>

<p>The new tool developed by the Cambridge team set out to resolve that problem by finding a way to process the language describing dreams automatically.</p>

<p>From each dream report, the tool extracted nouns to identify people, animals, and fictional characters, and verbs to classify interactions in terms of friendly interactions or acts of aggression.</p>

<p>Among the text studied by the artificial intelligence algorithm were mentions of a monster with a sword, having sex in a huge hot room and wiggling snakes. </p>

<p>The results suggest it is possible to build future technologies that bridge the current yawning gap between real life and dreaming - to quantify the 'sleeping mind'.</p>

<p>To try and tackle the problem of manual dream processing experts have been mining manual reports with algorithms focusing on emotions.  </p>

<p>In so doing, researchers have not tackled two main technical challenges, according to the team behind the new dream analysis tool.</p>

<p>That is how to mine aspects of dream reports that research has found important, such as characters and interactions; and how to do so in a principled way grounded in the literature. </p>

<p>'To tackle these challenges, we designed a tool that automatically scores dream reports by operationalising the widely used dream analysis scale by Hall and Van de Castle,' the team wrote. </p>

<p>'We validated the tool’s effectiveness on hand-annotated dream reports and tested what sleep scientists call the ‘continuity hypothesis’ at this unprecedented scale.' </p>

<p>In the therapeutic context, the main goal of dream analysis is to help people address their real-life problems and the team say their tool can be used to help people identify latent emotional states, and to help people cope with significant life events.  </p>

<p>A female artist was among those whose dreams were analysed by the tool. Her sleeping mind focused on aesthetic concepts similar to those in her everyday life</p>

<p>A cross-dressing businessman called Chris dreamed of self-awareness, something he thought about while awake. Researchers say the work helps link the sleep and wake thought process</p>

<p>'For those suffering from nightmares, interpreting dreams and ultimately influencing them are ways of partly treat their condition,' the authors explained.   </p>

<p>As much as in their real lives, in their dreams, women tended to be friendlier and less aggressive than men, the team discovered. </p>

<p>All these results support the idea that there is indeed continuity between what individual experience in real life and what they dream. </p>

<p>Interestingly, they found that blind people - who were expecting to dream in ways similar to the general public - tended to instead dream imaginary characters.</p>

<p>'In the future, we will explore which research communities and practitioners could benefit from our dream scoring tool,' the authors said. </p>

<p>'We will also integrate our tool with a mobile app with which users can record their dreams in a convenient way.'</p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.</p>
