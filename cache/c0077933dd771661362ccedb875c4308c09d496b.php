<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A man who described himself as the 'world's unluckiest man' has died in a tragic house fire - after surviving cancer, a heroin addiction, several car accidents and countless robberies.</p>

<p>Paul Murphy, 62, gave himself the unfortunate title after revealing his long history of bad luck back in 2013.</p>

<p>Just when he thought his luck had finally turned around, his horrifically burned body was pulled from the wreckage of a house fire in Clemton Park, south west Sydney on August 29.  </p>

<p>Back in 2013, he'd lost a set of dentures during a night out on the town in Sydney, and was appealing with the local community to have them returned to him.</p>

<p>The then 55-year-old was living off a small pension, and simply couldn't afford to buy a new set. </p>

<p>The false teeth had been in his pocket rather than his mouth when he stumbled home because they hurt too much to wear constantly after he was attacked during a home invasion at his Redfern housing commission flat months earlier.</p>

<p>Paul Murphy, 62, earned the unfortunate title after revealing his long history of bad luck back in 2013</p>

<p>He stuck a printed sign around town which read: 'Lost dentures. Upper and lower… owner far too drunk, fell over, a few too many times. I am a pensioner &amp; desperately need my teeth. Reward offered'.</p>

<p>While the dentures were never returned, he was contacted by news.com.au, who he told about the series of unfortunate events which made up much of Mr Murphy's life.</p>

<p>He was hooked on heroin by the time he graduated from Blakehurst High School in southern Sydney, and the addiction coupled with his dyslexia meant he always struggled to get a solid education.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy's parents had enough money to send him to a rehabilitation clinic where patients were subjected to new electroconvulsive treatment known as deep-sleep therapy. </p>

<p>The treatment was highly intrusive and required patients to be placed into a coma - sometimes for up to 39 days.</p>

<p>At least 27 patients died after receiving the treatment. Twenty-four of those deaths were suicides.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy received 42 electro-shocks in his 14-day stay, and came out of therapy with an addiction still as strong as the one he went in with, as well as trauma from the treatment.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy (pictured left) died on August 29 after his new house caught alight</p>

<p>He spent the next few years in and out of prison - primarily for drug related offences.</p>

<p>The addiction cost Mr Murphy many of his teeth, and all but one had fallen out or been removed by the time he left prison. </p>

<p>When he was finally released, he made a pact to himself to get clean.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy landed a job as a car valuer, but after a serious car accident and several speeding tickets, he lost his license and then the job.</p>

<p>Desperate to remain in the industry, Mr Murphy opened a car detailing business.</p>

<p>As was his luck, Mr Murphy's business opened next door to a funeral parlour. </p>

<p>One day when he had several expensive cars in his shop, the corpse of a gang boss had been brought in next door.</p>

<p>That night, there was a drive-by attack in which someone - presumably a rival of the gang - firebombed the funeral parlour, destroying his business in the process.</p>

<p>He'd recently fallen behind on his insurance payments, and wasn't covered. </p>

<p>Eventually he got back on his feet again and began doing odd jobs for money, moving into the Redfern housing commission flats he would call home for the next decade.</p>

<p>Several of Mr Murphy's electric bikes were stolen while he was living in Redfern</p>

<p>Shortly after making the move, Mr Murphy was attacked by a local teenager.</p>

<p>The boy was in a car and swung a baseball bat at Mr Murphy from the side of the road. The impact shattered the bones in his shoulder and he was forced to go to hospital.</p>

<p>Then again on New Years Day in 2011, Mr Murphy was standing on a footpath near his home when a motorbike rider crashed into him after speeding through the lights. </p>

<p>He broke his collarbone, shoulder, sternum and seven ribs. </p>

<p>With the substantial payout he received from the accident, Mr Murphy splurged on a new television, computer, stereo and electric pushbike.</p>

<p>But shortly after, Mr Murphy's flat was broken into and everything was stolen.</p>

<p>Again, he felt like he was back at square one. </p>

<p>In another horrifying incident, a balaclava-clad thief sprayed fuel on his arm and set Mr Murphy on fire, but still, he survived. </p>

<p>While he managed to install a steel door, his flat was broken into time and time again in the decade to follow, until eventually he managed to escape and move to Clemton Park late last year. </p>

<p>When a journalist asked if he was the unluckiest person in the world, Mr Murphy responded: 'About that, yeah'. </p>

<p>He'd even been left heartbroken when the love of his life ran off with his best friend and survived a traumatic cancer battle.</p>

<p>But he truly believed his luck was changing, and was saving his pennies from the pension and odd jobs to install air conditioning in his beloved new home. </p>

<p>In the end, he died after falling asleep while trying to cook some food in his new home.</p>

<p>He was taking medication for high blood pressure which contributed to his drowsiness.</p>

<p>In the early hours of August 29, Mr Murphy tried to cook some chips, but nodded off while the oven was on.</p>

<p>About 5.30am, neighbours called the fire brigade to warn that the flat was on fire, and emergency services tried desperately to revive an unconscious Mr Murphy.</p>

<p>He could not be saved. </p>
