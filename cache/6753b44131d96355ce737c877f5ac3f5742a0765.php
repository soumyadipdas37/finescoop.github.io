<p>Liz Truss is facing a new Tory rebellion amid mounting anger that she is failing to protect British farms against low-quality food imports.</p>

<p>The International Trade Secretary is being warned to expect humiliating defeats in Parliament this week over her ‘toothless’ defences against sub-standard foreign food in post-Brexit trade deals.</p>

<p>In a series of House of Lords votes, Tory rebels are poised to join Labour and independent peers to order Ms Truss to beef up her trade deal watchdog – the Trade and Agriculture Commission – and let Parliament protect family farms.</p>

<p>But the defeats would also set up the prospect of further Tory revolts in the Commons when MPs debate the plans in a few weeks. </p>

<p>Last night, Conservative rebels urged Ms Truss to reach a last-minute compromise. </p>

<p>Tory peer Baroness McIntosh of Pickering warned that without it many British farms could ‘go to the wall’.</p>

<p>She added: ‘They are prepared to meet high standards, but we must have a level playing field and not undercut those standards with sub-standard imports.’</p>

<p>She also praised The Mail on Sunday’s Save Our Family Farms campaign.</p>

<p>The Lords votes – on the Government’s Agriculture Bill – come amid fresh fears that ‘lower-standard’ meat such as US-produced chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef could be served in British restaurants and work canteens.</p>

<p>In a survey for the sustainable food website Foodprint of 25 firms including fast-food outlets, hotel, pub and coffee shop chains, 12 failed to say whether they would buy such foreign food following trade deals.</p>

<p>The Government points to the 2019 Tory manifesto commitment to uphold food and animal welfare standards in post-Brexit trade talks.</p>

<p>But farm and food campaigners are demanding it meets that pledge by increasing the powers of the temporary Commission set up in July and making it permanent.</p>

<p>In the Lords this week, crossbench peer and retired farmer Lord Curry will insist it is put on a statutory footing and reports on all trade agreements before they are signed. </p>

<p>The move will be supported by senior Tory peer Lord Randall of Uxbridge. Lib Dems are also expected to back the reforms.</p>

<p>Lady McIntosh will call for the Commission to establish criteria for maintaining standards at least as high as UK ones for agricultural goods imported under a trade deal.</p>

<p>Labour peer and dairy farmer Lord Grantchester said: ‘The Commission is devoid of powers. What’s needed are legal guarantees without which farmers will be forced to compete against lower safety, welfare or environmental standards.’</p>

<p>However, Ms Truss signalled last night that she would not compromise. A source said: ‘Liz recognises the concerns of Lord Curry, but thinks the current scope of the Commission is sufficient. We will never sign a trade deal that undercuts farmers or compromises on our high standards.’</p>
