<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kylie Jenner may not be interested in reuniting with her ex Travis Scott at the moment, but she's not ruling out a reconciliation in the future.</p>

<p>The mood between the 23-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star and the 28-year-old rapper 'changes often,' according to Us Weekly's Hot Hollywood podcast.</p>

<p>Despite their shifting feelings, the fashion mogul hasn't ruled out having another child with Travis in the future. </p>

<p>Growing her family: Kylie Jenner, 23, hasn't ruled out reunited with Travis Scott and wants another child in the future, according to Us Weekly; pictured together in 2018</p>

<p>'Kylie and Travis have been so shaky for a while now. They are so on and off and it changes almost month to month,' a source told the publication.</p>

<p>However, the ex couple 'definitely still have a physical attraction to one another and are on pretty good terms.'</p>

<p>The celebrity duo separated in September of 2019, though they had previously had on and off periods in their relationship.</p>

<p>The two were first linked in April 2017, and Kylie gave birth to their daughter Stormi, now two, on February 1, 2018.</p>

<p>It's a possibility: The ex couple 'definitely still have a physical attraction to one another and are on pretty good terms,' a source said; pictured with daughter Stormi Webster in August 2019</p>

<p>'Neither of them is fully committed or attached to one another romantically at this time and Kylie is definitely crushing on a few other guys as of late,' the source continued.</p>

<p>They added that the couple might get back together someday in the future, 'but right now doesn’t seem like the time, but again, their dynamic changes often. They are still young and figuring out their next steps.'</p>

<p>Even if the former lovers aren't sure how they feel about each other, Kylie 'loves' being a mother to Stormi.</p>

<p>'Kylie definitely wants more kids, she’s just not sure about if it will be with Travis, but again, it could happen one day,' the insider said.</p>

<p>Moving on? 'Neither of them is fully committed or attached to one another romantically at this time and Kylie is definitely crushing on a few other guys as of late,' the source said; shown in May 2019</p>

<p>Family time: Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Travis and Kylie have been quarantining together in order to spend plenty of time co-parenting their daughter</p>

<p>Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Travis and Kylie have been quarantining together in order to spend plenty of time co-parenting their daughter. </p>

<p>Back in June, a source told Us Weekly that Travis was 'hopeful' that he and the near-billionaire could be together again, though their current priority was Stormi.</p>

<p>'They co-parent Stormi successfully by being as inclusive and involved as possible and making an effort for Travis to still certainly be part of the picture and let Stormi know that their level of coparenting and dynamic is OK and normal,' a source said. </p>

<p>'They don’t want to give off any energy that it isn’t and everyone in her family thinks they are doing a pretty great job, Travis and Kylie included </p>

<p>Paris vacation: Last month, Kylie outraged some followers when she visited Paris for meetings with executives from Coty Cosmetics, the company which bought a majority stake in Kylie Cosmetics</p>

<p>Late last month, Kylie outraged some of her followers when she took a trip to Paris for business meetings with executives from Coty Cosmetics, the company which bought a majority stake in Kylie Cosmetics, making her a near-billionaire.</p>

<p>Social media users were upset that she traveled for non-essential meetindgs that could likely have been conducted virtually despite the ongoing pandemic. </p>

<p>'You don't have to deal with COVID if ur rich,' sniped one fan in the comments of a post.</p>

<p>'Is the pandemic over for rich people? I just see them taking luxurious vacations to tropical places or Europe like how is Kylie Jenner in Paris rn I don't understand,' wrote another.</p>

<p>Another remarked, 'Kylie Jenner going to Paris during Covid while the rest of the world can't travel or visit family in other countries/states due to border restrictions just doesn't sit well with me.' </p>

<p>Puzzling: It's not clear how Kylie got an exemption to enter the EU, and she documented herself ignoring the 14-day quarantine period for entering France</p>

<p>Some users wondered how Kylie had even been admitted to Paris in the first place.</p>

<p>The European Union has instituted travel restrictions that ban people from the United States from entering any EU countries due to the US' failure to control its coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>Though the EU lists multiple exemptions to the travel restrictions, Kylie doesn't appear to qualify for any of them.</p>

<p>She also seemed to have ignored orders to quarantine for 14 days after entering France. </p>
