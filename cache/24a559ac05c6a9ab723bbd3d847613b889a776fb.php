<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bitter neighbourhood feud will now be played out in court as a retired barrister is accused of putting used tissues in a woman's exhaust pipe of her luxury car after she allegedly cut of the water supply to his apartment. </p>

<p>Daniel Marash, 71, who was based in Hong Kong for decades before purchasing a property for $3.3million in Toorak, one of Melbourne's swankiest suburbs.</p>

<p>Marash will front the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Thursday to answer allegations he assaulted Merina Abdallahah and then placed the used tissues in the exhaust pipe of her luxury $150,000 Mercedes-Benz.</p>

<p>But Marash will argue the alleged assault was only him waving his fist at Ms Abdallah after she had cut off the water to his luxury apartment. </p>

<p>He is also expected to allege his neighbour frequently closes the gates to the apartments, locking him out, and often phones him at 3am. </p>

<p> 'This was the third time it had occurred over a period of months. I approached Mrs Abdallah and her daughter to complain in the garage after I had turned it (water) back on and told her not to do it again,' he told the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>'She became abusive and claimed she turned it off as a sprinkler from my garden had caused damage to the wall at (a neighbour's) car park space.</p>

<p>'That was utter nonsense as the paint spots there had been there for years and we had an architect's report to that effect.'</p>

<p>Victoria Police confirmed in a statement that a '71-year-old Toorak man was charged with unlawful assault and tamper with motor vehicle in relation to an alleged incident that occurred at a Grange Road address in Toorak on 8 July 2019.'</p>

<p>Mr Marash will claim Mrs Abdallah has harassed him from the moment he purchased the property.</p>

<p>He is also expected to allege his neighbour frequently closes the gates to the apartments, locking him out, and often phones him at 3am. </p>

<p>Marash's luxury apartment — which he bought for $3.3 million in 2000 — boasts three bedrooms and two bathrooms, a living room and entertainment room. </p>

<p>Mrs Abdullah is the director of Domus Australia.</p>
