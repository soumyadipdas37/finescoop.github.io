<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> Love in the time of Coronavirus- The modern day Romeo and Juliet, who met from their balcony, have announced that they are getting married.</p>

<p>The pair have been dubbed Romeo and Juliet as they met during Italy's strict lockdown on their balconies in Verona and started a type of long-distance relationship- similarly to Shakespear's tragic heroes.</p>

<p> The pair have confirmed their happy ending and said they have already started planning their wedding. </p>

<p>Paola Agnelli and Michele D'Alpaos met from their balconies during lockdown in Verona, Italy</p>

<p>Paola Agnelli, 40, a lawyer, first spotted Michele D'Alpaos,38 when they were both on their balconies at 6pm for the community balcony concert designed to keep spirits lifted. </p>

<p>Mr D'Alpaos said to The Times: 'We are absolute-ly getting married and all we have to do is set the date.</p>

<p>'We are considering a ceremony on the large roof terrace of my building, which would make sense since we met on our balconies.'</p>

<p>They met during a community balcony concert, when Paola's violinist sister, Lisa Agnelli, was playing  Queen's We Are The Champions and Paola was helping with the sound. </p>

<p>The couple became viral after Mr D'Alpaos erected a huge banner on the top floor of the building with 'Paola' written on it</p>

<p>The modern day Romeo and Juliet, have announced that they are getting married</p>

<p>Paola was helping her violinist sister, Lisa Agnelli, (pictured), who was playing Queen's We Are The Champions that day</p>

<p>Mr D'Alpaos tracked down Paola's Instagram account and the pair started messaging until 3am. </p>

<p>And as they couldn't meet due to coronavirus restrictions, their relationship was based on talking on the phone.      </p>

<p>The couple became viral after Mr D'Alpaos erected a huge banner on the top floor of the building with 'Paola' written on it, in a bid to express his emotions. </p>

<p>The pair were able to actually meet for a date in a local park in May. </p>

<p>The couple, who are both unmarried, have lived opposite each other for most of their lives but have never met properly apart from a chance meeting a year ago.</p>
