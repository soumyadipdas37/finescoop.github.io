<p>House prices grew at their fastest rate in four years last month as families sought more space after being cooped up during lockdown</p>

<p>It backs up reports of a surge in enquiries from homeowners wanting more space.</p>

<p>Stamp duty has been temporarily axed on homes worth up to £500,000. </p>

<p>Recent reports by two of the biggest mortgage lenders Halifax and Nationwide have also revealed a dramatic recovery in the property market as the lockdown has eased, with house prices hitting a record high.</p>

<p>They have both pointed to the impact of chancellor Rishi Sunak's stamp duty holiday, which came into effect on July 8 and will last until March 31 next year.</p>

<p>The average home was worth £245,747 in August, £12,000 more than in the same month last year. It was the biggest annual rise since 2016</p>

<p>Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS said: 'The latest RICS survey provides firm evidence of a strong uplift in activity in the housing market which should help support the wider economy gain traction over the coming months.</p>

<p>'Meanwhile the results provide a further pointer to more substantive changes taking place in household behaviour in the wake of the pandemic.</p>

<p>'Increased demand for properties with garden and near green spaces has if anything increased since we tested the water in May.'</p>

<p>But commentators are worried the recovery in house prices may be short-lived.</p>

<p>As well as concerns about rising unemployment when the Job Retention Scheme closes, experts are worried that the end of the stamp duty holiday next March will also hit demand.</p>
