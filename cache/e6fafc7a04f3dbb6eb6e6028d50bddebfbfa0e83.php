<p>Suzanne, 49, was reported missing from her home in Maysville, Colorado, on Mother’s Day in May after her two daughters Mallory and Macy were unable to contact her.</p>

<p>Four months after her disappearance, nothing has been found of the mother-of-two but her bike, which was located by cops on a bridge close to her home.</p>

<p>Now her brother Andrew Moorman, 58, has raised $18,000 to pay for a search that took place over the weekend and said cadaver dogs picked up a scent on the wooded site - located just 15 miles away from the Morphews' home. </p>

<p>A second search of the site took place on Monday using different cadaver dogs and the dogs' handler told DailyMail.com they got another hit. The handler explained the dogs are trained to only pick up human scents.  </p>

<p>Now the FBI will take over the search and conduct a dig on the area where the scent was detected by the dogs. </p>

<p>Moorman, of Alexandria, Indiana, has been in Colorado hunting for his sister since last Wednesday. </p>

<p>He is being aided by the local police department and investigators from the CBI and the FBI, who were photographed close to the Morphew home on Sunday by DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Moorman said landscaper Morphew, 52, has refused to participate in the search but did allow him access to the grounds of his $1.5 million home on Sunday.</p>

<p>He also revealed he was told by FBI investigators that the Morphew home stank of chlorine when it was searched by police in the days after Suzanne vanished.</p>

<p>DailyMail.com previously revealed that Morphew was at a hotel in Broomfield, Colorado, when his wife was reported missing and left the room reeking of chlorine and covered in wet towels.</p>

<p>Moorman said: ‘I think it’s really odd. I know we’re in Covid-19 but most people don’t clean with chlorine. I know the hotel did not.</p>

<p>‘That kind of bothers me to be honest. It seems like you’re trying to cover up something.’</p>

<p>Although 10 years Suzanne’s senior, he describes their relationship as close and said he was absolutely floored on learning of her disappearance on May 10.</p>

<p>He said: ‘I couldn’t fathom it. It floored me. I jumped on a plane the same day and flew down here to try to find her.</p>

<p>‘They found her bicycle and that was all. No trace of her which is awfully weird.’</p>

<p>The initial police investigation saw teams of officers drafted in from all over Colorado to search the area around the Morphew home, while police divers were seen checking portions of the river nearby. </p>

<p>Speaking in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Moorman says he is desperate to find some trace of his sister before the winter snows make finding anything impossible and says he would like to find something that would give the family closure – ideally while clearing Morphew of any involvement in Suzanne’s disappearance</p>

<p>Moorman set up a GoFundMe campaign earlier this month to help fund the grassroots search operation. More than $18,000 has been raised of the $10,000 goal</p>

<p>He said: ‘They haven’t been able to figure out what happened to her. She was abducted in some way and the investigation… well it didn’t go dry, they didn’t quit working on it but they ran out of funds and time to ground search'</p>

<p>Three days after she went missing, CBI and FBI agents were photographed searching the three-bedroom house by DailyMail.com before the search moved to a riverside worksite in Salida where Morphew had been doing a landscaping job.</p>

<p>This month DailyMail.com also revealed that investigators have also taken security footage spanning the period from May 8 to May 10 from businesses around the Holiday Inn Express hotel in Broomfield – 150 miles from Salida – where Morphew was staying when his wife vanished.</p>

<p>Contractor Jeff Puckett, 49, told DailyMail.com in an exclusive interview earlier this month that the room stank of chlorine and was littered with wet towels when he took it over the same day.</p>

<p>He also discovered mail left behind that dealt with property insurance – DailyMail.com previously revealed how Morphew has obtained guardianship of Suzanne in order to sell a mutual property in their native Indiana.</p>

<p>Moorman says he is desperate to find some trace of his sister before the winter snows make finding anything impossible and says he would like to find something that would give the family closure – ideally while clearing Morphew of any involvement in Suzanne’s disappearance.</p>

<p>He said: ‘They haven’t been able to figure out what happened to her. She was abducted in some way and the investigation… well it didn’t go dry, they didn’t quit working on it but they ran out of funds and time to ground search.</p>

<p>‘Out here, big snows happen in these mountains and the only way you’re going to find something is before the snow hits so I felt a sense of urgency to get out here and find her.’</p>

<p>He added: ‘I don’t think there is going to be a good outcome but what I would like is closure for the two girls first and foremost.</p>

<p>‘I pray that it clears Barry. I really do. I want that to happen. My father, my brother, my sister and myself want closure.’</p>

<p>Barry and Suzanne Morphew are pictured with daughters Mallory and Macy. Suzanne, 49, was reported missing on Mother's Day - May 10 - and has not been seen since</p>

<p>Moorman also said landscaper Barry, 52, has refused to participate in the search but did allow him access to the grounds of his $1.5 million home on Sunday. Pictured: Barry grilling out at his home in July </p>

<p>DailyMail.com previously revealed that Morphew was at a hotel in Broomfield, Colorado (pictured), when his wife was reported missing and left the room reeking of chlorine and covered in wet towels</p>

<p>So far, he says his team of 500 searchers covered more than 45,000 miles of ground, some of it by drone. They were also given permission to search the grounds of the Morphew home on Sunday where nothing was found.</p>

<p>He says along with the scent picked up by cadaver dogs at Morphew’s plot of land near Poncha Springs, they made another ‘hit’ at the riverfront worksite in Salida. CBI investigators have now taken over the site.</p>

<p>Moorman also revealed that CBI are processing three other finds: a tarp, a towel and a blanket found on the mountain trails near Suzanne’s home.</p>

<p>He said: ‘I met with CBI tonight and they’re pleased as punch with any evidence we turn up.’</p>

<p>Morphew has not taken part in the search beyond allowing a search of his garden and Moorman says he remains suspicious of his refusal to take a polygraph test.</p>

<p>He said: ‘I think he should have done a lie detector and voice analysis. I know that’s not admissible in court but it kind of clears you.</p>

<p>‘It says, look, I’m here and I’ll tell you everything you need to know. I’ll take several of them if you need me to. And that didn’t happen. That kind of made me suspicious as well.’</p>

<p>But what Moorman and his family want most is to get some answers about what really happened to Suzanne.</p>

<p>Moorman said:’ She’s hidden too well, which tells me she didn’t get robbed. There’s no blood evidence so I don’t know she was murdered for sure.</p>

<p>‘She’s been gone too long and I know she wouldn’t run off. There’s foul play here. I just haven’t figured out how.’</p>
