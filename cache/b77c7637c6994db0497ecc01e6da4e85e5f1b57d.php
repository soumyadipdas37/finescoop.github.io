<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Angela Merkel has limited public gatherings to 50 people in covid hotspots but pledged to avoid a national lockdown 'at all costs' to preserve Germany's economy.</p>

<p>Fines will also be issued to those who flout track and trace rules, the Chancellor told a conference of the country's 16 state leaders on Tuesday.  </p>

<p>By European standards, Germany has experienced relatively low infection and death rates so far during the pandemic, but Merkel said cases could hit 19,200 per day if current trends continued.</p>

<p>The country reported 2,089 coronavirus cases on Tuesday, compared to 8,051 in France and 7,143 in the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>By European standards, Germany has experienced relatively low infection and death rates so far during the pandemic, but Merkel said cases could hit 19,200 per day if current trends continued</p>

<p>Germany has recorded a total of 287,421 cases and 9,471 fatalities, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said. </p>

<p>'We have learned a lot and got through the summer well but we know a more difficult time lies ahead - autumn and winter - and a gradual rise, in some areas a significant rise in infections, is cause for concern,' Merkel told reporters.</p>

<p>She said a 'hot spot strategy' would limit private parties to 25 people and public ones to 50 in areas where the infection rate hit 35 per 100,000 over seven days.</p>

<p>If the rate hit 50 per 100,000, private celebrations would be restricted to 10 people and those in public to 25.</p>

<p>The German economy contracted by 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic. </p>

<p>Merkel's government has launched various stimulus measures, financed with record new borrowing, that it and economists expect will help engineer a significant return to growth during 2021.</p>

<p>'We want to act regionally, specifically and purposefully, rather than shutting down the whole country again - this must be prevented at all costs,' said Merkel.</p>

<p>Infections have been rising in Germany for weeks but state premiers have been at odds on what action is appropriate, partly because of regional variations in cases.</p>

<p>Merkel said other priorities were for schools and nurseries to stay open.</p>

<p>People who gave false identities to restaurants would be fined 50 euros (£47) and work would be done to improve ventilation in buildings over the winter. </p>
