<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two women affected by controversial changes to the state pension age have today lost their Court of Appeal challenge against the Government.</p>

<p>Under moves by successive governments to ensure 'pension age equalisation', the state pension age has been raised from 60 to 66.</p>

<p>Nearly four million women born in the 1950s have been affected by the changes.</p>

<p>Julie Delve, 62, and Karen Glynn, 63 - supported by campaign group BackTo60 - brought a Court of Appeal challenge over the changes after losing a landmark High Court fight against the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) last year.</p>

<p>The women argued that raising their pension age unlawfully discriminated against them on the grounds of age and sex, and that they were not given adequate notice of the changes.</p>

<p>The Government opposed the challenge and argued the High Court was right to reject their claim.</p>

<p>Three senior judges, Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton, Lord Justice Underhill and Lady Justice Rose, gave their ruling this morning.</p>

<p>At a remote hearing in July, Michael Mansfield QC, representing the two women, said the impact of the state pension age change has been 'dramatic', adding: 'This has been catastrophic for this group.'</p>

<p>Mr Mansfield described the six-year wait that women have from 60 to 66 as a 'considerable' period of time which translates to a 'considerable' sum of money - around £8,000 if it is a full pension, leading to losses that could run up to about £50,000.</p>

<p>In his written submissions, Mr Mansfield said the appellants are women born in the 1950s who 'seek to challenge both the legislative measures which raised the age at which they can receive their state pensions, and the inadequate notice they and other affected women received of the changes'.</p>

<p>The court heard Ms Delve expected to receive her state pension at the age of 60 in 2018, but as a result of the changes, she will not receive it until 2024.</p>

<p>Ms Glynn expected to receive her state pension at 60 in 2016, but will not receive it until 2022.</p>

<p>Last October, Lord Justice Irwin and Mrs Justice Whipple dismissed the women's claim 'on all grounds'.</p>

<p>The High Court rejected their argument that the policy was discriminatory based on age, adding that, even if it was, 'it could be justified on the facts', and also dismissed their contention that they were not given adequate notice of the changes.</p>
