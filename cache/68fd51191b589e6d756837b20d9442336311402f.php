<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nicholas Sandmann, the 17-year-old high school student who was filmed standing opposite a Native American man at the Lincoln Memorial last year, has hit back at the American Civil Liberties Union official who criticized Transylvania University for accepting him. </p>

<p>Sandmann slammed Samuel Crankshaw, an ACLU communications associate and an alumnus of Transylvania University in Lexington, in an opinion piece for Fox News saying 'it is wrong for any of us to demean people who hold different beliefs'.</p>

<p>The Trump-supporting teen voiced concerns that right-wing students at colleges across America 'face attacks just for speaking out and exercising their First Amendment rights' and vowed that he 'will not be canceled'. </p>

<p>Sandmann is the Covington Catholic High School student who became a hero among conservative-leaning sympathizers after he was criticized on social media when a video surfaced of his encounter with Native American activist Nathan Phillips.</p>

<p>The January 2019 footage showed Sandmann and Phillips standing very close to each other, with Sandmann staring, and at times smiling, as Phillips sang and pounded on a drum. </p>

<p>Sandmann, who last month spoke at the Republican National Convention, sued several news outlets and publications over their coverage of the incident.   </p>

<p>ACLU staffer Crankshaw wrote a Facebook post on Saturday criticizing Transylvania University for admitting Sandmann as a student and branded him as a 'provocateur in training.'</p>

<p>Nicholas Sandmann, the 17-year-old high school student who was filmed standing opposite a Native American man at the Lincoln Memorial last year (the incident above), has hit back at the American Civil Liberties Union official who criticized Transylvania University for accepting him</p>

<p>Sandmann lashed out at Crankshaw and so-called 'cancel culture' in his op-ed, questioning whether the official believes only liberals should have access to college education.</p>

<p>'So should only liberals and those on the far-left be able to get a college education? Should there be an ideological purity test required that bars conservatives and Republicans?' Sandmann asked. </p>

<p>The teen, who said he has 'never met Crankshaw', blasted the idea 'frightening' and against the US Constitution. </p>

<p>'That’s a pretty frightening idea and sounds like something you would expect in a totalitarian state, not a democracy where we are all guaranteed free speech by the First Amendment to the Constitution,' he wrote.  </p>

<p>The ACLU is a non-profit that aims to defend and preserve the individual constitutional rights and liberties of every person in America.</p>

<p>Sandmann raged that Crankshaw's comments go against this principle.  </p>

<p>'The ACLU claims to support free speech but, at least where Crankshaw seems to be concerned, that only applies if you share his ideas,' the 17-year-old wrote. </p>

<p>'While he works for an organization founded on inclusivity, he is quick to exclude differing opinions. </p>

<p>'If you are a conservative like me, watch out. The intolerant left might come for you, too.'</p>

<p>Crankshaw responded to the backlash over his Facebook post this week saying he had a First Amendment right to express his views on Sandmann. </p>

<p>The ACLU also said that as a 'stalwart defender of the First Amendment, the ACLU of Kentucky respects its employees' freedom to express themselves on their own time'.</p>

<p>Sandmann (left) slammed Samuel Crankshaw (right), an ACLU communications associate and an alumnus of Transylvania University in Lexington, in an opinion piece for Fox News saying 'it is wrong for any of us to demean people who hold different beliefs' </p>

<p>Sandmann, 17, put on his 'Make America Great Again' hat while speaking during the second night of the Republican Convention on August 25. He voiced concerns in the op-ed that right-wing students at colleges across America 'face attacks just for speaking out'</p>

<p>Sandmann claimed starting college amid the pandemic - with many institutions taking learning virtual - was 'difficult enough' without Crankshaw's 'unwarranted attack'.</p>

<p>'Beginning the college year during the coronavirus pandemic is difficult enough for millions of students,' he wrote. </p>

<p>'But the beginning of my freshman year at Transylvania University in Kentucky is being made even more difficult by an unwarranted attack against me by the cancel culture due to my conservative views.'  </p>

<p>Sandmann went on to reference Jonathan Turley, the conservative constitutional law professor at George Washington University, who first shared Crankshaw's post.</p>

<p>Turley criticized Crankshaw for his comments saying 'it is far more alarming to see an ACLU official rallying people against a young man whose chief offense appears to be that he is publicly (and unapologetically) conservative and pro-life.' </p>

<p>Sandmann said 'Turley is right' and claimed that Republican students are 'face attacks' at colleges across the nation because of their views. </p>

<p>'Colleges have a reputation of being toxic places for conservative, pro-life ideas like the ones I hold,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'Sadly, I’m not the only young Republican being attacked for my political beliefs.</p>

<p>'Conservative students on college campuses across America face attacks just for speaking out and exercising their First Amendment rights.'</p>

<p>Sandmann said such attacks come from both 'left-leaning administrators' and fellow students 'who call on campus leadership to cancel events or shut down student organizations that dare challenge their left-wing view of the world'. </p>

<p>The student reinforced his support for Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell saying they 'are the exact leaders we need at a time when liberal mobs take glee in destroying our lives and erasing our voices'. </p>

<p>He likened himself to his icons saying he had also fought against people 'who wish to silence my opinions', adding: 'I will not be canceled'.   </p>

<p>ACLU staffer Crankshaw wrote a Facebook post on Saturday criticizing Transylvania University for admitting Sandmann as a student and branded him as a 'provocateur in training'</p>

<p>Transylvania University is a liberal arts college located in Lexington, Kentucky (above) </p>

<p>Sandmann's opinion piece comes days after Crankshaw's Facebook post questioning the college for accepting the avid Trump supporter into its college. </p>

<p>‘Does anyone else think it’s a bit of a stain on Transylvania University for accepting Nick Sandman?’ Crankshaw wrote.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure it’s a “both sides” defense, but it’s pretty counter to their mission and another instance of there not actually being equal sides to an issue.</p>

<p>‘I think TU should accept anyone willing to have an open mind and engage in debate, regardless of their views.</p>

<p>‘That’s how we all learn. That’s Transy’s mission.’</p>

<p>Crankshaw added: ‘But this kid clearly is a provocateur in training with no intention of learning.</p>

<p>‘He exists only to troll, intimidate and play victim.' </p>

<p>The post was shared by Turley who wrote that it was disturbing given the ACLU's mission in protecting free speech rights of all Americans.</p>

<p>'Sandmann like all college students should feel greater freedom in expressing their views at colleges, not being closely monitored as someone with dangerous thoughts and ideas,' Turley wrote in a blog post. </p>

<p>'That fact that figures in the ACLU and academia would publicly espouse such views of intolerance is a chilling example of how our faith in free speech has eroded in the recent years.' </p>

<p>Turley wrote that an assistant professor and diversity scholar at Transylvania, Dr. Avery Tompkins, responded to Crankshaw by pledging to closely monitor Sandmann on campus.</p>

<p>‘If he were to cause problems by being disruptive, trolling, or engaging in unethical behavior of any kind, I would immediately document it (just like I would for any student doing the same thing)…and he would just be putting himself in a position for me to file a conduct report,’ Tompkins wrote.</p>

<p>Tompkins later apologized, saying in a statement: ‘I want to apologize for my mistake in singling out a student and any misunderstandings that arose from that.</p>

<p>‘One of my favorite things about working at a liberal arts institution is that the University community has diverse perspectives.</p>

<p>Sandmann became a hero among conservative-leaning sympathizers after he was criticized on social media when a video surfaced of his encounter with Native American activist Nathan Phillips (above)</p>

<p>Both Sandmann, who was wearing a red 'Make America Great Again' cap, and Phillips (seen above in 2017) later said they were trying to defuse tensions among three separate groups participating in various demonstrations, including Black Hebrew Israelites who had arrived apparently to counter-protest the Native Americans</p>

<p>‘All students, faculty, and staff are able to engage in civil discourse with those whose views may be different from their own, and to learn about those views in an academic setting.</p>

<p>‘I value and support these conversations with students, and I know that students value these conversations with their peers as well.’ </p>

<p>Crankshaw defended his comments telling The National Review he was exercising his constitutional rights.</p>

<p>‘The views I expressed on my Facebook page are my personal views that I shared on my personal time,' he said.</p>

<p>‘I have a First Amendment right to express them just as Nick Sandmann has a First Amendment right to express his.’ </p>

<p>Amber Duke, the deputy director of the ACLU offices in Kentucky, told DailyMail.com: 'These were personal views expressed on personal time on a personal Facebook account.</p>

<p>'The views in this post do not necessarily reflect the views of the ACLU of Kentucky.</p>

<p>'As a stalwart defender of the First Amendment, the ACLU of Kentucky respects its employees' freedom to express themselves on their own time.' </p>

<p>The ACLU has long prided itself on advocating for the constitutional rights of Americans regardless of political affiliation, though during the Trump era it has been accused of using its clout to favor liberal causes.</p>

<p>In 1978, the ACLU famously defended the rights of neo-Nazis seeking to march through the Chicago suburb of Skokie, Illinois, a town with a large population of Holocaust survivors. </p>

<p>Sandmann shot to national attention after the incident with Native American activist Phillips in January 2019.</p>

<p>Phillips went up to the student wearing his new red 'MAGA' hat, and pounded on a drum a few inches from his face. </p>

<p>The teenager was excoriated in the media for a smirk he had during the confrontation.</p>

<p>Both Sandmann and Phillips later said they were trying to defuse tensions among three separate groups participating in various demonstrations, including Black Hebrew Israelites who had arrived apparently to counter-protest the Native Americans. </p>

<p>Sandmann, who last month spoke at the Republican National Convention (pictured), sued several news outlets and publications over their coverage of the incident</p>

<p>Sandmann said in August that his 'awkward smile' was an attempt to hide his thoughts and avoid embarrassing himself or further instigating Phillips. </p>

<p>Sandmann reached financial settlements with CNN and The Washington Post, who he sued for defamation.</p>

<p>The amount was nearly disclosed due to a quirk in court rules, but will now remain confidential after the pandemic delayed scheduled hearings until after his 18th birthday.</p>

<p>Sandmann has also sued the three major television networks - NBC, ABC, and CBS - as well as Rolling Stone magazine, Gannett, and The New York Times.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Sandmann appeared to hint that Twitter would also be sued, tweeting: ‘Don’t hold your breath <?php echo e('@'); ?>jack.’</p>

<p>The tweet was directed at Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO.    </p>

<p>Sandmann, who was recently hired to help Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's re-election effort in Kentucky, spoke about the controversial Lincoln Memorial encounter at the Republican National Convention last month.</p>

<p>'My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode,' Sandmann claimed during his nationally televised speech on August 25. </p>

<p>'They did so without ever researching the full video of the incident; without ever investigating Mr. Philips' motives; or without ever asking me for my side of the story. And do you know why? Because the truth wasn't important.'</p>

<p>'I learned that what was happening to me had a name. It was called being canceled,' he continued. 'Canceled is what's happening to people around this country who refuse to be silenced by the far left. Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened. Often, the media is a willing participant.'</p>

<p>Sandmann insisted: 'But I wouldn't be cancelled. I fought back hard to expose the media for what they did to me and won a personal victory.'</p>

<p>'While much more must be done, I look forward to the day that the media returns to providing balanced, responsible and accountable news coverage. I know President Trump hopes for that too,' Sandmann concluded his remarks.</p>

<p>He also claimed Trump is the biggest 'victim of unfair media coverage.'</p>

<p>Sandmann told the convention that he bought the 'MAGA' hat while he was in Washington, DC, on a school trip to participate in the pro-life March for Life annual protest through the capital.</p>

<p>'In January 2019, I attended the March for Life in Washington D.C. where I demonstrated in defense of the unborn,' Sandmann detailed during his pre-recorded speech. </p>

<p>'Later that day, I bought a "Make America Great Again" hat because our president, Donald Trump, has distinguished himself as the most pro-life Presidents in the history of our country and I wanted to express my support for him too.' </p>

<p>Good evening everyone. My name is Nick Sandmann. I’m the teenager who was defamed by the media after an encounter with a group of protestors on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial last year.</p>

<p>Before I begin, I’d like to thank President Trump for the opportunity to share some of my story and why it matters so much to this November’s election.</p>

<p>In January 2019, I attended the March for Life in Washington D.C. where I demonstrated in defense of the unborn. Later that day, I bought a “Make America Great Again” hat because our President, Donald Trump, has distinguished himself as the most pro-life Presidents in the history of our country and I wanted to express my support for him too. Looking back now, how could I possibly have imagined that the simple act of putting on that red hat would unleash the hate from the left and make myself the target of network and cable news networks, nationwide?</p>

<p>Being from Kentucky, the birth place of Abraham Lincoln, my classmates and I visited the Lincoln Memorial. I found myself face-to-face with Nathan Phillips and other professional protestors looking to turn me into the latest poster child showing why Trump is bad. While the media portrayed me as the aggressor with a “relentless smirk” on my face, in reality the video confirms I was standing with my hands behind my back and an awkward smile on my face that hid two thoughts. One, don’t do anything that might further agitate the man banging a drum in my face and two, trying to follow a family friend’s advice never to do anything to embarrass your family, your school, or your community.</p>

<p>Before I knew what was happening, it was over. One of Mr. Phillips fellow agitators yelled out “We got him!”, “It's all right here on video” and We won Grandpa”. What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage.</p>

<p>My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode. They did so without ever researching the full video of the incident; without ever investigating Mr. Philips’ motives; or without ever asking me for my side of the story. And do you know why? Because the truth wasn’t important. Advancing their anti-Christian, anti-Conservative, anti-Donald Trump narrative was all that mattered. And if advancing their narrative ruined the reputation and future of a teenager from Covington, Kentucky…so be it. That will teach him not to wear a MAGA hat!</p>

<p>I learned that what was happening to me had a name. It was called being cancelled. As in annulled. As in revoked. As in made void.</p>

<p>Cancelled is what’s happening to people around this country who refuse to be silenced by the far left. Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened. Often, the media is a willing participant.</p>

<p>But I wouldn’t be cancelled. I fought back hard to expose the media for what they did to me and won a personal victory. While much more must be done, I look forward to the day that the media returns to providing balanced, responsible and accountable news coverage.</p>

<p>I know President Trump hopes for that too. I’m proud to say that throughout my media nightmare I have had President Trump’s unwavering support. And I know you’ll agree with me when I say no one in this county has been a victim of unfair media coverage more than President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>In November, I believe this country must unite around a President who calls the media out and refuses to allow them to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts.</p>

<p>I believe we must join with a President who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism.</p>

<p>And together, I believe we must all embrace our 1st Amendment rights and not hide in fear of the media, or from the tech companies or the outrage mob either.</p>

<p>This is worth fighting for. This is worth voting for. This is what President Donald Trump stands for.</p>

<p>Thank you all for listening to me tonight. And one more thing… let’s Make America Great Again!</p>
