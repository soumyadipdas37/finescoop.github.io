<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>I bet Pippa Middleton is green with envy after seeing this snap posted on Instagram of her brother James and fiancee Alizee Thevenet sailing off Sicily.</p>

<p>While James and Alizee were enjoying the Italian sunshine, Pippa, hubby James Matthews and toddler son Arthur had to cope with changeable British weather as they chartered a boat to the Channel Islands.</p>

<p>They were forced to scrap their getaway to the Caribbean island of St Barts, where James’s family have a luxury resort, due to Covid restrictions.</p>

<p>But fret not. I hear the happy couple maintained their usual high standards by dining on lobster and champagne.</p>

<p>James Middleton and James and fiancee Alizee Thevenet have been sailing off Sicily</p>

<p>The couple have managed to avoid the Covid lockdown by remaining in Italy </p>

<p>And while on holiday have posted a series of photographs outlining their trip on Instagram </p>

<p>Pippa, pictured here arriving at last year's Wimbledon tennis tournament with her husband James Matthews</p>

<p>One famous face who won’t be munching critters on this year’s I’m A Celebrity is Martin Kemp.</p>

<p>I hear the 58-year-old Spandau Ballet star, whose son Roman finished third on last year’s series, was being badgered mercilessly by producers to take part. </p>

<p>My mole says: ‘Martin could have written his own cheque but did not fancy it.’ </p>

<p>Nothing to do with the fact this year celebs will miss out on the all-expenses-paid trip to sunny Oz and have to do with a rain-soaked castle in Wales instead?</p>
