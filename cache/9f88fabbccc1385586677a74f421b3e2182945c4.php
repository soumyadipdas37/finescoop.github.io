<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Yorkshire were forced to withdraw captain David Willey and three other players from the Roses' defeat at Headingley due to coronavirus protocols.</p>

<p>With a member of the squad within their training bubble reporting symptoms, the club ruled out Willey. </p>

<p>Vice-captain Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Matthew Fisher and Josh Poysden were also pulled out in accordance with their Covid-19 guidelines.</p>

<p>David Willey was forced to sit-out of Yorkshire's defeat to Lancashire on Monday evening </p>

<p>The Roses captain could not contribute as Yorkshire lost to Lancashire, a blow to their hopes</p>

<p>Yorkshire had hoped to include them but were unable to as the results of a Covid test on the player in question were not received ahead of the 6.15pm start to a match that all-but ended their chances of qualifying for the quarter-finals of the Vitality Blast.</p>

<p>Adam Lyth was stand-in skipper for the Roses, while Dawid Malan - who faced Australia and Pakistan in England's recent T-20s - also returned to the side. </p>

<p>Lancashire strengthened their hold on second place in the northern group and are well placed to seal a last-eight spot following a comfortable chase of 146 against their under-par hosts.</p>

<p>Adam Lyth was the stand-in captain as Yorkshire stuttered without four of their main men </p>
