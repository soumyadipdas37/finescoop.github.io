<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The husband of missing mom Suzanne Morphew is hitting back after it was revealed he spent the night before his wife was reported missing in a cheap hotel room that reeked of chlorine. </p>

<p>In an interview with Fox 21 on Friday, Barry Morphew denied any wrongdoing inside his suite at the Holiday Inn in Broomfield, Colorado, following sensational claims his co-worker, Jeff Puckett, made earlier this week. </p>

<p>Puckett exclusively told DailyMail.com on Wednesday that he arrived at the hotel room on May 10 to find it scattered with wet towels and mail belonging to Barry. </p>

<p>The same day, police started a search for Suzanne, 49, who failed to return to the family home in Maysville, Colorado.  </p>

<p>On Friday, more almost four month's after his wife's disappearance, Barry defiantly stated: ' I did nothing wrong in the hotel. There's cameras all over the hotel, I did nothing wrong.'</p>

<p>Barry Morphew, the husband of missing Colorado mom Suzanne Morphew (pictured together) spent the night before she was reported missing in a budget hotel room in Broomfield, Colorado that smelled strongly of chlorine </p>

<p>Barry stayed at this Holiday Inn hotel room on May 9, before leaving to return to his hometown of Maysville the following day. His co-worker, Jeff Puckett, then checked in and says he found the room scattered with wet towels and stinking of chlorine</p>

<p>Jeff Puckett (pictured) was hired by Barry for work on a landscaping project near Broomfield. But the job never materialized and he told DailyMail.com that the experience has left him suspicious</p>

<p>Barry, who works as a landscaper, told Fox 21 he hired Puckett to help him with a ob in Broomfield - more than 100 miles from the $1.5 million Maysville home where he lived with Suzanne.</p>

<p>'I said listen, I need to do this job, I will pay you good money to come and help me,' Barry said of Puckett. </p>

<p>Barry checked in to the hotel on May 9 - one day before Suzanne was reported missing by the couple's two adult daughters, Mallory and Macy.  </p>

<p>He left the Holiday Inn the following day to head home to Maysville to speak with police and join in the search for his missing wife. </p>

<p>Puckett arrived at the hotel room on the evening of May 10, as the landscaping job was set to continue. </p>

<p>'I got there and the room smelled like chlorine real bad,' Puckett told DailyMail.com in an exclusive interview. </p>

<p>'It was his room and he'd taken a shower – his towels were all over the floor.' </p>

<p>Puckett also claimed he discovered a pile of mail in the room, including a letter about property insurance, which he later turned over to the FBI.</p>

<p>He told DailyMail.com: 'I found some mail in the hotel room. His mail was in there and I gave it to the FBI. I thought it was kind of odd to have it there.</p>

<p>'Some of it was from an insurance company, like insuring your property, that kind of thing.' </p>

<p>Speaking with Fox 21, Barry admitted that the room smelled strongly of chlorine, but claims he had nothing to do with the stench. </p>

<p>'I'm not going to beat around the bush... it smelled [of chlorine] real strong,' he conceded. </p>

<p>'I did not go to the pool and I did not get chlorine. I'm sure that they washed the rooms with that for the COVID. I don't know, but I [smelled] it too when I was in there,' Barry further stated. </p>

<p>However, a  manager at the $92-a-night property told DailyMail.com that they do not use chlorine to clean guest rooms. The pool is also currently closed. </p>

<p>Barry and Suzanne have been married more than two decades, and are parents to daughter Mallory and Macy (pictured) </p>

<p>Barry says he has nothing  </p>

<p> Meanwhile, Puckett said there were no tools waiting for him at the hotel and the alleged landscaping job never went ahead.</p>

<p>He also never got to see the job site.  </p>

<p>As a result, he says the experience has left him suspicious. 'It's kind of weird,' he told DailyMail.com. My first thought was that this must be like an alibi. That's what it felt like.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I hope they find her alive but it's been a long time.'</p>

<p>All of Puckett's information has been passed to police by DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Barry told Fox 21 that he does not believe Puckett is a reliable source of information because he 'was in prison for nine years.'</p>

<p>'I gave Jeff Puckett a job and an opportunity.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Suzanne's brother, Andy Moorman, said the Holiday Inn hotel room wasn't the only place there was an unusual stench. </p>

<p>'From what I understood secondhand, they said there was an overwhelming smell of bleach in the home,' Moorman told Fox 21. </p>

<p>Andy earlier told the news network that he has not had much contact with Barry since his sister vanished.  </p>

<p>'The problem I have with that is I don't feel like he's fully cooperating with investigators.</p>

<p>'He should have taken a lie detector and a voice analysis, anything else they ask him to do. And he's gone kinda quiet,' he stated. </p>

<p>Andy, an attorney based in Anderson, Indiana, said he has not heard from either of his nieces since their mother vanished.</p>

<p>The 58-year-old is now fundraising for a new search for Suzanne due to take place at the end of September and took part in a vigil for his sister on Sunday night during which he said he didn't expect to find her alive.</p>

<p>The new round of fundraising comes on top of a GoFundMe page set up by Barry and his nephew Trevor Noel, 36, of Evergreen, Colorado.</p>

<p>It has raised almost $33,000 so far with the funds due to be spent on searching for Suzanne – although DailyMail.com can reveal that no organized searches are currently taking place.</p>

<p>Barry and other family members have also offered a $200,000 reward for information leading to Suzanne's safe return. </p>

<p>In late May, police took custody of the Morphew family's $1.5 million residence to carry out a search. The home was later released back to Barry and his daughters </p>

<p>Suzanne was reported missing on Mother's Day, May 10. </p>

<p>Her bike was found the same day by a bridge close to her luxury $1.5 million home, prompting police to theorize she may have set off on a bike ride before she vanished. </p>

<p>One week after Suzanne's disappearance, Barry released a video announcing a $100,000 reward for her safe return. He then retreated from the public eye.</p>

<p>Suzanne's disappearance sparked an extensive search that included tracking dogs, water rescue teams and tactical mountain rescuers. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation and the FBI were also called in. </p>

<p>Cops were seen carrying evidence bags and equipment into the home.</p>

<p>A CSI photographer was spotted on the premises, and evidence bags were pictured being brought out and loaded into a van before the house handed it back to the family on May 28.</p>

<p>A second search was conducted in July, but police did not say whether or not they had obtained anything of interest.</p>

<p>Chaffee County Sheriff John Spezze says more that a dozen detectives are still working around the clock.</p>
