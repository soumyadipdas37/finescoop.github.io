<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Block contestants were left heartbroken on Tuesday night's episode, as the coronavirus pandemic meant the entire Melbourne set had to shut down for six weeks. </p>

<p>But host Scotty Cam certainly kept momentum up during the difficult period, which saw filming come to a grinding halt back in March.</p>

<p>It was revealed this week that the presenter gave the Blockheads a number of video challenges for teams to complete at home, with the winners receiving money which would go towards their housing projects.</p>

<p>Keeping busy! One of the hilarious tasks was for the isolated contestants to take their bins out in style in the 'bin-iso challenge' - a trend which has featured many times on TikTok throughout the pandemic. Pictured: Harry and Tash </p>

<p>One of the hilarious tasks was for the isolated contestants to take their bins out in style, in the 'bin-iso challenge' - a trend which has featured many times on TikTok throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>In footage shared by Channel Nine, Harry and Tash were seen taking a somewhat flamboyant approach to the task - with Harry emerging playing an accordion, while Tash wore a skimpy bodysuit and knee-high boots as she pulled the bin behind him.  </p>

<p>But it was Luke and Jasmin who were crowned winners of the task, seen taking out the trash in an Addams Family-themed video - which saw their whole family dressed in gothic attire as they sauntered down the drive way together.</p>

<p>Great work! It was Luke and Jasmin (pictured) who were crowned winners of the task, seen taking out the trash in an Addams Family-themed video - which saw their whole family dressed in gothic attire as they sauntered down the drive way</p>

<p>The bin challenge wasn't the only win for Luke and Jasmin, as they were also crowned the winners of a high-intensity home workout competition.</p>

<p>'Do the blockslide! Stay inside,' the pair said as they moved their bodies in the video, before bouncing in the air and saying: 'Lift those thighs, sanitize!'</p>

<p>The pair later admitted that the footage was 'cringeworthy'. </p>

<p>'Making these really kept us occupied and the competition going! Everyone’s videos were so hilarious,' the pair said of the tasks. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, in another Tik-Tok inspired clip, George was seen switching places with Sarah in the mirror in a 'flip the switch' challenge. </p>

<p>While Sarah was seen wearing high-vis clothing during the first half of the footage, the camera then flicked to George - who was seen sporting the very same shirt, which barely managed to cover his body.   </p>

<p>The Block continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine</p>
