<p>Speaking ahead of his new series in which he explores both sides of the political and cultural divide in America, Mr Perry said: ‘The Left is more venal and has more antipathy to the opposition than the other way round. </p>

<p>'I would say the Right on average are friendlier and more open.’</p>

<p>Grayson Perry, 60, explores both sides of the political and cultural divide in a new series, Big American Road Trip. He confesses that, on average, people on the Right are 'friendlier and more open’</p>

<p>During filming for the show he said he confronted a group of wealthy liberals he met at a dinner party in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>He recalled asking whether they feared their lifestyle had fuelled the resentment which led to the election of Donald Trump as President, adding that this suggestion made them angry. </p>

<p>Mr Perry, 60, told Radio Times: ‘I really laid into them. I was well p*****, so I didn’t quite have my full faculties, and they got hostile, but it all settled down.’</p>

<p>Speaking of the shame many white middle class people on the Left feel, he said: ‘It’s all part of the tribal culture to be guilty – we do guilty in the same way that the Japanese do shame.’</p>

<p>While making the programme, which will be broadcast on Channel 4, he also filmed a group of ‘bikers for Trump’.  </p>

<p>Any concerns he had about their potential for hostility rapidly evaporated upon meeting them. </p>

<p>He said: ‘Some of them were a bit disappointed I didn’t turn up in a dress.’ </p>

<p>Mr Perry said he enjoyed making the show in the US because of the frank-talking attitudes he encountered.</p>

<p>He added: ‘America is a great place to make a documentary because people will give you their life story at the drop of a hat because I was an outsider.’</p>

<p>Mr Perry has become an iconic figure in the art world, celebrated for his ceramic vases and tapestries. He won the Turner Prize in 2003.</p>

<p>He has become well known to the wider public as an occasional transvestite who good-humouredly expresses his outspoken views in his television programmes.</p>

<p>Grayson Perry’s Big American Road Trip begins on Channel 4 next Wednesday.  </p>
