<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The New Inn has been around since the 16th century — but at least the sign is new,  following a revamp by two bright young things who are trying to grow a brand called Baz &amp; Fred.</p>

<p>That's Harry 'Baz' Henriques and Fred Hicks. Still in their 20s, they are school friends from the Cotswolds and the idea, according to the general manager, is to 'bring a bit of London' to the countryside. </p>

<p>Which sounds horrible — but when pressed further, he says the plan is to make it 'fun'. </p>

<p>In its previous incarnation it was more formal, more 'fine dining', more expensive. And it is fun. Stylish, too, after receiving the full Farrow &amp; Ball treatment, plus lots of new wood in the bar area, giving off a beach shack vibe. There is even a little booth with neon lights spelling out Baz &amp; Fred.</p>

<p>In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they soon ditch the name New Inn and just call it Baz &amp; Fred.</p>

<p>It helps that all this is housed in an exquisite, honey-coloured building in Coln St Aldwyns, one of the most beautiful honey-coloured villages in a part of Gloucestershire that has not yet fallen victim to its elegance.</p>

<p>There are 14 rooms. Ours is charming, with a few black-and-white, framed photographs of the Cotswolds, traditional Burlington basin and taps, and a comfortable, well-dressed bed.</p>

<p>We are here only three days after it reopened and the excitement is palpable.</p>

<p>Locals are flooding in, plus friends of Baz and (sorry, &amp;) Fred.</p>

<p>Rating:</p>

<p>The menu is mainly posh burgers, but we start with a superb burrata and tomato salad and a fabulous bruschetta with anchovies draped over it.</p>

<p>The burgers are top-notch and the atmosphere so fresh and convivial that we forgive some of the lapses in concentration.</p>

<p>We order mustard, nothing arrives; nor do two dips for our chips — and I have to ask three times for my glass of red.</p>

<p>Worse, my burger turns up as I'm halfway through my starter.</p>

<p>'Roll with it,' says my wife, anxious to avoid a scene. So I do roll with it, happily.</p>

<p>Then I hear that Baz &amp; Fred aren't around this evening to sort out some of the rough edges, which, so soon after launching, seems a little careless.</p>
