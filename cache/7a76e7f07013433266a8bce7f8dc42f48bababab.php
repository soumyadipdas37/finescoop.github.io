<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A nutritionist has shared the ultimate guide to a good night's sleep - including turning your bedroom into a sanctuary and avoiding spicy food before bed.</p>

<p>Cookbook author Lee Holmes, from Sydney, revealed the key things troubled sleepers should do every day - and the 'sleep-enhancing' ingredients to eat or drink.</p>

<p>Besides recharging for a new day, the nutrition couch said not getting enough shut eye can impact our brain, mood, metabolism, hormones and appetite.</p>

<p>'We all know we need sleep, so if it has become a problem for you, maybe now is a good time to prioritise it,' she explained in her latest blog post. </p>

<p>'Rest is a massive piece in the puzzle of health and is vital for our brains, immune system, digestive system and ability to function as a human being.' </p>

<p>Nutritionist Lee Holmes (pictured) has shared the ultimate guide to a good night's sleep </p>

<p>To get started, Lee advised you need to get on top of your sleep hygiene to ensure you get at least eight hours of shut eye per night.</p>

<p>She suggested creating a 'calming' night-time routine like taking a warm bath or shower, writing or drawing in a journal, meditating or deep breathing, listening to music or reading a book to wind down completely before bed.</p>

<p>Lee said your room should always be a place for rest, and nothing else.</p>

<p>'Your room should be your sanctuary. Let me repeat that: your bedroom should be your sanctuary. Stop doing work on your bed! Before bed, your room should be pitch black, at a cool temperature and as quiet as possible,' she suggested.</p>

<p>For dinner, the founder of Supercharged Food explained your meal should include foods with a low GI, combined with protein and healthy fat.</p>

<p>GI - or glycaemic index - is a way of ranking carbohydrate-containing foods based on how slowly or quickly they are digested and increase blood glucose levels.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion have a higher glycaemic index. These high GI carbohydrates, such as a baked potato, release their glucose into the blood quickly.</p>

<p>Lee suggested eating a 'whole and balanced meal' filled with non-starchy vegetables such as tomatoes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower, 'your favourite protein' and some avocado can help 'keep you full and satisfied, without feeling overstuffed'.</p>

<p>'Avoid foods that are super spicy and rich, overly fatty and stimulating, especially before bed,' she said.</p>

<p>'Your room should be your sanctuary': Lee said your room should always be a place for rest</p>

<p>For a daily mineral intake, Lee said her go to is magnesium as it helps support the 'health of the nervous system, musculoskeletal system and digestive system'.</p>

<p>'It also produces specific neurotransmitters that regulate our stress and sleep response,' she said.</p>

<p>She pointed out many are magnesium deficient so she eating magnesium-rich food such as nuts and seeds, bananas, avocado, spinach and beans.</p>

<p>To up your intake of vitamin B6, she suggested eating poultry such as chicken or turkey, oats, bananas, pumpkin and even fish.</p>

<p>'Chicken and turkey are great for sleep. Both chicken and turkey contain the amino acid tryptophan, which helps make serotonin, causing a relaxing mood, which then helps produce melatonin,' she said.</p>

<p>'Fish is another source of vitamin B6, giving your body the heads up that it's time to produce melatonin and get sleepy.'</p>

<p>If you're still struggling to fall asleep at night, Lee suggested drinking tart cherry juice because it will help support healthy bacteria in the gut.</p>

<p>'Current clinical research is discovering that tart cherries can increase our time asleep and sleep efficiency. Tart cherry juice helps regulate our circadian rhythm (our sleep-wake cycle) and is also a potent antioxidant. Drink up,' she explained.</p>
