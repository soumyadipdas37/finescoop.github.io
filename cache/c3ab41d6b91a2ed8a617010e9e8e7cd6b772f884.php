<p>Sadiq's defeat came just 40 seconds into round 12 of the WBA gold belt bout, but it represented just his second loss in a 12-fight career to date.</p>

<p>The Ilford boxer - who was born in Nigeria - has six knockouts among his 10 professional wins, and has been preparing for a British title shot against Lerrone Richards.</p>

<p>However, after discovering his fight with Richards would not take place in September, Sadiq decided to fight Chudinov.</p>

<p>The British boxer was only informed of the fight three-and-a-half weeks ago, and after undergoing a coronavirus test and finalising an agreement last week he flew out to Russia. </p>

<p>However, he came up short against former WBA world champion Chudinov, who is now on a nine-fight winning streak.</p>

<p>The Russian is pushing for a mandatory title challenge against current WBA champion Callum Smith, with his win on Friday making him the form runner to face the Brit next.</p>
