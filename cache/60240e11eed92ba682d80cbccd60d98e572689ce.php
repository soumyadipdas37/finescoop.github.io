<p>The same day, evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people were issued to residents living in Napa and Sonoma counties - the heart of Callifornia's wine country. </p>

<p>Several vineyards have already been torched in the Glass Fire, including the Chateau Boswell, also located in St. Helena. </p>

<p>The Chateau Boswell, established back in 1979, was one of the most reputable wineries in the Napa region, with visitors flocking the famous site from across the world. </p>

<p>The Glass Fire also destroyed $5 million worth of wine at the nearby Castello di Amorosa, but firefighters managed to save a $30 million castle-style structure on the estate. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are fears that smoke contamination could destroy an entire year's worth of grapes in California's wine country, even if vineyards managed to be saved. </p>

<p>According to ABC 7, trace levels of smoke taint have already been detected in grapes at Sonoma's McEvoy Ranch. </p>

<p>Smoke exposure often makes wine taste sour and bitter, meaning that exposed grapes are rendered unusable. </p>

<p>Samantha Dorsey, who is president of McEvoy Ranch, says the grapes will now be left to rot.  </p>

<p>'It's devastating because it's an entire year's worth of work," she told the news network. </p>
