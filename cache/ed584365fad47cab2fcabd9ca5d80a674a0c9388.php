<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold was shown his new player ratings for the upcoming FIFA 21 gameÂ </p>

<p>The full-back was happy with his high rating of 87 which places him in the top 50 players</p>

<p>The Premier League winner, who plays his fair share of the virtual football game, was pleased overall but took aim at one of the statistics he was handed.</p>

<p>'Yeah I'm happy, of course! 87. Wow, thats high!', Alexander-Arnold told Dan Walker as he was shown his ratings card on Football Focus.Â Â </p>

<p>The Liverpool man was given a relatively low rating of 66 for his shooting despite showcasing his impressive ability in front of goal with three stunning free kicks in the Reds' title-winning campaign.</p>

<p>'Maybe they put that in there because it's my squad number' '(I scored) Four goals (last season) from full-back', Alexander-Arnold joked.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old thought his shooting score of 66 he was given should have been higherÂ </p>

<p>'Maybe (the rating is harsh), I don't know! I'm not going to challenge it too much. I would have liked it to be higher though!'</p>

<p>The gifted full-back netted sweetly-struck dead ball goals twice against Chelsea and once against Crystal Palace, as well as a neat finish from distance against Leicester last term.Â </p>

<p>Alexander-Arnold's Liverpool team-mates Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane were all given ratings of 90 for the new game, placing them inside the top 10 players overall.</p>

<p>The game is set to be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows on October 9.Â </p>

<p>Alexander-Arnold showed his scoring ability with four goals last term, three of them free-kicks</p>
