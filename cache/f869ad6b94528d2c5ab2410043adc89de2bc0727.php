<p>Reflecting: Gabby Douglas took to Instagram on Thursday to speak candidly about her emotional hair journey and how she, eventually, overcame the 'challenge'</p>

<p>Gabby added that the damage from the recurring 'tight ponytails' got so bad that it led to her having 'bald spots on the back of [her] head.'</p>

<p>'I was so embarrassed and self-conscious that i put a bunch of clips over the spots to try and cover them up, but it was still noticeable,' she explained.  </p>

<p>'My hair grew a little, but shortly after, i had to cut all of my hair off because it was so damaged. i cried and cried and cried.'</p>

<p>Gabby admitted that 'most days [she] didn’t even want to go to the gym because [she] felt so embarrassed that all [her] hair was gone.'</p>

<p>Years of damage: 'From a very young age i always had to put my hair in a tight ponytail to do gymnastics and due to that my hair became completely damaged,' began the 24-year-old Olympian in her post's lengthy caption; Gabby pictured in 2012</p>

<p>'I used to think: why can’t i have healthy hair? despite yet another challenge, i kept going. fast forward to the both olympics and my hair was the topic of conversation.'</p>

<p>Gabby was referencing to her legendary participation in the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, where she was met with an influx of criticism over her hair online.</p>

<p>'now here i am today - no extensions - no clip-ins - no wigs - no chemicals - all me,' the gymnast concluded. </p>

<p>Topic of conversation: 'I used to think: why can’t i have healthy hair? despite yet another challenge, i kept going. fast forward to the both olympics and my hair was the topic of conversation,' she recalled; Douglas pictured in 2017</p>
