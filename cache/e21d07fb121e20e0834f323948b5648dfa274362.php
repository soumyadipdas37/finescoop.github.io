<p>The £28,000 giveaway: Play our Fantasy Share Picking Game, in association with Fidelity International, for your chance to win £22,000 worth of main prizes and £6,000 worth of weekly prizes</p>

<p>The Fantasy Share Picking Game is easy and fun to play and offers the chance to compete for both the jackpot and weekly prizes, to play for glory against those you know, and to learn more about investing in the stock market. </p>

<p>If you played last year's game then you will know what to do, but if you didn't it is simple and straightforward to pick up. </p>

<p>Anthony Pepler got interested in shares after a student challenge at school. At 25, the musician won This is Money's fantasy share picking game last year</p>

<p>Last year's winner was 25-year-old Anthony Pepler, who said he first got interested in investing as a teenager after taking part in a student investor challenge.</p>

<p>The musician and composer, of Bournemouth, Dorset, said of winning the game: It's been a brilliant opportunity and a lot of fun'.</p>

<p>This year's share picking game gives you the opportunity to pit your share picking skills - and luck - against fellow players, friends and family, members of the This is Money team and a pair of celebrity participants.</p>

<p>They are quiz stars Shaun Wallace and Anne Hegarty, who will be playing the game over the 12 weeks and have already started looking at shares to pick.</p>

<p>Asked about her strategy, Anne said: 'I suppose I am trying to think about what kinds of things will be in demand and then choose companies that offer those products or services. For example, I’ve picked a bank, and it’s value has stayed up. </p>

<p>'People are working from home more because of the coronavirus, that’s one trend. Another might be avoiding investing in oil companies for example, as more people aren’t driving to work at the moment and therefore aren’t using petrol. </p>

<p>'But then again, I also picked a company that is developing a coronavirus test, and that share slumped in a day.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, asked to rate his chances of success in the game out of ten, Shaun replied: 'I’d say six. I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm a barrister as opposed to an entrepreneur so I'm not going to pretend that I know everything about trading because I don't.'</p>

<p>Players pick shares to add to their holdings. They can hold them to the end of the game, or sell out early; you may want to do this to either bank gains, or cut your losses.</p>

<p>The percentage difference between the share price when you buy your pick and the price at the end of the game, or when you sell, is the gain or loss added to your performance.</p>

<p>If the share price goes up while you hold it, you make a gain. If the share price goes down while you hold it you make a loss.</p>

<p>You can make a maximum of ten new picks per week but sell shares as many times as you like.</p>

<p>You cannot pick the same company twice in one day </p>

<p>The winner is the player with the greatest aggregate gains.</p>

<p>If you have ever fancied yourself as a bit of a stock market wizard, then our Fantasy Share Picking Game is definitely for you.</p>

<p>But even if you don't buy and sell shares, or keep an eye on the stock market regularly, it is easy to play.</p>

<p>The game is simple and you have every chance of beating those who reckon they know it all.</p>

<p>All you need to do is sign up to the game and then pick shares from companies listed on the UK's main stock markets and your portfolio's gains and losses will determine your performance.</p>

<p>You must pick six shares to be eligible to play in the main league and in a change for this year's game, you can pick a maximum of 10 new shares per week.</p>

<p>You can also set up private leagues to compete against friends and family. </p>

<p>As a helping hand we have signposted where to find the stock market data, business and investing articles, and share tips that can help you choose them. </p>

<p>Our Fantasy Share Picking Game will allow you to play in the main prize league and challenge your friends in private leagues</p>

<p>£15,000 grand prize</p>

<p>The winner of the grand prize will be the player with the best performance, whose share prices increase the most over 12 weeks.</p>

<p>But remember share prices can go up and down, so not only will you need to pick the stock market's winners, but you will also want to avoid the losers.</p>

<p>You can sell out of shares that you have picked; either to bank your gains, or to cut your losses.</p>

<p>Performance is aggregated, which means if you buy and sell a share that increases by 10 per cent, another one that increases by 5 per cent, and another one that decreases by 2 per cent, then you would have an aggregated performance of 13 per cent (10% + 5% - 2% = 13%).</p>

<p>If you miss out on the top spot, don't despair. We're also giving away a cash prize of £5,000 for the player who comes in second place.  </p>

<p>£2,000 third prize </p>

<p>One lucky player who comes in third place will grab themselves a cash prize worth £2,000.</p>

<p>£500 weekly prizes</p>

<p>We will give away a £500 cash prize for the best share pick each week.</p>

<p>To win a weekly prize you need to pick a share that increases in price the most between the open of market trading on Monday morning and the close of trading on the Friday that week.</p>

<p>Players will be entered for the weekly prize automatically in any week that they pick a new share for their main prize league portfolio.</p>

<p>Don't forget you can also set up private leagues to pit your skills against friends, family and colleagues. Find out how to invite them by signing up to the game.</p>
