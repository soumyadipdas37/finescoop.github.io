<p>TBT: Alicia Silverstone reminisced on Instagram on Thursday, with a throwback post to when she did yoga with her adorable son Bear Blu, now nine, last year</p>

<p>Alicia's hair hung loose in the snaps, blending in with Bear's coif which was partially up.</p>

<p>She wore a black leotard and leggings, while her little boy was in a black graphic t-shirt and red shorts. </p>

<p>They appeared to be sitting on the floor of a bedroom, on a circular ombre rug decorated with a crescent moon. </p>

<p>In one sweet image, Bear turned his head as his mom leaned in to give him a kiss.  </p>

<p>The little kid had his hands in prayer position, typical of a yoga class.</p>

<p>'It's not often that I get to do yoga... let alone have my son join me! He isn't a big fan of yoga, but sometimes he gets into it, and when he does it's the sweetest thing!' Silverstone captioned the post, along with some yogi emojis. </p>

<p>'These photos are from last year, but they’re too cute not to share. #tbt' she concluded. </p>

<p>Special moments: In the middle of last month, the Batman And Robin actress posted a lovely picture of herself and Bear with the boy's father, her ex-husband Christopher Jarecki</p>

<p>The trio beamed from a swimming pool in the summer snap, which Alicia captioned: 'Perfect day for a pool day!' </p>

<p>Silverstone and Jarecki were married from 2005 until 2018, but appear to remain more than amicable co-parents, judging from the recent post.</p>

<p>That share comes during a summer in which the notorious vegan is celebrating 25 years since the release of Clueless, the teen comedy directed by Amy Heckerling that launched Silverstone's career.</p>

<p>She's posted stills from the film, which came out on July 19th, 1995, as well as video snippets.</p>

<p>Just last week, Alicia spoke with Vogue about the wealth of fashion from the film, including the beguiling skirt and jacket set she wore in the opening scene.</p>

<p>'Still have no idea where that iconic yellow plaid outfit is...' she wrote, in part, in the caption. </p>
