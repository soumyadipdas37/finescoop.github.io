<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Culture Secretary has told the National Trust it should be 'protecting our heritage' after the Trust decided to link Sir Winston Churchill's home to slavery.</p>

<p>Oliver Dowden is the latest critic of the decision and said the charity’s portrayal of the war-time leader in its audit of its historic properties would ‘surprise and disappoint people’.</p>

<p>He called on the Trust to focus its efforts on ‘preserving and protecting’ Britain's heritage and told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Churchill is one of Britain’s greatest heroes.</p>

<p>'He rallied the free world to defeat fascism. It will surprise and disappoint people that the National Trust appears to be making him a subject of criticism and controversy.’</p>

<p>The National Trust has come under fire after it published a list of 93 properties under its management that it says have links to slavery and colonialism.</p>

<p>Oliver Dowden (pictured on September 21) said the National Trust’s portrayal of the Winston Churchill in its audit of its historic properties would ‘surprise and disappoint people’</p>

<p>Members have threatened to cancel their subscriptions and historians have accused the Trust of being 'unfair' after the homes of Winston Churchill and Rudyard Kipling were among them.</p>

<p>Critics have accused the 'out of touch' Trust of 'woke virtue signalling' and 'alienating' fee-paying members who say the organisation is simply jumping on the Black Lives Matter bandwagon. </p>

<p>Reasons behind properties' inclusion on the list range from being owned by families who also owned plantations to more distant links such as Rudyard Kipling's home being included because 'the British Empire was a central theme and context of his literary output'.</p>

<p>Its entry on Chartwell, Churchill’s family home in Kent, noted that the politician was Colonies Secretary in the 1920s and had opposed independence for India. </p>

<p>The Trust said the year-long audit was ordered before the Black Lives Matters protests, which saw a statue of Edward Colston toppled from a plinth and thrown into a harbour in Bristol because of his role in the city's slave trade. </p>

<p>It comes as the organisation prepares to slash 1,200 jobs after losing £200 million in revenue due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Scroll down for the full list of the properties identified by Trust experts as being tied to colonialism and slavery and the reasons why in report published on Monday</p>

<p>Almost 100 National Trust properties have links to slavery and colonialism, including Sir Winston Churchill's former family home in Kent, Chartwell (above), the charity claims</p>

<p>The National Trust said it does not want to censor history, but added that it has a duty to inform its visitors about the origins its properties (above, Churchill's former home, Chartwell)</p>

<p>Powis Castle in mid-Wales was included because of its links to Robert Clive, known as Clive of India. </p>

<p>The British officer with the East India Company played a key role in Britain's colonial dominance in India and he amassed a vast collection of Indian artefacts, now housed at Powis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Assembly Rooms in Bath were named due to the city's connections to the wider colonial and slave economies during the 18th Century.</p>

<p>The survey also listed properties belonging to figures who fought against colonial exploitation and the slave trade. </p>

<p>Andrew Roberts, author of Churchill: Walking with Destiny, commented on Twitter: 'The National Trust's latest excursion into wokery - the latest of many - is to draw up a blacklist of its properties that are connected to Colonialism and Slavery (mixing the two very separate things up) &amp; putting Chartwell on it: Sad and wrong.'</p>

<p>He later told the Telegraph: 'It's a sign of how ignorant the National Trust has tragically become that it mixes up slavery with colonising, considering that Britain's mutually beneficial relationship with her colonies – to which Churchill was proud to dedicate his life – continued long after slavery ended in 1833, which was 41 years before Churchill was born.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dr Warren Dockter, a Churchill expert, told the newspaper: 'I think it's unfair to throw him in with Clive of India.</p>

<p>'He was a diehard imperialist, make no mistake, but he wasn't an Edward Colston or a slave trader.' </p>

<p>The trust has insisted it does not want to censor history, but that it has a duty to ensure its supporters and visitors know about the origins of some of its properties. </p>

<p>Lucy Trimnell, a Conservative councillor in Somerset, wrote online that she would cancel her family's membership, adding that she 'cannot support the naming and shaming of innocent families who left these properties to the custodianship of the National Trust'.</p>

<p>The statue of Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was vandalised with yellow graffiti saying 'is a racist' as Extinction Rebellion protest took place on September 10</p>

<p>Senior Tory MP Guy Opperman said it risked ‘legitimising’ attacks on Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square, which has been daubed with graffiti during recent protests. </p>

<p>He added: ‘This is manifestly wrong and not part of its mission statement or what it was created to do. My hope would be that the National Trust realises that the direction of travel is clearly wrong.’</p>

<p>The trust said the year-long audit was ordered before the Black Lives Matters protests and say the audit was commissioned in September.</p>

<p>It also says a working group of external specialists, chaired by museums and heritage consultant Rita McLean, will be advising and steering the Trust in this work in the coming months, and the Trust will also be working with other National Trust organisations around the world 'to connect these histories globally'.</p>

<p>Some of the research from the report has already been used to update the Trust's digital content and the Trust say it is supporting a review of visitor information and interpretation at 'relevant properties'. </p>

<p>People took to Facebook and Twitter to slam National Trust for their colonial and slavery report</p>

<p>The National Trust, which has 5.6million members and 500 historic sites around the UK, said it commissioned the report last September.</p>

<p>The audit details properties' links to slave traders but also to families whose plantations used slave labour, and who were paid compensation after the slave trade was abolished. </p>

<p>It said 29 trust properties had links to successful compensation claims, including Glastonbury Tor in Somerset and Blickling Hall in Norfolk.</p>

<p>The report also highlights figures involved in Britain's colonial history, including author Kipling and historian Thomas Carlyle, whose former homes are now run by the trust.</p>

<p>On Churchill's home in Kent, Chartwell, the report draws on his leadership during the Bengal Famine of 1943, his 'exceptionally long, complex and controversial life' and his position as Secretary of State for the Colonies (1921-1922) as the reason for its inclusion on the list.</p>

<p>They also note the fact he opposed the independence of India.</p>

<p>Despite noting his opposition to slavery, the home of poet William Wordsworth - Allan Bank in the Lake District - is included because his brother, John, served as Commander of an East India Company ship in 1801 and captained two successful voyages to China. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the report lists Bateman's - the home of author Rudyard Kipling - because 'the British Empire was a central theme and context of his literary output'.</p>

<p>The Assembly Rooms in Bath (above) were named in the report due to the city's connections to the wider colonial and slave economies during the 18th Century</p>

<p>Robert Clive, a British officer with the East India Company, had a key role in Britain's colonial dominance in India and he collected Indian artefacts, housed at Powis Castle (above) in Wales</p>

<p>The charity are accused of smearing key figures from British history, as the former family home of Churchill (left) and Powis Castle, which is linked to Robert Clive (right), made the audit</p>

<p>Dr Tarnya Cooper, the National Trust's curatorial and collections director, said the charity had a duty to research and share information.</p>

<p>She added: 'A significant number of those [properties] in our care have links to the colonisation of different parts of the world, and some to historic slavery.'</p>

<p>John Orna-Ornstein, the National Trust's Director of Culture and Engagement added: 'These histories are sometimes very painful and difficult to consider.</p>

<p>'They make us question our assumptions about the past, and yet they can also deepen and enrich our understanding of our economic status, our remarkable built heritage and the art, objects, places and spaces we have today and look after for future generations.'</p>

<p>In response to the criticism, a spokesman for the National Trust said: 'The National Trust has made a commitment to research, interpret and share the histories of slavery and the legacies of colonialism at the places we care for.</p>

<p>'We believe that only by honestly and openly acknowledging and sharing those stories can we do justice to the true complexity of the past, and the role that Britain, and Britons, have played in global history.</p>

<p>'This report is a continuation of – not a departure from – the work we already do to explore and share the histories of the places in our care.</p>

<p>'We undertook a programme of research in June this year with a mixed sample of National Trust supporters, members, visitors and the general public.</p>

<p>'They want us to explore these stories, including those that are sensitive or controversial, provided they are authentic to the specific place, based on sound historical research and that we help them to explore and draw conclusions for themselves.'</p>

<p>Chartwell, Kent</p>

<p>Chartwell's land has history dating back to the 14th century and it is thought to have been built on as early as the 16th century, with Historic England noting that some of the Tudor brickwork is still visible on external walls. </p>

<p>Chartwell, now a Grade I listed building, became the family home of Sir Winston Churchill in 1922.</p>

<p>The report draws on his leadership during the Bengal Famine of 1943, his 'exceptionally long, complex and controversial life' and his position as Secretary of State for the Colonies (1921-1922) as the reason for its inclusion on the list.</p>

<p>They also note the fact he opposed the independence of India.</p>

<p>Bateman's, East Sussex</p>

<p>The National Trust lists the home of Rudyard Kipling because 'the British Empire was a central theme and context of his literary output'.</p>

<p>Allan Bank, Cumbria </p>

<p>Allan Bank is a Grade II listed building in Grasmere that was once the home to Romantic poet William Wordsworth from 1808 to 1811.</p>

<p>Blickling Hall, Norfolk</p>

<p>Blickling Hall is a stately home built in 1616 and was inherited by William Schomberg Robert Kerr, 8th Marquess of Lothian in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Kerr's grandfather was Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 2nd Earl Talbot of Hensol.</p>

<p>As an executor and trustee of two plantations in Jamaica, Charles received £4,660 for 543 enslaved people.</p>

<p>During the Second World War, the house was requisitioned and served as the Officers' Mess of nearby RAF Oulton.</p>

<p>It came under the guardianship of the National Trust in 1940. </p>

<p>Felbrigg Hall, Norfolk</p>

<p>This property was owned by William Windham III (1750 - 1810), a long-serving MP and contemporary of the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce.</p>

<p>According to the report, Windham was one of only 16 MPs to vote against the Abolition Bill in 1807 and, as Secretary for War and the Colonies in 1806, he believed abolition would result in Britain's economic ruin.</p>

<p>The house itself was built by Jacob Houblon III in 1757 and the report states it is closely linked to the story of West Indies trade in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The interior and exterior are embossed with shells from the Caribbean, West Africa and the Indo-Pacific. Cowrie shells are associated with the transatlantic slave trade, according to the National Trust. </p>

<p> Ickworth, Suffolk</p>

<p>Trust experts say Ickworth was owned by Admiral Augustus John Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol whose family had strong links to the slave trade.</p>

<p>Jonathan Peckover was a tradesman and managed the Wisbech and Lincolnshire Bank in a banking hall adjoining the house.</p>

<p>The National Trust's report states that the Peckovers were Quakers, many of whom believed that all people are created equal in the eyes of God and campaigned for the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>The Peckover family were among the founders of the Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum whose collection includes the campaigning chest of slavery artefacts and African goods.</p>

<p>Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Chicheley of Wimpole Hall was married to Sarah Russell - the daughter of a politician and director of the East India Company.</p>

<p>The hall was later inherited by Henrietta Cavendish Holles who married into the Harley family in 1713.</p>

<p>Robert Harley, who, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, established the South Sea Company in 1711 and was connected to plantations in Barbados, Antigua and Surinam, according to the National Trust.</p>

<p>Henrietta's daughter married William Bentinck, whose father was a plantation owner.</p>

<p>The Trust go on to say that in 1740, Wimpole was purchased by Philip Yorke who, as Attorney General, stated that runaway enslaved people coming to Great Britain or Ireland from the West Indies were not free.</p>

<p>This gave slavers the legal right to enforce their return to the plantations. </p>

<p>Ankerwycke, Surrey</p>

<p>The Trust's report details how the Ankerwycke Estate was purchased in the early nineteenth century by John Blagrove the Younger, a plantation owner. </p>

<p>Bodiam Castle, East Sussex</p>

<p>This castle was built in the 14th century to help defend the area from the French during the Hundred Years' War.</p>

<p>After it came under the ownership of Lord Thanet in the 17th century, it was sold to Parliament to help pay fines and subsequently fell into ruin.</p>

<p>The Trust says the castle, now a Grade I listed building, was saved from destruction by John Fuller who bought the castle in 1828.</p>

<p>The report states: 'Fuller inherited an estate near Bodiam and a plantation in Jamaica, including enslaved people, from his uncle, Rose Fuller MP.</p>

<p>Carlyle's House, Greater London</p>

<p>A typical Georgian terraced house in Chelsea, Carlyle's House was the home of author, biographer and historian Thomas Carlyle.</p>

<p>The report notes Carlyle's essay, published in Fraser's Magazine in 1849, which advocated for the reintroduction of slavery to the West Indies.</p>

<p>It also states that in his work Shooting Niagara: And After? (1867), 'Carlyle encouraged historic perceptions of racial hierarchies and promoted the idea that Africans were born for servitude'.</p>

<p>After Harry’s death, his son, John Grey, was considered the rightful heir to the Stamford title and a seat in the House of Lords under Dutch law in South Africa, but not English law, as he had been born outside of marriage.</p>

<p>The seat was granted to Grey’s nephew, William Grey (1850– 1910), who became the 9th Earl of Stamford.</p>

<p>Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal, North Yorkshire</p>

<p>This abbey, one of the largest and best preserved ruined monasteries in England, was built in 1132 and was pillaged under the rule of Henry VIII in 1539.</p>

<p>The abbey is situated in Studley Royal Park and is included in the list because John Aislabie of Studley Royal supported the South Sea Company’s proposition to take over the national debt in exchange for government bonds.</p>

<p>The report notes that, having received a £20,000 bribe in company stock in exchange for promoting the scheme, Aislabie negotiated the South Sea contract and got the bill passed in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>It adds: 'He was serving as British Chancellor of the Exchequer when the South Sea Company collapsed in 1720.</p>

<p>'Aislabie was forced to resign the following year, shortly before a report into the collapse was published. He was found guilty of corruption, expelled from the House of Commons and imprisoned in the Tower of London.'</p>

<p>The Hibberts were prominent defenders of slavery during the abolition campaign.</p>

<p>Nostell, West Yorkshire</p>

<p>The National Trust report states that the Winn family acquired the Nostell Estate in the mid-seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Archival records suggest that Sir Rowland Winn, 4th Baronet, invested in both the South Sea Company and the East India Company. </p>

<p>The cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale supplied much of the furniture and furnishings at Nostell.</p>

<p>The report notes that the Thomas Chippendale Account entry from 20 January 1770 in the West Yorkshire archive includes ‘2 Blankets for the housekeepers &amp; the blacks bed’, at a cost of £1 3s. 0d.</p>

<p>Nunnington Hall, North Yorkshire</p>

<p>According to the National Trust report, Nunnington Hall was purchased in 1839 by William Rutson.</p>

<p>William was the main beneficiary of his father’s will, and his personal wealth can be directly connected to his father’s business activities.</p>

<p>The family of William’s wife, Charlotte Mary Ewart, were linked through business to the Rutsons.</p>

<p>Rutson’s grandfather, who was also called William Rutson, was a cotton merchant and slave-trader who operated from Liverpool as a partner in the firm Backhouse and Rutson, described as ‘African traders’.</p>

<p>Between 1780 and 1793, William the Elder was involved in financing, or part-financing, at least 42 voyages transporting enslaved Africans.</p>

<p>Quarry Bank Mill, Cheshire</p>

<p>Quarry Bank Mill has been included by the National Trust because Samuel Greg built the mill in 1783.</p>

<p>It notes that although 'Greg did not rely directly on his Caribbean estate earnings to enter the cotton trade, his wealth was partly due to the wider family engagement in businesses related to slavery through several generations'.</p>

<p>His uncle, John Greg, had been the first Government Commissioner for the sale of land in the West Indies.</p>

<p>Rufford Old Hall, Lancashire</p>

<p>The Trust's report states that Rufford Old Hall is linked by marriage to the early colonisation of North America through Lucy Rigby, who married Robert Hesketh of Rufford in 1641.</p>

<p>In 1643, Lucy’s father, Colonel Alexander Rigby, purchased the ‘plough patent’, which gave him control of the independent province of Lygonia in New England, an area in the southern part of presentday Maine.</p>

<p>Lygonia was one of eight patents for new provinces created by the Plymouth Council, designed to encourage English settlement and develop local farming and forestry economies.</p>

<p>Seaton Delaval Hall, Northumberland</p>

<p>Seaton Delaval Hall has been identified on the Trust's list because of the Delaval family's links to colonialism.</p>

<p>Speke Hall, Merseyside </p>

<p>This Grade I listed building was constructed by Sir William Norris who was MP for Liverpool (1695–1701) and concerned with protecting the city’s tobacco and sugar interests, according to the National Trust.</p>

<p>In 1696, he audited the East India Company accounts, and in 1698, chaired the Parliamentary Africa Select Committee. </p>

<p>Another of William’s brothers, Richard Norris, traded tobacco from Virginia and sugar from the West Indian plantations that enslaved Africans.</p>

<p>Barrington Court, Somerset</p>

<p>The National Trust say they acquired Barrington Court in 1907, in a derelict condition.</p>

<p>From 1920, Barrington was leased and restored by Colonel Abram Arthur Lyle, using architectural salvage collected from other houses.</p>

<p>Lyle was the grandson of the founder of Abram Lyle &amp; Sons, a sugar-producing company of which the colonel became director, and which merged to form Tate &amp; Lyle in 1921.</p>

<p>Both businesses were established after the abolition of slavery. The early nineteenth and early twentieth century British sugar industry was predominantly supplied by Caribbean plantations, founded under colonialism and supported by enslaved labour.</p>

<p>Bath Assembly Rooms, Somerset</p>

<p>Bath and its ‘New’ or ‘Upper’ Assembly Rooms were connected to wider colonial and slavery economies of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The Assembly Rooms were designed by John Wood the Younger and opened in 1771.</p>

<p>They were funded by a tontine subscription, a form of group life-annuity investment in which survivors benefit from the deaths of other participants.</p>

<p>James Leigh–Perrot, one such founding investor, was the maternal uncle of the author Jane Austen.</p>

<p>In 1764, he married Jane Cholmeley, who was born in Barbados to Robert Cholmeley and latterly the sister-in-law of the Barbados Governor William Spry.</p>

<p>The couple lived part of the year in Bath, and it is believed Jane LeighPerrot was heiress to her father’s plantations. Executors for her mother, Ann Workman (d.1790), sold a plantation in 1791.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Grenville (1542–91), an MP and naval commander, converted the monastic buildings around 1576.</p>

<p>As Sheriff of Cork, Ireland, he transplanted over 100 English settlers.</p>

<p>It is likely he invested in Sir Humphrey Gilbert’s ‘New World’ expeditions of 1578 and 1583.</p>

<p>In 1585, Grenville sailed colonists to establish Roanoke (now North Carolina), ordered the destruction of the Native American Aquascogoc village as punishment for a missing silver cup, and transported to Bideford a Native American, who was baptised in 1588 as ‘Raleigh a Wynganditoian’ and died a year later.</p>

<p>Drake’s kinsman, John Hawkins, initiated the English triangular slave trade route from 1562, and Drake sailed on his ships.</p>

<p>In 1572, Drake met Diego, an escaped enslaved African, when attacking the Spanish town of Nombre de Dios in present-day Panama. </p>

<p>Castle Drogo, Devon</p>

<p>Compton Castle and Greenway, Devon</p>

<p>The Gilbert family owned both Compton Castle and Greenway since the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Sir Humphrey Gilbert, MP, soldier, explorer and half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh, fought in Ireland and attempted to establish a colony.</p>

<p>In 1578, he received letters patent to seek out new lands in the Americas, which led to an unsuccessful voyage the same year.</p>

<p>In 1583, he sailed to Newfoundland and claimed the first ‘New World’ territory for England since John Cabot in 1497.</p>

<p>Gilbert died returning from the expedition when his ship Squirrel sank near the Azores.</p>

<p>They go on to note that he sat on successive influential colonial groups, including the Committee for Trade and Plantations, the Council of Trade, the Council for Foreign Plantations and the Board of Trade.</p>

<p>He was also a member of various companies, including the Providence Company and the Company for Propagation of the Gospel in New England.</p>

<p>Lundy, Devon</p>

<p>Thomas Benson was Sheriff of Devon and the MP for Barnstaple, as well as a smuggler and practitioner of piracy.</p>

<p>The National Trust says that in 1747, he gained a contract to ship convicts to Virginia and Maryland, but instead shipped them to Lundy, where he employed them as slave labour.</p>

<p>In the subsequent court case, Benson argued that transporting the convicts to Lundy was no different from transporting them to the Americas, and his interpretation of the law was upheld.</p>

<p>Newark Park, Gloucestershire</p>

<p>According to the National Trust, Sir Thomas Lowe purchased Newark Park in 1593.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas was a cloth merchant, MP, Mayor of London, Master of the Haberdashers’ Company and Governor of both the Merchant Adventurers [of London] and the Levant Company.</p>

<p>His maiden speech as an MP in 1607 petitioned on behalf of Mediterranean and West Indies merchants.</p>

<p>In 1769, James Clutterbuck bought Newark Park.</p>

<p>A mercer and banker from London, he left Newark Park to his godson, Rev. Lewis Clutterbuck.</p>

<p>Rev. Clutterbuck’s son, Lewis II, married the daughter of William Balfour of Martha Brae, Trelawney, Jamaica.</p>

<p>In the compensation records, Sarah Clutterbuck was awarded £290 11s. 9d. for 12 enslaved people in St James, Jamaica, in 1836, and made an unsuccessful claim of £2,169 4s. 2d. for 98 enslaved people from the Retirement Estate, St Ann, Jamaica, in 1839.</p>

<p>Saltram, Devon</p>

<p>According to the National Trust, James Bagg MP, a merchant and Mayor of Plymouth in Devon, purchased Saltram around 1614.</p>

<p>The report notes that 'he invested in the Virginia Company of Plymouth (established in 1606) and its successor, the Plymouth Council for New England (established in 1620), along with his son and heir, Sir James Bagg MP, a merchant and Deputy-Mayor of Plymouth'.</p>

<p>In 1632, Sir James was elected to the Plymouth Council for New England. Both father and son were Comptrollers of Customs in Plymouth and Fowey, Cornwall.</p>

<p>Sherborne Park Estate, Gloucestershire</p>

<p>This historic estate has been included on the list because owner John Dutton, who inherited the Sherborne Park Estate in 1820, was an executor for the estate of Sir Rose Price, who had married his cousin, Elizabeth Lambert (1782–1826).</p>

<p>As co-executor, Lord Sherborne administered compensation of £3,579 3s. 2d. for 464 enslaved people at the Worthy Park Estate, St John, Jamaica, in 1836, but is unlikely to have personally benefited.</p>

<p>Shute Barton, Devon</p>

<p>The Trust notes that Sir William Templer Pole inherited from his father both Shute Barton (a partially demolished fourteenth-century house) and the newly-built New Shute House (which is not owned by the National Trust).</p>

<p>It states: 'In 1835, he received compensation from two estates, jointly inherited with kinsman Henry Coombe Compton from their great-grandfather, John Mills of Woodford Bridge, Essex.</p>

<p>'The awards were £2,512 8s. 0d. for 170 enslaved people at the Mills plantation and £2,784 8s. 4d. for 170 enslaved people at the Golden Rock plantation, both St Kitts.'</p>

<p>Snowshill Manor, Gloucestershire </p>

<p>Estate owner Abraham Solomon Wade of St Martin married Frances Paget of St Kitts.</p>

<p>Frances received compensation of £145 4s. 7d. for nine enslaved people in 1835.</p>

<p>Their son, Solomon Abraham Wade, was a merchant, agent and, latterly, plantation owner on St Kitts, receiving compensation in 1835 of £29 17s. 4d. for two enslaved people and shared £109 19s. 0d. for seven enslaved people.</p>

<p>Stourhead, Wiltshire</p>

<p>The National Trust report states that Henry Hoare bought the Stourhead Estate by 1717 and between 1720 and 1725 demolished the earlier house for a new design by the architect Colen Campbell.</p>

<p>In 1719 Hoare inherited his father’s bank which, during the period of the South Sea Bubble (February to September 1720), earned him a profit of £21,000 (about £1.6 million in 2020).</p>

<p>The Bank’s commercial success was achieved by 'riding the bubble', through buying South Sea Company stock when it fell in price and selling it when it had a large rise.</p>

<p>Trengwainton Garden, Cornwall</p>

<p>Sir Rose Price, 1st Baronet purchased Trengwainton in 1814 and set about rebuilding the house and laying out gardens.</p>

<p>Price was descended from an established Cornish-Jamaican plantation-owning family who acquired 840 acres of land called Worthy Park in St John, Jamaica, in 1670.</p>

<p>Sir Rose Price owned or controlled multiple Jamaican plantations.</p>

<p>Following his death in 1834, his executors handled compensation claims from his estate, including £3,579 3s. 2d. for 464 enslaved people at Worthy Park in 1836, with a second successful claim at Worthy Park for £5,860 9s. 11d. in 1838, and another claim for £1,662 0s. 5d. for 79 enslaved people at Spring Garden, St Dorothy. Trengwainton was sold by mortgage holders in 1835.</p>

<p>Tyntesfield, Somerset</p>

<p>According to the National Trust, William Gibbs, known as ‘the richest commoner in England’, purchased the Georgian house and estate at Tyntesfield in 1844.</p>

<p>It states: 'His great wealth, which enabled the complete remodelling of Tyntesfield from 1863, was accrued by his company Anthony Gibbs &amp; Sons, which had held a monopoly for importing Peruvian bird-guano fertiliser.</p>

<p>'A. Gibbs &amp; Sons’ guano business operated from 1842 to 1861 and, with pressure from external observers, workers’ conditions improved through increased pay and access to basic medical care.</p>

<p>'Yet most extraction was performed by indentured and often coerced Chinese laborers, working in slavery like conditions, alongside convicts, conscripts and army deserters, and, before the abolition of Peruvian slavery in 1854, enslaved people.</p>

<p>'In his youth, Gibbs was briefly employed by his uncle, George Gibbs (1753–1818) of the West Indian trading house which became Gibbs, Bright, and Co. This company later merged with A. Gibbs &amp; Sons in 1881, and in 1887 the unprofitable WestIndies trading Bristol office was shut.'</p>

<p>Chirk Castle, Wrexham</p>

<p>Chirk Castle was built from 1295 for Roger Mortimer and 'some 300 years later, it was purchased by Sir Thomas Myddelton I' whom the Trust say was 'a prominent figure in late-sixteenth-century sugar trading, in investment in privateering activities, and in the East India Company'.</p>

<p>Myddelton was apprenticed to the London grocer Fernandino Poyntz, became a sugar trader in Antwerp around 1583, and later acquired a sugar refinery in Mincing Lane, London. </p>

<p>Erddig, Wrexham</p>

<p>The Yorkes inherited Erddig from John Meller, who was a lawyer and Master of the High Court of Chancery.</p>

<p>The National Trust state that Meller bought Erddig in 1714, becoming sole owner in 1716.</p>

<p>It adds: 'The house was built by Joshua Edisbury. One of Edisbury’s benefactors, Elihu Yale, made his fortune with the East India Company as Governor of Fort St. George, Madras (now Chennai).</p>

<p>'Yale supported the establishment of Yale University, whose collection includes a painting of Yale with Lord James Cavendish, who married his daughter, and a black pageboy or servant wearing a collar.'</p>

<p>The Trust notes that Erddig’s income also came from the leasing of mineral rights to ironworks, including those at Bersham. There were links between the ironworking industry and the slave trade, although there are no confirmed connections with Erddig.</p>

<p>Paxton’s Tower, Carmarthenshire</p>

<p>Paxton’s Tower is a banqueting house formerly within the landscape of Middleton Hall (which is not owned by the National Trust).</p>

<p>The Trust states that in about 1789, the estate was purchased by William Paxton.</p>

<p>During the early 1770s, Paxton held the post of Assay Master of Fort William, Bengal, and in 1778 he was appointed Master of the Calcutta Mint.</p>

<p>He later became an East India Company agent and banker. Between 1793 and 1795, Paxton commissioned the architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell to design a Palladian mansion at Middleton, including the banqueting house.</p>

<p>As a Carmarthenshire MP, Paxton also invested in the local area, developing Tenby as a bathing resort and providing a piped-water supply to Carmarthen.</p>

<p>In 1824, Middleton was bought by Edward Hamlin Adams, who was born in Jamaica and possibly descended from the Adams family of Barbados.</p>

<p>He was a trustee in the Charlottenburg Estate and joint owner of a plantation at Port Royal, Jamaica, which documented 18 enslaved people in 1823.</p>

<p>The Trust state that between 1817 and 1829, Adams, Robertson and Co. supplied a number of enslaved men to foot regiments as ‘pioneers’.</p>

<p>Penrhyn Castle, Caernarfonshire</p>

<p>Gifford Pennant was a soldier serving in Jamaica around 1655, who later settled and established sugar plantations in Clarendon.</p>

<p>His son Edward extended the estates and became Chief Justice of Jamaica.</p>

<p>The report states that the next generation of the Pennant family departed Jamaica: Samuel became a partner in Drake, Pennant and Long West India Merchants, and Lord Mayor of London in 1749; and John became a successful Liverpool merchant.</p>

<p>John’s son, Richard, 1st Baron Penrhyn, married Anne Susannah Warburton in 1765, re-uniting the Penrhyn Estate.</p>

<p>Richard was a Liverpool MP and a vigorous defender of the slave trade. </p>

<p>Powis Castle, Powys</p>

<p>Powis Castle became associated with the Clive family following the marriage of Edward Clive, 2nd Baron Clive of Plassey, later 1st Earl of Powis, to Lady Henrietta Herbert.</p>

<p>Edward Clive became Governor of Madras (now Chennai) in 1798.</p>

<p>He was the son of Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive of Plassey, the first British Governor of Bengal and a major figure in the East India Company.</p>

<p>Robert amassed vast fortunes derived from his activities in India, both in cash and in fine and decorative arts.</p>

<p>Tredegar House, Monmouthshire</p>

<p>According to the National Trust, Tredegar House is a Restoration house, built around an earlier Tudor house during the 1660 and 1670s, and the home of the Morgan family.</p>

<p>The Morgan family, the report notes,  owned shares in the Royal African Company, the mercantile company set up by City of London merchants in 1660, to trade along the west coast of Africa, led by James, Duke of York, the brother of Charles II.</p>

<p>Between 1674 and 1685, the Morgans commissioned a ship, the Tredegar of Newport, which traded with Barbados in 1676 and returned to Bristol with cargoes of sugar for Bristol merchants.</p>

<p>The report states: 'It is precisely at this period that Tredegar House was completed, very probably supported by lucrative trade with the West Indies, although further research is needed.'</p>
