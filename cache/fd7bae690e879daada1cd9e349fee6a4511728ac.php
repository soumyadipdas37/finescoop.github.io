<p>On the mend: Neil Patrick Harris, 47, revealed Tuesday on Today that he and his husband David Burtka, 45, and their nine-year-old twins Gideon and Harper all contracted COVID-19 this year; shown in 2016</p>

<p>'It happened very early [in the pandemic], like late March, early April,' he explained. 'We were doing our best before, and I thought I had the flu, and I didn't want to be paranoid about it. And then I lost my sense of taste and smell, which was a big indicator, so we holed up.'</p>

<p>Although a loss of the sense of taste or smell wasn't initially believed to be a symptom of COVID-19, the CDC later added the sudden loss to its list of potential symptoms after many people reported it early in their illnesses.</p>

<p>From his vantage point months later, Harris sounded grateful that his family had recovered fully from the virus.</p>

<p>'It was not pleasant, but we got through it,' he added.</p>

<p>Months ago: 'It happened very early [in the pandemic], like late March, early April,' he explained. The How I Met Your Mother star said the first sign was a loss of taste and smell; shown in 2017</p>

<p>Temporary immunity: 'It was not pleasant, but we got through it,' he said, adding that the family now had antibodies to the novel coronavirus</p>

<p>Harris and his family have since gained a certain amount of protection from the coronavirus, as they all developed antibodies during their illnesses.</p>

<p>However, the science on immunity from COVID-19 is rapidly developing, and some people who initially developed antibodies after contracting the illness later lost them, presumably leaving them with no extra defenses.</p>

<p>'We want to make sure everyone's doing their best to slow this down every way possible, for sure,' the Doogie Howser star added.</p>

<p>Harris and Burtka welcomed their twins in 2010, and the couple tied the knot in 2014 after getting engaged years earlier.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Harris and his family were spotted boating and spending time with friends in the Hamptons.</p>

<p>They wore masks during part of the gathering but removed them while chatting with friends aboard a boat. </p>

<p>Last week, Variety reported that a female-led reboot of Harris' old TV series Doogie Howser, M.D. had been picked up by the Disney+ streaming service.</p>

<p>The new and updated version, titled Doogie Kameāloha, M.D., will focus on Lahela 'Doogie' Howser, a mixed race 16-year who works as a doctor in Hawaii.</p>

<p>The lead actress hasn't been announced yet, but the 10-episode season will be written and executive produced by Kourtney Kang, who's best known for launching Fresh Off The Boat and working on all nine seasons of How I Met Your Mother, which also starred Harris.</p>
