<p>A hand-held video game player that does not run on batteries is a scientific innovation, along with a parent's worst nightmare. Scientists have developed a device that looks similar to the iconic Nintendo Game Boy console that harvests energy from the sun and user</p>

<p>The system was developed by researchers at Northwestern University and Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Northwestern's Josiah Hester, who co-led the research, said: 'It's the first battery-free interactive device that harvests energy from user actions.'</p>

<p>'When you press a button, the device converts that energy into something that powers your gaming.'</p>

<p>The gaming console is equivalent to the size and form of a Game Boy, but is designed with a set of solar panels around the screen to harvest energy from the sun.</p>

<p>Boy console that harvests energy from the sun and user. The player is designed with a capacitor, which is two medal plates inside that can be recharged 'millions of millions of times.' The team developed a way to extract small amounts of energy from the sun and button presses that are held in the two medal plates</p>

<p>And a second source of power is generated from users pressing buttons on the front of the device.</p>

<p>Delft's Przemyslaw Pawelczak, who co-led the research with Hester, said: 'Sustainable gaming will become a reality, and we made a major step in that direction — by getting rid of the battery completely.'</p>

<p>'With our platform, we want to make a statement that it is possible to make a sustainable gaming system that brings fun and joy to the user.'</p>

<p>The team explains that the gaming console switches between pulling power from the sun and the user's activities, but at times will experience loss of power.</p>

<p>However, they implemented a system that allows energy to be stored when the device is not in use.</p>

<p>This eliminates the need to press 'save' as seen in traditional platforms, as the player can now continue gameplay from the exact point of the device fully losing power — even if Mario is in mid-jump.</p>

<p>According to a team, on a not so cloudy day the device can be powered with a moderate amount of clicks, but will have anywhere from less than one second of interruption for every 10 seconds of gameplay.  </p>

<p>There is also a system in place that allows the console to store energy while it is not in use - but researchers say there are times gameplay losses power</p>

<p>Along with eliminating the need to spend money on batteries, researches hope this system will pave the way for environmentally friendly technologies.</p>

<p>'Our work is the antithesis of the Internet of Things, which has many devices with batteries in them,' Hester said. </p>

<p>'Those batteries eventually end up in the garbage. If they aren't fully discharged, they can become hazardous.'</p>

<p>'They are hard to recycle. We want to build devices that are more sustainable and can last for decades.'</p>
