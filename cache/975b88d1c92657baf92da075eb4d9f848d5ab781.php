<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former England defender Alex Scott believes the WSL can 'hand on heart' claim to be the best league in the world following a string of high-profile signings.</p>

<p>Five of the United States' World Cup winners joined the league during a hectic transfer window, while England stars Lucy Bronze and Alex Greenwood returned home from European champions Lyon to sign for Manchester City.</p>

<p>Alex Morgan's blockbuster switch to Tottenham last weekend gained global attention as she followed fellow USA internationals Sam Mewis, Rose Lavelle, Tobin Heath and Christen Press in moving to England.</p>

<p>Former England international Alex Scott believes the WSL is the best league in the world</p>

<p>Alex Morgan is one of a number of the World Cup winning USA squad to join the league</p>

<p>Meanwhile, champions Chelsea paid a club-record fee to recruit Denmark forward Pernille Harder from Wolfsburg.</p>

<p>Ex-Arsenal defender Scott, who retired from football two years ago, feels the influx of talent is a mouthwatering prospect and signifies a major milestone for a competition which launched a decade ago.</p>

<p>'I love it. It's so exciting. I think when the WSL started, it always had the ambition to want to go on to be the best league in the world,' said Scott.</p>

<p>'What we are seeing now, we've got Euro medallists, World Cup winners, we've got our homegrown stars like Lucy Bronze, Alex Greenwood coming back, and that's what you want.</p>

<p>'As a top player, you want to be playing week in, week out with the best players and against the best players.</p>

<p>Chelsea paid a club-record fee to recruit Denmark forward Pernille Harder from Wolfsburg</p>

<p>'It shows the development and everything the FA have done to make sure the women's game over here is at a stage where we can hand on heart say we are the best league, because we really are.</p>

<p>'All the best players want to come and play over here now. It's such an exciting prospect to be a part of right now in this country.'</p>

<p>Women's football has received a further boost after the Football Association announced a three-year deal for the Women's FA Cup to be sponsored by health and life insurance company Vitality.</p>

<p>The competition will be known as the Vitality Women's FA Cup from the quarter-finals of the 2019-20 tournament, which are due to be played later this month, until July 2023.</p>

<p>Scott, a Vitality ambassador, has a strong connection to the FA Cup, winning it seven times with the Gunners, most recently in 2016.</p>

<p>Lucy Bronze and Alex Greenwood have returned from abroad to join Manchester City</p>

<p>Kelly Simmons, the FA's director of the women's professional game, described the investment as 'significant', without going into specific financial details.</p>

<p>Given the uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic and current fan restrictions, she believes the deal illustrates the growing power of women's football.</p>

<p>'At the moment, sports sponsorship would be a difficult space to try and get new partners in because nobody knows the true impact yet of Covid,' said Simmons.</p>

<p>'This just demonstrates - even more so than usual really - where women's football is at in this country, that it can bring a big brand in like Vitality, investing significantly in this climate.</p>

<p>'It's on a big growth trajectory and every aspect of it is growing rapidly. It's really exciting.'</p>
