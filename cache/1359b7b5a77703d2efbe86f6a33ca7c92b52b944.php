<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The distraught parents of a young Chinese woman who was murdered by her roommate screamed in court upon hearing her killer could be free after spending 13 years behind bars.</p>

<p>Shuo Dong was just 19-years-old when he murdered Qi Yu, 28, on June 8 in 2018 at their apartment in Campsie in Sydney's inner south-west.</p>

<p>Six weeks later Ms Yu's half naked body was found in bushland near the M1 Motorway in Mount Kuring-gai with a business shirt tied around her neck.</p>

<p>Dong, who had only lived with Ms Yu for three weeks, was sentenced to 18 years in jail with a non-parole period of 13 years and six months on Friday after pleading guilty to murder.</p>

<p>Qi Yu, 28, (pictured) was murdered on June 8 in 2018 and her body was found six weeks later in bushland in Mount Ku-ring-gai</p>

<p>Upon hearing Dong's sentencing, Ms Yu's mother Qin He and father Zhihe Yu, who had travelled to Australia from China for the sentencing, cried out in pain, The Daily Telegraph reported. </p>

<p>'Qi Yu Was found without pants on her body, why? What terrible thing has the offender done to our innocent daughter?' Ms Yu's parents said.</p>

<p>Mr Yu said their daughter's brutal murder had left his wife wanting to end her own life to 'follow our daughter' </p>

<p>'She washes her face with tears every day, and wakes up in nightmares almost every day,' he shouted in the courtroom.  </p>

<p>Outside the court, Ms Yu's parents said it was 'unfair' Dong had pleaded guilty because he was automatically given a 25 per cent discount on his sentence, the ABC reported.</p>

<p>'It doesn't make any sense at all,' Mr Yu said.</p>

<p>'He pleaded guilty to reduce the sentence. He used the law to escape from prison, he doesn't regret what he's done.'</p>

<p>Dong had Googled the punishment for murder in Australia just two days before Ms Yu died. </p>

<p>Acting Justice Peter Hidden said he believed the murder was 'premeditated'.</p>

<p>'I am not persuaded that he is remorseful,' he said.</p>

<p>Ms Yu had lived in Sydney since 2009 and had studied electrical engineering.</p>

<p>Shuo Dong will spend at least 13 years behind bars after pleading guilty to Ms Yu's murder and dumping her half naked body in bushland in Sydney's north</p>

<p>She told her mother the lights in her house had mysteriously gone out in the last message sent to her on Chinese social media app WeChat on the night she disappeared.</p>

<p>'OMG. We're having a power outage ... something is not right, only our household is having a power outage,' Ms Yu wrote, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.</p>

<p>Blood-stained underwear was allegedly found in Ms Yu's bedroom as police allege Dong tried to bite off his own fingernails to destroy any DNA.</p>

<p>Large amounts of blood were also found in Ms Yu's car which Dong had driven before searching on Google Maps for a way home to Campsie. </p>

<p>Forensic pathologists were unable to determine the cause of her death due to her body's decomposition but found Dong's DNA on the shirt around her neck.</p>

<p>Dong had been sacked from his job at a construction site and is taking antipsychotic medication while in jail.</p>

<p>He told a psychiatrist he felt 'very guilty and ashamed'.</p>

<p>Justice Hidden said he accepted the now 21-year-old had likely suffered schizophrenia but the murder was not the product of a 'psychotic episode'.</p>

<p>Dong said in November he had had a sexual relationship with Ms Yu but investigators dismissed this idea.</p>

<p>Before pleading guilty, Dong told detectives he had been with his girlfriend on the night of the murder.</p>

<p>While in custody, Dong used a shiv to stab another inmate in January and said he was hearing voices while behind bars.</p>

<p>He refused to explain the reasons behind killing Ms Yu or how the murder was carried out, angering her traumatised parents. </p>

<p>His prospect of rehabilitation was deemed 'uncertain' by Justice Hidden and Dong will be eligible for parole in December 2031 having already served time in jail. </p>
