<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They appeared to be taking steps to fix their damaged friendship during last week's episodes of The Only Way Is Essex after months of not speaking.</p>

<p>Yet tensions are still awry between Chloe Sims and her best friend Pete Wicks during the upcoming episode of the show, as they hash out their differences over drinks.</p>

<p>Chloe, 37, reveals she feels 'confused' because Pete, 31, failed to contact her and reach out after they met up for a night out to try and begin fixing their relationship.</p>

<p>Awks! Tensions are still awry between Chloe Sims and her best friend Pete Wicks during the upcoming episode of the show, as they hash out their differences over drinks</p>

<p>It is unclear why the pair fell out in the first place, however Chloe previously explained that she felt Pete would 'dismiss' some of her emotions and opinions.</p>

<p>While meeting for a drinking Pete says to Chloe: 'Nice to see ya.'</p>

<p>Without conviction, Chloe replies: 'Yeah so nice', and Pete sarcastically tells her that she 'looks happy', as they sit opposite one another in a bar. </p>

<p>Chloe says: 'I'm happy', and Pete quips back: 'Try and tell your face you're having a good time. No? Not quite there yet.'</p>

<p>Confused: Chloe, 37, reveals she feels confused as Pete, 31, failed to contact her and reach out after they met up for a night out to try and begin fixing their relationship</p>

<p>Revealing how she feels, Chloe says: 'I don't know what you want from me. One minute you're in the forest with Peggy with tears in your eyes saying how much you miss me and all this s**t.</p>

<p>'Then we have a really fun time and everything felt normal and you said yourself it felt like we hadn't been apart, and then nothing.'</p>

<p>Pete says: 'Well I don't know what you want me to say about it.'</p>

<p>What's going on? Chloe, 37, reveals she feels 'confused' because Pete, 31, failed to contact her and reach out after they met up for a night out to try and begin fixing their relationship</p>

<p>Explaining how it affects her, she adds: 'I find it really confusing, one of the main reasons I stopped talking to you before was because I couldn't work you out.'</p>

<p>While Pete simply says: 'Ok.'</p>

<p>Clearly frustrated, Chloe says: 'That's what you do, you say okay and I'm still none the wiser in no man's land. It's annoying and I'm sick of it.' </p>

<p>Tricky: It is unclear why the pair fell out in the first place, however Chloe previously explained that she felt Pete would 'dismiss' some of her emotions and opinions</p>

<p>Pete and Chloe previously appeared to be fixing their broken relationship after bumping into each other in the park and admitting they had missed each other's friendship.  </p>

<p>They later decided to meet up for a drink where they said it felt good to be getting back to a place of normality between them.</p>

<p>However Pete's apparent lack of effort could prove a stumbling block between them on the road to recovery. </p>

<p>On the mend? Pete and Chloe previously appeared to be fixing their broken relationship after bumping into each other in the park and admitting they had missed each other's friendship</p>
