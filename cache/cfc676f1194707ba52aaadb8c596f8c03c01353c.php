<p>The Blues boss became embroiled in an expletive war of words with the Liverpool backroom staff when his side visited Anfield on the day Liverpool lifted the Premier League title.</p>

<p>Lampard's side were trailing in the match when he felt that a soft free-kick had been given Liverpool's way and told Klopp's staff to 'have respect', sit down' and 'f*** off' while the Englishman also accused the group of being too arrogant after winning the league.</p>

<p>But the Chelsea head coach revealed on The High Performance Podcast that he is embarrassed about the incident and claims he was 'in the moment'. </p>

<p>Lampard said: ‘Yeah, I did regret that. And when that broke the next day a friend of mine sent it to me in the morning, I was a bit embarrassed by it. </p>

<p>‘I was in the moment, I felt we turned up and it was the easiest day for Liverpool ever. They won the league, they went goals up early in the game. </p>

<p>Lampard's side were trailing at Anfield at the time as the tensions reached boiling point</p>

<p>‘And a few things happened with the bench, I’m not going to go into detail, but my feeling was, I want to protect my club. And I didn’t have a problem with Liverpool celebrating. </p>

<p>‘Luckily enough, I’ve been there with Chelsea where we won the league quite early one year, and you can sit there and everything feels great. My feeling was, I want to be there where they are.’</p>

<p>Lampard admits he does not hate any ill-feeling towards Klopp in any way as the pair prepare to lock horns again in the second match of the 2020-21 season on September 20. </p>

<p>Lampard says he has nothing against Klopp and will 'put things right' next time they meet</p>

<p>The Chelsea coach also claimed he spoke to his daughters about his behaviour during the match in his attempts to 'practice what (he) preaches'.</p>

<p>He added: ‘ I definitely didn’t mean any disrespect to Jurgen Klopp, because I’ve got huge admiration for them. </p>

<p>‘It was an impulse reaction, which I will happily – when I do see him, I’ll put that one right. </p>

<p>Lampard and Klopp will lock horns again at Stamford Bridge on September 20</p>

<p>‘I care about my job, and it came out in the wrong way. And even I explained that to my daughters when I got home. And I’ll be brutally honest, it’s not the first time that they’ve heard it from me in the wrong moment. </p>

<p>‘So I do try and practice what I preach, but I suppose in adult life, it doesn’t always work that way. </p>

<p>‘But yeah, I was – and not just my own daughters, because you’ve got millions of Chelsea fans around the world, whether you’re young or old, it’s not the way I like to carry myself. </p>

<p>‘But in talking about high level sport, you can’t take passion out of the game. And it just came out of me in one little swoop there.’ </p>
