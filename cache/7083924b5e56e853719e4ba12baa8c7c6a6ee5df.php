<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A pilot of Britain's first-ever military aeroplane has survived a crash following a mock dogfight between British and German World War aircrafts.</p>

<p>The male flyer, who has not been identified, was inside a replica of the Royal Aircraft Factory BE2c when the accident happened this morning.</p>

<p>It is said to have spun out of control and hurtled nose down into Sywell aerodrome in Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>Incredibly he was found in 'good condition' by ambulance crews who rushed to the scene and one pal said he was expected to recover.</p>

<p>The plane - which was featured in film ‘Biggles Sweeps the Skies” - was restored by co-owners Matthew Boddington and Steve Slater.</p>

<p>It was part of the The Bremont Great War Display Team and leader Gordon Brander confirmed the pilot was fine.</p>

<p>He told MailOnline: 'He is actually in good condition. They say that he is going to be fine.</p>

<p>'We have no idea what happened. We are just waiting to speak to the police and the air authorities now.</p>

<p>Emergency crews were seen at the site this afternoon dealing with the aftermath of the crash</p>

<p>The aircraft involved in the crash was a Royal Aircraft Factory BE2c which is designed for two</p>

<p>'The aircraft was a Royal Aircraft Factory BE2c. It is a two seater but only one person was in it at the time.'</p>

<p>East Midlands Ambulance Service were called to the crash at 11.39am and said they had transferred an injured patient to hospital.</p>

<p>Another pilot told MailOnline: 'The whole airfield has been closed down.</p>

<p>'There were German biplanes and triplanes bearing the Iron Cross insignia battling it out with their British rivals when the British plane crashed.</p>

<p>Two of the planes before they took off for the display run-through in the skies earlier today</p>

<p>'Some of the planes are replicas, some are originals which have been lovingly restored.'</p>

<p>A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said: 'We were called about it at 11.50am and are working with other emergency services at the scene including Fire, EMAS and the Air Ambulance.</p>

<p>'One person (the pilot) is currently being treated at the scene for their injuries.' </p>

<p>A company called Air Leasing Ltd is also based at the aerodrome, which specialises in the maintenance and operation of World War II era fighters.</p>

<p>It is run by the mother and son team of Carolyn and Richard Grace.</p>

<p>An ambulance spokesperson said: 'The caller reported a light aircraft crash. We sent a paramedic in an ambulance car, a crewed ambulance and the air ambulance was also in attendance.</p>

<p>'We transported one patient to Coventry and Walsgrave Hospital via land ambulance.'</p>
