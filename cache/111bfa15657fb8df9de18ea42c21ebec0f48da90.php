<p>Reese may seem to have it all together under lockdown, but in March she candidly admitted that's not always the case.</p>

<p>The actress revealed how the family had been maintaining their boundaries while all working under the same roof.</p>

<p>'I definitely have good days and bad days,' she told Miley Cyrus on Bright Minded: Live With Miley.</p>

<p>'I think it's really important to designate space,' she continued. 'My husband and I are both working from home and all three kids are doing school online. So everybody has a room that has a little area and there's a privacy sign there, so when the privacy sign is on and your headphones are on, you can't interrupt.'</p>

<p>'You have to have rules on the wall for your family, just so we respect each other's space.' </p>

<p>Not always perfect: 'I definitely have good days and bad days,' she told Miley Cyrus on Bright Minded: Live With Miley back in March</p>
