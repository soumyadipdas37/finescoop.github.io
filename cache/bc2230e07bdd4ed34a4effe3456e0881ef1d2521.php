<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The daughter of a wealthy surgeon has claimed she was abused in her youth to prevent his widow from taking a chunk of her inheritance.</p>

<p>Tiffany Hribar alleges her father Dr David Hribar committed acts of emotional, verbal and physical abuse to her brother, mother and herself in her childhood in Adelaide.</p>

<p>Dr Hribar died in June, 2019, leaving Tiffany $750,000 in inheritance, while his wife Sally Hribar received an annual annuity of $50,000, the right to live in the family home in Norwood and $20,000 to pay mortgage on a home in Encounter Bay.</p>

<p>Sally is contesting Dr Hribar's will in the Supreme Court, with The Advertiser reporting she wants 'further provision' of the inheritance 'for her maintenance, education, and advancement in life'.</p>

<p>She claims Tiffany 'was estranged from the deceased for approximately the last 20 years of the deceased's life', which is disputed by the defence.</p>

<p>Tiffany Hribar has claimed she was abused by her surgeon father Dr David Hribar (pictured) in her childhood</p>

<p>Tiffany said the pair remained close and that 'any distance in the relationship between the deceased and (his daughter) was as a result of the inappropriate conduct of the deceased during his lifetime towards (his daughter)'. </p>

<p>Court documents state Tiffany left the family home for her own safety at age 14 in response to physical abuse from Dr Hribar, before moving in with friends. </p>

<p>She was not supported by her family at this time and could not afford to attend school, leading her to take up work as a cleaner.</p>

<p>When Tiffany qualified for Centrelink payments, the service noted she was not living in the family home in response to domestic violence.</p>

<p>Tiffany said despite their history she had remained close with her father and aided him on several matters including finalising his second divorce.</p>

<p>She believes she is entitled to keep her part of Dr Hribar's estate and that Sally's inheritance is fair. </p>

<p>Dr Hribar had lived with Sally since 2000 and the pair were married in 2017.</p>

<p>Dr Hribar's wife Sally is disputing his will in Adelaide Supreme Court (pictured), claiming Tiffany was estranged for the last 20 years of his life</p>

<p>In her partner's death notice, Sally wrote Dr Hribar would be 'forever in my heart'.  </p>

<p>'You were everything and everything was you,' the notice reads. 'Loving father and stepfather of Casey, Tracey, Simon and Tiffany.</p>

<p>'Loved and respected by so many people. Words cannot express how much I will miss you. You were my everything, my partner in life and my very best friend.' </p>

<p>Dr Hribar also left $200,000 to several other beneficiaries.</p>
