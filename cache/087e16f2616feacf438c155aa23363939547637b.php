<p>Not going anywhere! Speaking to Poland's Elle Man this month, Chris confirmed he won't be retiring his famous character after Thor: Love and Thunder, set for release in 2022 </p>

<p>Chris said he expected the film's script would be a huge hit with fans while speaking with the Philadelphia Inquirer in April this year. </p>

<p>'It's one of the best scripts I've read in years,' he told the publication. </p>

<p>'It's [director] Taika [Waititi] at his most extreme, and at his best. If the version I read is the one we get running with, it's going to be pretty insane.'  </p>

<p>The movie, the fourth in the action franchise, reunites Hemsworth with Tessa Thompson and Natalie Portman, and also features Christian Bale.       </p>

<p>Natalie will be playing The Mighty Thor in the highly anticipated Marvel Studios movie. </p>

<p>The Hollywood actor told the same publication he had wanted to dive into the 'stillness' for many years, which the pandemic has allowed him to.  </p>

<p>'Not to diminish by any means the challenges that are occurring, the absolute uncertainty, the anxiety that is happening in the world, but me personally, and to that question, it's (created) a forced sort of meditation and forced sort of stillness that I haven't been able to dive into like I've wanted to for many years,' he said. </p>
