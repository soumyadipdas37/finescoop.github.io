<p>In a preview clip from the episode, the 38-year-old So You Think You Can Dance alum has a consultation with Dr. Cat Begovic, who proves to be more sympathetic than the male doctor she had previously met with. </p>

<p>'I had some tearing on my labia,' she says of the injury, which she suffered when she gave birth to her daughter in 2016. 'They tried to sew it up. I could feel the thread being pulled through the skin, but because I didn’t have any pain medication I pretty much wimped out.'</p>

<p>Going under the knife: Jessi Peralta, 38, consults with Dr. Cat Begovic about labia surgery on Monday's night's premiere of the E! reality series Dr. 90210</p>

<p>Hard to handle: In a preview clip from the episode, Peralta explains that she experienced 'some tearing' on her labia when she gave birth to her daughter in 2016</p>

<p>Dr. Begovic assures her that she didn't 'wimp out,' noting that not too many people can handle the pain of having 'sutures in that area' without any numbing medication.  </p>

<p>'As a woman, you want to feel sexy and it’s just made me very self-conscious,' Peralta admits to the plastic surgeon. </p>

<p>In her testimonial, the mom further explains her reasons for wanting the surgery, saying it has to with more than just function.  </p>

<p>'Let’s say a hook ripped your cheek in half. Could you still eat? Yeah, I can chew on the other side of my mouth. Can you still smile? Yeah, but it looks really crazy,' she says. 'Everything functions well, but it just looks a little crazy. So, if you can have it fixed, why not?'</p>

<p>Mom: The So You Think You Can Dance alum  is pictured with her four-year-old daughter </p>

<p>Feeling shy: The former Pussycat Doll, pictured in 2010, admits the appearance of her labia has negatively affected her sex life with her husband because she's now self-conscious</p>

<p>Peralta says the appearance of her labia has also negatively affected her sex life with her husband because she is now more self-conscious that she had ever been before.</p>

<p>'Prior to the injury, I was much much more free sexually with my husband. Ever since, I am not confident enough to allow the access that he wants,' she says, laughing. 'Access has been denied.' </p>

<p>Peralta admits that she had previously looked into getting surgery to repair the damage, but the doctor minimized her concerns. </p>

<p>'I did have an experience with a male OB/GYN who told me, "Oh why would you do that? It’s not worth it. You just look like any ol' woman that’s had a baby, and who cares?" And it’s like, I care and that’s enough of a reason,' she tells Dr. Begovic, who readily agrees. </p>

<p>Candid: 'Prior to the injury, I was much much more free sexually with my husband. Ever since, I am not confident enough to allow the access that he wants,' she tells the plastic surgeon </p>

<p>'Exactly, and I’m so glad that you didn’t let that discourage you or make you feel bad in any way. You caring is enough,' the doctor assures her.</p>

<p>'See, you understand because you’re another woman,' Peralta notes. </p>

<p>In her testimonial, the mom points out that a man would never wait to get something like this done if they were suffering. </p>

<p>'If a man were to experience some crazy penile experience, I’m sure he would have that fixed immediately. So why can’t women feel that same sense of urgency?' she asks. </p>

<p>Prerogative: The mom says a male doctor of hers dismissed her interest in surgery, saying: 'Oh why would you do that? It’s not worth it. You just look like any ol' woman that’s had a baby'</p>

<p>Just saying: In her testimonial, Peralta points out that a man would never wait to fix 'some crazy penile experience' </p>

<p>At the end of the clip, Peralta admits to Dr. Begovic that she is a big fan of hers. </p>

<p>'I found you on Snapchat,' she says. 'I was just so inspired by you and just found it fascinating to watch you do surgeries.'</p>

<p>Peralta says she was also drawn to the doctor because of her admittedly perfectionist tendencies.    </p>

<p>'Really, like 100 per cent of my effort is focused on having it look as perfect as possible,' Dr. Begovic says of her work as a plastic surgeon. </p>
