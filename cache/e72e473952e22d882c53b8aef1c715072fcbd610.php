<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Italian police are investigating claims that Luis Suarez CHEATED in his Italian citizenship test in a bid to secure his transfer to Juventus.</p>

<p>Suarez flew to Perugia last week and passed a dual citizenship test in order to speed up his move to the Serie A giants.</p>

<p>Although that deal has now fallen through, Suarez could yet find himself in hot water after claims by Repubblica and Ansa that there were 'irregularities' in the test.</p>

<p>Luis Suarez arrived in Perugia last week to take an Italian test ahead of a potential move to Juve</p>

<p>It has now been claimed that Suarez cheated in the test in order to speed up his move to Italy</p>

<p>It has been reported that Suarez was sent the questions in advance and passed the Italian language (B1 level) exam having already been told the answers, with an investigation by the Guardia di Finanza now underway. </p>

<p>Repubblica carried quotes from an official on Monday, who said: 'He does not speak a word of Italian. He does not conjugate verbs, he only speaks using the infinitive. If journalists would ask him some questions, he'd be lost. He earns €10million a year, he needs to pass this exam.'</p>

<p>The police are now said to be acquiring documentation from the University of Perugia, where Suarez's test took place, and the player risks heavy legal action by the Public Prosecutor of Perugia.</p>

<p>In a statement from the Prosecutor, it was explained: 'During the investigations delegated since February 2020 to the Economic and Financial Police Unit of the Guardia di Finanza of Perugia, irregularities in the test of certification of the Italian language, carried out on 17 September last, by the Uruguayan footballer Luis Alberto Suarez Diaz. </p>

<p>Alvaro Morata's move to Juventus has seemingly ended Suarez's chance of going there anyway</p>

<p>Suarez watches Barcelona's pre-season friendly against Elche from the stands last week</p>

<p>'From the investigative activities it was found that the exam topics were previously agreed with the candidate and that the relative score was attributed even before the oral test was carried out, although it was found during the distance lessons held by the University teachers an elementary knowledge of the Italian language. </p>

<p>'Today, the soldiers of the Guardia di Finanza are proceeding with documentary acquisitions at the University offices as well as the notification of guarantee information for the crimes of disclosure of office secrets, ideological falsehood committed by the public official in public acts.'</p>

<p>Suarez, meanwhile, is now not set to join Juventus anyway after they secured the return of Alvaro Morata on loan from Atletico Madrid.</p>

<p>Suarez is one of Barcelona's all-time top goalscorers but he doesn't appear to have a future</p>

<p>Suarez could now join up with Diego Simeone at Atletico, but Barca want to stop the deal</p>

<p>That deal has paved the way for Suarez to join Atletico Madrid instead, effectively rendering his Italian test pointless.</p>

<p>That said, it has been reported that even his move across Spain will not be plain sailing, with Barcelona attempting to put a stop to the move.</p>

<p>Onda Cero report that Barca want to add Atletico Madrid to a list of 'vetoed teams' that Suarez can't join when they finally agree to cancel his Nou Camp contract. </p>
