<p>Using the largest telescope in Europe, known as GREGOR, scientists captured stunning details of sunspot evolution and complex design of solar plasma. Pictured is a A sunspot observed in high resolution by the GREGOR telescope at the wavelength 430 nm</p>

<p>Our star is covered in numerous cell-like structures — each the size of the US state of Texas — that are the product of the violent convection motions that transport heat up from deep within the Sun's interior.</p>

<p>In each, hot plasma rises up in the bright center of the cell before cooling off and sinking back into the star to form dark lanes that can be seen by GREGOR – some have compared it to the look of popcorn.</p>

<p>Dr. Lucia Kleint, who led the project and the German solar telescopes on Tenerife, said: 'This was a very exciting, but also extremely challenging project. In only one year we completely redesigned the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve the best possible image quality.'</p>

<p>Kleint and her team made a breakthrough in March while under the coronavirus lockdown that allowed them to obtain the up-close look at the sun.</p>

<p>The photographs show solar magnetic fields taken at a wavelength 516 nanometers (pictured) and sunspots at 430 nanometers, which astronomers say it is 'as if one saw a needle on a soccer field perfectly sharp from a distance of one kilometer'</p>

<p>The group was stranded at the observatory, allowing them time to design a new optical laboratory.</p>

<p>Dr. Svetlana Berdyugina, professor at the Albert-Ludwig University of Freiburg and Director of the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS), is very happy about the outstanding results: 'The project was rather risky because such telescope upgrades usually take years, but the great team work and meticulous planning have led to this success.</p>

<p>'Now we have a powerful instrument to solve puzzles on the Sun.'</p>

<p>The stunning images follow the first light photos obtained in July by a team working with the Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii, which allows astronomers to analyze the details of the sun's surface and learn more about how space weather forms.</p>

<p>These are the highest resolution images a European telescope has observed, which the team attributes to new optics capable of probing the massive star's magnetic fields, convection, solar eruptions and sunspots with great detail – unlike ever before</p>

<p>The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy president Matt Mountain said in July: 'On Earth, we can predict if it is going to rain pretty much anywhere in the world very accurately, but space weather just isn't there yet.'</p>

<p>Our predictions lag behind terrestrial weather by 50 years, if not more.'</p>

<p>'What we need is to grasp the underlying physics behind space weather, and this starts at the sun, which is what the Inouye Solar Telescope will study.'</p>
