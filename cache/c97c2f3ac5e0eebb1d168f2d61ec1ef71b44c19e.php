<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Celebrating an anniversary in a relationship is an occasion not many partners forget.</p>

<p>Unless you are Sarah Boulazeris, who completely blanked on her model boyfriend Kris Smith when he surprised her with balloons for their third anniversary.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old took to Instagram on Thursday to share the 29-year-old's reaction - knowing that she would forget.</p>

<p>Oh no! Sarah Boulazeris has completely blanked on remembering the third anniversary she shares with her model boyfriend Kris Smith, who took to Instagram to Thursday (pictured) to capture her reaction when surprising her with balloons</p>

<p>'Two years running,' the Myer ambassador captioned the video.</p>

<p>'Brownie points through the roof.' </p>

<p>The Myer ambassador, who shares two children with Sarah, saw the humour in the situation. </p>

<p>Memorable moment: Kris (left), who shares two children with Sarah (right), saw the humour in the situation. He can be seen smiling toward the camera while leading Sarah into the living room before she realised her mistake</p>

<p>'You've forgotten again,' he exclaimed. </p>

<p>'Happy anniversary babe ... f***ing forgot again.'</p>

<p>Happy family: Kris and Sarah (pictured with kids Mila and Frankie) first started dating in 2017 after Kris' breakup with model and nutritionist Maddy King in October 2016</p>

<p>Sarah then shrinks into the corner of the couch out of embarrassment before questioning the date of their anniversary.</p>

<p>'It's not ... it's tomorrow,' she said.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two also forgot her and Kris' anniversary last year.  </p>

<p>Oops! The mother-of-two also forgot her and Kris' anniversary last year</p>

<p>She even acquired the help of a friend to remember this year because of it.</p>

<p>'I forgot to tell you,' one commented on the video Kris, 42, shared of the moment. </p>

<p>'We are done,' Sarah joked in response.</p>

<p>The happy couple first started dating in 2017 after Kris' breakup with model and nutritionist Maddy King in October 2016.</p>

<p>Kris also has a 10-year-old son, Ethan Edward Minogue Smith, with ex-girlfriend and singer Danii Minogue - who the doting parents agree to keep out of the public eye until he is older.</p>

<p>Moving forward! Despite the mistake this year, Kris and Sarah (pictured together) appear to be incredibly happy and always have their next anniversary to look forward to!</p>
