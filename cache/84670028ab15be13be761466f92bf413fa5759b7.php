<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pfizer Inc says it could have results from its late-stage coronavirus vaccine trial available as early as October. </p>

<p>On Thursday, CEO Albert Bourla said during a call sponsored by drug industry group International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations that  23,000 volunteers have been enrolled in the phase III trial, which began in July. </p>

<p>The New York-based drug company says if data shows the jab is safe and effective, it will submit an application for approval, along with its German partner BioNTech, immediately.</p>

<p>'We expect by the end of October, we should have enough...to say whether the product works or not,' Bourla said.</p>

<p>Pfizer is in a race with companies such as AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna and Sanofi to produce a vaccine as President Donald Trump pledged his administration could have an inoculation before the November 3 election.  </p>

<p>The vaccine candidate from Pfizer and BioNTech uses part of the pathogen's genetic code called messenger RNA, or mRNa.</p>

<p>It trains the body to recognize the coronavirus, which will send out an immune response if a person becomes infected.</p>

<p>In July, the company released data from its early-stage trial, involving 45 people who received either a low, medium or high dose of the vaccine in two shots or a placebo.</p>

<p>Volunteers given either the low or medium dose generated not just antibodies against the virus but specifically neutralizing antibodies, meaning they stop the virus from infecting human cells.</p>

<p>Results showed the levels of neutralizing antibodies were between 1.8 and 2.8 times greater than those seen in recovered patients.</p>

<p>Pfizer says it hopes to enroll up to 30,000 participants. The trial is expected to take place at 120 sites across the world, including 39 US states. </p>

<p>In July, the US government signed a $1.95 billion-deal with Pfizer in exchange for 100 million doses of its immunization.</p>

<p>The agreement was part of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's plan to fast-track coronavirus vaccine candidates in America.</p>

<p>Pfizer says it plans to supply 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and about 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. </p>

<p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said it is possible a vaccine ready by the end of October, but that he is not counting on it.</p>

<p>'These are all guesstimates,' Fauci told CNN when asked about Pfizer's plans, adding that most believe an inoculation will be ready by November or December. </p>

<p>'It is conceivable that you can have it by October, though I don't think that that's likely.'</p>

<p>It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told states to prepare to distribute a vaccine as soon as November. </p>

<p>This has made public health experts worry that Trump is pressuring regulators to get a jab on the market before there is enough data to review.</p>

<p>However, Pfizer says its will not submit an application for approval if the results don't prove the vaccine is safe and effective. </p>

<p>'We will never ourselves submit for authorization or approval any vaccine before we feel it is safe and effective,' Bourla said. </p>

<p>'We will not cut corners. Our phase three study will be the only one that will allow us to say if we have a safe and effective vaccine. If we don't have results from a phase three study, we would not submit.'</p>
