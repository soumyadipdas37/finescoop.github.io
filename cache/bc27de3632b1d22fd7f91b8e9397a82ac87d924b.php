<p>Mr Zhao's death was ruled to be non-suspicious by a coroner earlier this week</p>

<p>Detective Senior Constable Nicholas Jung told the court Mr Zhao died from a mix of drugs - including an antidepressant - and had been having suicidal thoughts in the lead up to his death.</p>

<p>'As a result of the investigation I've got absolutely no concerns that a third party was involved in the death of Mr Zhao,' Detective Sen-Constable Jung told the court.</p>

<p>'Suicide and mental health was something that had been an issue for Mr Zhao months prior to him passing away.'</p>

<p>The meeting with the other two men is thought to have been a last-ditch effort to minimise possibility penalties for the accusations against him.  </p>

<p>The coroner's written report will be released in the coming weeks. </p>
