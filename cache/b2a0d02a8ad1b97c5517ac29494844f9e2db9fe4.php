<p>The Sky Sports pundit argues that Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial need competition but he believes that could come from various top-flight players, not just Sancho.</p>

<p>United have been in negations with the Borussia Dortmund striker for several months but the Bundesliga side have made it clear they will not be parting ways with their key asset until their demands of £100million are met.</p>

<p>Gary Neville says Manchester United should sign the likes of Harry Kane over Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>Neville has also expressed his concern over the lack of signings United have made, claiming that they need to strengthen at least five areas.</p>

<p>Neville says a 'world class centre-back' is a necessity and that Ole Gunnar Solkjear's side could also benefit from 'a right winger, a centre-forward and left-back'.</p>

<p>The United legend told Sky Sports: 'The fans I speak to aren't saying we desperately want Sancho. They are saying we want the right calibre of signing brought into the club. It could be anybody that fits that bill.</p>

<p>'Yes, Sancho may fit that bill, but I'm not sat here as a United fan thinking I desperately want him. It could be any number of players that become available that would improve United.</p>

<p>Man United have been in negations with the Borussia Dortmund striker for several months</p>

<p>With negotiations taking so long, Neville believes United could use the cash for other players</p>

<p>'If Harry Kane became available, and Tottenham fans will be saying why are you trying to get him out of Spurs again, but if he became available, he'd obviously improve United's squad. So it doesn't have to be a certain player.</p>

<p>'The emergence of Mason Greenwood takes a bit of pressure off the situation but still, Manchester United need to add to the front three of Greenwood, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.</p>

<p>'They need to challenge those three players and support those three players. They need to have depth behind those three players, and they will drive the standards.</p>

<p>He believes Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial need competition </p>

<p>Neville says the Red Devils need to invest in another left-back because of Luke Shaw's injuries</p>

<p>'We saw that with Greenwood, Martial and Rashford towards the end of the season. They were driving each other to score more goals, assist each other, they were playing better together so other players coming in of that kind of quality are going to improve them.'</p>

<p>When asked specifically where he believes United should reinforce their squad, Neville added:  'They have to sign a world class centre-back. For me, another midfield player. I also think a right winger, a centre-forward and you have to look at left-back because of Luke Shaw's injuries and the fact he has obviously been in and out of the team in the last two or three years.</p>

<p>'So, I think there are definitely four or five players required and to not get three, I think it would be a problem because of what the other clubs are doing.</p>

<p>'If Liverpool get Thiago, if Manchester City do what they are looking like they are going to do and with Chelsea doing what they've done, they are your competitors and they all look like they are improving and moving forward.</p>

<p>'So, United have to do business but I do believe more in the strategy of what's happening, they just have to get the deals over the line.</p>

<p>'That's not always easy but they have to try and do it quickly to give Ole the time to build to get this team moulded for the start of the season.'</p>
