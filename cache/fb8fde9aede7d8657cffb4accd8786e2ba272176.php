<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Spirit Airlines flight attendant has threatened to call police on a passenger who was wearing a neck gaiter as a face covering. </p>

<p>The incident, which occurred during a flight on the budget carrier sometime last week, was recorded by the passenger and posted to social media. </p>

<p>The video was picked up by SV News on Friday and has since gone viral, with many debating whether neck gaiters - which can be pulled up over the nose and mouth -  are adequate face covering for a domestic flight. </p>

<p>The passenger's gaiter was also covered in stars and stripes, prompting some to accuse the flight attendant of being anti-American - an accusation that was swiftly shut down by Spirit. </p>

<p>A Spirit Airlines flight attendant has threatened to call police on a passenger who was wearing a  stars-and-stripes neck gaiter as a face covering</p>

<p>The video begins with the flight attendant asking the passenger to put on a face mask provided by the airline. The passenger responds that he is already wearing a face covering. </p>

<p>'No,' the attendant scolds. 'What do you have underneath it [the gaiter]? That is not legal to wear.''</p>

<p>'Legal by who? What's wrong with my mask?' the passenger snaps back. </p>

<p>'It's not legal according to the CDC,' the attendant claims, before later say that the 'authorities' will be waiting for the passenger when the plane lands. </p>

<p>The passenger claims he has flown '20 times' wearing just the neck gaiter over his nose and mouth, and has not run into any problems.  </p>

<p>The video cuts off before the issue is resolved, and it's unclear whether police subsequently met the man at the arrivals gate. </p>

<p>The flight attendant is pictured. Spirit is standing by the employee despite the controversy</p>

<p>Spirit is standing by the flight attendant, releasing a statement on Friday, which reads in part: 'The CDC cautions that gaiters may not be effective, which is why we require guests to either double-up neck gaiters so they're dual-layered and hug the chin, or to wear a standard ear-loop face covering underneath it.'</p>

<p>The incident divided Twitter users, with one writing: ' I'm an American flag lover all the way. Those neck gaiters are worthless though. I used one at the farm while horse back riding and they do not even filter dust. They are basically like taking the thinnest t-shirt you could imagine and putting it over your mouth.'</p>

<p>However, others vehemently disagreed. </p>

<p>One wrote: 'I was literally handed a mask of this type by American airlines.. so they are ok to wear.. it must be because it's a flag... I smell lawsuit'.</p>

<p>Spirit responded to the anti-American accusations, stating: 'Spirit Airlines proudly welcomes anyone onboard who wants to show their pride with an American flag on a face covering that complies with our policy. </p>

<p>'Our flight attendants asked the guest in this video to double up his gaiter. When he refused, they offered him an ear-loop mask to place under his gaiter, and he refused that option, too.' </p>

<p>Spirit responded to the anti-American accusations, stating: 'Spirit Airlines proudly welcomes anyone onboard who wants to show their pride with an American flag on a face covering that complies with our policy'</p>
