<p>The Ohio native said: 'It’s difficult because at some point you have to have conversations with the kids about what it means to be who they are, to have brown skin and to come from the ancestry they do. </p>

<p>'It’s a little early for both of them to know all the details about what’s going on with police brutality.'</p>

<p>'It makes you think about work priorities. As soon as we had Luna, I thought more about my work schedule and how much I wanted to be home. </p>

<p>'It’s a different kind of love. You feel love for them because they’re yours, but you feel this responsibility for them as well.'</p>
