<p>Removing: Coronavirus denier Pete Evans has revealed that social media platforms Facebook and Instagram are removing posts and pages which share his same dangerous beliefs</p>

<p>His post continued: 'Thank you to all the people that have jumped on to telegram to follow. I post a lot of different information on there.</p>

<p>'It seems that fb and insta are removing more and more pages by the day and there are some new rules just announced for October which is going to make it a lot more interesting,' he added. </p>

<p>This comes after Pete seemingly contradicted himself by providing a 'COVID Safe' disclaimer on the website of his 'healing clinic' in Byron Bay.</p>

<p>The disclaimer states that the clinic is committed to high standards of hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic - which Evans supposedly believes is fake.</p>

<p>Pete's Facebook account and his Evolve with Pete Evans podcast also feature similar disclaimers, which state that Evans is not a health professional and that people should consult qualified medical experts instead.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the disclaimer on his podcast states that Evans 'does not endorse' the 'opinions and conclusions' of the guests he openly praises and agrees with. </p>

<p>Evans' harmful views have ranged from blaming coronavirus on 5G cell towers to actively encouraging his followers to not wear masks in Melbourne, which is currently in stage-four lockdown. </p>

<p>He and his wife, New Zealand glamour model Nicola Robinson, are now preparing to open their Evolve Health Labs clinic in Australia's hippie capital.</p>

<p>Despite believing the pandemic is a hoax, the former TV star is still complying with the New South Wales government by registering his business as COVID-safe. </p>

<p>According to the company's Instagram account, the clinic will offer 'transformational practices' such as 'cold and conscious breath-work' and 'cryotherapy'. </p>

<p>Complying: Despite believing the pandemic is a hoax, the former TV star is still complying with the New South Wales government by registering his business as COVID-safe</p>

<p>Despite this, Evans has recently interviewed a string of conspiracy theorists and anti-vaccination activists, whom he offers uncritical and unwavering support.</p>

<p>In June, Evans was invited on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes to share his bizarre conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the 5G network.</p>
