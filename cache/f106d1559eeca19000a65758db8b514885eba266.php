<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australia has officially sunk into recession for the first time in almost 30 years with a quarterly slump that is worse than the 1930s Great Depression.</p>

<p>Figures for the June quarter showed a record seven per cent contraction, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has confirmed.</p>

<p>On an annual basis, the economy shrunk by 6.3 per cent. </p>

<p>The national accounts data confirmed a technical recession for the first time since mid-1991, following a 0.3 per cent decline in gross domestic product during the March quarter.</p>

<p>Until today, Australia officially held a 29-year world record for avoiding a recession but COVID-19 social distancing policies have ended that with a bang.</p>

<p>Australia's first recession in almost 30 years is set to be confirmed on Wednesday. Figures for the June quarter are expected to show the worst economic downturn since the 1930s Great Depression, with economists forecasting a contraction of at least five per cent from the coronavirus pandemic.

<p>Up until the 1991 recession, Australia had suffered an economic contraction several times a decade, on average.</p>

<p>A prolonged recession that began in September 1982 lasted a year, during a period of prolonged drought and the devastating Ash Wednesday bushfires in Victoria and South Australia. That followed another recession in 1981.</p>

<p>Another recession also occurred in 1977, during an era of widespread strikes.</p>

<p>The economy also took a beating in the final two quarters of 1975, when Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam as Labor Prime Minister.</p>

<p>A recession also occurred in late 1971 and early 1972, several months before Billy McMahon lost the election, ending 23 years of Coalition rule.</p>

<p>A credit squeeze also sparked another recession during the June and September quarters of 1961, ending only two months before then Prime Minister Robert Menzies held on to power by one seat.</p>

<p>A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction and the last time Australia had one, mobile phones were the size of bricks. </p>

<p>The downturn experienced in 2020 is at a level unseen since the early days of radio and before the invention of television. </p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, the architect of Australia's biggest-ever stimulus crisis spending packages, now has the daunting task of engineering an economic recovery - with unemployment tipped to reach double-digit figures by Christmas for the first time since 1994.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, he hailed the 'remarkable resilience of the Australian economy' in Parliament on Tuesday - as COVID-19 border closures and social distancing rules destroy many services jobs.</p>

<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday left interest rates on hold at a record-low of 0.25 per cent.</p>

<p>Governor Philip Lowe, however, said Melbourne's Stage 4 lockdowns were holding back Australia's economic recovery.</p>

<p>'In Australia, the economy is going through a very difficult period and is experiencing the biggest contraction since the 1930s,' he said.</p>

<p>'This recovery is likely to be both uneven and bumpy, with the coronavirus outbreak in Victoria having a major effect on the Victorian economy.</p>

<p>'The virus outbreak in Victoria and subdued growth in aggregate demand more broadly mean that it is likely to be some months before a meaningful recovery in the labour market is under way.'</p>

<p>The Reserve Bank is forecasting Australia's jobless rate rising from a 22-year-high 7.5 per cent in July to ten per cent by the end of 2020 - a level unseen since April 1994.</p>

<p>Mr Frydenberg is keenly awaiting Victoria's roadmap out of its lockdown, due for release on Sunday, so he can plan an economic revival.</p>

<p>Legislation splitting JobKeeper wage subsidies into a two-tiered system and extending the program for another six months have breezed through Parliament, with the $1,500 flat fortnightly rate to end later this month.</p>

<p>Australians who worked less than 20 hours a week before the crisis struck will be paid $750 a fortnight from the end of September, while all others will receive $1,200.</p>

<p>The maximum payment will come down to $1,000 from December to March.</p>

<p>Debate around border closures continues, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and state premiers to discuss the definition of a 'hot spot' at a national cabinet meeting on Friday.</p>

<p>The definition could put pressure on other states with low case numbers to allow travel across their borders.</p>

<p>Mr Frydenberg said border arrangements needed to be more flexible.</p>

<p>'Right now they're too cruel, too confused and there's not enough compassion and not enough common sense,' he said.</p>

<p>Victoria appears to be getting its deadly second wave of infections under control, with 70 new cases on Tuesday - the lowest daily increase since early July.</p>

<p>The state recorded another five deaths, taking the national toll to 657. </p>
