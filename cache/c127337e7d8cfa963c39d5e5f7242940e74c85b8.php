<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The wife of Donald Trump's demoted campaign boss Brad Parscale fled screaming into the street in just her bikini - before telling a passerby: 'I think my husband just killed himself'.</p>

<p>Police raced to Parscale's Fort Lauderdale, Florida home Sunday afternoon after the Good Samaritan bundled Candice Parscale into her car and dialed 911.</p>

<p>As many as 20 police cars and boats swarmed the waterfront property after the distraught wife told cops she heard a revolver being cocked and a 'loud boom' after her 44-year-old husband began 'ranting and raving'.</p>

<p>Candice, 41, then buried her head in the stranger's lap and sobbed uncontrollably until officers revealed he was still alive and asked for his cell number so they could begin negotiations.</p>

<p>The witness, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, told DailyMail.com she also noticed evidence of bruising on Candice's upper arms.</p>

<p>Police dispatch records reveal marksmen could see into the $2.4 million property where Parscale was sat shirtless on the floor with his dog, drinking beer and 'talking to himself'.</p>

<p>The chaotic scene ended without tragedy about an hour and a half later when he agreed to surrender and was involuntarily committed to a hospital by Fort Lauderdale police. </p>

<p>The president announced in July he was replacing Parscale with longtime political aide Bill Stepien. </p>

<p>Well-placed sources told DailyMail.com Parscale is under investigation for the theft of campaign funds. </p>

<p>A police report obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals that Parscale had ten weapons inside the home, including two rifles, two shotguns, five handguns and a small revolver. </p>

<p>The witness, who just happened to be passing by the swank home, said: 'I was on the phone to a friend when I noticed this woman coming towards me with virtually nothing on, just her bathing suit.</p>

<p>'She knocked on the window and says, I think my husband just killed himself. I said, Oh my God. Oh my God, come get in my car and I hung up on my friend and dialed 911.</p>

<p>'She was hysterical, she was hyperventilating, she nearly collapsed but I caught her and pulled her into the vehicle. She had her head in my lap and she was just sobbing. I was just trying to keep her calm.</p>

<p>'When she was in the car and we were on hold, I saw both her arms had bruises. She is just a tiny thing. She seemed so sweet and distraught.'</p>

<p>A police report obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com reveals that Parscale had ten weapons inside the home (pictured), including two rifles, two shotguns, five hand guns and a small revolver </p>

<p>As the two women huddled in the vehicle, cops surrounded the property, stationing marksmen with shields in front of the driveway while approaching from the rear on boats.</p>

<p>A video obtained by DailyMail.com reveals Candice, by now wrapped in a white towel, peering over a line of police cars as officers call up her husband's cell and negotiate his surrender.</p>

<p>'The police presence was huge, they were being extra protective in case he started shooting. Once he answered the phone they knew he was alive,' the Good Samaritan said.</p>

<p>'I didn't see him come out of the house because they made everyone stand so far back. But it was over quickly, maybe an hour and a half to two hours. The police were very calm, very professional.</p>

<p>'The wife was sat on a gurney for a while and she seemed to calm down. There had clearly been some stress for a while and she just seemed relieved it was over. Her husband has got a lot going on, he's a mess.'</p>

<p>Trump and Parscale's relationship had been increasingly strained before his demotion, with the president annoyed by the publicity Parscale had garnered.</p>

<p>But the final straw appeared to be a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally that drew an unexpectedly low crowd of about 6,200 people after Parscale had bragged that more than a million people had requested tickets.</p>

<p>The president was said to be furious. </p>

<p>Parscale, a political novice, ran Trump's digital advertising in 2016 and was credited with helping bring about his surprise victory that year.</p>

<p>His replacement, Stepien, has been in politics for years, working for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and serving as Trump's national field director in 2016.</p>

<p>The ousted Trump 2020 campaign manager retreated to his waterfront Florida home after being ditched, where he and his wife hosted friends for poolside drinks. </p>
