<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the shocking moment a woman on a flight to Michigan appeared to have a meltdown in the air.</p>

<p>Video filmed by a fellow passenger shows the woman screaming as she climbs the seats – many of which are empty between rows of travelers.</p>

<p>The distressed passenger appears with her surgical face mask pulled down on her chin as she yells profanities at the top of her lungs and a cabin crew member asks her to take her seat but stands in shock after she's ignored.</p>

<p>Video footage shows a woman climbing onto the plane seats during a flight to Detroit</p>

<p>At one point, the woman wearing casual joggers and a jacket, clings onto the top of the overheard cabin bins containing hand luggage and shouts, 'We're going to f*** all night b***h,' repeatedly.</p>

<p>She does not appear to be speaking to anyone in particular and she stands on the arm and neck rests to project her statements.</p>

<p>Throughout, the woman is seen using the tops of the overhead bins to gain leverage and thrust her hips forward.</p>

<p>At time she beats on the lockers, prompting the latches to come undone and the containers to open. Some items partially fall out.</p>

<p>At that point three men slowly move forward to usher her to the front, 'Are you ready to go?' one asks?</p>

<p>While she seems to calm initially, she begins to yell again as they move away from the camera and their actions are no longer clear.</p>

<p>She clings onto the top of the overheard cabin bins containing hand luggage and shouts, 'We're going to f*** all night b***h,' repeatedly</p>

<p>It's unclear if any fellow passengers were harmed during the apparent breakdown.</p>

<p>One passenger speaking from behind the camera speculated that the woman was under the influence of a drug.</p>

<p>Commenting that she was 'fine' about half an hour ago, the witness claimed she must have taken something in the bathroom.</p>

<p>The cabin crew member seen in the clip tells passengers she was trying to block her.</p>

<p>Some viewers of the video obtained by World Star Hip Hop compared the incident to an exorcism and joked that she was possessed by demons.</p>

<p>Information about the airline or other details were not provided.</p>
