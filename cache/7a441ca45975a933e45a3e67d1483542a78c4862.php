<p>He wrote: 'I want to dedicate this win to Chad and his family, he was such an inspiration and his legacy will live on.</p>

<p>'I'm posting this image because we must continue to fight for equality, nothing has changed yet and the battle continues.'</p>

<p>F1 star Hamilton had led the way with an emotional message, paying tribute to 'our super hero'</p>

<p>Chadwick Boseman performed the Wakanda salute as T'Challa in a popular scene of the Marvel film the Black Panther. </p>

<p>According to director Ryan Coogler, the inspiration behind the salute comes from the way Pharaohs are laid to rest, as well as West African sculptures.</p>

<p>The salute, which also means 'hug' in American Sign Language, is hugely popular among fans of the film.</p>

<p>The salute became synonymous with Boseman, who would often perform it at movie premieres.</p>

<p>Hamilton led from start to finish in Belgium to record his 89th career win, and fifth triumph of the season, having finished 15 seconds ahead of third-placed rival Max Verstappen. </p>

<p>The masterful performance was made even more impressive after the tragic news surrounding Boseman's shock passing broke. </p>

<p>The world champion led the way in sharing messages for the actor before sealing pole position in qualifying on Saturday. </p>

<p>'I woke up today to the sad news, our super hero passed away,' he wrote on Twitter. 'I'm so grateful I got to meet you brother. Thank you for all you have done for us.</p>

<p>'Rest in Power, you were the best of us and will never be forgotten. Love, light and prayers I send to you and your family.' </p>

<p>Boseman passed away at his Los Angeles home with his wife and family by his side. </p>

<p>'It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman. Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV,' the family said.</p>

<p>'A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much.' </p>

<p>The actor had been known for playing real-life figures, including professional baseball player Jackie Robinson in 2013 biopic, 42, James Brown in 2014's Get On Up, and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in 2017's Marshall. </p>
