<p>Manuel Neuer (R) would have got Joachim Low's vote for Ballon d'Or over Robert Lewandowski</p>

<p>Germany boss Low believes that Bayern No 1 Neuer has been the standout performer this year</p>

<p>'Manu was in great shape throughout the 2019-20 season,' he told Kicker. 'Manu is in a class of his own. Crazy, unbelievable.</p>

<p>'I have nothing against Robert Lewandowski, he is a world-class goalscorer, but for me, the best player in the world this year would be Manuel Neuer. What he did in the Final 8 in Lisbon! He kept the shop shut!</p>

<p>'Manuel was on hand in difficult situations against Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain, otherwise it might be 0-1 or 1-1. You had the feeling that he was omnipresent.' </p>

<p>Neuer kept 22 clean sheets in 51 appearances for Bayern last campaign and played a crucial role in their path to Champions League glory in Portugal.</p>

<p>However the Ballon d'Or will not be awarded this year for the first time since it was launched in 1956 due to the 2019-20 season being disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
