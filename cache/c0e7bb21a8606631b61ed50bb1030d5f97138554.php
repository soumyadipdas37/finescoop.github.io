<p>Donald Fear, 57, from Telford, was revealed as the sixth champion in the ITV programme's 22-year history last week, and spent the day after his win in July at a holiday caravan with his wife Deb in Whitley Bay, Northumberland. </p>

<p>Donald Fear (pictured) , 57, from Telford, became the sixth champion in ITV quiz show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? 22-year history last week</p>

<p>He spent the day after his win on a holiday caravan with his wife Deb (pictured right) in Whitley Bay, Northumberland </p>

<p>'I don't know how you spend that much,' he said. 'The first priority is just making sure I have a comfortable retirement and after that my tastes are fairly reasonable. I spend money on CDs, but you'd struggle to spend a million pounds on CDs.</p>

<p>'I’ll make sure I have enough for myself and turn to family, see who needs what in the family.' </p>

<p>Speaking of the night of his spectacular win, he added: 'We had all my family round and we were going away on holiday the next day. </p>

<p>'We were supposed to be going away to Spain, but because of Covid had booked a last-minute caravan holiday in Whitley Bay and so actually spent the evening packing.' </p>

<p>The father-of-four appeared on This Morning today, where he confessed that while he doesn't know 'how you spend that much' money</p>

<p>While Donald managed to keep his win secret from some members of the family, he was unable to hide anything from his wife Deb.  </p>

<p>'I didn’t phone anyone from the studio itself,said Donald. 'I was trying to keep it a secret, but so many decisions have to be taken with my wife, so I decided to tell her as soon as I arrived home.' </p>

<p>Donald is a history and politics teacher at Haberdashers' Adams Grammar school in Newport, Shropshire and says his £5000,000 question was a 'standard A-Level politics class question'.  </p>

<p>'The £5000,000 question was a case and point, that James Callaghan held all four of the great offices of state is a standard A-Level politics class question,' he told. </p>

<p>However the teacher admitted he would have been less knowledgeable if we were given pop culture questions. </p>

<p>Donald was able to answer the £1million question – 'In 1718, which pirate died in battle off the coast of what is now North Carolina?' – before he'd seen it properly</p>

<p>'I do own a large number of the That's What I Call Music CDs, but I'm not sure who was number one in 2004,' he said. </p>

<p>Host Holly Willoughby then quizzed him: 'What about The Kardashians? </p>

<p>'The who?' replied Donald. </p>

<p>Today he returned to work to find students and peers were thrilled about his win - however admitted he will be stepping back from his role at the end of the school term. </p>

<p>'I'm just about to teach a sixth form class,' he said. 'I walked into school with clapping and cheering.'  </p>

<p>His older brother Davyth had also been a contestant on the programme last year - but fell at the final hurdle, walking away with £500,000 on September 1.  </p>

<p>Host Holly Willoughby (pictured) then quizzed him on his popular culture knowledge asking how much he knew about the Kardashians, to which he replied: 'the who?'  </p>

<p>Donald is a history and politics teacher at Haberdashers' Adams Grammar school in Newport, Shropshire and today returned to work </p>

<p>'He was absolutely made up, said Donald, 'He was so pleased.' </p>

<p>Speaking of their childhood, he went on: 'We didn’t have a telly, we didn’t have a car and quizzes have been a staple of my life from as young as I can remember. </p>

<p>'We were all very close in age, and a very close and loving family and games and quizzes have always been part of our existence really, I can't imagine a time it wasn't.'  </p>

<p>Donald was able to answer the £1million question – 'In 1718, which pirate died in battle off the coast of what is now North Carolina?' – before he'd seen it properly, because he'd taught piracy one year as a special unit and was very good with dates. </p>

<p>He said: 'The first thing I spotted as the question flashed up on my screen is the date, and I knew it would be Blackbeard and I had Blackbeard in my head before I read the question, and then it was Blackbeard.'  </p>
