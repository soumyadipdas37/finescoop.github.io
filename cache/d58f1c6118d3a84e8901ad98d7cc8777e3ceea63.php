<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the moment a British man who claims to have spent three days at sea on a surfboard after falling off a cruise ship, was plucked from the water.</p>

<p>Coastguards who rescued him released the picture today, showing him with a lifejacket on over a white shirt with his sleeves rolled up his arms.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Spanish Coastguards said in a tweet, naming the vessel the tourist was pictured alongside as it approached him to pull him from the sea: 'Salvamar Vega yesterday rescued and took to Estepona a man discovered by a yacht 10 miles south-west of Marbella.</p>

<p>'He was adrift on a surfboard. The man who was rescued said he had been at sea for three days after falling from a ship.' </p>

<p>The 55-year-old was picked up by the coastguard near Marbella on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>This is the moment a British man who claims to have spent three days at sea on a surfboard after falling off a cruise ship, was plucked from the water yesterday by the Spanish coastguard near Marbella</p>

<p>A British man who was found floating fully-dressed on a surfboard in the middle of the ocean has told Spanish officials he spent three days adrift after falling off a cruise ship</p>

<p>Crew members on a yacht called Estelar spotted the man and alerted rescuers.</p>

<p>They said he was fully dressed and claimed to have spent several days at sea after falling off a boat. It is not clear how he obtained the surfboard. </p>

<p>Local reports late on Monday night described the man as British and the vessel he fell from as a cruise ship - which has yet to be identified.</p>

<p>The man is said to have told the coastguard that the accident had happened three days earlier.</p>

<p>Coastguard vessel Salvamar Vega took him to Estepona Port before a waiting ambulance took him to a local health centre to be treated for hypothermia.</p>

<p>His exact whereabouts on Monday night were unknown.</p>

<p>Police - who could not be reached for comment - are expected to question him about his ordeal once he is well enough.</p>

<p>It is not known if the man was on holiday in Spain or is a resident there.</p>

<p>The rescue has fuelled a wave of speculation about how the mystery man ended up on a surfboard.</p>

<p>One social media user said: 'I'm intrigued about this story, because finding a surfboard while you're lost at sea would be even stranger than falling off a boat with the surfboard.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'What's the story, that they threw the surfboard to him when he fell instead of rescuing him?'</p>

<p>Spain was put on the UK Government's mandatory quarantine list in July causing chaos as holidaymakers were given just five hours' notice.</p>

<p>British holidaymakers looking for a summer break in the Costas now must isolate for 14 days on their return to Britain.</p>

<p>Last week, Spain recorded a new single-day record for Covid-19 cases since the country emerged from a three-month lockdown in mid-June.</p>

<p>Some 7,039 confirmed cases were reported on Thursday, prompting Spain's chief epidemiologist to tell a press conference: 'Don't be confused, things are not going well.'</p>
