<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gruesome images have emerged showing the bloody injuries suffered by bare-knuckle boxers in Russia. </p>

<p>Those competing in 'Hardcore Fighting Championships' clashed in a cage on Monday without gloves. </p>

<p>The results are not for the faint hearted with nasty facial lacerations suffered by boxers competing for the prize money of just £10,000. </p>

<p>The Hardcore Fighting Championships in Russia is a bare-knuckle boxing promotion</p>

<p>Andrei Kiselev, pictured, was covered in blood during his bout in the round of 16</p>

<p>The event on Monday was hosted on a cargo ship and fighters suffered bloody injuries</p>

<p>Those competing sustained facial swelling and cuts as they competed for £10,000</p>

<p>It is the first bare-knuckle fighting league in Russia and the only protection available is strapping to the wrist and an optional gumshield. </p>

<p>The competition's quarter-final stage took place on a cargo ship called Rio-1 docked in Moscow and those in attendance appeared to ignore social distancing. </p>

<p>One fight saw two rival couriers for food companies, Andrei Kiselev and Anton Shchipochev, lock horns. </p>

<p>Bare-knuckle events appear to be growing in popularity around the world.  </p>

<p>Bare Knuckle FC in the United States has signed a number of former boxers and MMA fighters to compete, the latest being ex-UFC fan favourite Paige VanZant. </p>

<p>One competitor had blood streaming down his face from a laceration to his forehead</p>

<p>The only protection for fighters was some light wrist strapping and an optional gum shield </p>

<p>Conor McGregor's former team-mate and another UFC alumni Artem Lobov and former boxing world champion Pauli Malignaggi are also on their books. </p>

<p>The controversial events divide opinion with many condemning organisers for the barbaric nature of the competition. </p>

<p>But some defend the blood sport, arguing that it is in fact safer for the brain than boxing, despite the gore on show. </p>

<p>There were plenty of fans in attendance and social distancing went out the window</p>

<p>One Washington State University study found that people could generate 27.9 per cent more movement when punching a heavy bag with boxing gloves on rather than with their bare fist.</p>

<p>In the UK, ticketed events have attracted up to 800 fans despite a cost of nearly £100 to watch. </p>

<p>The sport has never been illegal in Britain but is not regulated or sanctioned by the British Boxing Board of Control. </p>
