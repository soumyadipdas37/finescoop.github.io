<p>Korean researchers have designed a lubricant-infused surface, intended to cover a ship's hull, which is covered with tiny cavities. </p>

<p>As the cavities are continuously filled with the lubricant, a layer is formed over the surface that helps slip easily though the water. </p>

<p>Computer simulations showed the coating can cut 'fluid friction' by nearly a fifth, the experts say.    </p>

<p>Slippery coatings will mean ships will require less power when travelling long distances, which will mean less fuel burnt.</p>

<p>'Our investigation of the hydrodynamics of a lubricant layer with a slippery surface in a basic configuration has provided significant insight into the benefits of a lubricant-infused surface,' say the researchers in their paper. </p>

<p>'Further research into mucus layers is expected to stimulate improvements in the energy-saving technology.'</p>

<p>Long-distance cargo ships lose propulsive power due to fluid friction, which is caused by the exposure of their large hull surfaces to seawater.</p>

<p>However, the hydrodynamics of lubricant-infused surfaces is 'not yet fully understood', the team say. </p>

<p>The group looked at the average speed of a cargo ship with realistic material properties and simulated how it behaves under various lubrication setups</p>

<p>The experts, from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Pohang University of Science and Technology, looked at the average speed of a cargo ship with realistic material properties, such as the density and surface tension. </p>

<p>They then investigated how the size of the cavities in the special material and the thickness of their 'lids' affected the amount of drag on the vessel. </p>

<p>They found that for larger open areas, the lubricant spread more than it does with smaller open areas, leading to a more slippery surface. </p>

<p>Researchers believe a breakdown of the physics of different types of cavity will help implementation in real-life marine vehicles.</p>

<p>'If the present design parameters are adopted, the drag reduction rate will increase significantly,' said study author Hyung Jin Sung. </p>

<p>Because drag increases with speed, the faster the ship moves, the more fuel it requires to counteract the resulting resistance. </p>

<p>The physics behind the technique will therefore help save the planet by affecting how much fuel a ship needs. </p>

<p>It could help slash emissions of potentially harmful sulphur compounds and CO2 produced by exhausts that power propellers.   </p>

<p>The study has been published in Physics of Fluids.        </p>

<p> Fish secrete a type of mucus from their skin. </p>

<p>This slime coating is important because it provides protection against parasites and diseases, covers wounds to prevent infection and helps fish move through the water faster. </p>

<p>Some species release toxins in their slime which ward off attacking creatures while others use their slime to feed their young. </p>

<p>The mechanism of fish mucus drag reduction is one of the several adaptations to facilitate movement. </p>

<p>Seaweed also feels slimy to the touch because of a jelly-like layer on its surface. </p>

<p>This keeps the plants supple and prevents the seaweed from being damaged by the waves. </p>

<p>Researchers have already taken inspiration from sea life to overcome water resistance for man-made objects.  </p>
