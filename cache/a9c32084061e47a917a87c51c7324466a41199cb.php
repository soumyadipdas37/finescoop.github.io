<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thiago Silva has hit out at Paris Saint-Germain for the manner of his departure from the club this summer, admitting it was a 'situation that p****d me off'.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old was keen to extend his eight-year stay in Paris this summer but was not offered a contract extension by sporting director Leonardo.</p>

<p>He played on during the Champions League finale - taking PSG to their first final where they were agonisingly beaten by Bayern Munich - before completing a free transfer to Chelsea.</p>

<p>Thiago Silva waves goodbye to the PSG fans after a friendly against Celtic in July</p>

<p>The Brazilian defender lifted 23 trophies during a glittering eight-year stay in Paris</p>

<p>But he believes it was handled awkwardly and hastily after nearly a decade of service to the Ligue 1 club. </p>

<p>'It's a situation that p****d me off. I really didn't like the way it was conducted', he told France Football.</p>

<p>'Even if there was lockdown, things should have been done differently. </p>

<p>'I was in Brazil, in quarantine, when Leonardo called me to tell me that because of the pandemic and the difficulties ... [He pauses.] No, first, he asked me if I was OK to continue for two more months to compete in a possible Final 8. I told him yes. </p>

<p>Silva could not inspire PSG to Champions League glory in his final appearance last month</p>

<p>Silva slammed sporting director Leonardo for not offering him an extended contract</p>

<p>'But he told me that the club would not go beyond these two months. It would be two months and nothing else. It should have been done differently.'</p>

<p>Silva lifted a staggering 23 trophies at PSG and said: 'All my career at PSG, I gave the maximum, I never cheated.</p>

<p>'It's as if three matches in the final eight changed everything? And everything I had achieved in those eight years didn't matter anymore? It is not consistent. </p>

<p>'Leo did this in an awkward and hasty fashion. Not just with me by the way. I also think of Cavani who is the top scorer in the history of PSG. I say this so that the club progresses and does not make these kinds of mistakes in the future. ' </p>
