<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The job of Chancellor of the Exchequer is always one of the most difficult in Government, as I know from personal experience. </p>

<p>During my spell at the Treasury in the early 1990s, I had to grapple with a series of momentous problems – the advent of recession, rising inflation and the impact of Black Wednesday, when Britain left the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. </p>

<p>Rishi Sunak has faced a bigger challenge than any other modern peacetime Chancellor. </p>

<p>He took office only in February, yet almost immediately was confronted by the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. </p>

<p>In response, he has shown boldness and creativity, adopting imaginative measures such as his furlough job protection scheme and the Eat Out to Help Out initiative. </p>

<p>Rishi Sunak has faced a bigger challenge than any other modern peacetime Chancellor, says Norman Lamont</p>

<p>Implementing such policies required courage and verve, but the bill for them is heavy. For the first time in history, Britain’s national debt has passed the £2trillion mark. </p>

<p>The ratio of Government debt to GDP is now over 100 per cent and rising. Borrowing for this year is expected to reach over £330billion. </p>

<p>Economic recovery is not assured, despite claims from the Bank of England that a rapid, V-shaped revival is under way. </p>

<p>The housing market and car sales are performing well, but travel, tourism, high street retailing, commercial property and the hospitality trade are struggling. </p>

<p>Some companies are now borrowing significant sums just to survive, adding to the mountain of corporate debt. </p>

<p>And the prospect of a massive hike in unemployment looms, with the furlough scheme due to close at the end of next month. </p>

<p>Lengthening dole queues will drive up the costs of the welfare system, drag down the economy and undermine consumer confidence. </p>

<p>The Eat Out to Help Out initiative, which ended yesterday, showed Mr Sunak's boldness and creativity</p>

<p>So what should be done? The first task for the Government is to restore normality by easing the Covid restrictions. </p>

<p>Commerce was brought to a shuddering halt by official edict in order to halt the spread of the virus. </p>

<p>Now, to fire up our economy, we must return to work and re-open the offices, schools, visitor attractions and universities. </p>

<p>Excessive caution will destroy livelihoods. </p>

<p>But even if prosperity begins to return, that still leaves the problem of ballooning debt. </p>

<p>There is no magic money tree that can wish it away. In the medium-term, it is inevitable that the Government will have to impose a degree of fiscal tightening through either expenditure cuts, tax rises or, more probably, a combination of both.</p>

<p>There has been speculation that Mr Sunak may use his forthcoming Budget to bring in tax rises worth £30billion, including a rise in corporation tax from 19 to 24 per cent; a reform of capital gains tax; and an increase in fuel duty. </p>

<p>I do not think, however, it is necessary or desirable to introduce anything like such a drastic package this year. </p>

<p>Given the fragility of the economy, all these measures carry the serious risk of choking off the recovery and hurting businesses just at the moment they need support. </p>

<p>Instead of implementing a tough programme now, the Chancellor could use his Budget to outline fiscal measures that would take effect in two or three years. </p>

<p>In doing so, it would be preferable to put the emphasis on expenditure cuts rather than tax rises, since the latter diminish incentives for enterprise. </p>

<p>Excessive caution will destroy livelihoods, warns Norman Lamont, as the City of London remained also deserted on Monday</p>

<p>As Winston Churchill (who was chancellor in the 1920s) once put it: ‘For a nation to try and tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handles.’ </p>

<p>Among the possible spending reductions would be strict new limits on pay rises in the public sector and cuts to the £107billion HS2 rail project. </p>

<p>There could also be a cut in the foreign aid budget, on which Whitehall is legally required to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP. </p>

<p>This figure is purely arbitrary, and in the post-Covid world, we need bold thinking. </p>

<p>Similarly, the triple lock on pensions may have to be reviewed. </p>

<p>Given the Tory promises to keep this arrangement – whereby the state payment is annually increased by 2.5 per cent, the level of wage growth or inflation, whichever is the highest – such a move would be hard. </p>

<p>However, it is difficult to justify such large increases for pensioners when much of the population has seen their living standards fall. </p>

<p>Some Conservative MPs are calling for a cut in VAT to boost consumer spending, but I fear that such a step would be too expensive and achieve little. </p>

<p>A better policy might be a temporary reduction in the rate of employers’ national insurance, which would encourage them to retain or recruit staff. </p>

<p>We are now living in circumstances that no one could have predicted. </p>

<p>Again, Churchill put it best: ‘If we do not face reality, reality is going to face us.’</p>
