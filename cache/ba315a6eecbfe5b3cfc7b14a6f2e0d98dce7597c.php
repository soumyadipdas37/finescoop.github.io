<p>As a guest on the new Drew Barrymore Show, actress Reese Witherspoon allowed that she was 'terrified' of becoming a mother at a young age back in 1999.</p>

<p>Witherspoon, 44, chatted with Barrymore, 45, on the program's second day, as host Drew praised the Walk The Line actress about her ability to handle both a burgeoning film career and two young children at home.  </p>

<p>On motherhood: As a guest on the new Drew Barrymore Show, actress Reese Witherspoon allowed that she was 'terrified' of becoming a mother at a young age back in 1999</p>

<p>'How did you balance work and motherhood at that point?' Drew, who is mom to daughters Olive, seven, and Frankie, six, with ex-husband Will Kopelman, asked. 'Because I was just trying to balance work!' </p>

<p>Witherspoon, who shares daughter Ava, 21, and son Deacon, 16, with ex Ryan Phillippe, told Drew: 'I got pregnant when I was 22 years old. And I didn't know how to balance work and motherhood. You just do it, you know?'</p>

<p>At the time, Reese was somewhat of an indie darling, having cut her teeth on successful fare such as Election in 1999 along with Cruel Intentions in the same year.</p>

<p>Reese told Drew: 'I got pregnant when I was 22 years old. And I didn't know how to balance work and motherhood. You just do it, you know?'</p>

<p>Of that time, Witherspoon recalled: 'I'd made movies but I hadn't, you know, established myself as someone who could demand that it shoot close to my kids' school or, you know, I didn't have any real power, leverage within my industry.  </p>

<p>'I was just like every other mom trying to figure it out—and dad out there, and partner, and grandparent who's raising a child,' she continued.</p>

<p>It wasn't until 2001's Legally Blonde when she hit it big, followed of course by her Best Actress Oscar win for 2005's Walk The Line opposite Joaquin Phoenix. </p>

<p>Witherspoon recalled: 'I'd made movies but I hadn't, you know, established myself as someone who could demand that it shoot close to my kids' school or, you know, I didn't have any real power, leverage within my industry'; seen with baby Ava and ex-husband Ryan Phillippe, 2000</p>

<p>Since then, Reese has gone on to demand 'real power [and] leverage' within her industry, with successful projects like Wild, Big Little Lies, The Morning Show and Little Fires Everywhere. </p>

<p>The actress also had a third child in 2012, Tennessee James, with her talent agent husband Jim Toth.</p>

<p>During their chat, Drew fondly remembered welcoming Reese to her wedding in 2012, when they were both pregnant – Drew with her first child Olive.</p>

<p>'We were bumping bellies, the only two sober chicks there,' Drew happily remembered.</p>

<p>And of the sacrifices of being a mom, Witherspoon only had amazing things to say. </p>

<p>'You take the food out of your mouth, the clothes off your back, the sleep out of your life,' she told her friend Barrymore. </p>

<p>'But every bit of it—every bit of that sacrifice is truly worth it because you feel like, that's what makes me wake up on a Sunday. It's not movies or my job, it's my kids.'</p>
