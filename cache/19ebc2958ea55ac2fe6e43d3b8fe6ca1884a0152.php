<p>Former soap star Shobna, 53, from Oldham, appeared on Lorraine today, where she opened up about her mother Asha, who passed away in November 2019</p>

<p>'It's really interesting,' she said. 'Once you're sitting in a room with someone with dementia they remember different things that perhaps you didn’t know as people. </p>

<p>'Instead of seeing your mum, you see a woman and I was fascinated. It was as if she was unlocking file of her past. They don't tell you everything, they just give you random moments.' </p>

<p>The actress played Sunita Alahan in Coronation Street between 2001 and 2006, returning to the popular role between 2009 and 2013. </p>

<p>Shobna had named her on-screen daughter, played by Tanisha Gorey, after her mother, and told that it was a 'happy coincidence' that would eventually spark a memory to her mother. </p>

<p>Shobna had named her on-screen daughter, played by Tanisha Gorey (pictured) , after her mother, and told that it was a 'happy coincidence' that would eventually bring back a memory to her mother</p>

<p>'We would watch television when I was caring for her', she told, 'And she would recognise Asha and I would talk [to her] about naming my TV daughter after her and it helped. </p>

<p>'Mum was diagnosed in 2017 and it was sort of a happy coincidence that helped my mum remember, I was gifted that memory.' </p>

<p>Shobna insisted she feels 'really lucky' to have discovered so much about her mother, and found comfort in 're-imagining her' following her death. </p>

<p>'I was really lucky to sort of discover her', said Shobna, 'And she died in November in the loss and the grief of losing her, I found a lot of comfort in re-imagining her and filing in all the gaps, because you don't really see your parents as people.' </p>

<p>Shobna told host Lorraine Kelly (pictured) she feels 'really lucky' to have discovered so much about her mother, and found comfort in 're-imagining her' following her death</p>

<p>She added that her mother would collect 'everything' printed in the press about her daughter' </p>

<p>'She collected all my press cuttings and she would always collect everything for her three children,' she explained. 'But she collected everything - even thumbnails in cross words if I happened to be a clue.' </p>

<p>Last year the actress revealed her mum had lost her fight with the degenerative disease and had died 'peacefully in her sleep'. </p>

<p>She said via Instagram she was 'completely heartbroken' and 'still processing' the devastating news, and she struggles to live without her 'amazing' mother. </p>

<p>'Life is different': Admitting that her life is 'now changed', the actress went on to reveal that she was 'completely heartbroken' and 'still processing' the devastating news</p>

<p>In her heartbreaking caption, Shobna wrote: 'Our beautiful mum passed away, a few weeks ago, peacefully in her sleep. Still processing, these days are hard. She was our lynchpin connecting us as a family. </p>

<p>'Our lives are changed and life is very different now. She did her very best and in the last 25 years I grew to know her as a person and the amazing woman that was our mum, and for that circumstance and time I am truly grateful. </p>

<p> 'She taught me such a lot ... but not how to live without her. Completely heartbroken.'</p>
