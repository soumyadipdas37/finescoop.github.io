<p>Sarah Louise, 43, from Nottingham, was shopping with daughter Mara at a Long Eaton branch on Sunday when they spotted the 'casual stereotyping'.</p>

<p>She has accused the retailer of 'propagating nonsense' with the navy blue £3.50 masks, which feature a football design. </p>

<p>Tesco has been approached for comment. </p>

<p>Sarah Louise, 43, has accused supermarket Tesco of 'stereotyping' children after her daughter asked why blue football themed face covering were labelled as 'boys' masks </p>

<p>Full-time carer Sarah took to Facebook to complain to Tesco, after Mara urged her to raise the issue with the retailer.</p>

<p>She posted a snap of the product this morning and said: 'I was in your shop in Long Eaton at the weekend with my family and we spotted these 'boys' face masks at the till.</p>

<p>'My daughter wondered what made them suitable for her brother, but not for her. I had no good answer to give her and wondered if you could help.'</p>

<p>Sarah explained how the family came across the item at the end of the till.</p>

<p>Sarah accused the retailer of 'propagating nonsense' with the £3.50 masks, which feature a football design</p>

<p>The supermarket giant also offers pink face masks and coverings, labelled as 'girls' at some of their stores</p>

<p>The product in question is a pack of three face masks in a dark blue colour, featuring a football logo.</p>

<p>The packaging specifically states that the item is for boys aged four to eight years old.</p>

<p>Speaking today, she said: 'I commented on it, and my daughter raised her eyes and asked, "Why not for girls?"</p>

<p>'She knew it was just a stereotype, which is a bit sad at nine-years-old.</p>

<p>Sarah was shopping with daughter Mara at a Long Eaton branch, pictured, on Sunday when they spotted the 'casual stereotyping' took to Facebook to complain</p>

<p>'I think casual stereotyping like this is just a small reflection of a bigger problem.</p>

<p>'It reinforces perceptions that certain sports and occupations are for girls and others are for boys.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I felt nothing overwhelming after seeing it, just a bit irritated and sad to see a large brand, who should know better, propagating this nonsense.</p>

<p>'No-one really put much thought into it, it wasn't malicious, but I think it's important to challenge these sorts of stereotypes.'   </p>
