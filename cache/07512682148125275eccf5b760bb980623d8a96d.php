<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The distraught father of a woman allegedly killed by a top Russian military historian has told a murder trial how he spent two days identifying his daughter from her dismembered body parts. </p>

<p>Anastasia Yeschenko, 24, was shot dead and her corpse was cut to pieces by renowned Napoleon expert Oleg Sokolov, prosecutors say. </p>

<p>The academic, 64 - who liked to dress as the French general and emperor - dumped his student's body parts in a river in St Petersburg, it is alleged. </p>

<p>The court also heard evidence that the couple had quarreled shortly before her death in November last year. </p>

<p>Suspect: Renowned Russian historian Oleg Sokolov, pictured in court in St Petersburg last week, is accused of murdering his student lover </p>

<p>Anastasia's father Oleg Yeschenko told the trial about the macabre procedure when he was forced to identify the remains pulled from the Moika River.   </p>

<p>'On 11 and 12 November I identified the head, arm and torso of my daughter,' he testified.</p>

<p>The victim's mother Galina said she knew her daughter was in a 'romantic relationship' with Sokolov but said the student had 'hesitated' about marrying the historian, her university teacher.</p>

<p>The mother earlier testified that Anastasia was on the point of dumping him.</p>

<p>'She had a fight with Sokolov because she wanted to go to a friend's birthday. He hit her and called her ungrateful,' she told the court.</p>

<p>A neighbour of Sokolov testified how she overheard the pair in a shouting match on the night the PhD student was killed.</p>

<p>Angelina Volskaya, 24, said she heard the couple's final quarrel through the thin wall of her apartment.</p>

<p>'I heard Yeshchenko loudly say: 'Don't touch me, please'.</p>

<p>Sokolov ranted at his lover and there was the sound of crashing furniture, the court was told. .</p>

<p>'I heard at least five blows, after each the girl screamed and asked her not to touch her,' the witness said. </p>

<p>'Then she said, "Okay, I'm not going anywhere, you're not a bastard, just don't touch me." Then I heard her loud screeching…two or three times.'</p>

<p>Rescuers examine the Moika River where the remains were found and where Sokolov was hauled out of the water after allegedly disposing of the body parts </p>

<p>The row was on the night that the student died, it was later established.</p>

<p>Forensic expert Viktor Vasilenko, said: 'The death happened four or five days before the body parts were found.'</p>

<p>Sokolov had first tried to suffocate her 'but this was not the cause of death'. 'Four shots were fired, three of them penetrating,' he said.</p>

<p>'The shots were fired in a short period of time and from a close distance of between 15 centimetres to one and a half metres….</p>

<p>'The person who dismembered the body did not know the human anatomy well.'</p>

<p>Sokolov, a recipient of France's Legion of Honour, is accused of shooting and dismembering Yeschenko with whom he had taken part in re-enactments of Napoleon's life.</p>

<p>The academic - who liked to dress as the French general and emperor - is pictured at a re-enactment of an 1812 battle </p>

<p>The court will later hear the professor's defence.</p>

<p>He won the right for his lawyers to have access to messages on his and his lover's smartphones.</p>

<p>This followed an earlier court session in which he ranted from the dock: 'I insist this evidence is considered openly.'</p>

<p>The messages would show 'the terrifying things she was writing to me' and 'monstrous insults' to his children from previous relationships.</p>

<p>'People must see this,' he stormed, prompting the judge to order him: 'Sokolov, calm down.'</p>

<p>His rant went on, flailing his arms and wildly wagging his finger, as he claimed: 'It's disgusting, vile, and only by knowing this can people understand what has happened.' </p>
