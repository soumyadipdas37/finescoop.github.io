<p>The woman ran onto the stage during an international motor show in Beijing on Saturday after she claimed she had been mistreated by her employer.</p>

<p>Footage shows the crying model standing next to a display vehicle from Chinese automotive brand Geely as she told the crowd not to buy the cars.</p>

<p>A Chinese model was filmed wrapped in a black sheet and carried off the stage by a dozen security guards after she urged people to avoid buying the cars she was meant to promote</p>

<p>Chinese media initially reported that the woman was a Geely owner. But a senior executive from the Chinese motor company denied the claim, adding that she was a car model hired by an event management company.</p>

<p>The incident sparked outrage on Chinese social media after footage of the woman being tackled and carried off the stage was widely shared over the weekend.</p>

<p>The woman is seen in the clip crying on the stage as she claimed she had been treated unfairly by her employer who did not care about her.</p>

<p>She can be heard shouting at the crowd in the video: ‘Do you guys think you would dare to buy this car,’ hinting that the vehicles were unreliable.</p>

<p>After a few staff members failed to drag the car model off the stage, the woman was then wrapped in a giant black sheet.</p>

<p>She was screaming ‘don’t touch me’ and ‘let me go’ as she was carried off the stage by a group of security guards.</p>

<p>It was initially reported that the woman was a Geely owner. But a top official from the Chinese motor company denied the claim and said that car model was hired by the eventcompany</p>

<p>Yang Xueliang, the vice president of Geely, later said in a social media post that the auto show girl had been employed by another company which was hosting the motor event.</p>

<p>He also attached a formal apology letter issued by the event management company, which said the car model had been ‘unsatisfied about some adjustment at work’ and ‘lost control of her emotions’.</p>

<p>‘[She] ran onto the stage from the back, hitting the display vehicle and attacking the staff members who were trying to restrain her,’ the statement read.</p>

<p>‘To prevent the situation from worsening and the woman from being injured, our security staff covered her in a sheet, removed her and called police.’ the company added.</p>

<p>The woman is said to have reached an agreement with her employer at the police station.</p>
