<p>Mick's marriage split followed a tough six months for the three-time world champion, in which he fought off a shark while competing in South Africa, followed shortly afterwards by the sudden death of his brother Peter in late 2015. </p>

<p>It was the second death he'd experienced in his immediate family after his older brother Sean died in a car accident in 1998.</p>

<p>'That was the one that just floored me. I was like 'what else? What else can be taken in a year?' At the end of 2015, I just hit rock bottom,' he told 60 Minutes on Sunday night. </p>
