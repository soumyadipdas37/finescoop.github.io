<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jobless Australians are turning down roles on an idyllic island resort offering cheap food and free rent at multi million-dollar venues.</p>

<p>The dream jobs are being offered by Discovery Parks in some of Australia's most sought-after locations.</p>

<p>Destinations include Byron Bay and Forster in northern New South Wales, Rottnest Island in Western Australia, and Lake Bonney in South Australia.</p>

<p>Despite the picturesque beaches and spectacular sunsets at both locations, resort bosses say they've only had international and interstate applicants - many have been rejected due to border closures.</p>

<p>Forster (pictured) is another location in northern New South Wales looking for workers</p>

<p>The Rottnest Island resort, 34km off the coast of Perth, is only able to accept applicants from Western Australia due to the state's closed borders.</p>

<p>But resorts at Byron Bay, Forster and Lake Bonney are open to residents from other states.</p>

<p>Immediate opportunities are available for chefs, kitchen hands, housekeepers and waiters who can earn up to $35 an hour with free or heavily discounted meals, accommodation and ferry passes.</p>

<p>Discovery Parks founder and chief executive Grant Wilckens told Daily Mail Australia that applicants could be offered as job 'we soon as they fill out the paper work'.</p>

<p>The company has even offered to pay for interstate applicants to quarantine in hotels.</p>

<p>'I've been running this business for 17 years and I've never seen a shortage like this,' he said.  </p>

<p>'Usually we have people from overseas filling these roles, but with the pandemic, Australians just aren't applying.'</p>

<p>Mr Wilckens explained that while he believes the JobSeeker and JobKeeper welfare benefits were a 'fantastic' way to help people during business closures, but added 'we need to be encouraging people back into the work force'. </p>

<p>'We've got free accommodation across most of our network, and some are in regional places like Byron and Rottnest, subsidies on food, and then subsidies on ferries and transport as well.'</p>

<p>MasterChef Australia star and Pinky's Beach Club executive chef Karl Wulf (pictured) fears he won't have any workers when the resort reopens in seven days</p>

<p>He acknowledged that some potential workers might be concerned about COVID-19, but explained the company records customers' phone numbers and has a plan in place to ensure the safety of employees and patrons.</p>

<p>Mr Wilckens said the company is looking for qualified chefs with experience to work along side Wulf, but all other staff don't need experience.</p>

<p>'All you need is a positive attitude and we can teach you the skills.'</p>

<p>'A lot of 18-year-old's want to take gap years overseas, but they can't do that this year, so why not see some beautiful parts of the country?'</p>
