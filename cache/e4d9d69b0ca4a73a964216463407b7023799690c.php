<p>The 73-year-old business magnate landed in Sydney on Thursday morning and will start filming the long-running reality show once he's completed 14 days in quarantine. </p>

<p>Lord Sugar, who has appeared on 15 seasons of the hit show in the UK, will eliminate the celebrities with his signature catchphrase 'you're fired'. </p>

<p>More than 27,000 Australians stranded overseas are waiting to return, but with a weekly cap of 4,000 incoming passengers to Australia, airlines have warned they won't be able to get everyone home in time for Christmas.</p>

<p>Lord Sugar took to Twitter to share his excitement at touching down in Sydney this morning. </p>

<p>But the billionaire, known for his no-nonsense approach to business, was quickly met with backlash for taking up a seat on one of the few flights coming to Australia. </p>

<p>The Lord, who has appeared on 15 seasons of the hit show in the UK, will eliminate the celebrities with his signature catchphrase 'you're fired'</p>

<p>'25k Aussies stranded abroad, and you take up a spot on a flight. Daughter can't travel across States for her Dad's funeral but you're allowed in. All for a tired TV show to laugh at z list celebs,' one man wrote. </p>

<p>'Oz citizens and residents separated from partners, kids, jobs, lives can just jump on flights can they?! They are allowed in, but their own govt is hardly welcoming them to.'</p>

<p>'Umm confused, I thought only Australian nationals or permanent residents are currently allowed to return into the country?' said another.  </p>

<p>But some Australians sided with Lord Sugar, saying his travels here are justified for legitimate work. </p>

<p>'Unbelievable some of the comments on here. The man has a self made fortune. Not won, not inherited. All earned through hard work. If he wants to fly to Australia, pay for it, &amp; recognise good service then why shouldn’t he? Mental how some people are so bitter,' one man tweeted. </p>

<p>'So glad u enjoyed it x and u have worked hard for ur money and success !! That’s what’s wrong with people, they don’t like to see others reaping the benefits of their hard work,' said another.  </p>

<p>It comes as Scott Morrison insists thousands more stranded Australians will re-enter the country each week, pressuring the states to boost capacities in hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>The prime minister is adamant the weekly cap on international arrivals will be increased by 2,000 places.</p>

<p>'The planes will land with people on them and they'll be arriving,' he told reporters on Thursday. 'It's a decision, it's not a proposal.'</p>

<p>Mr Morrison even nominated how many more returning travellers each state would take.</p>

<p>He said NSW, Western Australia and Queensland would all accept an extra 500 people each week.</p>

<p>Other jurisdictions are expected to take the rest.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison's declaration puts him on a collision course with the premiers and chief ministers ahead of a national cabinet meeting on Friday.</p>

<p>The states and territories have not formally agreed to boost hotel quarantine, so the deal is not done yet.</p>

<p>The prime minister has rejected Labor's calls to bring thousands of people in on air force planes.</p>

<p>He has also pushed back against suggestions the Commonwealth should re-establish federal quarantine facilities, as it did early in the pandemic to house people returning from China and Japan.</p>

<p>The government argues there are tens of thousands of empty hotel rooms that can be used for quarantine.</p>

<p>More than 27,000 Australians stranded overseas are waiting to return home </p>

<p>Labor leader Anthony Albanese urged the prime minister to ensure people aren't being forced into paying exorbitant prices to return home.</p>

<p>'Access to Australia shouldn't be on the basis that you are rich enough to pay five figures to get on a plane,' he told reporters in Sydney.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison has also softened his language dramatically on Queensland's popular border closures.</p>

<p>After spending months criticising the restrictions, the prime minister now says Queensland and others must bring down their borders eventually.</p>

<p>'I have never said they had to bring them down immediately,' Mr Morrison said.</p>

<p>'I have just said we have got to have sensible and fair exemption systems and not have double standards and explain what we are doing.'</p>

<p>Qantas boss Alan Joyce is pleading with the states to reopen domestic borders.</p>

<p>'Europeans have been fighting themselves for thousands of years but they have somehow managed to agree to keep borders open,' he said.</p>

<p>But Mr Joyce won't be rethinking his decision to scrap all international flights until mid-next year, even to rescue Australians stuck overseas.</p>

<p>'The economics don't work,' he said.</p>

<p>Australia's national panel of medical experts has proposed new definitions for coronavirus zones and hotspots in a bid to reopen state borders.</p>

<p>National cabinet was expected to discuss the definitions on Friday, but that is no longer the case.</p>

<p>The prime minister believes the proposed definitions are far too tough.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted the NSW Premier, the Nine Network and Lord Sugar's office for comment.  </p>
