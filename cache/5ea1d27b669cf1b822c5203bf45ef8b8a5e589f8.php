<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lyon are hoping for a dream reunion with former striker Karim Benzema, according to sporting director Juninho.</p>

<p>The Real Madrid star began his career with the French outfit but left for the Bernabeu in 2009 and has since played more than 500 games for Los Blancos in a sparkling career delivering nine major trophies. </p>

<p>But his boyhood club have now pleaded with the 32-year-old to end his playing days at the Stade de Gerland as they brace for interest in their talisman Memphis Depay from Barcelona.  </p>

<p>Lyon want to re-sign Karim Benzema from Real Madrid, according to club chief Juninho </p>

<p>Juninho said it was the club's 'dream' to bring him back to Lyon and benefit from his experience</p>

<p>Lyon face the possibility of losing club captain Memphis Depay to Barcelona this summer</p>

<p>Juninho, a club legend with Lyon, said it was their 'dream' for Benzema to become 'our leader and scorer' and said his experience would be vital. </p>

<p>'It is our dream that Karim ends with us,' he said, as reported by the Sun.</p>

<p>'It is the dream of everyone at Lyon, to bring him two seasons to play the Champions League and to be our leader and scorer.</p>

<p>Benzema started his career with Lyon and helped the club win the Ligue 1 title four times </p>

<p>'We need your experience and it would help us win games.'</p>

<p>Their current captain Depay is being heavily linked with a switch to the Catalan outfit, where he would link up with his Holland boss Ronald Koeman.</p>

<p>The Dutch star has been instrumental for Lyon during his 137 appearances for the club. He has scored 57 goals and has become one of their main attacking threats. </p>

<p>Even at 32, he continues to show his quality at the top level as he netted 27 times this season</p>

<p>If he does end up joining Barcelona, they will need a replacement - and Benzema remains one of the most reliable goalscorers in the game. </p>

<p>Despite edging into his thirties, the Frenchman has still proven to be a reliable, top level striker as he netted 27 goals in 48 games for Zinedine's Zidane's men last season, helping them to the LaLiga title.</p>

<p>When he was last at Lyon, he was used to winning trophies. He won four Ligue 1 titles and the French Cup during his time with the club and his continued experience of silverware would be of huge benefit. </p>
