<p>In her Instagram Story posts, Demi appeared to passionately challenge the validity of the past tweets and she went as far as to urge 'tabloids' to write about 'more important sh*t.' </p>

<p>'Secondly, don't y'all have more important s**t to write about in 2020??? I challenge any tabloid that dares to type my name to mention Breonna Taylor and the face that her murderers still haven't been arrested. WRITE ABOUT THAT,' she wrote </p>

<p>Selena is, clearly, a touchy subject for Demi, being that the pair have endured a rocky friendship since rising to fame on Disney Channel in the mid-2000s.</p>

<p>Lovato opened up about their crumbling friendship in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in May.</p>

<p>'When you grow up with somebody, you're always going to have love for them. But I'm not friends with her, so it felt….I will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best,' she explained. </p>
