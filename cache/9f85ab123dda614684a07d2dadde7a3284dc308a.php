<p>A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end. </p>

<p>'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic. </p>

<p>'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time. </p>
