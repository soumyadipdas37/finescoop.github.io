<p>'We trust each other so much!' The media personality recently revealed she and personal trainer beau Kris Boyson, 31, moved in together after their first date</p>

<p>Katie Price's ex told new! magazine: 'We've spent every single day together practically since we met. You wouldn't lock down with someone for 100 days if it was a showmance.' </p>

<p>Bianca and Kris were introduced to each other three years ago when he provided her with healthy meals in preparation of a charity fight, which got cancelled when her opponent, his ex Katie Price, pulled out.</p>
