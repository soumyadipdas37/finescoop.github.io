<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman left fighting for her life after a doctor mistakenly dismissed cancerous lumps on her legs and feet as fat has embarked on a 'bucket list' holiday. </p>

<p>Gemma Malins, 28, was diagnosed with stage-four metastatic melanoma in October last year.</p>

<p>The New Zealand woman, who was studying to be an early childhood teacher, hasn't been responding to treatment for the aggressive cancer that has spread to her brain and lungs.   </p>

<p>Many of the tumours aren't shrinking and some have even grown in size. </p>

<p>Ms Malins and her partner Brandon, 21, are now focusing on ticking items off of her bucket list.</p>

<p>The couple flew to Queenstown from Auckland on September 7 to celebrate both of their birthdays in 'holiday of a lifetime', Stuff reported.</p>

<p>The plans were temporarily in jeopardy after Auckland was forced into a coronavirus lockdown last month.</p>

<p>However, after only missing two days of their trip, the couple were able to re-book their cancelled flights and accommodation and fly to Queenstown. </p>

<p>They participated in activities such as horse riding, a helicopter ride, the luge and a gondola trip.</p>

<p>The newlyweds even got to have dinner with the woman who made everything possible for them to go on the trip.</p>

<p>Ms Malins ended up in hospital during one day of their trip when she began to feel ill. </p>

<p>She said she was just taking things one step at a time and couldn't do it without her husband at her side.</p>

<p>The pair fast-tracked their wedding plans after getting the shattering diagnosis.</p>

<p>The couple tied the knot in a small beach ceremony in December 2019 after two weeks of planning. </p>

<p>Ms Malins described it as the most 'perfect day'. </p>

<p>'We fast tracked the wedding as we just didn't know what the future held, we still don't,' she said. </p>

<p>She said she was just taking things one step at a time and couldn't do it without her husband at her side </p>

<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia in July, she shared how she has been left fuming because she first raised her concerns about the lumps with her GP a year earlier.</p>

<p>She saw a doctor who said the lumps on her legs were lipoma, a fatty tissue which can develop under the skin as people age. </p>

<p>The benign growths are rarely harmful But as the growths spread throughout her body, Ms Malins grew concerned. </p>

<p>She went to a new GP who broke the news that the lumps could be more serious. </p>

<p>She and her partner Brandon, 21, fast-tracked their wedding plans after getting the shattering diagnosis</p>

<p>Brandon, 20, quit his job as a beekeeper to be by her side throughout the treatment (Pictured: The couple on their wedding day last year)</p>

<p>Stage 4 melanoma means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, brain, or other organs and tissue. </p>

<p>It may have also spread to lymph nodes that are a good distance from the original tumor. As such, stage 4 melanoma is often hard to cure with current treatments. </p>

<p>But she had to endure another three-month wait before she saw a specialist who confirmed the cancer diagnosis. </p>

<p>'It was such a shock at the time I actually couldn't even process it,' Ms Malins said. 'It changed our whole lives dramatically.</p>

<p>'It's frightening. I'm scared about dying all the time. </p>

<p>'We had planned to have children, we have so much baby stuff that we've collected up but now we can't even think about that.' </p>

<p>Ms Malins is now undergoing a type of immunotherapy called Keytruda, with a two-year plan in place.  </p>

<p>Her husband has given up his beekeeping job to care for his wife while she fights for her life. </p>

<p>'He's been by my side for every treatment and every good and bad day,' she said.</p>

<p>'My husband has been a soldier.' </p>

<p>They have started a Givealittle page to raise money for their adventures.  </p>
