<p>Appearing on Loose Women today, Paris told she and her husband are 'on the fence' about letting their oldest daughter Venezuela go to secondary school</p>

<p>'She hasn’t got the place as of yet,' said Paris. 'She's got to go through the tests. I'm not taking that opportunity away from her, we're on the fence of letting her go.' </p>

<p>When quizzed by host Janet Street Porter about how her parents would educate her if she wanted to be a doctor or surgeon, she went on: 'If she wants to become any of those things, only time will tell. </p>

<p>'I think kids, if it's something they want, they can go back and get it. I did this, I ended all school at 11 and when I got to 15 I said I wanted to do a beauty therapy course. </p>

<p>'I learned how to run a business and accounting and mortgaging and even though I lost out on education, I had that drive and determination.' </p>

<p>The mother went on to insist that her children can 'grow up and do what they want', but says the traveler culture means 'staying near the family'. </p>

<p>'The children will grow up and do what they want', said Paris, 'We have the tradition where you stay near the family, that's our culture, that's what we do. But they will make their own decision, we live in a modern society there's no set law.'  </p>

<p>However Tyson has previously revealed that he'd like his children to remain in full-time education, with Paris explaining: 'We disagree.' </p>

<p>'We have these opinions where he says "I’ve done what I’ve done by not following precedent", and I followed the old fashioned way. </p>

<p>Paris revealed and while she wouldn't take the opportunity to continue education away from her daughter, she feels 'if it's something she wants' Venezuela can 'go back'</p>

<p>'I want to instill that history into my kids and keep the old fashioned way of our background.' </p>

<p>She added: 'We have money and fame and glory, but we're trying to keep our roots.' </p>

<p>Their differences were also revealed earlier this year in ITV documentary Tyson Fury: The Gypsy King, where Paris told she wants her children to be raised as she did, while her husband described parents who stop their children from going to school as 'dream killers'.</p>

<p>The heavyweight then exclaimed: 'Do you think you live a traveller's lifestyle? Because I don't. I think you live like a footballers' wife.'</p>

<p>The couple met at a wedding when Paris was 15 and Tyson was 17, but didn’t start dating until after being re-introduced a year later after Paris’ 16th birthday</p>

<p>In 2008, Tyson and Paris got married in Doncaster and will mark their 12th wedding anniversary next month  </p>

<p>The couple met at a wedding when Paris was 15 and Tyson was 17, but didn’t start dating until after being re-introduced a year later after Paris’ 16th birthday. </p>

<p>In 2008, Tyson and Paris got married in Doncaster and will have been married for 12 years next month.  </p>

<p>Speaking of their blossoming relationship, Paris told: 'Tyson lived in Manchester and I lived in Doncaster, about 100 miles away, and every spare moment he had he would drive through. </p>

<p>'We'd go on picnics or to the cinema or for walks and he'd spend all week boxing training or earning money and on a weekend he would come and see me.' </p>

<p>Paris revealed that before becoming a boxing champion, her husband was 'quieter', and that she would encourage him to come out of his shell. </p>

<p>'Tyson was always more stand back a bit', she admitted, 'He was confident in his boxing, but he was quieter and he was a follow along. He would stand funny and I'd say "Stand tall, why are you being shy" and I created the monster that is Tyson Fury today.'  </p>
