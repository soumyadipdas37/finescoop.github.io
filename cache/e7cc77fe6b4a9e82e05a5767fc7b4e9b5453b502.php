<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Adrian Chiles has revealed that he has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and has been prescribed amphetamines.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the former One Show and Match of the Day 2 host, 53, said that he first suspected he had ADD four years ago - but didn't bother to find out more after being handed a bill for £1,400 by a private doctor.</p>

<p>He said, however, that he eventually decided to find out if he had the condition just over a year ago - and was promptly diagnosed, and prescribed amphetamines, which he said had 'changed his life for the better'.</p>

<p>The big reveal: Adrian Chiles has revealed that he has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and has been prescribed amphetamines</p>

<p>Speaking in the G2 supplement in The Guardian, he said: 'I've been getting treatment for attention deficit disorder (ADD) for more than a year now.'</p>

<p>He said his condition sometimes led to him unable to 'focus on anything' for more than 15 seconds - or led to him to focus exclusively on one thing 'for hours on end', adding: 'Both of which, oddly, are indicators of ADD.'</p>

<p>The star said that his condition meant he was always forgetting things and fidgeting as well as 'jabbering on (and) taking up new hobbies/obsessions all the time'.</p>

<p>He said he eventually went back to see the 'shrink' he saw four years ago, adding: 'So back I went to see the shrink who told me I should try some amphetamine-based medication as soon as I'd had an ECG to check my ticker was up to it.</p>

<p>Working on it: On Thursday, the former One Show and Match of the Day 2 host, 53, said that he first suspected he had ADD four years ago - but didn't bother to find out more after being handed a bill for £1,400 by a private doc</p>

<p>'It was, and from day one the pills worked brilliantly. My mood instantly lifted, and I was just better all around.</p>

<p>'The therapy was essential, too. Without it, the meds were so uplifting that I felt there was a risk they might just help me do a lot of stupid things faster - but with even more energy.'</p>

<p>He added: 'Who wouldn't feel better dropping an amphetamine every morning?'</p>

<p>Open and honest: He said, however, that he eventually decided to find out if he had the condition just over a year ago - and was promptly diagnosed, and prescribed amphetamines, which he said had 'changed his life for the better'</p>

<p>His details about his health come after Adrian revealed how counting the alcohol units he consumed saved him from a dangerous level of drinking.</p>

<p>The presenter said he has cut down on the booze significantly since keeping score, something he resisted doing for 'a long time'.</p>

<p>At one point the Radio 5 Live host admitted to drinking as many as 38 units in a day, before getting involved in the eye-opening BBC documentary Drinkers Like Me.</p>

<p>'I've definitely drunk much less. That came down to counting it. I resisted counting for a long time,' he told the Series Linked podcast on Thursday.</p>

<p>Keeping score: His details about his health come after Adrian revealed how counting the alcohol units he consumed saved him from a dangerous level of drinking</p>

<p>'The first time I ever counted was the first day of filming. West Brom were playing Liverpool then it was my mate's 40th birthday. I totted them all up in the morning, it was something like 38 units.</p>

<p>'And it didn't even feel a big drinking day to me. I thought, hang on a bit, this is dodgy.'</p>

<p>Adrian has previously been open about his relationship with alcohol, saying how he had had a pint every day of his life since he was 15.</p>

<p>'My drinking habits go back a long way. At university, if anyone I liked had said they didn't drink, well, I probably wouldn't have ended up being friends with them,' he said.  </p>

<p>And after being axed mid-contract from his high-pressure role on ITV's Daybreak in 2015, he began to self-medicate with alcohol before receiving a diagnosis of anxiety.</p>

<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural condition defined by inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.</p>

<p>It affects around five per cent of children in the US. Some 3.6 per cent of boys and 0.85 per cent of girls suffer in the UK. </p>

<p>Symptoms typically appear at an early age and become more noticeable as a child grows. These can also include:</p>

<p>Most cases are diagnosed between six and 12 years old. Adults can also suffer, but there is less research into this.</p>

<p>ADHD's exact cause is unclear but is thought to involve genetic mutations that affect a person's brain function and structure.</p>

<p>Premature babies and those with epilepsy or brain damage are more at risk. </p>

<p>ADHD is also linked to anxiety, depression, insomnia, Tourette's and epilepsy.  </p>

<p>There is no cure. </p>

<p>A combination of medication and therapy is usually recommended to relieve symptoms and make day-to-day life easier. </p>
