<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lewis Hamilton insists he is hoping for 'more of a fight' to challenge his position at the top of the F1 standings - and hinted the lack of competition may stem from Red Bull's mixed fortunes this year.</p>

<p>The Mercedes driver once again led the way from start to finish at the Belgian Grand Prix to move him a formidable 47 points clear of Max Verstappen, who crossed the line in third, in the overall standings. </p>

<p>The Red Bull duo of Verstappen and team-mate Alex Albon endured an inconsistent afternoon, with Albon once again finishing outside of the top four, leaving Hamilton to reflect on the lack of a challenge.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton is hoping for 'more of a fight' to challenge him at the top of the F1 standings</p>

<p>Hamilton says the lack of support for Red Bull's Max Verstappen (above) left him 'on his own'</p>

<p>Verstappen clinched his sixth consecutive podium at Spa and proved the only real threat to Hamilton's pole position, but the struggling Albon ended up trailing both Renault cars in sixth.</p>

<p>Red Bull appear to hold the second-fastest motor on the grid, largely due to Verstappen's heroics, and Albon's exploits further down the standings have undoubtedly taken a toll on the team's strategy.</p>

<p>And after Hamilton and Mercedes tightened their grip on another crown, the world champion admitted the lack of two Red Bull drivers pushing for top spot has only aided his dominance. </p>

<p>He told Sky F1: 'I think the Red Bulls have got a very good car. People downplay it but they've got a very, very strong car and Max is doing a great job with it.</p>

<p>Alex Albon, Verstappen's team-mate has finished in the top four just once so far this season</p>

<p>Albon ended up finishing sixth on a poor afternoon at the Belgian GP behind both Renault cars</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, both drivers aren't there like me and Valtteri are there. </p>

<p>'That makes it harder for them. I experienced it many years ago with McLaren and I was the driver that was always at the front and didn't have a team-mate backing up so you equally don't get the constructors' points, and then can't play with strategy on the cars they are racing against. </p>

<p>'So Red Bull have that and Max is sort of there on his own.</p>

<p>'Of course I really really want to have more of a fight, but that's not on me and I've just got to keep on what I'm doing.'</p>
