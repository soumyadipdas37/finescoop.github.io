<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This time, the watch buzzed and the goal at the Holte End was given, but Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder and his players left Villa Park feeling a similar sense of injustice.</p>

<p>At the ground where goal-line technology previously failed to do its job, United lost, hindered by the fact they were forced to play with 10 men for close to 80 minutes.</p>

<p>Captain John Egan was shown an early red card for denying Ollie Watkins a goalscoring opportunity, though United felt it was a case of six of one, half a dozen the other.</p>

<p>United then won a penalty – which they missed – in the 34th minute but Wilder was perplexed as to why Villa’s Matt Targett was not sent off to make it a fair fight.</p>

<p>One-season wonders? It is too early to write off the side that enthralled us all, but a second successive Premier League defeat ramps up the pressure ahead of facing Leeds next week.</p>

<p>Villa, meanwhile, were more than happy with this – an opening victory, a penalty save by Emiliano Martinez on his debut, and all on the day Tyrone Mings signed a new deal until 2024.</p>

<p>England manager Gareth Southgate was here to keep an eye on Mings, who was excellent in defence alongside Ezri Konsa, the man who headed home the winning goal in the 63rd minute.</p>

<p>Southgate also got to see what Jack Grealish can do against a compact defence.</p>

<p>After being fouled 167 times last year – a record for a Premier League in a single season – Grealish was given a rough welcome to the new campaign by John Lundstram.</p>

<p>Lundstram was booked for his robust challenge, then a red card followed for a team-mate.</p>

<p>A clearance by Mings turned into an inviting ball for Ollie Watkins to chase. Villa’s new £28million man looked set to latch on to it until last-man Egan impeded him.</p>

<p>Referee Graham Scott called a foul and held up a red card. Egan argued they were wrestling with each other, and it was certainly no Andreas Christensen rugby tackle on Sadio Mane.</p>

<p>VAR Mike Dean checked it, deciding Watkins would have got to the ball before goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale and that Egan had denied a goalscoring opportunity. Now United were up against it.</p>

<p>Wilder waited a while before making a change. After half an hour, David McGoldrick was sacrificed for Ethan Ampadu – a move which saw centre back Chris Basham move into midfield.</p>

<p>Anyone inside of United will tell you that Basham is best known for his extraordinary fitness levels. That was demonstrated in the 34th minute as a counter-attack led to a spot-kick.</p>

<p>A cross came in from Villa’s John McGinn and Basham headed the ball out of his box, prompting Oliver Burke to charge up the field. Fifteen seconds after his own clearance, Basham was collecting a Burke pass and being tripped by Targett.</p>

<p>Scott pointed to the penalty spot and produced a yellow. Wilder wanted to know why it was not red, to which he was told the referee had ruled the foul as accidental.</p>

<p>Lundstram took it and, with power and accuracy, aimed for the left corner. But Martinez, their new £17m signing, guessed right and made the save to the keep the scores level.</p>

<p>A theme was developing. Villa would cross from the left, and a United head would clear it. They were hitting Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, and were not having much luck.</p>

<p>Dean Smith was anxious, switching between overseeing the match in the stands and his technical area. His Villa side were finding it difficult to break down United’s disciplined defence in open play.</p>

<p>But in the 63rd minute, they were able to beat the visiting 10 men with a set piece.</p>

<p>A corner came in, Mings managed a flick-on, and Konsa headed into the bottom left corner.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Re-live Monday night's match as it happened</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Aston Villa clinch their first victory of the new Premier League season thanks to Ezri Konsa's header.</p>

<p>The defender looked to have suffered a hamstring strain in the seconds leading up to the second half and showed his perseverance to play on and score the winning goal. </p>

<p>Sheffield United showed resilience in defence after John Egan was controversially sent off for upending Ollie Watkins, but missed a prime opportunity to take the lead when Emi Martinez saved John Lundstram's penalty.</p>

<p>The Blades have now lost both of their league fixtures this term and will look to bounce back when they host Leeds United in a Yorkshire derby on Sunday. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Villa travel to Fulham next Monday after a League Cup encounter with Bristol City.</p>

<p>Watkins passes into Grealish who goes for goal from 12 yards. His low shot is diverted over the crossbar by a last-ditch block from Lundstram.</p>

<p>McGinn blocks Lundstram's cross and the ball bounces behind for a corner. </p>

<p>The resulting set piece sees Sander Berge swivel and volley over the crossbar.</p>

<p>Davis receives a pass from Ollie Watkins down the left flank and tries to return the favour by firing a low cross towards the former Brentford man. </p>

<p>Ramsdale gets down low to palm the ball away and Enda Stevens clears upfield.</p>

<p>John McGinn is shown a yellow card for tripping the advancing John Lundstram.</p>

<p>Grealish has come to the fore after Konsa's goal. The Villa man dribbles forward before shooting just past the base of Ramsdale's right-hand post.</p>

<p>Grealish dribbles with the ball through the left side of the penalty area before looking up and intelligently picking out Trezeguet with a chipped pass.</p>

<p>The Egyptian fluffs his lines and volleys into the turf and wide. </p>

<p>Seconds later, Watkins cuts in from the left and curls centimetres over the bar. That one looked to be heading for the top corner.</p>

<p>Sheffield United have come out fighting in the last five minutes. </p>

<p>Ethan Ampadu's volley from the edge of the box trickles harmlessly wide.</p>

<p>Chris Wilder makes his third and final change, sending Oli McBurnie on to replace Chris Basham.</p>

<p>United immediately make a change and Ben Osborn comes on to replace John Fleck. </p>

<p>In the moments leading up to the goal, Conor Hourihane made way for Keinan Davis.</p>

<p>Aston Villa take the lead as Ezri Konsa heads into the bottom corner from six yards. Tyrone Mings used his head to flick on a corner at the front post and Konsa arrived at the far post to head beyond Ramsdale. </p>

<p>Aston Villa 1-0 Sheffield United (63 MINS)</p>

<p>Cash crosses into the box and Watkins heads harmlessly over the bar.</p>

<p>Sheffield United are keeping their concentration and defensively they are doing the basics very well. Aston Villa are lacking a little bit of creativity. Grealish is being left on the fringes in the left wing position, not getting as much of the ball as he would like.</p>

<p>We're back underway at Villa Park. The hosts kick off hoping to capitalise on their numerical advantage in the second half.</p>

<p>Ezri Konsa tweaked his hamstring in the warm-up but has decided to play on.</p>

<p>Referee Graham Scott blows his whistle to bring an entertaining first half to a close.</p>

<p>The final phase of play sees Hourihane cross skewed behind by Treseguet at the back post.</p>

<p>Sheffield United were reduced to 10 men after 12 minutes as John Egan denied Ollie Watkins a goal-scoring opportunity, but the Blades have defended resolutely. </p>

<p>Chris Wilder's men created the best chance of the half after Chris Basham was tripped by Matt Targett, but Martinez produced an excellent save to repel John Lundstram from 12 yards.</p>

<p>Chris Wilder is renowned for his innovative tactics, and he has opted to deploy Ethan Ampadu in the centre-back position over the last few minutes, moving Basham into midfield to occupy Jack Grealish.</p>

<p>Jack Grealish rolls into the path of Conor Hourihane but the Republic of Ireland international lashes over from the edge of the box.</p>

<p>Emiliano Martinez makes a brilliant penalty save! The keeper dives to his right and makes a fingertip save to deny John Lundstram.</p>

<p>The penalty was awarded after Oli Burke dribbled with the ball on a counter-attack. The forward played a defence-splitting pass through to Chris Basham who was tripped by Matt Targett. </p>

<p>The spot-kick was eventually awarded after an absurdly lengthy VAR check.</p>

<p>United have regained their composure but are defending very deep, camped on the edge of their penalty area. </p>

<p>Chris Wilder makes his first change. Ethan Ampadu comes on for David McGoldrick.</p>

<p>Douglas Luiz heads straight into the arms of Ramsdale after a scramble in the area. </p>

<p>United have switched to a back four but are understandably still trying to find their feet after Egan's dismissal.</p>

<p>Blades are looking for respite by playing the ball up to Oli Burke, but the former West Brom man has been unable to hold it up so far.</p>

<p>Villa's new outfield signings combine as Cash swings in another delivery towards Watkins. </p>

<p>The former Brentford man struggles to get past his man and heads wide.</p>

<p>United are struggling to regroup here. The visitors concede multiple free-kicks in quick succession. Jack O'Connell heads Conor Hourihane's set-piece behind for a corner.</p>

<p>John Egan is shown a straight red card for denying a goal scoring opportunity. </p>

<p>Villa lump a long ball forward which lands in behind the Blades defence. The Irishman tussles with Ollie Watkins and prevents the debutant from reaching the ball before Aaron Ramsdale.</p>

<p>That's a bold decision by referee Graham Scott.</p>

<p>Jack Grealish is taken down for the first time this evening. The Aston Villa midfielder shows a burst of pace to get beyond John Lundstram, but the Blades No 7 is shown a yellow card after making a sliding tackle.</p>

<p>John Lundstram curls an inviting delivery across the face of goal and towards David McGoldrick, but Ezri Konsa does well to intervene and clear the danger.</p>

<p>Corner to Villa. Douglas Luiz swings a cross into the box which is headed behind by Chris Basham.</p>

<p>Hourihane's subsequent set-piece is headed tamely wide by Tyrone Mings.</p>

<p>Positive start for Villa. Matty Cash races forward and sends a deep cross to the back post.</p>

<p>John McGinn stretches for the ball but volleys behind.</p>

<p>PEEP! </p>

<p>Referee Graham Scott blows his whistle and Sheffield United get things underway in Birmingham.</p>

<p>Three new signings will make their first Aston Villa appearances tonight. </p>

<p>Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez (pictured) will make his debut after arriving from Arsenal. </p>

<p>Matty Cash will make his first start at right-back after signing from Nottingham Forest, and Ollie Watkins will lead the attacking line after joining from Brentford.</p>

<p>Just over 20 minutes to go until kick-off at Villa Park, and the visitors are being put through their paces ahead of their second game of the new season.</p>

<p>Manager Chris Wilder makes three changes from the 2-0 defeat by Wolves. Norwood, Sharp and McBurnie make way for Berge, McGoldrick and Burke.</p>

<p>Aston Villa were the beneficiaries of a goal-line technology glitch the last time these two sides met in June. </p>

<p>The pair drew 0-0 in the first game of the Premier League restart despite Villa keeper Orjan Nyland carrying the ball into his own net. </p>

<p>Villa subsequently survived relegation on the final day of the season, finishing one point above the drop zone.</p>
