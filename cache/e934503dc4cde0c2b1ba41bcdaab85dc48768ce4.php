<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The lawyer for the prime suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance has admitted that 'I wouldn't let him babysit my daughter'. </p>

<p>Friedrich Fulscher, who is representing Christian Brueckner in the Madeleine case, explained that - because of Brueckner's record which includes multiple child sex offences - he wouldn't let him near his own children.</p>

<p>But he added that the 43-year-old German, who is currently in jail in Germany for the rape of an American pensioner, 'could be my dogsitter'.</p>

<p>Friedrich Fulscher (left), the lawyer representing Madeleine McCann prime suspect Christian Brueckner (right), has admitted 'I wouldn't let him babysit my daughter'</p>

<p>Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said: 'I'd let him look after my dogs but I wouldn't let him look after my children or my daughter - if I had them.</p>

<p>'He could be my dogsitter, yes, but because of his record I would not let him look after my own daughter.' </p>

<p>Fulscher, who has in the past described Brueckner as a 'friendly conversationalist', also opened up about what it has been like stepping into the media spotlight around the Madeleine case.</p>

<p>He admitted that 'I don't sleep as well as I used to', partly due to threats he started receiving when he took on the case.</p>

<p>Fulscher also hit out at German prosecutors for suggesting Madeleine (pictured) is dead, saying they have shown him no evidence</p>

<p>'I've had threats, lots of them, some of them death threats,' he said. 'Some of them have been online and some of them have been on the phone.</p>

<p>'I have pressed charges on some of them. I've also been told my life is in danger for looking into the Madeleine McCann case.'</p>

<p>He also said that he has been to Portugal to review years-worth of evidence collected in the case, and uncovered some 'completely new' information.</p>

<p>Fulscher refused to reveal what it is, but called it 'big', adding: 'It certainly surprised me.' </p>

<p>Madeleine vanished while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz, in the Algarve in Portugal, in 2007, aged three.</p>

<p>She has not been seen since and nobody has ever been charged over the disappearance, but earlier this year, British investigators unveiled Brueckner as their new prime suspect. </p>

<p>Born in Germany in 1976, he moved to the Algarve in 1995 after serving part of a two-year sentence for molesting a six-year-old girl.</p>

<p>There, he is thought to have become involved in the local drugs trade before raping an American pensioner in 2005 - a charge he denies.</p>

<p>Prosecutors say that, on the night of Madeleine's disappearance, signal from a phone tower in Praia da Luz places Brueckner in the area. </p>

<p>Shortly after Madeleine's disappearance he moved back to Germany, where he was subsequently jailed on drug charges.</p>

<p>Madeleine vanished from a resort in Praia da Luz in 2007, and investigators say phone signals place Brueckner - who has multiple sex convictions including against children - in the area </p>

<p>He was convicted of sexual abuse of a child and possession of child pornography in 2016, before being jailed for the rape of the American woman in 2018.</p>

<p>He is currently in prison in Kiel, 55 miles north of Hamburg, where he is appealing against that conviction.</p>

<p>German prosecutors also named Brueckner as the prime suspect in Madeleine's disappearance, saying they have 'concrete evidence that she was killed.</p>

<p>However, parents Kate and Jerry McCann say they have not been shown that evidence, and Fulscher says he has not been sent a single document from the German side.   </p>

<p>'It is not comprehensible how a public prosecutor's office can repeatedly approach the media and make statements like: "We are firmly convinced that Christian B is the right person and the perpetrator and killed this girl", but then at the same time we are told that they don't have the crucial evidence,' he said.</p>

<p>Madeleine's case officially remains a 'missing persons' inquiry, and her parents say that - until evidence of her death is uncovered - they hope she will be found alive. </p>
