<p>A manhunt is underway for a thug who coward-punched a stranger in the back of the head because he accidentally bumped into him on a footpath. </p>

<p>The unprovoked assault happened on September 18 in Glebe, in Sydey's inner west, and left the 60-year-old man with a fractured skull.</p>

<p>The victim had been walking north along Bay Street when he was hit in the stomach by a hooded man walking past him.</p>

<p>The younger man, believed to be aged in his 20s, then turned and struck the older man in the back of the head before fleeing. </p>

<p>The man's skull cracked on the pavement outside Broadway Shopping Centre where he was left unconscious.  </p>

<p>'It was as bad as it gets when you see a king hit on CCTV footage,' Leichhardt Police Detective Acting Inspector Michael Egan-Hirst told The Daily Telegraph. </p>

<p>'The victim himself says he doesn't feel the same.'</p>

<p>'Hand yourself in otherwise we're going to come for you,' he warned.</p>

<p>The injured man was treated at the scene by NSW Ambulance paramedics before being taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with serious head injuries.</p>

<p>He underwent surgery and has since been released from hospital, but there are fears he may suffer permanent brain damage.</p>

<p>As inquiries continue, investigators have released CCTV images of a man they believe may be able to assist them with their inquiries.</p>

<p>He is described as having an olive complexion, aged in his 20s, with a slim build and a short dark beard, and was seen wearing a black hooded jumper and black Adidas tracksuit pants.</p>

<p>Insp Egan Hirst said the coward punch was sparked by nothing more than a harmless bump that would happen between anyone walking on the street.</p>

<p>The alleged perpetrator is facing a charge of grievous bodily harm with intent if arrested.</p>
