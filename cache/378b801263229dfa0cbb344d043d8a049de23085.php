<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Manchester City and Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure has apologised for an 'inappropriate joke' which resulted in him reportedly being dropped from this weekend's Soccer Aid charity game.</p>

<p>A report claims the 37-year-old was asked to leave the team hotel after posting content on a group message chat which offended fellow squad members. </p>

<p>He reportedly bragged in a WhatsApp group he could get 19 women to their five-star hotel in Cheshire and also allegedly posted a porn video of a naked woman in a bath in the chat on Thursday night.</p>

<p>Yaya Toure has apologised after he posted an explicit video to his SoccerAid WhatsApp group</p>

<p>Toure has admitted his mistake and regrets the negative publicity which has deflected from Sunday's fundraising game for children's charity Unicef at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>'I would like to apologise to everyone involved in Soccer Aid for an inappropriate joke I deeply regret,' he wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>'It was meant as a joke however I lacked thorough consideration for the feelings of other participants.</p>

<p>'That being said I deleted the jokes within minutes and I immediately apologised to all inside the group.</p>

<p>'We gather for a good cause and this deviates the focus of the game which is to bring everyone together to help children around the world.'</p>

<p>The Ivorian was training with the World XI for this weekend's SoccerAid match at Old Trafford</p>

<p>Despite his apology, other players were reportedly 'disgusted' by them and he was still forced off the show. </p>

<p>The ex-Manchester City midfielder was said to have posted the messages in a Whatsapp made up of his World XI team, with ex-Manchester United defender Patrice Evra among them.</p>

<p>But women's players Julie Fleeting and Lianne Sanderson - as well as singer Chelcee Grimes - were also in the chat.</p>

<p>Toure was reportedly ordered to delete the messages as soon as Unicef and ITV bosses found out and apologise to those in the group.</p>

<p>He was also allegedly told his position in the team was under threat and other players were said to still be seething during breakfast this morning.</p>

<p>The ex-Manchester City star regrets the publicity which has deflected from the Unicef event</p>

<p>Toure added: 'It's sad to see an inappropriate joke I made attract the attention which should be fully devoted to the beauty of the charity game.</p>

<p>'Regardless of the circumstances, I want to take full responsibility. I am a grown man who should not be engaged in such jokes.</p>

<p>'I am very sorry for my mistake and I wish everyone all the best with Soccer Aid on Sunday in raising awareness and funds for important causes.'</p>

<p>Soccer Aid is played every year and sees an England XI side and World XI team - both made up of ex-players and celebrities - face off and raise money for charity.</p>
