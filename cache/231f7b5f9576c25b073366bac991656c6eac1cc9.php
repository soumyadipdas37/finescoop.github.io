<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paul Pogba's blushes were spared by the Video Assistant Referee after the Manchester United man conceded a penalty at Brighton.</p>

<p>The French midfielder clumsily brought down Aaron Connolly as he closed in on goal early in the second-half at the Amex Stadium.</p>

<p>Referee Chris Kavanagh immediately pointed to the penalty spot and booked Pogba but was advised to review the decision on the pitchside monitor by VAR official Simon Hooper.</p>

<p>Paul Pogba clumsily brings down Aaron Connolly early in the second half at the Amex Stadium</p>

<p>The Brighton forward was through on goal and fell under pressure from Pogba in the box</p>

<p>Referee Chris Kavanagh awarded the penalty but then urged to check the pitchside monitor</p>

<p>The replays showed that Connolly had initiated the contact by reaching back and tugging the front of Pogba's shirt as they strained to reach the ball.</p>

<p>That was enough for Kavanagh to overturn his decision and rescind the yellow card for Pogba, much to Connolly's frustration.</p>

<p>It would have been the second penalty awarded against a sluggish United side in the game.</p>

<p>Bruno Fernandes bundled over Tariq Lamptey in the 37th minute with the penalty confirmed after a VAR check.</p>

<p>Having seen the replays, Kavanagh decided to overturn his decision and there was no penalty</p>

<p>Connolly was left frustrated as replays showed he had grabbed Pogba's shirt before the foul</p>

<p>Brighton forward Neal Maupay scored a cheeky Panenka penalty past David de Gea to hand the home side the lead.</p>

<p>United equalised just before half-time, however, when Harry Maguire shot from close range with the final touch coming off Brighton defender Lewis Dunk.</p>

<p>And Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, having seen two goals disallowed themselves, went into the lead through Marcus Rashford on 55 minutes.</p>

<p>Brighton felt they should have been awarded another spot-kick not long afterwards when Connolly went down under pressure from Maguire but Kavanagh waved away appeals and VAR confirmed his decision.</p>
