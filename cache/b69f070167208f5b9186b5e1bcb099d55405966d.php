<p>Scary! Ashley James reassured her worried 278K followers on Monday night as she modelled some new maternity lingerie after she was hospitalised due to a severe trapped nerve</p>

<p>Ashley displayed her growing baby bump in a pink nude lace bralette with a pair of matching pants.</p>

<p>The model styled her blonde locks into a glossy blow-dried hairdo and added a slick of glamorous make-up.</p>

<p>Ashley sweetly cradled her baby bump for the snaps and also shared a video to her Instagram Story to show off the back of the lingerie set.  </p>

<p>The mother-to-be also admitted that she wanted to show off more maternity lingerie looks but she was still in pain from her trapped nerve.  </p>

<p>Keeping it real! The DJ, 33, who is five months pregnant with her first child, kept things candid as she revealed she was celebrating 'feeling sexy' after her 'pregnancy boobs' left her 'emotional'</p>

<p>Ashley kept things candid in her caption as she revealed she was celebrating 'feeling sexy' after her 'pregnancy boobs' left her both 'worried' and 'emotional'.</p>

<p>She penned: 'Well I've found my new 'everyday' lingerie set, and wanted to shout out an incredible independent lingerie store I visited in Notting Hill where I found it, because I think you'll love it.</p>

<p>'You'll remember I had a fitting a few weeks ago and I left very emotional and worried about pregnancy boobs. Well, <?php echo e('@'); ?>maison.sl got in touch with me inviting me to go there, and from the moment I stepped in Susana made me feel so empowered and confident. </p>

<p>'I just want to say that I've not been asked to post, but I know what a hard time it is for small businesses at the moment, and also how hard it is for us big boobed girls to find bras that still make us feel sexy.'</p>

<p>Glowing: Ashley displayed her growing baby bump in a pink nude lace bralette with a pair of matching pants</p>

<p>Ashley celebrated the fact that she can wear bras that don't make her lose her 'identity' or 'sense of style'.</p>

<p>She continued: 'I was honestly blown away by the selection of bras Susana showed me</p>

<p>'She kept bringing out a whole different selection, and was really knowledgeable about sizing, but also reminded me that we don't need to lose our identity or sense of style just because we're pregnant.  </p>

<p>'We can still find sexy lingerie that's still practical and comfortable.'</p>

<p>Glamorous: The model styled her blonde locks into a glossy blow-dried hairdo and added a slick of glamorous make-up</p>

<p>Ashley added that she wanted to show off more maternity lingerie looks but is still in pain with her trapped nerve.</p>

<p>She continued: 'I want to show off all the selection I ended up getting in a video, but I'm still in some pain, but for now here's my new everyday bra. It's got a racer back, is beyond comfortable, and it's flat lace so you can wear it under T-Shirts. </p>

<p>'The matching thing is so nice too, there's no elastic band and it's really stretchy. Anyway, Susana offers free fittings in store, or on zoom if you're not in London. </p>

<p>'She had loads of different brands and sizes, so whether you're pregnant or not, big boobed or small and are looking for someone to make you feel empowered as you try on lingerie then I can't recommend her enough.'</p>

<p>Candid: The mother-to-be also admitted that she wanted to show off more maternity lingerie looks but she was still in pain from her trapped nerve</p>

<p>Ashley finished her post by also celebrating her growing baby bump and new 'outie belly button'.</p>

<p>She said: 'I left the store with a swing in my step (and this bra on, I didn't even take it off after wearing it). #ljngerie #noretouching #shoplocal PS shout out to my outie belly button, it's well and truly popped now.' </p>

<p>It comes after Ashley revealed that the mystery pains in her side that left her hospitalised over the weekend were due to a severe trapped nerve.        </p>

<p>The DJ, who is five months pregnant with her first child, shared selfies from a maternity ward on Instagram on Saturday night after being admitted as a precaution. </p>

<p>And on Monday, the 33-year-old model took to her Instagram Story to update her followers on what happened, explaining she experienced spasms along her body.</p>

<p>Speaking about the incident earlier on Monday, Ashley thanked her boyfriend Tom Andrews for waiting outside the hospital for 10 hours. </p>

<p>Six months later, the couple discovered they were having their first baby, after Tom moved into Ashley's London home amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
