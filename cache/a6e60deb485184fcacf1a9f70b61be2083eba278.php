<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paul Merson has lambasted Chelsea's decision to allow experienced winger Willian to leave the club and join rivals Arsenal on a free transfer this summer. </p>

<p>The Brazil international's deal expired after an unsavoury contract stand-off brought an end to his seven-year Stamford Bridge spell, and his debut for Arsenal was marked by a hat-trick of assists against Fulham last weekend.</p>

<p>Merson says Chelsea have taken an unnecessary risk by not stopping Willian from walking away - and also insists Frank Lampard is now under pressure to deliver after a remarkable spending spree. </p>

<p>Paul Merson has slammed Chelsea's decision to allow Willian to join Arsenal on a free transfer</p>

<p>The ex-Arsenal man also insists the pressure is on for Frank Lampard to deliver success soon</p>

<p>Chelsea were keen to keep Willian and thrash out an extension, but the 32-year-old had demanded a three-year deal. With the club only willing to offer him two years, Arsenal were able to capitalise and steal in. </p>

<p>'I cannot believe Chelsea let Willian go. I know they have gone out and got special players, but there is nothing to say they are going to hit the ground running,' Merson told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'In Willian, you have got someone there who is ready-made. I like who they have signed, but they cost a lot of money, and their wages are probably the same as Willian.'</p>

<p>Willian's contract stand-off allowed Arsenal to steal in and seal the bargain switch this summer</p>

<p>Willian won two Premier League trophies, an FA Cup, a Carabao Cup and the Europa League in west London before making the controversial move across the capital.</p>

<p>He starred on his top flight debut for his new club at Craven Cottage, while Timo Werner and Kai Havertz - two of Chelsea's big money signings - also made their bows in the scrappy win over Brighton.     </p>

<p>Having sensationally splashed the cash to overhaul his ranks, Merson says that Chelsea's patience with Lampard may rapidly wear thin if he is unable to secure silverware soon.</p>

<p>Lampard has been keen to manage expectations after Chelsea's remarkable spending spree</p>

<p>He added: 'Frank Lampard has to win now. He has not got four years. That's management, I'm not being horrible.</p>

<p>'Even if Frank wins the league this year, it does not mean he is going to be there in four years. We know that and how it changes.</p>

<p>'Who is to say this is not going to take time for Chelsea? And I don't think they've got time at the moment.' </p>
