<p>It comes as Zara and her former Rugby pro husband Mike Tindall both tested negative for Covid-19.</p>

<p>The couple, who have spent lockdown at their home on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Estate, were filmed taking the tests at the stables on their farm in Gloucestershire. </p>

<p>Both were relieved the tests came back negative, and the Tindalls are believed to have since travelled to Balmoral to see the Queen.</p>

<p>They then uploaded their results onto their VHealth Passport - which has been developed to help get sports fans back into major events and stadiums - where they appeared within seconds.</p>

<p>Zara winced as the pin-prick test was administered, which detects coronavirus antibodies and was performed under Covid-19 safe practice by Latus Health Care. </p>

<p>The couple are taking part in a pilot scheme called FANS ARE BACK, which is being put to the government to get football, snooker, rugby, golf and equestrian sports fans back into stadiums and major sporting events next month.</p>

<p>It comes as Zara and her former Rugby pro husband Mike Tindall both tested negative for Covid-19. Zara is pictured today</p>

<p>They're regular faces at Cheltenham Festival and Royal Ascot, but this year the couple marked the event from their home in Gloucestershire during lockdown (pictured)</p>
