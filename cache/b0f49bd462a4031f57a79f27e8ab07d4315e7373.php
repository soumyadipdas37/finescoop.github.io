<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Another 16 workers have tested positive for Covid-19 at a chicken factory in Norfolk - bringing the total number of cases to 96.  </p>

<p>Banham Poultry in the village of Attleborough voluntarily agreed to close its cutting room last Friday following an outbreak of the disease.</p>

<p>Some 350 employees were advised to go into isolation at the time, and 477 of the plant's staff members have so far been tested - with more results expected shortly.  </p>

<p>Several workers are believed to have reported to the James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston. Of these, a 'very small number' of workers have been treated.     </p>

<p>Banham Poultry in the village of Attleborough voluntarily agreed to close its cutting room last Friday following an outbreak of the disease</p>

<p>Dr Smith said: 'Clearly the numbers of cases in this outbreak are rising and there are a number of different elements of response and work that we are working on including ensuring animal welfare, the support for the business as well as the public health imperative to interrupt and reduce the spread of coronavirus.</p>

<p>'It remains the case we do not have evidence of spread in the wider community. </p>

<p>'We are linking the cases back to this outbreak and we do not believe we do not need to move towards a wider lockdown at this stage.'</p>

<p>Anyone who has tested positive for Covid-19 is urged to self-isolate for 10 days after receiving a positive test result.   </p>

<p>Blaine van Rensburg, Banham Poultry managing director, said last week: 'The safety of our staff, customers, and the wider public is really important to us.</p>

<p>Norfolk Council's director of public health Dr Louise Smith today said the factory has been deep cleaned following the outbreak</p>

<p>'We are working with public health authorities to make sure we are doing absolutely everything we can and following all of the correct procedures.' </p>

<p>The first case of Covid was reported at Banham Poultry on August 21, when one worker said they felt unwell. By Monday, seven out of 15 tested were found to have the virus. </p>

<p>The origin of the first case is unclear.</p>

<p>Officials last week claimed that any potential geographical spread of the virus from Banham Poultry, which employs 1,100 people, is low.</p>

<p>Steve Morphew, leader of the opposition Labour group at Norfolk County Council, said: 'This outbreak shows the critical importance of making sure we learn the lessons and ensure there are enough resources to respond swiftly.</p>

<p>Anyone who has tested positive for Covid-19 is urged to self-isolate for 10 days after receiving a positive test result</p>

<p>'We know delays are costly in every sense so we must make sure our public health team can do the job we need from them. '</p>

<p>Attleborough mayor Philip Leslie said he had expected to see an increase in confirmed cases, but moved to reassure the town's residents.</p>

<p>He said: 'They have tested all 300 staff which I think has been exceptional - we are very grateful for public health England, their quick response and the way they have escalated resources to tackle it. </p>

<p>'However, it will raise eyebrows within the community to see such a large number of confirmed cases. </p>

<p>'So the main thing for us as a town council, is to keep on top of the situation and reassure that residents it seems to be isolated at Banham Poultry alone. </p>

<p>'We will remain vigilant and keep following government guidance. But we also need to have good practice within our homes as well. </p>

<p>'People are becoming a little lax and don't follow rules in their own homes.</p>

<p>'We need to work hard at recognising that this is still a real issue. </p>

<p>'We don't have the vaccine in place yet or the long-term solution so we need to treat it as seriously we did a few months ago. We as a community are keeping our ears to the ground and ready to act on advice that comes.'</p>

<p>Food processing plants have been at the centre of localised outbreaks, with sites in West Yorkshire, Wrexham and Anglesey all being hit.</p>

<p>Health experts suggest the cold, damp environment in factories provide optimal environments for the coronavirus to spread.</p>

<p>In Northampton, nearly 300 workers tested positive earlier this month at the Greencore sandwich factory, which has now partially reopened.</p>
