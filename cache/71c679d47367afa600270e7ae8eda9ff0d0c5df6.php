<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A fast food addict who used to consume up to 2,000 calories in one sitting and was labelled a 'whale' by strangers has shed an incredible 164lbs with the help of a gastric sleeve.</p>

<p>Julie Garte, 35, from Miami, weighed a colossal 342lbs at her heaviest - but now, five years later, she flaunts her size six physique with pride after spending $17,500 on the weight loss surgery, as well as a tummy tuck and breast lift and enlargement.</p>

<p>Training to be a personal trainer, Julie revealed that her weight first started creeping up as a side effect of the medication she was taking to treat her bipolar disorder.</p>

<p>But by the time her tablets were changed, it was 'too late' because Julie's binge eating had already spiralled out of control - with the 'emotional eater' devouring McDonald's near-daily.</p>

<p>After deciding 'enough is enough', Julie overhauled her diet - sticking to mainly vegetables and chicken instead - and said she's 'finally living after years of hiding away'.</p>

<p>Fast food addict Julie Garte (pictured left before her weight loss, and right, after), who used to consume up to 2,000 calories in one sitting and was labelled a 'whale' by strangers, has shed an incredible 164lbs with the help of a gastric sleeve</p>

<p>Julie (pictured recently) weighed a colossal 342lbs at her heaviest - but now, five years later, she flaunts her size six physique with pride after spending $17,500 on the weight loss surgery, as well as a tummy tuck and breast lift and enlargement</p>

<p>Training to be a personal trainer, Julie (pictured after her weight loss) revealed that her weight first started creeping up as a side effect of the medication she was taking to treat her bipolar disorder</p>

<p>Julie's bad eating habits spiralled out of control because she used food as a coping mechanism to deal with depression. </p>

<p>Julie said: 'One day, I looked in the mirror and my reflection blew my mind. It was a real wake up call and I decided enough was enough.</p>

<p>'I didn't want to spend another decade sleeping and eating. I knew I needed surgery to keep the weight off after years of yo-yo dieting.</p>

<p>'It was always easier to eat fast food washed down with two litres of cola followed by anything sweet. I was an emotional eater and used food to cheer myself up but would instantly feel sad again after consuming up to 2,000 calories in one sitting.'</p>

<p>Julie was pre-diabetic and required physiotherapy three times per week. She started her journey by working out with the help of a personal trainer before having a large part of her stomach removed in 2015.</p>

<p>She then had a tummy tuck and breast lift and enlargement in 2017 which cost $12,000 and a revision in 2018 priced at $5,500.</p>

<p>Julie said: 'I made small changes to my diet such as replacing cola for water and cooking rather than going to a drive through. Now, I love to cook home-made dishes and eat sweets in moderation! </p>

<p>'I am so confident now - I smile at strangers and go out of a weekend! I spent years being taunted because of my weight - strangers would shout "whale" and "fatty" as I passed. </p>

<p>'It is so hurtful that people can be so cruel - they judged me without even knowing my story.'</p>

<p>Julie initially piled on the pounds as it was a side effect of the medication she was taking to treat bipolar disorder.</p>

<p>She said: 'I have never felt so happy and motivated in my entire life. I want to help overweight people experience these feelings too which is why I am training to be a personal trainer.</p>

<p>'I am finally living after years of hiding away. I've been told I am an inspiration which definitely spurs me on to keep on going.'</p>

<p>A gastric sleeve is where a large part of the stomach is removed during surgery so it's much smaller than it was before. </p>

<p>This means the patient cannot eat as much as they could before the operation and they'll feel full sooner.</p>
