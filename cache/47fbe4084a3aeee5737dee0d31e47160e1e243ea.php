<p>Kyly looked a million dollars in leopard print tights and a simple black sports bra. </p>

<p>'Remember looking your best and feeling your best may appear different on a daily basis,' she captioned the Instagram post.</p>

<p>'I truly believe caring for your body through a healthy driven lifestyle is fundamental for personal growth and allows you the opportunity to feel that you can conquer anything.'</p>

<p>It is not the first time the former WAG has flaunted her incredible physique online.</p>

<p>Following her split with ex-husband Michael Clarke after seven years together, the brunette beauty has become an advocate for healthy living and promoting the 'never take yourself too seriously' motto.</p>

<p>'We all have our burdens to bare': Kyly Clarke flaunted her sensational figure at the gym earlier this month and shared her thoughts on life after her split from ex-husband Michael Clarke</p>

<p>The post was aimed at grabbing the attention of her fans to remind them humour and 'being able to joke daily with family and friends is what truly makes you smile from the inside'.</p>

<p>'We all have our burdens to bare, we all suffer from some kind of stress that life bestows on us, but we truly are in this together,' Kyly captioned the post.</p>

<p>'So be kind, gentle and soft with the next person you brush past, make them smile or laugh and see the affect it has on you. </p>

<p>Show stopper: 'We all have our burdens to bare, we all suffer from some kind of stress that life bestows on us, but we truly are in this together,' Kyly said earlier this month</p>

<p>'You never know what battle they are currently facing. And trust me, there is generally always something on someone’s mind. Spread love and kindness.'  </p>

<p>Kyly's positive attitude followed Michael reflecting on his life a year after separating from his wife.   </p>

<p>The retired Australian cricketer told The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine he was 'so happy right now' and 'in a great place'.</p>
