<p>'I got the shock of my life when I was presented with a catwalk of multiple versions of myself over the past decade.</p>

<p>'It seems throughout my outfit and hair choices I was always trying to find what category I fit into.</p>

<p>'I used to hate the old versions of me I was made to feel embarrassed and ashamed of her.</p>

<p>'I don't feel like that any more. Each of those versions of myself was loving, kind, generous and a great friend.</p>

<p>Darker days: Her pal Zahida channelled the star during her so-called 'goth phase' when she sported purple hair and plenty of all-black looks</p>

<p>'Yes she made some mistakes but let's normalise growing up and doing better. Becoming educated and making the right choices. We learn more through failure than we do success ✨</p>

<p>'I'm proud of all of the versions of me that lead me to this point I am at today ❤️</p>

<p>'Happy, confident and living my best life with the man of my dreams every single day.'</p>

<p>Last May, Holly gushed about her three-year relationship with the sportsman in an interview with MailOnline.</p>

<p>The blonde beauty enthused: 'I've never been in a relationship with someone who has loved me back. It's the first time I've ever felt that.' </p>

<p>Their romance has gone from strength-to-strength as she packed up and left her Teesside home to start her new life in Manchester last year. </p>

<p>The TV star faced crippling anxiety two years ago when her toxic relationship with former co-star Kyle Christie came to an end. </p>

<p>At the height of her mental health battle, she suffered from panic attacks, lost her confidence and self esteem - with the thought of even going to the supermarket being too much to handle. </p>

<p>Battling it out: The duo later relished in a spot of karaoke as they belted the lyrics to Jennifer Hudson's 2008 track Spotlight</p>

<p>'So when I got with Jacob I realised when you're with the right person, it's so easy you don't have to fight at all. It's the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>'I don't regret the relationship with Kyle because it taught me so much, I learned everything I know from that relationship. It only made me a stronger person.' </p>

<p>Before her three-year romance with Kyle, 27, broke down in March 2017, Holly briefly dated fellow reality star James Tindale and X Factor star Frankie Cocozza in 2011.</p>

<p>Her happy place: The blonde announced her engagement to Macclesfield Town forward Jacob Blyth in June last year</p>
