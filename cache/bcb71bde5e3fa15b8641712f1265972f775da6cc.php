<p>Definitely NOT love at first sight! Grant and Chezzi Denyer have now revealed that their relationship was far from love at first sight and that they initially 'hated each other'</p>

<p>Grant proclaimed: 'We frankly just hated each other!'</p>

<p>Chezzi retaliated: 'You were so annoying. We clashed a lot. It was up to me to make you look half decent on air. </p>

<p>'For a young producer who gave their all for the job, that was annoying!' </p>

<p>However, they revealed that things soon took a romantic turn when they accidentally brushed their hands against each other and felt chemistry. </p>

<p>Not love lost: Speaking on their new podcast, It's All True?, Chezzi explained that she found Grant 'annoying' because he wasn't doing his weather job properly, while he mentioned he found her 'more annoying' for bossing him around</p>

<p>Grant said: 'There was a moment, there was a spark, there was an explosion inside of me and I was like "whoa!" and the game changed, and my world stopped and love just flooded in'.</p>

<p>'I was like, I felt this tingle from head to toe come over me. I realised I cannot live without this woman and I need her in my life forever,' he added. </p>

<p>The Family Feud host recently revealed he has 'cherished' his time in isolation with his family.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph last month, he said: 'To be absolutely honest, I've had a couple of crazy years... In fact, I've had 300 nights in hotels in the last two-and-a-half years.'</p>

<p>'My tank was pretty empty, so it was a real chance to restore, replenish and revitalise,' the TV personality added.</p>

<p>'This pandemic has taken so much away from so many people, but in a weird way, it's also given us something back,' he said, adding that he 'cherished' the extra time with his family.</p>

<p>Happy family: The pair are currently their third child. They already share daughters, Scout and Sailor</p>
