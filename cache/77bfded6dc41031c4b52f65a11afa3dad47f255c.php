<p>A Filipino crew member (pictured) who was rescued after a distress signal was sent by the Australian owned Gulf Livestock 1 said the ship capsized and sunk in rough weather caused by Typhoon Maysak</p>

<p>He moved to North Queensland from Germany as a child before taking up studies at James Cook University after high school.</p>

<p>Mr Orda was working with horses on the Gold Coast before joining the live export carrier as a vet in June, the Townsville Bulletin reported. </p>

<p>The Gulf Livestock 1 left New Zealand on August 14 and was due to arrive at the Port of Jingtang in Tangshan, China on Friday. </p>

<p>Lukas Orda and his wife Emma (pictured together) welcomed their first child, Theo, only six months ago before he joined the live export ship in June</p>

<p>Rescue teams are continuing their search for the ship and the remaining 42 crew members which include 38 from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia</p>

<p>The vessel had almost 6,000 cattle on board when it disappeared west of Amami Oshima in south-western Japan.  </p>

<p>Japan's coast guard dispatched planes and rescue boats to hunt for the ship and late Wednesday found a sole survivor - the ship's 45-year-old Filipino chief officer.</p>

<p>Dramatic photos released by the coast guard showed the man floating in the darkness in an orange life jacket and being pulled onto a boat with a rope as rescuers battled violent, rolling waves.</p>

<p>He was quickly brought to a large vessel, where coast guard personnel with surgical masks and gloves wrapped him with blankets.</p>

<p>'Water,' said the man, who identified himself as a Filipino in the video. 'Thank you, thank you very much.'</p>

<p>Rescue teams are continuing their search for the ship and the remaining 42 crew members which include 38 from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia. </p>

<p>Based on the last known location of the ship it would have been sailing in high winds of 58 knots (107km/h). </p>
