<p>'I just had to wait to meet the right guy! I kept on meeting guys I just didn't want to be a parent with, then finally I met my husband when I was 33. It was just the way it worked out,' she explained.</p>

<p>And the Home and Away star said the secret to their long-lasting marriage was maintaining separate interests. </p>

<p>'We just give one another an enormous amount of space. We've never been joined at the hip, it's just not the way we operate,' she admitted. </p>

<p>'I think it's very healthy to do a lot of things separately, we have our own interests and I think that really helps. We do things independently, but also as a family, and as a couple.'</p>

<p>In an interview with The Daily Telegraph's Stellar Magazine in July 2017, Georgie said she made 'a conscious choice' to keep her family out of the spotlight.  </p>

<p>'I don't talk about my family at all... I think it's not their career - it's mine!' she explained. </p>
