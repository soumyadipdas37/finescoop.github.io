<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Virginia teenager may want to reflect on his life choices after spending two hours in a tattoo parlor getting a message inked on his arm — only to discover later that the artist wrote the words backwards.</p>

<p>Dylan Harraway, 18, wanted the words 'Dream Chaser' on his arm in an homage to rapper Meek Mill.</p>

<p>But according to Jam Press, the artist messed up — big time — and tattooed the design's mirror image, so Dylan can only read it if he looks at it in the mirror. </p>

<p>Permanent: Dylan Harraway, 18, wanted the words 'Dream Chaser' on his arm in an homage to rapper Meek Mill</p>

<p>Yikes... The artist messed up — big time — and tattooed the design's mirror image, so Dylan can only read it if he looks at it in the mirror</p>

<p>Cheap: He shelled out $200 at a 'very professional and clean' tattoo parlor and sat for two hours while his arm got inked</p>

<p>Dylan, an aspiring rapper, was inspired by Dream Chasers Records, founded by 33-year-old rapper Meek Mill.</p>

<p>He also liked the message behind it, explaining: 'I need to do whatever I need to do to chase my dreams of living the life I’ve wanted.'</p>

<p>So he shelled out $200 at a 'very professional and clean' tattoo parlor and sat for two hours while his arm got inked.</p>

<p>Dylan himself didn't realize that anything was wrong until a friend pointed it out.</p>

<p>Oblivious: Dylan himself didn't realize that anything was wrong until a friend pointed it out</p>

<p>'I didn’t notice until my friend told me it was backward,' he said 'I was very angry and there were a lot of emotions running through me.'</p>

<p>'I didn’t notice until my friend told me it was backward,' he said. 'I was very angry and there were a lot of emotions running through me.'</p>

<p>Though clearly not thrilled, he had enough humor about it to share a video about the snafu on social media.</p>

<p>'So you think y'all having a bad day?' he says in the clip, filming himself in the mirror. </p>

<p>'I just went and got this tattoo for $200, and went to realize the dude put it on f***in' backwards, so now I can only read it through a mirror and people can't see it.' </p>

<p>Oh well... Commenters have told him it's his own fault for skimping on a tattoo that should have cost more than $200</p>

<p>Lucky: But there may be some home for Dylan yet, as celebrity tattoo artist Bang Bang came across his story and has offered to fix it for him</p>

<p>Commenters have told him it's his own fault for skimping on a tattoo that should have cost more than $200. </p>

<p>'My friend just thought it was funny and it looked good and my family thought I was a dumbass!' he added. </p>

<p>But there may be some home for Dylan yet: Celebrity tattoo artist Bang Bang came across his story and has offered to fix it for him.</p>

<p>And Dylan isn't scared off of ink, either. He said he eventually wants to finish the full sleeve.</p>
