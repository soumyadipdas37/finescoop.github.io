<p>Sikh Volunteers Australia on Tuesday reached 189 consecutive days of donating free curries to disadvantaged people across the city.</p>

<p>Sikh Volunteers Australia have been donating food (pictured) to Melbournians in need for 189 consecutive days in the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Volunteer Coordinator Manpreet Singh told Daily Mail Australia the organisation's 189-day donation streak had happened organically.</p>

<p>'We started on the 18th of March for two weeks due to government lockdown announcements and it slowly increased to more days and just happened continuously,' Mr Singh said.</p>

<p>'We've had continued support from our community and volunteers so we kept extending our service out to nearly six months.'</p>

<p>The organisation was launched in 2014, with their food delivery service starting in 2017 in honour of Sikh First Master Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who started a free food service in the 15th century to help people in need.</p>

<p>They began serving food to homeless people twice a week, but have grown into their full scale daily operation in response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>More than 260 volunteers have participated in the organisation during the pandemic, including up to 35 people every day to help with food preparation, cooking and delivering meals.</p>

<p>At their peak the organisation deliver up to 900 meals per day to six councils around the city</p>

<p>Their meals are given to the elderly, unemployed, health workers and COVID effected people</p>

<p>Ten vehicles transport food using contactless delivery to six councils around Melbourne, including City of Casey, Frankston, Dandenong, Monash, Mornington Peninsula and Kingston.</p>

<p>The organisation celebrated their 100,000th meal delivery on September 16, with daily delivery numbers fluctuating with the pandemic.</p>

<p>Mr Singh said the group peaked at 900 meals per day in the first lockdown. </p>

<p>'At the moment we have 450 meals going out every day,' he said.</p>

<p>'Our food is going out to elderly people, single mums, the unemployed, international students, health workers and people facing hard time due to COVID-19.'</p>

<p>The organisation delivered meals to thousands of residents stuck in lockdown across Melbourne's housing commission towers in July.</p>

<p>'When the news came out, we received a few messages saying people needed help,' Mr Singh said.</p>

<p>Sikh Volunteers Australia food delivery service runs in honour of Sikh First Master Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who started a free food service in the 15th century to help people in need</p>

<p>'We didn't have much information, we just loaded up our food vans and went and served there for seven days.'</p>

<p>Sikh Volunteers Australia operates through donations of time and money from people and businesses in the broader community. </p>

<p>Mr Singh said community generosity is what has allowed their service streak to continue, with no sign of slowing down into the future.</p>

<p>'The response from the community has been overwhelming,' he said.</p>

<p>'Within six months we have received so many messages from people who are so thankful for this service.</p>

<p>'A lot of people have lost their jobs in the pandemic and it will take a long time for everything to go back to normal, maybe even years. </p>

<p>'We will keep this service running because people are still so effected.'</p>
