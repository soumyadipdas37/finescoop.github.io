<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Imposing fines of up to £10,000 on people who fail to self-isolate could be counterproductive and increase 'resentment', one of the Government's scientific advisers has said. </p>

<p>Professor Susan Michie, who is a member of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said the new fining regime risks 'alienating people'. </p>

<p>She said the fines could also undermine trust in NHS Test and Trace because they could deter people from getting tested or prompt them to try to conceal symptoms.  </p>

<p>The new fining regime will come into force in England from September 28 with penalties starting at £1,000 and rising to up to £10,000. </p>

<p>Professor Susan Michie has warned the Government's new coronavirus fines risk 'alienating' people </p>

<p>There are growing fears that the fines will hit people on lower incomes the hardest because one of the main reasons for failing to comply with quarantine rules is a need to go to work. </p>

<p>The Government is bringing forward a system of payments worth £500 for people on low incomes who have to self-isolate but critics believe that will not be enough to persuade some to stay at home. </p>

<p>Prof Michie argued that better support for people in self-isolation is the way to increase compliance rather than the threat of massive fines. </p>

<p>She told The Telegraph: 'It will set up resentment and divisions. If things are perceived not to be fair, then this undermines trust, in turn undermines adherence. </p>

<p>'The fines could actually be counterproductive by alienating people.' </p>

<p>She said experts have long been urging ministers to boost support for people who have been told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. </p>

<p>'None of these things have been done by the Government in the way we have advised over literally months,' she added.   </p>

<p>MPs have also expressed concerns that the fines could be prove counter-productive. </p>

<p>Tory MP Andrew Brigden said: 'People just won't come forward for testing. That is the probable unintended consequence of that rule.'  </p>

<p>Fines will initially start at £1,000 rising to £10,000 for repeat offenders and for 'the most egregious breaches' including those who stop others from self-isolating, like an employer who asks a staff member to come into work in violation of an order.</p>

<p>The penalties are in line with those for people who fail to quarantine for 14 days after returning to the UK from a country not on the list of low-risk nations.</p>

<p>The new regulations will come into force in England on September 28, although ministers are discussing with the devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland about extending them UK-wide.</p>

<p>The heavy penalty is the latest in a series of financial punishments introduced by authorities aimed at deterring would-be rule-flouters amid a recent sharp upsurge in coronavirus infections.</p>

<p>Another 3,899 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK were announced yesterday while a further 18 people died within 28 days of testing positive, bringing the UK total to 41,777.  </p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there is a danger the infection rate could 'shoot through the roof' if people did not follow the the Government's rules.</p>

<p>'We have seen in the data that some people who need to self-isolate are not doing so,' he told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme.</p>

<p>'If you have been asked to self-isolate then you either definitely have the coronavirus or you are highly likely to have coronavirus, and so it is mission critical that you isolate.</p>

<p>'I am very worried about this second wave. We have seen in other countries around Europe how it can absolutely shoot through the roof.'</p>
