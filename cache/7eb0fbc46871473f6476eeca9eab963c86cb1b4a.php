<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A frustrated McDonald's customer has shared shocking images of a Chicken Legend burger served in mouldy bread, which he claims made him feel immediately sick.</p>

<p>The customer, a 25-year-old bank clerk from London, headed into the Warren Street branch of the fast food chain last week in his lunch break to pick up a £5.59 meal to eat at his desk.</p>

<p>He took a bite from the sandwich and soon noticed something was wrong, and then saw the mould on the bread. </p>

<p>Footage shows how the bank worker returned to the restaurant to confront staff, but he claims that a week after being told to contact customer services, he's received no response. </p>

<p>FEMAIL has contacted McDonald's for comment.  </p>

<p>A frustrated McDonald's customer has shared shocking images a Chicken Legend burger served in mouldy bread which he claims made him feel immediately sick</p>

<p>The bank clerk, who asked not to be named, told FEMAIL: 'I was on my lunch break and ordered a Chicken Legend from the self-service kiosk.</p>

<p>'I went back to work, sat down and took from the burger, that's when I noticed it looked a bit odd. </p>

<p>'I asked one of my colleagues '"What's wrong with my burger?" and he replied "You've got a mouldy burger".'</p>

<p>Frustrated, he went back to the store and asked to speak to the manager who urged him to get in contact with the company online, but a week later he still hasn't heard anything back.</p>

<p>The customer spoke to the manager (pictured) who asked him to contact customer services online</p>

<p>Photos show clear markings of mould on the bread that the customer was served. He said he felt immediately sick</p>

<p>The one bite of the mouldy bread made the bank clerk feel sick, and he's contacted his GP as a result.  </p>

<p>'I went back to the restaurant and asked to speak to the manager. When the person at the till saw the burger was mouldy the manager came running out the back.</p>

<p>'I showed him the mouldy burger, explained that the burger was purchased today at 2:23pm and I had eaten it by 2:28pm and returned to the store by 2:33pm for the manager to state to me in a video that there are problems with freshly made orders,' he explained.</p>

<p>The stamp on the burger says it was 'freshly made to order' at 2.23 on August 26. Despite his immediate complaint the customer still has not received a reply</p>

<p>'McDonald's has a system where multiple people would have seen the burger before it was given to me which makes think that they relabel their expired food.</p>

<p>'The manager asked me to get in touch online. I went to the website, and tried to call customer service but they didn't take inbound calls,' he claimed. </p>

<p>'I haven't been contacted by anyone since contacting them online,' he added. </p>
