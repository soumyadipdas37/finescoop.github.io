<p>The Canadian firm confirmed it made the move in response to the ongoing court case against Jeremy. </p>

<p>Porn producers are bringing in special measures to protect performers after dozens of women accused adult film star Ron Jeremy of sex attacks, DailyMail.com can disclose</p>

<p>The 67-year-old was charged in Los Angeles in June with raping three women and sexually assaulting a fourth. On Monday, he was hit with 20 new counts of sexual abuse dating back to 2004 - including the assault of a 15-year-old girl</p>

<p>Keiran, 38 and known as the 'man with the million-dollar penis' after his nine-and-a-half inch manhood was insured for that amount, said: 'The industry turned its back on Ron Jeremy a long time ago.</p>

<p>'He had let the fame go to his head and he thought he was the man, and to be fair he was one of the biggest porn stars ever.</p>

<p>'He was already banned from the porn industry's main awards show, the AVN Awards, for walking around and groping people.</p>

<p>'I've never met him and he never worked with us but after the whole Ron Jeremy thing kicked off what Brazzers is doing is making sure there is a special female liaison on set at all times.</p>

<p>'So now if a girl ever feels like she is not comfortable with something she has someone she can confide in.</p>

<p>'I say female but it's for all talent, so female and male performers can go to the liaison officer and let them know if there's anything they're not comfortable with.</p>

<p>'Talent that aren't working on the day will be hired as liaison officers so it puts money in their pockets and there is someone neutral and not affiliated with the production there for the talent.</p>

<p>'Brazzers saw the Ron Jeremy situation and decided to review best practices during lockdown to make sets even safer than they already are.'</p>

<p>Now, Brazzers – one of the world's leading porn production companies - has decided to introduce measures including the use of security cameras on set and hiring 'talent liaison officers' to help performers deal with any allegations of abuse. The adult film company's top male performer Keiran Lee (pictured) told DailyMail.com the new anti-Ron Jeremy guidelines will come into effect when the porn industry returns to on-set production following the pandemic</p>

<p>He continued: 'We are also having a camera filming at all times during the day, like a CCTV camera that is on at all times so we have video evidence if anything goes wrong.</p>

<p>'Thankfully we have never had anything like that but it's good to be prepared if a director or performer steps out of line.</p>

<p>'From what I understand Ron Jeremy was a sleazeball off camera so we want transparency on set at all times, although from what I understand a lot of the women who have made complaints against him were not involved in the porn industry.</p>

<p>'Production has been on halt because of the pandemic but these guidelines are now in place for when we go back on set.</p>

<p>'It's also in response to the #MeToo movement and the Harvey Weinstein case, we've learned from mistakes they have made and want to make sure nothing like that happens on our sets.'</p>

<p>The 20 new charges against Jeremy date back to 2004, when Jeremy allegedly sexually assaulted an unnamed teenage girl at a party in Santa Clarita, just outside Los Angeles</p>

<p>Jeremy, whose real name is Ronald Jeremy Hyatt, remains in jail on $6.6 million bail after he pleaded not guilty in June.</p>

<p>Since then prosecutors in Los Angeles say they have been contacted by dozens of women across the US who made allegations 'ranging from misdemeanor sexual battery to rape' against Jeremy.</p>

<p>The 20 new charges against Jeremy date back to 2004, when Jeremy allegedly sexually assaulted an unnamed teenage girl at a party in Santa Clarita, just outside Los Angeles.  </p>

<p>The alleged victims are aged between 15 and 54, and most recently include an alleged sexual assault outside a business in Hollywood on New Year's Day this year.</p>

<p>The latest charges include six counts of sexual battery by restraint, five counts of forcible rape, three counts of forcible oral copulation, two counts of forcible penetration by a foreign object and one count each of sodomy, assault with intent to commit rape, penetration by a foreign object on an unconscious or sleeping victim and lewd conduct with a 15-year-old girl.</p>

<p>Of the new complaints, six counts relate to alleged assaults in a West Hollywood bar and another in the venue's parking lot.</p>

<p>If convicted, the defendant -- who now faces 28 total counts of sexual violence in Los Angeles county -- could face 250 years to life in prison.</p>

<p>Jeremy was being transported from county jail to court at Department 50 of the Foltz Criminal Justice Center for his latest arraignment Monday and will plead not guilty to the latest charges, his attorney told AFP. </p>

<p>Last month DailyMail.com published exclusive photos of Jeremy's filthy, cockroach-infested LA apartment. A New York woman who met Jeremy in September 2017 said she went to his apartment to use the restroom and was shocked by what she saw. The woman says she isn't surprised about the allegations against Jeremy because he was so sexually aggressive with her and tried to grope her in her car (pictured)</p>

<p>This is the filthy, cockroach-infested Hollywood apartment of accused serial rapist and former porn star Ron Jeremy</p>

<p>Photos obtained by DailyMail.com show Jeremy's lounge filled with dozens of boxes, while the kitchen sides were filled with paperwork, used candles and empty bottles</p>

<p>The woman said: 'There was trash piled up, old porn memorabilia stuffed in overflowing boxes. His kitchen table looked like an unkempt outside porch, there were plants that had grown around the table legs and into the floor'</p>

<p>His lounge filled with dozens of boxes, while the kitchen sides were filled with paperwork, used candles and empty bottles. One corner of the apartment is seen filled with medication and discarded pill bottles and prescriptions with his real name, Ron J Hyatt written on them.</p>

<p>There's barely enough room to move around in the apartment due to the junk left on the floor which is black with dirt.</p>

<p>A woman who met Jeremy, 67, in 2017 said she went to his rundown one bedroom apartment to use the restroom and was so shocked by what she saw she began snapping pictures.</p>

<p>'It was disgusting, I was so shocked. You could hardly open the front door and you couldn't get in the bathroom at all.</p>

<p>'There was trash piled up, old porn memorabilia stuffed in overflowing boxes. His kitchen table looked like an unkempt outside porch, there were plants that had grown around the table legs and into the floor.</p>

<p>'I honestly thought he was on that show Hoarders. There were cans of roach spray left on the side, piles of medication, books, DVDs, paperwork and he had pet turtles.'</p>

<p>The woman claimed Jeremy aggressively came on to her while she was in his apartment but agreed to go to an event later that night with him.</p>

<p>But she gave Jeremy the slip and was later bombarded by calls from him.</p>

<p>She said: 'He was so angry that I took off without saying goodbye. He was enraged, it was really unsettling how angry he got.'</p>

<p>The woman said she isn't surprised about the allegations against Jeremy because he was so sexually aggressive with her and tried to grope her in her car.</p>
