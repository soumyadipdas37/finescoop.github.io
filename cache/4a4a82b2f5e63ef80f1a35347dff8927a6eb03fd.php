<p>Dark: Sarah Paulson has spoken about her latest role during an interview with Harper's Bazaar , as she admitted she is 'proud' of the exploration in the series</p>

<p>Alongside the interview, Sarah posed for a series of haunting shots, as she donned a variety of fashionable looks including a feathered jacket and hooded cape. </p>

<p>During series five of AHS, Sarah played erratic ghost Sally McKenna, who suffered with addiction problems and has been permanently residing at the Hotel Cortez ever since she was murdered in 1994.</p>

<p>Discussing her love of dark roles, Sarah told the publication: 'It's where the good stuff is. I'm much more interested in where there isn't nobility. </p>

<p>'Human beings so often are motivated by the ugliest part of themselves … the stuff we don't want to admit to ourselves about what we're hungry for.'</p>

<p>Interesting: The actress, 45, spoke about how she is more interested in playing 'darker' and 'uglier' roles, after taking on the part of the formidable Nurse Ratched</p>

<p>Villainous: Nurse Ratched was first introduced as the main antagonist in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</p>

<p>Sarah explained that her TV and film career is the one place that she is unafraid to be 'ugly', and doesn't feel afraid to go somewhere unpleasant with her roles.  </p>

<p>She added: 'I feel a certain sense of pride about being able to do that and without all the things that happen in every other aspect of my life when that comes up. But in this one area, I can actually say I feel capable of being fearless.'</p>

<p>Speaking about her 'pride' over how Ratched turned out, Sarah said: 'We were going for something, and I'm proud of it. It's an exploration, and it has something to say, and it looks beautiful. It's dangerous. It's scary. 'It's sexy….I feel a real sense of accomplishment with it.'</p>

<p>Discussing her love of dark roles, Sarah told the publication: 'It's where the good stuff is. I'm much more interested in where there isn't nobility'</p>

<p>Adding that for the first time in years she was forced to watch herself on camera, she added: 'I still to this day have not watched People v. O.J. Not seen it. That was the beginning of my commitment to not watching myself.</p>

<p>'But because I'm executive-producing Ratched and because it was my first time doing something like this, I watched every frame of it, dailies every single day. And it was a very confronting experience. Dealing with one's face is really something. It's really something to just be confronted with your mug.'</p>

<p>Sarah has starred in almost every season of American Horror Story and has won Critics' Choice Awards for her Supporting Actress roles. </p>

<p>Style: Alongside the interview, Sarah posed for a series of haunting shots, as she donned a variety of fashionable looks including a feathered jacket and hooded cape</p>

<p>On American Horror Story, she said: 'The biggest gift I've ever been given in my working life has been what my being on American Horror Story has made permissible with my relationship with an audience.</p>

<p>'They don't expect any particular thing with me. That's afforded me a tremendous amount of freedom.'</p>

<p>With her AHS success also came a fan base, which she said she finds 'confusing' because people feel like they have an ownership of her.</p>

<p>Sarah, who is in a relationship with actress Holland Taylor, said: 'To feel that I belong to anyone other than a person I would like to belong to, like Holland or my dog or my best friend or my sister...</p>

<p>'A bunch of strangers claiming me as their own feels a little confusing. Since I'm not an expert at figuring out how to move around it, I end up giving more than I want to sometimes.' </p>

<p>Unafraid: Sarah explained that her TV and film career is the one place that she is unafraid to be 'ugly', and doesn't feel afraid to go somewhere unpleasant with her roles</p>
