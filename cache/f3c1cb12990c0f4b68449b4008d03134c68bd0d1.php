<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An attorney for teen Kenosha gunman Kyle Rittenhouse plans to sue Twitter and take CEO Jack Dorsey's 'a** down' after his account was briefly suspended for 'glorifying violence'.</p>

<p>Lin Wood is one of several lawyers representing the 17-year-old after he was charged with shooting dead two protesters and injuring a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin last week. </p>

<p>Wood said he was locked out of his Twitter account for nine hours on Tuesday night after he started tweeting about raising funds for Rittenhouse's legal defense. </p>

<p>The attorney says he was falsely accused by Twitter of 'glorifying violence'. </p>

<p>Twitter admitted after several hours that his account was mistakenly disabled. </p>

<p>Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, remains in jail after he was charged with shooting dead two protesters and injuring a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin last week</p>

<p>'I was arrested today &amp; confined in Twitter jail falsely accused of glorifying violence. I was exonerated this evening by a finding of 'incorrectly actioned.' I am free tonight,' Wood tweeted after his account was restored.</p>

<p>'Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested on 8/26 &amp; is confined in Illinois jail falsely accused of murder. Kyle will be exonerated when truth is revealed by a finding of 'incorrectly actioned.' Kyle will be free soon.' </p>

<p>One of his attorneys, Lin Wood, is now planning to sue Twitter and take CEO Jack Dorsey's 'a** down' after his account was briefly suspended for 'glorifying violence'</p>

<p>Wood now plans to file a lawsuit against Twitter and its CEO Jack Dorsey. </p>

<p>He told Fox News that his account being blocked was just the later example of Twitter trying to censor conservatives. </p>

<p>'I'm going to take Jack Dorsey's a** down,' Wood said. </p>

<p>'He has been abusing the First Amendment of this country for his own agenda.'</p>

<p>Wood said he knew Twitter would try and censor him and that he had been careful to abide by Twitter's terms of service. </p>

<p>'I knew they were going to censor me because I'm sending a message of hope,' he said. 'I'm sending a message of truth. And I'm sending a message that Kyle Rittenhouse is innocent.' </p>

<p>He said he has been compiling a 'mountain of evidence' against the social media giant to prove they are suppressing free speech.  </p>

<p>A Twitter spokesperson later said Wood's account was mistakenly blocked. </p>

<p>'This account was incorrectly actioned,' the spokesperson said. 'This has been reversed and the account has been reinstated.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, several Facebook users have reported that the social media platform has been preventing them from sharing links to donate to Rittenhouse's legal defense. </p>

<p>Conservative YouTuber and conspiracy theorist Mark Dice said that Facebook had threatened to delete his account after he posted a video that showed Rittenhouse offering to help give first aid to protesters prior to the shootings. </p>

<p>He said Facebook removed the video and issued him a warning saying they don't allow praise or support for 'dangerous individuals'. </p>

<p>'In no way did I 'glorify' or celebrate him, nor 'praise' him. I simply posted a non-graphic video, and stated as a matter of fact what it showed. He helped a protester who was injured and didn't show up in Kenosha with any malicious intent to cause trouble,' Dice tweeted.</p>

<p>'I would be shocked if they didn't ban me completely by tomorrow for my other posts about the case.' </p>

<p>Rittenhouse remains in jail after being charged as an adult with two counts of first-degree homicide and one count of attempted homicide following the shootings on the third night of protests in Kenosha in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake. </p>

<p>Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber were killed and Gaige Grosskreutz was shot in the arm in a series of encounters that were captured on cellphone videos.  </p>

<p>Conservative YouTuber and conspiracy theorist Mark Dice said that Facebook had threatened to delete his account after he posted a video that showed Rittenhouse offering to help give first aid to protesters prior to the shootings</p>

<p>Several Facebook users, including another of the teen gunman's lawyers, have reported that the social media platform has been preventing them from sharing links to donate to Rittenhouse's legal defense</p>

<p>Witness accounts and cellphone video show that the shootings took place in two stages: Rittenhouse first shot Rosenbaum, then jogged away, stumbled and fell in the street, and opened fire again on Huber and Grosskreutz as members of the crowd closed in him. </p>

<p>After the gunfire, with his AR-15-style rifle over his shoulder and his hands in the air, Rittenhouse walked toward police vehicles that kept going past him, even as a witness shouted, 'He just shot them!'</p>

<p>Police Chief Daniel Miskinis has explained the response as officers dealing with a chaotic scene. </p>

<p>Rittenhouse's lawyers say the teen later turned himself in. </p>

<p>While prosecutors call his conduct criminal, his lawyers say he defended himself against a mob trying to disarm and hurt him. They and other supporters portray him as a hero who stood up to lawlessness.  </p>

<p>Trump on Monday sided with the 17-year old on the eve of his visit to Kenosha.</p>

<p>'He was trying to get away from them,' Trump said of Rittenhouse. </p>

<p>'And then he fell and then they very violently attacked him. I guess he was in very big trouble... He probably would have been killed.'  </p>
