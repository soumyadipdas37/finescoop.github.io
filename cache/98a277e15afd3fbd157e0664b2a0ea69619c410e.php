<p>Russian agents carried out a large military-style operation with four helicopters and dozens of heavily armed troops</p>

<p>The operation appeared to involve the Russian National Guard, a force under the command of Vladimir Putin, but also involved the FSB security service and the Investigative Committee.</p>

<p>Footage showed masked special forces with combat machine guns at the group's territory the in remote Kuraginsky district of Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia.</p>

<p>Other officers appeared to be in plain clothes.</p>

<p>'There are 50 avtozaks (cells on wheels), 50 buses, an ambulance, and medical workers,' said local resident Alexander Staroverov</p>

<p>Torop and Redkin 'were put into helicopters and taken away in an unknown direction', he said.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear if other cult followers were detained.</p>

<p>The group - who are banned from smoking and alcohol - has been in Siberia for years and it is unclear why the Russian authorities acted now in an early morning raid.</p>

<p>He claims to have 5,000 followers of whom several hundred live in wooden huts in the remote 'Sun City' camp at Petropavlovka, some 2,600 miles east of Moscow.</p>

<p>One estimate said there were 90 families at the site raided today by the authorities. Other followers of the 'messiah' live in villages nearby.</p>

<p>He heads what is known as the Church of the Last Testament, and he has written a ten volume 'sequel to the Bible'.</p>

<p>Three years ago the cult leader told the BBC: 'We have a school of noble maidens here.</p>

<p>'We're preparing girls to become future wives, future brides for worthy men.</p>

<p>'She has to understand not to rise above the man, not to be proud of her independence but to be shy, inconspicuous and weak.'</p>

<p>Vissarion is reported to have two wives with six children, having at one stage married a 19 year old who had lived with him since the age of seven.</p>

<p>He lives in a comfortable chalet while his followers reside in wooden huts in one of Russia's coldest regions with temperatures sinking to minus 50C in winter.</p>

<p>Torop had an awakening after he was fired as a night shift traffic cop in the Siberian town of Minusinsk, he has claimed.</p>

<p>God had sent him to Earth to teach mankind about the evils of war and the havoc we were wreaking on the environment, he claimed.</p>

<p>The cult leader abolished Christmas, replacing it with the anniversary of the date of his own first sermon, August 18.</p>

<p>He claims that Mary, mother of Jesus, is his own mother. Official records show his biological mother was called Nadyezhda.</p>

<p>He has followers in Germany and several other European countries. </p>
