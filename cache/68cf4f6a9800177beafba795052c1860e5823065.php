<p>Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Already several well-known models have been seen in the city, with Irina Shayk and Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski walking in Hugo Boss' show on Friday.</p>

<p>Kendall's trip comes after her sister Kylie was left unimpressed by a snap shared by their eldest sister Kim Kardashian. </p>

<p>Safety first: In keeping with safety guidelines amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, the star rounded out her ensemble with a brown face mask</p>

<p>Handlers: She was followed by a team of handlers as she made her way into a waiting vehicle</p>

<p>'Delete this immediately,' Kylie, 23, instructed Kim, 39, in the comments section of the photo, which was taken circa 2009 and posted Friday. </p>

<p>In response, Kim hilariously referenced P Diddy's penchant for shamelessly cropping out celebrities from his photos.  </p>

<p>'Should I Diddy crop you out?' Kim asked, prompting Kylie to reply: 'Absolutely.'</p>

<p>Fans flooded the comments section, remarking on just how different everyone looked in the flashback photo than they appear nowadays. </p>

<p>The women did all look dramatically different, whether it be because of their young age at the time the snap was taken or because of their hair colour.  </p>

<p>Throwback: Kendall's trip comes after her sister Kim Kardashian shared an epic throwback </p>

<p>Fine by me! Kylie approved a 'Diddy crop' of the photo, allowing her sister to shamelessly remove her from the image </p>

<p>The photo appeared to have been taken at a restaurant, where Kim and Khloe sat at the table while their younger sisters posed beside them. </p>

<p>Pre-teen Kylie rocked a side-swept bang and allowed her freckles to shine through with hardly a touch of makeup on her face.</p>

<p>Kim still looked glam as she sat at the center of the table, with her honey-hued locks perfectly sleeked to the side.  </p>

<p>Kendall flashed a sweet smile as she posed in the back, years before becoming a superstar in the world of modeling.</p>
