<p>Her look is loved: She has been dutifully showing off her designs all month as she ramps up for fall sales. Last week she showed off these Daisy Duke shorts with a crop top and heels</p>

<p>The focus of the shot was her lean legs that were also freshly tanned.</p>

<p>'Everyone get ready to be enlightened by my legendary spiritual guru... <?php echo e('@'); ?>legendarydisciplines,' she wrote. 'Thank God ERIC JOHNSON was born this day 41yrs ago! Happy Birthday hubba hubba hubby of mine!!!'</p>
