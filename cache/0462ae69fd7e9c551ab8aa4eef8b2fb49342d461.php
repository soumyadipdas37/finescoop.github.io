<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Bale is set for showdown talks with Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid over his future at the club.</p>

<p>The Welsh international hit out at Real Madrid in a recorded interview, for making it 'very difficult' for him to leave the club, and admitted he would consider a return to the Premier League.</p>

<p>Now Spanish newspaper Marca have reported that Manchester United are signing Bale, and Real Madrid are hoping that this will lead to an offer from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.</p>

<p>Gareth Bale is set for showdown talks with Zinedine Zidane as he looks to exit Real Madrid</p>

<p>The Welshman in an interview said Madrid were making it 'very difficult' for him to leave</p>

<p>Manchester United are reportedly interesting in bringing Bale back to the Premier League</p>

<p>The report states that Los Blancos are preparing 'operation exit' for the frustrated Welshman following his return from international duty.</p>

<p>It adds that Jose Mourinho would 'love to have' Bale at Tottenham, but chairman Daniel Levy has 'no money'.</p>

<p>While it is clear both parties believe it's better for the 31-year-old to leave the club, they have not had any offers as yet and there is the complicated issue that Madrid are unwilling to pay off the remaining two years of his salary.</p>

<p>Bale's €17million (£15.1m) salary over his remaining two years would mean Madrid would have to negotiate a possible €34m (£30.2m) pay-off which they are not in a position to do.</p>

<p>Following Bale's interview with Sky Sports, the winger and Zidane are set for an awkward face-to-face meeting to try and facilitate the end of his Madrid nightmare. </p>

<p>The Welsh international has has been frozen out of the Madrid set-up by Bernabeu boss Zinedine Zidane. </p>

<p>Gareth Bale has been froze out of the Real Madrid team making just 20 appearances last year</p>

<p>Marca state that Jose Mourinho is interested in Bale but that a move to Tottenham is unlikely</p>

<p>Bale, who joined Madrid in 2013 in a then world-record £85million deal from Tottenham, only played 20 times in all competitions last season and has become infuriated with the club's handling of his potential departure.</p>

<p>Speaking to Sky Sports, Bale also expressed frustration at Madrid thwarting his mega-money move to the Chinese Super League.</p>

<p>He said: 'Last year they blocked everything at the last second, so it was a project that I was excited for last year but it didn't materialise. There have been other incidents when we've tried to go but the club wouldn't allow it or have done something, so as for the club, what can I say. </p>

<p>'I want to play and I'm still motivated to play football so I guess it's on the club really. I can't really do much, they are in control of everything. I have a contract so all I can do is carry on doing what I'm doing and hopefully something comes up.</p>

<p>Zidane is keen to get Bale's wages off the books and facilitate a move for him to leave the club</p>

<p>'As I've said it's in the club's hands and they make it very difficult, to be honest.' </p>

<p>Asked if he is keen to move to the Premier League again, Bale added: 'As I said it's not really in my hands, I think it's one of those situations if offers arrived it would be something I'd look at for sure but we will have to see what happens. </p>

<p>'We have got plenty of time left in this transfer window and others as well but time will tell. Mainly the reason is the decision is in Real Madrid's hands.'</p>

<p>Bale is set for talks with Zidane on return to Real Madrid from international duty with Wales</p>

<p>Marca state that Bale's Madrid team-mates are 'indifferent' to the Welshman's situation as they already see him 'out of the club' after he was left out at games against Leganes and Manchester City at the end of last season.</p>

<p>Madrid are determined to offload some players also including James Rodriguez who is set for a move to Everton, so they can therefore spend on new players. </p>

<p>Manchester United have been linked with Bale on numerous occasions in recent years.</p>

<p>So far this summer, they have made just the one signing in Donny van de Beek from Ajax for £40m. </p>
