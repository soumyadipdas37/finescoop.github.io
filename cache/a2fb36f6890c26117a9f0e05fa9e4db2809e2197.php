<p>The 1984 single-engine plane left Horseshoe Bay Resort near Marble Falls, west of Austin, at 10am on Sunday.</p>

<p>Officials said that there were two couples on board the plane which was heading to Natchitoches, Louisiana Regional Airport, Louisiana. </p>

<p>Four people died in the plane crash at Hilltop Lakes, Texas, on Sunday</p>

<p>The police say that during the flight the plane developed engine trouble. It was attempting to make an emergency landing at Hilltop Lakes Airport, Texas.</p>

<p>The pilot had spoken to the Federal Aviation Administration before the crash to report the engine problems.</p>

<p>A witness told KBTX that the aircraft was flying extremely low to the ground and that once the pilot started to pull up the motor stopped.</p>

<p>The plane crashed near to the Hilltop Lakes stables north of Normangee around 10.45am.</p>

<p>Justin DeLeon, a Hilltop Lakes resident said: 'He got over the putt-putt area across from the stables.</p>

<p>'He banked left almost over-corrected and then banked right again and then he banked left one last time.</p>

<p>'When he did that second bank to the left he pretty much nose-dived straight vertical into the ground.' </p>

<p>DeLeon said he and one other man ran to the plane to see if they could help. </p>

<p>The plane's flight track shows the aircraft reaching 18,000 feet before it descended less than an hour into its flight.</p>

<p>The aircraft is registered to KMAC Bravo LLC in Lafayette, Louisiana.  </p>

<p>The identities of those killed in the accident have not been released.</p>
