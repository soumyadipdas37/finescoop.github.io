<p>Kim revealed the news on on Laura Wasser's iHeart Radio original podcast All's Fair.  </p>

<p>She said: 'You get your surrogate attorney, you get your surrogate broker and then the broker recommended that we use a therapist that would communicate with me first and then communicate with her and kind of be our liaison.' </p>

<p>During her surrogate pregnancy with Psalm, she opted to forego the therapist, 'because I kind of knew the drill.'    </p>

<p>As well as being a risk to her health, Kim admitted that she found pregnancy 'the worst experience of her life!'</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show is ending after 14 years on air.</p>

<p>Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which helped make Kim and her siblings Kourtney, Khloe, Kylie and Kendall household names and launched their careers in the fashion and beauty business, will air its last season early next year.</p>

<p>There was no reasons for the decision but E! said in a statement that it respects ‘the family's decision to live their lives without our cameras.’ In recent years numerous siblings, most recently Kourtney, have been reluctant to film the show. Kim has also endured a turbulent year with her husband Kanye West’s mental health battle and controversial presidential run putting unprecedented strain on her marriage.</p>

<p>Throughout the years the show chronicled key events in the personal and professional lives of the California family, including Kim Kardashian's marriages to Kris Humphries and West, an armed robbery in Paris, the break-up of Khloe Kardashian's marriage to basketball player Lamar Odom, and the transition of family patriarch Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn Jenner.</p>

<p>In an Instagram message posted on Tuesday, Kim, 39, wrote: 'To our amazing fans - It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians. </p>

<p>Shock announcement: Kim Kardashian shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show is ending after 14 years on air </p>

<p>'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children.</p>

<p>'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way. Thank you to the thousands of individuals and businesses that have been a part of this experience,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Kim added: 'Most importantly, a very special thank you to Ryan Seacrest for believing in us, E! for being our partner, and our production team at Bunim/Murray, who've spent countless hours documenting our lives.</p>

<p>'Our last season will air early next year in 2021. Without Keeping Up with The Kardashians, I wouldn't be where I am today. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has watched and supported me and my family these past 14 incredible years.'</p>

<p>Where it all began: Above is a picture of the first viewing party for Keeping Up with the Kardashians way back in 2007 ahead of it airing on E! for the first time</p>

<p>'This show made us who we are and I will be forever in debt to everyone who played a role in shaping our careers and changing our lives forever. With Love and Gratitude, Kim.'</p>

<p>The E! reality show first premiered in 2007, originated with Ryan Seacrest, who served as an executive producer </p>

<p>In April this year, it was claimed the show had its lowing viewing figures which had sunk to under 900k. </p>

<p>At its peak, 10.5 million viewers tuned in to watch Kim's ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011.</p>

<p>The series will return for season 19 on Thursday, Sept. 17 followed by one last season in 2021. </p>
