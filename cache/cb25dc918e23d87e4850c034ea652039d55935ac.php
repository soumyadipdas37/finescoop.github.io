<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester City defender Angelino has confirmed he rejected interest from Barcelona to return to RB Leipzig.</p>

<p>Left back Angelino re-joined Leipzig for a second spell last week, in another loan deal with the Bundesliga side having an option to buy him next summer for around £16million.</p>

<p>The Spaniard, 23, impressed in his first stint during the second half of last season, helping Leipzig finish third and reach a Champions League semi-final putting him on the radar of a number of clubs including the LaLiga giants.</p>

<p>Angelino rejected a switch to Barcelona to secure a second spell on loan with RB Leipzig</p>

<p>But he said the chance to work with Leipzig's highly-rated manager Julian Nagelsmann once more was too good to turn down.</p>

<p>'It's great that one of the biggest clubs in the world wanted me,' Angelino told Sport Bild.</p>

<p>'But in my head it was always clear: I want to stay with RB and not at another club - no matter who it was about. Leipzig suits me, the club's high goals fascinate me. I'm just as hungry as the club.</p>

<p>'The coach is one of the main reasons for me. I was enthusiastic about his idea and the way he played from the start. We really have a great relationship with each other. He often told me that he wanted to keep me, that I was an important part of the team. As a player, it just makes you feel good when you are really needed. I felt that connection throughout the club from day one. But my team-mates also made it easy for me to get my best performance straight away.'</p>

<p>The chance to work with Julian Nagelsmann (right) again proved too good for him to turn down</p>

<p>Angelino played 12 times for City last season under Pep Guardiola before making his first move to Leipzig and said the Etihad boss and his current manager have similar approaches.</p>

<p>'We play like Manchester City. Pep Guardiola and Julian Nagelsmann have the same style,' Angelino said.</p>

<p>'But I've made a lot of tactical improvements - especially my positional play. The entire coaching team has already helped me a lot. Nagelsmann wants his full-backs, including me, to score and set up more goals.</p>

<p>'In my strongest season in Holland [at PSV], I had twelve assists. Achieving or surpassing that would be good. But of course the Bundesliga is different.</p>

<p>'The aim is that I keep the shape I was in last season. Then I can do my part to ensure that we achieve great things with the team.' </p>

<p>Angelino is enjoying himself in Germany and appeared in their Champions League semi-final</p>
