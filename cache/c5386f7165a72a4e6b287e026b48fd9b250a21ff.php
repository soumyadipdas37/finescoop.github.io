<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They delighted fans when they reunited for a tour in 2019.</p>

<p>And now the Spice Girls are thought to be planning another treat to mark their 25th anniversary - by remaking the Wannabe video. </p>

<p>However although Mel B, Geri Horner, Emma Bunton and Mel C are up for the revival, it is 'exceedingly unlikely' that Victoria Beckham will involved, reports The Sun. </p>

<p>Big occasion! The Spice Girls are thought to be planning to remake their Wannabe video to mark their 25th anniversary in 2021 (pictured in the 1996 video)</p>

<p>A source has revealed that the Spice Girls had hoped they could tour next year to mark their 25th anniversary but are now trying to think of something else to do. </p>

<p>They said: 'The Spice Girls were hoping to hit the road in 2021 to mark their big anniversary but now it’s not possible because of the pandemic.   </p>

<p>'Mel C suggested doing something around Wannabe — including the idea of possibly re-working the video for social media.</p>

<p>'There are so many options and nothing is off-limits. They want to give the fans something special.' </p>

<p>Girl power: Wannabe became the band's best-selling song after it was released in 1996 (they are pictured together during the 50th Cannes Film Festival in 1997)</p>

<p>Iconic: The video was shot on the staircase of the former Midland Grand Hotel in St Pancras, London, and has become a fan favourite</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives of all the Spice Girls to ask for a comment.</p>

<p>Wannabe was a huge hit for The Spice Girls and became their best-selling song after it was released in 1996. </p>

<p>The now iconic video was shot on the staircase of the former Midland Grand Hotel in St Pancras, London.</p>

<p>And in January 2019 Emma returned to the filming location to snap a picture of herself on the staircase, which she called a 'special place'.  </p>

<p>It comes after Mel C was grilled about the rumours of another reunion with Geri, Mel B and Emma while talking to Zoe Ball on her Radio 2 Breakfast Show recently. </p>

<p>Tour: Mel B, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell and Melanie C reunited for a string of live dates last year and it is thought they had hoped to do something similar in 2021 (pictured in Dublin, 2019)</p>

<p>Fifth member Victoria Beckham turned down the 2019 tour as she wanted to focus on her family and fashion company. </p>

<p>Addressing the speculation, Mel admitted that the Spice Girls have been 'constantly talking' about a big world tour next year.</p>

<p>She said: 'Ooh, do you know what, I wish, I wish. I think we all do, like all artists including myself with my solo stuff, we're just having to wait and see what happens. </p>

<p>'You know, the Spice shows are so huge and so many tours have been moved to next year. We're talking about it constantly so as soon as we have any news on that front I will let you know.' </p>

<p>In April, Mel C again hinted she would love to see the group head back on the road, following the huge success of their UK reunion tour last year. </p>

<p>Memories: Emma visited the now iconic Wannabe staircase in London back in January 2019</p>

<p>While only recently, Emma revealed that all five of the Spice Girls reunited for a socially-distanced walk in the woods.</p>

<p>Speaking on her Sunday evening Heart FM radio show, Emma told listeners that herself, Mel B and Victoria were joined by Mel C and Geri Horner for a hike.</p>

<p>Referring to the COVID-19 lockdown, Baby Spice said: 'As things slowly, slowly start to get back to normal and we've all started to meet up with friends again haven't we? </p>

<p>'Which is strange… I actually started to think I would never see them again… well unless it was on Zoom calls. And this week, yes, I finally got to meet up with Geri, Mel B, Mel C and Victoria!</p>

<p>'Now you may think we propped up a bar somewhere or had drinks in the garden but no! We went on a social distancing walk in the woods, yes!' </p>

<p>Viva forever: Despite coronavirus appearing to have thrown off some of the plans, the band are said to be in 'constant talks' and trying to come up with something special for their 25th anniversary (Mel B, Mel C, Emma and Geri in 2018)</p>
