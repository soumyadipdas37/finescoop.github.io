<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A highly-paid businessman who raped a drunken backpacker he picked up walking home has been brutally bashed in prison.  </p>

<p>Alan George Vico, 54, was hospitalised with multiple facial fractures following the violent incident and required surgery.</p>

<p>Vico use to command a $290,000 annual salary while working for Ports North in Far North Queensland before his arrest.</p>

<p>He is now serving a five and a half year jail sentence at the Lotus Glen Correctional Centre west of Cairns where the assault took place on September 17.</p>

<p>Vico was jailed in the Cairns District Court last month following the opportunistic rape of a Norwegian backpacker in September 2018.</p>

<p>A Queensland Corrective Services spokesman confirmed the bashing remains under investigation.</p>

<p>'QCS (Queensland Corrective Services) can confirm a prisoner in his 50s was transferred to hospital on September 17 after being assaulted by another prisoner,' he told the Cairns Post.</p>

<p>'He is being treated for facial injuries and remains in hospital.</p>

<p>'The matter will be reviewed by CSIU (Corrective Services Investigation Unit).' </p>

<p>Vico has formally launched an appeal against his conviction and sentence, arguing the outcome from the judge-only trial was 'manifestly excessive'. </p>

<p>A jury could not be used due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>Judge Julie Dick reserved her decision for more than two months before finding Vico guilty in late August.</p>

<p>She ordered he serve half of his sentence before being eligible for parole.</p>

<p>Court documents revealed Vico picked up the highly intoxicated female tourist on the side of the road in his car in Cairns North two years ago before driving her to a nearby hotel in Earlville.  </p>

<p>The 20-year-old woke up naked and alone the next morning, unaware how she made her to the motel. </p>

<p>The woman, who cannot be named, then discovered an empty condom packet and a $20 note on the bedside table.</p>

<p>Vico took the used condoms from the motel room, which were later found by police in his bin at home. </p>

<p>DNA from Vico and the victim was discovered on the discarded condoms. A date for Vico's appeal is still to be determined.</p>
