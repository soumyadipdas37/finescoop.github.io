<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ex-Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness believes Liverpool and Manchester United are 'blackmailing' the Champions League winners over the signing of Thiago Alcantara.</p>

<p>The Spanish international has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League this summer, and has made it known to the German club that he wants to explore a new challenge with just a year left on his contract. </p>

<p>Premier League champions Liverpool are the frontrunners, with United also interested, but Hoeness has accused the two English clubs of underhand tactics in order to sign the 29-year-old for a cheaper fee later in the window. </p>

<p>Ex-Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness has accused Liverpool and Man Utd of 'blackmail'</p>

<p>Bayern midfielder Thiago is keen for a new challenge with just a year left on his current deal</p>

<p>'It is a difficult situation,' he told German outlet Sport1. </p>

<p>'A while ago we agreed on a new four-year contract. Some days later he said: "I'm looking for a new challenge." Which is totally okay. </p>

<p>'I think he obviously has an agreement with Liverpool or Manchester United or both of them. Now both clubs are bluffing, and no one has contacted Bayern Munich officially.</p>

<p>'From my point of view, that has no style. They're trying to blackmail us, by waiting until the last week, when they're going to make a cheap offer.</p>

<p>The Bayern Munich midfielder has been linked with Anfield for the entirety of the summer</p>

<p>'In that case FC Bayern have to ask themselves the question: do they want to go along with that or do they tell the player that he has to stay. It's going to be a hot three weeks until [the transfer window closes on] October 5.' </p>

<p>The 68-year-old added that he felt uncomfortable with the manner in which top European clubs now communicated with regards to signings.  </p>

<p>'At this time, there is a style evolving, even between the big clubs, which I did not know until now,' Hoeness added. </p>

<p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp last week refused to completely rule out a summer deal for Thiago.</p>

<p>'If I could invent a word that would end speculation I think I could become really rich,' Klopp joked. </p>

<p>'I cannot end speculation as long as the transfer window is open so that's all really I can say. Did I mention Thiago Alcantara is a really good player? Long ago already!</p>

<p>'It's nice we are linked with him but that's pretty much all really. It's because he's a good player and Liverpool is big club so that's nice.'</p>
