<p>An eight-year-old girl who was killed by a falling tree branch that left her sister needing life-saving brain surgery has been pictured.</p>

<p>Maisy Mayne died from severe head trauma in the freak accident and her sister Isla also had to be airlifted to hospital.</p>

<p>Emergency services rushed to the public footpath on the edge of a remote crop field shortly after 12pm on August 21 in Bobbing, near Sittingbourne, Kent.</p>

<p>But Maisy was pronounced dead at the scene after an air ambulance landed nearby.</p>

<p>A fundraising page set up on funeralguide.com said: 'In loving memory of Maisy Elizabeth Susan Mayne who was tragically taken on August 21, 2020, aged 8 years.</p>

<p>'Our Maisy, our beautiful girl and amazing big sister to William and Isla.</p>

<p>'We will miss you so, so much darling xxxx</p>

<p>'We have set up these charities to donate to because the Kings hospital saved Isla's life after needing brain surgery from this tragic accident.'</p>

<p>It added: 'The air ambulance for treating her at the scene and getting her to the hospital.</p>

<p>'The Rhys Daniels charity have given us a place to stay right by the hospital so we can be with Isla whilst she recovers.</p>

<p>'All of these are amazing charities and without them we'd have lost both our girls x Thank you'</p>

<p>So far at least £5,400 has been raised for the charities on the page. An inquest into Maisy's death was opened at County Hall in Maidstone last week.</p>

<p>Emergency services rushed to the public footpath (pictured) on the edge of a remote crop field shortly after 12pm on August 21 in Bobbing, near Sittingbourne, Kent</p>

<p>She said the primary school pupil from Sittingbourne suffered a 'traumatic head injury when a tree branch fell on her' and gave the cause of death as 'severe head trauma'.</p>

<p>An uncle paid tribute to her in a floral tribute left by the collapsed tree, with a note attached to a bouquet.</p>

<p>It said: 'To my beautiful niece, I love you. May you rest in peace. Love your uncle and beautiful cousins.'</p>

<p>A white teddy bear was also later tied to a fence post in Maisy's memory. A second child was also airlifted to King's College Hospital in London with serious injuries.</p>

<p>A witness described a woman running towards her pleading for help in a desperate bid to save the children.</p>

<p>She said: 'I heard this woman shouting as she came running across the field with no shoes on so I walked over.</p>

<p>'She rushed towards me and was screaming for anyone to help. The woman started crying and said her niece had just been hit by a tree.</p>

<p>'I asked her if she was alright. She seemed very, very panicked. As I walked up and down trying to help her, at least 15 emergency service vehicles came flying past me.'</p>

<p>A neighbour, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: 'When I saw the air ambulance was there for almost two hours, I knew it was either too late or something serious.</p>

<p>'I say hello when I pass the family involved and they seem like really nice people. I hope the other child will pull through.'</p>

<p>Councillor Corrie Woodford, who represents the Bobbing, Iwade and Lower Halstow ward on Swale Borough Council, said: 'My condolences go out to everybody involved.</p>

<p>'It's so heartbreaking for the family and friends and they are all in my thoughts.'</p>

<p>The inquest was adjourned until November 17 in Maidstone.</p>
