<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you're already planning for next year's holiday, here's a simple hack that will get you 48 days off using only 18 days of annual leave.  </p>

<p>For many of us, this year's holidays have been anti-climatic due to the 160 plus days the UK has spent in lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, but for those already looking ahead, next year could be more promising.</p>

<p>Instant Office has revealed how you can cleverly book around the remaining bank holidays and weekends this year and next year.</p>

<p>So while you won't actually get any more time off work, it will feel like you are as you'll be getting longer holiday breaks with minimal days off used. </p>

<p>Cash in on Christmas...</p>

<p>With both Christmas Day (2020) and New Year's Day (2021) falling on a Friday, this is your chance to bridge the gap to create a solid break of 10 days by booking the days between them off. </p>

<p>Those who work Monday to Friday can use just three days of annual leave to book the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday between the bank holidays - giving the total of ten consecutive days off in a row - including weekends.   </p>

<p>Book: December 29, 30, 31 - for a ten day break.</p>

<p>Have an easy-going Easter...</p>

<p>For another ten day break, book off the days between Good Friday and Easter Monday.</p>

<p>Good Friday will fall on April 2 with Easter Monday on April 5, so combined with weekends, you can enjoy another long stretch by booking the four days off from Tuesday April 6 to Friday April 9. </p>

<p>Book: April 6, 7, 8, 9 - for a ten day stretch. </p>

<p>Christmas and New Year's Day can be enjoyed in one long stretch if you follow the tips. Pictured, stock image</p>

<p>May Day your holiday away...  </p>

<p>Enjoy nine days off by booking another four days of holiday after this year's May Day, Monday May 3.</p>

<p>Book: May 4, 5, 6, 7 - for a nine day break.    </p>

<p>Summer holiday with the kids? </p>

<p>Here you can enjoy nine days off by using just four days of your holiday allowance following the August bank holiday on August 30. A perfect opportunity to get away during the school summer holidays.</p>

<p>Book: August 31, September 1, 2, 3 - a nine day break.</p>

<p>Now that's the festive spirit! Christmas 2021...</p>

<p>Again, workers can bag a ten day break by only booking three days of annual leave. With Christmas falling on a Saturday and Boxing Day on a Sunday, the substitute bank holidays will be December 27 and 29.</p>

<p>The same is true for New Years Day (2022), which will fall on a Saturday, meaning January 3 is the substitute bank holiday.</p>

<p>Book: December 29, 30, 31 to enjoy a ten day break.  </p>
