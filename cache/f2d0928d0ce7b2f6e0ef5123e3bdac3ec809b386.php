<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi is facing a prison sentence of more than two years if he is convicted in his World Cup TV rights bribery trial. </p>

<p>Al-Khelaifi is accused of offering former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke use of his villa in Sardinia, Italy, as a favour ahead of the television rights process for the 2026 and 2030 competitions.</p>

<p>The Swiss Federal Criminal Court in Bellinzona was told on Tuesday that beIN Media Group was awarded the rights in Middle East and Africa, without being put up for tender. </p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain owner Nasser al-Khelaifi could face prison if he loses his bribery case </p>

<p>The chairman of beIN Sport faces charges relating to the awarding of FIFA World Cup rights</p>

<p>Al-Khelaifi is also the chairman of the Qatari broadcast group, who insist they paid full market value for the rights.  </p>

<p>According to reports from the proceedings, Valcke requested help buying the Italian house during the negotiations between FIFA and beIN.</p>

<p>Al-Khelaifi then bought the property for €5million, before handing it over to a close associate's brother, from whom Valcke gained access to it.</p>

<p>Former FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke (left) is also in the dock in Switzerland</p>

<p>The value of the rent Valcke avoided paying is argued to be about £1.66million. </p>

<p>Prosecutors have called for a 28-month sentence for Al-Khelaifi if he is found guilty. They have asked for a three-year sentence for Valcke if the same verdict is passed on him. </p>

<p>Both men deny the charges and the trial continues.  </p>
