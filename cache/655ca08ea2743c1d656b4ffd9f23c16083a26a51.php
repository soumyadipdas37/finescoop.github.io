<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Unilever is a step closer to establishing a sole UK headquarters after Dutch shareholders backed the consolidation plans. </p>

<p>Since its creation via merger in 1930, the Anglo-Dutch group behind Dove soap and Marmite has had bases in London and Rotterdam. </p>

<p>But under plans approved by investors in the Netherlands yesterday, there would be just a single legal base in the UK. It has stressed this will not affect its overall presence in either country. </p>

<p>Switch: Since its creation via merger in 1930, the Anglo-Dutch group behind Dove soap and Marmite has had bases in London and Rotterdam</p>

<p>Unilever wants the changes, which it says will make its structure simple and easier for the purposes of deal-making, to take effect from November 22. </p>

<p>And the final step is to win approval from British shareholders in a vote on October 12, which is expected to pass easily. </p>

<p>Unilever began its push to restructure under previous management after a failed £112billion takeover approach by US rival Kraft Heinz in 2017.</p>

<p>It tried to base its headquarters in Rotterdam but changed course after a Mail campaign and opposition from investors. </p>

<p>Chief executive Alan Jope said Unilever would press on despite recent proposals from a Dutch opposition party to impose an 'exit tax' if it quits the Netherlands. </p>

<p>The company's lawyers believe the move would violate international law. However, Unilever has said it could cancel the changes if the law was passed. </p>

<p>Shares in the consumer goods group fell by 1.7 per cent. </p>
