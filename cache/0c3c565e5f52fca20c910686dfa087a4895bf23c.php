<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump was asked Wednesday if he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power after the November election – and declined to do so.</p>

<p>'Well, we’ll have to see what happens,' said Trump, when pressed on the matter at the White House.</p>

<p>It was a similar comment to those he made in 2016 when asked similar questions.</p>

<p>After refusing to go along with a pledge, the president attacked Democrats and delivered swipes that appeared to be directed at mail-in voting, the subject of his frequent attacks at the White House and at campaign rallies.</p>

<p>'Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very peaceful – there won’t be a transfer frankly, there’ll be a continuation,' President Donald Trump said, in a likely reference to mail-in ballots</p>

<p>'Win lose or draw in this election will you commit here today for a peaceful transferal of power after the election?' Trump was asked at the top of his press briefing. </p>

<p>'Well, we’ll have to see what happens,' Trump replied – entertaining the question, but also refusing to commit.    </p>

<p>'You know that. I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster,' he said, in a likely reference to mail-in ballots. Trump regularly says they are rife with fraud, although a handful of states use them for elections.    </p>

<p>'Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very peaceful – there won’t be a transfer frankly, there’ll be a continuation,' Trump said.</p>

<p>He continued: 'The ballots are out of control. You know if. And you know who knows it better than anybody else, the Democrats,' he said.</p>

<p>The president quickly moved on to other questions about the coronavirus and charges for an officer involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.</p>

<p>The president's dodge came on a day when the Atlantic published an article titled The Election that Could Break America that played out scenarios where Trump would refuse to accept results amid court cases and recounts, and rejects the outcome even if rival Joe Biden appears to have won or be within sight of prevailing in the Electoral Colleg. </p>
