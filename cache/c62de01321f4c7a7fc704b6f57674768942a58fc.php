<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Juventus have reportedly lost patience with injury-prone winger Douglas Costa, leading Andrea Pirlo to put the Brazilian up for sale amid his Turin clear-out.    </p>

<p>Over-30s Blaise Matuidi, Gonzalo Higuain, Miralem Pjanic and Sami Khedira have all been kicked-out since the legendary Italian's appointment, with Pirlo keen for a refresh after Juve's Champions League last-16 exit to Lyon. </p>

<p>Costa is set to be next to go, according to Goal, despite the 29-year-old's desperation to stay and prove his worth under the new coach. </p>

<p>Juventus want to sell Douglas Costa this summer after the winger's persistent injury troubles</p>

<p>The Brazilian had four spells on the sidelines last season, continuing a trend for the star </p>

<p>The Brazilian could get his wish and remain in Italy, though, with his agents having reportedly failed to encourage interest. </p>

<p>Manchester United have long been linked to the star and clubs in the UAE Pro League are said to be interested, but Costa's injury record is causing hesitation. </p>

<p>The winger has made more than 30 league appearances in a season just once since his move to the European elite with Bayern Munich in 2015. </p>

<p>Andrea Pirlo is conducting a clear-out at Juventus, having already moved on four big names</p>

<p>Muscle trouble meant Costa spent four spells sidelined with injury in 2019-20, leaving him with just 23 Serie A appearances at the conclusion. The 2018-19 season was worse, playing just 17 league matches. </p>

<p>Costa's impact has waned as a result, scoring just four goals and contributing eight assists in two seasons. </p>

<p>With two years left on the Brazilian's deal, it would seem a wise move for Juventus to cash-in on the winger. </p>

<p>Costa's injury record is counting against him in the market, struggling to attract interest </p>
