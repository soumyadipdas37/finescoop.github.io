<p>Report: According to TMZ, law enforcement sources have said the actor got into a verbal altercation with a man in June in Los Angeles (pictured in November 2019) </p>

<p>Shia has had run-ins with the law in the past and was previously arrested for a druken scuffle in New York City in 2017.</p>

<p>He was also arrested in the same year for disorderly conduct in Savannah, Georgia when he became aggressive towards a police officer he had asked for a cigarette. </p>

<p>In 2014, he was arrested after disturbing a performance of the musical Cabaret on Broadway in New York.</p>

<p>He pled guilty to a disorderly conduct violation and he then received outpatient care for alcohol addiction.</p>

<p>Argument: An insider told the publication that after the heated argument was over, Shia took off the man's cap and left the scene with it (pictured in February 2020)</p>

<p>That same year, Shia spoke to Interview magazine and admitted: 'I've been going through an existential crisis.'</p>

<p>According to the star his behaviour and drug and alcohol use, as well as acting, has been his way to escape.</p>

<p>He said: 'I've been a runner my whole life, running from myself. Whether to movies or drinking and drugging or f***ing calamity or whatever it is, I've always been running.'       </p>

<p>At the time, Shia credit his film Fury, in which he plays a soldier who relies on his faith to get him through WWII, for helping him look at changing his ways.</p>

<p>More recently, the actor dropped out of Olivia Wilde's Don't Worry, Darling earlier this month over scheduling conflicts, according to Deadline.</p>

<p>He was replaced by Harry Styles, who joins Dakota Johnson, Florence Pugh and Chris Pine in the cast of the psychological thriller. </p>
