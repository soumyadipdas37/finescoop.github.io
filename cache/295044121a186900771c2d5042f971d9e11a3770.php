<p>But study co-author Daniele Silvestro, of Gothenburg University in Sweden, said: ‘We find essentially no evidence for climate-driven extinctions during the past 126,000 years.</p>

<p>‘Instead, we found that human impact explains 96 per cent of all mammal extinctions during that time.’</p>

<p>The study, published in the journal Science Advances, added that human-caused climate change and other human-related threats posed a large risk for many species.</p>
