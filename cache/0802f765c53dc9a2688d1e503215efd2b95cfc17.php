<p> An American tourist drops her brand new iPhone 11 into Lake Annecy, Haute-Savoie, in the French Alps while paragliding 5,000ft in the air on Wednesday</p>

<p>She was shooting her own video on the phone while holding it on a selfie stick when the accident happened.</p>

<p>In the video, the woman soars through the sky looking towards the alpine mountain range in the distance.</p>

<p>She brings the phone towards her to turn on the video setting before holding it out in front of her.</p>

<p>The woman extends her arm out to the left and lets out a whoop, saying: 'I'm flying.'</p>

<p>This was not the first time a tourist has lost their iPhone while on holiday, as last September a man known by his surname, Zhou, dropped his in a river in China.</p>

<p>A Chinese man who accidentally dropped his phone in a river during a canoeing trip has miraculously retrieved the handset eight months later – and it still works perfectly. The picture shows the phone being mailed to Mr Zhou after a local fisherman found it</p>

<p>The tourist (pictured), known by his surname Zhou, lost his smartphone when he was catching some fish with his friend on a turbulent river in China last September</p>

<p>Miraculously, Mr Zhou received his smartphone back eight months later in May in perfect working condition.</p>

<p>He received a phone call from a local fisherman who found his phone number on a business card in the phone case.</p>

<p>Mr Zhou was able to retrieve pictures taken during his canoeing trip from the phone he thought he would never find again.</p>

<p>'I never thought I'd find [the phone] again,' the tourist said in a social media post after retrieving the handset. </p>
