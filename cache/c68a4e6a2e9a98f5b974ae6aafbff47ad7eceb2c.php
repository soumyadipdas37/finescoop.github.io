<p>Big changes: The musician stunned fans when he lost a whopping five stone earlier this year following his rehab stint for cocaine addiction and alcohol abuse (L in May, R in 2018)</p>

<p>The TV star told The Sun on Sunday: 'I met Jason on the off chance and he called my bluff when I said I’d book in. So the next day I bought my flights and flew to his resort in Portugal. All I drank for a fortnight was juices.  </p>

<p>'I feel incredible and I’m determined to lose even more weight. I saw pictures of myself on the beach when lockdown ended and I came to Spain. I was shocked by how I looked. Now I just never want to go back to feeling that way.' </p>

<p>'It was the best thing I’ve ever done. I’ve struggled with my weight for years but this has really changed my outlook. I’m free from drink and drugs still, which is a huge achievement. And making sure I lose weight and get healthier is an ongoing goal.' </p>
