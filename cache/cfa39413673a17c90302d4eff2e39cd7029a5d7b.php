<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>With interest rates stuck at record lows, most savers cannot get their hands on the rewards they think they deserve.</p>

<p>Most High Street banks pay just 0.01 per cent interest - that's 10p a year on each £1,000 in an easy-access account.</p>

<p>But there is another option for cautious savers in search of a more generous return: investing.</p>

<p>Safer bet: As well as established FTSE companies, LifeStrategy funds also invest in government bonds and gold - assets that tend to be much less affected by economic turmoil</p>

<p>For many, the idea of investing is daunting, particularly after the most dramatic market movements in years and when fraud is on the rise.</p>

<p>Yet experts say there are lower-risk options available — managed by legitimate investment companies regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority — which savers can often overlook.</p>

<p>Laura Suter, personal finance analyst with AJ Bell, says the specialist funds allow cautious investors to avoid the risks associated with the stock market while still getting a better return than they would with their bank.</p>

<p>As well as established FTSE companies, the funds also invest in government bonds and gold — assets that tend to be much less affected by economic turmoil.</p>

<p>Investment firm Vanguard offers a number of options for investors looking to play it safe. Known as the LifeStrategy funds, they minimise risk by spreading investors' money across thousands of high-quality assets.</p>

<p>Some are also aimed at savers who might need access to their money soon, and are thus designed to deliver a slow and steady return.</p>

<p>These funds are unlikely to deliver the kind of market-beating gains that many experienced investors want — but can they get the average saver a better return on their money?</p>

<p>A £10,000 investment in the LifeStrategy 20 per cent Equity Fund five years ago would now be worth around £12,800.</p>

<p>At an average annual return of more than 4 per cent (after management fees have been deducted), it's well beyond the reach of High-Street easy-access savings accounts, where the best you can earn is 1 per cent with state-backed NS&amp;I's Direct Saver. Even with a top five-year fix from RCI Bank, the most you will get is 1.4 per cent.</p>

<p>But given the funds have benefited from strong economic conditions, what happens if markets take another turn for the worse?</p>

<p>Experts point to a handful of specialist funds aiming to deliver a return in even the most troubling circumstances — although, as with any investment, nothing is guaranteed.</p>

<p>The Personal Assets investment trust, run by Troy's Sebastian Lyon, is a popular 'hedge' for more experienced investors but also an option for risk-averse savers. </p>

<p>Given the fund focuses on safer investments such as government bonds, its value often increases in periods of uncertainty as the price of these assets rise.</p>

<p>This year, the fund has delivered an impressive return of 13 per cent since March, though its average performance is more modest. </p>

<p>Savers who invested £10,000 five years ago would now have around £12,500 after fees. These funds can be purchased through any of the major High-Street investment firms that offer tax-efficient stocks and shares Isas.</p>

<p>Savers can then manage their money online or on their smartphone. Telephone and in-person brokerages are also available but may charge higher fees.</p>

<p>Newcomers should take time to research the fees charged both by their platform — typically around 0.25 per cent per year on your entire portfolio - as well as those charged by individual fund managers. </p>

<p>Some low-risk funds have been criticised for charging management fees of around 2 per cent per year, eating into investors' gains.</p>

<p>These fees are sometimes performance dependent, meaning you'll only pay them if your investments actually grow.</p>

<p>Tom Stevenson, an investment director with Fidelity International, also cautions first-time investors against investing all their savings in one go or putting all of their eggs in one basket.</p>

<p>'Diversification is key in making sure that you are spreading your risk, as the likelihood that all assets will crash at the same time is slim,' he says.</p>

<p>Savers worried about managing their money can automate the process with so-called robo-investors, like London-based Nutmeg.</p>

<p>The platform has a number of options for cautious or first-time investors, says its savings and investment specialist Kat Mann.</p>

<p>'We ask our new customers questions to find how comfortable they are with risk and then suggest a portfolio that meets their tolerance,' she says.</p>

<p>The platform also allows savers to hold their money in cash, gradually transferring this into their investment portfolio.</p>

<p>Since launching in early 2017, its low-risk fixed portfolio has delivered 2.8 per cent annualised growth - easily beating even the best cash savings accounts.</p>

<p>However, no investment is risk free and savers should think about which options might be better for them and how much money they can afford to commit. </p>

<p>But if you're looking for a better return on your money, an investment portfolio is well worth considering.</p>
