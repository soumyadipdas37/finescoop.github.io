<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Julian NagelsmannÂ has put Europe's top clubs on alert by changing agents, leaving the company who represent Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp in the process.</p>

<p>RB Leipzig boss Nagelsmann was previously looked after by Marc Kosicke who counts Premier League winning manager Klopp among his clients.</p>

<p>But Nagelsmann's affairs will now be managed by SportsTotal, one of Europe's biggest agencies.</p>

<p>Specifically, one of the German-based firm's managing directors, Sascha Breese, will now represent Nagelsmann, 33 and a rising star in the managerial world.</p>

<p>Breese, whose clients include Toni Kroos, Dayot Upamecano and Niklas Sule, is understood to have strong links with Europe's biggest clubs, something which is likely to have appealed to Nagelsmann as he maps out his own managerial career.</p>

<p>Nagelsmann only took over at Leipzig last summer and is on a long contract that runs until 2023.</p>

<p>But his achievements at such a young age has already put him on the map and his progress is being closely followed by numerous clubs in Germany and across the continent, including in England.</p>

<p>Nagelsmann turned to coaching after seeing his playing career at Augsburg cut short by injury aged 20.</p>

<p>The promise he quickly showed as a coach earned him the nickname 'Baby Mourinho'.</p>

<p>Nagelsmann became the youngest manager in Bundesliga history when he was appointed by Hoffenheim at 28.</p>

<p>He led them from second bottom to well clear of safety after taking over in February 2016, fourth and into the Champions League for the first time in his first full campaign the following year and then third in 2017-18.</p>

<p>Having been knocked out in the play-offs by Liverpool in 2017-18, their third-placed league finish earned Hoffenheim a Champions League group stage place for the first time ever.</p>

<p>Nagelsmann's managerial rise continued when he took over at RB Leipzig in June 2019. In his first season he led them to a third-place Bundesliga finish and the Champions League semi-finals.</p>
