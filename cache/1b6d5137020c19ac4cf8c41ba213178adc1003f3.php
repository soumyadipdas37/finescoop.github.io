<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Frank Lampard has admitted he will fight to boost Kepa Arrizabalaga's brittle confidence after the goalkeeper's latest mistake in Chelsea's 2-0 Premier League loss to Liverpool.</p>

<p>Sadio Mane blocked Kepa's laboured clearance and tapped home his second goal as 10-man Chelsea succumbed to Jurgen Klopp's defending Premier League champions at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>Andreas Christensen's red card handed Liverpool an advantage they fully exploited, but Blues boss Lampard conceded Kepa was at fault for the second goal - and is in desperate need of a confidence boost.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard says he will try to restore Kepa Arrizabala (above)'s form after another error</p>

<p>Kepa gifted the ball to Sadio Mane for his second goal in Chelsea's 2-0 loss to Liverpool </p>

<p>Lampard revealed veteran Willy Caballero will start Wednesday's League Cup clash with Barnsley at Stamford Bridge, but insisted that was always the plan, even before Kepa's latest costly error.</p>

<p>'It's a clear mistake that has cost us,' said Lampard. 'Because we went on to have a penalty that things could be different if we score, and fine margins like that change games.</p>

<p>'So we have to keep working, Kepa has to keep working and he has to have support around him, that's very clear. But it was a clear mistake on the day.</p>

<p>Lampard recognised the blunder as a key mistake but says he will support his goalkeeper</p>

<p>'And now we've got to try to give him confidence, because that's important. It's a clear mistake, he's accepted that and we have to hold our hands up to that.</p>

<p>'I can say now that Willy Caballero will play against Barnsley, and that was always my feeling to play him on Wednesday, regardless of today. So I don't want people to make judgements on that game itself.</p>

<p>'He's our player and it's clear now from the two games, today was a clear mistake and there was a mistake at Brighton as well, and he's reflected on that in that way.</p>

<p>Lampard said Willy Caballero (above) will replace Kepa in goal against Barnsley in midweek</p>

<p>'So we have to keep working, that's the rules of football, difficult times, individually players need support, particularly from myself and I give that to all the players. So we have to keep working.</p>

<p>'Nobody tries to make mistakes in football, that's the nature of the game. So we have to be strong and keep going.'</p>

<p>Rennes stopper Edouard Mendy is close to completing a move to Chelsea, but Lampard has upheld his policy of refusing to talk about players from other clubs.</p>

<p>The Blues are close to confirming a £20million deal for Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy</p>

<p>Kepa's poor form from last term has spilled into the new campaign however, and the £72million signing in 2018 appears to face a hugely uncertain future at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>'I don't have news on the Mendy one so I'll stay away from that,' said Lampard. 'Until anything's confirmed you should never speak on other players, so that's that.'</p>

<p>Liverpool dominated Chelsea once the Blues were reduced to 10 men, with new boy Thiago Alcantara impressing off the bench after replacing Jordan Henderson.</p>
