<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder has jokingly told Gareth Bale to stay in Madrid because he doesn't want to face the Wales star in the Premier League.</p>

<p>Bale could be on his way back to Tottenham Hotspur with the London club in negotiations with Real Madrid over a sensational return.</p>

<p>And Wilder clearly appreciates the winger's qualities, believing even at 31 he has the ability to terrorise opposition defenders.</p>

<p>Gareth Bale could be on the verge of a sensational return to Tottenham from Real Madrid </p>

<p>Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder jokingly urged Bale to stay in Madrid and play golf</p>

<p>He said: 'I said it when we came into the Premier League and there was talk about Eden Hazard going to Real Madrid. I said I'd give him a taxi to the airport!</p>

<p>'Hopefully Gareth stays in Madrid, it's a lovely place and there are some lovely golf courses... don't make it any harder for us!</p>

<p>'I'm not surprised he wants to come and play in the Premier League. We've had some great experiences and a lot of Spurs fans will want it to happen.</p>

<p>'I can't imagine there are many Sheffield United fans hoping that happens, though, because it just gives us another challenge.'</p>

<p>The Blades don't face Tottenham until January 16, at Bramall Lane, with the return fixture scheduled for May 1.</p>

<p>The Wales star's love of golf is well known and he often enjoys playing on the courses of Madrid</p>

<p>The Wales star spent six seasons at Spurs before a world record £86m move to Real in 2013</p>

<p>By that time, Bale could be back in the groove as a Tottenham player with the north London club in pole position ahead of Manchester United to bring him back to England.</p>

<p>Bale has fallen out of favour at Real and the Spanish club are even willing to pay half of his £500,000-a-week wages to facilitate his Bernabeu exit.</p>

<p>Even if Tottenham only have to pay Bale £250,000-a-week, he would still be the club's highest earner. </p>

<p>Despite helping Real win four Champions League titles during his seven years with the club, Bale has been criticised heavily by fans and the Spanish media in recent years.</p>

<p>Bale has won four Champions League titles at Real but has recently fallen out of favour</p>

<p>Bale's relationship with Real manager Zinedine Zidane has become increasingly frosty</p>

<p>Bale caused a storm of criticism when he posed with a 'Wales. Golf Madrid. In that order' flag</p>

<p>His love of golf and time he spends on the courses of Madrid has been one source of criticism with his Real team-mates nicknaming him 'The Golfer.'</p>

<p>Fans weren't impressed when Bale posed with a Welsh flag with the words 'Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order' after they secured qualification for Euro 2020 last November.</p>
