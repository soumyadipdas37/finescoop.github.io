<p>The actress and TikTok sensation, 19, exuded confidence as she posed up a storm in the tiny bottoms and a silver tiara during a recent day golfing. </p>

<p>Glowing: Maisie Smith looked sensational as she showed off her toned figure in a pair of skin-tight hot pants and a tiara in two new Instagram snaps shared on Sunday</p>

<p>Maisie cut a colourful figure in her snaps as she also donned a bright purple long-sleeved t-shirt with Spider-Man on the front.</p>

<p>The beauty wore her stunning auburn tresses down and let her curls cascade over her shoulders as she posed with a golf club resting on one shoulder.</p>

<p>She accessorised her ensemble with a silver tiara and accentuated her pretty features with a slick of pink lipstick.</p>

<p>Maisie also shared snaps from her golfing trip last Wednesday which revealed she completed her sporty look with some white trainers.</p>

<p>Poser: The actress put on a colourful display in yellow shorts and a long-sleeved purple t-shirt</p>

<p>Work it: Maisie posed with a golf club over one shoulder as she took a break from showing off her sporting skills for the quick photoshoot</p>

<p>It comes after Maisie was announced as joining the Strictly Come Dancing line-up, alongside Jamie Laing, Clara Amfo and Bill Bailey.</p>

<p>Maisie's signing to Strictly comes despite her being under investigation for smoking a 'strong-smelling cigarette'. </p>

<p>The actress was at the centre of controversy over the summer, when she was spotted smoking at the wheel of her car.   </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'It is unthinkable that Strictly would sign her after the few weeks she has had. The show is the pinnacle of the BBC and gives rising stars and established ones a huge step to more fame. </p>

<p>New signing: Maisie was recently announced as one of the 12 contestants taking part in the upcoming series of Strictly Come Dancing</p>

<p>'So it’s very weird to give someone whose future was very unclear just weeks ago such an opportunity. Perhaps they see it as a way of nailing down a rising star rather than her leaving and taking with her a young audience.'</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for Maisie and Strictly Come Dancing for comment at the time.</p>

<p>Maisie was also revealed as being investigated by BBC bosses after she was spotted smoking the cigarette in question.</p>

<p>The Sun reported that bosses were 'angry' and 'extremely disappointed' after Maisie was caught with the  hand-rolled cigarette, after pulling over on an empty road in Essex on July 19. </p>

<p>Golfer: Maisie also shared snaps from her golfing outing on Wednesday</p>

<p>While on Sunday night a new report alleged that a former crew member had tested positive for coronavirus, just days before recording on the new series of the BBC show is set to begin.</p>

<p>As a result 'everyone was told to leave,' according to a source, who also claimed that the set was given a powerful deep clean as show bosses await the results of a third medical test on the lighting expert.  </p>

<p>According to The Sun, the lighting expert spent a week working on the dance contest's set.</p>

<p>Not impressed: Maisie, who plays Tiffany Butcher in EastEnders, has been signed to Strictly  despite her being under investigation for smoking a 'strong-smelling cigarette'</p>

<p>Following his positive test result, at least five staff who were in close contact with him were sent home and told to self-isolate and await tests of their own, according to the report. </p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'The crew member is no longer on the production and has had a negative NHS test result.</p>

<p>'Procedures were followed and stringent protocols have been put in place just in case, but recording isn't due to happen until later this week so there is minimal impact.'</p>
