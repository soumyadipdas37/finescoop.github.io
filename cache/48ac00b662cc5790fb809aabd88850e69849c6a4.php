<p>Office for National Statistics data shows people with office jobs are looking to leave built-up areas for the countryside.</p>

<p>The news will be another nail in the coffin for the embattled high street as potential customers plan their exodus.</p>

<p>The report, made up of surveys tracking the impact of Covid-19, found 29 per cent of adults in employment have 'changed their work location during the pandemic and are planning on continuing to work from home at least some of the time'.</p>

<p>It added: 'Among those planning to work from home all or part of the time, 12 per cent said they have considered moving to a different location in the UK, most commonly to rural or coastal areas.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile about 1.15million are debating leaving city residences to escape to the country or coast (pictured, Port Isaac in Cornwall)</p>

<p>It means a staggering 9.5million working Britons - out of a possible 33million - are not in the office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile about 1.15million are debating leaving city residences to escape to the country or coast.</p>

<p>An estimated 60 per cent of them are looking to move to rural areas, while 40 per cent want to live by the sea.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the ONS report, 64 per cent of workers restarted commuting last week - before Boris Johnson's latest coronavirus measures.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister this week U-turned on his back to the office message in the wake of rising Covid cases.</p>

<p>It comes as official data shows Britain's coronavirus outbreak appears to be speeding up again.</p>

<p>Today saw another 6,874 Covid-19 cases recorded, meaning the seven-day rolling average is 54 per cent higher than it was a week ago</p>

<p>Some top scientists had insisted there was not a true rise in cases because the test positivity rate - how many cases are found for every swab completed - had not changed wildly</p>

<p>Today saw another 6,874 Covid-19 cases recorded, meaning the seven-day rolling average is 54 per cent higher than it was a week ago.</p>

<p>MailOnline analysis shows this is the sixth consecutive day the average compared to the week before has risen.</p>

<p>Before last Saturday, the weekly coronavirus growth rate had dropped every day for an entire week.</p>

<p>It had plummeted from the high of 84 per cent on September 12 to 20 per cent on September 19.</p>

<p>Meanwhile chief scientific advisors to the Government, Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, terrified the nation by their gloomy prediction that cases may reach 50,000 per day by mid-October, if nothing is done.</p>

<p>They claimed infections were doubling every week, in line with growing outbreaks in Spain andÂ France.</p>

<p>But scientists shot down the claims, warning it was based on old data that relied on just a few hundred positive cases.</p>

<p>Yesterday saw another 6,634 Covid-19 cases recorded, meaning the average number of daily infections is 48 per cent higher than it was a week ago</p>

<p>Even Boris Johnson distanced himself from the claims, saying the outbreak could be doubling up to every 20 days.</p>

<p>Other figures from NHS Test and Trace also suggest cases had dwindled last week.</p>

<p>But the newest statistics - released yesterday - only go up until September 16, meaning any spike in the past week has yet to be confirmed in another dataset.</p>

<p>Department of Health figures show the doubling rate of cases is around two weeks.</p>

<p>Almost 5,000 people are being diagnosed with Covid-19 every day at the moment, up from 2,500 on September 10.</p>

<p>But this is based on lab-confirmed infections, and thousands of patients won't ever develop any symptoms.</p>

<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which tracks the size of the outbreak by carrying out thousands of random swab tests, estimates cases have risen 60 per cent in a week to 9,600 a day.</p>

<p>While King's College London researchers, who are behind a symptom-tracking app, say it has doubled over the same time-frame to around 16,000.</p>
