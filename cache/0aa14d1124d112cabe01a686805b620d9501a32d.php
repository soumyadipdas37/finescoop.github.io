<p>PJ Brewer-Laye, 12, who lives in Indianapolis, was out walking with his grandmother Angela Brewer-Laye, about a mile and a half from their house when she suffered a medical emergency.</p>

<p>Angela began to experience the symptoms of low blood pressure including feeling shaky and seeing spots in her vision, while PJ was tearing up and down the same road on his go kart. </p>

<p>'I was leaning against a stop sign then all of a sudden I looked to my right and I saw my car, my Mercedes Benz coming towards me. Wait a minute. </p>

<p>'Looked in the car. It was him, it was PJ,' she told 11Alive.  </p>

<p>PJ Brewer-Laye, 12, (pictured) who lives in Indianapolis, has been praised for driving his grandmother to her medical supplies after she began to experience the symptoms of low blood pressure when they were out walking </p>

<p>Angela Brewer-Laye (pictured) said PJ noticed the change in her demeanor and quickly got behind the wheel of her Mercedes Benz to help </p>

<p>Angela explained that PJ noticed the change in her behaviour and quickly sprang into action to help before she had time to think.</p>

<p>Minors without a state-required driver's license can drive vehicles and dirt bikes on private property with no public access, such as ranches and other rural private property, with the consent of the property owner. </p>

<p>However, if an unlicensed driver causes a serious injury or death while driving, the property owners – or parents or guardians if the driver is a minor – could be held liable for injuries and damages. </p>

<p>She praised the her grandson, who turned 12 this week, who doesn't have a driving license and isn't yet at the legal driving age for handling her car like a 'pro'. </p>

<p>Revealing they often spend time together outside, Angela said: 'He always rides either his four-wheeler, go-kart or his dirt bike while I'm trying to get a little exercise in.' </p>

<p>The grandmother was appreciative of PJ's ability to stay 'calm and collected' behind the wheel during her medical emergency.</p>

<p>She explained that he learned to drive from her husband who has asked him to move cars around in their yard before, however he has never driven on the street or by himself. </p>

<p>Angela added: 'He did not go up the curb, in the grass or nothing. Pulled down in the driveway and into the garage.'</p>

<p>PJ told his grandmother that he chose her Mercedes Benz instead of the other cars on their driveway because the keys were the easiest to reach. </p>

<p>PJ (pictured) revealed that he learned to drive from his grandfather who often tasked him with moving cars in their yard</p>

<p>Reflecting on the situation, Angela said: 'He's an extra special little boy and he doesn't ask for anything in return.' </p>

<p>The 12-year-old who recently celebrated his birthday was dubbed a 'hero' after news of his quick thinking spread throughout their community and has been praised by social media users.</p>

<p>One person wrote: 'PJ is smart and mature beyond his age. God bless him! Good job little man, you're awesome!'</p>
