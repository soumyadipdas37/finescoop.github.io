<p>Nintendo has also launched an update of the classic game compilation – 1993's Super Mario All-Stars that was originally available on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System – for Nintendo Switch online members. </p>

<p>Nintendo has also released a digital timeline of Super Mario Bros. game releases for Mario fans to fondly reminisce, onto which they can insert their own birth date.  </p>

<p>In terms of hardware, Nintendo is releasing a fetching update of the Game &amp; Watch handheld consoles that were first released in 1980, pre-dating the original Game Boy.</p>

<p>This new collectable device, available in November and retailing at £45, is inspired by the original Game &amp; Watch systems </p>

<p>The smart new handheld also features an update of the much-adored game Ball, where Mario controls a character who must juggle several balls at once, and a digital clock. </p>

<p>It's much like the original handheld device, which included a game and could be used as a watch to tell the time. </p>

<p>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System: Super NES Classic Edition is a mini console that mimics the design of the original system, released in 1990</p>

<p>Nintendo will be hoping to replicate the success of the original Game &amp; Watch series, which sold more than 43 million units worldwide.     </p>

<p>Nintendo has already re-released smaller versions of the NES Classic and the Super NES consoles to capitalise on consumers' love for all things retro, back in 2017.</p>

<p>There were rumours in 2018 that Nintendo would be releasing an update of the Nintendo 64, based on alleged patents filed in its native Japan, although the so-called 'N64 Classic Edition' has not yet materialised.</p>

<p>The original console sold more than 50 million units between 1996 and 2003 and a retro version will likely be popular. </p>

<p>Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy (pictured) was released for the PS$ in June 2017 and the Switch the following year. Reboots of old games are proving popular among those who spent their childhood in the 1990s playing games</p>

<p>The trend for remastered games is playing a significant role in the growth of the gaming industry in the UK, according to Mobiles.co.uk.</p>

<p>The new UKIE UK Top Selling Games List for 2019 revealed that remakes and remastered games including Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy, Resident Evil 2 and The Legend of Zelda Link’s Awakening were amongst the top 100 best selling boxed games sold in 2019.</p>

<p>While the more recent Final Fantasy VII remake quickly became one of the PS4’s best selling game to date.</p>

<p>Still remaining in the top 20 for the UK's best-selling games of 2019 two years after its release, Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy receives around 6,600 unique searches every month.</p>

<p>Its continuing popularity indicates that British gamers are becoming increasingly nostalgic when it comes to their gaming choices. </p>

<p>Crash Bandicoot also features at number 21 in the 2019 list. </p>

<p>The remaster spiked the interest of gamers in the UK with a 49 per cent increase in search volume over the past 12 months alone. </p>

<p>With an average of 27,100 monthly searches, the franchise's decision to reboot this classic was certainly welcomed by the industry, indicating there is a huge appetite for nostalgic gameplay.</p>

<p>The final remaster included in the list of the top-selling games is The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening. </p>

<p>Screenshoot from the update of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, released September 2019</p>

<p>Originally launched on the Game Boy in 1993, the remake was designed for the Nintendo Switch. </p>

<p>As of March 2020, the new Link's Awakening had sold more than four million copies globally6, and it's one of the best-selling games of all time for the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>90s teens are 69 per cent more likely than the national average to spend between 21 and 28 hours gaming every week, Mobiles.co.uk claims. </p>

<p>In 2019, the entire UK video game industry generated a huge £5.35 billion in revenue, with £3.77 billion of that total generated from video game software sales. There are 37.3 million gamers in the UK alone.  </p>

<p>Lee Chambers, Psychologist and gaming expert, commented on the research: 'Gaming and nostalgia are heavily interconnected, to the point where it fuels trends and shapes the industry direction. </p>

<p>'Video games are incredible triggers for nostalgia, anchoring us back to an often carefree time, when we had fewer responsibilities and gaming became a social construct as groups of children all sat around in a bedroom socialising while playing.'</p>

<p>'The reality of the industry is that nostalgic gamers are now the ones with purchasing power to relive past glories fighting dragons of their youth, while being decision-makers for buying games as presents for their children.</p>

<p>'Your average early millennial is approaching 40. They don’t have the time they did as a child to form an emotional bond to a game’s story with life’s distractions, but a remake removes that barrier, making it all the more attractive.'   </p>
