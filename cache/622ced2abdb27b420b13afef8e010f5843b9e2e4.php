<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The pregnant mum arrested in her pyjamas in her own home for organising an anti-lockdown rally has broken her silence on social media to demand an apology from the Victorian Premier.</p>

<p>Zoe Lee Buhler, 28, made headlines last week after extraordinary footage of her being handcuffed by police in front of her children in her Ballarat lounge room, north-west of Melbourne went viral.</p>

<p>She was charged with incitement after she created a Facebook protest event against the draconian lockdown laws in Victoria.</p>

<p>Following a temporary ban on social media, Ms Buhler resurfaced earlier this week with a scathing message for Premier Daniel Andrews.</p>

<p>Zoe Lee Buhler, 28, is back on social media after footage of her arrest last week went viral</p>

<p>'I want a personal apology from you. You are dooming us all Dan Andrews. Go to hell where you belong. #sackdanandrews,' she posted on Facebook on Sunday.</p>

<p>She also uploaded a live-streamed video to update everyone on how she was going.</p>

<p>'Hello everyone, so you're all well aware what myself and my family have been going through,' she said.</p>

<p>'I haven't been able to go on social media until today. So I just wanted to jump on and say thank you to everyone for all the support.'</p>

<p>While several hundred protesters gathered in Melbourne on Saturday for a Freedom Day rally, an emotional Ms Buhler revealed she spent the day writing a short poem  titled 'Remember, Remember' about Premier Andrews and his lockdown, which she read out.  </p>

<p>'How can we call this living when they feel like dying?',' the poem starts.</p>

<p>'We’re hardly surviving when we should be thriving.'</p>

<p>Zoe Buhler, 28, was handcuffed in her lounge room in front of her children last week and was later charged with incitement</p>

<p>The poem accuses the Premier of sitting on his high horse and wondering if he has any remorse over the lockdown that has destroyed thousands of livelihoods in Victoria.</p>

<p>The poem ends calling on the Premier to free Victorians from lockdown, which he has since been extended by two weeks until at least September 28.</p>

<p>Ms Buhler has since reiterated her calls for an apology from the Premier.</p>

<p>'So sick of living in fear!' she wrote on Monday.</p>

<p>Today it's windy where I am and it sounded like there was a banging at the door. I woke up thinking this is it they're coming to get me, all over me being awake and knowing the truth and for that for simply having knowledge I feel as if my life could end at any moment.</p>

<p>'Wake up people we can't keep living this way￼!</p>

<p>'I want an apology from Dan Andrews. I thought he cared about keeping people safe? I don't feel safe in Victoria.' </p>

<p>Ms Buhler has been targeted by cruel online trolls in recent days and briefly let them get the better of her on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>'Maybe if I kill myself all of you trolls (bullies) will be happier!' she posted.</p>

<p>She later assured everyone she was fine. </p>

<p>Zoe Lee Buhler (pictured on Sunday) has also written a poem about Victoria's lockdown</p>

<p>'Sorry to all the beautiful souls reaching out, I won't kill myself. I will stay strong for myself, the baby, my children and all of humanity,' she later wrote.</p>

<p>'I know everything happens for a reason and I know my arrest is serving great purpose. It's just also very hard at times, especially with the online bullies, media bullies.</p>

<p>'So much love to you all. I'll stay strong! </p>

<p>Ms Buhler's brother created a GoFundMe page to raise money for her legal fees and fine after she was charged last week.</p>

<p>'All money raised will go straight to Help Zoe Lee pay her legal fees! Thank you!' the page reads.</p>

<p>'All money left after legal costs will be donated to suicide awareness. We will not be keeping a single cent of the money for ourselves. </p>

<p>'Let's get back our basic human rights.'</p>

<p>But the fundraiser was mysteriously taken down by its creator less than 24 hours after it was created.</p>

<p>The page had raised more than $8,600. </p>

<p>Last Thursday, Buhler said she feared she was being 'kidnapped' when she was arrested.   </p>

<p>'I was scared I was being kidnapped by people, they obviously weren't in uniforms,' she told media waiting outside her Miner's Rest home.</p>

<p>'I was just so scared, I was like oh my gosh if I disappear today I want it live on Facebook.</p>

<p>'I'm only very early pregnancy so obviously you're told not to stress out or strain.' </p>

<p>Buhler is about seven weeks pregnant - which she only discovered days ago - and was due to have her first ultrasound an hour after her arrest.</p>

<p>She said she was 'still yet to know exactly what [incitement] means' and planned to fight the charge, claiming it was an honest mistake.</p>

<p>'I just wanted to feel like I was doing something to stand up for human rights,' she said.  </p>

<p>'If someone steals a car, they know they are committing a crime. I didn't, so I don't feel like I should have to pay for that.' </p>

<p>Buhler, who claimed to have lost her job during the lockdown, said police eventually took her handcuffs off and let her get dressed before taking her to the station.</p>

<p>She claimed the officers said they weren't happy about having to arrest her.</p>

<p>Buhler allegedly created this event for Saturday at 11am on Sturt Street in Ballarat</p>

<p> How can we call this living when they feel like dying?</p>

<p>We’re hardly surviving when we should be thriving.</p>

<p>Our ancestors are sick of crying, sick of seeing you lying.</p>

<p>Lifetimes and lifetimes spent wondering where all the effort went</p>

<p>Messages from far and wide are sent wondering when you will repent</p>

<p>While you sit on your high horse, I wonder where is the remorse</p>

<p>We’re living in a time I cannot endorse</p>

<p>A time where crime is enforced</p>

<p>Enforced by those who want to protect us</p>

<p>Those we have been taught to trust</p>

<p>And I know you’re afraid wondering what they will say</p>

<p>But we can’t keep living this way</p>

<p>And I won’t give up until my dying day</p>

<p>So say what you may, so well please</p>

<p>Because this is me begging on my knees</p>

<p>It’s time to let us be free</p>

<p>Ms Buhler later told radio station 3AW that she felt the police 'barging in' to her home and arresting her was 'extreme' and a phone call would have sufficed.</p>

<p>'I had a bit of a bimbo moment and I actually didn't realise that it wasn't okay. I thought so long as we social distanced and wore masks it was okay,' she said.</p>

<p>'I was aware that the protest coming up in Melbourne wasn't permitted, but I thought, in Ballarat, we're in Stage Three lockdown.</p>

<p>'I'm not a criminal person... If the police had just called me and told me to remove the post I would've done so.</p>

<p>'I understand police were doing their job and they were very nice for me, but I wasn't very happy with them barging into my house in front of my children.' </p>

<p>Zoe Buhler, 28, (pictured) said she feared she was being kidnapped during the arrest on Wednesday</p>

<p>Mother-of-two Buhler with her boyfriend James Timmins, who filmed her arrest</p>

<p>Buhler is not allowed on social media until Sunday as part of her bail terms, but hoped her arrest would raise opposition to the lockdown.</p>

<p>'It's pretty horrible circumstances but hopefully some good comes out of it,' she said.</p>

<p>'It might be a bit of an eye-opener about the human rights I'm trying to stand for and people realising just how out of control things are getting</p>

<p>'So many people have been affected by the lockdown, people are losing their jobs, the economy has collapsed, rise in suicide and domestic violence. I wish we could see a happy medium.</p>

<p>'I feel like Daniel Andrews is the one that should be feeling remorseful.' </p>

<p>Buhler's social media pages are full of coronavirus conspiracy theories, but she insisted she believed the pandemic was real. </p>

<p>'My heart goes out to anyone who's died of covid, I know that people are getting sick, I don't believe it's a hoax or anything, I'm not a part of a cult,' she said.</p>

<p>Three other protest organisers around Victoria have been charged with incitement in the past few weeks. </p>

<p>Buhler's alleged offending post linked to a since-deleted 'Freedom Day Ballarat' event she created</p>

<p>Buhler is about seven weeks pregnant, only finding out days ago, and was due to have her first ultrasound an hour after her arrest</p>

<p>Buhler offered to delete the post but was told she had already committed an offence</p>

<p>Buhler's social media pages are full of coronavirus conspiracy theories, but she insisted she believed the pandemic was real</p>

<p>The video, which has since made international headlines in US and UK media, shows the confused mother asking why she is being arrested.  </p>

<p>'Excuse me, incitement for what, what on Earth? I'm in my pyjamas, my two kids are here,' she asked police.</p>

<p>'I have an ultrasound in an hour because I'm pregnant.'  </p>

<p>The increasingly distressed mother insisted she wasn't breaking any laws by creating and then promoting the event. </p>

<p>'Actually you are, that's why we're arresting you in relation to incitement,' police replied.</p>

<p>Ms Buhler offered to delete the post as her boyfriend James Timmins tried to mediate while cradling their infant child in his arms.</p>

<p>'How about she just doesn't do the event? It's not like she's done it, she made a post,' he said.</p>

<p>Police were unmoved, telling her: 'You've already committed the offence.' </p>

<p>Buhler was distressed by this point and crying so much she could barely tell officers that she 'didn't realise' she was 'doing anything wrong' in making the online event.   </p>

<p>Ms Buhler was charged with incitement and released on bail to appear in Ballarat Magistrates Court on January 25 next year. </p>
