<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hybrid technology is being tested by the British Army in two of its armoured vehicles as a way to improve sustainability and enhance stealth capabilities.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for MoD says the hybrid engines will improve the army’s stealth abilities as they can run almost-silently compared to the diesel-only models. </p>

<p>The Jackal 2 mobile weapons platform and the Foxhound protected patrol vehicle will be refitted with the new hybrid systems - with testing starting in November. </p>

<p>Prototype hybrids of each vehicle are being built as part of a £3 million investment from the Ministry of Defence to find ways to reduce its carbon footprint but no specific details have been revealed for the individual costs of the vehicles.</p>

<p>The vehicles will keep their diesel-driven internal combustion engines along with batteries and electronics for the first prototypes, but that could change in future versions. </p>

<p>The Jackal 2 mobile weapons platform and the Foxhound protected patrol vehicle will be refitted with the new hybrid systems - with testing starting in November</p>

<p>The MoD said the vehicles self-charge from the diesel engine, which runs a generator providing electricity to the battery, so don't need to be plugged in.</p>

<p>Offering improved silent mobility, hybrid and electric systems provide sustainability benefits and deliver potential military advantages, an MoD spokesperson said.  </p>

<p>'Electric systems will also provide game-changing power off-board, while increased power onboard will allow the vehicles to operate the latest technologies,' they added.</p>

<p>The innovative hybrid electric-drive system will be developed by Coventry-based NP Aerospace along with General Dynamics UK, Supacat and Magtec.</p>

<p>They will develop prototypes of the Foxhound and Jackal 2 vehicles to test the new technology with the possibility of it being rolled out more widely in future. </p>

<p>Defence Minister Jeremy Quin, said: 'It is vital our armoured vehicles are equipped with the latest technology so we can maintain our battle-winning edge.</p>

<p>'These tests will ensure our Armed Forces have the latest, safest and most efficient technology, while continuing to support prosperity across the UK. </p>

<p>'They represent a potential opportunity to improve our vehicles sustainability and military effectiveness.'</p>

<p>Alongside delivering multiple technical and operational enhancements, the introduction of hybrid technology will ultimately reduce the Army's reliance on fossil fuels - a step towards the Government's 2050 net zero goal. </p>

<p>Measures like this will be reflected in the department's ongoing Climate Change and Sustainability Review, led by Lt Gen Richard Nugee. </p>

<p>The Foxhound armoured vehicle is also being retrofitted with the hybrid system</p>

<p>Nugee said it was great to see the Army testing electric vehicles that will benefit both personnel and the planet.</p>

<p>'This goes to show how seriously we are incorporating sustainability into our operations, while simultaneously pushing the boundaries of military innovation.' </p>

<p>This next-generation army vehicle technology is being tested under the Protected Mobility Engineering &amp; Technical Support (PMETS) programme.</p>

<p>The programme was setup to ensure that the UK's cutting-edge fleet of 2,200 armoured vehicles are continuously updated and upgraded.</p>

<p>The £63m PMETS contract was awarded to NP Aerospace in 2019, supporting 100 jobs in Coventry and 250 jobs across the UK supply chain until 2024, MOD said.</p>

<p>The modified platforms will begin trials between November 20 and July 21 at the Millbrook Proving Ground outside Bedford.</p>
