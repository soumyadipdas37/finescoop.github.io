<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A haul of $2.5million in cash and cocaine has been uncovered by police in a bust in Sydney's CBD.</p>

<p>Investigators searched a Volkswagen SUV in Haymarket at midnight on Thursday and found suitcases, boxes and bags containing more than $2.5 million cash and more than 2.5kg of cocaine.  </p>

<p>They also seized 30g of cocaine, $10,000 cash, casino chips valued at $1750, over $100,000 worth of watches, a money counter and documentation during a raid on a unit.  </p>

<p>All items seized will undergo further examination.</p>

<p>A 28-year-old man was arrested at the unit and taken to Surry Hills Police Station.</p>

<p>He was charged with knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime and supplying prohibited drug (large commercial quantity).</p>

<p>He was refused bail to appear at Central Local Court on Thursday. </p>

<p>Organised Crime Squad Commander, Detective Superintendent Martin Fileman, said the arrest is a testament to the collaborative effort of local police and specialist investigators.</p>

<p>'Today's results can be directly attributed to good old-fashioned policing, with officers from across the organisation working together to remove harmful substances from our streets,' Det Supt Fileman said.</p>

<p>'The cocaine that was found was broken into small amounts, clearly ready for supply in the community and with an estimated potential street value of $1.25 million.</p>

<p>'Anyone who choses to actively participate in organised criminal activities – including money laundering and drug supply – will be pursued by police and brought before the courts,' Det Supt Fileman said.</p>
