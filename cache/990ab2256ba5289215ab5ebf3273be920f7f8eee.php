<p>Venues in metropolitan Melbourne believe it will take at least two years to recover from the harsh coronavirus restrictions.  </p>

<p>Hospitality platform Barcats surveyed 203 Victorian workers and venue owners to uncover the bleak outlook for the industry. </p>

<p>Barcats CEO Jeffrey Williams said a shocking amount of the state's hospitality staff, almost 80 per cent, were currently out of work.  </p>

<p>More than two thirds of hospitality workers have lost confidence in the industry and 80 per cent of restaurant and bar staff are out of work (Staff at the Portsea Hotel pictured) </p>

<p>'Although venues are trying to stay open with takeaway options and home deliveries, 78.65 per cent of Victoria's hospitality staff are currently not working, with over half of these workers from central Melbourne,' Mr Williams explained.  </p>

<p>More than two thirds of hospitality workers had also lost confidence in the industry and believed the second lockdown would have long-lasting effects on jobs.   </p>

<p>'45.83 per cent of staff surveyed specifically state that the second wave of COVID-19 shutdowns has made them consider a career change away from hospitality,' Mr Williams said.   </p>

<p>The Colonial Leisure Group runs several venues across Victoria and group executive Andrew Lewis said coronavirus restrictions would damage their operations. </p>

<p>'With the international and state borders remaining closed our CBD venues will hurt the most relying heavily on full hotels and international travellers.</p>

<p>'We're anticipating most of our venues will only be able to operate at 80 per cent for the next couple of years whilst the industry tries to get back on its feet,' he said. </p>

<p>Mr Williams explained that when Melbourne's bars and restaurants reopened for good there would be a staff shortage so young people shouldn't be put off starting a career in hospitality.</p>

<p>'When Melbourne's CBD eventually re-opens, venues will be crying out for staff to help them recover and this is when the staff shortage will be detrimental,' he said.</p>

<p>'With no overseas travellers we will be relying on Aussie's to fill the gap. </p>

<p>'We need to encourage more youngsters to consider hospitality as a career and we need more mature workers to be get back into hospitality, with venues adapting shifts to be more suitable for part-time workers.'   </p>

<p>Victoria recorded another day of double-digit coronavirus infections on Wednesday, with 76 new cases across the state.</p>

<p>A further 11 deaths have also been announced, taking the state's death toll to 694.   </p>
