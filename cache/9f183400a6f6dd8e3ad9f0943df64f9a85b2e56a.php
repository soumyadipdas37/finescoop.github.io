<p>'This has nothing to do with gender, nor is it a case of the BBC trying to be woke.</p>

<p>The source also explained how Alex had impressed BBC bosses when she appeared on the show in the past. </p>

<p>Alex has guest-starred on A Question Of Sport twice, with one occasion being aired in November 2016.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands she signed a new three-year contract last year to carry her through until at least 2022, something that will come as a relief to many viewers. </p>

<p>Ex-newsreader Jennie Bond told GMB today: 'Sue will be hurting this morning. You can't do anything about your age and there is a pressure on television, particularly for women, to look younger.' </p>

<p>On Monday, sources disclosed to Sportsmail that Alex is well-liked by the broadcaster and in the mix to replace Barker as presenter. </p>

<p>Ex-Tottenham and England midfielder Jermaine Jenas was also said to be in the running to become one of the new team captains, with the BBC keen to diversify.  </p>

<p>End of an era: It was revealed this week that Sue had been  axed as host of the show after 24 years. She will still be continue with presenting duties for the next two summers at Wimbledon</p>
