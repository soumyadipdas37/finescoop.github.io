<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Half of Wasps’ players were too crocked to celebrate but they could not care less. Chaos reigned as they lost four players to injury inside 34 minutes — leaving them with no lineout thrower and uncontested scrums — but they fought back for a famous victory.</p>

<p>Talisman Thomas Young was the first man down inside 60 seconds, before Lima Sopoaga, Tommy Taylor and Gabriel Oghre quickly joined him in the medical room. The win helped Wasps leapfrog Bath into fourth, although their scouts were last night left looking for emergency cover for their play-off push.</p>

<p>This was a victory built on the breakdown class of Jack Willis, combined with Wasps’ ability to adapt in the unstructured conditions. Their low-profile coaching team are among the league’s freshest faces, but they delivered a masterclass in madness management.</p>

<p>Bath led for large parts of the game yet Wasps somehow stayed in the fight. They trailed until the 76th minute, when Simon McIntyre threw an attacking lineout. He was their fourth player to do so — after Taylor, Oghre and Dan Robson — but his limp throw hit Brad Shields and the pack drew out a match-winning penalty try.</p>

<p>‘That was pure dog… pure fight,’ said Wasps coach Lee Blackett. ‘It doesn’t always take talent but it takes a lot of hard work. That’s what’s so pleasing and I’m really proud.</p>

<p>‘Everything possible was thrown at us. We have a scenario that if both hookers are off, we use Thomas Young at the lineout. He’s our third-choice thrower. The character and leadership in adversity was so pleasing.’</p>

<p>Sara Cox made history at Bath by becoming the first female assistant referee in a Premiership match. </p>

<p>It is the latest landmark for the 30-year-old (left), who officiated at both the 2014 and 2017 Women’s Rugby World Cups, became the first centrally contracted female referee with the RFU in 2016 and went on to take charge of a Premiership Rugby Cup clash in 2018,</p>

<p>It was a clash of styles at the Rec. Bath have built one of the heaviest packs in the league, while Wasps are lighter on their feet. Young was forced off the pitch following a shuddering clearout in the first minute.</p>

<p>Wasps wanted to make their yards out wide, however they were guilty of forcing things in the early exchanges. Malakai Fekitoa dropped a speculative pass and Ruaridh McConnochie pounced for a fast try. Rhys Priestland’s boot steered Bath to a 13-0 lead, but their No 10 lacked the game management to build on their advantage.</p>

<p>Against the odds, Wasps won penalties at the scrum, providing a platform for attack. The ball squirted out the back of a lineout, but Robson’s improvised dummy sent Bath’s backline spinning, leaving a hole for the impressive Jacob Umaga to score.</p>

<p>The visitors had to dig deep as their injury toll ramped up — and they repeatedly held off Bath on their try-line. Sam Underhill and Charlie Ewels were both denied and Wasps’ reserves were energised with a siege mentality.</p>

<p>Tommy Taylor was the third Wasps player to be replaced in just 34 minutes of action</p>

<p>Blackett’s team played smart, opting for uncontested scrums, rather than kicking for weakened lineouts. Robson fired up the tempo with quick taps and his side drew level with a breakdown penalty just before half-time.</p>

<p>Priestland should have played for territory, whilst his pack should have applied more pressure at the lineout. At times they did not even contest, despite Wasps’ glaring frailties. A quick throw caught Bath unprepared and provided Tom West with the opportunity to snatch the lead after 58 minutes.</p>

<p>Bath, however, resorted to their pack and fought back with a drive-over try. Victory seemed inevitable. They pushed again, but Priestland threw a high-risk, low-reward pass that was dropped by Tom de Glanville.</p>

<p>Wasps moved upfield and, with four minutes left on the clock, won an attacking lineout. McIntyre’s throw went unchallenged and, when Underhill illegally pulled down the maul, Wasps left with the most unlikely of victories.</p>
