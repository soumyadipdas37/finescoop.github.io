<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wales boss Ryan Giggs has not held talks with Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane over Gareth Bale's future due to concerns that the conversation would be lost in translation. </p>

<p>Former Spurs star Bale has been called up to the Wales squad to face Finland and Bulgaria in the UEFA Nations League next month, having missed out on game time with Los Blancos since the restart.</p>

<p>Bale featured in 100 minutes of game time over the course of Madrid's final dozen games this season, with the 31-year-old's relationship with coach Zidane very frosty. </p>

<p>Ryan Giggs has revealed that he has not spoken with Zinedine Zidane about Gareth Bale</p>

<p>The Welsh star's future is uncertain with Real Madrid eager to cut ties with the 31-year-old</p>

<p>The Welshman's game time with his club is of interest to Giggs, who has set the national side up to get the maximum out of the attacker, but the former Manchester United star revealed that the language barrier has stopped him from speaking to Zidane. </p>

<p>'I haven't spoken to Zidane,' Giggs revealed. 'My French and Spanish isn't too good. That's my way out of that one.</p>

<p>'I know Zidane's English isn't very good from experience. I'm just monitoring the situation. When Gareth gets on camp I will speak to him like I always do.</p>

<p>Bale has seen game time limited under boss Zidane and has fallen out of favour in Madrid</p>

<p>But Giggs says the language barrier has prevented him from speaking with Zidane</p>

<p>'I've always said to him if he wants to speak then I'll listen and be more than happy to help him. He's experienced and professional enough to look after himself. But I'm there if he ever needs to speak.'</p>

<p>Bale was on the verge of leaving the Bernabeu last summer with a switch to China close to being finalised before the Spanish giants pulled the plug on that deal.  </p>

<p>In November last year, after Wales qualified for Euro 2020, Bale was pictured celebrating with a flag that read, 'Wales, golf, Madrid. In that order'.</p>

<p>Bale was pictured pretending to be asleep in the stands during Real's 2-0 win against Alaves last month.</p>
