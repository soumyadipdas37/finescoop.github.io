<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has aimed another playful dig at his predecessor Jose Mourinho over Tottenham being given a bye to the fourth round of the Carabao Cup.</p>

<p>After Brighton hit the woodwork five times against Manchester United at the Amex Stadium on Saturday, Solskjaer joked about Mourinho complaining that the goalposts were five centimetres smaller than regulation for last week's Europa League tie against Shkendija in Macedonia.</p>

<p>'You have to be happy Jose isn't here to measure the goalposts, it might have been a smaller goal,' laughed Solskjaer.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has aimed another playful dig at Jose Mourinho after Spurs were given a bye into the fourth round of the Carabao Cup</p>

<p>Mourinho retaliated by mentioning the number of penalties United have been awarded under Solskjaer - 15 in the Premier League last season alone - after Bruno Fernandes scored a late winner from the spot at Brighton.</p>

<p>'I think Ole was so happy and surprised with what happened to his team that he had a joke,' said Mourinho. 'But I think for him the dimension of the goalposts are not important. For him what is important is the dimensions of the 18-yard box.</p>

<p>'He'd never accept to play with a 17-yard box, I think he would prefer a 22-yard box. For him it would be better.'</p>

<p>Ahead of United's return to the Amex to play Brighton in the Carabao Cup, Solskjaer couldn't resist a reference to Spurs reaching a fourth round clash with Chelsea on Tuesday night without playing a game after receiving a bye against Leyton Orient.</p>

<p>'It depends how you want to get there,' he smiled. 'You've got teams getting there without playing, even to this round!'</p>
