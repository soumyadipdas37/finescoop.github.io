<p>It comes after Denise was also confirmed as one of the stars set to take to the rink for this year's Dancing On Ice.</p>

<p>Denise spoke on Loose Women about her stint on ITV's skating series earlier this week, saying: 'I'm really excited. Finally, I get to tell people. I've kept this a secret from most of my friends and family. Betsy (her 10-year-old daughter) doesn't even know.</p>

<p>'She's at school, so she's going to find out this afternoon when I pick her up from school.. She will be so excited. She loves the show and we watch it every year...</p>

<p>'Literally, I cannot stand up on ice. Every time I've taken Betsy around on a rink I've been the one on the penguin.' </p>

<p>Reflecting on things turning around, she went on: 'After the year we've all had it's going to be lovely and refreshing to see a bit of sparkle, a bit of glamour and see us all happy and smiling enjoying ourselves on the ice." </p>

<p>Last month, it was reported that the mother-of-one has signed up to the upcoming series as a contestant in a staggering £40,000 deal.  </p>

<p>The screen star is understood to have 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the show when it kicks off in January after impressing at an audition last month. </p>

<p>A source told the Daily Star: 'Bosses are thrilled to have her on board. They know she will give it her all in training and be popular with viewers.'  </p>
