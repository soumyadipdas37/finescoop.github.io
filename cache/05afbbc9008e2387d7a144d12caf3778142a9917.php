<p>'Ladies and gentlemen, the silent majority is ready to make some noise,' Covington said while wearing an American flag draped around his shoulders following his win. </p>

<p>'If you thought that was a beating, wait until Nov. 3 when Donald Trump gets his hands on sleepy Joe. That's going to be a landslide.'  </p>

<p>'I'm proud of you man. I'm a big fan and I'm proud of you,' Trump told Covington as he received a phone call during his post-fight interview. </p>

<p>'You're tough, you have the right spirits. So now go win the next one, and keep it for a long time. Just keep that championship for a long time. </p>

<p>'You are something ... I appreciated the shout out tonight, too. I'm your fan, you're my fan. Two of a kind, two of a kind.' </p>
