<p>Justin Gaethje is the dangerous challenger many think could undo Khabib Nurmagomedov</p>

<p>The challenger smells blood and has an incredible record of finishing fights </p>

<p>Footage of Khabib beating Conor McGregor was used in the promo video by the UFC</p>

<p>Ever since Gaethje dominated Tony Ferguson, winning by fifth-round TKO earlier this summer, there has been huge anticipation about his fight with Khabib. </p>

<p>Many believe he has the attributes that could cause the fearsome wrestler problems and the legendary cardio to back it up over a whole 25 minutes. </p>

<p>The UFC's promotional video begins by showing Gaethje overcoming Ferguson and afterwards throwing the interim belt on the mat, declaring that he is only interested in the real thing.  </p>

<p>Khabib promised to smash Gaethje in the promotional video released on Thursday morning</p>
