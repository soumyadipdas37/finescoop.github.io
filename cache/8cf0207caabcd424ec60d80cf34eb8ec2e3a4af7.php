<p>Getaway: Zac Efron (pictured) recently enjoyed a ski holiday in Thredbo with his rumoured new girlfriend Vanessa Valladares</p>

<p>She's rumoured to have quit her job now and is said to be staying with Zac at Belongil Beach.</p>

<p>Last month, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source revealed. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.'</p>

<p>Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months ago in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.</p>

<p>But it seems his request to have his tourist visa extended from three months to 12 months was granted, hence why he cancelled his trip home.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands Zac received a last-minute refund for his ticket.</p>

<p>It comes just days after The Daily Telegraph reported that Zac had 'inspected and put in an offer' on a home in Byron Bay.</p>

<p>Cancelled: Last month, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles</p>

<p>However, he was apparently outbid at the last minute by a rival buyer.</p>

<p>Zac was apparently disappointed because he had 'fallen in love' with Byron Bay.</p>

<p>While he is staying in Australia for the time being, the Baywatch star will have to return to America eventually due to his filming commitments.</p>

<p>He is scheduled to star in the Disney+ remake of Three Men and a Baby, based on the classic 1987 comedy starring Steve Guttenberg, Tom Selleck and Ted Danson.</p>
