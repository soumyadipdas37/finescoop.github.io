<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One of the world's rarest diamonds is heading for auction in Hong Kong and is expected to fetch between $11 million to $33 million.</p>

<p>The 102.39-carat white diamond, which is about the size of an egg or a large lollipop, will go under the hammer at a single-lot auction on October 5 at Sotheby's. </p>

<p>Only seven such diamonds, known in the trade as D colour flawless or internally flawless white diamonds, with more than 100 carats have previously been sold at auction. </p>

<p>Quig Bruning, Sotheby's New York head of jewellery, said the auction house was offering the egg-shaped stone without a pre-sale estimate but explained diamonds of this caliber had previously sold anywhere between $11 million to $33 million.</p>

<p>The 102.39-carat white diamond, which is about the size of an egg or a large lollipop, will go up for auction on October 5 at Sotheby's in Hong Kong</p>

<p>He told AFP: 'Historically, diamonds of this caliber and this size have sold anywhere from about $11 million up to $33 million.</p>

<p>'We're offering without reserve and without estimate meaning the highest bid will be the winning bid with no minimum price.' </p>

<p>Bidding for the gem, which is the second largest oval diamond of its kind to ever appear at an auction at Sotheby's, began on September 15 with a starting price of one Hong Kong dollar or 13 US cents.</p>

<p>Mr Bruning added: 'Diamonds, like anything else, aren't immune to market fluctuations'  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Gary Schuler, worldwide chairman of jewellery at Sotheby's, said: 'More and more people have come to understand that something billions of years old and of the size of a lollipop can store as much value as a Rembrandt self-portrait or a Basquiat.' </p>

<p>Sotheby's said the gem was cut from a 271-carat rough that was discovered at the Victor Mine in the Canadian province of Ontario in 2018 and cut and polished for more than a year.</p>

<p>Bidding for the diamond began on September 15 with a starting price of one Hong Kong dollar or 13 US cents</p>

<p>The rare gem is about the size of an egg or a large lollipop and is expected to fetch $12 million to $30 million</p>

<p>Only seven such diamonds - known in the trade as D colour flawless or internally flawless white diamonds, over 100 carats - have previously been sold at auction </p>

<p>Two of the most famous large diamonds - the Koh-i-Noor and The Cullinan 1 - belong to the British monarchy and form part of the British Crown Jewels.</p>

<p>The world record for any diamond or jewel sold at auction was set in 2017 when a 59.60-carat vivid pink diamond was sold for $71.2 million to the Hong Kong jewellery company Chow Tai Fook, Sotheby's said.     </p>

<p>In 2013, a pink diamond weighing 59.60 carats went under the hammer at Sotheby's for $83 million.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in November, during a Christie's auction in Hong Kong, the nearly 15-carat Pink Promise was sold for $32.5 million.</p>

<p>In 2018, the 'Pink Legacy' diamond weighing just under 19 carats fetched a record 50.375 million Swiss francs ($50 million) when it was auctioned for the first time ever at Christie's.</p>

<p>The 102.39-carat white diamond is not being offered with a pre-sale estimate but previous gems like it have sold between $11 million to $33 million</p>

<p>The diamond will be sold in a single-lot action without a reserve price at Sotheby's in Hong Kong on October 5</p>

<p>The 'virtually unheard of' jewel was purchased by New York-based luxury jeweller Harry Winston at the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues in Geneva.</p>

<p>The company promptly renamed it 'The Winston Pink Legacy' and added it to its collection of rare jewels, the auction house said.</p>

<p>The rectangular-cut pink stone reached the top end of its value, as it had been estimated to fetch between $30 million and $50 million. It was discovered in a South African mine around a century ago and was probably cut in the 1920s.                       </p>
