<p>'This photo with Kitty takes me back to happier times, now it's hard to believe that all three of us are separated due to our border closures. I just wish I could give you both a big hug right now. </p>

<p>'If there's one thing 2020 has taught me, it's that I'll never take for granted the simple things in life like seeing family, the freedom to travel and most of all the feeling of being hugged by a loved one.</p>

<p>'Dad I hope Fathers Day 2021 will be a better one for us and all those separated from family this year'. </p>

<p>Jackie recently revealed her heartbreak after having to spend time away from her daughter Kitty, while filming The Masked Singer in Melbourne.</p>

<p>The star, who lives in Sydney's eastern suburbs, told TV Week that being separated from her nine-year-old was 'the hardest part of doing the show'.</p>

<p>'I'd always planned on bringing Kitty with me, but it's not possible because they [the Victorian Government] are really strict with permits and I wouldn't want her here anyway now,' she said, referring to the escalating COVID-19 situation in the state.  </p>

<p>Jackie continued: 'I've never been away from her for longer than five days. I'm only a few days in, so I'm okay now, but ask me in two weeks, I'll be crying. We FaceTime every day, so that helps.'  </p>

<p>She added that Kitty was also upset that production of The Masked Singer had moved from Sydney's Fox Studios to Melbourne this season.</p>

<p>'Kitty's so disappointed. She's obsessed with the show. Last year, she would come straight from school and we hung out almost every day.'</p>

<p>Jackie said: 'I've never been away from her for longer than five days. I'm only a few days in, so I'm okay now, but ask me in two weeks, I'll be crying. We FaceTime every day, so that helps'</p>
