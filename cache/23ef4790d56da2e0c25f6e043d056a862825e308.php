<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The grieving family of a teenage boy who drowned in rough surf at an un-patrolled beach have remembered him as a 'quiet sort of kid' who aspired to become a chef.</p>

<p>James Hayman, 17, was swimming at Diamond Beach near Hallidays Point, about 104km south of Port Macquarie, at 1pm on Wednesday when he suddenly vanished. </p>

<p>His father, Peter Hayman, almost lost his own life after jumping into the surf in a desperate attempt to find James. </p>

<p>James drowned at Diamond Beach (pictured)  on the NSW mid north coast on Wednesday</p>

<p>'It's very difficult. We're still trying to come to terms with it…we're quite distraught,' James' grandfather, Paul Hayman, told The Daily Telegraph.  </p>

<p>'He was a quiet sort of kid really, and he was in to cooking. I think he wanted to go in to becoming a chef when he finished school. That was one of his big aims.'</p>

<p>Police eventually found James and pulled him from the water and started CPR before paramedics arrived and took over.</p>

<p>He was unable to be revived and was declared dead at the scene. </p>

<p>Police said it was 'reasonable to assume' that James' death was caused by either strong tides or a rip.  </p>

<p>Mr Hayman suffered injuries from water inhalation during his rescue attempt and is recovering in hospital. </p>

<p>His wife Melissa and youngest son Tom, remain by his side waiting for him to be discharged.  </p>

<p>Paul said the family holidaying with some family friends and it was not a 'frequented area'.  </p>

<p>He recalled the beautiful moments when James was growing up and stayed with him and his wife Helen. </p>

<p>'We saw them quite a bit. They would stay over at our place sometimes … they've always been fairly close.' </p>

<p>James' tragic drowning on the mid north coast was the third this week.</p>

<p>Steven Pearce, CEO of Surf Life Saving NSW, said that it was a tragic start to the school holidays.</p>

<p>'This is a heartbreaking incident, and our thoughts are with the boy's family at this time,' he said.</p>

<p>'Please, if you're heading to the beach these school holidays or this coming long weekend, swim at a patrolled location and always swim between the red and yellow flags. </p>
