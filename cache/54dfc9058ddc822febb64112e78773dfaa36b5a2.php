<p>The mansion, and its exclusive slice of sand, on the Mornington Peninsula has been snapped up for an undisclosed price within the $4.5-5million price guide. </p>

<p>'We had somebody through the first week of the listing and they eventually purchased the property,' McEwing and Partners director Dean Phillips told The Herald Sun. </p>

<p>Melbourne residents eager for a breather from the city's strict lockdowns have pounced on the chance to own a house with their own private beach </p>

<p>The mansion, and its exclusive slice of sand, on the Mornington Peninsula has been snapped up for an undisclosed price within the $4.5 - $5million price guide </p>

<p>Mr Phillips said from the point the new owners decided they wanted to buy to the deal being completed was 40 days - an impressive effort considering it was accomplished during Melbourne's Stage Four cornavirus lockdown. </p>

<p>The four bedroom home in Balnarring Beach is tucked away in a secluded spot with native gardens at the front which open onto the sand dunes directly from the backyard. </p>

<p>Mr Phillips said the 'chance to own the sand on a private beach' was rare with such properties hard to find anywhere in the country. </p>

<p>The new owners, who Mr Phillips said are business people who plan to use the property as a holiday home, managed to walk through just before private real estate inspections were banned. </p>

<p>The house was built by the previous owners, a builder and stylist, who included an indoor fireplace, gas stove and waterfall kitchen bench in the two-storey property </p>

<p>The new owners weren't the only ones interested either, with Mr Phillips saying the house, which shares a street with just three others was a popular listing. </p>

<p>'I think in times like these, the idea of being able to walk along a beach that is right in front of your house appealed to a lot of people,' he said. </p>

<p>The backyard includes a self cleaning pool, sleek undercover terrace, and outdoor shower, and, of course, that private beach. </p>
