<p>Customers across Australia are rushing to get their hands on a new $49 kid's storage unit from Kmart that's half the price of other brands (pictured)</p>

<p>Camilla purchased three of the storage units to sit beside one another and each product has three deep tubs for storing toys.</p>

<p>'This configuration is three separate units side-by-side and screwed into the wall studs,' she said.</p>

<p>'The equivalent Trofast unit from IKEA is $84, and the dimensions are almost identical.</p>

<p>'Regarding the quality, the difference is minimal but like all things, you get what you pay for. They are very sturdy.'</p>

<p>The product is available at Kmart store locations but is currently sold out online, so shoppers should act quickly if they wish to purchase the product.</p>

<p>Mum Camilla first raved about the product on Facebook and said the product is the budget equivalent of IKEA's Trofast storage unit, which is priced at $84</p>

<p>'Loving our new toy storage solution thanks to Kmart! We were about to spend double the price for the same product at IKEA! Glad we waited,' Camilla said on Facebook</p>

<p>The online post quickly received more than 1,500 'likes' from other shoppers who were amazed with the budget buy.</p>

<p>'How good do these look!' one woman said.</p>

<p>'I'm so getting myself some of these,' another said.</p>

<p>A third added: 'My son's room is full of IKEA! Kmart why do you do this to me? Damn Kmart could of saved me so much!'</p>

<p>Others praised the simple but stylish design and said they'll definitely be heading to Kmart soon to purchase the product themselves before it sells out. </p>
