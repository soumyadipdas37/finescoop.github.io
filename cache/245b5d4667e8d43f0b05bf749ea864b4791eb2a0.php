<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Antonio Rudiger has not been included in today’s squad to face Liverpool - throwing his Chelsea future into doubt.</p>

<p>The Germany international is fully fit but manager Frank Lampard has not included the central defender in his plans to face the Premier League champions.</p>

<p>Rudiger was an unused substitute in the victory over Brighton on Monday night.</p>

<p>Antonio Rudiger has been left out of the Chelsea squad for their match against Liverpool</p>

<p>The decision throws into question Rudiger’s position in Lampard’s plans for the rest of the season.</p>

<p>And with the transfer deadline due to close on October 5, Rudiger could become the subject of interest from rival clubs.</p>

<p>Rudiger has two years left on his contract, but Chelsea - as of yet - have not tried to renegotiate an extension.</p>

<p>Rudiger reportedly helped persuade Timo Werner to join Chelsea as the Premier League side pulled off a major coup in the transfer market. </p>

<p>The RB Leipzig star agreed a deal to join the west London club in a £53million move, seeing off strong contenders Liverpool in landing the 24-year-old.</p>

<p>And fans believe that Rudiger, who plays alongside the striker for their country, Germany, may have had a helping hand in securing the deal.   </p>

<p>According to Bild (via Metro), those rumours seem to be true as the German outlet reported that Rudiger played a 'key role' in convincing Werner to join Chelsea instead of Liverpool.</p>

<p>The publication claims that the defender followed Werner's decision-making closely and often gave him glowing reviews of life in west London. </p>

<p>Rudiger and Werner have a strong friendship, having played in the youth set up for Germany as well as coming through together at Stuttgart. </p>

<p>Rudiger is also believed to have helped the Blues sign Kai Havertz who joined the Chelsea this summer from Bayer Leverkusen in a £89million move and made his debut in the west Londoners' 3-1 win over Brighton last Monday. </p>
