<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Doria Ragland, the Duchess of Sussex's mother, has been appointed the boss of a care company for the elderly.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old, who is a former yoga instructor, is now the Chief Executive Officer for the company Loving Kindness, based in Beverly Hills. </p>

<p>Meghan Markle's lawyer Rick Genow, who represents a string of movie stars, reportedly set up the deal, according to the Express. </p>

<p>Doria (pictured with Meghan), 64, who quit her post as a social worker at a mental health clinic after her daughter married into the Royal Family in 2018, is now in charge of care company</p>

<p>Company documents filed in California earlier this year show Doria is the CEO, CFO and Company Secretary of a firm called Loving Kindess Senior Care Management Inc</p>

<p>The company describes itself as a 'senior care management company' and it says it 'was created to support and give peace of mind to you, your beloved parent, relative or friend'.</p>

<p>The company's website states: 'Our role is to provide a holistic approach to care by guiding and advocating for the client and families while managing and navigating important concerns around health and social issues.'</p>

<p>According to official documents, Meghan's mother has also been appointed as Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary as well as CEO. </p>

<p>The company's address if listed as Beverley Hills, in California, but official documents state the jurisdiction of the company is Delaware.</p>

<p>The phrase 'loving kindness' has links to Buddhism, which has served as an inspiration for both Meghan and Doria.  </p>

<p>One US business expert told the Sunday Express: 'It's not the usual sort of deal for someone like Rick Genow to get involved in.</p>

<p>'When you are as highprofile as Meghan and her family it's understandable why they would keep things as low-profile as possible.' </p>

<p>Meghan's lawyer Rick Genow is also based in Beverly Hills and is a founding partner of Hollywood powerhouse law firm Stone, Genow, Smelkinson, Binder and Christopher.</p>

<p>Official documents list Genow as Agent for Service of Process. </p>

<p>He also represents actor Sir Ben Kingsley and has also worked closely with the film studio Paramount Pictures.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Doria, who quit her post as a social worker at a mental health clinic after her daughter married into the royal family in 2018, was teaching how to make jewellery at a community college in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Doria was a make-up artist on television show General Hospital when she met Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, a lighting director.</p>

<p>She used to sell jewellery that she had made herself to help the family finances.</p>

<p>Meghan was six years old when her parents divorced and she lived with her mother until she was a teenager, when she moved to live with Thomas.</p>
