<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey is reportedly interested in becoming the latest star name to arrive at Arsenal.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old Ghana international has become a household name in Madrid and a mainstay of Diego Simeone's side, though can leave the club if his £44million release clause is triggered.</p>

<p>This summer Arsenal have been heavily linked and now the player is open to making the move happen, according to Goal.</p>

<p>Thomas Partey is said to be hoping for a move to Mikel Arteta's Arsenal this summer</p>

<p>Partey's current deal runs until 2023, though it is reported that the financial impacts of the coronavirus pandemic have resulted in Atletico being unable to offer the player a financially lucrative extension.</p>

<p>Simeone is said to be very keen on keeping hold of his player, though talks between Partey and Atletico have not been fruitful.</p>

<p>Atletico are keen to keep Partey but are said to be struggling to offer a fresh, lucrative contract</p>

<p>Arsenal look set to make a move for the midfielder, though Arteta has already been told he must sell to generate funds this summer.</p>

<p>The Gunners are waiting on bids for the likes of Matteo Guendouzi and Emiliano Martinez this summer, while looking set to agree a loan deal for Sead Kolasinac to return to Schalke.</p>

<p>Exciting youngster Ainsley Maitland-Niles is also heavily tipped to move to Wolves. </p>

<p>This would reduce the sizeable wage bill at the Emirates, which remains crippled by the out-of-favour Mesut Ozil.</p>

<p>After winning the FA Cup, Mikel Arteta is setting about a mass rebuild at Arsenal</p>

<p>Arsenal have already gone about some impressive business, sealing the signature of free agent Willian who has moved across London from rivals Chelsea.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the Gunners confirmed the £27m signing of defender Gabriel from Lille, with Arteta further bolstering his suspect defensive line. </p>
