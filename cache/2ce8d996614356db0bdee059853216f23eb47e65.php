<p>The online streaming giant dropped a trailer for the true-crime show, directed by Jenny Popplewell and Oscar-winning executive producer James Marsh.</p>

<p>The show will bring together 'raw, firsthand footage' and examined 'the disappearance of Shanann Watts and her children, and the terrible events that followed', Netflix says.   </p>

<p>The trailer begins with home doorbell footage showing Shanann arriving back at the family home the night before she was strangled to death by her cheating husband. </p>

<p>A 911 call made by Shanann's friend Nicole plays over the footage with the woman saying she was 'concerned about a friend of mine'.</p>

<p>'I dropped her off at her house at two in the morning last night and I haven't heard been able to get a hold of her this morning,' she tells the 911 dispatcher. </p>

<p>'I've gone to her house and her car's there. She won't answer phone calls, she won't answer text messages.' </p>

<p>The trailer goes on to reveal the lengths the killer went to to distance himself from his family's disappearance before finally confessing to the grisly crimes.  </p>

<p>It reveals Chris sent his dead wife a text message reading: 'Can you call me please?' some point after he strangled her and dumped her body at his place of work. </p>

<p>Footage shows how Chris attempted to deceive law enforcement that his wife had disappeared and taken their children with her.</p>

<p>'There was no note or anything?' someone asks him as he and others appear to be searching the family home. </p>

<p>'No,' Chris replies. </p>

<p>'I don't know what to do right now,' Chris says in another clip where he plays the concerned husband. </p>

<p>During a police interview, he continues the facade, saying: 'I think about like did I cause this? Did I make her feel like she needed to leave?'   </p>

<p>The show also gives a glimpse into what appeared to be a perfect happy family life, with smiling photos of the young family and archive footage of the kids blowing out candles on birthday cakes.</p>

<p>In one home video in the trailer, Chris appears to be the image of the doting father playing with little Bella and Celeste and their toys. </p>

<p>In another, Shannon tells the camera she wants to tell them her 'story' of how her husband was 'the best thing that ever happened to me'. </p>

<p>'Hey guys, my name is Shanann. I just want you to know a little bit of my story,' she says, smiling at the camera.</p>

<p>Her voice is later heard saying: 'I've done everything in my heart to make my family's life better.'</p>

<p>The couple's wedding day footage also plays across the screen.</p>

<p>However, the show reveals that beneath the happy image on the surface there was trouble.</p>

<p>Chris's voice is heard saying 'my mom just never thought she was good enough' while Shanann jokes that she 'tortured' and 'rejected' her husband. </p>

<p>Moments from the police interview room show Chris being interrogated by officers. </p>

<p>The footage shows the moment the net closed in on the depraved killer.</p>

<p>'There's only one person in this room that knows what the truth is,' a detective tells him. 'In about five minutes, there's gonna be two of us.'    </p>

<p>Chris received five life sentences and was sent to the Dodge Correctional Institution in Waupun, Wisconsin, in November 2018 after confessing to the murders.  </p>

<p>After he was jailed, it emerged that he had been having a two-month affair with a co-worker and had planned a new life with her. </p>

<p>He revealed in a jailhouse confession how he strangled Shanann in about four minutes after she found out he told her about his affair and told him he would never see his kids again.  </p>

<p>After strangling her, the killer said Bella came into the room and asked what was wrong with her mom.</p>

<p>Chris then dragged Shanann's lifeless body down the stairs and Celeste also woke up and ran around the house.</p>

<p>He bundled Shanann into their truck and got his two girls into the vehicle with their mom's body.  </p>

<p>The killer drove the girls to his work site where he smothered Celeste with a New York Yankees blanket and threw her body in an oil tank while Bella watched. </p>

<p>He then murdered Bella in the same way also stuffing her body in the tank.  </p>

<p>Chris then buried Shanann and their unborn son in a shallow grave. </p>

<p>Chris faked concern for his family saying his wife must have taken their children and left him. </p>

<p>He later confessed and pleaded guilty to five counts of first-degree murder, one count of unlawful termination of pregnancy and three counts of tampering with a deceased human body in November 2018.</p>
