<p>In an interview, the TV star explained she enjoys wearing sexy lingerie in the bedroom now that she has shed the pounds down to a size 12. </p>

<p>'I've been able to get sexier underwear. I love a négligée - I've got some fabulous satin ones which I think are absolutely irresistible to Ben,' the media personality told Woman Magazine.</p>

<p>She added: 'He doesn't seem to have become any less keen on a bit of how's your father, put it that way. He likes a bigger woman with a big fat bum. </p>

<p>Her gastric band was fitted in 2010, and she famously admitted she used to try and 'cheat' the weight-loss procedure by drinking 'chocolate custard'.</p>

<p>In 2018, it had wrapped around her liver, causing her to feel like she was 'drowning' as her body filled up with fluid. </p>
