<p>Icon: Jennifer Lopez stepped out in New York City looking fierce on Tuesday</p>

<p>Adding a touch of glam to her look the songstress wore towering platform boots and some oversize shades and hoop earrings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lopez is feeling grateful for extra family time amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>She tells PEOPLE that before the lockdowns happened, family dinners where everyone got together were not that frequent.</p>

<p>The star, who has 12-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex-husband Marc Anthony, is engaged to former MLB player Alex Rodriguez.</p>

<p>Rodriguez has daughters Natasha, 15, and Ella, 12, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.</p>

<p>Stylin: The 51-year-old singer looked fantastic in tight jeans and a black blouse. Her coat features a design by late NYC artist Jean-Michel Basquiat</p>

<p>'That's been a huge blessing for us during this time,' she said of their now-nightly dinners.</p>

<p>'Because Alex and I have both separately and now together lived a gypsy-type life, as both of our careers require tons of travel. The blessing of the quarantine for us was having dinner with the kids every night, for months and months.</p>

<p>'I don't think that would've ever happened,' she added, 'and probably reminded us how much we need to do that more.'</p>

<p>Lopez told the publication that she hopes to continue the tradition when life gets back to normal. </p>

<p>What really matters: Lopez revealed to PEOPLE this week that she feels blessed to have family dinners every night since the coronavirus pandemic forced people to stay home</p>

<p>Beauties! The singer paid tribute to her favorite girls on National Daughters Day on Friday</p>
