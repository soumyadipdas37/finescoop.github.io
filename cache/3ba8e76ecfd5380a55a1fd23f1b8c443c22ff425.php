<p>Discussing who she has dated, she said: 'Why don't you say it the other way round? Surely it was their privilege just as much as mine to be with them? But yes, I had some wild and exciting times until I changed my life aged 29.</p>

<p>'Whatever they say about me, I have remained friends with all my exes... except the last one.'</p>

<p>Asked if she means Skepta, she simply said: 'A lady never discusses the details of her private life.' </p>
