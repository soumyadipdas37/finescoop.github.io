<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal's hopes of landing midfielder Houssem Aouar from Lyon are set to take a boost, with the French side looking likely to have found a potential replacement according to reports.</p>

<p>Aouar has been linked with a potential £45million swoop to the Emirates Stadium but Arsenal and Lyon have been unable to agree a fee.</p>

<p>However according to L'Equipe, Lucas Paqueta could be on his way to the French side from AC Milan, which could pave the way for Aouar to complete a Premier League move.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta is desperate for a playmaker to help support his Arsenal attackers</p>

<p>The report claims Paqueta is set to complete his transfer in the next few days after the Italian giants accepted an £18m bid for the Brazilian, with Milan due a percentage of any future sell-on fee.</p>

<p>Lyon had previously had a loan offer turned down with a £15milllion option to buy at the end of the season.</p>

<p>Although the transfer would make Lyon more comfortable with the idea of selling Aouar, there is still plenty of difference between last year's Champions League semi-finalists and the Gunners.</p>

<p>Lyon president Michel Aulas confirmed that they had received a 'tame' offer for the star from the Gunners, as they look to secure £45million for his services.</p>

<p>Aouar starred in Lyon's march towards the Champions League semi-finals back in August</p>

<p>The 22-year-old could well be the missing piece to link Arsenal's midfield and attack, with his creativity likely to help unleash the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexander Lacazette.</p>

<p>Aouar scored nine goals and provided 10 assists in 41 outings for Rudi Garcia's side last season, and was instrumental in them reaching the Champions League semi finals. </p>

<p>Arsenal though are running out of time to complete any deal, with the transfer window closing on Monday.</p>
