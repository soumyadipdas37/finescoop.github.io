<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Real Madrid 'allowed James Rodriguez to join Everton for free' to get the Colombian off their wage bill - but they will take a chunk of any future sell-on fee.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old attacking midfielder completed his move from the Bernabeu to Goodison Park on Tuesday, signing a two-year contract with the option for a further season.</p>

<p>It sees Rodriguez link up with manager Carlo Ancelotti for the third time, having played under the Italian at both Real and Bayern Munich.</p>

<p>James Rodriguez completed his transfer from Real Madrid to Everton earlier this week</p>

<p>The Colombian attacking midfielder will play under Carlo Ancelotti for the third time</p>

<p>The transfer fee was understood to be around £20million but reports by fichajes.com, via Sport, suggest that actually Real allowed Rodriguez to depart for nothing.</p>

<p>The Spanish champions reportedly agreed to the deal in order to get his £140,000-a-week wages off the balance sheet and because he was out of contract next summer anyway. </p>

<p>The same reports in Spain say, however, that Real would be due a percentage of any future sale should Rodriguez leave Goodison Park.</p>

<p>Real compromised on their original ambition to sell the player for a substantial transfer fee after realising there wasn't the market amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The Colombian's time with Real Madrid turned into something of a nightmare in recent years</p>

<p>Reports in Spain suggest Real gave Rodriguez to Everton for nothing to offload his wages  </p>

<p>Having spent two seasons out on loan at Bayern Munich, the Colombian suffered an injury-disrupted 2019-20 campaign, playing just 14 times for Zinedine Zidane's team.</p>

<p>He has now become the headline signing of Everton's summer window as the Toffees aim to improve on their 12th place finish in last season's Premier League.</p>

<p>Ancelotti could hand Rodriguez, who has taken the No 19 shirt, his debut when Everton head to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday afternoon.</p>
