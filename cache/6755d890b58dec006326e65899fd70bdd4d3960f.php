<p>The towel is different to thousands of others on the market, insofar as it is made with a flat-woven top that actively repels sand when it comes into contact with it.</p>

<p>The sisters behind a multi-million-dollar beach empire have launched a new $44 towel that repels sand - and it's already selling out across the world (the towel pictured)</p>

<p>Emma Henderson 35, and Victoria Beattie, 33, from The Beach People launched the Sand-Free Cabana Beach Towel (pictured) weeks ago, but have already been inundated with demand</p>

<p>It is also fade-resistant, made with 100 per cent cotton and is ultra-absorbent, meaning you can still dry off from beach days in record time. </p>

<p>'Our team have worked together over the last two years to develop a patent pending construction that is unlike anything else on the market,' The Beach People's co-founder Victoria told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>'Most other sand-free towels are made of polyester and have a dry, rough texture.  </p>

<p>'During the design and sampling process, we made sure that our sand-free towel was luxuriously soft and absorbent, just like other towels.'</p>

<p>Victoria added: 'We've been blown away by the response to our Cabana Towels. The reviews have been amazing and we’ve had so many repeat orders already.'</p>

<p>The towel is available in three different colourways: sunshine yellow (pictured right), sky blue (pictured left) and nautical blue (pictured left)</p>

<p>The result of their handiwork is a handcrafted 100 per cent Australian-made towel.</p>

<p>The towel is available in three different colourways: sunshine yellow, sky blue and nautical blue. </p>

<p>The company recommend that for best care, machine-wash the towel cold with similar colours on a gentle cycle and avoid the use of bleach. </p>

<p>Those who have managed to get their hands on the towel are  impressed with what it can do, with hundreds saying it has 'transformed' beach days forever (the towel pictured)</p>

<p>Those who have managed to get their hands on the towel so far have been hugely impressed with the towel and what it can do, with hundreds saying it has 'transformed' beach days forever.</p>

<p>'The way these towels repel sand is unreal,' one woman posted on Instagram.</p>

<p>'I'm obsessed with these towels!' another commenter added.</p>

<p>Emma (left) explained that she and Victoria (right) put everything into their unique idea, including housing deposits and husbands' wages</p>

<p>Speaking previously to Daily Mail Australia, New South Wales sisters Emma and Victoria revealed that they came up with their unique idea for the world's first round beach towel on the beach: </p>

<p>'We were sitting on the beach one day when I turned to Victoria and said: "I like the idea of a round beach towel, would you like to do that with me? No one else is doing them",' Emma said.</p>

<p>'I said yes. We decided to call our business The Beach People and never looked back,' Victoria added.</p>

<p>The went at the business plan full throttle - and threw everything into the success of the round towels concept.</p>

<p>'Our husbands' wages, house deposits, we went all in,' Emma said. </p>

<p>'We're so thankful for our incredibly supportive husbands - the experience has been a wild one for sure.'</p>

<p>After designing several of the towels in 2013 and launching The Beach People website, it wasn't long before the idea gained traction.</p>

<p>Within weeks, the girls from iconic bohemian clothing company, Spell, posted a picture of the towel to their 900,000 Instagram followers and wrote: 'This is what I want for Christmas'.</p>

<p>The Beach People's designs were soon swamped with requests, and the sisters expanded into other areas, including bedding, bathroom and accessories.</p>

<p>'At the beginning it was wild,' Emma recalled. 'We sold out of our entire store in the first few weeks and had a six-week waiting list for stock. It took us a few years to catch up on!'</p>

<p>'I still remember when the first person started following us on Instagram that wasn't someone we knew. It was so exciting,' Victoria added.</p>

<p>The Beach People now has fans around the world, the sisters have a multi-million-dollar turnover and they were one of the only Australian brands to have collaborated with Net-a-Porter.</p>

<p>The Beach People was also one of the first Aussie brands to be stocked in Bergdorf Goodman and Selfridges within their first year of trading.</p>

<p>'Being in business is like a never-ending bootcamp that stretches you beyond what you think you can handle and you grow in strength every week of existence,' Victoria explained.</p>

<p>'What used to keep me awake at night now floats by without a concern.'</p>
