<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Whether, like Plumber Manor in Dorset, they’ve been owned by the same family for hundreds of years or are a cherished new project such as Caer Beris in Wales, manor hotels have a family at their hearts. </p>

<p>Packed with history, these hotels pride themselves on delightfully old-fashioned hospitality with generous meals, antique furniture, gardens to wander in and countryside to admire. </p>

<p>There are famous ones, including Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, and Gravetye and Cowley Manors, but there are plenty of others to discover, and some of them have superb deals this year.</p>

<p>When chef Michael Caines bought this Regency mansion near Exmouth in 2017, part of the appeal was the surrounding farmland which he thought would make an ideal terroir for English sparkling wine. More than 17,000 vines were planted, and the first vintage is due in 2021.</p>

<p>In the meantime, there’s a Michelin-starred restaurant and 21 bedrooms in the main house, with high levels of indulgence that include a resident artist and a vista of the River Exe. </p>

<p>New this year are equally luxurious shepherd’s huts that sleep up to five guests. Doubles from £560, including breakfast and lunch (lympstonemanor.co.uk).  </p>

<p>Ockenden Manor, West Sussex</p>

<p>Sussex treat: Ockenden Manor, near Cuckfield, serves afternoon cream tea with scones and finger sandwiches </p>

<p>Tucked into the countryside near the South Downs, next to the boutique-filled village of Cuckfield, parts of this mansion date from the 16th Century. If you want to delve into the oldest part of the hotel, ask for the Master Timothy suite, which has wooden panelling, reading nooks and an adjacent room for children. Downstairs is given over to a bar, drawing rooms and a restaurant which overlooks a semi-wild garden; its wine list reflects the burgeoning Sussex vineyard scene.</p>

<p>The former walled garden now houses a spa with an indoor and outdoor swimming pool; there are also a handful of suites, allowing guests to drift between their rooms and treatments.</p>

<p>One-night Spa Break Getaway costs from £143pp for dinner, B&amp;B with £25 voucher towards a spa treatment from Monday to Friday (prideofbritainhotels.com).</p>

<p>Manor House, Argyll and Bute</p>

<p>Manor House, Argyll and Bute, is 'delightfully gentle' with just 11 rooms and spectacular West Coast views</p>

<p>The Scots don’t do manors in quite the same way as the English – fortified castles were more their thing. </p>

<p>This hotel is one of the exceptions, and it’s delightfully gentle with just 11 rooms and spectacular West Coast views. </p>

<p>It was built for the Duke of Argyll in 1780, next to Oban’s harbour. Staying here is a superb introduction to the Inner Hebrides, from the freshly caught seafood in the restaurant to sunset views from McCaig’s Tower behind the hotel – although watching from the Nelson bar at the hotel with a fine whisky in hand is nearly as good. Sailors can use the hotel’s own mooring. Double B&amp;B from £224 (manorhouseoban.com).</p>
