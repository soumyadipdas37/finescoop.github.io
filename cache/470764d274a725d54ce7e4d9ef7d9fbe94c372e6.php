<p>David, who tied the knot to actress Jessica, 43, in 1998, tearfully discussed racism he and his family have faced in a moving video in June.</p>

<p>The father-of-four detailed his experiences with discrimination as he told fans how he has felt since the death of George Floyd after Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.</p>

<p>Confessing recent weeks 'have been impossibly difficult', he said: 'In a bid to pull myself out of the hole I have been in I've tried to look to the future, the future that my children will step into, but in a bid to do that I have had to look at the past.'</p>

<p>Discussing what his father went through in the 60s, David went on: 'When he arrived in the UK people would check for his tail to see if he had one, he had coffee thrown in his face, hot coffee, he was spat at, he couldn't rent a place to live because it was "No Blacks, No Irish, No dogs". </p>

<p>Family first: The pair shared a close relationship, with A United Kingdom star David often uploading images of his dad on social media</p>

<p>'He would tell me these stories and they felt like something relegated to the past, something that we had moved on from, I stepped into a future that I determined was going to be different.'</p>

<p>The Oxford native said his father wasn't supportive of his dream of being an actor at first as he was scared of the discrimination he'd face, but 'was proud' when he was cast as the King of England in a play with the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p>

<p>However, at that time David was forced to deal with instances of racism as he had 'people who were having to sift through my fan mail because I was getting so much hate mail for playing that role.'</p>

<p>'We eventually left the UK because to be perfectly frank it was a challenge being a black person in my industry there at that time,' David went on. 'But being someone who is optimistic I felt "you know what let's keep moving forward".</p>

<p>'I am going to build on what my dad gave me, on the opportunities the UK gave me, move to America and then played Dr King in Selma, which was an amazing moment for me.</p>

<p>'And then got attacked for playing that role whilst being married to a white woman, and that became a whole other challenge to face, again along these racial lines.'</p>

<p>Reflecting on recent events, he added: 'This is not like losing ones life like George Floyd, but I am trying to let you guys know who have reached out to me asking how I am just what it is we black people face, and you may not always know.' </p>
