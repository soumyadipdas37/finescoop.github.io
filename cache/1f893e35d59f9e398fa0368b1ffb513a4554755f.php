<p>'I have endometriosis, so normally my period and pain is horrendous,' one Amazon reviewer said. 'It was the first month using this patch, and it was a lifesaver! </p>

<p>'It helped stop the pain and cramps. I even managed to leave the house - normally my period leaves me bed bound unable to do anything.'</p>

<p>'I really like these patches,' another shopper wrote. 'Usually, my period pains are so bad that I struggle to sleep and can't concentrate during the day. These patches meant I could sleep undisturbed and get on with my day, relatively pain-free!'</p>

<p>A third reviewer added: 'I suffer from endometriosis and PCOS, which is a double killer! I've tried everything, and nothing seemed to help with the pain until I came across these!</p>

<p>'All I can say is LIFE SAVOUR and worth every penny! They take 10-15 for the patches to start to work but once they do they last hours!! The cooling feeling against the pain is so soothing. Best product ever!!'</p>

<p>Not only are hundreds of shoppers on Amazon vouching for their effectiveness, but influencers are too. This includes the likes of The Anna Edit aka Anna Newton who shared her love for the BEYOU Monthly Patches with her 468,000 YouTube subscribers in a recent vlog.</p>

<p>The easy peel-off back means you can comfortably and discreetly place the patches on any area of the body where you are experiencing pain</p>

<p>To use, remove the patch and peel off the protective film. You'll feel a cooling and tingling sensation which kicks in around 20 to 30 minutes after application.</p>

<p>One reviewer explained how the BEYOU Monthly Patches work a treat at soothing muscle soreness too. 'These are PERFECT if you suffer from painful periods,' she added.</p>

<p>'They start working immediately, and the pain subsides within 15-20 minutes. Very discreet, and the smell is intense but refreshing. </p>

<p>'These also work a treat on sore muscles, used it on my back recently, left it on overnight, and the pain and tension were gone by morning.'</p>
