<p>What a babe! Sophie Anderton proved she's still got it as she uploaded images of herself sunbathing during her scenic trip to the South of France on Instagram on Wednesday</p>

<p>Highlighting her toned frame, the vibrant one-piece featured a low-scoop neckline and daringly cut sides.</p>

<p>The Gossard icon swept her tresses into a sleek bun while shielding her eyes from the sun in square-framed shades. </p>

<p>The Bristol native captioned her images: 'My happy place! It was so [hot] the afternoon when this was taken whilst I kicked back and regenerated my energy levels from a hectic work schedule. </p>

<p>Sophie prioritises her health and wellness following her highly publicised battle with drink and drugs.</p>

<p>The Love Island star once admitted she was 'lucky to survive' her own addiction problems, on which she apparently 'blew £10 million over 13 years', and confided to friends that she was self-harming and had considered ‘ending it all’.</p>

<p>Yet speaking to The Daily Mail in 2015, the media personality dismissed all this as 'light years from where I am now.'</p>

<p>She explained: 'I was very unhappy [in my 20s]. I had no control over who I was or how I looked.</p>

<p>'I was a model but at some point modelling became only one part of what was required of us, and suddenly to be successful we had to be celebrities. </p>

<p>'It’s not something that came naturally. I was terrible at being famous.'  </p>
