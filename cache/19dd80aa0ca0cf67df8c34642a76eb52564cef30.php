<p>'We just wondered... This is probably a little, tiny bit out there, but, you know, I've always said to Isabella, if she doesn't really find a man and she feels like a baby, is there any chance, as a consolation prize, just a little bit of sperm...' she asked.</p>

<p>She added: 'She was joking, she has a funny sense of humour. I don't think she meant it.'  </p>
