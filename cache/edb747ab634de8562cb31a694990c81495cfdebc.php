<p>The Australian woman shared a photo of her children's dinner plates on the Mums Who Cook, Clean and Organise Facebook page, laughing at the creative work her partner had done. </p>

<p>'When you're feeling unwell and your husband makes the kids' dinner. Me: Looks great hun, what's with the Oreos? Hubby: Baby shark... do do do do do do,' She captioned the images.</p>

<p>There were fruits and vegetables on the plate, with some meat, marshmallow creations and cheese but it was the addition of the Oreo cookies that made her laugh - inspired by the Korean children's song Baby Shark.</p>

<p>South Korean children' education company Pingfong helped the Baby Shark chant go viral in 2017, with K-pop bands performing versions of it at their concert. </p>

<p>Naturally many of the parents in the comments said they could relate to the dinner plate, particularly on evenings where they weren't feeling up to making an extravagant meal. </p>

<p>'I bet the kids ate it all too. Good work Dad!' One person said.</p>

<p>'The creativity here is awesome,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'Oh Bless, he tried. What a great hubby. I bet the kids loved it'.</p>

<p>Australian dietitian Susie Burrell has previously shared her ideal children's dinner on a plate, leaning towards a mixture of carbohydrates, protein and fat. </p>

<p>'While we often lean towards pasta and rice-based dishes, unless your child is especially active and involved in sports for more than an hour or more each day, a nightly meal of a palm size serve of protein (fish, chicken, eggs, beans or meat) and 2-3 vegetables or salad is all they need,' she said.</p>

<p>This could translate to being a piece of white fish with vegetables or some chicken cutlets with salad.</p>

<p>If they complain of being really hungry, add a handful of pasta to keep their dinner balanced.</p>
