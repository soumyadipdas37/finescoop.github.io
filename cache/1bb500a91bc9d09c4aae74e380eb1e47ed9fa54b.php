<p>She wrote: 'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p>

<p>'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.'</p>

<p>Kim and Kylie reportedly ushered in the end of the show, after they both threatened to leave, forcing 'momager' Kris Jenner's hand. </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'The family have been locked in an ongoing debate over the future of the show for months now.</p>

<p>The insider added: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements. She doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.</p>

<p>'Filming the show meant having to be in LA with her family - now is free to fly off on holiday, or follow Travis Scott on his next tour.'</p>

<p>It came after sister Kourtney, 41, left the show back in March, later citing a 'toxic environment' to Vogue Arabia. </p>

<p>Kylie and Travis, 28, have been getting closer during quarantine, which they've spent together with daughter Stormi, two.</p>

<p>The power couple was first romantically linked back in April of 2017, before announcing their separation last September.</p>
