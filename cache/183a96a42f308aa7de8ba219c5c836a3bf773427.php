<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Musician Travis Scott is being fined by the city of Downey after a rowdy crowd of 500 people turned up at a McDonald's restaurant to try his new Cactus Jack meal. </p>

<p>Travis, 28, who has a daughter, Stormi, two, with Kylie Jenner, 23, has collaborated with the fast food giant and it's caused quite the frenzy.  </p>

<p>According to TMZ, both Travis and the McDonald's in Downey, California have been cited by the city because they didn't have permits for the gathering. </p>

<p>Oh no! Travis Scott is being fined after a crowd of over 500 people queued up at a McDonald's to try his new $6 Cactus Jack meal because he and the fast-food giant failed to get a permit</p>

<p>Travis reportedly failed to obtain an event or filming permit for the attendees before he showed up to greet fans who were waiting in line to try his meal.</p>

<p>Both citations come with $100 fines, so he and McDonald's won't be too out of pocket as they will have to stump up $200. </p>

<p>Travis was mobbed a week ago when he arrived at the restaurant by fans, who the site report, many of which were not wearing masks or social distancing. </p>

<p>He was forced to run for cover.    </p>

<p>Eat up! Fans went wild to get their hands on Travis' favorite meal— a Quarter Pounder with cheese, a medium order of fries with BBQ sauce, and Sprite — for just $6 by saying that Cactus Jack sent them</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Downey told TMZ: 'Cops reported about 500 people in attendance, and the PD dispatched several units to make sure the large crowd stayed safe.</p>

<p>'There were no injuries and it doesn't seem like any arrests either.' </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted a spokesperson for both Travis Scott and McDonald's for comment.  </p>

<p>The $6 Cactus Jack meal, which has to be ordered through the McDonald's app, consists of a Quarter Pounder with cheese, bacon, and lettuce, fries with BBQ sauce, and a medium Sprite. </p>

<p>USA Today reported on Tuesday that McDonald's were running out of ingredients due to the demand for Travis's new meal, which sounds very similar to the usual Quarter Pounder meal.   </p>

<p>Snuggle up! McDonald's sold a $90 chicken nugget-shaped body pillow as part of the collaboration with Travis and people couldn't get their hands on it fast enough </p>

<p>McDonald's said in a statement: 'In fact, it’s been so lit, some of our restaurants have temporarily sold out of some of the ingredients in the meal.</p>

<p>'We’re working closely with our suppliers, distributors and franchisees to resupply impacted restaurants as quickly as possible.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, McDonald's and Travis collaborated on a new line of limited-edition merchandise that includes a chicken nugget-shaped body pillow.</p>

<p>The collaboration launched on September 8 and also includes T-shirts, shorts, hats, and other items, but it's the 36-inch McNugget pillow that's generating the most buzz.</p>

<p>And despite it's $90 a price tag — and a warning that it won't ship for nine to 12 weeks — the pillow has already sold out.</p>

<p>In fact, all items from the collaboration appear to have already sold out, with some already popping up on re-sale websites even though they haven't shipped yet. </p>

<p>Other pieces from the collab include T-shirts, sweatshirts, and sweatpants with varying McDonald's-themed artwork.</p>

<p>There are also denim shorts with a Cactus Jack x McDonald's logo, another pair of shorts with an Egg McMuffin package pattern, and several caps.</p>

<p>For non-wearable merch, there's a $250 floor rug with a vintage McDonald's menu printed on it, a $30 lunch tray, a $45 lunch box, a $78 blanket, 10 for $25 plastic cups, and a $65 six-foot-tall cardboard cutout of the Travis Scott action figure from his 2015 album.</p>

<p>'I couldn't be more excited to bring the Cactus Jack x McDonald's collaboration to life,' Travis said in a press release. 'We are bringing together two iconic worlds. Including a charitable component was key for me, and I can't wait for people to see what we have in store.'</p>

<p>What a look! The collection also includes these Egg McMuffin shorts</p>

<p>Stylin'! The line, which has already sold out, also included caps</p>

<p>It's an outfit! Most of the pieces for sale were apparel, like this sweatshirt (left) and denim shorts</p>

<p>Must-have? Some of the items are already popping up on re-sale sites</p>

<p>Though the merch has sold out, fans can still get in on the fun by getting Travis' favorite meal at their local restaurant: a Quarter Pounder with cheese, a medium order of fries with BBQ sauce, and Sprite — for just $6.</p>

<p>Customers need only to say that Cactus Jack sent them, until October 4. </p>

<p>'Everyone has a favorite McDonald's meal, no matter who you are,' McDonald's U.S. Chief Marketing Officer, Morgan Flatley said in a press release.</p>

<p>'Travis is a true McDonald's fan having grown up visiting our restaurants in Houston, not to mention one of the biggest musical acts and cultural icons in the world.   </p>

<p>'This is the first time in nearly 30 years we've introduced a superstar's name to our menu — we're excited to bring the Travis Scott Meal to a McDonald's near you starting next week.' </p>

<p>The last time was 1992 with Michael Jordan. </p>

<p>Smell that? McDonald's has sold some wacky merchandise before — in fact, the chain sold Quarter Pounder-scented candles earlier this year</p>

<p>Burn 'em all! The scents include bun, ketchup, pickle, cheese, onion, and '100% Fresh Beef'</p>

<p>For superfans: The line also included a 2020 Quarter Pounder calendar</p>

<p>McDonald's has sold some wacky merchandise before — in fact, the chain sold Quarter Pounder-scented candles earlier this year.</p>

<p>In February, the company launched the Quarter Pounder Fan Club, an offshoot of its official merchandise line, with several items that celebrate its beloved cheeseburger.</p>

<p>The most eyebrow-raising addition was a pack of six scented candles that each smell like a different Quarter Pounder ingredient. </p>

<p>The pack includes six custom scented candles inspired by Quarter Pounder ingredients. There's one each with scents like bun, ketchup, pickle, cheese, onion, and '100% Fresh Beef.'</p>

<p>The idea seems to be that burning them all at once will make a room smell like a Quarter Pounder, but it also give customers the option of burning just an onion-scented or ketchup-scented candle. </p>

<p>The candles joined several other quirky merchandise options on the website, including a sesame seed umbrella, gold-colored locket with the golden arches stamped on it, hair ties, socks, T-shirts, a beanie, and a lounge set. </p>

<p>Swag: The candles were part of a Quarter Pounder Fan Club collection of merchandise, which also includes a locket</p>
