<p>This year, Princess Mary, Prince Frederik and the children have enjoyed a 'staycation' in Denmark on account of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>During the summer, they have spent some time relaxing in the celebrity hotspot of Skagen, a town in the northernmost point of Denmark. </p>

<p>The royals have been known to visit Skagen most summers for the past few years, taking it as an opportunity to step away from busy royal life and enjoy time relaxing with friends.</p>

<p>While there, the couple typically enjoy a range of activities - from swimming to sailing and playing tennis at Skagen Tennis Club as well as long coastal walks. </p>

<p>Princess Mary spent isolation with husband Prince Frederik, 51, and their four children, Prince Christian, 14, Princess Isabella, 13 and Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 9, at Fredensborg Palace in Denmark's east after the outbreak began in March.</p>

<p>The family chose to return to their spring and autumn residence from southwestern Switzerland, where the children had been taking a 12-week course at the Lemania-Verbier International School.</p>

<p>They usually attend the Tranegård School in Gentofte, Denmark, but had been studying at the Swiss boarding school to further their overseas experience.</p>

<p>Denmark gradually lifted its lockdown from April 14, but Mary and Frederik appeared to stay home until mid-May, offering rare glimpses into their personal life by sharing sweet family photos on their official Instagram.</p>

<p>During lockdown, the Danish royal family proved they're just like the rest of us with a snap from May 9, which shows them watching a televised performance of 'The College Songbook' from their sofa, casually dressed in leggings and sneakers.</p>

<p>The future king and queen contrasted their cosy night-in with a photo from 2004 - the year they were married - which shows them in glamorous evening attire watching a production from the royal box at Copenhagen's Royal Theatre.</p>

<p>The striking difference between the photos highlighted how life had changed since the outbreak began, with royalty forced to adapt to confinement just like everyone else.</p>
