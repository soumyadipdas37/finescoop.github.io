<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa and defender Santiago Arias have tested positive for coronavirus, the Spanish club revealed.</p>

<p>The players are in quarantine and will not report for the team's first day of pre-season training on Friday.</p>

<p>Most of the squad underwent their tests on Thursday, but Costa and Arias had tested positive while on holiday, the club said. </p>

<p>Diego Costa has tested positive for coronavirus but is not experiencing any symptoms</p>

<p>Neither man has shown any symptoms of the illness but they must remain in isolation away from Diego Simeone's squad.  </p>

<p>Atletico will begin their season at the end of the month against Granada in LaLiga. </p>

<p>Their first two league matches were postponed because their season ended later as the team participated in the Champions League quarter-finals.</p>

<p>Santiago Arias is the other Atletico Madrid player to have returned a positive test </p>

<p>Coronavirus is causing havoc for other teams in Europe too, with a number of players testing positive having travelled abroad during the break. </p>

<p>L'Equipe report that Marquinhos, Keylor Navas and Mauro Icardi were the latest after Neymar, Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes contracted the illness following a break in Ibiza.  </p>

<p>Ligue 1 began again on August 21 after a lengthy hiatus, but PSG are yet to kickstart their title defence after reaching the Champions League final last month.</p>

<p>Neymar (bottom right) has recently been on holiday in Ibiza before contracting the disease</p>

<p>Marseille and Saint-Etienne were originally scheduled to clash on the opening day, but the fixture was postponed after four players for the home team tested positive. </p>

<p>The Premier League will be wary of similar issues ahead of the new campaign with multiple players having returned from Greece with the virus already. </p>

<p>Should there be a huge rise in case and the need for key players to quarantine, the beginning of the season could be severely disrupted.  </p>
