<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A US WWII bomber has emerged from a melting glacier in Iceland 76 years after it crashed on it way to England. </p>

<p>The B-17 Flying Fortress bomber flew into the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in southern Iceland on September 16, 1944.</p>

<p>Miraculously all of its 10 crew members survived but the wreckage was abandoned and was swallowed up by the glacier.</p>

<p>Today, with global warming stripping the land of ice, the war plane has re-appeared, mangled and torn but still able to provide a fascinating glimpse into the past.  </p>

<p>The B-17 Flying Fortress bomber flew into the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in southern Iceland on September 16, 1944</p>

<p>Locals such as the former mayor of Isafjorour, Guomundur Gunnarsson, see the wreck as a tourist attraction and have rejected calls to clean it up. </p>

<p>An experienced hiker, Gunnarsson said: 'Ever since I heard about the wreck, I've been restless. I found the story compelling, and once I told my friends about it, they became restless too.'</p>

<p>They hiked to the American wreck last week to inspect the area and take photos which were later shared on social media.</p>

<p>Aviation fans will remember the name Eyjafjallajokull, for the site of the glacier is the same as the location of the volcano which erupted in 2010, sending out a cloud of ash which brought European air travel to its knees. </p>

<p>In 1996, the US Air Force finally revealed details behind the 1944 crash.</p>

<p>The US bomber was on it was to England after landing at Keflavik Airport to refuel.</p>

<p>However, the weather conditions were poor in Iceland and the bomber was caught in a down-draught before crashing into the ice cap.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the plane landed on soft snow and kept sliding along its fuselage until coming to an abrupt stop at a snow bank.</p>

<p>One of the plane's wings was ripped off and the engines caught fire.</p>

<p>One of the aircraft's wheels and another part of its motor are strewn across the Icelandic mountainside </p>

<p>Some crew members were thrown into the snow through tears in the fuselage while those left on board managed to escape the plane before it caught ablaze.</p>

<p>The American servicemen had no idea where they were and could not send an SOS to the US Air Force.</p>

<p>They decided to leave the glacier after two days and headed into a valley where they were helped by farmers in the area of Fljotshlio.</p>

<p>The US authorities carried out two expeditions to the glacier by the end of that month.</p>

<p>The first made it to the plane wreck and managed to retrieve some items from it. However, the second group had to turn back without reaching the site.</p>

<p>Over time, the glacier swallowed the plane, but it is now slowly coming back to view due to melting caused by global warming. </p>
