<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Khabib Nurmagomedov's trainer has given UFC fans renewed hope that a rematch with arch-rival Conor McGregor will happen after vowing to push for the fight.</p>

<p>McGregor, 32, had been desperate to gain revenge on Nurmagomedov after losing their bitter blockbuster in 2018 but the fight appeared to be out of the question when he announced his early retirement back in June.</p>

<p>UFC president Dana White recently suggested McGregor could reverse his decision and return next year and Khabib's coach Javier Mendez insists a lucrative fight between him and the Russian lightweight champion is a no-brainer. </p>

<p>Conor McGregor, pictured with his partner, has been enjoying his retirement from fighting</p>

<p>Khabib Nurmagomedov's trainer believes his man will fight McGregor in a rematch one day</p>

<p>Speaking to The Express, Mendez said: 'If I'm the UFC and I'm the president, I'm not going to let that fight off the table.</p>

<p>'Especially if Conor wants to fight and Khabib is still the champion. Then you can make that fight.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't let them [not fight]. That's my job, right? To make the most money for the company.'</p>

<p>McGregor won his first fight in three years back in January after battering Donald Cerrone in just 40 seconds but shocked the world by announcing he would be walking away from the sport. </p>

<p>Khabib defeated arch-rival McGregor in their bitter blockbuster back in October 2018</p>

<p>Javier Mendez (right) said the rematch would be the most lucrative fight in the UFC</p>

<p>McGregor, who beat Donald Cerrone in January, may still change his mind and return next year</p>

<p>Khabib, who defends his lightweight title against Justin Gaethje at UFC 254 on October 24, recently turned his attentions to trying to tempt Georges St-Pierre out of retirement but Mendez believes there is no bigger fight than the one with McGregor. </p>

<p>'Let's put it this way: If that [fight with McGregor] makes the most money out of anybody, then that means it's the most interesting fight people want to see,' he added.</p>

<p>'Obviously I would think everybody still wants to see that fight. Otherwise, why would they pay for it. That's why I think the UFC would do that.'</p>
