<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A furious Piers Morgan clashed with Jeremy Corbyn's brother over his coronavirus conspiracy theories on Good Morning Britain today. </p>

<p>Piers Corbyn, sibling of the former Labour leader, appeared on the programme following his arrest at a demonstration against lockdown restrictions and vaccination programmes in Trafalgar Square, London. </p>

<p>Mr Corbyn today claimed the world was the subject of a 'psychological operation to close down the economy in the interest of mega corporations', who, he says, will see a 'massive gain' out of joblessness. </p>

<p>Presenters Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid, along with the show's resident doctor Hilary Jones, each hit out at Mr Corbyn, with the latter calling the activist 'extremely dangerous'. </p>

<p>Mr Morgan said the guest was relying on 'conspiracy theorist whackjobs' to back up his positions, grilling him on his beliefs about vaccines, climate change and 5G towers. </p>

<p>Losing his temper, Piers Morgan said: 'What you're saying is an insult to the families of every single one of the 800,000 plus people who've died from a deadly virus that's swept this planet'</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn's brother Piers was arrested at a mass-gathering of Covid-19 conspiracy theorists who took to the streets of London to demonstrate against lockdown restrictions and vaccination programmes at the weekend.</p>

<p>The former Labour leader's older brother was filmed being taken away from Trafalgar Square by a gaggle of mask-wearing police officers who hauled him into a van.</p>

<p>It is the third time the decisive anti-lockdown figure has been arrested in just over three months. He was arrested on May 16 and May 30 while protesting in Hyde Park. </p>

<p>More than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters who believe coronavirus is a hoax gathered for the 'Unite for Freedom' rally which started at noon in the capital on Saturday.</p>

<p>Demonstrators called for an 'end to Government lies' and the restoration of all freedoms as they marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>Met Police announced they arrested a 73-year-old man on suspicion of breaking the new coronavirus health protection regulations at Trafalgar Square. </p>

<p>Onlookers flocked to social media to share pictures of Mr Corbyn being hauled into the back of a police van at the central-London tourist spot.</p>

<p>Pictures from the demonstration show Trafalgar Square almost full of protesters - none of whom are wearing masks - holding signs that brand the pandemic as a 'hoax'. When full, the square holds up to 35,000 people. </p>

<p>Other signs claimed masks reduce immunity and likened the restrictions to 'child torture'. One person held a homemade placard on which he had scrawled 'no to mandatory vaccines.'</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn was arrested on May 16 after he used a megaphone to say 'vaccination is not necessary' and '5G towers will be installed everywhere', adding: '5G enhances anyone who's got illness from Covid, so they work together.' </p>

<p>There is no evidence to link 5G and Covid-19 and scientists fear that a rise in measles among children can be attributed in part to unfounded fears about vaccines. </p>

<p>'800,000 people have died from this virus, of course it exists,' Mr Morgan told Mr Corbyn, adding: 'Nobody's made up Covid-19.'</p>

<p>Piers Corbyn said: 'Well they have actually made up these figures and the government has been caught out in the counting, as you well know.'</p>

<p>Losing his temper, Mr Morgan said: 'What you're saying is an insult to the families of every single one of the 800,000 plus people who've died from a deadly virus that's swept this planet.</p>

<p>'For you to come on national television and tell those families what killed your relative doesn't exist is a slap in the teeth and a load of conspiracy theory whackjob nonsense.'</p>

<p>The host asked Mr Corbyn if he believed Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised with coronavirus, invented having the disease. </p>

<p>Mr Corbyn said: 'I don't know if anyone invented it or not, but I would say that the numbers of people getting whatever they're getting is declining rapidly and there is no justification whatsoever for continuing lockdown.'</p>

<p>Piers Morgan said 25 million people worldwide had tested positive for Covid-19, to which Mr Corbyn said: 'You know and I know that these tests don't work.'</p>

<p>Mr Morgan added: 'Over 800,000 people have now died from Covid-19, that is a demonstrable fact.'</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn replied: 'Well, 800,000 people have died, and they've been labelled Covid when it might have been completely something else.</p>

<p>'It is not a pandemic because the numbers dying are nothing different from a normal year of people dying, where they die all the time.</p>

<p>'Secondly, it is not a high consequence infectious disease, and that was decalred by the government and the World Health Operation on March 19.'</p>

<p>Susanna Reid said that more than 40,000 people in this country had died in Britain as a result of Covid. </p>

<p>'What an insult to their family, to say it's some kind of fiction to boost international pharmaceutical companies,' she said.</p>

<p>'Well, it is boosting pharmaceutical companies, and big telecom who are making billions and billions out of this while the ordinary British worker is going to the wall,' Mr Corbyn said.  </p>

<p>He went on to say 'you don't need a vaccine, vaccines cause death', adding that there was already a 'cure' for Covid symptoms, namely 'chloroquine and zinc'. </p>

<p>Mr Morgan then said his guest was stating 'bold lies like hydroxychloroquine being a cure', telling Mr Corbyn he was 'relying on conspiracy theorist whackjobs'.</p>

<p>The host continued: 'What you're saying is an insult to the families of every single one of the people who've died from this virus.'</p>

<p>When asked his opinion on climate change, Mr Corbyn said: 'The sun rules weather and climate, and I can tell you Christmas will be very cold in Britain and we might even have snow here.'</p>

<p>Dr Hilary Jones said Mr Corbyn's statements were 'extremely dangerous' and 'littered with dangerous errors'. </p>

<p>He said hydroxychloroquine and zinc as a treatment had been 'completely dissed' by 'hundreds of different experts'. </p>

<p>Dr Hilary added that the virus had been identified by the electron microscope, and this has 'nothing to do' with other viruses we've seen in the last 40 years. </p>
