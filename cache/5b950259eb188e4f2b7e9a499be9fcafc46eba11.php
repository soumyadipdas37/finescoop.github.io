<p>Home sweet home: Sonja Morgan invited DailyMailTV inside her Manhattan townhouse for a VIP look at her big renovations and chatted with senior correspondent, Alicia Quarles, during a one-on-one tour</p>

<p>'It's a big change for me, I'll tell you,' Sonja said. 'I feel like a visitor!'</p>

<p>Morgan has modernized the luxurious city dwelling which boasts five floors, five bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms which she proudly showed off to DailyMailTV. Prior to the filming of the VIP tour, Sonja, Alicia and the DailyMailTV crew all had COVID-19 tests.</p>

<p>The 4,650-square-foot Lenox Hill townhouse was built in 1899 and features an elevator, sauna, library, at-home gym, and a peaceful outdoor space which adds additional square footage.</p>

<p>Sonja listed her five story townhouse for $10 million back in 2017 but recently slashed $2 million off the asking price amid the pandemic, calling it her 'COVID discount.'</p>

<p>Upgrade: Morgan has modernized the luxurious city dwelling which boasts five floors, five bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms</p>

<p>While waiting for the right buyer, the Bravo star is hoping to get some renters in, which is what originally prompted the renovations.</p>

<p>'I had moved to Columbus Circle to a nice two bedroom with fireplace and a balcony, and I just wanted to lighten up emotionally,' explained. After the move, Sonja decided to 'play landlord' but was worried about what renters may do to the space.</p>

<p>'When people came to stay with me, they were using the family table and heirloom rugs,’ she said. ‘Six kids and two parents and a dog could really take, you know, could really bring some wear and tear.'</p>

<p>Sonja's fellow Housewives, past and present, actually had an impact on the new modern, yet elegant design.</p>

<p>'As a mom, foremost, I have to say this kitchen is what sold me on the house because it's almost like you're indoors, but you're outdoors,' Sonja mused. 'You have full windows that lead right out to the garden.'</p>

<p>Amenities: The 4,650-square-foot Lenox Hill townhouse was built in 1899 and features an elevator, sauna, library, at-home gym, and a peaceful outdoor space which adds additional square footage</p>

<p>'I have a love for nature and this is where I meditate,' she said. 'I have my rose bushes and I have my fish pond.'</p>

<p>Move right in: While waiting for the right buyer, the Bravo star is hoping to get some renters in, which is what originally prompted the renovations</p>

<p>'I said, okay, I'm going to take the advice of Bethenny and Ramona and just go all white, brass, glass - things that really weren't in my vocabulary or my home before,' Sonja explained. Because she's planning on renting, most of the fashion designer’s own furniture has gone into storage.</p>

<p>One of her favorite features of the townhouse is the gourmet kitchen that she has outfitted with top-of-the-line appliances and tons of natural light.</p>

<p>'The great thing about this house is it really is floor-through great views on every single floor,' Morgan admired.</p>

<p>'I have a love for nature and this is where I meditate,' she said. 'I have my rose bushes and I have my fish pond.' She added that in the concrete jungle of New York City she 'really enjoys it out here' in her little oasis.</p>

<p>Sonja delighted in showing off all the hard work that went into her home makeover and made sure to give DailyMailTV all the details. </p>

<p>She dressed for the occasion too, in a vibrant printed skirt and button up from her very own Sonja Morgan New York label.  </p>

<p>Incredible: The center piece of the five-story home is the expansive master suite that stretches throughout the entire third floor</p>

<p>'This house has been really part of reality TV history,' Quarles said during her chat with Sonja at the home. 'Everybody knows this residence. For you, what's it been like bringing viewers in?'</p>

<p>Little touches: Sonja added some truly luxurious 'silk-lined walls' to the five-bedroom home</p>

<p>I ask people, regularly, what do you want to see? And they say they want to see more of the house,' Sonja quipped.</p>

<p>As for what inspired the style of the room, the Bravolebrity revealed a unique and historic muse. 'I had a custom-made four poster bed fashioned after the first bed in the White House by John Adams,' she surprisingly revealed.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Sonja's ex-husband is named John Adams Morgan and the couple, who were wed from 1998-2006, named their now 19-year-old daughter Quincy Adams Morgan.</p>

<p>Personal touches: Sonja's five and a half bathrooms are all outfitted with monogrammed towels</p>

<p>'I tell ya, it doesn't get old,' Morgan responded. 'I ask people, regularly, what do you want to see? And they say they want to see more of the house.'</p>

<p>One feature RHONY fans will always associate with Sonja is a bidet - which she's used throughout the seasons in a variety of ways like washing her lingerie.</p>

<p>'The chandelier I brought back from Venice,' the RHONY star explained while showing off the master bathroom. 'And then I love a freestanding tub and I have, of course, a bidet in every room.' </p>

<p>Patience: Over the years, Sonja has listed the home nearly a half dozen times</p>

<p>'Did it get vicious?' Alicia wanted to know. 'Or maybe was it lighter, because of COVID, because you guys hadn't seen each other.' </p>

<p>Star: The fashion designer joined the Real Housewives of New York in season three and has been a fan favorite ever since; she modeled an ensemble from her very own Sonja Morgan New York fashion label for the DailyMailTV shoot</p>

<p>Safety first: Before filming inside of the renovated townhouse, Sonja, Alicia and the DailyMailTV crew all got COVID-19 tests</p>

<p>'Uh no, we get pretty vicious,' Sonja teased in response. 'But, there's always another season.' </p>

<p>In a preview video for part two airing on Thursday, the cast looked back at their wild trip to The Hamptons where the ladies infamously stripped down to go skinny dipping.</p>

<p>Tinsley Mortimer admitted she was 'shocked' by her behavior during the debauchery-filled trip in an exclusive preview for DailyMail.com, telling Andy Cohen she was a bit 'embarrassed' by her skinny-dipping escapades.</p>

<p>During the reunion the ladies will also try to solve the mystery of who left a vibrator on a plate of chicken piccata. </p>

<p>Andy got straight down to it in the clip, demanding to know: 'Who put the vibrator in the chicken?'</p>
