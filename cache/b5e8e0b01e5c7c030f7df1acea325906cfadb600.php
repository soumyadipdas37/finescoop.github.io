<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are concerned Victor Lindelof is at risk of burnout after just two games, according to reports.</p>

<p>The defender played in the opening game of the Premier League season against Crystal Palace but was rested for United's Carabao Cup victory over Luton on Thursday.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old returned to face Brighton on Saturday but, according to The Mirror, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fears he is struggling with fatigue after a relentless 2019-2020 campaign. </p>

<p>Manchester United are concerned Victor Lindelof is on the verge of burnout after two games</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will discuss plans for him to be rested during the next international break</p>

<p>Lindelof made 47 appearances for United last season but was left out of Sweden's UEFA Nations League clash with Portugal earlier this month and his international coaches are said to be concerned by his physical condition.</p>

<p>The Mirror report that Solskjaer wants the defender to be given a proper rest during the next international break with the Red Devils' boss set to discuss the proposal with Sweden in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>Sweden are scheduled to play three games in six days, with a friendly in Russia before two Nations League matches  away to Croatia and Portugal.</p>

<p>The centre back has played both league fixtures but was rested during the Carabao Cup win</p>

<p>BT Sport pundit Robbie Savage believes United must sign another defender after looking shaky at the back in their dramatic late victory over Brighton. </p>

<p>'Defensively they were terrible. They need a centre half, talking about Sancho coming, they need a defender. </p>

<p>'If they're gonna go further they need a centre half. They need a centre half who can defender one on one situations.' </p>

<p>However, Solskjaer appeared to rule bringing in defensive reinforcements and praised Lindelof for his performance. </p>

<p>He said: 'We've got many defenders here and I put Eric (Bailly) on to bolster the defence, following the runs of Trossard and Maupay.</p>

<p>'For me, we've got enough good centre-backs here at the moment.</p>

<p>'When you concede chances and concede goals, there are two different things you can look at - it's either the team shape, or are there any individual mistakes.</p>

<p>'We're not in our best shape of form, our shape isn't there, we're not sharp enough to stop crosses or follow the runs.</p>

<p>'We're a little bit behind, that's more structural mistakes than individual mistakes. I thought Victor did well today.' </p>
