<p>Robber crabs are the largest land crustacean in the world and many call Christmas Island home.</p>

<p>They can weigh up to four kilograms and measure a metre wide.</p>

<p>Some can live up to 50 years of age.</p>

<p>Robber crabs forage floor for things such as seeds and fruits.</p>

<p>However they also scavenge dead animal carcasses for food - including eating other crabs.</p>

<p>Coconut crabs are exceptional climbers and move fast when it comes to food.</p>

<p>It's name comes from its tendency to take foreign objects and run off with them.    </p>

<p>Robber crabs are closely related to hermit crabs and use seashells or coconuts for protection until they develop a hard abdomen.</p>

<p>Drivers on Christmas Island are asked to 'slow down and drive around' the animals as if their hit by a car they could be killed.  </p>

<p>'Robber crabs behaving badly! A couple of local Christmas Island families had a few extra mouths to feed at their BBQ over the weekend,' the caption read. </p>

<p>'Coconut crabs have an incredible sense of smell and for slow moving creatures they sure move quickly when there's food around.'</p>

<p>Followers of the page were quick to comment on the post, with many recounting their own brushes with the species. </p>

<p>'Lost a sneaker to these buggers one night. Couldn't find a one-legged robber crab,' one person joked.</p>

<p>Another said: 'They are like puppies. We hung out on Dolly Beach feeding them coconuts. So cute!'</p>

<p>Others weren't so thrilled with the possibility of being in the family's shoes.</p>

<p>'This makes me feel uncomfortable,' one person said. </p>

<p>Christmas Island has the largest population of robber crabs in the world.</p>

<p>Visitors are warned the animals are docile creatures but can move quickly when it comes to food and have been known to be behind the disappearances of items.</p>

<p>Tourists are told to hang their food in a tree and keep an eye on it at all times - particularly on Dolly Beach.</p>

<p>Drivers in the area are also asked to 'slow down and drive around' the animals as if their hit by a car they could be killed.  </p>

<p>Australians who live in WA are able to visit Christmas Island despite travel bans across the country.</p>

<p>However tourists were warned that robber crabs were 'protected and respected' on the island.</p>
