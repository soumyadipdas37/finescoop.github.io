<p>Life's a beach: Rachel is currently celebrating 29 years with her husband alongside her family at the swanky Rosewood Miramar Beach hotel in Santa Barbara, California</p>

<p>The power couple now have sons Skyler Morrison Berman, nine, and Kaius Jagger Berman, six, together.</p>

<p>At the time they first met, Rodger thought Rachel was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.   </p>

<p>'I met Rachel in the summer of 1991. She was 19, and I was 22. She was a restaurant hostess, and I was working as a waiter in Washington, D.C., where we both attended college,' he told Harper's Bazaar in 2011. 'I vividly remember the first time I saw her, wearing a tight black minidress, high-heeled pumps, stick-straight hair, and big red lips covered in M.A.C. Chili lipstick (her trademark). </p>

<p>Aww! The fashion designer affectionately pecked her youngster</p>

<p>Sun-kissed: Rachel soaked up the Santa Barbara sunshine </p>

<p>'She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. I quickly learned that she also had more clothes than any woman I had ever seen. I often wondered if she'd ever do an outfit change mid-date.' </p>

<p>Marking the special occasion on her Instagram account, Rachel shared a throwback of herself flashing her diamond engagement ring while snuggled up to her husband.</p>
