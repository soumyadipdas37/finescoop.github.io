<p>Two women have both filed a $15 million lawsuit against a California school district accusing them of permitting sexual abuse by a former school teacher.</p>

<p>The women, whose names were withheld, say they were sexually abused multiple times by Dan Witters, a science teacher at Joaquin Moraga Intermediate School in 1996.</p>

<p>Witters was put on administrative leave after the allegations were made and he killed himself two days later, despite never being charged for the crimes.</p>

<p>Scene of abuse: The Joaquin Moraga Intermediate School, where science teacher Dan Witters allegedly abused students in the 1990s</p>

<p>Both women now accuse the Moraga School District of having received multiple complaints of inappropriate conduct by Witters but chose to do little or nothing to stop it.</p>

<p>It wasn't until recently that they found out about the school's alleged behaviour through a local news investigation, prompting their lawsuit.</p>

<p>Retired Moraga Intermediate School principal Bill Walters, retired assistant principal Paul Simonin and retired superintendent John Cooley are the district's employees accused by the women of assisting in the abuse.</p>

<p>'District administrators, officials, and employees chose to protect their own jobs and reputations rather than protect young girls from a predator,' the claims obtained by Contra Costa Times reads.</p>

<p>Lawsuit: Kristen Cunnane filed similar claims against the Moraga School District this year and said the 'lax environment' of the school permitted the abuse</p>

<p>'After Witters committed suicide, (the) Moraga School District undertook a campaign to conceal and cover up its knowledge concerning past complaints made against Witters.'</p>

<p>The lawsuit is not the first to be filed against the school accusing them and the teacher of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Kristen Cunnane, now 30, was the first to file a lawsuit claiming abuse by Witters.</p>

<p>Former swimming coach Cunnane said 'a lax environment' supplied by the school permitted the harmful environment.</p>

<p>Ms Cunnane's claim was denied in August with her lawsuit seeking unspecified damages filed in September.</p>

<p>'We're not talking about a tap on the butt or a rub on the shoulder,' the women's attorney David Ring told the paper. 'We're talking extremely serious sexual abuse.</p>

<p>'Their reaction... ranged from shock to dismay to anger. They couldn't believe it. Their mindsets always have been Witters did this to us... and tried to deal with that issue.</p>

<p>'So when they found out all of the other complaints the district received, it was a huge setback for them because they realized it should never have happened to them because the guy shouldn't have been teaching at the school.'</p>
