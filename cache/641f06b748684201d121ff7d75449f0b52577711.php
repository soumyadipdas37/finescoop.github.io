<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Amazon has deleted 20,000 reviews written by its top 10 reviewers after it was revealed that some appear to be receiving free products in exchange for five-star feedback.</p>

<p>One such reviewer, Justin Fryer, who was found to have given five-star reviews on average once every four hours, seemed to then go on to sell the same products on eBay. </p>

<p>In August alone he reviewed £15,000 worth of products including smartphones, electric scooters and gym equipment. </p>

<p>Mr Fryer then seemingly sold many of the same products on eBay, making almost £20,000. </p>

<p>The investigation, done by The Financial Times, found that the majority of the products were from small Chinese brands - who in the past have been known to send free items to reviewers for positive feedback. </p>

<p>Online review analysis group, Fakespot, estimates that 58 per cent of products on the UK site had seemingly fake reviews in May</p>

<p>Amazon has said it will investigate the recent findings and that is suspends, bans and sues people who flout its rules (file photo)</p>

<p>When contacted by the FT, Mr Fryer denied posting any reviews which had been paid for but then proceeded to delete his review history from his profile page. </p>

<p>He added that products he sold on eBay which were listed as 'unopened' were duplicates. </p>

<p>Six other top 10-ranked Amazon UK reviewers also deleted their review history. </p>

<p>The FT found that nine of Amazon UK's current top 10 reviewers were dabbling in suspicious behaviour and the majority of five-star reviews were for Chinese products from unknown brands.</p>

<p>Investigators then found many of the same items in forums which offered free products in exchange for reviews.  </p>

<p>Amazon itself was forced to take action on Friday and deleted 20,000 of its reviews. </p>

<p>The Competition and Markets Authority launched a probe into suspicious online store reviews in May. </p>

<p>The UK watchdog estimates that such reviews influence £23billion worth of shopping in the country every year.  </p>

<p>A spokesman told the FT: 'We will not hesitate to take further action if we find evidence that the stores aren't doing what's required under the law.' </p>

<p>Online review analysis group, Fakespot, estimates that 58 per cent of products on the UK site had seemingly fake reviews in May. </p>

<p>The company's chief executive, Saoud Khalifah, told the FT: 'The scale of this fraud is amazing and Amazon UK has a much higher percentage of fake reviews than other platforms.'</p>

<p>Amazon has said it will investigate the recent findings and that is suspends, bans and sues people who flout its rules. </p>

<p>A spokesman said: 'We want Amazon customers to shop with confidence, knowing that the reviews they read are authentic and relevant.' </p>

<p>However, the company was told of Mr Fryer's suspicious activity since early August when one user emailed CEO Jeff Bezos directly when his initial complaints were ignored. </p>

<p>While some of Mr Fryer's reviews were removed, no other action was taken. </p>

<p>On August 13 Mr Fryer was found to have sold an electric scooter for £485.99, just one week after posting a review of the same item on Amazon in which he described it as 'hands down my favourite toy'.</p>

<p>Mr Fryer has said that eBay listings he makes are using duplicate products and denied that he was given free products in exchange for positive reviews.  </p>
