<p>Video posted to social media shows the two men who appear to be in their 20s skateboarding up a ramp that leads to railway tracks.</p>

<p>As the Pacific Surfliner approaches, one skateboarder climbs up the ramp and skates back down as the board comes inches away from the speeding train.</p>

<p>A skateboarder is seen speeding up toward train tracks as an Amtrak Pacific Surfliner rolls by in California</p>

<p>The expression on the skateboarder's face says it all as he narrowly avoids the oncoming train</p>

<p>When another train approached from the opposite direction, the skateboarder's friend decided to tempt fate</p>

<p>The skateboarder appears to climb onto the track just a few inches from the oncoming train</p>

<p>Luckily, he managed not to get hit and avoid injury or even death</p>

<p>In the video’s next segment, the two skateboarders are seen going further up the ramp as the Amtrak train approaches from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The two men let out screams as they enjoy the adrenaline rush.</p>

<p>The image above shows the other skateboarder also taking a risk and speeding up the ramp as the train rolls by</p>

<p>The Pacific Surfliner is the Amtrak line that links San Diego at its southernmost tip to San Luis Obispo in central California.</p>

<p>It is unclear from the video where this incident took place. </p>
