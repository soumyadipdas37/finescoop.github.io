<p>Victoria Police will crack down on regional travel as coronavirus rules ease outside of Melbourne at midnight on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The $4957 fine will apply to any adult who tries to travel out of the city without a lawful excuse.</p>

<p>Deputy Commissioner Rick Nugent said the fine was designed to deter people from Melbourne attempting to run the gauntlet.</p>

<p>Melburnians will be fined almost $5000 if caught trying to sneak into regional Victoria. Pictured: Victoria Police and ADF personnel work at a roadside checkpoint near Donnybrook, Melbourne, on Wednesday</p>

<p>'We do not want regional and rural communities to be put at risk by Melbourne metropolitan people,' he told reporters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'We don't want the virus to spread again.'</p>

<p>Mr Nugent said police would be checking more vehicles at roadblocks out of the city, inevitably leading to long delays.</p>

<p>'We'll be checking every vehicle that is towing a caravan, a camper trailer or towing a boat or a jet ski, or that has a surfboard or fishing rods,' he said.</p>
