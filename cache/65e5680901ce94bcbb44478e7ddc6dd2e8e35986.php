<p>Strong woman: Frank Lampard has revealed that his wife Christine helps him make difficult decisions about Chelsea FC</p>

<p>'But we still probably need him on the weekend, what do you think?' And she goes, ''Does he have a girlfriend, a wife? Is there a problem? Have you spoken to them? Maybe you should speak to them.'' And I'm like, 'yeah'.</p>

<p>'I'm very fortunate to have someone to bounce things off of at home.'</p>

<p>Teamwork: Speaking on the The High Performance Podcast on Sunday, the former England player - who took the helm at Chelsea last July - said Christine is good to bounce ideas off</p>

<p>'She's not picking what fullback we're going to play that weekend, but at the same time, if I have certain issues which are life issues, and actually football issues sometimes, I can definitely go home and ask.</p>

<p> 'It's a different view, a different opinion.'</p>

<p>The sports star also said that she helps him keep his head out of the game sometimes, as he's guilty of getting 'bogged down'. </p>

<p>Family: The couple married in December 2015 at St Paul's church in Knightsbridge, West London, and welcomed their daughter Patricia, two, in 2018 </p>

<p>Frank said: 'Christine has a bit of a joke with me at home when we're watching football constantly all the time. </p>

<p>'She does reflect on the fact that it's only kicking a ball... She's almost like, you're becoming really, really intense about this, and maybe not seeing a bit of clarity in this instance.' </p>

<p>The couple married in December 2015 at St Paul's church in Knightsbridge, West London, and welcomed their daughter Patricia, two, in 2018.</p>

<p>Christine is a also stepmother to his eldest daughters Luna, 15, and Isla, 13, who he shares with former partner Elen Rivas, 45.</p>

<p>The Premier League season is scheduled to begin on 12 September, with pre-season fixtures for Chelsea expected to be announced in the coming weeks.  </p>

<p>Christine recently admitted she struggled with being apart from her family while isolating with husband Frank and their daughter Patricia.</p>

<p>She said: 'I'm seeing my family for the first time at the moment. That's been the hardest thing for me...</p>

<p>Support: Opening up further about his relationship with the Irish beauty he added: 'She definitely coaches me and I do throw a lot of things off Christine'</p>

<p>'When I finally got to see my family, it was emotional, which I'm sure everyone across the country has been finding.</p>

<p>'We have been in touch constantly throughout, but when you have a little one, you really appreciate the relationship they have with their grandparents and I don't like them not being part of that and missing out on all the tiny things they do day-to-day.' </p>

<p>Christine added that Patricia has been delighted to have Frank - who gets tested for coronavirus twice a week - home for the majority of the lockdown after football was put on hold during the peak of the pandemic.</p>

<p>She admitted though that her little girl isn't used to having her dad around so much, joking: 'I am 100% her world because I've been with her 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>'Frank actually being at home for a big chunk at the beginning of lockdown was fantastic, as much as it was for the awful reasons we were there. It was just lovely.'</p>
