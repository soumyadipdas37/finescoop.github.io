<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bachelor fans have been speculating for weeks about whom Locky Gilbert will choose during Thursday's grand finale.</p>

<p>And while Channel 10 has made sure the outcome remains a safely-guarded secret, viewers have developed some very compelling theories.</p>

<p>From 'pulling a Honey Badger' to unconfirmed rumours he was dumped by the winner - here are the top Bachelor predictions you need to know.</p>

<p>Revealed: Every theory, rumour and prediction about The Bachelor finale you need to know - as Irena Srbinovska (left)  and Bella Varelis (right) battle it out for Locky Gilbert's heart</p>

<p>Locky picks a winner and they're still happily together </p>

<p>The most widely accepted theory is that Locky follows in the footsteps of Matty Johnson, Sam Wood and Tim Robards by picking one winner and subsequently remaining in a relationship with her.</p>

<p>This is the theory that Locky and Channel 10 have insisted will eventuate during this season's finale.   </p>

<p>On Monday, Locky shut down rumours he's no longer dating his winner, telling TV Week he's '110,000 per cent in love' with the winner and can't wait to 'tell people how great she is'.</p>

<p>Traditional outcome: The most widely accepted theory is that Locky follows in the footsteps of Matty Johnson, Sam Wood and Tim Robards by picking one winner and subsequently remaining in a relationship with his chosen woman </p>

<p>'Excited is an understatement,' Locky said of finally being able to reveal his girlfriend later this week. 'I cannot wait. I am beyond excited to be able to finally say it out loud... who I have chosen to spend the rest of my life with.' </p>

<p>Channel 10 also confirmed to Daily Mail Australia last Friday that Locky and the show's winner are 'still in a relationship and very happy.'</p>

<p>Locky picks Irena but they have since broken up </p>

<p>Another possible outcome is that Locky picks Irena as the winner during the finale, before splitting up with her some time later. </p>

<p>This theory began circulating last Thursday when Irena 'liked' an Instagram comment from a reality TV fan who said she was 'too good' for the former Australian Survivor star. </p>

<p>Hit it and quit it? Another possible outcome is that Locky picks Irena as the winner during the finale, before splitting up with her some time later </p>

<p>'You're too good for him tho!!!' the fan wrote alongside two rose emojis. Irena was among the seven users who liked the comment. </p>

<p>While it's not conclusive evidence, the social media activity suggests that Irena and Locky quietly split after filming the finale in July.</p>

<p>Of course, there are other possible interpretations.</p>

<p>What does it mean? Last Thursday, the 31-year-old nurse 'liked' an Instagram comment from a reality TV fan who said she was 'too good' for the former Australian Survivor star</p>

<p>Irena's 'like' could be a telling clue that she doesn't win the show at all - despite Sportsbet and TAB tipping her for first place.</p>

<p>Alternatively, Irena may have liked the comment by accident, which is quite easy to do when scrolling through Instagram quickly.</p>

<p>Locky picks no one </p>

<p>Another compelling theory is that Locky refuses to choose either women and walks away from the show alone. </p>

<p>Will he pull a Honey Badger? Another compelling theory is that Locky refuses to choose either women and walks away from the show alone</p>

<p>Trailers have hinted that this year's Bachelor's finale will be 'an ending you won't believe', suggesting that fans may be blindsided by an usual outcome. </p>

<p>The show's executive producer, Hilary Inness, actually hinted at a Honey Badger-style ending in an interview with Media Week last month. </p>

<p>'Locky, by his own admission, falls in love with more than one girl,' Ms Inness said.</p>

<p>Couldn't make his mind up: For those who didn't watch the 2018 season of The Bachelor, rugby union player Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins infamously chose no one during his finale</p>

<p>'Famously the Honey Badger couldn't choose someone, and now we have a Bachelor who has fallen in love with more than one girl, which is a first for us.'</p>

<p>For those who didn't watch the 2018 season of The Bachelor, rugby union player Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins infamously chose no one during his finale.</p>

<p>Locky picks both (for the camera) and then dumps one </p>

<p>On Wednesday, The Wash alleged that Locky filmed two different 'winner's endings': one with Bella and the other with Irena. </p>

<p>According to the publication, the reason for filming alternative endings was to prevent loose-lipped crew members from leaking spoilers to the press. </p>

<p>If true, it would have been an extremely awkward task for Locky, who would have had to tell one of the women he was in love with her on camera, only to break it to her afterwards he'd actually chosen someone else. </p>

<p>'Producers wanted to really change it up this year': On Wednesday, The Wash alleged that Locky filmed two different 'winner's endings': one with Bella and the other with Irena</p>

<p>Awkward! If true, it would have been an extremely awkward task for Locky, who would have had to tell one of the women he was in love with her on camera, only to break it to her afterwards he'd actually chosen someone else</p>

<p>'Producers wanted to really change it up this year and confuse viewers and keep the suspense. It also made sure no one on set would leak the ending,' a source claimed.  </p>

<p>However, a Channel 10 spokesperson denied this was the case.</p>

<p>Locky picks Bella but she rejects him, then he begs Irena to take him back</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Daily Mail Australia has heard whispers that Locky is rejected by his winner, then begs his heartbroken runner-up for another chance.</p>

<p>Doing the switch-a-roo? Rumours are swirling that Locky dumps Irena and chooses Bella Varelis in the finale - but Bella turns him down because she can't handle the fact he is also in love with Irena</p>

<p>If the rumours are to be believed, Locky actually dumps Irena and chooses Bella Varelis in the finale - but Bella turns him down because she can't handle the fact he is also in love with Irena.</p>

<p>He then makes a sudden about-turn and begs the 31-year-old nurse to take him back, and she tentatively agrees to begin a relationship with him.</p>

<p>These rumours are still unconfirmed, however, and the actual outcome of The Bachelor remains a closely guarded industry secret. </p>

<p>Back on? Locky then makes a sudden about-turn and begs Irena to take him back, and she tentatively agrees to begin a relationship with him</p>
