<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Throughout his time in the spotlight, David Beckham has become known for his boundary-pushing attitude to style. </p>

<p>And the football ace, 45, proved he has passed on his style to two of his sons Romeo, 18, and Cruz, 15, as he took them, along with their sister Harper, nine, to wife Victoria's digital London Fashion Week show in a series of garish looks.</p>

<p>Edgy: David Beckham, 45, proved he has passed on his style to two of his sons Romeo, 18, and Cruz, 15, as he took them, along with their sister Harper, nine, to wife Victoria's digital London Fashion Week show in a series of garish looks</p>

<p>Victoria was forced to ditch her usual London Fashion Week catwalk show in favour of a digital presentation, but she had her number one fans by her side as they attended in their somewhat edgy ensembles.</p>

<p>The Spice Girl turned fashion designer shared images of her family throughout the day while David was also documenting things - including his own outfit.</p>

<p>Sharing snaps showing him with the kids - bar Brooklyn - David penned over the top: ''I think the boys may be judging my socks with sliders'.</p>

<p>Showing their edgy styles run in the family, Cruz opted for a bang on-trend Dior saddlebag worn across his chest. Romeo proved himself to be quite the trendy lad himself as he went for a sleeveless knitted tank top. </p>

<p>Pooped! Following the show, David took to Instagram to make a joke out of his socks and sandals look while Victoria, 46, also joked about the day as she shared a snap while lying in bed and hinted the day had left her exhausted</p>

<p>Way back when: Throughout his time in the spotlight, David has become known for his boundary-pushing attitude to style (pictured in 1998, in his now iconic sarong)</p>

<p>David thanked Dior's creative director Kim Jones for the ensembles. </p>

<p>Victoria, like most designers, has opted for a digital presentation to showcase her latest collection during London Fashion Week as the coronavirus pandemic uproots fashion weeks around the globe. </p>

<p>Victoria captioned her snaps: 'My favourite (and only) guests this season! love you all so much <?php echo e('@'); ?>davidbeckham <?php echo e('@'); ?>romeobeckham <?php echo e('@'); ?>cruzbeckham #HarperSeven xx we missed you <?php echo e('@'); ?>brooklynbeckham <?php echo e('@'); ?>nicolannepeltz.'</p>

<p>Sweet: The designer shared snaps of husband David, sons Romeo, 18, and Cruz, 15, and daughter Harper, nine, donning their face masks ahead of the digital presentation</p>

<p>After the show, she felt the need to unwind however. </p>

<p>The designer took to Instagram to share a snap with the words written over the top reading: ' Victoria captioned her snaps: 'My favourite (and only) guests this season!...</p>

<p>'love you all so much <?php echo e('@'); ?>davidbeckham <?php echo e('@'); ?>romeobeckham <?php echo e('@'); ?>cruzbeckham #HarperSeven xx we missed you <?php echo e('@'); ?>brooklynbeckham <?php echo e('@'); ?>nicolannepeltz.'</p>

<p>The Beckhams ensured they all had their own masks, with Harper opting to wear a purple floral one to match her dress.</p>

<p>Sweet: Victoria shared a cute snap with her daughter Harper at the event, with the caption 'Me and my favourite little lady'</p>

<p>Hours earlier Victoria had shared a snap of daughter Harper donning a mini version of one of her designs ahead of the digital showcase. </p>

<p>Ahead of David's 40th birthday five years ago, a poll revealed David's worst and most shocking fashion fails throughout his years in the spotlight.</p>

<p>His biggest style shocker was his fluorescent peroxide blond hairstyle when he was playing for Real Madrid in 2007, which contrasted starkly with a slight burned tan.</p>

<p>Woah! David is seen in 2000 in a somewhat questionable leather mac</p>

<p>In second place is the matching his-and-hers Versace leather outfits worn with Victoria Beckham in 1999. In third place was the famous cornrow hairstyle from 2003, which showed off inches of pink scalp.</p>

<p>The dodgy sarong Becks showcased at the 1998 World Cup while again out with his wife - complete with clunky leather slide-ons - came fourth.</p>

<p>In fifth place was his now deeply unfashionable 'curtains' haircut he had during the years when he was first dating Victoria back in 1996.</p>

<p>While the majority of the Beckham clan were at the show, Brooklyn has been hard at work elsewhere as he has joined the nonprofit #TOGETHERBAND campaign and using his platform for young climate change activists.</p>

<p>Speaking about the project, he said: 'Climate change is something that is concerning a lot of people, including me. My first march was in 2019 and it was so powerful. It’s really made me want to help and something we need to sort out'.</p>

<p>Important issue: Brooklyn, pictured with his friend Louis Valentine-Berry, has been hard at work elsewhere as he has joined the nonprofit #TOGETHERBAND campaign and using his platform for young climate change activists</p>
