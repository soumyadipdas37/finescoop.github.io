<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Block's Jimmy and Tam came first for their master en suite on Sunday night.</p>

<p>A dreamy pink and gold bathroom led to the married couple scoring 29 points from the judges, leaving them tied for first with Luke and Jasmin. </p>

<p>But Jimmy and Tam's room was missing one feature that all the other contestants included, which almost led to their undoing. </p>

<p>Can you spot what's wrong with this Block bathroom? See inside the dreamy pastel pink and gold en suite that lead to Jimmy and Tam's victory... but there was one thing missing</p>

<p>Judge Darren Palmer noted that a bathtub was missing during the episode.  </p>

<p>'That has come because of the size and the floor space they have allocated to this bathroom,' he said.</p>

<p>But Shaynna Blaze said the bathroom was still sufficient for a couple despite its smaller size.  </p>

<p>'If we didn't have the others to compare to, I would say this is absolutely a perfect size for a couple,' she said. </p>

<p>'I, as a buyer, would prefer a big walk-in robe as opposed to a bath in my master en suite because I can have a bath in the other area.'</p>

<p>It's a bathtub! Judge Darren Palmer noted that Jimmy and Tam's bathroom did not have a bathtub, while all of the other master en suites did</p>

<p>Jimmy and Tam included a bath in their upstairs bathroom, so they still have at least one in their build. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the en suite featured white terrazzo floor tiles and statement pink wall tiles, which was praised by the judges.    </p>

<p>There was also a gold shower head and tapware, which added a vintage 50s flair.   </p>

<p>'I've got to say the colour palette, which they are using all the way through, is divine,' Shaynna said.  </p>

<p>Pink is the new pink! The bathroom featured white terrazzo floor tiles and statement pink wall tiles, which was praised by the judges. There was also a gold shower head and tapware, which added a vintage 50s flair</p>

<p>But Shaynna and co-judge Neale Whitaker were both critical of the lighting in the bathroom, which led to them loosing some points. </p>

<p>'The one thing I would mention is the choice of light there, that little sconce is a bit disappointing,' Neale said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Shaynna said it was 'not a good lighting plan'. </p>

<p>Overall, the positives outweighed the criticisms and the couple were able to take home 29 points and a tied first place position. </p>

<p>The Block continues on Channel Nine at 7pm on Monday. </p>

<p>Victory! Overall, the positives outweighed the criticisms, and the couple were able to take home 29 points and a tied first place position</p>
