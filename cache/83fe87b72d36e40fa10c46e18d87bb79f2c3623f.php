<p>A source told The Sun the new redundancies were a bid to save the label.</p>

<p>They said: 'Victoria is devastated. These are really tough times and no one is exempt from the pandemic's clutches.</p>

<p>'This business is her pride and joy. It has never been about money. She hasn't even paid herself for the past three years. She is doing all she can simply to keep as many people in work as possible.'</p>

<p>Victoria and her ex-footballer husband David, 45, are estimated to be worth £355million. </p>

<p>A spokesman for Victoria said: 'We have built a new strategic vision to streamline and future-proof the brand and, sadly, have to make redundancies to deliver this.' </p>

<p>The fashion line, which she launched in 2008, made losses of £12.3million in 2018. </p>

<p>In June it was reported that the designer was loaned a £6.4 million lifeline to save the fashion empire.</p>

<p>The company has allegedly racked up £42 million worth of losses over the past four years.  </p>
