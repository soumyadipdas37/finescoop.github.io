<p>Resurfaced posts show how Lisa Curry (right) and Grant Kenny's late daughter Jaimi (left) was fiercely protective of her famous mother against cruel trolls</p>

<p>In 2014, according to New Idea, Jaimi publicly slammed false reports that her mother Lisa's desire to have more children had ulterior motives, namely revenge</p>

<p>Lisa, who was at the time dating much younger ex-boyfriend Joel Walkenhorst, then 31, experienced backlash for wanting to grow her family.</p>

<p>The nasty online comments claimed her desire to mother another child at 51 was solely to 'get back' at ex-husband Grant Kenny for fathering a daughter with radio star Fifi Box in 2013. </p>

<p>Fifi kept the father of her daughter Beatrix ‘Trixie’ Belle Box private for three years, before confirming Grant as Trixie's dad in 2016. </p>

<p>The pair secretly dated in 2012 but broke up just before she revealed she was pregnant with her first child. </p>

<p>Lisa’s late daughter Jaimi stepped up to defend her mum at the time: 'Mum wanting a child had nothing to do with Fifi... Mum had talked with us about her thoughts on going through IVF before Trixie was conceived.'</p>

<p>In her impassioned social media post, she continued: 'You never know the conversations we have had as a family, or the timing of these. It’s upsetting to read such nasty things being said about our mother, without people knowing her personally.'</p>

<p>The family appeared to share no bad blood between them, with Jaimi often babysitting her stepsister Trixie.  </p>

<p>However, it's understood Jaimi had long battled an eating disorder, with her family supporting her through years of treatment at a private clinic.</p>

<p>'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm that our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read the statement, which was written by Jaimi's father, Grant on Monday.</p>

<p>'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued.  </p>
