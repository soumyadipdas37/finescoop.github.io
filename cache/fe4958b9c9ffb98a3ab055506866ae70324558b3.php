<p>Earlier this month, Ant and Dec revealed during a rare interview on This Morning that they're tested for coronavirus every four days in order to present their much-loved shows together.</p>

<p>The pair kicked off their segment by hugging on air as they explained why they don't need to keep a social distance from each other. </p>

<p>Removing their protective face masks, Dec shared: 'We don't need these with each other. We're in a cohort!', while Ant added: 'We're working on BGT and other things so we get tested every four or five days so.</p>

<p>Event: The trio spoke about Ant and Dec's new book Once Upon A Tyne, and also looked back at their 30-year career in television</p>

<p>'We form a cohort with our households. We have to be careful of where we go and who we see. Nothing new there!' </p>

<p>They later touched on marking 30 years in showbusiness as they promoted their new book Once Upon A Tyne. </p>

<p>Ant shared insight into their new project by adding: 'We wanted it to be like a conversation and us talking through a story. Every chapter will be about a show we work on and the backstage stories of them.'</p>

<p>Cohort: Earlier this month, Ant and Dec revealed on This Morning that they're tested for coronavirus every four days in order to present their much-loved shows together </p>

<p>Safety first: Ant explained that to film I'm A Celeb (pictured in 2019) and BGT they 'form[ed] a cohort with our households. We have to be careful of where we go and who we see'</p>

<p>On their time in the spotlight, Dec said: 'It feels like it's gone in the blink of an eye. It bizarrely feels like we're only getting started. I don't think you ever feel like, 'oh I've made it.'</p>

<p>'There is an element that someone will knock on the door and say that well it was meant to be for someone else and we go, "oh, okay."</p>

<p>'We love it, we're very lucky to be involved in three of the biggest shows on TV. We love working together, we love each other and being together and working together.'</p>
