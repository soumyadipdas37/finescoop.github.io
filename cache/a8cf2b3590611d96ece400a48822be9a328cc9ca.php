<p>RiRi's accident was met with speculation of a physical altercation, after she was assaulted by then boyfriend Chris Brown in February of 2009</p>

<p>Rihanna's accident comes after just weeks after a similar incident where Simon Cowell was rushed to hospital after breaking his back after falling off an e-bike.</p>

<p>The TV star underwent surgery last month, after breaking his back 'in a few places'.</p>

<p>The images of RiRi's injuries were met with speculation of a physical altercation, after she was assaulted by then-boyfriend Chris Brown in February of 2009.</p>

<p>Brown, 31, took a plea deal, for which he was given five years probation and ordered to stay 50 yards away from Rihanna.</p>

<p>She's recently been promoting her groundbreaking new skincare line Fenty Skin, following the massive success of Fenty Beauty (pictured in December, 2019)</p>

<p>The Love on the Brain artist subsequently dropped the restraining order in 2011, and they briefly got back together in 2012. </p>

<p>A 2012 interview with Rihanna recently resurfaced on the podcast Oprah’s SuperSoul Conversations, in which she discussed her undying bond with Brown.</p>

<p>She said: 'We've been working on our friendship again. Now we're very very close friends. We've built up a trust again, and that's — we love each other and we probably always will. </p>

<p>'And that's not something we're ever going to change. That's not something you can shut off, if you've ever been in love.'</p>

<p>Confusion over the fact that the interview was not conducted recently led fans to believe the couple might be rekindling their flame.</p>

<p>A source has since told HollywoodLife: 'The chance of them rekindling the love they had would be as close to impossible as things could be. They were once in a relationship that was all or nothing, and it ended. </p>

<p>A 2012 interview with Rihanna recently resurfaced on the podcast Oprah’s SuperSoul Conversations , in which she discussed her undying bond with Brown</p>

<p>'They won’t dive into something like that again with each other. They know that it wouldn’t be healthy for all the progress they have made.'  </p>

<p>The insider added: 'So now that everyone is talking about them again, so be it. They are looking for it to subside and they both will continue with their lives as it has been, which they are very happy about. They have proven that they can move on, they just hope others can do the same.'</p>

<p>Rihanna has most recently sparked relationship rumors with A$AP Rocky, 31, after her two-year relationship with Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel, 31, ended back in January. </p>

<p>But she's been keeping busy with her long-overdue ninth studio album, her recently-released Fenty Skin line and her $25million documentary, due out next summer. </p>
