<p>A pedestrian chased a white transit tipper suspected of fly-tipping down a remote pathway strewn with rubbish in Long Sandall, Doncaster</p>

<p>Video footage shows the track covered in rubbish and building rubble, including large pieces of cardboard, next to a white van filled with bricks</p>

<p>As the pedestrian approaches the white transit tipper, an individual standing outside the truck gets back into the vehicle and drives away, the video shows.</p>

<p>The person filming walks down the path behind the suspected fly tipper's truck and watches the individual drive away from the incident.</p>

<p>Twitter page We Hate Fly-Tipping shared the video on Twitter on September 28, where it has received more than 39,000 views from angry residents.</p>

<p>The caption alongside the video read: 'A gold medal should go to this member of the public who sprinted down a track to catch a fly-tipper on video in Long Sandall, Doncaster.' </p>

<p>People expressed their fury at the suspected fly-tipping, with some urging drivers to take their rubbish to the dump instead.</p>

<p>South Yorkshire Police said that it does not investigate fly-tipping, adding that this issue is dealt with by the local council.</p>

<p>Save Long Sandall, who posted the video on Facebook on June 9, said that the incident had been reported to the 'relevant authorities'.</p>

<p>Doncaster was previously revealed to be the fourth-worst fly-tipping hotspot in the UK in 2019, Doncaster Free Press reported.</p>

<p>As the pedestrian approaches the suspected fly-tipper, an individual standing on the pathway gets back into the van and drives away in the white transit tipper</p>

<p>More than 23,000 fly-tipping incidents occurred in Doncaster in 2018 and 2019, while Sheffield ranked fifth with 22,000 incidents recorded across the same period.</p>

<p>Recycling firm The Furniture Recycling Group also found that 501,226 incidents of fly-tipping were recorded across 77 of England's major towns and cities over the same two-year period. </p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has reportedly also affected fly-tipping, with staff from many departments being moved to other areas to help with the crisis, Doncaster Free Press reported. </p>

<p>Reports seen by councillors revealed that only 59 per cent of fly-tipping calls were cleared in the seven-day target period, whereas the council normally aims to clear 85 per cent of reports in a week.</p>

<p>The coronavirus lockdown, which came into force in March, also saw more household rubbish being produced as people stayed in their homes for longer periods of time than normal.</p>
