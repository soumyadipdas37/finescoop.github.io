<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An employee at a Chicago pizza restaurant has been fired after a social media post circulated claiming she wrote 'quit your job' on a police officer's receipt.</p>

<p>A customer copy of the Happy Camper receipt shared online by a friend of the cop shows 'Cassie C' as the server and lists $66 worth of food ordered around 7.30pm on Sunday.</p>

<p>According to the social media post, the cop ordered dinner in 'full uniform and riot ready' and spotted the message before leaving the restaurant. </p>

<p>However 'he still tipped, and was the gentleman that he always has been.'</p>

<p>A Chicago police officer said he noticed the message 'quit your job!' written on his receipt from Happy Camper pizza restaurant Sunday night</p>

<p>According to a social media post, the cop ordered dinner in 'full uniform and riot ready'</p>

<p>He spotted the message before leaving the restaurant (pictured) and tossed the food in the trash when he got outside for fear someone had 'spit in it'</p>

<p>He's said to have walked outside and tossed out the 14-inch pepperoni pizza, Blackened Chicken Caesar salad, Mozzarella Bread Stix and more in the garbage 'for fear that someone spit in it.' </p>

<p>'Everyone is entitled to their feelings and political views, but definitely not when it comes to a professional environment,' the post continued. 'Where did people learn to disrespect the people that are paying their bills?'</p>

<p>The widespread social media post put the incident down to a 'lack of management and professionalism.' Calling the behavior 'unacceptable', the author asked 'how can anyone allow this to happen?'</p>

<p>The restaurant in Wrigleyville said it 'immediately took action to terminate the employee' after learning about it on Monday morning.</p>

<p>'Our company works incredibly hard to provide a positive and enjoyable experience for all customers,' a Facebook post from Monday read.</p>

<p>'We sincerely and humbly apologize - the action of one does not accurately reflect who we are as a company.</p>

<p>'We have zero tolerance for any behavior that doesn't give our customers the full respect they deserve.'</p>

<p>A friend shared the details in a Facebook post that was widely circulated and called the behavior from staff 'unacceptable'</p>

<p>He still left a tip on the receipt naming Cassie C as the server 'and was the gentleman that he always has been,' a friend wrote online. The customer copy is pictured</p>

<p>Happy Camper received more than 500 comments on its Facebook post apologizing.</p>

<p>The restaurant also said in a comment that it has reached out to the police officer to personally apologize, offer a full refund and provide a gift card to his restaurant of choice.</p>

<p>The name of the officer was kept confidential.</p>

<p>Many praised the venue for firing the employee but others suggested it would've been a better idea to get Cassie C to meet with the officer and apologize or to provide adequate training.</p>

<p>Others said they hoped Happy Camper had done the appropriate research before firing the employee, noting previous similar incidents that turned out to be a hoax.</p>

<p>In one case last year police in Oklahoma someone falsely claimed that a Starbucks employee wrote 'pig' on his coffee cups.</p>

<p>Two people were fired, including a manager who later announced she's suing the company for wrongful termination. </p>

<p>The restaurant in Wrigleyville, Illinois fired the employee on Monday and reached out to the police officer to apologize, offer a full refund and provide a gift card to his restaurant of choice</p>
