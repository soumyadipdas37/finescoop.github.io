<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A suspended nurse who has compared public health restrictions to the Holocaust has become the new face of the anti-vaccination movement in Britain.</p>

<p>Kate Shemirani, who is due to host a rally in Trafalgar Square next Saturday, has promoted bogus claims on social media that vaccines are poisonous.</p>

<p>On Twitter earlier this week, she asked her followers whether the public would wake up 'on the cattle truck? Or in the showers?'</p>

<p>She also claimed to have first-hand accounts of patients being taken to hospital during the coronavirus pandemic who were deliberately allowed to die.</p>

<p>Shamed nurse Kate Shemirani, who is due to host a rally in Trafalgar Square next Saturday, has promoted bogus claims on social media that vaccines are poisonous. (She is seen above at an anti-lockdown rally in London last month)</p>

<p>Miss Shemirani, with Piers Corbyn at the anti-vaxx protest in Trafalgar Square two week ago. She also claimed to have first-hand accounts of patients being taken to hospital during the coronavirus pandemic who were deliberately allowed to die</p>

<p>She wrote: 'Murder. Genocide. The NHS is the new Auschwitz.' Miss Shemirani, 54, has been suspended for 18 months to avoid the risk of harm to the public, The Times reported.</p>

<p>The Nursing and Midwifery Council is investigating her statements linking coronavirus vaccines to 5G mobile phone technology.</p>

<p>She was represented at an interim hearing in July by Mark Steele, a campaigner against 5G phone masts.</p>

<p>At the hearing, both Miss Shemirani and Mr Steele attacked the panel for not wanting to hear their 'facts' about vaccines and 5G.</p>

<p>Thousands of people, including many conspiracy theorists, met at the Unite For Freedom rally and march from Trafalgar Square to Downing Street to protest against coronavirus measures last month</p>

<p>Mr Steele accused the nursing regulator of being complicit in genocide, it is claimed. </p>

<p>Miss Shemirani said nurses who made accusations against her did so because they were overweight and jealous. She added: 'We all know what women can be like.'</p>

<p>She has reportedly resigned as a registered nurse.</p>

<p>Her Twitter following has trebled in the last three weeks to 21,000 followers. Her Facebook site, which had 14,000 followers, has been removed.</p>

<p>A Facebook spokesman said it had banned her 'for repeatedly violating our policies against harmful misinformation'.</p>

<p>Her Trafalgar Square rally is said to be a 'medic-focused event' with guests including academics who have questioned whether coronavirus is real.</p>
