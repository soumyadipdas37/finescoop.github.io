<p>So sweet: Jessica Simpson shared a heartwarming Instagram snap Tuesday of her elder two children Maxwell, eight, and Ace, seven, all ready for the first day of school</p>

<p>'First day of 2nd and 3rd grade for these two kiddos. Ace has a busted lip and Maxi has a busted chin. Finished the summer out strong,' Jessica wrote with the photo.</p>

<p>Although Ace was wearing a backpack it appears it was just for show as the family live in Los Angeles where virtual schooling is the order of the day.</p>

<p>Los Angeles public schools have all switched to online learning, but California allows public and private elementary schools to apply for reopening waivers.</p>

<p>However early this month the Los Angeles Times reported that, owing to its coronavirus rates, Los Angeles County is not considering waiver applications.</p>

<p>Baby mine: Jessica shares Maxwell, Ace and her one-year-old daughter Birdie (pictured) with her dashing second husband Eric Johnson</p>

<p>Jessica's younger sister and fellow pop act Ashlee Simpson is currently expecting her own third child, her second by her current husband Evan Ross.</p>

<p>Like his wife Evan comes from a showbiz family - his mother is legendary singer Diana Ross and his sister is actress Tracee Ellis Ross.</p>

<p>Ashlee shares her son Bronx, 11, with her first husband Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy fame whom she was married to from 2008 until 2011. </p>

<p>Glowing: Jessica is pictured in a recent Instagram upload taken from her coronavirus self-isolation with her family</p>

<p>Three years after their divorce she married Evan and in 2015 they welcomed their daughter Jagger, who is now five years old.</p>

<p>Before Jessica married Eric, a former NFL tight end, she spent 2002 until 2006 married to her fellow singer Nick Lachey.</p>

<p>Nick has gone on to marry Vanessa Minnillo, whom he was infamously pap-snapped getting intimate with in a hot tub in Mexico while they were dating. </p>
