<p>Designed by Ecoliv Building, a firm headquartered in Gippsland, Victoria which specialises in environmentally-conscious prefabricated housing, 3 Hope Way in Cowes, the main town on the northern side of the island, is a lesson that sustainability can be achieved without compromising on style. </p>

<p>The single-storey home, which was custom made with 'minimal waste' materials, has an impressively low energy rating thanks to renewable power sources that include solar panels, an electric carport and a 250-litre water tank.</p>

<p>Architects have built an eco-friendly seaside retreat on the coast of popular holiday destination, Phillip Island</p>

<p>It was designed by Ecoliv Building, a firm headquartered in Gippsland, Victoria which specialises in environmentally-conscious prefabricated housing </p>

<p>There's no question that the standout feature is the enormous living room window which captures unrestricted views of the surrounding countryside in its frame</p>

<p>Set on 684 square metres of land, the building consists of two 'modules' which intersect in a perpendicular 'T' shape.</p>

<p>The first houses a rumpus room, pantry and open plan kitchen-cum-living area while the second is filled with a bathroom, laundry and both bedrooms.</p>

<p>A mirrored splashback over the kitchen sink creates a reflection of the rural surrounds, flooding the house with natural light and bringing a sense of the outdoors inside.</p>

<p>The second module houses a bathroom (left), while a mirrored splashback in the kitchen (right) reflects sunlight inside</p>

<p>The interior design compliments the coastal surrounds, with beachy accessories like wicker baskets used throughout</p>

<p>On the side of the house, a large entertainment deck runs parallel to the kitchen while the car port backs onto the bathroom in a further nod to the sustainability of the design.</p>

<p>Ray White listing agent Bec Anderson, who is overseeing the sale of the home, described it as the 'perfect coastal getaway' - an ideal escape from the frenzy of city living where you can work from home against the scenic backdrop of the island.</p>

<p>'These modular homes are designed to compliment the seaside environment,' Ms Anderson told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>While the house was designed with 'low maintenance retirement living' in mind, it would also make a great office, weekend holiday home or Airbnb</p>

<p>While the house was designed with 'low maintenance retirement living' in mind, Ms Anderson believes it would also make a great office, weekend holiday home or Airbnb, with plenty of tourist attractions like an 18-hole golf course within short walking distance.</p>

<p>The house was listed for private sale on September 26 with an asking price of $645,000 (AUD).</p>
