<p>Kate, 53, revealed it also happened to be her and husband Derek Draper's 15-year wedding anniversary and that she's unable to see him due to his ongoing illness. </p>

<p>Sharing her feelings on air with Susanna Reid and Adil Ray, Kate said: 'It’s actually Derek and I’s wedding anniversary today, unbelievably – 15 years today.</p>

<p>Kept apart: Kate Garraway returned to Good Morning Britain on Thursday and admitted it was a 'tough' day to come back</p>

<p>'What an extraordinary thing. I won’t be able to see him today, I kind of hoped I would but it wouldn’t work out that way for a visit… But maybe it would be a bit strange anyway.</p>

<p>'So yeah, it’s a tough day but he’s still here. There’s not a huge amount of change.'</p>

<p>Kate said that she hadn't seen Adil or Susanna for a while, and went on: 'So much happens in those couple of weeks, there’s so many seeming positives, but actually when I see people again it’s just the same.</p>

<p>'But you have to think, at least he’s here with you – you have a flicker and then a bad day but you have just got to keep going really.'</p>

<p>Derek fell victim to COVID-19 in March and was rushed to ICU and put in a coma - where he has been since.</p>

<p>He is now in a limited consciousness and is unable to talk - but can hear things. </p>
