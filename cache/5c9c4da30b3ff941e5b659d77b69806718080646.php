<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The wild details of a Citibank's executive's 'bizarre' behaviour on a plane before he was dramatically arrested have been revealed in court documents. </p>

<p>Citibank Sydney managing director Thomas Hasan Dunmore Cribb, 39, became 'belligerent and aggressive' in the final hour of his Qantas flight from Auckland to Sydney on February 21. </p>

<p>The executive, who was dubbed part of 'generation next' at the US bank, faced Sydney's Downing Centre Court over his outburst on Tuesday. </p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to the obstruction of a Commonwealth officer and failing to comply with crew instructions. </p>

<p>The drama began when Cribb asked for 'another scotch', prompting the flight attendant to hesitate before giving him the drink, according to the AFR. </p>

<p>Cribb, a single father from Surry Hills, then began pestering a man in the seat in front of him, introducing himself twice to the stranger. </p>

<p>Later on, flight attendants called for electronic devices to be turned off or put on aeroplane mode -  but Cribb proceeded to have a loud conversation on the phone.</p>

<p>A flight attendant ordered Cribb to return to his seat five times but he said he 'just needed to p***' and went to toilet, according to The Daily Telegraph. </p>

<p>The plane's captain called Australian Federal Police officers to meet the flight at the gate and remove Cribb. </p>

<p>Cribb whined as he left the flight and launched a tirade of abuse at officers.    </p>

<p>'How dare you. I can't believe this is Australia, am I under arrest? </p>

<p>'You have no idea who I am. You don't realise how big a mistake you've just made. You're gone. I'm taking your badge. You've just f****d up,' Cribb told police. </p>

<p>Cribb repeatedly ignored cabin crew instructions and attempted to kick at police officers who were called to Sydney Airport (NSW Police officers pictured at Sydney Airport) </p>

<p>Cribb demanded to see a Qantas staff member and a scuffle broke out as police attempted to arrest the banker.  </p>

<p>The 39-year-old then tried to kick at two of the officers as he was tackled to the ground.   </p>

<p>Cribb told police he wouldn't say anything until he could call speak to his lawyer but later apologised to an officer for injuring his thumb.   </p>

<p>'Yeah, I f****d up. I'm really sorry. I had a few drinks,' he told officers at the AFP's Sydney police station.    </p>

<p>Cribb later apologised for lashing out at police and the court heard the Citibank executive would be receiving a salary cut (Citibank headquarters pictured in New York city) </p>

<p>Cribb's lawyer said the banker had faced the Citibank board and would have his salary reduced after the incident. </p>

<p>His lawyer also noted Cribb's behaviour was 'bizarre' and out of character, providing multiple 'glowing' character references that described him as 'a gentle soul'. </p>

<p>Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson said she had taken into account Cribb's remorse, his lack of prior offences and the character references. </p>

<p>She ordered Cribb to pay a $1,000 fine and continue seeing his psychologist while placing him on a two years good behaviour bond without conviction. </p>

<p>Cribb was fined $1,000 and ordered to continue to see his psychologist. He was placed on a two-year good behaviour bond (A Qantas plane takes off from Sydney Airport)</p>
