<p>Kathy Griffin has put her luxurious Bel-Air estate on the market for $15,995,000.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old comedian is selling the 8-bedroom, 12-bathroom contemporary Mediterranean-style estate that sits behind guarded gates to the A-list enclave.  </p>

<p>Just three years Griffin added her personal touch to the 13,377sqft home by building a 'wall' to shield her from her Trump supporter neighbor. </p>

<p>On her side of the wall, Griffin, who is one of Trump's most vocal adversaries, lives in the lap of luxury in the home she purchased in 2016 for $10.5million.</p>

<p>The view from her master bedroom puts the stunning California mountains on display through glass doors that open to the 1,100sqft private balcony. </p>

<p>In addition to the 'wall,' Griffin has made some recent upgrades to the home, including adding adding custom gates that open to a long private driveway that offers security leading to the impeccable home.</p>

<p>It's unclear why newlywed Griffin is deciding to sell the home after tying the knot in January, but perhaps it's time to downsize from her sprawling pad. </p>

<p>The comedian is selling the 8-bedroom, 12-bathroom contemporary Mediterranean estate that sits behind guarded gates of the A-list enclave. Many of the rooms come complete with a glass balcony for views of sunny Southern California </p>

<p>The expansive backyard has an impressive pavilion, lounge space and a massive 25,000-gallon infinity edge pool</p>

<p>According to the property listing by Josh and Matt Altman of Douglas Elliman, 'The moment you enter the grand front doors, the sheer scale and brightness of the home will take your breath away'</p>

<p>In the heart of the home is the chef’s kitchen with stainless steel appliances and two islands that flow seamlessly into the great room</p>

<p>Arches in the doorways and dark wooden framing on the windows complete the contemporary Mediterranean style of the luxurious $16million home </p>

<p>The view from Griffin's master bedroom puts the stunning California mountains on display through glass doors that open to the 1,100sqft private balcony</p>

<p>According to the listing, the mansion is an 'adaptable dwelling that gives serenity and versatility in today’s modern world'</p>

<p>Griffin has had an eventful year as she rang in 2020 by marrying her longtime partner Randy Bick in a New Year's Eve ceremony. </p>

<p>She surprised her social media followers with the news just hours earlier by announcing that she would be kicking off 2020 as a married woman. </p>

<p>Kathy tied the knot to her 41-year-old partner just after midnight in a ceremony officiated by actress Lily Tomlin.  </p>

<p>For the New Year's Eve nuptials, Kathy wore a recycled white dress with a black satin sash that was picked out by the groom.  </p>

<p>The movie theater in the home offers plush red leather love seats with oversize ottomans and comfy pillows for a perfect movie night with friends or a date night </p>

<p>The wine cellar is large enough to fit ample bottles for the comedian's personal stash or for entertaining and throwing huge parties </p>

<p>One wall of the wine cellar is full of windows and overlooks a lounging area with a TV mounted on the wall and a bar at one end of the space </p>

<p>Griffin's office offers natural light and light colored furniture for an airy feel. On the wall is a portrait of fellow comedian, the late, great Joan Rivers </p>

<p>The great room has custom wood beam ceilings and pocket doors that frame the views of the mountains</p>

<p>One of the eight bedrooms in the home is pictured in pristine condition with bright white walls, a desk and even a rocking chair for guests </p>

<p>Sadly in March, Griffin announced that her mother Maggie Griffin passed away at the age of 99. </p>

<p>She took to social media to share her sad news with her fans who grew to know Maggie through her appearance for six seasons on the Bravo TV show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List.</p>

<p>'I am gutted,' Kathy wrote on Instagram alongside a photo showing her and her mom sitting side by side on an outdoor sofa overlooking an infinity pool and a scenic canyon.</p>

<p>In June, Griffin commemorated her mother on what would have been her 100th birthday.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old shared a series of photos of her late mother, remembering her 'beautiful, hilarious and spontaneous' spirit.</p>
