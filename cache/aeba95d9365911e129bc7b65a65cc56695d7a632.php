<p>Huw Fullerton, sci-fi and fantasy editor of Radio Times said of the poll: 'Over a decade after he left the TARDIS behind and after nearly 50,000 votes were cast, it's clear David Tennant is still Doctor Who fans' perfect 10.</p>

<p>But with Jodie Whittaker hot on his heels and a great showing for other recent Doctors like Peter Capaldi, it looks like the fans also hold other Time Lords close to their hearts.' </p>

<p>Finishing on a nail-biting cliffhanger, Doctor Who's eagerly-awaited return will be for a festive special, it was announced in March.</p>

<p>With the fate of the Doctor hanging in the balance amid the Great CyberWar and return of The Master at the end of Series 12, fans will have to wait until December to see how the action unfolds.   </p>

<p>The identity of the Timeless Child was finally revealed, throwing everything fans know about the Doctor into question.</p>

<p>Jodie will be back as the near-immortal Time Lord in the upcoming festive episode curiously titled Revolution of the Daleks.</p>

<p>This can only mean that the Doctor's biggest and most feared enemies, the Daleks, will be front and centre in shaping the next series, set to be Jodie's last.</p>

<p>Showrunner Chris Chibnall said at the time: 'We can't leave the Doctor there! On that cliffhanger! Well, we did.</p>

<p>'But rest assured, the Doctor and her friends will be back for a one-off extended Special around Christmas and New Year. (I don't know when they're going to put it on yet, otherwise we'd tell you!).</p>

<p>'There will be Daleks. There will be exterminations. Thrills, laughter, tears. You know. The usual. See you at the end of the year.' </p>

<p>Producers also confirmed Tosin Cole, who plays Ryan, Bradley Walsh's Graham, and Yaz played by Mandip Gill will all be returning for the festive episode.</p>

<p>The original: William Hartnell (centre), who was the first actor to play the Time Lord in 1963, came in sixth place for 1,983 votes</p>

<p>Not bad: Peter Davison, who played the part from 1981 to 1984, came in last at 13th place, and he is also David's father-in-law as the actor is married to Peter's daughter Georgia</p>
