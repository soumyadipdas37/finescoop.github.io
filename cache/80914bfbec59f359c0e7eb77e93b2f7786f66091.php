<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dillian Whyte will fight Alexander Povetkin in an enthralling rematch in November as the British fighter has announced the bout will be confirmed this week.</p>

<p>There were doubts the rematch, in which Whyte was knocked out by Povetkin in the fifth round last month, would go ahead after the British heavyweight was handed a 28-day medical suspension.</p>

<p>The Brixton fighter's world title hopes had been left in tatters after suffering a brutal loss against Povetkin and is currently out of action until September 23.</p>

<p>The British fighter has announced on Twitter that the fight will be confirmed this week</p>

<p>The British Boxing Board of Control imposed the ban on Whyte - which also prohibits him from sparring - but he has been given the go ahead for the fight to take place in November in London.</p>

<p>Whyte posted on Twitter: 'Fight news drops tomorrow walking straight back into the fire I want all the smoke let's go baby.'  </p>

<p>The Body Snatcher's promoter Eddie Hearn gave us a clue what date the fight will take place as he told IFL TV: 'There's not many in boxing that honour contracts and honour obligations and their word.</p>

<p>'Andrey Ryabinksiy, Vadim Kornilov and World of Boxing, even if we didn't have a contract, and we had a shake of the hand or an agreement, they would still do it.</p>

<p>'These are proper, proper people. They don't want to wait till February/March so we will go November 14, or November 21.'</p>

<p>Whyte had been controlling the first fight and had Povetkin on the canvas twice before the Russian detonated a powerful uppercut in the fifth round.</p>

<p>The defeat saw Whyte relinquish his No 1 challenger spot with the WBC and put any of his world title ambitions on the backburner.</p>

<p>Had he prevailed against Povetkin, Whyte would have been in a position to challenge the winner of Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder's trilogy fight for the WBC title but now must win the rematch to re-enter the picture for a title shot. </p>

<p>Fury's promoter Frank Warren has however warned the 32-year-old Brit that rushing back to face Povetkin again is a 'crazy decision'.</p>

<p>'I'm a bit surprised they're talking about trying to get it on in November,' he told talkSPORT.</p>

<p>'Straight away when you get knocked out, the British Boxing Board of Control give a minimum 28/30 days before you can even get back into the gym and resume sparring.</p>

<p>Frank Warren warned Whyte that rushing back to fight Povetkin again in November is 'crazy'</p>

<p>'But when you get a bad knockout, and that was a bad knockout, sometimes they extend that to maybe 45 days.</p>

<p>'To be saying they're gonna put that fight back on again in November is crazy.</p>

<p>'Anybody around Dillian Whyte – and I'm sure Dillian would fight him tomorrow – but anyone around him needs to protect him and ensure that doesn't happen.' </p>
