<p>The supermodel said she 'weighed up' whether to stay in Melbourne and seek the comfort of her immediate family, or fly to Perth and play her part in sending her brother off </p>

<p>'I had to weigh that up. Part of me wanted to stay in Melbourne and be with my kids and my man at that time when I needed comfort more than any other time in my life.</p>

<p>'But I also wanted to be in Perth to support my mum, my brother and the rest of my family, and play a part in sending my brother off and putting him to rest,' she said. </p>

<p>Ms Gale also also revealed her concerns about drawing 'more media attention' to her brother's tragic death, by her attending. Despite her initial concerns, she knew she would regret not attending </p>

<p>'I also knew by going to Perth that I would be responsible for risking there being more media attention and more focus on it, which I didn't want to do.</p>

<p>'I felt bad enough as it was. I'd been the cause of that,' she continued. </p>

<p>Despite her initial concerns, she knew she would regret not attending the funeral.</p>

<p>'I couldn't bear the thought I knew I'd regret not going. I knew I'd regret not being there for my mum and my brother, so I went, "Okay, I'm just going to have to suck [it] up whatever that is for me, to be there".'  </p>
