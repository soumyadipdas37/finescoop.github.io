<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thousands of Australians who lose their jobs before Christmas could be forced to wait months for income support.</p>

<p>People will soon be expected to draw down on their savings before accessing JobSeeker payments.</p>

<p>The Morrison government is reintroducing liquid asset waiting periods, which have been suspended for the past six months throughout the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Funds readily available to jobless people and their partners will be scrutinised again from this Friday, including money still owed by their employers.</p>

<p>Singles with as little as $5500 in cash will need to wait at least a week before applying for JobSeeker, while those with $11,500 or more will be forced to wait 13 weeks.</p>

<p>The fund thresholds are doubled for people with partners or dependents.</p>

<p>The reinstated waiting periods will not apply to people already receiving the dole.</p>

<p>But with 400,000 more Australians expected to lose their jobs before Christmas, Labor is concerned about people pushed onto unemployment benefits for the first time.</p>

<p>Opposition frontbencher Linda Burney is worried about people who have dipped into their superannuation early and those who are no longer eligible for JobKeeper wage subsidies.</p>

<p>"The government wants to force struggling Australians to eat through their savings before they can access income support," she told AAP on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Now is not the time to resume the liquid assets waiting period."</p>

<p>Labor wants the government to extend the suspension of the waiting periods and withdraw a bill from parliament that would double the lengths of time.</p>
