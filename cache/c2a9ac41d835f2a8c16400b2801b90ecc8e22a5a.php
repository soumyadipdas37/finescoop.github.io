<p>Discussing how it's going the behind-the-scenes, Jade said: 'It's been really interesting, because we've had to learn to do that ourselves, in terms of getting along and seeing the bigger picture, it's making groups and seeing the energy. </p>

<p>Not happy? It took a while for the girls to raise a smile when they left the studios </p>

<p>Getting together: They looked down for a moment, before getting into position </p>

<p>'It's quite hard getting the groups to gel.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'We're not naive enough to think that's going to happen with another group we put together, we really need to get it right and look out for them and help them all.' </p>
