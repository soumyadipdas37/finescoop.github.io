<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>PSG star Neymar has called for an end to racist abuse after accusing Alvaro Gonzalez of aiming it towards him, telling the Spaniard 'You know what you said'.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old was sent off for Paris Saint-Germain against Marseille on Sunday after VAR found that he had thrown a punch at Gonzalez, before the Brazilian insisted that the defender was racially abusive towards him. </p>

<p>The Brazilian superstar admitted he 'acted like a fool' in his part of a mass brawl in the Ligue 1 clash which ended with five players being red carded but called out his opponent for the abuse he claims he suffered in an impassioned statement. </p>

<p>Neymar has called for an end to racist abuse after accusing Alvaro Gonzalez of the offence</p>

<p>The Brazlian also admitted he 'acted like a fool' after being sent off for punching the Spaniard</p>

<p>'Yesterday I revolted. I was punished with red because I wanted to hit someone who offended me. I thought I could not leave without doing something because I realised that those in charge would not do anything, did not notice or ignored the fact', Neymar said on his Instagram page.</p>

<p>'During the game I wanted to answer, as always, playing football. The facts show that I did not succeed, I revolted.</p>

<p>'In our sport, aggressions, insults, swearing are part of the game, of the dispute. You can't be affectionate. I understand this guy partly. All is a part of the game but racism and intolerance are unacceptable.</p>

<p>'I am black, son of black, grandson and great grandson of black also. I am proud and I do not see myself as different from anyone. Yesterday I wanted those in charge of the game (referees, assistants) to position themselves impartially and understand that there is no longer such a place for a prejudiced attitude.</p>

<p>Neymar protested after his dismissal, alleging that Gonzalez had racially abused him</p>

<p>The 28-year-old told the Spaniard 'You know what you said... I know what I did' in statement</p>

<p>'Reflecting and seeing all the manifestation that happened. I am saddened by the feeling of hatred that we can provoke when in the heat of the moment we snap.</p>

<p>'Should I have ignored it? I don't know yet... Today, with a cool head, I say yes, But in due course my companions and I asked the referees for help and we were ignored. That's the point!</p>

<p>'We who are involved in entertainment need to reflect. An action led to a reaction and got to where it did. I accept my punishment because I should have followed the path of clean football.</p>

<p>'Racism exists. It exists. But we have to stop it. No more, enough!</p>

<p>'The guy was a fool. I also acted like a fool for letting me get involved in that. I still have the privilege of keeping my head up today. But we all need to reflect that not all black and white people are in the same condition.</p>

<p>'The damage from the confrontation can be disastrous to both sides. Whether you are black or white. I don't want to and we shouldn't mix subjects. Skin colour we don't choose. Before God we are all equal.</p>

<p>Neymar spoke of how racism is a big problem and it must not be ignored</p>

<p>'Now... Yesterday I lost in the game and I lost wisdom... Being in the center of this situation or ignoring a racist act will not help, I know, But pacifying this 'anti-racism' movement is our obligation so that the less privileged will naturally receive their defence. </p>

<p>'We will meet again and it will be my way, playing football.... Stay in peace! Stay in peace! </p>

<p>'You know what you said... I know what I did. More love to the world. #noracism #saynotoracism'</p>

<p>The governing body of professional football in France, the LFP, will now review the incident before handing out its suspension for the Brazilian, with the organization's regulations stating that the Brazilian could be banned for as many as seven matches, according to French sports outlet RMC Sport. </p>

<p>They are also investigating the claims made about Gonzalez, and if he is found guilty of racism he could face up to a ten-game ban.  </p>

<p>Marseille ran out 1-0 winners in a heated derby that saw five players sent off while 12 others were given yellow cards after a mass brawl broke out during the game at the Parc des Princes.</p>

<p>Neymar alleged that Gonzalez called him a 'monkey motherf*****', which infuriated the £208m star and resulted in him throwing a punch at his rival. </p>

<p>Neymar and Alvaro Gonzalez could both face bans following the incident on Sunday evening</p>

<p>Television footage and a pitchside microphone appear to have caught Neymar pointing at the centre back in question and shouting: 'Racism, no?' </p>

<p>'VAR catching my "aggression” is easy... now I want to see the image of the racist calling me a monkey motherf*****,' he tweeted after the game.</p>

<p>Before uncovering what Gonzalez had allegedly called him on the field, Neymar also tweeted: 'My only regret is not hitting that a****** in the face.'  </p>
