<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Controversial financial betting firm Plus500 is poised to take on traditional stockbrokers by launching a conventional share trading service. </p>

<p>David Zruia, the new chief executive, told The Mail on Sunday that the FTSE250-listed firm is preparing to move into physical equity trading. </p>

<p>Plus500 currently specialises in selling contracts for difference – controversial deals which allow traders to place bets on the movements of shares, gold, oil and other markets without actually buying the underlying assets.</p>

<p>Controversial: FTSE250-listed Plus500 is preparing to move into physical equity trading</p>

<p>CFD traders can turbocharge their bets by using debt, or leverage, so that potential returns and losses are amplified when prices move. </p>

<p>But this makes the trading risky. The City watchdog has said CFDs should be for sophisticated investors only. </p>

<p>In a crackdown in 2018, the Financial Conduct Authority warned that CFD trading was being 'aggressively marketed' to the public 'meaning retail consumers are buying a product that isn't appropriate for them'. </p>

<p>A move into mainstream stockbroking for Israel-based Plus500, which sponsors Atletico Madrid football team in Spain, would put the firm in direct competition with FTSE 100-listed Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell. </p>

<p>Zruia, 36, said: 'We are looking at share dealing. Many of our customers, as well as holding trading accounts, hold the underlying asset.' </p>

<p>Plus500 shares crashed last year after it was forced to correct its 2017 annual report, causing substantial embarrassment. </p>

<p>The company initially said it had not suffered losses from punters' trading positions, but in February 2019 it admitted to a 'drafting error' after the company's finances showed it took a $103million (£77million) trading hit in 2017. </p>

<p>The crackdown on CFD trading – initially introduced in 2018 by European regulators and made permanent by the FCA last year – also weighed on profits. </p>

<p>The new rules stopped firms using inducements to get customers to sign up and protected traders from losing more than the total funds in their account. </p>

<p>Plus500's share price fell as low as £4.95 in 2019. However, on Friday its stock was flirting with £15 a share – within a little more than £5 of its all-time high in August 2018 of £20.08. </p>

<p>The firm has been one of the main beneficiaries of amateur traders trying to take advantage of the oil price collapse and the stock market sell-off triggered by the pandemic. </p>

<p>Zruia said: 'Most of our customers traded equities and commodities – especially oil. This trend continues. Trading on oil was very popular and still is.' </p>

<p>Some of the London-listed stocks that punters have been betting on since the crisis began include Cineworld, British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group and easyJet. </p>

<p>Zruia said Plus500 is back weighing takeover deals as a means of expanding the business. </p>

<p>Last year, Plus500 held talks with Gain Capital, the US-listed owner of London-based spreadbetting firm City Index, about a merger. However, the talks eventually collapsed over price.</p>

<p>Plus500 is now looking for smaller firms with a licence, technology or platform that can be integrated with its own technology. </p>

<p>In June, Plus500 posted a jump in first-half revenues to $564.2million from $148million a year earlier.</p>
