<p>She continued: 'Report this account direct to Instagram. We are working to have this account removed immediately.'</p>

<p>The scammer was contacting Jaggad members, and telling them that they'd won a competition and needed to provide their PayPal details to claim their prize.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rebecca co-founded Jaggad in 2013 with retired AFL star Chris Judd and fellow ex-footy player Steven Greene and his wife, Michelle. </p>

<p>In June, the JAGGAD label was forced to deny claims it had copied the designs of a rival company.</p>

<p>Warning: On Tuesday, the WAG, 37, shared a post to Instagram stories, urging her followers to not pass on their personal details to the fake account</p>

<p>Response: It comes after JAGGAD, the sportswear label co-founded by Rebecca (pictured) and Chris Judd, was forced to deny claims it had copied the designs of a rival company</p>

<p>Byron Bay-based activewear brand Nagnata posted several side-by-side photos to Instagram, comparing its woven jumper designs to similar items from JAGGAD's new Ridge Knit collection.</p>

<p>'If this Australian brand is going to keep copying Nagnata and ignoring our emails, then we're going to start calling them out,' the caption read.</p>

<p>JAGGAD's Ridge Knit range features several ribbed jumpers with striped patterns and a thick block of colour around the chest.</p>

<p>However, none of these designs are completely identical to those made by Nagnata.</p>

<p>Denying Nagnata's accusations, a JAGGAD spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'JAGGAD takes assertions of intellectual property infringement very seriously.</p>

<p>'In this case, it is clear that JAGGAD has not infringed any other brand's intellectual property rights.'</p>

<p>JAGGAD also disputed Nagnata's claim that they had 'ignored' email correspondence concerning the similar designs.</p>

<p>The spokesperson said the Judds' company had responded to Nagnata's inquiries in writing twice in the past two months, on April 17 and May 18.</p>
