<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier has announced his retirement nearly three years after a severe spinal injury forced the two-time Pro Bowler to put his career on hold.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old said in a social media post that while he still loves the game, it is time to get on to the next chapter in his life.</p>

<p>'Football gave me everything I wanted and more,' Shazier said. 'It taught me about hard work, dedication. Took me to college and the NFL, it made me money and gave me a life most people could only dream about.'</p>

<p>The former Ohio State star will move into a role at the sports website, The Ringer, according to Andrew Marchand of the New York Post. </p>

<p>Shazier was a budding star when he hit Cincinnati wide receiver Josh Malone in a road game against the Bengals on December 4, 2017. The crown of Shazier's helmet struck Malone in the back at the end of a seemingly routine play. Shazier grabbed his lower back in pain immediately after the impact and his legs were motionless as medical personnel tended to him on the field.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier has announced his retirement nearly three years after a severe spinal injury forced the two-time Pro Bowler to put his career on hold</p>

<p>Shazier was taken off the field after suffering a back injury during the game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Paul Brown Stadium on December 4, 2017</p>

<p>Shazer spent time in the hospital and underwent spine stabilization surgery a few days after the injury that brought his career to a halt. He vowed that his career was not over, and his comeback became a point of inspiration that reached far outside the world of the NFL.</p>

<p>Ben Roethlisberger talks with teammate Ryan Shazier at Cincinnati's Paul Brown stadium in 2018. Shazier had suffered a devastating spinal injury on the same field a year earlier</p>

<p>He used the phrase #Shalieve during his recovery, which included him walking on stage at the 2018 NFL draft to announce the team's first-round selection. He continued to work out regularly at the club's practice facility and the social media posts chronicling his comeback often went viral.</p>

<p>Shazier remained close to his teammates and served as a de facto scout and assistant coach each of the last two seasons, serving as a mentor of sorts to 2019 first-round pick Devin Bush - considered Shazier's heir - and others.</p>

<p>The Steelers placed him on the physically unable to perform list for both the 2018 and 2019 seasons before moving him to the reserve/retired list in March. It was considered a paper move at the time as Shazier remained committed to pressing forward.</p>

<p>It's something he still plans on doing, just not in the same direction.</p>

<p>'It's been over 1,000 days since I got hurt on the field ' Shazier said. 'To lose the game in a way I never envisioned has not been easy. For you to play the game of football the way I did, you convince yourself you're Superman. That nothing can stop you - but then the moment I got hurt I stopped being Superman, and that was difficult to make sense of.</p>

<p>'But the way I look at it, God put us all here for a purpose. For 20 years, he let me play football, and now it's time for me to do what he wants me to do.'</p>
