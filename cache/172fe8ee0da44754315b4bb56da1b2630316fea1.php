<p>Filming of the £180million Jurassic World: Dominion, starring Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt has been hit by more delays.</p>

<p>I hear that Chris, 41, is so worried about a coronavirus outbreak in Malta, where some of the scenes of the sixth instalment in the franchise are being shot, that he is refusing to fly out there and is telling others on the film that it's not safe.</p>

<p>Filming began in February at Pinewood Studios but was halted as the pandemic took hold. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the boss of a theme park of cloned dinosaurs that is plunged into chaos when they escape. Chris Pratt plays a dinosaur expert charged with saving the day</p>

<p>Amanda says: 'Getting the letter was very funny, as a brown envelope arrived at the business. It was just before Christmas and our accountant gave it to me. </p>
