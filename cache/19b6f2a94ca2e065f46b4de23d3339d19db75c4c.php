<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bakery chain Greggs has said it is in talks with staff over cutting employee hours 'to minimise the risk of job losses' when the furlough scheme ends next month.</p>

<p>The Newcastle-based high street business said it has completed a review of its trading operations as it looks to ensure its 'employment costs reflect the estimated level of demand from November onwards'.</p>

<p>It told investors its 'immediate priority' is to complete the consultation and confirm the financial impact of the move when the consultation ends in November.</p>

<p>The update came as Greggs said that sales have picked up over the past month, as it continues its recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Greggs said sales have picked up over the past month but August was a 'challenging month'</p>

<p>The food-to-go specialist said it suffered a 'challenging month' in August, as the closure of seated areas meant it was unable to benefit from Eat Out to Help Out.</p>

<p>High temperatures also made August a 'difficult month' for trading, it said.</p>

<p>However, more people ate meals outside of their homes in September, which it believes helped to drive improvements.</p>

<p>Since reopening on July 2, its like-for-like sales averaged at 71.2 per cent of its levels from 2019 for the 12-week period to September 26.</p>

<p>In the past month, covering the four weeks to September 26, like-for-like sales were at 76.1 per cent of its levels from the same period last year, as trading improved.</p>

<p>Greggs said its digital business is 'developing quickly' after increased investment during the lockdown period, partnering with food delivery operator Just Eat.</p>

<p>In a statement, Greggs said: 'The outlook for trading remains uncertain, with rising Covid-19 infection rates leading to increasing risks of supply chain interruption and further restrictions on customer activities out of the home.</p>

<p>'In these challenging conditions our teams continue to work hard and have proven our ability to operate with social distancing and adapt to new digital channels.'</p>
