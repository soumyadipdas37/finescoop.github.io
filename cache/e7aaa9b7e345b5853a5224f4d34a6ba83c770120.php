<p>Fisher, 33, a Broadway actor who made his feature film debut as Victor Stone, a.k.a. Cyborg in 2017's Justice League, first spoke out about the allegation in a series of several tweets on July 1.</p>

<p>Momoa took to Instagram on Monday, blasting Warner Bros. for releasing news about a Frosty the Snowman movie Momoa was voicing, on that very same day, July 1, to distract from Fisher's allegations, while Momoa himself revealed that 'Serious stuff went down' on the reshoots. </p>

<p>Standing together: Justice League star Jason Momoa made it abundantly clear he's standing proudly by the side of Ray Fisher after he leveled serious allegations of mistreatment on the Justice League reshoots from director Joss Whedon</p>

<p>'THIS S**T HAS TO STOP AND NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT,' Momoa began. '<?php echo e('@'); ?>ray9fisher AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO EXPERIENCED WHAT HAPPEN UNDER THE WATCH OF <?php echo e('@'); ?>wbpictures NEEDS PROPER INVESTIGATION.'</p>

<p>'I just think it’s f***ed up that people released a fake Frosty announcement without my permission to try to distract from Ray Fisher speaking up about the s****y way we were treated on Justice League reshoots,' he added. </p>

<p>'Serious stuff went down. It needs to be investigated and people need to be held accountable. #IStandWithRayFisher. aloha j,' Momoa concluded.</p>

<p>Investigation: 'THIS S**T HAS TO STOP AND NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT,' Momoa began. '<?php echo e('@'); ?>ray9fisher AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO EXPERIENCED WHAT HAPPEN UNDER THE WATCH OF <?php echo e('@'); ?>wbpictures NEEDS PROPER INVESTIGATION'</p>

<p>The Frosty the Snowman news was reported by several press outlets, with the movie, coincidentally, produced by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg, who Fisher called out in his original tweets. </p>

<p>Fisher also reiterated that the news of Momoa voicing Frosty the Snowman was always fake, despite it being widely reported in the press, in a tweet on Monday.</p>

<p>'If you still think Jason playing Frosty was EVER a real thing—please wake up! Hopefully now people see the depths that some are willing to go to hide the truth,' Fisher began.</p>

<p>Not Frosty: The Frosty the Snowman news was reported by several press outlets, with the movie, coincidentally, produced by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg, who Fisher called out in his original tweets</p>

<p>Fake news: Fisher also reiterated that the news of Momoa voicing Frosty the Snowman was always fake, despite it being widely reported in the press, in a tweet on Monday</p>

<p>'To think they believed my brother would sellout the cast/crew of JL for a corncob pipe and a button nose...Man facepalming A>E,' Fisher concluded.</p>

<p>Fisher first addressed the behavior of Justice League reshoots director Joss Whedon in June 29 tweet, stating, 'I’d like to take a moment to forcefully retract every bit of this statement.'</p>

<p>The statement was a video from a Comic-Con 2017 panel where he said, 'I mean, Joss is a good guy and Zack picked a good person to clean up and finish up for him.'</p>

<p>No sellout: 'To think they believed my brother would sellout the cast/crew of JL for a corncob pipe and a button nose...Man facepalming A>E,' Fisher concluded</p>

<p>Then on July 1 Fisher tweeted, 'Joss Wheadon’s on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable. He was enabled, in many ways, by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg. Accountability>Entertainment.'</p>

<p>The tweet lead to Warner Bros. launching an official third-party investigation into what happened on the Justice League reshoot set, though reports surfaced earlier in September that Fisher was not cooperating with the investigation.</p>

<p>Fisher seemed to address his lack of cooperation as well, tweeting on Monday, 'To-date, the “independent” firm hired by <?php echo e('@'); ?>wbpictures has conveniently avoided contacting key witnesses who gave damning statements to WB HR.'</p>

<p>Abusive: Then on July 1 Fisher tweeted, 'Joss Wheadon’s on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable. He was enabled, in many ways, by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg. Accountability>Entertainment'</p>

<p>Investigation: Fisher seemed to address his lack of cooperation as well, tweeting on Monday, 'To-date, the “independent” firm hired by <?php echo e('@'); ?>wbpictures has conveniently avoided contacting key witnesses who gave damning statements to WB HR'</p>

<p>'They’ve also started interviews with (and have since ghosted) witnesses that have implicated former and current top level executives,' he added.</p>

<p>'Others (including an implicated individual that called me to apologize) have already been interviewed. We will not let ANY investigator cherry-pick interviewees that best suit <?php echo e('@'); ?>wbpictures’ false narrative and scapegoating efforts. All with stories WILL be heard! A>E,' Fisher concluded.</p>

<p>The theatrical cut of Justice League, starring Momoa as Aquaman and Fisher as Cyborg, alongside Ben Affleck as Batman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and Ezra Miller as The Flashs, underwhelmed at the box office and was bashed by most critics.</p>

<p>Fans have been lobbying for the 'Snyder Cut' of the film, which removes all of the footage Whedon shot, which will be released next year on WarnerMedia's HBO Max streaming service. </p>

<p>Stories: 'Others (including an implicated individual that called me to apologize) have already been interviewed. We will not let ANY investigator cherry-pick interviewees that best suit <?php echo e('@'); ?>wbpictures’ false narrative and scapegoating efforts. All with stories WILL be heard!
