<p>Victoria also shared photos of the beautiful bouquets of flowers sent by her husband David and their sons as well as eldest son Brooklyn's fiancée Nicola Peltz on Instagram.</p>

<p>Speaking to Grazia,Victoria explained that she spent a lot of time over lockdown wondering how she was going to present the collection. </p>

<p>She at first thought she would show the collection with a small presentation to just editors, before making a last minute decision to go digital and open up the LFW event to everyone. </p>

<p>'There is obviously more pressure on digital content — the video that we're going to be shooting today, the pictures that we take. … I think that the challenge this season has been less about the clothes and more about everything else. I always welcome change and challenge,' Victoria said. </p>

<p>Sweet: The designer shared snaps of husband David, sons Romeo, 18, and Cruz, 15, and daughter Harper, nine, donning their face masks ahead of the digital presentation</p>
