<p>'Absolutely,' Kylie approved.</p>

<p>The photo drew countless comments from fans, who remarked on just how different the women looked in the old photo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kylie's former BFF Jordyn Woods returned to headlines over the weekend after it emerged she had found love with NBA player Karl-Anthony Towns.</p>

<p>Jordyn made their relationship Instagram official on Sunday, posting several loved-up snaps of the new couple cuddling up on the beaches of Cabo San Lucas.</p>

<p>'I found you, then I found me,' Jordyn captioned the photo series.</p>

<p>As KUWTK fans may remember, Jordyn landed at the heart of a cheating scandal last year after it emerged she shared a kiss with Khloe Kardashian's then-boyfriend Tristan Thompson, resulting in the end of their relationship.</p>

<p>The controversy also ended her close friendship with the Kardashian family.  </p>

<p>However, Khloe and Tristan ultimately moved past the transgression, rekindling their romance in recent weeks.  </p>
