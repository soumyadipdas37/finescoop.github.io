<p>The 28-year-old striker decided to end his £78.6million partnership with Nike after 15 years and will now wear Puma's legendary 'Puma King football boots'.</p>

<p>The news has been announced on social media in a message that is entitled 'The KING is Back'. </p>

<p>Neymar has decided to end his £78.6million partnership with Nike after 15 years to join Puma</p>

<p>Nike have sponsored the Brazilian since he was 13 years old, long before he became a professional. During his rise to stardom at Santos, they even supplied sports equipment for the club.</p>

<p>Neymar's switch of allegiances could be bad news for the American company who had reportedly signed the striker until 2022.    </p>

<p>With the deal ending early, Nike will lose one of their biggest star and his global appeal. </p>
