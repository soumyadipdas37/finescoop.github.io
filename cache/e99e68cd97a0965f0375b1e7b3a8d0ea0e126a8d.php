<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The cricket world is reeling following the passing of legendary Australian cricketer Dean Jones on Thursday night in a Mumbai hotel aged just 59.</p>

<p>Dean Mervyn Jones was a maverick in every sense of the word - fiercely competitive, as stubborn as they come - yet also the ultimate team man.</p>

<p>Jones first represented Australia in 1984, quickly becoming a regular in the Test and one-day squads under the leadership of Allan Border.</p>

<p>A dashing batsman and brilliant fielder, Jones also gained countless admirers for his toughness.</p>

<p>On the tour of India in 1986, Jones' legendary status in the national sporting landscape was confirmed.</p>

<p>Sent into bat at first drop, it was viewed as a gamble by many.</p>

<p>Teammates were in awe of Dean Jones following his dogged knock of 210 versus India in 1986</p>

<p>Jones readied himself for the innings of his life, and as the mercury soared to 42 degrees and the humidity reached a furnace like 80 per cent, the Victorian dug his heels in.</p>

<p>As quickly as Jones found the boundary, cramps then set in, initially in both hands, followed by his legs and finally in his back. </p>

<p>Lesser men would have retired hurt, with his fatigue levels reaching dangerous levels.</p>

<p>Unaware that Jones was rapidly losing control of his body, Border gave him the option of retiring.</p>

<p>'Well go on, off you go then,'' Border infamously said at the time.</p>

<p>'We will get someone tough out here. We'll get a Queenslander.'</p>

<p>It was just the tonic required to fire up Jones, who refused to let his skipper and country down.</p>

<p>After spending an energy sapping  503 minutes in the middle, he was eventually dismissed for 210, earning an instant cult following among cricket tragics.</p>

<p> 'The fractured memory of that amazing experience still jumps back into my mind in bits and pieces,' Jones recalled in his autobiography Deano: My Call.</p>

<p>'Some of them blurred and some crystal clear.</p>

<p>'Sometimes I have to refer to descriptions written at the time to fill in huge gaps in my own consciousness.'</p>

<p>It wasn't the only time Jones showed he was cut from a different cloth. </p>

<p>During a World Series Cup match at the SCG in 1993 against the West Indies, Jones famously asked towering West Indian paceman Curtly Ambrose to take off his sweatbands off mid-match.</p>

<p>Curtly Ambrose (pictured left) was in disbelief after Jones asked him to remove his sweat bands in a one-day match in 1993</p>

<p>It was a brave, but deliberate ploy to distract Ambrose, who could scarcely believe what he had heard.  </p>

<p>'I was really upset with him and I told myself I'm going to make it damn hard for him. I'm really going to rough him up,' Ambrose said in 2016.</p>

<p>'I wasn't going to hurt him, but I was going to make him uncomfortable.'</p>

<p>Jones' career highlights are endless - standout moment include a shock World Cup win in 1987 followed by an Ashes triumph two years later over in England. </p>

<p>He finished up playing for Australia in 1994, and then forged a successful career in the media as a writer and commentator. </p>
