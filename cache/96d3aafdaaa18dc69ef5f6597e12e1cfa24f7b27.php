<p>'I know we were related in another lifetime': Rugby league WAG Zoe Marshall (left) has posted a sweet tribute to her best friend, fashion designer Steven Khalil (right), on his birthday</p>

<p>'You are my brother. I know we were related in another lifetime (because we have the same toes and blood condition) we have travelled the world, shared our secrets, belly laughed hard to our own private jokes, had lap dances in Vegas together.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'You are my person. I trust you. I love you. I thank you for your constant loyalty, support and joy. Now let's eat cake and celebrate the beautiful human you are.'</p>

<p>Zoe and Steven's extraordinarily close relationship has raised eyebrows in the past.</p>

<p>Gushing: 'You are my person. I trust you. I love you. I thank you for your constant loyalty, support and joy,' she wrote on Instagram</p>

<p>Back in January, she was forced to respond to 'really weird questions' she was getting on Instagram about the state of her marriage.</p>

<p>Zoe, who was on holiday in Singapore with Steven at the time, was accused of spending 'more time' with the openly gay fashion designer than with her husband.</p>

<p>Sharing screenshots of comments from her followers, she clarified that Benji 'loves Steven just as much as me'. </p>

<p>She also pointed out that her husband was the one who had suggested she take a holiday with Steven in the first place. </p>

<p>Hitting back: Back in January, Zoe was forced to respond to 'really weird questions' she was getting on Instagram about her friendship with Steven</p>

<p>'Getting some really weird questions about my friendship with Steven Khalil. Are we really living in a world where this is even a passing thought?' Zoe asked. </p>

<p>She shared examples of the direct messages she had received from Instagram users, several of whom claimed her vacation with Steven looked more like a 'honeymoon'.</p>

<p>'Wow, how does your husband feel about all this alone time with your work colleague?' one person wrote. 'Whether you love Benji or not, some of your shots and Instagram videos are a bit extreme.' </p>

<p>'Peculiar question': The socialite, who was on holiday in Singapore with Steven at the time, was accused of spending 'more time' with the openly gay fashion designer than with her husband </p>

<p>Accusations: Zoe shared examples of the direct messages she had received from Instagram users, several of whom claimed her vacation with Steven looked more like a 'honeymoon'</p>

<p>'Question... you seem to spend most of your time with Steven. How does Benji fit in?' asked another troll.</p>

<p>In response, Zoe said that Benji, 35, was 'okay' with her Instagram posts and had actually suggested she and Steven go on holiday together.</p>

<p>'He loves Steven as much as me,' she wrote. 'We aren't work colleagues, he's my best guy friend. We are very affectionate because we love each other immensely.</p>

<p>All okay: Zoe pointed out that her husband, Benji (left), was the one who had suggested she take a holiday with Steven in the first place. The couple are pictured with their son, Fox</p>

<p>'I'm not sure what you mean by extreme? I put out a pretty clear warning that I was coming in HOT with the extra, so if that's what you mean you are welcome!'</p>

<p>'I hope it inspires you to be extra too. Feel your joy! Follow your bliss! And be a little extreme! You only live once!' she concluded.  </p>

<p>Zoe has previously described Steven as her 'gay husband'. </p>

<p>Claim to fame: Since finding fame as a professional NRL WAG, Zoe has carved out a career as an influencer and media personality </p>

<p>Steven is close with Zoe and Benji, and is godfather to their young son, Fox.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Daily Telegraph in 2017, Steven said he was delighted to be asked to be the child's godfather.</p>

<p>'I said to Zoe, "Are you sure?" Benji has lots of friends. I almost feel guilty, but it's a beautiful honour,' he said at the time.</p>
