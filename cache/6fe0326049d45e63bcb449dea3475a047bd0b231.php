<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The dominatrix who was barred from a gastropub in Cumbria for a public sadomasochistic display has been revealed to be a dog-loving 30-year-old.</p>

<p>The dominatrix, who has been identified as Lydia Chadwick, tied her 'slave' to a roof beam with a dog lead and spanked the masked person with a paddle on Sunday evening at The Mill in Ulverston.</p>

<p>The spanking session took place in full view off diners, despite Lydia insisting that she did not think anyone could see, leading to the gastropub barring her and her masked 'slave'.  </p>

<p>The dominatrix who was barred from a gastropub in Cumbria for a public 'spanking session' on her 'slave' has been revealed to be dog-loving Lydia Chadwick (above)</p>

<p>Customers who witnessed the sadomasochistic session filmed the bizarre episode and shared it online.</p>

<p>But dog-loving Lydia defended her actions, telling The Sun: 'People should get out of the dark ages and accept this sort of behaviour.</p>

<p>'Most people are just treating it as a laugh.'</p>

<p>Lydia caused a stir online after taking her friend from Camden, who identifies as a woman, into the pub because she wanted to be publicly humiliated. </p>

<p>The duo had originally planned to go to a local beauty spot and give the walkers 'something to laugh at' but went for a drink in The Mill instead when they were 'running out of time'.</p>

<p>They went to a table in a quiet area and the woman was suspended from the ceiling in her underwear while Lydia spanked her with a paddle.   </p>

<p>The self-confessed 'mistress' told The Sun: 'I blindfolded her and pretended to walk away and leave her as part of the humiliation. I was videoing it and we didn't think anyone else could see. </p>

<p>'I then pulled up her skirt and paddled her. </p>

<p>Lydia, 30, was barred from The Mill in Ulverston, Cumbria, after customers shared a video of her suspending her masked 'slave' to the ceiling and hitting them with a paddle </p>

<p>'A couple of other people walked past to have a cigarette but didn't seem to pay any attention. </p>

<p>'The next thing we knew the lads who were filming us told the bar staff who told us it was time to go home. </p>

<p>'It is the first time I have been out for a drink for six months and I end up getting barred.' </p>

<p>In the video, the sound of the spanking could be heard above the soundtrack of Lovely Day by Bill Withers. </p>

<p>Lydia, who said being a dominatrix is 'just a job', said she did not mean to upset The Mill and will 'apologise to them', adding that her family were upset after the video was shared online. </p>

<p>Speaking about her job, she said: 'I do phone sex and mistressing. I do what people ask me to do for them - humiliation, cross dressing and calling them pathetic and shouting at them. </p>

<p>'I also do customer videos, like foot fetishes and spanking.' </p>

<p>Phil Simpson, owner of The Mill (above), hit out at the couple, who he believes has ties to the Ulverston area, for seeking to 'embarrass small local businesses'</p>

<p>But the owner of The Mill has slammed the couple for their exhibitionism after the X-rated incident and barred them from the pub. </p>

<p>A picture on social media also shows a message allegedly written by a member of staff after the incident.</p>

<p>It read: 'I sat them upstairs on the terrace, these lads came down that were sat up there ten minutes later telling us to go up and see what's happening - and she has tied them up with a dog lead on one of the beams, whipping them.' </p>

<p>Michelle Wood, general manager of The Mill, told The Sun that it was not 'behaviour that we wanted to encourage'.</p>

<p>She said: 'The couple signed in as all customers are asked to do for pandemic regulations and it was obvious that the man was dressed as a woman.</p>

<p>'But in 2020 if you turn men away because they are dressed as women then it is discrimination. </p>

<p>'One of the other customers started filming what was going on and then came to tell the staff. </p>

<p>'They just embarrassed us for her financial gain.'</p>

<p> Lydia, who said being a dominatrix is 'just a job', said she did not mean to upset The Mill and will 'apologise to them', adding that her family were upset after the video was shared</p>

<p>The couple are believed to be part of the BDSM community. BDSM refers to often erotic practices which can involve bondage, dominance or submission.</p>

<p>One witness wrote on Twitter: 'Unreal scenes coming from The Mill in Ulverston.' </p>

<p>Phil Simpson, owner of The Mill, believes the couple has ties to the Ulverston area and hit out at them for seeking to 'embarrass small local businesses'.</p>

<p>Mr Simpson added: 'As soon as we spotted this couple's activities they were told to leave our premises.</p>

<p>'They are now barred and having seen their post on social media the police have now contacted us for more information.</p>

<p>'We believe that the woman involved is Ulverston-based and we find it quite depressing that such people should seek to embarrass small local businesses in this manner for financial gain.'</p>
