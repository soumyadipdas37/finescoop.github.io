<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the unusual moment that a group of friends play a human version of table football, where players use their mouths to blow a ball into a goal.</p>

<p>Ivan Bodylevskii, 30, captured hilarious video footage of a group of men playing the bizarre game whilst working in Turkey.</p>

<p>Players have to put their heads through holes in a special board and begin blowing air from their mouths to move a small red ball around the pitch.</p>

<p>In the video, which was filmed before coronavirus measures came into force, the two teams are made clear to spectators as the holes are coloured either blue or purple.</p>

<p>The game has no rules apart from one main objective, to score a goal in the opposite team's goal.</p>

<p>At one point in the tournament, the purple team manage to get the ball past the goalkeeper and score a goal, triggering cries of excitement from the other players.</p>

<p>There are also a number of own goals as the goalkeepers attempt to stop the opposing team from scoring, the unusual footage shows.</p>

<p>In the video, a sporting match is also being played on a normal football pitch behind the football table. </p>

<p>But this game still has a fun twist, as all the players are wearing large zorb balls, or human hamster balls as they are also known.</p>

<p>Players have to put their heads through coloured holes in the specially-made board and blow air through their mouths to move the ball across the pitch</p>

<p>The hilarious, yet competitive, game has no rules apart from one main objective - to score a goal in the opposite team's net</p>

<p>Mr Bodylevskii said that the human-sized football table took around two hours to construct, adding that the lighthearted game was extremely 'productive'. </p>

<p>He said: 'For work, we were looking for different football type of game whilst in Turkey.</p>

<p>'The board took about two hours in total to assemble and is very productive, with the team with the best lungs winning.</p>

<p>'I filmed this before the coronavirus pandemic, I'm not sure if they play the game at the moment.'</p>

<p>The hysterical video footage was taken by Mr Bodylevskii in February this year. </p>
