<p>Just last month, Brad and Nicole were spotted arriving in the South of France on a private jet where they visited Château Miraval, where he produces $390 rosé Champagne. </p>

<p>The trip coincided with what would have been his and Angelina's sixth wedding anniversary, they married at the château on August 24, 2014. </p>

<p>The former couple had purchased the estate including the Château and vineyard in 2011 for $60 million after leasing it for three years. </p>

<p>The visit reportedly angered Angelina, with a source telling the Mirror: 'Angie is furious and utterly stunned Brad could stoop this low.'</p>

<p>While last week, it was claimed that relations between the former couple, who share six children, have deteriorated to the point where they are no longer engaging in family therapy ahead of a custody trial slated for next month.</p>

<p>'Tensions have escalated between Brad and Angelina, with family therapy no longer taking place,' a source told Us Weekly. </p>

<p>The former couple had appeared to reach a cordial understanding about co-parenting their kids, with the Once upon A Time... In Hollywood actor spotted leaving the actress' LA home in June after spending time with the children.</p>

<p>However, UsWeekly claims they are now at odds again over how much time they each get with Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and 12-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. </p>

<p>Getaway: Just last month, Brad and Nicole were spotted arriving in the South of France on a private jet where they visited Château Miraval, where he produces $390 rosé Champagne  </p>

<p>Eldest child Maddox, 19, is allowed to choose his own timetable and is reported to no longer have any contact with his father. </p>

<p>'Brad wants 50/50 joint physical and legal custody of the kids. Angelina has been unagreeable to those terms,' a source told UsWeekly.</p>

<p>The insider added that Angelina 'will only agree to talk about an agreement if the home base for the children isn't Los Angeles. The younger kids are in school in Los Angeles, which Angelina has always been opposed to.'</p>

<p>It's previously been suggested that Jolie wants to relocate to the UK and base the children with her there.</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted both Brad and Angelina for comment at the time.   </p>

<p>More drama: The trip coincided with what would have been his and Angelina's sixth wedding anniversary, they married at the château on August 24, 2014, with the actress reportedly left 'furious' (pictured in 2019) </p>

<p>The former couple, who enjoyed the moniker Brangelina during their time together, separated in September 2016. </p>

<p>The two had met on the set of the film Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith that was released in June 2005.</p>

<p>Several months before the movie's debut, Pitt and then wife Jennifer Aniston had announced they were separating after five years of marriage, with the Friends star subsequently filing for divorce in March 2005.</p>

<p>On January 11, 2006, Angelina finally confirmed the romance with Pitt when she revealed she was pregnant with his child.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a trial has been scheduled for October in Los Angeles where a judge will adjudicate on the child custody and support issues that remain unresolved between Angelina and Brad. </p>

<p>Not ideal: While last week, it was claimed that relations between the former couple, who share six children, have deteriorated to the point where they are no longer engaging in family therapy ahead of a custody trial slated for next month (pictured in February) </p>

<p>The two had previously signed off on the appointment of retired Superior Court Judge John W. Ouderkirk to oversee the proceedings; he had presided over their marriage in 2014.</p>

<p>However, last month, Angelina requested he be removed from the case claiming she feared he would be 'biased' against her because he had failed to disclose an existing relationship between himself and Brad's lawyers.</p>

<p>Brad's legal team accused the actress of making a 'transparently tactical gambit' to delay matters, adding that it will be their own children who are 'hurt most' by the hold up.  </p>

<p>Ouderkirk denied Angelina's request that he recuse himself, stating that he is within his rights to continue working as the celebrity divorce continues to drag on and declaring that he can and will be impartial. </p>

<p>The fairytale romance between Angelina and Brad came to an end in September 2016.</p>

<p>There was an alleged 'altercation' that involved Brad and Maddox aboard a private jet that was heading from Nice, France to Los Angeles, California; after they landed, Angelina 'kicked him out,' according to Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>Brad was cleared of any wrongdoing but the stage had been set for a very acrimonious divorce.</p>

<p>Angelina filed legal documents straightaway and sought custody of their six children. Brad countered by asking for joint custody. </p>

<p>In August 2018, the divorce battle between the pair exploded in public with Angelina accusing her ex of being a deadbeat dad and Bra revealing he has paid millions of dollars to the actress including money to buy a new home in LA.</p>

<p>A judge overseeing the case previously cautioned Angelina for allegedly not helping the kids have a relationship with Brad and threatening to reduce her time with them. </p>

<p>The two reached an interim custody agreement and have engaged in family therapy since then as they seek to find a way forward.</p>

<p>Dispute: UsWeekly claims they are now at odds again over how much time they each get with Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and 12-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne (Angelina is seen with the children in France in January 2017)</p>
