<p>Researchers from John Hopkins Hospital and others ran an artificial intelligence model over scans of 86 people with no discernible symptoms of osteoarthritis.</p>

<p>The machine learning model was about to detect the beginning stages of the condition with 78 per cent accuracy up to three years before symptom onset.</p>

<p>In the UK about 8.5 million people have Osteoarthritis, a condition which causes joints to become painful and stiff - particularly in people over the age of 65.</p>

<p>If the condition can be detected early a combination of weight loss and exercise could make Osteoarthritis less severe when it happens - or even delay onset. </p>

<p>A number of diseases - including Osteoarthritis - lack any visual cues in the early stages which elude image-based detection such as x-ray or MRI.</p>

<p>When it comes to Osteoarthritis, by the time it is diagnosed it is already at an irreversible stage - well after bone damage has already been caused.  </p>

<p>Current treatment focuses on palliative care or invasive and costly surgery and combined with other musculoskeletal conditions cost the NHS £10.2 billion per year. </p>

<p>As osteoarthritis primarily affects older people and the population is getting older, it is thought that figure could rise to over £118 billion in the next decade, the NHS said. </p>

<p>Even after symptoms have started and irreversible bone damage has set in, it is still difficult to use medical imaging to correlate pain symptoms to disease progression.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that the condition could be reversible in future - with the right therapies and treatments, the researchers claim.</p>

<p>Early biochemical changes that occur in cartilage often seem to precede pain and bone damage symptoms by several years. This model looks for those changes.</p>

<p>'In the future, our approach may enable more accurate image-based assessments of early disease development,' the team said, adding it could also improve the ability to track the condition as it develops.</p>

<p>The new technique developed by the US researchers will allow doctors to spot signs of the condition developing before it becomes irreversible. </p>

<p>They use artificial intelligence to hunt for patterns in MRI scan images and could even allow for the automated discovery of future damage in cartilage maps.</p>

<p>'Future symptomatic osteoarthritis could potentially be predicted up to three years prior to the current gold standard diagnosis,' the study authors wrote.</p>

<p>They assessed the cartilage in healthy people using their technique and designed a diagnostic system that appears to be able to predict early-stage osteoarthritis. </p>

<p>There are limitations to the current research - it was based on a limited pool of 86 subjects and a machine learning model benefits from as large of a pool as possible.</p>

<p>'With increasing sample size, machine-learning techniques become more robust to variations that may exist within a population,' the team explained. </p>

<p>As there is currently no reliable method to detect pre-symptomatic osteoarthritis at the potentially reversible early stages, this could be a vital step forward.</p>

<p>Spotting it before it starts to damage the joints, the team say future therapies could be developed that may even prevent the disease from taking hold. </p>

<p>More research is needed before this technique could be used in a clinical setting, including a larger study to test the AI model - a larger sample size will see if it spots unusual variations.</p>

<p>Researchers also want to do tests that compare actual cartilage chemical conditions to the model predictions to ensure they are accurate. </p>

<p>The method they've developed may even be able to be adapted to detect early stages of other conditions such as cancers, retinopathy and dementia. </p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </p>

<p>Osteoarthritis - sometimes called 'wear and tear' - is a condition that occurs when the surfaces within joints become damaged.</p>

<p>Osteoarthritis - sometimes called 'wear and tear' - is a condition that occurs when the surfaces within joints become damaged</p>

<p>Cartilage covering the ends of bones gradually thin over time, and the bone thickens, according to Versus Arthritis. </p>

<p>Around a third of people aged 45 years and over in the UK suffer from the condition. This equates to roughly 8.75 million people. </p>

<p>At least 20 million are known to suffer in the US.</p>

<p>The severity of symtoms can vary greatly from person to person and between different affected joints, according to the NHS. </p>

<p>Almost any joint can be affected by osteoarthritis but more often causes problems int he knees, hips and small joints of the hands.  </p>

<p>The exact cause of the condition is not known but a number of things can increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis.</p>

<p>These include: </p>

<p>Joint injury - overusing a joint if it hasn't had time to heal</p>

<p>Other conditions - rheumatoid arthritis and gout can increase risk</p>

<p>Age - the risk of developing the condition increases with age</p>

<p>Family history - it may run in families but not single gene has been found</p>

<p>Obesity - being obese puts a strain on joints such as knees and hips</p>

<p>Being a woman - the condition is more common in women than men  </p>

<p>It is different to rheumatoid arthritis, a long-term illness in which the immune system causes the body to attack itself, causing painful, swollen and stiff joints. </p>

<p>Replacement joints are often necessary for osteoarthritis patients, because the joint has been worn down and causes agonising pain.</p>
