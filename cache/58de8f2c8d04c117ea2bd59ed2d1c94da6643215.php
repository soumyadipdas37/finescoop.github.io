<p>'I want him to know his dad was a hard worker,' she added. 'And I'd love for him to know about all the people that he touched, the lives that he touched, and what a good guy he was.' </p>

<p>And she told the outlet how much her little boy is helping her to face a future without Cordero. </p>

<p>'Even when I want to be sad, he's just so cute that you end up smiling and laughing. He looks like Nick, and he has a lot of Nick's personality. I can already tell,' she said.</p>
