<p>Mr Gullis (pictured), 30, who used to be a secondary school teacher in Birmingham, appeared on the Zoom group along with his newborn Amelia</p>

<p>At the start of the clip, Mr Gullis can be seen expertly cradling his baby while responding to his colleagues.</p>

<p>And even when his newborn starts to interrupt the meeting, Mr Gullis continues to try and professionally question and listen to the information he's receiving.</p>

<p>Eventually, the MP leaves the room and returns with a baby carrier and it appears to be just the trick to get his newborn to settle down again. </p>

<p>Social media users were quick to praise the parent for their work, with one person writing: 'Lovely to see a male MP on the education select committee dial in with his wee baby attached to him. I recognise that constant swaying!' </p>

<p>At first, the little one (pictured with her doting father) appeared to be settled in the parent's arms, but soon started to cry</p>

<p>The father was forced to leave the room and come back wearing a baby carrier with his little one safely secured inside (pictured)</p>

<p>Another said: 'Is this the youngest ever member of the Education Select Committee? Tory MP Jonathan Gullis cradles baby in papoose during remote grilling of <?php echo e('@'); ?>Ofqual. Loving the multitasking vibe.'</p>

<p>On August 18, Mr Gullis shared a snap of himself and his newborn daughter to his personal Instagram account to announce her birth. </p>

<p>'On Sunday Nkita gave birth to our beautiful baby girl, Amelia. She weighed in at 7lbs 13ozs and both Nkita and Amelia are in good health,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'I am the proudest man alive and can’t wait to just spend some time with my family.'</p>

<p>The meeting today discussed the government's forced U-turn and allow A-level and GCSE results in England to be based on teachers' assessments after a furious row over grades. </p>

<p>Regulator Ofqual confirmed last month that England would follow steps already taken by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after a controversial computer algorithm marked down thousands of teenagers.</p>

<p>It announced that students would be able to take the higher of either the adjusted grade or the estimate made by their teachers. </p>

<p>A-level and GCSE exams were cancelled this year because of disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
