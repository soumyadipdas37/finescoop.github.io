<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Heritage England, a government agency opposed to Everton's plans to build a new 52,888-capacity stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock, has been slammed for objecting to the club's proposals.</p>

<p>The Premier League club submitted an amendment to the planning application for their stunning new stadium last week with hope that its construction can begin early next year.</p>

<p>But Heritage England, the Victorian Society and ICOMOS are fiercely against the site being used for the stadium because they want to preserve the Grade II listed Bramley-Moore Dock and prevent it from being filled in.    </p>

<p>Heritage England has been slammed for objecting against Everton's new stadium plans </p>

<p>The club want to construct a 52,888-capacity stadium at Bramley-Moore dock in Liverpool</p>

<p>Heritage England are against it, wishing to preserve the Grade II listed Bramley-Moore Dock</p>

<p>But their position has angered the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a body trying to help cities in the north of England, because they claim the stadium will bring much needed jobs and investment to Merseyside.</p>

<p>Henri Murison, director of the NPP, told The Guardian: 'Unnecessarily delaying a £1billion mega-project such as this – which will support constructions sectors and related trades in the coming years and will create 15,000 jobs – would be a huge mistake at a time when we're facing rising unemployment, with this a material economic intervention in the city region.</p>

<p>'Historic England reading of the requirements of the World Heritage Status – which has already served its purpose in establishing its visitor brand – shows the time may have come when its disadvantages for the city outweigh any residual benefits it brings.</p>

<p>'In reality, the power of such a scheme can prove transformative in unlocking the true economic potential of Liverpool and the north in the short and long term.</p>

<p>'Projects like this represent a critical example of the role forward-thinking organisations like Everton and their wider partners can play in investing in local communities and building back better, one step at a time closing the north-south divide.'</p>

<p>The club say the new site will help regenerate the semi-derelict area of the city's docks </p>

<p>Construction on the new stadium is planned to begin in early next year, despite the pandemic</p>

<p>Historic England believes there are other locations and alternative plans for the dock that could work.</p>

<p>'We have had extensive and productive discussions with the club about how best to develop the new stadium at Bramley-Moore dock and understand the attraction of this exceptional location,' the body said in a statement.</p>

<p>'However, we consider that the proposal to infill the dock would fundamentally change its historic character as a water-filled basin which so clearly tells the story of the docks and has contributed to its status as a World Heritage Site.'</p>

<p>The club say the 'world-class' development aims to regenerate the semi-derelict area of the the city's northern docklands, contributing a £1bn boost to the regions economy, creating up to 15,000 jobs and attracting 1.5m visitors to the city each year. </p>

<p>They also want to restore several heritage features around Bramley Moore, including 'a hydraulic tower and tramlines' while dock walls would also be kept in place 'underneath the stadium'.</p>

<p>They have been at their current home Goodison Park since 1892 and want to move away</p>

<p>The Merseyside club announced new images for their planned new home last month including a new stepped plaza facing the river for supporters to enjoy as well as removing a multi-storey carpark and lowering the overall height of the ground.</p>

<p>The new stadium is set to be completed in between 2023 and 2024 and will take Everton from their home near Stanley Park to the heart of the Port of Liverpool. </p>

<p>The plaza replaces the idea of a multi-storey car park, with Everton looking to free up more space for supporters on a matchday. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, solar panels will now be moved onto the stadium roof, rather than outside the West Stand to create more space for fans.  </p>

<p>They have been at their current home Goodison Park since 1892 making the venue at Stanley Park is one of the oldest in English football, hosting more top flight games than any other ground.</p>
