<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A model has slammed a creepy bar worker for sending her inappropriate texts after taking her number from the Track and Trace app when she ordered drinks. </p>

<p>Dancer, fire performer and personal trainer Lucy Dixon, 32, accused the worker of breaking the law after he sent her a selfie and said: 'I was working the night you came in, you're gorgeous'.</p>

<p>Miss Dixon, who lives in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, posted grabs of their messages to Facebook.</p>

<p>Under Government measures pubs and bars have to ask customers to leave their contact details so they can be called and asked to self-isolate in the event of a coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<p>Dancer, fire performer and personal trainer Lucy Dixon, 32, accused the worker of breaking the law after he sent her a selfie and said: 'I was working the night you came in, you're gorgeous'</p>

<p>'And this is exactly what should never happen. A complete breach of GDPR. </p>

<p>'Currently getting to the bottom of how and why this has happened. Surely these are meant to be secure databases no?' </p>

<p>In the string of messages the bar worker, who said his name was Tom, wrote: 'Hey gorgeous, hope you're well? Xx Was fun seeing you at the*'. Miss Dixon hid the name of the bar where she had enjoyed a night out. </p>

<p>Miss Dixon replied 'who is this', to which he said: 'Tom.' She responded: 'I actually don't know who you are.'</p>

<p>Miss Dixon (pictured) told Tom her number wasn't on Instagram before she guessed he had taken it from the Track and Trace app </p>

<p>The guy then sent her a selfie and added: 'I was working the night you came in, you're gorgeous x'</p>

<p>Horrified Miss Dixon added: 'How did you get my number?' He replied: 'Off Insta. Hope that's ok?'</p>

<p>But she hit back and said: 'My number isn't on Insta.' A rumbled Tom then said: 'Sorry if not. If you want me to leave it's fine.'</p>

<p>But he persisted and added: 'Where abouts you from?'</p>

<p>After working it out, Miss Dixon added: 'Have you taken my number from when I ordered drinks through the app last night?'</p>

<p>It is unclear exactly where Miss Dixon was drinking. </p>

<p>Alongside the screengrabs Miss Dixon (pictured in January last year) wrote: 'Track and Trace, and bars having to take down your details in order for you to be there these days'</p>

<p>In the string of messages the bar worker, who said his name was Tom, wrote: 'Hey gorgeous, hope you're well? Xx Was fun seeing you at the*'. The name of the bar was hidden</p>

<p>Tom replied: 'Maybe. But if you want me to leave it is fine. And sorry if so. I'm guessing so.'</p>

<p>She responded: 'You know that's against the law?'</p>

<p>He sheepishly added: 'As I said I'm sorry so I'll leave it.'</p>

<p>Shocked social media users quickly took to the comments to vent their frustration that the system could be so easily abused. </p>

<p>Emma Louise said: 'I'd be straight telling the bar that you went to. What the hell. He's even sent a photo, how incriminating.'</p>

<p>Siobhan McManmon-Greenlees said: 'A database is only as secure as those administering it are. In this case, not at all.'</p>

<p>Dawn Holdbrook added: 'I hope you reported him for that, it's utterly disgusting.'</p>

<p>And Alana Marshall said: 'Wow this is horrendous!!!'</p>

<p>In July it was revealed little over 81 per cent of infected people were actually tracked down by tracers — marking the first time the system has caught more than 80 per cent of patients since it launched on May 28.</p>

<p>Shocked social media users quickly vented their frustration that the system could be so easily abused in the comments</p>

<p>One in four people who came into close contact with someone infected with coronavirus could not be reached by the NHS Test and Trace service.</p>

<p>Only 75.1 per cent (13,974) of contacts were reached and asked to self-isolate. This was down from the 78.4 per cent reached in the previous week, and the 90.8 per cent reached in the first week of Test and Trace.</p>

<p>Scientists have previously said eight in 10 Covid-19 sufferers need to be reached and their contacts isolated for the system to be effective. </p>
