<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mason Greenwood was reportedly reprimanded by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for his bad behaviour whilst on England duty and could lose his starting spot for Manchester United's first match of the season.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old was thrown out of Gareth Southgate's Three Lions squad along with Phil Foden this month for inviting Icelandic girls into his and the Manchester City star's hotel room while the England squad were in a Covid-19 bio-secure bubble.</p>

<p>Greenwood had made his England debut during the September international break following some excellent performances for the United first-team.</p>

<p>But according to The Sun, the winger faces the prospect of missing out on a starting spot for the Red Devils' opening league match against Crystal Palace on Saturday following a stern conversation with Solskjaer.</p>

<p>The report claims that Greenwood apologised to the United head coach and his performances in training could determine whether he starts the Palace match at Old Trafford.  </p>

<p>The winger had already posted an apology on United's website in the week after his actions were discovered.</p>

<p>Gareth Southgate sent Greenwood and Foden home for inviting Icelandic  girls into their hotel</p>

<p>The statement read: 'Having now had the chance to reflect on what's happened, I can only apologise to everyone for the embarrassment I have caused.</p>

<p>'It was irresponsible of me to break the COVID-19 protocols which are in place to protect players, staff and the public. In particular, I want to apologise to Gareth Southgate, for letting him down, when he had shown great trust in me.</p>

<p>'Playing for England was one of the proudest moments in my life and I only have myself to blame for this huge mistake. I promise my family, the fans, Manchester United and England that this is a lesson I will learn from.' </p>

<p>Greenwood has apologised to Solskjaer but could lose his spot in the Manchester United team</p>

<p>Greenwood had a sensational breakthrough season at Manchester United last season, scoring 17 goals in his first campaign as a regular first-team star. </p>

<p>He formed a formidable partnership with fellow forwards Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford following the coronavirus hiatus which fired the Red Devils to a top-four finish. </p>

<p>Greenwood played in United's final pre-season match before the Crystal Palace encounter - a 1-0 defeat away to Aston Villa last weekend.  </p>
