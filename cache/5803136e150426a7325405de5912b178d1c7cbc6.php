<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tesco is testing out drone deliveries to bring shopping to your home minutes after ordering. </p>

<p>The plan is to deliver 'top up' shopping of a few items. Trials will begin next month, at a single store in Ireland. </p>

<p>The pilot scheme by Britain's biggest supermarket chain is being conducted with drone delivery start-up Manna. </p>

<p>Tesco is trailing the pilot scheme next month at a single store in Ireland as part of a plan to deliver 'top up' shopping of a few items (stock image)</p>

<p>The air-drop will allow items to be despatched between 30 minutes and an hour after ordering. </p>

<p>Chief executive Dave Lewis admitted the business has been too slow to embrace new technology and the online grocery revolution. </p>

<p>He said: 'Manna have already proven the capability, the question is how do we take that capability and apply it to Tesco.' </p>

<p>The race to get ahead in the online food market has been set alight by coronavirus which has doubled the size of the market. </p>

<p>Tesco has taken on 16,000 staff and grown its delivery capacity to 1.2million orders per week. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, Asda’s owner Walmart said it would run a pilot project for delivery of grocery and household products with drones.</p>

<p>They are locked in a battle with Amazon, which last month gained approval in the US to operate a fleet of delivery drones.</p>

<p>But there are concerns that regulations are too far behind for mass air travel, and questions over whether customers want their shopping flown into their back garden.</p>

<p>Alibaba, a leading retailer in China, which leads the world in online shopping and drones, has been deploying drones for five years.</p>

<p>The move from Tesco points to a similar scramble for technology.</p>

<p>Tesco said it has been working with tech entrepreneurs in London, San Francisco and Israel.</p>

<p>Tesco set up a new innovation team a year ago, focusing on food and drink, the Tesco Clubcard loyalty programme, robot, and greener packaging.</p>

<p>Last year bosses said they were designing their own automated warehouse technology to take on Ocado, which has just launched a new deal to deliver food from Marks &amp; Spencer.</p>
