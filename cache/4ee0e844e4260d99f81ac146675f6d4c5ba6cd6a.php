<p>The blonde beauty enthused: 'I've never been in a relationship with someone who has loved me back. It's the first time I've ever felt that.' </p>

<p>Hinting at an engagement just weeks before the sweet moment took place, Holly added: 'I'm hoping for a ring, anytime now would be great. I'm just waiting for it.'</p>

<p>The TV star faced crippling anxiety two years ago when her toxic relationship with former co-star Kyle Christie came to an end. </p>

<p>At the height of her mental health battle, she suffered from panic attacks, lost her confidence and self esteem - with the thought of even going to the supermarket being too much to handle. </p>

<p>Battling it out: The duo later relished in a spot of karaoke as they belted the lyrics to Jennifer Hudson's 2008 track Spotlight</p>

<p>'So when I got with Jacob I realised when you're with the right person, it's so easy you don't have to fight at all. It's the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>'I don't regret the relationship with Kyle because it taught me so much, I learned everything I know from that relationship. It only made me a stronger person.' </p>

<p>Before her three-year romance with Kyle, 27, broke down in March 2017, Holly briefly dated fellow reality star James Tindale and X Factor star Frankie Cocozza in 2011.</p>

<p>Her happy place: The blonde announced her engagement to Macclesfield Town forward Jacob Blyth in June last year</p>
