<p>Hugh established Laughing Man in 2011 to provide a marketplace for farmers in developing countries to sell their goods to customers in America.</p>

<p>In an interview with the Daily Beast earlier this year, Hugh revealed exactly how his long-running rivalry with Ryan began.</p>

<p>Hugh said: 'I met him back on Wolverine, and I used to ream him because I was very close friends with Scarlett.</p>

<p>Pals really! In an interview with the Daily Beast earlier this year, Hugh revealed exactly how his long-running rivalry with Ryan (right) began </p>

<p>Over a girl: While the actor struggled to remember the specifics, he said it did start over Ryan's ex-wife, Scarlett Johansson (pictured) who he was married to from 2008 until 2011  </p>

<p>'Scarlett had just married Ryan, so when he came on set I was like, "Hey, you better be on your best behaviour here, pal, because I'm watching," and we started ribbing each other that way.'  </p>

<p>Hugh said things 'escalated' after Ryan took on the role of Deadpool, proving to be a rival to his portrayal of Wolverine. </p>

<p>And he claimed Ryan had used social media to 'manipulate' him in recent years, with the two men regularly poking fun at each other on Instagram.</p>

<p>But Hugh joked he never spends more than 'five hours a day' thinking of ways to enact revenge on Ryan.  </p>
