<p>Traore, who was born near Barcelona to Malian parents, has yet to make a senior appearance for either country and has been named in Mali's squad for next month's friendlies against Ghana and Iran in Turkey next week.</p>

<p>Yet it is understood that Traore has already decided to commit himself to Spain, who he has represented at Under-21 level.</p>

<p>Adama Traore is set to reject a call-up by Mali as the Wolves winger wants to represent Spain</p>

<p>The 24-year-old was named in the squad for Nations League matches against Germany and Ukraine last month, but had to withdraw after testing positive for Covid-19 - although a second test determined that he original result was a 'false positive'.</p>

<p>Traore also had to pull out when he was given his first senior call-up last November, this time because of injury.</p>

<p>Asked about Traore last March, Spain coach Luis Enrique said: 'We have known him very well for many years,' he told Marca.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old was named in the squad for Nations League matches against Germany and Ukraine last month, but had to withdraw after producing a Covid-19 'false positive'</p>

<p>'When we were at Barcelona, he was in our plans. He has evolved a lot. He's a very interesting player. We are delighted with his performances.'</p>

<p>Mali have put considerable effort into persuading Traore to turn out for them but it is far likelier that he will answer Luis Enrique's call-up for the Nations League fixtures against Switzerland and Ukraine during the forthcoming international break. </p>
