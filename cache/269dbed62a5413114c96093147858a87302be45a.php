<p>The apple doesn't fall from the tree! Richard Wilkins' son Christian has scored an acting gig in new Stan TV series Eden and revealed his VERY different look for the role </p>

<p>Eden explores the 'dark and secret lives of a raft of characters in a place that looks very much like paradise' and is being filmed in Byron Bay. </p>

<p>The coastal town is home to many A-list celebrities, including the Hemsworths, as well as Carrie Bickmore, Elsa Pataky, Matt Damon and Zac Efron.</p>

<p>For his 'very Nordic character', the socialite, who has carved out a name for himself as a model and stylist, dyed his locks and eyebrows white, and loves his look.</p>

<p>'It is my first proper acting role so to really commit to an aesthetic for it has been so much fun,' he told Sydney Confidential. </p>

<p>'Acting has always been my numero uno so to be able to live my dream to do it feels so validating.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Christian has also stepped into an ambassador role for Wayside Chapel - a not-for-profit charity providing care, support and essential services for those experiencing homelessness and social isolation.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the organisation launched the Wayside Online Op Shop, which Christian helped with.</p>

<p>'It's an important message. I am a big believer in what we put out to the universe and just think that we need to own that and they do. It is about looking after each other,' he added to Sydney Confidential. </p>

<p>Every Cloud Productions confirmed in a statement in August that Eden was 'shooting in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales with major production investment from Screen Australia.'</p>

<p>'It's been wonderful working with Stan to build on our long-term experience of drawing stories from the region and to revisit our previous creative collaboration with Bryan Elsley,' Australian screenwriter Deb Cox said. </p>

<p>'Introducing Vanessa's fearless storytelling to that mix has created a series dramatically unlike any other previously seen on Australian television.'</p>

<p>Stan's chief content officer, Nick Forward, added: 'With the creative force of Fiona Eagger and Deb Cox working behind the scenes, in tandem with the U.K.'s formidable Bryan Elsley and our own rising star Vanessa Gazy, Eden promises to be an extraordinary original series.'</p>
