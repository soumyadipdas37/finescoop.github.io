<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Callum Hudson-Odoi will start Chelsea's Carabao Cup clash against Barnsley with Frank Lampard's challenge to 'flourish again' ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>Blues boss Lampard has confirmed that England wing Hudson-Odoi will make just his second start since February 1 in Wednesday night's League Cup clash at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old has shot to prominence with both Chelsea and England since making his Blues debut in 2017, but a torn Achilles in March 2019 dented his progress. </p>

<p>Callum Hudson-Odoi will start Chelsea 's Carabao Cup clash against Barnsley</p>

<p>Frank Lampard has challenged the English winger to 'flourish again' for Chelsea </p>

<p>Hudson-Odoi has long since shaken off that issue but continues to battle for regular football, with manager Lampard now accepting it 'remains to be seen' whether he could be loaned out before the October transfer window.</p>

<p>'We know in a Premier League squad and the number of games we're going to play, we need competition in those areas, back-ups in those areas and players competing to make that position their own,' said Lampard.</p>

<p>'That's where Callum is at and that's why I keep saying he needs to train, he needs to show in training every day and when he gets his opportunity in games, which he will have tomorrow because he will play against Barnsley.</p>

<p>'At the moment we have Christian Pulisic injured, Hakim Ziyech injured. We played Timo Werner out wide against Liverpool. </p>

<p>Lampard accepts that it 'remains to be seen' whether Hudson-Odoi could be loaned out</p>

<p>'But the absolute natural winger who is fit at the minute is Callum. He has to show in every minute, on and off the ball, what he can do for the team and that's the position Callum is in at the minute.</p>

<p>'He's had an early breakthrough in his career because of his talent, he's had an injury and now I want to see him flourish again.'</p>

<p>Chelsea paid for Barnsley's Covid-19 tests ahead Wednesday's clash in west London, with Blues bosses not anticipating any issues with the fixture.</p>

<p>Bayern Munich have failed in the past with a concerted effort to prise Hudson-Odoi away from Chelsea, and the Bavarians are rumoured to retain their interest in one of England's top young talents.</p>
