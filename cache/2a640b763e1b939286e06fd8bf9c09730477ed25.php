<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She was branded a 'fame w***e' by Made In Chelsea's Melissa on Monday night's episode of the show. </p>

<p>But Zara McDermott seemed to be trying to move on from the drama on Instagram on Monday when she shared an incredible bikini picture. </p>

<p>Posing by the water's edge from a recent holiday in Cyprus, she reclined while looking at the camera, with wet hair, while wearing a floral white two-piece.  </p>

<p>Nothing to see here: Zara McDermott posed in a bikini by the water's edge in Cyprus on Instagram on Monday as she moved on from being branded a 'fame w***e' on Made In Chelsea</p>

<p>She captioned the image with the words: 'Meet you at the waterfall.' </p>

<p>During the latest episode of Made In Chelsea, it seemed as though Melissa had a lot to say about her.  </p>

<p>Aghast at the rumours about Tiff and Sam’s alleged recent provocative chat, she had said: 'If Harry’s ex talked about their sex life to him I would literally vomit in my mouth.'</p>

<p>Oh no Zara: Liv played Zara a voice note that Melissa sent Tiff in which she calls Zara a ‘fame w***e’ on Monday's Made In Chelsea </p>

<p>There was also a rumour that Tiff phoned Sam at 3AM the other night in the style of a booty call, at which Melissa is equally appalled. </p>

<p>Later, Sam is encircled by bikini-clad Liv, Zara and Tiff, who try to hash out the details of this alleged encounter between Sam and Tiff.</p>

<p>Needless to say this ends in disaster when Liv chucks a drink at Sam and demands he ‘get the f**k out of this house’.</p>

<p>Verity and Tristan try to clear the air and it goes like this: ‘How do you feel?’ ‘I don’t know how I feel!’ ‘How DO you feel?’ ‘I don’t know!’ </p>

<p>Liv then plays Zara a voice note that Melissa sent Tiff in which she calls Zara a ‘fame w***e’. </p>

<p>Zara is absolutely appalled at the nastiness of all these girls. </p>

<p>It has since come out that she cheated on Sam while doing The X Factor, and she and Sam have since split. </p>

<p>Zara is said to be doing all she can to get back with Sam but he has since been spotted on a date with a mystery lady, so it's not looking too promising. </p>

<p>Made In Chelsea continues at 9PM on E4 next Monday.</p>

<p>Hmm: Zara is absolutely appalled at the nastiness of all these girls</p>

<p>All over now: Of course, it has since come out that she cheated on Sam while doing The X Factor and the two have now gone their separate ways </p>
