<p>Guessing what paint color is being mixed seems like a fairly easy and straight-forward game for anyone who went to kindergarten. Red and blue make purple, blue and yellow make green, and so on.</p>

<p>But it turns out the chemistry of mixing pigments for wall paint is much more precise and can have some truly shocking results — and Christian's reactions to watching it all unfold on screen has TikTok and Twitter users rolling with laughter.</p>

<p>In his first video of the series, Christian does a TikTok duet with user <?php echo e('@'); ?>smittenkittensmittens. In a duet, one TikTok user's original video plays on the right, and a reaction video plays simultaneously on the left.</p>

<p>Ta-da! In one video, he sees 'a little yellow, a little white, a handful of blue, and a lot of red' poured into the paint base and guesses correctly that it will be a light purple</p>

<p>Red, blue, white, and yellow pigments pour into the bucket as Christian expresses shock that all the primary colors are being mixed together.</p>

<p>Narrating, he guesses that that the final product will be a 'really dark brown,' as <?php echo e('@'); ?>smittenkittensmittens's video shows the bucket being sealed up and placed in a mixing machine.</p>

<p>When the mixing is done, <?php echo e('@'); ?>smittenkittensmittensopens the paint to reveal a pretty robin's egg blue color inside — prompting an hysterical laugh from Christian, who doesn't believe it.</p>

<p>Christian has gone on to upload 11 more such videos, which have caught the attention of millions of TikTok users and millions more on Twitter.</p>

<p>In one video, he sees 'a little yellow, a little white, a handful of blue, and a lot of red' poured into the paint base and guesses, after much agonizing, that it will turn out a light mauve — and is giddy when he is proven correct.</p>

<p>Mixing: Yet another shows 'a hint of orange, mostly mustard, and black' poured into the base, making Christian figure the result will be a 'poo brown'</p>

<p>What!? When the paint tin is opened, though, the final color is — shockingly — an off-white</p>

<p>'I just can't stop. I can't stop!' he says in yet another video. 'This is just such an addictive game!'</p>
