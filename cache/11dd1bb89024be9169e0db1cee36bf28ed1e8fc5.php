<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fivethousandtoone is 9-4 favourite with Coral to give trainer Andrew Balding his first win in the feature Dubai Duty Free Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury on Saturday.</p>

<p>Balding has yet to win the race named after the brilliant 1971 Derby and Arc winner trained by his father Ian.</p>

<p>Fivethousandtoone, who was an effortless winner at Newcastle on his last run, faces seven rivals including Bahrain Pride, who beat him on his Windsor debut.</p>

<p>Balding said: ‘He’s a horse we’ve always liked a lot at home, so it was great to see him be so impressive on the racecourse at Newcastle. It is a big step up for him but the ground will suit and he is bred to be a decent horse.</p>

<p>‘We have been placed a few times in the Mill Reef and for obvious reasons it would mean a lot to win the race for the whole family. We will be giving it our best shot.’</p>

<p>Fivethousandtoone, a son of Frankel who cost 475,000gn as a yearling, carries the colours of King Power and is named after the odds bookmakers quoted for Leicester City ahead of their sensational 2015-16 Premier League winning season.</p>
