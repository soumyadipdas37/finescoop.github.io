<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's wife Louise Linton paid tribute to 'regal' and 'stunning' First Lady Melania Trump on Tuesday after attending a luncheon for cabinet spouses at the White House. </p>

<p>The Scottish actress, 39, took to Instagram to post a photo of herself holding up a glass of bubbly while toasting Melania, 50, at the event, which was held in the State Dining Room. </p>

<p>'There is no one more elegant, beautiful, regal, and kind than our stunning First Lady, Melania. Her poise, grace, and strength touch and inspire me,' Louise wrote in the gushing caption. </p>

<p>All smiles: Louse Linton, 39, took to Instagram on Tuesday to share a photo of herself toasting First Lady Melania Trump, 50, at a White House luncheon for cabinet spouses </p>

<p>Fan club: In the photo's caption, Louise wrote a gushing tribute to Melania, calling her 'elegant, beautiful, regal, and kind'</p>

<p>'Thank you for hosting spouses of the cabinet today,' she added. 'It was an honor to toast you and to sit by your side.'</p>

<p>For her afternoon at the White House, Louis donned a pink tweed skirt suit by designer Alessandra Rich and wore her blonde hair pulled back in a loose chignon. </p>

<p>Melania also wore pink for the occasion, though she opted for a cap-sleeve sheath dress. Her highlighted brown hair was styled loosely around her shoulders, and she stuck with her signature makeup: dark, smokey eyeshadow and a pink lip.</p>

<p>In the image Louise shared, she is standing next to the first lady, who is seated and looking up at her with a smile on her face. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Catharine Cypher, the director of media affairs for the first lady, tweeted a group photo of the cabinet spouses at the luncheon on Tuesday.  </p>

<p>Say cheese: Catharine Cypher, the director of media affairs for the first lady, tweeted a group photo of the cabinet spouses at the luncheon on Tuesday</p>

<p>Hitting back: In the comments, Louise fiercely defended Melania from critics as a number of people referenced the Trump administration's 'zero-tolerance' immigration policy</p>

<p>Defense: Louise insisted that Melania was the one who put a stop to the 'horrid practice' of putting migrant children in cages at the border </p>

<p>'<?php echo e('@'); ?>FLOTUS was delighted to host a luncheon for Cabinet Spouses at the <?php echo e('@'); ?>WhiteHouse today. She &amp; <?php echo e('@'); ?>POTUS are grateful for their continued friendship,' she wrote.  </p>

<p>Not only did Louise sing Melania's praises on Instagram, but she also fiercely defended President Donald Trump's wife while shutting down her critics. </p>

<p>A number of commenters referenced the Trump administration's 'zero-tolerance' immigration enforcement policy that led to migrant children being separated from their parents and put in cages.  </p>

<p>'Kind? Excuses locking kids in cages. I don't call that kind,' one person wrote, prompting Louise to hit back. </p>

<p>'SHE didn't lock kids in cages. SHE returned from her visit to the border and demanded an end to the horrid practice. Get your facts straight,' she responded. </p>

<p>Confused: Louise was also asked how she could praise Melania as an animal activist, pointing out that the first lady's stepsons Donald Jr. (left) and Eric (right) are trophy hunters </p>

<p>Making her point: Louise admitted that she doesn't agree with Don Jr.'s passion for trophy hunting, but she noted that it has nothing to do with Melania</p>

<p>During the trip Louise was referring to, Melania infamously wore a jacket with the phrase 'I really don’t care, do u?' scrawled on the back when she boarded a plane to visit migrant children at the Texas-Mexico border in 2018.  </p>

<p>'Louise, you are the only kind and elegant person here. You are a true animal rights hero. If Melania was a good person, she would speak out against the poor children in cages. Or speak out against animal abuse. Sorry, not my kind,' someone else commented. </p>

<p>Louise once again defended Melania, writing: 'She did speak out about the children in cages and as a result the president reversed/ended the practice.'</p>

<p>'Aren’t you an animal rights activist? Have you seen this family’s proud legacy of trophy hunting giraffe and lions — elephants?' another asked. 'Have you paid attention to the land that is getting ripped away from our wild horses because of the corporate agendas they back? I wish you clarity in your efforts.'</p>

<p>Louise admitted that she doesn't agree with Donald Trump Jr.'s passion for trophy hunting, but she noted that it has nothing to do with Melania.  </p>

<p>Husband and wife: The Scottish actress is married to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin</p>

<p>Throwback: President Donald Trump and Melania (left) attended the couple's wedding in 2017 along with Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen (right) </p>

<p>'I appreciate your passion for our animals. Yes, I share that passion. I have advocated for our wild horses with DOI and have personally rescued horses from the Bureau of Land Management,' she commented. 'I also campaign against trophy hunting and financially contribute to numerous anti-poaching charities.'</p>

<p>'I have also spoken publicly against Don Junior's hunting habits. I have clarity and I spend half of my day every day fighting on behalf of animal welfare. That does not mean I can’t appreciate Melania as an individual.' </p>

<p>Last November, Louise attacked President Trump and his administration for allowing a U.S. hunter to import a lion trophy from Tanzania.  </p>

<p>She slammed her husband's boss in a scathing Instagram post after a Florida man was given permission to bring back a lion's skin, skull, claws, and teeth from an African hunting trip.</p>

<p>'Americans should not be permitted to kill exotic animals for fun!' Linton captioned a photo of a lion.</p>

<p>Linton included part of a statement released by the Center for Biological Diversity from September 2019 that referenced the government's authorization for the hunter to bring back the lion trophy. </p>

<p>In her post, she urged her followers to pressure Congress to pass the Conserving Ecosystems by Ceasing the Importation of Large Animal Trophies (CECIL) Act. </p>
