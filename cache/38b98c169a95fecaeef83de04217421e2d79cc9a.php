<p>Waiting around for filming to begin, the Irish presenter seemed to be in good spirits as she brushed off her recent incident with body-shaming trolls.   </p>

<p>The broadcaster garnered much adulation when she shared a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini for a tan tutorial on Instagram.</p>

<p>However, the TV star returned to the image-sharing platform to reveal she had also been subject to some 'awful' comments for appearance.  </p>

<p>Bold: Host Steph McGovern turned heads in a vibrant cherry red trouser suit that she teamed with a plain white T-shirt and fresh trainers </p>

<p>Leggy lady! Miquita Oliver also opted for a scarlet number as she rocked a red floral mini dress that she teamed with black loafers </p>

<p>Ladies in red: The pair laughed away together on the set before filming began for the show </p>

<p>The Irish beauty wrote: 'There is no secret! I got a lot of comments and mails about the video I posted the other day. Mainly positive but my god there were some awful ones!</p>

<p>'I hate the term "snapping back" it’s not something I aspire to do after having a child nor do I think it’s important. My body is different to other people’s, I didn’t do anything specific.</p>

<p>'I’ve only recently started training again, 4 times a week for 45 minutes a session. I try to eat healthily but I have not cut calories and eat a lot more than usual as I’m breastfeeding and it’s important to keep calories up so you have a good milk supply.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Statement: Vogue recently hit back at trolls after she was body-shamed for her post-baby weight loss, six weeks after giving birth to her daughter Gigi</p>

<p>'I trained the whole way throughout my pregnancy and I think that is a factor in the way I look now. I’m also VERY tall so there’s a lot more room for a baby.' </p>

<p>Revealing that she's been a fitness devotee for almost half her life, she continued: 'I’ve trained since I was 16, for me it’s a great thing not only for my body but for my mind too.</p>

<p>'At the moment I feel permanently exhausted but training gives me energy and keeps my hormones under more control (they are still all over the place a little as with any new mother).'</p>
