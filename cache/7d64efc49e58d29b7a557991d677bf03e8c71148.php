<p>For the spread featured in the September issue of Maxim, the 35-year-old actress showed off her figure in a variety of bodysuits and a pair of thigh-high boots, which she had no problem getting wet.</p>

<p>It was Lydia's first time in front of the camera amid the coronavirus pandemic, and Scott Buccheit photographed her from afar using FaceTime.  </p>

<p>Making it work! Scott Buccheit photographed her via FaceTime while she was in quarantine </p>

<p>In one shot, the model can be seen sitting on the pool steps wearing a black see-through mesh leotard over a matching triangle top. Her wet hair is slicked back, and a diamond ring is sparkling on her left hand, which is held up to her face. </p>

<p>Another shows her modeling an off-the-shoulder floral leotard and suede thigh-high boots while standing in the pool. Lydia also donned a long-sleeve bodysuit featuring a plunging neckline as she floated in the water.   </p>

<p>The Z Nation star was joined by her comedian husband Chris, 48, who assisted with the shoot, and their dog, an Otterhound named Zoltar. Behind-the-scenes photos show her cuddling the beloved pooch, and at one point, she even brought him into the water with her. </p>

<p>Lydia, who is the great-granddaughter of publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, has wanted to be an actress since she was a child. In her interview with Maxim, she recalled being on film sets with her famous mother, Patty Hearst. </p>

<p>However, she actually got her first big break as a model after famed fashion photographer Steven Meisel shot her for the cover of Vogue Italia's April 2004 issue. </p>

<p>'My life changed overnight when I did the cover and editorial for Vogue Italia,' Lydia recalled. 'In my fashion career I have had the opportunity to travel the world and work with some of the most iconic designers and photographers to date. </p>

<p>'Because of my work in fashion, I developed my own unique and personal sense of style, and learned how to be comfortable in my own skin.' </p>

<p>Sultry: Lydia was photographed topless as she modeled a pair of suede thigh-high boots</p>

<p>All in: Lydia even wore the boots in the water for a series of photos during the shoot </p>

<p>Famous face: Lydia got her big break as a model when Steven Meisel shot her for the cover of Vogue Italia's April 2004 issue</p>

<p>Lydia eventually transitioned into acting, and in the past five years, she has appeared in eight movies, including Between Worlds with Nicolas Cage and #Horror with Natasha Lyonne and Chloe Sevigny. </p>

<p>She is also co-executive producing and co-starring the vampire movie With Teeth with Malin Ackerman. They plan to film the flick this fall, depending on the pandemic.    </p>

<p>Lydia's latest shoot perfectly captures the feel that summer is ending and fall is right around the corner, a season that Lydia is likely looking forward to considering her love of horror.  </p>

<p>She found her match when she met Chris, who loves the genre as much as she does. The couple channeled their shared passion when they planned their Sci-Fi/horor-themed wedding in 2016. </p>

<p>Helping hand: Lydia's husband Chris Hardwick, 48, assisted the photographer during the shoot </p>

<p>Hugs and kisses: Behind the scenes, she was joined by her dog, an Otterhound named Zoltar</p>

<p>Fun in the sun: At one point, Lydia brought her beloved dog into the water with her </p>

<p>'Horror movies temporarily create the emotional experience of fear without the devastating consequences — because in reality no psychotic killer, ghostly demon or chainsaw-wielding murderer is truly after you,' Lydia said. </p>

<p>'It’s not just about cheap thrills and jump scares. Most great horror films rely on atmosphere and suspense rather than gore,' she noted. </p>

<p>'I love a film that isn’t just scary, but that is effectively creepy. Creepy is much more difficult to pull off. </p>

<p>'I also love the feeling of that adrenaline rush when you’re captivated by a great film and are engulfed by the feeling of suspense.'</p>
