<p>Sensational: Davina McCall has admitted she isn't 'pert and tight' like she was in her 20s despite her gym-toned physique</p>

<p>Davina told the podcast that despite her body changing in recent years she still embraces her toned figure.</p>

<p>She said: 'I'm not all pert and tight like I was when I was 20. If I lean over…my skin sags down at the middle, the front, but I feel like I am the best version that I can be for my age, and that gives me confidence. </p>

<p>'You can wear your body well if you've got confidence.' </p>

<p>Incredible: The presenter who is known for sharing her fitness regime on social media, said that she's embraced her 'sagging' skin and still feels 'the best version' she could be for her age</p>

<p>The former Big Brother host added that she was still 'vulnerable and fragile,' during her 20s, and after reaching her 50s she feels better than ever.</p>

<p>She said: 'How attractive you are is entirely based on you feel about yourself, and if I could tell my 20-year-old self that - and really explain it - I think it would have changed my life.</p>

<p>'I was very vulnerable and fragile, and the voice in my head was so loud and so negative, all the time… Now I wake up in the morning and I think I look like a supermodel! I walk around my bedroom naked saying ''yeah check you out''!'</p>

<p>Candid: Davina also discussed the brazen methods she used to educate her three children about the changes of puberty, as she wanted them to learn that it wasn't 'disgusting'</p>

<p>During the podcast Lena also chatted about how she's prepared her three children Holly, 18, Tilly, 16, and Chester, 13, for the changes that come with puberty.</p>

<p>The star admitted she was incredibly open with her family about the changes that come with becoming a teenager, even if it meant sacrificing certain parts of her beauty regime.</p>

<p>She added: 'Even down to waxing my privates, when they [her children] were going through puberty and, therefore, their bodies were changing, I kept everything there bar, like, a bikini wax, just to show them what they had was normal, because mummy's got it too.</p>

<p>'Obviously now they can do what they like, they're 16 and 18 , but when they were little - 12, 13, 14 - I didn't want them thinking they were disgusting because they had pubes.'</p>

<p>In shape: The former Big Brother host added that she was still 'vulnerable and fragile,' during her 20s, and after reaching her 50s she feels better than ever</p>

<p>After also gracing the cover of Women's Health magazine, Davina went onto reveal her plans to start a 'sexy, lacey lingerie' business next year.</p>

<p>She said: 'I was going to try and launch this year, but because of Covid and everything I think it's probably best to just see how the dust settles. We will launch next year, and that's a big goal of mine. </p>

<p>'I'm terrified about it, but it's so exciting…it's four women, post-baby bodies. It's sexy, it's lacy, it's pretty, it's feminine, but it's like saying to women ''you might feel invisible, but I see you''.'</p>
