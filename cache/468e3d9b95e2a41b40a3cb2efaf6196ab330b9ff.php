<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jurgen Klopp hailed Fabinho's performance at centre-back after Liverpool beat Chelsea 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in Sunday's Premier League showdown.</p>

<p>The Brazilian midfielder was shoehorned into defence due to injuries to Joe Gomez and Joel Matip but had an impressive game as the top-flight champions won at 10-man Chelsea thanks to a second-half brace from Sadio Mane.</p>

<p>Fabinho denied Chelsea's new star striker Timo Werner twice in one-on-one duels during the tense first-half and Klopp praised his player for his versatility.</p>

<p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp claimed the Brazilian was one of the best players on the pitch</p>

<p>Speaking after the victory, Klopp told Sky Sports: 'Fabinho was a top player. He's really good in one on one situations. </p>

<p>'He was outstanding. If Sadio doesn't score two goals, Fabinho would have been a man of the match contender.'  </p>

<p>Liverpool have been linked with bringing in a new centre-back to partner Virgil van Dijk during the current transfer window though have yet to bring in a new option. </p>

<p>The Reds signed Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara, who made his Liverpool debut in the second-half of the Chelsea match on Sunday, along with back-up left-back Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiacos. </p>

<p>Sky Sports pundit and Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher claimed that Fabinho could be an interesting option in the heart of the defence for Klopp this season and hinted that the German boss does not need to dip into the market for a new defender.</p>

<p>Carragher claimed: 'There's been talking of Liverpool needing a centre-back but I thought Fabinho was outstanding today. They've got so many midfield players they've got to give them games.'</p>

<p>Fellow Sky pundit Ashley Cole added:  'Klopp has got them (Liverpool) very organised and well-drilled. </p>

<p>Sky Sports pundits believe Fabinho could be a more regular option for the Reds at centre-back </p>

<p>'We did think Fabinho was going to be exposed but when Liverpool play like that it's very difficult to regain control of the game.'  </p>

<p>Liverpool's mission at Stamford Bridge was made easier by Andreas Christensen's red card just moments before half-time. </p>

<p>The Chelsea defender hauled down Mane when through on goal to receive his marching orders from Paul Tierney, who initially gave the Dane a yellow card before VAR intervened. </p>

<p>Mane then struck twice in the second period, which also saw Alisson save a late penalty from Jorginho, to continue Liverpool's perfect start to the Premier League season, with Klopp claiming that his side played well in victory. </p>

<p>The Liverpool boss added: 'It was a really good game for both teams. I liked our game a lot. It's really tricky. We had to learn in the game. Our own football I liked. </p>

<p>'The second half was a different game. It was challenging for concentration. We kept the ball rolling. </p>

<p>'We scored the goals (though) conceded a penalty, I'm not sure it was one. Everyone was involved (in the win).'</p>
