<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Investors who 'sold in May' as the old adage encourages, would have missed out on the remarkable rally that followed.</p>

<p>Though global markets took a beating earlier this year as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, much of the losses suffered have since been reclaimed - and in some countries, notably the US, shares are up.</p>

<p>This is the eighteenth time over the last 30 years that the popular saying has fallen short - showing it is an unpredictable guide for investors.</p>

<p>The well-known adage to 'sell in May, and go away' encourages investors to sell their holdings at the start of summer and leave their portfolios untouched until mid-September</p>

<p>The well-known maxim, based on the premise that equity markets will experience a seasonal decline during the summer months, encourages investors to sell their holdings at the start of May and stay out of the market until the St Leger stakes horse racing festival.</p>

<p>However, global markets have bounced backfrom the pain of February and lows of March. The US S&amp;P 500 index has even managed to hit a record high, while the tech-focussed Nasdaq has soared.</p>

<p>Even the more lacklustre Uk stock market has defied the 'sell in May' adage. The FTSE All Share rose by 3.7 per cent between 1 May and 31 August.</p>

<p>Selling in May was likely to br highly tempting this year, to lock in some of the bounce back from the market lows seen around 23 March.</p>

<p>It's understandable why some may have succumbed to panic and sold after the tumultuous events that have taken place this year, with the coronavirus pandemic at the forefront. </p>

<p>But trying to time the market is notoriously difficult and most experts would say to remain long-term holders when it comes to investing, avoiding knee-jerk reactions no matter what short-term hits may occur.</p>

<p>Investors are also advised to diversify their holdings around the world and not suffer from home bias. A tip that would have paid off, as the US stock market, which makes up about 60 per cent of the global market, has roared back this year.</p>

<p>The broad S&amp;P 500 index was up 21 per cent betwen 1 May and 31 August, while the Nasdaq climbed 23.1 per cent. </p>

<p>Their performance since May was closely followed by Germany's Dax 30 index, however, with a 19.8 per cent return. </p>

<p>Fidelity's figures did not run all the way to St Leger day and stopped at the end of August, so they failed to take into account the market wobble of the past week.</p>

<p>The Nasdaq has slipped back 7 per cent since then, while the S&amp;P 500 has dropped back 4.6 per cent, while the FTSE All Share is up about 0.5 per cent and the FTSE 100 is up 0.9 per cent. </p>

<p>Those who exited the market in anticipation of a summer lull will have been extremely disappointed this year. </p>

<p>Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said: 'To say this year has been unpredictable is something of an understatement. </p>

<p>'This is particularly true of financial markets, which continue to defy expectations by not only recovering their losses from the start of the year - but climbing beyond pre-pandemic levels in some cases.</p>

<p>'"Selling in May" certainly hasn't paid this year, with investors now facing a double blow; not only will they have missed out on the opportunity to boost their returns but face the challenge of buying back in at a greater cost.'  </p>

<p>Has 'selling in May' worked over the past 30 years? Analysis of the FTSE All Share return between 1 May and 1 September since 1991 shows the adage has only rang true 12 times</p>

<p>Investors with holdings in the US will be particularly pleased with the performance of the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq over the past few months, with the performance of popular technology stocks driving much of their recovery.</p>

<p>Current favourites Tesla and Apple have recently performed stock splits which has only boosted their popularity and experts believe the value of their shares could rise by a third in the coming 12 months. </p>

<p>Stevenson added: 'Much has been made of the divergence between market sentiment and economic news since the outbreak of Covid-19, with investors remaining optimistic in their outlook despite a raft of negative data. </p>

<p>'Predicting what will happen over the coming months remains almost impossible, with almost as many reasons to feel encouraged as to worry about further volatility.'</p>

<p>However, Stevenson adds there are some key principles which investors can rely on in place of superstitions. </p>

<p>This includes ensuring your portfolio is diversified across a range of geographies, sectors and asset classes, drip-feeding your contributions regularly, and 'keeping a cool head' which he says will 'serve you well, no matter which way markets turn'.</p>

<p>Alasdair Ronald, consultant at Brewin Dolphin, lists the best-known investment adages and shares whether he thinks they have made the grade at a time of market volatility and economic stress:</p>

<p>'The first cut is the cheapest'</p>

<p>The economic impact of Covid-19 has laid entire sectors low, with travel, hospitality, and bricks and mortar retailers largely still languishing in share price terms compared to how they started the year. </p>

<p>The banking sector has been among them and, through the pandemic, has gradually moved from being a standalone set of businesses to proxies for government policy. </p>

<p>'Never try to catch a falling knife'</p>

<p>When a share or a commodity starts to drop, it’s tempting to see a buying opportunity. But that doesn’t mean you should pile in. </p>

<p>Many of the banks’ share prices looked cheap even before the crisis hit – now they are even cheaper and do not pay a dividend. Lloyds Banking Group started the year at around 63p per share, but now sits at around 27p. </p>

<p>Given the role many of them will have to play in helping economies get back on their feet, their share prices may remain low for some time yet. </p>

<p>'Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful'</p>

<p>At the height of the pandemic, the FTSE 100 dropped as much as 34 per cent from the start of the year – the S&amp;P 500 fell a slightly more modest 25 per cent. </p>

<p>However, along with other indexes, they have since staged varying degrees of recovery with the FTSE 100 up around 18 per cent on its low point in March and the S&amp;P 500 gaining more than 50 per cent. </p>

<p>If you had bought into the market at peak fear, you would be sitting on a reasonable profit now. </p>
