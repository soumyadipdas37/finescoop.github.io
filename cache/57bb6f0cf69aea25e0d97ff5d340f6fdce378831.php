<p>ELOISE, 37</p>

<p>Dating Past?</p>

<p>I was married to a guy I was with for seven years, but we divorced as we realised we were living more as friends. I came out later in life, at 30. I was attracted to women in my teens, but had my first son at 17, so focused on being a mum.</p>

<p>I use dating apps, but prefer to meet people organically.</p>

<p>Pre-date nerves?</p>

<p>Single for six months, two sons aged 20 and 14.</p>

<p>CURRENT ROLE</p>

<p>Yoga and health coach.</p>

<p>WOULD LIKE TO MEET</p>

<p>Someone who is emotionally intelligent and charismatic, with varied interests.</p>

<p>I thought I would be nervous as it’s so unusual to go on a blind date these days, but I’d read Bethany’s description and all of my friends agreed she sounded like the person for me. Also, as a former lawyer, I’m used to meeting new people.</p>

<p>Now I’m a yoga teacher and a vegan (I know, cliché). For the date, I picked a lovely vegan restaurant in North London, which was half-way between both of us.</p>

<p>First Impressions?</p>

<p>Bethany arrived before me and was already at our table when I got there. It’s rare I keep someone waiting! She was instantly friendly and warm, but I knew straight away there was no romantic attraction for me.</p>

<p>Easy to talk to?</p>

<p>Bethany works with dogs and puppies and it sounds like a dream job. I loved hearing about the animals she looks after, and how she helps owners gently realise that having a puppy is like having a child.</p>

<p>My mum has two rescue dogs and I’d love to have one myself, but that would be hard for me right now.</p>

<p>We also talked about where we have travelled. We’ve both been to Thailand and I’ve lived in Cambodia. It was a really lovely way to spend an afternoon.</p>

<p>Embarrassing moments?</p>

<p>None.</p>

<p>Did sparks fly?</p>

<p>For me, unfortunately, definitely not. The spark is either there or it isn’t. I’d like to keep in touch with Bethany, though.</p>

<p>What do you think she thought of you?</p>

<p>I think she liked me and I hope we stay in touch as friends.</p>

<p>Would your friends like her?</p>

<p>They absolutely would, Bethany would get on with anyone.</p>

<p>Freelance dog walker Bethany, 35, (pictured) has been single for two years </p>

<p>BETHANY, 35</p>

<p>Dating Past?</p>

<p>The last person I dated was much younger than me. She was a chef and I was cabin crew for Virgin Atlantic at the time — it was fabulous because I got paid to travel the world, but neither of us had much time for one another.</p>

<p>I’ve had my heart broken a couple of times, but I always give myself time to recover.</p>

<p>Pre-Date Nerves?</p>

<p>I was a little nervous because I haven’t been on a blind date in ages, but my friends were reassuring and reminded me that I’m very chatty. They told me not to forget to let her speak!</p>

<p>Single for two years, no children.</p>

<p>CURRENT ROLE</p>

<p>Freelance dog walker.</p>

<p>WOULD LIKE TO MEET</p>

<p>Someone who is funny and who appreciates family values. When I go on family holidays, I’d like it if she could come, too.</p>

<p>First Impressions?</p>

<p>I arrived 15 minutes early. I hate being late and I always like to scope out the other diners. I was wearing jeans, ankle boots and a silk shirt, and Eloise was wearing a black dress with a leather jacket and trainers. She is really beautiful, with icy-blue eyes.</p>

<p>Easy To Talk To?</p>

<p>It was like we’d known one another for years. We’ve both been through recent career changes: I’m hoping to study veterinary medicine, while Eloise has left law and is a yoga teacher and health coach. She is also studying Buddhism.</p>

<p>I’m in Alcoholics Anonymous and have been teetotal since the start of the year. There is a lot of cross-over in the teachings and beliefs of both.</p>

<p>Embarrassing Moments?</p>

<p>None. We’d agreed to share some starters and, fortunately, both mentally picked the same three.</p>

<p>Did Sparks Fly?</p>

<p>Yes, I think so. I’d definitely like to get to know Eloise and see what happens. We exchanged numbers and I messaged her the morning after our date — but then I worried I was coming across as too keen!</p>

<p>What do you think she thought of you?</p>

<p>I hope she thinks I’m funny. I was trying to be friendly and easy to talk to.</p>

<p>Would your family like her?</p>

<p>Yes, they’d love her. She’s warm and puts you at ease straight away.</p>

<p>LIKED? That we laughed a lot.</p>

<p>REGRETS? None.</p>

<p>COFFEE OR CAB? Coffee</p>

<p>LIKED? Bethany was really friendly.</p>

<p>REGRETS? None.</p>

<p>COFFEE OR CAB? Coffee.</p>
