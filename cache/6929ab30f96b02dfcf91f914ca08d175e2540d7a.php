<p>The devastating loss of banking services in Ware reflects a plague sweeping across the nation – which all communities must now fight against.</p>

<p>Our high streets are increasingly being blighted by empty and deteriorating former bank branches – as you find in this once thriving Hertfordshire town.</p>

<p>We can expect many temporarily closed branches to shut permanently over the coming months and I anticipate that other branches will follow suit and close for good. </p>

<p>The digital banking revolution was inevitable. But it now seems to have turned into a race about how soon banks can close the last branch in town.</p>

<p>In the past six years alone, 5,500 branches have been shut – and the bank network has shrunk by 40 per cent as a result.</p>

<p>An ill-timed Community Access to Cash Pilots initiative launched just as the coronavirus crisis was taking grip offers a last-ditch opportunity to stop the rot.</p>

<p>In bigger towns, this could include the option of running shared bank branches.</p>

<p>Community Access to Cash Pilots came about following an independent Access to Cash Review last year by former Financial Ombudsman Services boss Natalie Ceeney.</p>

<p>It selected eight locations to test ways of keeping access to cash on the high street, but four appear to need no more than just a free cash machine. These pilots are due to be started this autumn – but because of the timing they may have to be delayed further because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>But for the initiative to work, greater commitment from the banking industry is required.</p>

<p>There is no reason why the shared bank branch approach cannot prove a great success – providing a banking solution for communities such as the good folk of Ware who have been abandoned by the banks.</p>
