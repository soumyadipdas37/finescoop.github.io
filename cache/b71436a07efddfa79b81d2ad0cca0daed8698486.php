<p>The two families have been friends for years and they certainly seemed in high spirits as they posed for a group picture. </p>

<p>Last month, the actor confirmed he's currently working on a director's cut of Rocky IV to mark the sports drama's upcoming anniversary on November 27.</p>

<p>'For the 35th anniversary Rocky 4 Is getting a new DIRECTORS cut by me,' he wrote in an Instagram post along with an image of Rocky facing-off with his Soviet rival, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren).</p>

<p>Yo Rock! Last month, the actor confirmed he's currently working on a director's cut of Rocky IV to mark the sports drama's upcoming anniversary on November 27</p>

<p>'So far it looks great. Soulful.. Thank you MGM For this opportunity to entertain.' </p>

<p>Stallone, who directed the original 1985 film, is working on a new edit himself. If he follows the model of directors' cuts of the past, there will likely be more screen time for Rocky.</p>

<p>What fans won't be seeing in the updated cut: Paulie's (Burt Young) robot butler named Sico. Some critics and fans over the years had deemed the robot as too gimmicky and campy.   </p>

<p>'The robot is going to the junkyard forever. No more robot,' he responded to one fan while adding to another, 'I don't like the robot anymore.'   </p>

<p>Fans and followers appeared to be split on whether Sico should be removed from the updated version.   </p>

<p>KO punch: Stallone confirmed he's at the helm of the director's cut of Rocky IV on Instagram</p>
