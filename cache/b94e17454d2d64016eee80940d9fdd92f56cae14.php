<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Last week, paint brand Dulux unveiled its colour of the year for 2021 — an earthy beige hue called Brave Ground to take us past Covid uncertainty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my inbox is full of trend forecasters rhapsodising about home furnishings in muted sage green, broccoli brown and that crime against humanity 'greige'.</p>

<p>How can painting your home shades of sludge make anyone feel better about living through a pandemic?</p>

<p>The Dulux people argue that Brave Ground is an 'elemental' hue to reflect 'the strength we can draw from nature and a growing desire to align with the planet and look to the future'. </p>

<p>Last week, paint brand Dulux unveiled its colour of the year for 2021 — an earthy beige hue called Brave Ground (pictured) to take us past Covid uncertainty</p>

<p>They claim it will empower us to create 'subtly responsive environments' where we can reflect, recharge and recalibrate.</p>

<p>But, frankly, we need bright colours to cheer us. I understand that people are desperate for peace and comfort. But earthy natural colours are a downer.</p>

<p>Our living rooms may be the closest we get to live theatre this winter, so let's add some wit and drama. </p>

<p>Ditch hues of elephant brown with pondweed accessories and go for Technicolor instead.</p>

<p>Speaking as a woman with a purple garden (Cuprinol Garden Shades in Lavender) and a red kitchen (B&amp;Q matched it to my Ruby Woo lipstick), I'll not go quietly.</p>

<p>When you're feeling sad and anxious, nothing beats getting out the sample pots — whether your budget runs to Farrow &amp; Ball (from £47.95) or Frenchic's Lazy Range (£6.95).</p>

<p>So I'm torn between zingy pink and arsenic green. If we are all going to be locked down again for winter, then I want my front door to deliver a huge blast of vulgar joy.</p>
