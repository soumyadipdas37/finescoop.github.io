<p>The Total Bellas star revealed that she's 18 pounds away from her pre-pregnancy weight, but also admitted part of the weight gain was due to her quarantine indulgence. </p>

<p>She added: 'I want to blame so bad COVID and being in Arizona with a lot of heat that I didn’t get to workout like I used to. But no. I indulged in pizza quite a bit especially towards the end and baked goods. </p>

<p>'I have to take full accountability, so I am now in a journey to lose 18 pounds, but in the most healthiest way possible because I’m breastfeeding obviously, and giving my son the most amazing nutrition is No. 1, so there’s going to be no crash-diets, no starving myself.'</p>

<p>Nikki later gave a glimpse at her postpartum fitness routine, posting a compilation TikTok of herself breaking a sweat in a black sports bra and matching leggings.</p>
