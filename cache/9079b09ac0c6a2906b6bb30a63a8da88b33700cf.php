<p>Home cooks are whipping up decadent vanilla slices using just three basic ingredients found in their kitchen (picture of one home cook's creation using three ingredients)</p>

<p>INGREDIENTS</p>

<p>Aeroplane vanilla flavoured custard mix</p>

<p>Thickened cream </p>

<p>Arnott's Lattice biscuits</p>

<p>METHOD</p>

<p>In a bowl, combine the custard mix and cream with an electric beater until smooth.</p>

<p>Place a layer of biscuits in a serving tray or plate. Spoon the custard mixture on top of the biscuits, then spread the filling evenly over the base.</p>

<p>Gently press another layer of biscuits on top of the filling.</p>

<p>Cover and refrigerate for one hour. To serve, cut into slices.</p>

<p>Makes eight slices</p>

<p>Many quickly responded to the thread with their own versions after they used the same products to whip up the simple dessert at home.</p>

<p>One home cook said the biscuits are a great alternative to puff pastry. </p>

<p>'I use these products, and find the biscuits easier than pastry,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Another woman said the dessert was very easy to assemble as it requires no baking.</p>

<p>'I made them for my family and they wanted more. I made mine with Lattice biscuits - and wow, they are yummy, wonderful desserts and very easy - no cooking just put in the fridge,' she explained.</p>

<p>Another woman said she used two packets of custard mix, 600mL of cream, half a cup of milk and puff pastry to create the dessert</p>

<p>Many admitted they ended up 'eating the whole' dessert because it tasted 'delicious' while others said they liked to top the slices with icing sugar or passionfruit.</p>

<p>'It turned out beautiful, and no deep dish needed,' she said.</p>
