<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former My Kitchen Rules star-turned-radio host Ash Pollard has recalled her terrifying breast cancer scare. </p>

<p>The 34-year-old discovered two lumps while in the shower, when she was aged 19 and studying in Sydney, away from her family on the Gold Coast.</p>

<p>Speaking to News Corp ahead of her debut on The All New Monty: Guys and Gals on Sunday, Ash understandably reflected on being 'so traumatised' from the ordeal. </p>

<p>'I was so traumatised': Ash Pollard (pictured), 34, recalled the horrifying moment she discovered two lumps while in the shower at age 19, in an interview with News Corp. She is set to debut on Sunday's The All New Monty: Guys and Gals, to raise awareness for cancer </p>

<p>'I called my mum and said, "I've got this random lump under my arm" and as I dragged my hand across the top of my breast, I felt another one,' she recalled.</p>

<p>Two lumps were confirmed after undergoing a mammogram and ultrasound.</p>

<p>'That's when it all really became apparent that this might not be a nice lump. It all started to get a bit horrifying,' Ash said.   </p>

<p>Fortunately the lumps were only benign cancer cells, that were then removed.  </p>

<p>Difficult to process: Fortunately the lumps were only benign cancer cells, that were then removed. 'Although it wasn't cancerous, at such a young age, I was so traumatised and didn't understand how to process all that stuff,' the reality star-turned-radio host said </p>

<p>'Although it wasn't cancerous, at such a young age, I was so traumatised and didn't understand how to process all that stuff,' Ash went on to say. </p>

<p>This isn't the first time Ash has spoken candidly about her terrifying health scare. </p>

<p>On her Sea FM breakfast show back in 2018, Ash encouraged women to check their breasts for the I Touch Myself Project.</p>

<p>'I had a I Touch Myself moment a long time ago. I was doing that in the shower and I felt something in my breast. It was a tumour,' she said at the time.   </p>

<p>Speaking out: This isn't the first time Ash has spoken candidly about her terrifying health scare. On her Sea FM breakfast show in 2018, Ash encouraged women to check their breasts for the I Touch Myself Project </p>

<p>She continued: 'I went to the doctor and ended up having to go to the hospital quite quickly to get tests on these lumps and they came back as tumours.</p>

<p>'They didn't know if they were cancerous or not and that was the most awful thing to go through - the waiting process and finding out what the tumours were.' </p>

<p>Despite her clean bill of health, Ash is still haunted by the experience.</p>

<p>Ordeal: 'They didn't know if they were cancerous or not and that was the most awful thing to go through - the waiting process and finding out what the tumours were,' Ash said of the two lumps she discovered </p>

<p>'I don't think I've ever gotten over it,' she said on her radio show. 'Even though I never had cancer, if that stayed in my breast it could have turned cancerous.' </p>

<p>Ash is one of 15 Australian stars in the line-up for Channel Seven's The All New Monty: Guys and Gals.</p>

<p>The three-part televised event which premieres on Sunday, is to raise awareness for men's and women's cancers.  </p>
