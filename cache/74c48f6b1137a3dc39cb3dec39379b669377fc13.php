<p>And the 'Birthday suit' snap was the main topic of conversation for Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain. </p>

<p>Piers, 55, was full of praise for the Hollywood star, gushing she looked 'sensational' before quipping that his co-star should consider stripping off for her own birthday.  </p>

<p>Wow! Gwyneth Paltrow's 'Birthday suit' snap was the main topic of conversation for Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain</p>

<p>'48 years old... I mean, she does look sensational, you have to admit. There's no other way of describing it,' Piers said as the image of Gwyneth flashed up on the screen. </p>

<p>'Interesting decision to do that. I mean would you two [Charlotte Hawkins and Susanna] do that?' he then asked his two co-stars.</p>

<p>'No,' Susanna promptly replied, leaving Piers to ask her: 'Does that mean you'll be a year older than Gwyneth?'</p>

<p>'In nothing but my birthday suit today': Gwyneth shared a jaw-dropping snap of herself posing completely naked in a lush backyard as she celebrated her 48th birthday on Monday</p>

<p>'Yes I am and I'm going to be 50 in December,' Susanna replied, before jokingly adding: 'It did cross my mind - shall I do that for my 50th birthday!'</p>

<p>Piers was delighted, saying:'Yes! Yes! Susanna Reid birthday pic at 50. </p>

<p>But Susanna pointed out: 'And then my mind went to how much embarrassment it would cause the children.'</p>

<p>'And Apple, who is Gwyneth's 16-year-old daughter, just put one word on the comments section - 'Mum'. You can just feel the weight of that 'Mum'.' </p>

<p>Not gonna happen: Piers, 55, was full of praise for the star, gushing she looked 'sensational' before quipping that his co-star should consider stripping off for her own birthday.</p>

<p>In her caption, Gwyneth thanked everyone for their birthday wishes while also plugging her lifestyle brand Goop.</p>

<p>'In nothing but my birthday suit today... thank you all so much for the birthday wishes and thank you to <?php echo e('@'); ?>goop 's insanely amazing brand new body butter for making me think I can still get my kit off. #goopgenes' she captioned the snap. </p>

<p>Gwyneth was definitely feeling the love from Instagram fans, if not her daughter Apple.</p>

<p>A slew of stars sent their well-wishes to Gwyneth including Demi Moore, Lea Michele and Courteney Cox. </p>

<p>Mum! Susanna pointed out: 'It did cross my mind... and then my mind went to how much embarrassment it would cause the children'</p>

<p>Not cool, Mom! While Gwyneth's snap delighted countless fans, there was one Instagram user who was not amused - and that was her teenage daughter Apple Martin, 16 </p>

<p>Living her best life: Gwyneth had no time for Apple's prudish response and commented back with three crying laughing emojis</p>
