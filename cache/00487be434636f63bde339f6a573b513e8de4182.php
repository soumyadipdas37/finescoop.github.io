<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A prominent doctor has accused both the state and federal governments of trying to cover up a potential major shortage of face masks for medical staff.</p>

<p>Dr Yvom Sharma claims it has been widely known for months that the number of face masks available was less than that required to keep front line workers safe.</p>

<p>This is despite both the federal and state governments insisting stocks are adequate.</p>

<p>Dr Sharma said the lack of transparency on mask numbers from government officials has denied workers any opportunity to source other options for personal protection.</p>

<p>'Certainly on behalf of medical staff who are working on COVID wards and in aged care, we've always known there is a shortage of N95 masks,' Dr Sharma told Today.</p>

<p>'It's something that governments have constantly denied. If they'd owned up to it earlier, we could have been talking about other solutions.'</p>

<p>Dr Sharma said while there is a shortage of key materials all over the world, we must ensure our medical professionals are using the best quality protective equipment when dealing with coronavirus patients.  </p>

<p>'We know we need N95 masks for medical staff facing COVID, we know we need fit testing and I'm glad we've finally arrived at the truth,' he said. </p>

<p>'Hopefully we can drive up production and acquisition of these masks so were ready for heaven forbid the third wave if it ever comes.' </p>

<p>The Melbourne GP said while dropping COVID-19 case numbers in Victoria were encouraging and showed progress, there was still a long way to go in the pandemic. </p>

<p>'We don't need to do everything perfectly, we just need to do lots of things good enough,' he said.</p>

<p>Dr Sharma's comments were disputed by Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth, who claimed there was no critical shortage of PPE in Australia.</p>

<p>'We have millions of N95 masks in the national stockpile and equally Victoria does as well,' he told the program.</p>

<p>Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth (pictured) quashed Dr Sharma's claims and said there was no critical shortage of PPE in Australia</p>

<p>'Provided the guidelines are followed then we have more than enough PPE to protect the healthcare workers who are our most valuable resource.'</p>

<p>Dr Coatsworth believes issues had risen as experts were trying to expand the range of patients for whom medical staff should wear N95 masks.</p>

<p>'There is a view within the medical and nursing community that the use of N-95 respirators should be expanded,' he said.</p>

<p>'If you use N95 respirators for every healthcare interaction then you start running into problems.</p>

<p>'Whilst there is no shortage at the moment - nobody is in a position to supply infinite number of N-95 respirators to the healthcare system.</p>

<p>'It's important we follow the guidelines which we are formulating with the best interests of protecting healthcare and aged care workers.'</p>

<p>WHO advisor Mary-Louise McLaws (pictured) believes a lack of PPE for medical staff played a huge role in the deadly second wave of coronavirus  in Victoria</p>

<p>Dr Sharma's calls come after Victorian Chief Medical Officer Andrew Wilson claimed Victorian health workers are being forced to use second rate face masks to deal with coronavirus patients due to a shortage in the state. </p>

<p>Professor Wilson said the state would burn through the supplies of the best quality personal protective equipment in one week in private meetings leaked to the ABC.</p>

<p>The leak found doctors and nurses have not been fit tested for N95 masks, while staff who work directly with COVID-19 patients have been unable to access them.</p>

<p>Health authorities believe the lack of adequate personal protective equipment for medical staff played a vital role in the size of the deadly second wave of the disease in Victoria. </p>

<p>WHO advisor and epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws said not having the proper protective equipment for COVID workers wasn't good enough. </p>

<p>'It's poor leadership, it's unconscionable and it's unethical not to have a continuous uninterrupted supply for our frontline healthcare workers,' she said.</p>

<p>Chief Medical Officer Andrew Wilson (pictured) was leaked saying medical staff would burn through all supplies of N95 masks in Victoria in one week</p>

<p>Health workers and unions have been crying out for N95 masks since April, with Premier Daniel Andrews claiming in August there were 'substantial reserves' of the masks available.</p>

<p>After being questioned about a shortage of available N95 masks, Professor Wilson said there had always been enough available for medical staff. </p>

<p>'All decisions about PPE use in our health services has been guided by expert advice and evidence, with the best possible protection for staff the primary consideration, and thankfully supply has always met that guidance,' he said.</p>

<p>Around 20 per cent of Victoria's coronavirus cases in July and August came from medical staff.</p>

<p>Infectious disease expert Raina Macintyre believes a shortage in available masks lead to a large number of health care workers being struck down by COVID-19. </p>

<p>'There's no doubt that with better PPE, fit testing and a precautionary approach, much of this wave in health workers could have been prevented,' she said.</p>
