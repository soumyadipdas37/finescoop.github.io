<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rodrigo De Paul dropped a Twitter hint that his long-anticipated transfer to Leeds United is moving closer - before deleting the message.</p>

<p>The Argentina attacking midfielder, who plays in Italy for Udinese, has been linked with a switch to Elland Road for some time.</p>

<p>Newly-promoted Leeds played superbly against reigning champions Liverpool in their Premier League opener on Saturday but Marcelo Bielsa is still looking to strengthen his squad.</p>

<p>Leeds United target Rodrigo De Paul has dropped a hint that he is keen to move to Elland Road</p>

<p>The Argentine appeared to confirm on Twitter that talks are ongoing over his move to Leeds</p>

<p>And having already signed the forward Rodrigo from Valencia, Bielsa is now keen on signing his 26-year-old namesake before the window closes.</p>

<p>It seems De Paul is keen to move to Yorkshire as well, replying to a Twitter post by Leeds fanzine The Square Ball.</p>

<p>They wrote 'Apparently he's keen on the move but it now rests with the clubs' to which De Paul replied 'Yes' with a fingers crossed emoji.</p>

<p>Udinese value the Argentine attacking midfielder at £37m but Leeds want to drive that down</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa is keen on further squad additions despite a good opening day performance</p>

<p>De Paul later deleted the tweet but not before causing a stir among The Square Ball's followers.</p>

<p>Udinese want £37million for De Paul, which is higher than the Premier League club's valuation but negotiations are ongoing it would seem.</p>

<p>Aside from the forward Rodrigo, Leeds have also signed the Germany international centre-back Robin Koch from Freiburg and made permanent the loans of Helder Costa and Illan Meslier.</p>

<p>Jack Harrison has also signed for a third season on loan from Manchester City.</p>
