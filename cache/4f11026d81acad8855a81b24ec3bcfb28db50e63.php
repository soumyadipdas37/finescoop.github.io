<p>Working up a sweat: Rumer Willis, 32, showed off her fit figure in a sporty outfit while braving LA's triple-digit heat wave for a hike with her friend Allie Marie Evans</p>

<p>Rumer flaunted her toned legs and tried to stay cool in the outfit, which featured a pair of high-waisted black shorts.</p>

<p>She matched them with a black tank top and tied her hair up in a thick top knot to help beat the heat. </p>

<p>The daughter of Demi Moore rounded out her look with a set of black trainers, and she accessorized with a black leather handbag.</p>

<p>Hidden within a thick beige sack strapped across her body was tiny dog who poked its head out while she walked a larger pooch on a leash. </p>

<p>Bonus pup: The singer and occasional actress wore a black tank top with high-waisted black shorts and matching trainers. She carried one tiny dog in a sack over her shoulders</p>

<p>Seeing the sights: Rumer posed with her larger dog in front of a picturesque tunnel under a hill. 'Took my Beasty on an Adventure,' she wrote</p>

<p>Rumer's friend Allie also rocked a sporty look with a gray–blue tank top, green leggings and a baseball cap.</p>

<p>Neither woman wore a mask or even had one around their necks, though they both practiced social distancing and steered clear of other hikers. </p>

<p>Later in the day, Rumer shared a picturesque snap from her hike to her Instagram.</p>

<p>She looked nonchalant as she posed in front of a tunnel running under a hill while her dog joined her at her side.</p>

<p>'Took my Beasty on an Adventure,' she captioned the picture.</p>

<p>New beau? Rumer's outing came after she was spotted grabbing a bite with Armie Hammer on Wednesday. The masked couple were seen with their arms wrapped around each other as the left a cafe; shown in March 2019</p>

<p>Rumer has been the subject of romance rumors in recent days, after she was spotted dining out with Armie Hammer in Los Angeles on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Call Me By Your Name star had his arm wrapped around her as they left a cafe, while she inserted a hand under his thick sweater.</p>

<p>The two have kept any possible relationship quiet, though they follow each other on Instagram, and she reacted to an Instagram video of him running down a tarmac with the praise hands emoji.</p>

<p>The public outing came just weeks after Armie and his ex Elizabeth announced they were separating after 10 years of marriage and having two children together, Harper, five, and Ford, three.</p>

<p>Rumer has previously been linked to British actor Ricky Whittle, and American actors Jayson Blair and Micah Alberti. </p>
