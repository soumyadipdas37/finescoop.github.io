<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick have been spending a lot of time together this year, especially after he split from Sofia Richie, causing fans to wonder if they are back on.</p>

<p>And in the new 'supertease' for the season 19 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, which is set to return September 17, the exes are asked by Kim Kardashian if they are trying to have a fourth child. They already have Mason, Penelope and Reign.</p>

<p>And the 41-year-old POOSH founder is also seen being asked point blank if she is pregnant again to which she gives a deer-in-headlights look.</p>

<p>She spilled: Kim Kardashian states in the supertease for the next season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians that Scott Disick told her he and Kourtney are trying for a fourth child</p>

<p>This surprising question is asked toward the end of the trailer.</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian is seen in a crochet top by a swimming pool as she says, 'Scott's like we're going for baby number four, is that serious I want to know.'</p>

<p>The faces of Kourtney, Khloe and Scott are all flashed as they appear to be at a family lunch on a patio of a mansion.</p>

<p>Well is it true? Scott does not seem to say anything as Kim makes her claim</p>

<p>Uh-oh: Kourtney is like a deer in headlights as she does not want to seem to answer</p>

<p>'Are you pregnant?' another voice is heard asking Kourtney.</p>

<p>Kourtney, who has on a red shirt with her dark hair half up, looks put on the spot and not happy about it. Her answer is not heard.</p>

<p>The eldest Kardashian seems to be single, though in 2019 she was linked to ex Younes Bendjima.</p>

<p>And Scott has been single for months now.</p>

<p>Aunty Khloe shoots that look: Khloe looks up at big sister Kourtney for some information</p>

<p>So it is likely that the two may be back together. In the past, Kourtney has said she would 'love' to have another child and prays for it.</p>

<p>Kourtney and Scott started dating in 2006 after meeting at Joe Francis' house in Mexico and in 2007 he became a fixture on KUWTK.</p>

<p>In 2009 they welcomed their first child, son Mason.</p>

<p>Time to unwind: The family seems to be at their Palm Springs house as Kendall lays by the pool</p>

<p>They were on and off for years as Scott was accused many times of cheating on his partner; he also had to check into rehab more than once.</p>

<p>In 2014 she was linked to Justin Bieber, and in 2015 Kourtney pulled the plug on the relationship with Scott.</p>

<p>Disick moved on to Bella Thorne then Sofia while Kourtney spent time with Younes.</p>

<p>But by 2017, Kourtney and Scott were spending time together again during vacations as they promised to be mature about handling hand offs with the kids.</p>

<p>And in April of this year, Disick started liking old photos of Kourtney where she looked sexy. A trip to a lake this summer where she posed in a bikini caused fans to wonder if the two are back on.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the clip, Scott also discusses his recent issues, presumably referring to his stint in rehab. </p>

<p>'There couldn't have been a bigger betrayal,' Scott is heard saying, as he holds a family summit on a Zoom call.   </p>

<p>Done with rehab: Elsewhere in the clip, Scott also discusses his recent issues, presumably referring to his stint in rehab</p>

<p>Interestingly, Rob Kardashian can be seen on the Zoom call, proving that the reclusive family member is now well and truly back on the show. </p>

<p>The 33-year-old sock designer recently posted a selfie to Instagram saying 'we back' and it appears that he is planning to be a more active member of the family when it comes to appearing on their show. </p>

<p>Also in the new trailer, Khloe has a tense conversation with her on/off boyfriend Tristan Thompson, with whom she shares two-year-old daughter True.</p>

<p>Rob is on the bottom right: Interestingly, Rob Kardashian can be seen on the Zoom call, proving that the reclusive family member is now well and truly back on the show</p>

<p>Hard for him: 'There couldn't have been a bigger betrayal,' Scott is heard saying</p>

<p>It appears as though Khloe, 36, and Tristan, 29, - who are now back on - are discussing what went wrong in their relationship, which first broke down after he allegedly cheated on her. </p>

<p>She states clearly that he is very kind to her but then when he gets what he wants, he goes back to his old cheating ways.  </p>

<p>It then transpires that Khloe had a coronavirus scare as she is seen getting tested for COVID-19, before we see footage of her coughing in her bedroom.</p>

<p>Kim expresses her concern on a family call to Kourtney saying that Khloe has been 'so sick.'</p>

<p>Summit: Khloe, 36, is seen hashing out her relationship issues with Tristan, 29, at her home in Los Angeles</p>

<p>Good listener: Tristan appears to be interested in giving the relationship a second chance in the clip</p>

<p>Scare: But Khloe also gives sister Kim, 39, a worry over her health in the dramatic new scenes</p>

<p>'Everybody in the world is talking about coronavirus,' Scott says as we see Khloe get a swab test by a doctor. </p>

<p>The drama really starts to escalate when the cameras show footage of Kim's trip to Paris, France, just as lockdown started to get enforced earlier this year. </p>

<p>Season 19 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres this Thursday, September 17 at 8pm ET/PT on E! and as previously announced, Season 20/The Final Season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians will air in early 2021. </p>

<p>Scare: Khloe is seen coughing in her bed fearing she may have caught the virus</p>

<p>Worry: Kim chats with sister Kourtney on FaceTime about Khloe's health</p>

<p>Check up: Khloe is then seen getting a COVID-19 test by a medical professional</p>

<p>Sliding into a new season like...: The show returns Thursday, Sep. 17 at 8 p.m. on E!</p>
