<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is wanted by West Brom and Leeds United as interest intensifies for the 20-year-old.</p>

<p>Crystal Palace had been leading the chase for the England U21 international but with the Selhurst Park club prioritising the signing of Michy Batshuayi from Chelsea, as revealed by Sportsmail, it means they can't add another loan from the same club.</p>

<p>Chelsea intend to give Gallagher a new contract once he returns from international duty and then allow him out for a season in the Premier League and there are no shortage of takers. </p>

<p>Batshuayi spent half-a-season on loan at Crystal Palace, where he scored seven goals in total</p>

<p>Batshuayi, 26, is expected to sign a one-year extension to his current contract at Stamford Bridge and then re-join Palace for the season.</p>

<p>Batshuayi’s existing Chelsea deal expires next summer and the additional 12 months will ensure he does not become a free agent once his loan expires. </p>

<p>After impressing last season in the Championship with Charlton and Swansea City, Chelsea want him to continue to progress so are keen for him have regular game time wherever he ends up.</p>

<p>Leeds staked their claim for him early this summer but West Brom sporting director Luke Dowling is a confirmed admirer and has pushed his club's case particularly now that Palace are out of the equation.</p>

<p>Albion, who signed Callum Robinson on a permanent deal from Sheffield United on Tuesday, are also in the hunt for Watford striker Andre Gray.</p>
