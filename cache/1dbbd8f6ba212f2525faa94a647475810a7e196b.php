<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fulham have moved to hijack Crystal Palace's swoop for Brentford attacker Said Benrahma.</p>

<p>The Eagles are advanced in their move for the Algeria international, but are yet to close a deal.</p>

<p>But west London rivals Fulham have now entered the race to land Benrahma - who was widely recognised as the best attacking player in the Championship last season.</p>

<p>Said Benrahma (l) celebrates after completing his hat-trick in the 3-0 win over Wigan Athletic</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands representatives from the Craven Cottage club have been in touch with the player's advisors for an update on the status of Benrahma's protracted move to Palace, with a view to launching their own swoop.</p>

<p>Brentford value Benrahma close to £30million - a fee a number of clubs have been reluctant to meet.</p>

<p>His future will become clearer in the coming days, but there is no immediate rush to complete the deal before the October 5 transfer deadline. </p>

<p>Benrahma can still complete his move to the top flight during an additional window for EFL transfers, which closes on October 11.  </p>

<p>Fulham defeated Brentford 2-1 in the Championship play-off final as Benrahma had an off day</p>

<p>The 25-year-old's sensational 2019-20 season saw Benrahma score 17 goals in 46 matches, including hat-tricks against Hull City and Wigan Athletic.</p>

<p>The former Nice man had fans of Premier League clubs sitting up and taking notice during a campaign in which he also notched up eight assists. </p>

<p>Despite their free-flowing football, Brentford ultimately came up just short in their quest for promotion, losing 2-1 to Fulham in the Championship play-off final last month.</p>
