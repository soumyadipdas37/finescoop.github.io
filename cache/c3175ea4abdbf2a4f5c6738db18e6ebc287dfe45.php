<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the shocking moment an aggressive crow swooped down from its perch towards a terrified woman and chased her into her house.</p>

<p>Luke and Tiffany Markovich, both 31, were returning to their home in Sheffield Village, Ohio, with armfuls of groceries when the bird attacked.</p>

<p>A camera on the house shows Luke and Tiffany approaching the house only to see the crow perched above them on the roof.</p>

<p>An aggressive crow swoops down at Tiffany Markovich, 31, as she returned home with her husband Luke </p>

<p>In the video, Luke is heard saying: 'Oh my Gosh, what the heck?'</p>

<p>Clearly uneasy, Tiffany backs away from the house and keeps her distance while Luke unlocks the front door.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when Luke steps away the bird decides to swoop down at Tiffany who screams and tries to run away.</p>

<p>In mid-air the bird turns round and starts to follow her before landing on a wooden banister and starting to shriek at the homeowners.</p>

<p>Tiffany falls over as she tries to flee from the bird and drops her groceries before she and Luke escape into the house, leaving the shrieking bird and all of their groceries outside.</p>

<p>As Tiffany tries to run away screaming from the shrieking crow she falls over and drops her groceries on the floor</p>

<p>Forgetting her dropped groceries and with the crow swinging round in the air to continue the chase, Tiffany and Luke run inside to the safety of their house</p>

<p>Despite falling over when being chased, Tiffany did not suffer any injuries.</p>

<p>The threatening crow had already attacked several neighbors, including a young boy, which had earned it a bad reputation.</p>

<p>Despite reports of bird attacks rising in recent years, crows are not able to injure humans the same way that larger birds like hawks and owls can.</p>

<p>In most cases crows will only attack if they’re defending space, food sources or their recently fledged young.</p>

<p>Their attacks are meant to be a deterrent to make life difficult rather than as a physical assault. </p>
