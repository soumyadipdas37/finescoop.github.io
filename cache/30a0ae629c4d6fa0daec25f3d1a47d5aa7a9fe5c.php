<p>The Wrecking Ball hitmaker said she remains friends with the Australian singer, who she has known for a decade. </p>

<p>Referencing her split from ex-husband Liam Hemsworth in August last year, Miley began: 'A year ago, almost to this exact date, the media tried to tell my story for me, and control my narrative, and I'm just not accepting that. </p>

<p>'So today, it came out that me and my boyfriend have broken up,' she added.</p>

<p>She continued:'It was confirmed by a "reliable source" even though no one is reliable in a relationship except the individuals who are participating in it.</p>

<p>Out and about: Cody looked stylish in a black T-shirt, blue shorts and a pair of camo print sneakers for the outing</p>

<p>'But right now, two halves can't make a whole and we're individually just working on ourselves to become the people that we wanna be, like everybody else at this age.' </p>

<p>Miley added: 'We are just deciding who we wanna be in our lives, what we wanna do, and so don't make it some drama story if next week we're hanging out, getting pizza.</p>

<p>'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not.'</p>

<p>The couple began dating in September 2019, shortly after Miley had ended her fling with U.S. reality star Kaitlynn Carter.</p>

<p>She was previously married to actor Liam Hemsworth, but they separated in August last year after just seven months of marriage.</p>
