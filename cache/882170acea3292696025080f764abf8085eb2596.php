<p>Scenes flash of SZA dancing with her crew, to being solo in a baggy tee shirt outfit on hay bales, then to seductively posing in the back of a truck being lifted into the air, and finally to being covered in red paint in a barn and field. </p>

<p>The song continues to follow the singers as they contemplate their respective love interests, though it can be painful. </p>
