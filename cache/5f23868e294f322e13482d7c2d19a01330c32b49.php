<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>He left fans swooning on The Bachelor last year, but Matt Agnew has swapped his 'hot scientist' look for a more laid-back style in recent months.</p>

<p>Like many Melburnians living under stage-four lockdown, the 33-year-old astrophysicist has embraced a low-maintenance approach to grooming of late.</p>

<p>The reality star showcased his stubble and smile lines in a selfie shared to Instagram last week to raise awareness of mental health charity R U OK?</p>

<p>The Bachelor doesn't look like this anymore! Astrophysicist Matt Agnew left fans stunned last week when he debuted his laid-back new look. Pictured as The Bachelor last year</p>

<p>Fans of The Bachelor would be forgiven for not recognising Matt without his signature 'geeky' glasses, clean-cut look and sharp tuxedo.</p>

<p>The data scientist nonetheless looked handsome with five o'clock shadow and a grey beanie as he drew attention to a worthwhile cause. </p>

<p>Matt's followers remarked on his changing appearance in the comments section of another recent Instagram photo.</p>

<p>Low-maintenance: The 33-year-old reality star showcased his stubble and smile lines in an Instagram selfie as he raised awareness of mental health charity R U OK?</p>

<p>'Gezzzz, you have changed. You don't look the same,' one wrote, while another added: 'You look different today.' </p>

<p>However, those familiar with Matt's journey over the past few years will know that he has always preferred a more relaxed style.</p>

<p>He liked to keep things casual during his pre-Bachelor days as a university academic, with photos from that period showing him looking quite pedestrian compared to the Mills &amp; Boon-esque leading man he was portrayed as on TV.</p>

<p>The way he was: Fans of The Bachelor would be forgiven for not recognising Matt without his signature 'geeky' glasses, clean-cut look and sharp tuxedo</p>

<p>Keeping it simple: Like many Melburnians living under stage-four lockdown, the data scientist has embraced a low-maintenance approach to grooming of late</p>

<p>Matt chose 28-year-old chemical engineer Chelsie McLeod as his winner on The Bachelor last year, but their relationship didn't last.</p>

<p>The couple confirmed their split two months after the finale airdate, and Chelsie later hinted it wasn't her decision to end things.</p>

<p>One of Matt's contestants, Elly Miles, is the new Bachelorette. She is being joined on her journey by her sister, Becky.</p>
