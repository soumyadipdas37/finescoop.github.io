<p>Matt told The Sydney Morning Herald he fully understands his mother's struggles and also gushed about his joy at being a stay-at-home dad.   </p>

<p>'I've been able to be the stay-at-home dad and get to know my daughter. It's been quite amazing,' he told the publication.</p>

<p>The doting parent also spoke about his own upbringing. </p>

<p>His parental instinct is so strong that Matt admitted he gets a 'knot in his stomach' whenever he leaves Marlie-Mae's room after checking in on her during the night. </p>

<p>'I feel very emotional as a dad. I was always that guy who noticed other dads in the park playing with their kids long before I had my own child.' </p>

<p>Trio: 'Getting to know my daughter': Matty also gushed about his joy at being a stay-at-home dad</p>

<p>Matty and Laura became engaged with Matty J in April 2019. </p>

<p>The pair first met on season five of The Bachelor in 2017, and welcomed their daughter Marlie-May in June last year. </p>

<p>Speaking on the So Dramatic podcast, Matty recently clarified a common question he gets asked, which is if the Bachelor gets to choose which girls he dates and who goes home.</p>

<p>'That decision is entirely at the hands of The Bachelor. You get to pick exactly which girls you go on dates with, and who stays and who goes home.</p>

<p>'Even the order of the rose ceremony. It is up to you. He decides everything, it's all up to him.'</p>
