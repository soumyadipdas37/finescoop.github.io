<p>One of her 9.7million Instagram followers asked a bold question in the comment section: 'Are you pregnant?'</p>

<p>The Alias star responded: 'I am 48, have three healthy kids, and am not—and never will be—pregnant. We can lay that pupper to rest. Have a gained the Covid 19? Possibly. But that is another story.'</p>

<p>Garner posted a tribute to educators earlier this month on Instagram, writing: 'Thank you for the gifts and lessons of this summer. God bless teachers, faculty and administrators as they guide us through this big question mark of a school year.</p>

<p>'Bless the parents trying to make it all work. And the children who are learning to make the best of things in ways we couldn’t have predicted. Help us remember we hold each other in our hands. And please God, preserve our collective sense of humor. Amen.' </p>
