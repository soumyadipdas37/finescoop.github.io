<p>Partying: Davinia was famed for her position in the notorious Primrose Hill party set, where she joined her then-husband Dave Gardner in partying through the Nineties with pals including Kate Moss, Sadie Frost and Jude Law</p>

<p>At the time, she said of the home: ‘It’s breathtaking, I designed it myself. It’s next door to our family home out there – Antonio Banderas is a neighbour. ‘It was going to be our family home in the sun but it’s a bit indulgent to have another house there now I’m on my own. I’m just tying up everything since the divorce'. </p>

<p>Davinia's spot in the dazzling showbiz crown was cemented in sumer 2003, when David Beckham was best man when she and Dave - who now has two children with the actress Liv Tyler - exchanged vows in a lavish Cheshire ceremony while Victoria Beckham was among the guests. </p>

<p>Having gone into recovery from alcoholism, she enjoyed an overhauled lifestyle since her move to Spain, as she has turned her back on wild nights in favour of daily workouts in the gym and a diet of green smoothies washed down with charcoal water, all of which is documented on her Instagram.</p>

<p>The heiress and former soap actress has endured dark days previously, having battled both alcoholism and a bout of post-natal depression she's described as a 'really dark hole' from which she struggled to climb out. </p>

<p>In 2018, she revealed the humiliation of losing custody of her son Grey to ex Dave in 2010 was the catalyst to keeping her sober. She discussed her battle with post-natal depression and how she was convinced she would be dead if she had not sought help for her demons.</p>

<p>In 2010, Davinia's ‘unreasonable behaviour’ was cited as grounds for divorce from David, who was awarded a settlement in the region of £1million, before he was awarded custody of Grey, who she could reportedly see every other weekend. Subsequently, David went on holiday to the U.S. for almost a month with Grey - leading to Davinia's downward spiral.</p>

<p>Gated community: She had stunning beach views in the house </p>

<p>She said: 'That humiliation to be honest that spurred me on to keep sober and keep on the program... that was a catalyst that took me into the depths of depression, the support I received was monumental...</p>

<p>'I think I would be dead... Professional help, and support of people who've already been there. It’s normally so quiet and hush hush for people to speak out and say: "I've had post-natal depression" and as clear as day I went into a massive deep hole and couldn't get out.'</p>

<p>In the aftermath of their messy divorce, she said: ‘It’s been the worst and longest drawn-out experience I’ve ever had. I just want him to move out and move on.</p>

<p>'I wish I’d heard about quickie divorce packs from Tesco sooner. Before I went into this I thought there was such as a thing as a quickie divorce, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.’</p>
