<p>Dolly added: 'He doesn't get involved in my business, and I don't in his, so we have our little world that we create for ourselves.'</p>

<p>The Jolene singer said: 'I've always made jokes that the reason our marriage has lasted so long is because I stay gone. Well, there is a lot of truth in that. We're not in each other's face all the time.' </p>

<p>'I think there's a lot to be said about having sensible separation because you can't be with somebody 24/7, 365 and not want to smack their face now and then,' Dolly said.</p>

<p>Dolly added they never fought, explaining that if they are upset, they walk away from each other to cool down.</p>

<p>She said: 'We've never bickered back and forth because I never wanted us to say bad things that we would have to remember. We get a little pissy now and then, but we'll just kind of walk off or go do something else and let that die down.'</p>

<p>Explaining: 'You have to work at anything. Marriage is a business too, and you got to look at it like that. You got to make the right decisions for all the little thing that come up.'</p>

<p>Dolly told Gabby that the first year of marriage is 'probably the hardest,' because 'you are trying to figure each other out and learn. That's the year that you get the most rubbed wrong only because you're having to share space with somebody you've never had to share your space with before.'</p>

<p>'Your habits are different than theirs so you got to work those little things out. It's best just to go to the other room rather than getting in a big old argument about it, cool off and know they're just entitled to their opinion and their space as you are yours.'</p>
