<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ann Summers's boss has threatened its landlords with store closures in a bid to force them to slash rents.</p>

<p>The lingerie chain said it would resort to a controversial insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cut its costs if landlords did not agree to reduced rents based on turnover.</p>

<p>The owning family said it had already injected 'large sums' of cash 'to get Ann Summers back on an even footing'. </p>

<p>Ann Summers's chief executive Jacqueline Gold  has threatened its landlords with store closures in a bid to force them to slash rents</p>

<p>The firm's losses spiralled from £3million to £16million in 2018-19, but bosses said its bottom line will improve this year thanks to investment, and more demand for lingerie during lockdown.</p>

<p>Chief executive Jacqueline Gold said: 'Ultimately, no retailer can afford to run stores unprofitably. It's a shame we have to threaten a CVA in order to do this, but this is no idle threat.'</p>

<p>The threat to launch a CVA will cause anger as the insolvency procedure is meant to be reserved for companies in serious distress. </p>

<p>This week the British Property Federation (BPF) criticised the way CVAs are being 'weaponised' by retailers to slash costs.</p>
