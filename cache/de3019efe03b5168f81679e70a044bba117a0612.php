<p>Bid her farewell: My 600-lb Life star Coliesa McMillian's (M) family were reportedly allowed to visit her at a Louisiana hospital before her death last Tuesday, at age 41, from 'complications' of weight loss surgery months ago </p>

<p>And while Courville is unclear of the exact cause of death, an East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office rep told the site McMillian 'died of natural causes.'</p>

<p>Audiences got to know the obese mother-of-four six months earlier when she appeared in the eighth season of the show.</p>

<p>At the time of filming, Coliesa weighed 643lbs and had already suffered a heart attack that was made much more severe as a result of her obesity and doctors were unable to correct the damage done to her heart because her weight made it impossible to operate.</p>

<p>Coliesa's family revealed that she had passed away on in a heartbreaking Facebook post that read: 'I cannot begin to express into words what our family is beginning to feel.</p>

<p>RIP: The TLC reality star's mother Sadie Courville told TMZ on Monday that they were unable to visit her 'for quite a while' due to COVID-19 restrictions at the Baton Rouge facility </p>

<p>Sad: But once it was clear that Coliesa was on her deathbed, her two teenage daughters were able to hold her hands and say their final goodbyes </p>

<p>'Tonight at 10:23 she sadly passed away from this life. We are asking that you please respect us. Thank you.'</p>

<p>In another comment, the unnamed family member added: 'She had health problems from her surgery and it just ended her life.'</p>

<p>Coliesa's family revealed in June that she had been put on life support and had 'almost died' after suffering severe complications from her weight loss surgery.</p>

<p>At the time, her family noted that it would be 'a very long and difficult road ahead,' however they shared their excitement at her return home after so long.</p>

<p>Cause of death: And while Courville is unclear of the exact cause of death, an East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office rep told the site McMillian 'died of natural causes'</p>

<p>'I know I won't survive another heart attack unless I lose weight': Audiences got to know the obese mother-of-four six months earlier when she appeared in the eighth season of the show</p>

<p>'She stayed in Houston for a few weeks,' the post read.</p>

<p>'Even though she has been on a long journey she has an even longer journey to go. She is a fighter. She is now confined to a bed 24/7. And is in a lot of pain. She can not do anything like she used to. But she is there.'</p>

<p>However in August, the family hinted that Coliesa's health had taken a turn for the worst, revealing that she was back in hospital.</p>

<p>Shortly after the news of her mother's death was revealed, Coliesa's daughter Hannah shared a touching tribute to her on Facebook - while also writing sweet words about Coliesa's late fiance, who died in a car crash shortly before she filmed the TLC show.</p>

<p>Update: In June, Coliesa's family revealed that she had returned home after facing a tough health battle after her weight loss surgery</p>

<p>Somber: One of her daughters, Hannah, shared a tribute to her mother on Facebook</p>

<p>'Now y'all together,' she wrote while sharing a picture of Coliesa and her fiance together. 'These two my guardian angels. Imma miss you mom I already do!'</p>

<p>She had a heart attack at the age of 39 and was 'too big to do surgery on' when she was taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>'I know I won't survive another heart attack unless I lose weight,' Coliesa said during a clip from her show.</p>
