<p>'It was the first one-man show he had created, and he wanted to give the audience something to remember. Nick created a night of music and storytelling that was extremely personal too. It is a mix of Broadway, rock 'n' roll, standards and original music and, if you knew Nick, it was perfect!'</p>

<p>Guest performers on the album include Kathryn Gallagher (Jagged Little Pill), Drew Gehling (Waitress), Sara Chase (First Date), and Zach Braff (Bullets Over Broadway).</p>

<p>All proceeds from Live Your Life will benefit Kloots and their 15-month-old son Elvis Eduardo, who both rocked out to the record on Thursday.</p>
