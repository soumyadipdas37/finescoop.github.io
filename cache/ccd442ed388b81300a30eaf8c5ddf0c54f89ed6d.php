<p>A savvy and innovative Australian home cook has revealed how she made spiced barbecue pork crackle straw chips using her three-in-one Kmart air fryer</p>

<p>Sara, from Melbourne, shared the ground-breaking recipe to a popular cookery Facebook group where she was praised by others online</p>

<p>'My favourite part of a pork roast; finding out you can buy the crackle alone was probably a dangerous thing,' she wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>'This accidental discovery was a game changer when I saw it at Coles last year.'  </p>

<p>To make the crackling, Sara used 500 grams of pork skin, sea salt, olive oil and made her own spice rub to season the meat.</p>

<p>She mixed paprika, garlic powder, mustard powder, onion salt, dried oregano and cayenne pepper in a bowl to coat onto the pork strips.</p>

<p>While the recipe is detailed and involves ten steps, it's quite simple to follow and takes between 45 minutes to an hour to complete.</p>

<p>When making the crackling chips, Sara said it's important to sprinkle the skin side up with salt and place in the fridge to dry out for at least 15 to 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Once the skin is dry, wipe off any moisture and salt and slice in to one-inch strips.</p>

<p>Then mix the spices together, brush the pork strips with olive oil and sprinkle the barbecue rub on top.</p>

<p>Sara cooked the strips in the air fryer for 12 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>To prevent the crackle from curling, she laid spare mesh trays directly on top of the pork skin.  </p>

<p>'Might have to give this a crack,' one man said.</p>

<p>'Look sensational and what fabulous pictorial instructions - definitely ten out of ten,' a woman said.</p>

<p>Other foodies tagged friends in the post and said it looks 'so delicious' they are eager to make the pork crackling chips themselves. </p>

<p>INGREDIENTS</p>

<ul>
<li><p>500g Pork skin (from supermarket or butcher)</p></li>
<li><p>Sea salt</p></li>
<li><p>Olive oil</p></li>
</ul>

<p>BBQ SPICE RUB/SPRINKLE</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 tsp paprika</p></li>
<li><p>1 tsp garlic powder</p></li>
<li><p>1 tsp onion salt</p></li>
<li><p>1/2 tsp mustard powder</p></li>
<li><p>1/4 tsp dried oregano</p></li>
<li><p>1/8 tsp cayenne pepper </p></li>
</ul>

<p>METHOD</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Unroll pork, sprinkle skin side up with salt and place in fridge to dry out (as long as possible, but ideally at least 15 to 30mins)</p></li>
<li><p>Remove skin from fridge, wipe off drawn out moisture and salt from skin, and slice/cut into one-inch strips (will shrink when cooked)</p></li>
<li><p>Blend all spices in a small bowl with a fork until mixed and set aside</p></li>
<li><p>Very lightly brush pork skin side up with olive oil and lay edge to edge on 2 x air fryer mesh trays (pork will shrink/retract as it cooks)</p></li>
<li><p>Sprinkle skin very generously with salt, followed with a light sprinkle of bbq spice mix (1/2 the mix)</p></li>
<li><p>Place both pork skin trays in the air fryer and then lay the third spare mesh tray directly on top of the top tray of pork skin (TIP: this holds the skin in place and prevents the crackle curling).</p></li>
<li><p>Cook for 12mins on 200 degrees Celsius, then remove trays and swap top and bottom (top cooks faster), again placing the third tray directly onto the top tray of crackle</p></li>
<li><p>Drain drip tray (there will be a LOT of oil released from the skin), then return pork crackle trays to the air fryer and cook for another ten to 15 minutes on 200 degrees Celsius, checking periodically until cooked through and 'crackled' to satisfaction</p></li>
</ol>

<p>*NOTE: Cooking time required may vary based on thickness of the skin/amount of fat etc.</p>

<ol start="9">
<li><p>Remove trays and allow crackle to cool slightly, then 'tap' each piece one by one to remove excess salt and cooked/charred spice mix into a bowl (discard salt/spice)</p></li>
<li><p>Take remaining unused BBQ spice blend and sprinkle on skin/crackle side, then enjoy</p></li>
</ol>
