<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A new book has revealed how Zlatan Ibrahimovic clashed with Sweden team-mates throughout his international career, including before his incredible four-goal salvo against England in 2012.</p>

<p>The Swedish superstar stole the show during a 4-2 friendly win in Stockholm, scoring an infamous long-range bicycle kick.</p>

<p>But the buildup to the game was far from ideal, with new revelations that the AC Milan striker told his team-mates: 'What the hell am I playing in this f****** national team for?'.</p>

<p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored an incredible overhead kick for Sweden against England in 2012</p>

<p>The stunning goal capped an incredible four-goal display from the veteran striker</p>

<p>The book, written by Swedish journalist Olof Lundh, details how Ibrahimovic went to war with his compatriots at half-time during the friendly. </p>

<p>Sweden found themselves 2-1 down at the interval, and Rasmus Elm allegedly found himself at the end of a verbal volley from Ibrahimovic.</p>

<p>An excerpt claims: 'Zlatan was terribly hard on Rasmus and broke him down even though he tried to respond. Hamren (manager, Erik) just stood by the side and finally he said: "Rasmus, now that's enough". </p>

<p>'There, Hamren lost many players and also those who were close to him.'</p>

<p>A new book claims that Ibrahimovic had clashed with his team-mates before the wondergoal</p>

<p>The book claims that Ibrahimovic was treated differently to other players, which caused irritation throughout the squad.</p>

<p>One player reveals: 'When I arrived five minutes late, I was told, "Where the hell have you been?" If Zlatan arrived late, there were no problems. </p>

<p>'The group accepted 100 percent that Zlatan had a little freer reins, but there must be the same rules about times for everyone and that was not the case.'</p>

<p>Ibrahimovic has not played for his country since retiring after playing at Euro 2016</p>

<p>It is alleged that there became a 'depressing culture of silence' around the side, with Zlatan surrounded by 'yes-sayers'.</p>

<p>Ibrahimovic has not played for his country since Euro 2016.</p>

<p>In a distinguished international career he scored 62 times, earning 116 caps in the process. </p>
