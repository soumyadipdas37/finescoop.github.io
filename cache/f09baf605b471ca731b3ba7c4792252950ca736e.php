<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Winston Groom, the writer whose novel 'Forrest Gump' was made into a six-Oscar-winning 1994 movie that became a soaring pop cultural phenomenon, has died at age 77.</p>

<p>Mayor Karin Wilson of Fairhope, Alabama, said in a message on social media that Groom had died in that south Alabama town. A local funeral home also confirmed the death and said arrangements were pending.</p>

<p>'While he will be remembered for creating Forrest Gump, Winston Groom was a talented journalist &amp; noted author of American history. Our hearts &amp; prayers are extended to his family,' Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement. </p>

<p>'Forrest Gump' was the improbable tale of a slow-witted but mathematically gifted man who was a participant or witness to key points of 20th Century history - from Alabama segregationist Gov. George Wallace's 'stand at the schoolhouse door,' to meetings with presidents.</p>

<p>Winston Groom (pictured), the novelist who wrote Forrest Gump, has died in Fairhope, Alabama, this week at the age of 77</p>

<p>Groom's best known book was Forrest Gump, a 1986 novel that was transformed into a major Hollywood movie eight years later. Pictured: Tom Hanks as the titular character Forrest Gump</p>

<p>It was the best known book by Groom, who grew up in Mobile, Alabama, and graduated from the University of Alabama in 1965, according to a biography posted by the university.</p>

<p>'We are saddened to learn of the passing of one of our Legends, Winston Groom,' the university wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>Groom served in the Army´s Fourth Infantry Division from 1965 to 1969, the university said. His service included a tour in Vietnam - one of the settings for 'Forrest Gump.'</p>

<p>He wrote 16 books, fiction and nonfiction. One, 'Conversations with the Enemy,' about a American prisoner of war in Vietnam accused of collaboration, was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, according to the university.  </p>

<p>It was 'Forrest Gump' - and the success of the 1994 movie starring Tom Hanks in the iconic role of Gump, as well as Sally Field and Gary Sinise - that earned him widespread fame and some financial success.</p>

<p>The original novel has sold at least 1.7million copies since the initial publication.  </p>

<p>Groom (pictured) was a military veteran who grew up in Mobile, Alabama, and later graduated from the University of Alabama in 1965</p>

<p>Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey wrote on Thursday that 'Alabama lost one of our most gifted writers' and credited him with being a 'talented journalist &amp; noted author of American history'</p>

<p>The University of Alabama expressed their condolences in a Twitter post following Groom's death </p>

<p>The novel is considerably different from the film. Don Noble, University of Alabama professor emeritus of English, and a 40-year friend of Groom´s told The Tuscaloosa News that the novel was 'darker' and 'richer' than the movie.</p>

<p>'You can make a lot of money as a comic writer, but you can´t get no respect,' Noble said. 'But "Forrest Gump" is really actually quite a fine novel. It´s more subtle and more complicated ... richer than the movie.'</p>

<p>The movie, which also starred Robin Wright and Mykelti Williamson, became deeply embedded in the American psyche and has remained an enduring television staple and huge cultural phenomenon since.</p>

<p>'It touched a nerve,' Groom told the Tuscaloosa News in 2014.</p>

<p>The film dominated the 1995 Academy Awards, winning six Oscars including best picture, best director for Robert Zemeckis and best actor for Hanks.</p>

<p>The film Forrest Gump garnered critical acclaim for its cast, including Sally Fields as 'Mrs. Gump' and Tom Hanks as 'Forrest Gump'</p>

<p>It was 1994´s No. 2 grossing film at the box office, second only to 'The Lion King.'</p>

<p>The basic outlines of Gump´s life are the same as they are in the book: Gump plays football under Paul 'Bear' Bryant at the University of Alabama, serves in Vietnam and starts a major shrimp business.</p>

<p>But the film made major departures. Gump was not a math savant as he was in the book, and was a more saintly soul. </p>

<p>The film took away Gump´s size - Groom said he envisioned John Goodman playing him - along with his profanity, and most of his sex life.</p>

<p>They 'took some of the rough edges off,' Groom told the New York Times in 1994.</p>

<p>Groom also wrote non-fiction on diverse subjects including the Civil War, World War I and Alabama's Crimson Tide football.</p>

<p>In 2005, Groom released '1942: The Year That Tried Men´s Souls,' which chronicled the first year of U.S. involvement in World War II.</p>

<p>In 2009 he released 'Vicksburg 1863,' an account of the Union siege that brought a novelist´s touch to historical figures like Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman and Jefferson Davis, president of the confederacy.</p>

<p>His most recent novel, El Paso, was published in 2016.</p>

<p>Groom got $350,000 for the rights to 'Forrest Gump' plus 3 percent of the net profit of the movie. But he got into a serious dispute with Paramount Pictures when they told him a film that had earned over $600 million was in the red after expenses.</p>

<p>But years later he wasn´t bitter.</p>

<p>'They did an excellent job,' he told the Tuscaloosa News. 'I would have probably preferred my version of it, but that thing never would have opened.'</p>

<p>The book became a major best-seller in the wake of the film, and Groom got a much better deal for the follow-up novel, 1995´s 'Gump and Co.'</p>

<p>'I´m happy as a pig in sunshine,' he told the Mobile Register.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, sequel-addicted Hollywood somehow never made the new movie.</p>
