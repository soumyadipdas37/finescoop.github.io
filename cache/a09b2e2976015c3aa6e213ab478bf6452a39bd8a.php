<p>Footage captured by Tammy Sattler, 25, from Lapeer, Michigan, shows her Australian Shepherd Dog Leia get more than she had bargained for as she is chased by the bird named Duke.  </p>

<p>The canine runs around a stack of wooden pallets as the rooster follows close behind her and tries to ward it away from his territory.</p>

<p>The Australian Shepherd Dog Leia stares at Duke the rooster after getting too close to his chicken coop in Lapeer, Michigan</p>

<p>The canine runs around a stack of wooden pallets with the rooster following close behind her</p>

<p>During the clip, the rooster waits for Leia to make a move before running after the dog.</p>

<p>The startled dog immediately changes direction as Duke follows close behind her.</p>

<p>As the rooster begins to slow down, Leia approaches the bird and playfully rushes past him, causing it to run after the canine once more.</p>

<p>As the comical events unfold, Ms Sattler roars with laughter and shouts: 'Run Leia run!' </p>

<p>She said: 'It started on Saturday 29th August. I heard a commotion and I saw Leia run out of the chicken coop as fast as she could with Duke close behind her. She had got too close to his ladies.</p>

<p>'The next day we were in the pool at home and I walked over to where the chickens were at and I saw Leia was watching them again.</p>

<p>'She started picking on the rooster and he began to chase her. I ran and got my phone and started recording.'</p>

<p>Ms Sattler said Duke continued to run after Leia for nearly ten minutes before eventually calling an end to the game of chase.</p>

<p>She added: 'Leia loves to sit and watch the chickens but this weekend was the first time we let them interact without a fence in between them.</p>

<p>Leia (pictured with Ms Sattler), had been too close to the chicken coop when Duke the rooster decided to chase after the dog</p>

<p>Ms Sattler said Leia (pictured watching the ducks) continued running away from the rooster for ten minutes</p>

<p>'I honestly think Duke was mad but it was all a game to her (Leia). He would attack her but she didn't care. She just kept running.</p>

<p>'After I stopped filming we told Leia she was a good girl for not eating Duke!</p>

<p>'Then we all got out of the pool but she was still interested in him.</p>

<p>'I saw her a few minutes later being chased yet again. She was having so much fun with that dang rooster. </p>

<p>'We all thought it was hilarious! We had never seen her do this before. She didn't want to hurt him at all.</p>

<p>'When my ducks were little, She always loved watching them.</p>

<p>'We have two rats and she is obsessed with watching them too.</p>

<p>'She won't let my cats near their cage. She shoos then away if they get too close. She's very protective. She is always very sweet.' </p>
