<p>The presenter, 35, died instantly of her injuries following the collision in Battersea, south London last July.</p>

<p>Ms Hartridge was on her way to a fertility clinic when she tragically became the first person in the UK to have been involved in a fatal crash on an e-scooter.</p>

<p>At an inquest held remotely at Westminster Coroner's Court due to the coronavirus pandemic, Dr Fiona Wilcox concluded that her death was accidental.</p>

<p>YouTube star Emily Hartridge was riding an e-scooter too fast with an underinflated tyre when she was killed in a crash with a lorry, a coroner has ruled</p>

<p>The presenter, 35, died instantly of her injuries following the collision in Battersea, south London last July</p>

<p>In notes seen by the BBC, she wrote: 'Ms Hartridge was riding an electric scooter on Queenstown Road when she lost control after passing over an inspector hatch in the cycle lane and was thrown under the path of an HGV.</p>

<p>'She died instantly of injuries sustained by the HGV driving over her.</p>

<p>'The scooter was being unsuitably driven, too fast and with an underinflated tyre and this caused the loss of control and her death.'</p>

<p>At the time, e-scooters were illegal to rise in the UK other than on private land with permission, but the were given the green light by the Department for Transport earlier this year to help cut down on congestion on public transport amid the Covid crisis.</p>

<p>The new rules state the vehicles can't be ridden on pavements, are limited to a speed of 15.5mph and that helmets should be worn.  </p>

<p>Grieving boyfriend Jacob Hazell said last year he and the presenter - who he described as the 'most beautiful woman in the world' - were overcome with excitement as they planned for a baby. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old said everything in their lives was 'going right'. </p>

<p>But in a heart wrenching interview, he recalled his creeping sense of dread when the clinic said Ms Hartridge had failed to turn up to the appointment. </p>

<p>And he revealed his anxiety then turned into devastation after stumbling across the news that his girlfriend had died in a collision with a lorry in Battersea on Friday 12 July.</p>

<p>YouTube star Emily Hartridge, 35, lost her life nine days ago in a collision with a lorry as she circled the roundabout while riding an e-scooter bought for her by her boyfriend Jacob Hazell, 28, as a birthday present less than a week before</p>

<p>Mr Hazell has said that he and the 35-year-old - who he described as the 'most beautiful woman in the world' - were hooked with excitement as they planned for a baby and that she was on her way to a fertility clinic when she was killed</p>

<p>The social media star's tragic death is thought to be the first involving an e-scooter, but mourning Mr Hazell does not believe the vehicles should be banned</p>

<p>'I am devastated. I got up first to leave home at 5am. I gave her a kiss on the lips. She was half asleep and mumbled, 'I love you'. I'm so pleased I did that,' Mr Hazell told the Sun.   </p>

<p>In her YouTube vlogs, Ms Hartridge would often speak candidly about her and Mr Hazell's parenthood plans and had previously revealed she was getting her eggs frozen.</p>

<p>However, as Ms Hartridge was on her way to the take the next steps towards pregnancy, she was tragically killed on a roundabout in what is believed to be the UK's first ever e-scooter accident.</p>

<p>And although Mr Hazell is still raw from the horrific crash and in mourning, he has revealed that some people have blamed him for his girlfriend's death.</p>

<p>The personal trainer said: 'People have told me I'm to blame because I bought it for her, but I can't think that. Her family have told me I'm not.' </p>

<p>Mr Hazell said that when he first presented Ms Hartridge with the vehicle she was 'over the moon' but 'knew the risks' and would always wear a helmet.    </p>

<p>He also said he does not think the vehicles should be banned, despite the accident leaving a 'hole' in his life.</p>

<p>He said: 'We had just moved in together and were planning a family. I'm heartbroken she has gone...</p>

<p>'I don't think they should be banned for adults, as they are electric, go a maximum of 20mph and don't do any harm to the environment.'         </p>

<p>In an emotional video posted on Instagram last week, Mr Hartridge paid tribute to his late partner and thanked fans for their support. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old fights back tears as he says: 'I know Emily was the person who encouraged me to talk about how I was feeling I just want to put a video out here to say thank you and let people know I'm okay.</p>

<p>'I love you all and I love Emily and I appreciate the support, so thank you.'</p>

<p>In a recent online post, Ms Hartridge gushed she and Mr Hazell were hoping to start a family together, adding: 'Jake is incredible and I feel beyond grateful to have him in my life.'  </p>

<p>'That made me feel so nice, literally my hairs were standing up on end from that. I do waste a lot of time worrying about things that I have no control over.</p>
