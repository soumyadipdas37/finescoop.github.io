<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool scored a comfortable 2-0 victory over 10-man Chelsea on Sunday to preserve their 100 per cent record in the Premier League after two games. </p>

<p>Things fell apart for the Blues after the break after Andreas Christensen's sending off for a clumsy challenge on Sadio Mane, with the Senegalese star firing in a double after the restart.   </p>

<p>Sportsmail's Dominic King gives his verdict on each player's performance at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>Liverpool ran-out 2-0 winners against Chelsea on Sunday, led by the magnificent Sadio Mane</p>

<p>CHELSEA </p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga: Dreadful mistake led to Liverpool's second goal and played like a man who knows his time at the club is up - 4</p>

<p>Reece James: Tough afternoon trying to contain the raids of Mane and Robertson but never let his head drop - 6</p>

<p>Andreas Christensen: His attempt to halt Mane would not have looked out of place at Twickenham; had to be sent off - 4</p>

<p>Andreas Christensen gave Chelsea an uphill battle after his clumsy tackled earned a red card</p>

<p>Kurt Zouma: Arguably the best of Chelsea's defence and threw himself into the challenge of trying to shackle Firmino - 6</p>

<p>Marcos Alonso: Turned inside out by Salah and Firmino for Liverpool's first goal and once again showed why Ben Chilwell has been recruited - 5  </p>

<p>N'Golo Kante: Solid first 45 minutes but ended up chasing shadows in the second as Liverpool dominated possession - 5.5</p>

<p>Jorginho: Only a matter of time before his hop, skip and jump failed from 12 yards and this was it - 5 </p>

<p>N'Golo Kante couldn't save Chelsea after they went down to 10-men against the champions</p>

<p>Mateo Kovacic: Like the rest of his colleagues, never got close to laying a glove on Liverpool's midfield and was eventually replaced - 5 </p>

<p>Mason Mount: Great attitude, had a fine effort that dropped onto the roof of the net and never stopped working - 6.5</p>

<p>Kai Havertz: Can consider himself unlucky to have been the fall guy for the tactical reshuffle following Christiansen's red card - 6 </p>

<p>Timo Werner: Best player in Blue and always at the heart of their most dangerous moments. He'll score a lot of goals - 7 </p>

<p>Kai Havertz was replaced at the break after struggling to make an impact for Lampard's men</p>

<p>MANAGER </p>

<p>Frank Lampard: At the moment he is trying to work out what his best system is; clearly some players did not fit this equation - 6 </p>

<p>LIVERPOOL </p>

<p>Alisson Becker: Has been waiting to make a big penalty save and his stop to deny Jorginho secured the win - 7 </p>

<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold: Bright and busy down the right with some fine passes but his set plays lacked their usual accuracy - 6.5 </p>

<p>Fabinho: Not often do you a Liverpool central defender outshine Virgil van Dijk but the Brazilian did so with an imperious display - 9 </p>

<p>Virgil van Dijk: Sauntered through the contest, seemed to be playing in second gear and was never in trouble - 8 </p>

<p>Virgil van Dijk bounced-back from a tough opening match with a clean-sheet on Sunday </p>

<p>Jordan Henderson's classy pass led to Christensen's red-card before he went off injured </p>

<p>Andrew Robertson: Buzzed forwards and backwards and looks to have raised his standards following signing of Kostas Tsimikas - 7.5 </p>

<p>Naby Keita: Still waiting for him to grab hold of a match of this significance and he will be under pressure following Thiago's arrival - 6</p>

<p>Jordan Henderson: Beautiful pass set Mane away for game-changing moment but never emerged in the second half due a thigh injury - 7 </p>

<p>Gini Wijnaldum: Liverpool's Mr Reliable, the only blot on his performance was missing an unexpected chance from three yards in injury time - 7.5 </p>

<p>Sadio Mane was on fire with two goals, showing his quality once more for Jurgen Klopp's men</p>

<p>Mohamed Salah: He wants the Golden Boot again and you could see he was irritated that he never increased his tally - 8 </p>

<p>Roberto Firmino: People question his goal output but he is absolutely crucial to making this Liverpool team function and proved it again - 7.5 </p>

<p>Sadio Mane: One super header, one lesson in closing down and that led to two goals to cap a marvellous display - 8.5 </p>

<p>MANAGER </p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp: Conjured a tune from his team that produced a performance that sets the standards going forward - 7 </p>

<p>REFEREE </p>

<p>Paul Tierney: Made the right call with Chelsea's penalty but it was a surprise he didn't reach for a straight red-card for Christiansen - 6 </p>
