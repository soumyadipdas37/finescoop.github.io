<p>Grey's Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff revealed during a TV Academy panel that the new season will 'address this pandemic for sure.'</p>

<p>'There’s no way to be a long-running medical show and not do the medical story of our lifetimes,' Vernoff said during the panel.</p>

<p>'I feel like our show has an opportunity and a responsibility to tell some of those stories,' she added.</p>

<p>Medical story: 'There’s no way to be a long-running medical show and not do the medical story of our lifetimes,' Vernoff said during the panel</p>

<p>Vernoff added that the show regularly brings in a panel of doctors to discuss their experiences each year, and the stories they told this year were unlike any other.</p>

<p>'“(The doctors) are literally shaking and trying not to cry, they’re pale, and they’re talking about it as war — a war that they were not trained for,' Vernoff said.</p>

<p>'And that’s been one of our big conversations about Owen (Kevin McKidd), is that he’s actually trained for this in a way that most of the other doctors aren’t,' she added. </p>
