<p>Gascoigne broke down as he told the Sunday People that his father's belongings 'meant so much' to him and said he'd 'really like them back.'   </p>

<p>The raiders' haul included a £2,000 gold cigar cutter and watch both owned by his late father John, according to the Mirror.  </p>

<p>They also took a £40,000 gold diamond-encrusted watch bought with his first pay cheque from Tottenham and a Championship medal from Glasgow Rangers.</p>

<p>Gascoigne went to London to support lifelong friend Vinnie Jones, 55, while he filmed his Life Stories chat. </p>

<p>Police are understood to have attended his house on Tuesday. </p>

<p>And they also took two steaks from the freezer, according to Gascoigne.</p>

<p>Piers told the Sunday People he was 'sorry to hear' about the burglary and said the least he can do is 'buy him some new steaks'. </p>
