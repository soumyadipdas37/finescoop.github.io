<p>It comes after the Kardashian family denied reports that Kris Jenner decided to pull the plug on Keeping Up With The Kardashians after three of her daughters threatened to quit. </p>

<p>It was suggested that the mother-of-six, 64, apparently called time on the show after 14 years when Kim Kardashian, 39, Kourtney Kardashian, 41, and Kylie, 23, all expressed their desire to end the programme.</p>

<p>However MailOnline now understands that it was a decision made by the whole family, not just one person and it was just as 'emotional' for everyone.</p>

<p>Discussing the decision to end the show with executive producer Ryan Seacrest on Wednesday, Kris said: 'I think the number 20 used to sound good until 2020, but the number 20 just seemed like the right time I think for us to take a minute and breathe and everybody slow down a bit… figure out what our next steps are.</p>

<p>Denied! It comes after the Kardashian family have denied reports that Kris Jenner decided to pull the plug on the show after three of her daughters threatened to quit</p>

<p>'We've had such an amazing run and we're so grateful … for every single moment and everyone we work with.' </p>

<p>The denial comes following The Sun's claims that the three sisters had made it clear they no longer wanted to appear on the show.</p>

<p>An insider told the publication: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'</p>

<p>Discussing Kylie's departure, they added: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'</p>

<p>They also noted that she is free to tour with her daughter Stormi's father Travis Scott.  </p>

<p>On Tuesday, Kim  shocked fans by announcing that her family's iconic reality show would be ending after 14 years on the air.</p>
