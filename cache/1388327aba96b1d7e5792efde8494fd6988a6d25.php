<p>The outspoken Australian feminist, 81, criticised 'all-male' families and hit out at the pop singer, 73, for listing David Furnish, 57, as the mother of Zachary, nine, and Elijah, seven.</p>

<p>Zachary was born on Christmas Day in 2010 and Elijah on January 11, 2013. They were both said to have been born to the same unnamed California-based surrogate mother.</p>

<p>Germaine Greer slammed pop singer Sir Elton John for naming his husband as the mother of his two sons on their birth certificates while speaking The Oldie magazine</p>

<p>Speaking to The Oldie magazine, Miss Greer condemned the couple for making the surrogate 'give up' her title as mother of the youngsters.</p>

<p>'Their two sons were born to two women, but David Furnish is the "mother" on their birth certificates,' she said.</p>

<p>'How did we give this title up? Are we going to have a world where families can be all-male?' </p>

<p>Miss Greer, known for writing her 1970 novel The Female Eunach, has split her time between England and Australia since the 1990s.</p>

<p>Germaine slammed the couple, in The Oldie magazine, for making the surrogate 'give up' her title as mother of the youngsters and asked how women had given up the title of 'mother'</p>

<p>The 81 year old went on to criticise women for 'destroying' the political system and said the former Prime Minister Theresa May's time in office was 'a shambles' and branded it 'miserable'</p>

<p>She also claimed women have 'destroyed' our political system and branded former Prime Minister Theresa May's time in office as 'miserable'.</p>

<p>Women looked like 'temple donkeys' as they sat around 'cackling' while Mrs May ran the country, Miss Greer declared.</p>

<p>She added: 'Women have destroyed our political system, in my view - the shambles of Theresa May's miserable time in office: women sitting around cackling and squawking, wearing those earrings with huge lumps on them, looking like temple donkeys in Kerala, and poor old Theresa tiptoeing through that cornfield.' </p>

<p>Earlier this year it was revealed that Sir Elton's ex-wife is suing him for £3million amid claims he broke the terms of their divorce by revealing details about her in his memoir and hit movie.</p>

<p>Renate Blauel, 67, was married to the star for four years from 1984.</p>

<p>The German recording engineer - who is notoriously private - is unhappy that details of their marriage were revealed in the biopic Rocketman and autobiography, Me.</p>

<p>The disclosures triggered mental health problems, her claim said.</p>

<p>However, in court papers seen by The Sun this week, the pair have agreed to try to settle the case in private.</p>

<p>The newspaper reported that their lawyers have until 4pm on October 13 to reach a deal and avoid a meeting in open court. </p>
