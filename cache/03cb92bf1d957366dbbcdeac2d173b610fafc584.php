<p>Across the country in Seattle, there were similar anarchic scenes as protesters blocked off intersections by setting dumpsters ablaze as nationwide protests continued for a fourth night. </p>

<p>Demonstrators gathered in several cities across the country aside from New York, including Los Angeles, Louisville and Denver to express their anger days after it was announced that the officers who shot black woman Breonna Taylor in her Kentucky apartment during a drug raid last March, would not be charged with her death. </p>

<p>Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers in Louisville who entered her home during a narcotics investigation in March.</p>

<p>After several tense moments, police dispersed.</p>

<p>'They're terrorizing joy. We didn't come here to do anything but to have fun,' protester Shanee Grant said.</p>

<p>'The police just came and stormed in and took our belongings … They swarmed us. We were peacefully assembled. There was nothing, no violence,' one organizer said.</p>

<p>Police could be seen taking a number of people into custody. </p>

<p>Soon afterwards, video emerged of NYPD officers rushing at protesters on a sidewalk in the West Village. </p>

<p>A recorded message was played just seconds before police rushed across the empty street to arrest protesters.</p>

<p>'Please be advised that pedestrians are not permitted to walk in the street or roadway,' the message played at the intersection of Hudson Street and West 10th Street.</p>

<p>The arrests were for disorderly conduct according to the NYPD who did not give specific details about what actions were taken by those arrested.</p>

<p>A few police cars followed behind, with officers telling protesters to stay on the sidewalk and out of the street before the march ended. Many briefly ended up back at a downtown square that has been a focal point of protests.</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter protesters march in Louisville.

<p>As a crowd gathered outside the First Unitarian Church late Saturday, fires were set in a street nearby after 11pm.</p>

<p> Police said fireworks burned a car, and windows had been broken at Spalding University buildings close by. Police tweeted that arrests would be made, but specific numbers weren't immediately released.</p>

<p>At least 100 people were protesting on Saturday night and  planned to march to Louisville's East End</p>

<p>Cameron said the other officers were not charged with Taylor's killing because they acted to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, visited a downtown park on Friday with family and her lawyers, and called on Kentucky officials to release all body camera footage, police files and the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings. Palmer said in a statement read by a family member that she felt the criminal justice system had failed her. Palmer marched at the head of Friday's protest march.</p>

<p>The grand jury's ruling weighed heavily on protesters like Amber Brown. A central figure in the downtown demonstrations, Brown said she was angry.</p>

<p>'It feels like we went backward,' she said Friday night. 'I think people are still in shock and we´re not sure how to move forward.'</p>

<p>Brown criticized the police crackdown in the downtown area that has been in effect since early in the week.</p>

<p>'People are afraid to exercise their First Amendment right,' she said. 'Since when does protest have a curfew? Since when does freedom and civil rights have a curfew?'</p>

<p>At the other end of the political spectrum, around one thousand supporters of the right-wing Proud Boys group, some armed, rallied in Portland, on Saturday in a largely peaceful event that drew far fewer followers than organizers forecast and state authorities had feared.</p>

<p>The rally in a north Portland park ended after a few hours of speeches and chants, many against anti-fascists and Black Lives Matter groups which held a nearby counter-protest.</p>

<p>'You're here for the right reasons, the people down the street are against America,' said an unnamed speaker in a video posted on the Parler page of the self-declared 'Western chauvinist' Proud Boys.</p>

<p>State Governor Kate Brown declared a weekend state of emergency for Oregon's biggest city, saying 'white supremacist groups' were traveling from out of state to attend the rally called by the Proud Boys to 'end domestic terrorism' in Portland.</p>

<p>The Democratic-run city has seen four months of near-daily demonstrations against police violence and racism, many ending in violence.</p>

<p>Proud Boys leaders said the group's presence pushed Brown to declare an emergency and create a state and local police task force to keep the peace in a city President Donald Trump has called an 'anarchist jurisdiction.'</p>

<p>Local and state leaders said in a letter to the community that Proud Boys supporters had openly discussed military-style tactical operations and planned to cause chaos and violence while claiming to be acting in support of police.</p>

<p>Police said they were investigating an assault of one person documenting the Proud Boys rally and a total of three people were arrested there and at the counter-protest that also drew around 1,000 people.</p>
