<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A paedophile who abused his own daughter and sister may have confessed to the Wanda Beach murders seven years after two schoolgirls were found partially buried at the beach.</p>

<p>Christine Sharrock and Marianne Schmidt's bodies were discovered in the sand, near Cronulla in Sydney's south, on January 12, 1965.</p>

<p>The best friends and neighbours, both aged 15, had been at the beach the day earlier with Marianne's younger siblings, Peter, Trixie, Wolfgang and Norbert.</p>

<p>It was a gusty day so the group sought shelter in sand hills. The schoolgirls then wandered away from the younger children and were not seen again.  </p>

<p>Marianne's siblings eventually returned home without the teenagers. The alarm was raised when the schoolgirls failed to catch the train home to West Ryde later that evening. </p>

<p>In 1972 - seven years after the teenagers were bashed, stabbed and sexually assaulted - a young man allegedly confessed to the crime, The Australian reported. </p>

<p>'I did that,' he told his then-girlfriend. </p>

<p>The alleged confession came to light years later when the man was being investigated for sexually abusing his daughter. </p>

<p>The victim, now aged in her 40s, told police in 2016 she had been subject to abuse at the hands of her father from four until 11.</p>

<p>The victim's mother revealed to police her former husband claimed he was the Wanda Beach murderer when the couple first started dating.</p>

<p>'While we were sitting in his car, (he) turned to me and out of the blue asked me if I remembered the Wanda Beach murders … then said quite calmly words to the ­effect of 'I did that',' she told police. </p>

<p>The woman told police she felt 'startled' but thought he was making a joke. She responded with something like 'don't be silly, you did not'.   </p>

<p>'(He) did not respond straight away but after looking at me and obviously seeing the startled ­expression on my face said something similar to ''Nah I didn't. I'm only kidding'',' she told police.</p>

<p>The woman also advised officers she believed her former husband is 'capable of anything'. </p>

<p>The man is now serving an eight year prison sentence for the sexual abuse of his daughter. The former car salesman was convicted in 2018. </p>

<p>The man's younger sister was one of two other women who also told police they were sexually abused by him as a child.</p>

<p>The grave for teenager Christine Mary Sharrock is seen after her horrific death</p>

<p>Police have reportedly been advised the convicted sex abuser went to the same school as Marianne - Marsden High School - and lived locally.  </p>

<p>It's understood he enjoyed surfing as a teenager and frequently visited Sydney beaches including Cronulla.</p>

<p>The man cannot be named to protect the identity of his daughter, </p>

<p>Marianne's brother Hans Schmidt said the revelation should lead to further investigations.  </p>

<p>'Anything that would bring closure to the whole case would obviously be of great interest to the family,' Mr Schmidt said.</p>

<p>He said his brother Wolfgang remembered seeing a 'blond surfer guy' on the day of the teenager's murders.</p>

<p>NSW police declined to comment on the confession allegations when contacted by The Australian, adding that Homicide Squad detectives continue to appeal for public information. </p>

<p>Known as the 'Wanda murders', the case is the oldest under review by the NSW unsolved homicide unit. </p>
