<p>Prince Hisahito of Japan turned 14 this weekend and the Japanese imperial family celebrated by releasing new pictures. The snaps showed the teenager with his father, Fumihito, Prince Akishino, 54, in the garden of their Tokyo residence</p>

<p>The teenager is likely to one day rule Japan as emperor, being the only male heir of the imperial family apart from his father.  </p>

<p>His uncle Naruhito ascended the throne in May 2019 after his father Emperor Akihito abdicated. Nahurito does not have a son, but a daughter, Princess Aiko, who turned 18 in December. </p>

<p>Being the brother of an emperor without a male heir, Prince Akishino became the direct heir to the throne. </p>

<p>Hisahito also has two older sisters, Princesses Mako, 28, and Kako, 25, but Japanese law states that women cannot rule as empresses.</p>

<p>The teenage heir is the only member of his family since World War II not to study at the private school of Gakushuin. Instead, his parents decided in 2013 to enroll him at a Tokyo state school attached to the Ochanomizu university. </p>

<p>In 2019, aged 12, the teenager made his high school debut, accompanied by his beaming proud parents.   </p>

<p>Both father and son were wearing beige trousers with checked shirt as the sun shone on the garden of their residence </p>

<p>Hisahito listened intently as his father dispensed some advice in the official birthday pictured released by the imperial family of Japan </p>
