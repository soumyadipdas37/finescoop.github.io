<p>The Royal Australian Mint has coined the 'Donation Dollar', a green-centred version of the currency, in time for International Day of Charity on September 5.</p>

<p>The mint plans to produce 25 million coins, one for each Australian resident, in the next few years with three million in circulation from Wednesday.</p>

<p>Australians will have 25 million extra little reminders to donate to charity with the roll-out of a special one dollar coin</p>

<p>The Community Council for Australia says one-in-five people are predicting they or their family will need charitable support in the next 12 months and the new coin is a little reminder to give.</p>

<p>'Every one of these coins is a chance to spark new conversations about generosity,' CCA chair Tim Costello said.</p>

<p>'It might be a small coin, but it will circulate as a constant reminder to give, and that can make a big difference.</p>

<p>'We are hoping people will ask questions like who are you giving your donation dollar to, which charities do you already support, is it time to give a little more?'</p>

<p>A recent survey found three-in-five people would be likely to give a Donation Dollar to charity if they received one in their change.</p>

<p>More than 80 per cent of Australians have donated something in the past year, but 70 per cent admitted they often forgot or lacked time to do so.</p>

<p>The twin shocks of coronavirus pandemic on the heels of a catastrophic bushfire season triggered an upswell of generosity peaking in December.</p>

<p>However, a report by JBWere estimates donations will fall 18 per cent over the next two years due to the economic fallout of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Australia has about 57,000 charities and not-for-profits all vying for attention.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the Donation Dollar will prompt people to change their behaviour and donate smaller amounts more often, not just in times of crisis.</p>

<p>CCA chair Tim Costello said the Donation Dollar arrives at a time when many Australians needed a helping hand.</p>

<p>'There's no doubt in my mind this is a gift that will benefit those who are most vulnerable in our nation,' he said.</p>
