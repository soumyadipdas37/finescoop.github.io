<p>And Karlie Kloss opted for a low-key figure as she stepped out for a stroll with a friend in New York City on Sunday.</p>

<p>The model, 28, donned a white jacket and a matching vest for the outing along with a pair of black leggings. </p>

<p>Out and about: Karlie Kloss, 28, opted for a low-key figure as she stepped out for a stroll with a friend in New York City on Sunday</p>

<p>Karlie also sported a pair of black trainers and put safety first as she wore a matching face mask while running errands.</p>

<p>Styling her blonde locks into a ponytail, the beauty also wore a black cap and a pair of small gold earrings.</p>

<p>Grabbing a cup of coffee for her stroll, the model completed her look with a small bejewelled necklace.   </p>

<p>Karlie celebrated her latest birthday this August 3 and marked the occasion with a YouTube video listing 28 Things I've Learned In 28 Years.</p>

<p>Outfit: The model donned a white jacket and a matching vest for the outing along with a pair of black leggings</p>

<p>She urged fans to 'show up at the polls because we all deserve change this November' despite the fact she is related to the incumbent U.S. President.</p>

<p>The blonde bombshell has publicly expressed her political disagreements with the the First Family on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>She announced this January that she voted 'as a Democrat in 2016' and clarified that she 'plans to do the same thing in 2020.'</p>

<p>Karlie has also repeatedly posted in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, although critics like former Rookie editor Tavi Gevinson have slammed her as a hypocrite because she has not publicly denounced her family vociferously enough.</p>

<p>Casual: Karlie also sported a pair of black trainers and put safety first as she wore a matching face mask while running errands </p>

<p>Investigative reporter Vicky Ward's book Kushner, Inc. aired out a raft of gossip about Karlie and Josh's romance - and his family's opposition to the match.</p>

<p>Jared and his parents Charlie and Seryl objected to Karlie's being a 'shiksa' who, unlike former Gentile Ivanka, did not come from a powerful family.</p>

<p>Karlie's lack of Ivanka's Ivy League education also rankled with the Kushner family, whose inner circle derisively referred to Josh's girlfriend as 'the lingerie model.'</p>

<p>The night of U.S. President Donald Trump's inaugural ball, the Kushners held a Sabbath dinner where Charlie warned Josh off Karlie in front of other guests.</p>

<p>Although Josh's parents avoided coming face-to-face with her for six years after she began dating their son, Karlie was evidently bent on impressing them.</p>

<p>She took to Orthodox Judaism with such brio that she went on foot to Barry Diller's Oscar party one year, owing to restrictions on operating a car during the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Throwback: Karlie is married to Joshua Kushner, the brother of Donald Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner; the couple are pictured in New York last October</p>
