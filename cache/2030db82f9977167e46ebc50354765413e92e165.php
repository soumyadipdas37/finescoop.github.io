<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Carlo Ancelotti heaped praise on Dominic Calvert-Lewis after the striker scored his second hat-trick of the season to progress Everton through to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup. </p>

<p>Ancelotti said the 23-year-old was 'on fire' after opening the scoring against West Ham in the 11th minute of the game, before finding the next again in the 78th and 84th minute. </p>

<p>Calvert-Lewis' performance will have given England manager Gareth Southgate a timely reminder of his talents before he selects his squad for this month's international triple header on Thursday. </p>

<p> Carlo Ancelotti heaped praise on Dominic Calvert-Lewis (above) after scoring a hat-trick</p>

<p>'He is doing a fantastic job in the moment, he is really on fire and scoring a lot of goals,' Ancelotti said of the 23-year-old.</p>

<p>'He's in a very good moment. Whether he's the best (English striker) I don't know, but I don't care. For me, for us, he is.'</p>

<p>Fans were of the same opinion as the Everton manager and took to social media to praise Calvert-Lewis' efforts. </p>

<p>One Twitter user joked that Calvert-Lewis drew similarities to Ronaldo, writing: 'Dominic Calvert Lewin should take off the mask now we know it's you Ronaldo.'</p>

<p>While another added: 'Calvert-Lewin is the best striker in Liverpool.' </p>

<p>Victory may have come at a cost however, as Richarlison hobbled off shortly after firing Everton back in front in the 56th minute, while there were also problems for Allan and Jonjoe Kenny.</p>

<p>Ancelotti played down those injuries, but admitted Allan and Kenny may now miss Saturday's game against Brighton.</p>

<p>'Richarlison has a twist on his ankle but I think it's not so bad,' Ancelotti said. 'Allan had a muscle problem and Kenny a twist on his ankle. We have to check them tomorrow but it seems no so bad...</p>

<p>'Richarlison I think can recover for Saturday, Allan and Kenny will be more difficult.' </p>

<p>Ancelotti said the 23-year-old was 'on fire' after opening the scoring in the 11th minute</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin's performance will have sent reminder to Gareth Southgate ahead of selection</p>

<p>The win extended Everton's perfect start to the season to six games in all competitions, and they will be taken seriously in Thursday's quarter-final draw as they seek their first silverware since 1995.</p>

<p>Ancelotti continued: 'We have started really well. It was not a surprise because I think that his squad has a lot of quality.</p>

<p>'We were able to adapt very well with the new signings but the others came back with different ambitions and different motivations so now we are doing well.'</p>

<p>Richarlison, on the other hand, was hurt trying to tackle Ben Johnson and later hobbled off</p>
