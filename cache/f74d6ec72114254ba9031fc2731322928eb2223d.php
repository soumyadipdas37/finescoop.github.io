<p>It comes amid calls from fans to remove Delta from her role as a judge on The Voice. </p>

<p>Following rumours that the singing competition won't feature any international stars next year, fans flocked to Facebook on Thursday begging for Seven to axe Delta as well.</p>

<p>'If they get rid of Delta I might actually watch this. Can't stand her,' one viewer wrote</p>

<p>'Please no more Delta!' another begged.</p>

<p>Changing of the guard? Elsewhere, one fan suggested that Seven replace the Born To Try singer with Tina Arena</p>

<p>Delta has long received criticism for her supposedly 'annoying' and 'theatrical' behaviour on The Voice.</p>

<p>Speaking to the September issue of Marie Claire, the Born To Try favourite said she was left 'absolutely broken' by some of the negative feedback she received.</p>

<p>'I don't think all of [the criticism] was fair but there's a lot I can reflect on,' she said.</p>

<p>'At the time [of The Voice's first season], being 27 and on TV, my brain could compute that it was part of the cycle. But it still hurt me.'</p>

<p>Rather than letting the negativity get her down, Delta said she has learned to grow a thicker skin.</p>

<p>'It's one thing to know of something. It's another thing to have walked it. The chapter taught me resilience and made me stronger. What a gift,' she said.</p>
