<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>More than 2,000 Ford Focus vehicles are being recalled over fears their engines could stall.</p>

<p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Sunday that 2,787 vehicles from the 2019 model year are affected. </p>

<p>Defected transmission studs on the vehicle's three-cylinder engine may chafe against the engine wiring loom, the ACCC said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Pictured: a 2019 Ford Focus. More than 2700 vehicles have been recalled as the engine can lose power and stall, increasing the risk of accident</p>

<p>The problem is with defected transmission studs that can damage the wiring loom. Pictured: a 2019 Ford Focus engine from Russia</p>

<p>If the wiring loom is damaged, the engine can lose power and stall. </p>

<p>'This can increase the risk of injury and death of vehicle occupants and other road users in an accident,' the ACCC said in its recall notice. </p>

<p>The chafing can also set off the engine warning light.</p>

<p>The affected cars were built from 28 September, 2018 to 22 May, 2019.</p>

<p>They were sold from a basic starting price of $25,990 before on-road costs, according to consumer vehicle website caradvice.com.au</p>

<p>Consumers can check their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN number) against a list on the ACCC website to see if they are affected.</p>

<p>The ACCC said the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications was the regulator that issued the recall. </p>

<p>It is the latest of several recalls to hit Ford Australia this year.</p>

<p>On Thursday, more than 3000 Ford Transits were recalled after a dangerous problem with the electronic run-on water pump was disocvered.</p>

<p>The pump aids the cooling of the engine and if it fails the engine can overheat, melting the pump body and wiring and causing a fire. </p>

<p>This is the latest recall involving tens of thousands of vehicles to hit Ford Australia this year</p>

<p>On September 14, another recall was issued for Ford Ranger utes and Everest SUVs built from 2016 to 2017 after an incorrect chemical mixture was found in the airbag initiators.</p>

<p>This could result in the side airbags not deploying in the event of a crash. </p>

<p> In June, more than 20,000 Ford Ranger utes and Everest SUVs were recalled after a fault was discovered with the transmission fluid pump gears.</p>

<p>If the pump failed while driving, the hydraulic pressure could drop causing the engine to lose power, increasing the risk of an accident. </p>
