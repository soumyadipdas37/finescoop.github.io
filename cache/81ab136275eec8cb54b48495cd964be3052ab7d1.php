<p>The 48-year-old travelled from Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne on August 31 but provided false information on his border declaration.</p>

<p>He returned to Queensland to recover from infected gunshot wounds after being targeted in a drive-by shooting on July 1.</p>

<p>Former bikie Shane Bowden has been fined $750 for breaching coronavirus quarantine travelling from Victoria to Queensland</p>

<p>He is on a waiting list for an operation to reattach his knee cap to his knee.</p>

<p>Bowden appeared in Southport Magistrate Court on Thursday wearing a leg brace as he pleaded guilty to one count of providing false or misleading documents under the Public Health Act.</p>

<p>He was diagnosed with coronavirus while in hospital in Melbourne awaiting surgery, but was cleared by Victorian authorities on August 21.</p>

<p>On August 22 he tested positive to a second test but was not infectious.</p>

<p>The court was told Bowden was taking strong painkillers when he returned to Queensland on August 31 and was confused by the questions on the declaration form.</p>

<p>Magistrate Joan White accepted the questions on the form were not clearly worded.</p>

<p>'People have to do the right thing but I can understand from the submissions made on your behalf that it was somewhat confusing for you and I can see exactly why,' Ms White said.</p>

<p>'I can understand how he ended up confused, I find it confusing.'</p>

<p>She fined Bowden $750 - significantly less than the maximum penalty of $13,345.</p>

<p>Bowden was once part of the Finks 'terror team' and jailed over the Gold Coast's 'ballroom blitz' brawl in which three people were shot and two stabbed in 2006.</p>
