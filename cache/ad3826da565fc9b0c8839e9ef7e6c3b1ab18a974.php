<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Real Madrid are reportedly plotting a move for up-and-coming Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga this summer with the prime motivation of ensuring no other top European club buys him. </p>

<p>Camavinga has broken into the first-team with the Ligue 1 club and has earned plaudits with his performances at the age of 17. </p>

<p>French champions PSG, who lost their season-opener on Thursday, are also eyeing a deal but Madrid could submit a £55m (€60m) bid for Camavinga, with the intention of loaning him back to Rennes for a season or two, according to Spanish outlet Diario Sport. </p>

<p>Real Madrid are plotting a move for 17-year-old Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga</p>

<p>French champions PSG are also interested in a deal but Madrid are set to make the first move</p>

<p>The report details that Rennes would be encouraged by a financial incentive to sell the 17-year-old alongside playing a part in his continued development for the next two years. </p>

<p>The midfielder started 24 Ligue 1 matches last season as he helped his side overachieve and claim a Champions League qualification spot. </p>

<p>More significantly however, Camavinga was handed his senior France debut last week, when he featured against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League. </p>

<p>Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane could play a huge role in persuading Camavinga that his long-term future should be at the Bernabeu, as two of Europe's biggest clubs get set to go head-to-head for one of European football's rising talents.   </p>
