<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona have agreed a £28m deal to bring Lyon winger Memphis Depay to the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman has been keen on signing the 26-year-old, who he knows very well from his time coaching the Dutch national team.</p>

<p>Depay is set to travel to Barcelona in the coming days to complete a medical, and it is hoped he will be presented as a Blaugrana player later in the week.</p>

<p>Memphis Depay is set to reunite with Ronald Koeman after Barcelona agreed a £28m deal</p>

<p>Depay is set to travel to Barcelona in the next few days so the winger can complete a medical</p>

<p>It could mean that Depay might be available for Barcelona's opening game of the LaLiga season, which is on September 27 against Villarreal.</p>

<p>Koeman has only recently been appointed as manager of Barcelona replacing former coach Quique Setien.</p>

<p>The club are hoping to bounce back strong after a disastrous season where they lost the LaLiga title to their great rivals Real Madrid, and were humiliated in their Champions League exit following an 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich.</p>

<p>New Barcelona coach Koeman is looking to strengthen the team after a disastrous campaign</p>

<p>Depay joined Lyon in January 2017 after a disastrous spell at Manchester United who he joined in the summer of 2015 for £25m. </p>

<p>Manchester United had buy-back and sell-on clauses included in the deal when Depay joined the French side for around £17m.</p>

<p>Since joining Lyon, Depay has shown much more maturity and has improved from his days at Old Trafford, scoring 57 goals in 140 appearances.</p>

<p>Depay made a fantastic start to the new season for Lyon scoring a hat-trick in their opening day 4-1 victory over Dijon. </p>

<p>The Dutchman could start in an attacking lineup with Lionel Messi who decided to stay at the Nou Camp, after previously insisting he was going to leave. </p>
