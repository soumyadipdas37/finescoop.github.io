<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The future of fashion chain New Look is on a knife edge after a group of major landlords 'flatly rejected' its rescue plan.</p>

<p>The 450-store chain, with more than 10,000 staff, has asked landlords to switch to controversial turnover-linked rent contracts and offered sweeteners such as one-off payments and multiple lease breaks in return.</p>

<p>But The Mail on Sunday understands around ten landlords – including several big shopping centre owners – have already rebuffed the plan which will be voted on by creditors in nine days' time. That leaves the chain 'facing Armageddon', according to one source.</p>

<p>New Look has asked landlords to switch to controversial turnover-linked rent contracts</p>

<p>'If this fails, with no credible buyer emerging, the fallout is most likely liquidation,' said another.</p>

<p>One retail rival said: 'Big landlords feel like they need to be seen taking a stand. But if they are hoping other creditors will step in, they are playing with fire because this could all go very wrong very quickly.' </p>

<p>New Look said the plan 'represents the best outcome for all stakeholders'.</p>
