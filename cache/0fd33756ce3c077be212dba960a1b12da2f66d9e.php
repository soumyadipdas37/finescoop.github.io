<p>Four boats were lost in the rescue mission to save the children, he added. </p>

<p>Two firefighters suffered minor injuries when they were dragged at least a mile down the river by the current.  </p>

<p>'The amount of water and the current is so strong, it overcomes you when you start to turn a boat, and you're in debris and tress and such, so they were fighting against that as well, so they'd hit a tree, they'd flip over. That's basically what they were in last night,' Blanton said Tuesday.</p>

<p>The mother and two first responders were taken to a local hospital for treatment. </p>

<p>Family friends told WRAL.com the mom has since been discharged from hospital.    </p>
