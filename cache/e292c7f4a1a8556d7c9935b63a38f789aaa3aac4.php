<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds are poised to move for out-of-favour Leicester winger Demarai Gray, who has been told he can leave the club.</p>

<p>Gray has less than a year remaining on his contract and has yet to feature in the Premier League this season, with his only action a 90-minute outing in Leicester’s 2-0 defeat by Arsenal in the Carabao Cup last week.</p>

<p>Leeds are seeking competition in wide areas for Jack Harrison and Helder Costa and Gray, 24, represents an intriguing option.</p>

<p>Leeds United are now poised to move for out-of-favour Leicester winger Demarai Gray</p>

<p>He has made 132 appearances in the Premier League since joining Leicester from Birmingham for £4.5million midway through their 2015-16 title-winning campaign, scoring 10 goals and providing nine assists — yet he has struggled to establish himself under Brendan Rodgers.</p>

<p>Gray slipped further down the pecking order at the King Power Stadium when Foxes boss Rodgers moved to sign winger Cengiz Under on loan from Roma earlier this month.</p>

<p>Even before Under’s arrival, Ayoze Perez and Harvey Barnes had started the season on the flanks, with Gray not even in the squad for Leicester’s three league games as Marc Albrighton was preferred as the winger on the bench.</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa is seeking more competition in wide areas for Jack Harrison and Helder Costa</p>

<p>Asked recently about Gray’s future, Rodgers said: ‘He is now 24 and it’ll be whether he wants to continue in the role he’s played here or whether he sees himself going out and becoming a starter.</p>

<p>‘It’ll be up to him. He’s in his last year and he hasn’t signed another deal but, for me, I will always respect Demarai and what his wishes are.’ ends</p>
