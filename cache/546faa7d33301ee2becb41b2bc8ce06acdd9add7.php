<p>Appearing on the show once again today from Cairo, Mohamed burst into an angry rant, defending their relationship, and telling anyone who doubts his love for Iris to 'go to hell'</p>

<p>When quizzed on why he is so keen to marry Iris, Mohammed decided to ignore the question, and introduce himself to viewers, clarifying that he is indeed in love with Iris.  </p>

<p>'Hello everyone in the studio', he said, 'My name is Mohammed, I am an Egyptian man, I have engineering of courses, I meet Iris online.</p>

<p>'We chatted, we chatted, she wants to come to Egypt to see the pyramids, I meet her, I found Iris understood me and comforted me.' </p>

<p>Becoming more irate, Mohammed went on: 'The love does not know any difference between age, or countries this is our life, Iris chose me and I chose Iris'.</p>

<p>'I want to say for all the people who attack our love, it's none of your business, focus your lives, go to hell. That is all.</p>

<p>'I am angry about saying on the media, people say I am not a toy boy, I am a man, I am a man, okay? I am a man, not a toy boy. I am not game, please do not say that again.' </p>

<p>A proud Iris then interjected, saying: 'Normally Mohammed is very shy when he's speaking, he's not shy in bed.' </p>

<p>Host Holly then quizzed Iris on how Mohammed felt after her last interview, and whether he may have felt she overshared slightly.  </p>

<p>Viewers were puzzled at the rant, with some joking that it seemed like Mohammed was 'reeling off his CV', when asked why he wanted to marry Iris</p>

<p>Iris answered: He said "Why was I so graphic?" Because I speak the truth. </p>

<p>'I have a tube of KY jelly with me this time, I haven't used it I might go back to the shop and get my money back.' </p>

<p>The couple's relationship hit the spotlight earlier this year when Iris went on ITV's This Morning to discuss the huge age gap and ended up revealing details of their sex life. </p>

<p>Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield weren't prepared for how forthcoming she would be and immediately collapsed in giggles as the OAP exclaimed: 'The first night was pretty rough. </p>

<p>'Nobody had been near me for 35 years... I thought I was a virgin again!' As Phil, 57, held his head in his hands, Iris continued: 'Can I tell you what we used? A whole tube of KY jelly'. </p>

<p>Collapsing in laughter, a flustered Holly, 38, couldn't control herself as Iris continued: 'The thing is I couldn't walk the next day... I felt like I was riding a horse! Saddle sore wasn't in it. Anyway, we got over it.' </p>

<p>Speaking to MailOnline from his home in Giza, south of Cairo, earlier this year Mohamed stressed that while people may be skeptical about their relationship, his love for Iris was real.</p>

<p>‘It might seem a bit strange having a wife who is 20 years older than your mother but that’s love,' he said. 'It makes you blind.</p>

<p>'When you are a man and you fall in love with a woman, it doesn’t matter how old she is or what she looks like.’ </p>
