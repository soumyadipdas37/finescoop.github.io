<p>Mickey's outing comes after he seemingly reignited his most ongoing feud with Robert De Niro in July, which originally restarted last year.</p>

<p>In an Instagram post, Mickey claimed that director Martin Scorsese wanted him to be in his 2019 crime film The Irishman, but De Niro refused to work with him.</p>

<p>He wrote in the lengthy barrage of words: 'Hey Robert De Niro, that’s right i am talking to you, you big f***ing crybaby.</p>

<p>'A friend of mine just recently told me that a few months back you're quoted as saying to newspapers ‘Mickey Rourke’s a liar he talks all kind of s**t!’'</p>

<p>Rourke made the revelation about Scorsese wanting to set up a meeting about a possible role in The Irishman, and DeNiro's rebuttal of him being in the film, during an appearance on an Italian talk show last September. </p>

<p>De Niro's reps were quick to respond at the time with a statement saying Rourke was 'never asked to be in The Irishman nor was he ever even thought of, discussed or considered to be in the movie,' in a Page Six article titled -- Robert De Niro: Mickey Rourke is lying about The Irishman snub. </p>

<p>'Listen Mr.Tough Guy in the movies, you're the 1st person that ever called me a liar and it was in a newspaper,' Rourke continued in the Instagram post. </p>

<p>Call out: Mickey's outing comes after he seemingly reignited his most ongoing feud with Robert De Niro in July, calling him a 'crybaby' and a 'tough guy'</p>

<p>It's at this point that The Wrestler star made a harsh promise to the two-time Academy Award-winner.</p>

<p>'Let me tell you something, you punk a**, when i see you i swear to God on my Grandmother, on my brother and all my dogs, i gonna embarrass you severally 100%.'</p>

<p>He concluded the post by signing-off: 'Mickey Rourke 'as God is my witness.' </p>

<p>Snubbed again? Rourke claimed famed director Martin Scorsese wanted him to be in his 2019 crime film The Irishman, but De Niro refused to work with him (pictured in Angel Heart)</p>

<p>Rourke has been very open about how he used to look up to DeNiro as an acting role model before they starred together in Angel Heart. But that all changed for him when he went to introduce himself on the set. </p>

<p>'About five minutes later, [De Niro] comes over he said, I think it's better if we don't talk because of characters in the movie. It's better if we don’t say hello, talk or anything,' Rourke added in the 2019 interview.</p>

<p>'It hurt my feelings a little bit 'cause I looked up to him.'</p>

<p>He added, 'I don't look up to [DeNiro] no more; I look through him, I came up from the s***. He doesn't know that life. I lived that f***ing life, so every time I look at him in the face, I look right through his ***hole.'</p>
