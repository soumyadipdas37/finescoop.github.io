<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman has shared her ingenious hack to heat up cold food while stuck in hotel quarantine without a microwave. </p>

<p>Nat Chancellor arrived from overseas ready to undertake her mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine in Rydges Southbank in Brisbane. </p>

<p>Nat Chancellor revealed she used a hairdryer to heat up her food while stuck in hotel quarantine</p>

<p>Some of the food delivered to Ms Chancellor was shared to Facebook</p>

<p>But with no microwave available, Ms Chancellor had to think laterally.</p>

<p>When the time came to re-heat the meal, she wrapped it in aluminium foil and placed it in an insulated bag.</p>

<p>A video she shared online showed her then unzipping a small section of the insulated bag, and put the end of her hairdryer in the gap.</p>

<p>On her online post she said 'it actually worked' but added that she 'didn’t do it for long and turned it off a couple of times' for fear of melting the container or overcooking the food. </p>

<p>Social media users were in awe at the bizarre technique but thanked Ms Chancellor for sharing it.</p>

<p>'The good to come out of quarantine! Ppl getting more inventive &amp; thinking outside of the box,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'Brilliant idea,' another wrote. </p>

<p>'I reckon you could use an iron to heat up a toastie. Just an idea!' someone else joked, referencing the oft-used hack. </p>

<p>Australians returning from overseas are required to undertake 14-days of mandatory hotel quarantine to control the spread of COVID-19. </p>
