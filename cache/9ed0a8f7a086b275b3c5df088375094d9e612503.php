<p>Hilarious: Kylie Jenner's famous video tour of Kylie Cosmetics HQ was given a hilarious update on Tuesday as comedian Steff Todd dubbed the video with a Yorkshire accent</p>

<p>Dubbing the new audio over Kylie's original video, the clip began: 'Hiya, I'm Kylie. I recently won 20 grand on a scratch card and I thought I'm going to set up my own makeup business. </p>

<p>'I used to work at Superdrug but they've been doing my head in for ages not treating me right so I thought I'm going to rival them and I bought a warehouse on the outskirts of Leeds. Now lets go on a little tour!'</p>

<p>'First things first, hand sanitiser. I don't know about you but this corona's doing my head in.'</p>

<p>Creative: Imagining how things would be if Kylie was in a fact a British northerner, Kylie was seen showing off her Miss Leeds award and discussing her past job at Superdrug</p>

<p>As the clip cut to Kylie showing off the company's lobby and staff, Yorkshire Kylie said: 'There's Julie, that's me mum, works on reception'.</p>

<p>Gesturing at two more staff members, she added: 'What the heck are them two doing in here? They're work experience, don't film them for god's sake!' </p>

<p>Picking up a pink umbrella she continued: 'I've even got branded umbrellas cause obviously it's always chucking it down. Help yourself if you want one!' </p>

<p>Standing over her immaculately displayed counter top, she went on: 'Got all my makeup laid out there, looks good doesn't it. </p>

<p>'Obviously I didn't do it, got one of me workers to do it, Sue. Shout out to Sue!' </p>

<p>Savvy: Dubbing the new audio over Kylie's original video, the clip began, 'Hiya, I'm Kylie. I won 20 grand on a scratch card and I thought I'm going to set up my own makeup business'</p>

<p>The tour then took viewers into Kylie's personal office, where Kylie's business awards had been given a little twist. </p>

<p>She explained: 'This is my little office where I like to keep some of my little awards. Miss Leeds!</p>

<p>'Champagne machine got one of them - you won't find that in Superdrug!' </p>

<p>Waving at a coworker, Yorkshire Kylie quipped, 'She's getting fired soon, she's so bad'. </p>

<p>She continued: 'I used to work at Superdrug but they've been doing my head in for ages not treating me right so I thought I'm going to rival them and I bought a warehouse in Leeds'</p>

<p>The video concluded with Kylie walking into her daughter Stormi's on-site nursery room, as Yorkshire Kylie bellowed: 'Last room, follow me. </p>

<p>'This is my little lasses room Chardonnay. Wake up you lazy git!' </p>

<p>Steff left her followers in hysterics with the clip, with the Twitter video racking up more than 2900 retweets and 12,300 likes in less than 24 hours. </p>

<p>Last year, Kylie sent her fans wild when she gave them a first look inside her office.   </p>
