<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Catholic convent has been converted into an extravagant mansion, complete with a gym, 600-bottle wine cellar, eight-metre ceilings and an indoor lift that moves between four floors.</p>

<p>Built by Australian architect Edmund Blackett in 1876, 14c Jane Street in Balmain, in Sydney's inner-west, started life as the Convent of the Immaculate Conception, a school home to 10 nuns and 30 boarders who took lessons in a study hall large enough to seat 300 pupils.</p>

<p>After closing its doors due to financial hardship, a 20th-century renovation divided the school into three private residences before it was restored to its original glory in 2011 as part of a project to preserve historic buildings.</p>

<p>The redesign has transformed the landmark - which is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register as a structure of 'High Local Significance' - into a one-of-a-kind family home with a rooftop entertainment deck overlooking the Harbour Bridge.</p>

<p>The Convent of the Immaculate Conception on Jane Street in Balmain, in Sydney's inner-west, which has been converted into an extravagant eight-bedroom mansion</p>

<p>Vaulted ceilings tower eight metres above the living room, decorated in a Gothic style in a nod to the building's heritage</p>

<p>Eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms are spread over 702 square metres of internal space - a staggering 482 bigger than the average floor size of a New South Wales home which sat at 220.3 in 2018, according to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </p>

<p>Vaulted ceilings tower between up to eight metres above the spacious living room and kitchen-cum-dining area, which is fitted with a floor-to-ceiling bookcase, custom timber cabinets and Italian marble.</p>

<p>Other standout features include a self-contained guest apartment, a master suite with its own lounge room and office as well as premium kauri floorboards and cedar doors which run throughout the house. </p>

<p>The sprawling rooftop deck overlooks iconic landmarks including the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the city skyline</p>

<p>Outside, multiple balconies jut out over the landscaped garden where a barbecue and dining patio runs along the edge while an ornate fountain acts as centre-piece.</p>

<p>The house is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of 'Gothic-revival' architecture in the Harbour City, where many Victorian-era buildings were demolished by developers and replaced by concrete blocks from the 1950s onwards.</p>

<p>Staircases crisscross between the four floors, with spacious landing areas in between</p>

<p>The dining area has ample space for a 12-seater table (left); outside a barbecue patio (right) runs along the side of the building</p>

<p>The property has even greater potential than its current state because it comes with pre-approved planning permission for a swimming pool and space to build a four-car parking garage - a far cry from its humble convent beginnings.</p>

<p>Bresic Whitney listing agent Adrian Oddi said the unique property has already attracted interest from overseas just days after it hit the market with a price tag of $12million on Saturday, September 19.</p>

<p>'The owners have given it a complete overhaul...the buyer pool for this property will stretch well out of Balmain,' Mr Oddi told realestate.com.au.</p>
