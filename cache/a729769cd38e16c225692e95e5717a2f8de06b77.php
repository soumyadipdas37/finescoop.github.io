<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kanye West has allegedly paid over $3 million to gather signatures in order to be placed on the presidential ballot in November.</p>

<p>The rapper, 43, reportedly enlisted the help of a number of people to get the required signatures, however he has found many states have barred him from being included in the ballot despite his efforts.</p>

<p>According to a report from TMZ on Monday, a source at Let the Voters Decide said Kanye has paid the petitioning group between $3.5 and $4.5 million for them to work across 15 states but with mixed results.</p>

<p>Funding: Kanye West 'has spent over $3 million to gather signatures to make the presidential ballot in 15 states... but he has been BARRED from three states', it was reported on Monday</p>

<p>The publication claimed Kanye paid $1 million to get 93,000 signatures in Arizona, but a judge is said to have barred him from being on the ballot.</p>

<p>It was also claimed that the same thing happened in Ohio and Virginia, and he is said to have pain $325k and $300k respectively for the signatures but still didn't make it on the ballot.</p>

<p>Despite this, Kanye has made it onto the ballot for 12 states including Kentucky, where he allegedly spent $400k to get the necessary signatures, and in Iowa, after reportedly paying $80k. </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Kanye's representatives for comment.  </p>

<p>Campaign: According to TMZ, a source at Let the Voters Decide said Kanye has paid them between $3.5 and $4.5 million for them to work across 15 states</p>

<p>Earlier this month, it was reported Kanye spent nearly $6million of his own money on his 2020 presidential campaign since July, records show. </p>

<p>Financial filings with the Federal Election Commission, obtained by Politico, show that West personally loaned his campaign - which kicked off on July 19 - nearly $6.8million. </p>

<p>The filings cover the period from July 15 to August 30. </p>

<p>So far, West has reported spending $5.9million on the campaign and has over $1.2million in outstanding debt, which is owed to consultants. </p>

<p>Not allowed in: The publication claimed Kanye paid $1 million to get 93,000 signatures in Arizona, but a judge is said to have barred him from being on the ballot</p>

<p>The filing also indicated that he has received about $11,000 in outside contributions to the campaign. </p>

<p>Most of the campaign expenses - amounting to $4.4million - were reported to have been spent on trying to get West onto ballots across the country.  </p>

<p>West, who is running as a third-party candidate with the 'Birthday Party,' is currently on ballots in 10 states, among them potential battlegrounds like Colorado, Iowa and Minnesota, CNN reported.</p>

<p>He is said to have litigation pending in other states. At the moment, though, even if he carried the states in which he is on the ballot, he would not have enough electoral college votes to win. </p>

<p>The bulk of West's other expenses were reported to be paid to consulting firms. </p>

<p>His campaign said that they had paid nearly $1.3million to Atlas Strategy Group, run by Republican Gregg Keller, who worked on campaigns for Republicans including President George W. Bush and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.</p>

<p>An additional $2.6million is being paid to Millennial Strategies, which says it worked with Democrats including Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign and New York City public advocate Jumaane Williams' campaign. </p>

<p>The campaign said that it was spending $444,000 with the company for polling.</p>

<p>Some success: The same thing happened in Ohio and Virginia, but he made it on the ballot for 12 states including Kentucky, where he allegedly spent $400k to get the necessary signatures  </p>

<p>West's campaign is also spending about $1.5million with Fortified Consulting in Arizona, which Politico said has the same mailing address as Lincoln Strategy Group's Arizona headquarters. </p>

<p>Lincoln Strategy Group worked on President Trump’s 2016 campaign, in addition with other Republicans, the news outlet reported. </p>

<p>West was reported to have spent more than $260,000 in legal fees while trying to get onto state ballots. Among his legal efforts is asking the Arizona Supreme Court to reverse the ruling that keeps him off the state's ballot.</p>

<p>West is a registered Republican and is therefore not allowed to be on the same ballot as Donald Trump, the Hollywood Reporter said.  </p>

<p>Big bucks: Earlier this month, it was reported Kanye spent nearly $6million of his own money on his 2020 presidential campaign since July, records show</p>

<p>West made headlines after he cried as he told people at his South Carolina campaign launch event that he and wife Kim Kardashian discussed aborting their first child after learning Kardashian was pregnant. </p>

<p>On Friday it was reported Kim is feeling powerless amid husband Kanye's continuing erratic behaviour.</p>

<p>After a flurry of troubling tweets this week - some of which resulted in Twitter suspending his account for 24 hours - the 43-year-old rapper raised concerns even more on Friday as he posted a message about 'going to war' and his fears of being murdered.</p>

<p>Just two months after Kim and Kanye had marriage crisis talks in Wyoming, it seems that again the 39-year-old Kardashian is struggling to keep her marriage together as sources revealed Friday she's 'at the end of her rope'.</p>

<p>Candid: West made headlines after he cried as he told people at his South Carolina campaign launch event that he and wife Kim Kardashian discussed aborting their first child</p>

<p>Family: Kanye and Kim wed in 2014 and share four children together, daughters North, seven, and Chicago, two, and sons Saint, five, and Psalm, one</p>

<p>'He's off his meds,' an insider told PEOPLE. 'He promised he'd stay on them. The last time, part of his negotiation with Kim was that he'd get back on his medication and he would work very hard to control his impulses. </p>

<p>'He made a lot of promises. And now those promises are broken, less than a month later.' they added.</p>

<p>Kanye and Kim wed in 2014 and share four children together, daughters North, seven, and Chicago, two, and sons Saint, five, and Psalm, one. </p>

<p>The E! star was apparently taken aback by Kanye's latest tweets and wants him to 'take care of his own health'. </p>

<p>'He's off his meds': On Friday, Kim was said to be 'at the end of her rope' and felt powerless to help husband Kanye amid his latest tweetstorm</p>

<p>Struggle: A source said of the couple, 'It's the same thing over and over and over again. He's on very thin ice with her right now, and she's truly trying to decide what to do to protect the kids'</p>

<p>'She can't force feed him medication. She can't make him do anything he doesn't want to do.' the source added. </p>

<p>Early Friday morning Kanye concerned fans as he shared - and then deleted - a troubling tweet in which he expressed paranoia about being murdered and having his eldest daughter taken away from him.</p>

<p>'NORTHY I AM GOING TO WAR AND PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE AND IF I AM MURDERED DON'T EVER LET WHITE MEDIA TELL YOU I WASNT A GOOD MAN... WHEN PEOPLE THREATEN TO TAKE YOU OUT OF MY LIFE JUST KNOW I LOVE YOU.' he wrote.</p>

<p>Along with the message Kanye shared a photo of his eldest daughter looking playful and throwing up two peace signs. </p>

<p>Disturbing: Kanye posted and deleted this message on Twitter early on Friday morning, and Kim is said to want him to 'take care of his own health' as she can't 'force feed him medication'</p>

<p>The couple seemed to be back on track last month as they took a make-or-break vacation together with their kids to the Dominican Republic and then camping in Colorado. </p>

<p>Before the trip, Kim addressed her husband's mental health in a length Instagram message, asking fans for compassion.</p>

<p>'Those that understand mental illness or even compulsive behaviour know that the family is powerless unless the member is a minor.' she wrote. </p>

<p>We are not afraid: Friday saw more tweets from Kanye as he talked up his Yeezy academy</p>

<p>'He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bipolar disorder, </p>

<p>'Living with bipolar disorder does not diminish or invalidate his dreams and his creative ideas, no matter how big or unobtainable they may feel to some.</p>

<p>'That is part of his genius and as we have all witnessed, many of his big dreams have come true.' </p>

<p>Complicated: Earlier this year Kim asked for compassion when Kanye's bipolar disorder caused an emotional outburst at a presidential rally in July followed by Twitter outbursts</p>

<p>Compassion and empathy: It was the first time the reality star had spoken at length about the rapper's mental health</p>
