<p>She told KPIX-TV: 'One of the raccoons started coming out of the bridge and started coming at us. </p>

<p>There was a rise in the number of raccoon sightings in the area three years ago and now they appear to becoming bolder</p>

<p>San Francisco City College professor and urban wildlife expert Matthew Schweitzer told SFist that raccoons gather in packs to beg for food and often become aggressive. </p>
