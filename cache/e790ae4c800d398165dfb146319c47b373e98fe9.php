<p>Matthew Grant Kuchel, 46, faced the District Court on August 28 charged with dissemination of child exploitation material, one aggravated, after sending four disturbing videos to the detective in June, 2019. </p>

<p>Judge Paul Cuthbertson accepted Kuchel's claim he had no interest in child porn but said his offending was still very serious, The Australian reported</p>

<p>'I think it probable that the offender does not have an interest in child sex or sex involving animals,' Judge Cuthbertson said. </p>

<p>'Nevertheless, it is a serious offence to perpetuate the type of offending which must have occurred in order to make the videos by trading them within the community.</p>

<p>'It involves serious sexual offences against minors committed by the persons responsible for the videos and perpetuated by the offender.'</p>

<p>The judge said a history of drug abuse had likely impacted Kuchel's inhibitions.</p>

<p>'He struggles with significant drug use during his adult life. The use of drugs disinhibited him and in addition, there was a propensity for hyposexuality,' he said. </p>

<p>Kuchel was sentenced to nine months jail, reduced to eight months and seven days to take into account time he has already served. </p>
