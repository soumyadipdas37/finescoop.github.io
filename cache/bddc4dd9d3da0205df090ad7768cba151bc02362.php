<p>Cat and husband Patrick recently relocated to the UK after living in Los Angeles for 14 years, where she hosted US series So You Think You Can Dance?</p>

<p>Speaking about her move to the US, she said: 'I think the thing that would surprise the young me about her future is what's happened in America.</p>

<p>'I mean, I never went to America when I was a kid. I never went to Disneyland or anything like that, I'd never even seen it before.</p>

<p>'And when I did go, I never made a great proclamation: ''I'm going to crack America.''</p>

<p>'A relationship had just ended and I just fancied a fun adventure. It did feel crazy at times... There's no way my 16-year-old self would believe me if I went back and told her she'll be there one day.'</p>

<p>Happy: Cat and Patrick headed out and about with their family for the day to enjoy the warm sunshine</p>

<p>The veteran host also recently confirmed that she will be reuniting with her SMTV co-hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly for a one-off special looking back at the beloved Saturday morning show. </p>

<p>The presenter told The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X that she's already filmed the special and it will air at the end of the year.</p>

<p>'I can confirm… yes.' Cat teased, when asked about it by Chris. 'We have filmed a documentary, it's going to be aired at the end of the year.</p>

<p>'We went back to the studio where we did it. They rebuilt the set. We all cried. I walked in and [Ant &amp; Dec] were doing their interview and Dec was crying and I was like ''ok you're crying!'' and then at the end of my interview I was like [sobs] ''waaah!'' </p>

<p>Off we go! The family later sat down for lunch in a pub before heading home together</p>
