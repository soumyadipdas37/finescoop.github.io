<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It was no fluke, then.</p>

<p>Torquay B&amp;B 'The 25' has been crowned the best in the world in the Tripadvisor Travellers' Choice Awards – again.</p>

<p>The boutique adults-only inn achieved the coveted accolade in 2019. This year it stands as a winner alongside the likes of Viroth's Hotel in Cambodia, named the 2020 top hotel in the world, three-Michelin-star Auberge Du Vieux Puits in southern France – rated the best fine-dining restaurant on the planet - and Baros Maldives, the top lodge globally for luxury.</p>

<p>This image shows the newest room at The 25 - the Shoalstone Suite, which costs from £189. It even has its own YouTube video</p>

<p>Guests at The 25 enjoy rooms with power showers, an Amazon Alexa control system, mood lighting, air conditioning and a heated mist-free bathroom mirror</p>

<p>Andy and Julian - who have been described as 'the perfect hosts' - celebrate their 2020 Tripadvisor gong</p>

<p>Andy Banner-Price, co-owner of The 25, said: 'It's an incredible feeling to be named the best B&amp;B in the world for the second year running. </p>

<p>'If anything, the second time feels even more special because we know last year's award raised customer expectations and so we've had to work even harder to deliver a great experience for every single one of our guests.</p>

<p>'We didn't rest on our laurels, we've tried to look at every little thing we can do to improve, and it feels like that effort has really paid off with this news today.'</p>
