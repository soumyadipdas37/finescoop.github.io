<p>The same cannot be said of the club's players, which is just as well as the subtitled version is due to be released over the coming months and needs promoting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mourinho and his players have moved back into their usual dressing room having used the cavernous NFL equivalent so far during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Relations between Liverpool and Manchester City have been tested of late, and former Reds manager Roy Evans did little to improve things when he was commentating on the Under 18s clash between the two clubs on Saturday.</p>

<p>The 71-year-old stated: 'Not many normal names, is there?' after his fellow commentator described a shot from City's England youth international Darko Gyabi during the visitors' 3-1 victory at Liverpool's academy.</p>

<p>The 16-year-old, from Catford, is viewed as one of the most exciting prospects in City's ranks.</p>

<p>At least Evans and Liverpool reacted quickly. The ex-manager reached out to the youngster's agent to say sorry, while the club wrote to City to apologise on behalf of themselves and LFCTV.</p>

<p>Nobody can accuse John Stones of failing to take his fight for a place in the Manchester City team seriously. The centre half suffered from a loss of form last season and ended up playing in just 16 Premier League matches.</p>

<p>Stones, who started City's first match of the campaign but missed out against Leicester, has applied for planning permission for a gym extension at his Cheshire home.</p>

<p>The ex-Everton man has been blighted by a couple of injuries and his new addition will boast rowing, running and cycling machines to go with the swimming pool and sauna.</p>

<p>Jermaine Beckford was late for his slot on talkSPORT for the Sheffield United v Leeds United Yorkshire derby — but his lack of punctuality was for a good reason.</p>

<p>On his way to Bramall Lane, the 36-year-old saw an elderly lady suffer a nasty fall, so he stopped to offer help. </p>

<p>Beckford, despite his pressing appointment, remained with the lady until the emergency services arrived. The striker was late for the programme but did make it in time for kick-off. Bravo.</p>

<p>When Ollie Watkins secured his £33million move from Brentford to Aston Villa, he couldn't leave the capital without saying goodbye to one particular fan.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old headed to 21&amp;Co, a parent-run charity in Surrey and south-west London which supports children with Down's syndrome and their families.</p>

<p>Watkins is idolised by a young chap named Woody, who is a member of the group, and has regularly spent time with him.</p>

<p>When he found out Watkins was leaving, Woody packed a lunch and wanted to go with him.</p>

<p>Watkins made the time to go to say goodbye and to soften the blow of his departure. 'Look after him, Brummies,' the group said. 'He is a real treasure.'</p>

<p>Much back-slapping at the BBC after the broadcaster televised the T20 international between England women and West Indies on Saturday.</p>

<p>It was the first time women's cricket had been live on the Beeb since 1993 — an embarrassing run that was quite rightly brought to a close. </p>

<p>However, what was not shouted from the rooftops was that the women's road race at the World Championships was relegated to the red button to make way for it. </p>

<p>The men's race aired on BBC2 with highlights of the women's race shown in a 40-minute programme later on.</p>

<p>England's T20 against West Indies was the first women's cricket on the BBC since 1993</p>

<p>Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has put his house up for sale. </p>

<p>Back in January the residence, in Knutsford, Cheshire, was targeted by a group of angry supporters who launched paint, a smoke bomb and a flare at the building. Police investigated but took no further action. </p>

<p>The five-bedroom pad is valued at £2m, just more than half of the £3.9m ex-United striker Paul Scholes is seeking for his mansion, in Saddleworth, Oldham.</p>

<p>It wasn't only Formula One bosses who were caught unawares by Lewis Hamilton's decision to wear a campaigning T-shirt on the podium at the recent Tuscan Grand Prix — but his own Mercedes team.</p>

<p>Sports Agenda understands that the world champion team's hapless PR department privately admit they have no say in what their star man wears or says, and are wary of laying down the law for fear he will react by adopting the opposite line.</p>

<p>This is not what sponsors wish to hear, especially as Hamilton's T-shirt — calling for the police who shot and killed Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, to be arrested — took the place of the race suit displaying their logos.</p>

<p>'Some of the sponsors were unhappy,' one source confided.</p>

<p>The Jockey Club have backed calls for state financial support following the Government's U-turn on allowing limited numbers of fans to attend events from October.</p>

<p>Nevin Truesdale, group chief executive, spoke of the sport's survival being under threat and called on Boris Johnson to provide a financial injection along the lines of the £1.57billion given to the arts.</p>

<p>There was, however, no mention of the staging of this year's Cheltenham, which many believe helped spread the virus throughout the country. The event, at The Jockey Club-owned course, may well have been at the forefront of the Government's thinking as they pulled the plug on the planned return.</p>

<p>The Tokyo Olympics are fast becoming the cursed games. Organisers have already had to deal with a postponement and, in all likelihood, will have to find somewhere fit to build a biosecure bubble for thousands of athletes.</p>

<p>Now, new details of alleged corrupt payments to disgraced former IAAF president Lamine Diack, sentenced to two years in prison, have emerged.</p>

<p>The bidding process remains under investigation by French authorities and sources have disclosed that there are fears further revelations could tip sponsors over the edge.</p>
