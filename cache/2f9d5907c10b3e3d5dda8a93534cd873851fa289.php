<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The BBC's new director-general is 'open' to implementing a subscription model to replace the broadcaster's licence fee, it was reported last night</p>

<p>Tim Davie has reportedly been told to come up with a viable funding model to replace the fee when he takes up his new role this week.</p>

<p>A Conservative minister told the Daily Telegraph that there is a 'real optimism' at the BBC that it can thrive without the fee.</p>

<p>Among the measures reportedly being considered by Mr Davie, 53, is a subscription model service, similar to Netflix or Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>The minister told the Telegraph: 'There is a real optimism that the BBC will come up with a palatable alternative to the licence fee themselves.</p>

<p>'Tim Davie seems open to the idea of a subscription model.'</p>

<p>If Mr Davie is unable to come up with a viable model, he risks facing a battle when the BBC charter is renewed in 2027.</p>

<p>It is understood that Mr Davie will not address the licence fee row when he makes his first speech in his new role later this week.</p>

<p>But BBC insiders told the Telegraph that Mr Davie is concerned the broadcaster is creating too much left-wing, London-centric content.</p>

<p>Mr Davie is also planning to launch a crackdown on BBC presenters who express their opinions on social media, according to the reports.</p>

<p>It came amid reports that ministers are set to announce the decriminalisation of the licence fee within weeks.</p>

<p>From 2022, people who dodge their licence fee payments will face civil penalties rather than criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>The BBC Licence Fee (Civil Penalty) Bill is due for its second reading in parliament in November.</p>

<p>A BBC spokesman told the Telegraph: 'The licence fee is a way of funding the BBC until at least 2027 and our focus is on providing the best possible value to the public who pay for us.'Â </p>
