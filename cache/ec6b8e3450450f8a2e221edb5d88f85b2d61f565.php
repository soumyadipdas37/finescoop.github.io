<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The CEO who was caught on camera viciously beating his four-month-old puppy has apologizes for losing his temper and taking 'unreasonable and unjustifiable action' as his brother has defended him and insisted he was simply disciplining the pooch for peeing on a rug.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Previte, 46, was slammed this week after DailyMail.com published footage of him thrashing and choking his dog Bici outside his apartment in the Seychelle Condominiums building in Santa Monica, California.</p>

<p>In an apology to colleagues and friends, Jeffrey wrote: ' I want everyone to know that I truly regret my actions on August 22, 2020. Words can't fully describe how sorry I am for what happened. </p>

<p>'I lost my temper and took unreasonable and unjustifiable action in attempting to discipline my dog Bici. As I have said, words are not enough here, Bici is no longer living with me and is with another loving family. I have also stepped away from my job and am enrolling in anger management training.'</p>

<p> Now his brother Nolan Previte, who with Jeffrey is co-CEO of EBI Consulting, has leapt to his defense in an email to the siblings' employees.</p>

<p>In an email sent to EBI Consulting employees on Friday and obtained by DailyMail.com, Nolan defended Jeffrey by saying the August 22nd beating was simply 'zealous discipline of the dog for peeing the rug'.</p>

<p>Nolan, 50, insisted his brother is 'kindhearted', denied he had any abusive tendencies and claimed Jeffrey 'deeply cares' for the pooch he was filmed beating. </p>

<p>Santa Monica police confirmed they were aware of the sickening video and are currently investigating it as a possible incident of animal abuse. </p>

<p>Previte, 46, was slammed this week after DailyMail.com published footage of him thrashing and choking his dog Bici outside his apartment in the Seychelle Condominiums building in Santa Monica, California</p>

<p>Santa Monica police confirmed they were aware of the sickening video and are currently investigating it as a possible incident of animal abuse </p>

<p>Nolan wrote: 'Please trust me here, Jeff certainly regrets the zealous discipline of the dog for peeing the rug, but I assure you this is absolute nonsense.</p>

<p>'He's an extremely kindhearted, sensitive, caring and thoughtful person with zero cruel or abusive tendencies. He's truly the opposite of cruel or abusive.</p>

<p>'And he deeply cares for Bici, as anyone who's actually seen him with the dog would attest.'</p>

<p>Nolan went on to claim that the dog was 'living the life'.</p>

<p>I want everyone to know that I truly regret my actions on August 22, 2020. Words can't fully describe how sorry I am for what happened. I lost my temper and took unreasonable and unjustifiable action in attempting to discipline my dog Bici. As I have said, words are not enough here, Bici is no longer living with me and is with another loving family. I have also stepped away from my job and am enrolling in anger management training. Additionally, I am making financial contributions and looking to dedicate my time to support animal rights organizations. I own this. It is not who I am and not representative of the quality time my dog Bici and I have spent together. I am sorry first and foremost to my dog, Bici is the best dog in the world. I also apologize to all who have been understandably upset by this. I love Bici and we have had an exceptional life full of affection and I already miss my companion. I am an imperfect person, but hope that maybe in time I will earn some level of forgiveness.</p>

<p>As part of accepting responsibility, I have taken a leave of absence from my job. As you know, I am part of a family business and my actions are in no way reflective of the values of my family or my colleagues. I am heartbroken over the attention my actions have brought to them.</p>

<p>I will work to become a better person and to learn from this.</p>

<p>Fact-box text</p>

<p>He wrote: 'Reality is that Bici has been living the life, on the beach and in the woods with my wife and kids for most of the summer and she's happy, comfy and full on my couch right now.'</p>

<p>Astonishingly Nolan blamed management of the Seychelle Condominiums for the harrowing video.</p>

<p>'This has been weeks in the making,' he wrote, 'including attempted extortion, crazy false accusations, and building management ineptitude.'</p>

<p>The co-CEO of the environmental risk and compliance management consultancy firm ended the email by warning employees not to discuss the dog-beating.</p>

<p>He wrote: 'Thank you for your faith and trust and your help in dealing with this by not talking with anyone but me or Jeff.'</p>

<p>CEO Jeffrey Previte was caught on security camera thrashing his defenseless dog Bici and grabbing the whimpering hound by the throat</p>

<p>A concierge, who has asked to remain anonymous, heard the dog's cries from his seat at the building's front desk and told DailyMail.com he filed a report</p>

<p>The concierge filed a report about the incident to the building's management where he said he felt violated </p>

<p>The brothers were appointed joint CEOs of EBI Consulting last month, a firm which is owned by their family. The company has over 400 employees in offices across the United States and Canada. </p>

<p>The sickening video shows off-duty CEO Previte yanking the dog off the floor by the scruff of its neck and violently jerking the animal through a door before giving it a hard smack.</p>

<p>A concierge, who has asked to remain anonymous, heard the dog's cries from his seat at the building's front desk and filed a report about the incident. </p>

<p>'I heard the dog screaming and when I looked on the camera, I saw him beating the dog,' the concierge said. </p>

<p>The man filed a report about the incident to the building's management and he told Previte he had the footage and was going to write a report.  </p>

<p>'He became irate... and then he hung up on me,' the man said. 'He apologized the next day, but I didn't think it was a sincere apology.'</p>

<p>The concierge filed the report writing: 'At 6.55pm, I witnessed Jeffery [sic] Previte beating his dog.'</p>

<p>'I heard the dog screaming and when I looked on the camera, I saw him beating the dog,' the concierge said</p>

<p>'There's nothing illegal about what I did - I said if you need to tell the building, tell the building,' Previte told DailyMail.com </p>

<p>The attack on the dog took place at his apartment in the Seychelle Condominiums building in Santa Monica, California</p>

<p>In a statement to DailyMail.com. Previte didn't deny that he was rough with the dog but instead claimed that the concierge was extorting him. </p>

<p>'I think this is very unfortunate that this has come across your desk. I don't even know exactly what to say but I will say this: [The concierge] called me the evening of this interaction with my dog and that was at nine o' clock at night and he attempted to extort money from me so that he wouldn't report it to the building.</p>

<p>'There's nothing illegal about what I did - I said if you need to tell the building, tell the building. </p>

<p>'The building manager took it very seriously. I find it very unfortunate that we are even talking about this.'</p>

<p>The concierge explained to DailyMail.com exactly what he saw transpiring on the security screen.</p>

<p>'He was very angry. He was choking and slapping the dog,' he said. 'He even slammed the poor dog against the wall.'</p>

<p>The man claimed that his report was not taken seriously by his manager.</p>

<p>According to Previte's social media, he is an avid hunter and outdoorsman who is the CEO of an environmental risk and compliance management consulting firm</p>

<p>Previte was seen posing with a deer that he appears to have hunted in a 2011 photo on Facebook which he captioned: 'I didn't mean to kill Bambi'</p>

<p>'My boss laughed in my face,' he said. 'I took the next day off work. I just felt that they should have called the police at least.'</p>

<p>The concierge said that Previte has no kids and has lived in the building for about five years.</p>

<p>'He dates strange women that come in and out,' the concierge said of Previte, adding, 'He wears a Make America Great Again hat and he rides bikes. </p>

<p>'He's hardly there - he goes back and forth to Boston. He is probably only there once every two months. You hardly see him. He drives fancy cars and he is in and out.'</p>

<p>The building management said in a statement to DailyMail.com, 'The apparent conduct of the unit owner was abhorrent and completely unacceptable. Building management stands behind our employee and we took swift action including contacting animal control and directing the resident to cease all contact with our employee. We continue to evaluate other measures that can be taken with our counsel.' </p>
