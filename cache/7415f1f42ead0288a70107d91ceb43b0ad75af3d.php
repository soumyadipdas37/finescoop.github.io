<p>Getaway: The beauty also had her impressive holiday tan on display as she larked around in her snorkelling goggles for a series of fun poses</p>

<p>Her social media activity came after her boyfriend Sam told MailOnline when he first met his partner a little over a year ago she 'wasn't happy where she was and never exercised'.</p>

<p>Last August, Zara weighed 10st 7lbs but is now 8st 9lbs, and the media personality said while she was 'always beautiful in my eyes', he can see how much happier she is in herself. </p>

<p>Sam, who has partnered up with Captain Morgan to promote their new Tiki drink, said: 'I think she's in f*****g great shape. When I first met Zara she weighed a lot more and she was not so happy about where she was.</p>

<p>'She was always beautiful': The 23-year-old's boyfriend Sam Thompson recently admitted she 'weighed a lot more and didn't exercise' when they first met (pictured in February)</p>

<p>'She was still beautiful in my eyes- obviously I went out with her didn't I? She looked great either way.  </p>

<p>'She wasn't happy with her lifestyle, her health, she never exercised. She's training a lot and eats more than she ever used to, she just eats healthily.'</p>

<p>Earlier this month, former policy advisor Zara announced she had signed up with Storm Management to further her modelling career. </p>

<p>Zara celebrated her new venture by posting a sizzling snap of herself as she declared her new signing as a 'dream come true'.   </p>

<p>Stunning: It comes after she revealed earlier this month she had signed up with Storm Management to further her modelling career</p>

<p>She wrote: 'I'm excited to announce I have officially signed with <?php echo e('@'); ?>Stormmodels. What a dream come true.' </p>

<p>In her first picture with the company, Zara sported her voluminous tresses in a loose wave and side part.  </p>

<p>Her closest friends and family reposted the picture announcement, congratulating Zara on her big achievement.</p>

<p>Kate Moss left the modelling agency in 2018 after working with them for a whopping 28 years as she decided to manage her work 'in-house' instead.</p>

<p>Career move: Zara reposted the Instagram snap of her signing and wrote: 'I'm excited to announce I have officially signed with <?php echo e('@'); ?>stormmodels. What a dream come true'</p>

<p>The company were the first agency to sign the 14-year-old Kate, and her half-sister Lottie Moss is still signed to them.</p>

<p>The modelling veteran was scouted in 1988 by Storm Management founder Sarah Doukas at JFK airport in New York and had been with the agency since her 2018 departure.  </p>

<p>Cara Delevingne, also left the agency in July 2015 after she said she wanted to focus her attention on her acting career, but stars such as Brooklyn Beckham's ex Hana Cross and the iconic Cindy Crawford are signed with the company.</p>
