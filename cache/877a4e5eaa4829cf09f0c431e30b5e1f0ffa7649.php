<p>The Australian woman bought some frozen calamari from the fish market and cut it into rings.</p>

<p>She then coated the rings in flour, whisked eggs and 'Panko' breadcrumbs, a Japanese-style breadcrumb perfect for deep-fried foods which is available from Coles for $2 a bag.</p>

<p>She also added salt and 'any spice of your choice' to the mix, before cooking the calamari in her $89 Kmart air fryer for just 11 minutes on 200 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>'Panko calamari in air fryer last night, tested one first to get the time right,' the woman called Mads posted.</p>

<p>'Flour, egg wash and panko crumb with some salt and spice of choice. 200 degrees, 11 minutes.'</p>

<p>She added: 'Sat them on top of each other and moved around halfway. I really liked it, crunchy and light with the calamari perfectly cooked!'</p>

</ol>

<p>Hundreds of people who saw Mads' recipe were impressed with the results, and said they couldn't wait to try similar for themselves.</p>

<p>'Thanks so much for the idea. I bought a bag of calamari last week so will try it this weekend,' one commenter posted.</p>

<p>'They look delicious, I love calamari - you did a great job,' another added.</p>

<p>Others made their own suggestions for improving the breadcrumb mix, including garlic and grated Parmesan cheese. </p>

<p>Others shared their own version of the delicious frozen calamari rings at home (the finished result pictured)</p>

<p>This isn't the first deep-fried food home cooks have enjoyed making in their Kmart air fryers.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, another woman shared how she made halloumi fries in a similar way, by coating thick strips of cheese in flour followed by whisked egg and 'Panko' breadcrumbs. </p>

<p>Once the cheese was firmly coated, she left it to cook in an air fryer at 200 degrees Celsius for roughly 10 minutes until the outside turned crisp and golden.</p>

<p>She used a 5.3 litre air fryer which is available from Kmart for $89, but the discount retailer also stocks cheaper versions including a 1.5 litre for $49 and a 3.2 litre for $69.</p>
