<p>Nearly half of hospital Trusts continue to ban partners from attending either labour or scans, or both, because of draconian Covid-19 rules.</p>

<p>This newspaper is campaigning to end the scandal, which has left women to give birth or receive devastating news of miscarriages without support.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said it is of 'upmost importance' that every hospital allows partners to be present in what are 'incredibly special moments in people's lives'.</p>

<p>The Government has published guidelines on how hospitals can safely do this, but many Trusts are refusing to implement it. Mr Johnson told The Mail on Sunday: 'No woman should have to go through labour alone without the support of partners or loved ones.'</p>

<p>The chief midwife will be putting more pressure on hospitals that continue to ban partners from attending.</p>

<p>But former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says more action is needed to ensure all NHS trusts change their policies.</p>

<p>Writing in today's Mail on Sunday, he says: 'I don't think a voluntary framework will end the arbitrary way these rules are being applied by some hospitals. A postcode lottery is unacceptable.'</p>

<p>A petition to allow partners at all stages of labour into all hospitals has attracted more than 418,000 signatures. Joeli Brearley of campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed said: 'Pregnant women must be a priority considering the impact stress has on a growing foetus.'</p>
