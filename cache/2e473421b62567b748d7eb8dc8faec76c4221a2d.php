<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kourtney Kardashian and her youngest son Reign were out and about in Los Angeles on Tuesday as he helped her run errands around the city.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was dressed casually for her day out, while her five-year-old son matched her low-key attire.</p>

<p>The Poosh founder covered up her trim figure in a baggy black Billy Joe's Ribworks T-shirt, which she wore partially tucked in.</p>

<p>Taking care of business: Kourtney Kardashian, 41, looked casual in a Billy Joe's Ribworks T-short and frayed white shorts as she and her son Reign, five, ran errands around Los Angeles</p>

<p>Kourtney paired it with a set of white cutoff jeans that were frayed at the edges.</p>

<p>Like much of her family, she repped her brother-in-law Kanye West with a pair of his sporty Yeezy trainers in gray, white and black with orange accents. </p>

<p>The 5ft1in reality star wore her raven locks tied up in a top knot, and she wore a pair of slim black sunglasses that are popular with her sisters.</p>

<p>Reign looked cute in a Mickey Mouse baseball shirt and tan shorts. </p>

<p>Helping out: Reign looked cute in a Mickey Mouse baseball shirt and tan shorts, and he still sported the mohawk he got after cutting off his long hair</p>

<p>The son of Scott Disick also sported his recent mohawk, which he had styled after initially cutting off his long hair.</p>

<p>Like his mother, Reign wore a pair of Yeezy shoes, though he favored a set of cream-colored Slides.</p>

<p>His mother was careful to wear a black cloth mask to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but Reign didn't wear one while in the business.</p>

<p>Afterward, Kourtney and her son headed into the parking garage to pick up their car.</p>

<p>Kourtney was looking at her most casual while taking care of business, but later on Tuesday she shared a more flirtatious photo of herself and the Kardashian–Jenner family friend Fai Khadra.</p>

<p>The nighttime snap showed Fai, who was dressed in a stylish gray suit, lifting Kourtney up in his arms as she popped up one leg.</p>

<p>The reality star was attired in a black leather dress and wore a pair of tall black open-toe heels that strapped up above her ankles.</p>

<p>Missing from Kourtney's outing were her other two children, Mason, 10, and Penelope, eight, as well as her ex Scott Disick, 37, who has been spending more time with his children lately following his split from Sofia Richie over the summer.</p>

<p>Kourtney was out and about following news that her series Keeping Up With The Kardashians would finally come to an end in 2021 after airing its 20th season.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, a Page Six report alleged Kourtney's younger sister Khloé, as well as Scott, were the main holdouts against the cancellation of the show.</p>

<p>An insider explained of the two: 'Some of them needed the money more than others.'   </p>

<p>The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for everyone and that they made the decision together.</p>

<p>MIA: Missing from the outing were Kourtney's kids Mason, 10, and Penelope, eight, as well as their father Scott Disick, 37, who has been spending more time with the family recently</p>

<p>Their denial came after a source told The Sun, 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements — she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.</p>

<p>'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on — he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show,' they continued.</p>

<p>However, a different insider claimed to the publication that the Kardashian–Jenner clan jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.</p>
