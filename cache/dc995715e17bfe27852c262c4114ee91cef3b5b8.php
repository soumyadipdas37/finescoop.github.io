<p>The president shared his stark assessment with the Washington Post's Bob Woodward in recorded phone interviews in February, as the virus was spreading from China to other parts of the world. </p>

<p>'This is deadly stuff,' the president told the Watergate reporter, Washington fixture and author who has interviewed U.S. presidents going back to Nixon. </p>

<p>'You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed,' Trump told him in a Feb. 7 call. 'And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flu.'</p>

<p>Trump had been briefed on the virus in the Oval Office Jan. 28th, as Washington Post excerpts describe. </p>

<p>National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien warned him: 'This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,' according to Woodward.</p>

<p>He told the nation Feb. 2: 'Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China.' </p>

<p>Trump continued: 'Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help!' </p>
