<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A spaniel has been rescued by a lifeboat after chasing a flock of seagulls half a mile out to sea.</p>

<p>The dog ran away from its owner and into the sea off the coast of Rhyl, Wales, just before 9am on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Rhyl coastguard launched a lifeboat 11 minutes after the call was made and filmed the moment it picked the tired pup out of the water.</p>

<p>The dog was found off the new SC2 waterpark site to the west of the town, reported North Wales Live. </p>

<p>Its owner was told to stay on the beach and not attempt to rescue his stricken dog.  </p>

<p>The dozy dog ran away from its owner and into the sea off the coast of Rhyl, Wales, just before 9am on Monday morning</p>

<p>Footage filmed from the lifeboat and posted on the RNLI Twitter page showed a rescuer tell the dog 'you're not supposed to be this far out'.</p>

<p>He then whistled and said 'come here', encouraging the dog to paddle closer to the boat.</p>

<p>The video cuts to the moment the dog was close enough for a rescuer to pull it into the vessel.</p>

<p>He said: 'Come here. What are you doing?'</p>

<p>Once the dog was inside the boat, the team radioed to tell the coastguard the dog was on board. </p>

<p>At the end of the video the dog's owner held tightly onto the spaniel's collar as he thanked the team that rescued it</p>

<p>Martin Jones, RNLI Coxswain for Rhyl's RNLI Lifeboat, said: 'There was initial worry the owner would attempt to rescue the dog, but on the coastguard's advice, remained on the beach, keeping the dog in sight.</p>

<p>'We are so happy the animal and it's owner are reunited.' </p>
