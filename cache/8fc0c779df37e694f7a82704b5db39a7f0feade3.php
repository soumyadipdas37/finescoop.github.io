<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris Saint-Germain have rejected the chance to sign Matteo Guendouzi from Arsenal according to reports.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old Frenchman has been absent from the Gunners squad following ugly scenes involving Brighton striker Neal Maupay in their defeat at the Amex last season following the restart after falling out with boss Mikel Arteta.</p>

<p>That appears to have continued into this season after he was left out of the FA Cup holders' Community Shield victory against Liverpool on Saturday at Wembley.</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain have rejected the chance to sign Matteo Guendouzi from Arsenal</p>

<p>But the Ligue 1 champions won't be signing Guendouzi according to the Telegraph as they set their sights on another Arsenal player - Hector Bellerin. </p>

<p>Thomas Tuchel's side have opened talks with Arsenal over a £30million move for Spanish right back Bellerin.</p>

<p>The north London club do not wish to lose the 25-year old but recognise any substantial fee could be utilised to strengthen the squad elsewhere.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old Frenchman had a falling out with boss Mikel Arteta against Brighton in June</p>

<p>Juventus and Bayern Munich are also among Bellerin's admirers but PSG have made the first move.</p>

<p>Bellerin is under contract until 2023 but is open to a new challenge.</p>

<p>PSG have been long term admirers and persistent in their pursuit. They have proposed £25m with a further £5m in add ons.</p>

<p>Arsenal value him higher than that and talks will continue. Bellerin’s departure could pave the way for Ainsley Maitland-Niles to stay.</p>
