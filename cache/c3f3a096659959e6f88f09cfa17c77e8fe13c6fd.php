<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dawid Malan has risen to No 1 in the Twenty20 international batting rankings following England's 2-1 series win over Australia.</p>

<p>Yorkshire batsman Malan jumped four places in the ratings after stacking up 129 runs, including a man-of-the-match 66 in the opening match of three at the Ageas Bowl.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old is eight points ahead of Pakistan's Babar Azam, in a list that includes Indian superstar Virat Kohli in ninth place and England's World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan in 10th.</p>

<p>Dawid Malan has jumped four places to become top of the international T20 batting rankings</p>

<p>Adil Rashid, Malan's county colleague, has moved up to seventh from ninth following another fine white-ball series in which he took six wickets.</p>

<p>England have strengthened their second-placed position, improving their ranking by three points by virtue of defeating the No 1-ranked team - although they would have taken over at the summit themselves had they avoided defeat in the series finale on Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Malan's achievement is all the more remarkable given that he is not guaranteed a place in England's best XI - he was omitted on the tour of South Africa earlier this year and would likely be ousted again when Jason Roy and Ben Stokes are available.</p>

<p>India captain Virat Kohli ranks ninth in the batting rankings, one place ahead of Eoin Morgan</p>

<p>'When you get limited opportunities, you have to make full use of them,' said a player who has passed 50 in exactly half of his 16 T20 international innings.</p>

<p>'So to do that when you're under pressure is very satisfying. For anyone to break in to this team, you have to be extremely consistent and win games of cricket for England.'</p>
