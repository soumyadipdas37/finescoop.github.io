<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tariq Lamptey's decision to switch international allegiances to Ghana will not be down to him giving up on his England chances, insists Brighton boss Graham Potter.</p>

<p>The Londoner, born to Ghanian parents, is braced for a difficult decision with the Black Stars governing body in talks with the player.</p>

<p>Lamptey currently represents England at Under-20 level but remains eligible to feature for Ghana as he has not made a senior competitive appearance for The Three Lions.</p>

<p>England Under-20 star Tariq Lamptes has considered representing Ghana at international level</p>

<p>And despite Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kieran Trippier, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Kyle Walker and Reece James all vying for the England right-back spot, Potter doesn't believe Lamptey is fazed by the competition.</p>

<p>'He's certainly not a person who would give up on anything,' he explained.</p>

<p>'Then it's about him and his family and what the right decision for him is.</p>

<p>'Whatever decision he makes I would fully support and try to help him achieve his goals.</p>

<p>'But as a person, as a character, he's a top guy. He's not one that will give up, that's for sure.'</p>

<p>Graham Potter says he will 'fully support' the full-back, no matter what his decision is</p>

<p>Potter agrees that the appeal of playing full-back has significantly improved in recent years, with the number of options available to Southgate coming as no great surprise.</p>

<p>'It is a little bit of how the game has evolved. Sometimes the width often comes from full-backs rather than wingers,' he added.</p>

<p>'At the moment there is a glut of quality full-backs. Gareth has got a lot options there.</p>

<p>'We are happy with Tariq, we are happy with the other options we have got, and we want to try to improve.'</p>

<p>The impressive Lamptey is expected to start for Brighton in Sunday's match against Newcastle at St. James' Park.</p>
