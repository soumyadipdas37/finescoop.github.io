<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who assumed she was gaining weight because she was eating too many snacks during lockdown is celebrating the birth of her beautiful baby boy - after discovering she was pregnant just an hour before he arrived.</p>

<p>Tasha Davies, 28, and her partner, Martin Hern, 29, from Wigan, Lancashire, were unaware that they were expecting a child until their healthy son Alexander Isaac Gohan Hern, arrived weighing 9lb 7oz on Tuesday 1 September at 7.30am. </p>

<p>Just over an hour earlier at 6am, the new mum had been admitted to Wigan Infirmary after suffering severe stomach pains during the previous night.</p>

<p>Tasha and Martin were both in shock to discover that she was experiencing the symptoms because she was in labour. </p>

<p>Tasha Davies, 28, is celebrating the birth of her son Alexander Isaac Gohan Hern (pictured), after discovering she was pregnant just one hour before his arrival </p>

<p>Tasha who has been in a relationship with Martin Hern, 29, (pictured) for three years, was admitted to Wigan Infirmary because of severe stomach pains</p>

<p>The couple who have been together for three years, were gobsmacked by their new arrival.</p>

<p>Tasha said: 'It was just such a mixture of shock and surprise. I didn't have any morning sickness and experienced no symptoms at all.</p>

<p>'Right towards the very end, about 24 hours before he came, my belly became really bloated.</p>

<p>'But by then I was getting severe stomach pains and hadn't passed water for 24 hours so we thought there was something really wrong.</p>

<p>'It was really scary - about 3am the night before I started hyperventilating and that's when the pain really kicked in.</p>

<p>'I think that's when the contractions started but, of course, we didn't know.'</p>

<p>Tasha added: 'When we arrived at the hospital, the nurses asked about whether I could be pregnant and I said no.</p>

<p>The couple had bought a new house (pictured) just days before the unexpected birth of their son Alexander </p>

<p>Tasha told nurses at the hospital that her stomach pains couldn't be due to pregnancy, having continued to experience periods throughout. Pictured: Newborn, Alexander Isaac Gohan Hern</p>

<p>'But then they said they were going to do a test and the possibility started to sink in.</p>

<p>'We were just in absolute shock when he arrived.'</p>

<p>Tasha and Martin had bought a new house on Friday 28 August, but little did they know they would be bringing home a newborn a few days later.</p>

<p>Martin has spent the past few days rushing around to get all of the essentials while he waits for mother and baby to come from hospital, later this afternoon.</p>

<p>Martin said: 'I honestly didn't know what to think when we went to the hospital.</p>

<p>'Tasha was seen by a triage nurse and wheeled away to be treated, and I waited in a corridor.</p>

<p>Martin who has been rushing around to buy essentials for Alexander (pictured), said finding out they were having a baby was surreal </p>

<p>'Fifteen minutes later a nurse came, shouted my name and said Tasha had gone into labour and they were taking her to the delivery suite.</p>

<p>'It was so surreal. I went to bed that night thinking I was going to pick up a washer-dryer. Instead I was going to the hospital to find out I was having a baby boy.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I've been rushing around everywhere to buy things - I've got a Moses basket, clothes, nappies, the works.</p>

<p>'The hospital has given us all the packs of information we should have got throughout the nine months - we've got a lot of reading to do.'</p>

<p>During the 41 weeks she was pregnant, Tasha, a paralegal, had no idea she was carrying a baby boy and had continued having periods.</p>

<p>Tasha (pictured) said she put her weight gain down to snacking without doing any exercise throughout lockdown</p>

<p>She also put her weight gain down to coronavirus lockdown snacking.</p>

<p>She said: 'I've been working really long hours from home during lockdown, have been snacking a lot and haven't been going to the gym or doing any real exercise at all.</p>

<p>'I just put the extra weight down to that.'</p>

<p>Tasha was due to return to work as a paralegal on Tuesday after being on annual leave, but instead Martin called to tell her colleagues she had become a mum.</p>

<p>Speaking of the new mum, he said: 'Tasha has been brilliant. She's taken to it so well - she's absolutely great with him.</p>

<p>'I can't wait to get them home now - she wants to be out of hospital and we can't wait to start our lives as a new, little family of three.'</p>

<p>Tasha who is a paralegal was due to return to work on Tuesday, however Martin had to inform her employers that she's become a mother. Pictured: Newborn, Alexander </p>

<p>Martin said he's looking forward to starting their new lives as a family of three, with Tasha and Alexander (pictured) expected to leave hospital today</p>
