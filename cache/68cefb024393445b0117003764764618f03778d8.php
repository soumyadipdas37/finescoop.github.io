<p>It is not known where the photos were taken as he has not been seen since sailing from the port of Calvi last Sunday</p>

<p>The 32-year-old is subject to an investigation after a woman claimed he had exposed himself at the entrance to the unisex toilets at the L'Amphi bar in the harbour of the popular resort.</p>

<p>He was held in custody for a night before being released.</p>

<p>His lawyer Emamanuelle Ramond has said he 'vigorously denies' the allegations.</p>

<p>The series of photos were uploaded to McGregor's official Instagram account.</p>

<p>He had earlier been pictured working out in Corsica having been spotted on the dock in Calvi stretching in a pair of swimming shorts while watched over by a training partner.</p>

<p>McGregor, who got engaged to 33-year-old Dee Devlin last month, is accused of showing off his manhood and then assaulting a woman following a heavy drinking session in the town on September 6. </p>

<p>McGregor was presented with a summons and spent two days in custody before he was released without charge on Saturday.</p>

<p>The fighter is now waiting for the results of 'key physical tests' and 'the examination of film evidence' before learning whether he will be re-arrested.</p>

<p>The Dubliner made a rambling since-deleted Facebook post on Monday in which he claimed that the 'truth will set me free' and vowed 'I'll never kill myself' after he received abuse online.  </p>

<p>The retired 32-year-old MMA fighter said various allegations made against him were set ups but vowed he will 'never fold' in a Facebook post on Monday</p>

<p>The Facebook post read: 'I will never kill myself no matter how many wish for it. Try set me up all yous f****** want over and over and over the truth will always set me free!' </p>

<p>It went on: 'Never will I fold! The truth is the truth and it gives me wings! I know my character! God bless DNA! God bless Cctv! God bless Eye witness! God bless the truth!</p>

<p>'The truth is power! I am free!</p>

<p>'Never will a dime be paid to anyone coming at me with vicious lies! Not now not f****** ever!</p>

<p>'I will fight! And I am only beginning my fight!</p>

<p>'I will not allow these people to just accuse me and then disappear into the dark to attempt to ruin someone else's life! No f****** way!'</p>

<p>A friend of the alleged victim told broadcaster France 3 Corse that McGregor 'exhibited his privates' to the woman as she made her way to the toilets of the bar. </p>

<p>The alleged assault – vigorously denied by McGregor's Calvi based lawyer – took place at the entrance.</p>

<p>Staff at L'Amphi claimed to have no knowledge of the incident, but other bar and restaurant owners claimed that was where it allegedly took place on September 6.</p>

<p>McGregor is alleged to have flashed his manhood at the woman and assaulted her around 11pm after spending the evening drinking at various bars that run along the edge of the port.</p>

<p>One bar owner said: 'He was always with his bodyguard and was mostly left alone by other people. Not many people recognised him.</p>

<p>'His yacht was not even the biggest in the port but we all saw his arrest with the police coming down to the port.' </p>

<p>The bar opens up onto a terrace next to the sea front overlooking the mega yachts usually moored in the port</p>

<p>The popular port on the mountainous Mediterranean island has a strip of bars, all facing out towards the waterfront</p>

<p>The alleged assault and indecent exposure is said to have taken place after a night of heavy drinking the day after McGregor arrived in his Cayman Islands registered yacht DevOcean.</p>

<p>He was accompanied by two bodyguards while sat on the outside terrace of the bar.</p>

<p>The Mixed Martial Arts star has denied the allegations and his lawyer Emmanuelle Ramond told Mail Online he will go to court to prove his innocence.</p>

<p>'He will contest any charge if one is brought,' said Ramond.</p>

<p>'The judicial process is on going and I have not been told of anything that will happen.'</p>

<p>He has been told he does not have to stay in the port while an investigating magistrate carries out inquiries into the alleged incident which took place on September 6th.</p>

<p>McGregor had been due to take part in a charity water bike race from Calvi to Monaco.</p>

<p>On Friday, French police raided McGregor's £3million yacht and took the UFC star away after he was pictured surrounded by gendarmes at the Port of Calvi</p>

<p>Drug and alcohol tests are common when suspects are arrested by police in France following allegations of assault.</p>

<p>McGregor's lawyer said she had not been made aware of the results and said as the allegation involved a sex crime it was being kept confidential.</p>

<p>'Everything is confidential at the moment,' said Ms Ramond.</p>

<p>'Mr McGregor does not have to stay in Calvi while the investigation continues.'</p>

<p>The woman who has made the complaint is French and is from mainland France.</p>

<p>She was on holiday with her husband and now believed to have left the island.</p>

<p>As a victim of an alleged sex crime she cannot be identified.</p>

<p>After making her complaint police raided McGregor's 32m long Sunseeker yacht which can be chartered for £100,000 a week.</p>

<p>He fully cooperated with police and cycled the short distance to the local police station where he was interviewed by an examining magistrate and judicial police.</p>

<p>He was placed under arrest and held overnight before being released without charge on Saturday.</p>

<p>The following day his yacht left Calvi, according to records at the Calvi port.</p>

<p>After making her complaint police raided McGregor's 32m long Sunseeker yacht which can be chartered for £100,000 a week (pictured). McGregor left the port on the yacht, called the DevOcean, on Sunday - the day after being released</p>

<p>The case is being handled by prosecutor Arnaud Vionery in the nearby town of Bastia.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the prosecutor said there had been a complaint toward 'sexual assault and indecent exposure.</p>

<p>French police can hold a suspect for an initial period of 48 hours before having to apply for an extension to custody, charge them, or release them.</p>

<p>While McGregor was released,the case has not been closed, and there may be further action, the spokesman confirmed.</p>

<p>A prosecuting source on Corsica confirmed to Mail Online on Tuesday that McGregor was 'free to travel while enquiries continue.'</p>

<p>He said test results were 'still being analysed' and evidence including potential camera shots were still being gathered by judicial police supported by gendarmes.</p>

<p>Other potential witnesses to the bar incident were also being interviewed, while the alleged victim was also being kept informed of developments.</p>

<p>McGregor is not considered a flight risk from the EU, and has pledged full cooperation with the French judicial authorities, said the source.</p>

<p>His legal status currently allows him to come and go as he pleases, but this could change as the investigation develops.</p>

<p>McGregor's lawyer, said he 'vigorously denied any wrongdoing'.</p>

<p>'He has been released before the legal end of police custody and without any judicial review,' said Ms Ramond.</p>
