<p>James replied: 'She misses ya, she loves ya. I know Chloe she would never hear a bad word said about you and you're the same.</p>

<p>'You had a lovers tiff', before he awkwardly added: 'not a lovers tiff, friendship tiff'.</p>

<p>Backtracking: James told Pete: 'You had a lovers tiff', before he awkwardly added: 'not a lovers tiff, friendship tiff'</p>

<p>Fans of the show took to Twitter after the interaction. One wrote: 'See James let that slip "lovers".'</p>

<p>Another viewer added: 'Come on it's a lovers' tiff. A friendship where feelings were caught or maybe a FWB situation that became more than that'.</p>

<p>'When are Pete and Chloe going to swallow they're pride and admit there's more than friendship between them', tweeted a different fan. </p>

<p>'Omg can these two get together already please', another chimed. 'What did Lockie say sorry?,' another fan wrote.</p>

<p>New perpective: Pete suggested they thrash out their problems in couples' therapy</p>

<p>Suspicious:  Fans of the show took to Twitter after the interaction. One wrote: 'See James let that slip "lovers"</p>

<p>Earlier in the episode Chloe and Pete finally shared their first chat.</p>

<p>Pete kick-started the tense conversation by asking if there's 'anything' Chloe would like to say. </p>

<p>Chloe responded: 'Not really, I don't wanna be rude in front of Peggy [Pete's dog], but you were a bit of an a***hole. </p>

<p>'Towards the end of our friendship I felt like you started dismissing my feelings and … are you going to look at me or are you going to look at the bush? </p>

<p>Not impressed: Chloe called Pete an 'a***hole' during their first chat after falling out eight months ago earlier on in the episode</p>

<p>'I feel like you were dismissing how I felt a lot, I've confided in you, I've told you everything and told you all my secrets... and I know I'm a lot. </p>

<p>'I know I can be clingy and I can be jealous that is who I am, so if you don't like those things then we can't be friends cause I'm not going to change, I am who I am.'</p>

<p>Pete then tried to interject, telling Chloe to 'hold on, hold on', but to no avail as she continued to explain how she was feeling. </p>

<p>Defiant: Pete listened as Chloe said: 'I know I can be clingy and I can be jealous that is who I am, so if you don't like those things then we can't be friends cause I'm not going to change'</p>

<p>'No, I'm getting to my point,' she told him firmly. 'Obviously when the pandemic happened I just thought "omg I need Pete, I need to talk to Pete".' </p>

<p>Pete then asked his former close pal, 'so why didn't ya?' with Chloe replying she 'didn't know if you would be there even if I did reach out'. </p>

<p>He then asked her the ultimatum: 'Do you want to be friends then or civil?', to which Chloe said after a prolonged pause: 'Friends'.  </p>

<p>Having it out: Chloe accused Pete of 'dismissing her feelings' during the confrontation </p>

<p>They later met up at a bar. Chloe said: 'I'm really glad that we broke the ice, obviously we were having a bit of stand off.  </p>

<p>'The thing is when I see you, it's just you and it's familiar and all of the things I'm p****d off about go away. In reality you did p**s me off but I don't want to do it again.'</p>

<p>Pete told her: 'I don't want to do the rowing.' </p>

<p>Chloe said: Maybe we got so close. It felt like you were treating me different to how you were treating other people.'</p>

<p>Pere admitted: 'I probably treat the people closest to me worst and you know that,' before suggesting the pair go to couples' therapy.</p>

<p>Smiling with glee, Chloe said she 'would love that' because he would be able to understand her perspective.  </p>

<p>TOWIE continues on ITVBe at 9pm on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>'I would love that': Chloe later agreed to go to couples therapy with Pete to heal their friendship </p>
