<p>Mr Gayford took to Twitter on Friday to share his daughter's favourite handmade gift (pictured)</p>

<p>The cat with nipples (pictured) was revealed as Neve's favourite toy after receiving it as a gift</p>

<p>The favourite toy in question, is a cat with nipples. </p>

<p>'We both enjoy is this, at first glance, a bung legged, crazy eyes cat....but on closer inspection...it's a cat with nipples,' he wrote in a thread with photos of the toy.</p>

<p>However, there is even more than what meets the eye and Mr Gayford shared another photo of kittens hidden inside the toy. </p>

<p>The kittens were tucked away in the cat's stomach which can then all 'connect to the milk bar'.</p>

<p>'...and that is my story, thank you,' Mr Gayford wrote along with a cute photo of the cat with the kittens attached to the nipples.  </p>

<p>Mr Gayford continued his story on Twitter revealing that the cat actually has kittens inside </p>

<p>The kittens can then 'connect to the milk bar', just like in real life </p>

<p>Mr Gayford concluded his story with a photo of the toy with the kittens attached to the nipples</p>

<p>Mr Gayford said he 'feels bad' that he hasn't started an Instagram account to showcase the many toys Neve receives. </p>

<p>His thread however, has since received more than 1,600 likes with social media users saying they didn't realise it was a cat at first.</p>

<p>'This is amazing and is absolutely a dog,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'I thought it was a sheep at first, but then, I don’t live on a farm,' another commented. </p>

<p>'It's a Cog..cat body, doggy face,' another wrote.     </p>

<p>Ms Ardern confirmed her engagement to her Mr Gayford in May 2019 after she was spotted wearing a ring on her left hand.</p>

<p>Their engagement came almost a year after the birth of their first child Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford in June 2018.</p>

<p>The couple's engagement came almost a year after the birth of their first child Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford in June 2018</p>

<p>Mr Gayford, a well known broadcaster who hosted a fishing show called Fish of the Day, took a step back from his career to care for the couple's daughter. </p>

<p>Ms Ardern and Mr Gayford first met at an awards event in 2012 but did not start dating until 2013 when a constituency issue brought them together, Stuff reported.</p>

<p>Mr Gayford was upset about the potential loss of privacy proposed by the Government Communications Security Bureau Amendment Bill. </p>

<p>He first went to local MP, Nikki Kaye, but got no response.</p>

<p>He then wrote to Ms Ardern and the two met for coffee and bonded over a shared interest in music.</p>

<p>Ms Ardern has previously spoken out about their wedding plans, saying neither her or Mr Gayford had a particular stance on marriage. </p>

<p>'I predict we will one day. We happen to have done things in reverse a little bit, but that happens in life sometimes too,' she told RNZ.</p>
