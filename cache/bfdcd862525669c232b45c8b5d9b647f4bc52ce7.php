<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ruth Langsford has revealed she and Eamonn Holmes travel to film This Morning in separate cars because his timekeeping is so bad.</p>

<p>The British TV presenter, 60, admitted her husband 'drives her insane' for always making her late - and once caused the whole family to be bumped off a plane to Portugal for failing to check in on time.</p>

<p>Ruth, who has been with Eamonn for 23 years and married for 10, told how her husband is a great 'peacemaker' when it comes to their son Jack, 18 - but they tend to have blazing rows where they swear at each other and slam doors if they disagree. </p>

<p>Ruth Langsford has revealed she and Eamonn Holmes travel to film This Morning in separate cars because his timekeeping is so bad</p>

<p>Speaking to Platinum magazine, Ruth explained: 'We are both fiery. We love each other to pieces but we’re not that couple that goes, "Shall we sit down and talk about this?"</p>

<p>'We just have a big old row. I'll go, "P*** off!", he'll go, "P*** off!", doors slam then it's kind of over.'</p>

<p>It's Belfast-born Eamonn's lack of time-keeping that frustrates Ruth the most - and it means the couple now travel to the ITV studios in White City, London, in two different cars. </p>

<p>'We tried going together once and it was an absolute nightmare because he made me half an hour late,' Ruth explained.</p>

<p>Ruth, who has been with Eamonn (pictured together at the NTAs in January) for 23 years and married for 10, told how her husband is a great 'peacemaker' when it comes to their son Jack, 18 - but they tend to have blazing rows where they swear at each other and slam doors if they disagree</p>

<p>'He was saying, "What do you need to be in at 8am for?" He's a ship-up-10-minutes-before kind of guy. That;s where we are absolutely on opposite ends of the scale.'</p>

<p>She added that she was left 'furious' when, before a flight to Portugal, the entire family were so late to check in that they weren't allowed to board their flight. </p>

<p>'With Eamonn you're running through the airport with no time to spare, to even stop at WHSmith. It drives me insane,' Ruth lamented.</p>

<p>Thankfully Ruth - whose latest clothing line has now launched on QVC - insisted she and Eamonn are 'on the same page' politically and share the same life goals and opinions on people.</p>

<p>Ruth told how power walking with their family dog Maggie helped get her through the past six months of lockdown and is a sacred part of her day, which she uses to 'declutter her mind'</p>

<p>'There's no blueprint for a happy marriage,' she added. 'Marriage is about the coming together of two minds, two hearts and how you support each other.'</p>

<p>Ruth told how power walking with their family dog Maggie helped get her through the past six months and is a sacred part of her day, which she uses to 'declutter her mind'.</p>

<p>She claimed she lost 'maybe half a stone' during lockdown thanks to walking more and adding skipping to her fitness regime, which includes weight training at the gym.  </p>

<p>'I could suddenly see my waist and my legs felt toned. It made me realise that maintaining my weight is more about exercise than food and the older I get, the more I need to cardio it up,' she said.</p>

<p>Ruth also discussed losing her sister Julia Johnson, 62, who took her own life in June last year at the family home in Lingfeild, Surrey after suffering with mental health issues. </p>

<p>She revealed she hasn't yet sought bereavement therapy, believing it's too early for her to take that step.</p>

<p>'Right now, it's too raw to go that deeply into it,' she explained. 'That's not to say I wouldn’t and, actually, I wish my sister had tried that more. </p>

<p>'I don't know whether it would have changed anything. I'm a great believer in counselling so it's not me resisting it, but at the moment it's almost like I don't want to open that box in case it makes me crumble.</p>

<p>'Believe me, I'm no expert. I tried very hard to understand my sister's depression and it's a difficult thing for the friends and family around that person so when I see it happening to other people.'</p>

<p>Becoming tearful, Ruth added: 'Your heart breaks for them because it's like someone driving a truck through you, really.' </p>
