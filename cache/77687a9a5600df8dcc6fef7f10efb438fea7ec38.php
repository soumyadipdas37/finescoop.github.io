<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Juventus have earmarked Luis Suarez as the world class player to spearhead their attack. </p>

<p>This season the Uruguayan will turn 34 but his age has not deterred the Italian champions, who are eager to see him replicate his performances for Barcelona in Turin.</p>

<p>Both Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere dello Sport report that Suarez and Juventus have reached an agreement over the switch. </p>

<p>Luis Suarez could join Juventus from Barcelona as he is surplus to requirements in Spain</p>

<p>Andrea Pirlo wants the Uruguayan to play alongside Paulo Dybala and Cristiano Ronaldo </p>

<p>It is understood that he will take advantage of the Italian government's growth decree that will allow the forward to save the club almost 50 per cent of his wages in two years. </p>

<p>The decree is a package of measures aimed at returning to economic stability after the country dipped into a recession due to the coronavirus pandemic's impact.</p>

<p>Measures in place would help lighten the financial load of signing Suarez on Juventus.  </p>

<p>The combative forward has reportedly already contacted club chief Pavel Nedved over a transfer having been told he is not in Ronald Koeman's plans at the Nou Camp.  </p>

<p>Pirlo will have spoken to Suarez over the phone and the sell would have been simple, he will be one of the only players in the world to have performed alongside both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. </p>

<p>The potential move would see Suarez link up with his old Real Madrid rival Ronaldo</p>

<p>The transfer landscape has changed significantly for Juventus in the previous few days. </p>

<p>The club were originally close to a deal for Roma striker Edin Dzeko but the capital club resisted. </p>

<p>They are digging their heels in and it could be to Suarez's benefit. As it stands, Roma and Juventus are at an impasse but there is a chance an agreement could still be reached.   </p>

<p>New Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman told the striker that he is not in his plans moving forward</p>

<p>But a move for Suarez could be completed quickly, within a day, should Barcelona release him early, paying him £22million in severance. </p>

<p>If that is what comes to pass and Ronald Koeman gives the green light to terminating the former Liverpool man's contract, Pirlo will be eyeing up one of the most dangerous front threes in football. </p>

<p>A trio of Ronaldo, Suarez and Paulo Dybala, with Dzeko also a possible replacement, gives Juventus a formidable attacking set-up and much would see them start Serie A as heavy favourites once more to retain their crown. </p>

<p>Suarez and Juve chief Pavel Nedved have been locked in talks which are going positively</p>
