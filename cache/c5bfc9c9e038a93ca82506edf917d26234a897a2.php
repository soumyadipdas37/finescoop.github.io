<p>Coffee run: She's rumoured to be the new girlfriend of one the biggest stars in the world. And on Sunday, Vanessa Valladares (pictured), who has of late been in the constant company of Hollywood A-lister Zac Efron, stepped out in Bryon Bay</p>

<p>She was dressed for what was a warm summer day in a long-sleeved, off-the-shoulder crop top, in a shade of baby blue. </p>

<p>Vanessa appeared to go braless under the ribbed garment, and added a fine gold necklace and earrings to her look. </p>

<p>The brunette wore her cropped locks casually un-styled and appeared to go makeup free.  </p>

<p>Happy girl: The 25-year-old former cafe worker was on a coffee run, fetching a brew in a small cup, which she brought from home, before returning to her car</p>

<p>Cute: She was dressed for what was a warm summer day in a long-sleeved, off-the-shoulder crop top, in a shade of baby blue</p>

<p>Flirty: Vanessa appeared to go braless under the ribbed garment, and added a fine gold necklace and earrings to her look</p>

<p>She completed her look with a pair of loose cargo pants, black socks and black and white sneakers. </p>

<p>Vanessa carried in her hand a photo and car keys, as well as wearing sunglasses on her head.    </p>

<p>Zac reportedly met Vanessa in July when she was working as a waitress in Byron Bay, at the Byron Bay General Store café. </p>

<p>Hair care: The brunette wore her cropped locks casually un-styled and off her face </p>

<p>Pants: She added a pair of loose cargo pants to the casual ensemble </p>

<p>Relaxed: The aspiring model and cafe worker appeared to go makeup free</p>

<p>She's rumoured to have quit her job now and is said to be staying with Zac at Belongil Beach. </p>

<p>The pair have even enjoyed a ski trip in Thredbo together.</p>

<p>Last month, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles. </p>

<p>'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source revealed. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.' </p>

<p>Details: Vanessa carried in her hand a photo and her car keys</p>

<p>Shady lady: The beauty wore her sunglasses on her head</p>

<p>Dressed: She completed her look with black socks and black and white sneakers</p>

<p>Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months ago in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.</p>

<p>But it seems his request to have his tourist visa extended from three months to 12 months was granted, hence why he cancelled his trip home.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands Zac received a last-minute refund for his ticket. </p>

<p>Chance encounter: Zac reportedly met Vanessa in July when she was working as a waitress in Byron Bay, at the Byron Bay General Store café</p>

<p>Shacked up? She's rumoured to have quit her job now and is said to be staying with Zac at Belongil Beach</p>
