<p>Dean Henderson impressed despite Manchester Unites suffering a 1-0 loss to Aston Villa</p>

<p>New £40m man Donny van de Beek also featured and Solskjaer was delighted with his showing</p>

<p>'There were some positives,' the Norwegian told MUTV. </p>

<p>'I thought Deano showed his authority back there and he played like a proper Man United goalkeeper. </p>

<p>'Donny was maybe the biggest plus in the outfield. He's such a finder of space and he creates time for himself with his timing and movement. </p>

<p>'I was very happy with his performance.'    </p>

<p>United could on fit in one pre-season match after their long Europa League run into August</p>

<p>Henderson is set to challenge for David de Gea's spot after the Spaniard's drastic dip in form</p>

<p>Midfielder Van de Beek arrived for £40m from Ajax while Henderson has finally broken into the Old Trafford first-team after two seasons on-loan at Sheffield United.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old keeper is set to challenge David de Gea for the No 1 spot this season, after the Spaniard's poor form last term led Solskjaer to consider his options.  </p>

<p>United regrouped after a short break just two weeks ago, owing to their Europa League semi-final run which stretched into August. </p>

<p>Solskjaer admitted a number of players 'clearly needed minutes' after the defeat to Villa, with United struggling for a cutting-edge in attack and falling to an Ollie Watkins winner.  </p>
