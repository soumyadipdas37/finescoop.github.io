<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nearly half of the victims of big business data breaches then go on to be targeted by fraudsters, it is claimed.</p>

<p>The shocking figures come from consumer group Which? amid concerns that companies and public bodies are not taking security seriously.</p>

<p>They hold huge archives of sensitive information, including customers' addresses and payment card details, which can be used for ID theft and money transfers.</p>

<p>Concerns are rising that businesses do not do enough to protect their clients from online fraud</p>

<p>Even a cache of email addresses can be used for phishing attacks in which fraudsters pretend to be official bodies.</p>

<p>A consumer survey by Which? found 46 per cent of those whose data was stolen then experienced fraud.</p>

<p>Often, they suffered huge distress and struggled to get any help or compensation.</p>

<p>BA, easyJet, Marriott Hotels and software company Blackbaud are among firms to have been hit by hackers.</p>

<p>As part of its investigation, Which? asked members to submit their email addresses to the website haveibeenpwned.com, which can tell if they have been involved in a hack.</p>

<p>This revealed that 79 per cent of 610 email addresses had experienced at least one breach and one had been involved in 19.</p>

<p>Which? said firms are doing too little to protect customers.</p>

<p>Editor of Which? Money Jenny Ross said: 'Whether we're shopping online, booking a holiday or signing up to a new mobile phone contract, we have to trust the companies we deal with to protect our details - and if things go wrong we need to know that businesses are held to account.'</p>

<p>Here are some consumer tips from Which? for protecting data:</p>

<p>Passwords</p>

<p>Always set strong passwords. There are many services available which will alert you if your passwords have been compromised. And where possible, turn on two-factor or multi-factor authentication.</p>

<p>Credit cards</p>

<p>Do not save your credit card details if you are not going to use the service regularly.</p>

<p>Although it may be inconvenient to resubmit them, it is better than having your financial information unnecessarily stored in a database that could be compromised.</p>

<p>Guest checkouts</p>

<p>Just checkout as a guest if you are not going to use the service that often. Only create an account if you really need to.</p>
