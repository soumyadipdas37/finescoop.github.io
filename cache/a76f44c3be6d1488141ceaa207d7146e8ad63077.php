<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Enable is the 1-5 favourite with Ladbrokes for Saturday's September Stakes at Kempton after confirmation John Gosden-trained stablemate Logician will not take her on even though the 2019 St Leger winner features among the nine entries.</p>

<p>Enable will be having what is expected to be her last race in Britain before trying to win an historic third Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe on October 4 while Logician would be making his delayed seasonal debut after illness.</p>

<p>But Lord Grimthorpe, racing manager to owner Khaled Abdullah, said: 'They won't run against each other. Enable is very much an intended runner at this stage.Â </p>

<p>Enable is the 1-5 favourite with Ladbrokes for Saturday's September Stakes at Kempton</p>

<p>'We entered Logician just in case, as he is nearing a return and we're considering a couple of different options.'</p>

<p>Highest rated of Enable's potential opponents is Charlie Fellowes-trained Prince of Arran, who has twice been placed in the Melbourne Cup.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Roger Teal-trained July Cup winner Oxted is 7-2 favourite for Saturday's Group One Haydock Sprint Cup.</p>
