<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England youngsters Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood could face disciplinary action after footage emerged of the pair allegedly bringing girls back to the team hotel in Iceland.</p>

<p>The pair made their senior international debuts in the win over Iceland on Saturday - but those accomplishments have now been overshadowed.</p>

<p>Players have been given strict guidelines to ensure Covid safety - and the images - who have been published by Icelandic outlet DV - appears to show Foden and Greenwood disregard those protocols.</p>

<p>A Snapchat clip released by DV appears to show England youngsters Phil Foden (pictured) and Mason Greenwood in a hotel room with female company</p>

<p>Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood have broken Iceland's Covid-19 restrictions after inviting girls back to their hotel in Iceland.</p>

<p>After a spike in local transmissions, the government recently clamped down and brought in further restrictions.</p>

<p>The pair's conduct in allegedly bringing girls back is also likely to have contravened the FA's behavioural rules for players whilst on international duty.</p>

<p>In the short clip, Foden and Greenwood appear to be wearing their new England training wear and the players are now likely to be in hot water with management.</p>

<p>Foden has a two-year-old son and a long-term girlfriend, while United star Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend back in May. </p>

<p>Manchester City midfielder Foden started for Gareth Southgate's side against Iceland on Saturday night, making his senior international debut, while Greenwood came off the bench to achieve the same accolade.</p>

<p>While the pair would have been looking ahead to England's next fixture against Denmark in Copenhagen on Tuesday night, they will now leave Iceland under a dark cloud. </p>

<p>City star Foden regularly posts pictures with his young son, who turned one back in January</p>

<p>Greenwood, pictured in training on Sunday, now faces being kicked out of the England squad</p>

<p>Foden was all smiles on Sunday but is now in danger of leaving the camp under a dark cloud</p>
