<p>Experts have differing views about the 'magic number' of cases the virus-riddled state needs to drop down to before it can claim victory against a horror second wave. </p>

<p>Victoria recorded 73 new cases on Monday, its lowest figure since July 3 and the second time in three days new case numbers have dropped under triple digits.  </p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews plans to unveil Victoria's 'roadmap' out of lockdown on Sunday, a week before Melbourne's Stage Four restrictions were initially due to end.</p>

<p>Deakin University Prof Catherine Bennett believes the 'magic number' of new daily cases is 20.</p>

<p>'If we have got our overall numbers down to 20 — that might have the government feeling confident enough that they can manage that and we can open up,' she told the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>University of South Australia Prof Adrian Esterman estimates Victoria's daily new case numbers to hit single digits by this weekend.</p>

<p>He argued the case for some restrictions can eased now to improve people's mental health without adding to the risk of extra transmissions.</p>

<p>Strategies include doubling the one-hour daily exercise limit for Melburnians and a friendship 'bubble' for singles. </p>

<p>Victoria recorded 73 new cases on Monday, the lowest figure since July 3. Pictured are Melburnians exercising in the Docklands precinct on Monday</p>

<p>The figures, confirmed by the Department of Health and Human Services on Monday, bring the state's toll from the virus to 565 and the national total to 652 </p>

<p>But University of Melbourne Prof Nancy Baxter believes there's no magic number and depends on where the cases are coming from.</p>

<p>'They may well open up before they’re at 50 but it will be just very selective openings,' she told the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>Leading epidemiologist and World Health Organisation expert Professor Mary-Louise McLaws believe the Victorian government reacted too slowly to the second outbreak and should have enforced Melbourne's lockdown sooner.</p>

<p>As lockdown restrictions enter a fifth week, she says it has been successful and estimates Victoria is 11 days away from recording 59 new cases within a two week period, which she calls the 'COVID green zone.'</p>

<p>'Fifty-nine cases is safe,' Professor McLaws told 7news.com.au.</p>

<p>'Contact tracing that many people, it isn't difficult to prevent the spread from getting out of hand.'</p>

<p>Professor Mary-Louise McLaws' graph shows the 14-day average in changes to the cumulative coronavirus cases in Victoria and NSW. 'Lockdown is working,' she tweeted on Monday</p>

<p>One expert says some Melbourne restrictions can be eased now such as doubling the time of daily exercise permitted to two hours. Pictured is a man walking his dog in Melbourne's Docklands precinct on Monday</p>

<p>Between 60 and 99 cases in a fortnight would put the state in the 'amber zone', which require restrictions to remain in place while over 100 would require shutdown.</p>

<p>'The ability to contact trace in a timely manner is crucial,' Professor McLaws says.</p>

<p>'You can't wait until you have 100 people to trace because then it's too late.'</p>

<p>She believes some restrictions should remain in place, including mandatory face masks in public and night curfews.</p>

<p>The experts all agreed cases from an unknown source need to remain at low numbers before restrictions can be removed.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews refused to guarantee restrictions will ease when lockdown is due to end September 13.</p>

<p>Melburnians remain under strict lockdown where they are restricted to one hour of outdoor exercise each day within a five kilometre radius of their home. Pictured is a couple in Melbourne on Monday</p>

<p>'We can't rule out settings in two weeks time. It is very difficult to know what those settings will be,' the premier told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>'What we will provide on Sunday will be the plan that we intend to put in place, the plan that, all things being equal, we will put in place.</p>

<p>'Everything has to have that asterisk next to it. I know that is deeply frustrating. It is frustrating for all of us.'</p>

<p>Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton urged Victorians to stay the course.</p>

<p>'We are all fed up with it, absolutely fed up with it,' Professor Sutton said.</p>

<p>'But holding the course, even as we get down to these very low numbers, is absolutely critical to get that control that we can be confident that we will maintain.'</p>

<p>One expert says face masks in public should remain mandatory if lockdown is eased. Pictured are Melburnians soaking up the winter sunshine on Saturday</p>

<p>He hopes new case numbers will be down to 40-50 by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth said it was difficult to see Melbourne coming out of its stage four restrictions on September 13, given the current numbers.</p>

<p>He said Victoria needed to be down near the lower numbers of NSW and Queensland.</p>

<p>'But then again, the rate the number is (decreasing) is getting faster in Victoria, so you never know and we just have to look at it on a daily basis,' he said.</p>

<p>Apart from the daily case numbers, Prof Sutton said it was also critical for the so-called 'mystery' community transmission cases to be reduced as low as possible.'</p>
