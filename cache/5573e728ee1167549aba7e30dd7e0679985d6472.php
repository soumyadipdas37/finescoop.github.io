<p>The video was recorded by a DoorDash worker who was picking up a delivery order when he noticed the incident unfold. </p>

<p>In the video, Rodriguez, who has 11 years on the force and was assigned to SJPD’s Violent Crimes Enforcement Team, ordered the driver out of the car with his gun drawn. </p>

<p>The woman complied and got down on the ground when ordered by the officer.</p>

<p>He then told the woman, 'I’m going to kick you in the (expletive) face,' before kicking her in the stomach. </p>

<p>Rodriguez then dragged her for several feet away from the car by her handcuffs. </p>

<p>The officer reported that she was not complying with his commands. But the footage contradicted the officer’s report, showing the victim trying to comply with the commands. </p>

<p>Following the incident, Rodriguez was placed on administrative leave. Officials said he will self-surrender on the warrant and will be arraigned on the misdemeanor charge when the court schedules that first appearance. </p>

<p>If convicted, Rodriguez faces one year in jail. </p>

<p>District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in the press release: 'Officers have a difficult job, but they also should be held to a high standard. No officer should use more force than necessary to take a person into custody. </p>

<p>'When they do, they not only commit a crime, they weaken the bonds of trust with the community that so many excellent police officers have worked their entire careers to build. The SJPD detectives assigned to this case conducted a fair, thorough, and professional investigation involving one of their own officers.'</p>

<p>The victim was booked into Santa Clara County Jail for driving on a suspended license, possession of paraphernalia, and resisting arrest. </p>

<p>She was later released and after a review of the case, the District Attorney’s Office declined to file charges against the victim.</p>
