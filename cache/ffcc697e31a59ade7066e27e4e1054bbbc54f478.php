<p>Sydney Stack, 20, and Callum Coleman-Jones, 21 were involved in an altercation after being evicted from Hollywood Showgirls on the glitter strip's Orchid Ave at 3.30 Friday morning, the Courier Mail reports. </p>

<p>'Around 3.30am, officers responded to reports of two men, aged 20 and 21, involved in a physical altercation on Orchid Avenue.</p>

<p>'Both men sustained facial injuries as a result of the incident.</p>

<p>'The men were both issued with a Police Banning Notice, excluding them from Gold Coast Safe Night Precincts and a Penalty Infringement Notice (PIN) for Public Nuisance (Violent Behaviour). Further investigations are continuing into the matter.'</p>

<p>About 400 AFL players, their families and officials have descended on Queensland under controversial quarantine arrangements.</p>

<p>They were given the all-clear to dodge the state's border lockdown in a bid to keep the AFL season going away from Melbourne's second coronavirus wave. </p>

<p>It comes amid reports WAGs and officials are living it up in 'hotel quarantine' - sipping cocktails while lounging by the pool at their luxury Gold Coast resort. </p>

<p>'We are doing this quarantine the same as everyone else,' AFL boss Gill McLachlan said this week.</p>

<p>But images and video that emerged on Thursday tell a different story - with the officials and families chilling out the four-and-half star Mercure Gold Coast resort. </p>

<p>Birds eye video footage of the quarantine hotel showed AFL officials and WAGs make the most of the luxury Mercure resort</p>

<p>Aerial footage - published by Nine News on Thursday - showed WAGs relaxing by the swimming pool at the quarantine resort as children splashed in the water.</p>

<p>The wives and girlfriends soaked up the sun with drinks in hand, just a few steps away from the poolside bar.</p>

<p>The vision is a world away from the experience of other travellers who have desperately fought to enter Queensland.</p>

<p>Jayne Brown, 60, spent two weeks confined to a tiny hotel room in Brisbane following her recent return from Sydney, where renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo removed two large tumours on her brain.</p>

<p>The grandmother-of-seven requested an exemption from hotel quarantine to self-isolate at home on the Sunshine Coast, but was rejected twice.</p>

<p>She blasted Ms Palaszczuk for allowing the AFL officials to enter the state on Tuesday night. </p>

<p>'I don't understand it, mind-blowing,' Ms Brown told Nine News.</p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been criticised for easing her strict border controls to welcome the officials and their loved ones from coronavirus-riddled Victoria</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Queensland grandmother was forced to recover from brain surgery in a quarantine hotel, while AFL officials have been exempt from strict quarantine rules </p>

<p>The Queensland government has deemed all of Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT to be coronavirus hotspots.</p>

<p>Travellers from hotspot states who are granted a border declaration pass are required to spend 14 days in mandatory hotel quarantine, at their own cost.   </p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg accused the Queensland government of double standards. </p>

<p>Mr Frydenberg said the football hub showed two sets of rules on borders given regular punters had missed out on vital medical treatment.</p>

<p>'It's just not on that a young woman can lose an unborn child because of confusion at the borders,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday. </p>

<p>'At the same time, footy officials can go down to their hotel bar as they so-called quarantine in Queensland.</p>

<p>'It seems double standards on our borders.'</p>
