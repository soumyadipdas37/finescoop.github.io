<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Premier League directors and senior executives will be able to fill their faces when football returns after forcing through a change to the Covid-19 protocols.</p>

<p>Under previous rules brought in for Project Restart, clubs were only permitted to provide food prepared on-site for players, match officials, technical staff and medical personnel. </p>

<p>The lack of a matchday banquet had upset many in the boardroom. And it can now be revealed that the protocols have been amended for this season to ensure those upstairs do not miss out.</p>

<p>Premier League chiefs are now able to eat at games as food is now allowed in directors' boxes</p>

<p>COVID-19 protocols under Project Restart meant that food was not served in games last term</p>

<p>It means that, while many of those at games will still have to do without food, directors and senior executives will have no such issues. </p>

<p>‘It’s typical,’ an insider at one top-flight club said. ‘There was a lot of moaning because those at the top were no longer being fed. It’s no surprise that the situation has changed for the new season. </p>

<p>‘From now on, those who are in for a couple of hours to watch the game get looked after, while a lot of the staff have to go without. Is it really necessary?’</p>

<p>Premier League football kicks off for another season on Saturday as Fulham take on Arsenal</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands the Venue Operations and Control element of the protocols is the one which has been amended. No other food preparation will be permitted.</p>

<p>The amendment was signed off last week. The Premier League declined to comment. </p>

<p>Clubs in the top flight begin their season on Saturday, starting with the Fulham v Arsenal lunchtime kick-off.</p>
