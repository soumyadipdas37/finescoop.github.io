<p>A leaked document details the plans for Shore School's muck-up day prank which includes plans for a crime spree.</p>

<p>The scavenger hunt, titled the 'Triwizard Shorenament' in a reference to Harry Potter, encourages students to take drugs, assault strangers and trespass on private property.  </p>

<p>A 'rule book' devised by students reveals plans to meet on Wednesday night at Waverton Park on the lower north shore, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.</p>

<p>Students at an elite private school are reportedly planning to celebrate the end of school by spitting on homeless men and defecating on public transport </p>

<p>Year 12 students would be split into teams of five or six before carrying out a series of tasks to gain the most points.</p>

<p>Some challenges are illegal, such as 'snort a line' (of cocaine) or 'rip a cone on the Harbour Bridge' (smoke cannabis out of a bong).</p>

<p>Others dare students to 'break into Taronga Zoo', 'spit on a homeless man', and 'sh** on a train'.</p>

<p>Some involve assaulting total strangers by hitting them in the genitals while they are walking past.</p>

<p>The list of challenges also denigrates women, urging students to have sex with a woman over 80kg or hook up with an unattractive women deemed '3/10 or lower'. </p>

<p>Others tasks are more family friendly, including getting mullet haircuts and waxing armpit hair.  </p>

<p>Instructions written into the rule book advise students they must document their completed tasks on Instagram.</p>

<p>The school is situated in the wealthy Sydney suburb of North Sydney and costs around $33,000 a year in tuition</p>

<p>But they are also warned not to upload any potentially incriminating evidence of illegal behaviour including 'inappropriate or sexual advances'.  </p>

<p>'If anyone gets caught by a teacher/cops they will say that they were just having fun between the 5/6 of them and won't mention the tournament,' the instructions state.    </p>

<p>Before starting on the challenges, the groups first have to finish a case of 30 beers in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The game was discovered by school administrators, who contacted New South Wales Police.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Shore school - which charges up to $33,000-a-year in fees, told the Sydney Morning Herald it had issued a stern warning to students and parents over the game. </p>

<p>'As soon as the school became aware of the document police were informed and an urgent communication was sent to all year 12 parents instructing that under no circumstances are Shore boys to participate in the activities specified,' the spokesman said. </p>

<p>'Consequences for any boys who do participate will be severe and could include the loss of their place at the school.'  </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Shore for comment. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for New South Wales Police told Daily Mail Australia they respect the age old tradition of muck-up day but will not tolerate any illegal behaviour. </p>

<p>'While pranks are often part and parcel of the day, don't engage in any behaviour that risks your welfare or the safety of others,' the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>'Students must take necessary precautions so celebrations do not get out of hand and become dangerous.</p>

<p>'The police are not here to spoil the fun, but they will take action if deemed necessary.' </p>
