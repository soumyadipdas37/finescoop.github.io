<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sailing boats over 50 feet long have been banned from a stretch of Spain's northern coastline where several vessels have been attacked by killer whales.</p>

<p>Government officials have admitted the measure could be applied to other areas where the animals live and hunt and have been involved in recent incidents, including the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The Directorate General of the Merchant Marine (DGMM), part of Spain's Ministry of Transport, has also announced a plane normally used in firefighting will be deployed to identify the killer whales thought to be responsible and alert seafarers in the area.</p>

<p>The sailing ban applies to the coastline off the north-west region of Galicia, between Cape Priorino Grande near the city of Ferrol and Spain's northernmost point Punta de Estaca de Bares. It is due to last a week.</p>

<p>The plane is expected to focus on the off-limits area.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the DGMM described the move as 'proportionate and objective'.</p>

<p>He added: 'The measure is designed to prevent new episodes involving killer whales which have caused several incidents in Galicia's coastal area in the past few weeks involving mainly sailing boats.</p>

<p>'The sailing boats affected by this decision can navigate perpendicular to the off-limits area to reach the coast or head out to sea.'</p>

<p>The recent spate of attacks on boats in Spanish and Portuguese waters by killer whales, which have left at least one crewman injured, have baffled scientists.</p>

<p>Marine life experts have described them as 'unheard of.' Biologists have reportedly compiled a list of around 40 'interactions', 29 of them in Galicia, since one on July 20 between Gibraltar and Cape Trafalgar.</p>

<p>In a recent incident Halcyon Yachts were taking a 36ft vessel to the UK from the Galician city of La Coruna when a killer whale rammed it at least 15 times.</p>

<p>The vessel lost steering and had to be towed back to port because of the attack.</p>

<p>A yacht named as Gautier was attacked on Tuesday and had to be towed back to the town of Muros south of La Coruna - outside of the off-limits area - after its rudder was damaged.</p>

<p>Marine lift experts say they believe two young killer whales in one of three groups of 13 animals located in Galician waters could be behind the attacks.</p>

<p>The theory they are reacting to a previous attack by a seafarer has not been ruled out and scientists have speculated they could be linked to a decrease in the number of boats at sea during the coronavirus lockdown which has increased curiosity among the young killer whales.</p>

<p>In a recent incident Halcyon Yachts were taking a 36ft vessel to the UK from the Galician city of La Coruna when a killer whale rammed it at least 15 times (above)</p>

<p>But most experts have concluded the animals see their attacks on the rudders they have targeted as a game and could be using them to hone their hunting instincts.</p>

<p>Around seven boats have had to be towed back to port since the incidents began because of damage caused to their rudders.</p>

<p>Bruno Diaz, a marine biologist based in Pontevedra in Galicia, told a local Spanish paper earlier this month: 'It's possible the incidents have taken place because young animals in a group are practicing their hunting techniques with the boats they encounter.</p>

<p>'Possibly it's a game for them and they're enjoying themselves at the expense of the vessels affected.'</p>
