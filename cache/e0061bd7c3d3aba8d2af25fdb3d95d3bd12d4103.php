<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chef Gary Usher slammed a customer who said her meal at his restaurant was a 'rip-off' in a damning online review. </p>

<p>Usher, 36, hit back after diner Emma left a one-star TripAdvisor review for his restaurant, the Sticky Walnut in Chester, Cheshire.</p>

<p>Emma the £122 bill for her meal - two people for one course with drinks - was 'eye-wateringly expensive' price tag was 'really not worth it'.</p>

<p>But Usher claimed she had misunderstood the pricing of the set menu and that they could have ordered a three-course set menu for just £39 each. </p>

<p>Chef Gary Usher (pictured), 36, hit back after diner Emma left a one-star TripAdvisor review for his restaurant, the Sticky Walnut in Chester, Cheshire </p>

<p>Emma had claimed the meal, which cost £122.50 for two, was 'average' and said the 'eye-wateringly expensive' price was 'really not worth it'. Usher posted his own response (above)</p>

<p>The chef added that her review could 'devastate' his business at a difficult time. </p>

<p>Emma's original review, posted last Sunday, read: 'If you want to pay £45 each for an average piece of sirloin steak and some parmesan chips then this is the place to go!</p>

<p>'When we mentioned to the waitress we thought the menu was misleading, instead of apologising and trying to fix our distress, she got extremely agitated, defensive and frankly rude.</p>

<p>'Sticky Walnut was somewhere I used to look forward to going to but I would council (sic) EVERYONE heading to Chester for a decent meal to avoid this place like the plague unless they like being ripped off.'  </p>

<p>Usher, who previously appeared in a Channel 4 documentary about one of his restaurants, said in his response that the menu has a fixed price of £39 for 3 courses and that the supplement of dry aged sirloin steak costs an extra £30. </p>

<p>Emma's original review, posted last Sunday, pictured, caught the attention of Usher</p>

<p>He wrote: 'I only personally respond on here every few years so well done on getting me out of Twit-advisor hibernation.   </p>

<p>'The essence of your 'review' should be quite simple. You think we're a rip off, which is probably the most common complaint on the Twit-advisor website.</p>

<p>'So nothing new there. So why am I responding? Simply because you wouldn't let Becky the MANAGER explain at the time. In fact it was YOU who got extremely agitated, defensive and quite frankly rude.</p>

<p>'With all set menus there are supplements. On ours it's our dry aged Aubrey Allen sirloin. In Sticky Walnut it will cost an extra £15 per person to have the sirloin instead of, for example, the feather blade of beef.</p>

<p>He added: 'You are a self-professed expert in comms and brand awareness and still manage to be so short sighted not to see how devastating your words can be.'</p>

<p>The chef shared a photo of the exchange on Twitter with this caption announcing he is quitting TripAdvisor</p>

<p>Usher further advised the reviewer to 'Think before you write' after her scathing review. He added: 'Be kind, it won't cost you as much as a first-class flight to Dubai.'</p>

<p>The chef shared a photo of the exchange on Twitter with the caption: 'My response is no longer pending. The TripAdvisor site has published it &amp; Emma the reviewer will now have it too.</p>

<p>'Was great to get all your feedback on it yesterday. I'd like to announce my retirement from trip advisor after an unhealthy 10 year working relationship, farewell'. </p>

<p>Gary's tweet has been liked 8,800 times and earned him strong support from social media users.</p>

<p>Gary made headlines in 2018 after a customer complained about the Sticky Walnut's lack of 'customer skills' after staff were asked to go shop for lemonade for a red wine spritzer.</p>

<p>Gary shot down the customer saying: 'We often nip out for people's requests. It's part of great hospitality. We just don't do it if you're a rude c***'.</p>

<p>Gary starred in a Channel 4 documentary in 2019 called The Rebel Chef: My Restaurant Revolution.</p>

<p>The documentary follows the opening of one of his crowdfunded bistros Pinion in the Merseyside Town of Prescot.</p>
