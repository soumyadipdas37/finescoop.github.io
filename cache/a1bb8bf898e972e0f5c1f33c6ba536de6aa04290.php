<p>Puel, taking charge of his 600th match in the French top flight, saw his side take a sixth minute lead thanks to a fine finish from 33-year-old winger Romain Hamouma.</p>

<p>Yvann Macon found space down the left and whipped in a low cross which Hamouma met with a first-time left-foot finish into the bottom corner.</p>

<p>Marseille, who beat champions Paris St Germain 1-0 on Sunday in a game where five red cards were shown, struggled to find any fluidity but came out strongly after the break after a double substitution.</p>

<p>One of those subs, Marley Ake, went close to an equaliser in the 54th minute by sliding in to meet a low cross from Florian Thauvin but his close-range effort struck the bar.</p>

<p>Morgan Sanson then missed a great chance from close range for Marseille, stabbing the ball wide at the back post but Saint Etienne continued to threaten on the break.</p>

<p>Romain Hamouma scored the opening goal in the sixth minute for the visitors</p>

<p>Denis Bouanga went close twice before he doubled the lead for the visitors with a powerful finish from outside the box after great work from substitute Arnaud Nordin.</p>

<p>Saint Etienne lead on nine points, two more than Rennes, Monaco and Lille, while Marseille's first defeat of the campaign leaves them in eighth on six points.</p>
