<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Urzila Carlson replaced Lindsay Lohan as a judge on The Masked Singer this season.</p>

<p>And it seems the 44-year-old comedian hasn't wasted any time developing a keen eye for guessing the celebrities behind the masks.</p>

<p>She told Who magazine on Thursday that she paid close attention to less-obvious clues, such as the singer's body type and even their gait.</p>

<p>The Masked Singer's Urzila Carlson revealed the subtle clues she looks for that give away a star's identity - and they have nothing to do with the cryptic clues or their voice</p>

<p>'Rather than focus on the voice, I've been studying people's height and body shapes. So if some big muscular guy is in the costume, he could be a rugby player,' she said.</p>

<p>'If the person looks like they could run underneath a coffee table, it's probably Dannii Minogue trying on a costume!' she joked.</p>

<p>Urzila also admitted that she did 'CSI-level' investigating on the Instagram accounts of local celebrities.</p>

<p>Subtle clues: The 44-year-old explained to Who magazine on Thursday that she studied subtle clues such as people's body shapes, builds and even their walk. She said: 'if some big muscular guy is in the costume, he could be a rugby player'. Pictured is Frillneck</p>

<p>Hints: Urzila also admitted that she did 'CSI' level investigating on the Instagram accounts of local celebrities. 'If certain Australian-based celebrities had big gaps between posts, could it be because they're at a photo shoot,' Urzila said. Pictured is Bushranger</p>

<p>'If certain Australian-based celebrities had big gaps between posts, could it be because they're at a photo shoot in a hammerhead costume? See? I told you I went totally CSI on this,' she added.</p>

<p>After filming the majority of the show in Melbourne, Urzila recorded her parts for the season finale from a hotel room in New Zealand on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, host Osher Günsberg and fellow panellist Jackie 'O' Henderson filmed their bits from Sydney, and Dave Hughes and Dannii Minogue stayed in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Remote filming: Urzila was forced to remotely film her parts of the grand finale from her hotel room in New Zealand, while Osher Günsberg and Jackie O were in Sydney, Dave Hughes and Dannii Minogue in Melbourne</p>

<p>Production at Docklands Studios had been suspended on August 22 after a COVID-19 outbreak on set, which forced the entire cast and crew into two-week quarantine.</p>

<p>Channel 10 and Warner Bros. permitted Osher, Jackie and Urzila to leave Melbourne once their isolation period ended, and they filmed their segments remotely.</p>

<p>The Masked Singer finale airs Monday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>

<p>Oh dear! The Masked Singer judge Jackie 'O' Henderson (pictured) revealed that filming for the finale was interrupted by a security guard over a noise complaint at Urzila's New Zealand hotel room</p>
