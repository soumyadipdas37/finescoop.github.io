<p>The 38-year-old has put pen to paper on a new £6million deal to stay at the San Siro for the 2020-21 season.</p>

<p>Ibrahimovic claimed he is not a mascot as he announced he had put pen to paper on a new deal</p>

<p>The striker signed a £6million contract over the weekend that does not include any bonuses</p>

<p>Last week, Ibrahimovic himself announced he had signed a new deal and outlined his plan to take AC Milan back to where it belongs.</p>

<p>As Ibrahimovic links up with his Milan team-mates once again in pre-season training, the striker claims he is 'not a mascot' and is there to help the club rise up the Italian top-flight table again.</p>

<p>He told the AC Milan official channel: 'I'm very happy to be here again. Finally everything's sorted and I've finally come back to where I feel at home - now we've got to work and achieve results. </p>

<p>'I'm not here to be a mascot. I'm here to achieve results and to help the squad, the manager and the club to take Milan back to where it belongs. </p>

<p>'In the last six months we've done well but we haven't won anything. There's the possibility to start working hard and making sacrifices to achieve our goals.'</p>

<p>Ibrahimovic was part of the AC Milan side that last won the Serie A title back in 2011</p>

<p>Ibrahimovic has rejoined an AC Milan side who has not won the Scudetto in a decade, while the club haven't reached the Champions League in six years. </p>

<p>The Swedish striker's new Milan contract is just a basic salary and does not include any goal or appearance-related bonuses, according to Sky Sports Italia. </p>

<p>Ibrahimovic had a fantastic second-half of the 2020-21 season, scoring 10 goals in 18 Serie A matches and will be looking to extend Milan's 13-match unbeaten record when the new season kicks off again in September.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old scored 10 goals in 18 Serie A appearances last season as Milan finished 6th</p>

<p>That is not enough for the forward, however, as he hopes to see the Milan fans heading back into the San Siro after the coronavirus pandemic forced matches to be played behind-closed-doors.</p>

<p>He added: 'I feel fine and in form. I hope to see the Milan fans back in the stadium soon.  </p>

<p>'The team needs its fans that blow the roof off at the San Siro.' </p>
