<p>Last week, Bella publicly slammed allegations she was an aspiring actress who once dreamt of moving to LA to further her career.</p>

<p>'I've never moved to LA, I've never wanted or tried to be an actress in Australia, never wanted or tried to get work as an actress in LA and certainly am not acting on the Bachelor,' she wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>Fancy that! It comes just days after a 2017 television advertisement for retail chain TK Maxx starring Bella surfaced online</p>

<p>Without naming names, she claimed that people had tried to 'fabricate' stories about her in order to feel 'relevant' and 'important'.</p>

<p>During an anonymous Q&amp;A session on The Bachelor last week, the other contestants surprised Bella with a question about her influencer career.</p>

<p>They asked her if she was on the show to get more followers, and she replied that she already had enough followers and was only interested in Locky Gilbert.</p>

<p>Locky was also asked if Bella was his 'favourite'. He responded by saying that he didn't have favourites and was still getting to know everyone.</p>
