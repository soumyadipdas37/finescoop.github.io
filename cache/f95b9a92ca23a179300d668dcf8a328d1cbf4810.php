<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New aerial photos have revealed  Anthony Hopkins' two luxury mansions which sit side-by-side and have a total worth of $12.6m (£9.7m) in the affluent Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The British actor, 83, splashed out on the first home in December 2018 and added the second house, at a price of $6m (£4.6m), to become his own neighbour and create a spacious and private compound in March 2019.</p>

<p>Anthony's first home which is seen in the new aerial shots boasts a more modern design with white roofing and wooden exteriors. </p>

<p>Luxury homes: New aerial photos reveal Anthony Hopkins' two LA mansions which sit side-by-side and are worth $12.6m to create his own private space in the Pacific Palisades area </p>

<p>The snaps also reveal plenty of balcony space to make the most of the sunshine at every level of the house as well as a small paved courtyard at the front and a large pool in the back.  </p>

<p>While the second home sits on the corner of the street and is given some extra privacy by being surrounded by large trees along one side. Pictures also reveal a garage and roof terrace on the property. </p>

<p>Sir Anthony, who is thought to have a fortune topping $160 million, is understood to divide his time fairly equally between the compound's two homes, which he shares with wife of 17 years actress Stella Arroyave, 64.  </p>

<p>Screen star: The Academy Award winner, 82, bought the first home in 2018 before adding the property next door in 2019</p>

<p>The couple can easily jump between the two mansions through a gate which crosses the driveway between the two properties and makes it simple to pop next door.  </p>

<p>The initial mansion he purchased – for $6m in December 2018 – is a more modern property boasting 5,700-square-feet of living space over three levels plus a rooftop deck with sweeping ocean views.</p>

<p>There are five bedrooms in total, with the main master suite on the third level and a balcony that also looks out onto the Pacific.</p>

<p>On the lower level Sir Anthony and his wife have a gym and yoga studio at their disposal, plus the home originally included a wine cellar – though that's unlikely to have been used, since the actor has been sober for 46 years.</p>

<p>So much space: Both of the homes boast rooftop areas, with the more modern style mansion (left) also having balconies on the front and a pool around the back</p>

<p>Relaxing: One of the homes aslso has a large pool and decking area in the back garden, perfect for relaxing in. The two homes appear to be linked with a gate making it easy for Anthony to visit both</p>

<p>A beautiful outdoor pool is in the garden, where flags can be seen fluttering over the water and a relaxing sun lounger sits nearby perfect for drying off on after a dip in the water. </p>

<p>In addition, a private seating area can be seen around the back yard, with white sun umbrellas to keep guests cool in the hot weather.</p>

<p>Less is known about Sir Anthony's second property on the compound, which was built in 1940 and upgraded 50 years later.</p>

<p>It sits on the corner of a suburban street, with noticeable features including a rooftop deck, spacious detached garage and a lush front lawn with two giant trees ensuring privacy from passers-by. </p>

<p>Stunning: As well as the modern wood-fronted home, Anthony also has the white home on the corner of the road which also has its own matching garage at the end of a driveway</p>

<p>Private: Tress surround the back of the two properties and go along the front of the white house with a brown roof</p>

<p>Seating: A spacious decking area is placed next to the pool and appears to lead behind next door's garage </p>

<p>An insider told MailOnline: 'Sir Anthony is an extremely private character, and he loves the tranquility that comes with living in the Palisades.</p>

<p>'He can do his own thing and spread himself between these charming residences, and he's obviously incredibly astute when it comes to real estate.'</p>

<p>As well as his two side-by-side mansions, Sir Anthony also has a smaller property in the area which he purchased in 2016 for $1.1million. He sold his prior main base, a beachfront mansion in Malibu, for $11.5m earlier this year.</p>

<p>That residence made headlines two years ago, when devastating wildfires reportedly threatened to destroy it but the home was remarkably left untouched by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. </p>

<p>Inside: The first home on the right of this aerial shot, which Anthony purchased in 2018, boasts five bedrooms with the master suite on the third level</p>

<p>Outdoor space: Although not appearing to have a pool, the corner mansion does have lots of grass along the side of the building as well as at the front yard area</p>

<p>Take a dip: Comfortable sun loungers and flags are seen by the pool in the back garden of the modern-style property</p>

<p>Making the most of both: Anthony is thought to split his time equally between the two houses when in LA (pictured the pool)</p>

<p>Zen: The homes boast lots of outdoor space and are not cluttered with chairs or belongings, making them perfect for relaxing</p>

<p>After this, Anthony is thought to have relocated to the Pacific Palisades area to be closer to downtown LA.</p>

<p>Thankfully Sir Anthony will have no such worries at his current abodes, which are noticeably different in style though similar in size. </p>

<p>Sir Anthony, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his star turn in 1991's Silence of the Lambs, was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 'The Two Popes' this year.</p>

<p>He also starred in TV's Westworld between 2016 and 2018, playing lead character Dr. Robert Ford.</p>

<p>Former abode: Anthony sold his beachfront mansion in Malibu (pictured) for $11.5m earlier this year and is thought to have moved to the affluent LA area to be closer to downtown LA</p>

<p>Escaped: The Malibu home (pictured) hit headlines in 2018 after it managed to escape wildfires in the area unscathed despite Anthony's former neighbour's home being destroyed</p>

<p>In a unique joint chat with Brad Pitt published by Interview magazine in 2019, he gave an insight into his down-to-earth personality that's made him so popular among his Hollywood peers.</p>

<p>He said: 'People ask me questions about present situations in life, and I say, 'I don't know, I'm just an actor. I don't have any opinions.</p>

<p>'Actors are pretty stupid. My opinion is not worth anything. There's no controversy for me, so don't engage me in it, because I'm not going to participate.'</p>

<p>Picturesque: The Malibu house also had lots of outdoor space as well as stunning seaviews</p>
