<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Excavations at a construction site for a train station in Japan have revealed an burial ground containing the bones of 350 people in tiny round graves.</p>

<p>The site — dubbed the 'Umeda Tomb' — is located in Osaka and is thought to be one of seven historical grave sites located across the city.</p>

<p>The burial ground dates to the late Edo and early Meiji eras — around the year 1868.</p>

<p>Osaka City's Board of Education and Cultural Heritage Association have been conducting surveys of the buried ruins in the area for almost three decades.</p>

<p>'It is probable that the people buried here were ordinary people who lived in and around Osaka Castle Town,' the Osaka City authorities said in a press release.</p>

<p>'In the northern part of the lower graveyard, simple burials that are bent over and stored in shallow holes or covered with soil are accumulated at a thickness of about one meter [three feet],' they continued</p>

<p>'Especially in the lowermost layer, a number of vertical holes in which multiple bodies were buried together were found.'</p>

<p>Experts believe that the shared graves likely represent those individuals who died together as a result of disease. </p>

<p>In addition to the human remains — which total some 1,500 bones — at the burial site, archaeologists have also uncovered the remains of a number of animals.</p>

<p>These include four piglets found in the northern part of the cemetery, and two horses in the south of the site. </p>

<p>Researchers also identified a bone from a cat, which was found contained within a human skeleton. </p>

<p>'The remains excavated, including human bones, are currently in the process of being sorted and analysed,' Osaka City authorities added.</p>

<p>It is expected that the remains will be relocated and re-buried, as to allow construction to continue after the archaeological survey has been completed. </p>
