<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The last time Leicester produced back-to-back wins at the beginning of a Premier League season, they ended it as champions.</p>

<p>Thanks to seven goals in their opening matches, the Foxes are back at the top of the tree again and while even the most optimistic Leicester fan would doubt their ability to repeat the fabulous story of 2015-16, this was just the start Brendan Rodgers’ team needed after their poor post-lockdown form cost them a place in the Champions League. </p>

<p>It was a double celebration for Rodgers, who registered his 100th win as a Premier League manager.</p>

<p>Leicester City are top of the league after their comeback win over Burnley on Sunday night</p>

<p>Burnley scored first, but Leicester dominated for large stretches of the Premier League game</p>

<p>The goal of the night came from Dennis Praet, who fired into the top corner powerfully</p>

<p>Harvey Barnes delivered an outstanding display, scoring the equaliser and terrifying Burnley throughout. Chris Wood gave the injury-hit visitors a 10th-minute lead but after Barnes levelled, an own-goal from Erik Pieters and James Justin’s strike put Leicester in charge just after an hour.</p>

<p>Jimmy Dunne pulled one back for Burnley on his top-flight debut but Dennis Praet’s sumptuous strike 11 minutes time settled it once and for all.</p>

<p>Leicester will need to defend better than they did here to keep out Arsenal in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday and Manchester City in the league next Sunday. Wood could have had a hat-trick for Burnley: as well as his goal, the forward hit the post and shot straight at Kasper Schmeichel from close range.</p>

<p>The Leicester players celebrate after Praet's superb goal from the edge of the penalty area</p>

<p>Chris Wood got a goal for his side, but in the end Leicester City were too much for them</p>

<p>It was a sad day for Robbie Brady, who went off with another injury during the first half</p>

<p>Despite missing key players Ben Mee, James Tarkowski, Jack Cork and Ashley Barnes, Burnley took the lead the 10th minute.</p>

<p>Dwight McNeil found Charlie Taylor on the left and when the cross reached Wood at the far post, he outmuscled Justin and slammed the ball beyond Schmeichel.</p>

<p>Leicester were convinced the forward was guilty of handling but after a VAR check, the ball was deemed to have hit Wood high enough on his arm for the goal to be legal. The Foxes rolled with the punch and levelled 10 minutes later.</p>

<p>Barnes swept a crossfield pass beyond the Burnley back line and into Jamie Vardy’s path. The forward found Timothy Castagne, who squared for Barnes to stroke the ball into the corner from 15 yards.</p>

<p>James Justin was able to get Leicester's third, on a difficult day for Burnley's defenders</p>

<p>Jimmy Dunne got a goal on his debut, but it wasn't enough to get Burnley back in the game</p>

<p>Jamie Vardy, usually a big part of Leicester's success, didn't actually have much involvement</p>

<p>Barnes then drew a fine save from Nick Pope with an angled effort tin the 33rd minute, and six minutes later Phil Bardsley produced a goal-saving challenge as Barnes tore towards the far post to meet Praet’s low cross.</p>

<p>Sean Dyche’s men suffered another injury blow soon afterwards when, following an earlier challenge from Justin, Robbie Brady was unable to continue and was replaced by Pieters.</p>

<p>Pieters might have wished he had stayed on the bench. Five minutes into the second half, after Youri Tielemans had found Castagne on the right, Pieters moved over to block the cross only for the ball to hit his heel and fly past the helpless Nick Pope at the near post.</p>

<p>Barnes continued to cause problems for Burnley and another charge into the box brought a corner, yet Leicester were lucky to stay ahead just before the hour mark when Wood shot weakly at Schmeichel after Jay Rodriguez teed him up 10 yards out.</p>

<p>Sean Dyche will be frustrated that his team were unable to be up to scratch defensively</p>

<p>It's two wins from two for Leicester, while Burnley have lost their opening game of the season</p>

<p>Harvey Barnes had an excellent game, seen celebrating here with his Leicester team-mates</p>

<p>Moments later, Burnley paid the ultimate price. Praet burst away down the right and found Perez inside the box. The Spaniard rolled the ball to the far post where Justin tapped it in for his first Premier League goal.</p>

<p>But Leicester switched off again at the back when McNeil swung over a free-kick and Dunne barged his way through the crowd to head it past Schmeichel.</p>

<p>The home side quickly restored their two-goal, however, with another goal of high quality. Barnes escaped yet again on the left and squared the ball for Praet, who used Castagne’s run outside him as a decoy before lashing the ball beyond Pope at his near post from 20 yards. There was still time for Wood to hit the post with Schmeichel beaten but Leicester’s slick attacking football merited the victory. </p>

<p>It was yet another Premier League goal-fest, with shots flying into the net in all the games</p>

<p>Sportsmail's MATT PORTER provided live EPL coverage of Leicester vs Burnley including score, lineups and build-up.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>100% start for Leicester then, and it's Brendan Rodgers' 100th win in the Premier League. Foxes are top of the league!</p>

<p>A very entertaining match, with twists and turns and comebacks. Yet another goal-fest... who'd be a goalkeeper?</p>

<p>Keep an eye out for the full match report coming soon. Whatever you're up to, enjoy the rest of your Sunday evening!</p>

<p>90+3 min: Game is petering out now, with Burnley leaving a few legs in here and there as their frustrating day comes to an end</p>

<p>Frustration from Bardsley there, who reacts as a free kick is given against him</p>

<p>88 min: Burnley are still trying, to be fair to them. Vydra turns well to hold up the ball, and he lays off Wood who's on his own inside the box. He beats Schmeichel, but the post denies him</p>

<p>87 min: Burnley do get a free kick in a decent position though. McNeil is standing over it, but it's Brownhill to take. It's close, but not close enough, as he's unable to get it up and down from the relatively short range</p>

<p>85 min: Leicester are looking for a fifth, while Burnley are looking to see how much longer they have to stay out on the pitch. Five minutes to go</p>

<p>83 min: Burnley look deflated now. That goal has finished them off from the looks of things.</p>

<p>Nice shot lad, but you're coming off, sorry</p>

<p>79 min: What. A. Hit.</p>

<p>Praet gets the ball on the edge of the box, and a run from Castagne to his right takes his marker away. He sets up and absolutely hammers it into the top right corner from 18 yards out. Pope is on that side of the goal already, but he doesn't even get a fingertip to it.</p>

<p>Is that going to be too much for Burnley to come back?</p>

<p>77 min: They're up for it! McNeil gets down to the byline and whips a great cross in, Pieters leaps above his man to head towards goal, but Schmeichel gets there this time</p>

<p>73 min: There's one though... A goal on Dunne's debut! The defender charges in for a cross, and once again Justin is out-muscled at the back post. Schmeichel is diving, but he can't reach it and it's in the back of the net!</p>

<p>Will the nerves get to Leicester in the final 15 minutes?</p>

<p>71 min: A Burnley cross comes in, but the spin and perhaps the wind takes it towards Schmeichel's net, who takes no chances in tipping it over. They're still giving it a go, but time is running out to get two goals</p>

<p>69 min: More good build up from Leicester. It was all down the left in the first half, but now the joy is coming down the right through Castagne. His cross is blocked and out for a corner</p>

<p>68 min: Burnley might have some fight yet! Wood holds it up in the box, passes it out to Taylor who crosses it in. Great ball, and Rodriguez has to improvise to get a volley away, but it whizzes over the bar</p>

<p>66 min: Vardy might have had a fourth for the Foxes then. He danced past a couple of players in the box, including the keeper, but there were too many Claret shirts still in the way</p>

<p>This two goal cushion should be enough for Leicester to see out the game now. And it could get worse for Burnley with 30 minutes to go.</p>

<p>Perez, who did so well in the build up for that goal, is now heading for the bench</p>

<p>61 min: 12th corner for Leicester. It's a short one, and the ball comes through to the middle, then back out to Tielemans, but he can't beat the first man with his cross. </p>

<p>Now they come down the right though, with Perez twisting and turning in the box. He feeds Justin, and he's able to calmly tuck it in the bottom left corner!</p>

<p>60 min: Castagne has shaken off whatever was troubling him, and is off with pace down the right. He cuts it inside, for Praet, but his shot goes high over the bar. Should've done better.</p>

<p>59 min: Burnley are pressing higher up now, putting a bit of pressure on Leicester as they try and play it out from the back. Rodriguez gets the ball from Westwood, who lays it off to Wood, but his strike isn't a good one, and it rolls through to Schmeichel.</p>

<p>Castagne is off the pitch at the moment, getting his shoulder seen to. Bardsley then gets caught, and he's in a bit of pain too.</p>

<p>53 min: Burnley send a corner through and there's a bit of pinball in the box, but Leicester clear. Vardy is on the break, but Taylor shows off some good pace to catch up with him and avert the danger.</p>

<p>Moments later Barnes has about three cracks at a shot, but each one is blocked and eventually it's a corner</p>

<p>50 min: And there it is. Justin is down the left, and he finds Tielemans in the middle. The Pirlo-esque pass comes through to Vardy, and his cross/shot takes a nasty deflection off the substitute Pieters and it's in the back of the net with Pope flailing. Unfortunate goal, but Leicester deserve the lead.</p>

<p>48 min: Burnley get a corner though, and it comes in with debutant Dunne trying to get on the end of it. He gets to it, but he can't direct it under the bar</p>

<p>46 min: Leicester on the attack straight away once again. They'll want to make sure they get a win here with the performance they've put in so far</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Burnley did well to get their opening goal, but Leicester have been dominant since then. They got the equaliser, and look good enough to get one or two more unless Sean Dyche can get his men back in the game in the second half</p>

<p>45+2 min: Burnley have 9 players in the box, trying with all their might to stop the waves of Leicester attacks. They're finding each other in patient build up, but aren't finding that final ball right now</p>

<p>45+1 min: That's a beautiful flick from Justin, laying it off for Praet on the edge of the box. He then feeds in Tielemans who's rushing in from behind, and his powerful shot is gathered up well by Pope</p>

<p>44 min: Burnley haven't had much going on in attack since they scored the goal early. It's all quietened down over the past few minutes. Couple of minutes until half time</p>

<p>Brady is off down the tunnel with the physio, more injury woes for the winger</p>

<p>40 min: Bardsley has to do well, and he does. Barnes is sliding in at the back post to try and poke the ball in, but the defender gets there first</p>

<p>38 min: Burnley are having to go long every time they win the ball back, and then Leicester can just come straight back again. Lots of pressure at the moment, especially down the left</p>

<p>34 min: Barnes tries his luck again, running in from the same angle as his last effort. He goes low this time, and Pope has to react quickly to get down to it and tip it wide.</p>

<p>31 min: Now Burnley have some joy, putting a few passes together. A shot comes in, and then a beautiful volley from Brady who runs in for the rebound, but it doesn't quite have the power to beat Schmeichel</p>

<p>29 min: It's all Leicester now, and they're coming forward in numbers. Perez has a shot blocked. Then Praet has a chance to get a pass away in the box but can't find his man</p>

<p>28 min: Barnes has some room, and he decides to make his way into the box and have a go himself, but it's not a great shot, flying high over the bar as he looks to curl it into the far corner</p>

<p>25 min: Mendy hacks down Brownhill, who has a quick change of direction to draw the foul. Yellow for the Leicester defender</p>

<p>24 min: Barnes does well again, cheekily kicking it against a Burnley man for a corner. It eventually comes out to him again but his second cross is claimed easily by Pope</p>

<p>20 min: They strike back just 10 minutes later! Barnes plays through Vardy, who holds the ball up well. He then feeds Castagne in the box, who lays it off to Barnes charging in behind him, and he slides it home! May have grazed Perez on the way through, but Barnes has claimed it for now</p>

<p>Wood has now scored in four Premier League games in a row, by the way. One for the fantasy team perhaps?</p>

<p>15 min: Dwight McNeil has a bit of a bloody mouth from the looks of things. Incidental contact with Ndidi, no foul given</p>

<p>13 min: Praet find himself with a bit of room, who then feed Perez in the box, but Long comes in to clear for a corner</p>

<p>10 min: Wow! The cross comes in and Wood shows he's been to the gym during lockdown. He takes it down with his chest under pressure, then shoves his man away and shoots low into the bottom corner. Poor Justin didn't know what hit him</p>

<p>8 min: Painful one. VAR is checking this one. Rodriguez slides in, studs up, catching his man, but a yellow card is deemed sufficient</p>

<p>7 min: Vardy is furious as the referee calls him for a foul. He was adamant he got the ball as he was pressing high up the pitch to try and get the ball back</p>

<p>4 min: Tielemans swings a free-kick in. Pope shouts 'keeper!' but a Burnley man gets in the way and it pings up in the air. They get away with the miscommunication though</p>

<p>3 min: Chris Wood started a run in his own half and is set away with a long ball. He doesn't quite have the pace to take it beyond Ndidi though, and Leicester regroup</p>

<p>1 min: Leicester come forward straight away, getting into the box, but the pass is wayward. Starting as they mean to go on</p>

<p>The players take a knee for a moment to highlight the ongoing fight against racial inequality, and then Burnley get us underway</p>

<p>Teams are heading out onto the pitch for the pre-match pageantry, and then we'll be underway</p>

<p>The players are finishing off their warm ups as we head towards kick-off, not long now!</p>

<p>Here are the results from today's other games:</p>

<p>Southampton 2-5 Tottenham</p>

<p>Newcastle 0-3 Brighton</p>

<p>Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool</p>

<p>And there were four more games yesterday:</p>

<p>Everton 5-2 West Brom</p>

<p>Leeds 4-3 Fulham</p>

<p>Manchester United 1-3 Crystal Palace</p>

<p>Arsenal 2-1 West Ham</p>

<p>A frankly dizzying amount of goals this weekend. Will we be seeing more this evening?</p>

<p>Leicester are up in 5th at the moment, and could potentially go top today with a win.</p>

<p>Burnley haven't played yet, as their game against Manchester United was postponed because the Red Devils were playing in the Europa League just a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>However, they did get a win over Sheffield United in the EFL Cup this week</p>

<p>Sean Dyche isn't too happy about his club's current transfer policy</p>

<p>He won't be playing today of course, but the winger is on his way to the King Power for the rest of this season, and potentially longer</p>

<p>Starting XI: Pope, Bardsley, Long, Dunne, Taylor, Westwood, Brownhill, McNeil, Brady, Wood, Rodriguez</p>

<p>Subs: Peacock-Farrell, Thomas, Pieters, Lowton, Benson, Vydra, Glennon</p>

<p>That's a Premier League debut for Jimmy Dunne, and Wood, McNeil and Bardsley have come in as changes from the last game</p>

<p>Starting XI: Schmeichel, Castagne, Ndidi, Soyuncu, Justin, Mendy, Praet, Tielemans, Perez, Barnes, Vardy</p>

<p>Subs: Ward, Morgan, Fuchs, Choudhury, Albrighton, Maddison, Iheanacho</p>

<p>No changes from Leicester's 3-0 opening game win</p>
