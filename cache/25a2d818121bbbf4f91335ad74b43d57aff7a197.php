<p>Chic: The radio presenter, 50, looked elegant yet cool in her 70s inspired outfit as she strutted towards her taxi and headed home</p>

<p>Physique: She tucked her denim shirt into her black straight-leg trousers which cut the perfect silhouette for her slender frame</p>

<p>Her recent appearance comes after Mel hit out at Keith Lemon as she criticised British men who try to emulate him with their 'limited vocabulary.'</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the presenter discussed her dating experiences and branded men as 'pretty basic and disappointing,' during an interview for her own Frank magazine.</p>

<p>She said: 'Sadly, in all realms of life, most men are pretty basic and disappointing. </p>

<p>Accessories: Mel added a retro touch with her blue-tinted aviator shades and accessorised the look with a black satchel bag and suede ankle boots</p>

<p>'I feel a bit sorry for British men who have adopted the limited vocabulary of the television character Keith Lemon when talking about and to women.</p>

<p>'I would be surprised, and indeed it would be a miracle, if any of these men are actually getting laid.'  </p>

<p>Mel has previously appeared on Celebrity Juice where comedian Leigh Francis takes on the persona of host Keith. </p>

<p>Conversation: Mel recently hit out at Keith Lemon as she branded men 'basic and limited' during a rant about her love life</p>

<p>In light of her comments, Keith told The Sun he contacted Mel, who said she was merely referencing the persona he portrays on screen. </p>

<p>He said: 'I reached out to her and asked why she didn’t like me. She said, "It’s not you, it’s your on-screen persona."</p>

<p>The star then noted some of his career achievements over the years as he defended himself.</p>

<p>Keith added: 'Well if anyone’s watching and you have a limited vocabulary, you can still win two Baftas and two NTAs. I don’t want to boast about all the things I’ve won.' </p>

<p>Not happy: In light of her comments, Leigh Francis -whose alter-ego is Keith- said he contacted Mel who said she was merely referencing the persona he portrays on screen (pictured in 2019)</p>
