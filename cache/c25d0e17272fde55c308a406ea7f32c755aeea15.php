<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bargain-hunting mother has bagged an enormous haul of meat and treats for just $9 at Coles.</p>

<p>For that price, she bought 19 packets of free range chicken wings - each reduced from roughly $5 to between 4c and 6c - along with 10 packs of Tim Tams discounted to 54c, two trays of 27c brioche buns and two 35c bottles of fruit juice.</p>

<p>Photos of her low-cost shop caught attention after they were shared in an Australian budgeting group on Facebook, with the mum telling members she feels 'like a billionaire' for scoring so much food at such a reasonable price.</p>

<p>But while many were impressed by her frugality, others spotted a contradiction in the corner of the photos - a bubblegum pink kettle from luxury appliance label Smeg which retails for $219. </p>

<p>An Australian mother bagged this extraordinary haul of 19 packs of free range chicken wings for just $9 - along with a benchtop full of sweet treats</p>

<p>'$200 kettle. 5c meat packs. That's how it's done people,' one woman replied. </p>

<p>'Is the Smeg also on bargain (sic)?' asked a second, while a third said buying meat on clearance was the only way to afford such upscale household accessories.</p>

<p>People were quick to jump to the mother's defence, with one woman arguing she could have received the kettle as a gift.</p>

<p>'How do you know she wasn't given it or saved or months? And isn't everyone allowed to enjoy bargains, oh my God,' said another.</p>

<p>Also included in the discount shop were 10 packs of Tim Tams discounted to 54c, two trays of 27c brioche buns and two 35c bottles of fruit juice (pictured)</p>

<p>And despite some criticism, the photos also drew dozens of delighted responses praising the other's eye for markdowns with comments including 'great haul', 'omg what a massive score' and 'well, I'm jealous'.</p>

<p>'Why doesn't my local supermarket mark down like that?' one woman asked.</p>

<p>'Wow, that's awesome! Good on you. In ones near me they take like five percent off max, well done,' said another. </p>

<p>Others hailed the mum as a 'bargain queen' and said they hoped to find similar deals in the near future. </p>
