<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign raised $3.8 million in the best online fundraising hour of all time at the conclusion of the first presidential debate Tuesday night. </p>

<p>'Joe Biden spoke directly to the American people tonight and they are responding,' Biden's Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield told reporters in a late Tuesday night call. 'We broke the single hour record for a campaign ever on ActBlue and we broke our own record and raised 3.8 million between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock. </p>

<p>The debate between Biden and President Donald Trump kicked off at 9 p.m. and wrapped up about 90 minutes later.   </p>

<p>As September wraps up this week, the fresh millions will likely help Biden and the Democrats continue their fundraising advantage, which would have been unheard of earlier this year. </p>

<p>A message to a Trump campaign spokesperson on the president's debate night fundraising numbers has so far gone unreturned. </p>

<p>In August - the month Biden announced Sen. Kamala Harris would join him on the ticket and the Democrats held their mostly virtual convention - Democratic fundraising totaled an eyeball-popping $364.5 million. </p>

<p>In comparison, Trump and Republicans raised $210 million. </p>

<p>CNBC reported earlier this week that the GOP and Trump are trailing the Democrats and Biden by about $140 million in cash-on-hand. </p>

<p>For months, Trump and Republicans had the fundraising advantage as Biden battled it out with other Democrats during the spring primaries. </p>

<p>But the former vice president had the nomination essentially wrapped up by mid-March, around the same time lockdowns began due to the coronavirus pandemic.   </p>

<p>As CNBC reported, a big reason Biden now has the advantage is because of all of his virtual campaigning, including spending hours each week fundraising via Zoom.   </p>

<p>Trump, on the other hand, has continued to host large in-person rallies - which are more expensive - and also continues to fundraise in person. </p>

<p>For example, he stopped at his Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C. for under two hours on Friday to get a fundraiser in before jetting off to Virginia, where he had scheduled an additional rally.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign not only pointed to the fundraising haul, but said voter registration interest also ticked up during Tuesday night's presidential debate.   </p>

<p>'You also heard the VP speak about IWillVote.com, call out IWillVote.com, that call-out led to the most concurrent users in the website's history,' she said.  </p>
