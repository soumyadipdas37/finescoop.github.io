<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother who spent the past 18 years behind bars after killing her two young children has been released from jail.</p>

<p>Louise Anne Scotchmer, from Western Australia, was accused of using a blanket to smother her two-week-old baby Shane to death in 1994 and her 13-month-old daughter Melissa two years later.</p>

<p>She was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 with a minimum non-parole period of 16 years.</p>

<p>Scotchmer pleaded not guilty to both murders on grounds of insanity and earlier revealed she didn't know why she had harmed her children.</p>

<p>She was found guilty on two counts of wilful murder in the Supreme Court and was sent to the Bandyup Women's Prison in Perth's north-east.</p>

<p>Scotchmer was released on parole on Monday. </p>

<p>Louise Anne Scotchmer (pictured with husband and daughter Melissa) from Western Australia will walk free from jail after 18 years after she was convicted of murdering her two children</p>

<p>The WA Prisoners Review Board found Scotchmer had joined a re-socialisation program last year targeted at women facing long sentences to help them return to society, the West Australian reported.</p>

<p>The board sent a report to the Attorney General John Quigley recommending he be 'advised to release Ms Scotchmer to parole for a period of five years.' </p>

<p>'On 14 September, 2020 the board met and determined Ms Scotchmer's release date as 21 September, 2020,' the board said.</p>

<p>While on parole, Scotchmer is not allowed to be with children unsupervised under the age of 13.</p>

<p>She is also disallowed from drinking alcohol, attending any pubs and must undergo counselling. </p>

<p>The mother told the publication in 2010 she had photos of her children in her cell but struggled to look at them on 'bad days'.</p>

<p>'When in this state I will cry for many hours, wanting them to return. It is an especially hard time when their birthdays come around each year,' she earlier said.</p>

<p>'To this day I have no idea whether I was insane or not at the time of the babies' deaths. I have never known why I harmed the babies.'</p>

<p>Scotchmer had also been aquitted of trying to murder her third son in 2000 during a house fire. </p>

<p>He supported her through her time in prison, the board said.     </p>
