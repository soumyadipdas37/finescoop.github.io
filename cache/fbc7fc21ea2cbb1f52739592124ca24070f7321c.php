<p>British makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury's new Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes mascara was only released last week, but it has already received huge acclaim from beauty bloggers and experts - who say it is a 'miracle' product and the 'best mascara in the world'.</p>

<li><p>NATURAL WAXES: Carnauba wax also known as the 'Queen of Waxes' and Microcrystalline wax add body and texture to the formula for weightless volume.</p></li>
<li><p>KERATIN: Keratin ceates a super-strong conditioning effect on individual hair fibres to create a thicker look and feel on the lashes.</p></li>

<p>BEFORE AND AFTER: Thousands who have managed to get their hands on the sellout product have shared before-and-after photos that illustrate just how transformative it is for your lashes</p>

<p>A staggering 96 per cent of women who have tried the mascara agreed that their lashes are magnified and amplified as a result of using it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 93 per cent said it gives their eyelashes a 'voluminous definition'.</p>

<p>Charlotte Tilbury (pictured with Amal Clooney) has been known to launch products which quickly sell out around the world</p>

<p>One of the reasons why the mascara is so innovative is because it is made with keratin, which creates a conditioning effect on individual hair fibres to give the illusion of a thicker look and feel on the lashes.</p>

<p>It also boasts carnauba wax, which is also known as the 'queen of waxes' and micorcrystalline wax, which gives weightless volume and a false eyelash-style finish.  </p>

<p>The mascara is available in one shade, 'Super Black', and in one size, a 10mL bottle. </p>
