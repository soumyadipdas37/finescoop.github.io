<p>Talking candidly: Pregnant Chezzi Denyer revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show this week if she ever worries about husband Grant cheating on her - after they admitted their romance started as an affair while they both worked at Sunrise</p>

<p>Shock jock Kyle Sandilands asked: 'Chezzi, when Grant goes off to do his other TV stuff and comes home now you're not his producer, do you smell his penis or something to make sure he's not still doing the same things?'</p>

<p>He added: 'There's got to be some level of worry in there.'</p>

<p>Chezzi, 41, immediately said that she trusts Grant through and through. </p>

<p>'I don't feel worried at all': Chezzi, 41, immediately said that she trusts Grant through and through</p>

<p>'I don't feel worried at all, he's away a lot,' Chezzi said. </p>

<p>She added: 'I don't feel worried at all... I have to unpack his bag.'</p>

<p>Kyle added: 'That's where the woman finds out what the man is doing!' </p>

<p>They also spoke about how their romance started, which happened when they both worked together at Sunrise. </p>

<p>Grant, 43, said that they 'hated each other,' but one night they had drinks and their hands touched and he realised he was in love with her, despite both of them having other partners at the time.     </p>

<p>Their story: They also spoke about how their romance started, which happened when they both worked together at Sunrise. Grant, 43, said that they 'hated each other,' but one night they had drinks and their hands touched and he realised he was in love with her</p>

<p>'You might think this is made up, but it's not. It was old fashioned. We had a couple of drinks and were standing there and I accidentally turned around and brushed hands with her,' Grant said. </p>

<p>'And I felt this crazy tingle from head to toe... and I was like, "oh my God, I love this woman, I need her in my life."</p>

<p>He added: 'From hatred to full blown love. I didn't even know it existed.'  </p>

<p>On their It's All True podcast earlier this month, Chezzi revealed that she and Grant started dating when they were both in relationships with other people. </p>

<p>'It was a rough journey - it wasn't like what you see in the movies,' said Chezzi, who was Grant's producer on Sunrise when he joined the program as a weatherman.  </p>

<p>'It was a rough journey': On their It's All True podcast earlier this month, Chezzi revealed that she and Grant started dating when they were both in relationships with other people</p>

<p>When they first got together, Chezzi was married to another man, and Grant was dating another woman.</p>

<p>'It was problematic; it took a long time to navigate,' Grant said.</p>

<p>Working together complicated matters, as Seven executives were convinced Chezzi was leaking stories about the pair to the press. </p>

<p>She feared the network would send her off to Cairns or Townsville as a punishment, but instead she decided to leave television altogether.</p>

<p>'In the end I left TV. I couldn't deal with it. My parents were petrified. I basically ran away and moved back to Bathurst,' she said. </p>

<p>The Denyers did not confirm their relationship for a while, and even Grant's family didn't know how serious things were between them.</p>

<p>But everything changed when Grant broke his back in a monster truck accident in 2008.</p>

<p>'At the time we hadn't confirmed our relationship,' Chezzi said. 'Grant's family didn't know about me, but we had been living together for three months.' </p>

<p>Grant's mother apparently didn't want the couple living together, fearing Chezzi was a 'gold digger', but they persevered nonetheless. </p>

<p>Chezzi remained by Grant's side every step of the way during his recovery, and they ended up marrying in 2010.</p>

<p>They share two daughters, Sailor, eight, and Scout, four, and Chezzi recently confirmed she was pregnant with their third child.</p>
