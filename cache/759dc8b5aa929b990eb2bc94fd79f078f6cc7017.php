<p>Buckingham Palace released a statement this morning that read: 'Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie and Mr Jack Brooksbank are very pleased to announce that they are expecting a baby in early 2021.</p>

<p>'The Duke of York and Sarah, Duchess of York, Mr and Mrs George Brooksbank, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are delighted with the news.'</p>

<p>Princess Eugenie shared the news on her Instagram shortly afterwards.  </p>

<p>The Royal Family shared their congratulations on social media, echoing the best wishes expressed in the statement and accompanying them with a sweet photo of the couple on their wedding day in October 2018.</p>

<p>Sarah Ferguson added to the well-wishes this afternoon. Speaking to Hello!, she said: 'Soon to be Granny and Granddad are absolutely overjoyed!'  </p>

<p>'Overjoyed!' Sarah Ferguson shared her excitement on behalf of herself and Andrew, saying: 'Soon to be Granny and Granddad are absolutely overjoyed!' Pictured, Andrew and Fergie with Beatrice (left) and Eugenie in an Instagram snap shared over lockdown</p>

<p>Out this month: Expectant mother Princess Eugenie was spotted strolling through London on September 18. She wore a floaty dress that skimmed her midriff and a cross-body bag</p>

<p>Last seen: Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank were most recently seen at Annabel's in London on Tuesday night. They were joined at the private members' club by Beatrice</p>

<p>Tributes flooded in from royal fans, while Princess Eugenie's aunt Jane Ferguson - sister to the Duchess of York - commented: 'So happy for you both,' followed by two purple heart emojis.</p>

<p>Eugenie and Jack, who spent lockdown at Fergie and Prince Andrew's home on the Queen's Windsor estate, were last seen on Tuesday night when they joined Princess Beatrice for a night out at private members' club Annabel's. </p>

<p>Eugenie concealed any hint of a baby bump with a long flowing black top worn under a loose coat that she wore untied at the waist. </p>

<p>The expectant mother was also recently seen strolling through London on September 18. She looked radiant in a floaty summer dress that skimmed over her midriff and wore a bag slung across her body.  </p>

<p>Official announcement: The Royal Family shared their congratulations on social media, echoing the best wishes expressed in the statement and accompanying them with a sweet photo of the couple on their wedding day in October 2018</p>

<p>Excited aunt: Princess Eugenie's aunt Jane Ferguson - sister to the Duchess of York - commented: 'So happy for you both,' followed by two purple heart emojis</p>

<p>Her sister Princess Beatrice, who married property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in July, is no doubt excited to become an aunt for the first time. </p>

<p>The 32-year-old was seen shopping at baby shop The Little White Company earlier this month, perhaps picking up a present for her new niece or nephew. </p>

<p>Bea donned a face mask as she popped into the store in London, while Edo patiently waited in the car for her - their first public appearance together since their secret wedding in the summer.</p>

<p>The happy news will no doubt be welcomed by grandfather-to-be Prince Andrew, 60, who remains plagued by controversy over his friendship with the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was arrested for her role in allegedly procuring young girls for the financier.</p>

<p>The princess wore a protective face mask during her outing on September 18 and accessorised with a pair of sunglasses</p>

<p>This week a bombshell new book claimed the 'playboy' Duke was 'obsessed with redheads and slept with at least a dozen beautiful women,' reportedly procured for him by billionaire Epstein.</p>

<p>Canadian author Ian Halperin claims to have spoken to at least a dozen of the Duke of York's former lovers for his book, Sex Lies and Dirty Money by the World's Powerful Elite.</p>

<p>A source close to the Duke described the claims as 'sensationalised,' saying the claims were from women 'lacking the conviction to attach their names to them'. </p>

<p>Princess's Eugenie's child will be 11th in line for the throne once it's born in early 2021</p>
