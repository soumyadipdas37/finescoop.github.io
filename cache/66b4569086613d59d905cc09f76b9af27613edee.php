<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Real Madrid are set to test their whole squad for Covid-19 following a reported positive test for midfielder Martin Odegaard.</p>

<p>The news comes after recent footage emerged showing the Norwegian star shaking hands with Real Sociedad's bench before Madrid's 0-0 draw with their LaLiga counterparts on Sunday.</p>

<p>Both teams had mandatory coronavirus tests following the game - and just hours after Odegaard had greeted his former team-mates - but Spanish radio station Onda Cero are reporting the 21-year-old was the only positive test.</p>

<p>Real Madrid will test their entire squad for coronavirus after Martin Odegaard's positive test</p>

<p>But having taken part in training with Odegaard on Tuesday, the whole of Zinedine Zidane's squad will have to undergo a new PCR test to see if there was a spread of the infection.</p>

<p>Should Odegaard's positive test be confirmed by the club, he will miss the LaLiga champions' trip to Real Betis and the visit of Real Valladolid the following week while he self-isolates.</p>

<p>In such a case, the Norwegian would become the second Real Madrid player to contract the virus after Mariano Diaz tested positive in July. </p>

<p>However, Real will hold hope of a false positive test, which happened to Thibaut Courtois while away with Belgium on international duty. </p>

<p>Odegaard then tested positive after the 0-0 draw, hours after greeting the Sociedad bench</p>

<p>Real will hold out hope it is a false positive just as Thibaut Courtois had when with Belgium</p>

<p>Norway international Odegaard spent last season on loan at Sociedad but lined up against his former team-mates in from the start in San Sebastian to make only his third appearance for Real on Sunday.</p>

<p>After being given the nod ahead of Casemiro, he insisted he was happy to be playing for the club again but was not satisfied that there was no winning start for Real.</p>

<p>Odegaard told Spanish channel Movistar+: 'I feel good but we're missing the win.</p>

<p>'It doesn't leave me very happy, although it's good to play for Real Madrid again.</p>

<p>'It was a game against friends and good people.'</p>

<p>But if confirmed Odegaard will be the second positive test after Mariano Diaz's in July</p>
