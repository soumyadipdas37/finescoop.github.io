<p>As well as jet-setting across Europe, Montana was recently feeling reflective as she took to her YouTube channel to post a candid video about her love life.  </p>

<p>Reflecting on her split from model Elliott Reeder earlier this year, Montana insisted she is the happiest she has ever been after a 'life-changing' few months.</p>

<p>The star also revealed she is single but has been dating many suitors since their break-up, after she was linked to Waltham Abbey FC footballer Charlie Edwards.</p>

<p>Cheeky! Last week, the beauty sent temperatures soaring on in a sizzling snap from her birthday getaway to Greece where she posed topless in black thong bikini bottoms </p>

<p>Montana said: 'I am officially single, but actually loving it. Also the show must go on, I'm feeling pretty fresh, I mean I wasn't feeling fresh when it first happened, don't get me wrong, I was pretty down in the dumps.</p>

<p>'But I feel like everything happens for a reason, I've been really able to focus on myself and my personal growth, personal goals. I've met some amazing people along the way, I think everything happens for a reason.' </p>

<p>Montana was linked to Waltham Abbey FC footballer Charlie in June.</p>

<p>Wow: It comes after the reality star jokingly pretended to accept an award in an Instagram video earlier this week as she mimed thanking an audience while an applause track played</p>

<p>The two are said to have met on invite-only dating app Elite and went on a socially-distanced date in the park where they enjoyed a scenic walk.</p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'I know Charlie's been talking to her for a few weeks - and they went on a date recently.</p>

<p>He picked her up and they went for a walk in a park, which I think was near her, and played a bit of tennis. </p>

<p>'I think they got on well. She's very funny, I know that.'</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted both Montana and Charlie's representatives for comment at the time.</p>
