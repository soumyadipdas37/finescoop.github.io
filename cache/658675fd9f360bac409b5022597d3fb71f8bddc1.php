<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Taco Bell has debuted a new red wine to pair with it a brand-new cheesy chalupa — but it's only available in Canada.</p>

<p>The Mexican food chain unveiled the limited-edition vino this week, a pinot noir — called Jalapeño Noir — that comes with three collectible labels.</p>

<p>The wine, which will sell for $25 CAD, is meant to go perfectly with the restaurant's new Toasted Cheesy Chalupa.</p>

<p>Yum! The Jalapeño Noir launched online and at select Taco Bell restaurants in Canada today</p>

<p>Sounds good! It was made by Queenston Mile Vineyard in Ontario and has notes of wild strawberry, cherry, and beetroot</p>

<p>Starting today, it is available to purchase at select locations in Hamilton and Toronto via Uber Eats.  </p>

<p>An online run sold out within hours, but Taco Bell announced on Twitter that it is considering a restock. </p>

<p>'Wine and cheese are simply meant to be together, so launching a new wine to go with the craveable, cheddary Toasted Cheesy Chalupa made perfect sense,' Kat Garcia, Director of Brand Marketing, said in a press release. </p>

<p>'At Taco Bell Canada, we love to raise our glass to big, bold ideas that elevate our menu items, and pairing our Toasted Cheesy Chalupa with this Jalapeño Noir is no exception.'</p>

<p>Though the wine doesn't appear to be launching at any point in other countries, the new Toasted Cheddar Chalupa will also be available in the U.S. in November.  </p>

<p>It's made with six-month aged sharp cheddar cheese on the shell, as well as beef, lettuce, tomatoes, grated cheddar, and sour cream inside.  </p>

<p>Cool! Last summer, Taco Bell opened a pop-up hotel and resort in Palm Springs, California, complete with themed decor, merchandise, and lots and lots of food </p>

<p>In demand: The Bell: A Taco Bell Hotel and Resort will opened for one weekend only, from August 8 to 12, at the V Palm Spring — and all the reservations were snapped up in minutes </p>

<p>Amenities: In addition to Taco Bell-themed decor, there were also taco-inspired poolside cocktails, a gift shop, and even a salon offering up Taco Bell inspired beauty </p>
