<p>Princess Diana died at the age of 36 when the car she was travelling in crashed in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997, with yesterday marking the 23rd anniversary of her death </p>

<p>Sharing an image of a bench on the estate, he wrote: 'Lovely flowers from all sorts of kind people today, and recently, at Althorp House. Thanks to all of them.'</p>

<p>It comes after May Lloyd, the widow of the former national director of one of the royal's most beloved charity's, recalled  Princess Diana 'left people with the feeling they mattered'.</p>

<p>May, the widow of The Leprosy Mission, Tony Lloyd, told how the late Princess of Wales had a skill for making people feel important - no matter who and where they were.</p>

<p>'Diana left people with the feeling they mattered and were important, she understood what they were going through - whether she was speaking to a fellow mother or to a person affected by leprosy,' she said, speaking to The Express.</p>

<p>Princess Diana's younger brother shared the tributes yesterday and thanked well wishers for their support </p>

<p>May, who was speaking on the 23rd anniversary of Diana's death, went on to praise Prince William and Harry's later mother for having 'great empathy,' too. </p>

<p>'She had great empathy with people,' May added. 'She didn't mind shaking hands, cuddling, sitting on the beds of people who were ill.' </p>

<p>In April 1987, Princess Diana shook hands with a gay man who was dying of AIDS.</p>

<p>The People's Princess touched the unnamed man without wearing gloves, challenging the previously believed notion the disease could be passed via skin-to-skin contact.</p>

<p>It comes after May Lloyd said Princess Diana 'left people with the feeling they mattered' (pictured, the royal offers comfort to a hospital patient on March 4, 1993 in Kathmandu, Nepal)</p>

<p>She was quoted as saying: 'HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it'. </p>

<p>Then, in 1989, Princess Diana was seen shaking hands and touching bandages of people affected by the disease while visiting a Leprosy Mission hospital in Sitanala, Indonesia.</p>

<p>May's comments come days after it was revealed plans for a statue that was commissioned to mark the twentieth anniversary of Princess Diana's death will now be installed at Kensington Palace next year. </p>

<p>It comes days after the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge announced a statue is to be installed in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace to mark what would have been her 60th birthday (Princess Diana with her sons Prince William and Prince Harry at Wetherby School on September 12, 1989 in London)</p>

<p>A statement on behalf of the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge issued by Kensington Palace read: 'The statue that Prince William and Prince Harry have commissioned to commemorate their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, will be installed next year on what would have been her 60th birthday.'  </p>

<p>It will be installed in the Sunken Garden of Kensington Palace on 1st July 2021, marking The Princess's 60th birthday.</p>

<p>The brothers announced the commission of the statue two years ago on the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana's death.     </p>

<p>The princess loved to walk in the palace gardens and would often stop to chat to the staff. Pictured, the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace</p>
