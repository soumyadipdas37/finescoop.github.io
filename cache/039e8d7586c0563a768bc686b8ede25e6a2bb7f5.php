<p>'The regiment's coastal rangers and naval personnel have a variety of advanced, highly mobile weapon systems giving them the capability to control coastal areas effectively,' it added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 4th Naval Warfare Flotilla is tasked with a variety of roles including submarine hunting and naval and airspace surveillance.</p>

<p>Known as Sweden's real-life Prince Charming, Carl Philip broke the hearts of royal-watchers across the globe when he announced his engagement to former reality TV star Sofia Hellqvist in 2014, four years after news of their relationship first hit headlines.</p>

<p>The couple welcomed their first son, Prince Alexander, in April 2016 and another little boy, Prince Gabriel, arrived in August the following year.</p>

<p>The prince is the only son of the King and Queen of Sweden and is fourth-in-line to the throne.</p>

<p>In 1980 a law was passed which gave his older sister Victoria precedence in the line of succession.</p>

<p>The royal's visit comes after his wife Princess Sofia of Sweden said she would never want a version of 'Megxit' to happen within her royal family - stating she has 'found such a fantastic balance'. </p>

<p>The 35-year-old royal shared her thoughts in a documentary titled Princess Sofia: Project Playground which aired on Swedish channel TV4. </p>

<p>According to Royal Central, when asked about whether she would ever consider following the lead of the Duke, 35, and Duchess of Sussex, 39, the former model said: 'No. Not really. I think I have found such a fantastic balance, and I really see it as a positive that I have made it through these stormy years. </p>

<p>'It is such a huge advantage, in that we have the opportunity to stand a little in both worlds.'  </p>

<p>Princess Sofia has much in common with Meghan with neither having any royal connections when they met their princes - Harry and Carl Philip - and leaving behind the showbiz world for a rather more sedate life. </p>
