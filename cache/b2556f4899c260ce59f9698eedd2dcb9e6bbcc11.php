<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There were plenty of tears and tantrums during Thursday's season finale of The Bachelor - but there was one thing missing from the closing scenes: host Osher Günsberg.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old revealed on the Cocktails and Roses podcast on Friday that he'd filmed his usual interview segments, but they were left on the cutting room floor for 'editorial' reasons.</p>

<p>He said the post-production team made the decision to edit out his 'pep talks' with Locky Gilbert and his two finalists because they interrupted the emotional flow of the episode.</p>

<p>Where was he? Host Osher Günsberg has revealed why he was edited out of Thursday night's finale of The Bachelor</p>

<p>Right before Locky decided between his two finalists, Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska, viewers watched him break down in a piece-to-camera confessional.</p>

<p>Osher explained that this unplanned moment made producers realise they didn't need his interviews to build up tension ahead of the final scenes.</p>

<p>'I was there. I was absolutely there. And I did all of the chats. I did all of the proud dad stuff. I did the [interviews] when the girls got out of the car, I did all that,' he said.</p>

<p>Cut! The 46-year-old revealed on the Cocktails and Roses podcast on Friday that he'd filmed his usual interview segments, but they were left on the cutting room floor for 'editorial' reasons. Pictured: Locky Gilbert breaks up with Bella Varelis during the finale</p>

<p>'I did the chat with Locky. I gave him that "come on, mate, this is it." I gave them all the pep talks and all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>'However, the way that it happened with Locky's interview and the way he was so intensely emotional in that interview - which was I think the morning of [the finale] - going to ad break with him in this jeopardy moment of "I don't know what to do" and cutting straight to the girls was the right editorial decision. </p>

<p>'Otherwise, the energy would have been gone.'</p>

<p>Osher clarified that he 'still got paid for the day' even though his scenes weren't aired, and said he didn't mind being cut because The Bachelor 'isn't about me'.</p>

<p>He added that he watched Locky, 31, break up with Bella and subsequently declare his love for Irena from a production tent nearby along with the rest of the crew.</p>

<p>Later, he tweeted that the moment was so excruciating he could 'barely watch'.  </p>

<p>Osher's revelation comes after a conflicted Locky chose Irena, 31, as his winning contestant during The Bachelor's emotional finale on Thursday.</p>

<p>'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told her.</p>

<p>'When I think about our future together, I'm so excited and I can't wait to just travel the world and make all your dreams come true.</p>
