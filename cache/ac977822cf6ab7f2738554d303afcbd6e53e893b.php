<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Episodes four to six of Amazon Prime's All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur are released this weekend as Spurs' 2019-20 season moves into the festive period and New Year.</p>

<p>Having been appointed manager in November, we see star of the show Jose Mourinho settle in the role, though his honeymoon period comes to an end with a winless run over the festive period while Christian Eriksen and Danny Rose angle for moves, with the latter's explosive meeting with the boss the undoubted highlight.</p>

<p>There are also injuries for key men Harry Kane and Son Heung-min to contend with, while the 2-0 home win over Manchester City is celebrated.</p>

<p>Here, Sportsmail runs you through five things we learned from episodes four to six of All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho's row with Danny Rose is the highlight of the latest All or Nothing episodes</p>

<p>Berating 'f<strong><em>ing lazy' Dele Alli, slating Serge Aurier's 's</em></strong> marking' and vowing to take Harry Kane to Ronaldo and Messi's level - Tottenham's new documentary delivers incredible insight into how Jose Mourinho works </p>

<p>Mourinho names the Tottenham star Fergie told him to buy at United, Kane slams team for 'hiding' in Old Trafford loss and Jose reveals the best professional he ever coached - 15 THINGS WE LEARNED from the first three episodes of All or Nothing</p>

<p>A recurring theme throughout All or Nothing so far has been Mourinho's attempts to make his Spurs team nastier. He puts this into practice in episode five when he points out, with admiration, how Pep Guardiola's Manchester City players surrounded the referee to try and pressure him into awarding them a penalty. 'This is the difference between a team of f****** c**** and a team of good guys,' Jose tells his players. 'But the story of football is that teams of good guys, they never win. So f****** hell, be a team of c****.' He then highlights which City are players are on yellow cards - encouraging his team to try and get them sent off. In the second half, City left back Oleksandr Zinchenko is given a second yellow and Spurs win 2-0. </p>

<p>Daniel Levy has never sought the limelight in his 19 years as Spurs chairman and rarely gives interviews. In this series, it has been easy to see why. Of all the dozens of players and staff who appear on camera, Levy is the most awkward. He always seems to be aware of the camera's presence - which could lead some cynics to argue his every appearance is stage-managed. The only difference between Levy's performances in his meetings and Ricky Gervais' David Brent is a look directly into the camera and a smile.</p>

<p>The most notable absentee from the docuseries so far has been Spurs' £54million record signing Tanguy Ndombele. Admittedly, his fellow big name arrival from last year Giovani Lo Celso has also not featured, but the fact Ndombele's refusal to play against Brighton on Boxing Day was not included at all was very odd, especially when Spurs happy to show Mourinho's explosive meeting with Danny Rose. </p>

<p>Japhet Tanganga is a major focus in episode four, with an injury crisis thrusting the Hackney-born defender into Mourinho's first-team in January. He takes to the challenge like a duck to water and speaks passionately about his career to date, revealing that London rivals Chelsea scouted him before Spurs, but did not snap him up.</p>

<p>From the outside looking in, it is perhaps as a surprise that England captain Harry Kane is not the skipper of his club, where he is undoubtedly the star player. However, footage from All or Nothing so far has revealed what an impressive leader Hugo Lloris is, while Mourinho and others admit that Kane is more a leader by example than with words, as evidenced by his somewhat uninspiring team-talks shown by Amazon so far. In contrast, Lloris speaks brilliantly at half-time in the FA Cup win over Southampton, and it is clear that his team-mates hang on his every word.</p>

<p>Mourinho's second downfall at Chelsea infamously began with him berating team doctor Eva Carneiro for treating Eden Hazard on the pitch when he wanted to waste time, and his prickliness towards medical staff has certainly not abated. Spurs' medical chief Geoff Scott and his team clearly know what they are doing, but Mourinho's encounters with them leave you squirming in your seat as he demands that players return quickly from injury. </p>

<p>Kane has increasingly flirted with the idea of leaving Tottenham in the last year and his response to Christian Eriksen's departure seemed poignant. 'He wanted a new challenge, you can't blame someone for wanting to try something new,' the England captain said. If Spurs struggle to challenge this season, he could find himself saying those very words to Mourinho before too long.</p>
