<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jon Gosselin, who gained fame as the father of twins and sextuplets on the hit reality show Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8, recently enjoyed a brief trip to Florida with girlfriend Colleen Conrad, two of his eight kids and some friends.</p>

<p>And on Sunday Conrad took to Instagram to share a series of photos taken during their holiday in the sun on the beaches of Ponte Vedra, which is near Jacksonville in the northeast part of the state.</p>

<p>'A quick, short but amazing and also needed quick vacation! Love my family and our friends in Ponte Vedra!!!' she wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>Family time: Jon Gosselin, 43, enjoyed a quick vacation to Florida this past weekend with his girlfriend Colleen Conrad and two of his eight kids, Collin and Hannah</p>

<p>All five of the photos were taken on a boardwalk, near the sand, with the Atlantic Ocean used as the the backdrop. </p>

<p>In one, Gosselin and Conrad flashed big beaming smiles and had their arms around his daughter Hannah and son Collin, 16.</p>

<p>There's also one where the former reality star gave Conrad a piggyback ride as the waves came crashing onto the beach, and a group snap of the six ladies who all spent time together on the trip.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania native and Conrad have been dating for nearly six years but they have known each other nearly their entire lives. He told a We tv panel in 2018 that they grew up just three blocks from each other as kids, and that Conrad's sister used to babysit him. </p>

<p>Hannah and Collin have been living with their father full-time since February 2018. The other four sextuplets: Alexis, Aaden, Joel and Leah, and twins Mady and Cara, 19, live with their mother, Kate Gosselin. </p>

<p>The former couple first welcomed their twins in 2001; the sextuplets followed in 2004. </p>

<p>Most recently Kate Gosselin starred in the reality dating series, Kate Plus Date, in 2019.</p>

<p>Glowing: Conrad was all smiles when she wrapped her arms around Gosselin's son Collin</p>

<p>Helping those in need: Conrad works as a registered nurse</p>

<p>Following the birth of the sextuplets, the Gosselin's were featured in the NBC reality TV show Home Delivery. They were also featured in a special on Discovery Health in 2005 and another special the following year. </p>

<p>This all led to what would become the hit reality show, Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8, which began airing in 2007.</p>

<p>The Gosselins would eventually split in 2009 after a decade of marriage, amid rumors of infidelity, and the reality show was renamed, Kate Plus 8.      </p>

<p>As of May 2020, Gosselin works as an IT director at a private, non-profit healthcare facility. </p>
