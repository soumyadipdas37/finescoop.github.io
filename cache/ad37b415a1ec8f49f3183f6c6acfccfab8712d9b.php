<p>The incident occurred on March 27 last year after Wang had a fallout with her colleague, known by her surname Sun, over 'student management issues', the Jiaozuo court said in a statement.</p>

<p>The nursery teacher then adulterated the children's food with sodium nitrite, which is commonly used as a food preservative but can be toxic and possibly fatal from overexposure.</p>

<p>It was reported at the time that 23 children began vomiting and fainting after eating their breakfast. Police launched an investigation after Wang was accused of poisoning the students.  </p>

<p>The incident , which shocked China and triggered global headlines, killed one child and left 23 with minor injuries, according to the court. </p>

<p>The student died in January after spending 10 months in hospital. </p>

<p>Wang was also found poisoning her husband in 2017 by putting sodium nitrite in his cup. He suffered minor injuries after drinking the water.  </p>

<p>The court said Wang was 'despicable and vicious', and she deserved to be severely punished as the consequences of her crimes were extremely serious.</p>

<p>She was sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life. </p>
