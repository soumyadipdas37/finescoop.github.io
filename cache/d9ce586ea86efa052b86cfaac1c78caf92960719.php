<p>New rules to crack down on mass gatherings came into force on Friday - leading to £90,000-worth of fines issued by Sunday night.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Lewis Basford said organisers of such events should ask themselves if it was worth the risk of the new fines.</p>

<p>He said: 'My final message is to the organisers: we will seize the equipment - I don't care if you've hired it from someone or if it's yours, we will break up your event, and we can now fine you up to £10,000.' </p>
