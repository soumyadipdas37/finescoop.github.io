<p>LOUISE, 35 </p>

<p>I've had three long-term relationships of between three and five years. </p>

<p>The last one ended in September 2019 and I briefly dated someone before lockdown. </p>

<p>It's hard to meet people through friends as most of mine have settled down, so I've tried online dating, but that's a minefield.</p>

<p>Pre-Date Nerves?</p>

<p>Of course! I started getting butterflies days before the date. </p>

<p>My friends could tell I was nervous, so helped me choose the right outfit. I wore black shorts with a lacy top.</p>

<p>Single for 11 months, no children.</p>

<p>CURRENT ROLE</p>

<p>College grant project officer.</p>

<p>WOULD LIKE TO MEET</p>

<p>Someone taller than me. </p>

<p>I'm 5ft 10in and feel uncomfortable with shorter men. </p>

<p>I like kindness and a dry sense of humour, but physical attraction is also important.</p>

<p>First Impressions?</p>

<p>Simon was running late, but he did let me know beforehand which I appreciated. We had both taken a taxi to the restaurant in the centre of Leeds. </p>

<p>He chose The Ivy, but wanted to make sure I approved of his choice, which was thoughtful of him. He was polite.</p>

<p>Easy To Talk To?</p>

<p>We both like to keep active and go to the gym. Simon goes indoor climbing, which I'd like to try. </p>

<p>He is about to become an uncle and, as I have nieces and a nephew, we talked about that. </p>

<p>He'd moved back up north to be near family, which is important to us both.</p>

<p>Embarrassing Moments?</p>

<p>There were two awkward silences — but each time one of us jumped in to fill it. I was talking quite a bit more than Simon. </p>

<p>I'm not sure if that was because he is quieter than me, or I was not letting him get a word in.</p>

<p>Did Sparks Fly?</p>

<p>Simon is handsome, but most importantly he smiles a lot and it's an attractive smile. </p>

<p>A few times I looked at him and found myself thinking, 'you are a good looking lad'. He asked for my number and suggested a coffee.</p>

<p>Did You Kiss?</p>

<p>No — but if he had wanted to kiss me I don't think I would have minded! </p>

<p>As it was a Sunday, we went our separate ways after dinner, but if it had been a Friday or a Saturday we'd have probably gone on for a drink.</p>

<p>What do you think he thought of you?</p>

<p>Simon waited for me to get my taxi and he texted to make sure I got home. But I'm not sure our connection is strong enough. Dating is tough. </p>

<p>There are times I just want a guy to knock on my door and say, 'I'm your perfect man, let's live happily ever after.'</p>

<p>Would your family like him?</p>

<p>My mum would love Simon because he's so gentlemanly and polite.</p>

<p>SIMON, 33   </p>

<p>Dating Past</p>

<p>I spent my 20s moving around for work in hospitality, so it's been difficult to meet people. </p>

<p>I have been on some dates in the past couple of years and tried dating apps, but I prefer to meet people in person. </p>

<p>SIMON, 33</p>

<p>I dated a beautiful woman during lockdown, but she'd recently left a 14-year relationship, so the timing wasn't great for her.</p>

<p>Pre-Date nerves?</p>

<p>In a one-on-one situation I can get nervous. </p>

<p>I'm not particularly great with people I don't know. But I decided I'd approach the date with the right attitude and enjoy the evening.</p>

<p>First impressions?</p>

<p>I was a couple of minutes late because of a miscommunication with my taxi company. </p>

<p>I immediately apologised and Louise was understanding. She stood up to greet me and we got off to a good start.</p>

<p>Easy to talk to?</p>

<p>I prefer it when women lead the conversation as it takes the pressure off me. Louise was easy to talk to. </p>

<p>Single for two years, no children.</p>

<p>CURRENT ROLE</p>

<p>Hotel duty manager.</p>

<p>WOULD LIKE TO MEET</p>

<p>Someone who has a good body, is attractive and affectionate. </p>

<p>Ideally she is keen on fitness or yoga and is close to her family. </p>

<p>I find arrogant party animal types a total turn off.</p>

<p>We are at the same stage of our lives where our careers are taking off. </p>

<p>We're both keen to get on the property ladder and are saving to buy our first home. It was good that we could talk about how we keep fit and active, too.</p>

<p>Embarrassing moments?</p>

<p>Thankfully not.</p>

<p>Did sparks fly?</p>

<p>We got along brilliantly, but the spark wasn't there for me. </p>

<p>I'm quite fussy. I like a woman to make me feel excited and a bit nervous and that feeling wasn't there. </p>

<p>I don't know how Louise felt about me because I'm not very good at reading those kinds of signals. </p>

<p>I'd like to meet her again, but I'm not sure if anything romantic will happen.</p>

<p>Did you kiss?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>What do you think she thought of you?</p>

<p>I'd like to think that she saw me as down to earth, confident, but also approachable.</p>

<p>Would your family like her?</p>

<p>Absolutely. Louise is a chatty and extremely likeable person.</p>

<p>8/10  </p>

<p>LIKED?</p>

<p>How comfortable Simon made me feel. </p>

<p>REGRETS?</p>

<p>None. </p>

<p>COFFEE OR CAB?</p>

<p>Coffee.</p>

<p>8/10</p>

<p>LIKED? </p>

<p>Louise is a really nice woman </p>

<p>REGRETS?</p>

<p>None.</p>

<p>COFFEE OR CAB?</p>

<p> Coffee.</p>
