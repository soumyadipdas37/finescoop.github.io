<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Charlie Teo's 'miracle girl' has had her disease 'removed' following another -successful operation from the acclaimed neurosurgeon - after her cancer returned for the third time. </p>

<p>Milli Lucas was hit with the devastating news in April that her cancer had come back after Dr Teo wiped out 98 per cent of the growth on her brain stem following a life-saving procedure in Sydney in June 2019. </p>

<p>Milli and her father Grant Lucas travelled from Perth to Sydney so Dr Teo could perform an eight-hour operation on April 8 - after after doctors in Western Australia again refused to carry out the procedure amid fears of paralysis or even death.</p>

<p>The family posted another update to Milli's blog 'Team Millstar' on Friday, revealing she was back in Sydney with the renowned neurosurgeon.</p>

<p>Milli Lucas (pictured) underwent another surgery with Dr Charlie Teo in Sydney</p>

<p>'Milli is currently in Sydney with her man Charlie again,' the update read.</p>

<p>'She had surgery on Monday and the disease was removed.'</p>

<p>Milli went back into surgery on Tuesday to 'release pressure'.</p>

<p>The 13-year-old remains in ICU and has another operation on Monday.</p>

<p>'We ask that you keep her in your thoughts and further updates will be provided when possible,' the blog post said.</p>

<p>'In true Milli words: ''See you soon mate''.' </p>

<p>Milli's story made headlines last year after generous family, friends and strangers raised more than $170,000 to help pay for the life-saving operation. </p>

<p>Many doctors declined to perform the operation on Milli - who was told she had just 12 weeks to live - as the tumour was in a high risk 'no go zone' of the brain.</p>

<p>However, Dr Teo offered to do the procedure, in which he was able to successfully remove 98 per cent of her tumour before she travelled to Germany to get rid of the remaining two per cent.</p>

<p>Milli incredibly returned to school just weeks after her surgery. </p>

<p>The schoolgirl's rare condition puts her at risk of developing various types of cancer, which has also affected her older sister Tess, her mother and cousin Beau. </p>

<p>Her older sister Tess was also diagnosed with brain tumour but she has since been given the all-clear, while their mum - who has a family history of cancer - underwent a double mastectomy after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016.</p>

<p>January 2016: Milli, who has extremely rare Li-Fraumeni syndrome, is diagnosed with an aggressive and malignant brain tumour.</p>

<p>January 2016 - April 2019: The 12-year-old undergoes years of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy treatments to try and shrink the tumour.</p>

<p>April 2019: Doctors in Perth tell the Lucas Smirk family that her treatments are only getting larger and they can't perform surgery on the brain stem because it is too risky. They put her into palliative care.</p>

<p>May 2019: The family were told she has just 'weeks left to live', Milli's family start a GoFundMe page to raise $170,000 and visit renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo in Sydney.</p>

<p>June 2019: Dr Teo removes 98 per cent of the tumour and Milli is awake 24 hours later.</p>

<p>July 2019: Milli spends four weeks in Germany attempting to remove the remaining two per cent of tissue.</p>

<p>August 2019: Milli and her sister Tess return to school as they await news about the tumour.</p>

<p>March 2020: Scans find a cancerous tumour has returned to Milli's brain. She gets a puppy named Sprite to help her through the next part of her cancer journey.</p>

<p>April 2020: Milli was told she may not talk, walk and see again but she defied the odds after a gruelling eight-hour brain tumour surgery by Dr Teo.</p>
