<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mortgage borrowers have been dealt another blow after two major banks heavily restricted how much they will lend to homebuyers. </p>

<p>The High Street giants have introduced new caps on loan sizes. Barclays has limited loans to just 4.49 times someone's income – down from five-and-a-half times previously. </p>

<p>Borrowers were given no warning of the new rule, which also applies to those who have submitted applications. </p>

<p>Restrictions: Homebuyers have already been facing a host of stringent new rules</p>

<p>Many borrowers have already been waiting weeks as banks struggle with backlogs from when the market was frozen and soaring demand following a recent stamp duty cut. </p>

<p>NatWest also quietly reduced the amount some customers can borrow. The bank has issued a new mortgage calculator for brokers that restricts lending to self-employed borrowers to 4.25 time earnings – down from 4.9 times. </p>

<p>Mortgage advisers fear more lenders will follow suit. Homebuyers have already been facing a host of stringent new rules. Some banks will not lend to customers with small deposits or have barred borrowers using contributions from the Bank of Mum and Dad. </p>

<p>Others refuse to consider bonuses, overtime and furlough money in assessing how much can be borrowed. </p>

<p>Rachel Dixon, mortgage broker, RH Dixon, said: 'I'm disappointed at the banks' sudden change of rules. These decisions clearly show lenders are concerned about the future of the economy, the end of furlough, the direction of house prices. I expect more lenders to follow in coming weeks.' </p>

<p>Barclays' previous highest income multiplier was reserved only for top earners or first-time buyers using its popular Family Springboard deal. </p>

<p>Borrowers with joint earnings of £100,000, borrowing 5.5 times their salaries, would be offered a loan of £550,000 if they had a deposit of at least 15 per cent. </p>

<p>The new rules mean the amount they can borrow will be more than £100,000 lower. </p>

<p>A NatWest spokesperson said: 'We continually review our proposition to ensure it is in line with market conditions.' A Barclays spokesperson said: 'We regularly review our lending policies and today have made some changes to loan-to-income multiples.'</p>
