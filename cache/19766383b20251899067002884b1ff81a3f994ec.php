<p>The centenary of the publication of Dame Agatha Christie's first novel is being marked with the issue of a special £2 coin</p>

<p>Its designer David Lawrence said: 'The jigsaw turned out to be the best metaphor for an Agatha Christie mystery: It is not until the final missing piece is dropped into place that the whole picture can be seen.'</p>

<p>The novel ushered in a golden age of mystery novels in the 1920s and 1930s and Dame Agatha's tales have been published in more than 50 languages and distributed in some 100 countries.</p>

<p>The popularity of Dame Agatha's work endures, with a new star-studded film version of another Poirot tale, Death On The Nile, featuring Sir Kenneth Branagh, set for release soon.</p>

<p>The coin, which the Mint said will not be released into general circulation, features jigsaw pieces and a replication of Dame Agatha's signature.</p>
