<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A college student has revealed her professor sent her a sexually-charged email suggesting he 'take her top and hijab off' after she messaged him about a homework assignment. </p>

<p>In a recent video, TikTok user <?php echo e('@'); ?>cloudoda shared a screenshot of her teacher's outrageous reply to her email, which was titled: 'Regarding homework due on the 18/09.' </p>

<p>The professor simply wrote back: '<em>Starts to take your top and hijab off</em>' — without any explanation or context. </p>

<p>Say what? ikTok user <?php echo e('@'); ?>cloudoda shared a screenshot of her teacher's outrageous reply to her email, which was titled: 'Regarding homework due on the 18/09'</p>

<p>Inappropriate: The professor wrote back: '<em>Starts to take your top and hijab off</em>' — without context. She also shared his follow-up in which he asked her to 'delete' his previous message</p>

<p>In the video, <?php echo e('@'); ?>cloudoda is standing in front of the email with a confused expression on her face, and an audio clip of women chanting in Spanish is playing in the background.  </p>

<p>She also shared a screenshot of his equally bizarre follow-up email suggesting the inappropriate message wasn't actually meant for her. </p>

<p>The professor offered her an apology, but he also asked her to delete the incriminating email.  </p>

<p>Huh? The professor suggested that the original email wasn't meant for her, saying it was an 'honest mistake' </p>

<p>HELP ##foryou ##fyp</p>

<p>'Please ignore and delete that last email I sent you, it was an honest mistake and I'm truly beyond sorry,' he wrote. 'I will get back to you with your questions about the homework as soon as possible.' </p>

<p>'HELP,' she captioned the TikTok, which has been viewed more than 1.8 million times. </p>

<p>A number of TikTok users were admittedly confused as to why he was writing the message in the first place if he didn't mean to send it to her. </p>

<p>'Wait...was he writing fanfiction about u?' one person asked, while another added: 'WHAT IN THE WATTPAD.'   </p>

<p>Thoughts: The TikTok video has been viewed more than 1.8 million times, and commenters insisted she should press charges, blackmail him, or both</p>

<p>'Why would he event send this by accident,' another wrote. 'I don't understand.' </p>

<p>A majority of commenters insisted that she press charges, blackmail him, or both. </p>

<p>'GET THAT A+ AND THEN PRESS CHARGES,' one TikTok user wrote. </p>

<p>'You realize you can now have ANYTHING you want... Grades, money, cheese on toast. The world is yours and I'm cackling,' someone else joked. </p>

<p>'GIRRRRLLLLL GET THE A AND SUE,' another shared. </p>
