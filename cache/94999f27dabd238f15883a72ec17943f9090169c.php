<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Olivier Giroud insists new Chelsea signing Timo Werner does not have the same 'profile' as him, and the Frenchman remains confident he can feature in the first XI this season. </p>

<p>Werner joined Blues in June by completing a £53million move from RB Leipzig, signing a five-year deal with the west London club after a season in which he scored 34 goals in 45 games.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old has continued his fine form at the beginning of the 2020-21 campaign, scoring four minutes into his first Chelsea friendly against Brighton and netting for Germany in their 1-1 Nations League draw with Spain. </p>

<p>Olivier Giroud says he offers something different to new Chelsea signing Timo Werner (above)</p>

<p>Werner has joined Giroud and Tammy Abraham as one of manager Frank Lampard's centre-forward options, but the former Arsenal man believes the new signing will boost morale around the Cobham training ground. </p>

<p>Giroud told Telefoot: 'I haven't spoken to Lampard.</p>

<p>'One thing is certain: the competition will pull us all to the top. A great club should have different options in each position.</p>

<p>Giroud fought his way back into first team contention and scored 10 goals last season</p>

<p>'We want to be in the race for the title and I'm here. I finished the season well and I proved to the manager that he can count on me.</p>

<p>'Werner is not the same profile as me, I hope to have some playing time.'</p>

<p>Giroud featured infrequently during Lampard's debut season as Chelsea boss, but seized his opportunity after an injury crisis led to his return to the starting XI.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old forward scored  eight league goals in 13 games after his reintroduction in February, and it seems he is now prepared to fight for his place.</p>
