<p>'This dad bod thing is no good, you couldn't talk about a woman's body that way. </p>

<p>Doc Martin first debuted on screens in 2004 with Martin playing the cantankerous GP, and the show has won a legion of fans with its heartwarming nature and idyllic Cornwall setting. </p>

<p>In a statement, star Martin and producer Philippa Braithwaite explained that they've decided to end Doc Martin now to allow fans a chance to celebrate the show and its titular character with a final series.  </p>

<p>They said: 'We have loved making nine series of Doc Martin. When we launched the series in 2004 we could never have imagined how much our loyal viewers would take to the grumpy Doc like they have. </p>

<p>'The series has avid fans both in the UK and throughout the world and we are thrilled that Doc Martin has topped the ratings every time.</p>

<p>'However, after sixteen years we now feel that the time has come to say goodbye to Portwenn. We will be making the tenth and final series in 2021 and we are very much looking forward to returning to Cornwall to film it.' </p>

<p>Farewell: It comes after ITV announced on Monday, the much-loved drama will come to an end in 2021 after 17 years on-screen (pictured in 2017)</p>
