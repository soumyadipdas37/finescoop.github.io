<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The beloved 1990s teen sitcom Sister, Sister debuted on Netflix on Tuesday, but longtime fans may have noticed some subtle changes.</p>

<p>The song Slow Jam by Usher and Monica, which was featured prominently in the Cinderella-themed episode entitled Shoeless in 1998, has been removed from the show, according to a PopSugar report.</p>

<p>That report also reveals the change was made long before its streaming debut on Netflix, while one of the main stars, Tamera Mowry-Housley celebrated the show's debut on Netflix with a throwback Instagram post. </p>

<p>Changes: The beloved 1990s teen sitcom Sister, Sister debuted on Netflix on Tuesday, but longtime fans may have noticed some subtle changes</p>

<p>The song Slow Jam appears during a scene in Shoeless when Tamera (Tamera Mowry) slow dances with Jordan (Deon Richmond).</p>

<p>If you watch that scene on Netflix, or even on the complete series DVD set, that song has been replaced by the song Runnin by Bellringer, which wasn't released until 2009, long after the show went off the air.</p>

<p>The song was changed when the series was put into syndication, likely due to the license rights for the song either expiring, or becoming too expensive to use in perpetuity. </p>

<p>Fans also noticed a similar issue when songs featured on the UPN series Moesha were replaced when it arrived on Netflix exactly one month earlier.</p>

<p>The show was quickly picked up by the nascent network The WB, where it aired for four more seasons before going off the air in 1999 after six seasons and 119 episodes. </p>
