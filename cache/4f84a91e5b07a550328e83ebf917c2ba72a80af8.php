<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britney Spears posted a cheerful new Instagram album this Wednesday that showed her doing yoga on the beach.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old modeled a red bikini as she lay on her back on the sand, spreading her arms wide and stretching her legs straight up into the air.</p>

<p>'No ..... this isn’t "Just a Touch of Rose" or "RED" ... it is simply ME ... in the most general Britney way !!!' she gushed in the caption.</p>

<p>Looking up: Britney Spears posted a cheerful new Instagram album this Wednesday that showed her doing yoga on the beach</p>

<p>She has previously used the phrase 'Just a Touch of Rose' to refer to her upcoming 'personal photo project,' which she has since publicly called 'Project Rose.'</p>

<p>In the caption of her latest beach yoga album she wrote: 'Hey … while you’re at it ..... turn the photos upside down and you will find it’s a T !!!!!! For teacher ... tea ... test ... tomorrow ... time ... two ... ten ... tool ... try .... thanks .... they … I mean we could go all day with this one, right !?!?'</p>

<p>Britney concluded her caption by asking: 'Anyhow … who was your favorite teacher in school ..... and what did you LEARN ????'</p>

<p>Meanwhile this Tuesday she recommended the book The Inner Goddess Makeover by Tanishka and shared her hopes that it 'will also strengthen my "Just a Touch of Rose" and "RED" projects as well.'</p>

<p>Questions: Britney concluded her caption by asking: 'Anyhow … who was your favorite teacher in school ..... and what did you LEARN ????'</p>

<p>Her latest album as well as her apparently unrelated 'Project Rose' album comes amid her legal battle over her father Jamie Spears' conservatorship of her.</p>

<p>The pop star's legal circumstances have led to the rise of a 'Free Britney' movement claiming she is kept under strict control by handlers.</p>

<p>Earlier this month Britney took to Instagram to defend herself after fans noted that she repeatedly wore the same kind of peasant-style blouse.</p>

<p>'A lot of people have been saying that a lot of my posts are not new but they're old. But just to let you guys know, none of my pictures or posts are more than a month old,' the mother of two wrote on her page.</p>

<p>My prerogative: Britney recently defended herself for wearing 'the same top 17 times' revealing that 'it's for a project - Project Rose'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know. I did wear the same top 17 times, but it's for a project - Project Rose. And you will be seeing way more of Project Rose in the future,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Amid the Free Britney furor a source last week claimed that Jamie is clashing over the issue with the pop star's mother Lynne.</p>

<p>'Lynne wants a care plan established that would transition Britney's personal life out of the conservatorship,' said an Us Weekly source.</p>

<p>'Jamie has told her that Britney needs long-term monitoring, and he doesn't think she is prepared to take such a drastic action.'</p>

<p>By the way: Since March 25, the Mississippi-born blonde has shared 17 depictions of the fragrant flower as well as countless rose emojis embedded in her captions</p>

<p>Lynne and Jamie, who were married from 1975 until 2002, share three children - daughters Britney and Jamie Lynn, 29, and son Bryan, 43.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Britney would rather unseal details of the case than have them 'hidden away in a closet as a family secret,' her lawyer said in court documents.</p>

<p>The lawyer has also called Free Britney 'Far from being a conspiracy theory' after Jamie spoke to Page Six and dismissed the 'conspiracy theorists' propagating the movement who 'don't know anything.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile: She recommended The Inner Goddess Makeover by Tanishka this week and shared her hopes that it 'will also strengthen my "Just a Touch of Rose" and "RED" projects as well'</p>
