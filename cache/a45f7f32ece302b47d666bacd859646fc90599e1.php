<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> THREE brothers with a passion for magnet fishing have hauled out deadly catches – a gun each.</p>

<p>Reece Nixon, 14, was the first to come across a weapon when he found a World War One machine gun at the bottom of a canal.</p>

<p>That find a year ago was followed by a handgun fished out by younger brother Riley, five.</p>

<p>Then last Sunday four-year-old Leo found a BB gun on one of his first fishing expeditions.</p>

<p>Gun fishing: Leo Nixon, four, with BB weapon</p>

<p>Riley, five, with handgun and Reece Nixon, 14, with a World War One machine gun</p>

<p>The wartime weapon, a Vickers. is now in a museum, while investigations have found the German handgun was used in an armed robbery. </p>

<p>The brothers, from Leeds, regularly go magnet fishing – in which a magnet attached to a rope is dangled into water to locate metallic objects – in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. </p>

<p>The boys’ father William, 49, took the first two guns to the police.</p>
