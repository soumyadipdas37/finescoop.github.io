<p>The mother-of-one wrote on Instagram at the time: 'Today is RUOK day. I have to be honest. Today I am...The two months prior were brutal. Suffering extreme postnatal depletion.' </p>

<p>She continued the caption, writing that postpartum 'played out in low immunity, constant flu symptoms [and] exhaustion,' adding that she did not take any days off from motherhood or working.</p>

<p>'I tried to keep it together. I tried to smile through it all. I had only time for my baby and work. Everything else fell away. Not talking to anyone about it.'</p>

<p>'I can't believe how happy I finally feel... Was it postnatal depression? I don't know. I do know as a woman and mother I put way to much pressure on myself,' she added.</p>

<p>She also previously admitted she was 'drowning' while trying to juggle motherhood, her media career and life in general.  </p>
