<p>Speaking on her Life Uncut podcast in August, Brittany said she was 'gobsmacked' by how much Timm, 27, changed after filming Bachelor in Paradise.</p>

<p>'We had probably a week where it was really nice and normal. And then it just took a downward turn rapidly - deteriorated rapidly,' she admitted.  </p>

<p>'And we had a bit of a falling out over Timm's behaviour, and I literally didn't hear from him again,' she added.</p>

<p>The single life: Speaking on her Life Uncut podcast earlier this month, Brittany said she was 'gobsmacked' by how much Timm, 27, changed after filming Bachelor in Paradise</p>

<p>'He just wanted to drink and have fun with his friends, and no part of him wanted a relationship at all.'</p>

<p>Bachelor in Paradise was filmed in Fiji from November to December last year, and aired on Channel 10 between July and August.</p>

<p>A few weeks after they left the show together, Timm 'ghosted' Brittany and reunited with his ex-girlfriend Briana De La Motte.</p>

<p>'We had probably a week where it was really nice and normal. And then it just took a downward turn rapidly - deteriorated rapidly,' Brittany said of her relationship with Timm (pictured) </p>
