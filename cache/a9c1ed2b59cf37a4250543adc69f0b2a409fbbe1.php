<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Melbourne's night-time curfew was extended despite there being no evidence the measure would slow the rate of COVID-19 infection on its own, according to the senior health official who renewed the draconian rule.</p>

<p>The city's five million residents were on August 2 banned from leaving their homes between the hours of 8pm to 5am except for work, medical or care-giving reasons.</p>

<p>Health officials extended the curfew on September 14 but with shortened hours from 9pm to 5am.</p>

<p>The curfew - which was only removed on Monday evening amid a rapid decline in daily case totals - was one of a range of sweeping coronavirus restrictions brought in as part of Victoria's state of emergency powers.</p>

<p>Department of Health and Human Services senior medical adviser Michelle Giles admitted at a Supreme Court hearing on Thursday there was no physical evidence the policy alone reduced transmission.</p>

<p>Bourke Street is pictured deserted after a citywide curfew was introduced in Melbourne on August 2. The bureaucrat who signed off on the measure has admitted there was no evidence it would slow the rate of COVID-19 infection on its own</p>

<p>'What I say is the curfew is part of a package of directions that aim at reducing movement and interactions between people and there is evidence that reduces transmissions,' she said.</p>

<p>But Associate Professor Giles - who had final say on the extension while standing in as Victoria's Deputy Public Health Commander - told the court there was no proof the policy by itself would be effective.</p>

<p>Professor Giles also said she disagreed with the premier's assertion when the curfew was announced it would help Victoria Police enforce the lockdown.</p>

<p>'I actually considered the curfew in relation to public health,' she said, according to The Australian.</p>

<p>'I don't agree with those comments, particularly the law enforcement one.' </p>

<p>The Supreme Court case has been brought by Mornington Peninsula cafe owner Michelle Loielo - who is suing the government claiming COVID-19 restrictions have caused a 99 per cent drop in her revenue.</p>

<p>A heavy police presence is seen at the Queen Victoria Market on September 13, 2020 in Melbourne as anti-lockdown protesters organised a 'freedom walk'.</p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews said the curfew was introduced to help Victoria Police enforce lockdown restrictions - but the top bureaucrat disagreed, saying she made the decision to bring it in based on public health considerations</p>

<p>'Every time I see the premier, Daniel Andrews, on the television and every time I hear the premier speak, I feel a sense of dread and anxiety,' she said.  </p>

<p>Last month, Mr Andrews said he decided to bring in the unprecedented 8pm curfew even though it was not recommended by scientists.</p>

<p>'That's a decision that I've made,' he said on 10 September, adding governments are 'free to go beyond' advice given to them by doctors.</p>

<p>The curfew, which affected metropolitan Melbourne, originally required people to stay home between 8pm and 5am</p>

<p>The previous day Victoria's chief health officer Brett Sutton said he did not recommend the curfew.</p>

<p>Ms Loielo, a Liberal Party supporter, claims the curfew violates her rights to freedom.</p>

<p>She says her business in Capel Sound used to bring in up to $20,000 a week in earnings.</p>
