<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Today host Karl Stefanovic raised eyebrows on Thursday when his language was bleeped out twice during a hot topics segment.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old appeared to swear while discussing a viral news story about several parrots at a British wildlife park - but it was actually just a stitch-up by producers.</p>

<p>Explaining the story to his guests, including politician Jacqui Lambie, Karl said: 'The park's boss said, "Every time I walk past I get called a fat <em>beep</em>."' </p>

<p>Say what? Today host Karl Stefanovic (centre) raised eyebrows on Thursday when his language was bleeped out twice during a hot topics segment</p>

<p>Karl added with a laugh that when he was a child, his uncle also had a swearing bird. </p>

<p>'When I was a kid, my uncle Rob had a cockatoo and every time I would walk past it would call me a fat <em>beep</em>. What do you think, Jacqui?'</p>

<p>Karl didn't actually swear during the segment, which can be discerned by reading his lips, but his language was bleeped out anyway.</p>

<p>This was most likely an inside joke arranged by Today's producers. </p>

<p>Cheeky! The 46-year-old appeared to say 'fat t**t' when talking about how five cheeky parrots were removed from the Lincolnshire Wildlife Park in the UK for swearing and saying the derogatory remark</p>

<p>It comes after Karl shut down Sam Dastyari earlier this week after he made a very awkward remark about cheating husbands on the Today show. </p>

<p>The 37-year-old, known as 'Shanghai Sam' for his involvement in a Chinese donations scandal which eventually led to his resignation in January 2018, made a rather awkward gaffe on Today on Tuesday. </p>

<p>During a lighthearted segment with host Karl and journalist Anna Caldwell, Sam put his foot in it while discussing an amusing story about a cheating husband.</p>

<p>Karl began: 'How's this for a wife's revenge - forcing her cheating husband to parade around their neighbourhood dressed in pink as a brutal get-back. Sam?'  </p>

<p>Sam replied: 'Well, look, firstly as someone who's gone through a divorce, I can safely say that's not something I was forced to do.</p>

<p>'And I don't think you were either, Karl.'</p>

<p>Perhaps realising what he had just suggested about himself and Karl on national TV, Sam laughed nervously and tried to find a way to wrap things up.  </p>

<p>'I mean, look, it's not going to work, it's not going to end well if that's how you're going to try and make your relationship work, good luck to you.... by the way, I thought wearing pink was okay?' he said.</p>

<p>Karl sternly clarified: 'I guess if you're a cheater, Sam.' </p>

<p>Revenge: Karl began: 'How's this for a wife's revenge - forcing her cheating husband to parade around their neighbourhood dressed in pink as a brutal get-back. Sam?'</p>

<p>Putting his foot in it: Sam replied: 'Well, look, firstly as someone who's gone through a divorce, I can safely say that's not something I was forced to do. 'And I don't think you were either, Karl'</p>

<p>'Well, look, I mean that's certainly not me but, er, but look I think...' Sam responded, before bursting into awkward laughter.</p>

<p>Karl, 46, brushed off Sam's gaffe, and later told him and Anna: 'I thought you guys would be much lighter on that one. You guys took it very seriously. Anyway, onwards and upwards!'</p>

<p>'Too many scars there, Karl. Too many scars!' Sam added, signing off. </p>

<p>Sam was only joking of course, and Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting that he or Karl has been unfaithful in the past.</p>

<p>Former Labor senator Sam clarified in January last year that his split from his wife of eight years, Helen ­Barron, was 'very amicable'.</p>

<p>Karl has also made it clear that he did not meet his now-wife, Jasmine Yarbrough, until five months after he'd split from his first wife, Cassandra Thorburn, in mid-2016.</p>
