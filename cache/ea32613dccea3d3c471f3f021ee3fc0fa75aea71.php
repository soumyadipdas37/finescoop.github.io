<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They were thrust into the limelight during lockdown, after stealing the hearts of an entire nation when they starred opposite each other in Normal People. </p>

<p>And now, Paul Mescal, 24, and Daisy Edgar-Jones, 22, have been named in The ELLE List 2020 in partnership with MAGNUM ice cream, which introduces this year's top 50 movers and shakers. </p>

<p>The two previously unknown actors opened up about their respective journeys, with Paul admitting he felt 'objectified' after the success of the BBC drama, while Daisy insisted that not going to drama school meant she had to 'learn on the job.'</p>

<p>Congratulations! Paul Mescal, 24, and Daisy Edgar-Jones, 22, have been named in The ELLE List 2020 in partnership with MAGNUM ice cream</p>

<p>Speaking about the impact his break out has had on his life, Paul - who sits at number two on the Elle List 2020 - admitted he felt 'objectified' and receives 'intense' DMs on social media.</p>

<p>He said: 'I felt objectified after Normal People. It's to be expected, given the intimacy of my scenes, but it doesn't make it easier.</p>

<p>'I daren't read some of the intense DMs I receive. But it's not enough to put me off the industry.'</p>

<p>His character Connell's chain became iconic following the success of the series, and Paul confessed that fans' obsession with it is 'a bit frightening.' </p>

<p>Winging it! Paul admitting he felt 'objectified' after the success of the BBC drama while Daisy insisted that not going to drama school meant she had to 'learn on the job'</p>

<p>He said: 'The power of Connell's chain was completely unexpected. And a bit frightening! (<?php echo e('@'); ?>connellschain has 187,OOO Instagram followers.) It became this totemic being that lived outside the show.'</p>

<p>The actor also revealed how he almost joined the army, but fell in love with performing aged 16 while in a school production. </p>

<p>He said: 'I almost joined the army at 16. But my love for Gaelic football and acting kept me in Ireland.</p>

<p>'In Year 11, I played the lead in The Phantom Of The Opera and fell for being onstage. I'd never have imagined that Andrew Lloyd Webber would one day ask me to do a singalong, as he did this summer.' </p>

<p>Paul's co-star Daisy - who sits at number seven on the Elle List 2020 - opened up about not going to drama school, which she said made her 'determined.'</p>

<p>But the actress - who played Marianne in Normal People - confessed that she has 'worried about missing out'.</p>

<p>Daisy explained: 'Not going to drama school taught me to think on my feet. I've had to learn on the job, which made me determined.</p>

<p>'I've worried about missing out, but I know there's no one right path for actors. The National Youth Theatre led me to my first open casting at 16.' </p>

<p>TV hit: Normal People was adapted from Sally Rooney's book and follows the romantic relationship between Connell and Marianne as they weave in and out of each other's lives</p>

<p>Looking to the future, the Normal People actress revealed that she has her eye set on starring in a Wes Anderson film, which are known for their eccentricity and distinctive style. </p>

<p>She said: 'I'd love to be in a Wes Anderson film. Marianne will always be my first love, but living in Wes Anderson's symmetrical, sepia-filtered world would be brilliant. The fashion alone would be magical.'       </p>

<p>The ELLE List recognises and celebrates this year's new leaders, and movers and shakers reframing the worlds of fashion, beauty, politics, culture and beyond. </p>

<p>The esteemed list is compiled by a panel of prestigious judges – ELLE Editor-in-Chief Farrah Storr, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, actor Gemma Chan, fashion educator and advocate Sinéad Burke, author Candice Carter-Williams and model/activist Munroe Bergdorf – who selected the final fifty names. </p>

<p>Each year the list marks ELLE's commitment to using its voice to shout about brave and brilliant new voices who are changing the world for the better.</p>

<p>It celebrates talent from around the world, including fashion designers, actors, artists, musicians, athletes, activists, photographers, beauty heroes and hell-raisers of every kind. </p>
