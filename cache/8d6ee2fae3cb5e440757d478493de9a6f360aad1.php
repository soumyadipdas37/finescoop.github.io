<p>Divorce depositions: Dr Dre's estranged wife Nicole Young, shown in March 2016 in Beverly Hills, California with the music mogul, has filed court documents seeking in-person depositions for their divorce case amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Court papers included allegations made by Young that Dre already had missed previously scheduled depositions.</p>

<p>Young claimed the reason for Dre missing them was simple, saying 'his entire career and public persona are based on defiance of authority, violence and refusal to comply with the law'.</p>

<p>She further alleged that Dre due to his estimated worth of $1 billion believes that rules don't apply to him and 'has grown accustom to doing whatever he likes, whenever he so chooses'.</p>

<p>Young in the court papers claimed that Dre's credibility was a crucial part of their dispute over the validity of the prenup and thus required an in-person deposition instead of a virtual meeting online.</p>
