<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A single mother who wants to break the record for the world's smallest waist has revealed that she wears a corset for 18 hours a day to shrink her already tiny 21.5-inch torso.</p>

<p>Sammy Wilson, 26, from Georgia, started waist training in April 2019 to help add some curves to her frame after losing weight. She can now squeeze into a 15-inch corset, and she's determined to whittle her 21.5-inch waist down to 14 inches. </p>

<p>'I want to have the smallest waist in the world,' she explained. 'If I get down to 14 inches my waist will be roughly the same size as an average newborn baby's head and one inch smaller than the current world record.' </p>

<p>Goal: Sammy Wilson, 26, from Georgia, wants to have the smallest waist in the world </p>

<p>Tiny: The single mother can fit into a 15-inch corset (pictured), which she wears 18 hours a day </p>

<p>Say what? Sammy's waist is 21.5 inches without her corset, but she wants to make it even smaller </p>

<p>The Guinness World Record for the smallest waist on a living person is currently held by Cathie Jung, who has a 15-inch waist. </p>

<p>Just two years ago, Sammy weighed 198 pounds and wore a size 16, but she was miserable with her physique and was desperate to transform her 35-inch waist.</p>

<p>The mom, who has a son, Gabriel, started losing weight in December 2018. She dropped down to a slim size 6 in just four months, but she was still unhappy with her boxy waist. </p>

<p>After seeing another woman's waist-training results online, the young mom bought her first-ever corset, which measured 22 inches.</p>

<p>Throwback: Just two years ago, Sammy weighed 198 pounds and wore a size 16</p>

<p>Dedicated: She was miserable with her physique and was desperate to transform her 35-inch waist. She started losing weight in December 2018 and got down to a size 6 in four months </p>

<p>Sammy started waist training in April 2019 because she was unhappy with her boxy frame after her weight loss. Now, Sammy weighs 116lbs, wears a size 00, and has a 21.5-inch waist</p>

<p>Plan: Sammy wants to get her waist down to 14 inches, so she can break the Guinness World Record for the smallest waist on a living person</p>

<p>'When I first started I just wanted to try and get to a 20-inch corset, but once I'd got there I just wanted to keep going,' she said. </p>

<p>Now, Sammy weighs 116lbs, wears a size 00, and has a 21.5-inch waist. In order to try to shrink her waist even further, she wears her 15-inch corset for 18 hours a day, and once a month she will leave it on for 36 hours straight.  </p>

<p>'Despite people's concerns I think it has helped my health massively,' she said. 'I used to be a terrible binge eater but I just can't binge eat when I'm wearing this. It helps my posture so I won't have a hump when I'm older and it's very good for my metabolism.</p>

<p>'My family have been very supportive and my friends tell me I'm unrecognizable,' she added. 'My mom even wants me to get her a corset. I'm definitely more confident now than I ever have been before.</p>

<p>Reasoning: 'When you're skinny and pretty, life is just so much easier,' she said </p>

<p>Before and after: Sammy's waist is pictured when she started waist training (left) and now (right)</p>

<p>Backlash: Sammy admitted that some people will call her a 'freak' and ask her why is doing this to herself, but she shrugs off the negativity </p>

<p>'Everyone wants to be remembered for something and I just want to have something that I can smile to myself about and know that nobody else has done it.' </p>

<p>While the lab worker claims she's never felt better in her tightly fitting garment, she admitted she often faces negativity from onlookers who see her on the street. </p>

<p>'If I'm out shopping, people will stare and they will sometimes even stop and ask me questions about how my waist is so small and ask if it hurts,' she said. </p>

<p>'Some people say I'm weird, call me a freak and ugly, or ask me why I would do this to myself. But I don't know how people can say it's dangerous, it's actually very comfortable.</p>

<p>'When you're skinny and pretty, life is just so much easier,' she added. 'More guys want to take me out and more people notice me. I just want to see how far I can take it.'</p>
