<p>Winger Willian joined his old pal Luiz at the Gunners after joining on a free transfer following his departure from the Blues.</p>

<p>The trio played together for a number of years at Chelsea and enjoyed success and now Oscar has disclosed that Luiz and Willian asked him to make the move to Arsenal this summer.</p>

<p>Oscar (L) has revealed that David Luiz (C) and Willian (R) wanted him to join them at Arsenal</p>

<p>'They called me, they had to call me. Because we have good communication. Sometimes I talk to them. They said 'come to Arsenal, come here',' he told Fox Sports Brasil.</p>

<p>'But for me it's a little more difficult. I have a contract with Shanghai, it's a little more difficult to leave.'</p>

<p>Oscar spent five years at Stamford Bridge before switching to China and currently plies his trade at Shanghai SIPG.</p>

<p>Willian followed his old pal Luiz through the door at Arsenal this summer after leaving Blues</p>

<p>However the two-time Premier League has not ruled out a return to Europe in the future and has insisted his first choice would be to go back to Chelsea.</p>

<p>'I really want to go back to Europe. [But] Not now. At the moment I'm well here in China, I still have my contract here, which I hope to fulfil,' he added.Â </p>

<p>'Of course the first club I'd choose if I could go back to Europe is Chelsea, for sure, which is the club that I built a very beautiful history with.</p>

<p>'And when I was a child I watched the Italian league a lot because there were many Brazilians there. So there are some teams from Italy that I like a lot, like Inter, Milan.</p>

<p>'So I'd think about going to the Italian league if I return one day.'</p>
