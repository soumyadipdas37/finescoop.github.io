<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Samantha Cameron has revealed she and the former UK Prime Minister had a rough patch in their marriage after they left Downing Street.</p>

<p>The 49-year-old, who lives with her husband David and their three children Nancy, 16, Arthur, 14, and Florence, 10, in their £1.5 million home near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, appeared on Giovanna Fletcher's Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast where she talked about her marriage.</p>

<p>She explained that the year after her husband David, 53, resigned in the summer of 2016 the couple were not 'getting on very well' and it was 'really weird'.</p>

<p>She revealed: 'There was a couple of years ago when [David] was travelling a lot about a year after he left Downing Street and I was working really hard on my business and it was one of the few times in our marriage when I just thought "I'm just not sure we are getting on very well, this is really weird".'</p>

<p>Samantha Cameron, 49, who lives in Chipping Norton with her husband David, 53,  and children Nandy, 16, Arthur, 14, and Florence, 10, said the couple had a period when they were not 'getting on very well' after he resigned as Prime Minister (pictured, the former Prime Minister announcing his decision in 2016) </p>

<p>In a rare interview she revealed the couple 'never' go out at night anymore because she feels she has to be at home 'all the time' to look after her teenage children.</p>

<p>Speaking on the Happy Mum Happy Baby Podcast, she said: 'I'm not very good at ever spending time away from the children with [David] on my own.'</p>

<p>She said the couple faced a challenging period in 2016 after David resigned as Prime Minister following the results of the Brexit referendum.</p>

<p>However, they ended up going away for three days to New York without children, which put them 'back on track again'. </p>

<p>During the rare interview, the 49-year-old said there was a rough period when the former Prime Minister was travelling a lot and she was working hard on her business</p>

<p>Samantha, who has been married to the former Prime Minister for 24 years, added: 'And actually we just went away for three days together away from the children.</p>

<p>'I think partly because I do work and I'm a bit of a control freak about all the logistics and everything else I'm not very really good at ever leaving them.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'And I think you can't when you're working - you have to choose between work and other stuff and your children.</p>

<p>'So you can't do everything you can't kind of work and have a social life and go off on holiday with your husband on your own and be a parent. I choose to work and be a parent, and not the other stuff.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile she added that the couple ended up travelling to New York for a mini break and said it was 'amazing how a few days away' could 'put us straight back on track again' </p>

<p>Speaking about their trip away to save their marriage, she said: 'So we're not very good at going away with each other but we did go to New York for three days.</p>

<p>'I have to say, we came back and it was amazing how a few days on your own somewhere else, you know going round art galleries and restaurants that had nothing to do with children put us straight back on track again.</p>

<p>'So now I look forward to that time when we can spend more time together travelling or going to restaurants.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile she added that the couple rarely have date nights now, saying: 'We never go out at night anymore because when you've got teenagers. We could go out when they were little. They went to bed at 7:30pm.</p>

<p>The wife of the former Prime Minster said the couple were able to 'get back on track' by going on a trip away without their children and said she now looks forward to date nights with David </p>

<p>'We definitely went out more when they were little - it wasn't very much but we did go out to restaurants and go out on our own and have date nights.</p>

<p>'But when you have teenagers you really feel like you've got to be there all the time. It's not to say we don't go out for dinner with friends but probably less than we ever have because our parenting starts in the evening.'</p>

<p>The Camerons moved back to their cosy Cotsworlds cottage from 11 Downing Street full time in July 2016 after David Cameron resigned as Prime Minister following a Leave victory EU referendum.</p>

<p>Cameron remained the MP for nearby Witney until September but the couple have stayed in the area in the four years since.</p>

<p>The Cotswolds is a popular location of seconds homes for member of high society with celeb haunt Soho Farmhouse nearby for relaxing days out. </p>
