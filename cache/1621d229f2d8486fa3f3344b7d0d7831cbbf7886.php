<p>The Kelly Clarkson Show host thinks she will eventually talk about her divorce in the future, but in a 'natural way' during conversation, rather than a 'planned' discussion.</p>

<p>She added: 'I think that I will navigate a way in which to be open and honest about it eventually, probably via the show, and it'll probably, I'm assuming, happen organically when someone says something in conversation or something.</p>

<p>'It definitely wouldn't be planned.' </p>

<p>But for now, the 38-year-old singer wants to respect the privacy of Brandon, 43, their kids, and his two teenage children - Savannah and Seth - from a previous marriage.</p>
