<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is preparing a possible antitrust lawsuit against Facebook after a year of investigating whether the social media giant is stifling competition through acquisitions, according to a source.  </p>

<p>The consumer trust watchdog is gearing up to file a suit against the social media giant before the end of 2020, an unidentified person familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. </p>

<p>The FTC, headed by Republican chairman Joseph Simons, has spent more than a year carrying out a probe into Facebook's practices and whether the company has broken antitrust laws and used its dominant position in the tech sector to stamp out competition.</p>

<p>News of a possible suit comes after founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was brought before the commission last month to testify under oath for two days as part of the investigation.</p>

<p>The source said a final decision has not been reached on whether the FTC will sue Facebook and acknowledged that preparations for suits do not always lead to cases being brought, reported the Journal. </p>

<p>For example, in 2013, the FTC backtracked on filing an antitrust complaint against Google despite having already made preparations to do so.  </p>

<p>The FTC, made up of three Republicans and two Democrats, will need a majority vote in order to bring a lawsuit against Facebook.   </p>

<p>In August, Facebook confirmed Zuckerberg had been interviewed at an FTC investigative hearing as part of the antitrust probe.</p>

<p>'We are committed to cooperating with the US Federal Trade Commission's inquiry and answering the questions the agency may have,' the social media company said in a statement. </p>

<p>Zuckerberg is said to have testified under oath for two days in testimony that could be used to build a case against the social media giant he founded back in 2004. </p>

<p>This came one month after he was hauled before Congress to testify about antitrust allegations as part of mounting scrutiny on the actions of several Silicon Valley tech giants. </p>

<p>The heads of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook all faced a congressional hearing in July where they were questioned for hours about antitrust allegations as well as political bias.</p>

<p>The FTC first told Facebook in June 2019 it was probing whether the company had engaged in unlawful monopolistic practices.</p>

<p>Much of the probe has centered around Facebook's prior acquisitions of potential rival firms such as social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and mobile applications - and whether the buying up of such firms has enabled the firm to monopolize the industry.</p>

<p>The company has maintained that its acquisitions are not anticompetitive and said the merging of rival services into its own has been done to improve user experience. </p>

<p>The FTC previously gave Facebook the green light for some of its most high-profile acquisitions including of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.  </p>

<p>Facebook is currently facing similar probes by the Justice Department and by state attorney generals.  </p>

<p>Last year, the social media firm agreed to pay a record $5 billion fine to settle a separate FTC probe around data privacy.   </p>
