<p>Mega mansion: Derek Jeter, 46, and his wife Hannah have reportedly listed their massive 30,000-square foot mansion near Tampa for an eye-popping $29 million, according to the New York Times on Tuesday</p>

<p>Turning a profit: Jeter purchased the land for $7.7 million but custom-built the estate to his specifications so it is unclear how much he's spent on the mansion (Derek and wife Hannah in 2019)</p>

<p>'This is the most impressive home to ever hit the market in the Tampa Bay area,' Stephen Gay, the Smith &amp; Associates Real Estate agent who has the listing told the New York Times.</p>

<p>The sprawling waterfront estate spreads out over 1.25 acres of land on Hillsborough Bay and is a combination of three adjacent lots that Jeter's company bought about 15 years ago.</p>

<p>With a price tag nearing $30 million, prospective buyers are in for a one-of-a-kind space which was custom built for the former New York Yankee.</p>

<p>The 30,875-square-foot space boasts seven bedrooms, 16 bathrooms (eight full baths and eight half-baths), gourmet kitchen, wine cellar, gym and movie theater.</p>

<p>Massive: Jeter's company first purchased three adjacent lots on Davis Islands, an exclusive Florida enclave, back in 2005 and 2006 for $7.7 million and completed construction on the home in 2011</p>

<p>Bespoke: With a price tag nearing $30 million, prospective buyers are in for a one-of-a-kind space which was custom built for the former New York Yankee</p>

<p>The home's massive 'club room' comes complete with a 'full-service bar, billiards and games table.</p>

<p>Outside, the estate is just as impressive stretching over 9,000 square feet with pristine waterfront views. </p>

<p>There is an outdoor kitchen, a handful of porches and balconies, a luxurious 80-foot salt water pool and two boat lifts into Hillsborough Bay. </p>

<p>Stunning: The 30,875-square-foot space boasts seven bedrooms, 16 bathrooms (eight full baths and eight half-baths), gourmet kitchen, wine cellar, gym and movie theater</p>

<p>Clean lines: The massive kitchen is all white with two huge center marble-topped islands and an enormous double range</p>

<p>What a view: The eat in kitchen has a breakfast nook - which is larger than most dining rooms - that over looks the bay</p>

<p>'You would think with a house that's this large, you'd just get lost in it,' the real estate agent told the NYT. 'But with the mixed scale of the rooms, it's not like everything is so formal and segregated. It's definitely not a casual house, but it's very livable.'</p>

<p>Additionally, the mansion has two three-car garages and an in-law suite for guests to stay separate from the main house. </p>

<p>If the property sounds like it is extraordinarily large and astronomically expensive, that is because it is - according to the Times, the estate is the largest-scale and priciest place ever build on Davis Islands.  </p>

<p>Location, location, location: The sprawling waterfront estate spreads out over 1.25 acres of land on Hillsborough Bay</p>

<p>Space! Outside, the estate is just as impressive stretching over 9,000 square feet with pristine waterfront views</p>

<p>Perfect for entertaining: There is an outdoor kitchen, a handful of porches and balconies, a luxurious 80-foot salt water pool and two boat lifts</p>

<p>Sitting on the dock of the bay: The estate is built on Davis Island - and exclusive enclave near downtown Tampa</p>

<p>Interest in the place by fans and rubber-neckers has only grown since it was first reported back in April that Jeter had rented his mansion to Tom Brady and Giselle Bundchen.</p>

<p>The Brady's, along with their two children, Benjamin and Vivian, decided to call St. Jetersburg home after Tom signed a $50 million deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>

<p>At the time, the Tampa Bay Times reported that the Brady family was planning on living at Jeter's mansion for the foreseeable future. </p>

<p>And, locals have dubbed it 'St. Jetersburg' and 'The Great Wall of Jeter', in reference to a massive privacy wall surrounding the estate. </p>

<p>Outdoor glam: A second covered kitchen is located outside the home and boasts a flat screen TV, bar, grill and lounge area</p>

<p>Perfect: A series of balconies and porches  spread throughout all levels of the home allow for residents to enjoy the waterfront views from anywhere</p>

<p>Little touches: Stone archways and water fountains add to the European estate quality of the space</p>

<p>Drive on up: Additionally, the mansion has two three-car garages and an in-law suite for guests to stay separate from the main house</p>

<p>Infamous: locals have dubbed it 'St. Jetersburg' and 'The Great Wall of Jeter', in reference to a massive privacy wall surrounding the estate</p>

<p>While an exact number was never revealed, estimates have put the monthly rent for the space in the ballpark of $100K a month. </p>

<p>During quarantine, Brady was spotted training for football season in the estate's sprawling backyard. </p>

<p>On Sunday, Tom made his first official appearance as a Buc as Tampa faced off against the New Orleans Saints in a 34-23 loss. </p>

<p>Despite listing the home while the celebrity family is still in residence, Derek and Tom worked out a deal so that prospective buyers won't bother or even see them. </p>

<p>Extras: The home's massive 'club room' comes complete with a 'full-service bar, billiards and games table</p>

<p>Details: Tom and Gisele have been renting the property since April and despite Jeter listing the home while the celebrity family is still in residence, Derek and Tom worked out a deal so that prospective buyers won't bother or even see them</p>

<p>'Tom and Derek negotiated favorable terms in the lease agreement so the Jeters could list, market, show and sell the property for sale,' the realtor revealed.</p>

<p>Out of the area: The Jeters, meanwhile moved to Miami back in 2017 where he now serves as a part owner and CEO of the Miami Marlins</p>

<p>Florida man: Prior to that, Jeter spent 20 years - his entire MLB career - playing for the New York Yankees. The Yankees' spring training facility is in Tampa</p>
