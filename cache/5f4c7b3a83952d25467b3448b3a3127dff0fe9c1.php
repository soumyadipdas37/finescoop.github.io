<p>The latest: Jennifer Lopez, 51, and Alex Rodriguez, 45, have pledged that she would be in control of the NY Mets franchise - making her baseball's first female Latina owner - and that they would pay $100 million to charity if the team didn't win the World Series in 10 years or less, if their bid for the team was a winner. They were snapped Tuesday in NYC </p>

'I was impressed by how passionate and mission-oriented both Alex and Jennifer are and the high level of integrity and core values that they displayed throughout this entire process.' </p>
