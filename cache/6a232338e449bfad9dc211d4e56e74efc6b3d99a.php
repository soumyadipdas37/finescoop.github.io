<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A second day of anti-lockdown protests in Victoria has seen hundreds of demonstrators swarm Queen Victoria Market.</p>

<p>At least 100 police officers, including those from Public Order Response unit, have the group surrounded and several people have already been arrested.</p>

<p>The 'Freedom Walk' comes one day after 14 people were arrested on Saturday for breaking COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>On Sunday, hundreds of people took to the streets again, chanting 'freedom' and demanding draconian lockdown restrictions be eased.  </p>

<p>Melbourne remains in a Stage Four lockdown, meaning residents cannot leave their houses without a valid reason, and restrictions are in place to limit movement more than 5km from a person's home.</p>

<p>On Sunday, hundreds of people took to the streets again, chanting 'freedom' and demanding draconian lockdown restrictions be eased</p>

<p>The restrictions remain in place, and both a State of Emergency and State of Disaster, have both been extended a further four weeks despite the embattled state only recording 41 new cases and seven deaths on Sunday.   </p>

<p>The latest figures released on Sunday morning take the state's death toll to 723 and the national count to 810 since the start of the pandemic in late January.</p>

<p>The second protest for the weekend comes hours after a woman shared footage of police dragging her from a car.</p>

<p>The masked driver refused to get out of her car after talking with an officer about a phone charger at Wallan, about 60km north of the city.</p>

<p>More to come. </p>
