<p>Gemma, 28, revealed her trim figure in a glitzy pink frock and styled her blonde tresses in voluminous waves.</p>

<p>Her makeup was high-octane, consisting of defined brows, false lashes, contoured cheekbones and a glossy lip.</p>

<p>The real estate professional kicked one lithe leg in the air, and threw her head back in laughter, as she lounged around in the ball pit with her gal pals. </p>

<p>Locky, who? Dressed in flirty numbers, the trio appeared to have had The Bachelor the furthest from their mind </p>

<p>Winner: Gemma, Charley and Steph failed to make it to Thursday's finale episode, where Irena Srbinovska was chosen as Locky's leading lady </p>

<p>Charley, 25, drew attention to her toned tummy in a white crop top and matching mini-skirt, and like Charley, opted for glamorous hair and makeup.</p>

<p>While Steph, 26, slipped her slender figure into a slinky white frock, and kept her beauty look fresh and natural. </p>

<p>The trio seemed unperturbed by having not captured Locky's heart, with Irena Srbinovska chosen as his leading lady on Thursday's finale episode.</p>

<p>Think pink: Gemma, 28, revealed her trim figure in a glitzy pink frock and styled her blonde tresses in voluminous waves</p>

<p>It wasn't just a Bachelor affair, with former Married At First Sight stars Jessika Power and Ines Basic lending their star power to the Bedroom Nightclub's relaunch party. </p>

<p>Jessika, 27, accentuated her cleavage and trim figure in a pale blue frock and perspex heels.</p>

<p>The full-time influencer styled her cropped blonde locks sleek and straight, and her eyes were enhanced with defined brows, false lashes and kohl liner. </p>

<p>Showing off a more urban dress sense, Ines, 30, donned a white crop top and relaxed-fit jeans, teamed with black pointy-toe heels and a red shoulder bag. </p>
