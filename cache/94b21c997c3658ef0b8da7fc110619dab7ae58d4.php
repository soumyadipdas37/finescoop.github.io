<p>While Deborra-lee opted for her usual all-black ensemble, she added to her look with white sneakers and a quirky Panda-print mask. </p>

<p>During their light stroll, the couple were joined by their two adorable dogs, Allegra and Dali.  </p>

<p>Hugh, a responsible pet owner, carried a green plastic bag to clean up after his canines on the walk.   </p>

<p>Safety first! The couple wore face masks during their walk around Soho - a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan. It also is the area in which two of Hugh's Laughing Man cafes are nearby</p>

<p>In July, The Greatest Showman actor revealed he was homesick for Australia, after a lengthy lockdown in New York City due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Deborra-lee and the couple's children, Oscar and Ava, had initially been in Melbourne when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March.</p>

<p>But they returned to the U.S. just four days later in order to keep the family together.</p>

<p>He's just like us! Hugh, a responsible pet owner, carried a green plastic bag to clean up after his canines on the walk</p>

<p>Later this month, Hugh is due to virtually attend the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.</p>

<p>He is one of five nominees up for an Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Limited TV series or Movie for his role as Frank Tassone in Bad Education.  </p>

<p>'I'm humbled by the nominations for both me and the film and excited to be named with such a talented group of actors,' Hugh said in a statement at the time. </p>

<p>Due to the global health crisis, the Emmy Awards will be a bit different this year.</p>

<p>Jimmy Kimmel will host the show from a stage inside California's Staples Center, which will have no red carpet or audience, Variety reported last month.   </p>

<p>'I'm humbled by the nominations': Hugh was recently nominated for an Emmy Award for Lead Actor in a Limited TV series or Movie for his role as Frank Tassone in Bad Education</p>
