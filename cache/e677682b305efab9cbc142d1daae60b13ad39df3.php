<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>SARA, 45</p>

<p>Dating Past?</p>

<p>I've never been married. The longest relationship I've had lasted for six years.</p>

<p>I travel for work, and pre-Covid I was away at least once a month — I returned from Canada in March, just before lockdown.</p>

<p>I'm actively dating and dabble on dating apps, but the competition where I live in Brighton is tough.</p>

<p>Single for three years, no children.</p>

<p>CURRENT ROLE</p>

<p>Travel and fashion writer.</p>

<p>WOULD LIKE TO MEET</p>

<p>The One: a silver fox with a zest for life, who can handle me being away a lot for my job.</p>

<p>Pre-Date Nerves?</p>

<p>My friends are all a bit jealous of my blind date — where we live most chaps are either gay or settled. Fortunately, I don't get nervous.</p>

<p>First Impressions?</p>

<p>Simon was already seated at our table when I arrived. He looked very dapper, wearing dark jeans with a dark shirt and a suit jacket.</p>

<p>However, he's probably not my type. I generally like men with hair, but Simon was charming and had a cheeky grin.</p>

<p>Easy To Talk To?</p>

<p>We had a glass of prosecco when I arrived and didn't order food for 45 minutes because we were so busy talking.</p>

<p>We both like the same galleries and have similar Central London haunts, such as the Groucho Club and Soho House.</p>

<p>I discovered Simon wants to visit Tbilisi in Georgia and, as I've been there for work, I was able to tell him more about the country.</p>

<p>ANY Embarrassing Moments?</p>

<p>It was quite loud in the restaurant, so we kept talking over each other and not quite catching what the other said.</p>

<p>Did Sparks Fly?</p>

<p>There was a bit of flirting going on between us, and we discussed what we would do on a fantasy date. We got on like a house on fire, but I suspect we both knew it was only friendly banter. We exchanged numbers and have been in touch since.</p>

<p>What do you think he thought of you?</p>

<p>He said we were probably soulmates in a former life. </p>

<p>We had a really good time, and went for a walk around Kensington Gardens and had another drink in a pub opposite before going home. I imagine he wasn't expecting someone quite so sparky.</p>

<p>Would your friends like him?</p>

<p>Yes, there's nothing not to like about Simon. He's interesting, with an impish side to him, and is very good at banter.</p>

<p>SIMON, 54 </p>

<p>Dating Past?</p>

<p>I was married for ten years, but we are now happily divorced and share our fabulous daughter. </p>

<p>We separated in 2004 and I've had a couple of medium-term relationships since.</p>

<p>I was with one partner for four years, while another relationship lasted a year. I've had a couple of flings, too. </p>

<p>On the subject of relationships, my dad asks: 'Are you still interviewing then, Simon?'</p>

<p>I'm a true Piscean and fall in love with anyone who smiles at me.</p>

<p>Pre-Date nerves?</p>

<p>I don't get nervous, although I did arrive five minutes late, and Sara rocked up ten minutes later.</p>

<p>First impressions?</p>

<p>Single for eight months, with one daughter, aged 20.</p>

<p>CURRENT ROLE</p>

<p>Animal behaviourist.</p>

<p>WOULD LIKE TO MEET</p>

<p>Someone to grow old disgracefully with. </p>

<p>If she looks like Sandra Bullock, that's a bonus.</p>

<p>I was seated at a table with a direct view of the restaurant entrance, and when she arrived I knew it was her because she looked like Sandra Bullock's second cousin.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw her I could tell we were going to have fun. Sara exceeded my expectations. We hit the ground running and the chatting didn't stop.</p>

<p>Easy to talk to?</p>

<p>We have a lot in common and discovered we've probably been in the same room at events on more than one occasion. </p>

<p>We relived a lot of our time working hard and playing hard as young professionals in Soho. </p>

<p>My life has moved on since then, and I now work with horses and dogs or their owners.</p>

<p>We unconventionally went for six starters to share on our lunch date as Sara is a pescatarian. </p>

<p>It was the perfect amount of food, which we enjoyed with a bottle of rosé. We later went for a walk around Kensington Palace, and then to a pub opposite for a drink.</p>

<p>Any embarrassing moments?</p>

<p>There were none.</p>

<p>Did sparks fly?</p>

<p>Sara is cool and bright, with plenty of energy. I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about the 'what ifs' of where a potential relationship could go.</p>

<p>While it could be the start of a spectacular affair, I feel it may fizzle out horribly — we both have big personalities. </p>

<p>We got on great as friends, and my instinct is it's probably best to keep it that way.</p>

<p>What do you think she thought of you?</p>

<p>I suspect we were both those badly behaved children other parents warn their offspring about. We are naturally drawn to getting into trouble.</p>

<p>Would your friends like her?</p>

<p>Of course. Sara is a fabulous girl to have around — she would get any party started.</p>
