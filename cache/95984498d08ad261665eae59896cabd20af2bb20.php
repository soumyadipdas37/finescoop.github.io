<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal have finally confirmed the £27m signing of defender Gabriel Magalhaes - as the club unveiled him a video on social media. </p>

<p>The club had teased fans by announcing that David Luiz and Willian will be joined by a 'special guest' in a group chat video, showing a picture of both players alongside a silhouette with a question mark, saying: 'You don't want to miss this one!'</p>

<p>They hinted that both players would reveal their fellow Brazilian as a Gunners player with the quote: 'I'm not sure I can talk about it yet... Let's call him!'</p>

<p> Arsenal have confirmed £27million the signing of Lille defender Gabriel Magalhaes</p>

<p>Arsenal teased his arrival by saying a 'guest' would appear in a clip with David Luiz and Willian</p>

<p>Arsenal emerged as front runners to land Magalhaes after agreeing a deal to sign him earlier this month - beating off competition from the likes of Napoli, Manchester United and Chelsea.</p>

<p>Last week he was in London to complete his medical, but was forced to quarantine for 14 days after arriving in the UK - meaning he faces a wait before linking up with Mikel Arteta's squad.</p>

<p>Gunners fans have been so keen for the club to wrap up the deal some even claimed to be tracking the Brazilian's car, with Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>smeagol_11 claiming to have found a vehicle owned by the youngster on the M1.  </p>

<p>Magalhaes emerged as one of the most sought-after defenders in Europe after a standout season with Lille, where he played 34 times for the club and starred in the Champions League.</p>

<p>Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has been eager to bolster his defensive options this summer</p>

<p>Magalhaes has emerged as one of the most talented defenders in Europe after a superb season</p>

<p>He played a total of 52 games for Lille after beginning his career with Brazilian side Avai - who he joined at the age of 13. He left for the Ligue 1 side in 2017 - quickly adjusting to life in France by learning the language. </p>

<p>He becomes Arsenal's fourth major signing of the summer after bringing in Pablo Mari and Cedric Soares on permanent deals from Flamengo and Southampton respectively, while Willian has also joined on a free transfer from Chelsea.</p>

<p>The arrival comes as a huge boost to Arteta, who has been hoping to strengthen his defensive options for the upcoming season, with his defenders coming under fire for a string of errors leading to goals.</p>

<p>William Saliba has also returned from a loan spell at St Etienne to give the Spaniard a few options to choose from.</p>

<p>And the resurgence of David Luiz in the middle of the back four means Magalhaes will have to fight for his place.</p>
