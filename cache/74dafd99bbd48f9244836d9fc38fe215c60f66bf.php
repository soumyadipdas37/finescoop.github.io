<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jeremy Corbyn's brother Piers has been handed the first £10,000 fine in London for an illegal gathering after he organised a march claiming coronavirus is a hoax.</p>

<p>The 73-year-old meteorologist led more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters who believe coronavirus is a hoax at the 'Unite for Freedom' rally in Trafalgar Square on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn, the older brother of the former Labour leader, was seen being hauled off by officers after the event and his Twitter account has since confirmed he was slapped with the colossal fine and 'held for ten hours.'</p>

<p>He was among eight other offenders who were fined across the rest of England under new lockdown measures imposed on Friday which are designed to stop gatherings of more than 30 people.</p>

<p>The others that were fined had all been organising raves or house parties.</p>

<p>The hefty fine is now being wielded by police forces across the country to discourage people from meeting in groups of more than 30. </p>

<p>On Saturday and into the early hours of Sunday, four people were fined £10,000 each for spearheading a rave in Headingly and another was fined the same for a house party in Leeds.</p>

<p>Two DJs were also fined £10,000 each and had their equipment seized by officers in Burley, West Yorkshire Police said.</p>

<p>The arrest of Mr Corbyn in Trafalgar Square was the third time the divisive anti-lockdown campaigner has been arrested since the pandemic started. He was carted out of Hyde Park by officers on May 16 and May 30.  </p>

<p>Another 1,715 people have tested positive for coronavirus today in the biggest daily rise in 12 weeks</p>

<p> But, in a positive sign, the country's death toll is remaining low as just one person died after testing positive for the disease bringing the UK's total fatalities during the pandemic to 41,499</p>

<p>The Unite for Freedom rally started at noon in the capital and they demonstrators marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament. </p>

<p>Pictures from the demonstration showed Trafalgar Square packed with protesters - none of whom wore masks - holding signs that branded the pandemic as a 'hoax'.  </p>

<p>Other signs claimed masks reduce immunity and likened the restrictions to 'child torture'. One person held a homemade placard on which he had scrawled 'no to mandatory vaccines.' </p>

<p>David Icke attended yesterday's protest and urged police to 'stop serving the psychopaths' and join those protesting in a speech addressing the cheering crowd. </p>

<p>Crowds of people packed together in Trafalgar Square on Saturday. A sign reading 'we do not consent' can be seen amid the protesters</p>

<p>Protesters held signs with the words 'plandemic' and 'scamdemic'. They also read: 'Save our children' and 'no forced vaccines'</p>

<p>Other signs read 'smiles not masks' and 'the great reset = digital slavery.' Thousands of protesters flocked to Trafalgar Square on Saturday</p>

<p>Video from the scene showed organisers label the Government 'terrorists who are waging a war on the people of this country'. </p>

<p>One man says: 'This is a political agenda to commit mass genocide on the population. That is their agenda.' </p>

<p>A poster advertising the event read: 'Nothing is more important as time is very short - the Government are voting for a two-year extension of their emergency Covid-19 powers in September 2020.</p>

<p>'The first six months was a disaster - this must not be allowed to continue! We have to take a stand.'</p>

<p>It lists its priorities as 'no more lockdowns, no social distancing, no masks. No track and trace, no health passports. No mandatory vaccinations, no 'new normal'. Restore all human rights that have been violated.'</p>

<p>The poster lists 'top world class doctors and nurses speaking out with real truth on Covid-19 against GMC constraints'.</p>

<p>Signs reading 'Covid cure: Strict 90-day TV-free diet' and 'we can choose' were clutched by demonstrators as they marched in London </p>

<p>A massive crowd of people took to the streets of London during the protest on Saturday. They clutched various signs as they marched to Westminster</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn was arrested on May 16 after he used a megaphone to say 'vaccination is not necessary' and '5G towers will be installed everywhere', adding: '5G enhances anyone who's got illness from Covid, so they work together.' </p>

<p>There is no evidence to link 5G and Covid-19 and scientists fear that a rise in measles among children can be attributed in part to unfounded fears about vaccines.</p>

<p>He was then arrested again on May 30 at a protest in which he also spoke through a megaphone.</p>

<p>There was one coronavirus death in the United Kingdom on Sunday and another 1,715 new cases were recorded. The death toll from the disease now stands at 41,499 and there have been 334,467 cases.  </p>
