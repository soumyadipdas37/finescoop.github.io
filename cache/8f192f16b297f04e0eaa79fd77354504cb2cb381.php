<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Meghan Markle offered royal fans a glimpse into her new dream $14 million Californian mansion during an appearance on America's Got Talent today.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Sussex, 39, made a surprise appearance on the season finale of the talent show to send a video message to singer Archie Williams, 59, a humble man who had been wrongly incarcerated for 36 years.  </p>

<p>Meghan spoke from her sprawling nine-bedroom and 16-bathroom mansion in upscale Santa Barbara which she shares with Prince Harry, 36, and their son Archie.</p>

<p>The mansion is known as 'The Chateau' for $14.65million on June 18, making them neighbors with celebrities Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres, according to DailyMail.com.  </p>

<p>While Prince Harry and Meghan have provided occasional glimpses into their home over the last few months, the former actor's appearance from her plush living room sofa offered royal fans the best look into the lavish Montecito mansion so far.</p>

<p> Her appearance offered a sneak peek into the private life of the Duke and Duchess and the objects and personal treasures they hold dear including feminist titles and books on race.</p>

<p>The Duchess has long favoured mid-century modern furniture and a white colour palette, and added vibrant pops of colour with accessories such as a huge bouquet of flowers.</p>

<p>Meghan has always been a fan of fresh flowers,  with  pink peonies declared as her favourite. </p>

<p>2. £50 candle</p>

<p>Among the candles decorating the sideboard was the £47 Diptyque Tubereuse candle, which features a 'sensual, generous and luscious' scent </p>

<p>The £27 Diptyque Tubereuse candle can be seen on the Meghan's shoulder on the side board.</p>

<p>The Sussexes took out a multi-million-pound mortgage to buy their spectacular home.</p>

<p>Sources say the couple are 'proud' to have bought the home without help from family.</p>

<p>Deeds show they took out a £7.25million mortgage to be paid back, plus interest, by 2050 – indicating they put down a deposit of around £3.8million.</p>

<p>Mortgage repayments will cost them some £30,000 a month and they will also have a yearly property tax of £220,000. </p>

<p>This is on top of the cost of maintenance, cleaning, staff and security and utilities which could run into tens of thousands of pounds a month.</p>

<p>The couple are also paying back the £2.4million spent on renovating Frogmore Cottage in £18,000-a-month instalments.</p>

<p>It is not clear how the duke and duchess will pay for all of this. When they quit royal duties they made a point of stressing that they wanted to become financially independent</p>

<p>The scent is described online as 'sensual, generous and luscious' and 'full of the heady and intoxicating fragrance derived from the sought-after Mexican white flower'.</p>

<p>According to it's online description, it can 'create an elegant ambience in the home for any occasion.'</p>

<p>The scented candle may be another piece selected by the Duchess, who has long been a fan of the brand. </p>

<p>She was known to have selected the Diptyque's Figuier, with fresh wood, green notes and crushed fig leaves, for her home in Toronto. </p>

<p>3. Monochrome artwork</p>

<p>Three large pieces of monchrome artwork can be seen directly behind Meghan's shoulder, which feature a bold black-and-white design.</p>

<p>While the pieces are currently unidentified, it is a bolder design than the Duchess' usual choice, who often selects fine art for her home. </p>

<p>Despite having two dogs with muddy paws and a young toddler, the royals have bravely opted for a white couch in their living space.</p>

<li>Cathedral candles</li>
</ol>

<p>Directly behind Meghan's right shoulder, three large cathedral candles can be seen on opulent candle sticks.</p>

<p>While the couple appear to have scented their home with fragrant candle, they have also decorated with the accessories to create some ambiance in the room.</p>

<p>7. Decorative bowls</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess have artfully arranged books around the room, but turned one into a design features by perching them underneath several black decorative bowls.</p>

<p>Meghan performed a similar styling trick while working as an actress in Suits and living at her Toronto home.      </p>

<li>The Black Godfather</li>
</ol>

<p>In what could be seen as a nod to their new media giant partner, the Duke and Duchess also featured The Black Godfather book on their sideboard, which is an accompanying piece for a documentary released on Netflix last year which tells the story of music executive Clarence Avant (right)</p>

<p>One of the most distinctive covers in the pile is a book bearing the words The Black Godfather.</p>

<p>He is known as “the godfather of black music” and very famous in the music industry. </p>

<li>Annie Leibovitz book</li>
</ol>

<p>Several of the pieces are coffee table books from celebrity photographs, including A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005 by Annie Leibovitz, who has photographed the Royal Family throughout the years</p>

<p>Several of the pieces are coffee table books from celebrity photographs, including A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005 by Annie Leibovitz.</p>

<p>The book may have been a choice from Prince Harry - the photographer has snapped the royal family on several occasions, taking a host of intimate portraits of the Queen and others between 2007 and 2016.</p>

<p>The long-time Vanity Fair photographer was also commissioned by the Queen to take her portrait to mark her 90th birthday in 2017.</p>

<p>It is not believed the Duchess has ever been snapped by the photographer. </p>

<p>The style is very similar to the interior of Meghan's Toronto home, where she lived before joining the royal family.</p>

<p>The then-actress regularly shared snaps on Instagram of her home's white colour palette and mid-century modern furnishings. </p>

<p>Despite having two dogs with muddy paws, the then-actress bravely opted for a white couch in her living space with a grey striped throw from the luxury textiles brand Pamuk and Co.  </p>

<p>Her dining table was white marble and she placed a full length shabby chic vintage mirror resting on the wall behind it to create the illusion of extra space. </p>

<p>While the star has long favoured mid-century modern furniture and a white colour palette, she added vibrant pops of colour with accessories such as a red striped rug in the hallway.</p>

<p>She has also always been a fan of fresh flowers, especially pink peonies which she has declared are her favourite. </p>

<p>But rather than being a gift from Harry, she reveals that she regularly treats herself to her favourite bouquets. </p>

<p>'I bought these peonies for myself yesterday because they make me so endlessly happy. Do something sweet for yourself today too,' she advised her followers.   </p>

<p>She's a fan of a scented candle, including Diptyque's Figuier with fresh wood, green notes and crushed fig leaves and the Le Labo Santal 26 Classic Candle, £51, with 'gentle, smokey and leathery tones'.</p>

<p>Meghan is also appreciates fine art, and had a print of one of fine art photographer Gray Malin's birds' eye view beach vistas on the the wall of her living area.</p>

<p>Above the bed in the guest room hung a figure study watercolour by New York based artist and illustrator Inslee Fariss, estimated to have cost $650 (£520).</p>

<p>In her own room, Meghan's bed frame was an oversized wrought iron birdcage design and she continued her white theme with the curtains and bedding. </p>

<p>Meghan artfully arranged her books around the house, turning them into design features by perching them underneath jugs of flowers. </p>

<p>She was a fan of coffee table fashion books, such as former Vogue Paris editor Carine Roitfeld's style bible and Linda McCartney's photographic memoir. </p>

<p>Meghan and Prince Harry's new home sits on 5.4 acres of land and immaculately clipped hedges border the estate's stone-pillared entry gates.</p>

<p>Property listings say the home took nearly five years to build and included a library, office, spa with a separate dry and wet sauna, a gym with a stripper pole, game room, arcade, theater, wine cellar and five-car garage.</p>

<p>The entrance to the property opens onto a wide lane paved with hand-cut Santa Barbara Stone that leads through a grand archway of trees to the main residence, according to Zillow.</p>

<p>The estate has sweeping lawns, tiered rose gardens, tall Italian cypress trees, blooming lavender, century old olive trees, a tennis court, tea house, children's cottage and a pool.</p>

<p>It also boasts a two-bedroom, two-bath guest house, perfect for Meghan's mother Doria, who is acting as one-year-old Archie's nanny. Doria has already been to the house, TMZ reports.</p>

<p>The home's seller is thought to be Russian tycoon Sergey Grishin who bought the 'palatial' mansion for more than $25million in 2009 and had tried to sell the home for up to $34million before eventually accepting a loss.</p>

<p>Grishin is also the former owner of a different California estate - known as the Scarface mansion because it appeared in the 1983 Al Pacino movie - which sold for a similarly cut-price $12million in 2015.</p>

<p>Surrounded by lush green gardens and overlooking the sea, the home has been described as a 'hidden paradise'.</p>

<p>One estate agent who spent an hour inside said it was 'designed for someone who never wants to leave home'.</p>

<p>Brett Buschbom said: 'I went through this house and an hour later I'm coming out like "wow", the whole bottom floor felt like a resort with steam room, massage room, sauna, Jacuzzi, full bar, arcade and one of the most amazing wine cellars and that was just the basement.' </p>

<p>While it is unknown if the couple have plans to transform their new home, the Duke and Duchess previously worked with interior designers to achieve the perfect look.</p>

<p>Last year, Meghan was understood to have enlisted Vicky Charles, former Global Head of Design at Soho House and a favourite of A-list celebrities, to work her magic on Frogmore House.</p>

<p>Speaking previously, Ms Charles has noted her Soho House interiors brought together the 'grit and the glamour'.</p>

<p>The overall feeling is one that is eclectic yet pulled-together, rooms that feel cohesive but are not overly rigid or matchy.  </p>
