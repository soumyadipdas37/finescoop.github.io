<p>This comes after Hilaria had a false labor alarm in late August.</p>

<p>She posted a selfie to her Instagram Story and explained: 'I've had a million kids but drove 3 hours to the dr today because I thought maybe I was in labor. You'd think I'd know by now.'</p>

<p>Hilaria went on: 'With living so far from the hospital due to COVID, I'm trying to anticipate labor even sooner.'</p>

<p>She added: 'Literally was there for 10 min and had to drive 3 hours back home because I was not in labor. I'm wiped.'</p>

<p>She added the graphics 'Road Trip' and 'Baby On Board'.</p>

<p>'Road trip': In August, Hilaria had shared with her social media followers that she'd had a false labor alarm</p>

<p>In 2019, Hilaria suffered two miscarriages as she tried to add to her family, both of which she candidly documented on social media in an attempt to normalize them for other women.  </p>

<p>She and her Blue Jasmine actor husband wanted another daughter to their family after welcoming three boys and have publicly said they will continue trying until that happens.</p>

<p>Also in August, she revealed that her 'quarantine bubble' had thrown her a surprise baby shower.</p>

<p>'I can't believe that Alec didn't tell me... Because we all know that he can't keep secrets from me! So this was soooooo well done!' she wrote over an image of the Hollywood star with their kids and friends. </p>

<p>Alec and Hilaria have been self-isolating with their children at their home in the upscale celebrity-studded enclave on Long Island.</p>

<p>They left their New York City abode when the coronavirus pandemic broke out in March and they have been holed up there ever since - although it is possibly they returned to the Big Apple just in time for the birth of their child. </p>
