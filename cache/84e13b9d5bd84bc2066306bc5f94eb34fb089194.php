<p>The 23-year-old covers the November issue of Cosmopolitan, where she gets candid about mental health — and the pressures and world events that have negatively impacted her generation.</p>

<p>'As an elder Gen Z, we’ve gotten our fair share of bad times,' she said. 'I mean, my first day of kindergarten was 9/11. We were the guinea pigs of the internet — you’re 11, and the darkness of the entire world is just packed into your computer and you’re scrolling through it.</p>

<p>Cover girl: Euphoria star and model Barbie Ferreira makes a stunning appearance on the November cover of Cosmopolitan</p>

<p>Candid: The 23-year-old opened p about her 'crippling anxiety,' 'depression issues, eating issues, paranoias,' and the other 'weird things' she insists are a result of the internet</p>

<p>'As an elder Gen Z, we’ve gotten our fair share of bad times,' she said. 'I mean, my first day of kindergarten was 9/11. We were the guinea pigs of the internet'</p>

<p>'That had to do something to my brain,' she went on.</p>

<p>'I mean, I got crippling anxiety. A lot of depression issues, eating issues, paranoias, and just weird things that I’m one thousand per cent certain are from the internet.'</p>

<p>The star also admitted to working through a Juul addiction. </p>

<p>'I don’t know if we’re designed to do that... to chat online with strangers when you’re nine. God knows who I was talking to,' she said.</p>

<p>Feeling things deeply, though, may have helped her career. Barbie says she was an 'emotional' and 'empathetic' kid, which led her to acting.</p>

<p>Fun! These days, she said, an addiction to the game Animal Crossing takes up a lot of her time online</p>

<p>These days, she said, an addiction to the game Animal Crossing takes up a lot of her time online — so much that if she didn't create structure for herself, she'd be up playing at 4 a.m. </p>

<p>But having a fun, mindless hobby may be just what she needs to keep her mind of more serious issues plaguing the country. </p>

<p>Barbie said that in the past four years, the country has become a more 'hateful' place, which has contributed to a lot of 'sadness' and 'mental neuroses,' particularly in younger people. </p>

<p>'In the years since Trump was elected, I’ve noticed how popular very, very hateful beliefs are,' she said. </p>

<p>'It’s a disservice to oneself to think that everyone thinks the way you do. It’s more apparent now than ever in my life that I am living in a different world than a lot of people. </p>

<p>Hard: Barbie said that in the past four years, the country has become a more 'hateful' place,</p>

<p>Scary times: She said it has contributed to a lot of 'sadness' and 'mental neuroses,' particularly in younger people</p>

<p>'We think we’re the greatest country, we think we’re perfect, we think we’re the land of the free, but inherently, we’re not. We’re disillusioned about the country. </p>

<p>'I think that’s where Gen Z gets a lot of the angst and the sadness and the mental neuroses. We still haven’t reckoned with this.' </p>

<p>In the interview — which hits  newsstands on October 13 — Barbie also discussed her role in the new film Unpregnant, a comedy about abortion. </p>

<p>'Normalizing abortion is what we have to do,' she said.</p>

<p>'Society puts this pressure on people who are getting abortions, that they should feel a lot of guilt and shame and really emotional about it. Most people are just relieved.'</p>

<p>On TV: Barbie plays Kat Hernandez on the HBO show Euphoria</p>

<p>Showing up: On September 9, she attended the premiere of the film, a drive-in event hosted by HBO Max in Glendale, California</p>

<p>She wore a blue watercolor dress for the occasion, which she smartly accessorized with a protective face mask.</p>

<p>Face masks may make doing makeup a bit easier, but the star still fully embraced cosmetics, adding extra glamour with blue eyeshadow and long lashes. </p>
