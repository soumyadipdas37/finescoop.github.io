<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She is the daughter of a rockstar, but Anaïs Gallagher's life during lockdown was anything but glamorous. </p>

<p>The 20-year-old told Tatler how she spent part of the year looking after pregnant goats, feeding kids and hatching chicks after moving in with her Insta-famous farmer boyfriend, Julius Roberts. </p>

<p>Speaking to the magazine, Anaïs explained she had only intended to stay in Dorset for a couple of nights when lockdown hit and the couple, who met shortly before Christmas, decided to spend the next few uncertain months together in the country.</p>

<p>Anaïs Gallagher revealed she spent lockdown looking after pregnant goats, feeding kids and hatching chicks after moving in with her Insta-famous farmer boyfriend, Julius Roberts. Pictured, the couple on Julius' family farm in Dorset for the new issue of Tatler</p>

<p>'I came to see Julius for the weekend, then stayed as everything kicked off,' she explained. 'I naïvely thought this was going to blow over in two weeks. </p>

<p>'And we were busy. We were looking after the pregnant goats, then the newborn kids. We were hatching chicks, as well.' </p>

<p>Away from the farm, the couple found time to indulge their shared hobbies. </p>

<p>Anaïs continued: 'We're big readers, we watch films, walk the dogs, and we love the awards season, so we try to watch everything that's being nominated. As I'm studying photography, I'm massively into cinematography and film.'</p>

<p>Julius, known by the handle telltalefood on Instagram, made a name for himself on social media thanks to his cooking and farming content.  </p>

<p>Wrapping up: On Sunday, Anais also took to social media in the midst of her relaxing country walk, though she appeared to be struggling with the chilly weather</p>

<p>Changes: The daughter of Oasis legend Noel Gallagher recently shared a glimpse of her new home in the sprawling fields, as she raised a family of goats with her chef beau</p>

<p>His family lived in Suffolk before relocating to Dorset a few months ago. He and Anaïs now split their time between the farm and London. </p>

<p>'Julius is the perfect combination for me,' Anaïs said about her boyfriend. 'He's intellectual, artistic and has a great understanding of music, but he adores animals and nature as much as me.'</p>

<p>While he has met her mother Meg Matthews, 54, he has yet to meet Noel because of his hectic schedule.  </p>

<p>In awe: She then went onto find the views from an incredible waterfall in the middle of the picturesque countryside</p>

<p>'He [Noel] is just so busy,' Anaïs said. 'He's not your normal dad. </p>

<p>'Even during lockdown he was working: writing, recording and whatever. He doesn't constantly ask where I am or who I'm with.' </p>

<p>The couple could also soon find themselves working together in a professional capacity, with Julius, who has plenty of offers from publishers, explaining he has his sights set on a Netflix series. </p>

<p>He added: 'I’m still just learning. I’m building up a bank of recipes, rearing animals, focusing on sustainability and reconnecting people with their food. </p>

<p>'The real aim is to try to get into film and TV with Netflix or Amazon – a series through the seasons, with a focus on farming, cooking, animal welfare, foraging. With Anaïs mucking in, of course. One day, I’d love to move to Italy and revive a crumbling farm there.'</p>
