<p>The man was using a safety line put in place to help climbers making their way up the cliff</p>

<p>According to notes attached to the video: 'This rope swing has only been rigged three times and two of those times by our crew. </p>

<p>'It's rigged off the currently longest highlilne in Yosemite which is a 1,000 feet long. The jump is 230 feet into the abyss.' </p>

<p>The footage, which was filmed earlier this month, has been viewed widely on the internet because of the man's apparent fearless actions. </p>
