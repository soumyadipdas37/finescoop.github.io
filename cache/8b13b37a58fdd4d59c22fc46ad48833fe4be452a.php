<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>All 20 Premier League clubs have given the green light on plans to allow all top-flight matches to be shown live on TV this season until at least October 1.</p>

<p>Out of the first 28 games of the 2020-21 season, 11 matches weren't due to be screened but that has changed with every match available to watch live.</p>

<p>The 11 outstanding games are now likely to be split between Sky Sports, BT Sport, Amazon Prime and BBC.  </p>

<p>Premier League clubs have given the green light to show all games on TV until October 1</p>

<p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had come under pressure from supporters</p>

<p>The u-turn by the 20 clubs and Premier League executives follows pressure from supporters and the government to show games that are behind closed doors. </p>

<p>There are plans for supporters to be allowed back into stadiums next month albeit with capacity scaled back to between 15 and 35 per cent.</p>

<p>But those plans are being continually reviewed and any further rise in coronavirus cases could impact how quickly more supporters are allowed back.      </p>

<p>The 20 Premier League clubs reportedly met on Monday to discuss the broadcasting plans</p>

<p>All Premier League games following last season's restart in June were shown live on television</p>

<p>This is the second time the 3pm Saturday blackout has been scrapped this year, as all top-flight games were shown on TV following the Premier League's return in June. </p>

<p>Some games were shown on free-to-air channels, including four on the BBC, with others on Sky One and Sky's Pick channel.  </p>

<p>So far, TV picks have only been made for the opening three matches of the 2020-21 Premier League season.    </p>
