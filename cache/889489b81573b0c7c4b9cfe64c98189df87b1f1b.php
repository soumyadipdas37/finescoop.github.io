<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An abandoned 30lb monster moggy who weighs the same as a three-year-old has embarked on a diet and fitness regime in a desperate bid to shift the 'quarantine flab'. </p>

<p>Lasagna, who tips the scales at a whopping 29.5lbs (2st 1lb) is nearly four times the healthy 8lbs weight for a cat and struggled to walk and groom herself. </p>

<p>The plump cat was found abandoned in a dog crate overnight in Hunting Park by ACCT Philly shelter workers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Sunday September 20. </p>

<p>Stunned staff put Lasagna, named after Garfield's favorite meal, on a strict diet and had to help her clean herself, a task she found impossible to do due to her size. </p>

<p>Since sharing snaps of the five-year-old domestic short-haired cat, the shelter was flooded with offers from people who fell in love with Lasagna's 'chunky' frame and penchant for belly rubs. </p>

<p>Lasagna was adopted yesterday by the Hammer family from Vineland, New Jersey, who have vowed to shower her with love and help her shift the stubborn weight. </p>

<p>Lasagna, an obese moggy cat from Philadelphia,was found in a dog crate by the ACCT Philly shelter. She weighs almost 30lbs (2st 1lb), the weight of a three-year-old child </p>

<p>ACCT's director of development and communications Sarah Barnett said: 'Lasagna's very friendly and social, and enjoys belly rubs. </p>

<p>'The ideal adopter for a cat like this is someone who understands that while it's cute, it is extremely unhealthy for an animal to be this size. </p>

<p>'They need to be willing to work with a vet to help the animal lose weight in a healthy way. </p>

<p>'Obese cats can have a variety of health problems occur - diabetes, thyroid issues, joint issues, heart problems - the list goes on. </p>

<p>Gentle Lasagna (pictured) was put on a strict diet in a bid to help her shift the weight. Being overweight can lead to serious health issues for cats</p>

<p>Because of her large frame, Lasagna (pictured) suffers from stiff joints but she is young enough to turn the tide around and get back to a healthy life </p>

<p>'She already suffers from stiff joints as well as not being able to groom herself. </p>

<p>'Right now she is fortunate in that she is a young five-year-old cat, so in a home that can help her lose the weight with the guidance of a vet, she will hopefully live a long happy and healthier life.'</p>

<p>Sarah said the shelter was inundated with offers of support to help Lasagna, and hopes that people will consider helping other abandoned cats. </p>

<p>Sarah said: 'We are always sad to see an animal abandoned as it means we don't get that animal's history, and we also miss the opportunity to talk to the owner surrendering a pet to see if we can help them keep the animal. </p>

<p>Lasagna has now found a loving home who will hopefully help her lose the weight and get healthy </p>

<p>The shelter had to bathe Laagna because her condition means she cannot do it herself, as it is  too painful </p>

<p>'Sometimes people hit hard times and just need a helping hand to get through it. </p>

<p>'We've received inquiries from hundreds of people about Lasagna, and it's great because it shows people want to help. </p>

<p>'We hope that everyone who was interested in Lasagna considers another cat who needs a home, there are so many and adult cats are often overlooked because they are stressed when in shelter environments.'</p>

<p>ACCT's director of development and communications Sarah Barnett said people needed to understand that it was extremely unhealthy for a cat to be this big</p>

<p>Sweet lasagna loves belly rubs, is very sociable and friendly, but she needs supervision to lose the weight </p>

<p>The shelter was inundated with offers of support to help Lasagna, and hopes that people will consider helping other abandoned cats</p>
