<p>But yesterday, the Poet Laureate Simon Armitage – whose uplifting new work about how the pandemic has changed lives is released on National Poetry Day today – told how it sometimes left him lost for words.</p>

<p>In a Zoom interview with the Mail from the study of his home in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, where he wrote his latest work titled Something Clicked, he said he’d had a lot more time to pick up his pen – but had talked to other writers who ‘found it very difficult to concentrate because of the background of loss, anxiety and worry’.</p>

<p>Poet Laureate Simon Armitage's new work about how the pandemic has changed lives is released on National Poetry Day today. He told how lockdown sometimes left him lost for words</p>

<p>‘It’s been a bit of both for me,’ he said. </p>

<p>‘I’ve got through a lot of writing, but there have been days when it’s been 9am and then 5pm and not much work has happened. Sometimes I’m staring out that Velux window for a long time.</p>

<p>‘My usual modus operandi is to go out and engage with the world. You get the headline ideas, but it’s all those little encounters – walking down the street, going in the shop – that produce the infill needed to expand the poems that’s been missing.’</p>

<p>In his latest poem, a commission for BT, Mr Armitage, 57, reflects on the ‘new world’ where ‘you’re at school in the kitchen, at work in the attic, in Ancient Rome in the lounge’. </p>

<p>His latest work is a commission for BT, who will be replacing radio, press and TV adverts with extracts from the poem today</p>

<p>He said the poem took ‘about a month, writing on and off’ to complete. It is more upbeat than the work he released in March, Lockdown, which focused on the outbreak of the bubonic plague in 17th-century Eyam, the Derbyshire village that quarantined itself.</p>

<p>Mr Armitage, married to radio producer Sue Roberts, admitted the arts world is ‘really on its knees’. </p>

<p>‘It’s very cruel what happening,’ he said. ‘When we come through this it’s a sector that will need particular help.’</p>
