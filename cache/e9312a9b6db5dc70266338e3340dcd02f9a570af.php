<p>Australian Cricketer Usman Khawaja has staunchly defended his older brother (pictured together) over a messy entanglement with a love rival he falsely accused of plotting a terror attack</p>

<p>'Up until this period of his life, he had been an ideal citizen...a model citizen, up until recently,' Usman Khawaja said. </p>

<p>He testified that he had looked up to his brother who had been very popular, did well at school and university, worked at IBM at a high level and obtained clearance to do government work.  </p>

<p>Usman Khawaja also told the court he was much loved by his cricketing teammates. </p>

<p>When his brother was arrested, he maintained it was a police set-up and he'd done nothing wrong.</p>

<p>But he acknowledged Arsalan Khawaja has since admitted his actions, undergone treatment and apologised every time he spoke to him. </p>

<p>Australian Cricketer Usman Khawaja (pictured) faced court on Friday to defend his brother with a glowing character reference </p>

<p>His comments were made via audio-visual link from Brisbane as part of evidence for his brother's sentencing  </p>

<p>The 40-year-old pleaded guilty earlier this year to four charges including perverting the course of justice and forging a document for a public official to accept as genuine.  </p>

<p>Arsalan Khawaja broke down as he admitted forging entries in the notebook of his UNSW colleague Kamer Nizamdeen in August 2018 after being jealous of his contact with a female friend.</p>

<p>The entries also included death threats against the governor-general, as well as lists to attack police stations, an Anzac Day ceremony, the Boxing Day Test match and landmarks including St Mary's Cathedral.</p>

<p>Mr Nizamdeen was arrested and held in a high-security jail for one month until the truth was discovered.</p>

<p>'Kamer is a top bloke. He is a friend of mine and I let him down,' Khawaja said.</p>

<p>'I caused him a lot of pain. I caused his family a lot of pain. He didn't do anything.'</p>

<p>He denied wanting him arrested, saying he just wanted him to be investigated and to leave work so Khawaja could spend time with the woman.</p>

<p>Asked why he didn't tell police the truth after his friend's arrest, he said 'to be blunt, i was a coward' and didn't want to be arrested himself.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old pleaded pleaded guilty earlier this year to four charges including perverting the course of justice and forging a document for a public official to accept as genuine</p>

<p>He also admitted he had framed another man in 2017, phoning authorities to make visa and terrorism accusations based off similar feelings of jealousy. </p>

<p>But naming his famous brother as a possible target of his latest victim revealed his own identity, ultimately landing him in jail and before the courts over the incident. </p>

<p>He also denied wanting the man deported, saying he had just hoped that the call would 'simply lead me to getting more time' with a woman connected to them both.</p>

<p>He spoke of being 'terrified of abandonment', of hearing voices and having hallucinations, and having been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for which he is now being treated.</p>

<p>'I am ashamed of the person I had become before I came to jail.' </p>

<p>The sentence hearing will continue before Judge Robert Weber on October 2.</p>
