<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Indigenous Australians will create a new Aboriginal flag if the government doesn't buy the copyright for the current one, a former Olympian has warned.</p>

<p>Nova Peris, the first indigenous Australian to win an Olympic gold medal, said the Federal Government should be purchasing the flag's copyright as 'a matter of national emergency'. </p>

<p>While most flags are not subject to copyright, the Aboriginal flag is unique because its creator Howard Thomas designed the flag in 1971 and won a High Court battle in 1997 to receive payment for its use. </p>

<p>Ms Peris warned a senate inquiry that if the copyright wasn't bought, then Indigenous Australians would design and create a new one. </p>

<p>'I do believe the community will turn its back on the existing design and move to create a new symbol that represents the freedom, identity and survival of us Aboriginal peoples,' she wrote to the inquiry, Sydney Morning Herald reported.</p>

<p>Since Mr Thomas won his case, Ms Peris said there has been a significant 'decrease in the visibility and availability' of products with the Aboriginal flag.</p>

<p>'It has also meant that for the first time since the early 1970s, that Aboriginal people are electing to not use the flag, starting conversations about designing a new flag.' </p>

<p>Mr Thomas enlisted three companies to control copyright licenses, including WAM clothing in 2018.</p>

<p>This means WAM Clothing collects fees from its use, and then passes a portion of the money back to Mr Thomas. </p>

<p>It also means the flag cannot be used on clothing or in any media without the consent of WAM.  </p>

<p>Ms Peris (pictured) said the taxpayer should not be forking out to buy the copyright from Mr Thomas</p>

<p>WAM director Semele Moore said the copyright agreement was not stopping people from using the Aboriginal flag for personal use.  </p>

<p>Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister Ken Wyatt said the government will respect all parties involved in the acquisition of the design.</p>

<p>'I commit to doing everything I can to bring about a resolution that respects not only the artist of the flag, but a resolution that respects the rights, enterprise and opportunity of all Australians,' he previously said.  </p>

<p>An online petition calling for the government to step in and buy the copyright has so gained more than 144,000 signatures.</p>
