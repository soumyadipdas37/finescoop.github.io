<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>BBC bosses face new questions about why they promised to rebook a black comedienne who made dodgy remarks about killing white people.</p>

<p>Sophie Duker, 30, claimed that she was booked by producers of Frankie Boyle's irreverent BBC2 panel show New World Order for an episode about the Black Lives Matter movement 'last minute' so the panel was not 'all-white'.</p>

<p>The Left-wing female comic allegedly then refused to appear on future episodes of the programme unless the BBC hired other black panelists. </p>

<p>In an interview for the RHLSTP comedy podcast, Ms Duker revealed that the Corporation privately admitted that it 'understood' her concerns and vowed to make it an 'easy yes' to bring her back by meeting the 'terms' she outlined.</p>

<p>Critics now accuse the the BBC, whose new Director-General has vowed to tackle the problem of 'Left-wing comedy bias' in its programming, of pandering to Ms Duker's requirements despite a fierce public backlash after her appearance.</p>

<p>The comedienne, who has also appeared on Eight Out of Ten Cats, made controversial statements about racism and 'white power' where she called 'whiteness' a 'capitalist structure' and joked about 'killing whitey'.</p>

<p>Speaking with Richard Herring for the podcast yesterday, Ms Duker said: 'I was asked to do the news quiz at very short notice after having already done an episode in the series, and I sort of immediately knew it would be to speak about Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>'They told me shortly after that I was replacing another comic, who was a white man, and it would have been an all-white panel, and that's why I'd been booked.</p>

<p>'I said I wouldn't go back on the short again unless there was another black person on the show. There's been no other person of colour involved editorially at all.</p>

<p>'I was emailed (by the BBC) afterwards and they said that they basically understood why I did it… They would really like to have me back and to make it like an easy yes on the terms I outlined. I thought it was really gracious and classy'.  </p>

<p>Sophie Duker, 30, claimed she was booked by producers of Frankie Boyle's show New World Order for an episode about Black Lives Matter 'last minute' so the panel was not 'all-white'</p>

<p>Controversial statements about racism and 'white power' were made by comic Sophie Duker in an episode of the new series of Frankie Boyle's panel show New World Order</p>

<p>MailOnline has approached the BBC for comment. </p>

<p>Yesterday the BBC came under fire for airing 'racist' remarks by the 'Marxist' comic in an episode about the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

<p>In a segment where the panelists discuss if the movement 'glosses over the complexities of a world where we all need to come together and kill whitey', Boyle played a clip of black author James Baldwin talking about 'black power' in an interview on the Dick Cavett Show in the 1970s.  </p>

<p>Responding to the clip, Duker said 'white power is Trump Tower' - a nod to Left-wing allegations that the US President is a racist.</p>

<p>She continued: 'But when we say we want to kill whitey, we don't really mean we want to kill whitey'. Ms Duker then quips to the panelists 'we do' to roars of laughter.</p>

<p>Ms Duker added: 'But when people react to people saying white privilege - whiteness is a capitalist structure, it benefits itself. </p>

<p>'It hurts white people, it hurts non-black people, it hurts black people.</p>

<p>Controversial statements about racism and 'white power' were made by comic Sophie Duker in an episode of the new series of Frankie Boyle's panel show New World Order</p>

<p>Throughout her monologue, Duker's co-panelists - Frankie Boyle, Sara Pascoe and Jamali Maddix - can be seen nodding and heard humming in agreement with the comedian </p>

<p>The segment fueled anger from a growing chorus of licence-fee payers who question why the BBC is 'broadcasting 'comedy' where they 'joke' about killing an entire race of people'</p>

<p>Duker was born in London to first-generation immigrants from West Africa. Her mother is from Cameroon and her father is from Ghana. She studied French and English at Wadham College, Oxford. She joined the Oxford Imps in her first year at university.</p>

<p>An alumna of the Pleasance Comedy Reserve, Duker was shortlisted for the Funny Women award in 2015. She founded and hosted the 'Manic Pixie Dream Girls' show as part of Edinburgh's Free Festival in 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>Duker was an assistant producer for Frankie Boyle's New World Order and a researcher for 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown. In 2019, she appeared on 8 Out of 10 Cats, Frankie Boyle's New World Order, Dave Gorman: Terms and Conditions Apply, and Mock the Week, and in 2020 in 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.</p>

<p>In 2018, Duker set up the comedy night 'Wacky Racists', which currently has a monthly residency at 2Northdown in Kings Cross, London, and performs spin-off shows at festivals and events across the UK. In December 2019, Soho Theatre hosted a seasonal Christmas 'Wacky Racists' special.</p>

<p>Duker co-starred in the pilot for a hidden camera sketch show on Channel 4 called Riot Girls as well as on the Comedy Central UK comedy show What I Wish I'd Said in 2018.</p>

<p>Her first stand-up show, 'Diet Woke', was premiered in 2018. She took her 2019 show, 'Venus', to the Brighton Fringe and the Edinburgh Fringe, performing at the Edinburgh Pleasance from July 31 to August 25, 2019.</p>

<p>'But still this kind of fear of a black alternative, and it's these sort of rhetorics battling against each other, these extreme capitalist rhetorics of supremacy.'</p>

<p>The segment fueled anger from a growing chorus of disgruntled licence-fee payers who question why the BBC is 'broadcasting comedy' where they 'joke' about killing an entire race of people'. Actor Laurence Fox thundered: 'The BBC must have a no tolerance policy on ALL forms of racism.'</p>

<p>A BBC spokesman rubbished criticism of its decision to air the 'Marxist' comic, telling MailOnline: 'Frankie Boyle's New World Order was shown after 10pm and its content is within audience expectations for a post-watershed, topical, satirical programme from a comedian whose style and tone are well-established'. </p>

<p>TalkRadio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer said: 'This is horrible. It's not just unfunny, it's incoherent nonsensical Marxist gobbledegook. The white contributors nodding along supportively as this woman jokes about killing people who look like them is just plain sick.'</p>

<p>Brexiteer Darren Grimes claimed: 'This is from BBC comedy's New World Order. I'm not sure how this is 'comedy'. </p>

<p>'I'm not sure why our cash is paying for it. I'm not sure why the BBC isn't challenging those determined to do all that they can to divide us with this hateful wordsoup of divisive dross.'</p>

<p>Another social media user tweeted: 'Whiteness hurts black people'??? Really? Doesn't sound like a joke to me. Imagine Frankie Boyle saying 'Blackness hurts white people!''</p>

<p>One commented: 'Shouldn't Ofcom be monitoring and taking action against this kind of incitement to violence masquerading as comedy?'  </p>

<p>It comes after Tim Davie, the BBC's new Director-General, vowed to tackle the problem of 'Left-wing comedy bias' at the Corporation. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, it was reported that Mr Davie wanted a radical overhaul of the broadcaster's comedy output in the coming months, over fears it is seen as is seen as 'too one-sided'. </p>

<p>Shows such as BBC Two's satirical comedy The Mash Report and The Now Show on Radio 4 and Have I Got News For You have previously been criticised.  </p>
