<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Inter Milan are looking to sell Christian Eriksen less than eight months after signing him from Tottenham in January, according to reports.</p>

<p>After a tricky few months in North London, Inter agreed to sign the midfielder for around £16million during the January transfer window. </p>

<p>Whilst on the surface it appeared to be a great deal for the Serie A giants, the Danish international has failed to impress under boss Antonio Conte.</p>

<p>Inter Milan are ready to sell midfield flop Christian Eriksen after just eight months at the club</p>

<p>The Danish international joined from Tottenham back in January but has not impressed</p>

<p>Eriksen has managed to score just once and provide two assists from 17 Serie A matches after joining midway through the campaign.</p>

<p>Conte is willing to sell the former Tottenham star and is hoping for a fee around £44million, reported Corriere dello Sport.</p>

<p>The ex-Chelsea boss has noted Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal as a target this summer but would need the funds from selling Eriksen in order to pursue the Chilean.</p>

<p>Vidal has been one of the several Barcelona stars to be shunned out by new manager Ronald Koeman. </p>

<p>Inter Milan boss Antonio Conte is willing to sell Eriksen but wants around £44million for him</p>

<p>Conte has identified Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal as a target but needs funds from a sale</p>

<p>In response, the 33-year-old hit out at his own club for only having '13 professional players', so many youth products in the first team and relying too heavily on Lionel Messi.</p>

<p>Whilst it appears that Nicolo Barella and Marcelo Brozovic will remain in Conte's plans heading into the new season, Eriksen's place in the team is less certain.</p>

<p>After his poor start to life with the Nerazzurri club, Eriksen may fail to attract much attention from potential buyers - especially with Inter asking for £44million. </p>
