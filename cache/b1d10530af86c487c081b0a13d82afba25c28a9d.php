<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A young skier who put on 25kg and almost wound up with diabetes because her 'healthy' snacks were full of sugar has landed a multi million-dollar deal with Coles.</p>

<p>Keira Rumble's Olympic dreams were crushed when she shattered her shins and broke both arms while training at the age of 15 in 2006.</p>

<p>The accident sparked the beginning of a five-year sugar addiction the Sydney woman developed as a coping mechanism.</p>

<p>When she started experiencing constant headaches, nausea, fatigue and depression as a result of her sugar consumption, Ms Rumble started exercising and making what she thought were healthier food choices.</p>

<p>Keira Rumble's Olympic dreams were crushed when she shattered her shins and broke both arms while training at the age of 15 in 2006</p>

<p>Ms Rumble (pictured with a Beauty Bar) started experiencing constant headaches, nausea, fatigue and depression as a result of her sugar consumption</p>

<p>But when her weight plateaued, she realised her favourite pre and post exercise protein balls were the culprits - containing the equivalent of two cinnamon doughnuts' worth of sugar. </p>

<p>'I felt almost betrayed by these companies that say they are the healthier option. So much branding and marketing goes into the products, it's misleading,' she previously told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>Spurred on by a warning from her doctors that she would become 'diabetic before you know it' if she didn't improve her lifestyle, she realised she needed to make a change and wanted to help others do the same.   </p>

<p>Ms Rumble, now 30, combined her passion for nutrition with her love of beauty products and created Krumbled Foods - a health food brand specialising in $4 'Beauty Bars'. </p>

<p>Ms Rumble (pictured) used her pre-diabetic diagnosis as motivation to launch her now-booming business, built around the best-selling Beauty Bites she holds here</p>

<p>Ms Rumble said she will 'never use dates' - the sweetener typically used in 'health foods' - because of their high content of natural sugar</p>

<p>The bars have just 2.8 grams of sugar and are sweetened with monk fruit, a small green melon native to southern China used as a substitute for refined sugar.</p>

<p>She said she will 'never use dates' - the sweetener typically used in 'health foods' - because of their high content of natural sugar.</p>

<p>'They're a big no-no for us because it's the cheapest way to bulk out a product,' she said.</p>

<p>'Dates are great in moderation if you've got an active lifestyle, but especially now during COVID when we're a lot more sedentary, the sugar catches up on you.'</p>

<p>Each bar also has skin-improving collagen, vitamin C and E, prebiotics and probiotics - an idea that came about when she realised how much money she was spending on cosmetics, skin and gut supplements. </p>

<p>Ms Rumble's Beauty Bites (pictured in the basket) are now stocked in Coles and Priceline Australia-wide</p>

<p>The qualified nutritionist explained that getting all the right vitamins often involves taking a cocktail of powders, tablets, capsules and liquids.  </p>

<p>'I knew there had to be an easier way to get my collagen and gut health supplements into a more enjoyable experience,' she told news.com.au. </p>

<p>'I wanted something that you can pop in your handbag and away you go, but I also wanted to replace what I was eating with my morning coffee.'</p>

<p>Collagen is linked to a slew of health benefits including reduced wrinkles, stronger bones, brighter skin and smoother movement of joints. </p>

<p>Sydney businesswoman Keira Rumble, 30, whose healthy snack brand banked her six figures in its  first three weeks of business</p>

<p>She started making Beauty Bar prototypes in her kitchen with the aim of concocting something 'delicious'.</p>

<p>Experts helped her bring the recipe to ensure it met food regulations, and had the right flavours and textures.</p>

<p>The product launched in 2017 and was picked up by chemist Priceline in 2019 - selling out of what was supposed to be a year's supply in just three weeks.</p>

<p>The unprecedented sales brought in a six figure profit, but her most recent deal with Coles has cemented the bars as a leading health snack.</p>

<p>'We launched into Coles in the middle of a pandemic, which was extremely nerve-racking,' she said. </p>

<p>About 50 per cent of supermarkets sold out of Beauty Bites in July.</p>

<p>Fans sent Ms Rumble videos of supermarket customers filling their trolleys with whole boxes of the bars</p>

<p>Krumbled Foods is set to make $5million in its second year as a result of the Coles and Priceline contracts. </p>

<p>Ms Rumble was also chosen as the Australian recipient of this year's Sephora Accelerate Program, which scouts promising female entrepreneurs in the health industry and provides them with funding, mentoring and connections to investors.</p>

<p>She is preparing to release six new products before the end of the year, coronavirus-related logistical issues notwithstanding, along with a clean cosmetics line called Habitual Beauty slated to launch in October. </p>

<p>New flavour Choc Cherry Coconut will be added to the already popular White Chocolate Raspberry, Lemon Coconut and Apple Cinnamon.  </p>
