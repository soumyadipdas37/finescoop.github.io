<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The king of Thailand has pardoned his concubine after throwing her in jail last year and had her flown to Germany to join his Alpine harem, it is claimed. </p>

<p>Playboy monarch Maha Vajiralongkorn, 68, has spent much of the pandemic in Germany with a reputed entourage of 'sex soldiers' assembled as a military unit at a four-star hotel. </p>

<p>According to Bild, they are about to be joined by former royal bodyguard Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, 35 - who was appointed 'royal consort' last year but quickly fell from grace and was stripped of all her titles. </p>

<p>Now, the king is thought to have granted her a royal reprieve - and went to Munich Airport himself to pick her up. </p>

<p>King and consort: Thai monarch Maha Vajiralongkorn appointed former royal bodyguard Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi as his consort last year (pictured together in August 2019) - but she soon fell from grace and was stripped of her titles </p>

<p>Experience: Sineenat had trained as a pilot in Thailand and abroad, served in the King's royal bodyguard unit, and in 2019 was awarded the rank of a major-general</p>

<p>The consort, also known as Koi Wongvajirapakdi, was gifted the title of royal consort to mark the king's 67th birthday last July. </p>

<p>It was the first time in nearly a century that a Thai monarch had taken a consort, after the king married his fourth wife Queen Suthida earlier in 2019.</p>

<p>Sineenat had trained as a pilot in Thailand and abroad, served in the king's royal bodyguard unit, and in 2019 was awarded the rank of a major-general. </p>

<p>During the king's elaborate three-day coronation ceremony, Sineenat was seen marching in full military uniform in a procession that travelled from the palace to several Buddhist temples. </p>

<p>However, Sineenat was out within three months and stripped of all her titles for 'disloyalty' and alleged 'ambition' to match the Queen's position. </p>

<p>Her actions showed 'she does not give any honour to the king and does not understand royal tradition... her actions are to benefit herself', a statement claimed.     </p>

<p>Koi has apparently been in prison since then, although her exact whereabouts were unclear. </p>

<p>According to Bild, she was in the Bang Kwang maximum-security prison where inmates including drug dealers are constantly monitored with webcams. </p>

<p>The prison is said to include around 1,000 people on death row, and was the venue where Thailand carried out its first execution for nearly a decade in 2018.   </p>

<p>Thailand expert Andrew MacGregor Marshall said she had been in a women's prison at a different compound in Bangkok. </p>

<p>However, he cited palace sources on Friday saying that Sineenat had been released and was due to fly to Germany imminently. </p>

<p>The report by Bild said she was taken straight to the airport and flown to Munich on a private plane, with a refuelling stop in Dubai. </p>

<p>The Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in southern Germany where the King of Thailand has reputedly been staying with a harem of women during the pandemic </p>

<p>Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida during their wedding ceremony in Bangkok in May last year. According to tradition, the King has a semi-divine status and must be seated higher than those around him </p>

<p>On Saturday morning, the king himself is said to have picked her up wearing his customary tank top at Munich Airport. </p>

<p>The king and his entourage then drove straight to the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in the German resort town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, it is claimed. </p>

<p>Reports earlier this year said the king had booked out the whole fourth floor which includes a 'pleasure room' and is decked out with 'treasures and antiques' from Thailand.</p>

<p>His 'sex soldiers' are said to be assembled as a military unit called the SAS like Britain's special forces - with the same motto, 'who dares wins'. </p>

<p>One hotel worker said staff are forbidden from the fourth floor where the king and his entourage have set up camp.  </p>

<p>However, the king's diplomatic immunity means that there is little German authorities can do about it.  </p>

<p>Queen Suthida reportedly spends most of her time at Hotel Waldegg in Engelberg, Switzerland, without her husband. </p>

<p>The king is protected from criticism in Thailand by one of the world's toughest defamation laws, with prison sentences up to 15 years. </p>

<p>However, some protesters have made veiled criticisms by asking what the weather was like in Germany. </p>

<p>A hashtag that translates to 'why do we need a king?' became popular in Thailand after an overseas activist posted about Vajiralongkorn's activities in Germany.  </p>

<p>Others have dressed as Harry Potter characters and held up pictures of the series' villain Lord Voldemort, also known as He Who Must Not Be Named.  </p>

<p>A room inside the Alpine hotel where the king's harem is reportedly about to be joined by his former consort </p>

<p>Critics' demands have included the reversal of a 2019 order that transferred two army units to the King's personal command, and a 2017 law that gave him full control of the crown's extensive property holdings. </p>

<p>Estimates of Vajiralongkorn's personal wealth start at $30billion and he has spent much of his time in Europe. </p>

<p>However, the monarchy is backed by the arch-royalist military, which has staged more than a dozen coups since the end of absolutism in 1932. </p>

<p>While the country has been roiled by decades of political turmoil, the constitution says the monarchy must be held 'in a position of revered worship.' </p>

<p>Vajiralongkorn succeeded to the throne in 2016 after the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who had reigned since 1946.  </p>

<p>The new king was not formally crowned until May 2019 when carried on a golden platform in a six-and-a-half-hour procession through Bangkok.   </p>

<p>During the ceremony he was carried on a golden platform in a spectacular six-and-a-half-hour procession through Bangkok's historic quarter. </p>

<p>Just days before the coronation, the King married his long-term consort and gave her the title Queen Suthida, in a surprise move.</p>

<p>Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhya, a former Thai Airways flight attendant, had to lie on the floor as she was given a gift by the king during the marriage ceremony.   </p>
