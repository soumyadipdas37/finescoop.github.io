<p>A German shepherd in China has been forced by its owner to eat a bowl of red chillies during live-stream as a genre of animal binge-eating videos has emerged on Chinese social media</p>

<p>The disturbing new trend became popular on the internet after China cracked down on online eating shows as part of the country’s national campaign to curb food waste</p>

<p>Before President Xi launched an ‘Operation Empty Plate’ campaign against food waste in August, Chinese social media users thoroughly enjoyed watching ‘Chibo’ videos, or Mukbang, a popular online phenomenon originated in South Korea.</p>

<p>Loosely translated as ‘eating broadcast’, the internet craze sees people consuming an excessive amount of food during live-stream while interacting with their audience.</p>

<p>But China has since banned people sharing this type of content, prompting Chinese pet owners to take advantage of the situation by sharing videos of animal overeating a raft of unusual food and snacks.</p>

<p>In one live-streamed clip, a dog owner forced his German shepherd to eat a bowl of La Zi Ji, or Chongqing Chilli Chicken, a regional dish known for its extremely spicy flavours.</p>

<p>The hound can be seen in the video obediently munching on the dish with tears that seemingly triggered by how spicy the food was.</p>

<p>Such content has attracted hundreds of thousands of likes on video-sharing platforms, despite most animals featured in this type of videos do not appear as ‘happy’ as their owners claim</p>

<p>The Chinese owner wrote on the post: ‘He is enjoying it very much,’ referring to the German shepherd.</p>

<p>A separate video shows two dogs being forced to eat 38 different kinds of human snacks and drinks altogether as a 'food challenge'.</p>

<p>Another sees a pet owner forcing popping candy down a husky’s throat while gripping the pet’s mouth to keep it closed.</p>

<p>Such content has attracted hundreds of thousands of likes on Chinese video-sharing platforms such as Douyin and Kuaishou, despite most animals featured in this type of videos do not appear as ‘happy’ as their owners claim, reports say.</p>

<p>But the new online trend has also faced a fierce backlash from horrified animal lovers who urge the authorities to shut down the accounts.</p>

<p>One commenter wrote: ‘This is just a new way of abusing animals. They don’t deserve to keep pets, what a bunch of cold-blooded bastards! Poor animals, they trust their owners unconditionally yet the owners just use them as cash cows.’</p>

<p>Another one said: ‘These people are so sick! They need to be censored immediately!’</p>

<p>A third netizen wrote: ‘Jesus, can’t you see it’s crying? How can you film him eating chillies while watching him cry and in pain?’</p>

<p>The German shepherd's owner has deleted the video after facing widespread criticism online. </p>

<p>He claimed that he knew chillies were bad for the dog but his pet 'really enjoyed eating it', reported Chinese media.</p>
