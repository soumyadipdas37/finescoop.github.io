<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A pair of young bear siblings have been photographed play fighting while their mum's back was turned in Russia.  </p>

<p>Nature photographer Valerio Ferraro, 47, took the snaps in Kurile Lake, Russia, when the little bears began to throw hands in a playful wrestle.</p>

<p>The lake is situated in Kamchatka, a former nuclear submarine outpost, and is abundant in animals due to no one being able to live in the area until the end of the Cold War. </p>

<p>Valerio travelled by helicopter with a small group, finding the group of bears while sitting on a beach, before the cubs adorably began to play while their mum went salmon fishing.</p>

<p>Valerio, from Varese, Italy, said: 'The bears confront each other in this game so that in the future, as adults, they will win the struggle for survival.</p>

<p>'Often they approached, intrigued by our equipment and the life jackets we used on the boat.</p>

<p>'Adult bears often fought because they are not used to socializing during the rest of the year. They are very scary!</p>

<p>'They are just skirmishes, they hardly get hurt. They can only get hurt during the mating season to gain supremacy over a female.</p>

<p>'The bears' mother exploited our presence - male bears often attack cubs and kill them to make females fertile again.</p>

<p>'In this case, our presence kept the males away and the females could leave the cubs close to us to be able to fish and play safely.</p>

<p>'When mum went fishing, the cubs wasted no time playing.'  </p>

<p>Adult bears will often fight due to not fighting during certain seasons. The young bears have play fights to prepare themselves for these later tussles, the photographer said </p>
