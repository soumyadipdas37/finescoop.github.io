<p>On Tuesday night a judge denied Bowman bond and he faces charges including attempted murder for an assault, according to WYFF.</p>

<p>Officials added Bowman had been arrested in the past.</p>

<p>He was recently arrested for allegedly threatening the pastor of a nearby church and cops.</p>

<p>'I used to feed him at my house, he was a good friend of my sons. I’ve known him since he was a child. But he’s mixed up I guess with the wrong crowd. It’s sad. It’s very sad,' Debbie Hood, who knows Bowman, said. </p>

<p>Investigators are now searching for a motive behind the attack. </p>

<p>Fuda was treated at a hospital on Monday afternoon. </p>
