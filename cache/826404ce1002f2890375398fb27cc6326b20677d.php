<p>And, they brought that same sophistication to their end-of-summer themed cover shoot for Cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>The beauties sported complimentary solid colored knit dresses with asymmetrical necklines in camel and black. </p>

<p>Their braided hair was pulled into knotted updos that weren't identical but still reflected the other style beautifully.</p>
