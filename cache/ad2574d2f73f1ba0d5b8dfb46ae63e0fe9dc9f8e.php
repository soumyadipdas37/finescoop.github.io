<p>'My value isn't measured by f***ing kilograms': Australian 90 Day Fiance star Erika Owens has discussed her battle with body dysmorphia</p>

<p>Erika, who also shared a proud snap of herself in pink lingerie while promoting her OnlyFans account, wrote: '⁣⁣It's been a hard week.</p>

<p>'As someone who is generally very confident and relatively positive, a trigger into old negative habits and intense body dysmorphia can truly feel like the end of the world.</p>

<p>'But after a little break, a lot of self-care, hard work and time spent doing what I love surrounded by people I love, I've finally been able to pull myself back together and head back into bad b**** territory.'</p>

<p>The star continued: 'My value isn't measured by f***ing kilograms - it's so much more. It's measured by my passion, my caring nature, talent, creativity, uniqueness and soul.</p>
