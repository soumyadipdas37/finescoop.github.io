<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bernie Sanders has claimed that a 'number of plans' are in place in case Donald Trump loses next month's election and refuses to leave the White House - but would not expand on what they were.</p>

<p>Sanders, who challenged Joe Biden for the Democrat candidacy, dropping out in April, appeared on Bill Maher's show on Friday night.</p>

<p>The Vermont senator was asked about Trump's repeated refusal to promise to accept the result of the November vote.</p>

<p>'If Trump attempts to stay in office after losing, there will be a number of plans out there for make sure he is evicted from office,' Sanders said.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders appeared on Bill Maher's show on Friday night and said there were 'plans'</p>

<p>Maher asked him what the plans were to force Trump from the White House</p>

<p>Maher asked: 'What?'</p>

<p>Sanders ignored him, and said: 'Right now, and for the next five weeks, our job is to defeat him, and defeat him badly.'</p>

<p>Sanders said that 'it was more than a wish' to get him out. </p>

<p>On Thursday night Sanders spoke at George Washington University, and warned that the country was at a perilous moment in history.</p>

<p>'This is not just an election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden,' he said. 'This is an election between Donald Trump and democracy—and democracy must win.'</p>

<p>Sanders told Maher that he was shocked and saddened that he needed to spell out what was at stake. </p>

<p>'Never in a million years did I think I'd have to give a speech about what do we do if a president refuses to leave office,' Sanders told Maher.</p>

<p>'Listen to what Trump is saying. Don't brush it off.'</p>

<p>Donald Trump has repeatedly refused to promise to accept the result of the election</p>

<p>Earlier on Friday evening, Trump was asked again about the possibility of losing to Biden, and insisted he didn't 'want to be cheated' or 'stupid'.</p>

<p>Raising once again the specter of voting fraud, he said: That's the only way we're gonna lose is if there's, uh, mischief — mischief, and it'll have to be on a big scale. So be careful. </p>

<p>'And we do want a very friendly transition. But we don't want to be cheated, and be stupid.'</p>

<p>On Saturday he added: 'This whole thing - I've been telling you, this whole ballot scam is going to cause a lot of problems for our country. </p>

<p>'I want to see a very peaceful transition, but it's got to be a legal process.'</p>
