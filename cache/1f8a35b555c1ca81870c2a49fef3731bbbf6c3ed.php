<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hummingbirds can cool their bodies to less than 4°C (40°F) at night - the lowest temperature recorded in any bird - to save energy for use the daytime, researchers have found. </p>

<p>This rare ability is called torpor, and is a brief hibernation-like state which slashes energy expenditure by 95 per cent in the diminutive birds. </p>

<p>Hummingbirds have wings that beat more than ten times a second and during daylight they use their hovering ability to suck nectar from thousands of flowers.</p>

<p>To keep up, their tiny hearts beat around 1,000 times a minute, but this drops to just 50 during torpor.  </p>

<p>Depending on species, the hummingbirds entered torpor for between two and 13 hours, the researchers write in their study, published in the journal Biology Letters . One species, the black metaltail (pictured), reached the lowest temperature of 3.26°C</p>

<p>The frigid internal temperature at night allows the tiny birds to prepare for the big day ahead. </p>

<p>Researchers from the University of New Mexico looked at 26 hummingbirds from six different species living in the Peruvian Andes. </p>

<p>These birds survive at altitudes of up to 13,000ft (4,000m) and researchers trapped them and inserted a small temperature probe into their rear while they rested. </p>

<p>Researchers recorded the core body temperature throughout the evening and compared that to the outdoor temperature, which could drop as low as 2°C (35F).  </p>

<p>Dexterous hummingbirds can flap their wings up to 5,000 times a minute to create their signature drumming noise.</p>

<p>This skill means that up to 30 per cent of their body weight is made of flight muscle while for most birds it is around just 15 per cent.</p>

<p>This abundance of strength makes them excellent flyers and now researcher have found that even the largest of the hummingbirds are as skilled at flight as the tiniest ones.</p>

<p>The larger birds have evolved differences in muscle power and wing size - along with a touch of skill - to improve their in-flight agility. </p>

<p>Depending on species, the hummingbirds entered torpor for between two and 13 hours, the researchers write in their study, published in the journal Biology Letters. </p>

<p>The species in torpor for the shortest period of time was the giant hummingbird, while the longest was the black metaltail.  </p>

<p>The black metaltail also reached the lowest temperature of all individuals in the study, with academics recording it as low as 3.26°C (37.8F).  </p>

<p>'You'd think they're frozen,' lead author Professor Blair Wolf told New Scientist. 'They feel like a cold rock.' </p>

<p>The birds exit torpor around sunrise and their body temperature soars at a rate of 1°C a minute until they're back to their normal temperature of about 40°C (104F).  </p>

<p>This rapid warming uses lots of energy up, but the amount the birds save outweighs this cost, the researchers say. </p>

<p>By weighing the birds as they slept, the academics also found that the birds which were in torpor for longer lost less weight, therefore indicating they saved more energy. </p>

<p>Torpor is a process used by very few species as it greatly increases the risk of predation. </p>

<p>For the hummingbirds found in the Andes, this is of little concern as there are very few predators at that altitude. </p>

<p>Other animals that employ the daily hibernation strategy include night hawks, lemurs and hamsters.     </p>
