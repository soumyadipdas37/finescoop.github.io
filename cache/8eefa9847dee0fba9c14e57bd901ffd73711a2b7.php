<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Partying Britons have fed an orangutan a can of energy drink and a McDonald's while driving it through the streets of Dubai in horrifying footage slammed by animal rights activists.</p>

<p>The ape was filmed washing down a banana with a can of Monster on Wednesday night by a group of young men, believed to be from Birmingham, who are visiting the UAE. </p>

<p>At one point the little orangutan appeared to reciprocate a fist bump proffered by one of the men, prompting an outburst of shrieks as rap music thumped through the vehicle.</p>

<p>The holidaying Britons have been accused of animal cruelty by viewers and many have cautioned them against feeding a wild animal such a potent caffeinated drink.</p>

<p>The ape was videoed washing down a banana with a can of Monster energy drink as a group of British men, believed to be from Birmingham, drove him through the streets of Dubai</p>

<p>The little orangutan being led into the back of the Mercedes in Dubai earlier this week</p>

<p>The orangutan polished off the sugary drink before sitting on the back seat as rap music thumped through the vehicle</p>

<p>The footage was uploaded by a Birmingham-based man identified only as Abdi who has been enjoying a lavish holiday in Dubai</p>

<p>One tweeted: 'He gone bite all they fingers off the moment they go to sleep. Leave these animals alone!!'</p>

<p>Another conceded: 'This ain't right but it's funny af'</p>

<p>Others cautioned against giving a wild animal an energy drink</p>

<p>One tweeted: 'He gone bite all they fingers off the moment they go to sleep. Leave these animals alone!!' </p>

<p>Another said: 'This ain't right but it's funny.'</p>

<p>Indeed, most viewers did choose to see the funny side of the footage, while others seemed to think it was worthy of respect, 'this the biggest flex this year,' said one. </p>

<p>Orangutans are generally the most sedate of the apes and in this case fortunately, the animal does not appear to have been agitated.</p>

<p>However, zoo keepers would warn against joking around with a full-sized orangutan because, leaving aside any ethical considerations, they are incredibly strong and have been known to bite.  </p>

<p>The footage was uploaded by a Birmingham-based man identified only as Abdi who has been enjoying a lavish holiday in Dubai.</p>

<p>His Instagram account reveals that he flew out from Heathrow in First Class just four days ago and has been staying at the five-star Five Palm Jumeirah hotel.</p>

<p>Another perspective was offered by this Instagram user who said it was better than being locked in a cage</p>

<p>Most viewers did choose to see the funny side of the footage, while others seemed to think it was worthy of respect, 'this the biggest flex this year,' said one</p>

<p>Abdi and his entourage have been renting luxurious cars including Fearraris and Lamborghinis, as well as getting up close with exotic animals such as tiger and leopard cubs.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates' liberal attitudes to the ownership of exotic animals has drawn criticism in the past.</p>

<p>The Middle Eastern country outlawed private ownership in 2017, although it is unclear if the Britons were given the animals by a licensed keeper.</p>
