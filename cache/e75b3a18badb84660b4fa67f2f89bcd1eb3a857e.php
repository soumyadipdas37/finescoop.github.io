<p>Mr Winter began the conversation, saying: 'Hi how are you?'</p>

<p>Gilmore did not recongise him at first and responded saying 'great, thank you'.</p>

<p>Mr Winter then mentioned 'catching up later'. Gilmore said they would not be and went to leave. </p>

<p>Mr Winter then allegedly said: 'We are going to catch up later, aren't we?'</p>

<p>Gilmore said no and walked away. She later told police she was left feeling unsafe.</p>

<p>Mr Winter, who lives in Glenreagh, northwest of Coffs Harbour, was allegedly found by police at midday about 50m from the car park of the event.</p>

<p>The seven-time world champion (pictured in September last year) was competing at the Tweed Coast Pro at Cabarita in northern NSW on Sunday when Squires Winter allegedly went to speak with her</p>

<p>Gilmore was left shaken by the encounter and informed police of the interaction shortly after her heat</p>

<p>He told police he understood the protection order prevented him from approaching Gilmore. </p>

<p>Mr Winter appeared in Tweed Heads Local Court via audio-video link on Tuesday where he pleaded not guilty to contravening  a protection order.</p>

<p>Police prosecutor Sergeant Chris Martin said Mr Winter's story 'did not make any sense' as he knew he would not be able to cross the border due to coronavirus restrictions. </p>

<p>During the bail application hearing, Sgt martin said there were extreme concerns for Gilmore's welfare and Mr Winter had a long history of violence. </p>

<p>Mr Winter was denied bail, with Magistrate Geoff Dunley citing his long history of violence, and previous breaches of AVOs. </p>

<p>His decision to deny bail was also due to Mr Winter travelling a lengthy distance  to breach the order, which he found indicated 'fixated behaviour and some degree of planning'. </p>
