<p>Hitting back! Paris Hilton took a swipe at her ex-boyfriend Aleks Novakovic this week, implying that he's not worthy enough to be given the title of being one of her ex-boyfriends </p>

<p>Drama: Paris and Aleks clashed in an explosive fight that was featured in her new documentary</p>

<p>'You could see [Novakovic] really pushes her to the edge and Paris really puts down a boundary for the first time,' Alexandra told Too Fab.</p>

<p>In the exchange, which took place at EDM festival Tomorrowland, the socialite, 39, and Aleks butted heads just prior to her set.</p>

<p>After he griped to the Stars Are Blind singer that she'd repeatedly left him by himself at the event, she lost her patience after he carelessly dropped a computer of her's that was essential to her performance. </p>

<p>Clash: In the exchange, which took place at EDM festival Tomorrowland, the socialite, 39, and Aleks butted heads just prior to her DJ set</p>

<p>'You can't just drop a computer before a set!' she snapped. 'The computer could break. Will someone who's not gonna drop it, take it?'</p>

<p>Paris was especially upset with the timing of her beau's outburst, asking others to keep him at a distance as she mentally readied herself for the set in front of 80,000 festival attendees.</p>

<p>'Can you tell him to chill the f*** out?' she said. 'This is f<strong><em>ed up. I'm playing Tomorrowland. He needs to chill the f</em></strong> out. I'm sick of this s***. I'm playing in six minutes.'</p>

<p>'You can't just drop a computer before a set!' she snapped. 'The computer could break. Will someone who's not gonna drop it, take it?'</p>

<p>She said that Aleks was 'so insecure,' eventually removing his access bracelet from his wrist and having venue security throw him out of the area.</p>

<p>The director said of the fight, 'I think everyone feels what I feel watching it, which is, yeah, finally, put down a boundary, be yourself. Respect your own boundaries, you know?'</p>

<p>'She clearly isn't doing that for any cameras, she's really struggling and she's letting that struggle unfold on camera. That was when we had been filming for a really long time and the cameras had become invisible.'</p>
