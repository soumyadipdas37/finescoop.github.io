<p>Masks, particularly surgical and cloth ones worn by the bulk of the population, are not perfect and allow some viral particles to slip through into wearer's airways.</p>

<p>Experts say repeatedly exposing people to small amounts of Covid-19 could help to train the body to recognise and fight it off, effectively immunising them.</p>

<p>The unproven theory was detailed by scientists from the University of California in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>

<p>It is unlikely the hypothesis will be proven beyond doubt because that would require exposing people with and without masks to the virus in clinical trials, which would be unethical.</p>

<p>But the theory may partly explain why fewer people are dying or falling critical ill with the coronavirus.</p>

<p>The scientists behind the commentary have stressed that people should not get complacent or purposefully put themselves in harm's way of Covid.</p>

<p>The mass-use of face masks may be acting as a de facto 'vaccine' against coronavirus, scientists have claimed (file)</p>

<p>'This is not the recommendation at all,' they wrote, urging people to still keep socially distanced from others and avoid cramped indoor spaces with little ventilation.</p>

<p>The idea that masks may offer some immunity against Covid-19 hinges on the theory of variolation, a centuries-old immunisation technique.</p>

<p>Variolation is the practice of deliberately infecting people with low doses of a pathogen to generate a protective immune response that prevents reinfection.</p>

<p>The controversial technique was used throughout history to immunise people against smallpox but was eventually replaced by modern vaccines which use weakened forms of virus to make them much safer.</p>

<p>Unversity of California experts Dr Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician, and epidemiologist Professor George Rutherford believe face masks may be working the same way as variolation.</p>

<p>Dr Gandhi, writing in the paper, said: 'You can have this virus but be asymptomatic. So if you can drive up rates of asymptomatic infection with masks, maybe that becomes a way to variolate the population.'</p>

<p>However, critics have dismissed the theory which they warn could be dangerous if the public get too complacent and take unnecessary risks.</p>

<p>Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist based in Arizona who was not involved in the commentary, told Yahoo News: 'It seems like a leap. We don't have a lot to support it.' </p>

<p>'We still want people to follow all the other prevention strategies. That means staying vigilant about avoiding crowds, physical distancing and hand hygiene — behaviors that overlap in their effects, but can't replace one another.'</p>
