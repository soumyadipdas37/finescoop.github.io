<p>The latest: James Corden, 42, did The Late Late Show from quarantine on Monday after coming into contact with person who tested positive for the coronavirus</p>

<p>The U.K.-born funnyman had his presence on set via a TV that was placed on a desk in his Los Angeles-based studio.</p>

<p>Insiders told Deadline that the person who the TV shot crossed paths with was not involved with his CBS show.</p>

<p>'And it’s a shame, because I thought like we were really getting into a rhythm in the studio,' said Corden, whose crew and band remained working from the studio. 'But the show must go on, and we are here and we are so happy that you’re watching.'</p>

<p>He joked with one of his staff, 'I think there's a very real chance by the end of this week you'll just be hosting the show.' </p>
