<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Finding Freedom author Omid Scobie has revealed he is filming with Netflix days after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex signed a $150million megadeal with the media giant.</p>

<p>Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle, 39, who recently bought a $14million mansion in Santa Barbara, announced a new deal with the streaming service last week, and said they wanted to provide 'hope and inspiration' with their upcoming projects.</p>

<p>Omid shared a snap on his Instagram page yesterday revealing he was 'shooting a little something with Netflix', although he did not reveal what the project would be. It is not known whether the project is linked to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. </p>

<p>Royal editor Omid wrote the controversial biography Finding Freedom which  raised eyebrows for its gushing praise and intimate knowledge of the Duke and the Duchess - but the couple claimed they were not interviewed and did not contribute to the book.</p>

<p>The biographer shared a snap as he said he was 'shooting a little something for Netflix' yesterday</p>

<p>His move to work with the media giant comes days after a royal source claimed Meghan and Prince Harry failed to tell the Queen, 94, about their Netflix deal, which could be worth as much as $150million, before announcing it to the world.</p>

<p>Her Majesty had to be told by her aides about the couple's new venture - which involves a yet-to-be-named production company set on making documentaries, feature films and children's programming.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Harry did not inform the Queen about the Netflix deal.'</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have never produced a TV show, will make documentaries, films, scripted and kids’ programmes in the new partnership.</p>

<p>'Her Majesty is all too aware of the pitfalls of when senior royals embark on lucrative projects - Prince Edwards’ production flop and some of the deals Sarah Ferguson has signed over the years to name a few,' the source told Fabulous.</p>

<p>'Her view is simple, the Royals are not for sale and danger surrounds high profile roles outside of the institution itself.'</p>

<p>Finding Freedom author Omid Scobie has revealed he is filming with Netflix days after Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle, 39, announced their $150million deal with the media giant</p>

<p>They added, however, that the Queen, 'knowing her grandson Harry as she does', will appreciate that the duke and duchess can not be talked out of their plans. </p>

<p>Harry and Meghan said last week they had founded a production company to make documentaries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programmes.</p>

<p>They vowed to make 'impactful content that unlocks action' and name-checked Netflix chief executive Ted Sarandos and spoke of the firm's 'unprecedented reach'.</p>

<p>They are expected to make content which includes work on 'mental health', an animated series about women, a nature documentary and shows on community service. </p>

<p>The biography (pictured) offers a window into Meghan and Harry's lives during their time as senior royals, and is full of details on their shock exit from the royal family</p>

<p>However, royal officials 'will examine Harry and Meghan's Netflix deal' after they agreed to approval of any new commercial ventures when they quit public life, according to a source.</p>

<p>A palace insider claimed that despite ditching official duties any profit-oriented plans would be 'subject to discussion'.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan got the green light to broker commercial deals in January - but the moneymaking projects will be scrutinised by the Queen after a year.</p>

<p>The historic agreement ruled the couple will drop their HRH titles, pay back £2.4million of taxpayer cash and no longer receive public funds.</p>

<p>In exchange, they were allowed to quit frontline duties and given licence to expand their brand.</p>

<p>Omid's book Finding Freedom was declared a bestseller with 31,000 copies sold in the UK in the first five days of its release, according to figures from data provider Nielsen Book. </p>

<p>The biography offers a window into Meghan and Harry's lives during their time as senior royals, and is full of details on their shock exit from the royal family.</p>

<p>It addresses the alleged rift between brothers Harry and William, as well as the relationship between their wives.</p>

<p>Scobie said that while they did not interview the couple, 'many' friends gave them insights - providing 'a lens to the couple through their friends and their circle of aides'.</p>

<p>Royal expert Katie Nicholl said the authors may be the 'only winners' from the publication of Finding Freedom.</p>

<p>Writing in Vanity Fair, she asked if the book was 'worth it for Harry and Meghan' before adding: 'The irony of Finding Freedom is that, locked down in their rented mansion in LA, the Sussexes have less freedom than they did when they lived in Windsor.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile she added that the book's authors write that the monarchy had lost two of its greatest assets.</p>

<p>She concluded: 'They, perhaps, might be the only winners in this rather sad story.'    </p>
