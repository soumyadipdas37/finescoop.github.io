<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An excited dog proved that it wasn't quite ready to go to bed just yet by running laps around its owner's bedroom in the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Santana the whippet was filmed by its owner racing around a bedroom at her home in Melbourne at 1am.</p>

<p>At the start of the footage, Santana is seen leaping onto her owner's bed and running across it.</p>

<p>Santana the bouncy whippet races around her owner's bedroom in Melbourne at 1am in the morning in a sudden explosion of energy, or a Zoomie</p>

<p>With the sound of clattering paws, she then completes a circle around the bed and hops on from the side once again before stopping dead and staring at her owner.</p>

<p>Not quite tired out yet, Santana leaps off the bed and races towards the bedroom door before spinning round and launching herself at her weary owner once again.</p>

<p>Clearly in no mood for stopping anymore, Santana starts running laps of the room, using the bed as a hurdle to be jumped over, with little regard for her owner who is trying to fall asleep.</p>

<p>The video of Santana was posted alongside the caption: 'I just want to sleep.' </p>

<p>Speaking about the video of her dog, Santana's owner said: 'My cute dog being her usual hilarious quirky self. Her name is Santana and she's an energetic little whippet.' </p>

<p>Santana runs circles around the room before hopping on and off of the bed, using it as a hurdle for her mad dash before stopping in front of her owner</p>

<p>The act of a dog frantically running around is known as a Dog Zoomie or a Frenetic Random Activity Periods (Frap).</p>

<p>The Zoomies are caused by an buildup of excess energy in the dog which they then release all in one mad burst.</p>

<p>The burst of energy often features frantic, repetitive behavior such as running in circles or spinning around. </p>

<p>It's not uncommon for the Zoomies to take place at specific times of the day such as early in the morning or late at night. </p>

<p>Although originally the footage was posted on August 21, it recently re-emerged after being shared on social media.</p>
