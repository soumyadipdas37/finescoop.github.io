<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australians are fast moving to cashless currency, but those still using coins have the added advantage of potentially hitting the jackpot with their spare change. </p>

<p>While some may be hard to spot, coins with small minting mistakes - known as 'mules' by collectors - can easily fetch thousands of dollars. </p>

<p>A rare $1 Australian coin with a minting error was recently put up for auction for $4,000 with other even-rarer 'mules' being worth tens of thousands. </p>

<p>While the mistake on the $1 coin might be missed at first glance, the error is obvious when pointed out - the head side was stamped with a 10c piece mold resulting in a double-edge </p>

<p>Mr Jobson (pictured), who runs a Sydney coin and collectables store, also has a 'mule' 5c piece which was struck in 2007 with the Queen's likeness on both sides instead of the echidna </p>

<p>While the mistake on the $1 coin might be missed at first glance, the error is obvious when pointed out - the heads side was stamped with a 10c piece mold resulting in a double-edge. </p>

<p>The Australian Coin Collecting Blog estimates there would be about 6,000 of these coins in circulation, with the majority ending up in Perth. </p>

<p>People from across the globe try to outbid each other in an effort to add the item to their collections which drives the price up.  </p>

<p>'Value depends on the quality - so if they are really high quality, then they're going to be very valuable and worth $4,000 or $5,000,' coin expert David Jobson told The Morning Show. </p>

<p>Mr Jobson, who runs a Sydney coin and collectables store, also has a 'mule' 5c piece which was struck in 2007 with the Queen's likeness on both sides instead of the iconic echidna. </p>

<p>'It's quite a striking error, they're a lot easier to notice in your change. Value-wise, it starts off at about $1,000 - and it goes up to about $4,000 for really nice ones.' he said. </p>

<p>Mr Jobson also recently sold a 20c piece with another standout error that resulted in the edges being shaped in a 'scalloped' pattern. </p>

<p>A 5c piece that has been struck twice resulting in an overlapping imprint of the echidna on one side and the Queen on the other has an even bigger $55,000 price tag on eBay </p>

<p>Mr Jobson also recently sold a 20c piece with another standout error that resulted in the edges being shaped in a 'scalloped' pattern (pictured) </p>

<p>He explains in 1981 the Royal Mint in London produced the 20c coins and also the Hong Kong $2 coins - with an employee mixed up the two molds resulting in the hybrid item. </p>

<p>'It's very valuable. There are less than 10 that are known to exist, and they value anywhere between $15,000 and $20,000.' he said. </p>

<p>A 2001 10c coin printed on a bi-metallic silver and gold coloured base can fetch up to $32,000. </p>

<p>A 5c piece that has been struck twice resulting in an overlapping imprint of the echidna on one side and the Queen on the other has an even bigger $55,000 price tag.  </p>

<p>Mr Jobson warned, however, that anyone who is looking to purchase rare coins should have their authenticity independently verified by a third party and make sure the seller is reputable. </p>

<p>He also said that not all these rare mistake coins had been snapped up by collectors with many still able to be found in circulation such as the $1 and 5c pieces which were brought into his store after someone found them in their pockets. </p>

<p>He advised anybody who thinks they have found one of the mistake coins to take a quick picture and email a coin dealer who will be able to verify the item. </p>
