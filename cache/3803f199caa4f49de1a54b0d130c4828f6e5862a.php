<p>But Nina Dobrev looked business-ready in a black blazer worn over matching ensemble on Monday, when she was spotted on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, headed to the Louis Vuitton store.</p>

<p>The Degrassi: The Next Generation star, 31, was chic in her outfit, which consisted of a black top and leggings underneath the jacket. </p>

<p>Ready for the day: Nina Dobrev looked business-ready in a black blazer worn over matching ensemble on Monday, when she was spotted on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills</p>

<p>The Vampire Diaries star also wore a standard white surgical face mask, and large rounded sunglasses.</p>

<p>Her brown hair was up in a casual top bun and her red manicure was visible as she held her smart phone.</p>

<p>Last week, Dobrev returned from a vacation to Mexico, where she was snapped frolicking on the beach with her Olympic Gold Medalist boyfriend Shaun White.</p>

<p>While the pair have been dating for some months now, they've been relatively low-key on each other's social media. </p>

<p>In February of this year, the pair began to spark dating rumors when they each shared similar photos from South Africa, but did not pose together.</p>

<p>Dreamy vacay: Last week, Dobrev returned from a vacation to Mexico, where she was snapped with her boyfriend Shaun White</p>

<p>Then, close to the beginning of lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, they finally appeared together on social media when Nina gave Shaun a quarantine haircut.</p>

<p>But apart from that, and aside from occasional shots like Shaun's gallery of poolside snaps with Nina at the beginning of August, the couple prefer to remain largely on the down low.</p>

<p>Case in point – the pair did not post photos of each other to their Instagram feeds at all during their Mexican getaway, which looked to cover Tulum as well as Cabo San Lucas. </p>

<p>Rare moment: Aside from occasional snaps like Shaun's gallery of poolside shots with Nina at the beginning of August, the couple prefer to remain largely on the down low</p>

<p>That changed, however, when Nina celebrated Shaun's 34th birthday on her own Instagram account last week.</p>

<p>The actress poked fun at her star athlete beau, sharing a very candid snapshot of the pair together along with a jokey caption dedicated to 'the most untalented, humorless, least althletic [sic], least coordinated, least gifted and least favorite person.'</p>

<p>'Happy birthday <?php echo e('@'); ?>shaunwhite,' she went on, continuing the gag by telling the world record holder: 'Hang in there. one day you will accomplish something. #dontgiveup.' </p>

<p>Cute post: That changed, however, when Nina celebrated Shaun's 34th birthday on her own Instagram account last week</p>

<p>The artsy photo, which looked like it was shot on film, showed the couple in a silly moment. Shaun hid one eye behind a water bottle while Nina stuck her tongue out.</p>

<p>Later she shared a quick snapshot to her Instagram Story that had just a quick 'HBD' up top.</p>

<p>It's clear that the pair are enjoying their time together.</p>
