<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Efe Obada has been waived by the Carolina Panthers, the day after he made the 53-man roster.</p>

<p>The Nigerian-born defensive end is a fan-favourite and was praised by new head coach Matt Rhule in training camp after gaining 10lbs.</p>

<p>The Panthers were the first team in the NFL to announce their final 53-man roster on Saturday.</p>

<p>Efe Obada has been waived by the Carolina Panthers just a day after being named in the roster</p>

<p>The fan favourite defensive end saw the funny side after his selection was short lived</p>

<p>Obada tweeted on Sunday: 'Want to say thank you everyone you all show me so much love I really appreciate it. Grateful to make the 53 again and be able to provide for my family especially now. Honestly this is longest in my whole life that I’ve stayed in one place and just for that I’m grateful.'</p>

<p>However, the 28-year-old was one of three players waived on Sunday to make room for three players claimed off waivers.</p>

<p>Quoting his original tweet, written four hours before, he added: 'Well that didn’t age well did it', followed by emojis of a laughing face and a broken heart.</p>

<p>He was picked after being praised by new head coach Matt Rhule (pictured) in training camp</p>

<p>Obada has one of the more incredible stories in sport. He grew up in Nigeria, was trafficked to England via Holland aged 10 and spent time on the streets of London looking after his sister.</p>

<p>By chance, he started playing American football with the London Monarchs and after five games was flown out to Dallas to work out with the Cowboys. After stints with the Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Falcons, Obada joined the Panthers in 2018 after a successful spell on the NFL's International Pathway Programme.</p>

<p>Former head coach Ron Rivera handed Obada his debut in week three of the 2018 season against thew Cincinnati Bengals. Obada came away with a sack, an interception and a game ball. He was also named the NFC's defensive player of the week.</p>

<p>The 6ft 6in former London Warriors star will likely be taken on by another franchise soon</p>

<p>Last season, he featured in the Panthers' 37-26 victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last October.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that Obada will be without a team for long.</p>

<p>The 6ft 6in lineman can play across the defensive front and his versatility, athleticism, size and attitude - he lives by a first-in, last-out mantra - will likely see him picked up by another franchise.</p>

<p>If he isn't, don't rule out a return to the Panthers' practice squad.</p>
