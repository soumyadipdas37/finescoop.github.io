<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump has once again raised claims of a possible 'rigged' election in 2020 – by citing a report predicting that he might hold an overwhelming Electoral College lead on election night that would later evaporate.</p>

<p>'Rigged Election?' Trump wrote Tuesday, retweeting a report about once scenario about how the votes could come in, particularly given partisan splits that have developed over who is requesting mail-in ballots versus who plans to vote by mail.</p>

<p>The growing disparity in how American cast ballots could lead to the illusion on Nov. 3rd that Trump has one a 'landslide' that would soon be overwhelmed.  </p>

<p>Trump retweeted a post by Rahseem Kassam, who co-hosts a podcast with former top White House and Trump campaign advisor Steve Bannon, that posited Trump could appear to hold an election night victory that would turn out to be a 'mirage.'</p>

<p>The report cited a report in Axios about predications by Hawkfish, a data analytics firm backed by billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Trump's lead on Nov. 3 might appear overwhelming, with millions of mail and absentee ballots still to be counted. </p>

<p>'When every legitimate vote is tallied and we get to that final day, which will be some day after Election Day, it will in fact show that what happened on election night was ... a mirage,' said Hawkfish CEO Josh Mendelsohn.</p>

<p>Michael Wilusz takes the mail-in ballots of Williamstown, Mass., residents and inserts them into the voting machine at an elementary school on Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2020, during the state's primary election</p>

<p>Voters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts turned out in record numbers with absentee ballots as well as in person during early vote and on Primary Day. This election worker is time stamping each ballot to indicate when it was received for processing. Absentee ballot requests are overwhelmingly coming from Democrats</p>

<p> ''The news media should get out of the business of predicting the future,' said Trump campaign chair Tim Murtagh in the original report.</p>

<p>Trump also warned about a potentially 'rigged' election in 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton was the favorite.</p>

<p>This year, he has repeatedly accused Democrats of trying to 'steal' the election. In 2018, when allies Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, both Republicans, held narrow election night wins only to see Democrats gain, Trump called mail ballot vote that continued coming in 'infected.'</p>

<p>“An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!” Trump tweeted – in what critics saw as a potential dry-run for a 2020 play.</p>

<p>More than 4 million Floridians requested a mail ballot for this year's primaries, compared to 1.3 million in 2016.</p>

<p>An analysis in North Carolina last month found Democrats requested 53 per cent of the absentee ballots requested, compared to just 15 per cent from GOP voters.</p>

<p>Hawkfish concludes that 40 per cent of Americans plan to vote by mail. </p>

<p>Mendelsohn told Axios that on election night results would show Trump 'in a stronger position than the reality actually is.'</p>

<p>The data could show an 'incredible victory' for Trump – but that he 'fundamentally was not' when 'every ballot gets counted.' </p>

<p>Data compiled Hawkfish firm show many more Democrats plan to vote by mail than Republicans. With double the number planning to cast votes by mail than ever before.  </p>
