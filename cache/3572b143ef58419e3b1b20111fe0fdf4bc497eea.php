<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has urged the club to make signings or risk falling behind their Premier League rivals.</p>

<p>United opened their Premier League campaign with a dismal showing in their 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>

<p>The club have made just one signing in the close season with Donny van de Beek arriving from Ajax, while a move for Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho has stalled.</p>

<p>Manchester United defender Luke Shaw says the club must buy players or fall behind rivals</p>

<p>United were beaten 3-1 by Crystal Palace having failed to land most of their key targets</p>

<p>Shaw says United have a 'good group' but suggested they currently lack depth to challenge</p>

<p>United have also been chasing another left-back to deputise for Shaw but missed out on Real Madrid defender Sergio Reguilon after he joined Tottenham on a five-year deal on Saturday. </p>

<p>'We have a very good group but, personally, I think we need more players to strengthen the squad,' Shaw said.</p>

<p>'When you look around at how other teams are strengthening their teams, then we must also do it to keep up with the others.'</p>

<p>While United have failed to add their key targets in the transfer window, their rivals have added quality and numbers to already stellar squads. </p>

<p>Donny van de Beek is United's sole summer signing and came off the bench to score</p>

<p>Manchester United chief executive, Ed Woodward, could now be forced to splash the cash</p>

<p>Last week, Liverpool signed Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich and Diogo Jota from Wolves, while Chelsea have spent in the region of £200 million on a host of young European talent. </p>

<p>Shaw, 25, says United must now start to build momentum with a victory over Luton Town in the League Cup on Tuesday. </p>

<p>'A lot of things were said after the game and we need to put it to bed. We need to be very disappointed because we should be, but forget about it and move on. We've got a big game on Tuesday, we need to win that and pick up momentum.' </p>
