<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>At least seven schools in England have sent pupils home to self-isolate due to students catching coronavirus within days of the start of term. </p>

<p>Primary and secondary schools in Greater Manchester, Yorkshire, Leicestershire, Lancashire and Buckinghamshire have all been stricken by the virus - seven sending pupils home and another delaying the start of term.  </p>

<p>Notable among them is Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow, Bucks, which delayed yesterday's start of term after 20 pupils tested positive for Covid-19 after returning from a party holiday to the Greek island of Zante.   </p>

<p>One of the grammar school's pupils caused outrage last night after a TikTok video emerged of him joking about the group's lack of social distancing and mask wearing on the trip.</p>

<p>Today it emerged that another seven schools – which unlike Sir William Borlase's had already started term – have asked pupils to go home, some after just hours back in the classroom.</p>

<p>Among them, the King David High School in Crumspall, Greater Manchester, which has spent £21,000 on implementing the requisite provisions and technology to allow for social distancing and self-isolating.</p>

<p>The secondary school resumed teaching for sixth-formers and the new Year 7 intake last Friday.</p>

<p>But one of the older pupils began feeling unwell and developed a temperature that very evening and he tested positive on Sunday.</p>

<p>Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was set to welcome back pupils on Wednesday but will now return on September 10</p>

<p>Three pupils who were within two metres of the boy are now having to self-isolate for 14 days.</p>

<p>Dixons Trinity Academy, a middle school, and Dixons King's Academy, the secondary school, in Bradford have asked some pupils and staff to self-isolate, The Daily Mirror reported.</p>

<p>It comes after two members of staff and one pupil tested positive for the virus since the academies restarted last Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Ridgeway Primary Academy in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, went back last Friday but it was discovered over the weekend that one pupil aged between five and seven had tested positive for the virus.</p>

<p>As a result that pupil has been asked to self-isolate for 10 days and several others who came into close contact with the child have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days.</p>

<p>An unnamed school in Whitworth, Lancashire, was also said to have sent pupils back home to self-isolate on Thursday.</p>

<p>Councillor Alyson Barnes told the local paper: 'Parents of all local children concerned have been notified and will be self-isolating and seeking a test.'</p>

<p>A second school in Buckinghamshire, the Chesham Grammar School, which only went back to class today has also sent some of its pupils home to self-isolate.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether this outbreak is related to Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Buckinghamshire, from which the Zante group were returning to.</p>
