<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Callum Wilson has completed his £20million move to Newcastle United from Bournemouth and will take the No 9 jersey.</p>

<p>The striker finalised the terms of a four-year deal on Monday morning and will now meet his new team-mates ahead of Saturday's Premier League opener at West Ham.</p>

<p>His former Cherries team-mate Ryan Fraser is also expected to be unveiled as a Newcastle player on Monday afternoon, joining on a free transfer. </p>

<p>Newcastle has completed the £20million signing of Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson</p>

<p>Steve Bruce has landed his main attacking target in the 28-year-old forward Wilson</p>

<p>Wilson replaces Joelinton as the club's No 9 after the Brazilian - a £40m club-record buy last summer - scored just twice in the Premier League during his debut season.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old said: 'From the minute I knew that Newcastle were interested, it was definitely something that appealed to me.</p>

<p>'It's a massive club with great history. Along the years, they've had great strikers so if I can emulate half of what they've done, I'd like to attempt that.</p>

<p>'I believe in my ability as a player. As a striker I think it's important to set yourself goals long term and short term, and I'm hoping to achieve them.</p>

<p>'With the players around me, I believe we can get the goals we need as team and I want to help contribute to that.'  </p>

<p>Dwight Gayle is unlikely to be fit again until December after sustaining a knee injury</p>

<p>Wilson scored seven times for Bournemouth last season but could not halt their relegation</p>

<p>Head coach Steve Bruce said: 'Callum is somebody I’ve admired for a long time and I’m delighted to get him.</p>

<p>'He has done fantastically well at Bournemouth and was deservedly playing centre forward for England less than two years ago.</p>

<p>'The club has worked ever so hard to get Callum here and we have beaten off competition from a number of clubs.</p>

<p>'I’m grateful the club has made it happen. Lee Charnley and those behind the scenes deserve a lot of credit.'</p>
