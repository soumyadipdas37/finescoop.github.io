<p>Out and about: Ariel Winter was glimpsed looking California casual as she swung by a car wash this Friday in Los Angeles</p>

<p>The Modern Family alumna revealed on her Insta Stories recently that she is auctioning off a Zoom chat with herself in aid of rescued dogs.</p>

<p>Name-checking her own pooches she wrote: 'Join me and Casper, Chloe, Cash &amp; Cleo in supporting our rescue pups by participating in the <?php echo e('@'); ?>wagsandwalks auction! Help them raise critical funds for dogs in need by bidding on a virtual meet and greet with me now through September 10th!'</p>

<p>The Mr. Peabody And Sherman actress concluded her message: 'Visit CharityBuzz.com and search "Wags and Walks" under charities!'</p>

<p>Amid the coronavirus lockdowns Ariel has been hunkering down with her dashing 25-year-old boyfriend Luke Benward. </p>

<p>Off she goes: The 22-year-old slipped into some busty skintight black workout gear for her latest outing, slinging on a sleek white handbag</p>

<p>Early this May Ariel revealed that she accidentally sliced off the tip of her left thumb while making Greek food.</p>

<p>She dished that when she was in the hospital she was handed a bag without being told her thumb tip was inside.</p>

<p>As a result she tossed the bag into the garbage and was forced to go back and retrieve it, the Modern Family star dished on Access.</p>

<p>Careful: She sported pink hair on her outing and made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as she emerged from lockdown</p>

<p>Before she took up with her current smoldering hunk Ariel spent years dating little-known actor Levi Meaden, 32.</p>

<p>She told Refinery29 in 2017 of her romance with Levi, with its dramatic age gap: 'I'm happy, and whatever people want to say, they can say.'</p>

<p>Ariel, whose figure had drawn its share of online trolling, said: 'He's always complimenting me and making me feel special and beautiful.'</p>
