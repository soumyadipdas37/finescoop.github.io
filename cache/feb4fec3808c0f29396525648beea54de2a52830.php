<p>In the snapshot, the 35-year-old pop star only had on a nude breast pumping harness and a pair of grey high-waisted underwear as she posed in her bathroom mirror, five days after giving birth.</p>

<p>Making the best of it: Katy Perry put her own hilarious spin on the MTV VMA's famous step-and-repeat, while displaying her post-baby body on Instagram</p>

<p>'Hair and makeup by: <?php echo e('@'); ?>exhaustion,' captioned Perry jokingly, while also tagging the makers of her harness and underwear.</p>

<p>The Teenage Dream singer's hair was styled into a messy low ponytail as she prepared to pump for her newborn daughter Daisy Dove,</p>

<p>Katy's skin looked enviably clear and the tired singer stood with one arm out to her side as she confidently displayed her post-baby body.</p>

<p>'I really understand what Justin Timberlake said about, 'You're my mirror,' because it's true. They bring up all this stuff you can't really see about yourself,' she explained. </p>
