<p>A London station cleaner who spiked her supervisor's coffee with cleaning fluid as an act of 'revenge' after she was given a telling off has been jailed for 10 months.</p>

<p>Fenchurch Street station cleaner Aurora Iacomi, 32, poured the liquid into her manager Angelina Raychinova's flask at the central London station on April 22. </p>

<p>A court heard how Iacomi tried to justify her actions as a 'prank', intended to annoy her victim, who had left her feeling 'humiliated' through a telling off at work.</p>

<p>But at a sentencing hearing at Inner London Crown Court, Judge Benedict Kelleher said Iacomi, of Redbridge, east London, was motivated by 'revenge'. </p>

<p>Judge Kelleher also said she had not taken care to know the level of risk her actions entailed.</p>

<p>He sentenced Iacomi, a university graduate originally from Romania who had no previous convictions, to 10-months in prison. </p>

<p>Prosecutor Philip Allman told the court that there had been a 'history of work-related tension' between Iacomi and her colleague in the build up to the incident.</p>

<p>He explained that between 3.20pm and 4pm on the day of the incident, Ms Raychinova had left her flask in the cleaners' compound within the station. </p>

<p>'When she returned, she took a sip from the coffee flask, immediately felt a burning sensation on her lips and spat out the contents,' Mr Allman said.</p>

<p>Ms Raychinova said she 'smelt cleaning fluid' that was used to remove chewing gum from floors, the court heard.</p>

<p>Mr Allman also said Ms Raychinova had 'previous issues with one colleague, this defendant'.</p>

<p>Police examined CCTV footage, searched lockers and examined the coffee flask and its contents.</p>

<p>A court heard how Iacomi tried to justify her actions as a 'prank', intended to annoy her victim, who had left her feeling 'humiliated' through a telling off at work. But at a sentencing hearing at Inner London Crown Court, Judge Benedict Kelleher said Iacomi was motivated by 'revenge'</p>

<p>Samples were also taken from a bottle of cleaning fluid, Mr Allman explained.</p>

<p>He said the CCTV showed 'this defendant entering the cleaners' compound during the time that the flask was left unattended'.</p>

<p>'On the CCTV, she could be seen holding a plastic bottle and moving it towards where the coffee flask was.'</p>

<p>Iacomi, originally from Romania, told police she was 'having trouble' with Ms Raychinova and had been subject to an internal disciplinary hearing at her company.</p>

<p>Ms Raychinova supervised Iacomi's work at the station but worked for a different company.</p>

<p>'She explained that she was not very fond of Ms Raychinova,' Mr Allman said.</p>

<p>He told the court that Iacomi had initially admitted to police entering the compound that afternoon but denied putting anything in the coffee, despite later pleading guilty to the offence.</p>

<p>Mr Allman said the substance dropped into the drink was Graffi Green, which was 'cleaning liquid to remove graffiti'.</p>

<p>He told the court that Iacomi had received training on hazardous substances and the 'danger or hazard that attaches to them'.</p>

<p>Flavia Kenyon, mitigating, said Iacomi was from a 'law-abiding, decent, hard-working family in Romania' and a university graduate.</p>

<p>'She found herself on that afternoon acting out of impulse,' Ms Kenyon said.</p>

<p>'This is not a premediated act, it's not as if she put herself with that bottle at home to go to work with the intent to cause the victim harm.'</p>

<p>Ms Kenyon added: 'It was a prank. Thoughtless? Yes. Reckless? Yes. Stupid? Yes, and she has paid a very heavy price for her stupidity.'</p>

<p>She explained Iacomi had lost her job, highlighting it would be difficult for her to find a new one in the current economic climate.</p>

<p>Ms Kenyon said Iacomi wanted to 'apologise to the victim' and that she 'did not intend to cause the victim any harm'.</p>

<p>She explained that during a work break, Ms Raychinova had approached her and 'told her off in front of everybody else', leaving Iacomi feeling 'belittled and humiliated'.</p>

<p>Iacomi had placed a 'tiny drop' of the liquid in Ms Raychinova's flask 'to spoil and to ruin her coffee break in order to annoy her', Ms Kenyon said.</p>

<p>Iacomi had placed a 'tiny drop' of the liquid in Ms Raychinova's flask at Fenchurch Station (pictured) 'to spoil and to ruin her coffee break in order to annoy her', Ms Kenyon said</p>

<p>She emphasised that the cleaning fluid 'isn't toxic' and was 'an alcohol-based substance, not acid' which is described as 'a mild irritant'.</p>

<p>Sentencing, Judge Kelleher said it was 'clear' from the case that Iacomi felt 'unfairly treated' by her victim and 'wanted revenge'.</p>

<p>He said Iacomi's actions were 'premeditated' and intended to cause 'some harm' because of a 'grudge' she held.</p>

<p>The judge highlighted that Iacomi 'did not know the level of risk' she was exposing Ms Raychinova to.</p>

<p>He told her: 'In my judgement, an ordinary person would assume that liquid used for the cleaning off of graffiti could be damaging if ingested.</p>

<p>'You suggested that your actions were a prank and the author did not accept that explanation and neither do I.</p>

<p>'You felt unfairly treated at work by Mr Raychinova and wanted revenge. </p>

<p>He added: 'Your actions were premeditated and your intention was clearly to cause some harm.</p>

<p>'It was a premeditated offence and your intention was to cause harm.</p>

<p>'This was a case in which you deliberately set out to cause injury to a colleague because you bore a grudge against her and did not know the level of risk you exposed her too.'</p>

<p>She pleaded guilty to one count of administering a noxious substance with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy.</p>

<p>The prosecution chose not to pursue a charge of administering poison or noxious substance so as to endanger life, to which Iacomi entered a not guilty plea. </p>
