<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Julian Draxler was PSG's saviour as the German winger struck in stoppage time to earn his side their first win of the season in a 1-0 victory over Metz.</p>

<p>The German winger headed home late on just as the French champions were preparing to deal with the consequences of a third consecutive league match without a win. </p>

<p>PSG had Abdou Diallo sent off in the second-half to add to their list of suspensions, which includes Brazilian winger Neymar and defender Layvin Kurzawa, the latter being handed a six-match ban earlier in the day for violent conduct during the weekend defeat to Marseille.  </p>

<p>Julian Draxler scored the winning goal in the 93rd minute as PSG beat Metz 1-0 on Wednesday</p>

<p>The German winger's goal earned the French champions their first win of the 2020-21 season</p>

<p>PSG were also missing Kylian Mbappe, who was diagnosed with coronavirus earlier this summer, though fellow attackers Angel Di Maria and Mauro Icardi started the game.</p>

<p>Despite Diallo's red card, which came with 25 minutes to play, the home side continued to push forward but were repeatedly thwarted by the feet of Metz goalkeeper Alexandre Oukidja.</p>

<p>Thomas Tuchel's side finally got the goal they craved when Draxler headed into an empty net after Oukidja parried a stinging cross from Angel di Maria.</p>

<p>Having lost their first two matches of the campaign to Lens and Marseille, PSG have three points after three games. </p>

<p>PSG had Abdou Diallo (middle) sent off for two bookable offences during the second-half</p>

<p>PSG started the match with attacking stars such as Angel Di Maria (above) who were frustrated</p>

<p>Thomas Tuchel's side had lost their previous two games and nearly went a third without a win</p>
