<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Adam Sandler is back on Netflix to save a town (and a holiday) from mortal peril in the upcoming family comedy Hubie Halloween.</p>

<p>Just one day after the actor turned 54, the streaming giant released a frighteningly funny trailer for the film which sees Sandler as well-meaning goof Hubie Dubois who lives to protect his town - despite their protestations.</p>

<p>The spooky flick brings together an all-star ensemble cast including Maya Rudolph, Julie Bowen, Kevin James, Kenan Thompson, Mikey Day, Ray Liotta, Tim Meadows, Shaquille O’Neal, and Steve Buscemi.</p>

<p>Spooky! Adam Sandler stars as a well-meaning goof who lives to protect his town on Halloween- despite their protestations - in the frighteningly funny trailer for Hubie Halloween, released on Thursday</p>

<p>'Well hello my ghouls and goblins,' a voice over begins in the trailer. 'I know you've got your costumes picked out for the frightful festivities and I hope you all get more treats than tricks.'</p>

<p>'Halloween's upon us!' Sandler's goofy character shouts at a neighbor while riding his bike.</p>

<p>Mustached Hubie Dubois is described by Julie Bowen's character in the trailer as the 'nicest guy' in the town of Salem.</p>

<p>The rest of the citizens, however, see him as a total buffoon and they make tormenting him a bit of a group sport.</p>

<p>'Well hello my ghouls and goblins,' a voice over begins in the trailer. 'I know you've got your costumes picked out for the frightful festivities and I hope you all get more treats than tricks.'</p>

<p>'Halloween's upon us!' Sandler's goofy character shouts at a neighbor while riding his bike.</p>

<p>Setting: The film is set in the fictitious town of Salem on Halloween when the citizens get dressed in costumes for an annual celebration</p>

<p>Hubie seems like an amalgamation of some of Sandler's most popular characters from previous films - Billy Madison, The Water Boy and Little Nicky.</p>

<p>'Halloween's biggest fan is the town's biggest joke,' a title screen in the trailer reads.</p>

<p>The whole town of Salem is decked out in Halloween decor - from pumpkins to skeletons to cobwebs - for their annual celebration.</p>

<p>Hubie has made it his personal mission to make sure the town stays safe and follows the rules throughout the year.  </p>

<p>A friend: Mustached Hubie Dubois is described by Julie Bowen's character in the trailer as the 'nicest guy' in the town of Salem</p>

<p>Punching bag: The rest of the citizens, however, see him as a total buffoon and they make tormenting him a bit of a group sport</p>

<p>Big time: The spooky flick brings together an all-star ensemble cast including Maya Rudolph, Julie Bowen, Kevin James, Kenan Thompson, Mikey Day, Ray Liotta, Tim Meadows, Shaquille O’Neal, and Steve Buscemi</p>

<p>Trick or treat? The whole town of Salem is decked out in Halloween decor - from pumpkins to skeletons to cobwebs - for their annual celebration</p>

<p>The trailer sees him making a constant stream of complaints to the local police officers who keep blowing him off for crying wolf. </p>

<p>On Halloween, Hubie kicks things up a notch as a self-appointed volunteer protector and sets out to make sure everyone is on the straight and narrow.</p>

<p>'It's pretty impressive how long he's been a loser,' Maya Rudolf quips while dressed like the bride of Frankenstein.</p>

<p>'Halloween's biggest fan is the town's biggest joke,' a title screen in the trailer reads.</p>

<p>Familiar: Hubie seems like an amalgamation of some of Sandler's most popular characters from previous films - Billy Madison, The Water Boy and Little Nicky</p>

<p>Oh no! Hubie has made it his personal mission to make sure the town stays safe and follows the rules throughout the year - especially on Halloween</p>

<p>'It's pretty impressive how long he's been a loser,' Maya Rudolf quips while dressed like the bride of Frankenstein.</p>

<p>While the town torments him - throwing things at him while he hides behind a pumpkin umbrella, mocking him and trashing his handmade 'Halloween word searches' for the kids - something goes awry.  </p>

<p>On October 31st Hubie finds himself in the midst of a real life murder investigation as a malevolent supernatural force starts picking towns people off one by one.</p>

<p>When he calls to report his concern to the local police, an officer (played by Keenan Thompson) promptly hangs up on him. Faced with no other option, Hubie goes it alone.</p>

<p>Excuse me, officer? The long haired and bearded cop in the film is played by an unrecognizable Kevin James</p>

<p>Something is different: On October 31st this year something truly sinister creeps through the town of Salem</p>

<p>Cameo! Former NBA star Shaquille O'neal makes an appearance in the trailer</p>

<p>The spooky search leads him to a mist covered corn maze where he finds a man tied up with a corn cob shoved in his mouth.  </p>

<p>A Mr. Lambert seems to be possessed by some sort of demon and wreaking havoc. In the creepy maze Hubie asks: 'Mr. Lambert, is that you?' </p>

<p>Despite the ridiculing townsfolk, the homespun vigilante seems to be getting a lot of support from one person. </p>

<p>'You're the best person I know,' Bowen's character tells Hubie. 'That's why you're a hero.'  </p>

<p>You need to calm down: The trailer sees Hubie making a constant stream of complaints to the local police officers who keep blowing him off for crying wolf</p>

<p>How rude! Hubie loves Halloween so much he made holiday word searches for the kids but a mean old lady promptly throws them out</p>

<p>The disrespect: While the town torments him - throwing things at him while he hides behind a pumpkin umbrella - something goes awry</p>

<p>Yikes: On October 31st Hubie finds himself in the midst of a real life murder investigation as a malevolent supernatural force starts picking towns people off one by one</p>

<p>The holiday flick is Sandler's latest with Netflix as part of their extended deal with his production company Happy Madison. </p>

<p>He first signed a deal with streaming platform in 2014 and re-upped that deal in 2017. </p>

<p>Sandler extended his partnership following the huge success of comedy Murder Mystery and the critical acclaim for Uncut Gems, for which he won an Independent Spirit Award and which premieres later this month on Netflix which co-financed it.</p>

<p>Murder Mystery, in which Sandler starred with Jennifer Aniston, was the streaming service's most popular movie in 2019. </p>

<p>Protector: When he calls to report his concern to the local police, an officer (played by Keenan Thompson) promptly hangs up on him. Faced with no other option, Hubie goes it alone to save the town</p>

<p>Yikes! A supernatural killer is on the lose and Hubie steps in to defend Halloween</p>
