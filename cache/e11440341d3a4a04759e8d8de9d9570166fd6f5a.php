<p>Donald Trump's ex-wife Ivana, pictured with her former husband in New York in 1989, has been branded a 'bigoted embarrassment' for her 'disturbing' comments on US immigration today</p>

<p>Appearing on Loose Women, the 71-year-old told that she is 'very proud' of her former partner, particularly for 'all he has achieved with immigration'</p>

<p>When asked whether she is proud of her ex husband, she said: 'Very proud, he was my husband of 15 years, I wish him all the best. </p>

<p>'I see he can do a great job, he is pro everything which I believe in. He is republican and so am I, he has achieved so much - especially with immigration.</p>

<p>'I am an immigrant, and I have no problem with the immigrants, but they must come into the country legally and get a job and pay taxes like the rest of the Americans and just live and and be part of society.</p>

<p>'There are some people who don't even dress Americanly, they dress whatever they dress in and they don't get a job and they steal and they rape the women and that is not the idea.' </p>

<p>Viewers were outraged by the comments, with one calling the outburst 'disturbing', while another called the mother-of-three an 'embarrassing bigot'</p>

<p>When asked whether she felt her view on immigration could be perceived as inhumane, she went on:  'It is inhumane, but everybody has to pick themselves up. </p>

<p>'They have to properly, apply for the visa so they can come to America and cross the border properly and get a job, have a house, start a family.' </p>

<p>Host Jane Moore interjected: 'But those opportunities are very few and far between nowadays aren't they?'</p>

<p>'They are, but the people who will prevail, the people who want to work will prevail, the people who want to get food stamps and sleep on the benches, this is what we don't want.' </p>

<p>Ivana insisted that all immigration into America should be legal, and that those who are able to 'cross legally and get a job will prevail' </p>

<p>Host Jane Moore interjected: 'But those opportunities are very few and far between nowadays aren't they?'</p>

<p>Viewers were quick to take to Twitter to rage at the conversation, with one writing: 'Ivana Trump omg!! Her remarks on immigration absolutely disturbing.'</p>

<p>Another said: 'Ivana Trump on <?php echo e('@'); ?>loosewomen just now saying immigrants don't even 'dress American and they steal and rape the woman' comes as a massive shock (NOT!!) that she's a bigoted embarrassment just like her ex husband.' </p>

<p>Ivana was asked how often she is able to speak with the president , with whom she has three children Eric, 36, Ivanka, 38, and Donald Jr., 42. </p>

<p>She replied: 'I can speak to him any time'.  </p>

<p>Ivana told that while she and Donald had a rocky relationship following their divorce, they have since become 'very good friends'. </p>

<p>'It took about two years until our prenuptial agreement was finalised and we split whatever we had to split, she said. </p>

<p>Ivana married Donald Trump in 1977 and while the pair divorced in 1990, she claims she is able to speak to the President 'any time'</p>

<p>She admitted that she never speaks to his current wife Melania, 50, pictured this month, who she referred to as his 'ex wife', as she doesn't like to be 'involved with his private life'</p>

<p>'We spoke about our kids we have three wonderful kids to raise, they needed people to look after them and guide them and so after that we became very good friends'. </p>

<p>However she admitted that she never speaks to his current wife Melania, 50, who she referred to as his 'ex wife', as she doesn't like to be 'involved with his private life'. </p>

<p>'I speak directly to Mr President, said Ivana, 'I don't get involved with his private life, we speak about our children but I don't give him advice. I tell him what I think is right and wrong but we don't speak about ex wives.' </p>

<p>When asked whether she felt Melania is a good First Lady, she said: 'I am not sure, she's very quiet and she doesn't go to too many places. She goes when she has to go but she's quiet. ' </p>
