<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Sharks young gun who was forced to quit the NRL after painful headaches turned out to be brain cancer has been cleared of the disease in a 'remarkable' recovery.</p>

<p>Fine Kula, who was a part of Cronulla's pre-season NRL training squad, was diagnosed with Medulloblastoma in early 2020. </p>

<p>In the wake of the diagnosis, the 21-year-old announced he would retire from the game to seek treatment for the life-threatening illness.</p>

<p>Kula spent most of the year enduring hospital visits, chemotherapy treatments and doctor's appointments before he was told he had beaten the disease on Monday.</p>

<p>Fine Kula (pictured), who was a part of Cronulla's pre-season NRL training squad, was diagnosed with Medulloblastoma in early 2020</p>

<p>'In a huge boost for everybody involved at the Sharks, as well as the rugby league community that has supported him through an incredibly difficult ten months, Fine Kula has been given some remarkable news,' the club said in statement. </p>

<p>Kula recently finished an intense bout of chemotherapy and then underwent a full body scan and a blood test at the end of last week. </p>

<p>The ex-NRL rising star and his family then had an appointment with his cancer specialist on Monday.</p>

<p>Kula's father Solomon said: 'Before we went in we said, ''whatever the doctor says, we can still move on, still carry on''.</p>

<p>'Then the doctor says he is clear, there is nothing to talk about. No tumour, no cancer, bone marrow clean, organs clean. Blood count is clear. We just couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>'They (the doctors) thought Fine would never walk out of Westmead Hospital.'</p>

<p>Solomon said the chemotherapy had taken a heavy toll on his son, who is still recovering from the ordeal.</p>

<p>'We can't thank everybody at the Sharks, Sharks fans, the rugby league community enough for their support,' he said. </p>

<p>In the wake of the diagnosis, the 21-year-old (pictured) announced he would retire from the game to seek treatment for the life-threatening illness</p>

<p>'And to the doctors, specialists and nurses who have been amazing.' </p>

<p>Kula is no longer on medication but is seeking fundraising for a pill which would stop the tumour from reforming or returning. </p>

<p>Following the shock diagnosis, Kula announced his immediate retirement from the NRL in February.</p>

<p>'Been deleting this and redoing it but really don't know how to say it. But I started playing the game of rugby league at 12 years old and I have loved the game ever since,' he wrote at the time.</p>

<p>'It gave me the opportunity to up lift my family to Australia, been such a pleasure playing for the Sharks, made friends that I know will be friends for a long time, but due to medical reasons for now gonna have to hang up the boots.</p>

<p>'Hurts thinking about it, footy has been a lifestyle for me past seven years. But being around family and getting healthy is next task for me. Thanks everyone who has messaged me.'</p>

<p>The 'Fight For Fine' GoFundMe page explained the 21-year-old was diagnosed after suffering severe headaches.</p>

<p>'Training with the Sharks full-time NRL squad prior to Christmas, young front rower Fine Kula complained of severe headaches, which a series of tests would later reveal to be brain cancer,' the fundraising page stated.</p>

<p>'A popular member of the squad and a player with immense potential, 21-year-old Kula was diagnosed with a grade-four Medulloblastoma. </p>

<p>'A type of cancer rarely found in adults, the recovery process is largely unknown, this devastating news hit Kula, his family, friends and all at the Sharks extremely hard.'</p>

<p>Kula moved from New Zealand to Australia six years ago and joined the Sharks when he was just 15 years old. </p>
