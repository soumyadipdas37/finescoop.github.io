<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A quarantined lawyer is so outraged at Queensland's border stance he has vowed to spend $1,800 every week until the election to fly a sign over Brisbane slamming the premier.</p>

<p>James Stevens is paying for a banner calling Annastacia Palaszczuk 'heartless' to be flown behind a plane from Coolangatta to Brisbane.</p>

<p>The message is in response to Queensland's border restrictions which Mr Stevens said have 'to stop'.  </p>

<p>He said seeing people being denied exemptions to attend funerals or visit dying relatives was 'the most outrageous' thing he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Brisbane lawyer James Stevens will spend $1,800 every week until the Queensland election to fly a banner (pictured) slamming premier Annastacia Palaszczuk as 'heartless' due to the state's border stance</p>

<p>'I nearly threw my computer at the TV when I saw that,' he told ABC News.</p>

<p>'She (Annastacia Palaszczuk) has exhibited a real callousness, a cold-hearted attitude to people's suffering and problems.'</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk has repeatedly stated that the Chief Health Officer, Jeannette Young, has the final say on border exemptions. </p>

<p>Mr Stevens, who is in quarantine in Brisbane after returning from Sydney, isn't the only person paying to send a message to the Queensland Government. </p>

<p>Brisbane landscaper John McInerney used the same company to have a banner reading 'vote her out' flown from the Gold Coast to Brisbane. </p>

<p>Both men said they don't have any political affiliations and were standing up against what they saw as an injustice. </p>

<p>Currently a person is given a health exemption to enter Queensland from a COVID-19 hotspot if the urgent medical care can't be provided from a closer location. </p>

<p>Mr Stevens and another Queensland man, John McInerney, have both paid for banners slamming the premier (pictured) in the lead up to the election saying she needs to be voted out</p>

<p>Anyone granted permission to enter Queensland from a COVID hotspot is required to go into 14-day quarantine in approved accommodation and at their own expense.</p>

<p>Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce described Queensland's hardline border measures as a sham after American actor Tom Hanks was allowed to enter the state.</p>

<p>Hanks returned to Australia earlier this month to finish shooting a film, quarantining at a Gold Coast hotel with 11 other family, cast members and production staff.</p>

<p>Their entry was approved by the federal home affairs department at the request of the Queensland government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile no new COVID-19 cases were recorded in Queensland, while New South Wales recorded four new cases. </p>

<p>'It's in stark contrast to people who can't go to funerals, and that's what aggravates me so much,' Mr Joyce told the Seven Network.</p>

<p>'We've got the AFL in there first class, we've got Tom Hanks in there, we've got his offsiders in there, but we can't get a person across to see their dad buried.'</p>
