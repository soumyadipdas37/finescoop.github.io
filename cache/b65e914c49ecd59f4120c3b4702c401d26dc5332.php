<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Juventus have signed Spain striker Alvaro Morata on a season-long loan from Atletico Madrid for £9m, the Italian champions announced on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The agreement also gives Juve an option to buy the 27-year-old at the end of the season for £41m to be paid over three years.</p>

<p>They could otherwise take him on loan again for the 2021-22 season for another £9m and then buy him outright in 2022 at a reduced cost of £32m.</p>

<p>The club made the announcement with a shirt video, which was accompanied by the words 'more memories, more victories, more sound, more lights. </p>

<p>Morata scored 12 goals and made two assists for Atletico in the 2019-20 season after making his loan move from Chelsea permanent last summer.</p>

<p>The forward never hit the heights expected of him at Stamford Bridge but fared better in La Liga, where he managed 43 goals in 112 games for both Atletico and Real.</p>

<p>The striker scored 15 goals across two years in his first spell with Juve but Morata is arguably the club's second choice after missing out on Luis Suarez. </p>

<p>Juve had long held an interest in the Barca man and he passed an Italian exam in Perugia last week in order to acquire dual nationality, with the club being unable to bring in any more non-EU players in this transfer window following the arrivals of Arthur Melo and Weston McKennie. </p>

<p>Morata was all smiles after officially rejoining his former club on a season-long loan</p>

<p>The 27-year-old Spanish striker completed his medical in Turin on Tuesday morning </p>

<p>But manager Andrea Pirlo admitted the move would be difficult because of the time it takes for a passport to be approved with October 5 the deadline for moves to be completed.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan's six-year stint at the Nou Camp is coming to a bitter end despite him being Barca's third highest goalscorer of all time. </p>

<p>Suarez's arrival at Atletico would come as a huge boost to Simeone's side, although recent reports suggest Barcelona are making a last-ditch attempt to block the move as they try to add Atletico to their 'vetoed list'. </p>
