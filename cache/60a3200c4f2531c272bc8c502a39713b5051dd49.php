<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Not the most memorable night of international football, but crucial results and performances as some major sides kicked off their Nations League campaign. </p>

<p>Holland were the only side to claim three points from the four covered matches, with home nations Scotland and Northern Ireland drawing with their respective opponents.</p>

<p>Italy 1-1 Bosnia and Herzegovina</p>

<p>Holland 1-0 Poland</p>

<p>Romania 1-1 Northern Ireland</p>

<p>Scotland 1-1 Israel</p>

<p>Scotland have just three added minutes to save this match. After taking the lead, a 1-1 draw is a frustrating result for the hosts.</p>

<p>A huge, huge goal for the ten men of Northern Ireland. In the 87th minute they have found an equaliser through Gavin Whyte.</p>

<p>Despite equalising, Italy look desperate to try and find a winner as a 1-1 draw with Bosnia will not satisfy Roberto Mancini's side.</p>

<p>Italy 1-1 Bosnia and Herzegovina</p>

<p>Holland 1-0 Poland</p>

<p>Romania 1-0 Northern Ireland</p>

<p>Scotland 1-1 Israel</p>

<p>Goal for Israel and it was special! Zahavi breaks through the Scotland defence, sets himself and blasts the ball into the roof of the net. Huge blow for Steve Clarke's side.</p>

<p>You won't see a better cross all season. No-one in an Israel shirt could get on the end of Elazar Dasa's cross in a huge let-off for the Scots.</p>

<p>Italy equalise! Stefani Sensi scores a huge goal for the Italians. (that last post aged well.) </p>

<p>Edin Dzeko has scored a goal that could cause a huge shock in the Nations League. Italy, who had won eleven matches in a row before tonight and are one of the most formidable teams at home in international football, are losing.</p>

<p>Holland finally lead and it's Tottenham winger Steven Bergwijn with the goal. He has the easiest job in the world as he taps it into an empty net.</p>

<p>A massive shock over in Italy! Bosnia have taken the lead just before the hour mark! of course, it's Edin Dzeko with the finish. Like a fine wine.</p>

<p>George Puscas is denied a second goal after a brilliant save from Bailey Peacock-Farrell. The striker's header was heading right for the corner, but the Northern Ireland goalkeeper pulled off an incredible stretching save.</p>

<p>The Azzurri have come out fighting in the second half as they continue to dominate possession and the shot count. Nicolo Barella had a good chance well defended by Bosnia in the final moments.</p>

<p>Memphis Depay comes so close to giving Holland the lead! He sprints into the box and is found at the back post but his effort goes inches wide. Could it be one of those nights for the Dutch?</p>

<p>Hoping for a little more action in the second periods, with just two goals so far. </p>

<p>Italy 0-0 Bosnia and Herzegovina</p>

<p>Holland 0-0 Poland</p>

<p>Romania 1-0 Northern Ireland</p>

<p>Scotland 1-0 Israel</p>

<p>Ryan Christie makes no trouble from the spot. He fired that into the top left corner. No chance any goalkeeper would save it.</p>

<p>PENALTY TO SCOTLAND! John McGinn is taken down inside the box. Right decision.</p>

<p>Chaos inside the Scotland box! David Marshall pulls off a fantastic save to keep out a close range header and the visitors then fluff up the rebound. Warning signs.</p>

<p>Red card for Northern Ireland! It's gone from bad to worse. Josh Magennis receives his second yellow for a nasty challenge and will take an early shower. </p>

<p>Scotland are starting to find some rhythm near the end of the first half. Everything good for Scotland has come through John McGinn. The Villa man just set up Callum McGregor but he drags his shot wide.</p>

<p>Poland striker Krzysztof Piatek fires a lethal strike towards the top corner and Holland keeper Jasper Cillessen pulls off an amazing save just to keep it out.</p>

<p>Three of the matches remain goalless with Romania being the only team to take the lead against Northern Ireland. It's tight and tense on international football's return.</p>

<p>Holland will be kicking themselves as Quincy Promes sees his effort sliced narrowly wide after a great team move. Just under 70% possession for the hosts. </p>

<p>Not the start that Northern Ireland wanted. It's a simple tap in for George Puscas, as the visitors fail to clear the danger.</p>

<p>Lorenzo Insigne has had his second chance of the match, narrowly missing a free-kick just minutes after Federico Chiesa came close for the Italians. Bosnia with their backs to the wall.</p>

<p>Scotland won't have it all their own way this evening. The visitors have managed to get down the left flank a few times, beating make-shift right-back Scott McTominay. Back-and-forth so far.</p>

<p>Roberto Mancini's men have had their first sight of goal through Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne. However, the speedster's effort is fired over the bar.</p>

<p>As predicted, Scotland are looking dangerous down the left side through Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney. After a good move, John McGinn is almost found at the back post but Israel do just enough. A couple corners come to nothing for the hosts.</p>

<p>The Dutch players have taken early control on home turf. They are the clear favourites tonight against a Poland side without Bayern Munich star Robert Lewandowski.</p>

<p>We are off as Italy, Holland, Scotland and Northern Ireland all begin their new Nations League journey...</p>

<p>The moment of the evening we get to roughly hear which players can sing well and which players can sing really, really badly. </p>

<p>The warm-ups are over and the final coaching points have been made. We are just ten minutes away from kick-off around the grounds.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland will need to improve on their last Nations League campaign if they want to battle with the big boys, after they lost all four of their group games in the last tournament. However, 2019 did prove to be a solid year for them, with six wins across competitive and friendly matches.</p>

<p>They travel to Romania, who earned promotion to League B after the 2018/19 campaign. With only four matches to prove their worth, both nations will be believing they can and must win tonight.</p>

<p>Scotland ended 2019 in emphatic fashion, with 6-0, 2-1 and 3-1 victories - albeit against rather easy opposition. However, Steve Clarke’s side possess talents over the pitch with Andy Robertson, Kieran Tierney Scott McTominay and John McGinn to name several.With Czech Republic and Slovakia making up Group 2 in League B, the Scots will treat this match as a must-win.</p>

<p>Israel endured a pretty torrid end to 2019 with four losses from their last five matches but they will target Scotland’s inconsistency in European competitions.</p>

<p>Last Nations League’s finalists Holland will hope to go one step better with a new face at the helm. Dwight Lodeweges will take charge of the Dutch after manager Ronald Koeman left his national post for the Barcelona job.</p>

<p>A lot of eyes will be on Liverpool midfielder Gini Wijnaldum in the Holland centre, to see how he links up with Barcelona’s Frenkie De Jong ahead of his potential move to the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>Italy embarrassed Armenia 9-1 in their last back back in November 2019. The emphatic victory secured their eleventh win in a row, with the Azzurri cruising past tonight’s opponents, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 3-0 in the Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>

<p>The newly-promoted Bosnia, with familiar faces Edin Dzeko and Sead Kolasinac among their ranks, could have their work cut out if the Italian revival continues post-lockdown.</p>
