<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Multimillionaire hedge fund manager Crispin Odey has denied accusations he assaulted a young investment banker in 1998. </p>

<p>Odey, 61, allegedly 'engineered' a situation where he could invite a junior employee from a major investment bank back to his Chelsea home after a meeting on July 13, 1998.</p>

<p>He is then said to have changed out of his suit into a dressing gown and 'launched himself' at the complainant, pushing his hand inside her blouse to grab her breast and putting his hand up her skirt.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Aaron McCalister told the court the complainant was in her 20s at the time of the alleged offence.</p>

<p>He clarified that although Odey is accused of putting his hand in the woman's blouse, it is not claimed it was inside her bra.</p>

<p>Crispin Odey (pictured), 61, allegedly 'engineered' a situation whereby he could invite a junior employee from a major investment bank back to his Chelsea home on July 13, 1998</p>

<p>The court heard the alleged victim first went to the police with her complaint three years ago, but that she had first contacted Odey himself about the incident in 2013.</p>

<p>Odey, whose first name is Robin but uses his middle name Crispin, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday, where he denied one count of indecent assault.</p>

<p>The vocal Brexit backer is worth about £800 million according to the Sunday Times Rich List and is said to have donated £10,000 to Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign.</p>

<p>He is the founder of multi-billion pound firm Odey Asset Management, backed by Hungarian philanthropist George Soros and is said to have given almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit-campaigns in the past.</p>

<p>Odey was accompanied by his wife, Nichola Pease (pictured), also a hedge fund manager, whom he married in 1991</p>

<p>The Oxford-educated former barrister entered the dock smartly dressed in a dark grey suit, black glasses, a blue shirt and a red tie.</p>

<p>He spoke to confirm his name, address, and date of birth. He then pleaded not guilty to a single charge of indecent assault. </p>

<p>Crispin Aylett QC, for Odey, described the allegations as 'immensely damaging for Mr Odey, both professionally and personally', and called for the case to be dealt with as swiftly as possible in the magistrates' courts.</p>

<p>Chairman of the bench Richard Duncalf declined an application by the prosecution to have the case sent to the crown court.</p>

<p>He was briefly married to media mogul Rupert Murdoch's eldest daughter Prudence in the mid 1980s.</p>

<p>Odey has courted controversy over the course of his career through his investment strategies.</p>

<p>He told the BBC 'Il mattino ha l'oro in bocca' - the morning has gold in its mouth - on the day after the 2016 EU referendum, after netting £220 million betting the markets would fall.</p>

<p>In 2008 he earned £28 million after successfully predicting the credit crunch, and backed a no-deal Brexit, but denied he was doing so in order to profit from a fall in the value of British companies.</p>

<p>In a statement, Mr Odey said: 'I'm pleased that the magistrates have agreed to hear this historic matter quickly.</p>

<p>'I look forward to having the facts heard and maintain the allegation is untrue.'</p>

<p>Odey, of Chelsea, denied indecent assault and was released on conditional bail with a requirement not to contact the alleged victim.</p>

<p>A provisional date for a two-day summary trial before a district judge was fixed for 17 and 18 February 2021 at Hendon Magistrates’ Court after Odey opted against a jury trial. </p>
