<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United midfielder Dylan Levitt is undergoing a medical ahead of finalising a loan move to Charlton Athletic.</p>

<p>As Sportsmail revealed yesterday, the 19-year-old Wales international will spend the season in League One with United keen for him to gain more competitive game time.</p>

<p>Levitt was given his Wales debut by Ryan Giggs last week and he has been influential in pushing the youngster to challenge himself by going out on loan.</p>

<p>Man Utd's Dylan Levitt is undergoing a medical ahead of finalising a loan move to Charlton</p>

<p>The teenager faced Finland in Wales' Nations League clash - his full international debut </p>

<p>Charlton manager Lee Bowyer is keen to add some energy into his midfield and Levitt has that plus an eye for a pass. </p>

<p>Giggs has been made aware of the teenager's potential for some time. </p>

<p>Levitt's first senior call-up for Wales came in May 2019 for a training camp in Portugal, before he was named as one of four uncapped players in Giggs' 28-man party for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Croatia and Hungary.</p>

<p>Giggs said: 'The only problem is players can go out on loan, it can look a great move, and then they don’t play. </p>

<p>Levitt will spend time gaining experience in senior first-team football at the Valley</p>

<p>Wales manager Ryan Giggs emphasised the importance of Levitt playing during his loan move</p>

<p>'Then they’re training somewhere else rather than training at United and learning off the players there.</p>

<p>'It’s always a balancing act, it’s always a difficult one, but Dylan has got a big choice to make and hopefully he chooses right.'</p>

<p>United are still looking to loan out James Garner also but Championship Huddersfield Town have cooled on a move after considering other targets. </p>
