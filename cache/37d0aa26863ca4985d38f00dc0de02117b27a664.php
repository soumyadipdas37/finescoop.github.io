<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A man was killed after being hit by a chair thrown by an employee of a Missouri concert venue after a Dave Matthews Band performance, a lawsuit has claimed.</p>

<p>Jefferson City resident Jasen Smith, 44, was searching for his wife's souvenir T-shirt when he suffered the fatal injury on May 15, 2019.</p>

<p>The wrongful death lawsuit was filed by Jason's wife Darcey Smith last month against Live Nation - the owners of the Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Live Nation are now seeking to transfer the lawsuit to the federal court in St. Louis.</p>

<p>The lawsuit claims that employees were collapsing hundreds of chairs that had been set up on the lawn for the concert. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Smith was walking back through a pedestrian walkway called 'the moat' in the amphitheatre after Darcy realized she had left the souvenir shirt.</p>

<p>As he was walking down the pathway, he was struck by one of the chairs, the suit says.</p>

<p>The chair that hit Smith caused him to fall backwards and hit his head on the concrete walkway.</p>

<p>When he didn't return, his wife called his phone at around 11:10 p.m. but to her surprise, a paramedic answered.</p>

<p>She rushed to where he husband was and found him unconscious and bleeding from his ear, according to a report in May 2019 by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</p>

<p>The suit claims that employees of the venue, believing he was drunk, were slow to provide medical care for Smith, who died next morning in hospital of a brain injury.</p>

<p>Chip Gentry, the family's attorney, said at the time that doctors had determined that Smith suffered a blunt force injury to the back of his head that fractured his skill.</p>

<p>How the injury was caused remained a mystery to police, who called for witnesses last year, but Gentry said that he was not aware of any further findings by the police since.</p>

<p>The allegations in the lawsuit, he said, were based on lawyers' 'good faith investigation and what we believe happened'.</p>

<p>Speaking at the time, Gentry said the family were 'devastated'. 'You can't fathom going to a Dave Matthews Band concert on a Wednesday evening and being struck by something which cost you your life. We will certainly dig deep to hold those responsible accountable.</p>

<p>'He was a great business man and father to his twin boys. He ran a really neat car lot in town that specialized in custom trucks. </p>

<p>'There were 1,000 people at his memorial service. He had a good reputation and a lot of friends. He coached his kids' teams,' he said.</p>

<p>Smith is survived by his wife and twin sons, who were 10 when he died. </p>

<p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said that Live Nation lawyers did not respond to an email sent seeking comment.</p>
