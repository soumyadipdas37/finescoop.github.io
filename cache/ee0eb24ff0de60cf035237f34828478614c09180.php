<p>David Charles 'Yankee' Edgerley, 34, is facing a committal hearing in Brisbane Magistrate Court on Tuesday charged with murdering underworld figure Victor Graveson (pictured) in September 2017</p>

<p>Witness Bronwyn Hocking told the court she spotted the smoke and ran toward Mr Graveson's home.</p>

<p>'I saw Yankee standing out the front at the front sliding door,' Ms Hocking told the hearing.</p>

<p>'I came through the gates, paused, and I saw what I saw.'</p>

<p>Ms Hocking said Edgerley was on the verandah, standing at Mr Graveson's door and holding it closed with two hands.</p>

<p>'Victor was on the other side screaming - he was pulling at the door and the curtains and trying to get out.</p>

<p>'I hit Yankee with something, he turned and looked at me, and then ran off.</p>

<p>'I did not give him a second thought. It all happened very quickly.'</p>

<p>Mr Graveson suffered burns to 80 per cent of his body and was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but died later that day</p>

<p>Mr Graveson suffered burns to 80 per cent of his body and was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but died later that day.</p>

<p>He had a lengthy criminal history, having been jailed for 10 years in 1996 for his role in the sale of a cannabis crop worth almost $2million.</p>

<p>Ms Hocking and her partner Joshua Campbell were regulars at Mr Graveson's home and told the court drug use was common there.</p>

<p>'It was well known that Victor sold drugs,' Mr Campbell said.</p>

<p>'Most people that were at Victor's place used drugs or knew of people who used drugs.'</p>

<p>Mr Graveson, 65, was a convicted drug trafficker before he was set alight as he slept at his Alexandra Hills home (pictured)</p>

<p>Several witnesses said Edgerley's behaviour had been erratic in the weeks and months leading up to Mr Graveson's death, including saying the Queen was his grandmother.</p>

<p>Witness Todd Sell told the court by telephone link that Edgerley told him he was the last surviving member of the British royal family.</p>

<p>'He said he was the last royal and I cracked up, I pissed myself laughing. He really believed that,' Mr Sell said.</p>

<p>'He goes 'I am related to the royal family - I am the last royal' and I was like 'righto then'.'</p>

<p>The hearing before magistrate Noel Nunan continues.</p>
