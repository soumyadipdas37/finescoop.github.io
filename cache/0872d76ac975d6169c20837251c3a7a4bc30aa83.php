<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australia's citizenship test will be overhauled to force respondents to study values such as 'mateship', having a 'fair go' - and that is not acceptable for men to assault their wives. </p>

<p>Acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge will reveal the changes to the test's content on Thursday as part of Australian Citizenship Day.</p>

<p>The new test will also include questions about laws on polygamy, same-sex marriage and racial abuse.</p>

<p>Until now would-be Australians only had to study the 'Life in Australia' booklet, pass the test, then sign the Australian values statement. </p>

<p>From November, a section on Australian values will be added to the booklet - and questions about those values will be asked in the test for the first time. </p>

<p>Five of the new test's 20 multiple choice questions will be about 'values' - and respondents will need to answer all five correctly to pass, reported the Courier Mail. </p>

<p>They will include 'are people free to choose who they marry', 'should people in Australia learn English' - and 'is it acceptable for a husband to psychically harm his wife if she disrespected him'.  </p>

<p>The booklet will also include advice about camaraderie and a 'fair go'. </p>

<p>It offers are explanations on the 'strong tradition of 'mateship' in Australia 'where people provide help to others voluntarily'. </p>

<p>Apsiring Australians will face a new challenge from November 15 with changes to the Australian Citizenship test (pictured: Bondi Beach is packed with revellers celebrating Australia Day in January 2020)</p>

<p>'A mate is often a friend but can also be a spouse, partner, brother, sister, daughter or son. A mate can also be a total stranger,' the booklet reads. </p>

<p>The booklet will also place an emphasis on abiding by the rules including the directive to 'follow the law even if no one is watching.' </p>

<p>Advice around religion aims to demonstrate there is no official religion in Australia and religious teachings do not dictate the law.  </p>

<p>Attempts to include Australian values in the citizenship test were rebuffed back in 2017 because of a push to include an English language test </p>

<p>Minister Tudge said it will be a vital new way to integrate new Australians into the community.</p>

<p>'Our Australian values are important. They have helped shape our country and they are the reason why so many people want to become Australian citizens,' he said.</p>

<p>'We are asking those who apply for citizenship to understand our values more deeply before they make the ultimate commitment to our nation.' </p>

<p>The changes mark the first major restructure of the citizenship test in more than a decade.</p>

<p>Attempts to include Australian values in the citizenship test were rebuffed back in 2017 because of a push to include an English language test.    </p>

<p>Is it okay to prohibit girls from education?</p>

<p>Are people free to choose who they marry?</p>

<p>Can you encourage violence against a person or group of people if you have been insulted? </p>
