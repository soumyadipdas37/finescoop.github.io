<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mikel Arteta has hailed the progress made by Nicolas Pepe and believes Arsenal's £72million club record signing will flourish in the future.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old Ivorian winger didn't start either of Arsenal's opening two Premier League games, coming off the bench in both, but impressed in the Gunners' midweek Carabao Cup win over Leicester.</p>

<p>And manager Arteta spoke positively of Pepe as Arsenal prepare for back-to-back meetings with Liverpool first in the league and then the cup.</p>

<p>Nicolas Pepe has received the backing of his manager Mikel Arteta to flourish at Arsenal</p>

<p>Arteta has been pleased with Pepe's performances and believes his game has developed</p>

<p>He said: 'I think he's come a long way. We know what the club paid for him when he joined and that was obviously an extra pressure but he's a player who's had to adapt, it's a different style.</p>

<p>'He has a really good attitude. We can see he has developed in a lot of phases of his game.</p>

<p>'He's very settled here, he's liked by the boys, he is a really good character to have around and I'm very positive that we're going to have him for many years and that he can perform at a really high level consistently.' </p>

<p>Pepe put in a good display as Arsenal beat Leicester City in the Carabao Cup this week</p>

<p>The £72million club record signing had come off the bench in Arsenal's Premier League games</p>

<p>Arteta also believes Nketiah could be in line for a senior England call-up after recent goals</p>

<p>Arteta also sees the summer arrival of Pepe's former team-mate at Lille, Gabriel, as a positive.</p>

<p>'I think it's always nice for them to have some compatriots next to them, it obviously makes things a lot easier in the first few months when they cannot speak the language,' he said. </p>

<p>'I think for both of them, they know each other and they've spent some time together now. I think it's a positive thing.'</p>

<p>Arteta also spoke glowingly of striker Eddie Nketiah, who has started the season in excellent form with goals against West Ham and Leicester.</p>

<p>It has led to suggestions the 21-year-old, who has 12 goals in 10 matches for England under-21s, might earn a first call-up to Gareth Southgate's senior squad.</p>

<p>Arteta said: 'Obviously if he keeps performing in the way he has been with us in the last few months he will have a really good chance.</p>

<p>'I think culturally, England and the actual manager are really brave with young kids.</p>

<p>'It's up to them, they have to be consistent and keep doing what they're doing at club level and then that opportunity will come in a natural way.'</p>
