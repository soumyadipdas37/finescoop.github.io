<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Diego Costa and Luis Suarez, two of the great footballing villains to play at centre-forward, have united at Atletico Madrid - and they can't contain their excitement.   </p>

<p>The pair teamed-up for the first time on Sunday night after Suarez's £5.5m move from Barcelona, as Atletico Madrid dismantled Granda 6-1 in their opening LaLiga fixture of the season. </p>

<p>Suarez replaced Costa in the 71st minute after the Spaniard fired-in the opener after six minutes, only for Suarez to bag a double and add an assist inside his first 25 minutes at the club. </p>

<p>Diego Costa is relishing the chance to partner-up with Luis Suarez at Atletico Madrid </p>

<p>Suarez came on for Costa in Atletico's 6-1 thrashing of Granada, scoring a double and assisting</p>

<p>Suarez and Costa are both controversial characters and will certainly stir up trouble together</p>

<p>Both men have a controversial past and have made a habit of riling-up rival fans through their antics. Despite both men having broken into their 30s, it could be an explosive forward line. </p>

<p>'It's great. One bites and the other kicks,' the former Chelsea striker said after thrashing Granada. </p>

<p>'We are very lucky to have Luis, I don't understand how Barca could have let him leave.</p>

<p>Costa opened the scoring for Atletico on just six minutes before Atletico continued their rout</p>

<p>'He's going to help us with lots of goals as well as his warrior spirit and his hunger to win trophies. </p>

<p>'I hope he can help us win another trophy for our fans, but we need to take each game as it comes.'  </p>

<p>Suarez cemented himself in Barcelona history by slotting in at third in their all-time scorers list, but he's not done yet. </p>

<p>The Uruguayan smashed in 16 goals and contributed eight assists in LaLiga last season despite a knee surgery taking a dent out of his season. </p>
