<p>Adding: 'He's reached a new level of fame thanks to [This Is Us] and he doesn't want to close many doors right now, and that's not necessarily the path Chrishell is looking to take. She thought babies would happen soon after they got married, but it just hasn't worked out.' </p>

<p>The insider for the outlet noted that 'Justin has already been married and divorced once before.
