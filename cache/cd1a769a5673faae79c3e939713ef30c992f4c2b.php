<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Just one-in-three Brits are asked for test and trace details at UK hairdressers and restaurants, new data has revealed.</p>

<p>Some 31 per cent of adults in England said they were always asked for the information, according to a report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>

<p>More than a quarter said they were never asked for the details.</p>

<p>The survey of 1,130 adults across the UK, asked people how often they were asked for their details when visiting places outside their homes in the past seven days.</p>

<p>Figures captured between September 9 and 13 varied across the different countries in the UK - with Scots appearing to better stick to the rules. </p>

<p>Some 45 per cent of adults in Wales and 66 per cent in Scotland reported always being asked for details.  </p>

<p>In Wales, 23 per cent of those surveyed said they had never been asked and in Scotland the figure was 12 per cent.</p>

<p>The ONS added that of those who were asked to provide their details, nearly seven in 10 (69 per cent) said they did so every time, but 11 per cent said they rarely or never provided their personal contact details.</p>

<p>It comes as local authorities in the north-west of England await Government announcements on stricter lockdown measures following spikes in the number of infections.</p>

<p>Regulations for places in the North East, including Northumberland, Newcastle, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead, Sunderland and County Durham have already been put in place.</p>

<p>The ONS data also showed that the percentage of adults who had left their home to eat or drink at a restaurant, cafe, bar or pub had decreased for the first time in the past week since early July.</p>

<p>Three in 10 (30 per cent) adults said they had eaten out, compared with nearly four in 10 (38 per cent) two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Amid growing alarm that the situation is sliding out of control, curbs including a curfew on pubs and restaurants and a ban on socialising outside of households have been announced across parts of the North West, Midlands and West Yorkshire from Tuesday.</p>

<p>Coronavirus cases have been increasing rapidly across NE England. Newcastle has recorded a sharp rise in its weekly infection rate, up from 51.2 cases for every 100,000 people to 64.1 in the seven days to September 13</p>

<p>A total of around 12million people are now under under local restrictions. And Health Secretary Matt Hancock has raised the prospect of even more draconian steps, begging the public to 'come together to tackle this virus'.</p>

<p>Ministers are mulling a two-week nationwide halt that could see much of the hospitality industry shut - although no final decisions have been made as ministers wrangle over the effect on the economy.</p>

<p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak is believed to have raised concerns about the consequences of a full lockdown at a meeting yesterday. </p>
