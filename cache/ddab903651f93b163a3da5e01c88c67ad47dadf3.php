<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Technology stocks suffered fresh losses last night in a further sign that their extraordinary rally has run out of steam. </p>

<p>The tech-dominated Nasdaq, which has soared this year amid companies from Amazon to Zoom cashing in on the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, fell another 2.5 per cent in New York. </p>

<p>The benchmark has lost 8 per cent of its value in the two sessions since hitting a new record high on Wednesday – but it is still up more than 30 per cent this year. </p>

<p>In the red zone : The tech-dominated Nasdaq fell another 2.5 per cent in New York</p>

<p>The so-called 'Faang' stocks – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google owner Alphabet – were down between 2 per cent and 5 per cent while Microsoft fell 3 per cent and Zoom sank 5 per cent. Tesla fell sharply in early trading before recovering. It has lost 18 per cent of its value in the past four days. </p>

<p>Apple has fallen 12 per cent in just three days – and is no longer worth more than the entire FTSE 100 index as it was earlier this week. </p>

<p>The tech rout has also dented the fortunes of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott. Having become the first person to amass a fortune of $200bn, Bezos has seen his wealth slip back below that milestone, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. </p>

<p>The sell-off spread to other markets with the FTSE 100 index down 51.78 points to 5799.08. </p>

<p>Among the biggest losers in London were the tech-heavy Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, Polar Capital Technology Trust and Allianz Technology Trust, which fell up to 7 per cent. </p>

<p>Tech stocks have soared this year as the coronavirus crisis boosted online shopping via Amazon and demand for technology provided by the likes of Apple and Zoom. </p>

<p>Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at investment platform Willis Owen, said: 'If you don't take profits, the market will do it for you and it is important to remember that a profit is only a profit if you actually sell.' </p>
