<p>The group's social media accounts shared joyous messages as California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that would decrease probation sentences.</p>

<p>Making strides: Jay-Z, 50, and Meek Mill, 33, celebrated with their organization REFORM Alliance after California passed a law limiting probation sentences on Wednesday; shown in January 2019</p>

<p>Newsom signed AB 1950, a law that is intended to decrease California's incarcerated population.</p>

<p>Probation sentences will now be limited to a maximum of one year for misdemeanors and two years for felony convictions.</p>

<p>By shortening probation sentences, people convicted of misdemeanors and felonies will hopefully have fewer opportunities to reoffend.</p>

<p>Probation sentences have long been a target of criminal justice reformers, as offenders can be sent back to jail for offenses that would be acceptable if they weren't on probation, such as driving out of state without a probation officer's permission. </p>

<p>Less time: Probation sentences will now be limited to a maximum of one year for misdemeanors and two years for felony convictions, which could decrease future reoffending</p>

<p>Big push: REFORM was a major supporter of the bill and sent over 3,000 emails to Newsom's administration, according to TMZ</p>

<p>The group's post included an image of California with the state capitol building superimposed over it.</p>

<p>'MAJOR REFORM VICTORY! California enacts #AB1950. This bill will help put hundreds of thousands of Californians on probation in positions to succeed and exit the criminal justice system for good. Thank you <?php echo e('@'); ?>GavinNewsom!' the organization captioned its post.</p>

<p>In trouble: Meek was infamously sentenced to eight years of probation following a 2008 conviction for drug dealing and gun possession, and he had multiple run-ins due to his probation over minor violations; shown in February</p>

<p>The battle to decrease probation sentences is personal for Meek.</p>

<p>The rapper was infamously sentenced to eight years of probation following a 2008 conviction for drug dealing and gun possession.</p>

<p>He had multiple run-ins with the law for minor probation violations in the following years, and the judge, Genece Brinkley, was at one point investigated by the FBI for her conduct over the years with Meek's case.</p>

<p>Michael Rubin, who co-founded the group with the rappers, wrote on Twitter: </p>

<p><?php echo e('@'); ?>REFORM was inspired by my guy <?php echo e('@'); ?>MeekMill who spent his entire adult life on probation, going in and out of prison, for technical probations# violations (again, not committing a crime). The madness has to end and today was a huge step towards fixing this issue!</p>

<p>'This is just the beginning of our push to creating logical probation and parole laws in every state, while at the same time improving public safety and saving tax payers billions of dollars!!! LET’S GO!!!' he continued. </p>
