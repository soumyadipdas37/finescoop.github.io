<p>In light of COVID-19, the retailer is taking extra precautions to ensure team members and customers are safe during their shopping experience.</p>

<p>'We want to do our best during this challenging period to allow our customers to access service, advice and product when they need it,' it said on its website.</p>

<p>'We have expanded our cleaning routines across our stores, including increased cleaning throughout the day.</p>

<p>'Our teams have had additional training on maintaining good hygiene practices. To support this, stores may be operating a little differently than usual.'</p>

<p>All stores will allow a maximum of 100 people into each store at any given time - meaning larger stores will fall well within and smaller stores will meet the federal government's recommendations on social distancing. </p>

<p>Most stores are open but trading hours have changed so shoppers are advised to check the website for their local store.</p>

<p>A JB Hi-Fi employee has shared her top secrets to shopping at the electronics store - including getting the best discounts on products every time.</p>

<p>The Sydney employee took to TikTok to reveal the four 'hacks' you should know about.</p>

<p>'Tip number one, if you want to get served as soon as possible, go to the Apple desk because I can guarantee someone will come serve you ASAP,' she said.</p>

<p>'Hack number two, if you go into the store and they don't have the stock of the product, just tell them to transfer the stock in from another store.</p>

<p>'Number three, if you want a good price, ask for a discount or a good deal because we do give discounts.</p>

<p>'Last hack - don't wear a hoodie to JB HI-FI because we are most likely going to think you're stealing.'</p>
