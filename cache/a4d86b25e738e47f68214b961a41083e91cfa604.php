<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An on-the-run drugs suspect has won himself an army of female fans after he taunted police on Facebook by saying he'll hand himself in for £20,000. </p>

<p>Aaron Stephenson from Newbiggin is wanted as part of an investigation into drug supply. Crimestoppers offered a £1,000 reward for his capture on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But on Facebook, the brazen 27-year-old said he would 'double it' for anyone who didn't disclose his whereabouts and even tagged Northumbria Police in the post.</p>

<p>Female social media users jokingly offered to harbour the suspect, with one posting in response: 'Think half the lasses on here would offer you somewhere to hide'.</p>

<p>A third added: 'Phwaaaarrr will hide you in me cupboard bonny lad'. </p>

<p>The force said Stephenson is wanted in connection with 'a number of serious offences'. He is also subject to a crown court warrant.</p>

<p>Multiple addresses have been searched without success, promoting the charity to offer the reward for any tip-off that leads to his arrest and charge.</p>

<p>Detective Chief Inspector Martin Brooks, of Northumbria Police, said: 'We have made extensive enquiries in a bid to trace Aaron Stephenson and our efforts will continue until he is brought into custody.</p>

<p>'He is wanted in connection with a number of serious offences and we are asking members of the community who may know his whereabouts or who have recently seen him to come forward.</p>

<p>'Someone out there will know something and that may be the small detail that helps lead to an arrest.</p>

<p>'I would also appeal directly to Aaron to come forward and hand himself in and do the right thing.'</p>

<p>Stephenson posted online: 'All the money use have took n ya offering a GRAND times the c*** by 20 n al walk in me self.'</p>

<p>The suspect is described as white, around 5ft 10ins tall, with short brown hair and of medium build.</p>

<p>Ruth McNee, regional manager at Crimestoppers, said: 'If anyone has information on Aaron's whereabouts please remember that you can stay 100 per cent anonymous by calling our charity or by using our simple and secure anonymous online form.</p>

<p>'No one will ever know you contacted us.'</p>
