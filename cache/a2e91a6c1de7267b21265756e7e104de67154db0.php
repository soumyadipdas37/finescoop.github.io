<p>The British retailer advertised its printed border eyelet curtains at a reduced price of £5.99.</p>

<p>The bottom third of the drapes is a mustard yellow colour, while the rest is an off-white shade. </p>

<p>The way the eyelets are positioned causes the curtains to fall in waves which makes them look like 10 vertical cylinders - and people spied a likeness to a packet of 10 cigarettes.   </p>
