<p>Josh Dawson, 19, from Peterborough, shared images on his Twitter account of his accommodation at Derwent Halls at the University of York, saying: 'to be given a mattress like this in normal times would be disgusting, but in the Year of the Rona, this is just abhorrent.'</p>

<p>Negligent: The undergraduate slammed the University halls, which he says he's paying £6,000 to live in during his first term. Pictured: an iced-up freezer that greeted Dawson when he arrived at York University</p>

<p>He added: 'I can only assume that Uni of York don’t care about the health and safety of their students' and wrote that he was paying £6,000 to live in the accommodation. </p>

<p>In another tweet, an unimpressed Dawson wrote: 'They haven't checked the rooms for hygiene and they clearly haven't checked the kitchens either. What the f*** are they playing at?' </p>

<p>The University's Twitter account pointed the student to his 'College team' to report what he'd experienced and while he said staff at the university had been helpful, he added: 'This is negligence and I expect better, especially when I’m paying you £6k to live here.' </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted the University of York for comment. </p>

<p>Nearly 1,000 people have since liked Dawson's tweet, with many saying the University should apologise. </p>

All you hear on the radio at the moment is Uni staff harping on about how hard it all is for them....and they can't even look after their students. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!'  </p>
