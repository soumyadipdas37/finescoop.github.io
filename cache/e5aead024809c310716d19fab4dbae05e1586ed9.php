<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fights broke out in shopping aisles while queues spanned across entire car parks early on Wednesday morning as keen Aldi customers scrambled to get their hands on the beloved 16 litre air fryer costing just $149.</p>

<p>The discount supermarket was offering the kitchen gadget as part of their Special Buys program, which offers huge discounts on various products each week.</p>

<p>Stores across the country were thrown into chaos with eager shoppers lining up outside from as early as 5am.</p>

<p>Some even got on their hands and knees to crawl under the roller shutters as the doors were opened, desperate to be the first to buy the coveted fryer.</p>

<p>But after waiting hours on end many customers were devastated to find Aldi were low on stock, with the air fryers selling out within minutes.</p>

<p>One woman visiting the supermarket in Engadine in south Sydney said she was one of 200 people queuing up. </p>

<p>'Well there's 30 minutes of my life I won't get back! They only had 3... yes, 3... there were about 150-200 people in the line,' she wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>'That's the first &amp; last time I ever line up for something at Aldi!!!'</p>

<p>Another shopper at the Roselands Aldi in south west Sydney claimed a man shoved a woman with his trolley while he hurried to get his hands on the kitchen device.</p>

<p>'The absolutely disgusting behaviour by a horrid excuse of a male customer I just witnessed whom decided he should ram the lady next to me with his trolley because she wasn't running to the middle isle holding him up from getting his air fryer,' the shopper said.</p>

<p>'That's not ok! What has happened to people? It's very sad, all over a special buy.</p>

<p>'(Shoppers) were even crawling under the roller shutter as it was opening.'</p>

<p>One woman visiting the Aldi at Engadine in south Sydney waited for half an hour only to find all the air fryers had sold out (pictured, the queue before the store opened at 8.30am)</p>

<p>One employee said Special Buys days were also tough for those working at the stores.</p>

<p>'I'm recovering on my 30 minute break.... Absolutely appalling behaviour here and abuse... I hate days like these as an employee,' the staff member said.</p>

<p>Another shopper filmed the car park outside their local Aldi with customers queuing around the entire lot.</p>

<p>One furious shopper at Mount Barker in South Australia waited in line only to find out the four air fryers in stock had sold out within three minutes.</p>

<p>After an influx of complaints about little stock, Aldi Australia said COVID-19 had impacted the delivery of the air fryer.</p>

<p>'We apologise in advance for any disappointment this might cause our customers, and remind everyone to shop with kindness in this challenging time,' a spokesman said.</p>

<p>The air fryer was not in stock at all in Victoria to encourage people to follow COVID-19 regulations.</p>

<p>'What a joke. No, what a disgrace. Aldi you do this all the time. If you don't have enough stock say so,' one commented. </p>

<p>'This is the second time in months you’ve had an air fryer on sale and not a single one in sight,' another said. </p>

<p>Shoppers are seen at another Aldi on Wednesday morning. Many customers waited since the early hours of the morning in the hopes to get their hands on the beloved air fryer</p>
