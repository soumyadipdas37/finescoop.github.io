<p>An Australian professional cleaner and company director (pictured) has shared her industry secrets to transforming a grubby shower screen and bathroom to make it look sparkling new </p>

<p>Kacie, from Melbourne, shared videos on TikTok revealing she uses budget laundry products at home and while working</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use a non-scratch sponge with Gumption or Bar Keepers Friend to clean soap scum from a shower screen with ease </p></li>
<li><p>Always use a squeegee to remove water and then 'polish' or dry the glass with a microfibre cloth for sparkling results </p></li>
<li><p>For sparkling windows use the $37 Sabco window cleaning kit from Bunnings that comes with a 12.5 litre bucket with a lid and handle. Pair it with a microfibre window washer, stainless steel squeegee and a microfibre cloth for the perfect finish </p></li>
<li><p>Dishwashing liquid and water works very well to clean windows </p></li>
<li><p>The #1 Kmart product for cleaning is the 2 piece pack of microfibre glass cleaning cloths - they are hidden in the car section</p></li>
</ul>

<p>'If your shower screens have hard water stains or built up soap scum, I would use a non-scratch sponge with either Gumption (which is a paste) or Bar Keepers Friend (which is a powder),' she said in the video</p>

<p>'Both of those scrub onto the screen and wash off - as long as the glass isn't etched, it should come up pretty good.'</p>

<p>Gumption is priced at $5.40 and Bar Keepers Friend costs $8, with both available at Woolworths supermarkets. </p>

<p>Kacie also uses these products to clean other areas in the bathroom, such as the sink and bathtub, as they work exceptionally well.  </p>

<p>In one video she revealed how she uses Gumption and Bar Keepers Friend to clean shower screens </p>

<p>After applying and washing the products off with water, Kacie recommends using a squeegee to remove water and then 'polish' or dry the glass with a microfibre cloth.</p>

<p>Depending on how dirty the shower screen is, dishwashing liquid and a microfibre cloth also works well. </p>

<p>Kacie said cleaning the shower or bathroom doesn't need to be a complicated process, as it's quite simple if the correct products are used. </p>

<p>In another video Kacie also revealed she uses the $37 Sabco window cleaning kit from Bunnings Warehouse while working (pictured)</p>
