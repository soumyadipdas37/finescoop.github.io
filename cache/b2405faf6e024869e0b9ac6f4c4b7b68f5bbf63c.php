<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Hungarian government said on Wednesday that its official Twitter account had been suspended 'without any warning'.</p>

<p>'We have taken the necessary steps and are awaiting an official explanation from Twitter,' government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said on his own Twitter account.</p>

<p>Kovacs portrayed the suspension as an act of censorship against nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, saying: 'The beautiful new world has finally arrived, in which tech giants are silencing those who hold different opinions.'</p>

<p>Any attempt to access the account now prompts the message: 'User <?php echo e('@'); ?>abouthungary has been suspended.'</p>

<p>Hungary's other official social media channels seemed to be operating normally on Wednesday.</p>

<p>This year Twitter has removed or labelled several of US President Donald Trump's tweets, citing misinformation.</p>
