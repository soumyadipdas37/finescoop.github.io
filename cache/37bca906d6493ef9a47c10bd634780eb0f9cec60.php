<p>Bergeron had been with the Dancing With The Stars franchise since it launched in 2005, while his former co-host Andrews joined the show in 2014.</p>

<p>In an interview with Extra earlier this month, Andrews revealed that her and Tom's unexpected dismissals from Dancing With The Stars 'was a surprise' and that hers came via phone call.</p>

<p>She also offered her, 'sincere thanks to Tom and Erin, whom we will always consider part of the Dancing with the Stars' family.'</p>
