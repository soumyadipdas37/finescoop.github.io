<p>A grieving mother has also hit out at the government for its lack of empathy in responding to a request to bury her son's body.</p>

<p>Elena Turner, 72, had her request to travel into Queensland from New South Wales rejected to bury her son Wayne Turner, 49.</p>

<p>She was seeking to travel to Logan from Gulmarrad in regional NSW which is not considered a hot spot.</p>

<p>But she was told she would need to go into quarantine for 14 days, despite the fact southeast Queensland has active cases where Gulmarrad does not.</p>

<p>'Anyone from Logan can get to that funeral and they don't have any trouble. I would be less of a risk than anyone in the hot spots in Brisbane,' she told the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>Ms Turner received the rejection in a series of emails from Queensland Health.</p>

<p>'Under the current funeral protocol, attendees who arrive from overseas or interstate are required to undertaken the 14-day period of quarantine prior to attending the funeral service,' the email stated.</p>

<p>'While I appreciate that this was not the answer that you were hoping for, the public health directions and other measures implemented to respond to COVID-19 have been critical.' </p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk previously responded to criticism over strict border measures. </p>

<p>'We're dealing with a health pandemic,' she said.</p>

<p>'It is absolutely tragic. It is heartbreaking. Families are not together at the moment.'</p>

<p>But she said the official directives were coming from the States's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young, and she was unable to bend the rules. </p>
