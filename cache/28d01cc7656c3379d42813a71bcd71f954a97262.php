<p>Garrad already faces six counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years - with the youngest child being a one-year-old.</p>

<p>The offences allegedly took place between 2017 and 2020.</p>

<p>He also faces one count of possessing child abuse material.</p>

<p>Doyle faces two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years, two counts of produce child abuse material and two counts of possess/control child abuse material using carriage service.</p>

<p>Court documents allege a video was also made at a mid-north coast childcare centre.</p>

<p>Both men are being held in custody and will front court in October.</p>

<p>Garrad and Doyle were arrested as part of a wider police sting known as Operation Arkstone.</p>

<p>Seven other people from New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia have been arrested because of it. </p>

<p>'It is heartbreaking to think of any child being sexually abused, but it strengthens our resolve to hunt down perpetrators and bring them to justice.'</p>
