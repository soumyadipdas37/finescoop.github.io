<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kyle Richards' offered new evidence in her desperate hunt for her mother's stolen ring on Thursday night - an image of the bauble in her collection before it was robbed - to prove it is the same design she spotted on a psychic's hand in an Instagram photo shared by Diane Keaton. </p>

<p>The bizarre mystery prompted a slew of speculation after Richards, 51, detailed her shock at seeing the stolen valuable in a social media snap shared by the Oscar winner back in 2019 - two years after it was taken from the reality star's California mansion as part of a $1 million jewelry heist.</p>

<p>Richards made the revelation during the latest Secrets Revealed special of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and shortly after took to Instagram to shed further light on the 'crazy story' by sharing an image of the beloved heirloom in her jewelry box and comparing it to the bauble that was photographed by Keaton on the finger of a Los Angeles fortune teller.</p>

<p>Mystery: Kyle Richards posted an Instagram Stories video on Thursday night in which she addressed a bizarre story about spotting her stolen ring in a photo of a psychic's hand</p>

<p>Proof? The Real Housewives star revealed that the ring had been given to her mother Kathleen by her dad, while pointing out that the psychic's ring had gold 'rubbed off' in the same spot </p>

<p>'I got a lot of questions about the Secrets Revealed episode last night and the story about my mom's ring being stolen and my seeing the stolen ring on Diane Keaton's Instagram,' Richards explained in an Instagram Stories video.</p>

<p>'It is such a crazy story but I will post the picture that Diane posted and a picture of my mom's ring.'  </p>

<p>There it is! Richards shared a wider shot of her jewelry collection and pointed out the stolen ring, which was taken when her California home was burglarized in late 2017</p>

<p>Coincidence? The reality star was stunned to see her mother's ring (far right) in a picture that was shared on Instagram by Oscar-winner Diane Keaton back in July 2019  </p>

<p>On the hunt: Richards is desperate for information about the whereabouts of the psychic in the hopes of getting her ring back, and to get clues about where her $1 million jewelry collection is</p>

<p> 'Manifesting': The mother-of-three revealed that she took the picture of her jewelry store the night before she was burglarized because she wanted to 'remember exactly what she had'</p>

<p>Kyle Richards has launched a desperate hunt for a stolen family heirloom after she spotted the ring being worn by a psychic in a photo that was posted on Instagram by actress Diane Keaton. </p>

<p>The 51-year-old reality star unraveled the complicated tale in a new episode of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, recalling her shock at seeing the beloved ring, which had belonged to her late mother, on a psychic's finger, three years after it was taken from her Encino home as part of a $1 million heist.    </p>

<p>Richards lost dozens of sentimental family pieces in the robbery, and while police were investigating the crime, none of them had been found - until July 2019 when the reality star saw her mom Kathleen's ring in an image shared by Oscar-winner Keaton, who happened to capture it while snapping a photo of a psychic she saw in Santa Monica.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the identity of the psychic is not known - nor is it clear how the fortune teller came to own Richards' ring.  </p>

<p>'I was looking on Instagram and I saw Diane Keaton - she posted a picture of a psychic's hands on the Third Street Promenade and [she] had my ring on her hand,' Richards explained in a new Real Housewives Secrets Revealed special, according to TooFab. </p>

<p>Helping hand: The RHOBH star reached out to Keaton through her husband's real estate agency, however the actress was unable to offer any information about the fortune teller's identity </p>

<p>The image in question was posted to Keaton's Instagram account on July 13 last year and shows the unnamed woman's hands which are covered in different gold rings; she is also seen wearing a number of gold and silver bracelets while modeling very long rounded black nails. </p>

<p>Richards has not yet confirmed which of the seven rings in the image belonged to her mother.  </p>

<p>Desperate to try and find the psychic in question, the Bravo-lebrity reached out to Keaton through husband Mauricio Umansky's real estate company, The Agency.  </p>

<p>'We reached out to one of our agents at The Agency who happens to represent Diane Keaton, and I said, "You need to find out what the situation is."' </p>

<p>The agent in question spoke to Keaton, however she was unable to offer any more information. </p>

<p>According to Richards, Keaton explained to the agent that she didn't have any specific details about the fortune teller - revealing that she had only stopped to take the picture of the unnamed woman's hands because she thought her long black nails were 'so interesting'. </p>

<p>But while Keaton was unable to offer any specific information about the psychic - other than her location - Richards was determined not to let the lead go to waste, and she quickly enlisted a private investigator to try and track down the fortune teller.  </p>

<p>Important: The ring in question belonged to Richards' mother, Kathleen, and was one of many heirlooms stolen in the $1 million heist. Richards is seen with her mom and sister Kim in 1983</p>

<p>Crime scene: The ring was stolen from the stunning Encino home that Richards shares with her husband Mauricio Umansky (pictured), which was burglarized while they were in Aspen  </p>

<p>Family: Richards and Umansky bought the property for $8.2 million just months before the robbery, and the RHOBH star admitted that she was tempted to move after it happened </p>

<p>When the private investigator failed to find the woman, Richards took matters into her own hands and teamed up with her RHOBH co-star and close friend Teddi Mellencamp to try and locate her. </p>

<p>Their efforts proved fruitless however, with Mellencamp explaining in the RHOBH special: 'We thought we were hot on the trail but then we realized we were just being sent in circles.' </p>

<p>At that point, Richards had to give up the search in order to focus on filming for the latest season of the hit Bravo show, however she explained in the new episode that she is determined to resume the hunt and track down her stolen heirloom. </p>

<p>'I want to know if she bought that from someone at a pawn shop, even if I have to buy it back from her, I'm happy to do that,' she said.  </p>

<p>Richards' reignited search for her mother's stolen ring comes three years after the bauble was first stolen from the reality star's home along with dozens of other valuables and sentimental items worth a staggering $1 million. </p>

<p>The mother-of-four and her realtor husband were holidaying in Aspen when thieves broke into her Encino home, which the couple had purchased for $8.2 million just a few months prior. </p>

<p>Sentimental: Richards had planned to give the majority of the heirlooms that were stolen to her four daughters, Farrah, Portia, Alexia, and Sophia</p>

<p>Speaking about the devastating robbery in January 2018, Richards revealed that many of the items stolen during the heist were priceless family heirlooms that she had hoped to one day bequeath to her daughters, Farrah, Portia, Alexia, and Sophia, who were in Aspen with their parents when their home was burglarized. </p>

<p>The home robbery was so traumatic Richards actually considered moving out of the Encino property, she confessed to Bravo in 2018.</p>

<p>'There was one point after our house was burglarized that I thought, you know, I might have to sell my house - but then I look at my dogs and see how much they love this house and I think, "I could never leave,"' she explained.</p>

<p>In her first interview after the robbery, Richards told People that 'everything my mother, who passed away, had ever collected and saved to give to me - that I had always envisioned of passing on to my four daughters - was gone'. </p>

<p>She added: 'Even my children’s baby bracelets. Obviously, those are the things that hurt the most, things that I can't replace. They're completely invaluable.'</p>

<p>In a different People interview she shared that despite being one of three sisters she inherited 'the majority' of her mother's keepsakes when she passed away in March 2002.</p>

<p>As a result, when these valuables were stolen 'there was guilt attached to it. They got taken from me, from my house, on my watch'. </p>
