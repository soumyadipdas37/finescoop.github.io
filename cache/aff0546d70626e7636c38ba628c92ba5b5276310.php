<p>A Nations League dress rehearsal for the main event saw the sides draw 1-1 behind closed doors at Hampden last night.</p>

<p>Steve Clarke has urged UEFA and the Scottish government to let fans into Hampden for their crucial Euro 2020 play-off against Israel next month</p>

<p>Despite Monday's second leg of the double header trip in the Czech Republic, however, focus has already turned to the critical rematch with the Israelis on October 8.</p>

<p>And, with the Scottish Government poised to give the green light to test events for the return of a restricted number of fans to SPFL grounds next weekend, Clarke appealed to the powerbrokers to ease coronavirus restrictions before the play-off semi-final.</p>

<p>'I'd like to think there will be a crowd at the play-off, some sort of crowd inside the stadium to help the atmosphere.</p>

<p>'I think it would be helpful for any game as I'm a big believer that football is a game for spectators.</p>

<p>'You need the fans there to push you on.</p>

<p>Clarke says having the Tartan army roaring them on will give them the boost needed</p>

<p>'Maybe in the second half tonight we sat in a little too deep because we were so comfortable in the game defensively. We went to sleep on a throw-in and got heavily punished for it.</p>

<p>'I think if the fans are in here in the stadium they're shouting and pushing you up the pitch and driving you on. So yeah, it would make a difference.'</p>

<p>While players have become used to performing without fans in grounds Scotland's first game in ten months was a first behind closed doors for the manager. Admitting the game was a mixed bag Clarke added: 'It was very surreal. From the moment we left the hotel, the players were on one bus and the staff were on a different bus.</p>

<p>'We drove into the stadium and there was almost nobody here.</p>

<p>'Then during the game it has a little bit of a training ground feel to it.</p>

<p>'But I thought both teams acquitted themselves well. It probably wasn't the most exciting game to watch but it was quite tactical.'</p>

<p>Scotland drew 1-1 with future play-off opponents Israel on Friday, with Ryan Christie scoringÂ </p>

<p>Scotland grabbed the opening goal from the penalty spot in 43 minutes when John McGinn was clattered in the area.</p>

<p>Despite a better performance in the second half and a heartening debut for Lyndon Dykes up front Clarke's decision to field Kieran Tierney and Andrew Robertson in a 3-4-2-1 formation failed to claim all three points on the first step towards Qatar 2022.</p>

<p>With all still to play for in the quest to reach a delayed Euro 2020 finals, however, Clarke acknowledged: 'Both teams have now had a little look at each other ahead of the play-off.</p>

<p>Clarke acknowledged both teams had a chance to look at each other ahead of the face off</p>

<p>'We both played strong teams so it wasn't as though there was anybody kidding on or hiding. Both teams played for the points.</p>

<p>'Between now and next month's game we'll both have a look at the video to see what we can do.</p>

<p>'But our next game is the Czech Republic away and they had a good win tonight. We go there expecting a difficult game but we hope to get a result.'</p>
