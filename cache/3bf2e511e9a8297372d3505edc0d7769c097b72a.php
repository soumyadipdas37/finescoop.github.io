<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bec Cvilikas may have just let slip a major clue about who wins The Bachelor.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old, who was eliminated on Wednesday's episode, told The Kyle and Jackie O Show that she won't be watching Thursday's season finale with Bella Varelis - who is still in the running for Locky Gilbert's heart - despite them being flatmates.</p>

<p>Her admission raises the possibility that Bella, 25, isn't having a viewing party with her best friend because she'll instead be watching the episode privately with Locky.</p>

<p>Whoops! The Bachelor's Bec Cvilikas (centre), who was eliminated on Wednesday's episode, dropped a major spoiler on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday. Pictured with Kyle Sandilands (left) and Jackie 'O' Henderson (right)</p>

<p>'We won't be [watching together], no. We'll be separate tonight,' she confessed. </p>

<p>When asked to explain what she meant by that, Bec replied: 'Oh, you know... we're just going to watch it separately. Emotional one for everyone tonight, I imagine. It's going to be very full on.'</p>

<p>This left radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson wondering whether Bella will be watching the finale with Locky instead - therefore making her the winner.   </p>

<p>'You're screwing with me, because when you said you weren't going to be watching with Bella tonight, it made me think, "Oh my god, that means Bella's watching with Locky!"' Jackie exclaimed. </p>

<p>Wait... what?! Bec, 25, said she won't be watching Thursday's season finale with Bella Varelis (right) - who is still in the running for Locky Gilbert's heart - despite them being flatmates </p>

<p>Bella winning would come as a surprise to many viewers because Irena Srbinovska, 31, has been the bookies' favourite since the start of the season.  </p>

<p>However, Bec muddied the waters later in the interview when she said that she and Bella 'will probably continue living together' in their Sydney apartment even if Bella wins - despite the fact Locky lives in Perth.</p>

<p>It is very telling that Bec believes Bella would rather live with her than move to the other side of the country for Locky.</p>

<p>Major hint? Her admission raises the possibility that Bella, 25, isn't having a viewing party with her best friend because she'll instead be watching the episode privately with Locky (left)</p>

<p>In a dramatic trailer for Thursday's finale, Locky breaks down in tears as he's forced to make the heartbreaking decision to let one woman go and pick his winner.</p>

<p>The decision is even more difficult given that the teaser shows him confidently telling both beauties that he's falling in love with them on their final dates together.</p>

<p>An emotional Locky tells producers: 'I thought I would come here and meet one person that I like and then end up together. But I found two!</p>

<p>'They are two of the most incredible women that I've ever met in my entire life.' </p>

<p>The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10</p>

<p>Defying the odds! Bella winning would come as a surprise to many viewers because Irena Srbinovska (pictured) has been the bookies' favourite since the start of the season</p>
