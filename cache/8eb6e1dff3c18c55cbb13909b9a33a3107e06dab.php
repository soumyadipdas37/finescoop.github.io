<p>'President <?php echo e('@'); ?>realDonaldTrump will visit California on Monday where he will be briefed on the state's wildfires,' White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere wrote Saturday on Twitter.</p>

<p>Trump leaves for Nevada on Saturday afternoon for two days of campaign events, where he'll look to skid around coronavirus restrictions to hold rallies for his supporters.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump will visit California on Monday to be briefed on the wildfires there</p>

<p>More than 746,000 acres in California have burned, including the Bobcat Fire (above) in the woods in the Angeles National Forest north of Monrovia</p>

<p>Following that, he'll visit McClellan Park in Sacramento County on Monday, which has served as a base for CALFire operations, Fox 11 in Los Angeles reported.</p>

<p>The White House has touted its support for the first responders and fire fighters in the state. </p>

<p>'THANK YOU to the 28,000+ Firefighters and other First Responders who are battling wildfires across California, Oregon, and Washington. I have approved 37 Stafford Act Declarations, including Fire Management Grants to support their brave work. We are with them all the way!,' Trump tweeted on Friday night.</p>

<p>President Trump visited California after the 2018 wildfires, touring the area with then-Governor Jerry Brown and then Governor-Elect Gavin Newsom. </p>

<p>It is unclear if Newsom will join the president for this trip. The two men do not get along but have spoke on the phone Friday about the roaring fires devastating the West Coast.</p>

<p>At least 20 have been killed in California, eight in Oregon and one in Washington state as thousands of firefighters struggle to bring the blazes under control. Four people have been arrested on arson charges.</p>

<p>Images out of the California show orange skies, damaged property, and smoke-filled scenes. </p>

<p>More than 20,000 firefighters are battling the blazes. </p>

<p>Officials are bracing for more casualties.</p>

<p>'We anticipate that number (of deaths) may potentially go up as we get back into areas that have been ravaged by flame and obviously, smoke begins to clear,' warned Newsom, as he visited a scorched forest near the raging North Complex Fire on Friday.</p>

<p>The map above shows 103 fires that have already burned more than 3.4 million acres across the western United States</p>

<p>The August Complex Fire this week became by far the biggest recorded blaze in Californian history, ripping through 746,000 acres of dry vegetation in the state's north, as multiple fires combined.</p>

<p>But it is just one of around 100 large fires on the West Coast, and other rapidly growing blazes closer to populated areas have proven deadlier.</p>
