<p>The 81-year-old, whose name has been given only as Richard, bravely battled the deadly disease at the Gold Coast University Hospital in Queensland, spending three months from March to June on and off a ventilator.</p>

<p>Carnival's Ruby Princess cruise ship (pictured) has been linked to more than 660 COVID-19 cases and 28 deaths</p>

<p>'I want to make special mention today of Richard,' Mr Miles said on Friday.</p>

<p>'He knows better than anyone just how awful this disease can be, how great our hospital services are at saving lives from COVID but also how long it can take to recover.'</p>

<p>Although Richard spent more time in ICU battling coronavirus than any other patient in Queensland, a NSW woman holds the unenviable Australian record. </p>

<p>Last month, a scathing report into the public health blunder launched in April, described the failings of state government as 'inexcusable' and 'inexplicable'.</p>

<p>The investigation led by barrister Bret Walker concluded that all passengers should have been tested for coronavirus and ordered to undergo a mandatory period of quarantine.</p>

<p>But health officials deemed the ship 'low risk' and gave the okay for passengers to travel freely into the community. </p>

<p>The state of Queensland recorded only two new infections of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1,145.</p>

<p>'Both of them were in quarantine and were known to be direct contacts of already confirmed cases,' Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.</p>

<p>'One of them, the seventh member of a household, all who now have had COVID-19 but who were in quarantine and the other a confirmed community contact of a case.'</p>
