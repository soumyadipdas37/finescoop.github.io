<p>Phil Mummert, 28, was surfing at Bunker Bay, south of Perth, when the huge shark bit his right thigh and took a chunk off his surfboard on July 31. </p>

<p>He was left with a large gnash about 150mm deep where the shark's teeth penetrated through his skin. </p>

<p>Phil Mummert (right), 28, was surfing at Bunker Bay, in the Bunker Bay, south of Perth, when the five-metre shark bit his right thigh and took a chunk of his surfboard around 2.15pm on July 31 (pictured with girlfriend Ms Wright)</p>

<p>'It's not easy getting back in the ocean after being attacked by a five metre Great White,' she captioned the photo.</p>

<p>'Splashing around in the shallow end of the Ningaloo reef is probably the best way to do it.' </p>

<p>Ms Wright previously shared a photo of Mr Mummert smiling in a hospital bed following his encounter with the great white, thanking those who came to his rescue. </p>

<p>'I honestly don't know how a person can see a total stranger getting attacked by a four-metre great white shark and swim towards to save him so we are beyond grateful to everyone that helped save Phil's life,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'So lucky that Phil got away with his life and limbs and beyond lucky that we live in such a kind and caring community.</p>

<p>'So thankful for everyone who carried him to shore and for the ones that held his leg together for half an hour while waiting for the ambulance.</p>

<p>'Thank you from the bottom of our hearts,' she said. </p>

<p>Mr Mummert's long gnash was about 150mm deep following the shark's penetration (pictured)</p>

<p>One of Mr Mummert's rescuers recounted how quickly the brutal attack unfolded.</p>

<p>'He's just sitting on his board and the next thing you know we just heard someone go 'shark',' he said. </p>

<p>'I turned around and I've just seen this white (shark) kind of breach and it had already smashed, hit Phil.</p>

<p>'It just obliterated his board, it was just floating there like icicles.'</p>

<p>The five-metre great white shark also bit Mr Mummert's board in half (pictured) during the attack on July 31</p>

<p>Another surfer who came to Mr Mummert's aid, Jess Woolhouse, said it was a 'life or death' situation.</p>

<p>'We all sort of made an effort to get him onto the board and start heading in just sort of yelling and trying to splash the water,' he explained.</p>

<p>Mr Woolhouse said a group of six or seven people had also formed on the beach and it was a community effort to help Mr Mummert to shore.</p>

<p>He explained Mr Mummert was in good spirits and his bleeding had slowed down before he was taken to hospital.</p>
