<p>The man, a trained solicitor who has mental health disabilities and is currently unemployed, saidÂ his parents had 'nurtured his dependency' on them and that he was vulnerable.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old from London said his parents had recently 'significantly reduced' the financial support they had given down the years after his relationship with them deteriorated.</p>

<p>The man, who has not been identified, wanted a judge to rule they should continue to support him.</p>

<p>Lawyers representing the man argued that a judge had powers to order parents to provide support and cited laws relating to marriage and children.</p>

<p>His parents said the claim should be dismissed.</p>

<p>A trained solicitor has failed in a bid to force his wealthy parents to keep supporting him, in a case described as 'most unusual' by a judge. Library image of a wallet with money in it</p>

<p>Sir James Munby ruled against the man after considering arguments at a remote family court hearing.</p>

<p>He ruled that the man had 'no case'.</p>

<p>The judge, who outlined detail of the case in a ruling published online on Wednesday, described the claim as 'most unusual' and, as far as he knew, 'unprecedented'.</p>

<p>Sir James has not named the people involved, but said the man lived in London and his parents in Dubai.</p>

<p>'His parents have supported him financially down the years and continue, to some extent, to do so,' said Sir James in his ruling.</p>

<p>'They have permitted him to live in a flat in central London, of which they are the registered proprietors, and in relation to which they have until recently been paying the utility bills.</p>

<p>'Of late... the relationship between the applicant and his parents - in particular, it would appear, his father - has deteriorated and the financial support they are prepared to offer has significantly reduced.</p>

<p>'He characterises their stance as seemingly being that, having in fact - whether wittingly or unwittingly - nurtured his dependency on them for the last 20 years or so - with the consequence that he is, so it is said, now completely dependent on them - they now seek to cast that dependency on to the state.'</p>

<p>The judge said he was satisfied the man had 'no case' and added: 'His applications should be summarily dismissed.'</p>
