<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former prison inmate has shared the horrific story of when he was allegedly groomed and raped by a guard at just 16 years old.  </p>

<p>Jamie, now 42, was placed in a New South Wales youth detention centre almost 30 years ago and said he was 'bullied' for his disability and unusual hair colour. </p>

<p>The 42-year-old, who changed his name to avoid being identified, claimed one of the guards gave him extra cigarettes before repeatedly raping him for six months. </p>

<p>Jamie has now filed a statement of claim with the NSW Supreme Court and shared gruesome details of the allegations for the first time, news.com.au reported.  </p>

<p>Jamie, 42, has filed a claim to the NSW Supreme Court (pictured) after he was allegedly groomed and raped by a NSW prison guard at 16-years-old in juvenile detention </p>

<p>He claimed the guard 'took a liking' to him after he was 'bullied' (file image pictured). He claimed the guard gave him extra cigarettes before raping him over a six-month period</p>

<p>The 42-year-old said he was 'in juvie for mucking up' and quickly became an 'outcast' and a 'loner'. </p>

<p>Jamie claimed one of the prison guards 'took a liking' to him and began giving him more than the permitted six cigarettes per day.    </p>

<p>'We'd get locked down at night and he'd come sit down and talk with me. That's when the abuse started.</p>

<p>'I kept it myself. Way back then, gay people used to get bashed. I was scared if I said anything it would end up bad for me,' Jamie explained.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old said he didn't speak up about the repeated abuse because the man who allegedly raped him told him not to. </p>

<p>'He just said, "imagine if anybody found out" and "I wouldn't be here to protect you",' Jamie explained. </p>

<p>Jamie also claimed the prison manager knew about the abuse and would taunt the then-16-year-old with questions and sly comments.  </p>

<p>The 42-year-old said the experience had left him struggling to hold down a job, with bad nightmares and a drug addiction.    </p>

<p>Jamie is suing for damages, interest and the costs associated with his life and after prison. His lawyers will meet with lawyers for the state of NSW on Thursday.</p>

<p>Jamie is suing for damages, interest and the costs associated with his life after prison. His lawyers will meet with lawyers for NSW on Thursday (NSW Supreme Court pictured) </p>

<p>But his lawyer Sheree Buchanan, an abuse law specialist at Shine Lawyers, said a particular piece of legislation in NSW places victims at a disadvantage.  </p>

<p>The Civil Liability Act was amended in 2004 so people injured in custody must prove a 'permanent impairment' that is above a 15 per cent threshold to be compensated.  </p>

<p>Ms Buchanan said it was made to 'prevent fanciful claims' but it was 'offensive' to survivors of sexual abuse. </p>

<p>Shine Lawyers wrote a letter to the NSW Attorney-General Mark Speakman and asked for the legislation be amended in May. </p>

<p>Mr Speakman told Daily Mail Australia the NSW Government 'acted swiftly to implement all of the civil justice recommendations of the Child Abuse Royal Commission'. </p>

<p>When contacted by Shine Lawyers he 'sought urgent advice from the Department of Communities and Justice' and 'the Department is currently considering options for potential reform'.   </p>

<p>Lawyers for the State of NSW have filed documents to the Supreme Court that do not admit to Jamie's claims that he was abused in custody. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Shine Lawyers for comment.   </p>
