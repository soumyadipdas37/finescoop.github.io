<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gwyneth Paltrow has saved all of her iconic red carpet outfits for her daughter.</p>

<p>The 47-year-old actress - who has daughter Apple, 16, and son Moses, 14, with ex-husband Chris Martin - has made headlines with her dazzling outfits over the years, and she has been saving her best looks for her 'beauty queen' daughter for the past few decades.</p>

<p>'She loves to play in my closet. I have saved everything for her since 15 years before I had her. I save everything. Not everything, but every red carpet look I have saved for her,' the Sliding Doors actress told People.</p>

<p>For my kid; Gwyneth Paltrow has saved all of her iconic red carpet outfits for her daughter. Seen with mom Blythe Danner and daughter Apple in 2019</p>

<p>She sure knows how to look like a princess: Some of the Iron Man star's most iconic looks include her Oscar dress from 1999, left, and this Oscar gown in 2015, right</p>

<p>So Grace Kelly! Here the siren is seen in 2004. 'She loves to play in my closet. I have saved everything for her since 15 years before I had her. I save everything. Not everything, but every red carpet look I have saved for her,' the Sliding Doors actress told People</p>

<p>The teen fashionista recently helped her movie star mother launch the July Core Collection of Goop's clothing line by stepping in for the models who were staying at home amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>However, the Iron Man star believes her lookalike daughter is more 'glamorous in a way that I'm not.'</p>

<p>She added: 'She's very, very into makeup, which I'm not. She knows how to do it perfect winged eyeliner. She gave herself acrylic nails. She's a beauty queen.'</p>

<p>More looks: The teen fashionista recently helped her movie star mother launch the July Core Collection of Goop's clothing line by stepping in for the models who were staying at home amid the coronavirus pandemic. In both images she is seen in 2002</p>

<p>The dynamic duo before they split: Actors Brad Pitt and Paltrow at film premiere of his The Devil's Own in 1997</p>

<p>A fun look for summer: Seen in 2004 for the premiere of Sky Captain Of The World</p>

<p>A more recent look: In 2018 for the Avengers: Infinity War film premiere in Los Angeles</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gwyneth has insisted things are much better with her former husband, Chris, now they are divorced as they have learned a lot about their relationship together and they have 'radical accountability' now.</p>

<p>She said recently: 'I mean it's so interesting because in a way my divorce and my relationship with Chris now is better than our marriage was. </p>

<p>'So I do think that it can be done. I was really lucky because I had a doctor who kind of gave us a rubric for how to do it and luckily he's writing a book and I think it's coming out next year, thank goodness, because it really kind of lays out the tenants of how you do it and it's a little bit unsurprising right?</p>

<p>The trio: Here Apple is seen again with her mother as well as Danner as Brad Falchuk takes the snapshot</p>

<p>She sure has mom's looks: Apple seen at home in a little floral dress</p>

<p>'You have to have radical accountability. You have to know that every relationship is 50/50. No matter what you think, how you think you were wronged, or how bad you perceive the other persons actions, or whatever the case may be. </p>

<p>'If you are brave enough to take responsibility for your half and really look at your own garbage and your own trauma and how it's presenting in the world and in your relationship then there really is somewhere to go and something to learn and something to heal. </p>

<p>'You are also holding the other person in this sphere of humanity. We are all part good and part bad, it's not binary, we are all grey area.'</p>

<p>She plugs on: In addition to her acting career, Gwyneth runs her GOOP empire</p>
