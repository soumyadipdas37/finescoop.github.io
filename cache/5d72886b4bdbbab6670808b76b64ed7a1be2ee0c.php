<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Savvy flatmates who launched a gut health business during the coronavirus pandemic have made $250,000 as lockdown spending boomed. </p>

<p>Reever Botha and Vlad Kosovac launched PuraU in March this year as Australians were ordered to stay home due to the COVID-19 outbreak. </p>

<p>But the timing couldn't have been better for the 25-year-old business partners, who earned $25,000 in the first three weeks their product was on the market. </p>

<p>Mr Botha said it was 'daunting' launching their Gut Cleanse Kit as the pandemic took hold, but the pair went on 'full steam ahead'.</p>

<p>Model Tasha Ross (pictured) poses with the PuraU products in a picture she posted to Instagram. She wrote: 'These little goodies have been helping to boost my immune system, especially after I had been so sick'</p>

<p>'We're happy to say we launched through COVID,' he told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'It was a shinning light for us, E-commerce has boomed. People are at home and have the opportunity to buy things on their phone.'</p>

<p>Mr Kosovac said the global health crisis meant the business partners needed to refocus their launch plan.</p>

<p>'We initially said we need to work a lot smarter, use the pandemic as a strategy.  It was about acing our marketing,' he said.</p>

<p>After four months, the business made $250,000.  </p>

<p>It's been a 'stressful' road to success for the pair, who first met at a business seminar in Sydney. </p>

<p>Mr Botha had completed a bachelor of business management at Queensland University of Technology and begun to attend seminars in the field.  </p>

<p>'I knew I wanted to have my own business, I didn't want to go down the corporate path,' he explained.   </p>

<p>The pair 'bonded' at the seminar and kept in contact for a couple of months.</p>

<p>They met for coffee in Brisbane and the rest is history. </p>

<p>'F*** it dude,' Mr Botha recalled. 'Let's start our business together'. </p>

<p>The pair quickly decided to focus their product on digestion, as they are both passionate about health and fitness.   </p>

<p>'Our guts have been rotten our whole life. So that's one thing we're passionate about, so we thought lets smash it out of the park,' Mr Botha said.  </p>

<p>The pills - which are vegan and Australian made - can relieve acne, eczema, rosacea, bloating, indigestion, gassiness and gut inflammation</p>

<p>Mr Kosovac, who is from Melbourne, then moved to Queensland to live with Mr Botha in his parents' Brisbane home. </p>

<p>While he misses Melbourne, Mr Kosovac said he would have moved anywhere for the benefit of the business.</p>

<p>'I gotta do what's best for the business. It didn't matter where,' he said. </p>

<p>The business partners spent about six months conducting research and developing a plan. They then found a manufacturer and received approval from Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).</p>

<p>The pair run the business from Mr Botha's family home and a mini-warehouse but are concerned they're running out of space as the business continues to take off.</p>

<p>'We found it harder the more we grew, this house isn't ginormous. We have to go downstairs, ship the products,' Mr Kosovac said.</p>

<p>After four months, the business made $250,000. Pictured: Evelien Langeveld with the product </p>

<p>Mr Botha added: 'When we started growing phenomenally, I was very nervous.</p>

<p>'We don't have the processes in place to meet the growth.'</p>

<p>The pair, who are 'taking every day as it comes', are seeking a commercial warehouse and are looking to hire. </p>

<p>'We're happy,' Mr Botha said.</p>

<p>'We spent a lot of time money and effort for 12 months without seeing a return. </p>

<p>'There were times when we wanted to give up. We're just happy we've stuck with it, we've done everything right.' </p>

<p>Mr Kosovac said the global health crisis meant the business partners needed to refocus their launch plan. 'We initially said we need to work a lot smarter, use the pandemic as a strategy. It was about acing our marketing,' he said</p>

<p>The pair are now hoping to take their business into retail, with their sights set on Priceline. </p>

<p>The PuraU three-part Gut Cleanse Kit supports natural cleansing and a healthy immune system.</p>

<p>The pills - which are vegan and Australian made - can relieve acne, eczema, rosacea, bloating, indigestion, gassiness and gut inflammation.  </p>

<p>All PuraU products have been developed by a naturopathic and herbal expert and the goods were permitted for use by the TGA.  </p>

<p>The website reads: 'Good people deserve good guts'.  </p>

<p>'We're here to help you calm those gut gremlins and get your insides feeling shipshape'.  </p>

<p>Mr Botha concluded: 'Throughout this pandemic, it's shown why people should be on top of their health.'    </p>
