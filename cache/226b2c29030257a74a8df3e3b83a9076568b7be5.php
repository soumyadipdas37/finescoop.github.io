<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Genoa have completed the loan signings of Davide Zappacosta from Chelsea and Marko Pjaca from Juventus, </p>

<p>The 28-year-old has fallen out of favour in west London and the club are actively attempting to ship him out again in the current window. </p>

<p>Zappacosta represented the Bergamo outfit between 2011 and 2015 before moving to Torino - and it was from there that he completed his swoop to Chelsea.</p>

<p> Genoa have have completed the loan signing of Davide Zappacosta from Chelsea</p>

<p>The full-back has struggled with limited playing time and has also been rocked by a host of injuries.</p>

<p>Chelsea are believed to be keen to be seeking a permanent solution for Zappacosta, whose current deal runs down in 2022, during the current market.</p>

<p>His torn anterior cruciate ligament injury last October while on loan at Roma prevented him from being able to impress, and just seven top flight appearances then followed. </p>

<p>Zappacosta's loan had initially been until January, but both parties agreed an extension until the end of the elongated season. </p>

<p>Zappacosta had played for Atalanta between 2011 and 2015 before making the move to Torino</p>

<p>The 28-year-old spent last season with Roma but torn his anterior cruciate ligament in October</p>

<p>And it appears increasingly unlikely there is any way back for the Italian at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>Frank Lampard has overhauled his team with a sensational spending spree this summer, although both captain Cesar Azpilicueta and Reece James will remain his first choices on the right side of defence. </p>

<p>Like Zappacosta, Pjaca has been on a series of loan moves and saw his career stalled by injuries.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old was purchased by Juventus from Dinamo Zagreb for €23m in 2016, but went on loans to Schalke 04, Fiorentina and most recently RSC Anderlecht.</p>
