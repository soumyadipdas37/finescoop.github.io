<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Aussie food reviewer has posted an image of a jar of white Nutella, sending his followers into a frenzy. </p>

<p>Blogger 'Bruce Super Convenience' shared a picture of the iconic spread with one key difference to his Instagram. </p>

<p>The filling inside was a creamy white instead of the traditional hazelnut milk chocolate flavour.</p>

<p>'Let's just take a moment to look at this picture, and appreciate this unicorn of a snack,' said the reviewer. </p>

<p>Prominent Australian food blogger 'Bruce Super Convenience' shared a picture to his Instagram of a jar of the iconic spread with one key difference</p>

<p>'This jar, with that logo so famous, is found on shelves ALL over the world. But alas, it's always a dark brown colour ... milk chocolate flavour.</p>

<p>'This one has a white - slightly golden - colour, and even look at the toast in the picture, it has a white spread on it!' </p>

<p>The reviewer told followers he had been sent a sample of the product by fellow food blogger The Snack Controller.  </p>

<p>But much to the disappointment of fans he also revealed the delicious snack was not available for purchase.</p>

<p>'Ok, I'm going to be bombarded with messages and DM's, so let me answer right now - no, this is not a real product, and no, you cannot buy your body's weight of this product!'</p>

<p>Hundreds of fans have been going wild over the prospect of white Nutella since the image began circulating on social media. </p>

<p>Fans will have to settle for the original hazelnut flavour Nutella instead</p>

<p>'This is a dream come true,' one woman wrote.</p>

<p>'My brain cant handle it... but it's beautiful,' another said.</p>

<p>The product was crafted and made by Queensland food blogger 'The Snack Controller' using a recipe from another Instagrammer - 'aufstrichqueen_vera'. </p>

<p>He combined two blocks of white chocolate, a bag of Kinder white Schokobons, a scoop of hazelnut butter with a drizzle of the oil, hazelnut syrup and regular  sunflower oil.</p>

<p>He also gave fans a few tips for the best ways to eat it.  </p>
