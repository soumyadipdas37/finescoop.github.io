<p>Location, location, location: Lisa Armstrong has snapped up a smart new five-bedroom home near her ex-husband Ant McPartlin in west London – and it's set her back a cool £3.85million. Pictured in April 2019</p>

<p>The kitchen doors open out onto an impressive 226ft terraced garden, which winds its way all the way down to the Thames - but not before Lisa and her guests have options to dine al fresco in the tastefully styled space.</p>

<p>And Lisa will likely settle into the property's impressive master suite, which offers a large en-suite bathroom and a Juliet balcony overlooking the sprawling outdoor green space.</p>

<p>Thanks to its many large windows and skylights, the house is bathed in abundant sunlight, further giving the living space a fresh and open feeling. </p>

<p>The unveiling of Lisa's new property comes after she was seen taking the final steps in her split from Ant on Friday as her belongings were removed from their £5million former marital home. </p>

<p>Last week, the makeup artist, who has resumed work on Strictly Come Dancing and just released a cosmetics line, made a bold statement as she left her ex's unwanted possessions on the pavement for passers-by to take.  </p>

<p>Lisa split from Ant in 2018 after 12 years of marriage, and is now reported to be dating James Green. Lisa and Ant, who is now dating Anne-Marie Corbett, finalised their £62million divorce in April after their split in January 2018. </p>

<p>Lisa, who received £31million in her divorce settlement from Ant, was clearing out the home of all beloved possessions, including her gym equipment. </p>

<p>All the details: Adding to the feeling of luxury, the property also boasts a huge dine-in kitchen, fitted with marble counter tops</p>

<p>Lovely bubbly bath: Lisa has the choice of four bathrooms to use in the house, which also benefits from a pair of cloakrooms</p>

<p>Last week, in another stage of her moving process, she placed the goods in boxes marked 'help yourself' and put them outside her west London property as she prepared to move out of the former marital home.</p>

<p>The items were easily identifiable as Ant's because they included his Newcastle United shirts and a 'Team Ant' foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway. There was also Ant's old dressing gown and a pile of board games. </p>

<p>No longer needed was Piers Morgan's book The Insider and Lisa threw in her own Craig Revel Horwood's Tales from the Dance Floor. </p>

<p>She was also throwing out a bowl used by their beloved Labrador, Hurley, as well as a Banksy artwork calendar and a Jamie Oliver book. </p>

<p>Abundant light: Thanks to its many large windows and skylights, the house is bathed in abundant sunlight, further giving the living space a fresh and open feeling</p>

<p>Removal: The unveiling of Lisa's new property comes after she was seen taking the final steps in her split from Ant on Friday as her belongings were removed from their £5million former marital home</p>

<p>Zen: While the house sits in a prime London location, it also benefits from feeling like a world away from the bustle of the city</p>

<p>A source told The Sun Lisa is leaving her West London house and wanted a 'big clear out.' They added: 'Ant had already sifted through what he wanted to keep and had gophers collect them in recent weeks. </p>

<p>'What was left is being offered for free. His bathrobe has been taken. Footie memorabilia has also been given away. But it was the end for his Newcastle shirts.'    </p>

<p>Last week, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said he did not agree with Lisa's decision to throw out these possessions, even though she is divorced.</p>

<p>He was particularly astonished to see she had thrown out his book.</p>

<p>All over: Lisa and AntMcPartlin  finalised their divorce back in April after their split in January 2018, following the presenter's highly documented battle with painkillers and alcohol</p>

<p>New me! Last week, Lisa showed off her blonder locks as she headed back to work on hit BBC show Strictly Come Dancing</p>

<p>Piers told co-host Susanna Reid and the audience: 'Ant McPartlin’s ex Lisa Armstrong – who is a wonderful makeup artist, she does my makeup on Life Stories.</p>

<p>'And I thought we were friends. I really did. I was quite friendly with Ant. Apparently this is stuff that Ant himself didn’t want back.</p>

<p>'These are the unwanted items that neither of them ever wanted to see again. There were things you’d expect, like Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales From the Dancefloor. Wholly understandable.</p>

<p>'His Newcastle shirt. I wouldn’t want to keep them either. A Team Ant foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway. Again, why would you want that?</p>

<p>Moving on: Ant and Anne-Marie Corbett are now an item, and are often seen out and about together. Pictured this month</p>
