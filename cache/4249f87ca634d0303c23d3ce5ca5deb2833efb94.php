<p>Ouch: The Block's Harry Pavlou suffered an injury on site during Monday's episode of the renovation show, which left him unable to work after breaking his foot</p>

<p>Initially thinking he'd only 'sprained' his ankle, Harry decided to get it checked out by a doctor, after deeming himself 'immobile'.  </p>

<p>But a visit to the doctor revealed Harry had actually broken his foot, and he decided to curl up in bed, feeling sorry for himself.</p>

<p>'If I don't stay off it, the bone could die and I could lose part of my foot,' he told the show's producers.</p>

<p>Taking a fall: The 57-year-old IT manager was walking across the building site when he fell and badly injured himself</p>

<p>'In my haste and rush to get the room finished, I stood on an uneven piece of ground and I rolled my ankle,' explained Harry</p>

<p>Host Scott Cam revealed Harry was under 'strict instructions to stay off his foot', with foreman Keith Schleiger stopping by to check in on him.</p>

<p>'Oh, you're in bed, mate,' said a surprised Keith, with Harry telling him he was 'in a bad way'.</p>

<p>Crawling into bed alongside him, Keith asked Harry about his visit to the doctor, with the contestant telling him he had a 'moon boot' and 'crutches'.</p>

<p>Out of action: A visit to the doctor revealed Harry had actually broken his foot, and he decided to curl up in bed, feeling sorry for himself</p>

<p>'He's out of action, entirely. Except for organising. That's all he can really do,' Keith later explained.</p>

<p>Added foreman Dan Reilly: 'It's no different to the last three or four weeks. Let's be honest, he didn't do too much. </p>

<p>'He pretty much just organised, so instead of being in the room, he's just doing it in bed... I'm being honest. It's no different from any other week.'   </p>

<p>'It's no different to the last three or four weeks. Let's be honest, he didn't do too much,' said foreman Dan Reilly of Harry post-injury (left), pictured with foreman Keith Schleiger (right)</p>
