<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Derby County are reportedly close to agreeing a fee with Fiorentina for former Liverpool youngster Bobby Duncan.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old, who is the cousin of Reds legend Steven Gerrard, left Anfield in acrimonious circumstances last summer.</p>

<p>Duncan's former agent, Saif Rubie, claimed that Liverpool were damaging Duncan's mental health by not allowing him to move to Italy. </p>

<p>Derby County are reportedly close to agreeing a fee with Fiorentina for Bobby Duncan</p>

<p>Duncan joined Fiorentina in a controversial transfer from Liverpool just over a year ago</p>

<p>Duncan's exit was soured by a dispute between his ex-agent Saif Rubie and Liverpool</p>

<p>Liverpool eventually sanctioned the move, with Duncan leaving the club in a £1.8 million deal plus add ons and signing a three-year deal with the Viola.</p>

<p>But the striker's move to Italy hasn't worked out and Fiorentina look set to allow him to leave just over 12 months after his controversial move.</p>

<p>According to The Telegraph, Duncan has returned to England to hold talks with Derby, with the two clubs close to agreeing a fee.</p>

<p>Duncan was initially part of Man City's academy before being bought by Liverpool in 2018</p>

<p>It is likely the youngster will initially be part of the club's under-23 side but he will be hopeful of breaking into the first team if he scores goals at youth level. </p>

<p>Derby boss Philip Cocu has overseen a woeful start to the season, which has seen the club lose both of their opening games and score just one goal.</p>

<p>He will hope the arrival of Jordon Ibe, who is joining the club as a free agent, and potentially the arrival of Duncan, will give the club more goal threat in the final third. </p>
