<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The attorney for Breonna Taylor's family says law enforcement offered her convicted drug trafficking ex-boyfriend a plea deal in exchange for naming the slain EMT as his co-defendant in a drug case months after she was killed.</p>

<p>Jamarcus Glover, who was arrested in a drug raid the same night Taylor was shot dead by police in her Louisville, Kentucky apartment, was offered the plea deal last month.</p>

<p>As part of the deal, Glover would have had to admit that he and co-defendants, including Taylor, trafficked drugs in Louisville, according to court documents.</p>

<p>He refused to take the deal from the Jefferson Commonwealth's Attorney's office that could have potentially seen him released on probation for criminal syndication, drug trafficking and gun charges. </p>

<p>Sam Aguiar, the attorney who is representing Taylor's family in a wrongful death lawsuit, has slammed law enforcement and accused them of going to extreme lengths to try and tarnish the slain woman's name in the wake of her death. </p>

<p>'The fact that they would try to even represent that she was a co-defendant in a criminal case more than a month after she died is absolutely disgusting,' Aguiar told WDRB. </p>

<p>In a Facebook post, Aguiar added that the plea deal was being used to justify the search of her home and her subsequent killing. </p>

<p>'Breonna Taylor is not a 'co-defendant' in a criminal case. She's dead. Way to try and attack a woman when she's not even here to defend herself,' the attorney said. </p>

<p>Aguiar noted the plea deal was made on July 13 - exactly four months after Taylor was killed.    </p>

<p>Glover was arrested in a drug raid just moments before Louisville police stormed into Taylor's apartment about 10 miles away on March 13.</p>

<p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical worker, was shot dead by police serving the 'no knock' narcotics search warrant at her apartment.  </p>

<p>Officers never found any drugs in her home. </p>

<p>An officer was shot during the raid by Taylor's boyfriend who has since said he thought he was defending against a home invasion. </p>

<p>Taylor's ex-boyfriend, who was arrested last week on new drug charges, has repeatedly said on recorded jail phone calls that Taylor was not involved in any drug operations. </p>

<p>Glover, who had an on-and-off again relationship with Taylor starting in 2016, has also previously questioned why officers would search her home. </p>

<p>The warrant used to enter Taylor's home was secured by police observing Glover, a suspected drug dealer, who had been spotted at her home two months earlier. </p>

<p>Officers had been tracking Glover for several months and, at one point, saw him getting out of a vehicle registered to Taylor that was later spotted several times outside a suspected drug house, according to the New York Times.</p>

<p>Glover listed Taylor's apartment as his address and was spotted on surveillance leaving her home with a package as recently as January.</p>

<p>Taylor's ex-boyfriend (above), who was arrested last week on new drug charges, has repeatedly said on recorded jail phone calls that Taylor was not involved in any drug operations</p>

<p>She had cut ties with Glover about a month before the fatal raid that ended her life. Taylor's family attorney said police failed to recognize this before they decided to storm into her apartment</p>

<p>Taylor had also paid Glover's bail in 2017 and 2019 when he was arrested on drug charges.</p>

<p>In a jail call in January when Glover asked her to pay bail again, Taylor told him that she was stressed when he was around 'because I just always be worried about you with the police'. </p>

<p>She had cut ties with Glover about a month before the fatal raid that ended her life. </p>

<p>Taylor's family attorney said police failed to recognize this.</p>

<p>'Breonna was a woman who was figuring everything out in her life, who had turned a corner,' Aguiar told the NYT. </p>

<p>'Breonna was starting to live her best life.' </p>

<p>In a jail call after Taylor was shot dead, Glover told an unidentified man that Taylor had been 'hanging onto my money'. </p>

<p>He claimed she had $14,000 of his money in her apartment. </p>

<p>'She had the eight I gave her the other day... and she picked up another six,' Glover said in the call.</p>

<p>Aguiar said no money was found in Taylor's apartment following her death.  </p>
