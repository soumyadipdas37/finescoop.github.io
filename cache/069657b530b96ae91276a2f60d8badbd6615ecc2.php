<p>Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said that mass indoor events are now in his sights and, along with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is looking to encourage crowds back into large venues. </p>

<p>The Eat Out To Help Out scheme could be reformed into 'Seat Out To Help Out', with one idea seeing discounted meals on Mondays for those with a ticket that day, The Sunday Times reported. </p>

<p>November 1 is the first day social distancing measures could be lifted, according to the Government's roadmap to easing lockdown restrictions. </p>

<p>Accelerated plans and on-the-day coronavirus tests mean theatres and sports stadiums could reopen within weeks without social distancing measures. </p>

<p>A source told the Sunday Times that there have been meetings this week and Mr Johnson is keen on making rapid progress. They added that rapid testing will get audiences back. </p>

<p>It comes after Health Secretary Matt Hancock was planning an astonishing rise in the number of Covid-19 tests carried out, in what has been dubbed 'Operation Moonshot'. </p>

<p>An increase in testing is hoped to get the economy back on track as Mr Hancock was said to be preparing an ambition to test four million people a day. </p>

<p>Writing in today's Mail on Sunday, Mr Dowden said that innovation was key to getting audiences back into theatres. </p>

<p>He said advances were being made in quick turnaround testing, such as saliva tests being trialled by Southampton University, which means on-the-day coronavirus tests could mean those who test negative could visit the theatre that evening. </p>

<p>More than 2,500 socially-distanced supporters made their way to Brighton's Amex Stadium on August 29 for a friendly against Chelsea</p>

<p>Other ways could include technology which improves ventilation in venues, he added.  </p>

<p>Those attending theatres and stadiums could be tested in advance and then chased up a few days after the event. </p>

<p>Theatres were allowed to open from August 15 with strict social distancing measures in place. </p>

<p>Writing in today's Mail on Sunday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said advances in rapid testing could mean on-the-day coronavirus tests could mean people could go to theatres that evening</p>

<p>This has reduced the capacity and many owners say it is not financially viable to run shows. They advise it should be between 70 and 80 per cent capacity. </p>

<p>The Eat Out To Help Out scheme was launched by Rishi Sunak and saw the government pay 50% of the bill up to £10 per head at participating restaurants from Monday to Wednesday in a bid to boost the hospitality industry and keep jobs. </p>

<p>Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who owns eight West End venues and has produced hits such as Les Miserables, Phantom Of The Opera and Hamilton, made 200 staff redundant last month.  </p>

<p>Boris Johnson pledged £1.57 billion to keep the arts sector afloat but Sir Cameron, together with his long-time collaborator Andrew Lloyd Webber, urged the Government to do more.</p>

<p>On August 29, 2,524 socially-distanced supporters made their way to Brighton's Amex Stadium for a friendly against Chelsea. </p>

<p>Fans were made to keep a seat between them in the stadium with a capacity for 30,666 fans. </p>

<p>There were plenty of hand sanitation points on the way to the ground and face coverings were required as fans queued to get in, but not when seated. </p>

<p>They completed medical questionnaires ahead of the game and consented to the track and trace scheme.  </p>

<p>However, large sports venues need to be at 60 per cent capacity for it to be financially viable. </p>
