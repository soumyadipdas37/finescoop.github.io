<p>An insider said: 'They are terrified of further delays. Tom is determined not to see any more hold-ups. </p>

<p>'The studio believes it will keep everyone safe and get this shoot wrapped up', they added to The Sun.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Tom, Skydance Media, New Republic Pictures and Paramount Pictures for further comment.</p>

<p>While it is unclear which Hurtigruten model the crew are staying on, the brand's collection includes MS Kong Harald, MS Vesterålen and MS Roald Amundsen - the world's first cruise ship propelled partially by battery power. </p>

<p>Up and running: Production for the action movie, which will see the actor, 58, reprise his role as Ethan Hunt, resumed in London in July after a five-month pause (pictured in the 2018 movie)</p>

<p>'He's determined': Sources have claimed the screen star has rented the Hurtigruten watercraft for filming in Norway to avoid further set-backs on the franchise, which is set for release in November 2021 (pictured in 2018)</p>

<p>The latest hybrid expedition cruise ship can take 500 passengers and is designed to sail in harsh climate waters.  </p>

<p>Following a COVID-19 outbreak on the MS Roald Amundsen last monyh, the ship's owner halted all cruises and Norway closed its ports to cruise ships for two weeks.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said that during its two journeys in July, a total of 37 crew members and 16 passengers have tested positive. The passengers all registered as living in Norway.</p>

<p>'The preliminary results now show that there are a total of 53 people with confirmed infection on these two voyages; 37 among the crew and 16 passengers,' the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said. </p>

<p>Impressive: While it is unclear which model the crew are staying on, the brand's collection includes the MS Roald Amundsen - the first cruise ship propelled partially by battery power</p>

<p>The cruise liner often acts like a local ferry, travelling from port to port along Norway's west coast. Some passengers disembarked along the route and authorities fear they may have spread the virus to local communities.</p>

<p>It was recently claimed that Tom was 'exempt from Norway's quarantine rules' as he  restart filming in the Scandinavian country. </p>

<p>The media personality revealed how 'excited' he was to start shooting the latest instalment of the franchise in a phone call with Norway’s Minister of Culture Abid Raja. </p>

<p>Speaking about his return, he said: 'It’s a gorgeous country, I can’t wait to get back there. I’m very excited, as is the whole crew, about coming back.' </p>

<p>Upcoming: The films focus on agent Ethan, played by Tom, and will be directed by Christopher McQuarrie (pictured 2011)</p>

<p>During the call, the minister told how Norway is 'looking forward to having [Tom] back' and insisted how the Hollywood star and crew are allowed to shoot in the country without having to quarantine at home first, Norwegian publication VG reported.  </p>

<p>However, cast and crew had to pass two tests for coronavirus within 48 hours of landing in Norway and a series of daily rigorous health checks were in place.</p>

<p>Abid added that the film production team wouldn't not have contact with anyone that is not part of the set. </p>

<p>It is thanks to a scheme allowing film productions that receive grants from the Norwegian Film Institute to shoot in the country without quarantine, the minister told VG. </p>

<p>Norway has provided the backdrop for the famous scene in Mission: Impossible – Fallout where Ethan hangs off the edge of Pulpit Rock known as Preikestolen. </p>

<p>The epic scene shows Ethan scaling the cliff face which boasts a 604-metre drop into the Lysefjorden. </p>

<p>The films focus on agent Ethan and will be directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who previously worked on 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout in 2018. </p>

<p>Famous appearance: Simon Pegg will also reprise his role Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent (pictured in the 2011 film)</p>
