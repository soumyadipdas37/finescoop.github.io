<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The boss of one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders has insisted the rally in the property market has further to run after reporting a surge in demand for new homes.</p>

<p>David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Developments, said house sales are bouncing back faster than expected after the lockdown was lifted.</p>

<p>The firm revealed the damage caused by the Covid-19 crisis to its bottom line, with profits slumping by 46 per cent to £492million in the year to the end of June.</p>

<p>David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Developments, said house sales are bouncing back faster than expected after the lockdown was lifted</p>

<p>It built almost a third fewer homes over this period, after construction sites were temporarily shut down earlier this year to curb the spread of the virus. </p>

<p>It said it would not be paying shareholders a special dividend for the year, amid concerns over rising unemployment and the prospect of a No Deal Brexit.</p>

<p>But it also revealed it is selling homes at a much more rapid rate than it was a year ago, with orders for 15,660 homes, compared with 13,064 at the same point last year. Thomas said: ‘We expect good demand in the long term. </p>

<p>The Government Help to Buy programme is providing a very accessible, very affordable way for people to get on to the housing ladder, and the stamp duty holiday through to March is providing some extra stimulus.’</p>

<p>The upbeat comments came as Nationwide revealed house prices had jumped to a record high in August, after registering the biggest monthly rise in more than 16 years. </p>

<p>The average house price rose 2 per cent – or almost £3,200 – to hit £224,123.</p>

<p>It followed a 1.8 per cent increase in July and means house prices have already clawed back their losses during the lockdown. </p>

<p>Property experts attributed the recovery to the release of pent-up demand during the lockdown, a demand for more properties with more space, and the Chancellor’s stamp-duty holiday on homes worth up to £500,000.</p>

<p>But they have also warned house prices could be dragged down again over the autumn as the Government’s furlough scheme ends.</p>
