<p>Members of New Zealand's Mongrel Mob attempted to establish Australian chapters in 2017</p>

<p>Several Mongrel Mob chapters remained in Western Australia despite the deportations in 2017</p>

<p>The gang began recruiting members for Australian chapters in Perth, Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Darwin from 2017 - the year Heart was caught at Perth Airport trying to bring gang uniforms into Western Australia. </p>
