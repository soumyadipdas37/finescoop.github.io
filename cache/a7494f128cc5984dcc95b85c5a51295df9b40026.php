<p>And the disgraced former My Kitchen Rules judges, 47, raised eyebrows yet again on Tuesday when he was caught growing a hallucinogenic cactus in his backyard. </p>

<p>The anti-vaxxer and conspiracy theorist uploaded a video to Instagram of himself promoting an episode of his podcast and showing off his newly grown fennel plants. </p>

<p>What's that over there, mate? Pete Evans (pictured) was caught growing a controversial hallucinogenic cactus his backyard after posting a video to Instagram on Tuesday </p>

<p>However, eagle-eyed fans couldn't help but notice two large San Pedro cacti looming in the background.</p>

<p>Native to the Andean slopes of Ecuador and Peru, the San Pedro cactus contains a psychoactive substance known as mescaline. </p>

<p>Controversial: Native to the Andean slopes of Ecuador and Peru, the San Pedro cactus contains a psychoactive substance known as mescaline. When consumed, mescaline can cause hallucinogenic effects comparable to those of LSD and psilocybin</p>

<p>Laws: It is illegal to grow San Pedro for the purposes of consumption in Pete's home state of New South Wales. However, it is legal to grow this plant for ornamental use</p>

<p>Native to the Andean slopes of Ecuador and Peru, the San Pedro (echinopsis pachanoi) cactus contains a hallucinogenic substance known as mescaline.</p>

<p>When consumed, it can cause hallucinogenic effects comparable to those of LSD and psilocybin.</p>

<p>While San Pedro has traditionally been used for religious and ceremonial purposes, it is also widely grown as an ornamental cactus.</p>

<p>It is legal to cultivate San Pedro in Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, Sweden and Germany for ornamental purposes - but not for consumption.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting that Pete Evans has or intends to consume any part of his San Pedro cactus.</p>

<p>While Pete hasn't offered his opinions on the San Pedro cactus, he has long been pushing for the Australian Government to legalise a different plant: cannabis. </p>

<p>Speaking to The Gold Coast Bulletin in October last year, the father of two declared himself a proud cannabis advocate.</p>

<p>He said: 'I'm a strong believer every single adult, should they chose, should legally be allowed to grow a few plants to be used as food or medicine.' </p>

<p>Outspoken: While Pete hasn't offered his opinions on the San Pedro cactus, he has long been pushing for the Australian Government to legalise a different plant: cannabis. Pete is pictured here at a cannabis farm in the United States</p>

<p>The chef, who has his own cannabis cookbook in the works, added: 'There's no reason why we should be able to grow this wondrous plant alongside our other herbs and plants.'</p>

<p>In August this year, Pete released a documentary about medicinal cannabis called The Magic Plant.</p>

<p>However, cannabis advocates have previously voiced concerns over Pete becoming the face of the movement in Australia, and claim his involvement could 'invite controversy' into the debate.</p>

<p>'We already having trouble in Australia getting doctors to come on-board,'  Lucy Haslam, the founding director of medicinal cannabis advocacy group United in Compassion (UIC), told News Corp in August last year. </p>

<p>'If [Pete] becomes the face of medicinal cannabis, it's going to invite controversy at a time when we're trying to make people realise it's a valid medicine,' she added.</p>

<p>Medicinal cannabis is known to have a range of benefits for those with chronic pain, PTSD symptoms and tremors related to Parkinson's disease.</p>

<p>The possession, use and cultivation of small amounts of cannabis was legalised in the ACT in September 2019, making it the first Australian jurisdiction to do so.</p>
