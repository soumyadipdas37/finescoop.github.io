<p>Dale Barberi returned to his home, which backs onto Lake Kthryn, and was unable to find his  young German Shepherd, named Mia</p>

<p>Barberi believed Mia may have been stolen, so he went to check his home security cameras and discovered the horrifying truth. </p>

<p>The footage shows the puppy playing with another dog at the edge of Lake Kathryn when the gator emerges from the water and traps the canine in its jaws.  </p>

<p>Mia is seen struggling to break free from the predator before it pulls her into the water and disappears. </p>

<p>The video subsequently shows heartbreaking footage of Barberi's three other dogs waiting by the edge of the lake for Mia to return. </p>

<p>One of the dogs is Mia's mother, and the canines are all related. </p>

<p>'I'm kind of sad about it,' Barberi stated. </p>

<p>'The way that gator just took her and wow, he was huge and he was fast. Less than two seconds and my puppy was gone.'</p>

<p>The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission were called to the scene and a trapper Mia's  remains on the other side of the lake. </p>

<p>A hunter is now trying to find the massive gator who ate the beloved pup. </p>
