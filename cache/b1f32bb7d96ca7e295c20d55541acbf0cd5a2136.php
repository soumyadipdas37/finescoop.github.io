<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>He's a former child actor turned entrepreneur who drives a DeLorean sports car, loves video games, electronic music and Pokemon; got married while dressed as a unicorn; and follows a not so strict 'flexitarian' diet.</p>

<p>Eccentric bitcoin billionaire Brock Pierce, 39, is far from your typical presidential candidate - but then again so was Donald Trump in 2016.</p>

<p>Pierce has thrown his hat into the ring this November, running in the 2020 presidential race as an independent candidate.</p>

<p>He faces a huge uphill struggle to overcome the Democratic and Republican political powerhouses but Pierce - who has plowed millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign - is confident he can at least make a dent.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV the cryptocurrency entrepreneur explains his decision to run for the White House, how playing World of Warcraft has helped him understand the economy and how he has a secret plan for victory straight from the history books.</p>

<p>And Pierce - who also clears up a scandal or two from his past - says he's fully prepared for the intense scrutiny he will face as the election nears.</p>

<p>'I feel as if we've already achieved some level of victory just by announcing,' he said.</p>

<p>Brock Pierce has thrown his hat into the ring this November, running in the 2020 presidential race as an independent candidate. In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Pierce explains why he decided to run against Donald Trump and Joe Biden for the White House</p>

<p>The 39-year-old is a former Disney child actor, starring in The Mighty Ducks (left) and First Kid  (right) before he became a billionaire cryptocurrency entrepreneur</p>

<p>Pierce's clean cut image is at odds, however, with the playboy billionaire who loves to party at Burning Man festival, jetting to Ibiza, Spain on a private jet and driving his souped-up sports car across the globe. Pictured: Pierce and his marriage ceremony to his partner Crystal which was held at Burning Man festival in 2016. Photos posted online show their 'entirely unicorn wedding' as an explosion of color with the bride and groom dressed as unicorns</p>

<p>His partner Crystal (pictured), a successful technologist and entrepreneur in her own right, calls herself 'crypto cowgirl' on social media and isn't shy of posting a revealing photo or two</p>

<p>The businessman says he felt the need to step up because he fears the nation is 'doomed' if something isn't done to help the country. 'I was hoping that someone else would step up and provide leadership in this country, so I'm doing this because I'm very concerned,' he explained</p>

<p>'The level of courage that it takes to step into this ring - it's extraordinary because you know that you're putting yourself out there in a way, to be put under a magnifying glass, to have every decision you've ever made in your life... very, very scrutinized.</p>

<p>'It's what stops so many great people from doing this is, because you are inviting in a level of scrutiny that most people are not prepared for.'</p>

<p>Looking relaxed, with long shoulder-length hair, dressed in a white shirt and gray suit and sporting a presidential style American flag lapel pin, Pierce spoke to DailyMailTV from Washington D.C. where he's working to try to build momentum in his campaign.</p>

<p>His clean cut image is at odds, however, with the playboy billionaire who loves to party at Burning Man festival, jetting to Ibiza, Spain on a private jet and driving his souped-up sports car across the globe.</p>

<p>But regardless, the businessman says he felt the need to step up because he fears the nation is 'doomed' if something isn't done to help the country.</p>

<p>'I was hoping that someone else would step up and provide leadership in this country, so I'm doing this because I'm very concerned,' he explained. '</p>

<p>I'm very concerned about the state of our nation. I'm concerned about our collective future. And I think that there is a way to get through this.'</p>

<p>Tech savvy Pierce, 39, believes there are 21st century solutions to the nation's 21st century problems, but added ominously: 'I think we're doomed if we don't do something different and I'm prepared to do whatever it takes, as a father, as someone that cares - I'm willing to put myself in harm's way for the betterment of us all.'</p>

<p>Pierce says America must 'innovate' its way out of its current problems, citing technology as the biggest issue for the nation's future.</p>

<p>'I see solutions to problems that have otherwise not been identified. I don't live within the box,' he said.</p>

<p>'The world is going to look very different 10 years from now, just looking at how technology has impacted our democracy, with social networking.</p>

<p>'And that's why I think that we need visionary leadership that has their finger on the pulse.'</p>

<p>Continuing on the tech theme Pierce - a systems designer - says he wants to upgrade the 'operating system of the United States of America'.</p>

<p>The businessman won't be drawn on attacking his opponents, however, saying that's for kids in the playground. He does believe the country is divided, however.</p>

<p>'We're supposed to be the United States and we very much feel like the divided States right now.</p>

<p>'And we have to find a way to come back together again, we have to find a way to harmonize.'</p>

<p>The billionaire's clean cut image is at odds, however, with the playboy billionaire who loves to party. Pictured: Pierce with his partner and friends on board a private plane </p>

<p>Pierce now lives in Puerto Rico with his 'wife' Crystal Rose and their one-and-a-half year-old baby daughter Aurora Rose (pictured together)</p>

<p>The couple's marriage is upheld in an online smart contract that can be dissolved, changed or renewed annually - making it unclear whether the nuptials are official or not</p>

<p>Pierce supports legalizing marijuana and abolishing private prisons, likes renewable energy and small businesses and wants to end human trafficking. He believes the way forward is to introduce a 'collaborative era' of democracy, giving a voice back to the people</p>

<p>Pierce supports legalizing marijuana and abolishing private prisons, likes renewable energy and small businesses and wants to end human trafficking.</p>

<p>He believes the way forward is to introduce a 'collaborative era' of democracy, giving a voice back to the people.</p>

<p>The candidate is realistic about his chances at the polls, though, and says at a minimum he hopes to 'deliver a message' and some 'game changing ideas' for the country that anyone can adopt.</p>

<p>'If it gets better for all of us, we all win. It's not about my winning. It's about the American people winning,' he said.</p>

<p>But the presidential candidate isn't ruling out winning either, referencing the election of 1842.</p>

<p>That year no presidential candidate received a majority of electoral votes, which meant the U.S. House of Representatives voted to elect John Quincy Adams as president, even though he won fewer votes than Andrew Jackson in the popular vote.</p>

<p>Pierce believes that if President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden fail to get a majority come November 3, and he's able to win up to three states and is trailing third, he says 'anything's possible.'</p>

<p>'It is the year 2020, it's the year where we should come to expect the unexpected,' he said.</p>

<p>Pierce does admit he's entering the election with 'battle scars', but is fully prepared to answer the anticipated torrent of questions. </p>

<p>He's referring to his widely reported links to a Hollywood child sex abuse ring which emerged in a lawsuit in 1999.</p>

<p>Pierce had co-founded a startup called Digital Entertainment Network, a precursor video platform to YouTube.</p>

<p>As the firm went from strength to strength Pierce, just 17 at the time, and his two co-founders, were named in two civil lawsuits alleging sexual abuse of underage boys.</p>

<p>Looking relaxed, with long shoulder-length hair, dressed in a white shirt and gray suit and sporting a presidential style American flag lapel pin, Pierce spoke to DailyMailTV from Washington D.C. where he's working to try to build momentum in his campaign</p>

<p>Later, as a pioneer in Blockchain and digital currency, Pierce created the first major marketplace for virtual goods in online gaming, which is expected to grow to $190B by 2025. He was an early investor in bitcoin and has since co-founded, advised, and funded over 100 companies</p>

<p>While the sex scandal was extremely damaging, Pierce was never charged criminally.</p>

<p>One of those partners, Marc Collins-Rector, is now a convicted sex offender, having pleaded guilty to related charges in two states.</p>

<p>The allegations have haunted Pierce his entire adult life, but he insists they are false.</p>

<p>'Part of running for president is having to answer questions regarding your past and I have my share of battle scars,' he admits.</p>

<p>'I was 16, 17, 18-years-old, I started my first company and my co-founder found himself in hot water.</p>

<p>'And as a result of that, I got myself into a lawsuit. I was asked to participate in this lawsuit and because I didn't participate, I was turned into a defendant.</p>

<p>'All three of those plaintiffs subsequently apologized to me and dismissed their cases. I was 17-years-old. I'm not perfect. I've made my mistakes, but I've never been charged with a crime.'</p>

<p>Another unfortunate association came in the form of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>Another unfortunate association came in the form of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In early 2011 Pierce flew to the Virgin Islands to speak at 'Mindshift,' a conference of top scientists hosted by Epstein</p>

<p>In early 2011 Pierce flew to the Virgin Islands to speak at 'Mindshift,' a conference of top scientists hosted by Epstein.</p>

<p>It was just 18 months after Epstein had completed his 'sweetheart deal' 13-month prison sentence in Florida for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and registered as a sex offender.</p>

<p>Pierce lives to regret his decision.</p>

<p>'I was asked to speak about the future of money, and so I went, I speak at conferences normally two or three times a week,' he explains.</p>

<p>'I don't do substantial due diligence nor was there any information about who was sponsoring it. 'And so I ended up speaking at that event.</p>

<p>'Had I known that the sponsor had been Jeffrey Epstein and if I knew what I know now, I would never have gone.'</p>

<p>It also didn't help that Pierce was named as a defendant in a 2000 lawsuit over his connection with the disgraced financier.</p>

<p>But again Pierce has said there was no truth to the allegations, describing the lawsuit as an 'extortion attempt.'</p>

<p>Pierce, who sports a distinctive tattoo of a scorpion on his right shoulder and is said to use exotic Amazon plant medicines to keep him sharp, is considered one of cryptocurrency’s richest men with a net worth estimated at $1 billion in 2018, according to Forbes.</p>

<p>Born into a middle-class home in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Pierce grew up 'playing hockey' with a mother who was a minister and a professional disco dancer and a father who worked in construction.</p>

<p>He began his early career as a child-actor, making Disney movies like The Mighty Ducks and First Kid.</p>

<p>In First Kid, released in 1996, he played the teenage son of the president who gets put under the protection of a Secret Service agent, played by stand up comic Sinbad.</p>

<p>By 16, Pierce turned his attention to the internet which he believed would change the world and he co-founded Digital Entertainment Network.</p>

<p>When asked directly if he was married by DailyMailTV, presidential candidate Pierce said: 'No, I'm not married,' and appeared coy about his personal circumstances</p>

<p>The nuptials were roundly mocked by talk show host John Oliver, who took an instant disliking to Pierce, calling him a 'douche' and a 'sleepy, creepy, cowboy from the future,' during one episode of his show</p>

<p>He also got into digital money early as a professional gamer, mining and trading gold in the video game World of Warcraft.</p>

<p>Later, as a pioneer in Blockchain and digital currency, Pierce created the first major marketplace for virtual goods in online gaming, which is expected to grow to $190B by 2025.</p>

<p>He was an early investor in bitcoin and has since co-founded, advised, and funded over 100 companies.</p>

<p>Pierce now lives in Puerto Rico with his 'wife' Crystal Rose and their one-and-a-half year-old baby daughter Aurora Rose.</p>

<p>While they refer to each other as husband and wife online, bizarrely their marriage was held at Burning Man festival in 2016 and upheld in an online smart contract that can be dissolved, changed or renewed annually - making it unclear whether the nuptials are official or not.</p>

<p>Photos posted online show their 'entirely unicorn wedding' as an explosion of color with the bride and groom dressed as unicorns.</p>

<p>All the bridesmaids and groomsmen wore the colors of the rainbow, plus pink.</p>

<p>While Pierce's 'best man' was a woman dressed in black, cracking a whip.</p>

<p>The nuptials were roundly mocked by talk show host John Oliver, who took an instant disliking to Pierce, calling him a 'douche' and a 'sleepy, creepy, cowboy from the future,' during one episode of his show.</p>

<p>When asked directly if he was married by DailyMailTV, presidential candidate Pierce said: 'No, I'm not married,' and appeared coy about his personal circumstances.</p>

<p>His partner Crystal, a successful technologist and entrepreneur in her own right, calls herself 'crypto cowgirl' on social media and isn't shy of posting a revealing photo or two.</p>

<p>Her Instagram is littered with photos of her and Pierce traveling on private jets, on yachts, holidaying in Ibiza and cavorting half naked at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert.</p>

<p>Pierce also has an 11-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. The girl lives with her mom in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>According to a Rolling Stone profile on him, slightly built Pierce rarely eats a full meal.</p>

<p>The businessman told DailyMailTV he follows a mainly plant based diet, although he claims he's 'flexitarian' - a term for a semi-vegetarian diet that occasionally includes meat.</p>

<p>The former professional gamer also loves video games, his favorite being Mortal Kombat. He enjoys virtual world games like Second Life and World of Warcraft, which he says could help him solve America's burgeoning national debt. 'I spent a lot of time in these places because there was an opportunity to test economic theories,' he says</p>

<p>Pierce, who is often seen wearing a cowboy hat, can be seen driving around Puerto Rico's capital San Juan in his DeLorean sports car (pictured) with the license plate Satoshi, the anonymous name of the creator of bitcoin </p>

<p>He proudly admits that inside the car, made famous by the Back to the Future movies, he has installed an actual 'flux capacitor' device, used in the films to help Marty and Doc travel through time</p>

<p>'I'm flexitarian, I'll eat just about anything and everything under the right circumstances,' he said.</p>

<p>'But I'm not a fan of factory farmed food. I don't have a problem with eating animals. I just have a problem with how we torture them.'</p>

<p>He proudly admits that inside the car, made famous by the Back to the Future movies, he has installed an actual 'flux capacitor' device, used in the films to help Marty and Doc travel through time.</p>

<p>Pierce drove the iconic car from London to Tokyo in the Gumball 3000 back in 2018 with blond Crystal in the passenger seat.</p>

<p>In his spare time Pierce loves to listen to music, mainly electronic music he says, but he also listens to heavy metal bands like Metallica, reggae singer Damien Marley and Hip Hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony.</p>

<p>The former professional gamer also loves video games, his favorite being Mortal Kombat.</p>

<p>'I spent a lot of time in these places because there was an opportunity to test economic theories,' he says.</p>

<p>Pierce also enjoys things like Pokemon and digital collectible card game Magic: The Gathering.</p>

<p>These days though, the entrepreneur spends a lot of his time on philanthropy in Puerto Rico, which he made home in 2017.</p>

<p>Pierce said he felt compelled to help others after seeing the devastation Hurricane Maria left behind on the Caribbean Island.</p>

<p>Developing the Integro Foundation, a Puerto Rico based not-for-profit organization, Pierce provided philanthropic resources to Puerto Rico, the Caribbean Islands, and indigenous people.</p>

<p>And through the Brock Pierce Foundation, his philanthropy also focuses on the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the Center for Individual Rights, the Brennan Center for Human Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the arts and cutting-edge research in medicine and mental health.</p>

<p>Pierce is a busy man, but feels he can bring a new and much needed vigor and enthusiasm to the White House.</p>

<p>Many voters won't like his flamboyant personal life, his love of technology or the photos of his scantily-clad 'First Lady'.</p>

<p>But one thing is for sure, the country is ready for a change.</p>
