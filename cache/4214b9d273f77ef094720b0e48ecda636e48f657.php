<p>Ms Giovanni wrote a moving tribute on social media after the tragic incident calling her 'our beautiful little angel'</p>

<p>She wrote: 'A shining star was sent to us to inspire, change, and transform our lives in the short 7 and half months we had the pleasure of being with her.</p>

<p>'Our beautiful angel may be gone and we can't physically hold her but her amazing presence can never be forgotten as she'll forever be in our heart. </p>

<p>'And the light she has sparked in us can never be put out.</p>

<p>'We are currently not taking calls for we need this time to heal and process and be there for our beautiful son Odis but we've decided to have her cremated so that she can always be here with us.' </p>

<p>The couple held her funeral over Zoom as family and friends could not attend in person due to coronavirus restrictions. </p>

<p>The motivational speaker posted videos on social media about the grief of losing a child. </p>

<p>In one she said: 'This is something that no parent should ever have to go through.</p>

<p>'I thought I had been through the worst type of pain the world has to offer.</p>

<p>'But I'm quickly realising that the kind of pain that comes from losing a child is a different kind of pain. It's something that takes a piece of you and I don't think you ever get it back.</p>

<p>'It is something that I have never felt before.' </p>
