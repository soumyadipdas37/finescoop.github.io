<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A boy racer who lost control of his new Suzuki Liana at 50mph in a 30 zone and killed a pensioner wept after he was found guilty of causing his death. </p>

<p>Daniel Freeman-Hollins' car ploughed into Raymond Johnstone, 72, outside the Robin Hood pub in Castlemorton, Worcestershire in May last year.</p>

<p>Mr Johnstone was hit with such force he was crushed against his Land Rover Freelander which was rammed into a pub building which collapsed on top of him.   </p>

<p>Despite being rushed to hospital, the grandfather died of multiple injuries.</p>

<p>Freeman-Hollins, of Malvern, Worcestershire, was found guilty of causing death by careless driving and causing death while unlicensed and uninsured.</p>

<p>As the verdict was read out yesterday, the 20-year-old broke down in tears.  </p>

<p>Worcester Crown Court was told that the defendant had only owned the car for a week despite not having a licence or insurance.</p>

<p>Daniel Freeman-Hollins, of Malvern, Worcestershire, was found guilty of causing death by careless driving and causing death while unlicensed and uninsured</p>

<p>Freeman-Hollins was travelling at more than 50mph with his girlfriend in the car when he lost control outside the Robin Hood pub, the court heard.</p>

<p>He swerved to avoid Mr Johnstone's daughter-in-law Ruth Johnstone, who was pulling out of the pub car park at 7.30pm.</p>

<p>He then collided with a parked Kia Sportage and span across the car park and struck Mr Johnstone's Land Rover.</p>

<p>Quizzing Freeman-Hollins, Harpreet Sandhu, prosecuting, said: 'It is the case you simply did not have enough time to see the hazard and react to it.</p>

<p>The defendant lost control of his new Suzuki Liana at 50mph outside the Robin Hood pub in Castlemorton, Worcestershire in May last year</p>

<p>'You came round that corner not travelling at 50mph (the speed limit on that stretch of road) but at a speed over 50mph. You didn't use your breaks. That's why there were no skidmarks (on the road).'</p>

<p>The court heard Mr Johnstone was dragged into the building which collapsed on top of him. </p>

<p>Mr Sandhu said: 'The Liana struck the Freelander, sending it into the timber building.</p>

<p>'As it did so Raymond Johnstone, standing next to that Freelander, was dragged into the building with the car.'</p>

<p>The defendant only suffered minor injuries as his car was propelled back into the middle of the road.</p>

<p>The jury took just one hour and ten minutes to find Freeman-Hollins unanimously guilty. The case was adjourned until November 13 for sentencing.</p>
