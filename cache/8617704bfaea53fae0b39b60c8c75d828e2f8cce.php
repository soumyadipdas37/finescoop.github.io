<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>AFL legend Gary Ablett Sr has taken to YouTube to deliver a complex rant linking the coronavirus pandemic to 'End Times' biblical prophecies, and conspiracy theories about Freemasons and the Illuminati.</p>

<p>The 27-minutes long video filmed in his car and posted to YouTube on Friday provided a very rare insight into the state of mind of a man who many regard as the greatest to have played the sport.</p>

<p>Ablett, 58, who had seldom spoken publicly throughout his playing career and since, made up for lost time with an extraordinary video that linked COVID-19 to the 'new world order' and the second coming of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>AFL legend Gary Ablett Sr (pictured) has taken to YouTube in a bizarre rant linking the coronavirus pandemic to a litany of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>The normally reclusive Australian sporting icon is regarded as one of the greatest-ever AFL players with 1031 goals in 248 matches during the 1980s</p>

<p>'It's not natural. It didn't come from bats. They're lying to us and they have been for decades,' Mr Ablett said of the virus.</p>

<p>'It was man made in a lab. Deliberately designed and deliberately released.'</p>

<p>'They don't want a cure. Why? Because they want us to take their vaccines. And their vaccines are going to kill us. They want to wipe out billions of people.'</p>

<p>The 58-year-old says later in the video that the development of a vaccine is part of a 'trans-humanist' plot.</p>

<p>'These vaccines they are talking about, they want to change our DNA and there are things in them… and they are trying to link us up with artificial intelligence so we can both give and receive messages.' </p>

<p>Ablett, who is the father of dual Brownlow Medallist Gary Ablett Jr, said the virus is 'camouflage' for globalist agendas like the introduction of a one-world currency and the banning of cash.  </p>

<p>Gary Ablett Jr (pictured with his wife Jordan and his son Levi) followed in his father's footsteps playing 352 matches for Geelong and the Gold Coast </p>

<p>'They need to crash the global economy… [so that] cash will be gone and what they are trying to bring in is their global digital currency,' he said.</p>

<p>'A one-world money system that is going to lead to the mark of the beast.'</p>

<p>Mr Ablett repeatedly touched on religious themes in the lengthy monologue and said the rapture - when Christians are unified with God - was 'imminent'.</p>

<p>He also argued the Victorian Premier was being used by those who were conducting the conspiracy.</p>

<p>'Daniel Andrews is nothing but a puppet to a very corrupt establishment and Victoria is the test case for what they are wanting to do in the entire nation,' Mr Ablett said.</p>

<p>'We need to wake up and rise up and stand against this stuff and expose them for who they really are because it’s all satanic.</p>

<p>'The only real answer for the world at this time is to repent of your sins and give your heart to Jesus Christ.' </p>
