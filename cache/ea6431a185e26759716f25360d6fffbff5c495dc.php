<p>Karamo, 39, shared details from the split during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he revealed they parted ways three months ago.    </p>

<p>The couple became engaged in 2018 after eight years together, but Karamo realized a separation was necessary after a recent re-evaluation of their busy relationship. </p>

<p>It's over: Queer Eye star Karamo Brown has called it quits from his fiance Ian Jordan after 10 years together (pictured February 2020 in West Hollywood)</p>

<p>Initially, Karamo and Ian were set to wed this summer, but the coronavirus crisis forced them to delay the nuptials.   </p>

<p>'It was postponed because of the pandemic, but now it's actually postponed officially, 'cause my fiancé and I, we were together for 10 years, and we broke up about three and a half months ago,' Karamo explained to guest host Stephen 'tWitch' Boss.</p>

<p>'We were distracted by so much — with the kids, and our careers — that during that time, I had to really say, "How is our communication? How is other parts of our lives? Are we growing in the same place?"</p>

<p>'You know, we're not 20 anymore, so it wasn't just, "Oh, I'm not going to text you anymore" — it was like, we have a family and a home. How do we separate this? And it was hard. We went to virtual counseling, we did a lot of things. </p>

<p>'But eventually I was like, this is a moment where I need to decide, is my happiness important? And once I made that decision, I said, you know, we are going to have to break up.'  </p>

<p>The exes remain good friends after their unfortunate split, which was not brought on by infidelity. </p>

<p>'There was luckily no cheating, so we're good friends,' the Netflix star clarified.</p>

<p>'It's very nice when it's like, "I still love you and support you," and I want him to be happy, he wants me to be happy,' he continued.</p>

<p>'But yeah, no more wedding... so if y'all got any friends! I'm lying, I'm not ready to move on that quick, I'm not ready.'</p>
