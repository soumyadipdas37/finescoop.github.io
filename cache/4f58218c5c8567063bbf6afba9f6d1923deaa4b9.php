<p>'The LipMD plumping system is more effective than lip fillers, and women can see results instantly,' Alex said (a before and after pictured)</p>

<p>'The LipMD plumping system is more effective than lip fillers and women can see results instantly,' Alex said.</p>

<p>'The system includes an incredibly compact device, which creates a vacuum-like suction to create that plump pout, and a serum, which is packed full of active ingredients that create a long-term stimulating effect.' </p>

<p>The serum is made of botanicals like shea and aloe butters as well as avocado and coconut oils, which help to fight the first signs of ageing and create an ultra-smooth 'cushiony' effect after you've used the device. </p>

<p>'The system includes an incredibly compact device, which creates a vacuum-like suction to create that plump pout (left), and a serum,' (right) Alex said</p>

<p>STEP 1: Apply LIPMD Extreme Lip Plumping Serum onto clean and dry lips. Use only on the lips (within the lip perimetre). Allow serum to absorb for at least one minute.</p>

<p>STEP 2: Insert filter pad into mouthpiece and power on LIPMD Electronic Lip Plumping Device; choose vacuum suction intensity level (1 or 2); and pout into the mouthpiece. Keep your lips pouted until the mouthpiece forms a tight seal around your lips. The moisturising serum will assist in optimising vacuum suction. The device will automatically power off in 60 seconds.</p>

<p>STEP 3: Recommend twice daily treatment, three times maximum. </p>

<p>The serum contains botanicals like shea and aloe butters as well as avocado and coconut oils, to fight the first signs of ageing and create an ultra-smooth 'cushiony' effect after you've used the device</p>

<p>The formula is also rich with vegan Maracuja Oil (from Peru) to firm skin; almond, olive, linseed and borage oils (rich in omega fatty acids) to improve skin elasticity; and Swertia Chirata (from the Himalayas), which works cooperatively with the skin's own regenerating stem cells to reduce visible wrinkles after seven days. </p>

<p>LipMD's device has been shortlisted in three categories at the Pure Beauty Global Awards 2020 including Best Lip product, Best Electrical Device and Special Innovation.</p>

<p>And regular customers are writing five-star reviews on the website.</p>

<p>'My lips were so much plumper. I felt super sexy. They also flushed a really amazing colour without lipstick. So good to see results so fast,' one woman said.</p>

<p>'I wasn't sure it would work so I went straight in for the number two setting and to be honest my lips looked a bit too pouty with lots of friends accusing me of having got injections which I didn't really like,' said another</p>

<p>'I wasn't sure it would work so I went straight in for the number two setting and to be honest my lips looked a bit too pouty with lots of friends accusing me of having got injections which I didn't really like,' said another.</p>

<p>'I now use it just on the single setting which is great because it's faster and gives me nice volume without looking too fake.'</p>

<p>A third added: 'The effect only lasted about three hours with me but I found that even just topping up with the serum during the night meant I could keep the effect'.</p>

<p>Eighty-seven per cent of volunteers said the Electronic Lip Plumping System performed better than other plumping products and it effectively increases lip volume in just two minutes.</p>
