<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Top officials at the White House pressured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to produce more data that showed the spread of COVID-19 was declining in young people ahead of schools reopening, some officials have claimed. </p>

<p>The officials, including Dr Deborah Birx and Vice President Mike Pence aides, were involved in pushing for alternate data that was in favor of children returning to school, the New York Times reports, citing interviews with former and current officials. </p>

<p>Olivia Troye, a former aide who worked on Pence's COVID-19 taskforce, said she was repeatedly asked by the VP's chief of staff Marc Short to produce data that showed declining cases in children. </p>

<p>She claims Pence's staff were asked to try and circumvent the CDC to search for data that better supported the push to reopen schools.   </p>

<p>Troye left the White House last month and has been publicly slammed President Trump and his coronavirus response.</p>

<p>Top officials at the White House pressured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to produce more data that showed the spread of COVID-19 was declining in young people ahead of schools reopening, some officials say</p>

<p>Short has since said Troye has a vendetta against Trump.</p>

<p>Dr Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, sent CDC director Robert Redfield an email in July asking for specific data on children's mental health to be included as 'background' in its school reopening guidance, according to the NYT.</p>

<p>The data came from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - an agency inside the Department of Health - and suggested that extended school closures could affect a child's mental health. </p>

<p>That report suggested there were few instances where children were the primary source of COVID-19 transmission among family members and said that asymptomatic children were unlikely to spread the virus. </p>

<p>CDC scientists flagged concerns that the data minimized the risk of COVID-19 in children. </p>

<p>While the mental health argument was included in the introductory text of the CDC's final guidelines, the line about asymptomatic children was not included.</p>

<p>A CDC report released this week said that the incidence of COVID-19 in school-age children began rising in early September as many youngsters returned to their classrooms. </p>

<p>About two times more teens were infected than younger children, the CDC said. Most infected children have mild cases and hospitalizations and death rates are much lower than in adults. </p>

<p>A separate study by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association said the children of all ages now make up 10 percent of all US cases, which is up from 2 percent in April. </p>

<p>Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the rising numbers are a big concern and underscore the importance of masks, hand-washing, social distancing and other precautions.</p>

<p>'While children generally don't get as sick with the coronavirus as adults, they are not immune and there is much to learn about how easily they can transmit it to others,' she said in a statement.</p>

<p>The CDC report did not indicate where or how the children became infected. </p>

<p>Global school studies suggest in-person learning can be safe when transmission rates in the larger community are low, the CDC report said. </p>
