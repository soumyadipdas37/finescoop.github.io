<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bella Varelis was visibly furious when Locky Gilbert dumped her on Thursday night's season finale of The Bachelor, right after telling her he was 'falling in love' with her.</p>

<p>But apparently viewers didn't see the half of it.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old marketing manager told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Friday that producers had to edit out much of her scathing reaction to Locky's break-up speech.</p>

<p>What you DIDN'T see on The Bachelor: Producers were forced to cut Bella Varelis' scathing speech to Locky Gilbert after he dumped her in the season finale after saying 'I love you'</p>

<p>'Did you let him have it any more than what we saw?' radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson asked.</p>

<p>'Yeah, I honestly, I went numb,' Bella responded.</p>

<p>'The thing is, right, I was walking up to him and I genuinely loved him. You don't want to see the person that you love crying like that. That's why I was consoling him. </p>

<p>Silenced: The 25-year-old marketing manager told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Friday that producers had to edit out much of her scathing reaction to Locky's (right) break-up speech</p>

<p>'Did I think that I was going to be the one standing at the end wiping the tears off his face? No, I thought it would have been the other way round at least.</p>

<p>'But I don't know... I did kind of give it to him a little bit.'</p>

<p>Host Kyle Sandilands interjected: 'I knew something had been edited out! I was waiting for you to just put your finger in his face and say, "Eff you" What did you say?'</p>

<p>Bella replied: 'I might have been like, "You've got honour tattooed on your chest, mate." And then I kind of looked and was like, "Can I leave?"'</p>

<p>'What did he say to that?' asked Jackie, to which Bella responded: 'He said nothing.</p>

<p>'He's got honour tattooed on his chest. Don't tell me you're in love with me and then be like, "I love you, but not enough."'</p>
