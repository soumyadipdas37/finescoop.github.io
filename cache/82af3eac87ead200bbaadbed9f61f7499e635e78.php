<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Here’s a useful little secret for you: Britain’s youth hostels are open for business. They’re cheap, located in beautiful areas and have taken Covid precautions. And best of all, they have vacancies.</p>

<p>I stumbled across this information two weeks back. After foreign holidays hit the wall and every B&amp;B in Britain sold out a few minutes later, I feared my family and I would be going nowhere this year.</p>

<p>On a whim, I Googled the Youth Hostel Association (YHA) and found a clutch of lovely hostels nestled in the verdant heart of the Peak District, most of which were set in historic buildings, and all of which were available.</p>

<p>YHA Hartington, a beautiful and historic building tucked away among the Peaks, is accessible to all for very affordable rates</p>

<p>The Peak District, described by Enlightenment philosopher Thomas Hobbes as 'the English Alps', boasts some of Britain's most beautiful landscapes. Pictured is the River Dove, which runs through stunning ravines</p>

<p>YHA Hartington - a 17th-century manor house that claims to have once hosted Bonnie Prince Charlie - is a jewel in the youth hostel crown</p>

<p>Apart from safety measures – the communal areas are closed and dorms had been converted into single-family rooms – they were up and running almost as normal, according to the website.</p>

<p>And although a youth hostel isn’t quite the same without a game of chess with random German hikers of an evening, the list of Covid safety measures was actually quite reassuring.</p>

<p>Better still, they were hugely affordable, with five-person rooms going for as little as £39 per room per night. Yes, you read that right. And at the time of writing, there are still vacancies.</p>

<p>The accommodation at YHA Castleton, says Jake, was 'clean but basic, with metal bunk beds, thin pillows and bed linen in racing green'</p>

<p>So it was that one bright morning, with the sun shining promisingly and the kids – my 12-year-old daughter and 10-year-old twins – in the back seat, I attempted to top up the oil in the car and fumbled the keys into the maw of the engine.</p>

<p>That little episode, which precipitated a bike ride to the local garage, a temporary oil cap and a £20 backhander to a mechanic, added a couple of hours onto our departure time.</p>

<p>Despite this hiccup, the mid-afternoon found us rolling down the driveway of Losehill Hall, or YHA Castleton, a refurbished Gothic mansion set in 27 acres of parkland in the very bosom of the Peak District National Park.</p>

<p>As you’d expect from a hostel, the accommodation was clean but basic: metal bunk beds, thin pillows and bed linen in racing green. But because of the pandemic, each room had been allocated its own bathroom as standard.</p>

<p>Mam Tor (pictured), explains visitpeakdistrict.com, has a number of caverns just below it, such as Treak Cliff Cavern, Blue John Cavern, Speedwell Cavern and Peak Cavern</p>

<p>Mam Tor offers sublime views of the Peak District, and is understandably popular with hikers</p>

<p>This bridge forms part of the Monsal Trail, a former railway route now converted for cyclists and walkers</p>

<p>The Scotsman’s Pack Country Inn in Hathersage, a fine country pub with top food</p>

<p>The grounds of the hostel were stunning, with the welcome addition of a goat pen and pigsty hidden away in the woodland for the children to discover.</p>

<p>The Peak District has long had a special place in English literary culture. It is thought that Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in Bakewell, and Charlotte Brontë likely set Jayne Eyre in Hathersage, which she visited.</p>

<p>Even the Enlightenment philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who is not known as a bundle of fun, had a special affection for the region, dubbing it 'th' English Alps'.</p>

<p>He was spot-on. Much of the landscape found in the Peak District has changed little since he coined the term in 1636, and it is nothing short of sublime.</p>

<p>We dined that first evening at the Scotsman’s Pack Country Inn in Hathersage, a 10-minute drive away, which boasted attentive staff, a secluded beer garden and a lovely tinkling brook outside.</p>

<p>The pub had achieved a good balance of safety and comfort, introducing effective precautions while retaining the character of the place. And the food – hearty fare with a posh twist – was just what the doctor ordered, so to speak.</p>

<p>Next day, we corralled the kids out the door and set off for a 10-mile hike up to nearby Mam Tor, a 1,696ft-high vantage point on the top of a ridge with panoramic views over the Peaks.</p>

<p>Predictably, it was an effort to convince the kids to take on the final steep section of the climb. But after a pensioner proudly pedalled past us on a high-spec mountain bike, they caved in and up we went.</p>

<p>At the summit we feasted on a sumptuous packed lunch, collected earlier from the well-loved Three Roofs Café in Castleton, which has adapted to coronavirus by introducing a picnic service.</p>

<p>My daughter is intolerant of dairy and her diet was easily catered for by the café, as was her sister’s vegetarianism.</p>

<p>The region forms an 890-mile national park which is Eden for hikers and cyclists</p>

<p>After lunch, it was just a short walk to Treak Cliff Cavern. This network of catacombs, which is still a working mine, is located in Castleton, the only place in the world where a semi-precious stone called Blue John is found.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary thing to admire purple stalagmites and blue-veined rock in cold caves beneath the Derbyshire countryside.</p>

<p>Like the café, the family-run mine has risen to the challenges of Covid, developing an app that guides visitors through the caves via their phones, without the need for a human expert.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of youth-hostelling in a national park is that there are often several to choose from, which enables a mini-tour.</p>

<p>We would have liked to have strung several together, travelling between them by bicycle, but the last-minute nature of the trip meant that we had come sans vélos.</p>

<p>So we contented ourselves with one change of scene and a transfer by car. After two nights in Castleton, we packed up and moved to the YHA Hartington Hall, about 20 miles south.</p>

<p>It was well worth it. An unrecognised joy of youth-hostelling is discovering the architectural gems that glitter modestly in the YHA crown.</p>

<p>The famous Bakewell Pudding</p>

<p>Hartington – a 17th-century manor house that claims to have once hosted Bonnie Prince Charlie – is one of these. We stayed in the house itself for the first night, then transferred into a 'landpod', a kind of semi-permanent tent, for the second.</p>

<p>The roof was retractable, meaning that in theory you could sleep under the stars. In practice, this didn't seem a good idea, given the fact that we'd been in and out of raincoats all day. Nevertheless, the landpod introduced a welcome element of fun and adventure. Though I'd recommend keeping your children away from baked beans for a couple of days beforehand (for God's sake, don't repeat our mistake).</p>

<p>The property had the advantage of being located near the jaw-dropping Chatsworth House, otherwise known as Britain’s favourite country house, described by Daniel Defoe in 1726 as a 'wonder of art', and one of the few saving graces of the Peak District, which he inexplicably deplored.</p>

<p>We visited on a blisteringly hot day. The house turned out to be more of a palace, stuffed with works of art spanning 4,000 years, from the ancient Egyptians to Lucian Freud, and offering 25 lavish rooms to explore.</p>

<p>The grounds were equally spectacular. We went for a stroll, enjoying the sprayback from the 300ft Emperor Fountain, cooling ourselves in the 18th-century grotto, and paddling with ice-creams in the imposing, serried cascade.</p>

<p>The following day we got our fix of cycling on the Monsal Trail, a disused railway track that has been converted into an un-hilly walking and biking route, complete with four eerie tunnels.</p>

<p>We hired the bicycles at lovely Hassop Station, which is located right on the trail and also houses a very good café and book shop for pre or post-ride meals and drinks.</p>

<p>Last but by no means – by no means! – least, no visit to the region would be complete without sampling a genuine Bakewell pudding, which we accomplished in Bakewell itself.</p>

<p>Forget Mr Kipling. He never existed anyway. In the Peak District there are two things: the Bakewell tart, with its familiar white icing with brown feathered lines, and the Bakewell pudding, which nobody has ever heard of. Both are served with custard.</p>

<p>We tried the dishes at Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop, which is one of a handful of places that claim to have invented the pudding, after lunch under the wooden beams of its upstairs restaurant.</p>

<p>Lunch, by the way, was hearty and good. I was man enough, or perhaps mad enough, to attempt the house signature dish, the Famous Blacksmith's Skillett. </p>

<p>Bamford Edge, with a view to Ladybower Reservoir. This is one of the many amazing walking areas in the Peak District</p>

<p>This image shows Chrome Hill, also known as the ‘Dragon’s Back' on account of its rugged spine</p>

<p>This mélange of black pudding, bacon, onions and mushrooms in a peppercorn sauce was not for the faint-hearted. But then, I am not faint-hearted. It was filling, peppery and delicious, and I swabbed the last streaks of sauce with a chip.</p>

<p>When it came, the pudding was brown and dipped, cooked on puff pastry rather than shortcrust. Folklore has it that the dish was invented by accident when a local cook messed up the recipe for a jam tart.</p>

<p>It was pleasant enough. But without wanting to offend Bakewellers (Bakewelites? Bakewelians?), it didn't capture my heart. Not so the tart, which we tried next: if heaven was sticky and almondy and wildly calorific, this would be it. </p>

<p>You must try both, of course, having burnt off sufficient calories on a long hike. But to miss the tart would be unforgivable. Oh, and book your hostel soon. They too are selling like hot cakes.</p>

<p>A family room sleeping up to five people at YHA Hartington Hall starts at £49 per room per night. At Losehill Hall, YHA Castleton, prices start at £39 per room per night.</p>

<p>Landpods and bell tents at Hartington Hall start at £49 per room per night, subject to availability.</p>
