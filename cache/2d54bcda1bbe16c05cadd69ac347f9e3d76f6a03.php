<p>Terry shot to fame alongside Love Island icons including Alex and Olivia Bowen, Nathan Massey and Cara De La Hoyde in 2016. </p>

<p>Now, after his time away, he is set to become both a husband and a father with his stunning fiancée, who shared the news with her 1,448 followers. </p>

<p>Sharing the incredibly sweet snap, Danielle penned: 'The best birthday present I could ever have wished for was seeing our baby again today ☺️ so special....</p>

<p>His relationship with Emma flourished soon after her arrival in the house, in which she entered as the girlfriend of Tom Powell, with the duo growing ever closer much to Malin's chagrin on the outside as she watched on. </p>

<p>As their romance developed, Emma and Terry stunned fans and co-stars when they had sex in the communal bedroom without shielding themselves with a duvet.</p>

<p>Emma revealed she had decided it was better to bed Terry without any covers to conceal the deed, as she believed it wouldn't be aired on TV. </p>

<p>Unbeknownst to her, however, the scenes had played out on the show meaning it wasn't just her fellow islanders that had a front row seat, which eventually led to ITV being bombarded with complaints from stunned viewers.  </p>

<p>The couple's actions led to a backlash from viewers, prompting complaints to be raised about the steamy scenes, but Love Island was later cleared by watchdog Ofcom who said 'no rules had been breached' by the show.</p>

<p>Seeming to express her regret over her actions once filming had wrapped, Emma later told new! magazine: 'There's not a day goes by I don't wish I hadn't done that.'</p>
