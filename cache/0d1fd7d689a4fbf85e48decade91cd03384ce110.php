<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Mail on Sunday's Neil Simpson picks 12 of the best British cycling breaks</p>

<p>Cruising on two wheels down country lanes, along coastal paths and over forest tracks will get you to vistas and idyllic picnic spots that few other holidaymakers reach. But you don’t have to be a fitness fanatic to enjoy a cycling holiday in the UK, as there are a wealth of companies that specialise in making sure everything goes at your pace, however leisurely that may be.</p>

<p>They will provide top-quality bikes – including e-bikes which have an electric motor to give you a boost when hills are looming or the going gets tough – and, once you’ve chosen an area, will set out a route that showcases its highlights as well as matches your fitness level. Accommodation is then booked in hotels or B&amp;Bs along the route. For those who don’t travel light, you’ll be relieved to know your suitcases are not strapped on your back – they are transported to that day’s destination, so all you have to do is concentrate on getting there.</p>

<p>With guided bike holidays, you join a group of about 16 people and a guide who runs the show and takes charge if you have problems en route, or even just a puncture. A driver in a support vehicle looks after the luggage and, if you falter, may even be able to give you a sneaky lift. </p>

<p>With self-guided holidays, you are provided with detailed route maps to follow. Taxis take luggage to your next hotel each day and you are given a phone number to call in an emergency. Beyond that, bike holidays in the UK can be as varied as the landscapes they pass through. Some suit families, including first-time riders. Some are perfect if you want luxury and a spa treatment each night. Others are pitched at serious riders wanting to raise their fitness levels and earn bragging rights, such as by completing an epic coast-to-coast route. </p>

<p>Here are 12 of the best British cycling breaks. </p>
