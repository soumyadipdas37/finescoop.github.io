<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Simon Reeve is suing Network Seven</p>

<p>Channel Seven's billionaire chairman Kerry Stokes sent axed presenter Simon Reeve an email apologising after he was dumped from the network, court documents show. </p>

<p>Reeve, who worked on-and-off for the network for the best part of four decades, is suing after he was boned in June.  </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands the presenter's lawsuit is about entitlements he believes should have been paid out when he was let go. </p>

<p>At the heart of the legal dispute is whether he was an employee of Seven - as Reeve argues he was - or an independent contractor at the time.</p>

<p>Seven will defend the case and is expected to argue Reeve had 'changed his tune' on being a contractor after being axed. </p>

<p>No dollar figure has been placed on the lawsuit.  </p>

<p>Reeve claims Seven breached his 'ongoing contract' and misrepresented his employment status, news.com.au reported.</p>

<p>Reeve (above with Larry Emdur and Monique Wright) has been the sports presenter on Weekend Sunrise for about a decade but hasn't appeared on screen since March</p>

<p>Reeve most recently hosted It's Academic, Million Dollar Minute and the sport on Weekend Sunrise</p>

<p>Channel Seven's billionaire chairman Kerry Stokes sent axed presenter Simon Reeve an email apologising after he was dumped from the network</p>

<p>In supporting statements filed to the court and seen by the network, Reeve claims emails sent to him by Mr Stokes in July prove that he was considered an employee. </p>

<p>'I'm so sorry,' Mr Stokes said on July 3, according to the documents, before insinuating that Reeve had been made redundant. </p>

<p>An email sent by Seven West Media chief operations officer Bruce McWilliam read that Reeve was: 'Part of the DNA of this place since before I can remember.' </p>

<p>'You'll leave a big hole as you've been part of the weekend line up for so long. Won't be the same without you as you're part of our DNA,' he wrote in another email on July 16, according to the court documents.  </p>

<p>Simon Reeve worked for Channel Seven for 20 years when he was axed earlier this year - and is now suing in the Federal Court. Above, in the Sunrise studio with Angela Cox and Sally Bowrey</p>

<p>When Today Show host Jessica Rowe's head was on the chopping block in 2006, it was alleged Eddie McGuire had spoken of having her 'boned' - or axed, in other words.</p>

<p>'What are we going to do about Jessica? When should we bone her? I reckon it should be next week,' it was claimed McGuire, then the network's CEO, said.</p>

<p>McGuire later claimed he had said 'burn' instead of 'bone', but the damage was done.</p>

<p>It has since entered the Australian lexicon for when TV presenters are axed. </p>

<p>In Reeve's statement of claim, which was filed to the Federal Court, he argues that he was an employee according to the Fair Work Act and therefore was entitled to annual leave payments, a notice period for his departure and a redundancy package.    </p>

<p>'It was an implied term of the ongoing contract that Seven would provide Reeve with reasonable notice of termination,' his statement of claims reads.</p>

<p>'Reasonable notice for Reeve as at 25 June 2020 given his age, seniority and length of service, was not less than 12 months' notice of termination.'</p>

<p>Reeve is claiming 12 months' salary in lieu of termination notice in court, as well as compensation over the failure to receive annual leave, interest and costs.       </p>

<p>Reeve, known as one of the network's 'nice guys', had been with Seven for almost four decades in one role or another when he was shown the door - as the economic downturn ravages Australian TV businesses.  </p>

<p>The lawsuit sets the stage for what could be the highest-profile court stoush Seven has faced since the network and former CEO Tim Worner's executive assistant Amber Harrison sued one another in 2017.</p>

<p>Both Seven and Reeve's lawyers declined to comment, with a court date yet to be set. </p>

<p>It has been a year of bloodshed in the TV industry with big names shown the door at both Seven and Network 10.  </p>

<p>Sunrise presenter Melissa Doyle was another casualty of the coronavirus-induced cost-cutting at Channel Seven. </p>

<p>She issued a statement upon her departure where she singled out Seven chairman Stokes for his support.</p>

<p>Reeve regularly worked on Sunrise and was a regular presence when Mel and Kochie were on the couch. Above, the trio together in 2013 - with Kochie the only survivor</p>

<p>Reeve has been on and off Channel Seven for the past 40 years. Above, he poses with longtime colleagues Doyle and Kylie Gillies at a Seven Christmas party in 2007</p>

<p>Reeve, far right, was a long term contributor to Weekend Sunrise but is understood to be living on the Gold Coast</p>

<p>'For 25 years, I have called Channel 7 home,' she said. 'I've had the privilege to share stories that mattered, meet incredible people and be there for significant moments in history. </p>

<p>Melissa Doyle and Seven executives exchanged gushing statements when she left the building</p>

<p>'I am incredibly proud of the work I have done and appreciative of the trust and warmth our viewers have shown me. </p>

<p>'I want to thank the consummate professionals I have worked with along the way, in particular our chairman Kerry Stokes for his constant support. </p>

<p>'I leave Seven with a great deal of pride, satisfaction and gratitude.' </p>

<p>Seven CEO James Warburton thanked the former Sunrise host for 'everything she's done for the Seven Network.'</p>

<p>'Melissa has deserved every success that's come her way'.</p>

<p>There was no such song and dance for Reeve - who started his career at Seven in Western Australia in 1979. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ten has axed state-based bulletins in Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth, as well as legendary weatherman Tim Bailey - who worked there for 29 years.  </p>
