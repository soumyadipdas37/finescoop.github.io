<p>Wearing face masks and 14th century costumes, Jodie giggled with Hollywood actor Matt Damon, 49, on location at Cahir Castle in Co. Tipperary, Ireland.</p>

<p>Hollywood star Damon was sporting a mullet hairstyle and a beard and had whipped his shield off for a second in between takes. </p>

<p>Nice mullet! Killing Eve's Jodie Comer larked around with Matt Damon behind face shields as The Last Duel filming continued in Ireland at Cahir Castle in Ireland on Wednesday </p>

<p>Jodie, 27, was wearing a fur-lined robe and had her hair styled into Princess Leia style plaits as they walked alongside a couple of horses, while Matt was wearing regal green velvet.</p>

<p>Walking around set, the actors were surrounded by a crowd of cast and crew who were all wearing various face masks as they milled around.</p>

<p>Adapted from Eric Jager's book of the same name, The Last Duel follows the true story of Jean de Carrouges (Damon), a 14th century knight who embarks on a fight to the death with former friend Jacques Le Gris (Driver) after accusing him of raping his wife. </p>

<p>Safety precautions: Walking around set, they were surrounded by a crowd of cast and crew who were all wearing various face masks</p>

<p>Jodie plays Marguerite de Carrouges, the woman at the centre of the fight in the Ridley Scott-directed epic.</p>

<p>The Last Duel marks the first return of Damon's writing partnership with Ben Affleck since their award-winning script for Good Will Hunting.  </p>

<p>Matt co-wrote the screenplay alongside Nicole Holofcener and his longstanding writing partner Ben, the latter is also starring in the film, although he wasn't seen on set.</p>

<p>How are you finding that beard, Matt? Jodie had a big smile on her face as filming continued for a second day following a six month break due to coronavirus</p>

<p>Originally, Matt and Ben were set to play the two leading roles in the film, but they ran into scheduling conflicts because of Ben's film Deep Water, so he is now set to play King Charles VI, while Adam Driver was cast to take over the role of Le Gris.</p>

<p>Filming began on the movie in February in France but the set was shut down in March due to the pandemic and travel restrictions in Europe. </p>

<p>Matt was at the film's next location in Ireland when lockdown began and amid the travel ban ended up isolating in the seaside resort of Dalkey, an affluent suburb of Dublin with his wife and four children for a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Last Duel had a scheduled released date of December 2020 but it has now been pushed back to October 15, 2021.</p>

<p>Realistic: Some extras were recently seen in a wooden boat along the river</p>
