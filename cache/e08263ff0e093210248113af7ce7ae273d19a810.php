<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Weather extremes are set to lash each side of the country this week, with choking heat in the west and heavy rain in the east. </p>

<p>North-western parts of Australia will scorch through above average temperatures for days to come as record-breaking winter heat rolls into spring. </p>

<p>A hot, dry air mass lingering across Western Australia's Kimberly region saw the mercury hit as much as 10C above average on Wednesday, as residents brace for more warm weather.  </p>

<p>Yampi Sound reached 40.1C just after midday, with Derby and Curtin close behind at 39C, well above the September daily average temperature of 30C.  </p>

<p>A heat map shows the above average temperatures scorching the top end of the country as north western Australia braces for a heatwave in days to come</p>

<p>The smouldering heat is predicted remain around the high 30s to low 40s from the Pilbara to Kimberleys into Monday.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a low pressure system barrelling across the nation in the coming days will bring thunderstorms and showers to southern, central and eastern parts of Australia. </p>

<p>The wet weather will provide relief to some of the driest parts of the country, with downpours expected in the country's southeastern corner from Thursday to Sunday.      </p>

<p>'This will result from a pool of cold air from the Southern Ocean a few kilometres above the surface, moving north and interacting with tropical moisture from the north,' said Sky News Weathermeteorologist Tom Saunders.</p>

<p>'The best rain will fall across western and northern South Australia, and southwest Queensland, where around 20 to 50mm is likely to fall, up about two months’ worth of rain for these regions.'</p>

<p>Rain will hit South Australia and southern parts of Victoria on Thursday before moving north east, crossing into NSW and Queensland by Saturday. </p>

<p>The weather extremes will see hot conditions in western parts of the country while rain batters the south and east. Pictured are beach goers enjoying warm weather in Perth  </p>

<p>A Bureau of Meteorology map shows the path of a cut-off low pressure system that will bring rainfall this week as it barrels from the country's south west across to the east</p>

<p>The downpours will hit northwest NSW and southwest Queensland first, before sweeping east across both states on Sunday. </p>

<p>Parts South Australia could be soaked by up to 25mm, while NSW and Queensland can expect up to 20mm. </p>

<p>As the system moves into central parts of Australia, it could bring heavy rain, thunderstorms, flash flooding, damaging winds and dust storms. </p>

<p>But the wild weather is just a taste of more to come, with the country forecast to be drenched more than usual as La Nina settles in the Pacific from next month. </p>

<p>The climate event, associated with increased downpours, will bring an abundance of rain until the rest of the year. </p>

<p>Heading into the weekend, Sydneysiders can expect sunny conditions on Wednesday with a top of 25 before clouds roll in on Thursday. Temperatures will drop to a max of 22 over the weekend with showers on Sunday. </p>

<p>Parts of SA, TAS, VIC, NSW , ACT and QLD can expect to get soaked this weekend as a pressure system sweeps over the country's east. Pictured: A man sheltering from rain in Sydney</p>

<p>Brisbane could see some showers on Wednesday and Friday before a wet weekend. However, temperatures will remain moderately warm with maximums in the mid 20s with lows in the mid to high teens. </p>

<p>Melbournians will need their umbrellas from Thursday, with humid conditions predicted for the weekend amid sporadic rain fall. </p>

<p>Victoria's capital city will see minimum temperatures this week around 10C with Thursday and Friday, the two coolest days, topping at 16C and 19C . Saturday will be the warmest day, climbing to 25C. </p>

<p>Adelaide and Canberra will have maximums sitting close to 20C, remaining grey leading into Saturday and Sunday, when both capital cities can expect to get soaked.</p>

<p>ACT will chill through minimum temperatures below 10C this week, while Adelaide will be slightly warmer with lows ranging from 13C to 17C. </p>

<p>Hobart will be wet the next couple of days before some Friday sunshine with a top of 16C and a low of 6C.  Showers will return for the end of the weekend, with temperatures rising to the low 20s. </p>
