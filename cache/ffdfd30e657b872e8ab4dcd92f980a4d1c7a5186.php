<p>Chic: Jennifer Falconer looked to be recovering well as she put on a stylish display at the Global Radio Studios in London on Monday</p>

<p>She teamed this with skinny jeans which displayed her trim legs and white trainers.</p>

<p>Jenni wore her blonde bob sleek and straight with a rich palette of make-up enhancing her pretty features. </p>

<p>The star added a final elegant touch with a teal handbag. </p>

<p>Earlier this month the broadcaster revealed to MailOnline that her injury has now forced her to abandon plans to take part in the virtual London Marathon.</p>

<p>Smile: The presenter, 44, looked chic in a navy and hot pink patterned blouse paired with a black blazer as she stepped out</p>

<p>She said: 'A few weeks ago I sustained a stress fracture on my 3rd metatarsal. Frustratingly it’s very hard to spot on an X-ray and so it took quite a while to diagnose.</p>

<p>'Anyway, it happened six weeks ago and thankfully it is repairing well so I have to wear a support boot whilst I’m walking around to limit further damage until it fully mends.</p>

<p>'It was a consequence of excessive running in lockdown whilst preparing for the virtual London marathon. </p>

<p>'Sadly it means I can no longer run on October 4th but should be back running home from work in a month!'</p>

<p>Away from radio, it was recently announced that the health conscious star is the face and voice of newly launched fitness app Start 2 Run.</p>

<p>The app is ideal for people who need help getting started running as well as people who want to up their running mileage or aim for a particular running distance goal.</p>

<p>Users will have Jenni with them for all their training sessions, encouraging and motivating, as well as providing tips and pointers. </p>
