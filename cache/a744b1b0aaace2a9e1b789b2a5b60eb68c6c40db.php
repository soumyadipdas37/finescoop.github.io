<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher believe Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek has failed to make the most of his opportunities at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>The English midfielder has had multiple injury setbacks, including a long spell on the sidelines from March 2019 to June of this year. </p>

<p>Loftus-Cheek was given a starting berth by manager Frank Lampard on Monday night against Brighton but he was taken off after 61 minutes.</p>

<p>Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek had long spell on sidelines from March 2019 to June 2020</p>

<p>And former defenders Neville and Carragher believe he could have no complaints if Chelsea decided to offload him.  </p>

<p>'I thought, Loftus-Cheek, he's been given his chance,' Neville told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'I thought he was really disappointing. I don't think Loftus-Cheek can complain. He's been given games. </p>

<p>Pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher believe Loftus-Cheek has failed to take his chances</p>

<p>'I don't think he's ever grasped his chance yet. There's going to come a point when they're going to cash in and get £25million for him.'</p>

<p>The Blues secured a 3-1 victory at Brighton in their opening game of the Premier League season with goals from Jorginho, Reece James and Kurt Zouma proving enough.</p>

<p>Loftus-Cheek showcased his burgeoning talent on loan at Crystal Palace in the 2017-18 campaign, and has impressed while winning 10 caps for England, but Carragher agreed with his colleague that the 24-year-old has not seized his chances at Chelsea.</p>

<p>'When he was at Crystal Palace you thought "what a player",' Carragher told Sky Sports. </p>

<p>'He's got to say he wants to play every single week. He's not grabbed his chance tonight. If you get your chance you have to grab it. He's had his chances now.'</p>

<p>Midfielder Loftus-Cheek started at Brighton on Monday but was replaced on the hour mark</p>
