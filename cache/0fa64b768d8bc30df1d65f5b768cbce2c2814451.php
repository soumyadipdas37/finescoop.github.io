<p>Feeling jealous: Kris Jenner showed off her jealous side in the latest teaser for Keeping Up With The Kardashians </p>

<p>Baby mine: The 64-year-old momager was miffed when her 39-year-old beau Corey Gamble started lavishing all his attention on their pooch Bridget</p>

<p>'Kris is the one that wanted a dog, but I'm doing like 99.7% of all dog duties,' Corey shared with the viewers in a confessional. </p>

<p>'So what I think I gotta do now is all the attention that I used to give Kris, I think I gotta just give it all to Bridget. So maybe this could actually get her attention and she'll start giving me a little support and help on the parenting side.'</p>

<p>At the start of the clip Corey and Kris bundled into the car together and his 'favorite person on the planet' Bridget clambered into the back.</p>

<p>Making it happen: Little did Kris know that Corey was playacting at being obsessed with the dog in order to needle her about not doing much of the work of caring for Bridget</p>

<p>The truth will out: 'Kris is the one that wanted a dog, but I'm doing like 99.7% of all dog duties,' Corey shared with the viewers in a confessional</p>

<p>His plan: ''So what I think I gotta do now is all the attention that I used to give Kris, I think I gotta just give it all to Bridget,' he shared</p>

<p>There's an idea: He explained: 'So maybe this could actually get her attention and she'll start giving me a little support and help on the parenting side'</p>

<p>Trio: At the start of the clip Corey and Kris bundled into the car together and his 'favorite person on the planet' Bridget clambered into the back</p>

<p>Kris noted they were 'supposed to be going to lunch' but Corey said he 'wanted to bring the baby because she should be at lunch with us.'</p>

<p>When they arrived at the restaurant Corey opened the door for 'my little sweetheart' Bridget prompting Kris to mouth to the camera: 'What happened to my door?'</p>

<p>After they were seated Corey ordered a grilled chicken breast side order 'for my sweet little daughter,' much to Kris' bemusement.</p>

<p>Wine arrived and Corey toasted to 'good health, more wealth, and lots of love, right, Bridget?' prompting Kris to give the camera a sidelong glance.</p>

<p>En route: Kris noted they were 'supposed to be going to lunch' but Corey said he 'wanted to bring the baby because she should be at lunch with us'</p>

<p>Neglect: When they arrived at the restaurant Corey opened the door for 'my little sweetheart' Bridget prompting Kris to mouth to the camera: 'What happened to my door?'</p>

<p>Corey started rattling off plans to bring Bridget on a Palm Springs trip and to a Lakers game and to get her a customized watch.</p>

<p>'What?' said Kris as he waxed rhapsodic about the dog. 'Are you insane?' to which Corey cradled Bridget and said: 'I'm insane for her.'</p>

<p>When Kris vamped that she had 'some competition,' Corey said: 'Competition? No one comes before Bridget.'</p>

<p>Corey, who began dating Kris in 2014, said: 'There's Bridget, then the world. She's number one, and  you're...Kris.'</p>

<p>Cheers: After they were seated Corey ordered a grilled chicken breast side order 'for my sweet little daughter,' much to Kris' bemusement</p>

<p>Seriously?: Wine arrived and Corey toasted to 'good health, more wealth, and lots of love, right, Bridget?' prompting Kris to give the camera a sidelong glance</p>

<p>His ruse appeared to be working on Kris as she said in a confessional: 'Corey really thinks that he's Bridget's dad, like for real.'</p>

<p>The current season premiered last week on the heels of news that Keeping Up With The Kardashians was coming to an end on E! after more than a decade. </p>

<p>Keeping Up With The Kardashians soldiered on for 18 seasons after it first started in 2007 and made superstars out of Kris and all six of her children.</p>

<p>Early last week a Page Six report alleged that Khloe Kardashian and Scott Disick were against the cancellation of the show.</p>

<p>Big ideas: Corey started rattling off plans to bring Bridget on a Palm Springs trip and to a Lakers game and to get her a customized watch</p>

<p>Banter: 'What?' said Kris as he waxed rhapsodic about the dog. 'Are you insane?' to which Corey cradled Bridget and said: 'I'm insane for her'</p>

<p>By way of explaining their opposition to the cancellation the insider said: 'Some of them needed the money more than others.'</p>

<p>Scott shares three children with Kris' eldest daughter Kourtney Kardashian - sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, and daughter Penelope, eight. </p>

<p>Although there were rumors that Kourtney and Kim Kardashian, as well as Kylie Jenner, pushed for the show to end, the family has denied as much.</p>

<p>The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for the whole family who made the decision together.</p>

<p>Laying it on thick: When Kris vamped that she had 'some competition,' Corey said: 'Competition? No one comes before Bridget'</p>

<p>Their denial came in the wake of a source telling The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'</p>

<p>To hear this source tell it: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'</p>

<p>However the Sun also had a different insider claim that the Kardashian-Jenner family jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.</p>

<p>'She's number one, and you're...Kris': Corey, who began dating Kris in 2014, said: 'There's Bridget, then the world'</p>

<p>Skillful actor: His ruse appeared to be working on Kris as she said in a confessional: 'Corey really thinks that he's Bridget's dad, like for real'</p>
