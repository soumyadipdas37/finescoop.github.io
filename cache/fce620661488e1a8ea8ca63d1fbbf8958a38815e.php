<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Porto have informed the Portuguese stock exchange they will pay Jorge Mendes' Gestifute agency £6.4m out of the £35m transfer fee they received from Wolves for Fabio Silva.</p>

<p>The Premier League outfit completed the mega-money move for the 18-year-old attacker last week, setting a new club record for a transfer fee in the process.</p>

<p>Now, according to a number of reports in Portugal on Thursday, it has emerged that some of that money will make its way to Mendes, even though he is not Silva's agent.</p>

<p>18-year-old striker Fabio Silva completed a £35m move from Porto to Wolves last week</p>

<p>Some of that money is going to Gestifute agency that is run by super agent Jorge Mendes </p>

<p>The 18-year-old is represented by the company Soccer Talents Vision (STV), who were alongside him when he put pen to paper on a five-year deal with Wolves.</p>

<p>Fosun International, the company that own Wolves, have previously said that Mendes is an advisor at the club. </p>

<p>Manager Nuno is represented by Mendes' Gestifute company, as well as a number of players. Rui Patricio, Joao Moutinho, Ruben Neves, Diogo Jota, Pedro Neto and Raul Jimenez are also signed to Gestifute.</p>

<p>Matt Doherty, the former Wolves right-back, also switched from his agent to Gestifute while at Wolves, according to The Times back in January.</p>

<p>Silva could make his debut for Wolves against Sheffield United on September 14</p>

<p>Doherty left Wolves for Tottenham earlier this month and Tottenham's manager, Jose Mourinho, is also represented by Mendes.</p>

<p>Mendes' influence stretches throughout football but it clearly runs particularly deep at Wolves. </p>

<p>Wolves start the Premier League season on Monday, away to Sheffield United where Silva could make his debut.</p>
