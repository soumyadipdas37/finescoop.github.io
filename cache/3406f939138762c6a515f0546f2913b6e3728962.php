<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Muslim Australian woman is using her social media following to inspire young girls of faith to celebrate their religion through fashion.</p>

<p>Yasmin Jay is a Sydney based fashion designer and model who boasts nearly 150,000 followers on her Instagram profile.</p>

<p>The proud Muslim woman's feed showcases her incredible sense of style, matching her hijab with Gucci designer outfits, jewellery and accessories.</p>

<p>Ms Jay started using social media at 15 and has grown her following by providing an authentic window into her life and faith in her online presence. </p>

<p>Yasmin Jay (pictured) uses her social media channels to empower young Muslim women</p>

<p>'My page is a modest fashion page and I basically post up images of me styling my different outfits,' Ms Jay told ABC Radio National.</p>

<p>'I blog my everyday life and when I travel or go to events, so it's pretty much my platform to express myself.'</p>

<p>Ms Jay said she didn't go searching for fame and believes her page became popular through posting genuine examples of her faith in fashion.</p>

<p>'Faith is definitely something that is related to modest fashion. I wear the hijab, so wearing the hijab we dress modestly,' she said.</p>

<p>'Modesty isn't just about the way you dress, but it's how you speak and carry yourself, how you talk to people.</p>

<p>'It's so much more than just how you look.'</p>

<p>Ms Jay is a Sydney-based model and fashion designer who boasts nearly 150,000 Instagram followers</p>

<p>Ms Jay works two other jobs and said she doesn't want to identify as an influencer, considering her page a visual diary into her daily life.</p>

<p>She collaborates with brands for sponsored content and wants her page to be a positive source of inspiration for young Muslim women.</p>

<p>'Because this has turned into a job I do have to make sure I'm being consistent and making sure my engagement is up,' Ms Jay said.</p>

<p>'Because if I am getting paid for a certain post I do put that expectation on myself to make it beautiful and amazing and it actually does well to best represent the business.</p>

<p>'But as well I make sure it's as authentic as possible to myself.'</p>

<p>Ms Jay believes her account's authenticity with her faith is what has made it resonate with fans</p>

<p>Ms Jay said she feels empowered when wearing a hijab and hopes her channels will help to change the negative perception of oppressed Muslim women in the media.</p>

<p>'I wanted [my page] to mean a lot more than me basically posting a photo. I wanted to build a community where I could allow girls to feel confident and empowered, especially wearing a scarf,' she said.</p>

<p>'Especially in the media, hijabi girls receive so much criticism. I want to be that voice where I can represent our community. </p>

<p>'Just because you wear the scarf and the media says one, two, three, it does not stop you from achieving what you want to achieve.</p>

<p>'Me wearing the hijab does not stop me, it only empowers me and makes me want to push even more.'</p>

<p>Ms Jay wants her channels to be a positive inspiration for young Muslim women and stay true to her faith</p>
