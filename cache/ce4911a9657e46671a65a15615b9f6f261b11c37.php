<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Five-time world champion Raymond Van Barneveld is set to end his brief retirement after announcing plans to attend next year's PDC Qualifying School in a bid to win back his tour card.</p>

<p>The 53-year-old Dutchman, winner of 29 PDC titles, brought the curtain down on his glittering career at the end of 2019 after he suffered a first-round World Championship defeat to Darin Young at Alexandra Palace.</p>

<p>He had initially announced his intention to retire after suffering elimination from the Premier League in Rotterdam last March before reversing his decision the following day.</p>

<p>Raymond Van Barneveld is set to end his brief retirement from darts and return next year</p>

<p>But Van Barneveld is ready to end 12 months away from the oche and return in early 2021 after linking up with former manager Ben De Kok.</p>

<p>'It's very simple. I miss it. I miss it terribly,' Van Barneveld explained to RTL News.</p>

<p>'I think the decision (to retire) was the right one, but I have now had a lot of time to think about it. Then I realised I miss it terribly.</p>

<p>'I now have a unique opportunity to realise my dream and to work in a team. I think that is the solution for me.</p>

<p>The 53-year-old will attend the PDC Qualifying School in a bid to win back his tour card</p>

<p>'Because I haven't been myself for the past two or three years, you don't always make the right decisions.</p>

<p>'Your head is haunted and you're a nightmare for everyone. But that's different now. I'm looking forward to it.</p>

<p>'I signed for three years, so we have the chance to at least get a tour card for three years. If I want to get my tour card, I will have to do my best.'</p>
