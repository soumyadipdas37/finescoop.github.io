<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Coronavirus vaccines might leave us laid up for a day with headaches, fevers, sore muscles, shivering chills and no energy, participants in trials for Moderna's and Pfizer's shots told CNBC. </p>

<p>But the side effects will be worth it, and fade after a day, they added. </p>

<p>Vaccines of all kinds commonly come with side effects - some more unpleasant than others. </p>

<p>Luke Hutchinsons, 44, was prepared for that possibility after signing up to help test whether Moderna's shot worked, safely. </p>

<p>He felt a bit less than 100 percent for a few days after the first dose but eight hours after his second dose on September 15, the healthy computational biologist was too weak to leave bed, running a high fever and writhing with pain and shivers. </p>

<p>It even got harder for Hutchinson to breathe. The experimental COVID-19 vaccine left him feeling like he'd contracted the virus it was meant to protect him against. </p>

<p>He wasn't the only one. CNBC spoke to two other participants in the Moderna trial and two enrolled in Pfizer's vaccine trial, all of whom reported intense - but thankfully brief - side effects. </p>

<p>In addition to their side effects, the vaccine testers share the opinion that most people should still get a COVID-19 vaccine, once one has been approved. </p>

<p>Luke Hutchinson, 44, volunteered to participate in Moderna's coronavirus vaccine trial. After his second dose of the shot, he developed a fever, aches that left him bedridden for the day and with chills so bad he cracked a tooth while shaking. He told CNBC he wishes he'd had warning, but thinks  the shot's protection is worth the discomfort. </p>

<p>His first shot left Hutchinson with just mild side effects, but he compared his symptoms to 'full-on COVID' after the second shot </p>

<p>They also have some advice for the vaccine makers: warn people what they are in for after getting their shots. </p>

<p>'If this proves to work, people are going to have to toughen up,' another Moderna trial participant told CNBC.</p>

<p>'The first dose is no big deal. And then the second dose will definitely put you down for the day for sure....You will need to take a day off after the second dose,' added the North Carolina woman, who is in her 50s. </p>

<p>Some Excedrin carried her through the worst of her side effects. </p>

<p>She also spoke to other participants via Facebook that described arm pain similar to what's expected after a tetanus shot. </p>

<p>Hutchinson described feeling like he had a 'goose egg' on his shoulder at the site of the second injection. </p>

<p>He shivered so violently through the tormented night after the shot that he cracked one of his teeth. </p>

<p>Hutchinson described his experience as 'full-blown COVID-19 symptoms.'  </p>

<p>But 12 hours later, it all stopped. His temperature returned to normal, the aches and pains subsided. He was his energetic self again.  </p>

<p>A Maryland participant in Moderna's trial in his 20s spent a similarly unpleasant night wrestling with a fever and chills after his second dose. </p>

<p>He called Moderna, which responded quickly to tell him to report the symptoms via an app. </p>

<p>'I wasn’t sure if I needed to go to the hospital or not because 104 is pretty high,' he told CNBC.</p>

<p>'But other than that, it’s been fine.'</p>

<p>The participants in the Pfizer trial did not elaborate on their experiences, but had similar symptoms, according to CNBC. </p>

<p>So far, data from Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccine trials have suggested they do trigger the production of antibodies against coronavirus, and are safe. </p>

<p>According to their published studies on the shots, volunteers who develop side effects are the minority, and the side effects they do develop are mild,or moderate. </p>

<p>They describe similar symptoms to those reported by the volunteers, but without first-hand details, the side effects sound on paper much less noticeable than they do when recounted by people who went through them. </p>

<p>But other trial participants - including older ones - have also come forward saying they have had no side effects. </p>

<p>Moderna's coronavirus vaccine triggered a strong antibody response in older adults, and only triggered 'severe' side effects in two volunteers, recently published data from the firm's phase 2 testing showed. </p>

<p>Two doses of the shot were given to each of about 40 volunteers, ages 56 to 70 and older.</p>

<p>All of the patients enrolled to the the study developed 'neutralizing' antibodies to coronavirus - the kinds of immune cells thought to be most capable of shutting down the virus and stopping it from infecting our cells. </p>

<p>About 80 percent of people who have died of coronavirus are older, making the safety of any vaccines against COVID-19 in aging populations paramount.  </p>

<p>The 'severe' side effects included loss of appetite, fatigue that lasted days, and a high fever - which is particularly dangerous in older people.  </p>

<p>With the election just over a month away, and President Trump promoting the possibility of a vaccine being given emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), concerns are rising over the safety of COVID-19 shots.</p>

<p>Companies and public health experts are on high alert after AstraZeneca's trial was paused after a participant developed a dangerous spinal cord problem after getting the shot. </p>

<p>Now, as the trials near their ends, the scientists conducting them, people participating in them, and officials examining the data from the tests are walking a fine line between being careful to ensure the safety of a shot, and to ensure that people will take it. </p>

<p>'If it gets approved, I still think a lot of people should get the vaccine,' said a participant in Pfizer's trial. </p>

<p>'And I hope that all the side effects are made clear upfront.'  </p>
