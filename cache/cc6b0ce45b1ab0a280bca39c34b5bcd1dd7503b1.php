<p>The soap star enthused: 'I always wanted to have a baby, that's what I've always wanted. I think it's just made me a lot happier, and gives you perspective and helps you rationalise what's important. I think it gives you a real purpose.</p>

<p>'I feel like my girls make me feel like I can do anything. I love being a mum, I love everything of it. Sometimes I'm like 'this is going to be really difficult' because I'm tired or whatever, but it is amazing as well and I really enjoy it. </p>

<p>She also said she would love to have two more children and is confident she can twist footballer partner Scott's arm.</p>

<p>'I really want to have four', she said at the time. 'I think Scott's like 'maybe three' but I don't know, we'll see how we go, but I definitely want more. I'm sure I'll get my own way eventually.' </p>
