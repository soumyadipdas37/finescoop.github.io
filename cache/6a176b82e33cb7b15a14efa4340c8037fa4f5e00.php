<p>The brief clip shows the white Labrador and brown pitbull cross sitting up straight as they watch the world go by. </p>

<p>An Australian car passenger leans out of the window to capture the bizarre encounter. </p>

<p>He is heard saying: 'What are you two on? </p>

<p>'I don't know who you are, and who you belong to but why are you sitting on chairs like that?' </p>

<p>The man then turned his camera around and filmed the two dogs sitting peacefully together in a neighbour's yard. </p>

<p>An Australian man was stunned when he spotted two dogs relaxing in lawn chairs (pictured) while he was on his way home from work on Monday</p>

<p>'That scared the **** outta me,' he said. </p>

<p>The video was shared to social media on Monday and has already been viewed more than 80,000 times.  </p>

<p>'Those dogs are up to something they have a plan to take over,' one user wrote. </p>

<p>'Oooo both turned their head at the same time, creepy stuff,' another added.</p>

<p>'I don't know what's funnier, the dogs using the chairs or the owner placed them there just for them,' a third replied. </p>

<p>The man said he had to turn around and get some video of the dogs (pictured) who looked unfazed when he pulled up to question them</p>
