<p>Mr Pickford said Gabbriela left her mother's house at about 10pm without money or her phone, shortly after downloading Instagram on her sibling's iPad. </p>

<p>The family hasn't heard from the 13-year-old since Friday and she didn't show up for class at Runcorn State High School on Monday or Tuesday.  </p>

<p>'Come home, just come home. Where are you? Come home,' Mr Pickford pleaded. </p>

<p>He said his daughter had never spent more than a night away from home by herself and it was out of character for her not to contact the family.   </p>
