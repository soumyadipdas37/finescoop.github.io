<p>An Adelaide man has been charged over an alleged plot to import 20kg of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $20million, into South Australia from Greece</p>

<p>A joint agency investigation was launched last week after ABF officers in South Australia selected an air cargo consignment labelled as welding for examination</p>

<p>A wooden crate containing two welding machines was X-rayed, with anomalies revealed in both.</p>

<p>ABF officers removed a panel from one piece of machinery and found an electronic safe.</p>

<p>Inside the safe were nine rectangular packages that allegedly contained a white powder, with tests returning a presumptive positive result to cocaine.</p>

<p>AFP officers were called in and dismantled the second welder, where they found another safe with nine similar packages stored inside.</p>

<p>Forensic tests by the AFP confirmed the 18 seized packages contained about 20kg of cocaine.</p>

<p>This equates to about 20,000 street level deals, which police say can be sold for about $5million wholesale and has an approximate street value of $20million.</p>

<p>Police allege the Adelaide man had organised the consignment and arranged for it to be delivered to his former workplace, without the knowledge of the business owners.</p>

<p>It is also alleged he made inquiries to the freight company about when the consignment would be available.</p>

<p>The man was arrested at his Adelaide home, where police seized electronic devices and documentation allegedly connected to the consignment.</p>

<p>He was charged him with importing a commercial quantity of border-controlled drugs and is expected to appear in Adelaide Magistrates Court on Wednesday.</p>
