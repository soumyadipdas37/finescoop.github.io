<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A brattish banker has copped a mere $1,000 fine after ignoring flight crew instructions and attempting to kick police officers.    </p>

<p>Citibank Sydney managing director Thomas Hasan Dunmore Cribb, 39, threw his mid-air tantrum on a Qantas flight from Sydney to Auckland on February 21. </p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to the obstruction of a Commonwealth officer and failing to comply with crew instructions on Tuesday, The Australian Financial Review reported. </p>

<p>Citibank Sydney managing director Thomas Cribb (pictured above) faced court in Sydney on Tuesday after disruptive behaviour on a Qantas flight from Sydney to Auckland on February 21</p>

<p>Cribb repeatedly ignored cabin crew instructions and attempted to kick at police officers who were called to Sydney Airport (NSW Police officers pictured at Sydney Airport) </p>

<p>The executive, who was dubbed part of 'generation next' at the US bank, faced Sydney's Downing Centre Court over his outburst. </p>

<p>The court heard how Cribb became a nuisance after asking for another scotch an hour before the plane was due to land. </p>

<p>Cribb introduced himself twice to the man sitting in front of him and had a loud conversation on his phone when electronic devices weren't allowed. </p>

<p>He then got up to use the bathroom despite at least five requests from a flight attendant to return to his seat.   </p>

<p>The plane's captain called Australian Federal Police officers to meet the flight at the gate and remove Cribb. </p>

<p>Cribb, a single father from Surry Hills, whined as he left the flight and launched a tirade of abuse at officers.    </p>

<p>'How dare you. I can't believe this is Australia, am I under arrest? </p>

<p>'You have no idea who I am. You don't realise how big a mistake you've just made. You're gone. I'm taking your badge. You've just f****d up,' Cribb told police. </p>

<p>Cribb later apologised for lashing out at police and the court heard the Citibank executive would be receiving a salary cut (Citibank headquarters pictured in New York city) </p>

<p>Cribb demanded to see a Qantas staff member and a scuffle broke out as police attempted to arrest the banker.  </p>

<p>The 39-year-old then tried to kick at two of the officers as he was tackled to the ground.   </p>

<p>Cribb told police he wouldn't say anything until he could call speak to his lawyer but later apologised to an officer for injuring his thumb.   </p>

<p>'Yeah, I f****d up. I'm really sorry. I had a few drinks,' he told officers at the AFP's Sydney police station.   </p>

<p>Cribb's lawyer said the banker had faced the Citibank board and would have his salary reduced after the incident. </p>

<p>His lawyer also noted Cribb had provided multiple 'glowing' character references that described him as 'a gentle soul'.  </p>

<p>Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson said she had taken into account Cribb's remorse, his lack of prior offences and the character references. </p>

<p>She ordered Cribb to continue seeing his psychologist and placed him on a two years good behaviour bond without conviction. </p>

<p>Cribb was fined $1,000 and ordered to continue to see his psychologist. He was placed on a two-year good behaviour bond (Qantas planes at Sydney International Airport pictured)  </p>
