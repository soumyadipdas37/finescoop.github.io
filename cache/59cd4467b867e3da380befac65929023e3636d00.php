<p>Vogue, who is mother to son Theodore, two, and daughter Gigi, six weeks, admitted she was glad that Spencer isn't 'into boobs'. </p>

<p>She quipped: 'I don't usually have any so that suits me down to the ground if you're not into boobs'.</p>

<p>As Spencer asked if she'd ever consider implants, Vogue replied: 'Hmm no, you know what I always thought I'd like a little bit of a boob and then I got them when I was breastfeeding and I'm not really that into them, they are a bit annoying'.</p>

<p>As she admitted that she was a on a mission to 'get a bigger bum', Spencer interjected, 'I'm more of an a** man, myself. </p>

<p>'When I first met Vogue, she was obsessed with training her rear-end so she would go to the gym, specifically to make her a** bigger, which is odd...  </p>

<p>'I think you look much better now and you just had a child'.</p>

<p>Body insecuriturities are clearly not an issue that plague Spencer, however, as he stated that 'clothes are very rarely necessary'.</p>

<p>The former Made In Chelsea admitted to being so comfortable in the nude that he has walked around in front of Vogue's parents without any clothing on. </p>

<p>Vogue and Spencer met while filming The Jump in 2017 and wed the following year. </p>
