<p>The Catalan giants appointed Ronald Koeman as Quique Setien's successor on a two-year deal earlier this month following a miserable season. </p>

<p>Barcelona presidential candidate Toni Freixa believes Pep Guardiola could return to Nou Camp</p>

<p>Toni Freixa (above) sees no reason why the Manchester City manager won't go back one day</p>

<p>'Pep once let it be known that he would like to head the Barca academy in the future, but he would also be a wonderful solution for the first team,' he told Goal. </p>

<p>'The important thing is that the team plays successful and exciting football again, and that nothing like what happened against Bayern happens.</p>

<p>'They exposed us for over 90 minutes, all the mistakes and failures of the team, but even more so the weaknesses of the sporting leadership in recent years. It was the end of the end. Now it's time for a change.'</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman was appointed as Quique Setien's successor on a two-year deal this month</p>

<p>Barcelona saw rivals Real Madrid lift the LaLiga title in the 2019-20 campaign and were also humiliated by Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals, losing 8-2. </p>

<p>Guardiola won two Champions Leagues as well as three LaLiga trophies when at the helm between 2008 and 2012 and has previously stated that he wants to finish his coaching career where it all started, at Barcelona B. </p>

<p>He took charge of the youth side for a year before being handed the reins of the No 1 position at the LaLiga giants. </p>
