<p>The date marked the sixth anniversary of Joan's death at the age of 81 after she stopped breathing while under anesthesia for a vocal cord procedure.</p>

<p>'It’s hard to believe that my mother has been gone for six years now,' wrote Melissa, 52, in a message on Joan's Instagram.</p>

<p>'I miss her dearly': Melissa Rivers played tribute to her late mother Joan Rivers on Instagram Friday, the sixth anniversary of Joan's death at the age of 81</p>

<p>'Not a day goes by where I don’t think about her - her words still guide me and of course make me laugh. I miss her dearly,' she continued.</p>

<p>Melissa and Joan not only had a personally close mother-daughter relationship but also frequently worked together over the years.</p>

<p>The dynamic duo performed red carpet coverage together near the beginning of the genre when Joan coined the phrase: 'Who are you wearing?'</p>

<p>Melissa was also a producer on Joan's hit show Fashion Police - and eventually hosted it after Joan died and her first replacement Kathy Griffin quit.</p>

<p>At the end of the comedian's life she starred with her daughter on a WEtv reality series called Joan And Melissa: Joan Knows Best?.</p>

<p>The show also prominently featured Melissa's son Cooper, whom she shares with her ex-husband John Endicott and who was very close with Joan.</p>

<p>Cooper gifted Melissa a flower arrangement on the death anniversary this Friday with a note reminding her: 'Grandma is always with us. I love you.' </p>

<p>Joan experienced complications in late August 2015 during her throat procedure and was put in a medically induced coma from which she never woke up.</p>

<p>Federal investigators looked into the matter and uncovered multiple mistakes involving the throat procedure at the endoscopy clinic. </p>

<p>Melissa sued the clinic and the doctors who did the surgery for malpractice, eventually receiving a settlement and an admission of their responsibility.</p>

<p>Joan shared Melissa with her second husband Edgar Rosenberg whom she was married to from 1965 until his suicide in 1987.</p>

<p>That year Joan had lost her late-night talk show at Fox after taking sides with Edgar, a producer on the show, against network honcho Barry Diller.</p>

<p>Although Melissa and Joan went through a rough patch after the suicide they mended fences and played themselves in a TV movie about that time. </p>
