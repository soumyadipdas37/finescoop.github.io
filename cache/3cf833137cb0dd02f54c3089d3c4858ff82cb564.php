<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A heavily-tattooed former Bandidos chapter president has revealed how he became a member of the club after a tough childhood in country Australia. </p>

<p>Bjorn Steven Luba, 35, uploaded a video to the Instagram account of the clothing company he owns, Criminal Muscle, on Monday night. </p>

<p>Mr Luba said he lived in Switzerland until he moved to Australia when he was 10-years-old, enlisted in the Army after high school and eventually joined the outlaw motorcycle gang.  </p>

<p>Mr Luba (pictured with partner) said he lived in Switzerland until he moved to Australia at ten-years-old, enlisted in the Army after high school and joined the outlaw motorcycle gang  </p>

<p>He explained that the reason he believes he was able to survive the brutal world of motorcycle gangs was because he was humble. </p>

<p>'Whether I was a prospect or a president never once did I act like I was better than anybody. I went to an event in Melbourne and had a conversation with a prospect who was blown away that a president was speaking to him,' Mr Luba said. </p>

<p>He opens the video by explaining he would ride his bike 'three towns over' as a young kid in Switzerland to buy cassette tapes using coins he would pinch from his mother's wallet. </p>

<p>Mr Luba said he was left on his own a lot as his mother had a good job at a horse stables and would run amok - adding that the other children and even the teachers were scared of him. </p>

<p>He said he then moved to Australia with his mother and his step-father where they lived at a number of southern Queensland towns. </p>

<p>Mr Luba's weekends would be spent shovelling horse manure, which Mr Luba claims his parents would make him do because they knew it annoyed him, until he eventually got a job at a local fruit market. </p>

<p>He explained he his way up through the ranks and eventually became president of his chapter in south-east Queensland - though he explains he has now left the club 'for certain reasons' </p>

<p>He warned young people that being in a club was not like a 'game' or 'movie' and that he witnessed some brutal events </p>

<p>He would earn $5-an-hour packing fruit and milk crates - usually sitting in the cool room with the door open to avoid the Queensland heat - though he added the Filipino ladies who ran the shop were 'cool'. </p>

<p>After high school, Mr Luba joined the Army where he completed a tour of Iraq. </p>

<p>When he returned to the country he was introduced to some Bandido club members who encouraged him the join the outlaw motorcycle gang. </p>

<p>Mr Luba said he worked his way up through the ranks and eventually became president of his chapter in south-east Queensland - though he explains he has now left the club 'for certain reasons'. </p>

<p>While he said it would be 'hypocritical' of him to tell other young people not to join a motorcycle gang he urged his followers to 'be wise'. </p>

<p>He warned young people that being in a club was not like a 'game' or 'movie' and that he witnessed some brutal events - adding anyone should think very carefully if they were considering joining.  </p>

<p>'The incident that made me leave - which I will also not get into cause that is a personal matter - after that I had a meeting with another club who asked me if I was going to go anywhere else,' Mr Luba said. </p>

<p>He said he told the men: 'the only place I will go back to is the Bandidos - otherwise I'm done with it, they respected that'. </p>

<p>'Loyalty is important if you go to one club and then go to another club willy-nilly it don't look good'. </p>

<p>Mr Luba has opened a clothing business which he markets online </p>

<p>He also had a warning for young people looking to make a name for themselves. </p>

<p>'There are people I respect from other clubs but they didn't make a name for themselves in a few minutes, they did that over years,' he said. </p>

<p>'If you walk around saying the other clubs aint sh*t that is what will get you got. We're all rowing in the same direction but there's always a few individuals who try to row the other way and those are the ones that get thrown off the boat.' </p>

<p>Mr Luba said he realised he had a good run with his club and that he wanted to leave on a high. </p>

<p>His parting advice for his followers was that 'there is always someone bigger than you to put you on you a** so be humble and you will gain respect'. </p>
