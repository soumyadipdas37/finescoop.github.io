<p>'For me labelling my brand 'Joy Smithers Ceramics' or using my face to sell the brand would be a bastardisation of something that has been so spiritual for me since I was 13,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald.</p>

<p>'This is a career highlight for me because I love The Block! It's the best comedy and the best drama,' she began. </p>

<p>'Working with the teams was very funny as no one had any experience working with clay before – they tried to do Ghost but it was more like a scene from Amityville Horror!' joked Joy, calling the challenge a 'clay catastrophy'. </p>
