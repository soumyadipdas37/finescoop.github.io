<p>The 28-year-old goalkeeper is set to sign a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge and will compete with under-fire keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga for the No 1 jersey. </p>

<p>Blues boss Frank Lampard confirmed the Senegalese would be a Chelsea player subject to being given the all-clear following the medical test and also praised Petr Cech for his role in bringing Mendy to the club.</p>

<p>Edouard Mendy is currently undergoing a medical ahead of his £22m move to Chelsea </p>

<p>Frank Lampard praised the role of technical and performance advisor Petr Cech in the deal</p>

<p>Lampard said: 'Petr was important in that. It's a particular position and he has had a big say and was very instrumental.'</p>

<p>The Chelsea manager was however sympathetic towards Arrizabalaga's situation following a string of high-profile mistakes.  </p>

<p>'I think competition is a regular thing at a club like Chelsea. The goalkeeper situation isn’t always as clear cut as that. Kepa himself wants to improve his own performances,' Lampard added. </p>

<p>'It’s in everyone’s hands to push and develop to try and get in the team. I am not making any final statements at all in this minute.</p>

<p>'It is the hardest position because of the individual nature of it and mistakes get punished with goals. I understand that and as a manager I have to be sympathetic to that point. I am very aware of that.'</p>

<p>The Blues boss is also hopeful that Mendy will be in the squad to face West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday.  </p>

<p>'As far as I'm aware, as long as he passes his test with us on Thursday and if that is negative then he should be okay to play.'</p>
