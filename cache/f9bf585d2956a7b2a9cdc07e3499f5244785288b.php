<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea are reportedly close to agreeing a fee with Rennes for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy as Frank Lampard continues to strengthen his first-team squad this summer. </p>

<p>The Blues have been heavily linked with a move for the 28-year-old, with a transfer being driven by ex-Chelsea keeper and technical and performance advisor Petr Cech. </p>

<p>In addition, Lampard is not keen on stopping his £200m summer spending spree there, with Lille defensive midfielder Boubakary Soumare an option if a move for West Ham's Declan Rice does not materialise, according to The Athletic. </p>

<p>Chelsea are closing in on a deal for highly-rated Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy</p>

<p>The Blues are still looking to strengthen in defensive midfield, with Declan Rice a top target</p>

<p>Lille's Boubakary Soumare is another option as Frank Lampard continues to splash the cash</p>

<p>The report details that the Chelsea manager is still looking to strengthen in the defensive midfield area ahead of the transfer window closing on October 5. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a move for highly-rated keeper Mendy - with a £14m bid already rejected according to reports - would call into question the future of current No 1 Kepa Arrizabalaga.  </p>

<p>The Spaniard was dropped for the final three games of last season after some inconsistent performances. </p>

<p>Frank Lampard has already spent more than £200m on a host of signings during this window</p>

<p>Willy Caballero was preferred for the final Premier League game of the season against Wolves, the FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal and the Champions League last-16 second-leg loss to Bayern Munich.  </p>

<p>A £71million signing from Athletic Bilbao in 2018, Kepa has endured a tough two seasons in English football, with his first overshadowed by an on-pitch row with then-manager Maurizio Sarri during the 2019 Carabao Cup final at Wembley. </p>

<p>That being said, Kepa did win the Europa League under Sarri and has played 69 of 76 Premier League games in the past two years. </p>

<p>Current Chelsea No 1 Kepa Arrizabalaga has endured a tricky two years at Stamford Bridge</p>

<p>Chelsea technical and performance advisor Petr Cech insists 'nobody is giving up on Kepa'</p>

<p>Cech told reporters in his native Czech republic last week: 'Additions will be made to the squad, perhaps even in goal, and this is what is being discussed now. </p>

<p>'But nobody is giving up on Kepa and we all hope he has a great future.' </p>

<p>Chelsea have also reportedly pondered moves for Atletico Madrid shot-stopper Jan Oblak and Burnley's Nick Pope.</p>
