<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Danniella Westbrook has admitted her past substance abuse problems made her a bad mum.</p>

<p>The former EastEnders actress, 46, who had struggled with a cocaine addiction and relapsed in 2014 after 14 years of sobriety, admitted her issues meant she 'wasn't present' in her children Kai and Jodie's lives.</p>

<p>The media personality said on her 23-year-old son's Firecast podcast: 'It's caused you nothing but heartache and pain. It's about consistency, love, nurturing, stability. All right, I was clean for 14 years. But before that your life was s***.'</p>

<p>'Your life was s***': Danniella Westbrook has admitted her past substance abuse made her a bad mum (pictured with then-husband Kevin Jenkins and kids Kai and Jodie in 2004)</p>

<p>The TV star, who shares Kai with ex Robert Fernandez and Jody, 19, with her former spouse Kevin Jenkins, added: 'I'm not going to beat around the bush. You might have looked like you had everything in the world, but your life was s*** because I wasn't present.'</p>

<p>Danniella said her kids haven given her 'tough love' over the years after becoming 'exasperated' with her antics, and apologised for bringing 'shame' to their upbringing.</p>

<p>She explained: 'You have given me tough love … there have been times when you've not spoken to me for months because you're that exasperated.</p>

<p>'I know I've caused you guys a lot of hassle you didn't need – a lot of shame, a lot of bullying. I don't know if I would have the love and the patience if it was one of my family members.'</p>

<p>The soap star has since ditched drugs and alcohol, celebrating 19 months of sobriety.</p>

<p>Danniella shared: 'I just shut that other door like it never happened. I just expect everybody to catch up to where I am.</p>

<p>'I can't expect that just because I've got clean that all of a sudden everyone's going to forget the pain I've caused. I've got to realise that it might take other people a bit longer to come around because I have hurt people.'</p>

<p>Now, the thespian insisted she's dedicated to making sure she's a good mum, and always consults her daughter and son on her big life decisions.</p>
