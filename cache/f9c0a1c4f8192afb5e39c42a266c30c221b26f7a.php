<p>European competition authorities have launched an investigation into the right granted by Belgium to Ladbrokes to operate virtual betting in the country.</p>

<p>The European Commission, which oversees competition policy in the 27-member European Union, said it opened the probe after rival gaming operators complained in March 2019 that Ladbrokesâ€™ exclusive right amounted to unfair state aid.</p>

<p>Ladbrokes is operated in Belgium by Derby, a subsidiary of its owner GVC Holding, and is the market leader with some 300 betting agencies in the country.</p>

<p>The Commission said Belgium authorised Ladbrokes to operate virtual betting in its outlets in February 2014 and online in March 2015, but then denied requests from other operators.</p>
