<p>Arabella also sported a selection of chunky bracelets, necklaces and rings, and later wrapped up in a white crochet kaftan.</p>

<p>Her companion, meanwhile, sported a white open shirt and pair of blue and grey patterned shorts, and covered up with a camouflage print cap and a pair of shades. </p>

<p>MailOnline has previously contacted Arabella Chi's representatives for further comment.  </p>

<p>Stunning! The Love Island star showcased her model physique in a soft pink, velvet-look bikini, and flashed a smile as she was seen relaxing on a sunlounger with her male companion</p>

<p>Dapper: Her mystery man, meanwhile, sported a white open shirt and pair of blue and grey patterned shorts, and covered up with a camouflage print cap and a pair of shades</p>

<p>Her new romance may come as a surprise to fans, as things appeared to be hotting up with Josh just a few weeks ago.  </p>

<p>The blonde moved in with fellow Love Island alum Harley Brash, 21, in June following her split from Wes, 22.  </p>

<p>The pair had been dating for nine months but were said to have 'grown apart' and had become more aware of their six-year age gap ahead of their break-up. </p>

<p>Design engineer Wes moved out of their home so they didn't have to isolate together under lockdown rules. </p>

<p>Fashionista: Arabella also sported a selection of chunky bracelets, necklaces and rings, and later wrapped up in a white crochet kaftan</p>

<p>The Dancing On Ice hunk is now living with pal and former Love Island star, Josh Denzel. </p>

<p>A source told The Sun at the time: 'It's all over. They started to grow apart. They want to remain civil with each other and hope to remain friends.'  </p>

<p>The news likely came as a shock to their fans, as just a week before they called it quits, the pair revealed that they were enjoying their time in lockdown together.</p>

<p>Speaking to OK! Online, Wes said: 'It's been alright. It's hard to get out at the moment, isn't it? We're just trying to do our piece of exercise a day.  </p>

<p>Smitten: The blonde has been on cloud nine ever since embarking on a new relationship with musician Josh Newsham in July (pictured)</p>

<p>'We spend a lot of time with each other anyway so it's been okay to self-isolate because it's pretty much what we have been doing anyway, it's the same as before but we're just not getting out and about.</p>

<p>The exes had moved into their first flat together back in December, gushing that they were ready to start 'the next chapter' of their life.</p>

<p>In 2018, the Staffordshire native reached the final of Love Island with former exotic dancer Megan Barton-Hanson, before ending their relationship in January 2019.</p>

<p>Arabella then appeared on the 2019 series of the ITV2 show and struck up a brief romance with Danny Williams, but was dumped from the island after just seven days. </p>
