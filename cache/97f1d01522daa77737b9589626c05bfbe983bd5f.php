<p>'Don't rile me up!' Today show host Karl Stefanovic hilariously forced his co-host, Allison Langdon, to watch a video of a 'Real Women Vote for Trump' singalong on Tuesday</p>

<p>A scheming Karl began by saying: 'Just quickly, I know, Ally, you are a big supporter of Donald Trump, and you are not alone.</p>

<p>'I found this video of women around the world who are singing this song.'</p>

<p>The screen then cut to a clip of three women who began singing: 'We don't care if you're white, we don't care if you're black, we don't care if you're gay, we're all under attack.</p>

<p>'We don't care if you're rich, we don't care if you're poor. We just know what we're fighting for.'</p>

<p>Not happy: Allison, 41, was left enraged as she dramatically threw pieces of paper on the desk as three Stateside women in 'Make America Great Again' hats passionately sang about re-electing Donald Trump as their President</p>

<p>Political: The segment came during Channel Nine's coverage over the impending Presidential Debate which will see U. S President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden face off just weeks before the election</p>

<p>'Sing it!' the blonde in the middle continued before she and her friends jointly sang: 'Real women vote for Trump!</p>

<p>'We don't need no liberal chump. Real women vote for Trump,' they continued to chant.</p>

<p>Allison saw the funny side of the video presented to her as she playfully picked up her papers and swung them back down.</p>

<p>'You know, don't get me riled up!' she joked to Karl.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Karl, who was clearly expecting the blonde's dramatic reaction, couldn't resist collapsing into a fit of giggles.</p>
