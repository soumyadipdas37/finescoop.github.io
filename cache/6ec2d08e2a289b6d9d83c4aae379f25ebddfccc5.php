<p>Back in May, it was reported that the star paid for his entire property portfolio was paid for in cash, leaving him completely mortgage-free.</p>

<p>The chart-topping pop superstar has splashed £10million on the London property market over the years, growing his empire to 27 flats, houses, and mansions.</p>

<p>And the star is said to have used his financial standing to his advantage as he snapped up the properties, by building his empire without relying on any bank loans</p>

<p>Hot property: Ed splashed £10million on the London property market over the years, growing his empire to 27 flats, houses, and mansions, as well as his own 16-acre estate in Suffolk</p>

<p>Suffolk pile: He's also said to be making himself self-sufficient on his sprawling 16-acre Suffolk pile, by setting up a beehive on the edge of his estate</p>

<p>Country living: After amassing an estimated £160million fortune, the superstar set about creating his own extraordinary estate – dubbed Sheeranville</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'He has a great portfolio of properties and he owns the lot free and clear. There was no need to borrow the cash from a lender because he already had it.</p>

<p>'Some people have the cash tied up so need to raise a mortgage but Ed has piles of the cash in the bank so there was no point in letting a bank earn money by lending him the money. He just bought them outright.'</p>

<p>He's also said to be making himself self-sufficient on his sprawling 16-acre Suffolk pile, by setting up a beehive on the edge of his estate, where he can make his own honey – in addition to growing vegetables, owning an orchard and raising livestock.</p>

<p>'Ed’s placed a wooden beehive at the edge of his estate,' another source close to the singer told The Sun. 'He’s already got other produce growing and some animals so he’s clearly enjoying the idea of that lifestyle.' </p>

<p>MailOnline previously reported that Sheeran bought several Notting Hill properties to prevent complaints about 'loud music and parties'. </p>

<p>Outside of London, the musician owns a vast £3.7million Suffolk country estate dubbed 'Sheeranville' by local villagers.</p>

<p>He has had a pub, a swimming pool, and a treehouse built, and last November submitted proposals to have a 'place of worship' constructed.</p>

<p>The multimillionaire chart-topper is in lockdown with wife Cherry Seaborn, 28, at the mansion where he also grows fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>It comes after Ed refused to furlough any of his ten staff at his Notting Hill pub - in sharp contrast to other celebrities who have been blasted for demanding state cash.</p>

<p>The star will be using his personal fortune to prop up his bar Bertie Blossoms in west London, said to be named after his wife Cherry.</p>

<p>The bar was forced to close in March because of the coronavirus shutdown, but it appears workers in its bar and kitchen are being paid by the singer to be at home.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Sheeran has confirmed that he will not ask the Treasury to pay up to 80 per cent of their salaries, up to a threshold of £2,500 per month.</p>

<p>The A Team hitmaker opened the doors to Bertie Blossoms in September 2019 with a snazzy launch which saw the likes of Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy in attendance.</p>

<p>Co-owned with his manager Stuart Camp, the pub has been billed as a 'bright green, low-lit bar set over two floors with extensive drinks list including house cocktails'. </p>

<p>Sheeran announced he would take a break from his music career after finishing his Divide Tour, which ran from 2017, last year. It is the highest-grossing tour of all time. </p>
