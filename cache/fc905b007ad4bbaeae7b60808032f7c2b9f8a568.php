<p>TV presenter Phil Schofield has splashed out on a £2 million bachelor pad in west London as he works out his 'amicable' £9 million divorce with his wife, MailOnline can reveal. Schofield, 58, was seen leaving the large semi-detached property with co-presenter Holly Willoughby</p>

<p>The house, just a stone's throw from The Thames, is close to his ITV colleague Declan Donnelly’s home and Ant McPartlin's former home he shared with Lisa Armstrong</p>

<p>Schofield and Willoughby were spotted emerging from the house on their bicycles to set off for a leisurely ride in bright afternoon sunshine</p>

<p>Schofield settled into his new house after it emerged that he is also building himself an annex at the family home in Oxfordshire. </p>

<p>Donning a cycling helmet today, the presenter was dressed in a tee-shirt and cycling shorts with his co-host in a grey tee shirt and black leggings. </p>

<p>Neighbours told MailOnline that they had regularly seen the presenter around the area since moving in around two weeks ago. </p>

<p>He has also been frequenting pubs along the River Thames, which just lies a short distance from his new home.</p>

<p>Locals said that Schofield is seen more on foot or bike than in his luxury Jaguar sports car which has a private number plate and is parked on the forecourt of his new home.</p>

<p>One neighbour said: ‘It’s caused quite a stir since he’s moved in and got people very excited. He seems like a very nice man and quite normal. You see him walking or cycling mainly and he smiles every time he goes past.’</p>

<p>Another neighbour added: ‘There’s quite a few famous people already living around here so Phillip Schofield moving in is not a big deal. A lot of people have been talking about it, but nobody bothers him. He’s a lovely bloke and I’m sure he’ll enjoy living in our community.</p>

<p>The news of the move follows a tumultuous few months for one of Britain’s most popular TV faces, following his tearful on-air ‘coming out’ on live television in February.</p>

<p>He is said to be keen to keep his divorce from wife of 27 years Steph as amicable as possible and maintain a good relationship with his daughters.</p>

<p>The new house on a wide residential road boasts a magnificent open-plan kitchen, three receptions, six bedrooms and a converted basement.</p>

<p>MailOnline understands he bought from a family who were moving to New Zealand and put the property on the market about a year ago for £2 million.</p>

<p>His TV pals will be close at hand, with Willoughby living just across the river in Barnes and Dec down the road.</p>

<p>This week, Schofield’s net worth was revealed to have topped £9m, increasing by £800,000 in the last year alone, thanks in part to a £60,000 deal making him the face of a gin advent calendar and his new tell-all autobiography, Life’s What You Make It comes out next month.</p>

<p>As co-director of his company, Steph is likely to be entitled to half of everything, but the couple are determined to remain friends.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: ‘Phillip and Steph have had a lot of hard, painful conversations over the past ten months but remain as tight and devoted to one another as ever. </p>

<p>‘Steph is entitled to half. He is not disputing this — all he wants in return is her ongoing loyalty . . . and discretion, his family is his number one priority and that will never change.’</p>

<p>Phillip also co-owns a plush country pile located in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, which has been the family home for many years with Steph and his two grown-up daughters, Ruby and Mollie.</p>

<p>News of the move follows a tumultuous few months for one of Britain’s most popular TV faces, following his tearful on-air ‘coming out’ on live television in February. He is said to be keen to keep his divorce from wife of 27 years Steph (above) as amicable as possible</p>

<p>The new house on a wide residential road boasts a magnificent open-plan kitchen, three receptions, six bedrooms and a converted basement</p>

<p>MailOnline understands he bought from a family who were moving to New Zealand and put the property on the market about a year ago for £2 million. His TV pals will be close at hand, with Willoughby living just across the river in Barnes and Dec down the road</p>

<p>The house - worth at least £2.5 million - is surrounded by lush greenery and one recent report suggested he was planning to build a bachelor bolt-hole by converting a two-bedroom house on the grounds and knocking down one of the garages.</p>

<p>But the move to London suggests he’s making more of a clean break from the former family home, which looks likely to remain Steph’s home following the divorce..</p>

<p>The TV star also owns an incredible holiday home in Portugal.</p>

<p>It is located in the Algarve and offers stunning views across the Portuguese hills.</p>

<p>Naturally, the villa has a private swimming pool and perfectly manicured lawns, as well as a number of al-fresco eating spots.</p>

<p>In September it was revealed that Phil more than doubled his salary in a year, from £803,000 to £1.73million.</p>

<p>The £927,000 rise for the ITV host was revealed in newly published accounts and was largely due to Dancing On Ice’s return in January last year.</p>

<p>Phillip also co-owns a plush country pile located in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, which has been the family home for many years with Steph and his two grown-up daughters, Ruby and Mollie</p>

<p>In February, Phillip — who made his name with Gordon the Gopher on BBC’s Broom Cupboard — stunned viewers in an emotional interview with Willoughby in which he revealed he was gay.</p>

<p>He said he had wrestled with the decision, adding: ‘You never know what’s going on in someone’s seemingly perfect life.</p>

<p>‘So you won’t know what has been consuming me for the last few years.’</p>
