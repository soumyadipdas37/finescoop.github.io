<p>A video posted to Twitter shows a staffer reluctantly collecting dozens of the cooking implements from the Red Hill base in Brisbane's west on Friday morning.</p>

<p>The Broncos claimed victory in just one of 18 games played after lockdowns, with Thursday night's loss to the North Queensland Cowboys their 11th in a row. </p>

<p>The 'wooden spoon' is said to be handed to the team which finishes last during the regular season.</p>

<p>BREAKING: BRONCOS DRAMA!!! Pissed off fans have thrown dozens of WOODEN SPOONS onto the club's training ground overnight!Staff forced to pick them up in another embarrassing moment for Brisbane.Full story tonight <?php echo e('@'); ?>7NewsBrisbane <?php echo e('@'); ?>7Sport <?php echo e('@'); ?>BenDavis74 pic.twitter.com/gDFYuu8tnc</p>

<p>Retiring Broncos star Darius Boyd (pictured with wife Kayla) could not lift the Broncos to a win in Thursday game against North Queensland despite an early try</p>

<p>While the Broncos jumped to an early lead in the match after retiring star Darius Boyd scored an early try, their sub-par defence let the Cowboys claw their way back. </p>

<p>The 32-16 loss, on the back of a hat-trick by North Queensland's Kyle Feldt, put the Broncos on the bottom of the ladder at the close of a season for the first time in the club's 33 year history. </p>

<p>Fans of the club were less than impressed with another video emerging that appears to show a group of young males lobbing the wooden spoons onto the field under cover of darkness. </p>

<p>'Never thought I'd see the day ... Broncos getting the spoon' Quade Cooper tweeted.</p>

<p>Boyd was making his 337th and final NRL appearance, and while he did his best to lift to Brisbane side they finished with three tries to North Queensland's six.  </p>

<p>The season was a strange one for the retiring star to end his career on, with the coronavirus pandemic disrupting fixtures and crowds. </p>

<p>The Broncos' poor performance also resulted in Boyd being stripped of his captaincy during the season and coach Anthony Seibold having his contract cut short at two years into a five year deal. </p>

<p>But there was one final highlight Boyd had up his sleeve, with the famously private 33-year-old staging an unexpected gender reveal after the match by kicking a footy into the stands at Suncorp Stadium. </p>

<p>He and wife Kayla are having a girl, their third daughter, a puff of pink smoke revealed as his teammates let up a cheer and hugged the former Clive Churchill Medal winner. </p>

<p>Brisbane's standout player for the 2020 season, 21-year-old Kotoni Staggs, had to leave the field in the Cowboys match suffering a suspected ACL tear. </p>

<p>The injury could sideline the rising star until mid-2021. </p>

<p>The Cowboy's win sees them at third-last in the NRL table ahead of the Bulldogs and Broncos, while the Penrith Panthers have won the minor premiership ahead of the Melbourne Storm and Roosters. </p>

<p>The 32-16 loss, on the back of a hat-trick by North Queensland's Kyle Feldt, put the Broncos on the bottom of the ladder at the close of a season for the first time in the club's 33 year history </p>
