<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mikel Arteta admitted on Friday night that he was worried about Arsenal’s chances of keeping Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and the striker had doubts about staying.</p>

<p>But the Gunners boss revealed some pivotal conversations with Aubameyang and his representatives during lockdown proved decisive in securing his future at the club.</p>

<p>Captain Aubameyang gave Arsenal a huge boost by signing a new three-year deal this week that, with bonuses, could be worth in excess of £350,000 per week.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta claims Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang signed on due to Arsenal's 'incredible' team</p>

<p>Aubameyang ended speculation about his Arsenal future by signing a new three-year deal</p>

<p>Arteta, who was appointed manager in December, said: ‘When I joined I wasn’t as positive as I was the last few weeks.</p>

<p>‘Financially we were in a position where it was difficult to get to where we wanted to get.</p>

<p>‘I think Auba had his doubts but things evolved in a natural way. I had a feeling the club wanted to move forward and a feeling Auba wanted to stay and we just had to glide those things together.</p>

<p>‘It was a conversation I had with Auba first, privately, and with his father and his agent.</p>

<p>Reports in Spain suggested Ronald Koeman's Barcelona had made a late bid to sign him</p>

<p>But Arteta claimed Aubameyang turned them down because Arsenal are 'as big' a name</p>

<p>‘It is incredible how necessary these conversations are to understand each other’s position and what happened in the past — things that have annoyed people and things that have made people feel important and part of the process.</p>

<p>‘I think after those two conversations, I felt we had a good chance because I felt a really good connection and a strong feeling they wanted to continue with us.’</p>

<p>Arteta’s impressive introduction to management has not been lost on the man in the opposing dugout tonight — West Ham’s David Moyes.</p>

<p>‘He’s had such a good start,’ Moyes said.</p>

<p>‘But he’ll find as he goes on it becomes more difficult. The expectations rise — when you’re at big clubs, you’re expected to win every week.’</p>
