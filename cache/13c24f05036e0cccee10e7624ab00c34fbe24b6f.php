<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother-of-four has created her own 'f**k off' room that nobody else in her household is allowed to enter, complete with a computer, craft supplies and a flamingo lamp.</p>

<p>Lisa Heenan, 36, runs a very busy household with four children, three dogs and a cat so occasionally when she wants to let off some steam, she enters her 'f**k off' space. </p>

<p>'So I turned my walk-in wardrobe into my very own f*** off room. I have four kids aged 15, 13, 12 and eight, three labradors and a Himalayan Persian and they are all banned from this room,' the graphic designer from Queensland wrote on Facebook. </p>

<p>'Two of my children are on the spectrum. They are both high functioning, though some days are tough with one of my sons having ADHD,' she told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>'I love them all dearly but just like all mums and parents sometimes we just need a break. </p>

<p>'About a year ago I moved all of my clothes into the identical wardrobe I have on the other side of my en-suite and created this space for my sanity.'</p>

<p>She emblazoned the swear word inside the room because it 'tells her kids exactly what she doesn't want to say out loud'.  </p>

<p>'My sense of humour won't be to everyone's taste but wouldn't this world be boring if we were all the same?' she said. </p>

<p>Almost all of the furniture was purchased from IKEA and the pink flamingo lamp is from Kmart</p>

<p>'I'm a freelance graphic designer so I have my computer in there and all of my craft and party supplies,' she said.  </p>

<p>She uses the space 'all the time' after she has spent time with her beautiful kids and plans on purchasing a pink bar fridge to store wine and chocolate in it.</p>

<p>For those that might want to take inspiration from her, Lisa said not to think twice about it.   </p>

<p>'Just do it. As parents we all deserve a space where we can relax and be ourselves outside of being mum and dad,' she said.</p>
