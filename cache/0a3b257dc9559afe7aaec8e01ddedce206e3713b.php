<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother has revealed how she transformed her 'grotty old' kitchen into a luxurious modern space in two months, and the entire DIY project set her back just $2,000.</p>

<p>Australian woman Jennifer Jones said she and her partner spent 'two months with breaks' putting together their new kitchen using items from Bunnings Warehouse.</p>

<p>And while it was a lot of effort, the rewards have more than outweighed the blood, sweat and tears.</p>

<p>'We finally completed our kitchen renovation, and the best part is that we have managed to do that for just under $2k and all ourselves,' Jennifer posted on Facebook. </p>

<p>'A real cheapy, but we put in a lot of love.'</p>

<p>BEFORE: A mother has revealed how she transformed her 'grotty old' kitchen into a luxurious modern space in two months, and the entire DIY project set her back just $2,000</p>

<p>AFTER: Australian woman Jennifer Jones said she and her partner spent 'two months with breaks' putting together their new kitchen using items from Bunnings Warehouse</p>

<p>The average cost of a kitchen renovation in Australia in 2020 is $17,000, meaning the Jones family saved at least $15,000 by doing it all themselves.</p>

<p>Jennifer wrote: 'I won't lie, we are not DIY beginners, but putting in the bench top from joiners to cutting out the sink and stove wasn't a picnic and we were definitely over it by the end of it'.</p>

<p>'But it was all worth it,' she added.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, the mum said she first of all tackled her cabinetry, which can often make a kitchen look instantly better or worse.</p>

<p>'I used Taubmans 3-in-1 primer and painted one coat of it,' Jennifer wrote.</p>

<p>'Then, we covered this with two coats of Dulux's Aquanamel Gloss and added silver knobs to the cabinetry.'</p>

<p>Jennifer and her partner followed this by tackling the tiles on their splashbacks.</p>

<p>'We used White Knights paint from Bunnings on the tiles,' she said.</p>

<p>'One coat of the primer and two coats of the white completely transformed it.'</p>

<p>The walls were also all about painting, with the mum using the Taubmans 3-in-1 primer and 8-in-1 paint in the shade 'Still Here'.</p>

<p>When it came to the bulk of the spending, the Jones family said they spent it on their benchtops.</p>

<p>Jennifer bought new benchtops from Bunnings, the Victorian Ash range, for $435 and $641.</p>

<p>'We painted the benchtop with Cabots Stain Tint Base in Sutherland Teak stain and did two coats,' Jennifer said.</p>

<p>'We then did three coats of the Satin benchtop paint by Cabots.'</p>

<p>The final thing she said she did was replace the sink with a new one - the Blanco - from Bunnings. </p>

<p>This costs $182 in total.</p>
