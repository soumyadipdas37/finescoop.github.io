<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Newcastle have tempted Bournemouth into selling striker Callum Wilson by offering their former midfielder Matt Ritchie in a player plus cash deal. </p>

<p>Sportsmail understands Aston Villa will rival the Magpies in their bid to sign the 28-year-old England international, who was unable to prevent the Cherries from being relegated last season.</p>

<p>Wilson, who scored seven Premier League goals in 2019-20, is high on Steve Bruce's wish list after watching his side struggle to hit the back of the net in the last campaign. Joelinton joined for a club-record £40million but scored just two of the team's 38 goal tally.</p>

<p>Newcastle have stepped up their efforts to sign Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson</p>

<p>The Magpies have offered ex-Cherries midfielder Matt Richie as a sweetener to land Wilson</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dwight Gayle suffered a knee injury during pre-season with Andy Carroll struggling to reach full fitness after returning to training.  </p>

<p>Ritchie's possible departure may leave Newcastle fans disappointed, with the 30-year-old becoming a fan favourite during his time at St James' Park. </p>

<p>He joined the club for £12million from the Cherries in 2016 and has gone on to make 148 appearances, scoring 24 goals, but Newcastle are lacking funds this summer, with Bruce only being given a budget of around £30m after a Saudi-backed takeover bid collapsed.</p>

<p>Newcastle are keen to bolster their forward options after struggling to score goals last season</p>

<p>The club will therefore have to generate funds from player sales to provide new recruits for Bruce. He has already snapped up Jeff Hendrick on a free transfer and received a boost after Matty Longstaff signed a new deal. </p>

<p>Wilson joined the Cherries from home-town club Coventry during the summer of 2014 and scored 20 times in 45 league games to help them win promotion to the Premier League in his first season.</p>

<p>He announced himself on the big stage with five goals in his first six games and, after overcoming two serious knee injuries, scored on his full England debut in a 3-0 friendly victory over the United States in November 2018.</p>
