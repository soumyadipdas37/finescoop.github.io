<p>For the past three decades the treehouse on Irymple Ave in Melbourne's St Kilda has provided a 'sense of community' for children on the street.</p>

<p>That was until last week when a group of council workers showed up with hammers in hand after a neighbour complained the structure was unsafe. </p>

<p>Mark Wiesmayr, who lives in the street, said parents and their children were left bawling as they watched as their treehouse was destroyed.</p>

<p>For the past three decades the treehouse on Irymple Ave in Melbourne's St Kilda has provided a 'sense of community' for children on the street</p>

<p>He said the treehouse was torn down with 'reckless, arrogant abandon'.</p>

<p>'We are baffled by the cavalier attitude,' Mr Wiesmayr told 3AW.</p>

<p>'It was so arrogantly unprofessional, the way they did it.'</p>

<p>Port Phillip councillor and former mayor Dick Gross was left fuming after the treehouse was destroyed as his son Zac Gross had built it in 1990. </p>

<p>'I was shocked when I heard this noise and looked out my window to see it was already two thirds demolished,' he told the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>He said the children had always ensured they were being safe by wearing helmets when they went up there. </p>

<p>The 'Happy Treehouse' was built 30 years ago on a council-owned tree. </p>

<p>Last week a group of council workers (pictured) showed up with hammers in hand after someone complained that the structure was unsafe</p>

<p>Port Phillip Council chief executive Peter Smith said the treehouse and ladder were deemed unsafe by council officers </p>

<p>He said the nails had also damaged the council's 70-year-old London plane tree (pictured)</p>

<p>The council has received 25 complaints about swings in the area in the past two months, which has sparked a debate about the use of play equipment on council trees.</p>

<p>The council currently investigating whether it will change its laws to allow residents to install structures, such as treehouses, onto council assets. </p>

<p>Under local laws it is illegal to attach structures to council assets. </p>
