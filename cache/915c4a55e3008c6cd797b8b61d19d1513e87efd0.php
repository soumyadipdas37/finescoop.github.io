<p>And on Tuesday, Kylie Jenner showed off a plethora of products from her own line as she did a What's In My Bag YouTube video.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old star was standing in her accessories section of her enormous closet as she showed off 20 products from her brands Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin.</p>

<p>In addition, she also shared an item from her collaboration with sister Kim Kardashian - the Kylie Jenner X KKW Fragrance in Nude Lips.</p>

<p>She also had a SKIMS mask from Kim's line. </p>

<p>Wow: Kylie Jenner showed off a plethora of products from her own line as she did a What's In My Bag YouTube video on Tuesday afternoon</p>

<p>The star explained that she is currently carrying one of her very first Birkin bags she purchased, after her mom Kris Jenner told her to buy it.</p>

<p>'Surprisingly Kris Jenner told me to buy the bag,' adding: 'Because its the So Black edition and they are really rare. She was like there's this bag available. You need it. These bags are great investments.'</p>

<p>'So Kris Jenner told me to buy this bag. And when Kris Jenner tells you to do something, you do it.'</p>

<p>Last year, a limited edition Hermes matte So Black niloticus crocidile Birkin sold for a record of $208,000 at an auction, according to Barrons.com; the So Black collection was designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, and was first released in 2010. </p>

<p>For the video, Kylie sported a black skintight turtleneck with fitted leather trousers, opting for a deep side part; she sported a large diamond watch as well as rings and studded earrings. </p>

<p>Lucky: The 23-year-old star was standing in her accessories section of her enormous closet as she showed off 20 products from her own lines</p>

<p>The first thing she pulled out was her Kylie Skin hand sanitizer, which is not available to purchase just yet.</p>

<p>She then pulled out her PR card for her Kylie Skin Hyaluronic Acid Serum, which she said she had to approve.</p>

<p>Kylie added the product launches on the 18th of this month before reading some of the ingredients off the card.</p>

<p>She pulled out her Kylie Jenner X KKW Fragrance Nude Lips perfume next, calling it her 'favorite perfume of all time' which she loves reapplying all day.</p>

<p>Kylie added that it's the Nude scent from her collaboration with older sister Kim, which she revealed just won Fragrance of the Year.</p>

<p>Her next item was a pink and black old school camera, which sister Kendall Jenner gave to her for her birthday.</p>

<p>Next was her matching Hermes wallet 'because we are adults and we do adult things.'</p>

<p>Her upcoming, not-yet-released Kylie Skin silk scrunchies were up next out of her bag; she had two of those in there.</p>

<p>Kylie pulled out her Kylie Cosmetics X Kendall Blotting Powder and then a charger her assistant customized for Kylie for her 23rd birthday trip and a pack of Extra gum.</p>

<p>Next was her Kylie Skin sunscreen and Kylie Skin wipes and then her face masks - the first was one that read KYLIE in pink letters , which is available to purchase on KylieSkin.com. The next one was from Kim's SKIMS brand.</p>

<p>Sisterly support here: She had one Kylie Skin face mask and the second one was from Kim's SKIMS brand</p>

<p>She had an apple sauce in her bag for her daughter Stormi, two: 'You never know if your baby is going to get hungry. Or bribe her to do something - she'll have a little candy or something, you never know.'</p>

<p>Kylie showed off her Alexander Wang sunglasses and her 'little friend' - a green pea pod stuffed toy which she says 'makes me happy. I don't know why.'</p>

<p>She also has a troll toy she calls Cooper but says she doesn't have it in her purse because its at her other house in my closet 'just watching over there.'</p>

<p>Next was her Kylie Uno game,which she got for her birthday last month.</p>

<p>'You would be surprised how much we actually do play Uno. Like every dinner we go to, anytime I'm with my friends we'll be out and after we're done eating, we'll clear the table and play Uno for like an hour or so.'</p>

<p>Interesting: Kylie showed off her Alexander Wang sunglasses and her 'little friend' - a green pea pod stuffed toy which she says 'makes me happy. I don't know why'</p>

<p>Kylie said if she had to pick one thing from her house, it would be her lipstick before showing two Kylie Skin lip balms - which she said we'll be soon available for purchase again.</p>

<p>She said she's doing 'exclusive Ulta plumping lip glosses' as she showed the Kylie Comstics X Ulta Not Your Babe Plumping Lip gloss, available October.</p>
