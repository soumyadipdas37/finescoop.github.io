<p>'my first ep ‘Good Cry’ came out 2 years ago today. time flies,' she began.</p>

<p>'i’ve been through so much since then. putting this ep out and going on tour during one of the most depressive times in my life was so hard. every day felt like lifting 100lb weights just to get out of bed. the ache in my chest from the pain felt unbearable,' she continued.</p>

<p>The overwhelming depression made her fear that she wouldn't have much of a future.</p>

<p>She added that growing up in public provided special challenges to her, and she described having 'many ups and downs' throughout the past two years. </p>

<p>'this ep means so much to me and always will.. i always have written nothing but the truth and this ep was exactly that. i still stand with needing a good f**kin cry every once in awhile.</p>

<p>'i know that pain is something we HAVE to feel and experience. i owe this album so much. it tought me so much about myself... and looking back at myself then to sho i am now i just want to run back in time and give that Noah a huge a** hug.. as she was breaking ever so slowly,' she wrote.</p>
