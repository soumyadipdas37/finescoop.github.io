<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eight logistics firms have warned that Britain could face 'severe' disruption to supply chains next year unless Brexit border preparations are stepped up. </p>

<p>Leading companies and lobby groups told how there were 'significant gaps' in the preparations for managing the borders from January if there is no trade deal.</p>

<p>The claims were made by organisations including the Road Haulage Association in an open letter to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and Chancellor Rishi Sunak. </p>

<p>They requested a meeting about technological and infrastructure concerns, according to a copy of the letter seen by the Financial Times. </p>

<p>The letter said: 'Our concern is so strong that we have collectively agreed to request an urgent roundtable meeting with yourself, the chancellor of the exchequer and secretary of state for transport [Grant Shapps].'</p>

<p>'We are asking you to take seriously our concerns and listen to the detail during this roundtable so that we can collectively help government manage through this enormous challenge.'</p>

<p>RHA boss Richard Burnett said: 'It is patently clear that, on the political front at least, there is a complete lack of appreciation of the enormity of, in effect, constructing a new supply chain after 50 years of completely free trade with the EU.' </p>

<p>It comes as a new report claimed secrecy about the Government's Brexit negotiating objectives hindered preparations for the UK's exit from the European Union.</p>

<p>The efforts also took a heavy toll on the Civil Service with a high turnover among senior staff, according to the study by the National Audit Office (NAO).</p>

<p>It found there were more than 22,000 workers deployed across Whitehall departments on the preparations for Brexit which cost £4.4billion.</p>

<p>The study aimed to examine the lessons to be learned from the Government's attempts to ready the country for Brexit following the 2016 Leave referendum result. </p>

<p>Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Christine Jardine said the NAO report was evidence the Tories had made a 'dog's dinner' of Britain's divorce from Europe.</p>

<p>'How Boris Johnson ever thought he could get a deal by the end of July with the chaos behind the scenes in Whitehall is beyond me,' said the MP.</p>

<p>'Even he must realise the dog's dinner he has made of Brexit.'</p>

<p>Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said ministers must ensure such mistakes are not repeated. </p>
