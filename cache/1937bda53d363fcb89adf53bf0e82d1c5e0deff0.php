<p>'I didn't get diagnosed fully with lymphedema until I was a teenager, and by that time, it was just so out of control that the wrapping and stuff wasn't working,' Tiffany explains. 'They were telling me they're going to have to amputate the leg.'</p>

<p>Struggles: Tiffany opens up about her lymphedema during a virtual consultation with Dr. Ebonie Vincent on Thursday's episode of My Feet Are Killing Me: First Steps</p>

<p>Hard to handle: Tiffany admits that her leg drains so badly that she has painful wounds, and her foot is so large that she can't wear shoes or even seen her toes</p>

<p>Lymphedema is a chronic condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues and usually develops in the arms or legs. </p>

<p>Other symptoms may include repeated skin infection, wart-like growths, and fluid leaking from the skin.  </p>

<p>Tiffany tells Dr. Ebonie that when doctors were recommending amputation, she was busy with a newborn child.  </p>

<p>'There's just no way that I can live with my leg amputated. It just kept getting worse, and so now, it just drains constantly,' she adds. </p>

<p>'I've been draining for years now. It just drains so bad that I have wounds.'</p>

<p>Vitual consult: Tiffany's friend helps move the camera so Dr. Ebonie can see her leg and foot. The patient explains that doctors wanted to amputate her leg, but she had refused </p>

<p>Ouch: Lymphedema is a chronic condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues. Other symptoms may include repeated skin infection and fluid leaking from the skin</p>

<p>Stunned: 'Wow, yeah, that's a big wound there,' Dr. Ebonie says as she looks at Tiffany's foot on her computer screen </p>

<p>The show was filmed during the coronavirus pandemic, and all of the patients' consultations with Dr. Ebonie, Dr. Brad Shaeffer, and newcomer Dr. Sarah Haller have been done virtually. </p>

<p>In the clip, Dr, Ebonie asks Tiffany if she has someone who can help move the camera, so she could look at her painfully swollen leg and foot. </p>

<p>But she isn't prepared for what she is about to see. </p>

<p>Tiffany's foot is so enormous that it has a fat roll at the top, and she also has painful scabs and wounds on her ankle and heel from the fluid that is constantly draining from her leg. </p>

<p>'Wow, yeah, that's a big wound there,' Dr. Ebonie says.     </p>

<p>Lymphoedema is a long-term condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues</p>

<p>It usually develops in the arms or legs.</p>

<p>Lymphoedema affects up to 10 million people in the US and more than 200,000 in the UK. </p>

<p>It occurs when the lymphatic system does not work properly.</p>

<p>The lymphatic system is a network of channels and glands that remove excess fluid and help fight infections.</p>

<p>As well as swelling, which is often worse during the day, other symptoms may include: </p>

<p>Lymphoedema can be inherited or occur as a result of infections, injuries or cancer treatment.</p>

<p>Around one in five women with breast cancer and half with vulval cancer develop lymphoedema. </p>

<p>There is no cure. </p>

<p>Treatment focuses on minimising fluid build up via compression stockings and a healthy lifestyle.</p>
