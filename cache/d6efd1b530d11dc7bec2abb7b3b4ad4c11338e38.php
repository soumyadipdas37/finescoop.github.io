<p> Postponed: UK superstar Harry Styles has cancelled the Australian leg of his Love on Tour, just days after fans were told it may go ahead </p>

<p>'I really hope to play the shows as planned for 2021, but will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks and months.  </p>

<p>'I can't wait to see you all on the road as soon as it's safe to do so,' he added.</p>

<p>The announcement comes three months after Harry postponed the North America leg of the tour.</p>

<p>'Everyone's health and safety remains our top priority, which is why I unfortunately have to postpone all 2020 shows in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand until further notice' Harry Tweeted overnight </p>

<p>The Australian dates temporarily cancelled include shows in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Auckland and Melbourne - which is currently under stage four restrictions. </p>

<p>Unlikely: Last week, fans blasted Ticketek for giving them false hope just days before the official announcement</p>

<p>'The Harry Styles Australia &amp; New Zealand tour is proceeding as planned and we are excited to welcome everyone to the events in November and December,' a representative for Ticketek wrote on Saturday. </p>

<p>However, fans were quick to bite back on Twitter.</p>

<p>'Can't wait to go and watch a cardboard cutout of Harry on stage for 90 minutes,' one fan sarcastically wrote. </p>

<p>'What world do y'all live in where there isn't a global pandemic and no international flights until at least 2021,' a second added.  </p>

<p>Harry was booked to play shows in Auckland, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth across November and December </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a third chimed: 'As much as I want this to be true, I just don't see it happening and it breaks my heart.'</p>

<p>Others appeared to be angry that the ticket distributor suggested that there was a possibility the tour could be cancelled instead of rescheduled. </p>

<p>'WTF 'cancellation' why not postpone? I can't go through the stress of getting tickets again,' one person wrote.   </p>

<p>Busy boy: Harry is no stranger to Australian shores, having had played more than 30 stadium shows with his former band One Direction</p>
