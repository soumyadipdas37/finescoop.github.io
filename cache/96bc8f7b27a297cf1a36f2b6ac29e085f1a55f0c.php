<p>Facilities serving alcohol inside the Palace of Westminster are not required to abide by the coronavirus curfew which came into effect this week due to them being classified as a 'workplace canteen'.</p>

<p>It comes just a week after the Prime Minister set out a raft of measures designed to clampdown on Covid-19, including imposing a 10pm curfew on all pubs, bars and restaurants in England.</p>

<p>Despite the new measures, staff and visitors inside Parliament can still enter its handful of bars without being forced to leave at 10pm and are also not required to provide a name and contact number upon entry, The Times reported.</p>

<p>MPs entering the Palace of Westminster are also not required to register their presence upon entry.  </p>

<p>The revelations come after a number of bars in Parliament, including the Strangers' Dining Room, the Adjournment and the Members' Smoking Room and Pugin Room, were reopened to MPs.  </p>

<p>This week Boris Johnson announced a new wave of Covid-19 restrictions that could last up to six months- including a 10pm curfew on bars, pubs and restaurants in England.</p>

<p>The 10pm curfew on the hospitality sector sparked an immediate industry backlash as the UKHospitality group said it was 'another crushing blow'.</p>

<p>There are also fears the move could have unintended consequences amid warnings of a potential 'surge of unregulated events and house parties'.</p>

<p>Tory MPs also expressed concerns about the curfew plans, describing them as a 'terrible blow' for the hospitality industry and warning there must not be another 'major lockdown'.</p>

<p>It was claimed that Mr Johnson had initially backed a total shutdown of the hospitality and leisure sectors before Chancellor Rishi Sunak persuaded him to take a less severe course after warning of economic carnage. </p>

<p>Just hours after setting out the new measures, the Prime Minister issued an emotional plea to the nation and warned Britons they faced a long hard winter of police-enforced curbs on their freedom to see off coronavirus.</p>

<p>He also hit out at his critics - including Tory MPs and business leaders who warned of the economic impact of the tough measures, adding: 'To those who say we don't need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own.</p>

<p>'The tragic reality of having Covid is that your mild cough can be someone else's death knell. </p>

<p>'And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable – with all the suffering that would entail – I must tell you that this is just not realistic.</p>

<p>'Because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers.</p>
