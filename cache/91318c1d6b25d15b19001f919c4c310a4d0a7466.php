<p>Andy dreams of hosting the wedding of a lifetime but vows to have a private affair, and even teases he may serenade fiancée Alex on the big day.</p>

<p>The musician, 30, who quit Made In Chelsea in 2015, told MailOnline his worst nightmare is to do another TV show, and he has strict rules against allowing his future children to appear on a reality series. </p>

<p>'We're going to plan a really nice wedding': Former Made In Chelsea star Andy Jordan is planning a wedding abroad after proposing to girlfriend Alexandra Suter </p>

<p>In an exclusive interview, he said: 'We've made the decision to do it exactly as we want to do it so we're going to take our time and plan a really nice wedding.</p>

<p>'It will be abroad. The goal is something outdoors. My dad lives in Spain, but who knows, we're looking at different options.</p>

<p>'We will definitely opt for a private wedding. There's not a chance we will be on the front of magazines. </p>

<p>'All I will say is there will definitely be some surprises on the day. I slightly went early and performed at my brother's wedding as part of my best man speech so I can't pull the same thing. You've got to go Love Actually style with secret trumpet players.'</p>

<p>Contrary to his ex-costar Spencer Matthews, 32, whose son Theodore, two, appeared on his reality show Spencer, Vogue and Baby Too, Andy says he plans to 'protect' his future children from the public eye for as long as possible.</p>

<p>He said: 'I couldn't think of anything worse than doing a show like that now.</p>

<p>'Having been through it, I would never be someone to have a baby and let them be on TV.</p>

<p>'I would protect them for as long as humanly possible from the public eye.</p>

<p>'From my point of view, it was fun and then I grew up. A lot of my peers would feel the same. They're all getting married now as well.</p>

<p>'I couldn't think of anything worse': Andy, who used to date Louise Thompson, says he wouldn't let his future children on a reality series, like his former co-star Spencer Matthews has done</p>

<p>Andy and Spencer came to blows on Made In Chelsea over their ex-Louise Thompson, 30, during filming of the show in 2013.</p>

<p>According to reports in the same year, Louise cheated on Andy with One Direction singer Niall Horan, 27.</p>

<p>Now Andy cites his 20s as 'the worst 10 years of his life' but doesn't blame E4 producers for his previous heartache.</p>

<p>He said: 'If you'd asked me about Made In Chelsea two years ago I would have hung up because my headspace wasn't good enough to process the past. Now I can look at things much more pragmatically.</p>

<p>'My headspace wasn't good': Andy cites his 20s as 'the worst 10 years of his life' but doesn't blame E4 producers for his previous heartache (November 2018)</p>

<p>'I have started writing some notes and have outlined some chapters about 20-30 being the worst 10 years of most people's lives.</p>

<p>'I don't hold any animosity towards the TV producers because it's their job to make a TV show with some sort of climax that makes you need to watch the next episode, that's their job.</p>

<p>'But when someone sends me a TV offer, like to be on The Voice, I don't find it hard to say no…' </p>

<p>Andy, who resides between Devon, Cornwell and London, released his latest EP 'Postcards from the Future' in August, which is a body of work inspired by fiancée, Alex.</p>

<p>History: Andy, who left Made In Chelsea in 2015, told MailOnline he finds it easy to turn down TV offers, like the chance to be on ITV's The Voice, due to his prior experience on the E4 show </p>

<p>He said: 'It was like getting hit by a train I guess, is the best description.</p>

<p>'You can write songs for 2-3 years and feel there's not much heart in this…</p>

<p>'Then Jesus, I had all these feelings, I'm the type of guy that wears his heart on his sleeve, I'm better at putting it into a song than I am saying it. </p>

<p>'I want to take my music as big as it can humanly go. The position I am in now is my dream.</p>

<p>'I have been given the freedom to create the music I've always wanted to create.</p>

<p>'I went into music with a fresh attitude of I'm doing this because I love it, the label I'm with are amazing.</p>

<p>'They're a small label and very artist focused but I want to get to the point where we're selling out tours.'</p>

<p>'Dream': Andy, who resides between Devon, Cornwell and London, released his latest EP 'Postcards from the Future' in August, which is a body of work inspired by fiancée, Alex </p>
