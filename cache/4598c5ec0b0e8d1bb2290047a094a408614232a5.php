<p>Her jaw-dropping appearance on the red carpet comes after Vanessa spoke exclusively to The Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye about preparing for her upcoming role in Pieces Of A Woman.</p>

<p>She said: 'I couldn't have acted that, because I've never given birth myself,' she told me. </p>

<p>'Just by pure chance an amazing woman allowed me to watch her give birth. I didn't know her but she was so generous and allowed me to be there when her boy was born.'</p>

<p>Vanessa added that she — along with on-screen husband Shia LaBeouf and director Kornel Mundruczo — wanted the birth scenes in the film to be as authentic as possible. </p>

<p>'There's a 26-minute continuous shot of me, as Martha, giving birth, so I'd better know about contractions and everything else,' she added. </p>
