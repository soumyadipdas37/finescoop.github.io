<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Louisiana man accused of brutally stabbing and dismembering both his parents over the Thanksgiving weekend in Tennessee in 2016 attempted to dissolve the victim's bodies in chemicals and boiled his mother's severed head on the stovetop, according to graphic testimony presented on the first day of the son's murder trial. </p>

<p>Joel Guy Jr, 31, appeared in Knoxville court on Monday on first-degree murder charges in the November 2016 slayings of his 61-year-old father, Joel Michael Guy Sr, and his 55-year-old mother, Lisa Guy.</p>

<p>Prosecutors told the jury panel on Monday that Guy Jr first knifed his father to death in the exercise room of his West Knox County house on November 26, 2016, then ambushed and stabbed his mother to death when she returned home from a shopping trip, reported WBIR. </p>

<p>Joel Guy Jr, 31, is on trial in Tennessee for the savage murders of his parents, Joel Guy Sr, 61, and Lisa Guy, 55, who were dismembered inside their home in 2016</p>

<p>Guy Sr was stabbed 42 times and had his limbs cut off, while his wife suffered 31 knife wounds and had her head severed and boiled in a pot  </p>

<p>The son then allegedly dismembered his parents' bodies and tried to dissolve some of the remains. </p>

<p>'Joel placed pieces of the bodies in an acid-based solution in an attempt to destroy evidence,' Knox County Sheriff's Office Maj. Michael MacLean testified. </p>

<p>Deputies who responded to the home on November 28 to perform a welfare check found chunks of remains strewn all throughout the gore-splattered home. </p>

<p>The victims' torsos and some of their limbs were placed in 45-gallon plastic containers, doused with a corrosive chemical and left to liquify, in what prosecutors described as a 'diabolical stew of human remains,' reported WVLT.</p>

<p>Lisa's severed head was discovered in a pot of boiling liquid on the stove, according to court documents.</p>

<p>Knox County prosecutor Leslie Nassios on Monday detailed the full roster of horrific injuries sustained by the victims. </p>

<p>Deputies performed a welfare check entered the Guys' home in West Knox County, Tennessee, on November 28, 2016, and discovered body parts strewn throughout </p>

<p>Guy Sr was stabbed and slashed 42 times, with some of the blows severing his ribs and puncturing his liver, lungs and kidneys. </p>

<p>Autopsy showed that the man's hands were cut off at the wrists, his arms were severed at the shoulder blade, his legs were sawed off at the hip and his right foot was removed at the ankle. Nassios said the evidence indicated the father fought for his life. </p>

<p>Lisa was stabbed 31 times and had nine of her ribs severed. Her legs were cut off below the knee and her arms were removed at the shoulder. </p>

<p>Prosecutors said Guy Jr had a checklist for the murders, suggesting premeditation. His written reminders to himself included 'get killing knives,' 'kill him with knife. Clean up mess before she gets home,' 'kill her with knife.' 'flush chunks down toilet, not garbage disposal,' get a sledgehammer to 'crush bones,' and 'body gives time of death, alibi.'</p>

<p>The son also reportedly made a note about programming his slain mother's phone so it would send him a text message while he was in Louisiana to 'prove she was alive.'  </p>

<p>According to the prosecution, Guy Jr's motive for the savage double homicide was financial because his parents had been planning to stop giving him money. </p>

<p>Guy was reportedly studying to be a plastic surgeon in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and had been in college for nine years while his parents supported him.</p>

<p>The couple, who both worked as engineers, were ready to retire and stop providing him with assistance.  </p>

<p>Prosecutors say Guy Jr's motive for the murders was financial because his parents had been planning to stop giving him money so they could retire comfortably </p>

<p>In his notes, Guy Jr included a section titled 'Assets.' In it, Nassios told the court that the defendant laid out a plan to hide his father's body and inherit his mother's $500,000 life insurance.</p>

<p>'Money all mine,' he wrote, according to the records. 'I get the whole thing.' </p>

<p>Guy Jr's sister and half-sister told the jury from the stand that they knew their father and his wife intended to stop giving him money. The couple planned to break the news to him during the Christmas holiday.</p>

<p>Angela Guy, the defendant's half-sister said from the stand that her father and Lisa told her it 'was time for Joel Michael to stand on his own two feet.'</p>

<p>Guy Jr arrived at his parents' home on Wednesday, November 23, spent Thanksgiving with his parents and three sisters, and returned to Baton Rouge on Sunday. </p>

<p>When Lisa failed to show up for work on Monday, her supervisor, Jennifer Whitehead, made multiple attempts to reach her by phone, but she did not pick up. </p>

<p>Concerned for her safety, Whitehead told jurors she called the authorities and asked them to perform a welfare check, leading to the gruesome discoveries that were described by investigators as 'horrific.' </p>

<p>Nassios said deputies who walked into the crime scene had a 'physical reaction' to the odor of chemicals and decaying flesh in the home where the thermostat was set to 90 degrees. </p>

<p>The Guys had just sold their house and were in the process of moving into another home belonging to Guy Sr's deceased mother, which they had recently purchased, The Advocate reported.</p>

<p>Guy Jr was arrested in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, just days after the gruesome killings </p>

<p>Rene Charles, Guy Sr's sister, said her brother and his wife had planned to retire in Surgoinsville, Tennessee, according to the Kingsport Times-News. </p>

<p>Guy Jr was apprehended at his Baton Rouge, Louisiana, apartment on November 29 when he tried to get into his 2006 Hyundai Sonata. </p>

<p>The murder trial is expected to last a week. The state is not seeking the death penalty against Guy Jr.  </p>
