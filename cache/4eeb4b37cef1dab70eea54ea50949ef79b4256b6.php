<p>'This product is transformative for my hair!' wrote one reviewer. 'I use it as a leave-in-conditioner, just a tiny 5p size blob, applied to wet hair, before drying. Be careful not to over-use it/use too much product, or you may end up with lank hair.</p>

<p>'I ran out of it recently and tried various conditioning serums, but my hair still looked wiry, dry and frizzy - yuck - which made me realise how wonderful this product really is.'</p>

<p>'Wow I am absolutely blown away how good this product is,' said another. 'I have long thick (well had) hair until I put a box dye on it in lockdown and I swear my hair was fried it was coming out in handfuls, and I thought I would never get my hair back to normal and then Bam! Olaplex 3 that's all I used; I am shocked by how healthy and thick my hair looks!!'</p>
