<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>On the one hand, I wish the Amazon Prime cameras were still in the Tottenham changing room after this defeat. On the other, I doubt they’d have shown us what was said. That fly-on-the-wall documentary felt like a nice PR exercise for Daniel Levy and Co. </p>

<p>But even Amazon would have struggled to paint this in a positive light. Jose Mourinho can only have been livid. </p>

<p>His players looked utterly lethargic in what could be their first of nine fixtures in three weeks. </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho will be livid after his lethargic Tottenham team fell to defeat against Everton</p>

<p>Everton strolled it, and Mourinho afterwards described his players’ efforts to press their opponents as ‘lazy pressure’. Play like this and even Bulgarian minnows Lokomotiv Plovdiv would pose Spurs problems on Thursday.</p>

<p>One scene in that Amazon doc sees players in the treatment room complaining about the injury pile-up at Christmas. They’re about to go through a schedule just as challenging. </p>

<p>For Carlo Ancelotti, this was a performance of positivity. The header by Dominic Calvert-Lewin was as exquisite as the cross by Lucas Digne. </p>

<p>James Rodriguez slotted in nicely, as did Abdoulaye Doucoure and Allan. This new-look Everton team are an exciting prospect.</p>

<p>Everton put on a performance of positivity for Carlo Ancelotti and their only goal was exquisite</p>
