<p>Other pictures showed the setting as a whole, which looked to be a teeny beach town rich with local flavor and culture.</p>

<p>The ex of Scott Disick was in fact seen just one day prior to posting the Italy pictures living it up with new bestie Addison Rae in Miley Cyrus's disco ball-filled Midnight Sky truck, which is currently doing the rounds in Los Angeles. </p>
