<p>The pair had been in an on-and-off relationship for a number of years, and had reconnected about two months ago when Kaitlyn, 26, was kicked off The Bachelor.</p>

<p>But the blonde reality starlet confirmed on Friday that she was no longer in contact with the former world No. 17, telling The Daily Telegraph their 'friendship is definitely over'.</p>

<p>'I do wish him the best and I hope he finds his way and surrounds himself with people who have his best interests at heart,' she added.</p>

<p>Kaitlyn downplayed their romantic connection, but said she had stayed 'loyal' to the fallen sportsman for years.</p>

<p>'It's more like loyalty with him and I've always had a soft spot for him because I know a lot of people don't like him, but I wouldn't call it dating or a relationship,' she said.</p>

<p>Not speaking: The blonde reality starlet confirmed on Friday that she was no longer in contact with the former world No. 17, telling The Daily Telegraph their 'friendship is definitely over'</p>

<p>It comes after Bernard and Kaitlyn had a very public row at the Hollywood Showgirls strip club on the Gold Coast earlier this month.</p>

<p>Their argument on Saturday, September 5, led to Kaitlyn leaving the club, while Bernard - a regular patron - was allowed to stay.</p>

<p>A source told Daily Mail Australia the altercation brought the club to a standstill.</p>

<p>'They got in a big fight at Hollywood Showgirls the other weekend... everyone heard and saw it,' the onlooker said.</p>

<p>'It was crazy, even for a night out on the Gold Coast. They were screaming at each other.'</p>

<p>Having long been regarded as the brightest future star in world tennis, Bernard's career is almost at a point of no return.</p>

<p>The world No. 209 has not won a Grand Slam singles match since mid-2018.</p>

<p>The former Wimbledon quarter finalist was such a prodigious young talent that at 12 he was signed by management giant IMG.</p>

<p>But after reaching a highest ranking of 17 in 2016, his career has been downhill ever since and marred by a number of incidents both off and on the court.</p>

<p>Kaitlyn is the daughter of former NRL star Sean Hoppe, who was the league's leading try scorer in 1995.</p>

<p>A former real estate agent and model, she entered The Bachelor as an intruder in episode two, but was eliminated on Thursday night.</p>
