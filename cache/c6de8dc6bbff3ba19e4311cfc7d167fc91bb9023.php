<p>Malaysia born Golding, 33, has since traded southern England for southern California and a new life with his stunning wife, fitness guru Liv Lo, in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Well done: Henry Golding admits he's put the long hours of lockdown to good use by falling back on his former career as a hairdresser and helping wife Liv Lo with her blow-drys</p>

<p>And he admits to winning some brownie points from Lo by putting his hairdressing skills into practice as they isolated together throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>He told the Radio Times: 'Once in a while, when she’s struggling with a blow dry in the morning, I’ll finish off the back for her.'</p>

<p>Lockdown has temporarily curtailed a zig-zag acting career that only took off after he quit hairdressing and journeyed to his native Malaysia for a fresh start as a travel presenter, a job that led to his first starring role in Malaysian comedy Pisau Cukur.</p>

<p>Unusual start: The actor  has enjoyed an unconventional rise to the top after originally dropping out of school at 16 and taking a job as an apprentice hairstylist in Surrey</p>

<p>Crazy Rich Asians, a romantic comedy set against the backdrop of a Singapore wedding, helped turn him into star - paving the way for prominent roles in A Simple Favour and the Wham! inspired Last Christmas. </p>

<p>The latter saw him star alongside acting legend Emma Thompson, and he admits to posing incredulously in the bathroom mirror with one of her two Academy Awards during a visit to her home. </p>

<p>Through it all Golding has maintained an unbreakable bond with his wife, who he met long before his fortunes changed and helps ensure his feet remain firmly planted on the ground. </p>

<p>He said: 'It’s all about transactions. I went into the industry with a strong head on my shoulders and I’m lucky to have a wife who doesn’t let me get away with anything.</p>

<p>'We’ve known each other for a decade and have been dating for almost as long. We’ve been through the wringer, through the highest and lowest times.'</p>
