<p>Proud Boys is a far-right organization that admits only men as members and promotes and engages in political violence. The group believes white men and western culture are under siege and one of its co-founders recorded a video titled '10 things I hate about the Jews.'</p>

<p>Swinney was booked in jail the day after Trump struggled to condemn white supremacy at the presidential debate, instead choosing to focus on the far-right group. </p>

<p>'Proud boys, stand back and stand by, but I tell you what, somebody has got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem, this is a left-wing problem,' he said. </p>

<p>During last night's presidential debate, Trump asserted that in 'Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, I support President Trump'. </p>
