<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham were thrashing out a deal on Tuesday night to see former hero Gareth Bale make a sensational return to the club.</p>

<p>On a dramatic day of high-level discussions - led by chairman Daniel Levy - Spurs believe they have moved into a position where they have a realistic opportunity of snatching the Real Madrid star from under the noses of rivals Manchester United.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands Real Madrid will agree to pay in-excess of 50 percent of the Wales international's astronomical wages of up to £500,000-per-week in order to facilitate the deal.</p>

<p>Tottenham Hotspur are edging closer to a sensational deal which will see Gareth Bale return</p>

<p>Tottenham are believed to have explored a loan or a permanent deal, which could include a swap for one of the club's premium first-team players, for Bale Levy, who was also trying to close a deal for Real's highly-rated left-back Sergio Reguilon yesterday, was at the forefront of Tottenham's negotiations yesterday.</p>

<p>And, as of last night, the north London club were confident they could land a player they sold for a then world record fee of £85.3million in 2013.</p>

<p>Tottenham have explored the idea of trying to lure Bale back to Premier League in previous seasons - but this is the closest they have gone to making a deal a reality.</p>

<p>United retain an interest in signing Bale as an alternative to Jadon Sancho, but Tottenham feel they are in pole position.</p>

<p>Spurs were also locked in advanced talks to sign £25million-rated Reguilon from the Bernabeu yesterday.</p>

<p>Similarly, United have an interest in the Spain international, who spent last season on loan at Sevilla but are set to be pipped by Spurs.</p>

<p>It is understood that Reguilon was originally attracted by a move to Old Trafford but the 23-year-old has been made aware of how desperate manager Jose Mourinho is to work with him, which has made a move to Spurs a very strong possibility.</p>

<p>Real are understood to want a buy-back clause in any departure for Reguilon, and Spurs are said to be more open to agreeing to that stipulation than United.</p>
