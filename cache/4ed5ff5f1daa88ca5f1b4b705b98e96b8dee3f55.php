<p>Equal: Leonardo DiCaprio reveals in a new documentary series that he believes none of us will be 'equal' until we all vote</p>

<p>'In 1776, voting was a privilege, almost exclusively for white men with property,' Dicaprio says in the clip.</p>

<p>'In the founding constitution, you will not find the right to vote. This right to vote has been a battlefield in American democracy,' adds a black female voter.</p>

<p>'If your vote didn't matter, why the hell are so many systems and people trying so hard to prevent you from voting?" a Black male voter says, before it comes back to DiCaprio.</p>

<p>The series will include a number of voting resources from several organizations including Michelle Obama's nonpartisan group When We All Vote.</p>
