<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the disturbing moment a doctor, her employee and a police officer were beaten by their neighbors and guests after they asked them to tone down the music level.</p>

<p>Surveillance video captured the moment Dr. Dalila Peñaranda and domestic worker Carmen Pérez were attacked in Barranquilla, Colombia, last Friday.</p>

<p>A separate video shows Peñaranda talking to Martín Parra and Fanny Franco outside their apartment where at least 30 people, including musicians, gathered to celebrate the 18th birthday party of the couple's daughter, completely ignoring the country's ban on large gatherings. </p>

<p>Dr. Dalila Peñaranda and her home employee were attacked by her neighbor tenant and guests who gathered for a birthday party last Friday in Barranquilla, Colombia. The doctor approached the apartment of Martín Parra and Fanny Franco and asked them to lower the music volume before the argument escalated into a melee</p>

<p>Carmen Pérez suffered several bruises to her face after she was attacked outside her boss doctor's apartment in Colombia</p>

<p>Assad Baraque (pictured in the orange shirt) and Jalim Rebaje (pictured in the blue shirt) punched Dr. Dalila Peñaranda after she went to her next door neighbor's apartment to get them to lower the music volume</p>

<p>Peñaranda could be heard telling Franco, 'it's not the appropriate time for a party; it's the same story every weekend.'</p>

<p>The exchange between the physician and Franco grew tense when Franco smacked Peñaranda in the face. </p>

<p>Subsequently, a guest identified as Assad Baraque could be seen in the video striking Peñaranda in the face before his friend Jalim Rebaje stepped in and punched the doctor.</p>

<p>As the cops and several other party guests attempted to break up the melee, Pérez fell to the floor before Rebaje kicked her face.</p>

<p>A police officer also is seen sustaining blows during the chaos. </p>

<p>Jalim Rebaje is expected to be brought up on charges after he was seen on a surveillance video punching a doctor and kicking her employee in the face</p>

<p>Assad Baraque and Jalim Rebaje are two of four individuals who will be charged with assaulting a doctor and her home employee in Barranquilla, Colombia</p>

<p>According to the Barranquilla Metropolitan Police Department, a total of 8 million Colombian pesos in fines were given to Baraque, Rebaje and three other guests, Parra and Franco, and the building management.</p>

<p>Franco, Baraque, Rebaje and a fourth person were expected to brought up on charges Thursday, according to Colombia's attorney general's office. </p>

<p>Barranquilla mayor Jaime Pumarejo slammed the apartment tenants and party guests for the attack and hosting the party.</p>

<p>'Parties are prohibited, there is nothing to celebrate,' Pumarejo said. 'We will find authorities ready to act against those who violate this measure. They cannot play with the suffering of families who lost a loved one, or jettison the city's efforts to regain normalcy.' </p>
