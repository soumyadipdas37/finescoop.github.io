<p>A sad twist: The text messages between Bachelor stars Cassie Randolph and Colton Underwood have now been shared after she was granted a temporary restraining order against her ex </p>

<p>Not well: The former football player has called her 'selfish' and 'shady' in several of the messages seen by E! News from documents pertaining to the order </p>

<p>The alleged texts were often long and rambling.</p>

<p>On June 27, 2020, Cassie‘s younger brother claimed to have seen Colton in the alley outside Cassie's Huntigton Beach residence at 2 am.</p>

<p>But when Colton was confronted, he started angry text messages to Cassie and her friend Linda Salas, and Cassie's younger brother, according to E! News. </p>

<p>'…Because your a selfish person who isn’t ready to be loved,' read one message, according to the site.</p>

<p>They had a good start: The two seemed so happy after their season of The Bachelor was over </p>

<p>'I spent two years loving you the best I could and now I’m sitting here feeling like a fool… You’ve hurt me beyond words… </p>

<p>'I’ve always done nothing but be there for you and you still disrespect me all the time.'</p>

<p>When Cassie asked what she did wrong, Colton said, 'You hid things from me and been so shady.'</p>

<p>But later he I apologized: 'I'm lost right now. I'm drowning.'</p>

<p>A month later her ex Caelan visited her apartment. </p>

<p>Hurtful: . On June 27, 2020, Cassie‘s younger brother claimed to have seen Colton in the alley outside Cassie's Huntigton Beach residence at 2 am. But when Colton was confronted, he started angry text messages to Cassie and her friend Linda Salas, and Cassie's younger brother, according to E! News</p>

<p>Colton knew he would be there and 'obsessively called and sent text messages' to Cassie causing her to feel watched. </p>

<p>Days later he allegedly showed up to her residence and yelled at her: ‘I am going to keep you accountable.’”</p>

<p>He then reportedly texted, 'I’m just sitting in bed trying to fall asleep wondering if the woman I’m madly in love with is having a good time with her ex. I have a million questions and all of them I don’t know if I want the answers to. My heart hurts a lot right now and I miss my best friend, my lover and the one person I never expected to lose.'</p>

<p>Cassie then shared: 'Colton I really care about you too. I know going through everything is very hard and sucks. And I appreciate you calling me to talk with me. But I also won’t want to make it into something it isn’t. </p>

<p>Hard to take: '…Because your a selfish person who isn’t ready to be loved,' read one message, according to the site. Seen in April 2019</p>

<p>'You know that us trusting each other and being cool with each other, and caring about each other is still there. I don’t think that is something that should be able to flip flop so easily. And also, it’s a different road we are navigating now that we aren’t used to. Don’t be upset, you know I care about you so much. You know that.'</p>

<p>According to the filing, Colton 'used alias phone numbers to anonymously send harassing text messages at all hours of the day to Ms. Randolph and to her friends. Mr. Underwood also sent harassing text messages to himself pretending to also be a victim of the anonymous stalker… He later admitted to being the one sending the messages.' </p>

<p>Now Colton must stay at least 100 yards away from Cassie, her home, her work and must not contact her and avoid all threatening behaviour. </p>

<p>In her court filing Cassie attached photos of the tracking device she says Colton attached to the rear bumper of her car in August. She claims he admitted to attaching the device. </p>

<p>More anger: Another message allegedly said: 'I spent two years loving you the best I could and now I’m sitting here feeling like a fool… You’ve hurt me beyond words… 'I’ve always done nothing but be there for you and you still disrespect me all the time' </p>

<p>There will be a hearing in October where Colton will be able to tell his side of the story, TMZ reported Monday. </p>

<p>The 25-year-old fell for Colton on season 23 of The Bachelor which aired in early 2019 but the couple split in May. </p>

<p>Cassie also noted their split as mid-April, though they announced the breakup in May 2020, one and a half years after they ended up together on the dating show.  </p>

<p>The former contestant claimed Underwood taped a tracking device to the bottom of her car's back bumper to track her whereabouts, which she said he confessed to doing.   </p>

<p>Another odd turn: According to the filing, Colton 'used alias phone numbers to anonymously send harassing text messages at all hours of the day to Ms. Randolph and to her friends. Mr. Underwood also sent harassing text messages to himself pretending to also be a victim of the anonymous stalker… He later admitted to being the one sending the messages.' Seen in 2019</p>

<p>Underwood, 28, also recovered from coronavirus at her family's home.  </p>

<p>DailyMail.com has reached out to Underwood's rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. </p>

<p>The allegations reportedly come as a surprise to the former NFL player, who has allegedly not spoke with Randolph in over a month, according to Us Weekly.</p>

<p>'He's been in Colorado and this was all a surprise. He was completely blindsided,' the source said.  </p>

<p>Since announcing their split earlier this year, Randolph and Underwood have had public dust ups about their relationship and break up. </p>

<p>In July, Randolph accused her ex of trying to 'monetize' their split by writing about it in the upcoming second edition of his book without her prior approval and though they agreed to remain silent on the reasons of the split.  </p>

<p>Split: The former lovebirds first sparked breakup rumors after he returned to his hometown in Colorado after recovering from coronavirus at her family's home in Huntington Beach, California  </p>

<p>'I have gained so much clarity about what I want and more importantly what I need in a relationship,' she wrote at the time. 'I'm so excited for this next chapter of my life with new stories and new people. I can't thank y'all enough for your understanding and your support during this time.' </p>

<p>Adding: 'I would like to place on public record &amp; ask you politely to refrain from discussing our relationship, as we agreed... I would also like to ask that you don't cloud our great, 11/2 year relationship with a messy breakup. ' </p>

<p>'When our relationship ended we agreed to handle things as privately as possible as we attempted to navigate our new relationship as friends,' Underwood wrote to Instagram after Randolph appeared in a short segment for The Bachelor: Greatest Seasons of All Time. 'I chose to do that since we were living in this interim period, but obviously a lot changed this week.' </p>

<p>Though Underwood later accused The Bachelor franchise of manipulating and taking advantage of Randolph following their breakup.  </p>

<p>She declined to divulge much information, however, Underwood said he was upset to see how Chris and The Bachelor franchise focused solely on their split, it has been claimed.</p>

<p>They seemed to be on a good road until the split: Earlier this year, Colton said he could see them getting engaged by the end of 2020</p>

<p>The former lovebirds first sparked breakup rumors after he returned to his hometown in Colorado after recovering from coronavirus at her family's home in Huntington Beach, California. </p>

<p>'Its been a crazy few months to say the least, Cass and I have been doing a lot of self-reflecting. Sometimes people are just meant to be friends - and that's okay,' the former NFL player captioned a black and white snap of them from behind.</p>

<p>He added: 'We both have grown immensely and been through so much together - so this isn't the end of our story, it's the start of a whole new chapter for us.' </p>

<p>Then Randolph shared a series of snaps from their relationship with a number of shots with her arms wrapped around Underwood.  </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Colton said he could see them getting engaged by the end of 2020. 'If she were here, she'd nudge me for saying this, but I think an engagement is something we'd both like to see this year,' he said. </p>
