<p>I just re-posted it 'cause I thought it was nothing. Yeah, it showed my butt in it, but it wasn't sexual.'  </p>

<p>She has since created a new account which has already gained 84,800 followers.    </p>

<p>'My main acc got disabled at 850k. Follow me here until I (hopefully) get it back,' she has written in the bio. </p>
