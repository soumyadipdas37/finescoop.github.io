<p>It's this one's birthday today and, as usual, I struggle to find words that celebrate all she is,' the Winnetka Bowling League frontman began in the caption of a polaroid picture showing Duff standing next to a canopied bed.</p>

<p>Sweet nothings: Matthew Koma shared a romantic message of love to wife Hilary Duff for her 33rd birthday on Monday, September 28</p>

<p>Koma would find the perfect set of words to shower his wife with during these uncertain times in this post-COVID-19 world.</p>

<p>'In a global pandemic, during our first year of marriage, in a world that's becoming a heavier and more confusing place to navigate with kids in tow, there's nobody who does it better,' he added.</p>

<p>He ended the post with: 'I love you something beyond and I can't wait to foam all over you today. <?php echo e('@'); ?>itsfoamtime' </p>

<p>Birthday message: 'I love you something beyond,' Koma wrote, in part, along with a polaroid photo of Duff standing next to a canopied bed</p>

<p>Koma, 33, also shared a black-and-white photo of the couple standing in front of Duff's two-tier birthday cake with her eight-year-old son Luca.</p>

<p>Flashing a glowing smile on her face, the Lizzie McGuire star has her arms wrapped around Luca as he appears to be sticking his fingers into the cake to get a taste of the icing.</p>

<p>Duff is dressed in an all-black ensemble with her blonde tresses pulled back into a bun, with the exception of a few strands of hair, and a 'happy birthday' headband along the top of her head.</p>

<p>Her husband can be seen leaning in on his ladylove in black pants, a plaid shirt over a black tee, and a light-colored beanie cap.</p>

<p>Sweet snap: Koma, who's the frontman for the band Winnetka Bowling League, also shared a photo of his wife wrapping her arms around her son Luca, eight, who appears to be going in for a taste of the icing</p>

<p>Koma also showed off his sense of humor by sharing a quick video of his gag-gift  -- a roll of unique toilet paper -- that they both shared on their Instagram Stories.</p>

<p>It read: 'Happy birthday... I love [red heart] the sh** [pile of poop} outta you,' on each sheet of toilet paper.   </p>

<p>The birthday girl headlined the post: 'Hubby was really proud of this gift .' </p>

<p>The couple are the proud parents to daughter Banks, who turns two-years-old in October.</p>
