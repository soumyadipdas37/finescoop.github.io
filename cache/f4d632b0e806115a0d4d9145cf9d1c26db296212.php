<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The five competing teams on The Block presented their guest ensuite to the judges on Sunday night's episode.</p>

<p>And for Daniel and Jade's 1930s reveal, judge Neale Whitaker certainly did not hold back.  </p>

<p>The 58-year-old slammed the couple's interpretation, saying nothing in the room referenced the decade.   </p>

<p>'It's a complete cop-out!' The Block judge Neale Whitaker (pictured) SLAMMED Daniel and Jade's 'generic' guest ensuite, as it 'ignores' any reference to the 1930s on Sunday's episode</p>

<p>'It's a cop-out. It's a complete cop-out,' Neale said, describing the space as 'a generic contemporary bathroom'.</p>

<p>Daniel and Jade presented a guest ensuite with references to 2020, such as marble walls and ledges, and contemporary tapware and finishes.  </p>

<p>'It's a room that's ignored a lot of great opportunity. Yes, it is beautiful, meeting a brief, and they have taken the easiest path.</p>

<p>Neale said of the space: 'It's a room that's ignored a lot of great opportunity. Yes, it is beautiful, meeting a brief, and they have taken the easiest path' </p>

<p>'They've thought, "Oh, well, all mirrors at the moment look [Art] Deco, so we'll just put one of those in - that'll keep the judges happy". Sorry, doesn't work.'   </p>

<p>For Harry and Tash's 1920's guest ensuite, the critique went off to a stellar start.</p>

<p>Neale was in favour of the teale wall tiles and skylight, while fellow judge Shaynna Blaze liked the curves on the cabinetry and toilet.</p>

<p>However, the choice of floor tiles was poorly received particularly by Shaynna, who found them to be from an earlier era.   </p>

<p>Neale said he was 'clutching at straws' to find elements of the 1920s in the room, while Darren Palmer found an issue with there not being any underfloor heating.  </p>

<p>All three judges were in awe of Sarah and George's 1940's guest ensuite, with Shaynna complimenting the luxury details.</p>

<p>Nailed it: Darren praised the couple for their attention to detail, specifically with the choice of tapware and styling, with Shaynna adding that the pink colour palette was perfect </p>

<p>Neale even went so far as to describe the space as 'part bathroom, part cathedral'.  </p>

<p>Luke and Jasmin's 1910's guest ensuite was praised by the judges, with Darren saying that while it matches the period, it also still feels contemporary.</p>

<p>Praise: Jimmy and Tam's 1950's guest ensuite (pictured) was well received by Darren, with the judge describing the space as having a 'retro, childhood charm' </p>

<p>Shaynna commended their choice of wall paneling and the soft print on the delicate floor tiles. </p>

<p>Jimmy and Tam's 1950's guest ensuite was well received by Darren, with the judge describing the space as having a 'retro, childhood charm'.</p>

<p>Shaynna was in awe of the 'divine sink' with its modern interpretation, while Neale said the bathroom was the perfect combination of the 1950's and 2020. </p>

<p>Jimmy and Tam received the highest combined score from the judges, 28-and-a-half points.</p>
