<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An exhausted mother has revealed how a 'life-changing' £19 children's sleep spray stopped her daughter's horrifying night terrors.  </p>

<p>Katie, 34, from North London, was left at a loss when her three-year-old daughter Talia was too afraid to go to bed because of the 'traumatic' nightmares she was having every night. </p>

<p>Talia started having terrors at the beginning of summer, and would wake up screaming in the middle of the night, terrified that something was trying to get in to her bed. </p>

<p>After weeks of constant waking in the night, Katie was at her wits' end, and began investing in books, podcasts, and spent over £300 on trying to find a solution - even hiring sleep consultants to try. </p>

<p>But after a recommendation from a friend, Katie discovered a sleep aid spray designed especially for kids. Within days Talia was sleeping without a problem.  </p>

<p>Talia, pictuerd with her brother Aaron,  started having terrors at the beginning of summer, and would wake up screaming in the middle of the night, terrified that something was trying to get in to her bed</p>

<p>'I used to be that smug mum', said Katie, 'As Talia my first born was the dream baby and slept through the night 7pm-7am from just 8 weeks old. </p>

<p>'When I was pregnant with Aaron my second who is now 18 months, I developed insomnia, which I know is common in pregnancy but it has never really gone away since he was born.' </p>

<p>But at three and a half, Talia began waking several times in the night, with Katie suspecting the coronavirus pandemic, and the thought of starting pre-school this month could have been the underlying cause. </p>

<p>'She started waking a few times in the night', said Katie, 'Screaming that something was trying to get in to her bed. </p>

<p>'It was traumatic to see and I wasn't sure if all the talk of the virus or the fact she was starting pre-school in September was all subconsciously playing on her mind. </p>

<p>'After weeks of constant waking in the night and me not being able to get back to sleep me and my husband were both exhausted.' </p>

<p>Talia then became scared to be alone in her room at night, and Kate and her husband Simon would have to lie in her bed with her until she fell asleep. </p>

<p>Katie explained: 'Her sleep then became even worse as she started developing a fear of being left in her room at night and bedtime became such a real struggle.'   </p>

<p>'Her bed time is 7.00pm and unless me or my husband laid in her bed to get her to sleep, we would have tears and tantrums till about 11pm at night - when we caved in and got in to her bed.</p>

<p>'One particular night, Talia woke up screaming at 10.30pm, at 1.00am and then again at 1.30am screaming and shouting, I had to take her downstairs as she had woke up her baby brother Aaron, she then refused to be in her room at all and said a lion was in her room and she was terrified. </p>

<p>'Before I knew it Simon's alarm was going off at 6am and he was heading to work, I felt broken and utterly exhausted that particular day, I was at a total loss and getting very emotional with it all.' </p>

<p>The mother-of-two had no energy as a result of her broken sleep, and told her lack of energy created a 'vicious circle' where she would become 'snappy', creating a 'tense environment' in their home. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two had no energy as a result of her broken sleep, and had to stop going to the gym because she was so tired and told she and husband simon were 'constantly exhausted' </p>

<p>'I used to try and go to the gym or do a workout daily', she told, 'But the last few months being exhausted from broken sleep and no energy meant I stopped working out. </p>

<p>'It's like a vicious circle because that lead to less energy and found my general mood was lower and I has become rather snappy, the mood in the house was intense.' </p>

<p>After speaking to sleep coaches and spending hundreds trying to solve her daughter's night terrors, Katie was recommended DROWSY's sleep aid spray, designed especially for kids. </p>

<p>She told: 'I spoke to various sleep consultants, invested in books, listened to podcasts, but nothing was making a difference, looking back we spent well over £300 on trying to find a solution.</p>

<p> One particular night, Talia woke up screaming at 10.30pm, at 1.00am and then again at 1.30am screaming and shouting so loudly she woke her baby brother Aaron </p>

<p>After speaking to sleep coaches and spending hundreds trying to solve her daughter's night terrors, Katie was recommended DROWSY's sleep aid spray, designed especially for kids</p>

<p>'A friend mentioned a brand called DROWSY and after a quick google I discovered they had a sleep aid spray designed especially for kids, something I hadn't ever come across before so I thought at this stage anything would be worth a shot, I also invested in the S.O.S pillow spray for myself.' </p>

<p>Certified for ages 6 months plus, the children’s spray contains a blend of natural oils with relaxation and sleep benefits.  </p>

<p>Katie said she and Simon were 'shocked' by how well the product worked, sending their daughter to sleep within hours on the first evening, and called the spray the 'best thing they've ever done'. </p>

<p>'The first night, she fell asleep at 9.30pm but then slept through till 7.15 am - it was life changing, said Katie. </p>

<p>'The fact she had slept through even once was the first time in months, we were shocked but convinced it was a fluke, we were fascinated and couldn't wait to try it out again that evening. </p>

<p>Talia has now happily settled in at pre-school and Katie feels 'so lucky' that her daughter has been able to get over her night terrors</p>

<p>'Then it happened again, she fell asleep at 7.30pm and slept through till 7.15am, then it happened again and again and again, we have been using it for almost four month now and it's the best thing we have ever done!' </p>

<p>The mother told that Talia has now happily settled in at pre-school and feels 'so lucky' that her daughter has been able to get over her night terrors. </p>

<p>'We literally couldn't believe it', she told, 'We use it every single night and it has been nothing short of life changing for us! </p>

<p>'Talia is now at pre-school and we are so so lucky that she has settled in smoothly, I can't help but think this wouldn't be the case if she had still been suffering with her sleep.'</p>
