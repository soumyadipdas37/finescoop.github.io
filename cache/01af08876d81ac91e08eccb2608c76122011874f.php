<p>Lily Rann had chosen the style while on a holiday to Cyprus because of her Jamaican heritage.</p>

<p>The 12-year-old was was told she would be sent to isolation if she did not dump her new do.</p>

<p>But Lily is proud of her roots - her great-grandfather is said to be the first black miner in her hometown of Midsomer Norton, Somerset.</p>

<p>Lily Rann, 12, had chosen the style while on a holiday to Cyprus because of her Jamaican heritage -Â her great-grandfather is said to be the first black miner in her hometown</p>

<p>But the Year 8 pupil was told to lose the locks as it breached her Norton Hill School's policy of no unnatural hair colours</p>

<p>So the Year 8 pupil was devastated to learn that she would have to lose the locks as it breached her secondary school's policy of no unnatural hair colours.</p>

<p>Dad Chris said an agreement has since been reached to allow her back into lessons with the braids, providing she has the synthetic white extensions removed.</p>

<p>But he slammed Norton Hill School for their stance on the issue - claiming 'discrimination'.</p>

<p>He said: 'It's absolutely mad - there are people dying in this pandemic. There are more important things to be doing.</p>

<p>'Lily has had a really tough time with mental health over lockdown so we don't want her in isolation.</p>

<p>Dad Chris slammed Norton Hill School for their stance on the issue - claiming it was 'discrimination'</p>

<p>Chris said he informed the school of the new style before Lily went back on Tuesday - and claims they asked to see a picture. He didn't supply one but, when she went in, it was explained that she would have to go to isolation unless her hair was changed</p>

<p>'People have messaged us saying: 'What's her hair got to do with her learning?' It's discrimination. I think they are discriminating against her.</p>

<p>'I really like the hairstyle. They said it was unacceptable. I think it's more than acceptable.'</p>

<p>Lorry driver Chris, 32, said he booked his family a holiday after a relative died and left him some money.</p>

<p>He gave some of the cash to his son and daughter - which she used to pay for the hair extensions.</p>

<p>Chris said he informed the school of the new style before Lily went back on Tuesday - and claims they asked to see a picture.</p>

<p>He didn't supply one but, when she went in, it was explained that she would have to go to isolation unless her hair was changed.</p>

<p>This stance was also reiterated to Chris' partner and Lily's mum, Lydia Grubb, 31, in a meeting with staff.</p>

<p>He added: 'The school said they wouldn't have her in properly but in isolation because of it.</p>

<p>'They said the extensions need to be dyed or removed. They did say they didn't have a problem with the braids, which are essentially plaits.</p>

<p>A school said it was a 'shame' as Lily had already missed two weeks of school for the holiday, adding 'We have not refused entry into school for the pupil in question</p>

<p>'Lily's absolutely gutted. She even asked for bright colours in Cyprus and I said: 'No, the school won't let you have that'.</p>

<p>'It's just absolutely ridiculous - its not an eyesore. White is a natural colour.</p>

<p>'All that will happen is Lily's friends will say 'nice hair' on the first day and then it will be old news and forgotten about.'</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Norton Hill School said: 'We have not refused entry into school for the pupil in question.</p>

<p>'This is a great shame, as the pupil in question has already missed a great deal of schooling following a family holiday in the first 2 weeks of term.</p>

<p>'I am hopeful that the parents will support us in school to maintain standards and ensure that we can be focused on the education of children rather than their uniform.'</p>
