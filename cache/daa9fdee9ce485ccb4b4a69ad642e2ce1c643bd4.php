<p>Out and about: Robin Wright showed off her trim figure in a pair of skintight jeans when she stepped out in Los Angeles this Wednesday</p>

<p>The sizzling sensation made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as she emerged from lockdown amid the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>Robin's latest outing comes roughly two months after her ex-husband Sean Penn, 60, confirmed his marriage to Leila George, 28.</p>

<p>Leila's parents are both also in the acting profession - her mother Greta Scacchi is Sean's age and her father Vincent D'Onofrio is just one year older.</p>

<p>Robin and Sean were married from 1996 until 2010 and share two children who are right around Leila's age - daughter Dylan, 29, and son Hopper, 27.</p>

<p>Off she goes: The 54-year-old actress slipped into a T-shirt from RE/DONE which was co-founded by Alessandra Ambrosio's ex Jamie Mazur</p>

<p>Rumors circulated at the beginning of this August that Sean and Leila had secretly tied the knot after four years of dating.</p>

<p>News of the wedding spread when they received congratulations on Instagram from Josh Brolin, as well as from movie producer Mike Medavoy's wife Irena.</p>

<p>A few days later Sean went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and showed off his gold wedding band, confirming that he has married for a third time.</p>

<p>'We did a COVID wedding. By that I mean it was a county commissioner on Zoom, and we were at the house,' Sean revealed.</p>

<p>The look: Sweeping her signature blonde hair up into a high ponytail, she accessorized with a sleek pair of sunglasses and pulled on some casual sneakers</p>

<p>'My two children and her brother, and we did it that way,' said Sean, who won an Academy Award in a biopic of Harvey Milk.</p>

<p>Robin's first husband was actor Dane Witherspoon and she is currently married to French fashion executive Clement Giraudet whom she wed in 2018.</p>

<p>Meanwhile before he took up with Robin, Sean had a highly publicized failed marriage to Madonna which lasted from 1985 until 1989.</p>
