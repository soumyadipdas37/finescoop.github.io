<p>A post on the Hants Roads Policing Twitter account said: 'Unbelievably the rider of this e-scooter thought it was ok to ride on the M3 near Eastleigh.... yes, the motorway!</p>

<p>'They have been issued with a fine, 6 points on their driving licence and the scooter seized for no insurance.</p>

<p>'Just a reminder that they are illegal to use on public roads and footpaths unless rented as part of the trial zones.</p>

<p>'You risk getting points, fine and your scooter being seized if used illegally.'</p>

<p>The Government is currently conducting a trial of electric, or e-scooter, rental fleets in cities across the country with a view to legalisation.</p>

<p>It was reported last week that e-scooters could even be fitted with number plates after warnings that antisocial behaviour related to their use is on the rise. </p>
