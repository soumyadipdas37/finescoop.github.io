<p>Sam told MailOnline at the time: 'I do think there's something about Surrey, I like the little towns, the villages, the schools and we have got little Paul into a school we both love.</p>

<p>'We viewed quite a few, like six or seven schools, and the one we both loved the most he got accepted a place just under two weeks ago. We are really happy about it.'</p>

<p>Talking about Paul Jr's reaction to starting school, Sam sweetly revealed: 'He came with us on the second viewing, he spent a few hours there and loved it. It was really cute, as we left the school, he said: "Oh I've really loved it there, can I go back tomorrow?"  </p>
