<p>Last May, Holly gushed about her three-year relationship with the sportsman in an interview with MailOnline.</p>

<p>The blonde beauty enthused: 'I’ve never been in a relationship with someone who has loved me back. It’s the first time I’ve ever felt that.' </p>

<p>Their romance has gone from strength-to-strength as she packed up and left her Teesside home to start her new life in Manchester last year.</p>

<p>Turn it up! The DJ worked his magic in a gold-theme outdoor booth, complete with a tinsel curtain and a balloon arch</p>

<p>Uh oh: Model Zahida Allen appeared worse-for-wear as she napped on the floor</p>

<p>Hinting at an engagement just weeks before the sweet moment took place, Holly added: 'I’m hoping for a ring, anytime now would be great. I’m just waiting for it.'</p>

<p>The TV star faced crippling anxiety two years ago when her toxic relationship with former co-star Kyle Christie came to an end. </p>

<p>At the height of her mental health battle, she suffered from panic attacks, lost her confidence and self esteem - with the thought of even going to the supermarket being too much to handle. </p>

<p>'Today has been iconic': Guests were presented with pre-packed clothing to wear to emulate Holly</p>

<p>Cheeky: The TV star held onto a pair of prosthetic breasts to mimic her FF implants, which she removed last year</p>

<p>The night is young: The group sung along to Katy Perry's Firework as they headed to their next destination</p>

<p>'So when I got with Jacob I realised when you’re with the right person, it’s so easy you don’t have to fight at all. It’s the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>'I don’t regret the relationship with Kyle because it taught me so much, I learned everything I know from that relationship. It only made me a stronger person.' </p>

<p>Before her three-year romance with Kyle, 27, broke down in March 2017, Holly briefly dated fellow reality star James Tindale and X Factor star Frankie Cocozza in 2011.</p>

<p>Her happy place: The blonde announced her engagement to Macclesfield Town forward Jacob Blyth in June last year</p>
