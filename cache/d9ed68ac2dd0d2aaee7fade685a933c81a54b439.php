<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Think Downton Abbey meets Apocalypse Now – with a love triangle thrown in – and you'll get some idea of what ITV's new six-part period drama The Singapore Grip is all about. </p>

<p>Even the team behind the show admit it's a difficult series to pin down.</p>

<p>'It's not your regular period drama,' says producer Farah Abushwesha, speaking on the set in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. 'We're totally off-brand with this one.' </p>

<p>Director Tom Vaughan puts it more succinctly. 'It's like Jane Austen has written a comedy of manners – then the Japanese decide to bomb it!'</p>

<p>David Morrissey stars as Walter Blackett (pictured) in ITV's new six-part period drama The Singapore Grip</p>

<p>Walter's wife, Sylvia, is played by Jane Horrocks (pictured). The characters are expats enjoying the fruits of success in the Far East rubber trade</p>

<p>Based on the 1978 novel by JG Farrell, which drew on real events, The Singapore Grip is initially the story of rich Brits living lives of excess in the Crown colony in the early 1940s. </p>

<p>But the invasion of the island by Japan in 1942, one of the key events of the Second World War, throws their lives into turmoil.</p>

<p>David Morrissey and Jane Horrocks appear as Walter and Sylvia Blackett, expats enjoying the fruits of his success in the Far East rubber trade. </p>

<p>Walter's business partner Mr Webb is played by Charles Dance, with Colm Meaney as his associate Major Archer. </p>

<p>Australian actress Georgia Blizzard plays the Blacketts' scheming daughter Joan, a woman with her sights set on Mr Webb's son Matthew (Luke Treadaway). </p>

<p>A love triangle develops between Joan Blackett, Matthew Webb and Vera Chiang, with Joan pursuing Matthew for all she's worth. Pictured: Luke Treadaway plays Webb</p>

<p>But will Matthew fall for enigmatic Chinese refugee Vera Chiang (former Coronation Street actress Elizabeth Tan), who was taken in by his father after escaping from the Japanese in China?</p>

<p>Sir Christopher Hampton, who won an Oscar for his screenplay of the 1988 film Dangerous Liaisons with Glenn Close, has adapted the novel for TV. </p>

<p>He knew JG Farrell, who died in 1979, and has long been fascinated by the author's work and the catastrophe at the heart of The Singapore Grip.</p>

<p>'One of my uncles, Robert, was working in the Far East at the time for Cable &amp; Wireless, and managed to secure a berth on one of the last ships to flee Singapore before the Japanese invasion,' says Christopher. </p>

<p>The expats' lives are thrown into turmoil by the Japanese invasion of Singapore, which came in 1942</p>

<p>'He was fortunate to avoid the huge number of deaths that followed. When Jim Farrell wrote about this period in history in The Singapore Grip I devoured the book immediately, so I relished the chance to adapt it.'</p>

<p>The events of The Singapore Grip are true to life and painful to observe. </p>

<p>'Britain's big guns were pointing out to sea when the Japanese attack was coming overland, and its troops were deployed in the wrong sector of the island in defiance of all intelligence,' says Christopher. </p>

<p>The Singapore Grip was shot entirely on location in Malaysia, which was preferred to Singapore because the latter is now dominated by skyscrapers, and the tropical weather proved a challenge for cast and crew alike. </p>

<p>'We used the old British High Commission located on a hill overlooking Kuala Lumpur as the Blacketts' house and grounds, and during one storm the swimming pool was struck by lightning. It turned the water green,' says producer Farah Abushwesha.</p>

<p>Storms weren't the only challenge, as temperatures regularly hit 35°C or more in the Malaysian capital. </p>

<p>'The trick is to turn off the air conditioning so you don't keep getting hot and then cold,' says Charles Dance.</p>

<p>'Your body has to take it in. Unfortunately, when you need to look presentable you do depend on the air con. </p>

<p>'The other trick is to walk very, very slowly.'</p>

<p>Jane Horrocks agrees. 'We had places we could go to for shade but if I was out in the heat, I found the best thing to do was just to stay very, very still!'</p>

<p>David Morrissey reveals the crew came up with some novel solutions. </p>

<p>'One of the costume department turned old electric paint-strippers into fans, which you operated like hairdryers. We all fought over those! It was uncomfortable, but it gave us a taste of what it would have been like for the Brits in colonial Singapore.'</p>

<p>'Britain's befuddled military leadership transitioned from complacency to panic with no intervening stage of common sense, which meant that the colony was poised for an inevitable debacle.'</p>

<p>Even somebody as worldly wise as Walter Blackett – a fictional character, like all the civilians in the drama – seems oblivious to what's about to happen as he enjoys the trappings of his success. </p>

<p>He organises a lavish birthday party for Mr Webb in episode one in scenes that could have come straight out of Downton Abbey, with the party held on the manicured lawn of his magnificent mansion.</p>

<p>The party is not to everybody's liking, not least the man it's been thrown for. </p>

<p>'Webb would rather observe from the sidelines than be the centre of attention,' explains Charles Dance. 'He hates sitting on show like some prize animal.'</p>

<p>As the guests sip Champagne and a band plays in the background, the sky darkens and the trumpets compete for attention with rumbles of thunder, the prelude to a tropical downpour. </p>

<p>It's a meteorological metaphor for the vicious storm the Japanese are about to inflict on the Brits.</p>

<p>The invasion begins with an aerial attack on the Singapore docks by the Japanese, a blitz that leaves hundreds of buildings on fire. </p>

<p>These scenes were filmed at an abandoned town an hour outside Kuala Lumpur. </p>

<p>'It was perfect,' explains director Tom Vaughan. </p>

<p>'We were able to set fire to buildings and incorporate them into the story.'</p>

<p>The Japanese then invade with boots on the ground from the north, and the drama takes a much darker turn. </p>

<p>The Battle of Slim River, a decisive victory for the Japanese, was re-created south of Kuala Lumpur. </p>

<p>Among the props was a fully functioning replica Ha-Go 95 Japanese tank, constructed by production designer Rob Harris and his team. </p>

<p>Eagle-eyed viewers will also spot anti-aircraft guns and 25lb field guns, which were either borrowed from the Malaysian Army or left behind by British and Australian soldiers.</p>

<p>Also re-created later in the series – although it's not in JG Farrell's book – is the Japanese assault on the Alexandra Hospital in Singapore. </p>

<p>'Hundreds of people were massacred including doctors, nurses and British soldiers recovering from injuries, and thousands were taken prisoner,' says Christopher. </p>

<p>'It was a brutal massacre, and I thought it important to include as we wouldn't otherwise have been conveying enough of the menace and the terror of the Japanese invaders.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, amid all the carnage, a love triangle develops between Joan Blackett, Matthew Webb and Vera Chiang, with Joan pursuing Matthew for all she's worth. </p>

<p>Colm Meany (pictuered) also stars, as Major Archer, the associate of Charles Dance's character Mr Webb</p>

<p>'Walter thinks that if Joan can make Matthew like her then they can marry and combine the two families of the firm,' says Luke Treadaway, who plays Matthew.</p>

<p>'They think it will be pretty easy, that one evening will be enough. They almost assume the wedding is on. But perhaps Matthew is more taken by Vera...'.</p>

<p>And Georgia Blizzard, who plays Joan, thinks viewers may be on Vera's side. 'Because Joan is so manipulative, I suspect viewers will be Team Vera. </p>

<p>'But I'm definitely Team Joan! She's strong and intelligent and ruthless in a positive way, and the product of two parents keen to see her married off well. </p>

<p>Walter seems oblivious to what is about to happen, even though he is worldly wise</p>

<p>The Blacketts' scheming daughter Joan is played by Georgia Blizzard, while Luke Newberry plays Monty Webb </p>

<p>'I admire her, even if I sometimes didn't feel as glamorous as I needed to. I was very lucky that between takes people would dab me and powder me when I wasn't feeling as fancy as Joan was on paper. </p>

<p>'Christopher's directions that said, "Joan sweeps into the room looking dazzling" put a bit of pressure on me!'</p>

<p>For David Morrissey and Jane Horrocks, who worked together on the 2000 movie Born Romantic, the show was a lovely reunion. </p>

<p>'Our characters had to salsa dance and had a sexy bedroom scene in Born Romantic,' remembers Jane. </p>

<p>'We do have several bedroom scenes here but they're not sexual. It's just the two of us lying together – I suspect Sylvia probably suffers from migraines!'</p>

<p>The Singapore Grip comes to ITV later this month.</p>
