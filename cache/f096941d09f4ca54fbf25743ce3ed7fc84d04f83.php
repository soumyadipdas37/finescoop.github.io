<p>The country queen, 88, said she and the Bawitdaba singer, 49, 'always teased about getting ourselves married' so when they had the chance during Loretta's son Ernie's vow renewal ceremony, they went for it.</p>

<p>Kid - real name Robert James Ritchie - got down on one knee and popped a ring on the songstress' finger, delighting friends, family and fans.</p>

<p>But of course it was all a joke for the Coal Miner's Daughter, who later took to Facebook to tell fans: 'Well, it didn’t last long, y’all but it sure was fun!'</p>

<p>Opposites attract! Loretta Lynn and Kid Rock may seen like an odd couple, but they were happy to get faux hitched during her son's vow renewal this weekend</p>

<p>In Loretta's first Facebook post she celebrated son Ernie and daughter-in-law Crystal for getting their vows renewed, telling fans: 'It was beautiful and everything it should be.</p>

<p>'Marriage isn't always easy--heck it's not even always pretty, but love holds you together and you push through the bad days to enjoy the good ones. I'm so proud of them and wish them years of happiness.'</p>

<p>Then, she said 'things got crazy' with her friend Kid Rock.</p>

<p>'We've always teased about getting ourselves married,' the Don’t Come Home A Drinkin" (With Lovin' On Your Mind) singer joked. 'Well, the preacher was already there so we had some fun with it.'</p>

<p>Put a ring on it! Kid - real name Robert James Ritchie - got down on one knee and popped a ring on the songstress' finger, delighting friends, family and fans</p>

<p>She ended on a cheeky note, saying: 'Sorry girls, he's taken now!' and adding the tags #gottahavesomefun #88andfeelinggreat #laugh #tabloidfodder and #cougar.</p>

<p>Lynn couldn't keep the joke up for long though, taking to social media the following day to fess up. </p>

<p>Loretta knows a thing of two about making marriage work. The talent was married to Doolittle 'Mooney' Lynn for nearly five decades until his death in 1996. The couple had six children together.</p>

<p>Fine! Lynn couldn't keep the joke up for long though, taking to social media the following day to fess up</p>

<p>Til death do us part: Loretta knows a thing of two about making marriage work. The talent was married to Doolittle 'Mooney' Lynn for nearly five decades until his death in 1996, despite his cheating and drinking. They're seen in 1980 together above</p>

<p>But it was a tumultuous union due in large part to Doolittle's heavy drinking and persistent cheating.</p>

<p>Still, Loretta looked back fondly at their union in her 2002 memoir, writing: 'I married Doo when I wasn't but a child, and he was my life from that day on. But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo.</p>

<p>'He thought I was something special, more special than anyone else in the world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through.'</p>

<p>Kid Rock's experiences with marriage have been a bit different. The Cowboy singer had an on/off relationship with Pamela Anderson during the 2000s, which lead to a 17 day marriage in 2006. He has an adult son from a previous relationship.</p>

<p>Short and sweet: Kid Rock had an on/off relationship with Pamela Anderson during the 2000s, which lead to a 17 day marriage in 2006. They're seen in 2006 above</p>
