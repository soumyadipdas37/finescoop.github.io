<p>'I'm really big on routine and structure so that Aleeia has routine. She goes to school Monday to Friday and is here with us as a family and then Jodi has her on the weekends,' Braith said.</p>

<p>After quitting Neighbours, Jodi now gets to spend time with Aleeia more often during the week because she is based in the same city as her former spouse.</p>

<p>'[Aleeia] can see her whenever she likes. She probably sees her a bit more and can just go hang out - that's the advantage of being in Sydney,' Braith explained.</p>

<p>Although wedding planning has been postponed because of the pandemic, Braith said he and Rachael were not in a rush to tie the knot.</p>

<p>'We can't wait to get married, but we are pretty open to when that happens, so we're just going to take our time,' he said.</p>
