<p>Casual: Stacey Dooley, 33, opted for a laid back look as she went on a shopping trip in West London on Tuesday</p>

<p>The former Strictly Come Dancing winner also sported a pair of black flip flops and carried a matching handbag.</p>

<p>The star tucked a pair of sunglasses into her jumper and added to her outfit with a pair of gold earrings.</p>

<p>Letting her locks fall loose down her shoulders, Stacey put safety first by wearing a face mask. </p>

<p>It comes after Stacey was said to be in the running to host a new morning show on the BBC that will be similar to The One Show, with Rylan Clark-Neal also said to be a contender. </p>

<p>Starting at 9.15am, the new show is expected to challenge ITV's mid-morning stars Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, as well as seeking to attract viewers from Lorraine Kelly's hour-long show that runs from 9am.</p>

<p>BBC executives hope the programme will also retain viewers from the Breakfast show, which draws an estimated nine million each week.</p>

<p>A source close to the project said: 'BBC Breakfast beats Good Morning Britain every day and The One Show is one of the channel's most loved and popular programmes, so the concept is based on that.</p>

<p>'The thinking is that if they can put a daytime version of the show on straight after BBC Breakfast, they'll keep some of those viewers, and will follow the same formula as The One Show but with segments tailored to a new daytime audience.</p>

<p>'Everyone at the BBC is very excited about this. They know that this could be quite the rival for This Morning, for the first time ever.'</p>

<p>BBC bosses have spent the past six weeks meeting with behind-the-scenes staff to put the show together, with Stacey – who has a £200,000 contract with the BBC – favourite to be one of the hosts. </p>

<p>Others in the frame to front the new show include Gethin Jones, Ore Oduba, Angellica Bell and former Coronation Street actress Kym Marsh.</p>

<p>But while all have been stand-ins on The One Show, Stacey, 35, is thought to be among the frontrunners.</p>

<p>A source close to her said: 'She is a great favourite of the BBC, she has so many offers on the table at the moment that nothing should be ruled out.</p>

<p>Contenders: Stacey was said to be in the running to host a new morning show on the BBC that will be similar to The One Show, with Rylan Clark-Neal also said to be a contender</p>

<p>'She would be perfect for this new programme, she's clever and very, very likeable. She has very much become a household name.'</p>

<p>Commenting on the new daytime show, a BBC source said: 'The mix of content aims to both entertain and inform viewers, providing great company and trusted expertise.'</p>

<p>Carla-Maria Lawson, Head of BBC Daytime &amp; Early Peak, added: 'Following the success of shows such as HealthCheck UK Live, Daily Kitchen Live and Your Money and Your Life with a mix of good company and expert advice reflecting their concerns, we're excited to be bringing a new daily, topical live programme to BBC1 at 9.15 following BBC Breakfast, and look forward to sharing more details soon.'</p>

<p>Competition: The show is set to rival ITV's This Morning, hosted by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield </p>
