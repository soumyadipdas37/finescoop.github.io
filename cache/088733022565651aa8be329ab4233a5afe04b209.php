<p>Jon was sent through to the final by the BGT judging panel after impressing them with his witty but touching song about his own childhood.  </p>

<p>Jon was joined in the top three with singer Belinda Edwards and magician Jasper Cherry, while the rest of the contestants' fate was in the hands of the public to gain the second remaining place.</p>

<p>Congrats! Golden Buzzer act Jon Courtenay, 46, is the seventh contestant to make it through to this year's Britain's Got Talent finale</p>

<p>David said the act that 'got him' was Jon as he cast his vote for him, while Amanda admitted all three should be in the final but picked Belinda.</p>

<p>Ashley also voted for Jon and said: 'In terms of quality, you three could be the final three. In terms of originality, that act for me is Jon. </p>

<p>Casting the deciding vote, Amanda said she was going with her heart and also voting for Jon.</p>

<p>When asked about his reaction to getting through, Jon joked: I'm only on this because I want to play the [London] Palladium! It wasn't meant to get this far.'</p>

<p>'Now I'm going to have to write something else! I'm thinking maybe a love song to my favourite television duo, Holly and Phil.'</p>

<p>'It sounds so flippant to say I wasn't expecting it but I wasn't. The stuff you said at the end of my song blew me away. </p>

<p>During the performance, the joker unlocked his piano with an electronic car key and told the audiences: 'Amazing to be here, I sung a song about being a dad, tonight I want to take you further to when I was a kid.'</p>

<p>Jon received a standing ovation from the judges and audience following his electrifying performance with Amanda Holden declaring he could win the whole show.</p>

<p>Ashley said: 'We need another golden buzzer! To press it right now. There's an incredible connection you have, it's funny and touching. I couldn't fault it.'</p>

<p>'It was magical and done so simply. It made me feel so warm inside. You nailed it my friend.'</p>

<p>Well done: Jon was sent through to the final by the BGT judging panel after impressing them with his witty but touching song about his own childhood</p>

<p>During the performance, the joker unlocked his piano with an electronic car key and told the audiences: 'Amazing to be here, I sung a song about being a dad, tonight I want to take you further to when I was a kid'</p>

<p>While a tearful Amanda gushed: 'I'm treating this show like therapy, I just cry all the time! One of the best golden buzzers we've ever had on the show. After the year we've had you'd be an amazing winner.</p>

<p>Ashley said to Ant and Dec: 'You two are looking so smug!'</p>

<p>While the hosts, who pressed the golden buzzer for Jon, said: 'Proud actually.'</p>

<p>David told them: 'We may be looking at the winner of this year's show. You have set the bar, that was unbelievable.'</p>

<p>Ant and Dec asked him: 'The wait for the semi-final must have been torturous?'</p>

<p>While the comedian quipped: 'You didn't phone or write, it was like a one night stand.' </p>

<p>Banter Ashley said to Ant and Dec: 'You two are looking so smug!' While the hosts, who pressed the golden buzzer for Jon, said: 'Proud actually'</p>

<p>Opening the show, contemporary dance act, Billy and Chantelle aged 14 and 11 from Birmingham, wowed the judges with their Greatest Showman-inspired routine.</p>

<p>Despite having to rehearse separately due to coronavirus restrictions, the duo still managed to blow the judges away with their abilities.</p>

<p>David told the dance act: 'You started the show with a bang - that was incredible! Didn't expect that at all.'</p>

<p>David told the dance act: 'You started the show with a bang - that was incredible! Didn't expect that at all'</p>

<p>While Alesha added: 'We can see that you're best friends and you've worked so hard. The whole thing was perfection. Thanks for upping your game.'</p>

<p>'I thought it was fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything more. You did something really original.'</p>

<p>While Alesha added: 'We can see that you're best friends and you've worked so hard. The whole thing was perfection. Thanks for upping your game.' </p>

<p>Next up was Chineke! Junior Orchestra, who are aged between 11 and 22.  </p>

<p>The young orchestra performed a medley of classical and modern songs, including Clean Bandit's Rather Be.</p>

<p>Killing it: Despite having to rehearse separately due to coronavirus restrictions, the duo still managed to blow the judges away with their abilities</p>

<p>Alesha said: 'I loved it from start to finish, in the middle were the contemporary songs... you will change the way people look at this music.'</p>

<p>While Amanda, added: 'Not only did it sound good, with your friends behind you it sounded absolutely epic. Far better than your audition which was wonderful.'</p>

<p>Ashley said: 'It should be jarring but the transitions are so seamless. The whole panel was vibing, a classical orchestra making me bop my head - I love it!'</p>

<p>Powerful: Next up was Chineke! Junior Orchestra, who are aged between 11 and 22</p>

<p>Impressive: The young orchestra performed a medley of classical and modern songs, including Clean Bandit's Rather Be</p>

<p>After making several attempts at success on Britain's Got Talent, Katherine and Joe O'Malley were back with their Disney act to perform to Into the Unknown' from Frozen 2.</p>

<p>Despite belting out the track to the best of their ability they received a red buzzer from Alesha, who was left unimpressed by their efforts.</p>

<p>Alesha demanded: 'Bring back the crab! I was willing Olaf down because last time we saw you, you were going crazy which was so funny, but you didn't do that tonight.'</p>

<p>Loving it: Ashley said: 'It should be jarring but the transitions are so seamless. The whole panel was vibing, a classical orchestra making me bop my head - I love it!'</p>

<p>While Amanda, added: 'Not only did it sound good, with your friends behind you it sounded absolutely epic. Far better than your audition which was wonderful'</p>

<p>Amanda: It's my favourite ever film, Elsa you have a good voice - Olaf let you town. I know you're married... but I don't know if you should consider going solo after tonight.'</p>

<p>Offering a possible explanation for the judges' negative comments, Katherine said that part of her husband's tap shoe fell off during the routine.</p>

<p>Next to try and impress the judges was Kevin Quantum, whose routine uses science and magic.</p>

<p>Let it go! After making several attempts at success on Britain's Got Talent, Katherine and Joe O'Malley were back with their Disney act to perform to Into the Unknown' from Frozen 2</p>

<p>Oops: Offering a possible explanation for the judges' negative comments, Katherine said that part of her husband's tap shoe fell off during the routine</p>

<p>Not for me:  Despite belting out the track to the best of their ability they received a red buzzer from Alesha, who was left unimpressed by their efforts</p>

<p>Despite the current climate, the performer encouraged the judges to get involved in the act and touch each other's fingers, as he demonstrated the use of static charge.</p>

<p>During the act, Kevin asked Ant to touch his hand, and later asked all of the judges to touch fingers as he acted out the routine.</p>

<p>Although he appeared to break social distancing guidelines, the judges focus was drawn to the level of performance, which they appeared unimpressed by.</p>

<p>Ashley: 'I can see how much prep and time and thought has gone into it. The performance felt like one long build up without the pay off. I feel this just fell short.</p>

<p>'I think being part of it is often distracting, because we can't watch it.'</p>

<p>Science whizz! Next to try and impress the judges was Kevin Quantum, whose routine uses science and magic</p>

<p>Amanda: 'I loved watching Johnny Ball when I was little, and you gave me the same feeling!'  </p>

<p>Hoping to leave the judges amazed, Jasper Cherry, 14, used mobile phones in his magic trick in the hope of making it through to the next round.</p>

<p>Jasper incredibly made one phone ring the other while placed down on the judges panel away from anyone's hands.</p>

<p>Huh? Despite the current climate, the performer encouraged the judges to get involved in the act and touch each other's fingers, as he demonstrated the use of static charge</p>

<p>What's going on? During the act, Kevin asked Ant to touch his hand, and later asked all of the judges to touch fingers as he acted out the routine</p>

<p>Not amazed: Although he appeared to break social distancing guidelines, the judges focus was drawn to the level of performance, which they appeared unimpressed by</p>

<p>You are unreal! Confidence in abundance. I've never felt so relaxed. I don't want to sound patronising but you're so young.</p>

<p>That trick was phenomenal! I can't work it out and I applaud you.</p>

<p>I don't know what's going on, I like to think I'm quite aware but I had no idea what was happening. It was such a high level and so well executed. </p>

<p>'You have magical powers, you need to go and live alone on an island.'</p>

<p>Papi Flex, 26, was unable to attend the semi-final in person, and as if his performance wasn't already unnerving enough, this time he performed in a graveyard.</p>

<p>David looked uncomfortable throughout the act and asked why Papi had to make the act even scarier by performing in a graveyard.</p>

<p>The final act of the next fighting for a place in the final was singer Belinda Davids, 43, who sang Whitney Houston's I Have Nothing. </p>

<p>The singer also received a standing ovation from the judging panel, with Ashley saying: 'I was asked what is needed to win, and I said you just need to hit me. And that hit me.;</p>

<p>While David joked: 'Yeah it was alright. I'm joking, it was absolutely electric from start to finish.'</p>

<p>'Such an incredible way to carry on her [Whitney's] legacy. You honoured her in the best way.' </p>
