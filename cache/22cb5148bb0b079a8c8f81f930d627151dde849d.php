<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If Thomas Frank’s casual get-up and depleted bench suggested the Carabao Cup is an afterthought for Brentford, this performance proved these Bees still harbour dreams of another unlikely trip to Wembley.</p>

<p>Injuries and a positive coronavirus test meant Frank – in polo shirt and shorts – named only five substitutes for this clash at St Mary’s.</p>

<p>But the 16 who made the trip still had too much for a full-strength Southampton, whose new campaign has begun with successive defeats.</p>

<p>Josh Dasilva doubled the advantage for Brentford as they saw off the Premier League side</p>

<p>Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl watched a full strength team lose at home </p>

<p>Nathan Redmond suffered a serious looking injury and was forced to come off </p>

<p>Christian Norgaard celebrated the opening goal of the game with his Brentford team-mates</p>

<p>West Brom await Frank’s side in round three after first-half goals from Christian Norgaard and Josh Dasilva on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>The Baggies pipped Brentford to promotion so a trip to the Hawthorns offers a chance at revenge of sorts.</p>

<p>For Southampton, no such mercies.</p>

<p>Norgaard headed in during the first half as Thomas Frank's side set about their work well </p>

<p>Danny Ings went close for his side but the former Liverpool man found himself frustrated</p>

<p>Thomas Frank cut a casual figure on the touchline but his team played with plenty of panache</p>

<p>Danny Ings, Che Adams and Jack Stephens all went close but Brentford had chances too before Norgaard headed home his first Bees goal.</p>

<p>Their lead should have doubled when Bryan Mbeumo raced clear and beyond the onrushing Alex McCarthy, only to be denied by Ryan Bertrand.</p>

<p>There was, however, nothing Saints could do to stem the pinball move which culminated in Dasilva firing home from the edge of the box.</p>

<p>And nothing Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side could do thereafter to turn the tide.      </p>

<p>Southampton are out of the Carabao Cup and Brentford have advanced to the next round</p>
