<p>'I wouldn’t have change it for the world as I have totally made life long friendships out of the show,' she continued.</p>

<p>'MAFS has taught me one thing, never try to convince somebody of your worth. If a person doesn’t appreciate you they do not deserve you. Love yourself and always listen to your gut instinct because it’s always right.'</p>

<p>The bawdy blonde was memorably rejected by Sean on Married At First Sight after he failed to feel chemistry with her on their wedding day.</p>

<p>A second photo showed Jo proudly standing face-forward in front of the mirror, a hand confidently placed on one hip.</p>

<p>'I'm absolutely loving my body transformation. #sogreatful [sic] #bodypositive,' she captioned the photo.</p>

<p>Jo also tagged All Covered Beauty in her post, thanking them for assisting her with her transformation.</p>

<p>According to their Instagram bio, they specialise in MM Slim, a magnetic muscle stimulator, which assists with muscle gain, fat loss and body shaping. </p>

<p>In a post on Instagram in April, Jo spoke about her weight loss, crediting a ketogenic diet and strict exercise regimen with helping her to drop the kilos.</p>

<p>Way back when: The single mother had a much fuller figure before her weight loss. (Pictured in 2018)</p>

<p>She revealed she had lost over 20 kilos.</p>

<p>'I don't give a toss about what people think I look like, I am just me. Love me or hate me, I'm just me,' she said at the time.</p>

<p>'I have been dedicated, strict and everything mentally I wanted to be. That's how I'm achieving my goals.</p>

<p>'No surgery, no major story to it. It's been bloody hard work, mentally and emotionally.'</p>

<p>'Body positive!' The star has been showing off her incredible slim down on social media over the last few months. (Pictured in July)</p>

<p>Jo said she was motivated by her children to change her lifestyle, and revealed she walks for 90 minutes a day.</p>

<p>'Every single day I want a certain food, but I look at my two beautiful children and I want a better quality of life for everybody,' she explained.</p>

<p>'I've stopped junk food, all of my carbs and the majority of alcohol. It's a lifestyle change. I've been blessed with losing weight, but maintaining it is the hard part.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I was my own worst enemy. When I stopped and looked in the mirror, I mean really looked in the mirror, and said, "stop being so harsh on yourself, you are gorgeous inside and out", that was the day that changed my life forever.'</p>

<p>'I've stopped the soft drinks': Jo has said that cutting out junk food and sugary beverages helped her shed several dress sizes</p>
