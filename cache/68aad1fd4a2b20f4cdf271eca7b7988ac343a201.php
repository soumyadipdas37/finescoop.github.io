<p>The federal government's National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation is forecasting a 0.8 per cent population decline over two years.</p>

<p>In the absence of immigration, Australia's population was expected to fall by 214,000 between a peak in 2019 and a trough in 2021.</p>

<p>Half of that was attributed to the drop-off in international students, following the closure of Australia's national border in March.</p>

<p>'Immigration cuts have flow-on effects on population growth – temporary (international students) immigrants are the main driver of population growth,' the NHFIC report said.</p>

<p>Australia's immigration pause would spark the steepest population decrease since World War I, shortly before the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 reached Australian shores.</p>

<p>Only the unwinding of the long post-war baby boom in 1971 saw a comparably steep population decline. </p>

<p>In the year to June 2019, Australia had a net annual immigration rate of 239,600 when the number of people leaving was subtracted from the tally of new arrivals.</p>

<p>The population increase of 1.4 per cent was among the highest in the developed world and well above the OECD average of 0.8 per cent.</p>

<p>A declining population also has implications for property prices, with the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation predicting a possible shortfall 232,000 shorfall in demand for new private dwellings by 2023.</p>

<p>The forecast population decline, as a result of coronavirus measures, has also worried the Reserve Bank of Australia which last month released a paper which said a 40 per cent plunge in house prices was an 'extreme but plausible scenario'.

<p>The RBA report on debt levels said Australia could experience a house price bubble similar to what occurred in United States, Spain and Ireland after the Global Financial Crisis.</p>

<p>The NHFIC is in charge of the government's $500million First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, where first home buyers can secure a mortgage with a five per cent deposit with taxpayers underwriting the rest of the 20 per cent deposit.</p>

<p>Should new home buyers struggle to pay off their loan and be forced to sell en masse, the federal government would be left holding equity in assets worth a lot less.</p>

<p>A population decrease would most likely cause house prices to fall, as capital growth worried sparked a sell-off among investors.</p>
