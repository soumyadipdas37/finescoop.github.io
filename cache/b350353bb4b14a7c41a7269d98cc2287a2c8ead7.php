<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The ATO have released an unnerving recording of a sophisticated tax scam targeting vulnerable Australians.</p>

<p>The chilling audio features a computer generated voice aimed at insecure Aussies so scammers can prey on their hard earned cash.</p>

<p>'Your account has been marked delinquent on account of tax avoidance,' the robo call recording says.</p>

<p>'As our letters sent to your registered address have also returned unsigned, and undelivered, resulting into a petition note to be filed against your name, including a warrant for your arrest'.</p>

<p>Australian Communications and Media Authority Member Fiona Cameron issued a public warning to beware of questionable activity amid their private affairs.</p>

<p>The ATO have warned the Australian public about several sophisticated scams going around at tax time (stock image)</p>

<p>'It is tax time, and unfortunately scammers are about,' she told Today. 'This scam is pretty disgraceful.'</p>

<p>Ms Cameron said as many as 100 people could fall victim to the heartless fraudsters. </p>

<p>'Your life savings can go or alternatively your identity can be stolen,' she said.</p>

<p>'And once your identity is stolen, then the scammer can go on and scam someone else in your name which is an appalling cycle of abuse.'</p>

<p>Scams are large-scale operations, with detectives forced to use complex software to find out where the calls come from.</p>

<p>Ms Cameron said Australians are more vulnerable to fraudulent activity due to being at home and connected during the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Australian Communications and Media Authority Member Fiona Cameron (pictured) said the public must beware of odd activity with their affairs</p>

<p>She said scammers often release threats like these during tax time, as fraudsters try to con people based on their needs.</p>

<p>'Often in relation to the ATO-type scams they pressure you,' Ms Cameron said.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Send you an email or text message asking you to send us your information by email or text message.</p></li>
<li><p>Send you an email or text message with a link to log into online services.</p></li>
<li><p>Send a pre-recorded message saying the police are coming to arrest you or demanding urgent payment of money.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for payment by bank transfers to:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A bank that is not the Reserve Bank of Australia  </p>

<p>Overseas wire transfers;</p>

<p>iTunes or Google Play cards; </p>

<p>Cardless cash transfers;</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. </p>

<p>Source: ATO</p>

<p>'They say that they are going to arrest you and say that they will go to Federal Court if you don't pay and independent interest will compound.'</p>

<p>Ms Cameron said Australians must be cautious with their data online.</p>

<p>'If you are not sure hang up. These people are out to get your money or your identity,' she said.</p>

<p>Australians were scammed out of more than $11million in May this year thanks to a plague of fake money-making schemes. </p>

<p>Online phishing scams received the most reports in May, with households losing $185,000 combined, up 190 per cent from April.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from The Australian Tax Office said the body is concerned about the increasing number of people paying fake tax debt scammers.</p>

<p>'Scammers pretending to be from the ATO are contacting members of the community, telling them that they have a tax debt and that if they don't pay it straight away they will be arrested,' they said.</p>

<p>'These scammers will often request payment through unusual methods, such as cryptocurrency, pre-paid credit cards or gift cards, and will try to keep people on the line until they have paid.'</p>

<p>They urged anyone who received a phone call, text message or voicemail demanding money not to send a payment or provide personal information.  </p>

<p>'We will never threaten you with immediate arrest or demand payment through unusual means.'</p>
