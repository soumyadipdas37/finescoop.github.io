<p>Ben Wallace was scheduled to fly to the Middle East this week but his £150million RAF Voyager air transporter broke down.</p>

<p>He was then given a plane meant to fly 200 Fusiliers to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire after their peace-keeping tour of Estonia. </p>

<p>It meant that the troops got home on Tuesday, a day later than planned, with relatives furious at the delay.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace was not made aware of the original plans for the plane and defence sources said he would have prioritised the troops had he known.</p>

<p>A military source said: ‘He is livid this decision was made on his behalf and he would never have done this on purpose.’ </p>

<p>The unnamed partner of one soldier said she was heartbroken by the 28-hour delay.</p>

<p>She said: ‘The Defence Secretary’s flight broke down in Estonia and he took their flight because he needed a private plane. They’re angry and upset. No one can believe it. </p>

<p>'I’m sure other people have children who thought their dads were coming home. It’s so selfish.’  </p>

<p>The RAF said another plane had since returned the remaining troops and that the Defence Secretary was not aware of the other taskings.</p>

<p>An RAF spokesman said: ‘On Monday a technical fault with an RAF aircraft regretfully delayed the return of some UK service personnel from operations in Estonia.</p>

<p>‘The prioritisation of aircraft is an operational level decision and the Secretary of State was not made aware of other taskings. Another plane has since returned the remaining troops.’</p>
