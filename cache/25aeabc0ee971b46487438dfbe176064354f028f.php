<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nine people charged with misdemeanor trespassing after a racial injustice protest in a private St. Louis neighborhood in June will not be prosecuted, city officials said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who live in the neighborhood, confronted the demonstrators with guns and have been charged with unlawful use of a weapon, a felony.</p>

<p>The nine protesters were issued citations earlier this month.</p>

<p>Several hundred demonstrators on June 28 veered onto the private street where the McCloskey's Renaissance palazzo-style mansion sits</p>

<p>Patricia McCloskey and her husband Mark McCloskey drew their firearms on protestors, including a man who held a video camera and microphone, as they entered their neighborhood during a protest against St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson</p>

<p>It wasn't clear why just nine of the estimated 300 protesters were issued summonses. </p>

<p>Deputy City Counselor Michael Garvin said in a statement on Tuesday that the prosecution of the trespassing charges 'is not warranted'.</p>

<p>"After consideration of all factors, the city counselor determined that prosecution is not warranted against these particular individuals. Having reached that conclusion, all charges were refused,' Garvin said.</p>

<p>Municipal court prosecutors reviewed video, conducted interviews and examined property records of the incident. </p>

<p>Gardner said residents who are trustees of the neighborhood, Portland Place, did not want to pursue trespassing charges. </p>

<p>Patricia McCloskey described how protesters 'broke an iron fence down' before 'trying to set fire to the mayor's house'</p>

<p>Protesters gathered outside the home of Mark and Patricia McCloskey during a protest against racial inequality in St Louis, Missouri</p>

<p>Protester Ohun Ashe suggested in a tweet earlier this months that the trespassing summonses were not warranted. The charges have since been dropped</p>

<p>The couple made headlines when Mark McCloskey was seen armed with an AR-15 rifle and his wife with a semiautomatic handgun during a confrontation with marchers passing by their home. </p>

<p>Marchers were using the street to get to the house of Mayor Lyda Krewson. </p>

<p>The McCloskeys, who were armed with an AR-15 rifle and semiautomatic handgun, have become national figures for conservative Republicans and gun rights advocates since the confrontation and gave an opening night speech during last month's Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>Their lawyer, Joel Schwartz, said Tuesday that the demonstrators were clearly trespassing and the McCloskeys 'were clearly within their rights to do what they did.'</p>

<p>President Donald Trump and Missouri Governor Mike Parson criticized the charges against the McCloskeys. </p>

<p>Parson has said he will pardon the couple if they are convicted.</p>
