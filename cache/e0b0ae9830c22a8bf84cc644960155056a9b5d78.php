<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Private equity barons at KKR are sniffing around BT.</p>

<p>The US giant is said to be monitoring developments at the troubled telecoms company, which has seen its share price almost half this year, and is now valued at just £10.4billion.</p>

<p>The slump in shares at BT has put it on the radar of a number of suitors looking to snap up bargains in the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>BT chairman Jan du Plessis and chief executive Philip Jansen (pictured) had already hired advisers at Goldman Sachs to draw up a defence strategy, but this has not dampened interest</p>

<p>Interest from KKR, one of America’s oldest private equity firms known for its shrewdness and ruthless cost-cutting abilities, will cause alarm in the BT boardroom, the City and Westminster.</p>

<p>While BT shares are languishing around decade lows, the company is the middle of a major upgrade of Britain’s broadband network, a critical part of national infrastructure.</p>

<p>BT chairman Jan du Plessis and chief executive Philip Jansen had already hired advisers at Goldman Sachs to draw up a defence strategy. But this has not dampened interest from potential bidders, with KKR among those looking at the firm, according to the Financial Times.</p>

<p>Despite its poor financial performance, analysts believe BT could be valuable in the right hands. </p>

<p>Openreach, the division of BT which owns and manages its broadband network, is thought to be worth around £20billion alone – double the value of its parent on the stock market. </p>

<p>This raises the prospect that any buyer, including KKR, could break up BT and sell its parts.</p>

<p>There would be obstacles for any potential buyer of BT – not least the company’s huge pension scheme deficit, as owners could face demands to plug the estimated £9billion gap.</p>

<p>Other potential buyers are thought to include BT shareholder Deutsche Telekom, while Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has been building a stake in BT this year.</p>
