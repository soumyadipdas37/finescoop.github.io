<p>Germany boss Joachim Low is worried about his squad's fitness ahead of clash with Spain</p>

<p>He believes the players will struggle to see out the full 90 minutes in the Nations League game</p>

<p>'The situation we have is that there are a lot of differences between players,' he said, as reported by BBC Sport.</p>

<p>'Some have been training for weeks but have no match practice, others have just finished playing.'</p>

<p>'Others are just back from holidays that were short. I don't think players will last over 90 minutes at a high pace,' he added.</p>

<p>Low had to leave out Bayern and Leipzig stars while others have just returned from holiday</p>

<p>Leroy Sane is the only Bayern player to be included in his 24-man squad having just joined the club from Manchester City. Low can also count on forward Timo Werner, who missed Leipzig's Champions League run to seal his move to Chelsea.</p>

<p>His Spain counterpart Enrique agreed that the demanding fixture list has been tough to deal with, but he says that hasn't stopped his team working hard in training.  </p>

<p>'The added difficulty has been the calendar, but it is the same for everyone, also for Low,' he added.</p>

<p>Spain coach Luis Enrique says he is pleased with training levels despite ahead of a tough run-in</p>

<p>'You have to see each player in particular, and even so the pace of training has been very high. But I'm not complaining, I love playing the Nations League and I love playing with the national team.</p>

<p>'These are the official dates and you have to accept it.'</p>

<p>Germany were relegated from their League A group in last season's competition, but have been given another chance after a revamp to the set-up. Along with Spain, they will also face Switzerland and Ukraine. </p>
