<p>Australian medical student Ricky Rosen (pictured), who is from Sydney, has become a rising TikTok star thanks to his incredible vocals and quirky accent challenge</p>

<p>Ricky shared his first TikTok video on April 25, and has since attracted 330,000 followers and more than 3.7 million likes in the past six months.</p>

<p>In an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Ricky admitted he was never confident enough in his abilities to enter reality TV singing contests and had never really 'put [himself] out there' before launching his TikTok page.</p>

<p>'Realistically, I am at the beginning of whatever this journey is. I haven't had to put myself out there besides the last couple of months, and I've been fortunate with the response,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>His most viral video, a clip singing Bubbly by Colbie Caillat in five separate accents, has more than 4.2million views.</p>

<p>'I thought people might be interested in the video, but I really didn't expect the response it got. I personally didn't think they [the accents] were that good that people would actually like it. It was just something silly I'd do with friends and family to annoy them,' he joked.</p>

<p>Playing the piano since the age of three, Ricky said he's always been interested in music, but never actively pursued a career in it.</p>

<p>When the coronavirus pandemic hit, he decided to 'bite the bullet' and use his free time productively and creatively.</p>

<p>'I moved back in with my family amid COVID-19 and it was a break from what I was doing with my studies. I just had a bit of free time and it was something that I knew I should be pursuing and wanted to put out there,' he said, adding he's now found the perfect balance between his studies and TikTok.</p>
