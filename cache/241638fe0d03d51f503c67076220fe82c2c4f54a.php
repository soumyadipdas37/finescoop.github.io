<p>United value Smalling at £18million and are waiting for Roma to return with an improved offer.</p>

<p>The defender, 30, is training on his own twice a day at Carrington after coming back from a season on loan at the Italian club.</p>

<p>Chris Smalling is growing frustrated over the transfer negotiations between United and Roma</p>

<p>The defender has been training on his own twice a day at Carrington since returning from loan</p>

<p>The former England centre back believes United should be doing more to give him the move he wants. Smalling has been at Old Trafford since a £10m transfer from Fulham in 2010.</p>

<p>However, United are refusing to budge on their valuation at a time when they need to generate as much money as possible to finance new signings.</p>

<p>Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer must sell a defender before he can buy a new one, as United haggle with Porto over left back Alex Telles, who has a £36.6m release clause in his contract.</p>

<p>Marcos Rojo is following a similar training regime to Smalling, with United willing to listen to offers for the Argentina centre back, as well as for goalkeeper Sergio Romero and midfielder Andreas Pereira. </p>
