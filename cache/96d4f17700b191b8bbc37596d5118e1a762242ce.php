<p>The past 12 months have seen the unbeaten Adesanya (20-0) establish himself as one of the most popular – and marketable – athletes on the planet</p>

<p>'Flew back to Las Vegas with the still undisputed king of the middleweights and you won't be at all surprised to learn that Israel Adesanya gave his first-class seat to one of his cornermen. Total package, that guy,' Anik posted to Twitter.</p>

<p>Known as The Last Stylebender, his close-knit City Kickboxing team - headed up by Auckland combat sports legend Eugene Bareman - has made a name for itself as one of the best MMA gyms in the world. </p>

<p>There are currently two UFC champions within it's ranks - the other being Australian featherweight Alexander Volkanovski. </p>

<p>But although the Nigerian-born Kiwi's TKO victory was emphatic, there was some controversy. </p>

<p>Adesanya appeared to 'hump' his bitter rival's back immediately after referee Jason Herzog called a stop to the contest. </p>

<p>He then followed up by launching an angry tirade aimed at Costa's cornermen. </p>

<p>'I wrap my d*** around my waist it's a black belt, motherf*****' Adesanya said, in in relation to pre-fight comments from Costa who labelled him white belt.</p>

<p>Since the bout, Costa has blasted the star striker for his post-fight antics.      </p>

<p>'I come here to talk about the actions that the human trash did after our fight,' Costa said in a video posted to his Instagram. </p>

<p>'I didn't see when I was there [in] the cage but I saw now. I disapprove 100 percent. To me, this is [personal] now. Nobody will stop me. Nobody can stop me.' </p>

<p>Adesanya replied by saying: 'I can stop you...again :) Dislike.' </p>

<p>The champion's next opponent remains a mystery, but Adesanya is adamant he wants to get back in the cage as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When asked on ESPN's MMA Show with Ariel Helwani if he will be ready to fight early next year, the champion scoffed at the thought of waiting so long.</p>

<p>'What? Don't be silly, I'm fresh. What?! Are you serious?' he said.</p>

<p>'This year, I want to fight this year. We talked a little a bit last night and I can't say much more but we've got some plans, I want to fight this year.</p>

<p>'I'm fresh. My foot only hurts from kicking his a***. But I can't tell you yet...' </p>

<p>The Last Stylebender (pictured) told the ESPN MMA Show that he is fresh and eager to fight soon</p>
