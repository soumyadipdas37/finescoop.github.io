<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She failed to find love once again on the latest season of Bachelor in Paradise.</p>

<p>But Brittney Weldon has shown no sign of heartache in recent months, and has even undergone a dramatic image overhaul as she continues her hunt for love.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 26-year-old looked almost unrecognisable as she posed next to a gal pal on Instagram.   </p>

<p>Who's that girl? Brittney Weldon, 26, (left) showed off her dramatic new look on Sunday when she uploaded this photo of herself posing next to a gal pal </p>

<p>Showcasing her prodigious cleavage in a plunging, bubblegum-pink playsuit, the reality star looked very different to her days in Paradise. </p>

<p>Gone were her famous brunette locks, replaced with a head of freshly-bleached blonde hair that was curled gently at the ends. </p>

<p>Brittney wore a heavy application of makeup, including dramatic eye shadow and a slick of pink lipstick on her decidedly plumper-looking lips.  </p>

<p>So different! Since her stint on the latest season of Bachelor In Paradise (left) , Brittney has bleached her hair from brunette to blonde, and debuted a much plumper-looking pout (right)</p>

<p>'Hey shawty,' she captioned the photo, presumably referring to her friend's petite stature. </p>

<p>Her new look comes after Brittney admitted she'd love to be considered as the next Bachelorette, following unsuccessful stints on both Bachelor in Paradise and The Bachelor.</p>

<p>She told Daily Mail Australia on Monday: 'Hello, so many choices! It would be so good! Like, just to have your pick instead of being like, pick me!</p>

<p>Next in line? Brittney has admitted she would 'absolutely' be open to being next year's Bachelorette</p>

<p>'Never say never': After stints on both Bachelor in Paradise and The Bachelor, Brittney said she was still open to finding love on reality TV</p>

<p>'Never say never. It just depends on what it was. I wouldn't really go on Bachelor in Paradise again without the chances of meeting someone,' she explained.</p>

<p>Brittney won sympathy from Bachelor in Paradise fans after revealing she had an unrequited crush on Jamie Doran, but she said they now have a 'good friendship'.</p>

<p>'I definitely wanted more from Jamie. But that's okay. We have a really good friendship now, and that's all that I can ask for,' she admitted.</p>

<p>'It's better than trying it out and then hating each other, so what we have now is great. We're friends for life.'</p>

<p>Just friends: Brittney won sympathy from Bachelor in Paradise fans after revealing she had an unrequited crush on Jamie Doran (right), but she said they now have a 'good friendship'</p>
