<p>Zoom is working properly following an outage that lasted for nearly eight hours Monday, leaving thousands unable to work and disrupted the first day of school for American students learning remotely </p>

<p>A zoom spokesperson told DailyMail.com in an email: 'We have resolved an issue that caused some users to be unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars or manage aspects of their account on the Zoom website. </p>

<p>'We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.'  </p>

<p>The issue appeared to have started Monday morning around 7am ET, with just a handful of users sharing problems on DownDector.</p>

<p>But two hours later, there were more than 14,000 reports.</p>

<p>he issues plagued parts of the US, with many major cities including including New York City, Washington DC and Philadelphia, along with Los Angeles and San Francisco </p>

<p>'We have received reports of users being unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars. We are currently investigating and will provide updates as we have them. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience,' the email from a Zoom spokesperson read this morning.</p>

<p>Zoom's status page showed the firm has identified the 'issue causing users to be unable to authenticate to the Zoom website (zoom.us) and unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars, and we are working on a fix for this issue.'</p>

<p>DownDetector highlighted the outage was plaguing mostly the northeast US, with major cities like New York City, Washington DC and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>However, as the morning progress, the west coast also turned read to warn of an outage. </p>

<p>Some had flocked to Twitter to share their frustration and excitement of it being a 'digital snow day'</p>

<p> August 24 marks the first day of school for much of the US, but the eight hour outage left students unable to attend online classes</p>

<p>Along with many Americans being unable to connect with staff on a Monday morning, August 24 also marks the first day of college for students.</p>

<p>However, some have flocked to Twitter to share their frustration and excitement of it being a 'digital snow day.'</p>

<p>Others Twitter users said the day has been canceled because they are unable to connect to the platform to conduct business, which has led others to joke that there is no need to work Monday. </p>

<p>Zoom first launched in 2013, but recently gained popularity when the coronavirus pandemic began spreading across the world and forcing millions into their homes.</p>

<p>The video conferencing app allowed people to still converse with loved ones, conduct business and learn remotely while still being lockdown.</p>

<p>Zoom's status page showed the firm has identified the 'issue causing users to be unable to authenticate to the Zoom website (zoom.us) and unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars, and we are working on a fix for this issue. But the outage is affecting many Americans who are working home and unable to connect with staff</p>

<p>Although the platform has allowed the world to communicate during the pandemic, it has come under fire for a number of privacy and security issues.</p>

<p>Internet trolls were Zoombombing calls by displaying pornographic and racists content while users hold work conferences, online teaching sessions and even alcohol anonymous meetings – leaving many to wonder just how secure the service is.</p>

<p>However, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan spoke with Good Morning America in July to assure the public that privacy is of upmost importance to the firm and revealed features that will keep internet trolls at bay.</p>

<p>Yuan explained that users can create passwords for meetings, waiting rooms and lockdown each session in order to keep their calls safe.</p>

<p>Digital break-ins on Zoom meetings are taking place across the US as much of country is placed on lockdown and forced to resort to online video conferences to communicate to limit the spread of the coronavirus - more than 245 million Americans are either self-isolating or mandated to stay home.</p>

<p>Zoom first launched in 2013, but recently gained popularity when the coronavirus pandemic began spreading across the world and forcing millions into their homes. The video conferencing app allowed people to still converse with loved ones, conduct business and learn remotely while still being lockdown. One Twitter user joked that everyone can stop pretending to work due to the idea that many are unable to perform their jobs without Zoom</p>

<p>However, all these internet trolls have to do is search the internet for links to video conferences and enter the calls to launch their sneering harassment.</p>

<p>‘There are things we can do every day to protect ourselves while using the platform,’ he said.</p>

<p>You need to understand the secure feature of about how to use Zoom.’</p>

<p>Those features include creating a password for each meeting, so only those attending can enter.</p>

<p>Users can also establish a waiting room for the group, allowing them to welcome in specific people and keep track of who is attending.</p>

<p>And for added safety, meetings can be lockdown once everyone is inside.</p>

<p>Many companies, including NASA, SpaceX, Bank of America and Google have banned staff from using the platform. </p>
