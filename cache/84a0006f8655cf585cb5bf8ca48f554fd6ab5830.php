<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham will need to up their bid for Barcelona youngster Lucas de Vega if they are to land the Brazilian this summer, according to AS.</p>

<p>The Spanish newspaper claim that Spurs have made a move for the 20-year-old, offering Barca around £2million to sign him on a permanent deal.</p>

<p>However, the La Liga giants are said to want around £3.6m up front, with the same amount in add-ons in order to sanction a deal.</p>

<p>Tottenham have made a £2m move for Lucas De Vega but Barcelona will hold out for over £7m</p>

<p>De Vega has a huge release clause of £90m despite never playing a game for the first team, but Barca will reportedly let him go for just over £7m.</p>

<p>Tottenham face competition from a number of sides in Spain's second tier after the central midfielder impressed on loan at Cartegena last season.</p>

<p>Barcelona are not actively looking to sell De Vega and are happy to keep him as a potential option for the first team in the coming seasons.</p>

<p>Spurs boss Jose Mourinho (centre) is busy strengthening his squad ahead of the new season</p>

<p>However, Jose Mourinho is determined to freshen up his squad this summer and could return with a bid closer to the club's valuation.</p>

<p>AS say that the Brazilian's future is currently 'unclear', with Sporting Gijon, Malaga, Tenerife and Real Zaragoza all keen on keeping him in Spain.</p>

<p>Tottenham have already signed goalkeeper Joe Hart, defender Matt Doherty and midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg this summer.</p>
