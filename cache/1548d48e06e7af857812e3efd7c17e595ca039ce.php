<p>MailOnline have contacted Simon's representatives for further comment.  </p>

<p>Getting better: Despite his excruciating injury, it appears that the Britain's Got Talent judge is well on the mend as singer Sinitta, 51, gave an update on his progress</p>

<p>Since injuring his back, Simon has had to pull out of his shows Britain's Got Talent and America's Got Talent, as he took some time out of the spotlight to recover. </p>

<p>He had been hoping to be well enough to film the BGT Christmas Special, but it's recently been revealed that he'd been forced to pull out. </p>

<p>Sources claim the star is unable to travel to the UK from his home in Los Angeles to film the special in October, after breaking his back in an electric bike accident last month. </p>

<p>Accident: The music mogul was rushed to hospital at the beginning of August when he fell from his electric bike whilst taking it for a test drive at his house in Malibu</p>

<p>Despite this setback, Simon is reportedly still raking in the cash through his television and music empire, with sources claiming he's earned an eye-watering £37million in just one year.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun that Diversity's Ashley Banjo is expected to fill in for Simon during non-competitive festive special, which will see BGT's biggest stars take to the stage to entertain viewers. </p>

<p>They said: 'Simon hoped he'd be well enough to fly from Los Angeles to the UK for the special show but he's had to pull out.</p>

<p>Update: 'It was a serious accident. So for people who love him, like me, it was very, very scary. He's taken some steps, so he has reassured himself that he's not paralysed'</p>

<p>'Plus the new lockdown measures — and him having to fly two weeks before the show so he could quarantine in advance — made it even more difficult for him to make the journey.</p>

<p>'Simon will of course be across the show and what happens on it but this is a massive blow for him as he adores.'</p>

<p>It comes amid claims that Simon has raked in an eye-watering £37million ($46million) in just one year.</p>

<p>The media mogul's company Simco, which oversees his earnings from TV, has reported a profit of £35million – an increase of £10million on the previous financial year, according to The Sun.</p>

<p>Sad news: Simon has reportedly been forced to pull out of Britain's Got Talent's Christmas Special, as he continues to recover from his broken back </p>

<p>His TV empire includes such ratings juggernauts as Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor, which have also enjoyed success in international formats.</p>

<p>And while the global versions of his shows have brought him much success, The Sun reports that his biggest earnings come from the British arm of the TV favourites.</p>

<p>The shows in the UK market reportedly pull in 42 per cent of his earnings, compared to 33 per cent in the US and 21 per cent in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted a representative for Simon Cowell for comment. </p>
