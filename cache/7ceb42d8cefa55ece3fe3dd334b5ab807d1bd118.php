<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victoria has announced a record 59 coronavirus deaths, the state's highest tally so far.</p>

<p>But not all the deaths occurred in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>The new deaths come as bombshell leaked documents reveal Melbourne's strict stage four lockdown could be extended by another two weeks.</p>

<p>A top secret draft for the city's exit road map has revealed the government's plan to extend the 8pm-5am curfew and keep restrictions on businesses for an additional two weeks.</p>

<p>The new deaths come as bombshell leaked documents reveal Melbourne's strict stage four lockdown could be extended by another two weeks (pictured, police roam Melbourne on Thursday)</p>

<p>While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked map is 'out of date', premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Stage Four restrictions.</p>

<p>‘Everything is on the table,’ he admitted. ‘It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.’ </p>

<p>According to the road map, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage Four comes to an end.</p>

<p>Single people and single parents would also be given the right to have a nominated visitor at their home. </p>
