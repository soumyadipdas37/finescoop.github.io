<p>Natural beauty: The brunette beauty wore a neutral palette of makeup and styled her short hair in curls as she soaked up the sun while working on the shore</p>

<p>'I'm here and I don't want to be anonymous, but I am about to start filming a film and I do need to be careful about being outspoken because you can get dropped from charities, you can lose campaigns with car companies,' the 35-year-old said. </p>

<p>'It has happened to me in recent times for speaking out. I feel careful and I don't want to elicit any aggressive, threatening responses.  </p>

<p>The actress has signed on to feature in The Ogilvy Fortune, just months after she was dropped as an ambassador for Plan International Australia, a charity for girls' equality following her controversial comments about vaccinations. </p>

<p>Beauty: After filming a scene, a makeup artist was spotted reapplying Isabel's makeup on the shore</p>

<p>Lucas said she felt '100 per cent called to shine a light on the reality of what's really going on' in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown directives. </p>

<p>'There's a certain level of agenda and darkness that has had authority ... and that has had a lot of people believing lies,' she said in the Zoom chat with other well-known figures in the anti-lockdown and anti-mask community.</p>

<p>The actress also claimed thst she met several doctors while living in California who dropped out of the medical field due to 'corruption'.</p>

<p>'All of what they were speaking about is what we're facing right now. When we are in a fear state, we just follow what we're told.</p>

<p>Long working day: Earlier in the day, the actress was spotted arriving to the set in blue jeans, a green jumper and pair of comfortable black sneakers</p>

<p>Break time: After filming the scene, the actress put on a warm green jacket and enjoyed a walk along the footpath</p>

<p>Lucas said that at the beginning of the pandemic in March she was asked by her local council to film a video calling on locals to stay at home to stop the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>She appeared in the clip urging viewers to avoid travelling in NSW to slow the spread of coronavirus, saying: 'This is not the right time to be visiting Byron or other coastal towns, it's a good chance to give nature a break and ourselves.' </p>

<p>Lucas also revealed she regretted appearing in the clip during the Zoom chat.</p>

<p>'I saw that there was all these other great people doing it and it's that sort of thing where you can get looped in without realising you're being looped in,' she said.</p>

<p>'But those with a strong conscience and strong integrity won't as easily sell out.'  </p>
