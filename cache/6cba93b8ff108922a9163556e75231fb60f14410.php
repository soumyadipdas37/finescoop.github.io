<p>You don't have to say goodbye to dresses and skirts just because it's autumn. A knitted jumper dress is an easy way to update your cold weather look. Not only can it be styled with trainers for a comfortable and cool off-duty look, but paired tights and boots it's perfect for the office, a date night or the school run. </p>

<p>The Hawiton Women's Jumper Dress has attracted growing attention on Amazon, with shoppers awarding it points for its comfort, versatility and style. Plus, at just £24.99 it's a bit of a bargain. </p>

<p>The Hawiton Women's Jumper Dress is a big hit for autumn, offering comfort and style at a very reasonable price point </p>

<p>The Hawiton Women's Jumper Dress has scored points among reviewers for its quality, cut and fit - not to mention the super affordable price point.</p>

<p>The cable twist knit means there's more coverage for chilly legs on cold days while the A-line skirt adds more movement to the material making it a lot more flattering. </p>

<p>Available in a crewneck or turtleneck, it's been described by shoppers as 'very flattering', 'very thick and warm' and 'perfect for this wintery weather'.</p>

<p>In autumnal hues like brown, black, wine red and green, the knitted dress is perfect for the new season. It also comes in striped prints which would be ideal for the festive season. </p>

<p>One reviewer wrote: 'Absolutely lovely jumper dress, exactly what I expected. Colour is accurate, size I order bigger then what I wear as I prefer loose fitting. Perfect for this wintery weather. Can be worn dressed up or down.'</p>

<p>Another commented: 'Really nice dress for the price'. They added: 'This is a good quality material which has some weight to it, therefore giving a nice hang to the dress. I've already ordered another one in black.'</p>

<p>The Hawiton jumper dress is available in a crewneck (left) and turtleneck (right) - the latter being perfectly suited to colder autumnal days </p>

<p>As shoppers have suggested, the knitted dress can easily be styled up or down depending on the occasion. We love the idea of wearing it with slouchy knee high boots for either daytime or evening dressing, but it could also be worn with tights and ankle boots for a cosy, comfortable look.</p>

<p>The Hawiton dress is the perfect solution for those days where you want to feel relaxed and comfortable, but put together at the same time.  </p>

<p>In fact, one shopper raved: 'So good I got two! Truly lovely and very flattering.'</p>
