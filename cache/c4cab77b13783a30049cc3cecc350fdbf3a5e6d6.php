<p>'He was not breathing properly,' Mr Goldstein told the Mirror. </p>

<p>'He said 'please help me'. He was kneeling onto the other officer and then went back on to the ground. I then supported his back with my body so he could open his zip.</p>

<p>'He was lucky. He could've died. He was screaming and crying.'</p>
