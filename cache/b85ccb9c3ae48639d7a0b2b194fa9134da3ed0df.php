<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sergio Aguero has been training alone on the eve of Manchester City's season following a knee injury.</p>

<p>The Argentine last featured in June and has not been participating in sessions with Pep Guardiola's squad this week ahead of Monday's Premier League opener at Wolves.</p>

<p>Aguero had initially hoped to prove his fitness substantially enough to play a minor part in last month's Champions League but progress has been slower than anticipated.</p>

<p>Sergio Aguero has been training alone this week ahead of Manchester City's season-opener</p>

<p>Aguero finished last season on 23 goals but only featured in 32 matches - his lowest number since joining the club from Atletico Madrid nine years ago.</p>

<p>Dwindling appearances were down to two injury lay-offs - the first coming before Christmas - and increased the burden on Gabriel Jesus, who deputises in his absence.</p>

<p>City are acutely aware that replacing the 32-year-old is their single biggest task in the transfer market over the next year, with Guardiola's options limited in central areas without him.</p>

<p>As well as Jesus, Raheem Sterling - who finished top scorer last term - can operate as a central striker but has been most effective from the left.</p>

<p>The Argentine striker has not featured for City since June, when he injured his knee vs Burnley</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sevilla defender Jules Kounde has emerged as a potential alternative to Kalidou Koulibaly as they continue to hunt for a long-term partner for Aymeric Laporte.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old impressed as Sevilla lifted yet another Europa League title and is seen as a more viable option than his defensive partner, Diogo Carlos. </p>

<p>City and Napoli remain at an impasse over Koulibaly, with the Serie A side demanding more than £70million. Guardiola admires Atletico's Jose Gimenez, although their valuation also appears to be too steep.</p>

<p>City are fielding interest from Galatasaray for veteran Fernandinho but Guardiola would rather the Brazilian remain at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
