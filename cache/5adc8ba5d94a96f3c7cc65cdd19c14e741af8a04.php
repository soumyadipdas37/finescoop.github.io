<p>'The state of my heart, in all honesty, today and has been for some time, is equal split of joy and complete heartbreak,' said Monty, before breaking down in tears.</p>

<p>'Because, I'm growing a baby that I'm so excited about... but I don't have my mum here to do it with me. </p>

<p>'And I'm scared, and I don't know how to do this life without my mum, but I'm doing it. </p>

<p>'I feel so lucky that such a kick a**e, strong, hilarious, cheeky and unbelievably loyal woman was by my side for 38 years. I so badly want another 338 with her though. </p>

<p>'I am feeling so numb one minute to crippled with unbearable disbelief and pain the next. </p>

<p>'I'm not sure how to live my life without my mum by my side but I promised her I will give it all that I've got.'</p>
