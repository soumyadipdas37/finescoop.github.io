<p>Popular: The actor spent five hugely successful years playing resident butler Charles Carson in the ITV show before it went off air in 2015</p>

<p>He said: 'It’s amazing. Does it feel like ten years? It [does] seem like an age ago. And I looked down on my bookshelves and I found this - a bound script of the first edition of the first script of Downton Abbey. </p>

<p>'And I had a little wave of nostalgia and my first scene it say’s "Carson the Butler sits in his magnificence"... and my first line was "Ah, William, any papers yet?"... as the newspapers were being delivered!' </p>

<p>While the show went on to become a huge success for ITV, Carter revealed he initially had his doubts about the broadcaster's ability to pull it off due to their checkered history with period dramas.  </p>

<p>Welcome back: The cast returned for a feature length film in 2019, four years after the show ended</p>

<p>Asked if the show represented a gamble for ITV, he said: 'I think so because when things are successful you think well they were always destined to be successful but at that time, ITV didn’t have a great history of doing period dramaS. </p>

<p>'It had seemed to be the province of the BBC and I think Upstairs Downstairs was relaunching around the same time and so there were no guarantees of success at all.</p>

<p>'We were all rather trapedaceous, so it meant that the runaway success of it took us all by surprise, and a very pleasant surprise it was too.' </p>
