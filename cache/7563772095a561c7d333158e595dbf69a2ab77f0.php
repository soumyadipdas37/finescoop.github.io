<p>Honest: Nadia wrote that she hopes to make her son feel 'proud', while admitting that sometimes motherhood can be 'tough' and she sometimes 'falls short'</p>

<p>Last month, Nadia revealed she's battled 'a touch of post-natal depression' after an emotionally 'tough' week of parenting her baby son.</p>

<p>The former Celebs Go Dating star explained she has been quieter on Instagram of late because 'there has been a lot weighing on my mind'. </p>

<p>The single star told how she 'couldn't stop crying' as she opened up on her mental health on her podcast, The Clueless Mum.</p>

<p>Honest: Nadia recently had a 'tough' week of parenting her baby son Ezekiel</p>

<p>Nadia, who suffers with 'bouts of depression and anxiety', explained that she had a break from social media after a 'tough' few days. </p>

<p>The TV personality said she had her first period in more than three years following pregnancy and the contraceptive pill, which she described as 'extremely emotional'. </p>

<p>Speaking on the podcast, titled, 'Periods, PND and &amp; Trip To The Paediatrician', Nadia revealed that she came off anti-depressants, which 'worked wonderfully well' for her, when she found out she was pregnant. </p>

<p>She said: 'I am having to try and learn to live with and manage I was on anti-depressants.</p>

<p>Single mother: The former Celebs Go Dating star explained she has been quieter on Instagram of late because 'there has been a lot weighing on my mind'</p>

<p>'I am no longer on any medication and so therefore you are all up in your feelings because I actually really loved my anti-depressants they worked wonderfully well for me - they really helped my mental health get stronger.    </p>

<p>'But then when I was pregnant I wanted to come off and I did and so obviously, you know, it becomes, I don't know, the voice in your head that is telling you that you are a s***** person just gets a bit louder.</p>

<p>'And the more tired you are, and the more fatigued you are, the louder the voice becomes and the less mental strength you have to tell her to, "shut the f**k up", basically. </p>

<p>She continued: 'And so it becomes this constant voice in your head of self-doubt and worry and anxiety and depression.' </p>

<p>Speaking about re-starting her period, she said: 'It was tough, it was so heavy and extremely emotional and the day before I was crying over all sorts of stuff. ' </p>

<p>Nadia also explained how she is going through the four-month sleep regression with Ezekiel and revealed that she has not slept more than a 'four-hour chunk' in 12 months. </p>

<p>She explained: 'His sleep pattern is now becoming more like an adult but it is very very difficult because we just have no sleep and so I am extremely tired.' </p>

<p>Nadia also revealed that she has just 10 days before she has to move out of her flat after she still hasn't found anywhere that is 'quite right'. </p>

<p>Emotional: She said she 'couldn't stop crying' as she opened up on her mental health on her podcast, The Clueless Mum</p>

<p>She said: 'It has just been one of those weeks where there has been a lot weighing on my mind. </p>

<p>'There was a couple of days where I just couldn't stop crying and I had finished my period so it wasn't that and I think I had a touch of post-natal depression because I just felt down in the dumps. </p>

<p>'Luckily it seems to have kind of naturally passed I am feeling the last couple of days a lot brighter.'   </p>

<p>Nadia, who had been given a one per cent chance of conceiving naturally, announced the birth of her baby on Instagram in March, sharing a picture of herself kissing his little hand. </p>

<p>She had written: 'He is here and he is perfect.' </p>

<p>'He is perfect': Nadia revealed she has given birth to her first child with this beautiful picture back in March </p>
