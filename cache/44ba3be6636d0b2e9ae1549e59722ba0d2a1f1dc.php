<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>David Blaine prepared for his latest daring stunt by testing his limits inside a cyro chamber with Jaden Smith.</p>

<p>David floated more than 24,000 feet above Arizona holding a cluster of balloons, and in order to prepare for the frigid temperatures overhead, the illusionist trained inside a cyro chamber.</p>

<p>Jaden, 22, was game to try out the chamber, telling David: 'I will try and stay in there for as long as I possibly can.'</p>

<p>That's cool! David Blaine prepared for his latest daring stunt by testing his limits inside a cyro chamber with Jaden Smith</p>

<p>Impressively, Jaden last three full minutes inside.</p>

<p>'The way this helps my next stunt is when I'm going up in the balloons, riding all the way up, basically every thousand feet you lose three and a half degrees,' David explained. 'On my first jump that I did from 25,000 feet, I had a full face mask on, and the first breath that I took, the whole thing iced over. So my skydiving, I was jumping down, I had to like look through this little hole.'</p>

<p>'Ice! While you're out of the plane!' Jaden said incredulously.</p>

<p>'It becomes ice immediately,' David said.</p>

<p>'That's crazy,' Jaden remarked.</p>

<p>The breakdown: Blaine explained how the cyro chamber will prepare him for the balloon stunt </p>

<p>'He's doing great!' Throughout the session, David would periodically check in on Jaden, who would flash the thumbs up </p>

<p>The pair took their temperatures prior to entering the chamber, with David measuring at 97.7 and Jaden at 98.3.</p>

<p>'We had one professional boxer yesterday tap out,' the employee said.</p>

<p>'Wow,' Jaden remarked. Now he was wearing a white robe and gloves.</p>

<p>'He got knocked out in one round!' David said.</p>

<p>Cool as a cucumber: Jaden stood calmly by the transparent door throughout his session </p>

<p>Nice! Smith emerged from the cyro after an impressive three minutes </p>

<p>'Wow, this is crazy right now!' Jaden replied.</p>

<p>Jaden then walked inside the chamber, where he stood calmly by the transparent door.</p>

<p>Throughout the session, David would periodically check in on Jaden, who would flash the thumbs up.</p>

<p>'He's got 45 seconds left, he's doing great,' David mused. 'He's starting to shake,' he noticed.</p>

<p>Brrr! Jaden shivered as he walked outside of the freezing cold temperatures</p>

<p>He's got this! Blaine smiled from ear-to-ear inside the cyro </p>

<p>Whoa! Remarkably, David lasted in the chamber for nine minutes</p>

<p>Once his session was over, a shivering Jaden emerged from the chamber.</p>

<p>Next, it was David's turn to enter the chamber.</p>

<p>'In the stunt, I do have to learn when I'm going up to these heights how to stay completely coherent and hypoxia kicks in much quicker when you're in an extreme condition,' David explained.</p>

<p>Remarkably, David lasted in the chamber for nine minutes.</p>

<p>How low can you go? His temperature was so low the thermometer could not register it</p>

<p>Taking part: Will Smith, Jaden, Jason Sudeikis, and Olivia Wilde were among the stars taught the breathing techniques</p>

<p>Magical: Both Olivia and Jason were able to hold their breath for longer than four minutes, exceeding Houdini's record of three minutes and thirty seconds</p>

<p>'I do not know how! That was insane!' Jaden said.</p>

<p>'Let's see if the temperature dropped,' David mused as he approached the thermometer.</p>

<p>His temperature was so low the thermometer could not register it.</p>

<p>David prepared for his stunt by teaching several celebrities techniques that would allow them to hold their breath significantly longer than thought possible.</p>

<p>Will Smith, Jaden, Jason Sudeikis, and Olivia Wilde were among the stars taught the breathing techniques. </p>

<p>Both Olivia and Jason were able to hold their breath for longer than four minutes, exceeding Harry Houdini's record of three minutes and thirty seconds.</p>

<p>'Once we got past Houdini's, I was like, "well,"' Olivia joked, to the amusement of her partner Jason.</p>

<p>'We got past the Navy Seals... I'm happy with this!' Olivia continued.</p>

<p>David successfully completed the stunt on Tuesday morning over Page, Arizona, where he floated more than 24,000 feet in the air holding onto 52 helium-filled balloons for about an hour.</p>
