<p>'Sh** food!' Lincoln Lewis, 32, has discussed using diet and exercise to 'rebuild himself as a person' after vices such as chocolate and crisps left him 'unmotivated, undisciplined and unhappy'</p>

<p>'The last couple of years when things haven't been the best, when motivation is lacking sometimes you look for a pick me up, and for me it would always be sh**** food like chocolate or chips,' Lincoln reflected.</p>

<p>After a lengthy period neglecting his health, the TV star had a chance meeting with the editor of Men's Health, Scott Henderson.</p>

<p>'I remember talking [to Scott] about inspiring, fit people like Michael B Jordan, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Hardy who all happen to be former Men's Health cover stars. Then Scott said, "We'll get you on the cover, mate."'  </p>
