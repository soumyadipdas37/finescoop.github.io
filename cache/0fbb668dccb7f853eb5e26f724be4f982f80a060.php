<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Timo Werner has admitted doubts crept into his mind over moving to Chelsea from RB Leipzig after they were taught a lesson by Bayern Munich at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>Bayern, who would go on to win the Champions League, convincingly overcame Chelsea 3-0 in the first-leg of their last-16 tie thanks to a double from Serge Gnabry and a Robert Lewandowski strike.</p>

<p>The defeat showed just how much work Frank Lampard has on his hands to get Chelsea back among Europe's elite and the club's £53million new boy, Werner, has suggested he was surprised by the result.</p>

<p>Chelsea were quick to snap up Timo Werner for £53million this summer from RB Leipzig </p>

<p>When asked if he was shocked by the manner of their elimination, also losing 4-1 away from home to get dumped out 7-1 on aggregate, Werner told Sport Bild: 'I would be lying if I said it wasn't like that. </p>

<p>'The 3-0 home defeat of Chelsea in the first leg against Bayern didn't exactly speak in favour of going to London.</p>

<p>'I have to say that openly, because with Leipzig we always played very good and close games against Bayern.' </p>

<p>But Werner did go on to admit that the European defeat has helped Chelsea in the long run, as it made the club realise what they needed to do to close the gap.</p>

<p>Chelsea were taught a lesson by Bayern Munich at Stamford Bridge, losing 3-0 in February</p>

<p>The defeat showed just how much Chelsea have to do to close the gap on Europe's elite</p>

<p>The Blues have enjoyed a £230m spending spree this summer, with Werner moving to Stamford Bridge alongside Kai Havertz (£89m), Ben Chilwell (£50m), Hakim Ziyech (£38m), Thiago Silva (free) and Malang Sarr (free).</p>

<p>Werner: 'By showing Chelsea the weak points, the club was able to work on the pieces of the puzzle in order to catch up with the future Champions League winner FC Bayern. That's what Chelsea did.' </p>

<p>After splashing the cash this summer, Chelsea have been tipped by some to fight for the Premier League title with Liverpool and Manchester City.</p>

<p>However, Chelsea still have plenty of work to do to compete with England's best after going down 2-0 to Liverpool at Stamford Bridge last weekend- with Sadio Mane scoring twice in the second half to capitalise on Andreas Christensen's red card. </p>

<p>Chelsea have looked to close the gap by spending big, including on £89m man Kai Havertz</p>
