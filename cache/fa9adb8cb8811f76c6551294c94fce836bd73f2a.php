<p>Fans flooded Twitter with praise, after his best moments included comforting a heartbroken Sura by speaking of his beauty, singing to a contestant and enjoying amazing chemistry with his co-host Noel Fielding. </p>

<p>He's a winner! Matt Lucas has been lauded for his debut as new host of Great British Bake Off, following Tuesday night's episode of the show</p>

<p>Stamp of approval: Matt won near unanimous approval from Bake Off fans </p>

<p>'It really is. And I LOVED Matt Lucas. I wasn't sure when they first announced him but last night I thought he was lovely, and great with Noel...   Matt Lucas - you are a star thats what i needed after boris's gloomy announcement... Oh god...</p>

<p>'<?php echo e('@'); ?>RealMattLucas you are just magical... If you could squeeze Wichita Lineman in at some point I’d be eternally grateful #GreatBritishBakeOff'. </p>

<p>During his Boris take, Matt was a spitting image of the Prime Minister in the show opener, which was postponed by 15 minutes, after Boris addressed the nation with the new lockdown measures in the fight against coronavirus. </p>

<p>Uncanny: Matt left viewers in stitches as he impersonated a bumbling Boris Johnson (right)  </p>

<p>In the skit Matt, who donned a platinum blonde wig and stood in front of a Union Jack flag, said: 'I've talked about this, you know, the printer is upside down again. And oh no.. well… how? Ah, yes well that works actually, I can read that fine.</p>

<p>'Um, right, let's err… yeah. Good evening, let's get straight to it. We are now approaching Phase 46. Which means that from Tuesday morning, or Wednesday evening depending on your height...</p>

<p>'We are, we are, we are saying with regards to baking if you must bake in a tent, bake in a tent. 'But please don't bake in a tent. And we are asking people to use common sense with regards to the distribution of hundreds and thousands.'</p>

<p>Shocker: While comforting  heartbroken Sura, Matt commented on his own beauty</p>

<p>Aside from his take on the Prime Minister, another stand out moment for the hilarious star was when pharmacy worker Sura, 31, collided with security guard Dave, 30, Hampshire and knocked over his tray of pineapple upside down cakes. </p>

<p>While he joined Noel in comforting the bereft baker after her gaffe, Matt said: 'It might be my fault because I was looking at you and I think you were probably hypnotised by my beauty', after which he was met with a stunned silence. </p>

<p>In another moment of cheeky comfort for the bakers, as he spoke to eventual evictee Loriea about her hometown of Durham, during which he belted out Roger Whittaker's Old Durham Town in her ear - much to viewers' delight. </p>
