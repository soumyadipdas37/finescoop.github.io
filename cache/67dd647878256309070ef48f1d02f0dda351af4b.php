<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Anyone anxious about having their JobKeeper payment slashed is being told to apply for the dole.</p>

<p>The wage subsidy scheme is being extended at reduced rates for six months from September 28.</p>

<p>Payments for full-time staff are being cut from $1500 to $1200 per fortnight, while people who usually worked less than 20 hours a week before the coronavirus pandemic will receive just $750.</p>

<p>Social Services Minister Anne Ruston is encouraging people to top up their payments with unemployment benefits.</p>

<p>Australians who are worried about their JobKeeper payment being slashed on September 28 have been encouraged to 'top up' their benefits with the JobSeeker payment (hospitality worker pictured)</p>

<p>'We have temporarily put arrangements in place so that our social security safety net is not just for people who have lost their jobs,' Senator Ruston said on Monday.</p>

<p>'It is able to provide a cushion for people who have had or fear their hours or income will be reduced.'</p>

<p>JobKeeper recipients on $1200 per fortnight may be eligible for a partial dole payment, lifting their total income to $1476.</p>

<p>People receiving JobKeeper at the part-time rate of $750 per fortnight could receive another $546 in unemployment benefits, boosting their incomes to $1295.</p>

<p>More than one million workers are expected to come off JobKeeper over the next three months as businesses recover.</p>

<p>Almost 3.6 million people have received the fortnightly payments throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>That number is expected to drop to 2.24 million in the December quarter as businesses whose turnovers have improved 'graduate' from the scheme.</p>

<p>It is tipped to tumble to 1.75 million in the first three months of next year.</p>

<p>The Morrison government is also preparing to slash JobSeeker booster payments from the end of this week.</p>

<p>People on the unemployment benefit have since March received an extra $550 per fortnight through a coronavirus supplement.</p>

<p>That is being reduced to $250 a fortnight from this Friday and is scheduled to be scrapped altogether at the end of December.</p>

<p>Senator Ruston said the increased dole payment would be extended into next year if required.</p>

<p>'I want to assure all Australians, if elevated supports are continued to be needed, they will be made available,' she told reporters.</p>
