<p>Investigators are still working to determine the motive for the shooting, which they said occurred 'without warning or provocation'.</p>

<p>The suspect was described as a black male between 28 and 30 years old. </p>

<p>He was wearing dark clothing at the time of the shooting and was last seen in a black four-door sedan. </p>

<p>The president tweeted: 'If they die, fast trial death penalty for the killer. Only way to stop this!' </p>

<p>He had retweeted his son Donald Jr. who shared the footage, writing: 'Please pray for these two Sheriff Deputies. Their lives matter!!! #BlueLivesMatter.'</p>

<p>Joe Biden said: 'This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice. </p>

<p>'Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished. </p>
