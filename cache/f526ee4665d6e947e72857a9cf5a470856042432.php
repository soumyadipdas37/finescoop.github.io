<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The talk of Kris Jenner joining the cast of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills is still gaining major traction on the internet and beyond.</p>

<p>All the chatter ignited about a week-and-a-half ago when the Kardashian/Jenner family announced Keeping Up With The Kardashians would be coming to an end in 2021 after 14 years and 20 seasons. </p>

<p>And now RHOBH's most recent addition, Garcelle Beauvais, who joined the cast as a main member for the 10th season, has jumped into the conversation and gave her support to the idea of Jenner coming on board.  </p>

<p>Will it happen? : Garcelle Beauvais weighed in on the growing talk of Kris Jenner joining the cast of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills</p>

<p>'I think she fits the bill… Anything is possible,' Beauvais, 53, revealed to Extra's Cheslie Kryst, before tapping into her own experience in making the decision to do reality TV.</p>

<p>'I never thought I'd do reality, so anything is possible.'</p>

<p>The potential addition of Kris Jenner comes amid some major changes to RHOBH and the Real Housewives franchise as a whole.  </p>

<p>Her take: 'I think she fits the bill… Anything is possible,' Beauvais, 53, revealed to Extra's Cheslie Kryst about the talk of Jenner joining RHOBH</p>

<p>End of an era: The Kardashian/Jenner family announced the end of KUWTK in 2021 after 14 years and 20 seasons earlier this month</p>

<p>Earlier in the week it was confirmed that Denise Richards would not be returning to RHOBH. So it makes perfect sense to want to add such a high-profile reality star as the famous momager.</p>

<p>Whether it's Jenner or someone else, Beauvais thinks RHOBH could use a boost from a new and well-deserved cast member.</p>

<p>'I do wonder about that… I just feel like new energy is needed,' said the Haitian native, who was added as a permanent co-host of The Talk in August.</p>

<p>'You know, personally, if I had anything to do with it.' </p>

<p>Bye, bye: The RHOBH cast has an opening following the departure of Denise Richards</p>

<p>Guest star: Jenner made an appearance on the season 10 premiere of RHOBH in support of longtime friend Kyle Richards' charity gala the momager made a $25,000 donation to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles</p>

<p>Jenner's addition makes even more sense knowing that she and cast member Kyle Richards have had a decades-long friendship. </p>

<p>Fans of RHOBH got an up-close look at that friendship when Jenner appeared on the season 10 premiere at Richards' charity gala, where she made a $25,000 donation to the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.             </p>

<p>A source has told People that 'Kris seems intrigued by the show and hasn’t dismissed joining it.'   </p>

<p>Stunned: Beauvais said she was surprised to hear that NeNe Leakes had left The Real Housewives Of Atlanta; she also speculated that maybe Leakes would join RHOBH</p>

<p>Beauvais also weighed in on the departure of NeNe Leakes from The Real Housewives Of Atlanta.</p>

<p>'I was surprised to hear that news because, you know, I thought she was going to go back. She's a huge part of that franchise. But I also think… Maybe this will give her opportunities to do other things,' the former fashion model said before adding some of her own speculation.</p>

<p>'Maybe she'll come over to the B-H. I just think change is always good. Sometimes it's scary, but I feel like, you know, it's evolution.'</p>

<p>Getting real: Beauvais was added as a permanent co-host of The talk in August</p>
