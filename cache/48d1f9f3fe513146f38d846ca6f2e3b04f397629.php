<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Buying a new primer can be more complicated than just going to your local drugstore and grabbing one off the shelves. Not only does it need to be within budget, but it also needs to smooth over fine lines, blur pores, keep excess oil under control and keep your foundation in place.</p>

<p>Enter Rimmel London Fix and Perfect Pro Primer, which checks all these boxes and is currently Amazon's number one bestseller in the Face Primers category. Plus, it just so happens to be on sale. Win-win.</p>

<p>The £5.08 primer (now 27 per cent off) boasts over 2,000 five-star reviews, with an average star rating of 4.4 out of 5. Customers have hailed it the 'the best primer' claiming it 'works wonders'. One five-star reviewer even claimed 'best primer - I wouldn't try anything else'.</p>

<p>Now £5.08, the Rimmel London Fix and Perfect Pro Primer is hailed as the 'the best primer' by Amazon shoppers</p>

<p>'The best primer I have come across,' one reviewer wrote. 'Makes my skin feel really smooth, and my foundation glides on.'</p>

<p>'I wanted an all-rounded primer,' added another review. 'Tried loads of different ones, Smashbox, MaxFactor, Mac, Clinique and No7. This was by far the best.</p>

<p>'Affordable and lasts for a long time. This doesn't dry out your face; neither does it make it oily. My skin is a bit oily but not hugely. I wouldn't recommend another primer.'</p>

<p>A third shopper agreed, adding: 'I have only just started to use primer, and this was a bargain, now my foundation and blush don't disappear after an hour.'</p>

<p>The multitasking transparent and oil-free primer from Rimmel London promises to 'even out and mattify the complexion' before you apply your base and is said to 'smooth, resurface, brighten, mattify and protect'.</p>

<p>Fix and Perfect Pro’s gel-like, oil-free texture feels so incredibly light and fresh that you can almost forget you are wearing it</p>

<p>One even layer creates a velvety base for your foundation, while simultaneously smoothing over pores and fine lines, for a long-lasting, even makeup application. So you don't have to worry about getting excessively shiny, or having your makeup slide off come midday.</p>

<p>Oh, it also makes your foundation look flawless too. As one Amazon customer wrote in their review, 'This is the best primer I've used up to yet it makes my skin feel soft and makeup flawless.'</p>

<p>Whether you have oily, dry, or combination skin, the Rimmel London Fix and Perfect Pro Primer is a solid option.</p>
