<p>A teenager was rushed to the hospital after a python bit his penis as he sat on the toilet, pictured above</p>

<p>Siraphop Masukarat, 18, (pictured) went to the loo on Tuesday evening when he felt a sudden searing pain in his manhood</p>

<p>Siraphop yelled in terror as he ran out of the bathroom with his pants around his ankles in Nonthaburi, central Thailand, around 20km north of Bangkok.</p>

<p>The teenager's panic-stricken mother calmed him down before paramedics rushed the lad to the nearby Bang Yai Hospital to have his wounded manhood treated.</p>

<p>Doctors gave Siraphop three stitches in the glands at the tip of the penis and treated the bite wound with antibiotic wash, to kill any bacteria from the python's fangs.</p>

<p>Siraphop said: 'I was using the toilet but a few moments after I sat down, I suddenly felt pain in my penis. I looked down and saw there was a snake hanging in the toilet. Then there was blood everywhere.</p>

<p>'It was only a small snake but its bite was so strong. I hope that my penis can recover.'</p>

<p>Animal handlers arrived at the two-storey home and began searching for the snake, which was still coiled up in the toilet bowl</p>

<p>They used snake catching equipment to snare the python, which measured around 4ft long. They took it into a sack before releasing it back into woodland</p>

<p>She said: 'I don't know how the snake got into my house. It could have been through the drain connected to the toilet.</p>

<p>'I know the snake really hurt my son but I'm relieved it was only a non-venomous python. If it was a cobra, he would be dead.</p>

<p>'He will be scared every time he goes to toilet. But he's recovering well at the hospital and I'm thankful to the rescue volunteers for catching the snake.'</p>
