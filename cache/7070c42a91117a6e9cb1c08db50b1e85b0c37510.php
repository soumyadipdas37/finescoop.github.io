<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Millions of healthy people should be prescribed blood pressure lowering medication because the pills can prevent heart attacks later in life, a major study has claimed.</p>

<p>In the biggest study of its kind, Oxford University researchers found lowering levels even from a healthy starting point slashed the risk of heart disease and strokes years down the line.</p>

<p>Currently, treatment is only given to people with extremely high blood pressure, known medically as hypertension. It means about a million Britons are prescribed the cheap pills - which cost between 28p and £1 a day - every year.</p>

<p>Oxford scientists claimed this threshold prevents millions of people who could benefit from the drugs from accessing them and are now calling for a complete overhaul to the way they are prescribed.</p>

<p>Doctors should look at a person’s overall risk of heart disease, including weight, exercise levels and family medical history – instead of solely relying on blood pressure levels, they say.</p>

<p>Cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins are already prescribed in this way and anyone with a 10 per cent chance of future heart troubles is encouraged to take them.</p>

<p>If the same approach was used for blood pressure drugs then 12million more people would become eligible for prescriptions. </p>

<p>Millions of healthy people should be prescribed blood pressure medication because the pills can prevent heart attacks later in life, scientists say (stock image)</p>

<p>Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is given as two figures – systolic pressure, the pressure when your heart pushes blood out, and diastolic pressure, the pressure when your heart rests between beats.</p>

<p>As a general guide, ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg. </p>

<p>Currently people in the UK are considered to have hypertension if their blood pressure is above 140/90. </p>

<p>They are then prescribed drugs such as beta blockers, which reduce stress on the heart, or ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, which relax blood vessels.</p>

<p>But the latest study, which looked at data from 350,000 people, found heart disease could be prevented if blood pressure was reduced from much lower levels.</p>

<p>Presenting the findings at the European Society of Cardiology congress, study leader Kazem Rahimi, associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at Oxford, said: ‘Greater drops in blood pressure with medication lead to greater reductions in the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p>

<p>High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.</p>

<p>More than one in four adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many won't realise it.</p>

<p>The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.</p>

<p>Blood pressure is recorded with two numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.</p>

<p>The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).</p>

<p>As a general guide:</p>

<p>If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.</p>

<p>Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:</p>

<p>‘This holds true regardless of the starting blood pressure level, in people who previously had a heart attack or stroke, and in people who have never had heart disease.’</p>

<p>Professor Rahimi and his team found the chance of a heart attack in the next four years could be slashed by seven per cent for every five-unit reduction in systolic blood pressure.</p>

<p>The risk of a stroke plummeted by 13 per cent in the same time period and the chance of dying from cardiovascular causes dropped five per cent.</p>

<p>The reduced risk remained consistent no matter what a person’s blood pressure was to start with.</p>

<p>It means even people who have a systolic blood pressure of 120, at the upper-end of the healthy range, would be less likely to die from heart conditions if their levels were brought down to 115.</p>

<p>But blood pressure drugs can cause a slew of side effects, including anxiety, drowsiness, coughs, diarrhea or constipation, dizziness, headaches and vomiting.</p>

<p>Professor Rahimi said these need to be weighed up when prescribing the pills to patients with a very low risk of suffering heart troubles.</p>

<p>Healthy people with a one per cent chance of suffering a heart attack should not be given them, he stressed. But smokers or diabetics with a one in 10 chance should. </p>

<p>He added: ‘The decision will depend on an individual’s likelihood of suffering cardiovascular disease in the future – there are a number of risk calculators health professionals can use.’</p>

<p>Around 13million people in the UK have high blood pressure, and the British Heart Foundation said a further five million may have it without knowing.</p>

<p>Left untreated the condition can physically damage the arteries, heart and brain, and lead to heart attacks, heart failure, dementia, kidney failure or stroke. </p>

<p>Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said: 'This study again emphasises the importance of controlling blood pressure as well as possible, to reduce the risk of heart and circulatory diseases.</p>

<p>'The benefits of lowering blood pressure are there whether you have pre-existing heart disease or not and lowering blood pressure - even if it is in the normal range - is associated with fewer heart attacks and strokes.</p>

<p>'This doesn’t mean we should treat everyone with blood pressure lowering drugs. If someone already has a low risk of heart disease, a 10 per cent reduction in their blood pressure may only carry a small direct benefit.</p>

<p>'Ultimately, the decision to treat blood pressure and the target level to aim for is something that requires a conversation between the patient and the doctor. </p>

<p>'It's also important to remember that blood pressure can be improved by means other than medication such as exercise and losing weight.'</p>

<p>Mass medication could prove difficult because many of those prescribed tablets for high blood pressure don't take them because they don't feel ill enough, while persuading healthy people to take a pill for life could prove even trickier.</p>

<p>There are also worries that over-reliance on pills would lead to people neglecting other aspects of their health, such as diet and exercise. </p>

<p>The policy would also be controversial because it would suggest millions of people who were previously considered to be healthy were now at risk of heart attacks.</p>

<p>Health bosses were accused of ‘over-medicalising’ middle-aged people in 2014 when a similar rule change lowered the threshold for statins.</p>
