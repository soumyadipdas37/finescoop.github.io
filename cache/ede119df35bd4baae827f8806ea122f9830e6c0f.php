<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool are worrying about the fitness of Jordan Henderson who was injured during the Merseysiders' Premier League clash away at Chelsea on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Reds captain did not reappear for the second-half at Stamford Bridge due to a thigh issue and was replaced by new signing Thiago at the interval. </p>

<p>Henderson played a key role in the Liverpool midfield as the Premier League champions stifled Chelsea's plans to be effective on the counter attack during the opening period. </p>

<p>Liverpool are sweating over the fitness of Jordan Henderson (left) who was injured on Sunday</p>

<p>Henderson picked up a thigh problem in the first-half and was replaced by Thiago (above)</p>

<p>The 30-year-old's final touch of the game was a superb through ball which allowed Sadio Mane to run through on goal. The winger was brought down by Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen, who was shown a red card for the foul after a VAR check. </p>

<p>Henderson's tight thigh paved the way for new Liverpool signing Thiago Alcantara to make his Premier League debut on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>The Spanish midfielder joined from European champions Bayern Munich in a £25million move earlier this week but started the match against Chelsea on the substitutes' bench. </p>

<p>Henderson's final touch of the ball was a brilliant through ball to Sadio Mane late in the half</p>

<p>Thiago is one of three new Liverpool signings made by head coach Jurgen Klopp this summer, following the arrivals of left-back Kostas Tsimkas from Olympiacos and Wolves winger Diogo Jota. </p>

<p>The move for Thiago means the blow of losing Henderson is softened for Klopp, as Liverpool also have Georginio Wijnaldum, Naby Keita, James Milner, Fabinho and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at the club. </p>

<p>But the thigh issue could be a potential concern for Gareth Southgate and the England squad with Henderson acting as one of the vocal leaders in the national team's dressing room. </p>

<p>The 30-year-old is a key figure in the dressing room and could miss Liverpool's next matches</p>

<p>The Three Lions' next international match is in two-and-a-half weeks' time when they face home ties against Wales, Belgium and Denmark in early October. </p>

<p>Liverpool also have a busy fixture list coming up with the Carabao Cup beginning next week and a difficult test against Arsenal next week. </p>

<p>Henderson played 30 times in the top-flight last season as Liverpool won their first ever Premier League title last season in comfortable fashion. </p>
