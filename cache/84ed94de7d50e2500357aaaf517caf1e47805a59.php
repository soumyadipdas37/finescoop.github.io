<p>Changes: Alexandra Cane revealed the results of what happens when she doesn't stick to her healthy lifestyle as she showed off her bloated stomach following a 10,000 calories challenge</p>

<p>Following a previous 'how to get abs' video shared on her YouTube channel, the beauty decided to challenge herself once again, this time attempting to consume a whopping 10,000 calories in 24 hours.</p>

<p>In her YouTube clip, she told her followers that her test would exclude liquid calories and that she would eat sugary foods that wouldn't fill her up and leave her craving more. </p>

<p>She revealed that she hoped the challenge would be informative for her fans as there would be some 'really interesting information' that will come from the challenge.</p>

<p>Alexandra then proceeded to eat all manner of foods throughout the day including chocolate, ice cream, McDonald's, Burger King and Pot Noodles.</p>

<p>Before: The former Love Island 29, listed a host of ailments she suffered with after overeating in an Instagram video, which included brain fog, headaches and nausea (pictured ahead of the challenge)</p>

<p>However, in the end, she only managed to consume 6,055 calories, adding that there was 'no way in hell' that would reach 10,000.</p>

<p>Over on Instagram, Alexandra showed off the aftermath of her failed challenge, as she rubbed her swollen tummy for the camera. </p>

<p>Donning a pair of tiny white shorts, Alexandra turned to the side while filming herself, as she displayed her slighting protruding stomach. </p>

<p>Test: Following a previous 'how to get abs' video shared on her YouTube channel, the beauty decided to challenge herself once again, this time attempting to consume a whopping 10,000 calories in 24 hours</p>

<p>Captioning the clip, she penned: '10,000 CALORIES AFTERMATH... So following on from the video I posted yesterday on YouTube (which I’m super pleased you’re loving btw!) I thought I would update you on how I’m feeling and how I’ve recovered!'</p>

<p>She then went on to reveal the downsides to day of bad eating as she said: 'MENTAL: The day after I had a splitting headache, brain fog, tiredness, cravings for more sugary processed foods, low mood, no motivation to workout, negative thoughts about my bloating (which isn’t fat - just water retention but it can really affect your mood as gut inflammation contributes towards mood disorders).</p>

<p>'PHYSICAL: I had severe bloating, water retention, gas, constipation, nausea, breakouts of spots, dehydration, sinus inflammation, gut inflammation, puffy face.</p>

<p>Getting stuffed: Alexandra then proceeded to eat all manner of foods throughout the day including chocolate, ice cream, McDonald's, Burger King and Pot Noodles</p>

<p>Too hard: However, in the end, she only managed to consume 6,055 calories, adding that there was 'no way in hell' that would reach 10,000</p>

<p>'A week later and I have only just started to feel relatively normal. Did I gain weight? Probably, but it would have most likely been water retention as I still fit in my clothes comfortably! Here are some things that helped me return back to normal...'</p>

<p>She continued: '- MINDSET. DON’T FREAK OUT. It’s just food. Food is just ENERGY!!! It will either get stored in the body or be used for activity. Remove the guilt. Remove the fear.</p>

<p>'- WATER. Your body is 60% water and is the best way of flushing things out of your system. If you don’t drink enough, you may feel a little more ‘blocked up’ and struggle going to the toilet regularly.</p>

<p>'- STEPS. After overeating, I have ZERO motivation to workout, my body feels heavy and like I don’t want to move. Walking/increasing your steps even if you can’t do an intense workout will help with digestion &amp; moving things along. Get those cells vibrating!</p>

<p>Results: Over on Instagram, Alexandra showed off the aftermath of her failed challenge, as she rubbed her swollen tummy for the camera</p>

<p>Aftermath: Donning a pair of tiny white shorts, Alexandra turned to the side while filming herself, as she displayed her slighting protruding stomach</p>

<p>'- SUPPLEMENTS. I’m not one to advocate detox teas/laxatives etc so three things that are natural and really help with the gut are Psyllium Husk, Triphala Powder &amp; Glutamine. Please do your research about each of these if you would like to know more but they have massively helped with my bowels.'</p>

<p>Despite Alexandra littering her Instagram page with several stunning bikini and fitness snaps, the reality starlet recently revealed that she is still not happy with her figure.</p>

<p>Taking part in an Instagram Q&amp;A in July, the Love Island 2018 star said: 'I don't think anyone will ever be 100000% happy with their body... we all have insecurities! </p>

<p>'I'm just proud of the strength and knowledge I've acquired through this whole process.</p>

<p>What happened next: Alexandra listed how the challenge affected her body and what she did to recover</p>

<p>'I'm in awe of what the body is capable of... how it functions... I'm in a much better place mentally and emotionally than I was so that comes before anything. Physique is a bonus.'</p>

<p>The TV personality also confessed the lack of physical connection with anyone while living alone during the COVID-19 lockdown has been difficult.</p>

<p>Addressing Instagram followers, she wrote: 'Genuine question: Singletons, how have you been finding lockdown?'</p>

<p>'I honestly can’t remember the last time I felt sexy. The lack of intimacy, connection &amp; interaction (sorry dad if you’re reading this) ...'</p>

<p>Not happy yet: Despite Alexandra littering her Instagram page with several stunning bikini and fitness snaps, the reality starlet recently revealed that she is still not happy with her figure</p>
