<p>Farm manager Suzie Delroy, who's the second generation avocado grower Delroy Orchards in Western Australia, said an avocado is touched by shoppers at least four times on average before it's purchased.</p>

<p>'There's no need to squeeze an avocado all over to find a ripe one or to make sure it's going to be good on the inside. This common mistake by Aussie shoppers can actually cause bruising and damage the fruit,' Suzie told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>A fruit grower has shared her simple tricks to picking the perfect avocado from the grocer every time - and the best way to fast track the ripening process</p>

<p>Soft and purple/black: Ready to eat</p>

<p>Firm and green/black: Ready in one to two days</p>

<p>Hard and olive green: Ready in two to three days</p>

<p>She said the best way to identify a freshly ripe avocado is by looking at the colour of the avocado skin. </p>

<p>'You can spot a ripe Hass avocado by the colour of its skin. Hass turn from green to purplish black when ripe,' she explained.</p>

<p>But if you must press, Suzie suggested pressing the avocado 'very gently' to check for ripeness.</p>

<p>'If you do want to test for ripeness with a squeeze, just press the avocado very gently near the top next to where the stem was (looks like a little button),' she said.</p>

<p>'If it gives a little, it's ripe and ready to eat. Don't squeeze it all over. This will just bruise the delicious flesh under the skin.'</p>

<p>Interestingly, avocados start to ripen once they have been harvested.</p>

<p>'Avocados don't ripen on the tree. They only ripen once picked. Which is a pretty amazing fact in itself,' Suzie said. </p>

<p>'At our orchard in Pemberton, we leave the avocados on the trees for 12 to 16 months to build up a deep, rich taste and then when they are full of flavour, we hand-pick and ripen them.</p>

<p>'At home you can ripen a firm avocado by simply leaving it on the kitchen bench for one to three days.'</p>

<p>But for those looking to speed up the process, she suggested popping the avocado in a brown paper bag along with a banana.</p>

<p>'Bananas naturally release ethylene (a natural gas found in most fruit) which fast-tracks the ripening process,' she said.</p>

<p>She said the best way to identify a freshly ripe avocado is by looking at the colour of the skin</p>

<p>The Delroy family have combined 30 years of avocado growing experience and their 'x-ray vision' to produce 'Delcado' - a new full-flavour, premium Hass avocado, which they claim is better than the other varieties on the market.</p>

<p>In fact, they are so confident, the Delcado, which is a mash-up of the Delroy family and avocado - comes with a money back guarantee.</p>

<p>'No one likes to cut open an avocado to find the inside rotten or bruised. Now, we can check the inside for any damage before the fruit leaves the packing shed,' Suzie said.</p>

<p>'By guaranteeing the quality of our avocados, we hope it reduces the need for shoppers to excessively thumb test the avocados and makes a Delcado ideal for 'contactless' avocado selection and online grocery shopping. </p>

<p>The new Delcado avocados are grown on the family's orchard in Pemberton, about one hour east of Western Australia's Margaret River</p>

<p>Store avocado at room temperature in the fruit bowl until it reaches the preferred ripeness for eating.</p>

<p>To speed up the avocado ripening process, place an unripe avocado in a brown paper bag with a banana.</p>

<p>Keeping a whole, ripe avocado in the fridge can maintain the ripeness for two to three days until its ready to eat.</p>

<p>Wrap a half-eaten avocado in cling wrap to remove any air and store in the fridge to eat later.</p>

<p>'We want to give people the confidence that if they choose a Delcado, they know it's been x-ray checked by us and carefully handled from the time it's picked to the time it gets to the store, so they know they are getting a better avocado.'</p>

<p>The x-ray like technology, known as near infrared technology, scans nearly 700 avocados per minute, photographing each avocado 26 times to capture 360-degree views.</p>

<p>Seeing inside the avocados allows the Delroys to scrutinise the fruit to check for bruises, blemishes and damage beneath the skin. It even lets them check for sunburn on the avocado flesh. </p>
