<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A kindly neighbour has drawn a race track on his driveway after a young boy kept speeding along the concrete on his balance bike. </p>

<p>Dave Phoxe, from Salt Lake City in Utah, kept getting alerts every time the boy veered into his driveway during daily walks with his family.</p>

<p>The 47-year-old decided to draw the outline of a racetrack in chalk - fit with hairpin chicanes and slow down signs. </p>

<p>As the boy went past, footage from Mr Phoxe's security camera showed him using the track to speed along.</p>

<p>The track features sudden bends and slow down signs. Each time wind and rain washed the track away, Mr Phoxe replaced it with a new one</p>

<p>Before long multiple kids - and even adults riding bikes or pushing strollers - joined in to put their skills to the test. </p>

<p>After uploading the video to his YouTube channel CanyonChasers, with a playful caption about how he deals with kids playing in his driveway, it quickly went viral with millions of views and thousands of comments praising his work. </p>

<p>He said: 'I'm a little embarrassed to admit how excited I was to see how he reacted - the video is just so cute I think he did five laps that first night. </p>

<p>'You can see that mom notices the track outline first and you can tell she's explaining it to him, and even at the distance you can totally see when it clicks, and he goes for it. </p>

<p>'A little bit of joy goes a long way - we're all quarantined, we're all frustrated and tired, wouldn't we all be just a little bit better off if we just went for a bike ride and remembered what it was like to be a kid, even if just for a few minutes?' </p>
