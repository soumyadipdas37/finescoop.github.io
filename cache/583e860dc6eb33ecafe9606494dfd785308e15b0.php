<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has found KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O show breached decency standards after it aired comments about the Virgin Mary last year.</p>

<p>The ACMA investigated the episode that aired in September 2019 after receiving 180 complaints from listeners claiming the segment was offensive.</p>

<p>The investigation found the comments made by Kyle Sandilands were 'offensive to listeners of faith but didn't incite hatred or ridicule'.</p>

<p>Breach: Communications watchdog ACMA has found Kyle Sandilands' (pictured) Virgin Mary joke breached decency standards</p>

<p>In a statement, ACMA Chair Nerida O'Loughlin said:'Australians are generally tolerant of irreverent humour and critical discussion about religion. </p>

<p>He continued: 'But they would not expect a host of a broadcast program to derisively criticise people's intelligence because of their religious beliefs.'</p>

<p>'Mr Sandilands overstepped the mark in terms of the generally accepted standards of decency in this case.'</p>

<p>Findings: The investigation found the comments made by Kyle Sandilands in 2019 were 'offensive but didn't incite hatred or ridicule'</p>

<p>On 18th September 2019, Kyle offended thousands of listeners by saying the Virgin Mary wasn't actually a virgin at all.</p>

<p>'I thought Mary was his [Jesus Christ's] girlfriend but apparently it was the mother,' he said.</p>

<p>'And the mother lied obviously and told everyone, "Nah I got pregnant by a magical ghost". Bulls**t.'</p>

<p>'Someone chock-a-blocked her behind the camel shed. You might believe everything that's written down 2,000 years ago to be absolutely accurate and good on you, you're dumb. Dumb as dog s**t.'</p>

<p>After the comments went viral, dozens of furious protesters gathered at KIIS FM's Sydney office to demonstrate against Sandilands over his 'ghastly' religious joke.</p>

<p>Comments: On September 18 last year, Kyle offended thousands of listeners by saying the Virgin Mary wasn't actually a virgin at all</p>

<p>On September 30th, Kyle issued a heartfelt apology for his controversial 'joke' about the Virgin Mary, telling listeners of his radio show, he deeply regrets what he said.</p>

<p>'I didn't realise the gravity of it. I upset a lot of people,' he said. 'Even friends of mine were like, "Bro how could you say something so dumb like that?"'</p>

<p>The KIIS FM star said that he 'only wanted to make people laugh' and emphasised the joke was 'not planned' in any way.</p>

<p>Kyle confessed that the worst part of the whole experience was that people close to him had received death threats over what he'd said on air.</p>

<p>But he made it clear to naysayers that he won't be quitting his job.</p>

<p>'I am going to quit? No. Am I going to get fired? No. Am I sorry? Absolutely I am sorry because, as I've said, I never intended to purposely upset anyone. Obviously I have upset people and I am sorry for it. There is nothing else I can do. We have all made mistakes in our life and this is just one of the many I have made,' he said. </p>

<p>Apology: At the time, Kyle issued a heartfelt apology for his controversial 'joke' about the Virgin Mary, telling listeners of his radio show he deeply regrets what he said</p>
