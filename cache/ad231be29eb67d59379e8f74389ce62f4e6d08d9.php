<p>'In her own words and song lyrics, Carey reveals untold moments and intimate experiences along with anecdotes of sacred moments with iconic figures to craft an honest, unique, and vivid portrait of her extraordinary life.'</p>

<p>Carey said on social media in July that the book would be an 'unfiltered' look at her life.</p>

<p>Mariah took to Twitter to reassure everyone that Turkey Day was still a go, and that the phrases were titles from her forthcoming book </p>
