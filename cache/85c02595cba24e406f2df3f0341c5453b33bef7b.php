<p>US experts found associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-related behaviour and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, especially phthalates.</p>

<p>Phthalates are typically added to plastics to improve their flexibility, transparency, durability and longevity. </p>

<p>According to the team, the problematic chemicals act like artificial hormones — with phthalates in particular interfering with the normal activity of androgens.</p>

<p>These 'male' hormones — which include testosterone and are found in all humans, albeit in different amounts — play a role in both male traits and reproduction.</p>

<p>ADHD in teenagers may be triggered by exposure to a group of common chemicals used in applications from food packaging and drugs to cosmetics such as shampoos, pictured</p>

<p>'Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are used in a wide variety of consumer products resulting in ubiquitous exposure,' paper author and epidemiologist Jessica Shoaff of the Harvard Medical School and colleagues wrote in their paper.</p>

<p>'The study findings suggest that exposure to some of these chemicals, particularly certain phthalates, during adolescence may be associated with behaviours characteristic of ADHD.'</p>

<p>'The identification of modifiable risk factors for ADHD is of great public health importance,' they continued. </p>

<p>In their study, Dr Shoaff and colleagues measured the chemicals found in urine samples taken from 205 adolescents.</p>

<p>They compared this analysis with the result of behavioural surveys undertaken both by each teenager, as well as their parents and their teachers.</p>

<p>From this, the team identified which of the young participants had 'significant behavioural problems' — with 40 per cent meeting this criteria and 19 per cent a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</p>

<p>'Each 2-fold increase in the sum of antiandrogenic phthalate concentrations was associated with a 1.34 increase in the risk of significant ADHD-related behaviour problems,' the researchers said.</p>

<p>The associations, the team added, 'tended to be stronger in male participants.'</p>

<p>The full findings of the study were published in the journal JAMA Network Open. </p>

<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural condition defined by inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.</p>

<p>It affects around five per cent of children in the US. Some 3.6 per cent of boys and 0.85 per cent of girls suffer in the UK. </p>

<p>Symptoms typically appear at an early age and become more noticeable as a child grows. These can also include:</p>

<p>Most cases are diagnosed between six and 12 years old. Adults can also suffer, but there is less research into this.</p>

<p>ADHD's exact cause is unclear but is thought to involve genetic mutations that affect a person's brain function and structure.</p>

<p>Premature babies and those with epilepsy or brain damage are more at risk. </p>

<p>ADHD is also linked to anxiety, depression, insomnia, Tourette's and epilepsy.  </p>

<p>There is no cure. </p>

<p>A combination of medication and therapy is usually recommended to relieve symptoms and make day-to-day life easier. </p>
