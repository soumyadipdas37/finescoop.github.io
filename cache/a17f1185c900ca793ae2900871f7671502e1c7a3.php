<p>DIY fan Harvey Singh shared snaps of his lockdown bar build in his family home, documenting the empty space's transformation - for just £300</p>

<p>Harvey revealed on the Facebook group DIY on a budget UK that he'd bought kitchen units at auction for bargain price after a kitchen company was selling off stock</p>

<p>Opening time: Using an old Stella Artois draught tap, Harvey has turned the space into a sleek-looking bar</p>

<p>After those who saw the photos of the slick-looking bar, which features up-lit spirits shelves and sleek grey cabinets, alongside an American-style fridge, asked how he managed to achieve such a high end look on a low budget, Harvey revealed his secret.  </p>

<p>He told users that he bid for two pallets of kitchen cabinets on auction site John Pye, after a kitchen company had filed for insolvency. </p>

<p>He said: 'I thought I'd try my luck and see what I get.' </p>

<p>Showing off his sense of humour, the DIY fan admitted: 'gamble paid off, not always been that lucky though' and said he'd still got '12 white wine racks' from a previous punt that hadn't gone to plan.</p>

<p>Two up-lit shelves hold an impressive array of spirits, while the cupboards hide mixers and soft drinks</p>

<p>Clean lines: An American-style fridge ensures there's ice on tap too</p>

<p>Members of the Facebook group were impressed with Harvey's use of space and lighting</p>

<p>The appreciation for the drinking den has come in thick and fast since he posted, with 610 comments and more than 3,000 likes. </p>

<p>There was a word of caution, however, from others who'd built bars in their own home. </p>

<p>Facebook user Kim Payne warned: 'Many years ago (over 30) we had a bar built in our very small lounge. </p>

<p>'Over time we realised all we were doing was paying for our mates to get sloshed Even had one complaint that we hadn’t got the spirits they fancied.'</p>
