<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>These are the photos that prove beyond doubt that rumoured Bachelor finalist Bella Varelis doesn't win Locky Gilbert's heart on the show.</p>

<p>The marketing consultant, 25, was pictured getting very flirty with ex-Bachelorette contestant Nathan Favro at the beach in Point Piper, Sydney, on Monday.</p>

<p>She seemed to be enjoying the single life as she swooned over the 25-year-old artist, before they headed into the ocean for a swim together.</p>

<p>She's not waiting for Locky! Rumoured Bachelor finalist Bella Varelis (right) was seen getting flirty with ex-Bachelorette contestant Nathan Favro (left) in Point Piper, Sydney, on Monday</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: The photos prove beyond doubt that Bella, 25, doesn't win Locky Gilbert's heart</p>

<p>While splashing around in the shallow water, at one stage Bella playfully pushed Nathan away with a cheeky smile on her face.</p>

<p>She then pointed out something in the distance, and later appeared to invite her male companion to check out the tan lines on her backside.</p>

<p>The pair were joined by fellow Bachelor contestant Bec Cvilikas, who is rumoured to place third in Locky's season after arriving late as an intruder.</p>

<p>Bella and Bec are now renting an apartment together in Bondi - a living arrangement that all but confirms neither of them wins the show.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 and Nathan Favro for comment.</p>

<p>Fans of The Bachelor franchise will remember party boy Nathan from Ali Oetjen's season of The Bachelorette in 2018.</p>

<p>He was infamously kicked off the show after Ali, 34, accused him of spreading rumours in the mansion about her sexual history.</p>

<p>He later denied starting gossip, telling Now To Love: 'We were all sitting around the pool and the topic of the rumours was brought up.</p>

<p>'A few of the boys had said what they had heard and I basically just said what I had heard.'</p>

<p>Bella is one of the front-runners on The Bachelor this year, with online betting agency Sportsbet tipping her for second place, behind Irena Srbinovska.</p>

<p>She had been an early favourite to win the season, according to bookies, but quickly fell behind nurse Irena, 31, as the season progressed.</p>

<p>In recent episodes, the former friends have clashed in the mansion as the competition for Locky's heart heats up.</p>

<p>Bella has accused Irena of being 'manipulative', but she has risked alienating Locky by sharing her concerns about her rival with him.</p>

<p>Irena is widely rumoured to win the show, and a Channel 10 spokesperson said this week that Locky is still dating his winning contestant.  </p>
