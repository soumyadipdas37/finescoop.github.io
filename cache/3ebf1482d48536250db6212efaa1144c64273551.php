<p>'Which one is you?' The Bachelor star Brittney Weldon, 26, (pictured) left fans baffled with her new face on Saturday, as she continues her incredible post-show transformation</p>

<p>Two more fans pointed out how different the reality star looked in comparison to her time on the Channel 10 show, earlier this year. </p>

<p>'Wow you look so different Brittney. I love your hair colour,' another wrote. </p>

<p>While one commented: 'U look so different Britt.' </p>

<p>Baffled: Fans couldn't help but comment about how different she looked </p>

<p>The natural-born brunette also showed off her new blonde tresses, which were curled for the group photo with the girls. </p>

<p>The reality star wore a full face of glossy make-up, along with a matte lipstick.</p>

<p>Transformed: Brittney was nicknamed 'Littney' on Bachelor in Paradise for her upbeat personality. Pictured on BiP season three</p>

<p>A cosmetic clinic praised Brittney as 'gorgeous', and she responded: 'LOVING my lips.' This appears to be the first time she has disclosed having lip filler.    </p>

<p>It comes after Brittney confirmed she was no longer dating her Paradise co-star Jackson Garlick, whom she left Fiji with to pursue a romance in the outside world. </p>

<p>She told her Instagram followers last month: 'I'm here for my final update: <?php echo e('@'); ?>jacksongarlick and I aren't together, but he is an amazing guy.</p>

<p>Blonde bombshell! Brittney seems to be loving her glamorous new look</p>

<p>'We did catch up on the outside, I did meet his friends and family, and we had good times. Unfortunately, life gets in the way, and we are now just friends. I am so happy that I had this experience and wouldn't change anything.'</p>

<p>Brittney made her Bachelor debut on season six in 2018, before appearing on season two of Paradise in 2019 and the third season the following year.</p>

<p>Despite making three appearances in the franchise, she is yet to find lasting love.  </p>

<p>Over! Brittney confirmed last month she was no longer dating her Paradise co-star Jackson Garlick (above), whom she left Fiji with to pursue a romance in the outside world</p>
