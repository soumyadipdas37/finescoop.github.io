<p>Back in February, Lauren was forced to deny claims that she had turned to porn after a popular site used her footage and claimed to be shooting with the star.</p>

<p>She appeared on the Twitter feed for the adult website Latest Clips, in a video where Lauren was shown holding her bare chest, alongside the caption: 'Finished doing [boy-girl] contents with Lauren Goodger, stay tuned.'  </p>

<p>In 2018, Lauren promised her fans she was planning on joining OnlyFans, yet just days later she was forced to admit she did not know what she was signing up for, while writing for her column since-defunct magazine Now. </p>

<p>After baffling her fans, the former TOWIE star said: 'I would never do porn. I am not judging anyone that does. But it's not something I would want to do. LOL.</p>

<p>'I just thought the fan who asked me about the 'just for the fans' on my IG, meant I would set up a page just for my fans. I didn't realise it was a bl**dy porn site.'</p>

<p>While a large number of patrons use the OnlyFans platform to share and view X-rated images, it is actually marketed as a space where content creators can further monetise their work behind a paywall.</p>
