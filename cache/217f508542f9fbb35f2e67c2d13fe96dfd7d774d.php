<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Conor McGregor has revealed he is still interested in coming out of retirement for a UFC return against veteran Diego Sanchez, as talk of a boxing clash with Manny Pacquiao intensifies. </p>

<p>The 32-year-old took to social media on Friday to share a series of screenshots of an online conversation with Dana White, in a bid to prove he has been eager to compete in the UFC.</p>

<p>However, fights have failed to materialise for McGregor, with the coronavirus pandemic meaning the UFC would lose huge amounts of money through ticket sales should the Notorious fight behind closed doors.</p>

<p>Conor McGregor is still interested in a UFC return amid talk of a Manny Pacquiao boxing bout</p>

<p>McGregor was last in action in January as he obliterated Donald Cerrone at UFC 246</p>

<p>McGregor can be seen in the messages asking White to arrange a fight between himself and Sanchez, a 39-year-old unranked lightweight. </p>

<p>White responded insisting that he would lose his promoting licence if he were to schedule that bout, given the huge discrepancy in quality between McGregor and the veteran.</p>

<p>The series of tweets were ended with McGregor revealing he is set to face Pacquiao in his second professional boxing bout, after he made his boxing debut in August 2017 in a mega-money clash with Floyd Mayweather. </p>

<p>The 32-year-old shared private messages with UFC chief Dana White over potential match-ups</p>

<p>However, McGregor says he will fight Manny Pacquiao next, and the Filipino's office confirmed </p>

<p>The Filipino's office confirmed that he would be facing McGregor next year, with proceeds going towards families of the victims of coronavirus. </p>

<p>'For the sake of all the Filipino Covid-19 victims, Senator Manny Pacquiao will be fighting UFC superstar Conor McGregor next year,' a statement read.</p>

<p>But despite McGregor's crossover to boxing, the 32-year-old is still eager to face Sanchez at some point, and confirmed on Saturday his intentions to fight the American. </p>

<p>But McGregor revealed he still wants to fight Diego Sanchez, a veteran he has called out before</p>

<p>McGregor tweeted this morning that he wants to take on the 'true warrior and pioneer'</p>

<p>'I am still interested in a fight with you somewhere down the line Diego Sanchez. A true warrior and pioneer of this sport. </p>

<p>'It would be my honour! Some journalists and promoters and their lack of respect for what the fighters put into this game make me sick. Things must change!'</p>

<p>McGregor was last in action at UFC 246 in January this year, when he obliterated Donald Cerrone in 40 seconds.  </p>
