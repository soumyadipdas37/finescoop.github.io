<p>State parliament passed new laws on Tuesday to introduce hefty penalties including lengthy prison terms for people found guilty of child sexual abuse crimes.</p>

<p>'These tough laws herald a new era of delivering justice to victims, while sending a clear message that child sexual abuse is never OK,' Queensland Attorney-General and Justice Minister Yvette D'Ath said.</p>

<p>'They create a new offence of failing to report and failing to protect a child from institutional child sexual abuse.</p>

<p>'The new laws also clarify that priests will not be able to rely on the seal of confession to avoid the reporting of abuse.'</p>

<p>The bill is in line with a recommendation from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.</p>

<p>One Nation MP Steve Andrew argued against the bill, saying it sets a 'dangerous precedent' which would lead to other professions, including lawyers, doctors and journalists, being forced to reveal confidential information.</p>

<p>'Other professions will eventually be included once we set this precedent.'</p>

<p>The law would also make it an offence to supply or create a child sex doll, with penalties of up to 20 years in prison.</p>

<p>Tuesday's parliamentary debate covered numerous issues and followed Monday's budget update in which the Palaszczuk government announced plans to increase COVID-19 spending to $11 billion to kickstart the state's stagnant economy.</p>

<p>'These tough laws herald a new era of delivering justice to victims, while sending a clear message that child sexual abuse is never OK,' Queensland Attorney-General and Justice Minister Yvette D'Ath said</p>

<p>It wants to borrow $4 billion to fund 19 economic and health measures including $500 million each for businesses and a renewable energy fund.</p>

<p>Shadow treasurer Tim Mander has labelled the appropriations bill as an 'election slush fund' and said taxpayers would be slugged with repaying the debt.</p>

<p>'The treasurer did not rule out new taxes going forward,' Mr Mander said.</p>

<p>'It is obvious that their plan in the future is what all Labor governments do - tax Queenslanders.'</p>

<p>The Sunshine State goes to the polls on October 31.Â </p>
