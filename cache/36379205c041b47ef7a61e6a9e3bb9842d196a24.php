<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eddie Nketiah's home gym has acted as the driving force behind muscling a way into the Arsenal team - and on the verge of breaking an England record.</p>

<p>The striker's hat-trick against Kosovo on Friday takes him to within two goals of matching the 13 scored by Alan Shearer at Under-21 level.</p>

<p>Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has thrust extra responsibility on Nketiah since Project Restart after the 21-year-old returned to London Colney a new man.</p>

<p>Eddie Nketiah says strength and conditioning training has contributed to his fine formÂ </p>

<p>The change has not gone unnoticed at international level by manager Aidy Boothroyd, while Nketiah could surpass Shearer's tally against Austria on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'I worked really hard on getting bigger and getting better on the ball during lockdown,' Nketiah said. 'I've used the time well and it's good people can see the hard work. My parents are very demanding who are always trying to get the best out of me.</p>

<p>'It's getting a lot harder physically so to be able to show your technique you need that level of strength to cope with it.</p>

<p>Nketiah's hat-trick against Kosovo moved him to within two goals of Alan Shearer's U21 record</p>

<p>Nketiah worked his way into Mikel Arteta's plans after the resumption to the 2019-20 season</p>

<p>'I'm definitely a better player than I was 12 months ago. I've matured a lot as a person. I've been put out of my comfort zone, I've had different tests in different environments and I've come out of it well.' England and Arsenal team-mate Reiss Nelson believes Nketiah is becoming a more complete striker.</p>

<p>'Before I felt he was coming to feet too much,' Nelson said. 'When he comes to feet, he drives the defender into him. Most of the time the defender is bigger and stronger.</p>

<p>'Now he's adapted to where he has to go in short and run in behind. He's picking the right time to go in behind defenders.</p>

<p>'When he does that, he's frightening because as soon as he gets a yard or two, he is a top finisher. When he is in front of goal, I'm sure he'll always score.'</p>
