<p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is trying to distance his party from the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. But he revealed they have one thing in common today: They are both vegetarians. </p>

<p>Sir Keir confirmed on Sky's Ridge on Sunday that he has been a vegetarian for many years, and that his wife Victoria was also one.</p>

<p>But the Opposition Leader admitted that his meat-free diet was not easy - and he still pines for bacon sandwiches and a chicken curry. </p>

<p>Mr Corbyn was famously a strict vegetarian with his own allotment who at one point said he was 'going through the process' of turning into a vegan - but stopped short of taking the full plunge.</p>

<p>Sir Keir is in good company as a fan of bacon sarnies - his predecessor Ed Miliband's time as party leader between 2010 and 2015 was overshadowed by a hugely unflattering picture of him chomping a butty in 2014.</p>

<p>The current Labour leader confirmed today that he had been given up meat years ago for health an environmental reasons, but that it was not plain sailing.</p>

<p> Sir Keir is in good company as a fan of bacon sarnies - his predecessor Ed Miliband's time as party leader between 2010 and 2015 was overshadowed by a hugely unflattering picture of him chomping a butty in 2014</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn was famously a strict vegetarian with his own allotment who at one point said he was 'going through the process' of turning into a vegan - but stopped short of taking the full plunge</p>

<p>He told Ridge: ' I gave up as a matter of principle years ago on the basis that eating meat wasn't the right thing for the body and the planet but I have to say, I miss meat.'</p>

<p>Asked what he specifically missed he looked whistful as he added: 'Oh, bacon sandwiches, chicken curry, you name it, almost everything! </p>

<p>'So, this is hard work for me but my wife has been vegetarian for many years longer than I have so ... ' </p>

<p>In 2017 Jeremy Corbyn suggested he was turning vegan after around 50 years as a vegetarian.</p>

<p>The Labour leader was speaking at an event organised by the eco-brand Lush, where he praised veganism and said he was delighted by the movement's growth.</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn was asked whether he was now planning to 'make the logical next step to veganism'.</p>

<p>The Labour leader responded: 'It's a fair question. I eat more and more vegan food, and I have more and more vegan friends, indeed there are quite a lot of vegan MPs, actually, not a lot, but there are some.</p>

<p>'I think what has improved so much is vegetarian and vegan food has got so much better in recent years.</p>

<p>'One of my close relatives has just become a vegan and I went to her house for dinner and it was absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p>'So I'm going through the process, all right? I won't go any further than that.'</p>

<p>Labour sources later emphasised that Mr Corbyn actually has no plans to cut out milk or eggs and that he was being light-hearted at the convention. Sources close to the Labour leader said he is too partial to Somerset brie to go fully vegan.</p>
