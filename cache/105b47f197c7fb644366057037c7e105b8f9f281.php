<p>Ruscoe rose to fame as part of the 'Bondi influencers' team on The Amazing Race reboot in 2019.</p>

<p>It's over: In November, Ruscoe revealed that she had separated from her boyfriend and teammate on The Amazing Race, Pierucci (pictured)</p>

<p>Ruscoe’s ex-partner and Amazing Race co-star Sidney was found guilty of common assault earlier this year, following an altercation between the pair in Bellevue Hill.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to a 12 months Conditional Release Order by a magistrate in February.</p>

<p>A Final Apprehended Violence Order was made by the court, ordering that Pierucci must not assault or threaten, stalk, harass or intimidate Ruscoe or destroy any property that belongs to her.</p>

<p>However, the pair were spotted reuniting in Bondi in April, and claim they are now on good terms as friends. </p>

<p>Case: The announcement of their split came after Pierucci was slapped with an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) after an alleged domestic violence incident involving Ruscoe</p>
