<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bitter deadbeat dad callously executed his estranged son with a hunting rifle after gunning down the teen's girlfriend in front of him.</p>

<p>Pawel 'Paul' Kłosowski, 46, shot dead Lukasz Kłosowski and Chelsea Ireland, both 19, at his house in Mount McIntyre, South Australia, on August 22.</p>

<p>The Polish immigrant had barely seen his son since his ex-wife threw him out 15 years ago and recent attempts to reconcile ended in tragedy.</p>

<p>Details of the horrific double murder can now be revealed after the truck driver pleaded guilty in Mount Gambier Magistrates Court on Monday.</p>

<p>Kłosowski, 46, (pictured) pleaded guilty to two counts of murder for shooting his estranged son and his son's girlfriend dead</p>

<p>Chelsea Ireland and Lukasz Kłosowski, both 19, were shot dead at the property in southeast South Australia during a family gathering</p>

<p>Kłosowski was hosting a family gathering at the rural home he shared with his new wife Monica, a source close to the family told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>Lukasz was known to voice his disgust at his father's 'drunken chauvinism' and a heated argument broke out around the fire drum outside.</p>

<p>He and Chelsea left to an upstairs guest room for the night, but an angry Kłosowski fetched his rifle, either a .303 or .308, and stormed in at about 11.30pm.</p>

<p>The source said Kłosowski shot Chelsea first, at close range, before turning the gun on his son and going back downstairs.</p>

<p>But several minutes later he walked back upstairs and shot Lukasz in the face to make sure he was dead.</p>

<p>'Whatever Lukasz said must have really got to him and he's stewed on it for a while then gone and popped them both,' the source said.</p>

<p>Monica and two of her three young children were awake at the time and heard the at least three shots, then witnessed the bloody aftermath.</p>

<p>Kłosowski at least saved two shattered families, plus heartbroken friends, the pain of a trial by confessing to two counts of murder just a month later.</p>

<p>Confrontation between father and son was no surprise to old friends of the hotheaded, macho firearms enthusiast.</p>

<p>'There was a lot of animosity because the kid would speak his mind to his old man about his drinking and his pig-headed attitude,' one said.</p>

<p>'He didn't like how he talked about his mother and how much of an a***ehole he was when he was drunk, either.'</p>

<p>Kłosowski even 'slapped him around' at his brother's house years earlier in another argument sparked by a Facebook post the boy made about his father's antics.</p>

<p>Lukasz's cousins intervened and Kłosowski's brother asked him to leave, an old friend recalled.</p>

<p>The young couple lived in Adelaide and were visiting Kłosowski's property, where he lives with Lukasz's stepmother Monica (pictured together), for a family gathering</p>

<p>Kłosowski and his ex-wife Magdalena broke up about 2005 when Lukasz's was four, and has since remarried with another son.</p>

<p>Photos of Lukasz about that time show him with his mother, and another clutching a decoration reading 'Sto Lat (Happy Birthday) Lukasz'.</p>

<p>Magdalena is said to have limited contact between them on account of her ex-husband's drinking, which old friends said caused frequent mayhem.</p>

<p>'His problem his whole life has been alcohol. She left him because he was a p**shead,' one said.</p>

<p>'Paul and his mates would drink vodka to oblivion every weekend. I can't tell you how many car accidents they had because they were hammered.'</p>

<p>A series of drink driving convictions followed, but Kłosowski was allowed to get his truck licence and own a gun in the past few years.</p>

<p>Friends said he was aggressive when drinking, leading to numerous drunken fights between his crew and others at the Polish club in Adelaide.</p>

<p>'Paul holds a grudge, he will never let anything go. He'll bring up little things that happened years ago,' a friend said.</p>

<p>'He had a temper and a very short fuse, which was even worse when he was drunk, you had to walk on eggshells.'</p>

<p>A friend said this behaviour did not improve with age as even in the past year he was at frequent rowdy bonfires.</p>

<p>When she was just 15 years old, Chelsea watched a YouTube video that inspired her to donate her waist-length brown locks to cancer patients</p>

<p>Lukasz, by stark contrast, was remembered by those who knew him - far better than his dad - as a funny and gentle young man with a good head on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He was studying journalism at the University of South Australia while working at KFC and was close to his childhood sweetheart Chelsea's family.</p>

<p>After years of ignoring his fatherly duties, the future kinslayer decided to get back in contact when he moved from Adelaide to Mount McIntyre and married Monica.</p>

<p>Contact was sparse and tense with Lukasz objecting to his father's boorish drunkenness. Chelsea only ever met him four times.</p>

<p>Kłosowski noted his son's absence from numerous family photos with his three stepchildren and called him 'a stubborn little s**t'.</p>

<p>Exactly what led to the final, deadly, confrontation will be detailed when Kłosowski faces the South Australian Supreme Court on November 2 for his first sentencing hearing.</p>
