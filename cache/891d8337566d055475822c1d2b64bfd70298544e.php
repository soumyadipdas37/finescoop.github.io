I was 20lb lighter than my current weight (still don't work in kg - it's still St and lbs when I went to school, still St and lbs when I was at UNI too- that's for them trolls in the back that like to tell me I lack education). </p>

<p>'Back to my point, Covid came and like the majority of the population my routine went down the drain, however I embraced it yet despised it.</p>

<p>'Swinging it back round to my point again. Photo editing. It's become so bad, my heart is bleeding for the people that truly detest their own reflection to a point they're editing their photos to resemble caricature cartoons.'</p>

<p>Victoria went on to say she has been guilty of photo editing, but 'not anymore'.</p>

<p>She said: 'The amount of life people are missing out on because they're too busy worrying about how they look is saddening. Me included. </p>

<p>The pair went public with their relationship in June, with Danny saying the mental health campaigner makes him 'the happiest man in the world.</p>
