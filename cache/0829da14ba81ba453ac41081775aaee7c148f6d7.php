<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A paedophile asked a young girl if she wanted to play a game of 'tip-tip' in the bushes before snatching and molesting her when she refused, a court has heard.</p>

<p>Sebastian Ngurruwuthun, 23, was jailed for a minimum of three years and five months in Darwin's Supreme Court this week over the brazen attack on an 11-year-old in May last year.</p>

<p>The court heard the young girl and her family met other parents and children at Nightcliff, in the city's north, to enjoy the annual Seabreeze festival, NT News reports.</p>

<p>Sebastian Ngurruwuthun, 23, has been jailed after a horrific attack on an 11-year-old girl at Sunset Park (pictured) during a family-friendly Darwin festival in May last year</p>

<p>As the parents set up a picnic, the victim and her younger sister began playing with other children in Sunset Park, at which point Ngurruwuthun started watching the group from a distance.   </p>

<p>He approached after seeing her alone and asked if she was wanted to play 'tip-tip' with him, pointing to an isolated area nearby.  </p>

<p>When the girl said no, Ngurruwuthun covered her mouth and dragged her into a shaded section of the park where he indecently assaulted her while pinning her to the ground. </p>

<p>The horrific attack ended a short time later when a heroic resident rushed over after hearing her terrified screams, scaring the attacker away. </p>

<p>In a victim impact statement tendered in court, the girl said she had feared for her life during the terrifying incident. </p>

<p>'When my mum hugged me straight after the assault, I didn’t like it, I wanted to be free,' the girl wrote.</p>

<p>'At the time of the assault, I thought I was going to be kidnapped and I was going to die. I did fight back and shout and scream but I was scared that if I hurt him too much he would hurt me worse.' </p>

<p>Ngurruwuthun pleaded  guilty to abduction and committing an act of gross indecency. </p>

<p>During sentencing, Justice Judith Kelly noted he did not appear to show any empathy for his victim and continued the assault despite her screams and obvious distress.  </p>

<p>He was sentenced to four years and ten months behind bars, but will be eligible for parole after three years and five months. </p>

<p>The young girl wrote in a victim impact statement that she was feared for her life as she was abducted and assaulted (stock)</p>
