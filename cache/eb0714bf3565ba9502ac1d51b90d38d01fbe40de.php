<p>The 35-year-old carpenter received a gentle ribbing from foremen Keith Schleiger and Dan Reilly.</p>

<p>'I just heard a little whisper, mate. He's actually a male model,' a disbelieving Keith told Dan.</p>

<p>Clearly amused by his new discovery, Keith began to sing the 1992 hit song to Luke as he walked around the construction site.</p>

<p>As Keith speculated about whether or not he gets waxed, a cheeky Luke turned around and smiled, before shaking his bottom for the camera.</p>
