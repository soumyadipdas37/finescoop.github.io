<p>Fatheha Begum Abedin was distracted because she was using her phone when she ploughed into her 61-year-old relative in the Highfields area of Leicester in February 2018.</p>

<p>But instead of stopping to help him, she kept on driving. The shocking incident was captured on CCTV and led to a high-profile police appeal to find the driver responsible.</p>

<p>Abedin began to concoct the first of a series of lies she hoped would cover up what she had done.</p>

<p>Hit-and-run driver Fatheha Begum Abedin crashed into and seriously injured an elderly man on a zebra crossing - only to learn later it was her father-in-law left lying in agony on the road</p>

<p>The 29-year-old's far-fetched stories evolved as police gathered more evidence against her, Leicester Crown Court heard.</p>

<p>Initially she insisted she was not aware of the crash, which happened in St Peter's Road on the evening of Monday, February 5.</p>

<p>Next she said she might have been involved but had suffered a partial loss of consciousness caused by an asthma attack, meaning she had no memory of the incident.</p>

<p>The incident, which was caught on CCTV, threw her father-in-law on to the bonnet of her Vauxhall Corsa and into her windscreen.</p>

<p>The force of the impact bent the wipers and shattered the windscreen.</p>

<p>She later claimed the damage had been caused by thieves breaking into the car to steal her phone, prosecutor Joey Kwong said.</p>

<p>She also tried to hide her use of the phone at the time of the crash by saying it often delayed sending messages - a contention which was refuted by an expert.</p>

<p>Mr Kwong added that Leicestershire Police later established she had deleted 32 incriminating text messages from her phone and had her windscreen repaired before police had a chance to examine it.</p>

<p>This is the shocking momentÂ Fatheha Begum Abedin hits her father-in-law on zebra crossing</p>

<p>Abedin fled the scene and later made attempts to cover up her crime as police investigated</p>

<p>The pharmacy assistant eventually ran out of lies and pleaded guilty to two offences - causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice.</p>

<p>She appeared in court on Wednesday - supported by family members including her father-in-law - to be sentenced.</p>

<p>Her family was initially unaware of what she had done but eventually learned of her involvement as the police investigation continued.</p>

<p>She was arrested and interviewed 11 days after the crash and was eventually exposed as a liar.</p>

<p>Her relatives withdrew their support for the matter being prosecuted in the courts, the court heard.</p>

<p>Before he sentenced her, Judge Robert Brown gave a chronology of the incident.</p>

<p>He said Adedin left the family home in Evington Street around 6.15pm on Monday, February 5 2018 to collect a takeaway.</p>

<p>At same time, her father-in-law left the shared home to visit a relative, who lived nearby.</p>

<p>As she made her way home she was using her mobile and went across the zebra crossing in St Peter's Road, Highfields - just at the moment her father-in-law was crossing.</p>

<p>She crashed into into him, causing a number of serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis.</p>

<p>Sentencing her, Judge Brown said: 'I'm satisfied you were using your mobile phone.</p>

<p>'You collided with and caused a serious injury to your father-in-law. He went up over your bonnet and struck your windscreen before landing in the road.</p>

<p>'I'm quite satisfied you knew full well there had been an accident. You could not have reached any other conclusion.</p>

<p>Abedin had her damaged windscreen fixed after she hit father-in-law to cover up hit and run</p>

<p>'You did not stop. You did not offer to help. Others passing by stopped to help. You carried on.'</p>

<p>The judge said a man whose car matched the one involved in the collision was arrested and spent an evening in police custody before he was ruled out of the police investigation.</p>

<p>The judge continued: 'It's apparent to me that not only did you know you had been involved in a road traffic collision, but went to considerable lengths to cover up your involvement.</p>

<p>'An innocent man was arrested and detained overnight by the police on the basis that he was thought to be the driver.</p>

<p>'Your father-in-law was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary and spent a total of 11 days there.</p>

<p>'He sits in court today and has written a statement in which he expresses - and has always felt, I am sure - his love and affection for you.</p>

<p>'He stresses your importance to him, his wife and his family in your role as carer.</p>

<p>'He has clearly in his own way forgiven you for what happened that night.</p>

<p>'If you are sent into immediate custody I must have regard to the fact that could cause yet more pain to the victim of your crime.</p>

<p>'I have no desire to cause any further pain to him, but I have a public duty today.</p>

<p>Fatheha Begum Abedin, 28, was jailed for a total of 18 months for causing serious injury by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice at Leicester Crown Court (pictured)</p>

<p>'You did just about everything in your power to avoid responsibility for your behaviour until you were forced to make the admissions you have.</p>

<p>'You have pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.</p>

<p>'This was a deliberate and sustained attempt to avoid responsibility for what you had done.</p>

<p>Abedin was jailed for six months for the dangerous driving offence and 12 months for perverting the course of justice.</p>

<p>The sentences will be served consecutively, making a total of 18 months.</p>

<p>She was also banned from driving for two years and nine months.</p>
