<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the moment a man chopping down a tree makes a monumental mistake and causes the trunk to fall through the roof of a nearby house. </p>

<p>The hapless lumberjack can be heard yelling: 'Oh, God dammit,' before launching to a string of expletives at the top of his lungs as the massive pine crashes down on a suburban street in Houston, Texas. </p>

<p>A neighbour caught the disaster on video after becoming concerned that all was not going to end well.</p>

<p>An amateur lumberjack attempted to chop down a tree in Houston, Texas </p>

<p>Unfortunately for the man, the tree fell towards a nearby house and crushed its roof</p>

<p>Though due to his ineptitude, the tree could have fallen and crushed him instead</p>

<p>Homeowner Matt Bieniek, who was at work at the time, said: 'She saw what was happening, and wanted to be ready.' </p>

<p>Unfortunately for the man, he appeared quite unaware of the works of Isaac Newton, who used a period of self isolation during the Black Death to describe the theory of gravity. </p>

<p>The worker had hoped the tree would fall away from the house, though he made a critical mistake when cutting through the trunk. </p>

<p>Instead of removing a wedge shape to encourage the tree to fall in a certain direction, he cut straight through in the hope gravity and a small rope would control the massive trunk. </p>

<p>The video shows the man attempting to pull the tree, which weighed several tonnes, away from the house.  </p>

<p>A neighbour said they started filming the felling as they knew what was going to happen</p>
