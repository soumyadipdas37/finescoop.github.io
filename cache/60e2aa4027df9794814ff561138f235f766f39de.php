<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A seven-week-old baby died as a result of asphyxia while sleeping with his mother and father, a High Court judge has heard.</p>

<p>Mr Justice Keehan was told that the little boy had suffered multiple rib fractures.</p>

<p>He said health workers had 'repeatedly' warned the couple, who have three other children, about the dangers of sleeping with babies.</p>

<p>The judge, who is based in the Family Division of the High Court, outlined detail of the case in a written ruling published on Thursday after considering evidence at a private family court hearing in London in July. The High Court is pictured above</p>

<p>Evidence showed that the baby's mother was 'extremely tired' and 'under the influence of alcohol' on the night he died in March 2019, and his father had taken cocaine.</p>

<p>Mr Justice Keehan concluded that the baby had died either because his mother or father inadvertently rolled on to him while asleep, or because he had been 'confined in a micro-climate' where the atmosphere was low in oxygen but high in carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>The judge, who is based in the Family Division of the High Court, outlined detail of the case in a written ruling published on Thursday after considering evidence at a private family court hearing in London in July.</p>

<p>He indicated that the family lived in or near Birmingham but said they could not be identified in media reports of the case.</p>

<p>Council social services bosses with responsibility for the welfare of the couple's three other children had asked him to make findings of fact about the baby's death.</p>

<p>Mr Justice Keehan said the three other children, who are aged between two and 11, had been temporarily placed with relatives pending investigations into the cause of their brother's death.</p>

<p>The judge said the three children are not at risk and can return home.</p>

<p>He added that social workers would provide support to their parents.</p>

<p>'The mother accepted that she had been repeatedly told by health professionals of the risks and dangers of co-sleeping with babies and young children and of the clear advice not to do so,' said the judge.</p>

<p>'However, the mother told me that co-sleeping with her children had worked for her and for the father; they had regularly pursued the practice with all of their children.'</p>

<p>He added: 'The death of (the baby) was entirely preventable and resulted from the parents' very ill-advised practice of co-sleeping. I accept that the parents are stricken with guilt.'</p>

<p>The judge said the baby had not died as a result of any intentional act and that the risk of the couple's three other children suffering harm in their care was, at worst, extremely low.</p>

<p>But he said the three children could suffer psychological harm if they remained separated from their parents.</p>

<p>Mr Justice Keehan said police had investigated but he gave no indication that anyone had been charged with any offence in relation to the baby's death.</p>
