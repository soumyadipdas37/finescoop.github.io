<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>In a surprising move, Cinnabon is the latest chain to join the friend chicken sandwich wars.</p>

<p>The mall treat chain known for its warm, sticky cinnamon buns announced this week that it is launching a new line of Frozen Breakfast Creations that shoppers can buy at grocery stores.</p>

<p>While the launch includes more expected items like Caramel Pecan Ooey-Gooey Rolls, there's also a new fried chicken sandwich that comes between a pair of cinnamon chip biscuits and is drizzled with cinnamon sauce. </p>

<p>Ta-da! Cinnabon is the latest chain to join the friend chicken sandwich wars. The CinnaBiscuit Chicken Sandwich comes with fried chicken, cinnamon chip biscuits, and cinnamon sauce</p>

<p>New! The chain is launching a new line of Frozen Breakfast Creations that shoppers can buy at grocery stores</p>

<p>The Cinnabon sandwich comes a year after Popeyes debuted its first-ever chicken sandwich, prompting other chains to debut their own chicken sandwich innovations.</p>

<p>Cinnabon's is certainly the most unique of the bunch — and not just because it's being marketed as a breakfast food .</p>

<p>The fried chicken is part of a savory-sweet combo thanks to the cinnamon biscuit 'buns' and drizzle. </p>

<p>The product line also includes those Caramel Pecan Ooey-Gooey Rolls, Frosting Filled CinnaPastry, and Frosted CinnaSweet Swirls.</p>

<p>On the more savory side are the Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage Bites —  cheddar pork and beef beef sausage wrapped in cinnamon dough — and the CheddarRoll Sausage &amp; Egg Sandwich — sausage and egg on a cheddar roll croissant. </p>

<p>'People are craving comfortable, convenient meals to enjoy while spending more time at home and our licensed products are a great solution for today's environment,' Dave Mikita, President of FOCUS Brands Global Channels, said in a press release.</p>

<p>Looks yummy! The product line also Frosted CinnaSweet Swirls</p>

<p>'Our mission is to give fans access to our brands in new, innovative ways and the Cinnabon Bakery-Inspired frozen breakfast creations line couldn't have launched at a better time — it's the perfect way for everyone from busy parents, to students and young professionals, to begin the day — not to mention they make great anytime treats!'</p>

<p>'At Cinnabon we are always searching for ways to satisfy guest cravings and create more ways to access the flavors our guests enjoy,' added Kristen Hartman, President, of Cinnabon. </p>

<p>'Our world famous bakeries are the heart and soul of Cinnabon but grocery products, like our frozen breakfast creations, give Cinnabon fans the chance to bring a piece of the bakery experience into their homes and provide more delicious ways to enjoy the flavors they love.'</p>

<p>The products are launching first at Walmart and will eventually roll out to other grocery stores. </p>

<p>Next up? McDonald's may finally have plans to join the fried chicken sandwich wars (pictured: the McChicken)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, McDonald's may be next to jump into the chicken sandwich fray. In July,  Business Insider reported that Micky D's is working on some new menu items for later this year — with heavy speculation that one will be a new fried chicken sandwich.  </p>

<p>'I do know that there is innovation that is planned for later this year that's going to bring some menu items on,' McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski revealed on a McDonald's earnings call while discussing plans for menu expansion. </p>

<p>While he didn't specifically say there would be a new chicken sandwich, the item has been the most buzz-worthy fast food meal since the Popeyes launch. </p>

<p>Research firm Gordon Haskett, in particular, speculated in a report obtained by Business Insider that the sandwich is forthcoming. </p>

<p>'We expect to see the new line of chicken sandwiches introduced in the fourth quarter of 2020,' the report reads.</p>

<p>It seems that franchisees have been begging the chain to add a chicken sandwich to the menu that could compete with those introduced at other fast food chains.</p>

<p>Popular: Popeyes debuted its first crispy chicken sandwich last year</p>

<p>Several urged McDonald's to 'stay focused' on developing one in a leaked email from January. </p>

<p>Must-have: The sandwich was such a phenomenon that it went on to inspire a Halloween costume from Yandy</p>

<p>This will mean even more competition for the Popeyes' chicken sandwich, which debuted last August to much fanfare.</p>

<p>Diners went wild for the sandwich when it was first released, marking the first time in 45 years that the restaurant offered a sandwich. </p>

<p>Restaurants almost immediately sold out of the in-demand sandwich, leaving furious customers complaining on social media.</p>

<p>In late August, an irate Popeyes customer climbed through a drive-thru window before brawling with three employees when he learned the sandwich was sold out. </p>

<p>And Craig Barr, of East Ridge, Tennessee filed a $5,000 lawsuit against the fast food chain alleging false advertising' and 'deceptive business practices' by the company because he couldn't get his hands on their famous chicken sandwich. </p>

<p>The sandwich was such a phenomenon that it went on to inspire a Halloween costume from Yandy. </p>

<p>It also kicked off a war with other fast food chains who all claimed that they had better chicken sandwiches.</p>
