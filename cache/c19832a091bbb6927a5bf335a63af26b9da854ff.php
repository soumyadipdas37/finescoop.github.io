<p>There were traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system, a post-mortem examination found.</p>

<p>A Malaria drug was also found, a disease he contracted in Sierra Leone in his post-military career. </p>

<p>His family were 'scared of his behaviour' in recent years and he was getting gradually further into debt.</p>

<p>He had made two previous suicide attempts, both in 2019, the Daily Post reported. </p>

<p>Mel B earlier told The Mirror: 'I talked a lot to Ash about PTSD. I suffer from it as a result of an emotional abusive marriage and he suffered from it as a result of what he went through and what he saw in war zones.'

<p>A funeral notice said he was a 'cherished husband of Katie, much loved son of Melvin and Amanda, dear step-son of Claire, [and] loving brother of Amy and Thomas'  </p>
