<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The tax office has clawed back $75million in a crackdown on JobKeeper fraudsters.</p>

<p>More than 9,000 tip-offs were received by the Australian Tax Office about businesses that took the government handouts when they were not entitled to them, a parliamentary committee hearing heard on Thursday.</p>

<p>To be eligible for their slice of the $54billion scheme, employers needed to prove their profit fell during coronavirus lockdown against a comparable period. </p>

<p>The flat payment for businesses amount to $1,500 per fortnight, per employee until September 28.</p>

<p>According to Jeremy Hirschhorn, the ATO Second Commissioner, the tax body is now attempting to recoup millions of dollars from false claims. </p>

<p>He said about $60million was paid back 'voluntarily', while a further $15million was 'forced' back.</p>

<p>'We have a smaller number of matters that are going to the police and via the serious financial crimes task force,' he said, according to The West Australian.  </p>

<p>Mr Hirschhorn also explained the tax body has also paused 75,000 JobKeeper applications for some that were thought to be ineligible for compliance reasons.</p>

<p>While 55,000 applications were stopped in the system before the application was made, about 15,000 were found to be ineligible. </p>

<p>Some of the compliance issues involved employers trying to make multiple claims in the hopes they would win multiple payments.</p>

<p>No fines have been issued for offending employers, but Mr Hirschhorn said penalties would likely be imposed.</p>

<p>The hearing also revealed that, of the half-a-million people who drained their superannuation funds to survive the pandemic, 12,000 tried to claim tax deductions.</p>

<p>'We have written to them advising them that there's the potential application of anti-avoidance rules and that they might want to consider their position in their next tax return in terms of claiming a deduction in terms of that contribution.'</p>

<p>Of the people who made use of the early access scheme, about 60 per cent used the money to pay for everyday expenses.</p>

<p>From September 28, JobKeeper payments will fall to $1,200 a fortnight for full-time workers.</p>
