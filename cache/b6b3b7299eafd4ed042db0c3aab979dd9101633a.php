<p>In last night's episode of the ITV quiz show, retired science teacher Pat Lucas (pictured), from Lincoln, failed to identify a toxic chemical symbol</p>

<p>Viewers were quick to take to Twitter to express their outrage after the retired science teacher got the 'easy' chemistry question wrong (pictured)</p>

<p>In response to the £4, 000 question, Pat was presented the following options: A) Toxic, B) Corrosive, C) Hazardous to the environment, and D) Flammable.</p>

<p>'Okay... Being a science teacher I see a lot of this symbol, you'd think I would have paid more attention to it,' she said, before asking: 'Erm, can i use my 50:50 please?'</p>

<p>Following the lifeline, Pat was left with just A and C, and admitted: 'I wish one of the others was gone, I am sure it means hazardous to the environment.</p>

<p>'So I will go for hazardous to the environment, final answer.'</p>

<p>In response to the £4, 000 question, Pat was presented the following options: A) Toxic, B) Corrosive, C) Hazardous to the environment, and D) Flammable (pictured)</p>

<p>Taking to Twitter, one person penned: 'The kids at school will be giving her plenty of stick' (pictured)</p>

<p>Breaking the bad news the retired science teacher, Jeremy said: 'Well you are a science teacher, so you could have got that right... But I'm afraid you didn't.</p>

<p>'You've just lost £1,000, I'm sorry about that I really am, I hope you had a nice minute or two in the chair.'</p>

<p>And those who tuned in were baffled that Pat answered incorrectly. </p>

<p>'Can't get over that retired science teacher not knowing what the toxic symbol was,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'No wonder no kids are interested in science if the science teacher does not know what the toxic symbol is. Despised that subject yet even I knew that WITHOUT the options.'</p>

<p>A third added: A "science teacher"....obviously skipped the health and safety training,' while a fourth commented: 'Science teacher who doesn't know the 'Toxic' warning symbol even on 50:50 The kids at school will be giving her plenty of stick.'</p>
