<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Serena Williams moved into the third round of the US Open and a step closer to the magic 24.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old American battled past Russian world number 117 Margarita Gasparyan 6-2 6-4 on Arthur Ashe.</p>

<p>Williams requires one more grand slam to equal Margaret Court's singles record, but has been stuck on 23 titles since winning the 2017 Australian Open.</p>

<p>Serena Williams looked delighted as she overcame Margarita Gasparyan 6-2 6-4</p>

<p>The American legend is chasing down Margaret Court's Grand Slam record of 24</p>

<p>But the field has been decimated by withdrawals coupled with the shock defeat suffered by top seed Karolina Pliskova on Wednesday. </p>

<p>So Williams has an increasingly clear run to a seventh Flushing Meadows crown.</p>

<p>She will meet fellow American and former champion Sloane Stephens, who beat Olga Govortsova 6-2 6-2, in round three.</p>

<p>'I'm just happy to get through and try to focus on the next round,' said Williams.</p>

<p>'Sloane is such a good player, she plays so smooth. She looks like she is not taking a lot of energy and then suddenly bam! Five winners.' </p>

<p>Williams will take on Sloane Stephens in the first round and is familiar with her game </p>

<p>Williams saw off the Russian world number 117 with an impressive display of power </p>

<p>The players touched rackets after their hard-fought match on Arthur Ashe</p>
