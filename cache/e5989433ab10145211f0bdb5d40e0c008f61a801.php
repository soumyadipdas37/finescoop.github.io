<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eagle-eyed Bachelor fans have noticed a telling clue that strongly suggests Bella Varelis doesn't win Locky Gilbert's heart.</p>

<p>As reported by New Idea, viewers have observed that one particular detail seals a contestant's fate even before the first episode has aired.</p>

<p>As a general rule, when a woman is the very first to be introduced to the public - either in trailers or via social media - she ends up being the heartbroken runner-up.</p>

<p>Is her fate sealed? Eagle-eyed Bachelor fans have noticed a telling clue that strongly suggests Bella Varelis (left) doesn't win Locky Gilbert's (right) heart</p>

<p>Every year, Channel 10 introduces viewers to the contestants one by one or in batches, and the first to be shown usually goes far in the competition.</p>

<p>But crucially they never actually win the Bachelor's heart.</p>

<p>One notable example is Abbie Chatfield, who was the first woman to be introduced during Matt Agnew's season last year in her memorable 'I'm a Gemini' TV spot.</p>

<p>She ended up placing second to Chelsie McLeod. </p>

<p>Theory: As a general rule, when a woman is the very first to be introduced to the public - either in trailers or via social media - she ends up being the heartbroken runner-up. On July 25, several weeks before the season premiere, Bella was among four bachelorettes introduced on The Bachelor's official Instagram account (pictured)</p>

<p>Doomed from the start? That same month, She was also the first woman to have a dedicated promo showing her red carpet entrance</p>

<p>Third-place contestant Tara Pavlovic was also the first to be shown in promos during Matty Johnson's season, as was Brooke Blurton from Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins' season, who chose to leave before the finale.</p>

<p>And who was the first of Locky's ladies to be introduced this year? Bella Varelis.</p>

<p>On July 25, several weeks before the season premiere, Bella was among four bachelorettes introduced via The Bachelor's official Instagram account.</p>

<p>Notably, her photo was the first image in the slideshow. </p>

<p>Pattern: Every year, Channel 10 introduces viewers to the contestants one by one or in batches, and the first to be shown usually goes far in the competition - but crucially they never actually win the Bachelor's heart. Pictured: Locky's top four (L-R) Izzy Sharman-Firth, Irena Srbinovska, Bec Cvilikas and Bella Varelis</p>

<p>First girl curse? One notable example is Abbie Chatfield, who was the first woman to be introduced during Matt Agnew's season last year in her memorable 'I'm a Gemini' TV spot. She ended up placing second to Chelsie McLeod</p>

<p>That same month, She was also the first woman to have a dedicated promo showing her red carpet entrance.</p>

<p>She was shown stepping out of the limousine and strolling over to Locky, who was almost speechless and said: 'Sorry, I just got lost in your eyes.'</p>

<p>According to Sportsbet, Irena Srbinovska is the bookies' favourite to win ($1.30) as of Tuesday afternoon, while Bella is tipped for runner-up ($3.50).</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>

<p>Other examples: Third-place contestant Tara Pavlovic (left) was also the first to be shown in promos during Matty Johnson's season, as was Brooke Blurton (right) from Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins' season, who chose to leave before the finale</p>
