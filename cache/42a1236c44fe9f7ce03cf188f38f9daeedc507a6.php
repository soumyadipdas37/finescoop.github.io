<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Robert Mueller's top deputy has torn into James Comey and called his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation 'dangerous'.</p>

<p>Andrew Weissmann said that the former FBI director was guilty of 'personal recklessness' over his public announcements about the case.</p>

<p>In his memoir, Weissmann, who headed up one of the teams on the Special Counsel's investigation, says that Comey 'violated the rights of the American electorate'.</p>

<p>He recounts that when Comey reopened the investigation into Clinton's emails just days before the 2016 election, a senior FBI agent cried and told him: 'Comey just threw the reputation of the Bureau under the bus. It will take years before we recover'.</p>

<p>The criticism from Weissmann shows the depth of anger at Comey among some of the nation's top law enforcement officials.</p>

<p> Robert Mueller's top deputy Andrew Weissmann (left) claims James Comey's (right) handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation was 'dangerous'</p>

<p>Then-FBI director Comey reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails just before the 2016 election, just to close it a week later. Clinton is pictured making her concession speech after losing the election to Trump </p>

<p>In July 2016 Comey publicly rebuked Clinton in an extraordinary press conference as he closed the criminal investigation into her use of a private email server.</p>

<p>He ticked off the former Secretary of State for being 'extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information'.</p>

<p>Comey reopened the investigation in October only to close it a week later, a move which Democrats say handed the election to Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The book titled 'Where Law Ends: Inside the Mueller Investigation' gives an unprecedented look at the almost two-year long inquiry</p>

<p>In 'Where Law Ends: Inside the Mueller Investigation', Weissmann says he is 'no fan of Jim Comey' and says he 'didn't feel any great personal outrage' when he heard Trump had fired him in May 2017.</p>

<p>Among senior FBI agents, Comey's handling of the case was considered 'outlandish' because 'disclosing a personal opinion treads on the accused's presumption of innocence', Weissmann writes.</p>

<p>Reopening the investigation in October 2016 and telling Congress was 'less warranted and even more dangerous'.</p>

<p>Instead Comey should have seen if there were any new emails and reported back to Congress if there were - and only then.</p>

<p>The FBI's rules state that making such comments so close to an election were not allowed, regulations which were in place to 'guide us away from mistakes and personal recklessness'.</p>

<p>Weissmann wrote: 'You don't simply start winging it when thorny dilemmas arise'.</p>

<p>Comey feared the disclosure by Comey would reflect poorly on the bureau for not pursuing these emails previously, Weissmann claims.</p>

<p>His theory is backed up by a recent book from the FBI agent who found the emails that led to the Clinton investigation being reopened.</p>

<p>John Robertston wrote that he grew exasperated when the Bureau did nothing for months despite him telling his superiors about the new emails.</p>

<p>As Weissmann sees it, when Comey reopened the inquiry he 'misled the American electorate and dangled the possibility that some new trove of incriminating evidence had just been unearthed'.</p>

<p>Democrats say Comey's move to reopen the Hillary Clinton email investigation handed the election to Donald Trump</p>

<p>In his new book, Weissmann said Comey 'violated the rights of the American electorate' and 'threw the reputation of the FBI under the bus'</p>

<p>He writes: 'By smearing Clinton twice before the election Comey violated Clinton's rights and those of the American electorate.</p>

<p>'I never discussed this with Mueller but I knew he would concur'.</p>

<p>The Special Counsel's investigation was set up to examine whether Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election and obstructed justice by, among other things, firing Comey.</p>

<p>Weissmann headed up 'Team M' as part of the Mueller investigation, which was tasked with investigating Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort</p>

<p>Mueller concluded that there was not enough evidence to show collusion and while he made no determination on obstruction, he said he was unable to 'exonerate' the President.</p>

<p>In an unusual move, Mueller left it up to Attorney General William Barr - a close Trump ally - to decide if there should be criminal charges and he declined to bring them.</p>

<p>Weissmann headed up 'Team M' which was tasked with investigating Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort.</p>

<p>The other teams were 'Team R', which looked at Russian interference, and 'Team 600' which looked at obstruction of justice.</p>

<p>Weissmann reveals details about the first draft of the letter that Trump drew up explaining why he fired Comey.</p>

<p>A colleague brought it to him and said: 'Read this, it's tinfoil helmet material'.</p>

<p>Weissmann describes it as 'paranoid, unstructured ravings you'd expect to hear from unhinged litigants representing themselves in court'.</p>

<p>The book says: 'It was excruciatingly juvenile, disorganized, and brimming with spite - incoherent and narcissistic. You could almost feel the spittle coming off the paper'.</p>

<p>In extracts of the book already made public, Weissmann said Mueller was too timid to write in the final report that Trump obstructed justice even though the evidence proved he did.</p>

<p>Robert Mueller found enough evidence in his investigation that Donald Trump obstructed justice but 'did not deliver what he was tasked with doing', Weissmann claims in his book.  Mueller said he 'stands by those decisions and by the conclusions of our investigation'</p>

<p>Weissmann claimed that it was 'obvious' that Trump was guilty but Mueller utterly failed the American people by not saying so.</p>

<p>The Special Counsel's office didn't subpoena Trump because they were afraid of upsetting the White House, he claims.</p>

<p>For the same reason they didn't subpoena Donald Trump Jr. about his notorious June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer offering dirt on Clinton.</p>

<p>They didn't even ask to speak to Ivanka Trump for fear of incurring the President's wrath, Weissmann wrote, a decision he saw as 'sexist'.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Robert Mueller released a statement pushing back at Weissmann's claims and standing by the conclusion of the investigation.   </p>

<p>'It is not surprising that members of the Special Counsel's Office did not always agree, but it is disappointing to hear criticism of our team based on incomplete information,' Mueller said, adding the the team functioned 'knowing that our work would be scrutinized from all sides.'</p>

<p>'When important decisions had to be made, I made them,' Mueller said. 'I did so as I have always done, without any interest in currying favor or fear of the consequences. I stand by those decisions and by the conclusions of our investigation.' </p>

<p>Mueller left it up to Attorney General William Barr - a close Trump ally - to decide if there should be criminal charges and he declined to bring them. Weissmann writes that he and his team were 'played by the attorney general' </p>

<p>In the book, Weissmann spends pages talking about his shock at Barr's handling of the case, especially the four page summary of the report's findings.</p>

<p>He writes: 'It was obvious Barr had spun out findings for political gain, at best, and lied for the President, at worst'.</p>

<p>Weissmann talks about his 'disbelief and alarm' at the letter which was 'just as pernicious for what it omitted'.</p>

<p>He writes: 'I could not fathom that our work over the past 22 months was ending like this….we had just been played by the attorney general'.</p>

<p>Weissmann calls Barr's handling of the case a 'dereliction of duty' that was worse than financial watchdogs failing to report fraudulent energy company Enron, a case he worked on, because it 'struck at America's core democratic architecture'.</p>
