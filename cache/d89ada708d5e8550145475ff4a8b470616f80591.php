<p>Tricky start: Steph McGovern's day-time TV show Packed Lunch has been hit by a ratings blow just weeks after it relaunched  </p>

<p>Although boasting a range of big-name guests, such as Vogue Williams, Oti Mabuse and Chris Kamara, Packed Lunch is competing against well established show Loose Women on ITV.</p>

<p>A source said: 'It was a tough call to go up against such an established and well-loved show as Loose Women and there's no doubt the decision is hurting C4 and these ratings show it.'</p>

<p>However Channel 4 said: 'On Tuesday Steph's Packed Lunch attracted an average audience of 87,000 viewers from 12.30pm – 2.10pm and drew 204,000 at its peak. </p>

<p>'Steph has brought a blast of energy to our daytime line-up and we're delighted with the live shows the team has produced.'</p>

<p>Getting started: The show, which is filmed from a studio in Leeds, didn't have any viewers at 12.56pm according to Barb rating figures (Steph is pictured on the set of her show)</p>

<p>It is thought that Loose Women had a high of a million viewers on the same day.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Channel 4 for a comment.</p>

<p>Steph has previously spoken about being 'nervous' ahead of fronting her show and revealed that she'd blame herself if it didn't do well.</p>

<p>She said: 'But yeah, when your name's on the tin, there's no one else to blame if it's rubbish. If it's rubbish, it's my fault.' </p>

<p>Packed Lunch is filmed from a Channel 4 studio in Leeds and also sees a host of top chefs rustling up delicious lunchtime treats, including Jack Stein, Doctor Rupy Aujla and former Great British Bake Off winner John Whaite.</p>
