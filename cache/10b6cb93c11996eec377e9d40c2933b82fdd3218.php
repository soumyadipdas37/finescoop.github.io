<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you want to create sleek, poker-straight hair or even just looking to flatten out any crimps or flyaways for low maintenance styling, then a pair of hair straighteners are a valuable hair tool. </p>

<p>Proving that top-rated beauty tools don't have to break the bank, the Remington Shine Therapy Advanced Ceramic Hair Straighteners are now on Amazon for just £25.74. An impressive saving of 68 per cent, you can now snap them up for £54 less than the RRP. Bargain. </p>

<p>With over 4,700 ratings and a near-perfect score of 4.6 out of 5, the straighteners are a very popular and highly-rated choice. And they've even been compared to the iconic GHD's but at a fraction of the cost. </p>

<p>You can now grab the highly-rated Remington Shine Therapy Advanced Ceramic Hair Straighteners for only £25.74 on Amazon </p>

<p>While the Dyson Coralle is the new launch that everyone is talking about, it will set you back a whopping £399. While it admittedly it comes with impressive features that can't be found in the Remington, the bank-breaking price tag is enough to put anyone off. </p>

<p>While it may not have the cordless features of the Dyson, the Remington Shine Therapy Straighteners can't be beaten on cost and gives higher-priced models a serious run-for-their-money. </p>

<p>Unlike traditional hair straighteners, the Remington Shine Therapy Advanced Cermanic Hair Straighteners are infused with special Micro Conditioners that give your hair a beautiful shine whilst styling. If you want smooth, glossy looking hair, then this is the tool for you. </p>

<p>'Easy to use and straighten my hair brilliantly even on a very low temperature. They really do add shine and softness to my frizzy, over dry hair too, even hiding the split ends. Wish I'd bought them a long time ago.'</p>

<p>Shoppers have even compared the performance and quality to the GHD's, which priced at £109, is a far more expensive option. </p>

<p>'Remmington straighteners are fantastic, every bit as good as GHD's, in my opinion, better. The fact you can change the temperature so easily on the digital screen is a great bonus, you find you don't actually need the straighteners as hot as you think you do to get good results, meaning less damage to your hair. I've had two sets of GHD's before moving on to Remmington; I wouldn't change brands now.'</p>

<p>Another agreed, writing: 'Wow, what can I say so much better than ghd good quality for the price I'm so in love.'</p>

<p>The straighteners are infused with Moroccan Argan Oil known for its shine enhancing properties, as well as Vitamin E which conditioners and moisturisers</p>

<p>Thanks to the argan oil-infused plates, many shoppers have noticed less snagging and pulling, so it's a great tool for those who are looking to combat already dry and brittle hair. What's more, with its nine different temperate settings, you can tailor the heat to suit your hair type.</p>

<p>'I ordered when they were on offer just to try as GHDs are so expensive, definitely glad I brought these instead. They heat up high enough for my hair which is frizzy, and I can straighten my hair in about 10 mins (brilliant for morning school runs). And my hair actually feels and looks in better condition.' </p>

<p>While the Remington is sleek and slim, the narrow plates might mean that it takes longer to get through thicker, curlier hair. Regardless of your hair type, with temperatures reaching as high as 230 degrees, it's important to use heat spray first to keep your tresses protected. </p>

<p>'I have fine, rather frizzy hair and doubted that much of an improvement could be made although I had never used straighteners before. I was so wrong! These straighteners make my hair look smooth and sleek. I am genuinely impressed. After using the straighteners my hair looks like I've just come out of the hairdressers.' </p>
