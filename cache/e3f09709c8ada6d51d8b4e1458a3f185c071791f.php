<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Macabre new evidence has come to light that one of Russia's most notorious Neo-Nazi leaders was murdered in his cell, his father and lawyer claim.</p>

<p>Officials in Russia say that  Maxim Martsinkevich, nicknamed Tesak - which means  Machete, committed suicide in his cell in a Urals detention centre.</p>

<p>The authorities claim that he committed suicide by asphyxia. The 36-year-old anti-gay ultra-nationalist was found dead last week.</p>

<p>Maxim Martsinkevich, nicknamed the Machete, was found dead in a Russian prison cell last week</p>

<p>His father Sergey though has highlighted 'disturbing' new details about the death.</p>

<p>He said: 'I examined the body. It really was murder.</p>

<p>'There were traces of torture, two toenails torn off, there was an injection…. Do not believe this was suicide.'</p>

<p>The body was found on the lower bunk in the cell. Sergey claimed that his son's arms had been twisted before death. </p>

<p>The upper bunk in the cell was daubed with blood and the words 'Tesak died here.'</p>

<p>Maxim Martsinkevich's body was found in a blood splattered prison cell in the Urals last week</p>

<p> Lawyer Ivan Sidorov said that the whole cell was covered in blood.</p>

<p>Yet one of several 'suicide notes' by Martsinkevich said that he could not walk at the time of his death. All of the notes were also dated October 2020. </p>

<p>Mir Sidorov said: 'So Maxim got up and wandered around?</p>

<p>'Suicides don't do that. They usually hide quietly under the sheet. There are a lot of strange and incomprehensible aspects.' </p>

<p>A handwriting expert has claimed that one of the notes was in a women's writing. While the time of death on the official certification does not match the original statement by the authorities.</p>

<p>One inconsistency shows that the Neo-Nazi refused breakfast in jail when, by official documents, he was already dead.</p>

<p>Martsinkevich was listed as a criminal leader and an escape risk and was supposed to be monitored every 30 minutes Sergey and Mr Sidorov say.</p>

<p>Yet the CCTV cameras in his cell were not working on the night that he died, they said.</p>

<p>The lawyer added that the prison chief was 'very embarrassed' that gruesome pictures of the corpse showed the Neo-Nazi wearing ear plugs when he died.</p>

<p>He said: 'No explanation has been given.'</p>

<p>Lawyer Ivan Sidorov, left, and Martsinkevich's father, Sergey Martsinkevich, right, dispute how the prisoner died</p>

<p>Martsinkevich was in transit to Moscow for a court hearing at the time of his death. </p>

<p>The Neo-Nazi had stated previously that 'If suddenly I slash my veins or hang myself while in transit, know that I was helped. Strongly.'</p>

<p>His family are demanding an independent investigation into the death.</p>

<p>Martsinkevich had been the leader of the extremist group Format 18.</p>

<p>He had also founded the homophobic group Occupy Paedophilia which set out to cure homosexuals. </p>

<p>This organisation lured gay men to sex meetings with teenage boys. It then filmed attacks on them at the 'meeting' including covering them with urine.</p>

<p>Martsinkevich also faced claims that he outed LGBT teens to their schools, parents and friends which led some to commit suicide.</p>

<p>The thug had fled to Cuba but he was extradited back to Russia.</p>

<p> He was jailed for ten years for 'banditry and hooliganism' after a vigilante campaign where alleged drugs suppliers were attacked with metal bats, pepper spray and electric shockers.</p>

<p>He had three prior convictions relating to extremism and inciting hatred and ran far-right youth groups and posed with swastikas.</p>

<p>The Russian Investigative Committee has denied he was murdered.</p>

<p>Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for the committee, said: 'One can say with confidence that Martsinkevich left suicide notes and committed suicide.</p>

<p>'He had a very serious motive to kill himself.'</p>

<p>She added that he had expected parole in several years but new charges meant he would have stayed in prison much longer.</p>
