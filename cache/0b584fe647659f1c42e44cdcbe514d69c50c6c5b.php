<p>Mourinho is desperate to strengthen his armoury in attack and provide back up for Harry Kane, who scored 18 goals last season. </p>

<p>Although the 57-year-old Tottenham boss did admit that the club are not in a position to 'go into the market and spend a fortune on players.'   </p>

<p>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is confident he will sign a striker in the transfer window</p>

<p>The Portuguese manager said 'I want a striker,' at a news conference ahead of Spurs' Premier League opener against Everton on Sunday. </p>

<p>He went on to say: 'But I want to make it very clear that the club - if you want to call it the club or the structure above me - knows I need a striker and they also want a striker.</p>

<p>'I believe we will get a striker, I honestly believe so.</p>

<p>'The team needs it for the balance of the squad. In this moment the squad is getting very balance and we have different options for different positions.  </p>

<p>He is desperate to strengthen his attack and provide back up for their star striker Harry Kane</p>

<p>The Tottenham boss did say he is in a similar position to Jurgen Klopp and can't spend loads</p>

<p>'Especially after the gift that we had from UEFA and EFL that gives me after 20 years of football a unique experience of playing Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday for two consecutive weeks.</p>

<p>'We realise now more than ever that we need that balance.</p>

<p>'The other day Jurgen Klopp said Liverpool is not a club of oligarchs or belonging to countries. We are the same so we are not the kind of club that can go to the market and spend a fortune on players.' </p>

<p>Tottenham fans have, however, put Daniel Levy under pressure to provide their team with a talented enough to help them in the Premier League, Europa League, and other cup competitions.</p>

<p>Should Kane be absent due to injury, Tottenham need a strong attacking option that can come off the bench and score goals in his place.  </p>

<p>The England striker would also benefit from some competition at training during his time at Tottenham. </p>

<p>As it stands, Mourinho has only added only Matt Doherty, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Joe Hart to his ranks during the summer transfer window. </p>
