<p>'I love stopping on my 12 mile bike rides to enjoy some of my fantastic memories,' he captioned the image. 'When I ride by the original Gold's where we shot Pumping Iron in 1975, I can almost hear the weights clanging around and smell the sweat.</p>

<p>'I can feel the joy of the friendships I built here. It's so important to remember where you came from, and all of the people who helped you along the way.'</p>
