<p>NXIVM cult leader Keith Raniere's lawyers have claimed in court papers that he didn't need to enslave women to have sex because 'many' were already interested in him. </p>

<p>Raniere is awaiting sentencing on charges including sex trafficking of children, conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit forced labor. He ran the NXIVM sex cult, enticing a collection of women including some famous actresses and heiresses, who he branded and manipulated. </p>

<p>He maintains his innocence and said in his court records last week that he stood by everything he has ever done which he thinks includes helping people achieve 'happiness'.</p>

<p>Among the other comments from his lawyers in their 86-page memorandum is that he did not need to recruit women for sex or to manipulate them because he attracted so many other women on his own. </p>

<p>'Raniere had been in intimate relationships with six of the eight first-line DOS members, many of them for many years. </p>

<p>'As his personal history to this point made clear, there were many women who took an interest in Raniere in various ways, including wanting to pursue an intimate relationship. </p>

<p>'He certainly did not need DOS to have sex partners,' they said, using the alternative name for the cult. </p>

<p>They also claim that it is not true women were branded against their will and that they 'absolutely' knew they were going to be brandished and wanted to be.  </p>

<p>'He remains proud to have played a role in helping people achieve greater happiness and better lives.</p>

<p>NXIVM cult victims were brandished with this symbol. Raniere said those who got it did so of their own volition </p>

<p>Among the women involved was actress Allison Mack</p>

<p>'He remains proud to have been permitted to play a part in helping citizens and residents of Mexico strive to bring peace to a country beset by violent gangs, kidnappings and murders, a struggle that continues to the present and that will continue into the future. </p>

<p>'He also remains proud that he and others helped people with Tourette’s syndrome to be able to minimize or eliminate the symptoms of this difficult condition. </p>

<p>'Simply put, he remains proud of his life’s work.</p>

<p>'He also remains determined to fight this case, which he views as a terrible injustice and, respectfully, an affront to what should be one of the great systems of Justice to ever exist,' his lawyers wrote. </p>

<p>Raniere's attorneys are asking that he be sentenced to 15 years behind bars. </p>

<p>Prosecutors want to see him jailed for life and say that it is worrying he has still not shown any remorse for his actions. </p>
