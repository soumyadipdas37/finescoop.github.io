<p>A $23.99 bottle of Shiraz has been crowned the best red wine in Australia after beating more than 400 rivals at a prestigious awards show</p>

<p>'The Barossa is the home of Shiraz in Australia, so to win any award for a Shiraz from the regional Barossa Wine Show is an incredible honour,' winemaker Richard Quodling said.</p>

<p>'A wine is not only an expression of grapes and terroir by a winemaker. It takes an entire team to make a great wine, from viticulturists, growers and lab technicians to cellar hands and packaging teams - so we are all excited and will be celebrating this weekend.'</p>

<p>Judge Nick Ryan described the quality drop as 'utterly delicious'.</p>

<p>'[This wine is] plush, fragrant, deeply flavoured, utterly delicious, incredible drinkable. A fantastic result for the people's wine,' he said.</p>

<p>The Cat Among the Pigeons Fat Cat Grenache 2019 also took out a gold medal in the awards show. </p>

<p>The annual Barossa Wine Show, first held in 1977, is seen as a 'showpiece' of the region's very best wines. </p>

<p>Wine aficionados have shared glowing reviews on the red wine, describing it as 'smooth', 'excellent', 'delicious' and great value for money.</p>

<p>'True to it's regionalism and great value. If you're considering paying $35-$40 for a Barossa shiraz, put that bottle down and pick up a Fat Cat,' one said.</p>

<p>Another added: 'I am a beginner for red wine. Fat Cat was suggested by a colleague saying this is a good start for a beginner to fall in love with red wines, which is true. Looking forward to my next bottle of wine.'</p>

<p>A third said: 'Awesome red with a very high level of berries and it has very beautiful Barossa smell.'</p>
