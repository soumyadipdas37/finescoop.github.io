<p>Philip Tarver, 47, put Angela Tarver's head in the freezer because he 'couldn't bear to look at her,' the Old Bailey heard.</p>

<p>Tarver, who was wearing a see-through negligee, sliced off the finger on which his mother wore her wedding and maternity rings and put it in the kettle, prosecutors claim.  </p>

<p>The court heard he then turned on his father Colin Tarver, 83, with a 'demented look' in his eyes and threatened to kill him during the rampage in their family home in Woking, Surrey.</p>

<p>But the pensioner managed to wrestle the weapon away from his son and call the police, the Old Bailey was told.</p>

<p>Tarver, who had lived with his parents in the four-bedroom property most of his life, bought six cans of beer and a bottle of vodka with their money on December 18 last year.</p>

<p>He came downstairs in a transparent floral nightgown the following morning and claimed the drinks had been 'poisoned' before unplugging the phone and television.</p>

<p>His father was reconnecting the cables in the living room when he heard a scream and saw his wife's feet lying motionless on top of an upended chair on the kitchen floor, prosecutors claim.</p>

<p>Mrs Tarver, who had a stroke in 1991 which left her struggling to speak and using a Zimmer frame to help with her mobility.</p>

<p>Tarver later told police he wanted to 'put her out of her misery' after he came downstairs and thought she looked 'half-dead' as she sat at the kitchen table, the court heard.</p>

<p>The killer said to officers after his arrest that he had struggled with his sexuality since he was five and dressed in women's clothing, the court heard.</p>

<p>Tarver said he greeted his father wearing the see-through negligee earlier in the morning to which Mr Tarver responded: 'Oh no, you're dressed like that again,' jurors were told.</p>

<p>Grey-haired and bespectacled Colin Tarver appeared in the witness box on Thursday wearing a black suit as his son sat in the dock.</p>

<p>Giving evidence the widower said his late wife had mainly used written notes to communicate with people after suffering a 'severe' stroke when she was in her 50s.</p>

<p>Ms Healy asked: 'Had he always lived with you?'</p>

<p>'Yes most of the time he lived with us. Sometimes he worked away from home and didn't live in the house,' Mr Tarver said.</p>

<p>'When Philip was 18 did Mrs Tarver suffer a severe stroke?' Ms Healy asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' the widower said.</p>

<p>'Did that affect her ability to speak?' the prosecutor asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, she couldn't really speak at all. She tried to answer things but it was difficult to communicate.</p>

<p>'She would write notes and eventually you would understand what she was getting at,' Mr Tarver said.</p>

<p>'So she could understand you but had huge difficulty communicating orally to people?' the QC said.</p>

<p>'That's right, yes,' the father replied.</p>

<p>The prosecutor told jurors they would consider evidence about an acute psychotic episode allegedly experienced by Tarver during the attack.</p>

<p>Ms Healy said the question was whether it had been triggered by his own use of cannabis, or was an 'independent psychotic episode which coincidentally developed against a background of cannabis and cocaine use.'</p>

<p>Tarver allegedly made a series of 'significant' comments and ranted about needing to 'make sure' his mother was dead while he was in police custody.</p>

<p>Ms Healy said: 'He said: "She's in the freezer, she's in bits." He's blinking repeatedly with his eyes and he says "put a patch over my left eye, the f***ers been possessed. I need a drink. Holy water of course. Whiskey, just Irish whiskey."</p>

<p>'He said: "I had a moment of madness."</p>

<p>'He described struggling with his sexuality since the age of five and he dressed in women's clothes but his father didn't mind.</p>

<p>'He described his mother sitting at the kitchen table and looking half dead so he said he put her out of her misery.</p>

<p>'He said he stabbed her in the heart and he had to make sure she was dead. He said it was all a blur and hazy and he was trying to process what had happened.</p>

<p>'He said his dad said: "Oh no you're dressed like that again." He said his dad was used to seeing him dressed in women's clothing.</p>

<p>'He saw his mum still in the kitchen staring blankly at a wall not looking at it. She didn't acknowledge him - he got a knife, he pushed her onto the floor and stabbed her in the heart. He then said he cut her head off with a knife to make sure she was dead.</p>

<p>'He said he was very confused at the time and still doesn't know what happened.</p>

<p>'He was described as shaking with his head in his hand and sobbing saying: "What have I done?"</p>

<p>Asked why he put her head in the freezer, Tarver allegedly replied: 'I couldn't bear to look at her so I had to get the head away from me.' </p>

<p>Tarver, who is on trial at the Old Bailey (pictured) in London, denies murdering his mother and making a threat to kill his father</p>

<p>Ms Healy added: 'A scabbard was present on the floor of the dining room. Two rings had been identified in the washing up bowl in the kitchen.</p>

<p>'The stab wound to the left chest wall, this was the fatal injury.'</p>

<p>Tarver appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey today wearing a grey jumper with long hair. Tarver of Julian Close, Woking, denies murder and threats to kill.</p>

<p>The trial continues. </p>
