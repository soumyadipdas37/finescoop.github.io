<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Supermarket giants and retailers have been named among the worst offenders when it comes to hiring women on their boards.</p>

<p>Despite having a workforce that can be made up predominantly of women on the shop floor, a smaller percentage of women are at the top table at Morrisons and Primark-owner Associated British Foods than at other major firms.</p>

<p>Ocado, BT, the London Stock Exchange and Bunzl were among others named and shamed in research from Cranfield University.</p>

<p>Despite having a workforce that can be made up predominantly of women on the shop floor, a smaller percentage of women are at the top table at Morrisons than at other major firms</p>

<p>An analysis of boards on FTSE 350 companies found that, on average, Britain's biggest listed companies will meet a Government-backed target that 33 per cent of positions should be held by women at the end of 2020.</p>

<p>But beyond directors on boards, the number of women in executive, decision-making roles is woefully far behind.</p>

<p>According to Cranfield, 34.5 per cent of board director roles on the FTSE 100 and 32 per cent on the FTSE 250 were held by women in June.</p>

<p>But the figures vary wildly. On the FTSE 100, water firm Severn Trent and housebuilder Taylor Wimpey boasted 56 per cent of seats being held by women.</p>

<p>At the time of the report, Cranfield said Severn Trent was one of five FTSE 100 firms with a female chief executive, Liv Garfield, and was the only one that also had a female chairman, Christine Hodgson. </p>

<p>There were four other female bosses including Glaxosmithkline, whose boss is Emma Walmsley, Whitbread's Alison Brittain, Natwest's Alison Rose, and ITV, with Carolyn McCall.</p>

<p>FTSE female: Liv Garfield is the boss of Severn Trent</p>

<p>At the other end of the scale packaging group Bunzl only has 17 per cent representation and Paddy Power-owner Flutter just 20 per cent. </p>

<p>And only a quarter of seats are held by women at Ocado, Morrisons, Just Eat, cruise firm Carnival, builder Berkeley and BT. </p>

<p>Cranfield researchers said Severn Trent and Taylor Wimpey were 'not the most likely companies' to be in the top spot.</p>

<p>They added: 'It is surprising to see companies such as Associated British Foods, BT, Carnival, London Stock Exchange, Ocado, Morrisons, Coca-Cola and Bunzl, all in sectors where there are many women.'</p>

<p>The drive to improve representation on boards started in 2010 when investment veteran Dame Helena Morrissey set up the 30 per cent Club. </p>

<p>Companies could sign up to appoint women to 30 per cent of board roles – but this figure was later pushed further by a 2016 Government-supported review on diversity.</p>

<p>This urged that women should make up at least a third of boards, executive committees and those reporting to them at FTSE 350 companies by the end of this year. </p>

<p>Although the board-level target is likely to be hit, the number of women in executive, decision-making roles is lagging.</p>

<p>On the Footsie just 13 per cent of executive-level roles are held by women – and for mid-cap companies this is 11 per cent.</p>

<p>Morrissey said: 'Things are moving at a glacial pace. Some of this is down to company culture – but if you're counting on one person battling the odds then we're going to be here a long time.'</p>

<p>Sue Vinnicombe of Cranfield University said: 'Our research establishes that it is not sufficient just to have a critical mass of women non-executive directors on a board in order to increase the number of women in the executive pipeline. There needs to be women in influential roles such as executive directors.'</p>
