<p>He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.</p>

<p>The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in Instagram posts last year.</p>

<p>But Kemp, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.</p>

<p>She told The Sun: 'You just feel helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, depression, anxiety. The emotional abuse stays with you a lot longer than the physical. It takes a long, long time to heal.'</p>
