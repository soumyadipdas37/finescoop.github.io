<p>Josh Hazlewood said that Australia have 'unfinished business' against Eoin Morgan's England</p>

<p>Fast bowler Hazlewood said the Aussies want revenge for World Cup semi-final thrashing</p>

<p>'It's always unfinished business,' said Hazlewood. 'Whenever you lose against a team you always want to win the next time you play them and England are no different.</p>

<p>'This will be a tough gig but we always believe Australia can win any game in any format.</p>

<p>'England are flying and we are coming off a long spell without any matches but our intra-squad matches are going really well and the guys are going out and getting a good hit.'</p>

<p>Hazlewood says that Australia will be studying the new faces in the England line-up</p>

<p>Hazlewood says that Australia will be studying the new faces in the England line-up after watching Tom Banton and Dawid Malan excel in the first two T20 games against Pakistan.</p>

<p>'England have got all bases covered in white-ball cricket,' he added. 'We've probably seen a bit more depth from them this year because they've had to have different squads up to now for Test and white-ball games.</p>

<p>'They had a good chase against Pakistan on Sunday and everyone knows their roles. Their white-ball team is as good as ever but we're always confident we will win every game we play.'</p>
