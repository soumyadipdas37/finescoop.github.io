<p>Ex Charlton Athletic defender, Richard Rufus, 45, allegedly enticed investors into a massive foreign currency scam between 2007 and April 2012</p>

<p>Prosecutors claim money was not invested and was spent on ‘personal expenses and lifestyle.’</p>

<p>Richard Rufus, pictured arriving at an earlier hearing at Southwark Crown Court last year has been told he will be tried in a new Nightingale Court in March 2021. He has been charged with foreign exchange fraud</p>

<p>Rufus has been told his three-week case has been listed for the Prospero House nightingale Court in Southwark, pictured</p>

<p>The former player, pictured left, was forced to retire from football in 2004 after suffering a career-ending injury</p>

<p>Rufus, who is out on bail, did not appear in a brief video-link hearing at Southwark Crown Court to set his trial date.</p>

<p>Judge Deborah Taylor sent him for a three-week trial in March next year at Prospero House, one of the new Nightingale courts.</p>

<p>After retiring from professional football in 2004 due to injury, Rufus turned to work in the financial sector.</p>

<p>When he was 29, he underwent an operation on his knee in the United States, but it was not successful.</p>

<p>Rufus, of Crystal Palace, southeast London, denies three counts of fraud by false representation, possessing criminal property and of carrying out a regulated activity when not authorised.</p>
