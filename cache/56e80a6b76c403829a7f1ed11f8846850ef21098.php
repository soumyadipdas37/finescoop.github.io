<p>The 27-year-old singer/songwriter tied the knot with The New Respects guitarist Zandy Fitzgerald at the picturesque Graystone Quarry near Nashville.</p>

<p>He made the big announcement with a heartwarming snapshot of himself and his bride holding hands at the altar during the ceremony.</p>

<p>'Mr. &amp; Mrs. Mowry. 9.21.20 God is GOOD. It's SO LIT!!!' Tavior gushed in his caption, tagging their officiant Pastor Lyle Phillips.</p>

<p>Zandy, who herself has a twin sister called Lexi, posted her own sweepingly romantic Instagram picture in which she kissed her groom by a wheat field.</p>

<p>'The Mowry's,' wrote Zandy, who has now taken her husband's surname on her Instagram handle. 'God writes the best stories.'</p>

<p>'Mr &amp; Mrs Tavior Mowry,' she captioned another photo, which showed her and Tavior holding hands as they strolled off toward the sunset.</p>

<p>The ceremony was evidently a socially distant affair as the only people visible in the pictures were the happy couple and the pastor.</p>

<p>Zandy and Tavior, who announced their engagement publicly this July, had their first date over two and a half years ago.</p>

<p>'I always said "I want whoever I marry to love God more than He loves me," because I knew if that was the case I would be loved well,' she wrote on Instagram upon the announcement of her engagement.</p>

<p>'That prayer and many others were answered when <?php echo e('@'); ?>taviordontaemowry walked into my life. Two and a half years ago we ate ramen together as strangers and now we‚Äôre PREPARING TO GET MARRIED. What a ride,' she added.</p>

<p>Her Nashville-based band is a family affair, consisting of her, Lexi and their brother Darius as well as a cousin of theirs called Jasmine, according to ANCHR¬†magazine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tavior, who along with singing plays multiple instruments, performs under the name Dontae Adisa.</p>

<p>Along with Tavior, Tia and Tamera also have a 34-year-old brother called Tahj who has himself joined showbiz by way of acting and singing.¬†</p>
