<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tony Mokbel is set to launch a bid for freedom after serving just 13 years of his 30-year sentence for drug trafficking, a court has heard.</p>

<p>The Melbourne gangland kingpin, who was depicted on the television series Underbelly, is appealing his conviction over the Lawyer X scandal which recently rocked the Victorian legal system.</p>

<p>Mokbel and his new legal counsel fronted the Court of Appeal on Wednesday hoping to get the process started.</p>

<p>Ms Gobbo had represented Mokbel on three major criminal trials while acting as a confidential police informant.  </p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews called a Royal Commission into the Management of Police Informants in 2018, with the complete findings to be handed down in November this year.  </p>

<p>The inquiry have already stated that Ms Gobbo's conduct may constitute a breach of her duty to the administration of justice, the court and her client. </p>

<p>'We have been seeking disclosure for many years and we have finally got to a point where we believe we have enough to proceed to an appeal,' barrister Richard Maidment QC told the directions hearing, the Herald Sun reported.</p>

<p>'Through the lense of Mr Mokbel, he has been seeking disclosure for a very long time.</p>

<p>'He is very anxious now to proceed as quickly as possible to a hearing.' </p>

<p>But Registrar Ian Irving ruled in favour of a request by state and federal prosecutors asking for more time to dissect the 14,000 pages of material involved in the case.  </p>

<p>A two-month extension was granted and proceedings will get underway on November 25.</p>

<p>The bid for freedom comes after Mokbel almost died after a jail yard stabbing at Victoria's Barwon Prison in February 2019. </p>

<p>Mokbel was stabbed seven times by two men with cutlery and sharpened wires who kicked him in the head, knocking out his teeth.   </p>

<p>As the assault attracted attention from other inmates and prison guards, the men could be heard screaming: 'You're not an enforcer, this is what you get for talking to the screws you f**king dog.' </p>

<p>So violent was the attack, a court refused to release footage of it to the media.</p>

<p>Teira Bennett and Eldea Teuira were sentenced to seven years each for the heinous attack. </p>

<p>Tony Mokbel is treated by paramedics after being attacked in jail in what has been described as a 'snuff movie'</p>

<p>Bleeding from his mouth and chest, Mokbel was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital (pictured)</p>
