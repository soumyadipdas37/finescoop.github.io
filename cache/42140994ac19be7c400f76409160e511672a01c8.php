<p>Former AFL great Shane Crawford wondered how supporters of the club felt after seeing their team laughing while so far behind their opponents.</p>

<p>Images of Essendon players (pictured) laughing with each other despite being down by almost 10 goals in a must-win AFL match has infuriated fans and former players</p>

<p>'The thing that I don't like when sides lose, especially in really important games, you see players with big smiles on their faces interacting with opposition players.'</p>

<p>The former Hawthorne captain said having a bit of fun was one thing but when a team is vying for a finals spot fans expected more intensity.</p>

<p>After the game, which saw Geelong destroy Essendon 108 points to 42, fans savaged their team on social media.</p>

<p>'That's absolutely piss poor! As an Essendon supporter I'm bloody angry,' one man wrote to Twitter. </p>

<p>'God we are now officially rabble at the moment! Laughing and joking among themselves and the opposition while we're getting beaten by 10 or more goals!' another fan added. </p>

<p>'Didn't Essendon play better in the 3rd quarter, maybe they needed the joke before the first bounce,' a third fan quipped. </p>

<p>Essendon were trying to secure a spot in the finals but were down by 59 points at halftime rolled before losing to the Cats in the end (pictures), prompting fans to slam the club's effort</p>

<p>Former Essendon great Matthew Lloyd also took aim at his old club saying it had become 'the laughing stock' of the competition. </p>

<p>'The Bombers have got no respect in this competition anymore, and that hurts me to say that ... from where my heart is as an Essendon person,' he told AFL.com.au. </p>

<p>'We used to have a great identity at that club, and that all has been lost.</p>

<p>'So it's time they get their act together both on and off the field to try to right the wrongs, because it's becoming really tiresome.'</p>

<p>However not everyone was angry, some fans took to social media to defend their team's actions. </p>

<p>'That’s it, the world has officially gone mad. How dare they laugh at themselves,' one Facebook user wrote.</p>

<p>'Sometimes to break the feeling of despair is to make a joke.. laughter changes the way a person thinks and feels,' a second user replied. </p>

<p>'Oh my God .... that is appalling. Trying to put some positivity in their heads. Disgraceful behaviour,' another fan added. </p>
