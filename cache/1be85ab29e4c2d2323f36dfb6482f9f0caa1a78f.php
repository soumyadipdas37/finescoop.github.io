<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A maths genius has won a £2.3million prize from Mark Zuckerberg's foundation for working out the complex equations that result from stirring a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Martin Hairer, 44, from Imperial College London, hit the jackpot as winner of the 2021 Breakthrough prize for mathematics.</p>

<p>The Austrian-British researcher, who lives in London with his mathematician wife Xue-Mei Li, had been working on stochastic analysis.</p>

<p>The field, based on Ito's calculus, saw him delve into how random effects turn the maths of things such as stirring a cup of tea or the growth of a forest fire.</p>

<p>He created a complicated 180-page treatise on the idea of 'regularity structures', which left rivals stunned and saw one say he must have got it from intelligent aliens.</p>

<p>Mr Hairer got the results for the 2021 Breakthrough prize for mathematics - created by Zuckerberg and Israeli-Russian investor Yuri Milner - on Skype during lockdown.</p>

<p>He told the Guardian: 'It was completely unexpected. I didn't think about it at all, so it was a complete shock. We couldn't go out or anything, so we celebrated at home.'</p>

<p>The genius was born and raised in Geneva, Switzerland, where his advanced intellect was quickly discovered. </p>

<p>In a school science event he created a software which became Amadeus, know as 'the Swiss army knife of sound editing', which is widely used in the music industry. </p>

<p>Mr Hairer studied mathematics at Geneva University before doing a master's and PhD in physics.</p>

<p>But he moved back into maths when he realised work in theoretical physics can quickly be written off and forgotten.</p>

<p>He said: 'I wouldn't really want to put my name to a result that could be superseded by something else three years later.</p>

<p>'In mathematics, if you obtain a result then that is it. It's the universality of mathematics, you discover absolute truths.'</p>

<p>The Austrian-British researcher, who lives in London with his mathematician wife Xue-Mei Li (pictured), had been working on stochastic analysis</p>

<p>Mr Hairer's speciality is stochastic partial differential equations, which looks at how random acts turn normal things into chaos.</p>

<p>This can be on the movement of air in a wind tunnel or how a drop of water seeps across a tissue when it hits it.</p>

<p>But when the random act is very strong, solving the equation can become extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Mr Hairer's creation of regularity structures, published in 2014, made it possible to tame the random act and reframe it, allowing him to solve the equations.</p>

<p>The mathematician is looking to buy a house in London when the prize money goes in his account.</p>
