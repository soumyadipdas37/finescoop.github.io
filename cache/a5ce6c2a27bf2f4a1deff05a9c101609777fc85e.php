Thank you HBO and A24 for all your support. Thank you to my family and my team, who's all here. I'm really grateful to have all of you here. </p>

<p>'To the incredible cast and crew of Euphoria, I'm so lucky to go to work with you everyday, and I'm inspired by everything you do. And to [creator] Sam Levinson, I appreciate you so much, you're my family. I'm so grateful for Rue. I'm so grateful that you trusted me with your story, and I hope I continue to do you proud. </p>

<p>'I know this is a really weird time to be celebrating, but I just wanna say there is hope in the young people out there. I know that our show doesn't always feel like a great example of that, but there is hope in the young people. And I just want to say to all my peers out there, doing work in the streets: I see you, I admire you, I thank you. Thank you so, so much.' </p>
