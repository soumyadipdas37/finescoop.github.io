<p>Father and son: Shaun Williamson's secret child has revealed that he was already a huge fan of his dad's before knowing they were related (pictured together in 2018)</p>

<p>Gary has now revealed more details about their reunion, saying in book A Matter of Facts: 'My dad was in fact Shaun Williamson, an actor that I had admired for years, not from EastEnders but from the sitcom Extras.</p>

<p>'Me and my mates had even planned to go and see him when he was in a show at the Belfast Opera House some years before, so that we could meet him afterwards. How weird would that have been?' </p>

<p>On Saturday it was revealed how Shaun - who played Barry in EastEnders for a decade before being killed off in 2004 - fathered Gary with a circus juggler more than 30 years ago.   </p>

<p>The actor, who also has a daughter Sophie, 22, and son Joseph, 20 with ex-wife Melanie Sacre, said the revelation was 'the most frightening but amazing discovery'. </p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun on Sunday, Shaun said: 'When I found out I had another son, I was stunned. I was shaking when I went to meet him.'   </p>

<p>The actor added: 'He said he never thought in a million years that Barry from EastEnders could be his dad.'</p>

<p>The Celebrity Big Brother star told how he met Gary's mother, who remains anonymous, when he was working as a barman in 1987 aged 22.</p>

<p>Shaun described how he was 'blown away' by the circus juggler and the pair went onto get engaged after six months despite having a 'fiery relationship'.</p>

<p>Family: Shaun connected with his eldest child, who was living in Northern Ireland, in 2013 after Gary sent him an email (the actor is pictured in September 2019)</p>

<p>The star ended the relationship as he took up a job as a Pontin's Bluecoat before he was told by his ex-fianceé that she was pregnant. </p>

<p>However she later explained to her ex Shaun that her landlord's son was in fact the father and his name would be on the birth certificate. </p>

<p>In 2013 the former postman received an email out-of-the-blue stating it was 'Gary' from his 'circus days'.  </p>

<p>The Extras star sent a paternity test to a centre in Canada which confirmed that he was his biological son with Shaun describing how it all 'fell into place'. </p>

<p>Shaun met his long-lost son Gary in a hotel in Belfast and described how the pair 'hit it off' from the start.  </p>

<p>Bye Barry! Shaun became the eighth housemate to be evicted from the Celebrity Big Brother House in 2017 </p>

<p>He said: 'It was a surreal experience. I could immediately see the similarity. We hit it off straight away.' </p>

<p>Shaun became a household name thanks to his role as Barry Evans on EastEnders from 1994 until 2004. His character was dramatically killed off by the evil Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks).</p>

<p>The actor has gone on to appear on the likes of current programme Mister Winner, Ricky Gervais' Extras and Scoop. </p>

<p>While in 2017, he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother and joked as he entered the house that he would have 'Barry from EastEnders' written on his gravestone.</p>
