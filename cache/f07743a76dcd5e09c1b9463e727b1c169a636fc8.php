<p>One man failed to declare almost 2kg of raw pork fat, 660 grams of salami and 100g of pork rind (file picture)</p>

<p>He also had 870g of fish that hadn't been gutted, 350g of other fish and 340g of chicken in his luggage.</p>

<p>The man's fellow traveller failed to declare 2.2kg of pork meat and fat.</p>

<p>The pair arrived last Friday on a flight from Singapore to Perth, where they were hoping to quarantine for two weeks before linking up with a commercial ship at Fremantle.</p>

<p>Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said the men were the 13th and 14th people to have their visas cancelled under beefed up biosecurity laws since October 2019.</p>

<p>'Each of the items seized could pose a direct threat to our agricultural industries and environment,' he said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'Australia will not tolerate people putting our world-class clean, green reputation at risk by failing to declare food on arrival in Australia.'</p>
