<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The nasty infection picked up by Cristiano Ronaldo has been likened to that of a bee sting by Portugal boss Fernando Santos.  </p>

<p>Santos was downbeat when asked about the health of his best player ahead of a Nations League double-header against Croatia and Sweden. </p>

<p>Ronaldo picked up an infection on his right toe and is set to miss both games with Santos unconvinced that he will be '100 per cent OK' to play. </p>

<p> Cristiano Ronaldo's involvement in upcoming Nations League games remains in real doubt</p>

<p>Ronaldo picked up a toe infection on international duty and is now expected to sit out</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters, Santos said: 'I am very doubtful that he will be 100 per cent OK.</p>

<p>'He had been training well, then suddenly on Wednesday one of his toes was red, as if he'd been stung by a bee.</p>

<p>'Now we have to wait. With an infection, you don't know how long the recovery is going to take.' </p>

<p>Portugal boss Fernando Santos likened the redness of Ronaldo's infection to a bee sting</p>

<p>Missing both games would cause great frustration for Ronaldo as he continues to stay patient in a bid to reach 100 international goals. </p>

<p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Ronaldo has been stuck on 99 goals for 10 months and this international break on the eve of the new season provided him the first opportunity to tally up a century of strikes for Portugal. </p>

<p>His 99th goal came against Luxembourg in a 2-0 Euro 2020 qualifying win on November 17.  </p>

<p>Portugal won the Nations League last year with Ronaldo playing a starring role, hitting a hat-trick in the semi-final,  and so his absence to start their Nations League defence is a major disappointment for Santos. </p>

<p>Missing both games would see Ronaldo's wait to reach 100 international goals continue</p>
