<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Roma star Nicolo Zaniolo has been dealt another huge injury blow as he has suffered a second anterior cruciate ligament injury in less than a year. </p>

<p>Zaniolo managed to limp himself off the pitch during Italy's Nations League victory against Holland after he was on the wrong end of a collision with Manchester United new boy Donny van de Beek.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old attacker had only recently made his comeback from an ACL injury in January and is now set for even more time on the sidelines after this second blow.</p>

<p>Roma star Nicolo Zaniolo has suffered a second anterior cruciate ligament injury this year</p>

<p>Zaniolo managed to limp off after a collision with Donny van de Beek in Nations League victory</p>

<p>The Italian national team doctor, Andrea Ferretti, explained that Zaniolo has sustained a 'major' injury to his left knee - not the right knee that he had surgery on earlier this year.</p>

<p>'It looks like a major knee sprain,' Ferretti said to Rai Sport. 'It's difficult to draw comparisons with the other knee because that's already been operated on.</p>

<p>'It's a sprain of some importance. He's coming out of that long rehabilitation process for the other cruciate and he's obviously worried, as we are, too.'</p>

<p>His club, Roma, confirmed the player's injury on Twitter and that he is set for another operation this year. </p>

<p>They wrote: 'Nicolo Zaniolo will undergo surgery on Wednesday after MRI scans today confirmed the player has suffered a complete tear to the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee.' </p>

<p>The young international will be hoping that this does not become a regular occurence throughout his career as he has already made plenty of good impressions during his time in Serie A.</p>

<p>Former England manager Fabio Capello has tipped Zaniolo as a future Balon d'Or winner. He told Sky Sport Italia last month:  'This Roma talent has extraordinary physicality, power and pace, mixed in with quality. </p>

<p>'He has the potential not just to win the Golden Shoe in future, but something more,' </p>

<p>'Kaka didn't have the same strength as Zaniolo, as he was more technical and expressed himself better in the final third.</p>

<p>'I am in love with Zaniolo, because he has everything at the highest level: power, quality and pace. There are players out there with a lot of potential, but not like him.'</p>

<p>Italy beat Holland 1-0 thanks to a header from Nicolo Barella in added time during the first half. </p>
