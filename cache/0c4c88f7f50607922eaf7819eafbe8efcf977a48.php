<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A teenager obsessed with the 'twisted ideology' of Nazis and white supremacists researched how to convert imitation firearms into live weapons in preparation for a terror attack, a court heard.</p>

<p>The boy, now 17 – who cannot be named – considered extremists who carried out mass shootings to be 'saints', jurors were told. </p>

<p>He is said to have been a member of the neo-Nazi organisation the Feuerkrieg Division and to have used extreme Right-wing online forums to share information on weapon-making.</p>

<p>The trial was opened at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) yesterday. Mr Brook said the boy had become radicalised so he 'fully believed in extreme Right-wing ideology, the twisted ideology of Nazis and white supremacy'</p>

<p>Matthew Brook, prosecuting, said the teenager, from Rugby, Warwickshire, had an interest in mass shootings and planned to buy a blank firing gun and convert it for live ammunition to provoke an impending 'race war'.</p>

<p>The trial was opened at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday. </p>

<p>Mr Brook said the boy had become radicalised so he 'fully believed in extreme Right-wing ideology, the twisted ideology of Nazis and white supremacy'.</p>

<p>'He came to believe an ideology which thinks a race war is coming, an ideology which believes its followers should bring about a race war, should accelerate its start, so that the white race can become supreme,' he added.</p>

<p>The teenager was said to have had a copy of a document called the Great Replacement, written by Brenton Tarrant before he shot dead 51 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March lsat year. </p>

<p>Alleging that the boy had researched how to convert a blank-firing gun into a live weapon, and had offered advice to members of extreme-right chat groups, Mr Brook added: 'The evidence will show that he searched the internet for information on firearms.</p>

<p>'Having found that information, he did not keep it to himself but shared information.</p>

<p>'The evidence will show that he searched for information about where to buy a blank-firing gun - which he discussed converting to a real live-firing gun with others.'</p>

<p>Jurors were shown censored footage of the Christchurch terror attack in which 51 people were shot dead, after being told the defendant had a recording of the killings on his phone, containing 'graphic detail'.</p>

<p>Mr Brook told the court: 'When (Christchurch attacker) Brenton Tarrant carried out his terrorist attack, he had a camera with him which was recording what was happening and streaming it on to the internet.</p>

<p>'A copy of that recording was found on the defendant's telephone.'</p>

<p>The boy has pleaded not guilty to preparation of terrorist acts between April and September 2019.</p>

<p>The trial, which is expected to last six weeks, continues.</p>
