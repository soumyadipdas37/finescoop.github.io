<p>An increasing number of users are placing orders on popular social media platforms like Instagram, and getting drugs delivered to their door to seemingly idyllic towns.</p>

<p>New data also reveals which Australian suburbs have become the biggest drug-dealing hot spots in the midst of the changing dynamics of the narcotics trade and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>A this Instagram message shows that drug dealers are moving out of dark allies and street corners and to setting up their illegal operations online</p>

<p>In New South Wales, the picturesque beachside community of Merewether, two hours north of Sydney, topped the list for most drug dealers with 268 busts recorded in the year to March 2020.</p>

<p>The affluent surf spot had a staggering five times more arrests than Mt Druitt which was next on the list followed by Kempsey on the Mid North Coast, Waterloo and Zetland, Liverpool, Chippendale and Darlington, Redfern, Newcastle, Surrey Hills and Darlinghurst and Cabramatta.</p>

<p>Even more surprising was Mudgee - an idyllic rural town known for its world renowned vineyards - was the number one location for ice and amphetamines dealing.</p>

<p>The small town recorded 226 arrests for amphetamine dealing in that time, almost twice the number of the Central Coast's Bateau Bay, Long Jetty and The Entrance, which entered the list at number two.</p>

<p>'I suspect a large amount of recreational drug use is increasingly being sourced off social media,' Dr John Coyne, the head of Strategic Policing and Law Enforcement at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute told the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>'Now all of a sudden the guy who delivers your meal can also deliver your marijuana or other drugs. So we've got this storm of change and social change where people are having and getting used to doing more from home.'</p>

<p>'I suspect a large amount of recreational drug use is increasingly being sourced off social media,' Dr John Coyne said (pictured, a man is arrested in Melbourne on drugs charges)</p>

<p>The former Australian Federal Police officer added that a decade earlier, authorities were highly concerned about potentially out-of-control drug dealing on the dark web.</p>

<p>But they didn't consider was that deals would go down on mainstream social media apps with billions of users.</p>

<p>In Victoria the top spot where drug dealers were nabbed was Melbourne's CBD with 164 offences, followed by Yarra with 125 and Wangaratta near the NSW border, with 116.</p>

<p>Mildura, Port Phillip, Knox, Warrnambool, Southbank, Dandenong and Shepparton also made the unenviable list.</p>

<p>Australian Border Force Acting NSW Regional Commander Matthew O'Connor said since the onset of the pandemic, mail and air cargo drug seizures have spiked.</p>

<p>'People wanting to do the wrong thing will set up phoenix companies, phony companies they will use PO boxes, they will use third party addresses, they can get things delivered to so there's a whole range of strategies,' Cmdr O'Connor said. </p>

<p>In NSW, the picturesque beachside community of Merewether (pictured), two hours north of Sydney, topped the list for most drug dealers</p>

<p>Mudgee (pictured) - an idyllic rural town known for its wines - was the number one location for ice and amphetamines dealing</p>

<p>In total, there have been 13,151 drug detection from January 2020 to July 31 - a 34 per cent increase on the corresponding period last year.</p>

<p>Queensland figures take into account offences for drug possession as well as dealing.</p>

<p>The sport with the most arrests was Brisbane City with 1,756 arrests, Fortitude Valley with 1090 and Bowen Hills 652.</p>

<p>The top ten was rounded out by Spring Hill, South Brisbane, Woodridge, Beenleigh, Inala, Kingston and Nudah.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Facebook, the company that owns Instagram, said the site has taken down drug-related content on 1.4 million occasions between April and June, 2020.  </p>

<p>The company reiterated they do not allow the sale of any illicit substances on their website and have been focusing on working with experts and investing in technology to keep drugs off the platform.  </p>
