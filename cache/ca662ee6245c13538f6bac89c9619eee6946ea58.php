<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A painting purchased for just $60 could end up being one of the most valuable pieces of art in Australia worth tens of millions of dollars. </p>

<p>The piece was snapped up by an anonymous buyer at a market in Geelong, south-west of Melbourne, a few years ago and is currently being held in a vault in the Victorian capital.  </p>

<p>Art historians believe the painting of a windmill, with a striking resemblance to others created by Vincent Van Gogh, could be the work of the iconic artist.</p>

<p>The painting of a windmill could potentially be an original work by dutch post-impressionist Vincent Van Gogh</p>

<p>The dutch impressionist spent a large portion of his career painting windmills, (pictured) a common fixture in the Dutch landscape</p>

<p>Art Historian Andrew Mackenzie has been researching the artwork for two years.</p>

<p>He has taken it to be analysed at the National Gallery of Victoria and the work has also undergone a macro photography analysis at the Monash University.</p>

<p>Mr Mackenzie said early investigations indicate it could be an authentic Van Gogh painting.</p>

<p>'It showed up the way it was built underneath, which was very much in the style of Vincent Van Gogh,' Mr Mackenzie told Nine News. </p>

<p>The dutch impressionist spent a large portion of his career painting windmills, a common fixture in the Dutch landscape.</p>

<p>Some of his early drawings as well as later works during his time in Paris in 1886 and 1887 feature the structures.</p>

<p>Mr Mackenzie believes the work may have been brought to Australia by one of Van Gogh's old art school friends Peter Russell.</p>

<p>'Van Gogh said "choose a couple from my studio before you go back to Australia", so it could well be that this is one of those,' he said. </p>

<p>'If it is proved to be a Van Gogh, it will be probably one of the most valuable works in Australia.' </p>
