<p>Unimpressed: Lauryn Goodman took another swipe at her ex Kyle Walker on Instagram on Thursday, after the footballer said he is a 'role model'</p>

<p>Lauryn was responding to the Kyle's interview where he revealed his regret at breaking lockdown laws earlier this year, where he was branded a 'covidiot'.</p>

<p>The Manchester City star landed himself in hot water in April after hosting a party at his house during the height of the Government's lockdown measures.</p>

<p>In May, Walker broke regulations for a second time after driving to visit his parents and sister. </p>

<p>Not present: The social media star, 29, hit out at the England ace, 30, for the comment after stating he acts like their child Junior, four months, 'doesn't exist' (pictured 2018)</p>

<p>Hitting out: In the interview, Kyle revealed his regret at breaking lockdown laws earlier this year saying he was a role model and Lauryn took to Instagram to make a thinly-veiled dig</p>

<p>Support: The brunette beauty also shared a message from a fan who said she 'laughed out loud' when Kyle called himself a 'role model'</p>

<p>Kyle said: 'Obviously me and the boss [Gareth Southgate] spoke after the lockdown incidents and, you know, he assured me that we all make mistakes.</p>

<p>'Obviously, mine was on a bigger scale and gets magnified with me being in the public eye and a role model to young children growing up, so I have to take full responsibility for my actions, which I have done.'</p>

<p>Taking to Instagram, Lauryn wrote: '"I'm a role model". Yea okay hun. Whatever makes you sleep at night' (sic).</p>

<p>Surprise: Lauryn found out she was pregnant with Junior after she and Kyle struck up a brief romance following his split from his partner of 10 years, Annie Kilner </p>

<p>The star's younger sister Chloe, 29, threw her support behind Lauryn as she uploaded the post: 'There's nothing worse than a man who can be everything to everybody else... except a father to their own child'. </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Kyle's representatives for comment. </p>

<p>Family: The star's sister Chloe, 29, threw her support behind Lauryn: 'There's nothing worse than a man who can be everything to everybody else... except a father to their own child'</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Lauryn insinuated that Annie - Kyle's on/off partner, with whom he shares sons Roman, Riaan and Reign with - 'controls' the sportsman. </p>

<p>Sharing a series of direct messages to her Instagram Stories, Lauryn reassured fans that Kyle having 'nothing to do with' their son, was not her doing.  </p>

<p>'Is Kyle having absolutely nothing to do with Junior?' asked an Instagram follower.</p>

<p>Controlling? Earlier this week, Lauryn insinuated that Annie - Kyle's on/off partner, with whom he shares sons Roman, Riaan and Reign with - 'controls' the sportsman</p>

<p>Lauryn shared the DM and added: 'Still stalks me though. Hey! Don't worry your mini me is doing great.</p>

<p>She added: 'Answering because of the amount of messages I get and I don't want people thinking it's down to me. I would never deny Junior.' </p>

<p>'I think you'll find if he's told "he can't" and is "controlled" - no wonder he acts how he does.... but me and JNR are happy.' </p>

<p>After much fanfare when her pregnancy came to light, including anger from Annie, Lauryn admitted she 'has a lot to explain' to Junior.  </p>

<p>In a recent Instagram Q&amp;A, she wrote: 'I think it's important for Junior to have privacy given the circumstances. He's super important to me and I don't want to affect his mental health in the future...</p>

<p>'He's already got to deal with a lot which I'll have to explain to him when he can understand so I need to protect him as best I can. He's my main priority'.  </p>

<p>The truth: Sharing a series of direct messages to her Instagram Stories, Lauryn reassured fans Kyle having 'nothing to do with' their son, was not her doing</p>
