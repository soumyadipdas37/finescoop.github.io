<p>Traces of phosphine gas was recently detected in the clouds of Venus, which suggests it could supports life - but a new study proposes the compounds may have originated from Earth </p>

<p>The 2017 meteor skimmed across Earth's atmosphere for one and a half minutes at more than 35,000 miles per hour before returning to space.</p>

<p>Based on its trajectory as it skimmed the atmosphere, the team estimate that the rock was around 12 inches across and likely weighed at least 132 pounds.</p>

<p>'Although the abundance of terrestrial life in the upper atmosphere is unknown, these planet-grazing shepherds could have potentially been capable of transferring microbial life between the atmospheres of Earth and Venus,' the Harvard study reads.</p>

<p>'As a result, the origin of possible Venusian life may be fundamentally indistinguishable from that of terrestrial life.'</p>

<p>Harvard researchers theorize that the biosignatures gas came to Venus from meteorites that grazed our planet's atmosphere and crashed into the distant planet</p>

<p>Previous research determined that life is found up to an altitude of 43 miles from the surface.</p>

<p>Earth-grazing asteroids can dip 52 miles without experiencing significant heating – another lower would kill any life it gathered from our planet.</p>

<p>'Further work is needed to investigate the existence and abundance of microbial life in the upper atmosphere,' reads the study.</p>

<p>The team also notes that if a meteor coming from Earth enters the atmosphere of another planet, hitchhiking microbes could be released in clouds before the rock disintegrates in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>'A future probe that could sample the habitable cloud deck of Venus will potentially enable the direct discovery of microbial life outside of Earth, the team wrote.'</p>

<p>'Specifically, the capability to either directly analyze microbes in situ or to return an atmospheric sample to Earth will be critical in the design of a successful mission. Finding exactly the same genomic material and helicity on Venus and Earth would constitute a smoking gun for panspermia.'</p>

<p>Researchers detected a so-called spectral signature (pictured) that is unique to phosphine — furthermore were able to estimated that the gas is present in Venus' clouds in an abundance of around 20 parts-per-billion. However, they were unable to determine the exactly source of the detected trace quantities of the gas</p>

<p>On September 14, researchers announced Venus has traces of the biosignatures gas.</p>

<p>Astronomers at Wales' Cardiff University and colleagues observed Venus using both the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at Hawaii's Mauna Kea Observatory and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile.</p>

<p>They detected a so-called spectral signature that is unique to phosphine — and furthermore were able to estimated that the gas is present in Venus' clouds in an abundance of around 20 parts-per-billion.</p>

<p>The team explored assorted ways that the gas could have been produced in this setting — including from sources on the surface of the planet, micrometeorites, lightning, or chemical processes happening within the clouds themselves.</p>

<p>However, they were unable to determine exactly what is the source of the detected trace quantities of the gas.</p>

<p>The researchers have cautioned that the detection of phosphine is not itself robust evidence for alien microbial life — and only indicates that potentially unknown geological or chemical processes are occurring on the planet.</p>

<p>Further observations and modelling will be needed, they added, to better explore the origin of the gas in the planet's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Discovery of pulsars</p>

<p>British astronomer Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell was the first person to discover a pulsar in 1967 when she spotted a radio pulsar.</p>

<p>Since then other types of pulsars that emit x-rays and gamma rays have also been spotted.</p>

<p>Pulsars are essentially rotating, highly magnatised neutron stars but when they were first discovered it was believed they could come from aliens.</p>

<p>'Wow!' radio signal</p>

<p>In 1977, an astronomer looking for alien life in the nigh sky above Ohio spotted a powerful radio signal so strong that he excitedly wrote 'Wow!' next to his data.</p>

<p>In 1977, an astronomer looking for alien life in the nigh sky above Ohio spotted a powerful radio signal so strong that he excitedly wrote 'Wow!' next to his data</p>

<p>The 72-second blast, spotted by Dr Jerry Ehman through a radio telescope, came from Sagittarius but matched no known celestial object.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists have since claimed that the 'Wow! signal', which was 30 times stronger than background radiation, was a message from intelligent extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>Fossilised martian microbes</p>

<p>In 1996 Nasa and the White House made the explosive announcement that the rock contained traces of Martian bugs.</p>

<p>The meteorite, catalogued as Allen Hills (ALH) 84001, crashed onto the frozen wastes of Antarctica 13,000 years ago and was recovered in 1984. </p>

<p>Photographs were released showing elongated segmented objects that appeared strikingly lifelike.</p>

<p>However, the excitement did not last long. Other scientists questioned whether the meteorite samples were contaminated. </p>

<p>They also argued that heat generated when the rock was blasted into space may have created mineral structures that could be mistaken for microfossils. </p>

<p>Behaviour of Tabby's Star in 2005 </p>

<p>The star, otherwise known as KIC 8462852, is located 1,400 light years away and has baffled astonomers since being discovered in 2015.</p>

<p>It dims at a much faster rate than other stars, which some experts have suggested is a sign of aliens harnessing the energy of a star.</p>

<p>Recent studies have 'eliminated the possibility of an alien megastructure', and instead, suggests that a ring of dust could be causing the strange signals.</p>

<p>Exoplanets in the Goldilocks zone in 2015 </p>

<p>In February this year astronomers announced they had spotted a star system with planets that could support life just 39 light years away.</p>

<p>Seven Earth-like planets were discovered orbiting nearby dwarf star 'Trappist-1', and all of them could have water at their surface, one of the key components of life.</p>

<p>Three of the planets have such good conditions, that scientists say life may have already evolved on them. </p>

<p>Researchers claim that they will know whether or not there is life on any of the planets within a decade, and said 'this is just the beginning.' </p>
