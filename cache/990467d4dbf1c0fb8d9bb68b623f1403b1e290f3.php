<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paul Merson has slammed Kai Havertz for an 'uninterested' Premier League debut last week and called for the German to improve his attitude.</p>

<p>The German attacking midfielder joined the Blues this summer from Bayer Leverkusen in a £89million move and made his debut in the west Londoners' 3-1 win over Brighton last Monday.</p>

<p>Havertz did not get on the scoresheet before being taken off with ten minutes to play and Merson claimed the 21-year-old did not look up for his Premier League debut. </p>

<p>Kai Havertz had an 'uninterested' debut for Chelsea in their win over Brighton says Paul Merson</p>

<p>The ex-Arsenal man said the 21-year-old German did not play well nor look interested</p>

<p>The former Arsenal midfielder told the Daily Star: 'Kai Havertz has got a lot do. He didn't play well.</p>

<p>'He didn't even look interested at times. When he came off, he didn't really seem to care. It was strange.'</p>

<p>Havertz is part of Frank Lamapard's £200million overhaul of the Chelsea squad this summer which has seen fellow German Timo Werner arrive at the club for £47.5million from RB Leipzig. </p>

<p>Having defeated Brighton in their opening game of the season, the Blues side travel to Premier League champions Liverpool on Sunday in a match which could determine how successful the summer spending has been.</p>

<p>Frank LeBouef says Frank Lampard (right) should not pick Havertz (left) if he is not ready</p>

<p>Former Chelsea defender Frank LeBoeuf believes that Lampard should not play Havertz if he is not physically ready to play.</p>

<p>The German joined on September 4, just eight days before the start of the Premier League in a period which was affected by the international break. </p>

<p>LeBeouf told ESPN: 'I think Frank Lampard should line up the players who are ready, who are ready to compete.</p>

<p>'If Havertz is not ready, if he's physically not ready, he shouldn't play... Chelsea have to show that they can fight with Liverpool.'</p>
