<p>Critics: Rebecca Judd has divided Victorians after taking a stand against Premier Daniel Andrews over his draconian lockdown laws</p>

<p>While many Victorians agree that Andrews is destroying the economy with his heavy-handed approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rebecca faced backlash for daring to express her opinion from her palatial $7.3million mansion in Brighton.</p>

<p>Several trolls described her as the new 'Karen from Brighton' - referring to Melbourne woman Jodi Grollo, who achieved viral fame in July for complaining during a TV interview about having to walk the same streets in Brighton during her daily walks.</p>

<p>But many others said she was entitled to her opinion, adding that an individual's personal wealth doesn't make their views any less valid.</p>

<p>One critic tweeted: 'Thoughts and prayers to Bec Judd who's holed up in a $7million shoebox in Brighton. Let her out, Dictator Dan. One can only spend so much time in their MagnaPool and spa.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Bec Judd is a privileged idiot! How terrible that she has to be in lockdown in her $7 million mansion. She needs to get perspective quickly.' </p>

<p>Speaking out: The footy WAG had criticised Andrews (pictured) in a sponsored Instagram post on Friday, just two days before Melbourne's controversial stage-four lockdown was extended</p>

<p>Subtle swipe: '<?php echo e('@'); ?>the_little_cardboard_co perfect for iso and upcoming school holidays as it seems Dictator Dan will be locking Victorians in our homes even longer,' she wrote</p>

<p>Another former fan revealed they had 'proudly unfollowed Bec Judd last night.'</p>

<p>'Referring to Dan Andrews as dictator Dan from her mansion is offensive when he has worked so hard to reduce Covid numbers and shows up everyday to face the music i.e. press. Unkind and unfollowed,' they tweeted.</p>

<p>But Rebecca also had plenty of support, with many fans saying she was justified in her criticism of the stage-four lockdown.</p>

<p>Separated at birth? Several trolls described her as the new 'Karen from Brighton', referring to Melbourne woman Jodi Grollo (pictured) who achieved viral fame last month for complaining during a TV interview about having to walk the same streets in Brighton during her daily walks </p>

<p>One frustrated Victorian tweeted: 'Great to see you aren't a fan of #DictatorDan Bec Judd. Clapping hands sign #IStandWithBecJudd.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Just reading the most honest statement said by #BecJudd. I absolutely agree with her getting cabin fever, she was shot down by the news and silenced by them.'</p>

<p>Summing up the views of many, one Facebook user asked: 'So because she has money she can't voice her complaints like everybody else can? </p>

<p>Self-isolating in style! The TV presenter and her husband, retired AFL star Chris Judd, have spent the past few months in lockdown with their four children, son Oscar, nine, daughter Billie, six, and three-year-old twins Tom and Darcy, who are all being homeschooled</p>

<p>Not happy: Some critics said they were unfollowing Rebecca for her stance on 'Dictator Dan'</p>

<p>'Can anybody please tell me the income cut-off for not being able to voice your opinion? Imagine what a better world it would be if there wasn't this crass obsession of talking about other people's money.'</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Rebecca Judd's management for comment.</p>

<p>It was announced on Sunday that Melbourne will remain under coronavirus lockdown until at least October 26, but some restrictions will be eased from midnight next Sunday.</p>

<p>From September 14, the nightly curfew will start an hour later at 9pm and run until 5am.</p>

<p>People living alone can nominate a friend or family member who can visit them and two hours of daily exercise will be allowed, including 'social interactions' such as having a picnic at a local park or reading a book at the beach.</p>

<p>Further restrictions could be eased from September 28 and the government will consider lifting the curfew entirely from October 26, depending on case numbers.</p>

<p>'We can't run out of lockdown. We have to take steady and safe steps out of lockdown to find that COVID normal,' Andrews said on Sunday.</p>

<p>Under Andrews' road map out of lockdown, residents will have to wait until November 23 for all retail stores to reopen. </p>
