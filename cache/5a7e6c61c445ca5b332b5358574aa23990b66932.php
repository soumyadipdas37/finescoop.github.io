<p>'Oh hi': Khloe Kardashian flashed a bit of leg in a white robe as she posed up a storm on her Instagram this Thursday</p>

<p>Pulling her best supermodel stares for her 121 million Instagram followers she modeled a pair of glittering earrings.</p>

<p>Khloe was plugging the last season premiere of Keeping Up With The Kardashians which had its cancellation announced early this month.</p>

<p>The show soldiered on for 18 seasons after it first started in 2007 and made superstars out of all the Kardashian-Jenner siblings.</p>

<p>Her Instagram plug comes in the wake of a Page Six report alleging that she and Scott Disick were against the cancellation.</p>

<p>Looking fab: The 36-year-old was a sizzling sensation in full hair and makeup including a bob redolent of the 1920s despite her dressed-down ensemble</p>

<p>By way of explaining their opposition to the cancellation the insider said: 'Some of them needed the money more than others.'</p>

<p>Scott shares three children with Khloe's eldest sister Kourtney Kardashian - sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, and daughter Penelope, eight. </p>

<p>Although there were rumors that Kourtney and Kim Kardashian, as well as Kylie Jenner, pushed for the show to end, the family has denied as much.</p>

<p>The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for the whole family who made the decision together.</p>

<p>When you got it: Pulling her best supermodel stares for her 121 million Instagram followers she modeled a pair of glittering earrings</p>

<p>Their denial came in the wake of a source telling The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'</p>

<p>To hear this source tell it: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'</p>

<p>However the Sun also had a different insider claim that the Kardashian-Jenner family jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.</p>
