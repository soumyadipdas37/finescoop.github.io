<p>'Over the last 4 months my hero and best mate in the whole world has been in and out of hospital with very ill health.</p>

<p>'We were told several times that 100% he had had a stroke and that’s why they were struggling to control his seizures... but after the 3rd time of being admitted to hospital I knew something was not quite right. </p>

<p>'So after pushing for more tests and the results being sent to Kings College Hospital for other surgeons to look at unfortunately the results came back that it wasn’t a stroke after all.</p>

<p>'It was what I had dreaded, my dad has a tumour and after having a biopsy it’s come back that it’s an aggressive cancerous one. The worst kind unfortunately.</p>

<p>'We have been told that it’s not advisable to operate because of where the tumour is and wouldn’t actually make that much difference even if they could.</p>

<p>'The end result is, it’s terminal. They are saying with chemotherapy and radiotherapy we might be lucky and get a year with him.</p>

<p>'As I write this tears are streaming down my face as I’m sure many of you have the same love for your parents. This is honestly the worst time of my life.'  </p>

<p>Heartbreaking news: In July James revealed that his beloved dad has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, following four months of health woes and trips to the hospital </p>

<p>However, while he expressed his heartbreak over the shocking news, James revealed plans to keep on fighting and not accept the doctor's most recent verdict. </p>

<p>He continued: 'I’m posting this and writing to you now as I want to get a second opinion on my father, especially because they misdiagnosed him for the first 4 months which doesn’t fill us with confidence.</p>

<p>'So now myself and my family are actually hoping they are wrong this time. I’m looking to find the best surgeon to see my father as I want to know I’ve done everything possible before I can accept it.'</p>

<p>Appealing to his followers for help, he concluded: 'If anyone that reads this can advise me and my family on who is supposedly the best in this field I would be eternally grateful. My heart is broken. Please DM me if you can help.' </p>

<p>The dancing star and his wife, Ola, have been together for more than 20 years and married in 2003, but they chose to delay having a children to focus on their careers. </p>

<p>Both dancers became staples on the Strictly Come Dancing show before James decided to leave the show in 2013, and his other half followed two years later. </p>
