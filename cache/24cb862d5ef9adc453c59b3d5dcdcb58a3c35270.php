<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Western Australian man John Alexander Roy, 55, (pictured) has been identified as one of the alleged masterminds behind a failed $1billion drug importation plan in 2019</p>

<p>A convicted drug lord could be extradited back to Australia after he allegedly tried to import $1billion worth of drugs into the country. </p>

<p>Western Australian man John Alexander Roy, 55, is expected to be charged over the failed plot and is currently serving a 12 year jail sentence in Britain for other drug offences.</p>

<p>In September 2019 WA Police launched a sea search after finding an unmanned yacht stuck on a reef about 60km west of Geraldton.</p>

<p>During the search officers found 40 bags containing cocaine, meth and ecstasy on nearby Burton Island, estimated to be worth $1billion.</p>

<p>Frenchman Antoine Dicenta and British man Graham Kurt Palmer were arrested a short time later. </p>

<p>Three other men, Scott Felix Jones, Jason Lassiter and Angus Bruce Jackson, were also arrested. </p>

<p>Roy's extradition over the one tonne seizure could take years because he will have to complete a non-parole period in Britain first. </p>

<p>Roy, who was jailed in Britain last week for his role in a separate $1million drug plot, is allegedly one of the main organisers behind the 2019 bust which saw police seize one tonne of illicit drugs in Western Australia (pictured)</p>

<p>In September 2019 police allegedly discovered an unmanned 15ft yacht (pictured) stuck on a reef 60km west of Geraldton before launching a sea search which allegedly led them to the drug on nearby Burton Island</p>

<p>Assistant Commissioner Brad Royce told The West Australian the sophisticated drugs network was taking time to unravel. </p>

<p>'There is still a lot more work to be done and our efforts will continue as we work our way towards the more senior members of the criminal network,' he said.</p>

<p>AFP State Manager for Western Australia, Commander Greg Harrigan praised authorities for foiling the alleged drug plot. </p>

<p>'This seizure shows the power of the community and police agencies, both at home and overseas, working together to stop illicit drugs from reaching our shores,' he said.</p>

<p>'This is an attack on our society that is destroying individuals, families and whole communities.'</p>

<p>Roy was jailed in the UK last week for his role in the importation of MDMA, cocaine and cannabis resin with a street value of more than $1million into Jersey.  </p>

<p>He was also jailed for 14 years in 1998 for his role in a plot to smuggle eight tonnes of marijuana into Queensland.</p>

<p>Investigations into the West Australian seizure continue. </p>

<p>Roy's extradition to Australia over his alleged role in the failed drug importation could take some time because he has to serve the non-parole period on his 12 year sentence in Britain first (seized drugs pictured)</p>
