<p>In the clip, the cameraman approaches policemen who had just pulled up in a patrol car, asking: 'What is going on? What is going on? This is my business! What is going on?'</p>

<p>After telling the man to mind his own business, one police officer asks him to stop filming, adding: 'We're having a bad enough time in out work right now.'</p>

<p>The cameraman quickly asks 'why?' and the policeman explains: 'We had a police officer shot in Croydon. We don't need you in our face right now.'</p>

<p>But rather than leave as requested, the man tells the shocked officer: 'It is what it is man. People die every day brother, you know what I mean!'</p>

<p>He adds: 'When you lot are killing us, you lot don't care!' as the policeman walks away from the scene. </p>

<p>Many viewers rushed to social media to condemn the man's behaviour, with one writing: 'Justifying that somebody's death is fine because of their job role isn't okay.' </p>

<p>The individual added: 'This is disgusting, racism is not okay, racism is not okay, killing black people for no reason IS NOT OKAY. </p>

<p>'But justifying that somebody's death is fine because of their job role isn't okay either.' </p>

<p>Another said: 'Man was [trying to] provide for his family and got killed for it but this guy think it's okay to be disrespectful to him'.</p>

<p>A third user described the video as 'absolutely disgraceful behaviour.' </p>

<p>He added: 'These men just lost a colleague and he's making a mockery of their feelings. Have some respect!'</p>

<p>Some users did, however, defend the cameraman, with one writing: 'I'm in two minds about this. His behaviour is disgraceful but I agree what he is saying.' </p>

<p> Sergeant Ratana, 54, was allegedly shot five times in the chest at point-blank range by a handcuffed suspect at Croydon Custody Centre at 2.15am on Friday</p>

<p>Sergeant Ratana (pictured with his partner Sue) was allegedly shot by a 23-year-old man who was detained for possession of ammunition at Croydon custody centre in South London</p>

<p>Sergeant Ratana, who's job was to look after the care and welfare of detained people, died in hospital following the fatal shooting on Friday.    </p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police officer has been described as someone who epitomised the role police play in protecting others and, as head coach at East Grinstead Rugby Club, an 'irreplaceable figure'. </p>

<p>A man arrested at around 2am on Sunday in Norwich, Norfolk, on suspicion of supplying a firearm, today remains in custody at a south London police station. </p>

<p>The suspect for the shooting – widely reported to be 23-year-old Louis De Zoysa – has not yet been spoken to by investigators due to his critical condition. </p>

<p>Police have been searching an address on Southbrook Road in Norbury, south-west London, and another on Park Road, Banstead in Surrey following Sergeant Ratana's death.</p>

<p>People headed to the Croydon Custody Centre on Sunday to mourn Sergeant Ratana </p>

<p>A police guard was in place outside Courtlands Farm off Park Road yesterday, following reports from neighbours of an explosion in the early hours of the previous morning. </p>

<p>One neighbour said: 'The blast was at 5.40am and woke up our little boy and we sent him back to bed, but what we've heard from other neighbours there was about 20-odd police and they were lined down the driveway.'  </p>

<p>In the lead-up to Friday's killing, the suspect had been arrested by patrolling officers for possession of ammunition and possession of class B drugs with intent to supply following a stop and search, then handcuffed behind his back before being taken to the station in a police vehicle.</p>

<p>According to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), he was taken into the building and sat in a holding area in the custody suite, then opened fire while still in the handcuffs as officers prepared to search him with a metal detector.</p>

<p>No police firearms were discharged in the incident, during which the suspect was also injured, and the case is not being treated as terror-related.</p>

<p>Multiple tributes have been paid to the New Zealand-born sergeant since his death, including from the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Adern.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said he was an 'extraordinary person' who was 'very good at his job'.</p>

<p>She said his 'terrible' death might bring home to people the challenges of police work, helping them to 'see us police as who we are – human beings, going to work to help people, to support people and to protect people'.</p>

<p>She added: 'Matt was the epitome of that.'</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, speaking during a virtual service for National Police Memorial Day on Sunday, said his death is a reminder of the dangers officers are confronted with.</p>

<p>Prince Charles added: 'The dreadful incident in Croydon on Friday is the latest heart-breaking evidence of the risks faced by our officers daily.'</p>

<p>Friends and teammates gathered in silence in East Grinstead to pay their respects as the club flag was flown alongside the New Zealand flag and an All Blacks rugby team flag to honour Sergeant Ratana's love of the sport and his roots.</p>

<p>Police have previously said they are working with a 'determination to find justice for our colleague and his family'. </p>
