<p>The tech giant is launching a new service next month which will allow users to plan the best route across Sydney using a mix of ride sharing and public transport.</p>

<p>This could involve catching an UberX to a bus stop, train station or ferry wharf for the next leg of the journey.</p>

<p>'Uber and Transit' will also provide real-time updates for public transport services on the mobile app.</p>

<p>Sydney and Chicago will be the first two cities in the world to trial the new service.</p>

<p>Uber said the Harbour City was chosen because of its commitment to open data and technology for transit services.  </p>

<p>New South Wales Transport and Roads Minister Andrew Constance said it will give passengers a chance to pick the fastest and cheapest commute. </p>

<p>'It might mean they are better off using a mixture of Uber services and public transport to make their journey more cost effective and time efficient,' he said. </p>

<p>'This collaboration is so great, because it will help people make better decisions about getting around our city and as a result help to reduce congestion, which is a win for our transport commuters and a win for our drivers.'    </p>

<p>The new service follows the integration of public transport services on the app last year.</p>

<p>But the previous service only allowed users to compare whether it would be faster to travel using public transport or ride share services. </p>
