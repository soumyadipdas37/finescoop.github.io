<p>Andromeda Galaxy at Arm's Length by Nicolas Lefaudeux of France. This version of the Andromeda Galaxy seems to be at arm’s length among clouds of stars. Unfortunately, this is just an illusion, as the galaxy is still 2 million light years away. It was the overall winner in the Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition</p>

<p>A stunning image of the closest galaxy to the Milky Way - the Andromeda galaxy - has won first prize in the annual Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition run by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. </p>

<p>More than 5,000 people from six continents entered the annual event - now in its twelfth year - with the winning entries all showcased in an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in London. </p>

<p>French photographer Nicolas Lefaudeux beat thousands of amateur and professional photographers from around the globe to win the astrophotography event to claim the Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2020 title. </p>

<p>As well as securing the £10,000 top prize, his image of the Andromeda Galaxy takes pride of place in the exhibition of winning photographs opening at the National Maritime Museum on October 23, 2020.</p>

<p>The judges were captivated by Lefaudeux’s awe-inspiring image that was taken in Forges-les-Bains, Île-de-France, adding that the photograph depicts a version of the Andromeda Galaxy seemingly at arm’s length - despite being light-years away. </p>

<p>Competition judge Ed Robinson said of the winning entry: 'To most of us, our closest neighbouring galaxy Andromeda can also feel so distanced and out of reach, yet to create a photograph that gives us the impression that it is just within our physical reach is truly magical, and somewhat appropriate as we adjust after such socially distanced times'. </p>

<p>The Four Planets and the Moon by Alice Fock Hang, aged 11 - winner of the Young Competition. Photographing a planetary alignment requires rigor and patience but also a lot of luck. The image shows the Moon, Venus, Mercury, the star Antares, Jupiter and Saturn over the Indian Ocean</p>

<p>Waves by Bence Toth is the Sir Patrick Moore prize for best newcomer winner. The image shows the central region of the California Nebula (NGC 1499). It tries to show the uncontrollable vast energy of nature, in a form which resembles the huge waves of a storm in the ocean</p>

<p>The Green Lady by Nicholas Roemmelt of Germany won the aurorae category. The photographer had heard a lot of stories about the ‘lady in green’. Although he has had the chance to photograph the Northern Lights many times, he had never seen the ‘green lady’ before</p>

<p>As well as the overall winner, there are category winners including galaxies, aurorae, our own Moon, the Sun, people and space, planets, comets and asteroids and skyscapes. There are also prizes for young astronomers and the best newcomer.</p>

<p>Other category winning images including the breath-taking Aurora Borealis above Hamn i Senja, Skaland, Norway taken by Nicolas Roemmelt in Germany in the aurora category and pictures of Jupiter and its moons by Lukasz Sujka.   </p>

<p>Sujka, from Poland, showcases the alignment of our moon and Jupiter, framed by three of Jupiter’s moons in his image that won the planets, comets and asteroids category.</p>

<p>A remarkable illustration of 'The Prison of Technology', the satellite trails between earth and the Albireo double star, won the people and space category - taken by photographer Rafael Schmall of Hungary. </p>

<p>Best Newcomer Bence Toth won with a stunning image of the central region of the California Nebula, and the young competition winner was an image of four planets and the Moon by 11-year-old Alice Fock Hang.</p>

<p>Tycho Crater Region with Colours by Alain Paillou won the Our Moon category. This picture combines one session with a black-and-white camera, to capture the details and sharpness, and one session with a colour camera, to capture the colours of the soils</p>

<p>Liquid Sunshine by Alexandra Hart. Solar minimum may be seen as a quiet Sun and deemed dull in white light, but if you look closely at the small-scale structure, the surface is alive with motion</p>

<p>Cosmic Inferno by Peter Ward of Australia won the stars and nebulae category. It shows NGC 3576 - a well know nebulae in the southern skies and is shown without any stars and a false colour palette making it look like a celestial fire-maelstrom</p>

<p>BBC Sky at Night Magazine’s Art Editor Steve Marsh, who is also a judge for the competition, said of this year’s contest: 'Another year of incredible variety, ingenuity and show stopping talent has given us a real feast for the eyes in the 2020 competition. </p>

<p>'From vast aurora to fiery nebulae to an intimate look at our closest galactic neighbour, there really is something for everyone and the worldwide astrophotography community continues to impress and amaze us at every step.'</p>

<p>Dr Emily Drabek-Maunder, Astronomer at Royal Museums Greenwich and judge for the competition, said: 'The global situation made judging and shortlisting extremely challenging this year, particularly with judges spread across different countries! </p>

<p>'However, the photographs have exceeded our expectations and the innovation demonstrated by the entrants has been phenomenal.'</p>

<p>The Prison of Technology by Rafael Schmall of hungry won the people and space category and shows the Albireo double star surrounded by trails of moving satellites</p>

<p>Space Between Us is an image by Lukasz Sujka of Poland. It shows the close alignment of the Moon and Jupiter that happened on October 31, 2019. In the full resolution picture, you’ll see that there are three of Jupiter’s moons also visible</p>

<p>Painting the Sky by Thomas Kast of Germany was the skyscapes winner and shows polar stratospheric clouds over Lapland. The clouds slowly changed their shape and colours. It was like watching someone painting, especially when the Sun was lower – it started to get a darker orange and the pink shades became stronger</p>

<p>NGC 3628 with 300,000 Light Year Long Tail by Mark Hanson was the runner-up in the galaxies category. NGC 3628 is a popular galaxy target for both astrophotographers and visual observers with its distinctive dust lane. This image is an epic undertaking of five years of exposures taken with three different telescopes, although the majority of the exposure was in 2019</p>

<p>In each of the categories there was a winner, runner-up and highly commended entry, all of which will be shown at the National Maritime Museum exhibition that opens on October 23, 2020.</p>

<p>Lefaudeux's Andromeda Galaxy at Arm's Length won both the galaxy and overall prize. Despite being two million light years from Earth, the image appears to be within reach. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is just an illusion. In order to obtain the tilt-shift effect, the photographer 3D-printed a part to hold the camera at an angle at the focus of the telescope. </p>

<p>The blur created by the defocus at the edges of the sensor gives this illusion of closeness to Andromeda. </p>

<p>Not all galaxies have an easily memorable name such as Andromeda. The runner-up in the galaxy competition was a picture of NGC 3628 with a 300,000 light year long tail by Mark Hanson of the US.</p>

<p>NGC 3628 is a popular galaxy target for both astrophotographers and visual observers with its distinctive dust lane. </p>

<p>Studies by professional astronomers have shown that the evolution of some galaxies are the product of a series of minor merges with smaller dwarf galaxies. </p>

<p>This image is an epic undertaking of five years of exposures taken with three different telescopes, although the majority of the exposure was in 2019.  </p>

<p>HDR Partial Lunar Eclipse With Clouds by Ethan Roberts of the UK was runner up in the Moon category. During the 2019 partial lunar eclipse, the photographer managed to capture this fantastic image of the Moon while a small cloud passed in front of it. You can see the Earth's shadow on the top right and its striking orange colour caused by the Sun’s light passing through the atmosphere</p>

<p>Lone Tree under a Scandinavian Aurora by Tom Archer was a runner-up in the aurora category. When he found this tree, he decided to wait for the misty conditions to change and could not believe his luck when the sky cleared and the aurora came out in the perfect spot</p>

<p>Moon Base by Daniel Koszela was highly commended in the Our Moon category. This photo shows the Full Moon over the highest peak of the Krkonoše Mountains, Śnieżka at 1602 metres. The single frame image was taken in December 2019, shortly after sunset, two kilometres from the summit</p>

<p>The Moon category was particularly popular, with pictures ranging from close ups of a crater through to potential Moon bases and a partial lunar eclipse.</p>

<p>The winning entry in the Moon category was of the Tycho Crater Region with Colours by Alain Paillou of France. The Tycho crater is one of the most famous craters on the Moon. </p>

<p>This huge impact has left very impressive scars on the Moon’s surface. With the colours of the soils, Tycho is even more impressive. This picture combines one session with a black-and-white camera, to capture the details and sharpness, and one session with a colour camera, to capture the colours of the soils. </p>

<p>These colours come mainly from metallic oxides in small balls of glass and can give useful information about the Moon’s geology and history. The blue shows a high titanium oxide concentration and the red shows high iron oxide concentration. </p>

<p>This picture reveals the incredible beauty and complexity of our natural satellite.  </p>

<p>Moon Base by Daniel Koszela of Poland was highly recommended in the Moon category - it shows the Full Moon over the highest peak of the Krkonoše Mountains, Śnieżka. </p>

<p>The single frame image was taken in December 2019, shortly after sunset, one and a half miles from the summit. </p>

<p>The weather was perfect with few clouds and no wind. The building on the left is a meteorological observatory and on the right you can see the chapel of St. Lawrence.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Iceland by Kristina Makeeva was highly commended in the aurorae category. Winters in Iceland require some training in terms of wind protection equipment. Iceland is a country with very strong winds, so a stable tripod is required to shoot the aurora.</p>

<p>Light Bridge in the Sky by Xiuquan Zhang - aged 12 from China - was highly commended in the Young category. The photographer had never seen such a scene before! The aurora is magical, as you can see in this photo</p>

<p>The Dolphin Jumping out of an Ocean of Gas by Connor Matherne was the runner up in the stars and nebulae category. This target is officially known as Sh2-308, but the photographer has always enjoyed calling it the Dolphin Nebula</p>

<p>In the stars and nebulae category an image by Peter Ward of Australia, dubbed Cosmic Inferno, won the main prize.  </p>

<p>NGC 3576 is a well-known nebula in southern skies, but is shown here without any stars. Software reveals just the nebula, which has been mapped into a false colour palette. </p>

<p>The scene takes on the look of a celestial fire-maelstrom. The image is intended to reflect media images taken in Australia during 2019 and 2020, where massive bushfires caused the destruction of native forests and have claimed over 12 million acres of land. </p>

<p>It shows nature can act on vast scales and serves as a stark warning that our planet needs nurturing. </p>

<p>The Dolphin Jumping out of an Ocean of Gas by Connor Matherne from the US was the runner-up in this category.</p>

<p>This target is officially known as Sh2-308, but the photographer has always enjoyed calling it the Dolphin Nebula. It is a bubble of gas being shed by the bright blue star in the centre of the image as it enters its pre-supernova phase. </p>

<p>The red star to the right could possibly be influencing the shape too and might be responsible for the bill of the dolphin. While it won’t explode in our lifetimes, seeing the warning signs are quite neat.  </p>

<p>AZURE Vapor Tracers by Yang Sutie of China was highly commended in the people and space category. The colours were actually created by the ‘Auroral Zone Upwelling Rocket Experiment (AZURE)’ from Andøya Space Centre which dispersed gas tracers to probe winds in Earth’s upper atmosphere</p>

<p>Observe the Heart of the Galaxy by Tian Li of China was runner up in the people and space category. This image depicts the photographer climbing the radio telescope and Mingantu solar radio telescope array</p>

<p>Ultraviolet by Alan Friedman of the US was highly commended in the Our Sun category and shows our host star through a specialised solar telescope that transmits light in near UV</p>

<p>Voice of the Universe by Weijian Chen of China was highly commended in the skyscapes category. This is the aerial radar tower on the edge of the city of Taiyuan. Looking up from the middle of the mountain, it is more like a launch tower that communicates with extra-terrestrial civilizations</p>
