<p>The presenter, 33, told MailOnline he has 'one last shot' at turning pro after admitting he wrecked his chances as a youth player at Tottenham Hotspur by not dedicating his life to the sport.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview, Mark reveals he's turned down an approach from non-league side Billericay Town and is targeting a move to a club towards the top end of the football spectrum – and wants to document his journey on a TV show.</p>

<p>'I am toying with the idea': Michelle Keegan is set to become a WAG after husband Mark Wright confirmed he's pursuing a career in professional football</p>

<p>Mark, whose younger brother Josh plays for League 2 side Leyton Orient, said: 'I would definitely debate pursuing football. Before it's too late that's something I would love to do.</p>

<p>'I am toying with the idea of having one last shot. I have been thinking about it lately. But if I do it, it has to be now because I'm 33.</p>

<p>'I came away from football too young if you ask me. I ruined my career by my own faults when I was 21 and it's something that has always stuck with me.</p>

<p>'I have definitely been toying with the idea and will review it over the next month and decide if I want to give it a go.</p>

<p>Dream: The presenter said he has 'one last shot' at turning pro after admitting he wrecked his chances as a youth player at Tottenham Hotspur by not dedicating his life to the sport</p>

<p>'I was asked to go to Billericay Town but if I think if I was to do it – Billericay are a great club but if I was to do it I'd want to play for the professional leagues because that would be the whole point. </p>

<p>'I played at Billericay's level for a while when I was young but the thing I never did was play for the football professional league because I retired too young so if I could go back and give it that one shot and document it for a TV show, that's what I'd want.'</p>

<p>Mark, who married actress Michelle, 33, in 2015, explained his dream of becoming a pro footballer was left in tatters after he started partying in clubs, instead of staying committed to his fitness.</p>

<p>Now, after launching his career on TOWIE, the star said not reaching his full potential on the pitch is one of his biggest regrets in life.</p>

<p>'It ruined my career': Mark explained his dream of becoming a pro footballer was left in tatters after he started partying in clubs, instead of staying committed to his fitness (pictured in 2011)</p>

<p>He continued: 'I was flying when I was at Tottenham as a youth team player and I was pushing to play in the first team but I went away one summer and didn't train and took my foot off the gas.</p>

<p>'I went back to training and I was overweight and unfit. I was out of shape and not the player I once was and I lost my confidence, which ruined my career.</p>

<p>'I am so driven now as I remember that moment and what I did and I don't want it to ever happen again.'</p>

<p>Mark launched his presenting career in the US by starring alongside Mario Lopez on TV show Extra.</p>

<p>He left the role after two years in 2019 to move back to the UK and spend more time with wife Michelle. </p>

<p>'I miss home too much': Mark, who married actress Michelle Keegan in 2015, hopes to further his career stateside, but vows not to move on a permanent basis due to missing his family </p>

<p>But Mark still hopes to land further work stateside, though he's now against moving there for good. </p>

<p>He said: 'I would always love to work in America but I wouldn't like to live there again.</p>

<p>'If I was to do a show in America I'd like it to be a series so it comes and ago for a couple of months.</p>

<p>'I love Los Angeles so much and I love the American audience. I don't want to live there again because I miss home too much but I would definitely work out there again.'</p>

<p>Happy: Mark launched his presenting career in the US by starring alongside Mario Lopez on TV show Extra but moved home after two years to spend more time with wife, Michelle </p>
