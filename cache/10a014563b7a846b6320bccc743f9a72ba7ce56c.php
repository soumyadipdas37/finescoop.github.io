<p>Kim is reportedly worried about the 'vicious cycle' her husband is experiencing, after a series of bizarre Twitter rants and posting a video of him appearing to urinate on one of his Grammys statues.  </p>

<p>They went on to say how Kim knows it is difficult for Kanye 'being isolated and alone'.</p>

<p>'Kim is holding onto her marriage with Kanye and knows that he is bipolar and struggling with his mental health and wants to be there for him and help,' the source explained. </p>

<p>Kim is well aware that Kanye often struggles with his mental heath, so the KKW Beauty CEO wants him to know that she is doing her best to empathize.</p>

<p>'She is continuing to support him and does her best to understand him and where he is coming from. She knows he is unconventional and has always known that.'</p>

<p>Despite offering support privately, Kardashian has not publicly commented on her husband's latest antics. </p>
