<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Adama Traore is poised to play as a wing-back in Wolves' season opener at Sheffield United on Monday following the departure of Matt Doherty to Tottenham.</p>

<p>Boss Nuno Espirito Santo remains in the hunt for a right-sided player following the £15million sale of Doherty yet it is likely that Traore - one of the stars of last season for Wolves - will step in at Bramall Lane on Monday unless a deal can be completed before then.</p>

<p>While Traore featured at wing-back on occasions last season, he did his best work on the right of a three-man attack and finished the league campaign with four goals and nine assists.</p>

<p>Adama Traore is poised to start as a right wing-back in Wolves' game against Sheffield United</p>

<p>The Midland outfit are in the market for a right-sided player following Matt Doherty's departure</p>

<p>Yet Sportsmail understands Nuno plans to make subtle changes to Wolves' style of play in the forthcoming campaign, to ensure they do not rely so much on counter-attacks to create chances. </p>

<p>With Traore on the right and Marcal, a recent signing from Lyon on the left, Nuno expects Wolves to have more pace at wing-back than they did last season, when Doherty and Jonny Otto were first choice.</p>

<p>Wolves have been prepared to listen to offers for Traore during this transfer window but as yet there has been nothing approaching their valuation of the 24-year-old, thought to be about £70million.</p>

<p>The club have already paid a club-record £35million to FC Porto for 18-year-old striker Fabio Silva and have signed midfielder Vitinha on a year's loan from the same club, as well as bringing in Marcal from Lyon for £1.8m.</p>

<p>Manager Nuno Espirito Santo is looking to change Wolves style to rely less on counter attacks </p>
