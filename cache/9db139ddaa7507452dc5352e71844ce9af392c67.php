<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The coronavirus crisis has pushed the arts to the 'point of no return', Andrew Lloyd Webber warned today.</p>

<p>The composer and theatre impresario lamented the impact of lockdown and social distancing, saying it had made it economically 'impossible' to run theatres.</p>

<p>Lord Lloyd-Webber complained that the Government had given him 'no satisfactory answer' over 'anomalies', such as why people can fly on a plane but not attend a musical without social distancing.</p>

<p>Giving evidence to the Culture Select Committee, he said Britain was a 'leader in world theatre' and should be given the green light to 'demonstrate how we can reopen'.</p>

<p> 'We simply have to get our arts sector back open and running,' he said. 'We are at the point of no return really.'</p>

<p>Lord Lloyd-Webber cited an acquaintance who was 'one of the finest viola players I know', but was currently working in a supermarket.</p>

<p>'There comes a point now when we really can't go on much more,' he said. </p>

<p>Andrew Lloyd Webber (pictured giving evidence with theatre chief executive Rebecca Kane Burton) lamented the impact of lockdown and social distancing on the arts</p>

<p>The composer and impressario, who wrote Phantom of the Opera, said it had become economically 'impossible' to run theatres</p>

<p>The Government rescue package was 'giving money to buildings to keep the lights off' and going down a 'bottomless pit' instead of 'getting the buildings open', he added.</p>

<p>The peer said he had spent £100,000 on a pilot project, trialling measures at the London Palladium, in the hope that it could show how they can open at full capacity safely.</p>

<p>'I am absolutely confident that the air in the London Palladium and in all my theatres is purer than the air outside,' he said.</p>

<p>Hinting at the consequences on the industry if there is not more support from the Government, he said his production of Cinderella might have to open 'where people are being a little more helpful'.</p>

<p>And following a quip that he could stage a production on an aeroplane, he joked: 'We did think of turning the London Palladium into a garden centre at one point.'</p>

<p>Rebecca Kane Burton, chief executive of Andrew Lloyd Webber's theatres, said recent months had been 'devastating and catastrophic' for the sector.</p>

<p>'It's a really bad, catastrophic time and we need to find a way out of it,' she added.</p>

<p>It was 'disheartening' and 'frustrating' that their 'pilot wasn't later seen as a way to getting full reopening.'</p>

<p>Asked about possible reasons why the purpose behind the pilot changed, she said 'there was a nervousness about pubs opening and wanting to see what the impact of that was'.</p>

<p>And she added: 'We need the time to plan. We can't switch on theatre like a tap. Christmas is hanging on the balance as we speak.'</p>

<p>Lucy Noble, artistic and commercial director of the Royal Albert Hall and chair of the National Arenas Association, told the committee that the Government's £1.57billion rescue package did not turn out to be 'what it was hailed to be'.</p>

<p>'The Royal Albert Hall was hailed as one of the crown jewels that this package would save,' she said.</p>

<p>'We have been told we are not eligible for any of the grant at all.</p>

<p>'We are only eligible to take a loan. We've already taken £10 million worth of loans. We'd rather not get into any more debt.</p>

<p>'I don't think it's quite ended up being what it was hailed to be. People saw that announcement and thought, 'the Royal Albert Hall is OK now'.</p>

<p>'So the philanthropic gifts have stopped coming in because they think we have been saved by the Government, when in fact we haven't at all.'</p>

<p>Lucy Noble, artistic and commercial director of the Royal Albert Hall (pictured, the Last Night of the Proms in 2014), told the committee that the Government's £1.57billion rescue package did not turn out to be 'what it was hailed to be'</p>

<p>If the Hall cannot open fully until Christmas next year then we are in a 'serious' and 'mothballing' situation, she warned, and it was getting to 'crunch point'.</p>

<p>Asked about holding the Proms without an audience in the venue, she said the Government's announcement on allowing socially distanced, indoor audiences 'came too late'.</p>

<p>Venues 'are on their knees financially,' she added.</p>

<p>Melvin Benn, the managing director of promoter Festival Republic, told MPs 'you can't have festivals with social distancing' and that he believed testing could be the solution.</p>

<p>'I felt that from day one, that the Government really were hoping that the vaccine would come through… and that would solve the problem,' he said.</p>

<p>One MP on the committee read out an email which was sent from an actor, saying that 'not one West End actor or performer is in furlough'.</p>

<p>'From a performer's point of view, Rome is now burnt and we are living in the cinders,' the actor said.</p>
