<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> A teenager placed in secure unit after after run-ins with police must have his phone and the opportunity to play online games, a High Court judge has ruled.</p>

<p>Mr Justice Holman said removing a phone from a young person was a 'very severe' thing and council staff should ensure that the 16-year-old boy could charge it as well as make sure that he had access to WiFi, so that he could use his games console. </p>

<p>Social services staff had raised a concern about the boy,  who lives in south-east England, having a phone and said there was a risk that he could leave the specialist unit where he is being held.</p>

<p>The teen who is placed in a secure unit must have his mobile phone a High Court judge ruled</p>

<p>But barrister Thomas Jones, who represented the boy, said denying him access to a phone and games console was disproportionate.</p>

<p>Mr Justice Holman agreed and said the boy should be able to call his parents and friends, and play online games, if he wanted to.</p>

<p>He made rulings while analysing the boy's case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London.</p>

<p>The judge said the boy, who is in the care of Croydon Council, could not be identified in media reports of the case.</p>

<p>He was told that the youngster had been placed at a unit in northern England recently after going missing and being picked up by police.</p>

<p>The 16 -year- old boy  is in the care of Croydon Council after run-ins with police</p>

<p>The judge heard that the boy had been involved with police a number of times and was told there was evidence linking him to drug distribution.</p>

<p>Mr Justice Holman gave his approval to the boy remaining in secure accommodation but said the case would be reviewed in the near future.</p>

<p>The judge said he was concerned about the boy being hundreds of miles away from his home area.</p>

<p>In recent years, a series of judges have raised concern about children having to live in units many miles from their homes because of a shortage of secure units in England and Wales.</p>
