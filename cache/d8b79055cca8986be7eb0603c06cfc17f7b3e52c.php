<p>'She's too young': Katie Price divided fans as she shared photos of her daughter Bunny in a full face of make-up and false lashes on Instagram on Sunday</p>

<p>The media personality, who shares Bunny and Jett, six, with ex Kieran Hayler, Junior, 15, and Princess, 13, with former spouse Peter Andre, and Harvey, 18, from a relationship with his estranged father Dwight Yorke, 48, claimed her kid's love for beauty runs in the family.</p>

<p>She wrote in an accompanying caption: 'Bunny loves makeup so much which isn’t a surprise because her sister <?php echo e('@'); ?>officialprincess_andre and me love it.' (sic)</p>

<p>Coming under fire on social media, some commented: 'Too young .. not a good look.... Not false eyelashes no far too young. Make up yes all girls want too.</p>

<p>There's no stopping her: A month earlier, the reality star, 42, uploaded a slew of snaps of herself posing with her mini-me, who also rocked a leather jacket and the same make-up look</p>

<p>Cute: The former glamour model's child wore foundation, glittery eyeshadow and eyelash extensions</p>

<p>'She’s beautiful...but nobody needs fake lashes... Too young to be wearing fake eyelashes but ok.</p>

<p>'Personally she's a bit young for makeup, but it's gonna happen with a beautiful mummy like hers. She is so like you Katie! What a pretty little girl.' (sic)</p>

<p>Others stood by the reality TV star's choice as they added: 'Ah so cute and they haters will come but every little girl loves 2 try out make up don’t see the harm.</p>

<p>'Hahaha the Karen’s. so what’s the difference between this and dance kids? My daughters have worn makeup on stage for dance comps since they were 3... and yes lashes and all!! Some people are far too sensitive!</p>

<p>'Bunny loves make-up so much which isn't a surprise!' The My Crazy Life star claimed Bunny's love for beauty runs in the family</p>

<p>'Your baby you do what you want and she clearly loves it xx </p>

<p>'Omg the comments, most little girls want to experiment with make up, I bought my 8 year old some of her own as I was sick of her in my make up bag! We also have lovely little mother and daughter bonding times when I crimp or straighten her hair and I proudly post the pics on my social media. </p>

<p>'I’m not one for the pageants or dancers caked in fake tan but ffs what exactly is wrong with a bit on make up on if it makes the child happy and gives them a happy memory of their childhood!! </p>

<p>Uh oh: Mother-of-five Katie sparked backlash from some of her social media followers who claimed her youngest child is 'far too young' to experiment with make-up</p>

<p>'I don’t see a prob with this at all, if she likes makeup like this she might grow up to be a professional makeup artist... If your a young dancer they look like this and put lashes on etc etc pretty dresses... let her dress up she’s only doing girly stuff after all xx.' (sic) MailOnline has contacted Katie's representatives for further comment. </p>

<p>A month earlier, Katie uploaded a slew of snaps of herself posing with Bunny, who also rocked a leather jacket and the same make-up look.</p>
