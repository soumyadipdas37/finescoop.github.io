<p>Lady Bianca Eliot’s personal life has been blighted by sadness, but I am delighted to report that she is expecting her fourth child.</p>

<p>Bianca’s first husband was Lord Eliot, heir to the sprawling Port Eliot estate in Cornwall. Tragically, he died aged just 40 in 2006 following an epileptic fit. Lady B was left a widow at 29 with three children.</p>

<p>Four years later she was engaged to Earl Spencer – Princess Diana’s brother Charles – but he dumped her weeks before their wedding.</p>

<p>She now lives with 36-year-old Mark Tamburrino, at Port Eliot, and their baby is due around Christmas. A friend tells me: ‘They are always friendly and kind – the locals can’t wait until they open The Eliot Arms, the pub they recently bought here.’</p>

<p>If Lady B marries Mark, she will lose her title but if she’s running the pub at least she’ll gain another one – landlady!</p>

<p>Lady Bianca (above) and Mark plan to open a pub. A friend says: ‘They are always friendly and kind – the locals can’t wait until they open The Eliot Arms, the pub they recently bought here’</p>

<p>Poor Liam Gallagher can’t work out how his fire works. </p>

<p>Former Oasis bandmate Paul Arthurs tells me: ‘We both have log burners. I sent him a video of mine and Liam texted, “Mine’s rubbish, it don’t work. I put paper in and I threw logs on and it just went out.” ’ </p>

<p>Liam, are you sure she’s not electric?</p>
