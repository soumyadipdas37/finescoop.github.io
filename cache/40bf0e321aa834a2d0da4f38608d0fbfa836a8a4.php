<p>Sony announced pricing and release dates for its PlayStation 5 Wednesday and opened pre-orders one day early shortly after the event – creating a buying frenzy in the gaming community</p>

<p>Many gamers flocked to Twitter to share their frustrations, with some saying the technologies were mostly bought up by bots or people looking to flip the console for more than what it costs.</p>

<p>PlayStation 5 pre-orders were not set to open until Thursday, September 17, as the gaming system shared a tweet shortly after the event: ‘PS5 pre-orders will be available starting as early as tomorrow at select retailers.’</p>

<p>However, many retailers seemed to jump the gun and offer the gaming console earlier- even without having any physical systems.</p>

<p>GameStop shared a news release stating it was now taking pre-orders for the PS5 Wednesday evening and quickly ran out of stock.</p>

<p>Jason Celso was also unable to secure the gaming console, but is hopefully to have better luck pre-ordering the Xbox Series X</p>
