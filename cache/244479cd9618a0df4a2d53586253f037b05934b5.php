<p>The topsy-turvy British weather lived up to its reputation Thursday night as some areas were left looking decidedly wintery following hail and snow showers less than 48 hours after the end of a September heatwave.</p>

<p>But calmer weather is expected to make a comeback this morning with temperatures staying around 50F but 'dry and sunny conditions' continuing throughout the day.</p>

<p>A Meteogroup forecast revealed the country would have 'a clear and cold start with early pacts of frost which will soon clear'. </p>

<p>It added: 'It will then be a fine day as it will be dry and bright with plenty of sunshine but patchy cloud will build bringing a chance of showers, mostly across eastern areas.'</p>

<p>There will be more 'outbreaks of rain for south-east England during the evening', it continued.</p>

<p>Severe weather hit parts of the North of England as temperatures plunged to -5C (19F) in Scotland following a late burst of heat at the start of the week that saw the mercury rise to 26C (79F) in southern England. </p>

<p>It came as England had its first couple of evenings of new measures aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus, with all pubs, bars and restaurants having to shut by 10pm last night to comply with new rules brought in this week. </p>

<p>Highs of just 15C (59F) are expected in England this weekend although sunshine is expected for many parts of the country, just days after temperatures more akin to an August day on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Drivers across West Yorkshire including Bradford and Leeds were left battling a temporary hail whiteout Thursday amid snow showers, while in nearby Baildon and Shipley the stormy conditions led to reports of flash flooding. </p>

<p>Stunning images and video captured the thunderstorm and the aftermath, which left sleet, snow and sludge on roads on Thursday.</p>

<p>Thunder and lightning also hit parts of the city with localised flooding reported on roads and power supplies cut off.</p>

<p>Carey Davies, who captured footage of the storm, said: 'Raging thunderstorm, electricity gone, world instantly turned into winter. Another classic 2020 prank.'</p>

<p>Ian Cormack snapped a shocking picture of sleet and sludge on the road after his usual 30 minute commute home from work took three times as long.</p>

<p>He said: 'I was driving home and it usually takes around half an hour, it took me an hour and half, it was that bad.</p>

<p>'The roads were full of sleet, snow and hail, I had to divert and go a longer way round.</p>

<p>'I parked up my car and took the picture, it was pretty shocking to be honest.</p>

<p>'When I left Keighley at 4.30 it was fine but when I got to Ilkley Moor, there was a storm and it was three degrees.</p>

<p>One social media user said: 'From beautiful weather to this in just two days, can't make it up.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'This is typical of 2020'.</p>

<p>Met Office forecaster John Griffiths said the storms were caused by a low pressure system over much of the UK and land heated by the sun which is enough to warm 'the cold air aloft and generate these thunder storms'.</p>

<p>Conditions remained chilly, with eastern England feeling particularly cold amid persistent rain and strong northerly winds – with the area put under two Met Office weather warnings for the rest of the day. </p>

<p>Strong winds were already battering coastal areas of England yesterday, with waves seen crashing against coastlines at Newcastle and Seaham in the north east. </p>
