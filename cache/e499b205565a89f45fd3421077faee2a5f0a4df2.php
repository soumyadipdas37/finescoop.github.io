<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australians who've been working from home during the coronavirus crisis are expected to miss out on $1.1billion in unclaimed expenses. </p>

<p>Experts say taxpayers miss out on what they are owed by the taxman because they're either uniformed or trying to save time. </p>

<p>Almost six million workers were been forced to get their job done from home during the height of the pandemic - about half of Australia's entire workforce.</p>

<p>But as a result, taxpayers are entitled to claim a range of new expenses to partially offset the once-in-a-lifetime upheaval.</p>

<p>If you want to maximise your returns before the October 31 deadline, there are a few things you should know. </p>

<p>Expert Andrew Chia, from TaxFox, told Daily Mail Australia the most important thing to keep in mind is that saving time will not save you money.</p>

<p>Australians who've been working from home during the coronavirus crisis are expected to miss out on $1.1billion in unclaimed expenses</p>

<p>The Australian Tax Office has introduced an 80 cents per hour shortcut for anyone who was obliged to perform services at home.  </p>

<p>'We advise our clients to not use the shortcut,' Mr Chia said.</p>

<p>Every person working from home in a house or apartment will be entitled to claim a flat rate of 80 cents an hour</p>

<p>It will cover March 1 to June 30, 2020</p>

<p>They will also be allowed to claim 52 cents an hour for heating, lighting, cleaning and depreciation of furniture and computers</p>

<p>'If you are an office worker performing duties at home the main claimable expenses are your running costs like electricity, gas and other utilities like internet.' </p>

<p>Mr Chia strongly suggests you calculate the costs yourself or get a professional to assist because you're likely to be entitle to far more than 80 cents per working hour.</p>

<p>Anyone working from home can also claim computer, mobile phone and screen expenses, as well as any other equipment used for work.  </p>

<p>'If you have had to purchase a table, a chair, desk or if you had to add anything to make your home work space conform with Occupational Health and Safety requirements such as lights or lamps, it's deductible,' Mr Chia said.</p>

<p>Some of the lesser known items that are also claimable when working from home are plants, anti-glare reading glasses for looking at computer screens, and various home office essentials such as printer ink.</p>

<p>For those who didn't have the option to work from home, Mr Chia stressed that personal protective equipment is also tax deductible.  </p>

<p>'Healthcare workers and essential services workers had to continue to support our local communities and the broader economy by performing their services during the pandemic and obviously we appreciate them so much for that,' he said.</p>

<p>'And they may have had to purchase items to make themselves safe for work. So any masks and safety gear can be deducted if they are not provided by their employment.'</p>

<p>Essential services workers can claim protective equipment such as face masks and gloves</p>

<p>Those working from home may also be able to claim items like plants and printer ink</p>

<p>This also extends to essential workers who are travelling to and from work, not just at work.</p>

<p>With the economic uncertainty around the pandemic, Scott Morrison's government introduced a number of grants and support payments to cushion the surge in job losses. </p>

<p>'People receiving JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments must be aware they also have to report that income as part of their tax return,' Mr Chia said.</p>

<p>Last year Australian workers missed out on $10billion in unclaimed deductions.</p>

<p>To make sure you don't miss out, Mr Chia says taxpayers should use technology to their advantage and get an tax app like TaxFox.</p>

<p>'If you have a systematic approach where you just take photos of receipts throughout the year, you won't miss out on deductions and it will save you time and effort,' he said. </p>

<p>To make sure you don't miss out on any potential deductions, Mr Chia says taxpayers should use technology to their advantage</p>
