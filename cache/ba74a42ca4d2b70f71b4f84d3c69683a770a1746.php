<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>While Donald Trump showered some rare words of praise on Democratic nominee Joe Biden Monday morning, he also took aim at the candidate's mental state, claiming he's not 'all there.'</p>

<p>'Look, I think he's a professional,' Trump said in a call-in interview with Fox &amp; Friends when asked about the upcoming debate. 'I don't know if he's all there but I think he's a professional… and that he can debate.'</p>

<p>'I have to assume he's going to do great — because he's been there 47 years he's been in the public service. A long time,' the president continued of Biden's long track record in Washington.</p>

<p>Part of his comments are a sharp turnaround from the president's previous insistence that his superior mental and physical abilities and stamina will lead him to destroy Biden in any head-to-head matchup.</p>

<p>Trump and Biden will face-off in the first of three presidential debates next Tuesday, September 29.</p>

<p>The debate comes as Biden has earned enough in fundraising and donations recently to give him a significant financial advantage over his billionaire competitor.</p>

<p>Biden's campaign and aligned Democratic Party committees entered the fall sprint to Election Day with $466 million in cash reserves.</p>

<p>This puts Team Biden about $141 million ahead of Donald Trump's camp.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump gave some rare praise to Joe Biden on Monday, claiming the candidate 'can debate' and is 'professional'</p>

<p>The comments come as Trump and Biden are set to face-off in the first presidential debate next Tuesday in Cleveland, Ohio</p>

<p>Trump's campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh announced on Twitter last week that the campaign and Republican started September with $325 million in its cash stockpile.</p>

<p>This is a major difference from the opening months of the general election, at which point Trump enjoyed an intimidating financial lead.</p>

<p>Trump brushed off the new numbers by pointing to the last election where he was outspent by Hillary Clinton's campaign.</p>

<p>When asked whether he would spend his own money, Trump told Fox News on Monday: 'I would do that…if we needed money- but we don't need money.'</p>

<p>Trump made sure to still get in a few jabs at Biden's mental health.</p>

<p>'I don't understand what's going on,' he told the three-person Fox &amp; Friends panel. 'He doesn't seem to be answering questions and he can't answer questions. And much worse, a little while ago when he was on stage with the Democrats — he couldn't do well.'</p>

<p>The president also pointed to the Biden v. Senator Bernie Sanders Democratic primary debate, which Trump admits was a good moment for the former vice president.</p>

<p>'He did okay with Bernie — it was sort of a tie,' Trump conceded, adding: 'It was nothing great… It was ok. It was fine.'</p>

<p>Record-breaking fundraising began streaming in for Biden last month after he announced Senator Kamala Harris would be joining his presidential ticket.</p>

<p>Trump and Biden will face off in three debates – the first next week in Cleveland, Ohio moderated by Fox News host Chris Wallace.</p>

<p>The second will be moderated by C-SPAN's Steve Scully and will take place Thursday, October 15 at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, Florida – the original hosts at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor withdrew over health concerns stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>It will be held in town hall meeting format.</p>

<p>The third and final debate will take place Thursday, October 22 at the Curb Event Center at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. NBC News' Kristen Welker will moderate.</p>
