<p>All smiles: Bella Varelis was all smiles as she stepped out to grab a coffee with co-star and housemate Bec Cvilikas in Sydney on Thursday</p>

<p>The brunette beauty couldn't stop grinning as she carried the two coffees to the car where Bec was waiting for her. </p>

<p>Possibly in a bid to fly under the radar, the aspiring influencer hid her famous face behind a pair of sunglasses.</p>

<p>Bella penned a heartfelt message to Locky Gilbert ahead of Thursday night's gripping season finale.</p>

<p>The message was released on The Bachelor's official Instagram account.</p>

<p>Balancing act: The brunette beauty couldn't stop grinning as she carried the two coffees to the car where Bec was waiting for her</p>

<p>Undercover: Possibly in a bid to fly under the radar, the aspiring influencer hid her famous face behind a pair of sunglasses</p>

<p>'Never in a million years did I think I would be stepping out of the limo that first night and meeting someone who I'd connect with on so many levels,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Bella said after a 'long' and 'incredible' journey, she can see herself with him, which she called 'simultaneously exciting and petrifying.'</p>

<p>'After a very long, incredible journey and seeing Locky with my loved ones, I have a full heart and I can definitely picture my life with him.'</p>

<p>Leggy display: The 25-year-old stunned in a casual T-shirt and a tiny pair of matching shorts that showed off her trim pins</p>

<p>She finished by saying that Bachelor has been a 'wild ride' and she is 'grateful' for what she has learnt along the way.</p>

<p>'Regardless of the outcome, this has been one heck of a wild ride and I'm so grateful for the beautiful people I've met along the way and everything I've learnt about myself.'</p>

<p>Fans are still guessing who will win Locky's heart. The two finalists are Bella and 31-year-old nurse Irena.</p>

<p>Cheeky: The star showed off her toned physique as she leaned into the car </p>

<p>Paparazzi pictures have emerged that prove the brunette spent the night with former Bachelorette star Nathan Favro at the weekend.</p>

<p>One of Bella's neighbours in Sydney spotted Nathan's Toyota HiLux parked outside her home at about 8pm on Saturday night.</p>

<p>The following morning, at about 9:45am, a nervous-looking Nathan, 25, was pictured leaving the apartment and driving away.</p>

<p>While these photos aren't irrefutable proof that Bella and Nathan are dating - they could be just friends or he could be seeing Bec - they leave little doubt that Bella doesn't win Locky's heart.</p>

<p>Time to go! Bella opened the door with one hand while holding the coffee cups in the other</p>
