<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nicole Brown Simpson recounted the horrific abuse she suffered at the hands of OJ Simpson in her secret diaries where she wrote that he once screamed at her: ‘Get out my f****** house you fat a** liar!’</p>

<p>Nicole wrote about 60 occasions that Simpson allegedly physically abused and threatened her including during their stormy marriage.</p>

<p>In scratchy handwriting she wrote how he first beat her up in 1978 and punched and kicked her in their hotel room for hours while she tried to escape.</p>

<p>For the next 16 years the abuse included flipping out into a jealous rage and smashing her car up, throwing her against walls and repeatedly leaving her blackened and bruised.</p>

<p>Nicole Brown Simpson recounted the horrific abuse she suffered at the hands of OJ Simpson (pictured together in 1993 - a year before she was murdered) </p>

<p>One time Simpson beat her so badly that he tore her sweater and her socks off her body - while another time he screamed at her ‘I have a gun in my hand, get the f*** out of here!’</p>

<p>The diaries reveal a chilling pattern of abuse until Simpson allegedly murdered Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman in 1994 - he was acquitted of killing them both.</p>

<p>The documents feature in ‘OJ and Nicole: An American Tragedy’, a new documentary on Investigation Discovery.</p>

<p>It is due to air on Monday to coincide with the 25th anniversary of Simpson’s acquittal on October 3rd.</p>

<p>Tanya Brown, Nicole’s sister, says in the film: ‘Maybe she knew this was her destiny and maybe subconsciously she knew something was going to happen</p>

<p>‘Maybe that’s why she kept real detailed diary entries’.</p>

<p>The documents feature in ‘OJ and Nicole: An American Tragedy’, a new documentary on Investigation Discovery, airing on October 3. They were previously featured in Made in America (pictured) </p>

<p>Nicole described how her husband 'beat her for hours' in one harrowing entry </p>

<p>The diaries reveal a chilling pattern of abuse until Simpson allegedly murdered Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman in 1994 - he was acquitted of killing them both (pictured in Made in America (pictured)</p>

<p>The diaries were found in Nicole’s safe deposit box along with photos of her bruised face and apology letters from Simpson.</p>

<p>They were not admitted into evidence during Simpson’s trial because the judge ruled they were hearsay and have been largely ignored since then.</p>

<p>During Simpson’s trial the prosecution brought up his history of domestic violence to undermine his clean-cut image he cultivated as a football player and actor who starred in films like The Naked Gun.</p>

<p>But it didn’t work and the jury found him not guilty, a verdict Nicole’s family regard as an appalling miscarriage of justice.</p>

<p>The first diary entry is from 1978 and shows that Nicole was already realizing her fairytale boyfriend and future husband had a dark side.</p>

<p>They had met in Los Angeles where she moved to pursue a career in photography and had an ‘instant’ connection, Tanya tells the film</p>

<p>It reads: ‘1st time he beat me up after Louis + Nanie Mary anniversary party. Started on the street corner of NYC 5th Ave at about 9 (pm).</p>

<p>The diaries reveal a chilling pattern of abuse until Simpson allegedly murdered Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman in 1994 - he was acquitted of killing them both. O. J. Simpson sits in Superior Court in Los Angeles 08 December 1994 during his murder trial. He was later acquitted </p>

<p>‘Threw me on the floor, hit me, kicked me. we went to the hotel where he continued to beat me for hours and I continued crawling for the door’.</p>

<p>Another undated entry reads: ‘Smashed my car (white Mercedes) with Baseball Bat after visiting Tommy Hughes. He greeted me at the gate. I was too afraid to get out of the car. He did it because I was late, about 7-8pm’.</p>

<p>Despite this Nicole married Simpson in 1985 but the abuse continued, the diaries reveal.</p>

<p>An entry from 1986 reads: ‘Eric &amp; Val Von Watts. Listened to music at my place on Wilshire (Blvd in Los Angeles).</p>

<p>‘After we finished our drinks we left. (Simpson) beat me up so bad at home. Tore my blue sweater and blue socks completely off me. Went to hospital on Wilshire, pretended it was a bicycle accident’.</p>

<p>Another nasty episode happened on January 10, 1988.</p>

<p>At the time Nicole was two months pregnant with their son Justin and Simpson demanded she have an abortion and aimed a gun at her.</p>

<p>The diaries were found in Nicole’s safe deposit box along with photos of her bruised face and apology letters from Simpson (pictured together in 1984) </p>

<p>In her diary she wrote: ‘OJ was drunk, he never let up. Get out my f****** house you fat a** liar. I packed a few things together.</p>

<p>‘He locked the door again. I buzzed. Do I really have to go tonight? (Their daughter) Sydney’s sleeping, it’s late. Let me tell you how serious I am. I have a gun in my hand, get the f*** out of here’.</p>

<p>Nicole didn’t let on to her family that anything was wrong and it was not until she asked Simpson for a divorce that they had a clue.</p>

<p>Tanya says in the documentary that she was ‘angry’ at Nicole after she died for not saying anything, but she was under Simpson’s spell.</p>

<p>An entry from 1988 describes how a gay man kissed their son and it caused Simpson to flip out.</p>

<p>Nicole wrote: ‘OJ threw me against walls in our hotel and on the floor. Put bruises on my arms and back. The window scarred me - thought he’d throw me out’.</p>

<p>In the documentary former LAPD officer John Edwards recounts going to Simpson’s house the following year and finding a badly beaten Nicole after she called 911.</p>

<p>He says: ‘A woman came running out, a tall blonde woman, and she was yelling ‘he’s gonna kill me’. I said who? She said: ‘OJ’. I said ‘OJ Simpson?’ She said: ‘You’ve been up here eight times already and you’ve done nothing about it’.</p>

<p>During his testimony at Simpson’s trial Edwards said that Nicole ‘collapsed on me’ and was ‘wet and shivering, she was cold and she was beat up’.</p>

<p>Nicole had a cut one inch on her left upper lip, a swollen right forehead and her right eye was starting to blacken</p>

<p>Edwards told the jury: ‘I could see on her face she had a mark like a hiking boot, she looked like she’d been kicked in the head</p>

<p>‘I look over my head and here comes OJ Simpson right to where the gate is and he’s yelling, I mean screaming: ‘I don’t want you around here any more. I got two women, I don’t want you around here any more’.</p>

<p>Simpson was arrested for spousal battery and later pleaded no contest to the charges.</p>

<p>Brown filed for divorce in 1992 but she was unable to leave Simpson and wrote a letter in which she said she wanted him back. O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson walk the red carpet with their children Sydney and Justin as they attend the 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' Hollywood Premiere on March 16, 1994 </p>

<p>Brown filed for divorce in 1992 but she was unable to leave Simpson and wrote a letter in which she said she wanted him back.</p>

<p>In the documentary Tanya tearfully reads the letter and concludes: ‘It just shows you that she loved him and he loved her but I think he loved her too much’.</p>

<p>Nicole wrote: ‘I want to put our family back together! I want our kids to grow up with their parents. I thought I'd be happy raising Sydney &amp; Justin by myself -- since we didn't see too much of you anyway.</p>

<p>‘I want to be with you! I want to love you and cherish you, and make you smile. I want to wake up with you in the mornings and hold you at night. I want to hug and kiss you everyday. I want us to be the way we used to be.</p>

<p>‘For the past month I've been looking at our wedding tape and our family movies - and I can see that we truly loved each other’.</p>

<p>She signed off with: ‘I'll love you forever and always’.</p>

<p>On October 25 1993 Nicole dialed 911 yet again, telling the dispatcher: ‘He’s back’.</p>

<p>When told to stay on the line, Nicole says: ‘I don’t want to stay on the line he’s going to beat the s*** out of me’.</p>

<p>According to Nicole’s close friend Robin Greer, Simpson had become ‘very jealous’ that she had seen other men while they were apart.</p>

<p>On the 911 call Nicole can be heard saying: ‘OJ the kids are sleeping’.</p>

<p>Simpson shouters back: ‘You didn’t give a f*** about the kids when you were sucking his d*** in the living room!’</p>

<p>Nicole and Ron Goldman were found dead at her home in Brentwood on June 12 1994 - pictured is the bloodstained walkway to her home</p>

<p>O.J. Simpson holds up his hands to the jury showing leather gloves that prosecutors say he wore the night of the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. He was acquitted in the murder </p>

<p>Nicole and Ron Goldman were found dead at her home in Brentwood on June 12 1994.</p>

<p>Nicole had been out at a restaurant that evening and according to her family, it was one of the first times that Simpson was not welcome at one of their get togethers.</p>

<p>Nicole’s mother had left her glasses at the restaurant and she called Goldman, who worked there, and he offered to drop them off at her home.</p>

<p>Prosecutors alleged that when Simpson showed up to kill Nicole Goldman happened to be there and he killed him as well.</p>

<p>At the time Nicole was just 35 and Goldman was just 25.</p>

<p>Tanya Brown breaks down in tears again when she reads an entry in Nicole’s diary that she wrote one month before she was killed.</p>

<p>It read: ‘We’ve officially split. I’ve told OJ we’re going back to every other weekend. I need the rest. OJ is gone so much - he needs the alone time with them til he leaves again. He’s been gone the last 4 weekends - so I’ve asked if we can start with him this weekend’.</p>

<p>After Simpson was acquitted Goldman’s family made it their life’s mission to prove his guilt and brought a civil case against him, which they won.</p>

<p>A jury awarded them $33.5m damages but they have not received anything from Simpson and in the meantime the judgement has grown to $70m.</p>

<p>In 2008 Simpson was jailed for 33 years for an armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel involving his own memorabilia and was released early in 2017 having served nearly nine years.</p>

<p>Investigation Discovery boss Henry Schleiff said: ‘This documentary is not here to retell the famous trial, but to remember the woman who struggled with domestic violence and now tells her side of the story, in her words, for the first time’. </p>
