<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bungling developers building posh student homes have caused fury after cutting down a memorial tree for murdered television presenter Jill Dando by mistake.</p>

<p>The former BBC studios, where the tragic Crimewatch star started her career, are being replaced by a new student complex.</p>

<p>The scheme was only approved after the developers agreed to keep the beautiful 20- year old Acer tree that had become a spot where her friends and former colleagues went to remember her.</p>

<p>But it has now emerged the developers preserved the wrong tree at Walnut Gardens in Exeter, Devon - and cut down Jill's memorial last month.</p>

<p>Jill Dando's former colleagues noticed that the 20- year old tree was accidentally chopped down last month</p>

<p>It is understood a planning report identified the wrong tree to developers, leaving former colleagues and friends 'devastated' by the 'tragic' mistake.</p>

<p>The developers StudyInn have now apologised and pledged to plant a fresh memorial tree and commission a sculpture of her on the site instead.</p>

<p>Exeter City Council said the memorial Acer tree was not clearly marked and a walnut tree that was more than 100-years old was instead identified as the one that needed saving. </p>

<p>Developers StudyInn apologised for their mistake and pledged to plant another tree in Jill's memory</p>

<p>Ms Dando's former colleague at BBC Radio Devon Sarah Harris was among the friends who decided to plant the memorial tree where Ms Dando first worked for the corporation.</p>

<p>Sarah told the BBC she felt 'upset and very, very let down'.</p>

<p>She said she had been communicating with the council and developers since February 2019 to ensure the tree was saved and was given several assurances it would be.</p>

<p>TV presenter Jill Dando was murdered in 1999 outside her home</p>

<p>The former BBC studios, will be turned into new student homes</p>

<p>She added: 'I'm devastated, but to think the walnut tree was the memorial - I mean she died in 1999, not 1899.</p>

<p>'You can't have an old tree as a memorial tree - you plant a tree for somebody. I cannot believe it happened.'</p>

<p>Ms Harris added she did not blame the new developers who were given the wrong information.</p>

<p>The scheme for the student complex was only approved after reassurance that the memorial tree would stay intact</p>

<p>Journalist and presenter Jill, who was murdered in 1999 outside her home, started her career working for the BBC in Devon.</p>

<p>She became a newsreader for BBC Radio Devon in 1985 and that year, she transferred to BBC South West, where she presented a regional news magazine programme, Spotlight South West.</p>

<p>In 1987, she worked for Television South West, then BBC Spotlight before being transferred to London the following year where she went on to achieve national fame.</p>

<p>The tree was cut down in August and was noticed by another former colleague, Charles Eden, who went to look at the site to find 'bare earth'.</p>

<p> He said it was 'tragic' but he hoped the new tree and statue will be 'something Exeter can be proud of.'</p>

<p>Developer StudyInn confirmed the wrong tree was marked on a planning report.</p>

<p>A spokesperson said: 'We are very sorry and appreciate that this has caused distress'.</p>
