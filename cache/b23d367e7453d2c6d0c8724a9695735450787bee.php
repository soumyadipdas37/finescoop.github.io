<p>Lowe, 56, gave his own take on a fondness for bipartisanship in an era where it's been scarce.</p>

<p>'The people that I was always drawn to - the consensus builders and the people who could reach across the aisle, the stories of Tip O'Neill and [Ronald] Reagan battling and cursing each other and then going and having a whiskey and cutting a deal in the cloakrooms - that just doesn't exist anymore,' he said.</p>

<p>Baldwin has past compared Reagan to current former Vice President Joe Biden, who will face off with Trump in November's upcoming presidential election.</p>

<p>'My concern about Biden is - is he our Reagan? Is he the Democratic Ronald Reagan? Older,' he said on The View in February. 'People have been making all kinds of comments about him in terms of his age, and with the Republicans, it didn't matter. </p>

<p>'They were like, "Ronald Reagan has got six Hollywood anecdotes he could tell. That's good enough for us, let's get him out there."'</p>
