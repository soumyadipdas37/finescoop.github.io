<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A transgender woman who describes herself as a ‘Satanic anarchist’ has won the Republican Party nomination for sheriff in a New Hampshire county after running on a platform of ‘F*** the police.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t imagine they’re happy about this,’ Aria DiMezzo told Inside Sources when asked about the reaction from Republicans.</p>

<p>DiMezzo captured the GOP nomination for Cheshire County sheriff on Tuesday night after she ran unopposed in the party primary.</p>

<p>She won despite the fact that she received no support from the county or state GOP.</p>

<p>Aria DiMezzo, a transgender woman who describes herself as an anarchist and a high priestess of the Reformed Satanic Church, won the Republican nomination for sheriff of Cheshire County, New Hampshire, on Tuesday</p>

<p>DiMezzo won after running on a platform that backs decriminalizing drugs, sex work, and illegal immigration</p>

<p>Her campaign slogan was 'F*** the police'. The local Republican Party said that her positions are not in line with the official platform</p>

<p>DiMezzo will have an even more formidable task as she will face off against a four-term incumbent, the Democrat Eli Rivera.</p>

<p>The head of the Cheshire County Republican Party, Marylin Huston, misgendered DiMezzo by referring to her as ‘he’ when she offered congratulations.</p>

<p>‘He did very well with the primary and that was wonderful,’ Huston said.</p>

<p>DiMezzo is a member of a group of Libertarian activists known as the Free Keene group.</p>

<p>During the recent GOP primary for governor, the group backed Rich Paul, who legally changed his name to Nobody.</p>

<p>Nobody lost the primary on Tuesday to the Republican incumbent, Governor Chris Sununu.</p>

<p>Last year, Nobody lost his bid to become mayor of Keene.</p>

<p>DiMezzo is the host of an internet radio show in which she is known as ‘She-Male.’</p>

<p>Initially, Free Keene began as an offshoot of the Free State Project of Libertarians, but the Free State Project has since distanced itself from Free Keene.</p>

<p>According to Huston, DiMezzo ran as a Republican because she was unable to get onto the Libertarian Party’s ballot.</p>

<p>She signed up to run as a Republican two days before the deadline after it was learned that Earl Nelson, a longtime GOP candidate, was not running.</p>

<p>Sheriff Eli Rivera, a four-term incumbent and Democrat, is heavily favored to win re-election</p>

<p>DiMezzo said she regretted that the party has not supported her candidacy.</p>

<p>‘They’re clearly not on my side,’ DiMezzo said.</p>

<p>In the town of Rindge, Nelson received more than 200 write-in votes on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Local Republicans on social media expressed their concerns about DiMezzo’s gender, religious beliefs, and political positions.</p>

<p>‘People of Rindge did a phenomenal job. Very well done,’ DiMezzo said.</p>

<p>Huston denies there was a coordinated effort to keep DiMezzo from winning the nomination.</p>

<p>‘I guess that’s just part of the whole political scene,’ Huston said.</p>

<p>Huston denies that the GOP is shunning DiMezzo, though she did voice concerns over her political positions.</p>

<p>‘If you look at their social media and their political statements they really do not fall in line with the Republican message,’ Huston said.</p>

<p>DiMezzo favors ending prosecution of drug crimes, sex work, illegal immigration, and other ‘victimless’ crimes.</p>

<p>DiMezzo posted an image of a ballot which showed that she ran unopposed in Tuesday's GOP primary</p>

<p>She said she is more liberal in many ways when compared to her Democratic opponent, Rivera.</p>

<p>‘I’m more liberal than he is,’ DiMezzo said.</p>

<p>‘There’s tons of things people get fined for, arrested for, that don’t actually have any victims.’</p>

<p>DiMezzo also identifies as a ‘high priestess’ of the Reformed Satanic Church, which describes itself as ‘an organization dedicated to the sovereignty of the individual, and to the principle of non-aggression.’</p>

<p>Unlike the Church of Satan, the Reformed Satanic Church doesn’t define itself as a religion.</p>

<p>‘We are an anti-religion,’ the organization’s website claims.</p>

<p>‘Religion is authoritarian; we reject all proclaimed authority as arbitrary and, at best, backed by threats of force and violence.</p>

<p>‘Whether one chooses to abide the edicts of this authority are one’s own decision, but that choice is critically a given person’s to make; usurpation of that sacred choice creates obedience inspired by fear, not respect.’</p>

<p>The church adds: ‘Lucifer is not our god nor our king. Lucifer is our example.</p>

<p>‘As he refused to obey the arbitrary edicts of an authority, so shall we.</p>

<p>‘Morality is determined by conscience, not by hierarchical ranking of a decree.’  </p>
