<p>'But when we rebooked it for the following year, a few of our friends and family said we could have a baby between now and then.</p>

<p>The 2002 Big Brother winner also said she had felt 'pressurised' in the past but is happy that she waited for the right time.</p>

<p>Kate added: 'I think I am going to be a much happier person knowing that I did this when I wanted to.'  </p>
