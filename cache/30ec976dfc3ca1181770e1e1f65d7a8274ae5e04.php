<p>As the protesters begin to swarm around the truck, trying to open the driver's side door, the truck speeds off, appearing to drive over the injured protester and narrowly missing a street medic who rushed to attend to her. </p>

<p>An LAPD helicopter that was tracking the protest was able to follow the truck as it sped off, directing ground units which pulled over the driver.</p>

<p>The truck driver was seen being taken into police custody, but his name has not been released and charging information was not immediately available.</p>

<p>A second incident at the Hollywood protest was also caught on camera by the KTLA news chopper, in which a white Prius became stuck in the crowd and sped off.</p>

<p>A truck that was escorting the protesters chased down the Prius and cut it off, and protesters stormed the car and attempted to take the keys.</p>
