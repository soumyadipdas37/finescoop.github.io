<p>The jump in infections come as leaked top secret documents revealed Melbourne's strict lockdown and curfew could be set for another two weeks. </p>

<p>According to the road map, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage Four comes to an end.</p>

<p>Single people and single parents would also be given the right to have a nominated visitor at their home. </p>
