<p>High street pharmacies Boots and Lloyds have decided to suspend bookings for those aged 65 and over at branches across the UK. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, waiting lists at some GP surgeries are at high levels, leading to a potential several week wait for the jab for the elderly. </p>

<p>Public Health England is aiming to immunise 30 million Britons this winter, the largest flu vaccination programmer ever undertaken in the UK. </p>

<p>It comes after a PHE report revealed that coronavirus patients were almost twice as likely to die if they caught the flu at the same    </p>

<p>The vaccination programme is open to all over 50s, for the first time, in an attempt to immunise as much of the population as possible.    </p>

<p>Officials have previously insisted that pensioners remained a priority - despite the sheer scale of the project meaning that it would have to be rolled out in stages.  </p>

<p>Graham Slesser, a 65-year-old accountant from Doncaster, tried to book a flu jab from his local GP yesterday, having been turned away by his high street pharmacy.</p>

<p>He said: 'I was told there were 200 people ahead of me and I might not get an appointment until the end of October.' </p>
