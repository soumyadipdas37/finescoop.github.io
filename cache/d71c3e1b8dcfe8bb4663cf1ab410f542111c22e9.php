<p>Legs for days: Sweeping her hair into a ponytail, she made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask and even chose one that matched her dress</p>

<p>In early April after the coronavirus lockdowns began she shared an Instagram video of Marco and their boys in the backyard and reflected on bringing up sons.</p>

<p>'It’s fun as hell, at all times- every waking minute of your day is spent trying to talk someone from beating someone else, or burning the house down, or flashing a neighbor, or smelling someone else’s butt,' she quipped.</p>

<p>'I swear I’m not feeling sorry for my husband and I, it’s just that being stuck at home with these cubs makes me appreciate work!' Zoe said gamely.</p>

<p>About a year ago Zoe and Marco co-starred in the music video for Alicia Keys and Miguel's number Show Me The Love.</p>

<p>'My sister’s album is out now! I’ll be blasting it all weekend until I memorize every note, every word and every message,' wrote Zoe.</p>
