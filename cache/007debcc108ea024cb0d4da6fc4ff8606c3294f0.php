<p>She wore her lightened brunette tresses pulled back with voluminous strands resting over one shoulder. </p>

<p>The reality star wore multiple jeweled earrings and sported cat-eye makeup.</p>

<p>She accessorized with a black alligator print handbag with a silver clasp. </p>

<p>Standing out: Kylie wore a paper-thin pale yellow jacket with wide notched lapels and a black blouse on underneath. She accessorized with a black alligator print handbag</p>

<p>Home turf: It wasn't clear what the faux billionaire was dressed up for, but she was back in the US following a quick business trip to Paris</p>

<p>Kylie leaned back to show off a bit of her outfit in the short clip, before leaning forward to highlight her impeccably made-up face.</p>

<p>It wasn't clear what the faux billionaire was dressed up for, but she was back in the US following a quick business trip to Paris.</p>

<p>She was spotted throughout the City of Lights, and also shared multiple snapshots from the photo to her Instagram.</p>

<p>Kylie took business meetings with executives from Coty Cosmetics, the company which bought a majority stake in Kylie Cosmetics, making her a near-billionaire. </p>

<p>Paris vacation: She was spotted throughout the City of Lights, where she traveled for in-person business meetings with executive of Coty Cosmetics, which bought a majority stake in Kylie Cosmetics</p>

<p>Pandemic outrage: The trip sparked outrage from social media users, as she ignored California guidelines not to travel, and she seemed to have ignored EU travel bans on Americans</p>

<p>However, the trip sparked outrage from some social media users over her trip for non-essential reasons in the midst of a pandemic. </p>

<p>'You don't have to deal with COVID if ur rich,' sniped one fan in the comments of a post.</p>

<p>'Is the pandemic over for rich people? I just see them taking luxurious vacations to tropical places or Europe like how is Kylie Jenner in Paris rn I don't understand,' wrote another.</p>

<p>Another remarked, 'Kylie Jenner going to Paris during Covid while the rest of the world can't travel or visit family in other countries/states due to border restrictions just doesn't sit well with me.' </p>

<p>Kylie seemed to have ignored guidelines issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom restricting travel.</p>

<p>The state government's official website website currently urges people to only travel for 'urgent matters.'</p>

<p>There have been nearly 13,000 deaths from the pandemic in the state of California, with over 700,000 cases. </p>

<p>In all of the US, 183,000 people have succumbed to COVID-19, while a stunning six million have tested positive for the illness</p>

<p>Puzzling: It's not clear how Kylie got an exemption to enter the EU, and she documented herself ignoring the 14-day quarantine period for entering France</p>

<p>Hanging out: Kylie shared some photos of herself hanging out with the Jenner family friend Fai Khadra</p>

<p>Other critics wondered how Kylie had even been admitted to Paris in the first place.</p>

<p>The European Union has instituted travel restrictions that ban people from the United States from entering any EU countries due to the US' failure to control its coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>Though the EU lists multiple exemptions to the travel restrictions, Kylie doesn't appear to qualify for any of them. </p>

<p>The official website of the US Embassy &amp; Consulates in France currently states all arrivals in France from the US 'must provide the results of a virologic screening test (such as a PCR test) taken less than 72 hours before departure indicating a negative result for Covid-19.'</p>

<p>The website also states: 'Travelers arriving in France must self-isolate for 14 days if they have no symptoms. Anyone displaying symptoms could be subject to quarantine for up to 30 days.'</p>

<p>However, Kylie documented herself enjoying the town and not quarantining.  </p>
