<p>Williams has been hard at work, preparing to face fellow American Kristie Ahn in the first round of the French Open women's singles on Sunday. Meanwhile her sister Venus will be facing off against Anna Karolina Schmiedlová.</p>

<p>Serena recently shared one of the tricks she uses to help get her body ready to play and it is quite chilling.</p>

<p>The star was pictured grimacing while stepping into a frigid ice bath at the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy.</p>

<p>The Academy captioned the shot: 'If you’re not making this face when entering an ice bath, are you even doing ice bath?' </p>

<p>Big weekend! Not only will Williams play in the French Open this weekend, she will also celebrate her 38th birthday</p>

<p>Like the Olympic gold medalist that she is, Serena managed to ignore the pain from the icy waters and flash a megawatt smile to the camera. </p>

<p>The French Open is following strict health and safety protocols due to the COVID-19 pandemic after its original date was delayed for the same reason.</p>

<p>Unlike the recent US Open, the French Open isn't using the typical American 'bubble' model and will allow fans to sit socially distanced in the stands.</p>

<p>'Up to four people in a single party will be able to sit adjacent to one another. Seats on the outside courts will be open, but there will have to be at least one empty seat between spectators,' ESPN reported about safety protocols (Pictured at the US Open)</p>

<p>Adding: 'Everyone older than 11 will have to wear a mask or face covering at all times, and there will be hand sanitizer dispensers installed all around the stadium.'</p>

<p>Also, unlike at the US Open when Serena and other elite players stayed in private residences, players can only stay in one of two designated hotels in Paris, according to Yahoo. </p>

<p>During the US Open, Serena was cheered on in the stands by her husband, Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, their daughter. </p>
