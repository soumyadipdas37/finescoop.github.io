<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 60-year-old former chief-executive has been overwhelmed with job offers after he  posted a video of himself doing press-ups to prove he is not past it.</p>

<p>Paul Marks believes he had missed out on more than fifty jobs before the video of him doing six press-ups in his suit made him a viral success.</p>

<p>The former Toys R Us worker from Poulton-le-Fylde in Lancashire had more than 40 years of experience before being furloughed during the coronavirus lockdown in April.</p>

<p>His CV included roles such as chief operating officer, managing partner and operations director, working in India, Dubai and Spain, but he said he was unable to find a job in the UK due to his age.</p>

<p>Now more than 100 employers have got in touch with him about a job after the video reached more than 700,000 views on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Paul Marks, 60, believes he had missed out on more than fifty jobs due to his age so decided to post a video of himself doing press-ups to attract employer's attention</p>

<p>Paul performs six press-ups in his suit before getting up and addressing the camera. He says more than 100 employers have got in touch with him about a job after the video reached more than 700,000 views on LinkedIn</p>

<p>In the video, Paul performs six press-ups in his suit before getting up and addressing the camera.</p>

<p>He says he runs he does 40 or 50 press-ups a day and runs 30km after introducing himself.</p>

<p>Paul says: 'Oh by the way, those 40 press-ups and 30km stuff, it's not my way of showing how fit I may or may not be.</p>

<p>'It's my way of saying not all 60-year-olds are grey-haired gardeners or sit around drinking tea or watching sport all day. Not that I'm averse to either.'</p>

<p>Paul says he is returning to the UK after living and working abroad and is finding it impossible to speak to recruiters face-to-face.</p>

<p>He adds: 'The fact is that the complexity and, to a degree, the necessity of in the way in which online recruitment works these days means that its difficult for people like me to get past what feels a little bit like selection by algorithm.</p>

<p>'I need to meet people. So this is my call to action. My way of introducing myself to recruiters who might be put off by my age.'</p>

<p>He encouragers employers to think about the value his years of experience could provide a company and asks them to connect with him on LinkedIn or 'better still' phone him.</p>

<p>The video was inspired by Paul's challenging himself to be able to complete 60 press-ups and run 6km by his 60th birthday yesterday.</p>

<p>Paul, who was born in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland, said: 'I thought, "what if I combine the press-ups with a call to action".</p>

<p>'I didn't think I should do it in my gym gear because it doesn't look very professional, so I thought maybe I'd wear my suit, take my jacket off, then that would be underneath.</p>

<p>'But my wife said "who do you think you are, superman?", so then I wondered if I could do the press-ups in my suit. It was a bit tight after I put on some covid weight, but I managed it.</p>

<p>'Because I'd been doing the press-ups as part of the challenge, I was confident about physically doing them but I was nervous because I thought people might think I was a bit of a twit.</p>

<p>Paul says he runs he does 40 or 50 press-ups a day and runs 30km. The video was inspired by Paul's challenging himself to be able to complete 60 press-ups and run 6km by his 60th birthday yesterday</p>

<p>'The message was "I'm not an old wrinkly" and "I'm not dead yet", because when it comes to recruiting you might as well be dead.'</p>

<p>Paul and his wife lost their jobs in April and they caught the first post-lockdown plane home from Dubai in July.</p>

<p>He lives with a friend while wife Sara Marks, 47, lives with her parents in Bagby, North Yorkshire, before they can move back into their home in Darlington.</p>

<p>The father of two said he is not 'one of these Dubai success stories' and has ‘nothing but his house’, so he is looking for a job at any rung of the retail management ladder.</p>
