<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Boris Johnson took part in training on sexual harassment and bullying last week, No 10 has confirmed.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister listened to the two-hour online course along with other MPs and peers on Thursday.</p>

<p>One participant told Sky News: 'I was quite surprised to see the Prime Minister taking part, given everything he has to deal with at the moment: Covid, exams and so on. </p>

<p>'He sat very still throughout the whole thing, barely moving, but at the end he said "most informative".'</p>

<p>Boris Johnson took part in a two-hour online training course on sexual harassment and bullying with other MPs and peers last week</p>

<p>Mr Johnson took part in the session after accusations that two of his closest allies, Home Secretary Priti Patel and controversial Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings, had bullied civil servants.</p>

<p>The course, called Valuing Everyone, was made compulsory for MPs and peers last year in the wake of abuse allegations and the so-called 'Pestminster' scandal. </p>

<p>Among the senior politicians taking part in the video conference were Attorney General Suella Braverman and Steve Barclay, Chief Secretary to the Treasury.</p>

<p>It began with a film about a male employer who began behaving inappropriately towards a young female employee, with his behaviour getting gradually worse until he eventually sacked her.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson had already arranged to take part after a Freedom of Information request revealed he was one of 159 MPs who had not done the training since it was created in May 2019. </p>

<p>They included 140 Tories, seven Labour, five Democratic Unionist, four Scottish National Party, two SDLP and one independent MP.</p>

<p>The training aims to ensure everyone is 'able to recognise bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct – and feels confident taking action to tackle and prevent it', according to Commons authorities.</p>

<p>It was launched after an independent probe by Dame Laura Cox found that bullying and harassment had been allowed to thrive in Parliament under a top-down culture of 'deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence'.</p>

<p>Westminster was rocked by a wave of sexual harassment allegations in autumn 2017, triggering the resignations of defence secretary Michael Fallon and Damian Green, who was Theresa May's de facto deputy at the time.</p>

<p>Former Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, who was suspended from the party, has since been found guilty of sexual assault.</p>

<p>Last month Mr Johnson defended his decision not to suspend a Tory MP arrested on suspicion of rape. </p>

<p>He faced calls from Labour politicians to withdraw the whip from the ex-minister, who has since been released on bail.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said: 'I think it's very, very important that we take all these cases extremely seriously and we will continue to do so. </p>

<p>'I think we've got to wait for the police to decide whether they want to make charges and take a decision on that basis.'</p>
