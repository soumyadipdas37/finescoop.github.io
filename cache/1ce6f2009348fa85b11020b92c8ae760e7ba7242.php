<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Metropolitan Transit Authority has announced a $50 fine for any rider who refuses to wear a face covering on public transit in New York City in a bid to slow transmission of coronavirus.</p>

<p>The fines will go into effect on Monday, and come in response to an order from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo to bolster mask compliance on public transit.</p>

<p>'While mask compliance in the MTA system remains very high, we want to make sure that people feel comfortable coming back to public transportation,' Cuomo said in a statement on Thursday. </p>

<p>'We have to be able to say to the riding public that everyone will be wearing masks - and if they refuse to wear a mask they will be penalized,' he added.</p>

<p>The fines will go into effect on Monday, and come in response to an order from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo (above) to bolster mask compliance on public transit</p>

<p>The MTA says that surveys show more than 90 percent of customers are already using masks on subways, buses, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North. </p>

<p>Free masks have been available at subway stations for some time for riders who don't have their own, yet some scofflaws continue to ride transit without the face coverings.</p>

<p>Masks have been mandatory on New York transit since April, but the $50 fine is the latest measure to drive mask compliance even higher. </p>

<p>Mask compliance will be enforced by MTAPD, NYPD and Bridge and Tunnel Officers. MTA frontline employees are not responsible for enforcement, the agency said.</p>

<p>'We know the vast majority of New Yorkers are already doing the right thing and wearing a mask while riding with us,' said Sarah Feinberg, Interim President of New York City Transit. </p>

<p>'The fine is a last resort measure for those who refuse to comply. It's critical that every customer does their part to keep our system safe.'</p>

<p>Last month, the MTA announced a 'doomsday plan' that would see subway service slashed by 40 percent if the agency does not get a $12 billion federal bailout. </p>

<p>'Horrendous choices lie ahead,' Metropolitan Transit Authority Chairman Pat Foye said in an emergency board meeting. </p>

<p>The agency needs $12 billion in funding before the end of 2021 to avoid drastic measures, like raising metro fares to $3.75 and reducing service on commuter rail lines. </p>

<p>Fewer trains on the rails or subway means longer waits and more crowded cars while the pandemic continues.</p>

<p>For the subway, wait times would increase by eight minutes; for the bus it would be 15 minutes. Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North trains would run at every hour or two. </p>

<p>Foye added: 'The future of the MTA and the future of the New York region lies squarely in the hands of the federal government.' </p>
