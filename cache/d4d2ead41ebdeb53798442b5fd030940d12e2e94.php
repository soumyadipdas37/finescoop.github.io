<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Congressman Anthony Weiner has been spotted out with his ex-wife Huma Abedin as he continues to piece his life back together following his release from prison. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, the disgraced Democrat - who spent 18 months behind bars for sexting a minor - joined his former spouse to drop off their eight-year-old son at school in New York City.  </p>

<p>Weiner, 56, and Abedin, 44, separated back in 2016 following the bombshell criminal claims, which were unearthed by DailyMail.com. </p>

<p>And while the pair now appear committed to co-parenting their son, it seems a romantic reunion is off the cards, with the former couple keeping distance from one another on the school grounds.   </p>

<p>Abedin - who served as a longtime Hillary Clinton aide - walked in front of her former husband and shielded her eyes behind dark sunglasses. </p>

<p>The Clinton confidante appeared in no mood for small talk as she kept her head down and a mask over her mouth. </p>

<p>Former Congressman Anthony Weiner was spotted out with his ex-wife Huma Abedin in New York City on Tuesday as he continues to piece his life back together following his release from prison</p>

<p>Social distancing! It seems a romantic reunion is off the cards, with the former couple keeping distance from one another after the school drop-off </p>

<p>The 56-year-old Democrat, who spent 18 months in a New York prison for sexting a 15-year-old girl, was recently unveiled as the CEO of Brooklyn-based IceStone</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Weiner seemed somewhat downcast as he trailed tentatively behind his ex-spouse. </p>

<p>His outing came less than 24 hours after a report that he is now working as the CEO of Brooklyn-based glass countertop manufacturer, IceStone.  </p>

<p>And the former felon looked ready to hit the office, dressed suitably in beige chino pants and a sensible gray sweater. </p>

<p>Although Weiner has been working with IceStone since May, he only recently announced his new line of work in a promotional email showcasing IceStone's products. </p>

<p> 'One of the amazing things about IceStone countertops, is that since people throw away all kinds of glass, there is almost an unlimited array of different colors we can use in our recycled glass creations,' he wrote, according to a Monday article in The New York Post. </p>

<p>'So that when I joined the company as CEO I asked what I thought was an obvious question — Can we make a countertop in the colors of my favorite New York teams?</p>

<p>'So while not everyone is a fan of the Islanders (fingers crossed), Mets (ugh) or Knicks (don't ask), if you are interested in a little color in your life, give IceStone a call,' he added.</p>

<p>Weiner seemed somewhat downcast as he trailed tentatively behind his ex-spouse.</p>

<p>As cold as Ice(Stone)!  Abedin - who served as a longtime Hillary Clinton aide - walked in front of her former husband and shielded her eyes behind dark sunglasses</p>

<p>The pair appeared to go their separate ways following the school drop-off. Weiner may have been headed to the IceStone office, where he works as CEO </p>

<p>According to its website, IceStone champions itself as an employer committed to giving 'second chances' beyond its factory and products.</p>

<p>The company says it hires the homeless, refugees and even helps to train the formerly incarcerated, while ensuring 'everyone gets paid a living wage and has access to subsidized health insurance and a voice in the company.' </p>

<p>Weiner and Abedin married back in 2010, in a star-studded ceremony, during which Hillary Clinton called the bride the closest thing she had to a second daughter. </p>

<p>But the couple's high-powered political union hit troubled waters the following year. </p>

<p>Weiner stepped down from his seat in New York's 9th congressional district in 2011, after he accidentally tweeted a crotch-shot of himself in his underwear to the public, on his official page.</p>

<p>Abedin - who is one of Hillary Clinton's closest confidantes - was pictured following the school drop-off </p>

<p>The move was also made official on his LinkedIn page, having been officially appointed to the role in May</p>

<p>He attempted to revive his political career two years later in a 2013 run for New York mayor. He surged to first place in the polls before his campaign suffered a spectacular blow when a second sexting scandal surfaced.</p>

<p>Weiner, still married to Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin at the time, was found to be exchanging lewd messages online under the alias 'Carlos Danger'.</p>

<p>But the successive scandals were eclipsed four years later in 2017, when Weiner admitted to sexting with a 15-year-old girl, following a DailyMail.com investigation.</p>

<p>For months, Weiner and the minor exchanged sexually graphic text messages, spoke over several social media platforms and he sent her photographs of himself in various states of undress, sometimes posing with his son.</p>

<p>After DailyMail.com exposed Weiner, he admitted to knowing that the victim, from North Carolina, was underage at the time of their exchanges.</p>

<p>Weiner was arrested by FBI agents in May that year. He admitted one count of transmission of obscene material later that month, weeping in court as he entered his guilty plea.</p>

<p>'I have a sickness but I do not have an excuse,' he said, after the judge told him that he would have to register as a sex offender.</p>

<p>He was then sentenced to 21 months in prison that September, but was let out three months early on good behavior. </p>

<p>In 2017, Weiner admitted to sexting with a 15-year-old girl, following a DailyMail.com investigation (pictured above with then-wife, Huma Abedin)</p>

<p>For months, they exchanged sexually graphic text messages, spoke over several social media platforms and he sent her photographs of himself in various states of undress, sometimes posing with his son</p>

<p>IceStone owner Del LaManga told the Post he has known Weiner for a long time, having met him a number of years ago after an launching his own unsuccessful Congressional bid. He said he also visited Weiner a number of times while he was in prison.</p>

<p>'I knew him from the political world. He talked me out of running for mayor, which was good, and we developed a relationship,' he said.</p>

<p>'And then he got sucked into that whole thing. I wanted to help him any way I could. He served his time and coming out is tough. And so I said, 'Can you work for Ice Stone?' because he knows everybody in the city and the company is in Brooklyn.'</p>

<p>The 74-year-old said the company has 'never been successful' and he hired Weiner around five months ago in an effort to turn its fortunes around.</p>

<p>According to its website, IceStone champions itself as an employer committed to giving 'second chances' beyond its factory and products (a promotional shot of a product is seen above)</p>

<p>LaManga, who made his fortune as the founder of the Tweezerman brand of beauty tools, was originally an investor in the company but later took control and when the owner ran into financial difficulties.</p>

<p>Earlier this year he decided to 'replace himself'. Citing Weiner's experience from Congress, he said there was no better man for the job.</p>

<p>And LaManga's faith has reportedly been repaid, as he says 'Anthony is a better CEO than I was.'</p>

<p>'He's just methodically going through and reinventing every aspect. The first thing he did was rebuild the website so it works better…He took over supervising the factory, so he shows up there and he's a fanatically organized person, and he's cleaned all that up.'</p>

<p>LaManga declined to disclose to the post what salary Weiner is on. He did however voice confidence that he's 'completely moved on' from his troubled past.</p>

<p>'He's doing extremely well … He's very bright. I like him, my wife likes him.'</p>
