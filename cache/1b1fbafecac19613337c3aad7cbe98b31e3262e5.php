<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It is well-known that cats and dogs often do not get along when they live together. </p>

<p>But this American Shorthair cat has bucked the trend by infiltrating a gang of three Shiba Inus and becoming a member of the canine pack. </p>

<p>The owners of the animals live in Chiba, eastern Japan, and told Bored Panda that they got the cat, named Kiki, when the dogs were already part of the family.</p>

<p>The unnamed woman said she and her partner had Shibas for years but he refused when she said she wanted a cat as well. </p>

<p>Eventually, she found a cat, Kiki, which they both liked and now the feline has even started to act like her pet dogs, who are named Saki, Ibuki, Hazuki and Kiki.</p>

<p>She said: 'I often hear that it's the dogs who get used to their owner's sleeping schedule, and cats are the jerks who get up early and wake you up at 4 AM or something like that, but Kiki also sleeps together with the rest of us until morning.'</p>

<p>The pets' adventures are also documented on the couple's Instagram page. </p>

<p>An American Shorthair cat named Kiki has become best friends with a trio of Shiba Inus, named Hazuki (left), Ibuki (centre), Saki, at their home in Chiba, eastern Japan</p>

<p>The cat has gained over 100k followers on Instagram as her owners share snaps of her adventures with her puppy friends </p>

<p>In another group shot of the pets, Kiki poses at the front while Hazuki lurks behind, followed by Ibuki and then Saki  </p>

<p>The animals appear to be experts in performing matching poses, as this picture amazingly demonstrates</p>

<p>In this snap, Kiki seems to have one eye closed while his canine companions look on majestically</p>

<p>Kiki seems to enjoy leading the group when they pose for pictures, and in this one stares right at the camera while the dogs sit side on</p>

<p>In another snap, all four of them including Kiki are seen waiting patiently in front of their dinner bowl</p>

<p>The animals' owner said Kiki fitted in as soon as she and her partner brought her home - even though the dogs were there first</p>

<p>Out in nature: In this snap, the animals are seen enjoying some time outside in the garden and Kiki seems to be wearing a very fancy collar</p>

<p>The friends also seem to enjoy playing together, as this picture demonstrates. Kiki is seen with his paw resting on Saki's ear</p>

<p>In this picture, the dogs sat with their paws folded underneath them - and Kuki had no trouble in copying</p>

<p>Kiki and the dogs were also seen wearing matching outfits which featured their names emblazoned on the front</p>

<p>Paws together: The animals seem to have no trouble getting up close and personal </p>

<p>Best friends: Kiki is seen giving a very focused stare in this photo, as the dogs take a more relaxed look</p>

<p>Kiki repeats the fierce stare here and this time offers up her back as a head rest for Hazuki and Saki</p>
