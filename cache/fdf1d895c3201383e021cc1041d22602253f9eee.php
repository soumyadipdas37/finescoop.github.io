<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain's Covid-19 swab-testing system has been crumbling this week as cases are surging and hundreds of people say they can't get tests even though they are ill.</p>

<p>Faced with a dead-end online booking system or directions to tests hundreds of miles from home, many are losing faith in NHS Test &amp; Trace altogether.</p>

<p>But there are other ways to get tested. Websites run by private clinics are offering in-clinic and DIY home tests for people wanting to speed up the process.</p>

<p>They come with a hefty price tag, however, with the most costly coming in at an eye-watering £350 for a swab done by a medical professional.</p>

<p>Although they're likely to be very similar kits, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged members of the public not to take private tests.</p>

<p>He said in Parliament yesterday: 'We don’t recommend any private tests that are not signed off and verified and therefore we’re providing tests, as many tests as we possibly can with a growing capacity.'</p>

<p>A move away from the national testing programme could allow new cases to go under the radar and get missed from official data, while there is a risk of profiteers selling tests that give inaccurate results.</p>

<p>Some of the UK's top paid-for healthcare providers, BUPA, HCA and Babylon among them, are not offering swab tests to people unless they're going into hospital, with Babylon instead directing people to the NHS programme.</p>

<p>Below are some of the tests available online. All are nose-and-throat swabs the same as the ones used at drive-in test centres:</p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged people in the UK not to turn to private testing and to use the national – free – system being run by the Department of Health, but many people are facing long waits, long drives or are unable to get tested at all (Pictured: A queue of people outside an official testing centre in Manchester yesterday) </p>

<p>London Doctors Clinic – £189</p>

<p>London Doctors Clinic will send people a DIY swab test which is used to diagnose Covid-19 for £189 each, including postage.</p>

<p>The company says it is using the same nose-and-throat swab tests used by the NHS Test &amp; Trace programme, and that they are 'approved by Public Health England'. </p>

<p>Official testing centres have used more than one type of test since setting up, with the biggest players those made by the companies Randox and ThermoFisher.</p>

<p>The company claims its test is 98 per cent sensitive – meaning it correctly identifies 98 out of 100 people who have coronavirus – and 100 per cent specific, meaning it does not wrongly diagnose people who don't have the virus. </p>

<p>It says the results are available within three days of the test being posted back to the lab.</p>

<p>Assured Screening – £109</p>

<p>Assured Screening says its tests can detect more than 95 per cent of positive results</p>

<p>Assured Screening, a pharmaceutical lab based in County Durham, offers home testing or tests at a centre in the North East of England.</p>

<p>The test centre is located, aptly, in Barnard Castle – the Durham town where Government advisor Dominic Cummings was seen breaking self-isolation rules by going for a drive to 'test his eyesight'.</p>

<p>For people who live out of range of the lab, home tests can be done in a process that usually takes three days, the company says.</p>

<p>Its tests are more than 95 per cent sensitive and 100 per cent specific, Assured Screening says, and it uses machines developed by big-name testing companies Qiagen, Roche and Thermo Scientific.</p>

<p>Assured Screening, a company offering private coronavirus tests, is based in Barnard Castle, the County Durham town where Government advisor Dominic Cummings was famously caught breaking self-isolation rules</p>

<p>Private Harley Street Clinic – £250-£350</p>

<p>A website called Private Harley Street Clinic offers tests for up to £350.  </p>

<p>Customers can order home test swab kits for £250, which are posted out, or have a home visit from a medical professional for £350. </p>

<p>The company, which has a clinic and laboratory on the famous medical street in west London, says it can provide people with test results the next working day, between 20 and 48 hours.</p>

<p>It says the tests are 'the same used by Public Health England' but does not name the kit. The website says they are 70 per cent sensitive – meaning 30 out of 100 infected people will be wrongly told they do not have the virus.</p>

<p>The tests are 100 per cent specific, the site claims, showing that the false positive rate is 'negligible'.</p>

<p>DocTap – £129</p>

<p>Another London-based private clinic, DocTap, offers swab tests and 'fitness to travel certificates' for £129 but these can only be taken in person in the city.</p>

<p>DocTap says it can offer 'PHE approved' tests and get people their results within three days.</p>

<p>The swabs are done at one of seven testing sites around London or they can be sent by post – mail order kits may take up to a week to complete, from order to result.</p>

<p>The test is a DIY self-swab that people must use on their nose and throat themselves, or they can pay an extra £15 to have a medical professional do it for them.</p>

<p>DocTap's service appears centred around certifying people 'fit to fly' if they test negative for the virus, and offers certificates to prove someone's Covid-free status.</p>

<p>Some countries, such as Cyprus, now require these certificates to prove travellers do not have the virus before they are allowed into the country. </p>

<p>The company does not make clear the type of test it uses, nor how accurate it is. </p>

<p>Doctorcall – £160+</p>

<p>Doctorcall claims its test is 'highly reliable'</p>

<p>Doctorcall, also a clinic based on Harley Street, offers swab tests for coronavirus for upwards of £160.</p>

<p>A home test, sent by post, costs £160 and is reportedly processed at 'the largest private accredited laboratory in the UK', with results returned within three days.</p>

<p>The company recommends people take the test within five days of starting to experience symptoms of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Doctorcall also offers in-clinic tests to people who do not have symptoms, and home visits from doctors. A doctor's visit is charged on top of the £157 test fee.</p>

<p>The website does not name the test it uses or say how accurate it is, other than to say it is 'highly reliable'.</p>

<p>CityDoc – £175</p>

<p>CityDoc offers Covid-19 swab tests to people either by mail order or at clinics in London.</p>

<p>Tests done in clinics return results the next day, CityDoc says, while postal kits will take approximately three days after it is posted back to the lab.</p>

<p>People can order up to 10 tests at a time for £175 each and they are certified for proving people safe for foreign travel.</p>

<p>CityDoc says its test is 99 per cent accurate. </p>

<p>London Global Practice – £315</p>

<p>London Global Practice, a private healthcare provider, offers same-day swab testing for £315 a go.</p>

<p>The tests can be ordered online and sent out by courier on the same day for people to do the swabs themselves at home. Each order includes a video consultation with a a member of staff who tells the customer how to do the test.</p>

<p>The company says test results can be confirmed on the 'same day' if the samples are received by 7am.</p>

<p>It does not reveal the accuracy of the test nor name the product. </p>

<p>Medinow – £125+</p>

<p>Medinow markets its test with the fact the clinic is regulated by the Care Quality Commission</p>

<p>Medinow, a private medical services company, allows members of the public to buy home testing kits for Covid-19 or a visit from a health professional to do the test.</p>

<p>The home test costs £125, while the price for the visit is not advertised.</p>

<p>Medinow says its tests are 99.9 per cent accurate and its results will be produced around two days after the sample is received by the laboratory by post.</p>

<p>The firm requests that customers contact staff directly to discuss have a test done by a medical visitor to their home or office. The price is not advertised.</p>

<p>Private Coronavirus Tests – £149</p>

<p>Private Coronavirus Tests's service claims to be 100 per cent accurate</p>

<p>Private Coronavirus Tests appears to be a website set up solely to sell swab tests.</p>

<p>The kits cost £149 each and claim to be 100 per cent accurate, although it is not clear what company they are produced by.</p>

<p>The company claims to be 'a laboratory set up by NHS registered GPs and consultants to provide easy access to pathology testing services'.</p>

<p>Results are returned within two to three days, the website says, and it offers discounts for NHS staff.</p>
