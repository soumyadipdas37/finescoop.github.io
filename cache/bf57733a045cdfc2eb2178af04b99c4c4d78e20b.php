<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa has defended his decision to hand Kiko Casilla the captain's armband following his ban for racial abuse.</p>

<p>The goalkeeper served an eight-match suspension last season after being found guilty of directing a racist remark towards Charlton forward Jonathan Leko, who later revealed the Spaniard has not apologised to him.</p>

<p>And some Leeds fans were unhappy when Bielsa named the 33-year-old as skipper for Wednesday's Carabao Cup tie at home to Hull, during which he scored in a penalty-shootout defeat.</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa has defended his decision to name Leeds goalkeeper Kiko Casilla captain for Wednesday night's League Cup tie against Hull</p>

<p>Bielsa insisted his players thought Casilla 'deserves to be the captain', despite his ban for racial abuse last season</p>

<p>Casilla was banned for eight matches after being found guilty of abusing Jonathan Leko</p>

<p>Bielsa said: 'His team-mates think he deserves to be the captain and we have to listen to those messages. The players see in their captain someone who they think can represent them.</p>

<p>'I respect the thoughts of any person. After that, opinions can be argued. Surely those who judge Kiko ignore a lot of things his team-mates see in him.</p>

<p>'Of course we also value the conduct of Kiko, which only we can judge because we are part of the group.</p>

<p>'When you are subject to what other people judge you for or think, it doesn't matter what we think, we have to accept the decision of the authorities.</p>

<p>'It is also important that you may not know what percentage of the fanbase actually didn't want Kiko as captain, because the opinion of the masses should always be heard.</p>

<p>'Surely the public won't have all the information that his team-mates will have.'</p>

<p>Fans vented their anger at the decision on social media, with one posting: 'Please, why is Kiko Casilla still at Leeds, how is being guilty of racism not violation of contract and a kick in the teeth to play him and captain him. </p>

<p>'What does the new patch on the sleeve say? Seems like there's plenty of room for racism.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'The one thing that has been mismanaged at Leeds over the past 6-12 months is Kiko Casilla, regardless of evidence, once found guilty he should have been let go and certainly never captain a Leeds United side ever.' </p>

<p>'Kiko Casilla should be nowhere near the pitch, let alone captain,' another added.</p>

<p>'I feel nothing but shame for the fact that he is here tonight,' while one more branded the decision 'disgusting'. </p>

<p>Leeds host Fulham on Saturday and Bielsa has confirmed that £27million club-record signing Rodrigo will not start, but skipper Liam Cooper is set to return from injury having missed last weekend's 4-3 defeat at Liverpool.</p>
