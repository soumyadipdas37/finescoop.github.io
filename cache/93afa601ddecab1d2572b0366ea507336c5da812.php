<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A trio of business professionals have revealed the three worst things that job seekers do that jeopardise their chances of getting the role. </p>

<p>Speaking to Australian recruitment company Seek, Saunders Lynn &amp; Co Founder Kerri O'Connor said it's important to never lie on your resume, while Principal Consultant Simon Bennett said candidates should never have an aggressive tone during a first interview.</p>

<p>Managing Director of Elite Executive Eva Grabner added it's also essential to provide great referees who know the individual is applying for other roles. </p>

<p>A trio of business professionals have revealed the three worst actions that can jeopardise job seekers from getting the position they desire</p>

<ol>
<li>Lying on your resume or during a job interview</li>
</ol>

<p>Ms O'Connor said it's important for people to never lie about qualifications, education and experiences on their resume or to a recruiter, and to ensure their CV matches online profiles - such as Seek or LinkedIn.</p>

<p>'I was screening a candidate over the phone for a field based sales executive role, and they boasted they were earning a $100K package (yet the role they were applying for was up to $25K less in salary),' she told Seek.</p>

<p>'In addition, his online profile only mentioned a TAFE qualification, when he spoke of completing several degrees. Then I checked the resumes he had sent two years apart to our business and there were discrepancies in his work experience.'</p>

<p>Recruiters often search for candidate online to find background information about the individual, and if the information doesn't match what they've been told this is a red flag.</p>

<p>Rather than providing false or inaccurate information, consider how current skills or past experiences will suit the job description provided.</p>

<li>Being aggressive or having a bad tone</li>
</ol>

<p>Mr Bennett shared another experience regarding interviewing a man who seemed to have an aggressive tone while discussing past employers.</p>

<p>'It sounded like his relationship with his former employer ended badly, so I asked him what they would say about him,' he said.</p>

<p>'Without going into specifics, he said he'd made it clear it would be in their best interest to give him a good reference.'</p>

<p>While a great resume and qualifications are impressive towards recruiters, having a bad attitude or aggression towards previous employers can sometimes jeopardise future roles.</p>

<li>Providing a bad referee</li>
</ol>

<p>Before providing the details of referees, speak to the individual first to ensure they are aware of any calls or emails they will receive.</p>

<p>This will allow the individual to prepare themselves and understand you are applying for new positions.</p>

<p>Ms Grabner said she called a candidate's current employee as they had put their name down as a reference, but the employer wasn't aware their worker was applying for roles and was irritated. </p>

<p>'Imagine my surprise when I called a very disgruntled ex-employer and was nearly hung up on! Needless to say, this particular candidate missed out on the opportunity to join a great organisation because they didn't take the time to speak with their referees and ask them if they were happy to speak with future employers on their behalf,' she said.  </p>
