<p>Natural: Joanna Chimonides, 23, has revealed she rejected a string of offers to have lip fillers and cosmetic surgery for free</p>

<p>'My lips are small and I’m insecure about them but I haven’t had filler put in. I use make-up and lots of lipliner.</p>

<p>'I want to show young girls that you don’t have to get cosmetic surgery.'</p>

<p>Joanna competed on last year's series of Love Island and found herself inundated with the offers after she left the villa.</p>

<p>Fellow Love Islander Maura Higgins previously revealed how she was also offered a variety of procedures after she took part in the show.</p>

<p>Looks: The former Love Island star admitted she is 'insecure' about the size of her lips but wants to show her young fans they don't need to undergo cosmetic procedures</p>

<p>While she has admitted to having had lip fillers in the past, the TV star now wants to embrace her looks. </p>

<p>She told The Sun: 'When you come out of Love Island you are offered everything from make-up and hair extensions to plastic surgery and operations. I just stick to what I know and love.</p>

<p>'I don’t want to get anything done to my body. I’ve got a flat bum and I’m just going to have to embrace it.</p>

<p>'I did go to a clinic to get Botox years ago but the doctor refused to do it and said I didn’t need it. I’m confident in my own skin.'</p>

<p>She said: 'My lips are small and I’m insecure about them but I haven’t had filler put in. I use make-up and lots of lip liner'</p>

<p>Joanna ruffled a few feathers on Love Island when she turned the head of Michael Griffiths during the famed Casa Amor week.</p>

<p>Michael was already coupled up with the eventual winner from that series Amber Gill when he started a relationship with Joanna.</p>

<p>The couple found themselves in the bottom two and were kicked off the show in week seven.</p>

<p>While they are no longer together, Joanna insisted she and Michael are now friends, adding that she thinks it's important not to carry 'negative weight' on your shoulders.</p>
