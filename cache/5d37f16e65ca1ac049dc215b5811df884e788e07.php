<p>CommSec senior economic Ryan said China's economic trade sanctions against Australia were beginning to show. </p>

<p>'Could the escalating political spat between Australia and China be starting to bite?,' he said.</p>

<p>'Not good news for our farmers hit by bushfires, drought and COVID-19 restrictions.'</p>

<p>Rory Treadwell, an economist with BIS Oxford Economics, said rural goods were set to suffer. </p>

<p>'Trade tensions with China continue to cloud the export outlook, particularly for some rural goods,' he said.</p>

<p>Australia's trade surplus plunged by 43 per cent in July to $4.6billion, from $8.1billion in June.</p>

<p>This marked the 31st successive monthly trade surplus despite China's trade retaliation, the Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed. </p>

<p>China's customs authority claims it found the banned drug chloramphenicol in beef from the family-owned business John Dee Warwick.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Australia's annual exports to China during the last financial year hit a new record high of $151billion - with the Communist nation buying 34 per cent of all Australian exports.</p>

<p>Like two-thirds of nations, Australia has China has its biggest trading partner.</p>

<p>The Australian Strategic Policy Institute said the Communist power used coercion to bully smaller nations politically, adding this style of wolf warrior diplomacy was set to worsen.</p>

<p>'China is the largest trading partner for nearly two-thirds of the world's countries, and its global economic importance gives it significant leverage,' it said in a report by Fergus Hanson, Emilia Currey and Tracy Beattie.</p>

<p>'The impacts of coercive diplomacy are exacerbated by the growing dependency of foreign governments and companies on the Chinese market.' </p>

<p>He runs a lucrative consultancy advising Chinese firms on how to do business in Australia.</p>

<p>'The relationship has never been better because of the free trade agreement,' he said.</p>

<p>'We, in the world, need a working relationship with China coming out the other end of the pandemic because we, including China, will struggle to restore the prosperity that all the world, that many parts of the world was experiencing.'</p>
