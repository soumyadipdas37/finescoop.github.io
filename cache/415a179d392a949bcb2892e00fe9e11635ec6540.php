<p>Mr Orda joined the livestock company as a veterinary officer in June and is one of two Australians on board the ship which went missing after leaving Port of Portland in Victoria three months ago.  </p>

<p>The ship left New Zealand on August 14 and was due to arrive in Tangshan, China on Friday but the captain sent a distress call to the Japanese Coast Guard at about 1.20am on Wednesday. </p>

<p>Chief executive of the Australian Livestock Exporters’ Council (ALEC),  Mark Harvey-Sutton, told ABC Radio they are waiting 'anxiously' for news. </p>

<p>He said the second Australian on the cargo ship is believed to be a stock handler.  </p>

<p>'It is a very close-knit community the live stock industry both here and in New Zealand, so everyone is very concerned about the situation and we’re just hoping for the best,' said Mr Harvey-Sutton. </p>

<p>A Filipino crew member (pictured) who was rescued after a distress signal was sent by the Australian owned Gulf Livestock 1 said the ship capsized and sunk in rough weather caused by Typhoon Maysak</p>

<p>Rescue teams are continuing their search for the ship and the remaining 42 crew members which include 38 from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia</p>

<p>The vessel had almost 6,000 cattle on board when it disappeared west of Amami Oshima in south-western Japan.  </p>

<p>Japan's coast guard dispatched planes and rescue boats to hunt for the ship and late Wednesday found a sole survivor, Sareno Edvarodo, the ship's 45-year-old Filipino chief officer.</p>

<p>Dramatic photos released by the coast guard showed Edvarodo floating in the darkness in an orange life jacket and being pulled onto a boat with a rope as rescuers battled violent, rolling waves.</p>

<p>He was quickly brought to a large vessel, where coast guard personnel with surgical masks and gloves wrapped him with blankets.</p>

<p>'Water,' he said, identifying himself as a Filipino in the video. 'Thank you, thank you very much.'</p>

<p>According to Edvarodo, the vessel lost an engine before it was hit by a wave and capsized, a coastguard spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>The crew were instructed to put on life jackets and Edvarodo said he jumped into the water and didn't see any other crew member before he was rescued.</p>

<p>Rescue teams are continuing their search for the ship and the remaining 42 crew members which include 38 from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia. </p>

<p>Based on the last known location of the ship it would have been sailing in high winds of 58 knots (107km/h). </p>
