<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>You can spend a king’s ransom on your attack but if your goalkeeper can’t even catch a cold, then what’s the point?</p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga cost Chelsea £71.6million in 2018 but has never proven worthy of being the world’s most expensive goalkeeper. In committing another clanger he further established himself as Chelsea’s worst value signing in the Premier League era.</p>

<p>Maybe their worst since I cost them £10m! I moved to Stamford Bridge for big money in 1999. It didn’t work out and a year later I was sold to Celtic for £6m.</p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga cost Chelsea £71.6million but has failed to live up to his hefty price tag</p>

<p>The Spanish goalkeeper was at fault once again as his mistake allowed Sadio Mane to score</p>

<p>It happens. Sometimes it’s best to move on. You could also name Fernando Torres at £50m (though a few Chelsea fans might say that historic semi-final goal against Barcelona was worth the fee alone). Andriy Shevchenko at £30m, too. But Kepa surely beats all of us. Sadio Mane’s goals on Sunday meant he had conceded 11 of the last 16 shots he’s faced.</p>

<p>In football, you always get a chance to redeem yourself. I got that at Celtic, and Kepa might have to go prove himself elsewhere, too. Edouard Mendy cannot arrive from Rennes soon enough for Frank Lampard, who is under big pressure to win a trophy this season. </p>

<p>Arrizabalaga is possibly Chelsea's worst signing since I joined the club for £10m in 1999</p>

<p>In football, you always get the chance to redeem yourself, and Kepa can do that elsewhere</p>

<p>Chelsea aren’t the type of club who say: ‘No problem — have another go next season!’ Lampard knows as well as anyone that silverware is a must. Though Kepa gave him a gift, we have to applaud Sadio Mane’s endeavour. He was furious with himself for losing the ball. Then five seconds later, he was intercepting Kepa’s attempt at a pass and scoring to make it 2-0.</p>

<p>The defending champions flexed their muscles here. After last week’s narrow win over Leeds, they followed it up with a strong performance at Stamford Bridge.</p>
