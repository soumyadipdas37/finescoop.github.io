<p>In a decision released on Wednesday, the grand jury indicted just one of the officers involved, Brett Hankison, with 'wanton endangerment for shooting recklessly at Taylor's neighbors. </p>

<p>In a statement, the former vice-president said: 'In the wake of her tragic death, we mourn with her mother, family, and community and ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. </p>

<p>Joe Biden released a statement questioning whether justice 'could be equally applied in America' after a grand jury declined to indict three officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor</p>

<p>Fired officer Brett Hankison (left) was indicted on three charges of wanton endangerment for the no-knock raid that killed 26-year-old Taylor (right) on March 13</p>

<p>'I know for so many people today's decision does not answer that call. A federal investigation remains ongoing, but we do not need to wait for the final judgment of that investigation to do more to deliver justice for Breonna.</p>

<p>'We know what is necessary. We need to start by addressing the use of excessive force, banning choke holds, and overhauling no-knock warrants.'</p>

<p>Biden ended the statement saying that 'violence is never acceptable'. He told reporters earlier in the day that 'it's totally inappropriate' for protests to turn into riots and that it would sully Taylor's memory.  </p>
