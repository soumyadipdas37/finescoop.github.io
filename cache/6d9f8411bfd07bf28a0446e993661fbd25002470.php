<p>Olivia interrupted: 'I do know you, I know loads about you. I've seen the way you treated my friend.  </p>

<p>'I’m sorry but grown women aged 26+ sitting around talking badly about a 19 year old girl doesn’t sit right with me and I honestly don’t understand why the producers allow it. Its not entertainment it’s bullying. CALL IT WHAT IT IS,' a different fan wrote.</p>
