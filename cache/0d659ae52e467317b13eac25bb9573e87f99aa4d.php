<p>The grieving mother of a toddler who fell off a pier and drowned last week says her family is afraid to return to the scene - as she breaks her silence on the tragic accident.</p>

<p>Anna Greaney, two, died at Portarlington Pier, 28km east of the Victorian city of Geelong on Thursday. </p>

<p>She was the youngest of four children, to mother Billee and father Patrick. </p>

<p>Ms Greaney said the family has been trying to focus on the positives as they mourn the loss of little Anna. </p>

<p>'This afternoon we got to go to the funeral home for a few hours and just give her a wash and dress her, hold her and spend time with her,' she told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'I thought that was going to be extremely hard. And I'm not saying it was easy, but it was probably healing to be able to have that time with her.' </p>

<p>Ms Greaney remembered Anna as a happy child who used to pick her flowers from the garden, and lit up a the sound of the Bluey theme song. </p>

<p>A crowdfunding campaign to help pay for the funeral service also raised more than $32,600 in just four days.</p>

<p>On the page, Ms Greaney described her gratitude for the support, but nothing could compensate the loss of her child. </p>

<p>'I don't really care about the money I just want my baby back,' she wrote.  </p>

<p>The funds will be used to plan a family trip to Ireland when restrictions ease, the birthplace of husband Patrick.</p>

<p>Despite the support, Ms Greaney said she is desperate to move back to her hometown Kyabram where she won't face the daily reminder of losing Anna.  </p>

<p>'We are struggling being in Portarlington. The whole town looks over the ocean, it's been a struggle for me particularly,' she said. </p>

<p>'Nate and Miranda don't want to go anywhere near the water, we try to take them down to the pier to remind them that we were here a lot and we had a lot of good memories, but they just have the bad memory for now.'</p>

<p>But she said the pier has become a place her husband Patrick goes to heal, and feel closer to their lost daughter.</p>

<p>The funeral is being held on Thursday afternoon, and will be live-streamed online at the Jonathan Hepner Funerals website.</p>

<p>The Greaney family will then pack up and heading to Kyabram on the weekend.  </p>

<p>The community has organised an online vigil for Wednesday night, with locals encouraged to light a candle to honour Anna's memory.</p>

<p>The event was initially planned for the Portarlington pier, but will be staged online due to COVID-19.   </p>
