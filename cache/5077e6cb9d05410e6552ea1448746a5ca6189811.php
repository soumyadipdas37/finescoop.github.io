<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>London's Heathrow Airport could axe up to 1,200 jobs, around a quarter of its frontline roles, as a result of a downturn in the industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sky News reported on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The airport has informed union officials that it was triggering a 45-day consultation period about the proposed cuts, Sky News said, citing unidentified sources. </p>

<p>Heathrow has seen passenger numbers drop dramatically during the last six months, with July's traffic reportedly down 95% year-on-year. </p>

<p>It comes a week after Gatwick announced plans to axe up to 600 jobs in a 'signifcant restructure' after feeling the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on passenger and air traffic numbers.</p>

<p>The airport is operating at around 20 per cent of its capacity and has around 75 per cent of its staff on furlough.</p>

<p>Consultations have begun with staff over redundancies, as it prepares to cut up to 24 per cent of its workforce.</p>

<p>This is a breaking news story. More to come. </p>
