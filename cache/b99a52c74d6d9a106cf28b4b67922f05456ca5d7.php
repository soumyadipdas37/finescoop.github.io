<p>Tottenham goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos confronts referee Peter Bankes at full time</p>

<p>Eric Dier conceded a controversial stoppage-time penalty in the 1-1 draw with Newcastle</p>

<p>'Tottenham Hotspur FC's goalkeeper coach, Nuno Santos, has been suspended from the touchline for one match and fined £8,000 after admitting a charge for a breach of FA Rule E3 and accepting a standard penalty,' read an FA statement.</p>

<p>'At full-time of the Premier League fixture against Newcastle United FC on Sunday he used abusive and/or insulting language towards a match official on the field of play and/or his behaviour amounted to improper conduct.'</p>

<p>A Video Assistant Referee (VAR) intervention awarded Newcastle a last-gasp penalty in north London on Sunday, owing to a heavily-questioned handball decision against Eric Dier.</p>

<p>Spurs had been heading for victory thanks to Lucas Moura's first Premier League goal since December, but Callum Wilson buried the spot-kick to level the match. </p>

<p>Santos was among a clutch of players to vociferously protest the decision, that proved just the latest in a spate of controversial handball calls following the recent rule changes.</p>

<p>Spurs boss Jose Mourinho refused to criticise the officials or the new handball interpretations in light of the draw, determined not to receive any personal fine.</p>

<p>International Football Association Board (IFAB) rule amendments mean that if the ball hits the hand of a player who has made their body 'unnaturally bigger' then a foul will be awarded.</p>

<p>The switch has led to a swathe of disputed penalties at the start of the new Premier League campaign, with Manchester United claiming a similar spot-kick at Brighton and Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson left infuriated too.</p>

<p>Speaking after Sunday's match, Mourinho said: 'I don't want to comment, I just don't want to. My team played a fantastic match, I cannot ask more from the players.'</p>
