<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>NRL legend Greg Inglis has revealed he considered taking his own life at the height of his fight with depression.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old spoke of his battles with his inner demons during a presentation for his Goanna Academy in Macksville on the NSW mid north coast on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Inglis' academy strives to raise awareness about mental health, with the 267-game veteran telling his class he contemplated suicide while struggling during his career.</p>

<p>'I was never to that point of actually doing it but it crossed my mind for a split second. That was enough for me to actually go out and need more help,' he told 9News.</p>

<p>Greg Inglis (pictured with girlfriend Alyse Caccamo) considered suicide during his mental health struggles in his career</p>

<p>Inglis will go down in history as one of the NRL's most dominant players, starring for the Melbourne Storm, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Queensland and Australia in his illustrious career.</p>

<p>But a season-ending knee injury to his ACL in 2017 led to a downward spiral for Inglis as he plunged into a deep depression using alcohol as a coping mechanism.</p>

<p>In May of 2017 he reached out for help, checking himself into a rehabilitation centre, but it didn't solve the problem.</p>

<p>As he sank lower he was prescribed a variety of medications for anxiety and depression, but he continued to hit the bottle.</p>

<p>Two years later he found himself at a low point he said he 'needed to hit'.</p>

<p>Inglis spent two stints in rehab and on his second stay he was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder.</p>

<p>Inglis told students at his Goanna Academy of his fight with demons in his career. Pictured: Inglis takes a moment before announcing his retirement in April 2019</p>

<p>He retired from the game in April last year and has managed to turn his life around with the help from mood stabilising medication he was given.</p>

<p>Inglis hopes his story and his academy will encourage anyone struggling with their mental health to make a positive change for their future.</p>

<p>The Indigenous three-time premiership winner also addressed Gold Coast Titans star Tyrone Peachey was called a 'black c***' during a match last week.</p>

<p>Inglis believes the incident proves that racism is still a major issue in Australian sport. </p>

<p>'It’s pretty s*** to be honest. You just think of your family, where you come from and your history. To be racially abused, it’s disheartening,' he said.</p>

<p>'I don't know if it's just a brain snap or just the way they've been raised. It's not something you pick up, it's something you're taught or been around.'</p>

<p>Inglis is set to make his return to rugby league for the Warrington Wolves in the English Super League in 2021.</p>

<p>The NRL legend (pictured playing for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2019) hopes his story will encourage people who are struggling to make a positive change</p>
