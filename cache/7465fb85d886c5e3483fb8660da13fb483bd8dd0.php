<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Students finishing year 12 are being urged to have a gap year at home and swap overseas holidays for picking fruit in the bush.   </p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has prompted a casual labour shortage as foreign travellers returned home, leaving 70,000 backpackers to work on regional farms during harvest season.  </p>

<p>A parliamentary inquiry set up to replace that workforce, which is usually between 150,000 and 200,00, suggested school leavers work in exchange for a discount on university fees.  </p>

<p>The proposed 'Australia Needs You' campaign would also allow the unemployed to earn money working on farms without impacting their JobSeeker benefits. </p>

<p>Chair of the inquiry, New South Wales Liberal MP Julian Leeser, released an interim parliamentary report on Tuesday with the ambitious recommendations which are supported by both sides of parliament.</p>

<p>A parliamentary inquiry has proposed 'Australia Needs You', a campaign which would offer school leavers discounts on university fees for doing farm work (stock image)</p>

<p>The Berowra MP said the agriculture sector has suffered a severe labour shortage with up to 60 per cent of the workforce made up of foreign backpackers. </p>

<p>When the coronavirus pandemic struck in March, labour companies and farmers reported a rise in Australians contacting them for work - but that dropped off as soon as the government announced JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments.  </p>

<p>Global travel restrictions, due to COVID-19, also meant school leavers have been unable to take their usual overseas holidays. </p>

<p>Mr Leeser said if the 40,000 young Australians who have a gap year in the UK, US and Canada worked on farms instead, it would fill the labour shortfall.  </p>

<p>'Young Australians love adventure, they want to meet other Australians,' he said. </p>

<p>'They want to make some money at a time when a lot of jobs they would otherwise do in hospitality and retail aren't there.' </p>

<p>The interim report recommends the government offer a discount on university HECS fees but has left the final figures up to the Treasurer and Education Minister.  </p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic means Australia needs at least 70,000 foreign backpackers to work on regional farms during harvest season (stock image)</p>

<p>Unemployed Australians would also be paid for farm work and be allowed to keep their JobSeeker payments under the plan.  </p>

<p>During the consultation, Mr Leeser heard concerns that travels costs would be to high so the committee suggested a travel and accommodation allowance as well.  </p>

<p>Mr Leeser warned action needs to be taken to support farmers who are facing the prospect of not being able to harvest fruit from their trees.  </p>

<p>He told listeners a citrus farmer from Emerald is pulling out 100 hectares of fruit trees that will take six years to grow again.</p>

<p>'The reason he's pulling them out is he doesn't think he will get the people to go and pick those trees,' he said. </p>

<p>The MP warned if a solution is not found it will mean less local fruit and higher prices. </p>

<p>The government will also consider allowing people to remain on JobSeeker payments if they complete regional work during harvest season (stock image) </p>

<p>The Committee recommends ‘Have a Gap Year at Home Campaign’ to attract young Australians, particularly the current cohort of Year 12s and university graduates, to undertake regional work</p>

<p>For the next 12 months, workers should still receive JobSeeker payments while undertaking low paid agricultural and horticultural work</p>

<p>A one-off payment to help with the travel and accommodation costs incurred</p>

<p>Changes to the Working Holiday Maker visa for the next 12 months to allow extensions in exchange for regional work </p>

<p>Offer incentive to international students who have completed their studies to stay longer in exchange for work in peri-urban, regional, rural and remote parts of Australia</p>

<p>Government recommended a review in 12 months </p>
