<p>'Fun and silly!' Tommy Lee, 57, has expressed he's now 'actually having fun being silly' on TikTok after initially being 'dragged onto it' by wife Brittany Furlan, 33</p>

<p>TikTok has become the latest social media craze thanks to its viral dance challenges and comedy skits.</p>

<p>And hosts David Campbell and Belinda Russell couldn't resist pointing out that Tommy had jumped on board the TikTok bandwagon to promote his new music material. </p>

<p>The star explained: 'You know what, Tiktok is really fun and it lets everybody like be their own director, producer of their own little clips. You see funny dances, Apple phone hacks. It's nice and silly. </p>

<p>'At first I thought "No, this is silly". But then it is all my wife's fault because she has millions and millions of followers on there. And she's a comedian and what have you. She is always doing crazy stuff!'</p>
