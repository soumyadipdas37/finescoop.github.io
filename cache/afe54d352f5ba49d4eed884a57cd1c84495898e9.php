<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The ruler of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, has died at the age of 91. </p>

<p>Sabah had been in hospital in the United States since July following surgery for an unspecified condition in Kuwait that same month. </p>

<p>'With great sadness and sorrow, we mourn... the death of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Emir of the State of Kuwait,' said Sheikh Ali Jarrah Al-Sabah, the minister in charge of royal affairs, in a television broadcast. </p>

<p>The leader of the US ally came to power in 2006, after decades as the country's top diplomat, following a vote to oust his predecessor just nine days into his rule. </p>

<p>Nicknamed the 'dean of Arab diplomacy' Sabah stood out for his efforts to push to resolve a bitter dispute between Qatar and other Arab nations that continues to this day. </p>

<p>But as Kuwait's ruling emir, he struggled with internal political disputes, the fallout of the 2011 Arab Spring protests and seesawing crude oil prices that chewed into a national budget providing cradle-to-grave subsidies. </p>

<p>His designated successor is his brother, Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah.  </p>

<p>The ruler of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, has died at the age of 91</p>

<p>The crown prince had already taken over some of Sabah's duties after the ailing ruler left Kuwait in July following his surgery.</p>

<p>Sabah flew for treatment in the US which has been a staunch ally of Kuwait since the American-led war that drove Saddam Hussein's invaders out of Kuwait in 1990. </p>

<p>A US Air Force C-17 flying hospital transported Sheikh Sabah from Kuwait to Rochester, Minnesota, home of the flagship campus of the Mayo Clinic - a rare gesture by the US government.  </p>

<p>Authorities did not reveal the nature of Sabah's illness, but news of his frailty led to an outpouring of support from across the Middle East.  </p>
