<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insisted he was satisfied with his side's performance despite conceding three goals in their thrilling season opener against Leeds on Saturday night. </p>

<p>The champions led three times but were pegged back on each occasion by Marcelo Bielsa's fearless side.</p>

<p>Virgil van Dijk was at fault for Leeds' second goal by Patrick Bamford and Mateusz Klich was left unmarked to flash a volley past Alisson for the third.</p>

<p>A thrilling encounter was settled by hat-trick hero Mohamed Salah's spot-kick in the 88th minute for a 4-3 victory.</p>

<p>He said: 'I said before the game we would struggle against them because the way they play is uncomfortable and it is different to all the other teams.</p>

<p>'If you don't respect the opponent they kill you in a football way and I liked a lot the attitude of my team today. I have to say they just don't stop, I like it.</p>

<p>'I didn't see us struggling defensively but the way they play you cannot defend 100 per cent of the time.</p>

<p>Virgil van Dijk was criticised for his mistake that led to Patrick Bamford's goal at Anfield</p>

<p>'For the first goal both full-backs were deeper than the centre-halves and that should never happen in football. The second goal was a misunderstanding between Virgil and Ali (Alisson Becker) and I don't think we will see these situations very often.</p>

<p>'The third one we changed Hendo (Jordan Henderson) not long before and our formation was moving and we didn't close one gap.</p>

<p>'The back line (of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Van Dijk and Andy Robertson) played for England, Holland and Scotland four days ago - all top teams but different ways of defending.</p>

<p>'And if things are not settled early in pre-season defending is not riding a bike - so there is space for improvement.'</p>

<p>Mateusz Klich was left unmarked to flash a volley past Alisson for the visitors' third goal</p>
