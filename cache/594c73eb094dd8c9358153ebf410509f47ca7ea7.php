<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Justin Langer has admitted Australia got it wrong in not taking a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter message on their return to cricket for their white-ball matches against England.</p>

<p>Fast bowling great Michael Holding criticised the Aussies along with England and Pakistan for dropping the gesture before matches as soon as West Indies went home from their 2-1 Test defeat here.</p>

<p>And Australia coach Langer said ahead of Wednesday's deciding one-day international at Emirates Old Trafford that Holding was right and his side should have shown solidarity with the movement in their first internationals since the death of George Floyd in America.</p>

<p>Justin Langer admits Australia got it wrong in not taking a knee in support of Black Lives Matter</p>

<p>'We could have talked about it more leading up to that first game,' said one of Australia's great former opening batsmen. 'There was so much going on leading to us getting here but we should have thought about it more.</p>

<p>'Michael Holding is one of the great people of world sport, certainly of our game, and I have got great admiration and love for him. We all watched his heartfelt thoughts at the start of the summer and when he says things it's important we all listen.'</p>

<p>Langer says both Australia's men's and women's teams have discussed ways in which they can make a sustained difference in diversity and inclusion and did not mean any disrespect by not following the example of England and West Indies in taking a knee.</p>

<p>Langer said Holding was right and his side should have shown solidarity with the movement</p>

<p>'There is a lot of talk in our group about how we can make a powerful response,' added Langer. 'It's incredibly important and if it looked from Mikey's point of view that we didn't show respect I can only say that wasn't our intention. We are very aware of it.'</p>

<p>Even though Langer has admitted Australia's regret there are no plans for both them and England to correct thgeir mistake and take a knee before Wednesday's final one-day international.</p>

<p>Jofra Archer insisted on Monday that Holding had got it wrong and nobody had forgotten about Black Lives Matter. Sportsmail understands England's players are working on plans to make a longer term difference.</p>
