<p>Unique: Lottie Moss came up with a novel way to ensure she didn't forget her covering, as she sported a face mask dress on her stroll around London on Thursday</p>

<p>As well as covering her nose and mouth, the garment skimmed over her lithe figure, showcasing her tiny waist.</p>

<p>Putting her toned pins on display, Lottie went bare legged, slipping her feet into chunky black boots. </p>

<p>The model, who is the younger half sister of Kate Moss, completed the look by styling her glossy golden locks in high bunches. </p>

<p>Dressed to impress... and protect: In a sensible yet stylish move, the 22-year-old model ensured she kept covered up in the one-piece by PrettyLittleThing</p>

<p>Lottie was flying solo on the outing, but she has been linked to a string of men in recent weeks.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Lottie was seen putting on a cosy display with a mystery hunk following a lavish meal with friends in London. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, she fuelled dating speculation as she spent time with Love Island star Chris Hughes during a recent holiday. </p>

<p>In videos and pictures shared to Instagram, Chris, 27, can be seen putting on a cosy display with the blonde, and even proceeds to drape his leg over her.</p>

<p>Media personality Chris split from his ex-girlfriend, Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson, in April.  </p>

<p>Lottie was also linked to Roman Kemp amid claims she had been on a 'tipsy' date with I'm A Celebrity star and Capital FM host. </p>

<p>News of their alleged fling came just three weeks after the broadcaster split from his girlfriend of three years Anne-Sophie Flury. </p>

<p>A mutual friend told The Sun on Sunday: 'They have known each other through the party circuit for a few years, but nothing has ever happened before.</p>

<p>'Roman's always thought she was beautiful, and decided to pluck up the courage to ask her out.'   </p>

<p>Eligible bachelors: Lottie was flying solo on the outing, but she has been linked to a string of men in recent weeks, including Roman Kemp (L) and Chris Hughes</p>
