<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Ham supporters were left hugely alarmed on Wednesday after co-owner David Sullivan warned that the club aren't guaranteed to make any new signings.</p>

<p>The Hammers have endured a summer of discontent and the pressure has intensified once again on the owners after seeing no fresh faces walk through the door while they sold highly-rated Grady Diangana to West Brom for £20million. </p>

<p>Fans have been furious with the direction West Ham are going in - some supporters have supported the GSB (Gold, Sullivan, Brady) Out campaign, with a small group of protestors unfurling anti-ownership banners outside the ground before kick-off against Newcastle on the opening day of the season.</p>

<p>David Sullivan (centre) has admitted he can't guarantee West Ham will make any signings</p>

<p>And on Wednesday, Sullivan told talkSPORT that the transfer market leaves him 'depressed' while claiming he can't bring in the players that manager David Moyes is looking for.</p>

<p>Sullivan revealed: 'It's the manager's decision. He doesn't want to bring in players who are just numbers, just squad players. He wants to bring players in who will improve the team.</p>

<p>'We have a number of bids in for a number if players, but teams don't want to lose them; these are key players at decent sized clubs, outside the UK. They don't want to lose them so whether we get any of these players I do not know.'</p>

<p>West Ham have been heavily linked with James Tarkowski from Burnley but they have struggled in their pursuit while they have interest in Juventus' Daniele Rugani.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they have lost out on both Eberechi Eze and Ryan Fraser to Premier League rivals Crystal Palace and Newcastle respectively. </p>

<p>It has been a turbulent summer at West Ham with the club unable to bring in any fresh faces</p>

<p>He continued: 'We've got a very unbalanced squad. We've now got the funds to buy a player or two, but unfortunately at the moment the players the manager wants we can't get, and he'll be spending 18 hours a day looking at types trying to find players.</p>

<p>'I'm waiting for targets for the manager and we've got two or three bids in, but unfortunately the benchmark is very high and it's very hard to get those players.'</p>

<p>Sullivan finally added: 'I can't just go and sign two or three players the manager doesn't want. I could quite easily tomorrow go and sign two or three players but we'd have a civil war at West Ham, because I don't pick the players. </p>

<p>'We have a manager who is a manager, not a coach; if he was a coach I could do that, but that's not the way it works at West Ham – the managers pick the teams.</p>

<p>'I cannot say for sure we are going to sign anybody. As each day passes, I get more depressed.'</p>
