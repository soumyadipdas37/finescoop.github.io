<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It all started with a moody, exceptionally well-done fan trailer that went viral.</p>

<p>And now one year later, Morgan Cooper's fan-made vision of The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air as a gritty and dark drama will become a reality, with a high profile two-season order at NBC's nascent streaming platform Peacock.</p>

<p>The Fresh Prince himself Will Smith broke the news Tuesday, in a recorded call uploaded to YouTube with Bel-Air creator Cooper along with Chris Collins, a cowriter and executive producer.</p>

<p>Big news: Will Smith announced Tuesday that Morgan Cooper's fan-made vision of The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air as a gritty drama will become a reality, with a two-season order at Peacock</p>

<p>Morgan's viral video, uploaded in March of 2019, featured actor Jerry Madison in Smith's role as a transplanted youth from Philadelphia dealing with a new set of circumstances in Bel-Air, California. </p>

<p>The minor police kerfuffle Will experiences in the opening credits of the lighthearted Nineties sitcom is re-approached in the new clip, giving it new weight and meaning in light of more current accounts of repeated police brutality and violence against Black Americans.</p>

<p>To date, the Bel-Air video has racked up more than 6million views on YouTube alone, while it can also be viewed on alternative platforms such as Vimeo. </p>

<p>Smith also shared the video of his announcement on Instagram, writing in the caption, '8 months ago, a young filmmaker from Kansas City <?php echo e('@'); ?>cooperfilms uploaded a video on YouTube reimagining The <?php echo e('@'); ?>freshprince of Bel-Air for present day as a DRAMA! </p>

<p>'Everybody sent it to me,' the Oscar nominee continued. 'It was outstanding. I had NEVER envisioned revisiting the Banks family in this way. We knew this was special, so we called <?php echo e('@'); ?>ryokanproductions and asked him to lead the team (he wrote on The Wire) and he said YES! Months of writing, developing and pitching… and now it’s happening.</p>

<p>'Bel-Air got a TWO SEASON order, debuting in 2021 on <?php echo e('@'); ?>nbc’s streaming service <?php echo e('@'); ?>peacocktv. Morgan Cooper and Chris Collins, you are THE TRUTH!!' he concluded.</p>

<p>Smith also shared the video announcement on Instagram, referring to the initial Bel-Air clip as: 'Outstanding' and 'special'</p>

<p>'Everybody sent it to me,' the Oscar nominee also wrote. 'I had NEVER envisioned revisiting the Banks family in this way'</p>

<p>Smith also shared his excitement in the video call, remarking that the two season order based off of a pitch (as opposed to a filmed pilot) is 'unprecedented'.</p>

<p>'I've been in this business for 30 years, and that does not happen!' he exclaimed. </p>

<p>The timing of the new Bel-Air series is perfect – if 2020 has taught Hollywood execs anything, it's that real-life stories featuring Black voices and lives need to be placed front and center in the mainstream.</p>

<p>Smith, Cooper and Collins will all co-executive produce the new series, alongside Quincy Jones, Benny Medina, and original series creators Andy and Susan Borowitz. </p>

<p>The streamer recently set in motion a new take on the classic 1995 teen comedy Clueless, this time told from Cher's bestie Dionne – a role originated by Stacey Dash.</p>

<p>Reboots of Battlestar Galactica and Queer As Folk are also being worked on at Peacock, in addition to a sequel series to Saved By The Bell. </p>

<p>Clearly, Nineties nostalgia is running high – news of Bel-Air's series order comes after it was announced last week that HBO Max is adding a Fresh Prince reunion special to its lineup.</p>
