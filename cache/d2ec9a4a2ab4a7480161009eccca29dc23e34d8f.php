<p>'Happy Fathers Day! Spending today with this human is a blessing,' she wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>'Have a great day to all the Dads, Step Dads, Father Figures, Mentors and caregivers.' </p>

<p>It comes after Steve, 44, recently spoke about fatherhood and being a single dad to his four children, whom he shares with three different mothers.</p>

<p>Just the two of us: 'Happy Fathers Day! Spending today with this human is a blessing,' she wrote. 'Have a great day to all the Dads, Step Dads, Father Figures, Mentors and caregivers'</p>

<p>He told The Daily Telegraph on Friday that he prioritises talking about his ex-partners in a 'positive light' for the sake of the children. </p>

<p>'My children are their mother and me and [you need] to be mindful of that part within them and talk of the other parent in a positive light because otherwise children start to question their identity,' Steve said.</p>

<p>'You want them to focus on just being the age that they are,' he added.</p>

<p>Steve and Michelle began dating in 2015, after splitting from their respective partners. They announced their split in January this year.</p>

<p>Following their break-up, Michelle was arrested for drink driving on Australia Day and fined $750.</p>

<p>She tearfully said: 'I would like to apologise to my family, friends and community for this gross error in judgment and the consequences of these actions will haunt me forever.'</p>
