<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Being a younger son in an aristocratic family can be hard to take. But for a twin brother, it’s even more galling.</p>

<p>Due to being born just a few minutes later, Martin Janson has had to watch his brother Alistair become the 25th Earl of Sutherland and inherit the bewitching Dunrobin Castle, with its 120,000 Scottish acres.</p>

<p>And now Martin appears to have suffered another blow from beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Due to being born just a few minutes later, Martin Janson has had to watch his brother Alistair become the 25th Earl of Sutherland and inherit the bewitching Dunrobin Castle (pictured), with its 120,000 Scottish acres</p>

<p>I can reveal that he has been left just £250,000 in the £18 million will that his mother, Elizabeth, Countess of Sutherland, wrote three days before she died last December aged 98. By contrast, his sister, Lady Annabel Bainton, was bequeathed £3.5 million.</p>

<p>Newly published probate documents confirm that the Countess made a new will, determining the fate of her vast fortune, drawn up with the assistance of Farrer &amp; Co, the Queen’s solicitors.</p>

<p>Elizabeth left £25,000 to each of her grandchildren, £10,000 to each of her great-grandchildren, and £5,000 both to Alistair’s current wife, Gillian, and to his first wife, Eileen.</p>

<p>Farrer explains that it cannot comment, nor could staff at 189-room Dunrobin Castle, which the Countess and Alistair restored to its former glory after years of institutional use as a boys’ boarding school and opened it to the public.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had inherited the castle when her uncle, the 5th Duke of Sutherland, died childless in 1963.</p>

<p>The Countess, who was also Chief of Clan Sutherland, was orphaned at the age of ten, before becoming, in quick succession, a Land Girl during World War II, a proficient linguist and an accomplished laboratory technician.</p>

<p>A fellow aristocrat expresses confidence that neither Alistair nor Martin will have been taken aback by their mother’s last gasp will.</p>

<p>‘They are a very well advised family,’ he assures me. ‘All sorts of other trusts and so forth — dating back many years — will apply. And I’m sure that lots will have been handed over during her lifetime.’</p>

<p>Small is beautiful as Forte says ‘I Do’ </p>

<p>And the bride wore a white trouser suit: Irene Forte at her wedding</p>

<p>Princess Beatrice seems to have set a trend for tiny weddings.</p>

<p>Her friend Irene Forte has followed suit and married quietly rather than wait for a big ceremony.</p>

<p>Sir Rocco Forte’s younger daughter had planned to exchange vows in front of hundreds of guests in Sicily, but made do with a register office instead.</p>

<p>Irene, 31, who works for her father’s hotel empire, wore an Yves Saint Laurent trouser suit as she tied the knot with tech whizz Felix Winckler, 35, at Chelsea Old Town Hall in front of a small group of family and friends.</p>

<p>‘It was a lovely day,’ a pal tells me. ‘They hosted a small lunch at their home afterwards. A bigger celebration will happen at some point in the future.’</p>

<p>Her elder sister Lydia’s Tuscan wedding to Greek shipping heir Dimitri Chandris was one of the society events of 2016.</p>

<p>Spandau Ballet star Tony Hadley has revealed his son was almost run over by George Michael. ‘He lived just up the road,’ Hadley says. ‘My Tom was playing in the street and, being a complete idiot, lying in the middle of the road. Coming round the corner there’s this huge Range Rover, it screeches to a halt and George Michael jumps out. ‘He says: “For God’s sake, Thomas Hadley, what the hell are you doing lying in the road?” and he went, “Oh, sorry George,” who said, “Well, don’t do it again, or I’ll tell your dad.”’</p>

<p>Birthday girl Jemma has her sparkle back </p>

<p>Jemma Kidd, who suffered a heart-breaking end to her 15-year marriage to the Earl of Mornington during lockdown, was certainly not short of love on her birthday.</p>

<p>Turning 46 at the weekend, the mother-of-three was joined by her model sister Jodie, Jodie’s nine-year-old son Indio, as well as fellow make-up artist Mary Greenwell, eco-campaigner Sarah Woodhead and fashion stylist Alex Longmore.</p>

<p>Jemma, who can continue to use her Countess of Mornington title until she marries someone else, described it as ‘the happiest of nights’.</p>

<p>New BBC boss Tim Davie wants to tone down Left-wing bias on comedy panel shows. But how far does Davie’s writ run? Ian Hislop, celebrating 30 years as Have I Got News For You team captain, recalls: ‘There was an episode years ago when a previous director-general of the BBC, John Birt, told the show not to mention his friend Peter Mandelson. We did. A lot.’</p>

<p>Hairdresser to the stars John Frieda has fallen victim to a most audacious theft. ‘While we slept, burglars broke through our wrought-iron gates, drove up the garden, went to our pool and stole the paving stones,’ says John’s wife Avery, who has two children with Frieda. He was formerly married to pop star Lulu. Architect Avery, the widow of Fiat heir Giovanni Agnelli, is now warning neighbours in the village of Upton Grey in Hampshire to watch out. ‘Please all be super vigilant as this is really ballsy!’ </p>

<p>Why Emma is turning to a hypnotist</p>

<p>Emma Weymouth demonstrated her fitness on Strictly Come Dancing. Now, she wants us to focus on our mental health.</p>

<p>Emma, 34, who became the Marchioness of Bath when her colourful father-in-law died of coronavirus in April, has revealed that she is regularly hypnotised.</p>

<p>‘My friends know I love to work out but, during these uncertain times, taking care of our minds as well as our bodies is so important,’ Lady Bath says, referring to her hypnotherapist.</p>

<p>‘Kara Mia has guided me with her wonderful technique, to help me better understand how to access the subconscious. I cannot thank her enough.’</p>

<p>Eccentric fashion designer Dame Zandra Rhodes refused to let the pandemic ruin her 80th birthday celebrations at the weekend.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been managing to have my friends over in groups of five,’ the pink-haired Zandra tells me, referring to the ‘rule of six’. She says: ‘It worked out really well. My age is moving, but I don’t feel old.’</p>
