<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Melbourne's 9pm curfew will finally be lifted after the state recorded just 16 new cases on Sunday. </p>

<p>Victoria also suffered another two deaths in the 24 hours to Sunday morning, taking its total to 784.</p>

<p>The number of new cases and deaths is up from Saturday's total of 14 cases and one death.</p>

<p>The two-week rolling daily case average of 23.6 is well under the 30-50 case average health authorities were aiming for. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, no new coronavirus infections were detected in NSW on Sunday, the first zero-cases day in almost four months.</p>

<p>The state has in the past week recorded several days of no new local cases, but this is the first day where there were also none in hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>The last time zero cases of any kind were reported in NSW was June 10, before infected Victorians caused an outbreak in Sydney.</p>

<p>There are still 90 active cases in NSW, nine of whom are in hospital and three in intensive care.  </p>

<p>Crowds were allowed at an NRL match between the Wests Tigers and the Parramatta Eels at Bankwest Stadium on Saturday night as Sydney has very few coronavirus cases</p>

<p>Just 18 cases were detected over the past week, only one of which was from an unknown source.</p>

<p>The tiny number of new cases in recent weeks led to South Australia opening its border to NSW and increases pressure on Queensland to follow suit.</p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, facing an election next month, is stubbornly refusing to open the NSW border.</p>

<p>She demands there be no community transmission for 14 days in a row, despite there being almost none for weeks.</p>

<p>NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian continues to reap the benefits of nipping an outbreak in Sydney in the bud with no new cases on Sunday</p>

<p>NSW Health official Christine Selvey urged residents with any symptoms to keep getting tested despite there being so few cases.</p>

<p>'We continue to ask people to remain vigilant and come forward for testing immediately if symptoms such as a runny nose, scratchy throat, cough or fever appear,' she said.</p>

<p>'This is particularly important with the start of the school holidays and increased movement of people around the state.'</p>
