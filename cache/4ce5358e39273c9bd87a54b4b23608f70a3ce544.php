<p>Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor. </p>

<p>'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.' </p>

<p>Cate is heading the jury at Venice during an historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.</p>
