<p>'I'm working in clay to create functional and sculptural wood-fired ceramics from my home and studio in West Sussex,' he explained previously.</p>

<p>'I've always had a strong affinity with creating objects, having spent much of my childhood crafting imagined landscapes and sculptural models, which naturally led me to clay during my later years at school.'</p>
