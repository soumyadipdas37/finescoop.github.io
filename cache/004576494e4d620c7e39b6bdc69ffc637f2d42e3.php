<p>Following an article 27 March 2010 'Is this the Bravest Bride in Britain?' we are happy to clarify that Earl Spencer did not eject his second wife Caroline from their marital home, he did not evict Raine Spencer from Althorp and he did offer Princess Diana accommodation after her separation from Prince Charles. We regret any misunderstanding.Â </p>
