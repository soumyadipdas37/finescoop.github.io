<p>Brighouse Farms, next door to the ex-England footballer's new home, has revealed plans for two sheds with a combined floor size of 1,886 sq m.</p>

<p>In plans submitted to Cheshire East Council, the expert breeders also want to build a dark-room laboratory 'used for the handling and storage of sheep semen and embryos for artificial insemination' right by the six-bed mansion. </p>

<p>Ironically, Rooney - who needs to listen to the sound of a Hoover to get to sleep - is a player-coach at Derby County, known as the Rams. </p>

<p>Cheshire East Council will decide on the application at the end of next month. </p>

<p>Wayne Rooney's neighbours have applied for permission to keep 1,000 sheep next door to his £20million Cheshire mansion. Brighouse Farms, next door to the ex-England footballer's new home, has revealed plans for two sheds with a combined floor size of 1,886 sq m</p>

<p>Wayne Rooney's sheep breeding neighbours have applied for permission to keep 1,000 Australian sheep next door to his £20million Cheshire mansion</p>

<p>The planning documents state: 'The buildings have been designed to be within keeping of other modern buildings in the surrounding areas of Cheshire.</p>

<p>'It is essential that the sheep are housed during certain periods within the year, this includes during lambing and also during service.</p>

<p>'The hay which is produced on the land needs to be stored immediately following harvest to ensure that the quality does not deteriorate.' </p>

<p>The proposals also explain the farmers' experience in the high-tech breeding programme, which goes on next to the Rooneys' manor.</p>

<p>'Mrs Brighouse combines her qualities and farming experience with her scientific approach to the frequent lambing system,' they state.</p>

<p>The huge six-bedroom country house, which has already taken three years to build, has been mocked for looking like an out-of-town Morrisons supermarket </p>

<p>Work on the 40-acre estate near Knutsford stopped in April due to concerns around building supply deliveries as lockdown restrictions came into full force.</p>

<p>A football pitch has been built on the site, and the home will have its own orangery, snooker room with bar, cinema and swimming pool. </p>

<p>Rooney is also having a security system installed, as well as an underground tunnel and a bunker where he will keep a getaway electric car. </p>

<p>Safety precautions are being taken after the footballer's family suffered an attempted burglary at their old home in 2016 while Rooney was playing a match.</p>

<p>Robert McNamara from Scarborough, North Yorkshire admitted attempting to enter as a trespasser with intent to steal on August 3, 2016. The former serviceman was jailed for two years and eight months. </p>

<p>It will have its own orangery, football pitch, bar, cinema and swimming pool when fully built</p>

<p>Rooney and Coleen reportedly paid a Cheshire property £4million to build their dream three-storey mansion in 2017, kitted out with state-of-the-art security features </p>

<p>Rooney and Coleen reportedly paid a Cheshire property £4million to build their dream three-storey mansion in 2017, kitted out with state-of-the-art security features.</p>

<p>Shortly after acquiring the plot, they entered a 22-month long planning row with locals who objected to the building of a farmer's shed to house and tractor and hay bales. The dispute was settled in Rooney's favour.</p>

<p>Neighbours also objected to a 9ft security fence which they claimed was an eyesore that would 'urbanise' the countryside. Again, they were overruled in Rooney's favour.</p>

<p>The ex-Premier League star's bunker will apparently have CCTV, a kitchen and a toilet for a guard and a secure pick-up area, according to The Sun. </p>

<p>The mansion has a subterranean basement home to a steam room, plunge pool, hot tub, cinema room with 10 seats, wine cellar and snooker room with bar. It will also include a patio, landscaped gardens, a luxury car garage and a stable block. </p>
