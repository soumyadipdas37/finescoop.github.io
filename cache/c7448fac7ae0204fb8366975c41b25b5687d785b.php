<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>For 32 excruciating hours there was hope that missing autistic teenager William Wall, 14, would be found alive - that he would walk out of the dense bushland outside Melbourne dazed and with a few scratches, but otherwise unscathed.</p>

<p>William was last seen going for a jog on Tuesday - his disappearance sparking a massive search, and the tearful appeals of his distraught family tugging at the nation's heartstrings.   </p>

<p>But the sad reality is the search for William - hampered by Stage Four covid restrictions that stopped volunteers joining the hunt -  was never going to have a happy ending. </p>

<p> When police put out the news on Wednesday afternoon the autistic teenager had been found dead it was accompanied by an ominous statement. </p>

<p>'His death is not being treated as suspicious and police will prepare a report for the Coroner,' it read. </p>

<p>It can now be tragically confirmed that William's death was from suicide. </p>

<p>William Wall (Pictured), 14, was found dead at Yarra Junction, Melbourne on Wednesday, 32 hours after going missing on his daily jog on Tuesday</p>

<p>William's distraught father Shane (pictured) struggled to fight back tears as he thanked volunteers, police, the SES and family members who had been searching all night</p>

<p>Hours earlier, police had come under fire after worried locals had been turned away from helping the search efforts. </p>

<p>As far as they knew, the 14-year-old had gone out for his daily jog along the Yarra Ranges' Warburton Trail at 6.45am on Tuesday, promising his family he would be back in 15 minutes. </p>

<p>But he never returned to his home in Launching Place. </p>

<p>It remains unknown how long WIlliam had been dead before his body was found. </p>

<p>In all likeliness, the search - perhaps unbeknown to those that participated - was a recovery mission from the start.  </p>

<p>William's disappearance had sparked an air and ground search involving about 100 personnel from Victoria Police and the State Emergency Service.</p>

<p>But police appeared keen to enforce Melbourne's stage four coronavirus restrictions, which includes staying within a five kilometre radius from home.</p>

<p>William's two older brothers and friends, who spent Tuesday night with rescuers looking for him on dirt bikes were stopped from continuing their search the next day.</p>

<p>'We've been told by all the police, saying we're not allowed to help because we're beyond the five kilometre radius, which is going to put more of a delay in finding him,' his older brother Harrison told Seven News.</p>

<p>Family friend Flynn Cousens added: 'I'd rather go outside the five kilometre radius and find him than stick to five kilometres and let him stay out there another night.' </p>

<p>William's older brother Harrison Wall (pictured) was stopped by police from continuing the search due to Melbourne's strict stage four lockdown restrictions</p>

<p>It's understood William's body was found in bushland at the end of a residential street less than two kilometres from his home.</p>

<p>Last night, William's family gathered at the blocked off road near where his body was found. </p>

<p>Distraught rescuers and locals were also seen consoling each other at the scene.</p>

<p>Family friend Tyson Truscott said the Walls would be shattered by the tragedy. </p>

<p>'He was a great kid. There is nothing bad about him. He loved going for runs, he went flat out,' he told the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the outcome as very sad news.</p>

<p>'My heart goes out to William’s family and loved ones. Thank you to all those who were involved in the search,' he tweeted on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Federal health minister Greg Hunt added: ' So deeply sorry to hear of the loss of William Wall. Just a terrible, terrible loss of a beautiful young life. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, his friends and the Yarra Ranges community.'</p>

<p>The search entered its second day on Wednesday after rescue crews spent overnight searching the area after temperatures plummeted to 7C.</p>

<p>Locals fumed after being advised to keep an eye out for William, but not to breach Melbourne's stage four COVID-19 restrictions by limiting outdoor time to two hours and staying within the five kilometre radius from home.</p>

<p> 'In line with coronavirus restrictions, at this stage we do not require any assistance from the public,' a post on the Eyewatch Yarra Ranges Police Facebook read on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>'We want to say a big thank you however, for the all the offers we have received.'</p>

<p>Police later claimed their position had nothing to do with lockdown.</p>

<p>'This is not to do with COVID,' local police commander Inspector Jason Goddard told reporters.</p>

<p>'We don't want to bring this into a COVID conversation. What we are doing is focusing our search on Will.</p>

<p>'If the resourcing we have on the ground here and deployed today is not adequate we will ask for more resources.'</p>

<p>Locals vented their anger at police during a tense meeting. </p>

<p>'If that my kid out there, I would want every person on the ground out there, just having a look,' one resident said.</p>

<p>William's distraught father Shane struggled to fight back tears as he thanked volunteers, police, the SES and family members who had been searching all night.</p>

<p>'I just want everyone to be safe,' he told reporters on Wednesday afternoon, hours before police confirmed his son had been found dead. </p>

<p>'I never want to be in this situation but the people around here are fantastic. I mean, I've been in the valley for a long time and come from overseas but this has just blown me away.'</p>

<p>'Actual support from local people, the Facebook community and the noticeboards and that, fantastic. Top notch and the police and SES, again, it has been great.'</p>

<p>'I have hardly spoken to my wife much but they are liaising with them to look after her and I'm out helping where I can.'</p>

<p>At the time, he was still hopeful William would be found alive, adding his son was 'pretty hardcore' and knew the area well.</p>

<p>Police advised volunteers to stay home instead of search for William, saying: 'At this stage we do not require any assistance from the public'</p>

<p>William's dad Shane Wall fought back tears during a press conference on Wednesday, several hours before the search for his son came to a tragic end</p>

<p>Mr Wall said his 'energetic, very athletic' son loved exercise and had dreams of joining the police force or the army when he got older. </p>

<p>William had a younger sister, Sophie, and two older brothers Jake and Harrison, who joined the search effort on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>William's disappearance had come three months after non-verbal autistic teen William Callaghan became separated from his family during a walk at Mount Disappointment, 60km north of Melbourne.</p>

<p>The teen spent two nights alone before being miraculously found safe and well.  </p>

<p>For William's family, there would be no happy ending. </p>
