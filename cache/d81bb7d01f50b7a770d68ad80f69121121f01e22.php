<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Google Maps is adding a new layer that gives users update information on coronavirus outbreaks in a selected region.</p>

<p>The new feature comes on the heels of other coronavirus-related updates to Maps, including info on crowdedness, COVID-19 transit alerts and travel restrictions. </p>

<p>Users tap the 'layers' button on the right hand corner of the map and click on 'COVID-19 info'</p>

<p>A seven-day average of new infections per 100,000 people will appear, as will a label indicating whether the cases are trending up or down.</p>

<p>Color coding on maps indicates the density of new cases: Gray indicates no cases in a given region, with yellow representing 1-10 cases, orange 10-20, dark orange 20-30 cases, red 30-40 cases, and dark red indicating more than 40 cases per 100,000 residents.</p>

<p>The COVID layer starts rolling out worldwide this week on Android and iOS. </p>

<p>A new layer on Google Maps allows users to see details on COVID-19 outbreaks in a given region, like the Florida Heartland (seen here). Seven-day averages are presented, along with a label indicating whether the number of infections is trending up or down</p>

<p>Trending data is visible at the country level for all 220 countries and territories that Google Maps supports, the company said, along with state, county, and city-level data where they're available. </p>

<p>Google says the figures come from multiple sources - including Johns Hopkins, Wikipedia, and the New York Times- that are in turn pulling data from medical centers, state and local governments, and the World Health Organization. </p>

<p>'Many of these sources already power COVID case information in Search, and we're now expanding this data to Google Maps,' said Google Maps product manager Sujoy Banerjee in a blog post on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'Our hope is that these Google Maps features will help you get where you need to be as safely and efficiently as possible.' </p>

<p>Google Maps users can tap on the 'layers' button on the right hand corner of a map and click on 'COVID-19 info'. The feature is available on the country level worldwide, and for cities, states and municipalities where available</p>

<p>In June, Google Maps began including details about public transit routes being impacted by the pandemic.</p>

<p>It also added driving alerts to notify motorists about COVID-19 checkpoints and restrictions along their route, including when crossing international borders.</p>

<p>Google Maps now also includes health facilities near users that support COVID-19 testing, with an alert reminding users to verify eligibility and facility guidelines to avoid being turned away 'or causing additional strain on the local healthcare system.'</p>

<p>Google Maps' COVID-19 layer for the Central United States. Color coding indicates the density of new cases, from gray (zero cases) to dark red (more than 40 cases per 100,000 residents)</p>

<p>In some regions, users can also see which restaurants offer delivery and carry out.</p>

<p>This month Google partnered with Apple on contact-tracing software using Bluetooth to alert people if they have been in close proximity with someone diagnosed with COVID-19. </p>

<p>Users can decide whether they want to declare they have tested positive, as well, using a unique PIN to keep their identity anonymous.   </p>

<p>Google Maps tackled another national crisis this summer when it added a wildfire boundary map providing the near-real-time outline of a conflagration a traveler may encounter, with directions to current news and helpful information from local authorities.</p>
