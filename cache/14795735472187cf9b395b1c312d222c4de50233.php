<p>And Rafferty Law certainly seemed to have inherited his parents' good looks as he was seen arriving at the Valentino show at Milan Fashion Week on Sunday. </p>

<p>The actor, 23, put on a brooding display as he clenched his jaw for the camera and dressed in only blacks and greys. </p>

<p>Stylish: Rafferty Law certainly seemed to have inherited his parents' good looks as he was seen arriving at the Valentino show at Milan Fashion Week on Sunday</p>

<p>Rafferty wore smart black cuttaway trousers, which he matched with a dark V-neck sweater and grey Valentino trench coat.</p>

<p>He had a set of polished black trainers on his feet, while he accessorised with a chunky golden chain around his neck.</p>

<p>The London-based performer slicked his chestnut curls back across his head, and sported stubble on his cheeks.       </p>

<p>The rising star is currently waiting the upcoming release of his feature film Twist, a modern-day adaptation of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, which was due to come out this year.</p>

<p>Movie star looks: Rafferty slicked back his hair and clenched his jaw for the cameras</p>

<p>Safety first: The London-based performer was seen to don a face mask as a result of the ongoing pandemic</p>

<p>Rafferty is keen to show off his abilities, explaining in an interview earlier this year with Wonderland magazine: 'The script and the cast blew me away. I was like, "The pressure is on. I really need to put in the time."'</p>

<p>Reflecting on forging an acting career in the shadow of his famous parents, he added: 'I think there have been advantages and disadvantages to it.'</p>

<p>'I've always focused on pursuing the things I love and proving to people that I'm hardworking.</p>

<p>His father's son: Although still coming to fashion events, Rafferty is set to kick start his movie career this year</p>

<p>Multi-talented: Rafferty is also the frontman for 'modern-day street punk' band Outer Stella Overdrive</p>

<p>'I'm just really excited for Twist to come out. I want it to speak for itself. And the same with my music.' </p>

<p>Rafferty is also the frontman for 'modern-day street punk' band Outer Stella Overdrive, who are releasing their first EP this year.</p>

<p>As well as his hard work and multiple talents Rafferty wants to be known for 'kindness' too, a quality he respects in his mother Sadie, 54.</p>

<p>Out and about: Mika made a rare public appearance as he also attended the presentation</p>

<p>'She goes out of her way to reach out to people [and] she's always encouraged me to find my own path,' he gushed. </p>

<p>Jude, 47, and Sadie divorced in 2003, after six years of marriage. </p>

<p>In her autobiography Crazy Days, Sadie blamed depression that 'weaved a dance of destruction' through her adult life on the breakdown of their marriage.</p>

<p>Jude is now married to psychologist Phillipa Coan, 32, who he recently welcomed his sixth child with.</p>

<p>Better safe than sorry: The Beirut-born musician, 37, proved safety comes first as he sported a protective face mask to the star-studded presentation</p>

<p>Sharp: Flashing a peace sign at the cameras, the media personality cut a dapper figure in a sharp white suit, which he teamed with a plain T-shirt</p>

<p>Slick: The award-winning songwriter looked suave in his smart two-piece, which featured a longline blazer and matching trousers</p>
