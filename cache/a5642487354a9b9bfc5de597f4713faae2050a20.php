<p>The chat show took home the gong for Best Daytime Show with Alison Hammond presenting the award to the pair on during the programme.</p>

<p>With fellow ITV series Good Morning Britain also up for the award, Phillip couldn't resist saying: 'Thank you, sorry Piers!' after his win.  </p>

<p>Alison made the announcement, taking the award out of the oven as she informed viewers there was no ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>She said: 'This Morning has won a TV Choice Award for Best Daytime TV show everyone. It’s in the oven.  </p>

<p>'Because of Covid, there’s no award show or anything. This is the fifth one we’ve won now. We’ve beat GMB, Piers Morgan, Loose Women, The Chase.</p>

<p>Holly added: 'And we do like this award because it’s voted for by the readers.'</p>
