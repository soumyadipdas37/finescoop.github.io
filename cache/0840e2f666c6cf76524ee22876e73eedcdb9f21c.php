<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A teenager joined neo-Nazi group Feuerkrieg Division after taking an online 'test' where he expressed hatred for Jews and discussed making ammunition that could 'smash heads,' a court has heard. </p>

<p>The second day of a trial at Birmingham Crown Court was told the 17-year-old wanted to create a firearm capable of 'smashing heads' after joining the so-called Feuerkrieg Division (FKD) last summer.</p>

<p>The youth, from Rugby in Warwickshire, cannot be named for legal reasons.</p>

<p>The second day of the 17-year-old's trial at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) got underway today. Prosecutor Matthew Brook described Feuerkrieg Division (FKD) as: 'A group that believes violence - and in particular mass shootings - are good'</p>

<p>Continuing the Crown's opening of the case on Wednesday, prosecutor Matthew Brook said the boy had asked an adult friend for advice on where he could buy a blank-firing gun.</p>

<p>Outlining discussions the boy had on neo-Nazi group chat forums, Mr Brook said they showed the defendant was offering 'concrete, practical advice about not only converting a blank-firing gun, but making ammunition for it that will 'smash heads'.</p>

<p>The court heard the teenager was given an online test to ensure he was a 'worthy' FKD recruit, before being admitted to two private chat groups for UK-based extremists.</p>

<p>During the test, Mr Brook said, the youth defined fascism as 'the pursuit of restoring the natural order' and said he wanted to provoke a race war.</p>

<p>Jurors were told the defendant also used the test to describe Jews as 'a parasite which must be eradicated'.</p>

<p>In a series of posts, alleged to be a reference to converting a blank-firing weapon, the youth wrote: 'Blank-firing plus drill press. You can drill through the barrel with a strong drill bit.</p>

<p>'It's the best balance of form and function without getting a purpose-built gun.'</p>

<p>Breaking off from taking the jury through a record of the online exchanges, Mr Brook told the jury: 'The Crown say it is important to see this conversation in its proper context.</p>

<p>'This is a conversation between members of an extreme right-wing group.</p>

<p>'A group that believes violence - and in particular mass shootings - are good and will bring about a breakdown in society which will give them the opportunity to achieve their fascist aims.</p>

<p>'The prosecution say that even before joining FKD, the defendant was interested in whether this was a serious group that could be involved in physical action in the real world, rather than being in his words 'just an online thing'.'</p>

<p>Prosecutors allege the boy, who had access to a drill-press, claimed the converted weapon would be able to fire a steel ball.</p>

<p>In another online exchange read to the jury, the youth is alleged to have said: 'I'm getting armed and getting in shape. I'd urge everyone to do the same.'</p>

<p>The defendant denies a single count of preparation of terrorist acts between April and September last year. The trial continues.</p>
