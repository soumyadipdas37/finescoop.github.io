<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A collection of luxury homes with free access to the vast Blenheim Palace estate have gone on the market for up to £1.2million.  </p>

<p>Construction began in 1705 with financial support from Queen Anne, but the Crown cancelled investment on the project in 1712 after it became the subject of political infighting. </p>

<p>The palace became the home of the Churchill family for the next 300 years, and was the birthplace of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1874. </p>

<p>Throughout its past, various members of the family made changes to the interiors, surrounding parks and gardens, before it was saved from ruin by the 9th Duke of Marlborough's marriage to US railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt in 1895.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Park View development said: 'At Park View we're creating new homes differently to other developers.</p>

<p>'By planning and building patiently, choosing partners who share our values, using materials and designs which fit the local style, and preserving habitats and routes for wildlife, we're building a community that we're all proud to have as part of our legacy.</p>

<p>'The homes have been designed and built to reflect the houses that are typical of Woodstock, so that even though they are new, they feel like part of the existing fabric. It's a more sustainable way of building.</p>

<p>'Using a simple palette of materials and features, like Natural Cotswold Stone and timber sash and casement windows, we've built the homes in a way that's been proven to stand the test of time.' </p>
