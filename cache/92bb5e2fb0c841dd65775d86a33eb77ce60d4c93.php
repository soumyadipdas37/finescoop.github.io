<p>The former Bulgaria international believes the Red Devils need to sign a centre back and a right back despite Ole Gunar Solskjaer's side splashing £130m on centre-half Harry Maguire and right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka last summer.</p>

<p>United have been in hot pursuit of Jadon Sancho and some believe they still need to buy a centre forward but Berbatov disagrees.  </p>

<p>Manchester United need two signings to complete their team according to Dimitar Berbatov</p>

<p>'For United I think they only need two, in my opinion: a centre-back and a right-back,' Berbatov told the MEN. 'The priority for me is a centre-back and then the team will be pretty much complete, in my opinion.' </p>

<p>'The striker needs to be really exceptional [if United move for one] but don't go and buy just for the sake of buying. You have enough strike power. Some people can argue they need a more experienced striker around the young strikers at the moment, which is a good point, actually. But who is that going to be?</p>

<p>'Because then you need to keep him happy as well, and at the moment you have Ighalo in that position in that role if you want it like this.'</p>

<p>This is despite Ole Gunar Solskjaer's side splashing £130m on centre-half Harry Maguire</p>

<p>So is there a specific striker suitable for United? 'Yes,' Berbatov replied. 'Myself! Ha ha ha.</p>

<p>'From the top of my head, no, because I really like Rashford and Martial, I really do, and what I saw from Greenwood last season, he deserves his playing time. He's earned it.</p>

<p>'And if they put Sancho in that picture then we'll have a great young line-up of strikers who can develop in the time and become even better.' </p>

<p>United have been in hot pursuit of Borussia Dortmund forward Jadon Sancho this summer</p>

<p>United are ready to negotiate a price for Sancho with Borussia Dortmund after reaching a compromise with the player's camp over the terms of a five-year contract.</p>

<p>United ended weeks of stalemate on Wednesday when they made a breakthrough in talks over Sancho's wages and the agents' fees.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands they are ready to hand Sancho a contract that will run until 2025 with United having the option to extend it by another 12 months. </p>

<p>Some believe the Red Devils still need to buy a centre forward but Berbatov disagrees</p>
