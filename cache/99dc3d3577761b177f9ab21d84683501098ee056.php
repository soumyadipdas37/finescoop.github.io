<p>Merging cultures: More than 20 years after the film's release, Sam Neill (pictured) has explained the unique Australian flag he wore on his uniform in Event Horizon</p>

<p>The unique design replaced the Union Jack with the Aboriginal flag, merging the two iconic designs together.</p>

<p>A fan explained the apparent reasoning behind this in a post on Twitter on Wednesday, and Sam later confirmed their explanation.</p>

<p>'Today I learnt: For the Sci-Fi Horror film "Event Horizon" Sam Neill requested that the Australian flag on his character's uniform remove the Union Flag from the corner &amp; for it to be replaced with the Aboriginal flag, the way he thought it should look in 2047,' wrote the fan.</p>

<p>Fun fact: A fan explained the apparent reasoning behind the flag's design in a post on Twitter on Wednesday, and Sam later confirmed their explanation</p>

<p>Sam responded to the tweet and said he had no regrets about changing the design: 'This is indeed so. And I wouldn't do it any differently today.'</p>

<p>In an interview with GQ Australia last month, Sam revealed his tendency to shun the limelight and said he doesn't consider himself to be a celebrity.</p>

<p>'When people call me a celebrity or star or something like that, these words are completely meaningless,' he explained. </p>

<p>Making history: Sam said he had no regrets about changing the design: 'This is indeed so. And I wouldn't do it any differently today'</p>

<p>'Because I know people who are stars and I'm not one of them - they live completely different lives to me, and I don't envy them.'</p>

<p>He also said that after moving his family to Los Angeles in the early '90s, he decided to leave after a year, deciding it wasn't a place he wanted to be.</p>

<p>'I like going there, I have a lot of friends there and I'm always happy to work there, but I just don't want to live there. It's not conducive to my state of mind,' he added. </p>

<p>Low-key life: In an interview with GQ Australia last month, Sam revealed his tendency to shun the limelight and said he doesn't consider himself to be a celebrity. Pictured at the Sitges Film Festival in Spain in October 2019</p>
