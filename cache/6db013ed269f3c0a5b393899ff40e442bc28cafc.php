<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother of baby twins struggling to cope mentally amid the coronavirus pandemic found solace in the stock market, racking up thousands of dollars within weeks.  </p>

<p>Caitlin Edie, 30, from the Gold Coast but living in Sydney, turned to stock trading in April as a personal project while stuck at home during lockdown. </p>

<p>She placed an initial investment of $1000 in Afterpay and Webjet shares, which rapidly jumped to $4500 in four weeks, before later growing to $6000. </p>

<p>'I had nothing in my life that was mine,' the mother-of-four told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>Mother-of-four Caitlin Edie, 29, began trading on the stock market to 'fill the void of daily life pre-COVID-19'. She is pictured with twins Roya and Yazmin</p>

<p>'I cannot even try to explain how overwhelmed I was at the beginning of COVID-19. It has changed my life.'</p>

<p>Ms Edie, whose daughters Roya and Yazmin were only three months old when the outbreak hit, said trading has been a saviour for her in darker times. </p>

<p>The property manager kept a busy schedule and worked until just a few weeks before the birth of the twins in November last year. </p>

<p>But when the country entered lockdown in March, the full-time mum found herself feeling extremely stressed in isolation, home schooling daughters, Violet, seven, and Harmony, five, while caring for the twins.</p>

<p>She fell ill with a post-cesarean infection that made her exhausted and, as the pandemic crippled the economy, there were fears Ms Edie's partner Iman, also 30, may lose his job in real estate. </p>

<p>'All of a sudden here I am alone, recovering from the pregnancy,' she said. </p>

<p>'My mental health started to plummet, I had no support because our families couldn't visit because of the lockdown. </p>

<p>'It was a nightmare for the majority of March.'</p>

<p>Ms Edie bought shares in Afterpay and Webjet for $1000, which rapidly grew to a total of $6000 in about four weeks</p>

<p>Ms Edie loved her job and has missed work since leaving in November last year to give birth to the twins (pictured) </p>

<p>Everything changed the following month when she discovered stockbroking app Commonwealth Securities, or CommSec, and began buying shares. </p>

<p>1. Do your own research</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Don’t put in more money than you are willing to lose</li>
</ol>

<p>3. Hold stock positions for a minimum of 12 months </p>

<p>4. Do not panic when shares' values go up and down</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Have a diverse profile </li>
</ol>

<p>Fortunately, her initial investments paid off- something she credited as a 'fluke' and not calculated at all. </p>

<p>'I don't even know how I wound on CommSec,' she said.</p>

<p>'I was just adding different stocks, having a look on google for stocks to add and looking at at the app for about a week.'</p>

<p>'We were lucky we had a bit of savings before COVID hit, so we had a bit more of a buffer than other Australian families had.' </p>

<p>Ms Edie, who missed work, said the project was 'not about money' but about having something of her own, although she does enjoy holding winning positions.</p>

<p>She reinvested some of her profits, and six months later is sitting on $10,000 worth of stock.</p>

<p>In total, she has invested $3000, but said she is very careful and decisive before laying money down.</p>

<p>As her project has made her thrive and eased stress, the positive effects have radiated throughout her entire family.</p>

<p>'It has inspired us as a family. It has given us a new outlook on money and how even in lockdown where people don't have money, you can create the opportunity to make money.' </p>

<p>Ms Edie offered five tips for anyone considering entering training. </p>

<p>The first step is to do research to find out which companies you may be interested in investing in, and their prospect for increasing in value. </p>

<p>'I research everything for a couple of weeks before I invest,' she said. </p>

<p>'Do not jump on the 'fear of missing out' bandwagon. Watch the stock, read the announcements, look up the company.</p>

<p>'It is so important.'</p>

<p>When lockdown hit, Ms Edie began home schooling her older daughters, Violet, seven (far right) and Harmony, five, while looking after the newborn twins </p>

<p>Once you have selected a stockbroking firm, Ms Edie recommends not put more money into shares that you are willing to lose.    </p>

<p>'If you can put in $500 don't put in a $1000. If the market takes a turn for the worst you are going to lose sleep over it,' she said.  </p>

<p>While Ms Edie uses CommSec, she said there are other stockbroking apps available, some that can sync with your bank, making the process user friendly.</p>

<p>To see the best results, hold your stock positions for a minimum of 12 months.</p>

<p>'Let them have the time to have time to grow,' she said.</p>

<p>'If you have done your research and you believe the in the company there is no reason to just let them go.'</p>

<p>Next, remain calm if share values fluctuate. </p>

<p>'Don't panic when stocks go up and down. That is what the stock market is meant to do,' she said. </p>

<p>Last, ensure you keep a diverse profile.</p>

<p>'Profile diversity is important as it helps balance your profile out. Do not invest everything in one place.'</p>

<p>Ms Edie said trading has inspired the family and given them a new outlook on money. She is pictured with her partner Iman and the twins</p>
