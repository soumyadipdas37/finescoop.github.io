<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The first cruise ship to sail to Greece since the coronavirus lockdown has docked at the port of Piraeus today after 12 crew members tested positive for Covid-19. </p>

<p>The Maltese-flagged Mein Schiff 6, operated by German travel giant TUI, is carrying 922 passengers and 666 crew.</p>

<p>Nobody will be allowed to disembark as testers from Greece's public health agency board the ship for screening.</p>

<p>The Greek coastguard said on Monday that 12 crew members had tested positive, although TUI Cruises said that they were asymptomatic and follow-up tests came back negative today.</p>

<p>The passengers had originally being given a clean bill of health after undergoing tests prior to the voyage, the Greek coastguard said on Monday.</p>

<p>The cruise ship departed from Heraklion in Crete on Sunday with all passengers having tested negative before boarding. </p>

<p>But sample tests on 150 crew members detected 12 infections, and the ship had to return to Piraeus with better access to health services.</p>

<p>The ship halted at the Aegean island of Milos on Monday after the infections were detected, before being rerouted to Piraeus. </p>

<p>TUI Cruises said late on Monday that a second round of tests held on board showed that half of the crew found positive earlier had since tested negative.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, a health ministry official said that repeat tests for the rest of the 12 crew members conducted en route to Piraeus were also negative.</p>

<p>Greek health authorities boarded the ship on Tuesday morning and conducted a third test, the official said, adding that results were expected later in the day.</p>

<p>TUI Cruises says the affected crew on the ship have been isolated, adding that all crew members would be tested.</p>

<p>The cruise industry has taken a major hit from the pandemic, with some of the earliest large clusters of Covid-19 occurring aboard cruise ships.</p>

<p>At one stage, the Diamond Princess cruise ship had the world's largest outbreak outside China while moored off the coast of Japan.  </p>

<p>Voyages of large cruise ships only resumed in recent weeks in Greece after they were banned for months.</p>

<p>Greece was one of the first countries to encourage tourists to return after the lockdown but some islands have seen a rise in cases since then. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, seven Greek islands were added to England's quarantine list including Lesbos, Santorini and Mykonos. </p>

<p>Greece has seen 17,444 cases and 379 deaths in total.   </p>
