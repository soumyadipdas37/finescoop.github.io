<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tatler has unveiled its annual pick of the best prep and public schools in the UK.</p>

<p>The society bible's Schools Guide 2021 is packed with world-class educational institutions for children aged four to 18 - and unsurprisingly, many come with eye-watering fees. </p>

<p>Schools that offer yoga classes, eye-opening trips to orphanages in places such as Ghana and Cambodia, and lunchtime chefs hailing from The Ritz and Michelin-star restaurants all make the annual guide - as does one that boasts a Bake Off finalist as a geography teacher. </p>

<p>And the prep school attended by Prince George and Princess Charlotte is praised for producing 'kind, thoughtful and creative' pupils who are 'willing to stand up and be heard'.</p>

<p>Yet again south London's Dulwich College tops the list when it comes to price - at £7,082 a term for day students and £14,782 for boarders. </p>

<p>There are dozens of fee-paying primary and secondary schools in Tatler's guide, available in the October edition of the magazine, but here FEMAIL shares a selection of the most awe-inspiring...</p>
