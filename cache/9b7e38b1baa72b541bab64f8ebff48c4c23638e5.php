<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Schalke have confirmed that struggling head coach David Wagner has been sacked following their horror start to the new season.   </p>

<p>The Bundesliga club were thrashed 8-0 by champions Bayern Munich in their opener last weekend and then suffered a 3-1 defeat by Werder Bremen on Saturday.</p>

<p>'FC Schalke 04 have relieved David Wagner of his duties with immediate effect,' Schalke said in a tweet.</p>

<p>Schalke have confirmed David Wagner has been sacked just two games into the new season</p>

<p>The dismal run of form has now seen Schalke endure a winless run that stretches across their last 18 consecutive league games.</p>

<p>The 48-year-old joined Schalke in 2019 and in the first half of last season lived up to fans' expectations.</p>

<p>The club were firmly in Champions League contention, having been seven points off the top and with only three defeats in 17 games.</p>

<p>But they added only 10 more from their next 17 matches to end up 12th, eight points above the relegation play-off spot.</p>

<p>Schalke said that they would appoint Wagner's successor in the coming days.</p>
