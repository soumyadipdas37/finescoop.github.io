<p>Assistant chief constable David Thorne wrote on Twitter last night: 'Rave at Banwen is over! South Wales Police, Dyfed-Powys Police [and] British Transport Police teams have done a fantastic job this weekend of clearing this huge area from the 3,000 strong illegal gathering. Thank you to all involved.'</p>

<p>He previously said that police had difficulty shifting people from the 4,000 acre site, which is usually used for rally car racing.</p>

<p>'When there's 3,000 people to enforce a dispersal order on it becomes a massive issue,' he said.</p>

<p>'Even with the resources we were able to deploy at short notice it wasn't sufficient to be able to move people on any quicker in a safe way.</p>

<p>'The fact we've got less people now with the officers we've got available we will be taking proactive and positive action if people don't heed the dispersal notice.'</p>

<p>Fixed penalty notices have been issued for parking offences, with some vehicles having been towed away.  </p>

<p>Mr Thorne said: 'We think this is just completely irresponsible and disrespectful of the local communities.</p>

<p>'We believe those present to be from all over the UK - many of them have travelled hundreds of miles to get here so this hasn't happened by accident.</p>

<p>'This has been planned and possibly planned for a little while, but unfortunately they have been able to plan this under the radar so none of the authorities were aware.'</p>

<p>He added that the illegal ravers had not been hostile towards his officers and were just people with their own self-interest at heart intent on having a good time. </p>

<p>'The fact is,' he said, 'that it's illegal and it's causing nuisance and disruption to local communities so we can't allow that to happen.'</p>

<p>Hundreds left their cars and vans parked illegally, obstructing roads throughout the village.</p>

<p>One woman who attended the rave said she'd driven all the way from London to take part.</p>

<p>She said: 'I've come from Lewisham in London and we travelled up following the party line and it's been absolutely bloody fantastic. Met nothing but lovely people here as always.</p>
