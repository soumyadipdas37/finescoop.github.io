<p>The sighting comes just one day after news broke Thursday of Ehrich's breakup with Lovato, 28, whom he was dating for just six months.</p>

<p>The pair also were planning on getting married, and even perhaps eloping, after getting engaged in July.</p>

<p>Whilst another insider added: 'She doesn't trust him and thinks he's sketchy ... She feels he proposed to get attention.'</p>

<p>A third source explained: 'Things started going downhill [when he said he was flying out to Atlanta for work]. They were arguing a lot and Demi didn't want him to go without her... There has been a lot of tension and Demi left him to get a clear head.'</p>
