<p>It could even take a stake in the plant, according to reports. </p>

<p>This week, Japanese group Hitachi pulled out of plans to build a new nuclear power station at Wylfa on Anglesey, dealing another blow to the Government's nuclear plans and ramping up pressure to accelerate approving Sizewell.</p>

<p> The Government is under pressure to accelerate approve plans for a new nuclear power station at  Sizewell in Sufflock (pictured) after a project in Wales fell through</p>

<p>Of six sites earmarked for plants to replace the UK's ageing nuclear fleet more than a decade ago only one, Hinkley Point C, in Somerset, is being built.</p>

<p>But Sizewell poses problems because China's state-backed nuclear group, CGN, is a 20pc investor, alongside France's EDF.</p>

<p>Since the Government excluded Huawei's equipment from new 5G networks, relations with Beijing have deteriorated and will make it difficult for China to be involved in setting up a nuclear reactor in the UK.</p>

<p>The Government is looking at options to replace CGN, the BBC reported, and may take over the stake.</p>

<p>Alison Downs of campaign group Stop Sizewell C said: 'Sizewell would be a bad project whoever paid for it and wouldn't help the Government meet its policy imperatives. </p>

<p>It wouldn't contribute to net zero targets until 2040 and at £20billion would be more expensive, as well as slower than other technologies to address climate change.'</p>

<p>A Government spokesman said: 'Nuclear energy has a key role to play in meeting our net zero commitments. We regularly engage with all developers on their projects and are considering a range of financing solutions.'</p>
