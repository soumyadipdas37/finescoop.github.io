<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Brian Tatum, 45, has been charged with two counts of felony murder stemming from a high-speed chase in Houston that killed two Uber passengers </p>

<p>Two women riding in the back of an Uber in Houston were killed when police say another driver suspected of taking part in a street race slammed into the ride-share vehicle while leading police on a chase with speeds topping 100mph. </p>

<p>Brian Tatum, 51, was arrested on felony murder charges stemming from the crash on Saturday night that split the Uber in half, causing the deaths of the passengers, reported ClickOrlando. </p>

<p>According the Harris County Sheriff's Office, the incident began unfolding at around 11.30pm when deputies attempted to pull Tatum over as he and another car raced through several red lights in the area of Jensen Drive and Tidewell Road.</p>

<p>The other vehicle stopped but Tatum, who was riding with his wife in the car, sped off, leading deputies on a chase with 'excessive speeds,' according to the authorities. </p>

<p>The pursuit continued for a mile and ended when Tatum smashed into an Uber that was making a left turn at the intersection of Jensen Drive and Parker Road.</p>

<p>Police say Tatum was leading police on a chase with speeds topping 100mph on Saturday when he crashed into this Uber</p>

<p>Tatum's car, seen laying on its side, was later found to contain open containers of alcohol and drugs, according to investigators </p>

<p>'He basically cut the car in two,' Sean Teare, head of the Harris County District Attorney’s Office Vehicular Crimes Division, told Houston Chronicle.</p>

<p>The two female passengers who were riding in the backseat of the Uber were ejected from the vehicle. They were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.</p>

<p>Both the ride-share driver and the suspect were taken to Ben Taub Hospital to be treated for injuries.</p>

<p>Tatum has since been discharged and transferred to the county jail, where he was booked on two counts of felony murder.</p>

<p>A search of his vehicle has yielded open containers of alcohol and drugs, including marijuana, according to officials.</p>

<p>Tatum has extensive criminal records in both Texas and California, which span more than 20 years.</p>

<p>It is suspected that Tatum, who is a convicted felon, was taking part in a street race prior to the chase and crash </p>

<p>According to a letter that the Sacramento District Attorney's Office in California sent to the Board of Parole Hearings in September 2016 opposing Tatum's early release, the suspect's record includes charges of assault with a firearm, burglary, evading arrest and vehicular offenses.</p>

<p>In August 2014, he was sentenced to more than five years in prison after being convicted of assault with a firearm and convicted felon in possession of a firearm.</p>

<p>'Mr Tatum is a dangerous individual and a continuing threat to public safety,' Sacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert wrote at the time. 'The entire record in this case shows Mr Tatum has no interest in reformation or rehabilitation, and makes clear that if he is release early, he would pose a current unreasonable risk to public safety.'  </p>
