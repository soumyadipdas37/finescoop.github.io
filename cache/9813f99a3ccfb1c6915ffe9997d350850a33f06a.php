<p>The actress, 53, adopted Bella in 1992 during her marriage to Tom Cruise, but they grew apart after the Hollywood couple divorced in 2001 - allegedly because of Bella's commitment to the Church of Scientology.</p>

<p>But Nicole's fans noticed recently that Bella, 27, had started liking her mother's Instagram posts, leading to speculation they are healing their rift.</p>

<p>Have they healed their rift? Nicole Kidman (right) appears to be on the road to reconciliation with her daughter Bella Cruise (left), after decades of estrangement</p>

<p>One post Bella liked shows Nicole posing on a staircase in a green frock and hiking boots; another shows the Eyes Wide Shut star in a patterned dress and red cap.</p>

<p>These likes appear to be the first time Bella has shown any sort of warmth towards her adoptive mother - publicly, at least - in many years.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Nicole's publicist, Wendy Day, for comment.</p>

<p>'Liked by bellakidmancruise': Nicole's fans noticed recently that Bella, 27, had started liking her mother's Instagram posts, leading to speculation they are healing their rift</p>

<p>Bella, a former art student, has chosen to live her life away from the spotlight in Croydon, a suburb 19 kilometers (12 miles) outside London.</p>

<p>She married computer programmer Max Parker in a secret ceremony in 2015. </p>

<p>Nicole did not attend her daughter's wedding, despite being in London performing in a stage show at the time.</p>

<p>Show of support: One post Bella liked shows Nicole posing on a staircase in a green frock and hiking boots; another (above) shows the Eyes Wide Shut star in a patterned dress and red cap</p>

<p>Bella usually only posts images of her drawings on social media, but has recently shared some selfies which highlight her edgy sense of style.</p>

<p>She was adopted as a child by her parents, Nicole and Tom, in 1992.</p>

<p>Her biological younger brother, 25-year-old Connor Cruise, was also adopted by the A-list couple three years later.</p>

<p>Reconciliation? These likes appear to be the first time Bella has shown any sort of warmth towards her adoptive mother - publicly, at least - in many years. Pictured: Nicole and Tom Cruise with their children, Connor and Isabella, in Sydney on January 24, 1996</p>

<p>Nicole and Tom, 58, divorced in 2001 after more than a decade of marriage, when Bella was just eight years old.</p>

<p>While the exes initially shared custody of their children, it has been widely reported that Nicole has been estranged from Bella and Connor for years.</p>

<p>Like their father, Bella and Connor are practising Scientologists.</p>

<p>Notoriously private: Bella, a former art student, has chosen to live her life away from the spotlight in Croydon, a suburb 19 kilometers (12 miles) outside London. She married computer programmer Max Parker in a secret ceremony in 2015, which Nicole did not attend</p>

<p>The fact that Nicole is not a member of the controversial religion likely makes her a 'suppressive person', or SP.</p>

<p>Scientologists are encouraged to 'disconnect' from so-called SPs because they are considered a barrier to spiritual growth.</p>

<p>The Moulin Rouge! star has remained largely silent about her strained relationship with her adopted children.</p>

<p>Scientology siblings: Nicole and Tom divorced in 2001 after more than a decade of marriage, when Bella was just eight years old. While the exes initially shared custody of their children, it has been widely reported that Nicole has been estranged from Bella and Connor (left) for years</p>

<p>Rift: Like their father, Bella and Connor are practising Scientologists. The fact that Nicole isn't a member of the religion likely makes her a 'suppressive person'. Scientologists are encouraged to 'disconnect' from so-called SPs because they are considered a barrier to spiritual growth. Pictured: Nicole with her adopted children at an NBA game in Los Angeles in December 2004</p>

<p>'I'm very private about all that. I have to protect all those relationships. I know 150 per cent that I would give up my life for my children because it's what my purpose is,' she previously told Who.com.au.</p>

<p>She also once told Red magazine: 'Motherhood is about the journey. There are going to be incredible peaks and valleys, whether you are an adopting mother or a birth mother. What a child needs is love.' </p>

<p>Following her divorce from Tom, Nicole married country singer Keith Urban in 2006. They went on to welcome two daughters, Sunday, 12, and Faith, nine.</p>
