<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Phillip Schofield stunned This Morning viewers on Tuesday, when he mistakenly informed a viewer that he'd won £250,000 instead of £250.</p>

<p>The 58-year-old presenter was joined by his co-host Holly Willoughby, 39, as they conducted the ITV show's popular Spin To Win competition.</p>

<p>And while no participant has ever scooped hundreds of thousands of pounds, Phillip mistakenly announced one caller had won the princely sum along with a holiday.</p>

<p>Although Phillip later clarified that the gargantuan sum was an unfortunate slip of the tongue, viewers took to Twitter to share their amusement over the gaffe.</p>

<p>Wrote one viewer: 'When <?php echo e('@'); ?>Schofe tells a poor fella ringing in for a competition on #ThisMorning that he’s won a #UK #Staycation and £250,000 only to then tell him he’d made a mistake and it was actually £250!'</p>

<p>'Don’t think he won £250,000 looool,' tweeted another, while a third stated: '£250,000?! They’d go bankrupt!'</p>

<p>Gaffe: Although Phillip later clarified that the gargantuan sum was an unfortunate slip of the tongue, viewers took to Twitter to share their amusement over the gaffe</p>

<p>The competition was far from a smooth ride on Tuesday, as another viewer narrowly missed out on taking part because he didn't answer his phone correctly.</p>

<p>As part of the rules, entrants were required to answer their phones saying 'belle of the ball' once called by the show, in order to advance further.</p>

<p>However, one viewer answered his phone with 'belle of the belle', leaving Phillip and Holly scratching their heads about what to do next.</p>

<p>Phillip bellowed across the studio: 'What do we do? Adjudicator, adjudicator? Oh my God, they're saying move on. Sorry... bye.'</p>

<p>Princely sum: While no participant has ever scooped hundreds of thousands of pounds, Phillip mistakenly announced one caller had won the princely sum along with a holiday</p>

<p>The harsh decision prompted Holly to admit: 'I can't bear that, that was so close!'</p>

<p>Earlier in the show, Phillip took a friendly jab at Piers Morgan after This Morning beat Good Morning Britain to win a TV Choice Award.</p>

<p>The chat show, hosted by Phillip and Holly, took home the gong for Best Daytime Show with Alison Hammond, 45, presenting the award to the pair on Monday.</p>

<p>With fellow ITV series Good Morning Britain also up for the award, Phillip couldn't resist saying after his win: 'Thank you, sorry Piers!'</p>

<p>Alison made the announcement, taking the award out of the oven as she informed viewers there was no ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Winning: Earlier in the show, Phillip took a friendly jab at Piers Morgan after This Morning beat Good Morning Britain to win a TV Choice Award </p>

<p>She said: 'This Morning has won a TV Choice Award for Best Daytime TV show everyone. It’s in the oven. </p>

<p>'Because of Covid, there’s no award show or anything. This is the fifth one we’ve won now. We’ve beat GMB, Piers Morgan, Loose Women, The Chase.</p>

<p>Holly added: 'And we do like this award because it’s voted for by the readers.'</p>

<p>Alison admitted she thought This Morning won the prize due to their coverage of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>

<p>She said: 'This is due to COVID why we’ve got this and we do deserve it. We do.' </p>

<p>Hard luck: With fellow ITV series Good Morning Britain also up for the award, Phillip couldn't resist saying after the win: 'Thank you, sorry Piers!' Piers Morgan is pictured above</p>
