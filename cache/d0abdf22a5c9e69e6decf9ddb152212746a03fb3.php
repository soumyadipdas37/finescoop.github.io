<p>Members of the public acting as 'citizen scientists' have aided experts developing a new system for forecasting when potentially dangerous solar storms will hit Earth. Physicists from Reading enlisted help to analyse so-called 'coronal mass ejections' (CMEs), pictured — powerful expulsions of charged particles and magnetic field from the Sun's surface</p>

<p>'CMEs are sausage-shaped blobs made up of billions of tonnes of magnetised plasma that erupt from the Sun's atmosphere at a million miles an hour,' said space weather researcher Luke Barnard of the University of Reading.</p>

<p>'They are capable of damaging satellites, overloading power grids and exposing astronauts to harmful radiation. Predicting when they are on a collision course with Earth is therefore extremely important.'</p>

<p>But this, he explained, 'is made difficult by the fact the speed and direction of CMEs vary wildly and are affected by solar wind, and they constantly change shape as they travel through space.'</p>

<p>The researchers used computer models to predict when solar storms will arrive at Earth, using analysis provided by members of the public involved in the 'Solar Stormwatch' citizen science project.</p>

<p>They said that their models are able to run up to 200 different simulations — compared to the 20-odd currently used by more complex models.</p>

<p>The researchers found their forecasts to be 20 per cent more accurate, providing improved estimates of the solar wind speed and its impact on CME movement.</p>

<p>When they reach Earth, in as little as 15 hours, CMEs have the potential to damage electrical equipment — from orbiting satellites to ground-based energy grids.

<p>'Solar storm forecasts are currently based on observations of coronal mass ejections as soon as they leave the Sun's surface, meaning they come with a large degree of uncertainty,' explained Dr Barnard.</p>

<p>'The volunteer data offered a second stage of observations at a point when the CME was more established, which gave a better idea of its shape and trajectory.'</p>

<p>'The value of additional CME observations demonstrates how useful it would be to include cameras on board spacecraft in future space weather monitoring missions.'</p>

<p>'More accurate predictions could help prevent catastrophic damage to our infrastructure and could even save lives,' he concluded.</p>

<p>The full findings of the study were published in the journal AGU Advances.</p>

<p>Solar storms, or solar activity, can be divided into four main components that can have impacts on Earth:  </p>

<p>While these may seem dangerous, astronauts are not in immediate danger of these phenomena because of the relatively low orbit of manned missions.</p>

<p>However, they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks.</p>

<p>This photo shows the sun's coronal holes in an x-ray image. The outer solar atmosphere, the corona, is structured by strong magnetic fields, which when closed can cause the atmosphere to suddenly and violently release bubbles or tongues of gas and magnetic fields called coronal mass ejections</p>

<p>The damage caused by solar storms </p>

<p>Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost.</p>

<p>The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing Earth's magnetic field.</p>

<p>Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.</p>

<p>When Coronal Mass Ejections strike Earth they cause geomagnetic storms and enhanced aurora.</p>

<p>They can disrupt radio waves, GPS coordinates and overload electrical systems.</p>

<p>A large influx of energy could flow into high voltage power grids and permanently damage transformers.</p>

<p>This could shut off businesses and homes around the world. </p>
