<p>'We will just have to wait': Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson has revealed he and fiancée Grace Zito have postponed their wedding due to new lockdown rules (pictured in 2016)</p>

<p>Artist Ricky told The Mirror: 'We weren’t allowed singing in the church which was a big thing, 15 people just isn’t enough, it is too hard to make a decision who could be there and who couldn’t. I mean I am in a band with five guys. Also Grace wanted McBusted for the reception and there are too many of them for the rule of six.' </p>

<p>'You would like the freedom not have your brain reminded about the global pandemic when you are trying to celebrate the best day of your life. I think we will just have to wait.</p>

<p>'The weird thing is I am more excited about it now than ever, and I didn’t think I could get more excited. It would be great if there is a time when people are so desperate to have a good time that it goes on for days - I hope people say wherever it is and whenever it is we are coming and going to dance until our feet bleed.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid that from Monday a maximum of 15 people will be able to attend wedding ceremonies and receptions, though up to 30 can still attend a funeral as now.'</p>

<p>Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies and receptions were included in a list of exemptions to the ban on social gatherings of more than six.   </p>

<p>Current guidance states that up to 30 attendees are permitted in Wales, while in Scotland, ceremonies and receptions are limited to 20 people, and numbers are dependent on the venue in Northern Ireland.  </p>
