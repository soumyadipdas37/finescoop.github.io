<p>The firm raised its interim dividend to 2.04p, handing £49million to shareholders, which it said was a sign of its 'confidence for the future'. Shares fell 4.1 per cent.</p>

<p>The company also took on 46,000 staff in the first half, and will retain at least 13,000 of them on a permanent basis.</p>

<p>The hiring spree helped the supermarket double the number of online weekly orders to 325,000.</p>

<p>Potts also announced its 'biggest ever price cuts on customer favourites', adding it needed to 'compete in recessionary times'.</p>
