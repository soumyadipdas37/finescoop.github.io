<p>New lady? The quiz star is reportedly set to take part in the E4 reality series after admitting he's open to finding love again, following the end of his seven-year marriage to Katie</p>

<p>Last month Mark revealed he'd split from his wife Katie after seven years of marriage so she could be free to date her lover, after their plans to have an open marriage failed to work.</p>

<p>In a candid interview he admitted 'it's better for us to go our separate ways.' </p>

<p>He told The Sun: 'There was never any deceit on Katie's part but it's got to the point now where I realise it is better for us to go our separate ways and remain friendly.'</p>

<p>Over: Last month Mark revealed he'd split from his wife Katie after seven years of marriage so she could be free to date her lover, after their plans to have an open marriage failed to work </p>

<p>While Katie added: 'I just want everyone to know what's what and that we are all happy.'</p>

<p>It's been revealed that Katie, who works as a nurse, has been seeing her senior design engineer lover Scott Bate, 30, for 18 months. </p>

<p>Mark, who shares a three-year-old son with Katie, admitted that he had a feeling that she was seeing Scott, but decided to approach things sensibly for the sake of their son.</p>

<p>But when lockdown came, things between him and Katie became strained and she started seeing Scott, resulting in Mark making the decision to end their marriage for good.</p>

<p>He explained: 'When Katie first came clean to me about her boyfriend, I'd had an inkling. But right from the start, my attitude was quite pragmatic — this was spilt milk, what could we do about the situation to make it OK?'</p>

<p>He added that because they had a 'family' he simply could just 'throw that away lightly' as they had other 'considerations'.</p>

<p>The candid interview also saw Mark blame his hectic work schedule and being away from home a lot, as well as their age difference, as contributions towards the split. </p>

<p>While Katie continues to see her boyfriend, Mark expressed 'concerns' that Scott was 'good' to his son after the youngster began mentioning Scott's name.</p>

<p>Mark and Katie tied the knot at Arundel Castle, West Sussex, in October 2014. </p>

<p>In September last year, Mark confirmed he was still with his wife, despite her admission four months earlier that she had cheated on him with a younger man. </p>

<p>During an appearance on Loose Women, the TV personality was asked about the status of his marriage, where he admitted they have been 'through a rough patch.' </p>

<p>'Like a lot of relationships, you go through a rough patch. We're working our way through it,' Mark told the Loose Women. </p>
