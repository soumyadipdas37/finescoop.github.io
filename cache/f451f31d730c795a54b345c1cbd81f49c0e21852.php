<p>Paris included a black-and-white snapshot of herself and Reum sharing a tender moment.</p>

<p>She continued: 'You’ve filled my heart with so much love. I believe that everything happens for a reason because everything in my life, all the good and the bad, has led me right to you.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with People, the heiress opened up about enduring 'multiple abusive relationships' in her life.</p>

<p>'I was strangled, I was hit, I was grabbed aggressively. I put up with things no one should,' said the star, who believes she was set up for a future of abusive relationships while attending the Provo Canyon boarding school as a teenager. </p>

<p>Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, whom were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change.</p>

<p>'They all seemed like such nice guys and then the true colors would show,' Paris explained. 'They'd get jealous, or defensive or try to control me. And there there would come a point where they would become physically, verbally and emotionally abusive.'</p>

<p>Paris initially interpreted the 'crazy' behavior as an indicator of just how much they loved her.</p>

<p>'Looking back, I can't believe I let people treat me like that,' she said. </p>
