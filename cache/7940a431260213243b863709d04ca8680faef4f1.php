<p>The former TOWIE star, 34, spoke to Jane Moore, Christine Lampard, Judi Love and Gloria Hunniford on Thursday's Loose Women about her account on the subscription service, typically used by celebrities and porn stars to sell X-rated content.</p>

<p>She said: 'I already post pictures on Instagram so I thought why not get paid for it? I don't regret it. I don't do anything nude or too sexy. I still want to get married in the future and I don't do anything to jeopardise anything.'</p>

<p>Ahem: Lauren Goodger has discussed her OnlyFans account and insisted she does not let her page get too racy for fear of jeopardising future relationships</p>

<p>In July, Lauren revealed that she had opened an account on the X-rated subscription service, two years after floating the idea of signing up. At the time she revealed that she is charging $50 a month for access.</p>

<p>Sharing a snap of herself pouting as she posed for a close-up selfie, the erstwhile reality star wrote: 'I’ve given in! To all my fans who want to see me on only fans the time is now... subscribe #dailycontent.'</p>

<p>As she was probed about the account by the panel, Lauren said: 'It was started by a guy in Essex which was later bought by a guy in America...</p>

<p>'I judged it for two years and they tried to get me on. I already post pictures on Instagram so I thought why not get paid for it? I don't regret it...</p>

<p>'I don't do anything nude or too sexy. I still want to get married in the future and I don't do anything to jeopardise anything.'</p>

<p>Lauren also discussed her absence from the recent TOWIE 10th anniversary show. </p>

<p>She said: 'I wasn't available that day and it was more about people currently on the show. I have a lot of love for it but I've been there and done that. I put out a social media shout-out and will always support it...</p>

<p>'It's where I started. It was strange and weird as there weren't any other reality shows. I left the show 7/8 years ago and I'm still very current. I've experienced such great things that I wouldn't have had without it.' </p>
