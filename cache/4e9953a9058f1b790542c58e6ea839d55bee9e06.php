<p>The Community Fridge Network, run by environmental charity Hubbub, supports community fridges across the UK to share good food from local businesses and individuals that would have otherwise gone to waste</p>

<p>The organisation aims to support people in their efforts to create communities, such as championing a sustainable approach to how we live our lives and build our homes to teaching traditional arts and skills.</p>

<p>As well as his cream coat, the white haired Prince wore dark grey suit trousers and pair of shiny brown formal shoes. </p>

<p>His appearance comes just days after Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle , 39, announced that they had totally refunded the Sovereign Grant for the redevelopment of five-bedroom Frogmore Cottage on the Queen's Berkshire estate. </p>

<p>The couple, who had been paying back the cash in monthly instalments, were said to be 'very relieved and very pleased' to have been able to pay off the debt so quickly,' a source close to the couple told Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl. </p>

<p>'This has been a pro-active step and something they wanted to do from the outset.</p>

<p>'There was no requirement [from the Queen] for them to pay the money back but it was important to them that they did, and after the Netflix deal they were in a position to do so. I think this is quite a significant moment for them.'</p>

<p>It was revealed in the wake of the couple's decision to step back from their royal roles and to live in America that the Prince of Wales would make a private financial contribution to help them during their first year away. </p>

<p>It is believed the total amount was around £1million.</p>
