<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Earth may have lost as much as 60 per cent of its atmosphere in a collision with another young planet that created the Moon, a new study revealed. </p>

<p>New research led by Durham University involved more than 300 supercomputer simulations designed to show the consequence of a huge collision on the planet. </p>

<p>Their findings have led to the development of a new way to predict the atmospheric loss from any collision across a wide range of rocky planet impacts.</p>

<p>These could be used by scientists investigating the Moon's origins or other giant impacts both in our own solar system and on rocky exoplanets light years away.  </p>

<p>New research led by Durham University involved more than 300 supercomputer simulations designed to show the consequence of a huge collision on the planet. This is a cross section of a 3D simulation involving two young planets colliding into one another</p>

<p>Their findings have led to the development of a new way to predict the atmospheric loss from any collision across a wide range of rocky planet impacts. The simulations incorporate different materials, density and impact angles</p>

<p>The Moon is believed to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago following a collision between the early Earth and a giant impactor possibly the size of Mars.</p>

<p>Lead author Dr Jacob Kegerreis, in the Institute for Computational Cosmology, Durham University, said scientists are working hard to unravel the mystery.</p>

<p>'We ran hundreds of different scenarios for many different colliding planets, showing the varying impacts and effects on a planet's atmosphere depending upon a number of factors such as the angle, speed of impact or the sizes of the planets.'</p>

<p>The simulations can't directly say how the Moon came to be, but they could show the effects a giant collision had on the Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>This 'could be used to narrow down the different ways it might have been formed and lead us closer to understanding the origin of our nearest celestial neighbour.'</p>

<p>Earlier this year, an initial study by Durham University reported that giant impacts which dominate the late stages of planet formation can have a wide range of consequences for young planets and their atmospheres. </p>

<p>That study examined the ways that a planet's atmospheres could be changed by objects impacting at different angles, mass, size and speeds.  </p>

<p>Simulations revealed Earth could have lost anywhere between 10-60 per cent of its atmosphere in the collision where the Moon came into existence.</p>

<p>The researchers say the findings also provide a new way to predict the atmospheric loss from other rocky planets that have been involved in collision. </p>

<p>It can go the other way, authors found a slow giant impact between two objects with a lot of atmosphere could add significant atmosphere to both worlds. </p>

<p>This latest paper looks at the effects across a much wider variety of impacts adjusting for size, mass, speed and angle of the impacting object. </p>

<p>The simulations can't directly say how the Moon came to be, but they could show the effects a giant collision had on the Earth's atmosphere</p>

<p>They also changed the density of the impactor and whether it was made of iron, rock or both as part of the new study.</p>

<p>The simulations revealed the different outcomes when one or more of these variables are changed, leading to atmospheric loss or gain or sometimes the complete obliteration of the impacted planet. </p>

<p>Co-author Dr Luis Teodoro, in the School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, said: 'This major suite of planetary simulations also sheds light on the role of impacts in the evolution of Earth-like exoplanets.'</p>

<p>The high-resolution simulations were run using the SWIFT open-source simulation code. They were carried out on the COSMA supercomputer, part of the DiRAC High-Performance Computing facility in Durham.</p>

<p>The findings are published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

<p>Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago.</p>

<p>This is called the giant impact hypothesis.</p>

<p>The theory suggests the moon is made up of debris left over following a collision between our planet and a body around 4.5 billion years ago.</p>

<p>The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the moon.</p>

<p>Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis</p>

<p>But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon: Why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition?</p>

<p>Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon.</p>

<p>Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon.</p>

<p>Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been chemically similar to young Earth.</p>

<p>A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact.</p>
