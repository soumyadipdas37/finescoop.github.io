<p>Production of the highbrow film - which is set during the COVID-19 shutdown and asks the question 'Can pornography be art?' - began in Los Angeles back in July. </p>

<p>At the time, the city was seeing a dramatic surge in coronavirus cases, making Ward apprehensive about the prospect of getting hot and heavy on camera.  </p>

<p>Former Boy Meets World star Maitland Ward has revealed how she managed to film a feature-length porn movie during the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Ward (center top)  starred in two seasons of the  beloved ABC/ Disney sitcom Boy Meets World from 1998 - 2000</p>

<p>'At first, I have to admit, I was a little skeptical. How would this all work? Would the cast and crew be able to remain safe and healthy for a span of days and weeks?' she writes in her essay. </p>

<p>'But any trepidation I had quickly left me when I saw the time and effort put in to insure this production would run smoothly and safely.'</p>

<p>Ward goes on to reveal that cast and crew received COVID tests every single morning, regardless of whether or not they were required to be on set. </p>

<p>The rapid tests were usually returned within 24 hours, giving all employees peace of mind. </p>

<p>The porn production house also hired an EMT, and temperatures were checked frequently and at random. </p>

<p>Production of the raunchy film, Muse, began in Los Angeles back in July</p>

<p>Additionally, 'disinfecting, and distancing were enforced, [and] only performers in scenes could take their masks off.' </p>

<p>The former sitcom star even claimed that there was an unexpected benefit to shooting the sizzling feature in the midst of the pandemic. </p>

<p>Ward has been abstaining from sexual relations in her person life due to anxiety about spreading and contracting the coronavirus - but the safety of the set gave her a place to let loose without having to worry about anyone being infected. </p>

<p>'I had missed random human contact so much I think I mauled my first scene partner, but he didn’t seem to mind,' she cheekily writes.  </p>

<p>Ward further states that the procedures put in place on the set of the film could also be applied during production of mainstream Hollywood movies.</p>

<p>'The shoot went so well, the film has now been turned into a series that will span several seasons, while mainstream doesn’t know when any of its shows can film again at all,' she boasts. </p>

<p>The redheaded actress is best known for her role as Rachel McGuire on Boy Meets World. </p>

<p>She starred in two seasons of the classic ABC/ Disney sitcom from 1998 - 2000. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Ward wrote about her transition to the world of adult entertainment in a separate essay for The Daily Beast.</p>

<p>Ward says she is now making far more money as a porn star than she ever did working for the Disney Channel show and is proud of her career move. </p>

<p>'Many expected my rise in the adult world, including many in the adult world itself, to be a flash in the pan. It was a stunt. I wasn't serious. But that's what makes this story different: my genuine love for adult performance and for colorful cinema,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'My story is a journey rather than a cautionary tale. And I'm ready to prove the naysayers wrong.'</p>
