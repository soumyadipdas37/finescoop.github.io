<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Erika Jayne appears to be giving Lisa Rinna a well-earned rest when it comes to sparring with Denise Richards.</p>

<p>In the latest teaser for the virtual reunion of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Erika, 49, gets heated with the Wild Things actress, as they once again talk about who said what at Denise's barbecue. </p>

<p>The clip is from the latest episode that will be shown tomorrow night, and once again they're discussing how Denise, 49, is just as potty mouthed as the rest of the cast, after she brought up the claim that her husband Aaron Phypers, 47, has a big penis. </p>

<p>'Motherf***er I'm out': Erika Jayne has a VERY tense row with Denise Richards over barbecue incident... in latest Real Housewives of Beverly Hills teaser</p>

<p>'You opened with, "He still has a big penis." That was, like, the first thing out of your mouth at your own barbecue with your own children sitting right there,' Erika began, adding: 'It comes out of your mouth first. You set the tone.'</p>

<p>Teddi Mellencamp then put her two cents in, as she added: 'I think the part that's frustrating is your inability to say, 'You know what, yeah, I was kind of trying to make you look like a**holes and that's why I kept joking about it.'</p>

<p>However, Teddi, 39, was met with a chorus of disagreement, as Dorit Kemsley and Garcelle Beauvais both defended Denise, while Lisa just stayed silent.  </p>

<p>Awkward: Denise was shown a clip her saying that her husband Aaron Phypers has a big penis, despite her accuses the other ladies of being potty mouthed</p>

<p>A night to remember: The group are still discussing the infamous barbecue incident </p>

<p>However, Andy Cohen then asks how it made Erika feel, which is when things got really awkward. </p>

<p>Erika explained to Denise: 'It was the perfect set up. We had our table, their table. We always have adult conversations, that's what we do as a group and then all of a sudden we're penalized for that, for having a conversation when your children are yards anyways.'</p>

<p>Although Denise tries to cut in with her side of the story, Erika finishes her rant.  </p>

<p>Woah there! Erika had enough of listening to Denise as she gave her side of the story</p>

<p>Going at it: This time around it was Erika's turn to spar with Denise</p>

<p>If looks could kill: Denise appeared to be particularly unimpressed with Erika's rant</p>

<p>Staying out of it: For once, Lisa Rinna had nothing to say in this particular clip</p>

<p>They've got your back: Dorit Kemsley and Garcelle Beauvais both defended Denise, while Lisa just stayed silent</p>

<p>'I was OK with being singled out, because I knew I was being singled out. I took it on the chin, I apologized sincerely,' she said. </p>

<p>'Then I find out, you take it to Teddi and to Sutton. Motherf*<strong>er i'm out, that's bulls</strong>t.'</p>

<p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reunion airs on Bravo Wednesday, September 2, at 9 p.m. ET. </p>
