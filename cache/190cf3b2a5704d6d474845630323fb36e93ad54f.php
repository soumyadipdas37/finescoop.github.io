<p>Plague doctors costumes are selling out at fancy dress stores as they are tipped to be one of the most popular Halloween costumes this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Medieval plague doctor outfits with long black robes, black tops hats, gloves and the distinctive beak masks are already sold out on some online stores.</p>

<p>They also carried a rod to poke or fend off victims.</p>

<p>Britain today recorded 7,108 more coronavirus cases and another 71 deaths — including a three-month high of seven in Scotland.</p>

<p>Daily infections are up 15 per cent on last Wednesday's 6,178 and almost 80 per cent higher than on Wednesday two weeks ago.</p>

<p>But Britain's infections are a far-cry from what they were during the darkest days of the crisis in March and April, when at least 100,000 people were becoming infected every day.</p>

<p>The Department of Health data also adds to evidence that the death count is now slowly starting to climb after weeks of surging infections.</p>

<p>For comparison, the number of victims announced today is almost double that of last Wednesday (37) and more than triple the figure a fortnight ago (20).</p>

<p>There have been more than 40,000 coronavirus related deaths in the UK so far. </p>

<p>A medium has blasted Poundland as being 'utterly irresponsible' for flogging ouija boards for Halloween.</p>

<p>Clairvoyant Julie Tetley claims the devices can 'destroy people's lives' and 'spirits can cause suicides'.</p>

<p>She fears she will be 'busy in the next couple of months' dealing with the fall-out from people dabbling in the dark arts by inadvertently summoning sinister spirits using the £1 prop.</p>

<p>Poundland is selling its Spirit Board for £1 nationwide as part of its 'Creepy Town' Halloween displays</p>

<p>The 64-year-old medium was horrified to discover the boards, a firm favourite in horror movies, were being sold as a Halloween decoration in the Scarborough branch of the store.</p>

<p>Although Julie accepts the board is merely a tool, she says it encourages people to 'open up their energies' and communicate with spirits - some more 'sinister' than others.</p>

<p>She claimed people should leave the so-called 'game' well alone as she believes the evil spirits can lead to suicides among those they 'attach' to.</p>

<p>Clairvoyant Julie Tetley, 64, claims the devices can 'destroy people's lives'</p>

<p>Poundland is selling its Spirit Board for £1 nationwide as part of its 'Creepy Town' Halloween displays. </p>

<p>Sale of the product is restricted to over 18s and the product is labelled 'for adults only'.</p>

<p>Julie, from Scarborough, said: 'It's totally and utterly irresponsible for Poundland to be selling this, it's horrendous.</p>

<p>'Children will buy them, they just want fun. They see it on TV, they don't understand what they're doing, it can destroy their lives in every way.</p>

<p>'It can bring negative influences around you all the time. They need to know the intent of using these boards is to speak to the spirit.</p>

<p>'Sometimes people say 'this board doesn't work, it hasn't moved' but they've already opened up that channel to spirits, then they'll know about it later.'</p>

<p>A medium all her life, Julie said that those untrained in energies may find themselves at the mercy of 'unscrupulous' characters looking to take advantage of them.</p>

<p>Julie said: 'You get people who were unscrupulous, people who would take advantage and people who were very very sinister here and you get the same in spirits.</p>

<p>Poundland said the sale of the product is restricted to over 18s and the product is labelled 'for adults only' (Pictured: stock image of Poundland store)</p>

<p>'Their personality is still who they are [in spirit form].</p>

<p>'If a darker energy attaches itself to someone who's naive they can just take advantage - they can cause stress and worry.</p>

<p>'They'll give them information that's right then all of a sudden this board will spell out something like there's going to be a fatal accident or one of your parents is going to be killed.</p>

<p>'They'll say something horrendous and have that person worried because the other things they've given have been true.</p>

<p>'It can cause a lot of stress, the spirit can start to manipulate through their mind - giving them bad thoughts and giving them thoughts of suicidal tendencies.</p>

<p>'It can almost cause suicide in the long-term so it's very, very dangerous.'</p>

<p>A Poundland spokesman said: 'Poundland is the home for Halloween and the Spirit Board is part of this year's extensive Halloween Decoration range.</p>

<p>'We understand the spirits shook in disbelief when they were told it was only £1. Just wait until people see the Voodoo dolls.'</p>
