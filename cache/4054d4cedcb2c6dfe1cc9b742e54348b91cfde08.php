<p>The woman posted in an Australian cleaning group on Facebook, detailing how she coated her grease-riddled glass with Fairy 'Easy Spray' while the oven was still warm, left it to soak for 10 minutes then wiped it with a soft non-scratch sponge.</p>

<p>Photos prove the stains lifted off easily, leaving the door crystal clear with just a few spritzes of the $7.50 spray that's available in leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.</p>

<p>She said the results left her 'lost for words' and vowed never to waste money on heavy-duty cleaning products again.</p>

<p>An Australian mother used $7.50 Fairy 'Easy Spray' to transform the glass of her oven door from grimy (left) to gleaming (right), without breathing in toxic fumes emitted from chemical cleaners</p>

<p>The photos have drawn delighted responses since they were shared on Friday, with comments including 'that's awesome', 'looks amazing' and 'I'm hunting this down tomorrow'.</p>

<p>One woman revealed how she gets more than her money's worth from the spray.</p>

<p>'It's quite expensive, so when my bottle is nearly empty I put in a squirt of dish detergent and a squirt of rinse aid, top it up with water and it seems to work just the same. Cheap refill,' she said.</p>

<p>It's the latest kitchen cleaning hack to grab attention on social media, following a mother's remarkable restoration of a vintage oven to near perfect condition with budget supermarket sprays and a simple solution of lemon and baking soda</p>

<p>The woman said the results of the $7.50 spray (pictured) left her 'lost for words' and vowed never to waste money on other oven cleaning products again</p>

<p>Posting anonymously in a community group on Facebook, the woman revealed she had inherited the oven from her partner's grandmother and became determined to return it to its original glory before moving into their new home in October.</p>

<p>Photos illustrate the impressive result of her efforts, which have transformed the squalid interior of the appliance to a sparkling clean, usable condition.</p>

<p>First, she wiped $8.45 Oven Power cleaner over the filthy racks, then rubbed baking soda and lemon juice on the grease-stained glass - but her homemade mixture only lifted the first layer of build-up.</p>

<p>Undeterred, she sprayed $3.50 Easy-Off 'Bam' cleaner onto the glass which removed 'a fair bit' of dirt.</p>

<p>That left the grease stuck to the roof of the oven and 'a few stubborn spots' on the walls and base that haven't budged, despite vigorous scrubbing.</p>

<p>After inheriting the dirt-encrusted vintage oven (pictured left) from her partner's grandmother, the woman restored it to almost perfect condition (right) with supermarket sprays and a simple solution of lemon and baking soda</p>

<p>Alone, lemon and baking soda have many benefits.</p>

<p>Lemon is a potent antibacterial and its fresh, citrus scent leaves a clean smell without the toxic fumes found in commercial cleaning products. </p>

<p>Baking soda is a drawing agent that pulls out stains and odours as well as being a natural grit that provides friction for scrubbing.</p>

<p>Together, they make a powerful solution perfect for lifting stains and killing germs in the kitchen and bathroom. </p>

<p>The mother said she hopes a third and final clean will restore the oven to functional condition, and asked for advice on scouring off the remaining stains.</p>

<p>Many recommended dissolving a dishwasher tablet in warm water and scrubbing the solution inside the oven with a damp cloth.</p>

<p>Other suggestions included the $8 all-purpose cleaner 'Bar Keepers Friend' and $3 Magic Eraser, a spot cleaner that's gained cult status in Australia in recent years.</p>

<p>'Make a paste with Bar Keepers Friend and water. I heat the oven up to 120°C for half an hour, then layer the paste on and let it sit until the oven cools down,' one woman said. 'A little scrub and everything comes off very easily. It's great!'</p>

<p>Another had three words to offer: 'Hire a professional.'</p>
