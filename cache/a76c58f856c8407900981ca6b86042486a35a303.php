<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dominic Raab accused the EU of 'double standards' today as he warned that the UK will walk away from post-Brexit trade talks rather than back down.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary said a deal was 'there for the taking', but insisted Brussels must recognise that discussions this week are a 'moment of reckoning'.</p>

<p>He pledged that the government will not 'haggle away' fishing rights or agree to be bound by EU rules just to get an agreement across the line.</p>

<p>The tough stance came after the UK's chief negotiator Lord Frost cautioned counterpart Michel Barnier that the UK will not 'blink' this time, unlike when Theresa May was in No10. </p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Lord Frost said there was no prospect of forcing Britain to become a 'client state' of Brussels. </p>

<p>The comments will heighten gloom about a breakthrough, with Downing Street insiders now putting the chance of an agreement at just 30-40 per cent. </p>

<p>Speaking to Sky News this morning, Mr Raab said the government wanted to strike a deal with the EU, but it could not be based on 'double standards'. </p>

<p>Foreign Secretary said a deal was 'there for the taking', but insisted Brussels must recognise that discussions this week are a 'moment of reckoning'</p>

<p>The tough stance came after the UK's chief negotiator Lord Frost (pictured left at a previous round of talks in Brussels) cautioned counterpart Michel Barnier (right) that the UK will not 'blink' this time, unlike when Theresa May was in No10</p>

<p>'All the UK is asking for it to be treated like any other country in free trade negotiations,' he said. </p>

<p>'No other country would accept being bound by or controlled by the EU's rules.'</p>

<p>Mr Raab said there were 'really only two bones of contention left' - on fishing rights and whether the UK had to bow to Brussels edicts.</p>

<p>'We hope that the EU as a whole will really understand that this week is the moment of reckoning,' Mr Raab said. </p>

<p>'There is a deal to be done. We are only asking to be treated just as the EU would expect.</p>

<p>'We can't allow, as we leave the EU, for the EU to control our rules.'</p>

<p>He added: 'The only question is why we should be treated with such double standards.' </p>

<p>'There is a good deal there for the EU, we'd love to do that free trade agreement and if not we'll fall back on Australian-style rules.</p>

<p>'I think this week is an important moment for the EU to really effectively recognise that those two point of principles are not something we can just haggle away – they are the very reasons we are leaving the EU, but we want a positive relationship and the arm of friendship and goodwill is extended.'</p>

<p>Mr Barnier is due to arrive in London for the crunch round of talks on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The two sides have just weeks to finalise any legally binding agreement that needs to be in force by December 31 if a No Deal Brexit is to be avoided.</p>

<p>In the interview – his first since being appointed in January – Lord Frost said the EU needed to realise that Mr Johnson's Government was adopting a more steely and determined approach than Mrs May's.</p>

<p>He said: 'We came in after a Government and negotiating team that had blinked and had its bluff called at critical moments and the EU had learned not to take our word seriously.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson, pictured on a visit to an HS2 site in Solihull on Friday, has insisted he will not compromise sovereignty to get a deal</p>

<p>'So a lot of what we are trying to do this year is to get them to realise that we mean what we say and they should take our position seriously.'</p>

<p>To demonstrate the Government's readiness to accept No Deal, the Prime Minister has created a No 10 Transition Hub, with officials across key departments said to be 'working at pace' to prepare to trade without arrangements in place. </p>

<p>The unit, boasting 'handpicked' officials from across Whitehall, will work with Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who has led the Government's work on No Deal preparations since last year.</p>

<p>Lord Frost's remarks drew immediate anger from allies of Mrs May. </p>

<p>Gavin Barwell, who was chief of staff in No10, tweeted that the peer had 'some brass neck'.</p>

<p>'Given the Withdrawal Agreement &amp; Political Declaration David Frost negotiated last autumn were 95% the work of his predecessors - and the 5% that was new involved giving in to the EU's key demand (for some customs processes when goods move GB to NI) - that quote's some brass neck,' he wrote. </p>
