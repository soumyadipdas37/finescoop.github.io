<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Erling Haaland is under more pressure at Borussia Dortmund than Robert Lewandowski ever was, according to club legend Sebastian Kehl. </p>

<p>Norway international Haaland struggled as Dortmund lost at Augsburg at the weekend in a rare low for the youngster who scored 16 goals in 18 games across all competitions last season. </p>

<p>Haaland's blistering start following his January switch from Red Bull Salzburg often saw the 20-year-old compared to Lewandowski, who starred for Dortmund before moving to Bayern Munich in 2014.  </p>

<p>Erling Haaland  is often compared to predecessor at Westfalenstadion Robert Lewandoski</p>

<p>Lewandoski played for Dortmund between 2010 and 2014, making 173 appearances</p>

<p>But Kehl, a former Dortmund captain, said: 'Lewy came to us as a great talent at the time. Haaland, on the other hand, already arrived in Dortmund at a very high level – and with a very different reputation than Lewandowski did at the time.</p>

<p>'We had been waiting for a player like him [Haaland]. The hopes placed in him were accordingly immediately high.'</p>

<p>Lewandowski arrived in Dortmund in 2010 and had to battle with Lucas Barrios for a start after his transfer from Lech Poznan.</p>

<p>Haaland struggled to make an impact during Dortmund's 2-0 defeat to Augsburg on Saturday</p>

<p>Former skipper Sebastian Kehl made 247 appearances for Dortmund between 2002 and 2015</p>

<p>'For Lewandowski, the 2010-11 season was not easy. He and Barrios didn't always get along well. Lewy had to fight for his place and prevail,' said Kehl. </p>

<p>'Lewy is so consistent, so complete, almost never injured – for me he is one of the best in the world. A great player.'</p>

<p>Lewandowski went on to score 103 goals in 173 appearances before joining Bayern Munich in 2014.</p>
