<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thomas Cook is to rise from the ashes of the coronavirus crisis as a Chinese-owned online holiday business.</p>

<p>While the sector has been ravaged by travel bans, the company founded 178 years ago has been bought by the Chinese company Fosun Tourism Group following its collapse last September.</p>

<p>It has been licensed by the Civil Aviation Authority and carries Atol protection for the holidays it will sell via the Thomas Cook website.</p>

<p>Thomas Cook, which was founded 178 years ago, has been bought by the Chinese company Fosun Tourism Group following its collapse last September</p>

<p>Initially, it will sell holidays to beach destinations and cities in countries including Italy, Greece and Turkey, that are not covered by travel controls or a need for people to quarantine on return. </p>

<p>Customers will be able to choose from room-only to all-inclusive options. A family of four can stay for a week outside Bodrum in October for £1,250, flying from Liverpool.</p>

<p>Thomas Cook UK's chief executive, Alan French, said: 'We have reinvented one of the most recognisable names in British travel.</p>

<p>'We know Brits are keen to travel but feel nervous about safety and changes to Government rules on quarantine.</p>

<p>We are only selling destinations on the travel corridor list and all hotels are flexible.</p>

<p>We also won't charge customers a fee to swap their holidays if rules change.'</p>

<p>Jim Qian, chairman and chief executive of Fosun, which also owns Club Med, said: 'Supporting the growth of the brand in China and its relaunch in the UK is a big step in our plan to turn Thomas Cook into a global success story.'</p>

<p>The editor of Which? Travel, Rory Boland, was cautious, saying: 'While some previous Thomas Cook customers may be pleased to see it relaunching, the events of the past few months should act as a reminder that just because a brand is a household name does not mean you can rely on it to treat you fairly.'</p>
