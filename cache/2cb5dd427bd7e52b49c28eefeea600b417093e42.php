<p>'It was pretty deep, but there [weren't] a lot of waves and Kim kind of, like, threw a tantrum immediately when she found out that she lost it and I was like, "No. This is fine!"' Kylie said.</p>

<p>'I went under there and it was saltwater so it kind of hurt to open my eyes, but I just opened my eyes and looked around and I saw something shining.</p>

<p>However, even after retrieving the precious goods, Kim still wasn't entirely satisfied.</p>

<p>'Then [Kim] was like, "You know, I don't have my backing but it's fine. I can always get that." And I was like, I'm just gonna look! So I went back down and I found the backing. I found the earring backing!' </p>
