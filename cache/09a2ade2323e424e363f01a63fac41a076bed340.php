<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A hungry squirrel was spotted straying from its normal herbivorous diet in Florida, deciding to binge on a McDonald's cheeseburger instead.</p>

<p>Jamie Walton, 36, filmed the plump rodent casually chewing on its unusual choice of snack near the golden arches in Venice, Florida.</p>

<p>Video footage shows the squirrel sitting down on the floor to enjoy its McDonald's cheeseburger, which is almost the same width as the chunky rodent.</p>

<p>The grey squirrel furiously chomps down its tasty snack, unaware that its delicious lunch is being caught on camera. </p>

<p>A squirrel was spotted feasting on a McDonald's cheeseburger near the golden arches in Venice, Florida, hilarious video footage shows</p>

<p>Ms Walton, who took the video, said: 'I pulled into a parking space and it was a few feet from my door. There is a McDonald's adjacent to the parking lot.</p>

<p>'I thought it was funny and people have found it amusing.'</p>

<p>She shared her hilarious video on Reddit, where it was upvoted thousands of times  and attracted hundreds of comments from surprised viewers.  </p>

<p>'I love the way it's sat like it's having a picnic,' wrote one viewer.</p>

<p>Another said: 'I think I've found my spirit animal.'</p>

<p>Some viewers were baffled to see a squirrel, which typically enjoys a nutritious diet of nuts, seeds and fruit, feasting on the junk food. </p>

<p>The top comment was 'I didn't know that squirrels ate meat.' </p>

<p>A grey squirrel's diet is typically herbivorous, but some squirrels will eat meat when faced with hunger.</p>

<p>The rodent has been known to eat small birds, young snakes and smaller rodents, plus bird eggs and insects.</p>

<p>Jamie Walton, 36, filmed the plump rodent, which normally diet on seeds and nuts, casually chomping down its unusual choice of snack</p>

<p>In fact, some tropical species have shifted almost entirely to a diet of insects. </p>

<p>But Ms Walton was not surprised by the squirrel's choice of snack, adding that the many rodents in Florida 'eat anything available'.</p>

<p>Numerous viewers even thought that the portly squirrel was an expectant female, despite the rodents normally delivering their young between March and April, and July and August.</p>

<p>Ms Walton said: 'There have been many comments saying the squirrel is pregnant. It is not typical for them to give birth this time of year, but I am not an expert.'</p>

<p>A squirrel was recently spotted by biologist Jeff Nordland, from San Diego, California, eating a lizard in south-east Arizona.</p>

<p>He believed the hungry creature was a rock squirrel and its meal was a Clark's spiny lizard, proving that the adorable rodents are not always herbivorous.</p>

<p>How the squirrel managed to capture the lizard remains a mystery, but the biologist suspects that the rodent scavenged it off the road.</p>

<p>And it is not the first time that an animal's surprising fondness for fast food has stunned the public.</p>

<p>In May, a lizard that had binged on pizza grease was seen horrifically bloated in Cocoa Beach, Florida, because it was unable to digest the sand that had got into its food. </p>

<p>By the time it was discovered, faeces were found to make up 80 per cent of its body mass.</p>

<p>Herpetologist Natalie Claunch said: 'To our knowledge, this represents the largest faeces-to-body-mass ratio recorded in a living animal.'</p>

<p>The burger-loving squirrel has no doubt given the famous 'pizza rat' from 2015 a run for its money.</p>

<p>The vermin became internet-famous after a video did the rounds, showing the long-tailed rodent trying to carry a large pizza slice down the subway steps in Manhattan. </p>

<p>The 'pizza rat' picked up a staggering 11million views on YouTube since its original sighting. </p>

<p>Many other rodents, including a groundhog and other squirrels, have since been compared to the well-known rat when they have been spotted chomping down various junk foods.</p>
