<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tory Lanez appeared to use the drama surrounding the shocking shooting of fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion, 25, to hype up release of his new album Daystar.</p>

<p>'There is a time to stay silent . And a time to speak ..... I said all I could say on this ... ALL PLATFORMS ... ..... #DAYSTAR ... I’ll be back to y’all soon .... respectfully .....' wrote the 28-year-old, who released the album on all streaming platforms Thursday night.</p>

<p>The first thirty-seconds of the album's premiere song Money Over Fallouts features a compilation of audio clips taken directly from news reports regarding the July 12 shooting where Megan was allegedly shot twice in the foot by Lanez. </p>

<p>'How the f**k you get shot in your foot but don't hit no bones or tendons?' raps Lanez at one point, as he appears to question the validity of Megan's injuries.</p>

<p>Yikes: Tory Lanez appeared to use the drama surrounding the shocking shooting of fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion to release his new album Daystar</p>

<p>He then went on to claim that he was 'framed' for the shooting as he raps: 'Megan's people trynna frame me for a shooting, but them boys ain't cleanin' up.' </p>

<p>Tory then directly calls out Megan for a statement she issued to Instagram on July 15, where revealed that 'a crime was committed against [her] and done with the intention to harm [her].'</p>

<p>'Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement,' he raps. 'Knowin' I ain't do it, but I'm comin' out my truest / Trynna keep this sh*t 200 with you, Shawty.' </p>

<p>He continues: 'I know I ain't do it, but they people in your ear, they're the ones that I fear / Do you think Tory Lanez would do you in for real?'</p>

<p>In a series of more emotionally-charged lyrics, Lanez begs Megan to 'look at how [she] doing [him]' as he seems to suggest they were linked romantically. </p>

<p>Low blow: 'There is a time to stay silent . And a time to speak ..... I said all I could say on this ... ALL PLATFORMS ... ..... #DAYSTAR ... I’ll be back to y’all soon .... respectfully .....' wrote the 28-year-old, who released the album on all streaming platforms Thursday night; Lanez pictured in 2018</p>

<p>Tory, maintaining his innocence, offers to 'renegotiate the unity' with Megan, despite lambasting her actions and claiming her allegations are fabricated.</p>

<p>Abruptly flipping the script, Tory poses the question: 'How the f*ck your team is trynna play me as some whole menace?'</p>

<p>Upon the song's close, Lanez claimed that all of the negative press from the shooting made him lose out on '$10million.' </p>

<p>In another song on Daystar titled Friends Become Strangers, Tory references to a string of text messages between him and Megan that were leaked to TMZ earlier this month. </p>

<p>'We both know what happened that night and what I did,' he raps at one point. </p>

<p>Aside from using the shooting for content, Lanez also took shots at fellow rapper Dream Doll by claiming the 27-year-old had 'no hits.'</p>

<p>Dream Doll, born Tabatha Robinson, quickly took to her Instagram Story to address the weak diss.</p>

<p>'You been a dub! Since you came for me the first time!. Sadly you could try n diss me again for not having a hit but yet my biggest record was exposing your corny a** til this day,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'Always coming for females but keep digging your hole Dayster Peterson you f**king lame !!!!!' </p>

<p>Not happy: So, when fans, eager to hear Lanez's side of the story, learned that all the online hoopla was for an album announcement, they were NOT pleased</p>

<p>No way: 'Wtf we want the damn story TORY, NOT PUTTING NO MONEY IN YOUR POCKETS,' wrote one commenter who was clearly angered by the rapper's odd promo tactics</p>

<p>She then uploaded various screenshots that featured messages from Tory that revealed the rapper's true - and much less hostile - feelings towards Dream Doll.</p>

<p>'I know that we don't talk to each other anymore, but I want to let u know that I'm proud of u for taking your craft seriously and not stopping,' read one message.</p>

<p>Another showed Lanez inviting Dream Doll to his birthday party in Miami last year.</p>

<p>'It's Tory. If ur in miami u should come to my b day party tonight,' he wrote, before sending the official party flyer her way.   </p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Lanez, who had ever spoken publicly about the shooting, alluded to the incident in a tweet where he apologized 'for [his] silence' on the matter and encouraged fans to return to his social media platforms at '9PM PST' for further explanation.</p>

<p>Fooled: A plethora of commenters felt as if they had been 'fooled' by the Shooters rapper and voiced their discontent in the comments</p>

<p>Back to bed: Although most were offended by Lanez shamelessly dangling in the Megan drama in their face, there were quite a few East Coast commenters that were more annoyed with the fact that they 'stayed up for clickbait'</p>

<p>So, when fans, eager to hear Lanez's side of the story, learned that all the online hoopla was for an album release, they were NOT pleased and immediately took to the rapper's comment section.</p>

<p>'Wtf we want the damn story TORY, NOT PUTTING NO MONEY IN YOUR POCKETS,' wrote one commenter who was clearly angered by the rapper's odd promo tactics.</p>

<p>A plethora of commenters felt as if they had been 'fooled' by the Shooters rapper and voiced their discontent in the comments.  </p>

<p>Many accused Lanez of attempting to '[profit] off shooting an unarmed black woman,' as if he hoped the drama would inflate future album sales.</p>

<p>One commenter directly confronted Tory's blind supporters by asking them point black if they were 'actually [going to] listen to him when he shot a female?'</p>

<p>Oh no he did not: Aside from using the shooting for content, Lanez also took shots at fellow rapper Dream Doll by claiming the 27-year-old had 'no hits'</p>

<p>Speaking up: Dream Doll, born Tabatha Robinson, quickly took to her Instagram Story to address the weak diss</p>

<p>The most ruthless comment of all read: 'Are the proceeds going towards victims of domestic violence and gun violence?'</p>

<p>Although most were offended by Lanez shamelessly dangling in the Megan drama in their face, there were quite a few East Coast commenters that were more annoyed with the fact that they 'stayed up for clickbait.'</p>

<p>'We should have minded out business. It's bed time,' read one of Tory's many Instagram comments, followed by a face-palm emoji. </p>

<p>Lanez's tasteless announcement on Thursday comes less than a month after TMZ published a series of apologetic messages allegedly made by him to Megan regarding the incident.</p>

<p>While the Canadian rapper never specifically mentioned the shooting or a gun, he acknowledged Megan would probably 'never' speak to him again. </p>

<p>The texts: Lanez's tasteless announcement on Thursday comes less than a month after TMZ published a series of apologetic messages allegedly made by him to Megan regarding the incident; Megan pictured in 2019 </p>

<p>'I genuinely want u to know I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart,' the performer wrote to her after the July incident, according to the outlet. 'I was just too drunk.' </p>

<p>He continued: 'None the less sh*t should have never happened and I can’t change what did. I just feel horrible.' </p>

<p>The outlet also reported the Houston-based star has not responded to his texts. </p>

<p>A source also confirmed the messages were real to Page Six, which were in reference to her claims Lanez shot her twice in the foot. </p>

<p>In August, she named him as her assailant on an Instagram Live, where she told him to stop 'lying' and defended her decision not to tell the cops, at the scene, what happened.  </p>

<p>The rap star said she thought cops would kill them if they learned there was a gun in the car and claims she made an attempt to 'spare' Lanez by holding back the truth. </p>

<p>In an Instagram Live Thursday night, Megan Thee Stallion claimed Canadian rapper Tory Lanez shot her in the foot on July 12 after they had an argument and she tried to leave the ca</p>

<p>Yet, Hot Girl Meg said she was now 'tired' of the rumors being spread by Lanez' team, telling her followers 'stop acting like black women is the m***********g problem.' </p>

<p>Her Instagram Story, which occurred more than a month later, was the first time she directly used Lanez' name to accuse him of being the shooter.  </p>

<p>'I'm not gonna let you all keep playing in my face and I'm not going to let this n**** keep playing in my face either,' she began. </p>

<p>'Since you're all so worried about it, yes, this n**** Tory shot me.</p>

<p>'You shot me and you got got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying and s**t. Stop lying. Why lie.' </p>

<p>Opening up: Her Instagram Story, which occurred more than a month later, was the first time she directly used Lanez' name to accuse him of being the shooter</p>

<p>She then blasted some of the rumors circulating that she had hit him before she was shot, claiming that there was a witness who saw how she got out of the car and was walking away when Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, allegedly began shooting at her from the back seat. </p>

<p>Canadian rapper Tory Lanez, 28, ,has been accused by Megan Thee Stallion of shooting her in the foot. This is the first time she has directly named him</p>

<p>She also hit out at claims that it happened at Kylie Jenner's house, where the pair had been partying earlier that evening, saying that they were five minutes from where she was staying when she decided she had enough of an argument and tried to leave the vehicle. </p>

<p>'I get out of the car. I'm done, I don't want to argue no more,' she said. </p>

<p>'I get out, I'm walking away and this n**** from out the backseat of the car starts shooting me. You shot me. I didn't get cut by no glass but I'll tell you why they're saying that.'</p>

<p>The WAP rapper then explained why she hadn't told the cops that Lanez shot her even when she was taken to the hospital, saying it was because she 'didn't want to die.'  </p>

<p>'The police is really aggressive,' Megan claims. 'You think I'm about to tell the police that we, us black people, that we've got a gun in the car. You want me to tell them we've got a gun in the car so they can shoot all of us up.</p>

<p>'I'm scared. Why would I tell them there's a gun in the car and I got shot so you can get shot, he can get shot, she can get shot. I didn't immediately tell the police what happened right then because I didn't want to die.</p>

<p>'I didn't want the police to shoot me because there's a gun in the car.'</p>

<p>She said that the three others who were in the car with her -  her friend, Lanez and his security guard - were taken to jail, but she went to the hospital. </p>

<p>'You want me to be a bad person so bad, y'all want to believe the lie before you believe the truth,' she added. </p>

<p>'I didn't have to spare that n****, I don't have to spare nobody but I did and I'm done.'</p>

<p>She hit back at those that said she is lying but still did not name Lanez as she showed the stitches being taken out of her injuries. The rapper said she is 'tired' of the lies</p>

<p>Megan Thee Stallion posted pictures of her injuries to Instagram on Wenesday</p>

<p>She then accused Lanez of being scared to tell people that he shot her and so had his team spreading lies. </p>

<p>'Truth is you shot me. You're scared to tell people you shot me and you got your whole team on the internet lying trying to cover your a**.</p>

<p>'And I'm tired of it. Stop doing that, stop dragging me.</p>

<p>'Stop lying on me. Stop acting like black women is the m************ problem. Stop acting like black women is aggressive when all they be doing is telling the fact.' </p>

<p>TMZ had previously reported that Lanez shot Megan Thee Stallion in the foot twice after an argument on July 12 in which she and her friend attempted to get out of the SUV they were all traveling in.</p>

<p>The group left together from a house party in the Hollywood Hills in the early hours of the morning, but Megan and her friend Kelsey Nicole at some point wanted to leave the chauffeur-driven car. </p>

<p>Video footage from the incident showed Megan leaving bloody footprints on a sidewalk after police pulled over the SUV following a report that shots were fired. </p>

<p>'I got hit at the back of my feet because when I got shot I was WALKING AWAY FACING THE BACK,' the Houston native said Wwednesday. 'Why would I lie about getting shot?</p>

<p>Setting the record straight: The 25-year-old rapper took to her Instagram account in July a gew days after the incident to tell her side of the story and claimed that she was deliberately shot</p>

<p>In the video, police are seen ordering the music sensation to get out of an SUV with her friend and fellow rapper Tory. </p>

<p>As she makes her way along the concrete with her hands in the air, blood is seen coming from her feet. Tory was seen lying on the road near the side of the vehicle with his hands in the air. </p>

<p>Tory was arrested on a concealed weapons charge as he was found with a handgun under his seat and is currently out on bond after posting a $35,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in court in October.  </p>

<p>At the time of her Instagram Live, Billboard revealed that the Los Angeles District Attorney's office was still considering whether to file charges against Lanez. </p>

<p>LAPD spokesperson Richardo Santiago said they had asked law enforcement to provide a further investigation before they decide if a felony assault with a semiautomatic firearm charges  will be brought against him.  </p>

<p>Meg has been extremely vocal when speaking out against those who have promoted false rumors about what happened when she was shot after leaving the Hollywood Hills party.</p>

<p>She previously took to Instagram to share a photo of he gunshot injury on her foot. </p>

<p>'I got hit at the back of my feet because when I got shot I was WALKING AWAY FACING THE BACK,' the Houston native said. 'Why would I lie about getting shot? </p>

<p>'Why are y'all so upset that I don't wanna be in the bed sad? Why y'all upset that I can walk? I got my stitches out my feet like 2 weeks ago and I was ready to go celebrate WAP going number 1.'</p>
