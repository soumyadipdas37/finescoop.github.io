<p>The 33-year-old mother and former Victoria's Secret Angel took to YouTube on Tuesday to reveal her favourite 'clean beauty' products, which ranged from an eyeshadow palette to mascara and lip liner. </p>

<p>'When my son was born it was important to me to find products that were as non-toxic as possible. So that led me asking a lot of questions to experts, to doctors and to scientists,' she said.</p>

<p>On her quest to remove as many harmful ingredients from her makeup bag as possible Rosie stumbled upon Ere Perez' Aloe Gel Lash &amp; Brow Mascara ($33), a brand that was introduced to the public from Sydney's Bondi Beach 15 years ago. </p>

<p>'I'm very loyal to my clear eyebrow gel from Anastasia Beverly Hills because my eyebrows tend to be a little bit wiry and they move around, but this is a great clean alternative,' she said.</p>

<p>'I love the way it brushes through the eyebrow and gives a feathered look. It really does hold down throughout the day.' </p>

<p>She demonstrated its staying power by gently using the brush to lift her eyebrows upward.</p>

<p>It's a clear gel formula infused with vitamin-rich organic aloe vera, which helps to lengthen lashes, add shine and highlight the customer's lash colour</p>

<p>The product is both sweat-proof and water-resistant, meaning you can use it in the height of summer, and can be applied even around the most sensitive eyes.</p>

<p>As it's part of the clean community the brow and lash mascara is free of parabens, phthalates, propylene glycol, paraffin, lead, nanoparticles and GMOs.</p>

<p>It's sold out on the Ere Perez website - with a waitlist already begun - although international shoppers can still find it on Revolve. </p>

<p>'I use this every morning. I have thick individual brow hairs but they don't sit very thick together. This stands them all up and looks great! Not hard when it dries, still soft. Also you can use it over mascara to make it waterproof,' one happy customer wrote online.</p>

<p>'Love this. Holds all day but because it is a liquid rather than wax you need to let it set for a minute. It feels really soothing on the skin, unlike the wax varieties I've tried,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'This keeps my brows in shape and doesn't leave any yucky residue making them look super natural. I've been using it daily ever since I bought it'.</p>
