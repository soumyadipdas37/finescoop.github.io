<p>Look away now, Karl! Seven's Sunrise cemented its status this week as leader of the breakfast TV ratings war - while rival Today recorded its LOWEST numbers in six weeks. Pictured: Sunrise hosts Samantha Armytage and David Koch </p>

<p>Rubbing salt into the wound was the fact that Sunrise recorded the highest numbers in each capital city, including Brisbane, where Today previously held a victory. </p>

<p>The first week of September saw Today finally catching up to rival Sunrise.</p>

<p>Fronted by Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon, the struggling breakfast program won on the east coast.   </p>

<p>Today beat Sunrise by 195,000 to 181,000 in total people, across Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. </p>

<p>However, Sunrise was still the most-watched breakfast TV program across the five capital cities, with a viewership of 259,000 compared to Today's 229,000.     </p>

<p>A week earlier, Today had claimed victory in the east coast capitals of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, pulling a combined average audience of 191,000 - which was more than Sunrise's 189,000.</p>

<p>These figures represented a triumphant leap in the ratings for Today, which had previously dragged around 70,000 viewers behind Sunrise back in June. </p>

<p>Speaking to investors earlier this month, Channel Nine's CEO, Hugh Marks, commented on Today's progress over the past nine months.</p>

<p>'If you look at morning segments, Today show numbers are up around 10 or 15 per cent year on year and continuing to grow. Karl and Ally are doing a good job there for us,' Marks said. </p>

<p>Karl is understood to have recently signed a new contract with Nine, and Allison and the rest of the team are also locked in multi-year deals. </p>

<p>With a renewed focus on the job, Karl admitted last year that his performance wasn't great in 2018, when ratings were falling at a rapid pace and his personal life was dominating headlines.  </p>

<p>He said at the time: 'Towards the end of last year, I was cooked. It had taken its toll, a lot of the [media] attention - all the unwarranted attention I thought, and you can't control any of that.</p>

<p>'I'm not going to complain too much about that, but what it meant was that in a work capacity I don't believe for a second I was at my best. I think I was struggling towards the end of last year.'</p>
