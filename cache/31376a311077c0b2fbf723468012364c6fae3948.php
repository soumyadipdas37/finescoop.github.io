<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Ham supporters online were fuming over the weekend at the defending during their 5-3 friendly defeat at home to Championship side Bournemouth on Saturday. </p>

<p>A week before the new Premier League season, the Hammers' back-line looked all at sea on occasions as the Cherries made a mockery of their defence to score five times. </p>

<p>The woeful performance came off the back of Mark Noble's tweet on Friday night criticising the club for selling young winger Grady Diangana to West Brom for £18m, in which the captain said he was 'gutted, angry and sad.' </p>

<p>West Ham lost 5-3 at home to Bournemouth and their defending was at times woeful</p>

<p>Mark Noble played in the friendly defeat off the back of an angry tweet about a player sale</p>

<p>The loss came hours after club captain Noble tweeted his anger over sale of Grady Diangana</p>

<p>It’s just comical. I know it’s only a friendly but a bit of effort would help.</p>

<p>It has also emerged that the West Ham board are thought to be 'unimpressed' with Noble's outburst, reports The Athletic, though it is not believed that the 33-year-old will be punished. </p>

<p>Noble, who has played for the Hammers since 2004, wrote: 'As captain of this football club I'm gutted, angry and sad that Grady has left, great kid with a great future!!!!!'</p>

<p>The winger played a huge part in Slaven Bilic's Baggies side last season that earned automatic promotion back to the topflight.</p>

<p>He made 31 appearances for West Brom last season, scoring eight goals and setting up six more.</p>

<p>Grady Diangana was sold to West Brom on Friday for £18m, which resulted in Noble's outburst </p>

<p>The off-pitch drama seemingly impacted performance on the pitch, given Saturday's display</p>

<p>Ultimately, Diangana opted to rejoin the former Hammers boss at the Hawthorns in another disappointing transfer blow for the London club.</p>

<p>Other players showed their support for Noble, as Chelsea target Declan Rice liked the captain's tweet in a show of support as the players showcased their displeasure with Diangana's sale. </p>

<p>And though the sale has reportedly brought the current squad closer together, it did not show on the pitch at the London Stadium as their preparations for their season-opener against Newcastle on Saturday suffered a major setback against Bournemouth. </p>

<p>One supporter tweeted: 'It's just comical. I know it's only a friendly but a bit of effort would help,' with another saying: 'There is absolutely no chance they are trying.'</p>

<p>However, manager David Moyes has issued a rallying cry to West Ham fans ahead of the new season, pledging to give them a team they can be proud of. </p>

<p>West Ham manager David Moyes has vowed to build a team that the fans can be proud of</p>

<p>'What I'd like is to build. To say to supporters, "I'm going to give you a team to be proud of. Something that is not going to be flaky. Something with consistency,"' he told The Times. </p>

<p>'The ends [seating areas] have been brought in closer to the pitch at the stadium and I want fans to come back thinking, "We've got a team with exciting young talent that every week will give us total commitment."</p>

<p>'The model has to change. I want a club that's looking longer into the future. I don't want players who turn up at West Ham thinking, "I'm going to put some money in my pocket and have a couple of nice years in London."'  </p>
