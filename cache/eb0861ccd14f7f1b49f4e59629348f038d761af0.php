<p>Hints: Bachelor fan account, Bachiefunny, pointed out that the 25-year-old had tellingly liked an Instagram post about about people ‘giving up’ on relationship</p>

<p>Spoiler: On Wednesday, Bella Varelis (pictured) appeared to spoil the ending of the hit Channel 10 dating show, hinting that her relationship with Locky Gilbert is over </p>

<p>The post read: 'Being in a relationship in this generation genuinely makes me nervous because you never know when someone will give up'. </p>

<p>Alongside the post, Bachiefunny commented: 'A great start to finale week, shall we just turn off now? Bella loves those subtle hints'.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Bella has hinted that she doesn't end up with the former Survivor star. </p>

<p>Not again: This isn't the first time Bella has hinted that she doesn't end up with the former Survivor star (pictured)</p>

<p>On Monday, the marketing consultant described eliminated contestant Bec Cvilikas as her 'other half' on the show rather than Locky, once again hinting that she doesn't receive the final rose.  </p>

<p>'Bec was my other half. Once we met, it was like, yep, we're going to be friends,' Bella told New Idea.</p>

<p>While Bella was only talking about her friendship with Bec, 25, the use of the term 'other half' is telling since it is normally reserved for romantic partners.</p>

<p>Besties! Bella (left) said fellow contestant Bec Cvilikas (right) is her 'other half', which is an interesting choice of words a friend </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bec said: 'The second we met, I knew we were going to be friends.' </p>

<p>Bella and Bec have remained close since the show wrapped and have been spotted frequently hanging out together. </p>

<p>The Bachelor concludes Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10.  </p>
