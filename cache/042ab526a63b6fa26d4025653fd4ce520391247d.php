<p>But despite the disappointing outcome, the 25-year-old is counting her lucky stars she was paired with the astrophysicist instead of this year's suitor, Locky Gilbert.</p>

<p>'I'm glad he wasn't my Bachelor!' She may have been left heartbroken by Matt Agnew during last year's season of The Bachelor, but Abbie Chatfield (pictured) is counting her lucky stars she was paired with the astrophysicist instead of this year's suitor, Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>She said Locky was 'fine' as a Bachelor, but admitted that his adventurousness wasn't exactly suited to her personality.</p>

<p>'I'm glad that I had a little science nerd,' she said. 'I'm glad that I had Matt.' </p>

<p>Abbie, who is an ambassador for feminine hygiene brand Libra, hasn't been keeping up with the new season for personal reasons, however.</p>

<p>'I've watched two episodes and I got a bit too triggered,' she explained. </p>

<p>Not for Abbie! 'I'm glad Locky wasn't my Bachelor because the thought of doing outdoorsy stuff makes me want to die!' Abbie joked in an interview with Daily Mail Australia on Friday</p>

<p>Better match: She said Locky was 'fine' as a Bachelor, but admitted that his adventurousness wasn't exactly suited to her personality. Pictured with Matt Agnew on The Bachelor last year</p>

<p>Abbie has previously said that watching The Bachelor isn't a positive experience for her because the editing tricks remind her of how she was stitched up last season. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, her concerns about Locky's love for the outdoors are shared by several of the contestants from the new season.</p>

<p>Self-professed snob Laura Calleri, who was eliminated last week, told The Daily Telegraph she was unsure if they were 'going to click' because of his back-and-forth travelling between Perth and Bali for his adventure tourism business. </p>

<p>Fellow evictee Areeba Emmanuel also expressed her dislike of the outdoors before reluctantly going on a football-themed group date, saying: 'I'm definitely not the kind of girl who likes the rain and likes to get dirty.'</p>

<p>She told Daily Mail Australia that her podcast It's A Lot and the Libra brand have the 'same ethos' of 'breaking down stigmas' about topics such as sex, masturbating, relationships, mental health and periods.</p>

<p>'It is a testament to how important it is and much we need to talk about all these taboo subjects,' Abbie said of the campaign.</p>
