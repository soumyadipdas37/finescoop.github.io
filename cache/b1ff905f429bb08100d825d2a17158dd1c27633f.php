<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A late night snack almost turned deadly when a 15-year-old schoolgirl accidentally burned down her house while trying to cook deep fried chips. </p>

<p>Linda Barrett, 55, her three daughters, and their two beloved dogs managed to escape the inferno on Tuesday night after cooking oil 'ignited in an instant'. </p>

<p>The blaze ripped through their Glenhaven home, northwest of Sydney, destroying the kitchen, dining room, lounge room and upstairs area.</p>

<p>Parts of the house that escaped the worst of the fire were still damaged by smoke and water. </p>

<p>Up to 15 firefighters raced to the property and spent hours trying to save the family home.</p>

<p>The daughters, aged 13, 15 and 18, were all treated for shock before paramedics reassured them 'accidents happen'.  </p>

<p>The loving mother said she had no 'hard feelings' against her 15-year-old daughter and said it was more important that no one was hurt. </p>

<p>'I know it was an accident but my daughter is heartbroken, she feels completely responsible,' she told The Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>'But it was a silly split-second mistake, it could happen to anyone.'</p>

<p>The schoolgirl was heating up cooking oil before covering it with a lid, but when she opened the lid a fire erupted out. </p>

<p>The quick thinking 15-year-old immediately raced to wake up her mother.</p>

<p>After a fire blanket failed to stop the blaze from spreading the entire family fled from the home. </p>

<p>Mrs Barrett was dealt another devastating blow when her insurance company told her she wasn't covered for house fires.</p>

<p>The Sydney mother had been paying two separate insurance premiums on her Jeep instead of on her car and her house. </p>

<p>She said the busy life of a single mother had caused her to miss the simple error, which cost the family the protection they desperately needed. </p>

<p>'I want to teach my girls resilience so now I've been given the chance to give them a real life example of how to rebuild after adversity,' she said.  </p>

<p>Mrs Barrett's stepdaughter, Natalie Sutcliffe, set up a My Cause fundraising page for her family with hopes it could help them rebuild their lives. </p>

<p>'My mum and sisters have been made instantly homeless and lost everything,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'I have all faith of rallying the community, friends and family to help them get back on their feet.'</p>

<p>The family were told it would cost around $350,000 to fully repair their home. </p>

<p>'I would at least like to help them feel like they can make some moves forward in starting again,' Mrs Sutcliffe wrote.  </p>

<p>In a second devastating blow for the family, Mrs Barrett's insurance doesn't cover house fire because she was paying two policies on her car instead of one on her house (pictured)</p>
