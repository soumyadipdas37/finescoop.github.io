<p>Zayn left One Direction in 2015 and since then his and Louis' relationship has been rocky, with them not being thought to have spoken much.</p>

<p>Earlier this year Louis revealed he didn't feel ready to make amends with Zayn and said he believes that Pillow Talk singer has been 'disrespectful'.</p>

<p>Louis admitted that he thinks Zayn has talked 's***' in interviews but said he can understand that when you're in a certain mood sometimes you just want to 'run your mouth', referring to his negative comments about the band.</p>

<p>During an interview with The Sun, Louis didn't want to rule out a reunion with Zayn in the future however he confessed he doesn't feel ready to 'yet'.</p>

<p>Exciting! Thousands of fans praised Louis' liking of the sweet post, gushing that it could mean he was ready to be friends again </p>

<p>As the discussion moved to his former band mates, he revealed he is still in contact with Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Liam Payne 'sporadically' however he no longer talks to Zayn.</p>

<p>Louis was asked if he's tried to make up with his former band mate and he said: 'No, but I've not actively tried. We've all got a lot on our plates and there might be a day where I wake up and think: 'OK, I want to right that wrong', but not yet.'</p>

<p>Louis has also spoken candidly about believing his and Zayn's friendship 'never really got better' after the singer didn't support his tribute performance to his late mother Johannah Deakin in December 2016.</p>

<p>Speaking on The Dan Wootton Interview podcast in March, the singer admitted that it 'really bugged' him when Zayn 'didn't show' at his X Factor appearance.</p>

<p>Throwback: Zayn left One Direction in 2015 and it is thought that his and Louis' relationship has been rocky over the years with them not often speaking (pictured with former 1D bandmates Harry Styles, Liam Payne, and Niall Horanin 2010)</p>

<p>He explained: 'Truthfully it never really got better to be honest, I had a couple of calls with him after I lost me mum and, you know, all the boys had agreed to come to that performance and he didn’t show and that really bugged me.' </p>

<p>While he was clearly upset by the incident, he concluded by saying he hoped that Zayn was 'alright'.  </p>

<p>Zayn and Gigi announced the birth of their first child, a daughter, in a touching social media post on Wednesday, calling their precious gift 'healthy and beautiful.'</p>
