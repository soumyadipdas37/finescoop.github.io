<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She was recently rumored to have restarted her romance with her ex Tristan Thompson.</p>

<p>But Khloé Kardashian was focused on their daughter True Thompson, two, on Monday as she caught her taking a sip of her drink.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star tempered the cute video with a more somber message in her Instagram Stories about the ongoing military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. </p>

<p>Caught red-handed: Khloé Kardashian, 36, shared a cute video of her daughter True Thompson, two, looking embarrassed after she was caught sipping her mother's drink</p>

<p>Khloe's video caught True outside while she wore a cute pale pink onesie decorated with orange fruit-like designs and teal leaves.</p>

<p>The toddler had her short hair slicked to the side and in a bun.</p>

<p>Khloé zoomed in on her as she picked up her mother's silver bedazzled cup and began taking a sip from the straw.</p>

<p>'Did you take my drink,' Khloé asks True, which elicits a surprised cough from the little girl.</p>

<p>Unconcerned, she goes back to drink, before slamming the cup down on the concrete design and running away to play. </p>

<p>Sweet: Khloe's video caught True outside while she wore a cute pale pink onesie decorated with orange fruit-like designs and teal leaves</p>

<p>Making a run for it: 'Did you take my drink,' Khloé asked, which made True cough from surprise. But she went back to drinking before slamming the cup down and running away</p>

<p>The cute clip was a short respite from a darker message Khloé shared earlier in the day.</p>

<p>The Revenge Body host shared a lengthy text post to her Insta Stories over a pink cloud background informing her 122 million followers about the ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>'What's going on in Armenian [sic] breaks my heart. I pray so deeply for everyone's safety and health,' she began.</p>

<p>The reality star urged her fans to follow her and her friend Eric Esrailian, a gastroenterologist who teaches at UCLA and a film producer, for updates on the conflict, which she described as 'unprovoked attacks — by Azerbaijan — against civilian #Armenians in #Artsakh.'</p>

<p>Artsakh, also known as Nagorno-Karabakh, is a disputed region between Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>Military conflict: Earlier on Monday, Khloé urged her fans to learn more about the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, in which the opposing forces have been fighting over disputed territory</p>

<p>Although it is recognized as part of Azerbaijan by the international community, it's ruled by an independent government and is primarily comprised of ethnic Armenians. </p>

<p>Dozens of Azerbaijani and Armenian service members have been killed in recent days as the two sides have begun fighting. </p>

<p>'#Armenia and Artsakh are defending themselves but seek assistance from the international community to condemn these attacks &amp; restore peace to the region,' Khloé continued, before urging her fans to share the news and get involved.</p>

<p>Khloé's older sister Kim Kardashian also posted about the conflict.</p>

<p>They and their sister Kourtney Kardashian are of Armenian descent through their late father, Robert Kardashian, and Kim has previously spoken out against Turkey, which supports Azerbaijan in the conflict, for the genocide it carried out against Armenians from 1914–1923.</p>

<p>Picking a side: Khloé and her sisters Kim and Kourtney are of Armenian descent through their late father Robert Kardashian. Khloé clearly saw the Azerbaijani forces as the aggressors</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Khloé was joined by True's father Tristan, 29, as they resumed filming the final season of KUWTK.</p>

<p>The Kardashian–Jenner clan announced earlier this month that the long-running reality series would come to an end in 2021 with the 20th season, which the family are currently filming.</p>

<p>Khloé and Tristan are rumored to have restarted their relationship after months of quarantining together amid the ongoing pandemic to raise their daughter together.</p>

<p>A source told Us Weekly that the reality star 'doesn't really care' what people think of her relationship with Tristan.</p>

<p>For his part, the Cleveland Cavaliers player is reportedly trying to get traded to a team in Los Angeles or the rest of California in order to be closer to his family. </p>
