<p>Window watcher: Wendy Williams during a chat show appearance Tuesday said that she's been using binoculars to spy on her showering neighbor during the coronavirus epidemic</p>

<p>'What are you seeing?' Seth pressed. 'I'm assuming the window is not head-to-toe.'</p>

<p>'No, it's head-to-ankle,' Wendy replied, making Seth laugh.</p>

<p>'Wendy, when I heard you had the binoculars, I thought it was about passersby,' he said. 'But now I feel like what you're doing is borderline criminal.'</p>

<p>'I peep, and I tom,' Wendy offered, shrugging.</p>

<p>Daytime diva: The 56-year-old daytime diva appeared on Late Night With Seth Meyers while preparing for the season 12 premiere of her show and admitted to being a looky-loo</p>

<p>The talk-show host frequently returned to thoughts of men as she geared up for her show's September 21 relaunch.</p>

<p>Like Seth, she had had to halt production on the program in mid-March, as cases of COVID-19 surged in New York City.</p>

<p>'We've been off for seven months,' Wendy reminded Seth. 'I haven't been hugged by a man in five months. You have Mrs. Meyers. People have people. I have a search.'</p>

<p>Showering man: 'There's an apartment building across, and the man takes showers, and the shower is right there at the window,' Wendy told Seth, 46. 'And I watch'</p>

<p>Wendy's divorce from ex-husband Kevin Hunter was finalized in January.</p>

<p>She allowed that for the first two months of the pandemic, dating was easy, but for the last five months, she hadn't wanted anyone near her.</p>

<p>'I'm like, ''Uh-uh'',' she said. 'Don't come over here.'</p>

<p>Newly single: Wendy's divorce from ex-husband Kevin Hunter was finalized in January</p>

<p>Wendy admitted that she had been to Los Angeles recently, as Seth showed a photo of her wearing a silver visor that covered her eyes.</p>

<p>She said that she had gone for business, and that she was 'always looking for the business,' too, intimating she was looking for a man.</p>

<p>In the meantime, she noted, her cats had recently 'posted' a photo of her with Seth and former United States Attorney General Eric Holder to Instagram.</p>

<p>Seth showed off photos of Wendy's rescue cats, a black tabby called Chit Chat and a tiger-striped feline named My Way. He noted that they sounded like Kentucky Derby names.</p>

<p>'I named them because that's how I'm doing life,' Wendy volunteered. 'I'm divorced, I'm single, I'm a thoroughbred.'</p>

<p>The animal lover said her cats had been born in an alleyway to a female cat that 'had been attacked by some guy cat and then she had eight babies. The other six ran away, but Chit Chat and My Way chose to stay with the mom and say, 'What are we gonna do now?'</p>

<p>Wendy settled into her chair on her newly refurbished show set and reported that her staff got 'three tests a day' to make sure they were safe from COVID-19.</p>

<p>She had filmed her show from home at one point during the pandemic, but didn't like it.</p>

<p>'I don't know how big your home is and how much space you have, but I live in an apartment,' Wendy told Seth, adding, 'Not my fault,' in a reference to her divorce.</p>

<p>Coming soon: Wendy settled into her chair on her newly refurbished show set and reported that her staff got 'three tests a day' to make sure they were safe from COVID-19 ahead of the upcoming season 12 premiere on September 21</p>

<p>'I live in an apartment and it was very personal to me, for people to see my area,' she went on. 'And people criticized, and couldn't understand my groove. And then we stopped doing that because we were ramping up for new stuff, new season, new Wendy.'</p>

<p>Seth pointed out that Wendy would be resuming her show without an audience, and noted that the energy on her set is 'so contagious, so much fun. I imagine you're going to miss it.'</p>

<p>'No,' Wendy said. 'No, you know why? I come from radio, and in radio, you only have a microphone and you in a booth, until you don't.'</p>

<p>No audience: Seth pointed out that Wendy would be resuming her show without an audience, and noted that the energy on her set is 'so contagious, so much fun. I imagine you're going to miss it'</p>

<p>'Like this right here'—she gestured around at her studio—'is something else to me. But I'm still only used to talking to me in my head and you looking at the camera. So it's not a big deal not to have an audience.'</p>

<p>Asked by Seth whether she would continue doing her beloved 'Ask Wendy' segment, Wendy cracked, 'Ah they'll figure that out. That's what we have producers for. Call in to people, ask 'em some questions, and we'll do ''Ask Wendy''.'</p>

<p>Seth teased her, 'People like you and I, we don't have to get caught up in the details. We have a staff for that. They're a lot smarter than us. They can solve all our problems.'</p>

<p>'That's what I say,' Wendy retorted.</p>

<p>She did admit that had missed out on some planned show events during the summer, including a visit by the band Guns N' Roses.</p>

<p>She also showed Seth her Wendy show mugs, which boasted a lip print on the rim, and successfully fished for a compliment about it from the host.</p>
