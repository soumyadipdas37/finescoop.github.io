<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Slaven Bilic's pleas to West Brom to secure another loan spell for Filip Krovinovic could be set to pay off after a significant breakthrough in talks with Benfica.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old Croatian midfielder impressed during last season's loan stint to help the Baggies return to the Premier League as Championship runners-up. </p>

<p>Boss Bilic has been outspoken in his desire to re-sign countryman Krovinovic and has been demanding answers from the club on why another deal hasn't been struck.</p>

<p>Filip Krovinovic played 43 times on loan at West Brom last season, scoring three goals</p>

<p>Slaven Bilic has sent a clear message to his bosses to re-sign the Benfica midfielder</p>

<p>Last week he said: 'I will be extremely disappointed if it doesn't happen, I don't even want to think about it.</p>

<p>'Every day when I walk into the training ground I ask about him. Why? Because last year he played a lot of games for us.'</p>

<p>Albion had been struggling to put a deal together given their tight budget restrictions and last week hopes had been fading they would be able to strike an agreement with Benfica. </p>

<p>But now it appears the Premier League side are in pole position to bring the playmaker back to The Hawthorns with Krovinovic likely to sign a new contact in Portugal before returning to the West Midlands. </p>

<p>Getafe and Bologna have been interested in Krovinovic but Albion, having struggled to put concrete offers down, have now made a significant breakthrough after weeks of talks.</p>

<p>Krovinovic played 43 times on loan last term, scoring three goals and Bilic said: 'He was brilliant on the pitch.</p>

<p>'You can be versatile with him on the pitch, you can change systems without changing the players.'  </p>

<p>Albion have completed permanent deals for three of last season's loan players, Grady Diangana, Matheus Pereira and Callum Robinson.</p>

<p>West Brom, who host Chelsea on Saturday, have lost their first two Premier League games and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Brentford on penalties earlier this week. </p>
