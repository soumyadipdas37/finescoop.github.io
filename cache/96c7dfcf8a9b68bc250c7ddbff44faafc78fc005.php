<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Singapore has announced it will pay its citizens to use a new fitness app that will work with the Apple Watch. </p>

<p>The government will run a two-year programme starting in October that will see users given cash rewards for hitting fitness goals.</p>

<p>People will be able to earn up to £215 in eVouchers, which can then be spent on things like cinema tickets, food, and clothing.</p>

<p>Singapore will pay its citizens to use the Apple Watch alongside a new health app, which the government hopes will encourage people to take up healthy habits</p>

<p>Singapore hopes the scheme will encourage people to pick up healthy habits, which will then continue after the scheme has finished.</p>

<p>The city-state already runs a health scheme that rewards people for completing challenges via their smartphones.</p>

<p>The app sets users daily health goals, which earn points, which can be redeemed into coins, which can be spent in the real world</p>

<p>But the introduction of the Apple Watch is the first time that a corporation has been used to help monitor people's activities.</p>

<p>Apple claimed that the initiative is the first of its kind, anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The scheme was announced on Tuesday, at the same time Apple launched its new watch, the Series 6, which contains enhanced health features.</p>

<p>It includes a blood oxygen monitor that examines the color of blood flowing through the body to determine levels of oxygen.</p>

<p>Blood oxygen levels are typically used as a measure of fitness and heart health, reflecting how well red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. </p>

<p>But Apple is now investigating whether the indicator, together with the heart rate monitor, could be used to detect early signs of Covid-19.</p>

<p>The scheme in Singapore works by having users download an app called LumiHealth, which links to the watch.</p>

<p>The announcement, which Apple called a world first, came on the same day the company announced its new Series 6  watch (pictured) </p>

<p>Users complete activities which earn points, that eventually collect into coins, which can then be redeemed for vouchers to spend in the real world.</p>

<p>Tasks are personalised to users based on their weight, age and gender. They include step targets, as well as activities such as swimming, cycling and yoga.</p>

<p>'Singapore has one of the world's leading healthcare systems, and we are thrilled to be partnering with them to incorporate Apple Watch and LumiHealth into their holistic approach to well-being,' said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer. </p>

<p>'Apple Watch has already helped millions of our customers manage their activity levels to improve their health, and we look forward to applying our expertise here in the same privacy-friendly way that distinguishes all Apple products and services.' </p>
