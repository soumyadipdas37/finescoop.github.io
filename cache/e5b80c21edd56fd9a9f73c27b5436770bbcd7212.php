<p>Keeping the peace: Things got very intense as host Eamonn, 60, was forced to ask Denise to take things down a notch as she got very passionate</p>

<p>The debate, which also included Dr Sara Kayat, saw Denise also talk about people's mental health and the fact that people who suffer from the likes of cancer and heart disease were failing to receive the treatment they needed. </p>

<p>Turning to Dr Sara for her opinion, Eamonn said of Denise: 'She's not extremely right-ring on all of this.'</p>
