<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham Hotspur's search for a striker looks no closer to being solved with a potential move for Crystal Palace's Alexander Sorloth unlikely to go ahead.</p>

<p>The Palace forward had emerged as an ideal target to help ease the workload off Harry Kane but Spurs are now keen to turn their attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>Sorloth has scored just one League Cup goal in 20 appearances at Selhurst Park since joining the Eagles two years ago but hit top form while on loan at Trabzonspor last season to record 24 goals in just 34 league appearances.</p>

<p>Tottenham Hotspur are unlikely to make a move for Crystal Palace striker Alexander Sorloth</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho meanwhile is keeping tabs on Real Madrid full-back Sergio Reguilon to boost his full-back options, despite the 23-year-old having held talks with Manchester United. </p>

<p>The Spurs boss still wants to strengthen his attack and defence but is happy with his goalkeeping options and is ready to loan out young goalkeeper Alfie Whiteman.</p>

<p>A number of League One and League Two clubs have shown interest in the 21-year-old and Spurs are keen for him to go out and gain more competitive game time.</p>

<p>Spain defender Sergio Reguilon though is still of interest to the north London side</p>

<p>Whiteman has been at the club since 2015 and is under contract until 2022. A former England Under 19 international, Whiteman was born and bred in Tottenham, is a lifelong Spurs fan and figured on the bench last season.</p>

<p>He trains regularly with the first team but with the arrival of Joe Hart only adding to the competition, Whiteman is ready to step out and gain experience elsewhere.</p>

<p>Tottenham also have Brandon Austin available for loan. He had a spell at Viborg in Denmark earlier this season while they have also fielded enquiries for Paulo Gazzaniga. </p>

<p>Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Alfie Whiteman  is available to go out on loan</p>

<p>Many lower league clubs are interested in a short term deal for the 21-year-old</p>
