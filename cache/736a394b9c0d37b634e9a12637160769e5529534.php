<p>She shared a photo of the hand-written note and the offending ticket to a local Facebook page</p>

<p>'Please do not book me. Gone to RNS (Royal North Shore) emergency,' her note read.   </p>

<p>She also along with a selfie of herself in a mask at the hospital and a photo of the waiting room. </p>

<p>A number of locals were sympathetic to her plight, urging her to provide a medical certificate to the authorities to appeal the fine.</p>

<p>'This has happened to me before, with proof of a medical emergency afterwards they will cancel the ticket,' a woman wrote.</p>

<p>Ms Best also shared a picture of herself inside the hospital after leaving her car  </p>

<p>'Same happened to my family... Even with proof of ambulance paperwork etc still wouldn't rescind - very ruthless rangers and heartless,' another wrote.</p>

<p>But some were convinced she deserved the parking fine. </p>

<p>'You’ve had time to put a note on a car 6+km’s away from emergency and then found another form of transport to get to the hospital to sit patiently at the back of triage,' a third person wrote.  </p>

<p>'You can’t realistically believe you won’t be fined.'</p>
