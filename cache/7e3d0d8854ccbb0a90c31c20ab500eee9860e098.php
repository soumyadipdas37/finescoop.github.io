<p>He is also accused of raping a 28-year-old woman in April 2003 and sometime between October and December of that year of raping a woman, 23, who officials say he had invited to his Hollywood Hills home.  </p>

<p>Last year four women filed a lawsuit against Masterson in California claiming the actor drugged, raped and sexually assaulted them in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>The lawsuit also names the Church of Scientology and its leader David Miscavige as defendants, claiming the women were stalked in a 'conspiracy to cover up that Daniel Masterson sexually assaulted four young women'.    </p>

<p>Two of the women named in the suit were Masterson's ex-girlfriends - Chrissie Bixler and Bobette Riales - while the other two are listed as Jane Does. </p>

<p>The lawsuit states: 'When those women came forward to report Masterson's crimes the Defendants conspired to and systematically stalked, harassed, invaded their and their family's privacy, and intentionally caused them emotional distress and silence and intimidate them.'  </p>

<p>Masterson called the lawsuit against him and the Church of Scientology a 'shameful money grab'.</p>

<p>In statement to DailyMail.com, the Church of Scientology called the lawsuit 'baseless' and the claims 'ludicrous and a sham'. </p>

<p>'It's a dishonest and hallucinatory publicity stunt. Leah Remini is taking advantage of these people as pawns in her moneymaking scam.' </p>

<p>Chrissie Bixler dated Masterson for several years and claims he would forcefully have sex with her and became violent when she refused. She says her dog mysteriously died after she reported him (pictured together in 2000)</p>

<p>Bobette Riales and Masterson dated from 2002-2004, in which time Masterson allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted her. She claims she was stalked by the church after she came forward with allegation (pictured together in 2003) </p>

<p>A spokesman for the District Attorney's Office said they have 'declined to file sexual assault charges against Masterson in two other cases, one for insufficient evidence and the other based upon the statute of limitations for the crime alleged'. </p>

<p>Masterson has been married to actor and model Bijou Phillips since 2011. </p>

<p>Masterson's attorney Tom Mesereau said in a statement: 'Mr. Masterson is innocent, and we're confident that he will be exonerated when all the evidence finally comes to light and witnesses have the opportunity to testify.</p>

<p>'Obviously, Mr. Masterson and his wife are in complete shock considering that these nearly 20-year old allegations are suddenly resulting in charges being filed, but they and their family are comforted knowing that ultimately the truth will come out. </p>

<p>'The people who know Mr. Masterson know his character and know the allegations to be false.'  </p>

<p>All of the alleged crimes occurred at the defendant's home, Deputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller of the Sex Crimes Division, who is prosecuting the case, said.</p>
