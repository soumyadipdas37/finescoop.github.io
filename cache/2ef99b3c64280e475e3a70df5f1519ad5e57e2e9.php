<p>Mischa departed the series following its third season, at which point The O.C.'s ratings began a precipitous decline.</p>

<p>Mischa's connection to Orange County made her a logical choice to join The Hills: New Beginnings, an update on the original MTV reality series.</p>

<p>She was featured in the first season, which began airing in June 2019, but her future on the series is currently uncertain.</p>

<p>Us Weekly reported in March that the actress wouldn't be returning for a second season of the revival and would be replaced by Caroline D'Amore.</p>

<p>Mischa denied the report on Instagram shortly after, writing, 'Lol. Where do people get their reporting from?'</p>

<p>She also took shots at Caroline: 'As if anyone would watch <?php echo e('@'); ?>Carolinedamore try to hoc her boring a** pasta bowls and greasy pizza on tv. Tried that it was like watching paint dry. Get the story straight first <?php echo e('@'); ?>usweekly.'</p>
