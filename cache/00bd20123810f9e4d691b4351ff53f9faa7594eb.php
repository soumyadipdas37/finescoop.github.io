<p>Jadd William Brooker, 38, was granted bail on Thursday at the Christies Beach Magistrates Court in Adelaide to live with his grandmother in home detention.</p>

<p>But he remains in custody as prosecutors work to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>South Australian Police warned Brooker should not be released as he allegedly pursued teenagers for sex and tried to destroy potential evidence, Adelaide Now reported.</p>

<p>Jadd William Brooker, 38, was granted bail on Thursday at the Christies Beach Magistrates Court in Adelaide to live with his grandmother in home detention</p>

<p>Police allege one of the teenagers Brooker had sex with did not know he was HIV positive, and was also the subject of child exploitation material.</p>

<p>'(The surviving victim) was unaware of Brooker's medical status when they engaged in sexual activity, and he is currently undergoing medical testing,' prosecutors told court on Thursday. </p>

<p>When he was contacted in prison by his mother she volunteered to delete Brooker's Facebook account and he asked her to wipe other accounts for him, the court heard.</p>

<p>Brooker allegedly provided his email and password for his Microsoft Live account and asked his mother to delete it.</p>

<p>'Given the nature of the charges, a lot of potential evidence is stored in the cloud – potentially millions of pieces of evidence – and this is an attempt to destroy it before police can uncover it,' police prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old allegedly pursued 19 children all aged between 13 and 16 for sex online and also has connections to other alleged paedophiles.</p>

<p>He is currently in custody as prosecutors are working to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court</p>

<p>Despite the warnings from police Magistrate Rodney Oates granted bail as he had no prior criminal history, no breaches of bail and the presumption of innocence.</p>

<p>'I do take into account the fact other charges are being investigated but, in relation to this bail application, I must focus on the charges that are before this court,' he told the court. </p>

<p>Brooker is yet to plead to multiple counts of disseminating and possessing child exploitation material.</p>

<p>Prosecutors allege the offences occurred from December 2015 and August this year and that Brooker has maintained an illegal relationship with two male teenagers.</p>

<p>Investigators allege to have evidence that Brooker intended to 'infect both children and adults with HIV'. </p>

<p>Magistrate Oates agreed and released Brooker on $1,000 bail to live with his grandmother under 24-hour electric monitoring. </p>

<p>Prosecutors are challenging the decision and Brooker's release was postponed pending a hearing.</p>
