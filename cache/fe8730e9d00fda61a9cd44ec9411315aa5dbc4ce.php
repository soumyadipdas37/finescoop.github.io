<p>The 18-year-old striker reported back to United on Thursday having been sent home from the England camp in disgrace over the weekend.</p>

<p>But upon his return to Carrington, Greenwood was told he must train away from the rest of the United squad 'for the next few days' because of the coronavirus risk.</p>

<p>Mason Greenwood 'has been told to train alone for the next few days' by Manchester UnitedÂ </p>

<p>Greenwood was handed his England debut by Gareth Southgate in Iceland - but was then sent home from England duty along with Phil Foden after sneaking girls into the team hotel</p>

<p>The Sun report that Greenwood was told he must arrive at the training ground only after manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the first-team squad had gone home.</p>

<p>Greenwood will not be involved in a friendly against Aston Villa scheduled for this weekend as United prepare for their Premier League opener against Crystal Palace on September 19.</p>

<p>The teenager could yet be involved in that match at Old Trafford but United have reportedly insisted he undergoes a Covid-19 test - and returns a negative result - before he is admitted back into the first-team fold.</p>

<p>Greenwood can only train once manager Solskjaer and the rest of the squad have left</p>

<p>Greenwood - and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden - were sent home from England duty after breaking the squad's bio-secure bubble in Reykjavik by inviting two girls into their hotel.</p>

<p>Having both made their senior England debuts in Saturday's 1-0 UEFA Nations League win over Iceland, Greenwood and Foden were denied the chance to win a second cap against Denmark on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Solskjaer plans to speak to Greenwood over his expulsion from the England squad but United are determined to protect their young star from any further fall-out.</p>

<p>Greenwood underwent a Covid risk assessment on Wednesday to determine if he can rejoin his team-mates but he will be training alone for the next few days.</p>
