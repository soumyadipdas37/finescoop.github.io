<p>Reminiscing: Lili Reinhart is reminiscing on her life during lockdown as she shared a series of snaps to Instagram on Monday, including a nude snap in the desert </p>

<p>In an undisclosed location, the Riverdale star posed with her knees to her chest and her blonde hair blowing across her face. </p>

<p>Most of the snaps were more lighthearted as she donned a white summer dress, with a pink floral design and crawled on a think railing edge over a green valley. </p>

<p>She also enjoyed a masked outing with friending, as she donned a white hoodie. </p>

<p>Her friends seem to be big fans of her little rescue dog Milo as they cuddled up to him while relaxing.  </p>

<p>Mask on: She also enjoyed a masked outing with friending, as she donned a white hoodie </p>

<p>She sipped on a drink next to a friend in another one, a pink hoodie that read 'sounds gay I'm in.' </p>

<p>The post comes after Lili came out on her Instagram stories earlier this year, following her split from Cole Sprouse in January.  </p>

<p>Lili admitted to the Los Angeles Times in August that she decided to come out so that she can publicly date whoever she wants without people asking questions. </p>

<p>She said: 'I thought: 'Do I like girls? I don't know.' As I've gotten older, the answer has become 'Yes. Clearly, I do.'</p>

<p>I'm in: She sipped on a drink next to a friend in another one, a pink hoodie that read 'sounds gay I'm in,' this comes after she came out as bisexual on her Instagram stories </p>

<p>Cuddly: Her friends seem to be big fans of her little rescue dog Milo as they cuddled up to him while relaxing</p>

<p>'I think I just felt at this point in time: Why not? If suddenly I started dating a girl publicly, I didn't want people to be, like, 'What the…?''</p>

<p>'Not that I would even owe anyone an explanation. Because I don't.'</p>

<p>She also has recently said she has known 'full well' that she is bisexual from a 'young age' and insists her sexuality has been 'no secret' for her close friends all her life, despite only announcing it publicly recently.</p>

<p>Lili came out in a post on her Instagram Story, in which she showed her support for a protest taking place in West Hollywood for members of the LGBTQ community who are in support of Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>Candid: The Riverdale star recently said she has known 'full well' that she is bisexual from a 'young age' and insists her sexuality has been 'no secret' for her close friends all her life, despite only announcing it publicly recently</p>

<p>Promoting the event, she wrote: 'Although I've never announced it publicly before, I am a proud bisexual woman. And I will be joining this protest today.'</p>

<p>She also recently returned to Canada to resume filming Riverdale, that was halted due to the coronavirus. </p>

<p>'I genuinely feel like a prisoner, going back to work, because I cannot leave Canada. That doesn’t feel good,' she told Nylon. 'You can’t go home for Thanksgiving, can’t visit your family. No one can come visit you unless they quarantine for two weeks. It just feels f*****.' </p>

<p>Despite her grievances, Lili acknowledged she is 'very lucky' to have the show to return to as other people have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. </p>
