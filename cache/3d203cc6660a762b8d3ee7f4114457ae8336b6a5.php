<p>She could be right: Padma Lakshmi thinks '50 is the new 30.' The Top Chef star made the comment on Instagram on Wednesday the day after she celebrated her milestone birthday</p>

<p>The star from Chennai, India appeared to be very toned as she flashed her sculpted arms, slender legs and small waistline.</p>

<p>The beauty had her raven hair put up in a messy bun as she modeled aviator sunglasses </p>

<p>Lakshmi had on no jewelry, just a hair tie around her wrist. </p>

<p>There were several other photos added where she was splashing around on the shore smiling all the time.</p>

<p>Flawless female: The star from Chennai, India appeared to be very toned as she flashed her sculpted arms, slender legs and small waistline</p>

<p>There is more to come from her: The cookbook author also noted that she felt like she was just getting started</p>

<p>On Monday she turned 50 and posted two other bikini snaps with a powerful message reflecting on the events of this past year.</p>

<p>The first photo Padma shared was one of herself holding a starfish as she stood on the beach wearing a colorful two-piece.</p>

<p>The Hulu star looked absolutely amazing as she stood at the waters edge with her line of vision towards the ocean animal.</p>

<p>In the second snap, Padma played around in the pool with her partner Dell and their daughter Krishna.</p>

<p>Padma raised her arm high up into the air as she gazed towards her daughter, who stood upon her father.</p>

<p>Relaxed glam: The beauty had her raven hair put up in a messy bun as she modeled aviator sunglasses</p>

<p>It's cold! Lakshmi had on no jewelry, just a hair tie around her wrist. There were several other photos added where she was splashing around on the shore smiling all the time</p>

<p>Her lengthy caption detailed the mixed emotions she had been grappling with this past year amid the pandemic.</p>

<p>From the highs to the lows, Padma candidly described them all.</p>

<p>While admitting just how fortunate she has been, she acknowledged 2020 has been a painful year for so many.   </p>

<p>'Birthday thoughts,' she began with a cloudy sun emoji. 'This year has been a mix of misery and elation.</p>

<p>'The whole world was swallowed up by the plague In March. We were lucky but so many weren’t and I felt an impending doom, a creeping anxiety I could not shake.</p>

<p>50 and fantastic! Lakshmi made a splash as she celebrated her milestone 50th birthday on Monday with a new post</p>

<p>Making a splash! In the second snap, Padma played around in the pool with her partner Adam Dell and their daughter Krishna, 10</p>

<p>'Then another Black life was taken and it was good that we all rose up- but so painful too. So painful that some of our fellow Americans could not even bring themselves to say that Black lives matter, some who hold our highest offices.</p>

<p>'But personally, at home things were peaceful. We made a cocoon for our family. We lived for the first time-all under one roof. We became closer.</p>

<p>'And professionally, I finally got to show the world what I would do if I got to build a show from scratch. "Taste the Nation" was well received beyond my wildest dreams, 100% even on rotten tomatoes!</p>

<p>'I am truly blessed': Lakshmi was grateful to have the support of her partner Adam Dell (pictured 2017)</p>

<p>That's her girl: Lakshmi said her daughter 'continues to be a miracle every day'</p>

<p>'But the best of all was hearing how all of you felt when you watched it, reading how families watched together.</p>

<p>'The episode with my mother and littlehands felt like a tribute to all my mother and millions of other immigrant parents had sacrificed.</p>

<p>'I cannot ask for anything more. I am truly blessed: a loving and attentive partner, a child that continues to be a miracle every day and work that I am proud of and fully engaged by with people I love.</p>

<p>'I am today very lucky. But I am also a product of the toil and troubles my younger self endured. And I thank that version of me.</p>

<p>Melting pot: 'The show was really just an extension of my advocacy work,' Padma previously told Us Weekly of the show</p>

<p>'Thank you all so much for joining me on this trip. I have loved sharing it with all of you everyday (even the Trump supporters) #thisis50 #virgoseason.'</p>

<p>Padma rose to stardom as the host of the hit Bravo competition show, Top Chef, for which she was nominated for an Emmy. </p>

<p>Nowadays she is on Hulu as the host of yet another food-oriented show, Taste The Nation.</p>

<p>'The show was really just an extension of my advocacy work and I hope it’s a way to advocate for these communities, while being informative and teaching people something, but also just being entertaining,' she previously told Us Weekly. </p>
