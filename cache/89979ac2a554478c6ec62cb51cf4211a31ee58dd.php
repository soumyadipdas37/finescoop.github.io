<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds are closing on a deal worth up to £20million for Real Sociedad defender Diego Llorente.</p>

<p>Leeds have turned to the 27-year old centre back after seeing their other defensive target Dinamo Zagreb’s Josko Gvardiol choose Red Bull Leipzig instead.</p>

<p>Lorente, formerly of Real Madrid, has been watched by a number of Premier League sides in recent seasons and has a £45m buy out clause that Sociedad usually insist upon.</p>

<p>Diego Llorente is on the brink of joining Leeds from Real Sociedad for £20million </p>

<p>However, they are willing to negotiate in this instance as they look to get money into the club.</p>

<p>Llorente has not always convinced regarding his consistency but Leeds hope his experience can help their young squad.</p>

<p>They are also looking to add a winger.</p>

<p>However, a deal for Udinese‘s £30m-rated attacking midfielder Rodrigo de Paul is unlikely at this stage. </p>

<p>Llorente has plenty of experience and has been capped by Spain on five occasions </p>
