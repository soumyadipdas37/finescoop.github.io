<p>Online profiles for Lafer show he is a real estate agent who had worked for Coldwell Banker King. Owner Terri King told News 11: 'Mr. Lafer was an independent contractor with Coldwell Banker King. He is no longer affiliated with our company. We have no relationship with Jared Lafer.'</p>

<p>Lafer's attorney Mac Meade said: 'This is not a case about racism. This is a case about a man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, faced with what he perceived as a dangerous condition, dangerous situation.</p>

<p>'His entire family, his wife and his three young kids under the age of six were all in the car with him. And he did what he felt was necessary to get out of a situation that he felt was dangerous to his family.' </p>

<p>Victoria Grace Hewlett, a spokeperson for the New Panthers Initiative which helped organize the protest, said: 'The driver could have turned left at the intersection, avoided the occupied crosswalk and easily taken another route, but chose to drive their car through a crowd lawfully using a crosswalk.</p>

<p>'The driver was clearly in no danger and had no right to put other peoples’ lives in danger. After running the individual over, the driver proceeded to speed away showing no regard for the person they injured.'</p>

<p>Hewlett confirmed the victim was left with two broken legs. </p>
