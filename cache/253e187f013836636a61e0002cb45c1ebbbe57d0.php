<p>The Weeknd opened the MTV VMAs in New York City with a performance of his hit song - Blinding Lights - on the rooftop of the Edge, which is the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere. </p>

<p>The Canada-born star came into the night with six nominations including Artist Of The Year, and five for the song's video: Video Of The Year, Best R&amp;B, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Direction by Anton Tammi. </p>

<p>High-flying: The Weeknd opened the 2020 MTV VMAs in New York City with a rooftop performance of his hit song Blinding Lights</p>

<p>Looking bloodied and bruised to match the cover of his latest studio album After Hours, the hitmaker kicked things off seemingly passed-out, laying on the ground in a pre-recorded clip.</p>

<p>As the intro to the song progressed, The Weeknd stood up to reveal his 1980s-era ensemble of black pants, red blazer and black shirt and tie.</p>

<p>The impressive visual effect included an array of light towers and images of subway cars behind him.</p>

<p>Cinematic: The singer-songwriter, 30, performed atop the Edge at Hudson Yards, which is the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere</p>

<p>Battered: The Canadian crooner looked bloodied and bruised to match the cover of his latest studio album After Hours, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200</p>

<p>Then, just as he went in to the catchy chorus, the shot switched to the singer-songwriter atop the Edge at Hudson Yards. </p>

<p>'I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights -- No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch,' he sang with the lights of New York City shining all around him</p>

<p>'I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night -- Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust -- Hey, hey, hey.'</p>

<p>With the help of a helicopter flying high above the streets of the Big Apple, the cameras circled the Starboy's every move as he delivered his performance on a bright triangle platform.</p>

<p>Dramatic: A helicopter flew high above the streets of the Big Apple, and circled the Starboy's every move</p>

<p>Acclaimed: The Weeknd came into the night with six MTV VMA nominations</p>

<p>As the song reached the climax after the final chorus, The Weeknd (born Abel Makkonen Tesfaye) yelled out: 'New York City', which was met with a massive fireworks show that showered the skyline.  </p>

<p>Blinding Lights is his fifth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

<p>After Hours, which has been described as an artistic reinvention for the artist, was released on March 20 and immediately shot to the top of the Billboard 200.                  </p>

<p>With the help of the other two singles --  Heartless and In Your Eyes -- it stayed at number one for four consecutive weeks.  </p>

<p>Hitmaker: Blinding Lights is The Weeknd's fifth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100</p>
