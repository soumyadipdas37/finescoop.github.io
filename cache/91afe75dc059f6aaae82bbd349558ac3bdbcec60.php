<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you're looking for a superior clean and to whiten your smile, then an electric toothbrush beats a manual brush hands down. </p>

<p>However, electric toothbrushes can be expensive, so before you splash your cash, you need to know if the results are worth it. </p>

<p>The Oral-B Smart 6 6000N has amassed over 1,100 reviews on Amazon and a near-perfect average score of 4.7 out of 5. With shoppers raving about its 'great results' and calling it an 'excellent product for maintaining healthy teeth and gums' it's a reliable choice. </p>

<p>What's more, the Oral-B Smart 6 6000 is now on sale on Amazon, reduced down to £59.99 down from £88. There's never been a better time to take your brushing game to the next level.</p>

<p>You can now save £28 on the Oral-B Smart 6 6000N CrossAction Electric Toothbrush- now reduced on Amazon to a very tempting £59.99</p>

<p>The Oral-B Smart 6 6000N has some impressive features that set it apart from other electric models. Firstly, it has Bluetooth connectivity which allows you to sync your brush to your phone for feedback to help you improve your routine and track your progress.</p>

<p>While this may seem excessive, shoppers have reported that it does have some useful insights like a pressure sensor which alerts you when you brush too hard, and you can even create customised routines such as adding extra time for problem areas.</p>

<p>Everything about the Oral-B 6000N has been designed to improve your brushing habits. Equipped with five brushing modes, including daily clean, pro-clean, sensitive, whitening and gum care, this is a toothbrush that will keep your oral hygiene in check. </p>

<p>If you're a lazy brusher, this could be the brush for you as when the toothbrush is connected to your phone.</p>

<p>The cordless and rechargeable toothbrush also features a timer, pressure sensor lights to prevent harmful over-brushing and a state of the art Lithium-Ion battery to last more than two weeks- great for if you forget the charger when going on holiday. </p>

<p>The Oral-B's famous professionally-inspired round head is smaller than most, allowing it to get into any crevices. The unique 3D cleaning action oscillates, rotates and pulsates to break up and remove up to 100 per cent more plaque than a standard manual toothbrush too, so you know you're getting a superior, deep clean.  </p>

<p>The toothbrush gently whitens your teeth starting as of day one while the visible pressure sensor alerts you if you're brushing to hard, protecting your gums </p>

<p>Shoppers have reported that unique cross action delivers results that are noticeable after just a couple of uses.</p>

<p>'I brushed my teeth with regular toothbrushes for years. I used this electric toothbrush, and I see the difference in less than two days! Teeth were buffed to a white finish and shine, not the way a regular toothbrush can. I'm glad I switched over, especially to this product.' </p>

<p>Another agreed, writing: 'I have tried numerous "manual" toothbrushes over the years and there is no doubt that an electric brush is far superior! My dilemma was which brand to buy. </p>

<p>'Having read the reviews, it seems Oral B was the best. Having purchased this model, I am extremely pleased with the results and performance of the brush. Lasts for days on a single charge and works flawlessly.' </p>

<p>A third raved: 'I will never go back to the old toothbrush. My gums are healthier, and my teeth are whiter. It feels like a deep clean every day.'   </p>

<p>And if you're still undecided on whether to ditch your regular manual toothbrush for an electric toothbrush, it's worth noting that many dentists believe that while both types remove dental plaque and prevent gum disease, the electronic variety can be superior.</p>
