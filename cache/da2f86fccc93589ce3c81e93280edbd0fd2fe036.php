<p>Cheerleader Jerry Harris, famed for his appearance on Netflix's Cheer, is being investigated by the FBI after he allegedly solicited sex and sexually explicit photos from minors</p>

<p>The criminal probe is based on allegations that were reported to police separately by Varsity, the global authority of competitive cheerleading.</p>

<p>In letters to police in Florida and Texas dated August 1, the company's chief legal officer Burton Brilhart said Varsity had learned of 'inappropriate sexual conduct' allegations against Harris and was disclosing the information to authorities as legally required.</p>

<p>'As a result of the recent allegation, we have barred this person from having any affiliation with Varsity Brands or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, now and in the future,' Brillhart wrote, as reported by USA Today. </p>

<p>Included within the letters were two screenshots. In one of the images, taken from Snapchat, a picture of what appears to be the upper part of Harris' face is show, along with the message, 'Would you ever want to f***'.</p>

<p>The second screenshot, consisting of a series of text messages from a May 2, 2019 exchange, shows an individual named 'jerry harris' writing: 'Hey btw I found a place for us to do stuff it’s actually pretty good haha.'</p>

<p>This is a developing story. Please check back for updates...</p>
