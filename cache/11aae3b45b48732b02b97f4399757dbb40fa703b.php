<p>Breaking his silence: Two days after the accidentally post, the movie star, 39, took to Twitter</p>

<p>The picture didn't leave anything to the imagination, but it was cropped too closely to have any identifying features.</p>

<p>Another image in the photo grid featured a headshot of the Avengers star with the words 'Guard That P***y' superimposed.  </p>

<p>Chris quickly became the subject of hundreds of thousands of tweets about the shocking photo.</p>

<p>Most posts took a lighthearted approach to the accidental disclosure, with some gushing about the actor's potential anatomy. </p>

<p> Although plenty of users had their own reactions to the accidental photo, a meme quickly developed in which Twitter posters shared the image of Evans' camera roll (which was cropped out by Twitter) but included something unexpected in place of the penis.</p>

<p>'Can someone explain why chris evans has this picture of thanos in his phone?' one post read, while featuring a camera roll snap including a humorous image of Thanos from the Avengers films with his bulging muscles and derriere exposed. </p>

<p>Many Twitter users called out those who searched for the nude photos and posting them because Chris did not consent to it.  </p>

<p>Fellow Marvel actor Kat Dennings, 34, used the opportunity to call out a sexist double standard.</p>

<p>She wrote: 'The public respect for Chris Evans' privacy/feelings is wonderful. Wouldn't it be nice if it extended to women when this kind of thing happens?'  </p>

<p>Chris' brother Scott Evans did not let the moment fly by as he hilariously addressed it on his Twitter account on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>'Was off social media for the day yesterday. So. What'd I miss?' the 36-year-old tweeted.  </p>
