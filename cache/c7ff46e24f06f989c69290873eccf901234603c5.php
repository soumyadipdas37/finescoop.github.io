<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A talented teenage cancer sufferer who has a place waiting for him at Oxford University admits he's at 'a loss for words' after kind strangers donated more than half a million pounds in a bid to help him live. </p>

<p>Alviar Cohen, 18, from Redbourn, Hertfordshire, was diagnosed with a rare strain of leukemia in 2017, when he was just 15, and says the disease has 'robbed' him of three years of his life.</p>

<p>After relapsing twice, Alviar was told by doctors earlier this year that the current treatment he's having may only last a few more months before the cancer starts to defeat it.  </p>

<p>His fundraising page, which now has over £525,000 in donations, is named 'Alvin's chance for a future'. </p>

<p>Overwhelmed: Alviar Cohen, 18, from Redbourn, Hertfordshire was diagnosed with a rare leukaemia in 2017 and has been told by doctors he has limited options for prolonging his life</p>

<p>The teenager was diagnosed three years ago and has undergone chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a bone marrow transplant from his twin brother</p>

<p>The state school student has a place confirmed to study biomedical science at Oxford University after managing to get five A* at A-level despite undergoing challenging radiotherapy while studying</p>

<p>The clever teenager has also already endured several rounds of chemotherapy and had a bone marrow transplant from his twin brother Justin - but in January he was told that he's now 'run out of options' by doctors treating the disease. </p>

<p>In a video posted on the fundraising page, he says: 'It's incredible. I am at a loss for words' after earlier detailing how 'he's running out of time' to beat the disease he has</p>

<p>Alviar says a more radical treatment in Singapore is now his final hope of keeping the disease at bay. </p>

<p>CAR-T cell therapies are available on the NHS for children and people up to 25 with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.</p>

<p>The treatments involve taking a specific immune cell - known as T cells - from a patient's blood. T cells help the body fight infection by seeking out viruses and other pathogens, before killing them. </p>

<p>These cells are then engineered in the lab to express a gene that codes for a specific receptor that binds to a protein on the patient's cancer. </p>

<p>Once these cells are re-infused into a patient's blood, their immune system is 'reprogrammed' to recognise and fight off tumours. </p>

<p>CAR-T – chimeric antigen receptor T-cell – therapy is therefore customised to each patient.  It is suitable for those with advanced or worsening blood cancers that are not responding to treatment or have relapsed. </p>

<p>NICE - which provides guidance for the NHS - also recommends CAR-T therapy for adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.</p>

<p>The FDA in the US approved two CAR-T cell therapies in 2017.   </p>

<p>He's hoping to join a CAR-T therapy trial which involves reprogramming the immune system cells for an individual patient. Those cells are then used to fight the cancer. </p>

<p>The therapies are becoming available on the NHS for children and people up to 25 with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia but Alviar's type of cancer means he'll have to go abroad for the treatment.</p>

<p>He was told last week he would be a good candidate for the treatment and immediately started a gofundme page. </p>

<p>In six days, Alviar has already smashed his original £500,000 target, after the fund went viral - something he described as 'amazing'. </p>

<p>Despite only going live last Wednesday, Alviar has raised more than the amount he needs in less than a week and is now hoping to fund others facing similar outcomes. </p>

<p>Author Neil Gaiman and England rugby union star Owen Farrell are among those who've contributed to Alviar's fund.</p>

<p>His story describes the heartbreaking news he's faced in recent months: 'In January my doctors told me we had run out of options and that I had limited time left. </p>

<p>'We reached out to specialists from all over the world. The brightest leukemia experts came back with one response. </p>

<p>'My time was very limited. Just a few months. I don’t want to go into the feelings my brain went through when I heard this. And when I saw my mum’s and dad’s faces. And my brothers. We were all terrified.</p>

<p>'Now, 8 months later I’m still here. But my doctors remain blunt. When the cancer starts to break through again and the chemo stops working I may have only a few weeks to live. We don’t know when this will be, but I am running out of time.'</p>

<p>In a video posted on the fundraising page, he says: 'It's incredible. I am at a loss for words. </p>

<p>'I did not expect to receive so much in donations in such a short amount of time.'  </p>
