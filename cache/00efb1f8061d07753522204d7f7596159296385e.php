<p>The Wuxi park released a statement on Saturday, saying that all 20 tourists were unhurt from the incident. The park in eastern China has been closed and offered refunds for visitors</p>

<p>‘The on-site staff immediately activated the emergency plan and organised the stranded tourists to leave the facility area in a safe and orderly manner,’ it read. ‘[We] communicated with each visitor and checked their physical condition.</p>

<p>A roller coaster in the park also became stuck in the air, leaving a full carriage of tourists trapped, according to Global Times.</p>

<p>A park employee said at the time that a foreign object, possibly a bird, had interfered with the rollercoaster's sensor and triggered the machine’s safety mechanism, causing it to stop.</p>
