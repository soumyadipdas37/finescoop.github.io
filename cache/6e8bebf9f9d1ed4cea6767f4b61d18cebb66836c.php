<p>Kylian Mbappe has warned PSG they must sign new players for Champions League hopes</p>

<p>The Ligue 1 champions fell short in the final last month in a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich</p>

<p>'Of course I am optimistic that we will win the Champions League. We have to because, if we don't believe it, no one is going to believe it for us,' Mbappe told Telefoot. </p>

<p>'It's football and you have to get over it. Lots of teams lost a final and won the year after. Obviously, PSG grew up with this final. Before, we had this block of the quarter-finals, now we broke that.</p>

<p>'You have to recruit well, you have to buy players. I hope we will have good recruits and that we can restart the season with the aim of doing better.'</p>

<p>'My ankle still hurts, but it's going to be like that for many weeks,' he added.</p>

<p>'I wanted to play the Champions League final at all costs. The staff have taken care of me, it's a matter of time now.</p>

<p>'I'm still getting ready to play but the coach will decide [if I can play on Tuesday]. If the coach wants me to play, it will be with great pleasure, there is nothing better than a game with your country.'</p>
