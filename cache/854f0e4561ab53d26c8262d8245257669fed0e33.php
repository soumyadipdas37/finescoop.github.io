<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A German shepherd in Texas has developed it's own bizarre way of entering rooms through open doorways. </p>

<p>Video footage recorded at his home in Austin, Texas, by owner Madeleine Fonteneau shows eight-year-old Jackson performing his unusual entrance.</p>

<p>In the clip, Jackson approaches an open doorway and peeks inside to check who is in the room.</p>

<p>Eight-year-old Jackson wanders up to a doorway and peeks inside to see who is in the room before spinning around on the spot to face away from the open door at his home in Austin, Texas</p>

<p>He then spins around on the spot so that he is facing away from the open doorway.</p>

<p>Jackson then walks backwards into the room, with his tail wagging, before bumping into the bed where Madeleine is filming from.</p>

<p>He then turns round again and launches himself up onto the bed.</p>

<p>The video was recorded on August 27 and Madeleine said that while Jackson's trick was entertaining, he doesn't do it through every doorway.</p>

<p>Madeleine adopted Jackson from an ex-boyfriend where he had been spending a lot of time in a dark apartment with a bad hip.</p>

<p>Jackson then walks backwards into the room before bumping into the bed. He turns back round and launches himself onto the bed where owner Madeleine Fonteneau is sat</p>

<p>Now though, Madeleine said: 'Just a few months later, he's really come out of his shell! </p>

<p>'We go hiking all the time, and we're currently on our first road trip! It's been great getting to see his personality shine.'</p>

<p>Jackson has other unique habits as well, including burying his head among blankets, fitting Madeleine's other dog's head in his mouth and being afraid of getting into cars.</p>

<p>But Madeleine said: 'He's an incredible boy, and I feel really lucky to spend my life with this handsome weirdo!'</p>
