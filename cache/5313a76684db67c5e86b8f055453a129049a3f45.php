<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Saracens take on Leinster in Dublin on Saturday afternoon in the Heineken Champions Cup quarter-final.</p>

<p>It is a repeat of the European competition's final last year, but victors Saracens have been embroiled in controversy since then while Leinster have won all 25 games since. </p>

<p>Sir Clive Woodward gives his verdict on the mouth-watering Euro showdown...</p>

<p>Saracens will look to Maro Itoje for leadership in their European quarter-final vs Leinster</p>

<p> WHICH PACK WILL DOMINATE?</p>

<p>The recent success of Saracens and Leinster has been based on their rock solid set piece, forward power and strength in contact.</p>

<p>Within that is a fascinating clash between two of the world’s best locks — Maro Itoje and James Ryan — who should be the Lions pairing next summer.</p>

<p>Both are identikit modern-day locks: athletic, strong but not too bulky, superlative in the line-out, jackals at the breakdown, good going forward and physical in the tackle. They are totem pole players who define their sides.</p>

<p>In the absence of Owen Farrell, Saracens will look to Itoje for leadership which introduces another little subplot.</p>

<p>Warren Gatland will soon be considering options for his Lions skipper. The first criteria is you must be an automatic first choice. There are not too many of those but Itoje is the first name on the sheet, closely followed by Ryan!</p>

<p>Owen Farrell will not feature against Leinster after receiving a five-match ban for a high tackle</p>

<p>WHO WILL HAVE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL HALF-BACK? </p>

<p>The absence of Farrell will hit Saracens hard. His big-game experience and world-class kicking will be missed as well as his intensity and game management.</p>

<p>But no one player makes a team. Saracens have moved the experienced and talented Alex Goode from 15 to No 10 where he played in both their Pool matches against Glasgow.</p>

<p>Crucially Richard Wigglesworth returns at scrum-half and I can see him taking on even more responsibility than usual.</p>

<p>Talented and experienced Alex Goode is capable of stepping up in Farrell's absence in Dublin</p>

<p>Johnny Sexton is Leinster’s attacking fulcrum, goal-kicker and pulls the strings tactically.</p>

<p>Saracens are aware their entire season depends on progressing in Europe. They have had a long time to prepare but that doesn’t necessarily make it any easier to defend against Sexton, Garry Ringrose and Robbie Henshaw.</p>

<p>BATTLE OF THE COACHES </p>

<p>This is a great match-up — the impressive Leo Cullen and rejuvenated Stuart Lancaster going head to head with Mark McCall and Alex Sanderson.</p>

<p>Covid-19 issues apart, Leinster have enjoyed the smoothest of seasons and are unbeaten in all competitions. They start as favourites but that guarantees nothing in a big European game.</p>

<p>I rate McCall as one of the best coaches in the world. England should have been chasing to get him as he is the stand-out coach in European club rugby.</p>

<p>The impressive Leo Cullen will face off against Mark McCall — one of best coaches in the world</p>

<p>McCall made Saracens incredibly difficult to beat and built a deadly, incisive attack.</p>

<p>He is a great delegator and spotter of coaching talent and absorbed all the pressure and flak that came Saracens’ way after the salary cap issue.</p>

<p>He has kept his big stars for the future, loaned out some of the young guns and introduced solid new players. And he will want to salvage a European Cup from the most testing of seasons.</p>
