<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff encouraged Trump administration officials to quit on the president in the aftermath of him not committing to a peaceful transfer of power.  </p>

<p>'If you have been debating about whether you can continue to serve the country be serving this president, you can't. It is time to resign,' Schiff said Wednesday on MSNBC's 'Rachel Maddow Show.' </p>

<p>He also encouraged former administration officials to speak out.  </p>

<p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Wednesday that Trump administration officials should 'resign' after hearing the president's comments on a peaceful transfer of power </p>

<p>President Donald Trump was asked to commit to a peaceful transfer of power earlier this week and he was non-committal </p>

<p>'And I would say to those who have been on the sidelines maintaining a dignified silence who have served in the administration in the past, you cannot maintain your silence any longer,' the California Democrat said. </p>

<p>'Because if you do wait, knowing what is to come, you will share some of the burden of responsibility for that chaos that comes,' Schiff said. </p>

<p>The top Trump foe pointed to the comments Trump made in the briefing room Wednesday, answering a question posed by Playboy columnist Brian Karem.    </p>

<p>'Win, lose or draw in this election ... will you commit here today for a peaceful transferal of power after the election?' Karem asked Trump. </p>

<p>The president wouldn't give a definitive answer.  </p>

<p>'We're going to have to see what happens,' Trump said at the briefing Wednesday.  'You know that. I have been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.' </p>

<p>Schiff pointed to the comments and said Trump's 'autocratic intentions are as clear as the writing on the wall.'   </p>

<p>On Friday, during a campaign stop in Atlanta, the president continued to raise the specter of widespread voter fraud due to mass mail-in voting, which Democrats have pushed due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>'You see they found ballots in a wastepaper basket. They found ballots dumped in a stream. Take a look at Iowa, the primaries,' the president said. 'They tried this ballot concept and they still don’t know who won. It’s a very terrible thing that’s happening, very very terrible thing,' Trump said. </p>

<p>Schiff has long annoyed Trump, but was increasingly targeted by the president for his role in the impeachment. </p>

<p>The president refers to the California lawmaker as 'Shifty Schiff.'  </p>
