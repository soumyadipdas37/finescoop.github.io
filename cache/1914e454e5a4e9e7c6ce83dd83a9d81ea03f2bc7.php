<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cardi B requested primary physical and legal custody of her and her husband Offset's daughter Kulture in a divorce petition filed Tuesday.</p>

<p>But now the Bodak Yellow hitmaker is reportedly looking to soften her approach after her lawyer filed a more aggressive petition than she expected.</p>

<p>The rapper now plans to seek a joint custody agreement with Offset, according to TMZ.</p>

<p>Softening: Cardi B, 27, plans to amend her divorce petition to request joint custody of her two-year-old daughter Kulture with her ex Offset, 28, despite originally requesting sole custody, accroding to TMZ; shown in December 2019</p>

<p>Cardi's original requests in the petition would seem to suggest she doesn't trust Offset's ability to parent their child when she's not around</p>

<p>However, sources close to her say it isn't true, and that the rapper wasn't aware her attorney was including the tough language.</p>

<p>Cardi is looking to keep the relationship amicable between her and Offset, and she has already contacted her lawyer to file an amendment for joint physical custody.</p>

<p>The original petition also requested child support from Offset, but the sources say that the amendment will exclude that language, as Cardi is making plenty of money on her own.</p>

<p>It's unclear, however, if she still wants her soon-to-be ex to pay all of her legal fees and attorney's bills during the divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>Although the Invasion Of Privacy rapper doesn't seem to have been aware of everything that was in the document, it's a common strategy for attorney's to take a maximalist position at the start, with the knowledge that they'll have to make compromises later in the divorce proceedings. </p>

<p>Change of plans: Sources close to the rapper say she didn't know her lawyer put in the sole custody language and wants an amicable parenting relationship. She also won't see child support anymore; shown in 2017</p>

<p>Although Cardi hasn't spoken publicly about her divorce yet, her husband's infidelity appears to have been the breaking point for the female rapper.</p>

<p>A source told People Tuesday: 'Offset has pretty much cheated the entire time but Cardi looked the other way because of the baby. She also didn't want to be embarrassed. But she's had enough.' </p>

<p>In the September issue of Elle, Cardi spoke about her relationship and said her marriage with Offset has 'a lot of drama.'</p>

<p>'There's always rumors about me and my husband, and I feel like people would rather start rumors because they want me to be heartbroken,' she said.</p>

<p>'They want me to be hurt. I do know that my relationship has a lot of drama and everything. But there's a lot of love, there's a lot of passion, there's a lot of trust, there's a big friendship. It's always us against the world.' </p>

<p>Had enough: Offset's infidelity was allegedly what drove her to file for divorce, though Cardi tried to ignore it for as long as possible for the sake of Kulture, People reported; pictured in 2018</p>

<p>Shock split: Cardi B filed for divorce from Offset in Superior Court, Fulton County, Georgia on Tuesday (the couple are seen here at a pre-Grammys party in January 2020) </p>

<p>The WAP rapper filed documents in Superior Court, Fulton County, Georgia on Tuesday under her real name — Belcalis Almanzar — as part of a divorce petition, according to TMZ.</p>

<p>She and Offset (real name: Kiari Cephus) married in a secret ceremony in 2017 and share two-year-old daughter Kulture.</p>

<p>In her divorce filing, Cardi B originally stated she 'is seeking primary physical custody as well as legal custody' of the couple's child. </p>

<p>The Bronx-born recording artist had previously sought child support, although TMZ states the exact amount is unclear.</p>

<p>The court documents state that 'there are no prospects for a reconciliation' and that the relationship is 'irretrievably broken.'</p>

<p>Divorce: Cardi originally requested 'primary physical custody as well as legal custody' of Kulture as well as child support and says the marriage is 'irretrievably broken' (the couple are pictured at their daughter's second birthday party)</p>

<p>However, the documents add that Cardi hopes the divorce 'will be settled by agreement of the parties', according to E! News. </p>

<p>News of the split was first reported by Hollywood Unlocked.  </p>

<p>With the incredible success of her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy, Cardi's assumed net worth is around $24 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, while 28-year-old Offset's fortune is estimated at $26 million.  </p>

<p>Despite what appeared to be an amorous relationship on social media, Offset's last appearance on his wife's Instagram was on August 20 when she shared a clip from his video, Need It. </p>

<p>Drama: Cardi previously accused Offset of infidelity in 2018. After she declared they 'grew out of love' and were 'not together anymore, he publicly pleaded with her to give him another chance (pictured November 2018)</p>

<p>Cardi previously accused Offset of infidelity in 2018 just five months after the birth of their daughter. </p>

<p>After she declared they 'grew out of love' and were 'not together anymore, Offset publicly pleaded with her to give him another chance. </p>

<p>In a lengthy post on his Instagram, he wrote: 'We're going through a lot of things right now, a lot of things in the media. I want to apologize to you Cardi. I embarrassed you. I made you go crazy.'</p>

<p>He went on: 'I was partaking in activity that I shouldn't have been partaking in, and I apologize. You know what I'm saying? For breaking your heart, for breaking our promise, for breaking God's promise and being a selfish, messed up husband.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I'm trying to be a better person..... I apologize to you Cardi. I love you.' </p>

<p>Sorry: In December 2018, Offset (pictured in January) declared on Instagram: 'I was partaking in activity that I shouldn't have been partaking in, and I apologize.... For breaking your heart, for breaking our promise, for breaking God's promise and being a selfish, messed up husband'</p>

<p>The Georgia-born rapper was allegedly also involved in a sex tape scandal with another woman in 2017.</p>

<p>Cardi and Offset did reconcile again, getting back together in 2019.</p>

<p>Responding to her critics, Cardi explained in an interview with Cosmopolitan published in April 2019 that she didn't feel she had to answer to anyone about her personal life. </p>

<p>'I know I look good, I know I'm rich, I know I'm talented,' she told the magazine. 'I know I could get any man I want — any basketball player, football player. But I want to work out my s— with my man, and I don't got to explain why.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I'm not your property. This is my life … I'm going to take my time, and I'm going to decide on my decision. It's not right, what he f***ing did — but people don't know what I did, 'cause I ain't no angel.'  </p>

<p>The details: Newly obtained documents include Cardi's divorce petition </p>

<p>Separated: The filings indicate that she and Offset have been living separately for some time</p>

<p>On his own: The Migos member has been glimpsed on Cardi's social media since mid-August</p>

<p>And earlier this year, in the January issue of Vogue, Cardi once again defended her decision to stay with Offset despite his cheating. </p>

<p>'When me and my husband got into our issues—you know, he cheated and everything—and I decided to stay with him and work together with him, a lot of people were so mad at me,' she told Vogue. 'A lot of women felt disappointed in me.'</p>

<p>But, she explained: 'If you love somebody and you stop being with them, and you're depressed and social media is telling you not to talk to that person because he cheated, you're not really happy on the inside until you have the conversation.' </p>

<p>Cardi and Offset's marriage was again rocked by rumors of his cheating in December 2019.</p>

<p>At the time, the Migos member sent a direct message to Tekashi 6ix9ine's girlfriend, who later publicized the exchange. </p>

<p>Paying up: Cardi also requested that Offset cover all of her attorney fees and legal costs throughout the divorce proceedings</p>

<p>Splitting: The two apparently don't have a prenuptial agreement, so Cardi is requesting that all assets earned during their marriage be split</p>

<p>Debts: She's also asking that any debts they accrued during the marriage be split</p>

<p>But Cardi came to her husband's defense and claimed his account had been hacked.</p>

<p>'You know, I know babe, you've done some dumb s**t," Cardi said in an Instagram Live video from December.</p>

<p> 'Everybody knows he's done some dumb s**t. But come on now, [he's] not dumb, he's not crazy, we've been so good, we had a sweet weekend, our life has been good, he's not going to play himself like that. That's why I'm not going to entertain that, that's why I'm not getting rowdy. Simple as that.'</p>

<p>Her most recent hit with Meg Thee Stallion reached the No. 1 spot on Billboard charts and has received more than 93 million streams online. </p>

<p>Offset, who's real name is Kiari Kendrell Cephus, has three children with other women: Kalea Marie Cephus, Kody Cephus and Jordan Cephus. </p>

<p>Cardi's divorce filings indicate that she and Offset have been living separately for some time.</p>

<p>The two apparently don't have a prenuptial agreement, so Cardi is requesting that all assets earned during their marriage be split, as well as any debts accrued during that time. </p>
