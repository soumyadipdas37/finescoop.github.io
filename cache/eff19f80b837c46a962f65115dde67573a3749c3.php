<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Beauty subscription service Ipsy is facing backlash for unveiling Khloe Kardashian as the new face of the brand.</p>

<p>While some customers fond of the reality star welcomed the news, many expressed their disappointment with the choice referencing Khloe's ever-changing appearance using Photoshop and her rumored plastic surgery. </p>

<p>Ipsy announced the news on their Facebook page on Monday evening, writing: 'Meet our newest brand partner Khloé Kardashian! Here’s everything you need to know about her passion for beauty:'</p>

<p>Ipsy unveiled Khloe Kardashian as the new face of their brand on Monday and the decision was met with a lot of backlash </p>

<p>The company shared a link to their blog with a lengthy description of Khloe's love for beauty products and list of must-have cosmetic items.</p>

<p>The post quickly garnered dozens of comments from customers, many of them negative.</p>

<p>'Her passion for beauty was a whole new face..' one person quipped.</p>

<p>Another disappointed beauty-lover wrote, 'Ipsy we want a real woman someone relatable, someone with a real face, someone that is humble. This isn't it, she isn't it. Do better Ipsy.' </p>

<p>'I'll pass on all things beauty from someone who chops and screws her face for sport and then still need to photoshop every pic' came another unimpressed response.</p>

<p>'Do better Ipsy': The announcement immediately garnered dozens of comments from customers, many of them negative</p>

<p>Mixed response: While some customers fond of the reality star welcomed the news, many expressed their disappointment with the choice</p>

<p>Ipsy is a customizable service that ships glam bags filled with beauty and makeup products to subscribers for a monthly fee ranging from $12 to $37. </p>

<p>Some customers considered canceling their subscriptions following the Khloe news.</p>

<p>'I guess it's time to cancel my subsciption. Will not support anything Kardashian/ Jenner. So disaapointing. Smdh' read one comment from an unimpressed Facebook user.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Khloe's appearance in the Ipsy promotional photos also raised questions.</p>

<p>'THAT'S KHLOE? I didn't recognize her. So, is her new beauty product line about changing how you look? No thanx. Comm'on Ipsy - I thought you were all about everyday women bringing out their best? I suddenly feel out of place.'  </p>

<p>Unrecognizable: Some customers questioned Khloe's appearance in the Ipsy images and considered canceling their subscription to the service </p>

<p>Khloe is that you? One of the promotional snaps for Khloe's new gig drew comparisons to Beyonce</p>

<p>Looks familiar: There was more than one post on Twitter comparing the E! star to Beyonce</p>

<p>Her sultry brunette styling with the vivid pink and red background led to some fans making comparisons to Beyonce in her music video for Check On It.</p>

<p>While another Twitter user accused the star of going 'full-on Beyonce drag'. </p>

<p>Khloe is no stranger to criticism for her changing looks, most of the time in snaps she shares to her Instagram account.</p>

<p>The most infamous of which came in May when she posted a photo from a KUWTK shoot, showing off her bronze figure in a white corset top.</p>

<p>But it was her face that puzzled her fans most as it appeared to be slimmed down and her eyes seemed to be a different shape and angled differently than usual.</p>

<p>Real? Khloe, 36, has been accused of editing her photos on social media to the point of being unrecognizable </p>

<p>Editing wizardry: In August Khloe became the center of another photoshopping scandal after a scene from KUWTK was aired (right) in which she looked nothing like a snap she shared from the shoot two months earlier (left)</p>

<p>Then in August the untouched images were revealed when the scene aired on the E! show and one viewer immediately took a screengrab to do a side-by-side comparison with highly photoshopped image on social media.</p>

<p>In June a source told Us Weekly that Khloe doesn't care what people think about her appearance.</p>

<p>'Khloe doesn’t care about the backlash she's been getting from fans saying she doesn't look like herself in her recent photos. </p>

<p>'She thinks she looks great. And actually [she] does not care what people think as long as she's happy.'</p>

<p>Khloe also seems to have a sense of humor about it as she clapped back at a fan who asked why she looked so different by joking: 'My weekly face transplant clearly.' </p>

<p>'She thinks she looks great': In June a source told Us Weekly that Khloe doesn't care what people think about her appearance or the backlash she gets from the photos she posts</p>
