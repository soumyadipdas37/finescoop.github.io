<p>Twist ending: As fans prepare to watch The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert choose his winner, The Wash is reporting that this year's season finale will be a little different from previous years</p>

<p>Filming multiple endings is common for competitive reality shows, such as Seven's My Kitchen Rules, but has never been done on The Bachelor before.</p>

<p>The Wash reports that the method was used this season to prevent loose-lipped crew members from leaking spoilers to the press.</p>

<p>If true, it would have been an extremely awkward task for Locky, who would have had to tell one of the women he was in love with her on camera, only to break it to her afterwards he'd actually chosen someone else.  </p>

<p>Awkward: Locky reportedly filmed two different 'winner's endings': one with Bella Varelis and the other with Irena Srbinovska. The method was supposedly used this season to prevent loose-lipped crew members from leaking spoilers to the press</p>

<p>'Producers wanted to really change it up this year and confuse viewers and keep the suspense. It also made sure no one on set would leak the ending,' a source said. </p>

<p>'So they filmed two endings, one where Bella wins and one where Irena wins, so most of the crew wouldn’t actually know who wins.' </p>

<p>They added: 'Locky was also told to look confused and to have a bit of an emotional moment for the cameras like he couldn’t make up his mind. This was all planned.' </p>

<p>Fake news? a Channel 10 spokesperson denied this was the case, however, saying: 'The claim that two endings were filmed is false and misleading. There was only one ending filmed'</p>

<p>'The claim that two endings of The Bachelor Australia were filmed is false and misleading. There was only one ending filmed,' they said. </p>

<p>The method of filming two endings has been used on MKR and MasterChef for years, meaning that the winners only learn the outcome along with the rest of the country.  </p>
