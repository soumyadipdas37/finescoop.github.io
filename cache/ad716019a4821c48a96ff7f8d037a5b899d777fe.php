<p>The thrilling announcement comes after Jesy received an outpouring of love and support from fans following her emotional BBC performance.</p>

<p>Emotional: It comes after Jesy, 29, suffered a panic attack during her Radio One Live Lounge performance with her band (pictured)</p>

<p>The songstress was joined by her bandmates at the London studios, but had to leave the stage after breaking down in tears.   </p>

<p>Following their incredible live rendition of new single, Holiday, Jesy began to tear up and held up her hands to show that she was visibly shaking. </p>

<p>Although the girls had been trying to adhere to social distancing, Jade broke the rules in order to comfort Jesy. </p>

<p>The band then left the stage together before a member of production was seen heading to talk to the star.  </p>

<p>Supported: Fans were quick to check if the singer was ok and her bandmate supported her on stage</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Candid: Explaining the incident to her concerned fans, Jesy later took to Instagram to share a video from rehearsals as she revealed she had suffered a panic attack</p>

<p>The cameras livestreaming the performance were immediately cut off, but started up again later when Jesy returned to the stage and bravely finished the gig.  </p>

<p>Explaining the incident to her concerned fans, Jesy later took to Instagram to share a video from rehearsals as she revealed: 'So I had panic attack right before we were about to sing this for live lounge today and like a pro <?php echo e('@'); ?>perrieedwards jumped in for my part last minute and smashed it this is what we originally did in rehearsals'. </p>

<p>Jesy - who has spoken candidly about her struggles with anxiety and depression - was immediately comforted by fans, who took to Twitter to express their love for her.</p>

<p>Fans penned: 'proud of jesy for quickly pulling herself together and proceeding to sing her heart out, it isnt easy to just snap out of it on the spot when anxiety takes over. i hope she knows she has our endless love and support.' </p>

<p>Late last year, Jesy revealed that horrific trolling - which clouded her perception of success - left her in a 'deep depression' and even caused her to attempt suicide.</p>

<p>She spoke candidly about her mental health struggles in BBC documentary, Odd One Out, which broke a viewing record for BBC Three and won a National Television Award. </p>

<p>Six months on from the documentary, Jesy gave an interview with MailOnline in March, as she admitted is 'still working on herself' but is now 'mentally stronger'.  </p>
