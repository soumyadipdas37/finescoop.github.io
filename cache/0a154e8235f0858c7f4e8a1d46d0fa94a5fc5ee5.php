<p>The Good Morning Britain host, 55, is set to discuss the former footballer's difficult past 12 months and he will mark the first time a guest has returned to the ITV show. </p>

<p>Piers described how the interview will make for 'very powerful' viewing after Vinnie, 55, last appeared on the show in 2010 with his wife Tanya sitting in the audience. </p>

<p>Open: Piers Morgan has revealed that his upcoming Life Stories interview with Vinnie Jones is set to be 'very emotional' after the actor lost his wife Tanya to skin cancer last year</p>

<p>Speaking of the upcoming episode, Piers said: 'The last time I interviewed Vinnie on Life Stories, Tanya was sitting in the audience. But as he says, his life has now been two lives. </p>

<p>'One with Tanya, and one that he is trying to build now after Tanya. And I think that’s going to make for a very powerful show.' </p>

<p>Piers, who has known Vinnie for 30 years, described the GMB interview following Tanya's death in July 2019 as 'one of the most emotional we’ve ever had on the show'.  </p>

<p>Honest: Piers described how the interview will make for 'very powerful' viewing after Vinnie, 55, last appeared on the show in 2010 with his wife Tanya sitting in the audience</p>

<p>Speaking about Life Stories, he added: 'So, I think it’s guaranteed to be very emotional for obvious reasons but I also think it’s going to be incredibly inspiring too. </p>

<p>'Vinnie is very keen about trying to help others who are going through the same hell he has been going through.' </p>

<p>Piers revealed how producers decided to feature Vinnie for a second time on the show after he released a 'remarkable book', Lost Without You: Loving and Losing Tanya.  </p>

<p>'Ups and downs': The pair first met when Piers was a local reporter with Vinnie playing for the Wimbledon 'as part of their infamous Crazy Gang'</p>

<p>'I knew Tanya for a long time and observed at first hand the extraordinary marriage that they had, through thick and thin for many years, and then ultimately their wonderful love story ending in complete tragedy,' Piers explained.  </p>

<p>'I felt when I read this book that Vinnie has done, it’s just so powerful. So eloquent, so moving, so inspiring.'  </p>

<p>However Piers admitted that he has experienced 'ups and downs' with the Snatch actor after the pair first met when he was a local reporter with Vinnie playing for Wimbledon 'as part of their infamous Crazy Gang'. </p>

<p>Close: Piers described how Vinnie is 'a bundle of energy' and regards him as 'one of the most charismatic people you’ll ever meet' </p>

<p>The presenter continued: 'Over the years I’ve employed Vinnie as a columnist, then had to fire him – he talks about that in his previous autobiography at great length – and I’ve been in a nightclub when someone has come up behind me and nearly throttled me to death and I’ve suddenly realised it was Vinnie. </p>

<p>'So it’s fair to say we’ve had our ups and downs, but in the last few years I’ve got to know Vinnie really well by playing golf with him in LA where we both play at the same course regularly together and we’ve become great friends.'   </p>

<p>Yet Piers described how Vinnie is 'a bundle of energy' and regards him as 'one of the most charismatic people you’ll ever meet'.  </p>

<p>Tragic: Tanya passed away at the couple's Los Angeles home last year aged 53, the couple had been together for 27 years (pictured in 2007)</p>

<p>The return of Life Stories is set to feature Captain Sir Tom Moore who is the 100-year-old Army veteran who raised nearly £32.8 million for NHS charities during lockdown.</p>
