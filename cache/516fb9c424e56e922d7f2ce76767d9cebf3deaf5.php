<p>Ellie-Jean Coffey - a Sydney-based model and surfer best known for her provocative social media posts - has opened up for the first time about the years of misogyny she endured during her surf career</p>

<p>The 25-year-old competed on the World Surf League's qualifying series for years after being picked up by sponsors at just 14</p>

<p>'At first I thought and believed I was the luckiest girl in the world to be living such a life, and not long after that, the darker side of the surfing industry soon revealed itself to me, and it was terrifying,' Coffey told news.com.au.</p>

<p>'The abuse, both mentally and physically, I endured during my teenage years far away from home with adults in positions of power has haunted me my whole life.' </p>

<p>Coffey described her career as 'horrible' and said it has taken her years to recover.</p>

<p>After leaving the surf world, the 25-year-old underwent 'intensive therapy' after the abuse almost 'drove her to ending her life'.</p>

<p>Only close family and friends knew of Coffey's suffering and said it would have been easier to recover if more women had highlighted the 'toxic' surfing industry.</p>

<p>The Instagram model revealed managers and people in positions of power often abused many young girls.</p>

<p>'As much as I loved surfing, I just completely broke down. I couldn't continue with all the abuse; it almost drove me to suicide, and I was lucky to go get that therapy and recover from it. And I know a lot of girls in the industry who have a very similar story,' she said.</p>

<p>Her dream career quickly turned dark as she started to experience a 'male-dominated' industry rife with abuse that has haunted her since </p>

<p>Coffey described her career as 'horrible' and said it has taken her hears to recover </p>

<p>Coffey left the professional circuit in 2017 but still surfs for fun while travelling Australia's east coast.</p>

<p>She recently launched her own personal website where subscribers pay a monthly fee to see her adult content and interact with her, which she says is the 'best decision' she has ever made.</p>

<p>In July last year Coffey was left 'disgusted' when a man in his 50s asked her to consider embarking on a 'swinging throuple' relationship. </p>

<p>The blonde took to social media to address the reason behind her outrage after revealing she was attracted to both men and women. </p>

<p>'I seriously just think that what sucks about ''coming out'' as bisexual is that people do automatically assume you have massive orgies and sleep with couples,' Ms Coffey posted on Instagram.</p>

<p>She said the idea that all bisexual people enjoyed threesomes was a 'stereotype'.</p>

<p>'There's absolutely nothing wrong with that... and look yes even if that is the case for me I do think a bit of respect goes a long way,' she continued.  </p>

<p>'Would appreciate it if everyone just realised I am still quite young and most of you are fantastic about it but for other bisexual girls the need to instantly sexualise them is not cool.</p>

<p>'It's a big deal to come out and for the first question to be something like ''oh you f*** other couples'' is a little insensitive, something along the lines of ''hey we support you and appreciate who you are'' is the kind of response that is so needed.' </p>

<p>Coffey said she knows her social media content may be eyebrow raising to some, but doesn't believe anybody has a right to make her feel uncomfortable </p>

<p>Rising! The four Coffee sisters - Ruby-Lee, Bonnie-Lou, Ellie-Jean, 24, and Holly-Daze, 21 - are rising stars in professional surfing in addition to being 'Instagram famous'. Pictured left to right: Bonnie-Lou, 16, Ellie-Jean, 24, Holly-Daze, 21, and Ruby-Lee, 19 </p>

<p>Ouch! The 24-year-old from Sydney's northern beaches previously described herself as 'single as f**k' and said she was 'ready to mingle'</p>

<p>Ms Coffey admitted her social media content could be considered eyebrow raising to some, but said she didn't believe anyone had a right to make her feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>'To be honest I am putting out what I'm putting out and anyone can say what they want to say … it shouldn't give people permission to write what they write.'</p>

<p>The model is one of the Coffey sisters who were nicknamed the 'Kardashians of Australian surfing', and it's easy to see why.</p>

<p>Her three sisters - Ruby-Lee, Bonnie-Lou, and Holly-Daze, 21 - are rising stars in professional surfing in addition to being 'Instagram famous'. </p>

<p>Previously speaking to Daily Mail Australia, the siblings hit back at critics who say they shouldn't share so many bikini-clad photos online. </p>

<p>Speaking on behalf of the family, Holly-Daze said that their behaviour is nothing out of the ordinary for Australian women who enjoy the beach lifestyle. </p>

<p>'We don't really care what your opinion is, we just do it, and we're okay with it,' Holly-Daze said. 'If you don't like it, don't look at it. So many girls are doing it - and guys.'</p>
