<p>Surfer girl: Abbie Chatfield tried her hand at surfing on Thursday. The 25-year-old former Bachelor hopeful enrolled in a day course with Get Wet Surf School on the Gold Coast</p>

<p>Despite thinking she 'did okay' out in the water, Abbie asked instructors Sami and Blake for a 'review', filming the whole interaction for Instagram Stories.   </p>

<p>'She's as good as she is at surfing as she is at dancing,' deadpanned Sami, prompting Abbie to respond, 'Okay, bit of shade, but that's fine.' </p>

<p>Blake said a photo of him facepalming himself while out in the surf with Abbie summed up the experience for him.</p>

<p>Helping hands: Despite thinking she 'did okay' out in the water, Abbie asked instructors Sami (centre) and Blake (right) for a 'review', filming the whole interaction for Instagram Stories</p>

<p>'She's as good as she is at surfing as she is at dancing,' deadpanned Sami, prompting Abbie to respond, 'Okay, bit of shade, but that's fine'</p>

<p>Taking it all in her stride, the reality star laughed at their assessments of her surfing ability, as photos of her out in the water flashed up on a screen behind them.</p>

<p>The surf school also posted a series of photos of Abbie during her lesson, and said what she lacked in skill, she made up for in 'energy and enthusiasm'.  </p>

<p>'Such a pleasure meeting the beautiful <?php echo e('@'); ?>abbiechatfield today,' they captioned the photos. </p>

<p>Practice makes perfect: In one photo, Abbie was seen practicing to stand up on her surfboard on a patch of grass, before taking it into the water</p>

<p>That bad? Blake said a photo of him facepalming himself while out in the surf with Abbie summed up the experience for him</p>

<p>'Your energy and enthusiasm was contagious. Can't wait to get you back out there'.</p>
