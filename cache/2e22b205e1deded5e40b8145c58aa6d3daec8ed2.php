<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Alexis Sanchez has pointed the finger of blame for his torrid time at Manchester United, revealing that he wanted to leave the club after only one training session following his move from Arsenal in 2018.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old, speaking in a shocking Instagram video, confirmed a Manchester City transfer fell through before he joined United and admitted that he asked to move back to Arsenal after just one day under Jose Mourinho. </p>

<p>Alexis Sanchez has lifted the lid on his time at Manchester United with some shocking truths</p>

<p>The Chilean revealed he asked his agent to move him back to Arsenal after one training session</p>

<p>Sanchez said: 'I want to tell you about my period at United, about many things that were said and that made me look bad. </p>

<p>'I got the opportunity to go to United and it seemed tempting to me. It was something nice for me, because when I was a kid I liked that club a lot.</p>

<p>'I ended up signing without much information about what was happening in the move. The first days that I was with my colleagues, sometimes there are things that you do not realise until you arrive. </p>

<p>'The first training I had I realised many things. home and I told my representative: "Can't the contract be terminated to return to Arsenal?"</p>

<p>Mi etapa en el Manchester United ha terminado y sólo tengo palabras de agradecimiento, aclaro y cierro éste tema.⚽️. My time at Manchester United has finished and I only have words to say thank you, I clarify and close it. ⚽️</p>

<p>Sanchez was signed by Manchester United in 2018 and earned around £560,000-a-week</p>

<p>'They start laughing and I told them that something did not sit right with me. It had already been signed.' </p>

<p>Sanchez recalled one moment at Manchester United when he was left out of the matchday squad by Mourinho for a game against West Ham in September 2018. </p>

<p>It was an incredible fall from grace for the Chilean winger, who just nine months ago was one of the most dangerous attacking players in England's top flight while at Arsenal.  </p>

<p>The 31-year-old was brought to Manchester United from Arsenal by Jose Mourinho (middle)</p>

<p>Sanchez revealed his shock at being dropped by Mourinho (above) for a defeat to West Ham</p>

<p>The Chilean said: 'In a game with West Ham I wasn't picked. That had never happened to me as a player. It bothered me and I said it couldn't be possible. </p>

<p>'To go from being one of the best in the Premier League to not playing in five months. I came to my house and I was very sad. The next day I trained in a double shift, because I love what I do.'</p>

<p>Manchester United lost the West Ham game 3-1 and Mourinho was sacked just months later with the Red Devils languishing in mid-table. Sanchez then took the opportunity to speak to his successor, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, about a move away.</p>

<p>Sanchez has thrived since joining Inter Milan in 2019 and recently made his move permanent</p>

<p>Sanchez added: 'Then the next coach arrived, the current one, and I decided to talk to him. I told him that I needed to take a breather, and the opportunity to go to Inter. He told me that yes, there was no problem.'  </p>

<p>The winger scored 80 goals in 166 matches at Arsenal before moving to Old Trafford in a swap for Henrikh Mhkitaryan in January 2018, a blockbuster move that was announced in a now infamous social media video of him apparently playing 'Glory Glory Man United' on the piano.</p>

<p>Sanchez's extraordinary contract cost United up to £560,000 per week, once all aspects of that four-and-a-half-year deal were factored in.</p>

<p>He earned a basic salary of £300,000 per week, plus an additional net payment of £100,000 per week from a £5million-a-year image rights deal.</p>

<p>United also paid £5m in agent's fees over the course of the contract to the player's representative Fernando Felicevich.</p>

<p>The club inserted a £5m clause into the deal, payable if Sanchez made 30 starts in a single season. Additional bonuses and employers' national insurance payments took the potential overall figure to £560,000 per week if Sanchez was successful.</p>

<p>The player admitted the comments made by certain media outlets made him angry during his time at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>He said: 'Journalists spoke without knowing and it bothered me, it hurt. Former players spoke who had no idea of ​​anything that was happening inside the club and gave their opinion damaging you, that it was your fault. </p>

<p>The Chilean was one of the Premier League's top attackers while he was at Arsenal</p>

<p>'Since they had to blame one, they blamed me.' </p>

<p>United legend Gary Neville was among those who were critical of Sanchez during his spell at Old Trafford. </p>

<p>'Sanchez has been an absolute disaster,' Neville said on Sky Sports in 2019. 'I have no idea what’s happened to him. There must be two of them.</p>

<p>'The one that’s turned up in Manchester I have no idea who that is. (Solskjaer) needs to get him out of the club.' </p>

<p>Neville also blamed Sanchez for the poor form of other players, notably Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.</p>

<p>'Mourinho brought Alexis Sanchez into the club and look at what’s happened to them since Alexis Sanchez came in,' Neville said in May 2018. </p>

<p>'If you look at the actual stats and you think about before Sanchez arrived at the club, they were playing quite a bit of football, they were scoring goals and contributing, they had assists.</p>

<p>'But since Alexis Sanchez has come to the club, obviously he’s played a lot of the games, and look what’s happened.</p>

<p>'There’s been a big impact negatively, so they’ve [Rashford and Martial] got to get back to the standards they were setting earlier in the season and what they’re capable of.'</p>

<p>Paul Scholes is another United great who was scathing of Sanchez.</p>

<p>'His performances, well they have to improve. They can't get any worse to be honest with you,' said Scholes on BT Sport after united's FA Cup final defeat by Chelsea in 2018. </p>

<p>Sanchez ended the video by revealing he wanted his time at Manchester United to work out, but he has grown from the situation.</p>

<p>'I only have words of thanks to United for giving me the opportunity to defend the shirt,' said Sanchez. 'It bothered me that things did not go the way I wanted. </p>

<p>'If the atmosphere had been more positive, it would have turned out differently. I tell it all now because I have already passed a period of learning as a player and a person. I would have liked to win everything.' </p>
