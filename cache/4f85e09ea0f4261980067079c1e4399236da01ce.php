<p>'C'est bon,' he captioned the photo, followed by a love heart emoji.</p>

<p>The Australian comedian, 40, made her red carpet debut with Jacob at a gala in Monaco this week. </p>

<p>Jacob's family founded the Anheuser-Busch brewery, which produces America's most popular beer, Budweiser.</p>

<p>Great catch! Rebel, 40, hit the jackpot with her handsome new boyfriend Jacob, 29, who is not only 11 years her junior but also filthy rich too</p>

<p>In 2016, Forbes listed the Busch family as the 16th richest in America, with a fortune of US$13.4billion.  </p>

<p>While it's unclear how much of that will be inherited by Jabob, his current personal net worth has been estimated at US$100million. </p>

<p>At one point, the family even owned their own elephant named Budweiser. </p>

<p>In 2017, the young entrepreneur launched his own beer called Sons Beer with best friends Carlo Mondavi and Elliott Taylor.</p>

<p>Despite branching out on his own, Jacob is still very much involved with his family's charity, the Busch Family Foundation, which benefits the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and The Boys and Girls Club.</p>

<p>Jacob and Rebel's 11-year age gap shouldn't be a problem for the 29-year-old, who previously dated Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof, 59.</p>

<p>The former couple started dating when Jacob was just 24, and their on-again/off-again relationship lasted for several years until they eventually split for good.</p>
