<p>Dr Nick Coatsworth said 'we cannot assume' that Covid-19 will behave like flu and decrease in warmer weather.</p>

<p>He warned that hotter weather will lead to more people moving around and gathering in crowds which could cause the disease to spread.</p>

<p>'We have to be clear that we do not yet know the impact of the seasons on Covid-19,' Dr Coatsworth said in the press conference on Wednesday. </p>

<p>'We absolutely cannot assume that because we're moving into the summer months, when other respiratory viruses traditionally decrease, that COVID-19 would also decrease.'</p>

<p>Dr Coatsworth said summer posed two problems for public health. </p>

<p>'One is movement of people across cities, across states, and the second one is crowds,' he said. </p>

<p>'If we can't assume COVID-19 will be any less transmitted, we have to assume the in crowds will potentially bring risk.'</p>

<p>He warned Australians to stay alert, keep distancing and get tested if they fall ill. </p>

<p>'So the message is, as we move into the summer months, treat the summer with as much caution as you've treated winter,' he said.</p>

<p>'And that means keep physical distance. That means get tested if you're at all unwell. Don't go to a family gathering down at the beach if you're unwell or the kids are unwell. Stay at home and get yourself tested.'</p>
