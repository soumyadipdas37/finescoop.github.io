<p>Dinner at dusk: Rachel McAdams, 41, and her partner Jamie Linden, 40, enjoyed a romantic dinner in an LA park on Wednesday evening</p>

<p>Underneath her cardigan, Rachel wore a white shirt covered in black dots, as well as a pair of dark jeans.</p>

<p>She added a casual note to her look with black sneakers, and she wore her wavy brunette locks down over her shoulders. </p>

<p>The To The Wonder actress carried along a water bottle, and she wasn't taking any chances with the coronavirus thanks to her black mask and a tub of disinfectant wipes wedge under her arm.</p>

<p>Jamie also had a low-key look with a green T-shirt and a black zip-up sweatshirt, along with dark jeans and black trainers.</p>

<p>After cleaning up a picnic table, the two dug into their meals.</p>

<p>Rachel tied up her long hair into a top knot and held it with a scrunchy she had worn on her wrist.</p>

<p>The couple share a two-year-old son whose name has never been announced, but they seemed to have left him wit a sitter for their date night in the park.</p>

<p>Though Rachel is Canadian, and the two split their time between Toronto and LA, they're likely stuck on the West Coast at least through November, as the border between Canada and the US has been closed to most non-essential travel for months, and is likely to be extended into November. </p>

<p>Rachel and Jamie have been together since 2016, and they welcomed their son in April 2018.</p>

<p>Although she's extremely protective of her son's privacy, the actress shared some rare information about her family life during a COVID-19 fundraiser for healthcare workers that was hosted via video chat.</p>

<p>When asked how she was spending her days in quarantine, Rachel said, 'I have a very welcome distraction in my son, who is 2.</p>

<p>"That's pretty much what I do all the time,' she added.</p>

<p>'He's so entertaining,' she continued. 'I thought, "Would I rather be alone in quarantine or with my family?" There are days, sure, but I would be so bored without him around to make it so fun.'</p>
