<p>The actor said 'it's really wonderful' and shared that he and his wife felt 'blessed that they could just nest as a family.' </p>

<p>Jude and Phillipa, 33, who were first spotted together at the Hay literary festival in 2015.  </p>

<p>They got married at Old Marylebone Town Hall in London last year before partying in Mayfair – three months after the actor announced their engagement.</p>

<p>Out and about: Jude and Phillipa stepped out in London on June 9, before the baby was born </p>

<p>Their baby news was revealed in May. </p>

<p>After the baby news came to light, a friend of the couple said: ‘He and Phillipa are blissfully happy together and delighted to add to their family. Everyone is really excited for the new arrival.’</p>

<p>Jude was previously married to actress and designer Sadie Frost, but the pair divorced in 2003. They have three children – Rafferty, 23, Iris, 19, and Rudy, 17. </p>

<p>The actor also has daughter, Sophia, 10, with model Samantha Burke, and another daughter called Ada, five, with singer-songwriter Catherine Harding. </p>

<p>Way back when: Law was previously married to actress and designer Sadie Frost, but the pair divorced in 2003 (the couple pictured in 1997)</p>

<p>Hurt: His love life has been well-documented through his time in the spotlight, including his relationship with Sienna Miller, which was left in tatters when he embarked on an affair with his kids' weekend nanny in 2006 (the couple pictured in 2004)</p>

<p>Phillipa's pregnancy came months after Jude, who wed Phillipa last year, revealed that he would ‘absolutely’ be open to having more.</p>

<p>The Talented Mr Ripley actor said: ‘I love it, so absolutely why not? I’m very lucky to be involved with someone I’m madly in love with...</p>

<p>'The idea of having more children would be just wonderful. I’m fortunate to be with someone where I’m having more fun than I’ve ever had in my life. </p>

<p>‘We have an incredibly stable and healthy, wonderful family existence and that involves my kids who are young adults... and then the younger ones are just so much joy and so much fun.’</p>

<p>Sadie Frost  2 September 1997 - 29 October 2003</p>

<p>Three children - son Rafferty, 23, daughter Iris, 19, and son Rudy, 17</p>

<p>The couple met on the set of film Shopping. In what was his first major role, Jude was just 19. Sadie was a 25-year-old married mother-of-one.</p>

<p>Sadie Frost (pictured in 1996)</p>

<p>She divorced her husband, Spandau Ballet's Gary Kemp, in 1995.</p>

<p>Jude and Sadie subsequently married and have three children. In her 2010 autobiography, Crazy Days, Sadie said: 'The force of the love I felt for Jude and his intense ambition made me feel out of control'. </p>

<p>Sadie late revealed her struggle with post-natal depression was a contributing factor to her divorce from the actor. </p>

<p>She wrote in her book: 'The more I worried about my condition, the more self-obsessed I became and the less attention I gave to Jude'.</p>

<p>Sienna Miller 2004 - February 2006</p>

<p>Jude was 30 when he broke up with Sadie. Following their 2003 divorce, he met Sienna Miller while filming Alfie, in which he played the titular role. </p>

<p>Their high-profile romance came crashing down when it was revealed he had an affair with their kids' nanny Daisy Wright. </p>

<p>In his public apology to Sienna, he said: 'Following the reports in today's papers, I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I've hurt Sienna and the people most close to us. </p>

<p>'I want to publicly apologise to Sienna and our respective families for the pain that I have caused. There is no defence for my actions which I sincerely regret and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time.' </p>

<p>Daisy Wright 2006</p>

<p>Daisy was hired by Sadie and Jude in August 2004 to be a weekend nanny for their children. </p>

<p>She later revealed they had embarked on an affair while he was still in a relationship with Sienna and sold her story with many tawdry details - including one of his kids walking in on them in bed. </p>

<p>Daisy later admitted she regretted selling a kiss and tell on the star. The story was engineered by disgraced late publicist Max Clifford - who was famed for orchestrating kiss and tells to make the subject famous.  </p>

<p>After the affair was revealed, Sienna is said to have told an interviewer: 'Daisy better live in fear. </p>

<p>'I'm looking forward to the day when our paths will cross, which I know they will. I just hope that woman doesn't run into me in a dark alley!' </p>

<p>Samantha Burke 2008</p>

<p>One child - daughter Sophia, 10, born September 2009</p>

<p>Jude dated model Samantha briefly while he was filming Sherlock Holmes in 2008 and they had already split when she discovered she was pregnant. </p>

<p>Samantha Burke (pictured in 2009)</p>

<p>Speaking about Sophia, Samantha said: 'She has Jude’s chin and nose, and she does a little pout, that I notice he’s done before... There are no plans for [Jude to visit] at the moment, but I know he’s busy.'</p>

<p>On their relationship, she said: 'I ran into Jude in a nightclub one night. </p>

<p>'I instantly knew who he was, but he seemed really funny; he was cracking jokes with people and he included me in that. </p>

<p>'The next thing I knew I was on the pavement outside, being twirled around – it was a lot of fun. </p>

<p>'Following that initial meeting, Jude and I went out several times. He was a lot of fun to be around, always making me laugh and smile.' </p>

<p>Catherine Harding 2014</p>

<p>One child - daughter Ada, five, born March 2015</p>

<p>Singer songwriter Catherine- who is known as Cat Cavelli - was 23 when she dated Jude, then 41, who was filming on location in the Czech Republic as he grew close to the aspiring musician. </p>

<p>Catherine Harding (pictured in 2015)</p>

<p>She recently competed on The Voice. Ada was born after a brief romance and they had already split when they announced the pregnancy.</p>

<p>After the birth, she said: 'She looks like Jude massively, she doesn’t look like me. Jude is really funny and sweet. I remember last week he came over and he had to change her on the park bench. He cleaned her all up.</p>

<p>He is a good dad and she sees her brothers and sisters. He takes her out all the time. </p>

<p>'The birth was really painful, I only wanted my mum there, it was a C-section, it was really horrible. But he came straight after and was really amazing.'</p>
