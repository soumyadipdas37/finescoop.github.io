<p>Dr Sondra Crosby told the court about Assange's mental health during his time holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy.</p>

<p>The Boston University professor appeared from the US via video-link to describe the findings from her multiple visits.</p>

<p>Julian Assange (pictured) 'binge-watched' footage of a war criminal killing himself in court after losing his case, according to Dr Sondra Crosby</p>

<p>She said: 'When I saw him in February 2018 he first described his thoughts of suicide to me and spent quite a lot of time talking to me about how he'd been thinking about this very deliberately.</p>

<p>Dr Crosby said Assange, 49, described to her in detail how he had 'binge-watched the suicide of Slobodan Praljak, the Bosnian man who was convicted of war crimes'.</p>

<p>Praljak had killed himself on television and Assange spoke of 'how he had taken cyanide in the court and died'. </p>

<p>She said that 'Mr Assange seemed very obsessed with this' and even 'stopped in freeze-frame and analysed the man's face' as he was killing himself.</p>

<p>The witness earlier said that 'the purpose of the initial visit was as a result of an invitation of an American doctor'. </p>

<p>The doctor had 'organised an academic evaluation of the effects of living in the Ecuadorian Embassy for at that time around five and a half years'. </p>

<p>She said that when she 'initially saw Mr Assange in the embassy in October 2017 he certainly described to me symptoms of depression, PTSD'.</p>

<p>Dr Crosby said Assange described to her in detail how he had 'binge-watched the suicide of Slobodan Praljak, (pictured) the Bosnian man who was convicted of war crimes'</p>

<p>Doctor Crosby added: 'Although he was certainly functioning and was capable of conversation and not in a horrible state. </p>

<p>'Over time as I visited him again I observed his mental state was declining.</p>

<p>'He was describing more and more symptoms of depression, sleep disturbance, low mood, inability to concentrate, nightmares and just quite a lot more of psychological distress. </p>

<p>'He talks as if he was essentially dead. He was tearful and pleading for help.</p>

<p>'The suicide trigger would be extradition to the US where he felt his life would be intolerable.'</p>

<p>James Lewis for the US, said: 'It was his own decision to put himself in the embassy.'</p>

<p>Dr Crosby replied that for Assange the decision was akin to 'being chased by someone who wanted to harm him with an axe locking himself in a room and not coming out.'</p>

<p>She said when she visited Assange in prison she was 'very alarmed of his risk of systemic infection and death'. </p>

<p>She added: 'I could not convince Mr Assange to leave the embassy. I wrote to the UN high commissioner for human rights.</p>

<p>'An independent UN expert found he was suffering from psychological trauma and was in poor health which was the same conclusion I came to.' </p>

<p>Julian Assange is fighting extradition back to the US in a hearing being held at the Old Bailey</p>

<p>Assange is fighting extradition to the US, where he faces an 18-count indictment alleging a plot to hack computers and conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information.</p>

<p>Giving evidence for the US Government on Thursday, Dr Nigel Blackwood rebutted defence experts on the extent of Assange's condition, saying his suicide risk was 'manageable'.</p>

<p>He told the Old Bailey: 'Mr Assange has proved himself to be a very resilient and very resourceful man and he has underplayed that.'</p>

<p>Dr Blackwood told the court it was important to consider Assange’s day-to-day functioning beyond what he says about his symptoms.</p>

<p>Assange got involved with painting, reading, exercise, and interacted well with others, he said.</p>
