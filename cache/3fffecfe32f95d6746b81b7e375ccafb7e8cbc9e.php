<p>The right back looked guilty as he hovered over the first post which read: 'I love Arsenal forever and ever.'</p>

<p>After deleting the first tweet, Doherty looked sheepishly at the camera before finding the next post in which he said: 'Yes I'm a HUGE Arsenal fan.'</p>

<p>That was also removed before the 28-year-old nodded his head in approval and tapped the Spurs badge to signal his loyalty to his new club.</p>
