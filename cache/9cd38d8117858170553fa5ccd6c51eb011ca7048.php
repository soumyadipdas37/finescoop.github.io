<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Charities reacted with fury last night after a minister confirmed Boris Johnson’s much-vaunted social care plan will not be released until next year. </p>

<p>Lord Bethell, a health minister in the Lords, said he could not commit to a plan by the end of 2020. </p>

<p>When he became Prime Minister in July last year, Mr Johnson said he had a plan to end the social care scandal ‘once and for all’. </p>

<p>The latest delay means older people will have waited for at least 18 months before the social care plan is released</p>

<p>But the latest delay means older people will have waited for at least 18 months for the plan before it is released. </p>

<p>Last night Caroline Abrahams, charity director at age UK, said: ‘Older people will understand the Government has its hands full at the moment, trying to contain what looks horribly like the beginning of a “second wave”. </p>

<p>'But they may also be reflecting on the fact that once again, a government that promised much on social care has so far delivered nothing at all.’ </p>

<p>Lord Bethell, (pictured) a health minister in the Lords, said he could not commit to publishing a plan for the future funding and provision of social care by the end of 2020</p>

<p>It is understood Downing street has returned to the drawing board after going cool on the idea of a cap on the costs of care. </p>

<p>The Prime Minister is now looking at a plan based on the pensions system, with people getting basic care for free but with the ability to pay more for better care.  </p>

<p>Under the scheme, championed by Theresa May’s former deputy Damian Green, the elderly would pay more if they wanted larger rooms in a care home, more appetising meals or more frequent trips.</p>

<p>At question time in the Lords, Lord Bethell said it would require a ‘huge amount of political collaboration’ and was likely to take longer.</p>

<p>The minister was replying to Labour’s Baroness Thornton who asked him to commit to publishing a plan for the future funding and provision of social care by the end of this year.</p>

<p>She also called for a clear social care winter plan to ensure no one with Covid-19 was discharged from a hospital into a care home ‘to prevent a repeat of the terrible impact this had in the first months of this crisis’.</p>

<p>Lord Bethell said: ‘I cannot commit to a social care plan before the end of the year.</p>

<p>‘This is something that will require a huge amount of political collaboration and I suspect it will take longer than the next few months.’</p>

<p>File Image: Caroline Abrahams, charity director at age UK has said 'with so much death and suffering in care homes to date there is absolutely no room for complacency'</p>

<p>He said there was a £600million infection control fund to help social care through the winter and tackle the spread of coronavirus in care homes.</p>

<p>Under England’s broken social care system, people pay the full cost of their care until their assets - including the value of their home - fall to below £23,250.</p>

<p>It leaves many families unable to pass on much inheritance to their children.</p>

<p>Ms Abrahams said: ‘The immediate priority for the government as regards social care ought to be implementing a fully-funded Winter Plan that gives care providers, older people and their families the confidence to believe they can get through the next few months in a lot better shape than during the pandemic so far.</p>

<p>‘With so much death and suffering in care homes to date there is absolutely no room for complacency.’</p>
