<p>Confusion: Talking on Thursday's This Morning, the host, 39, asked whether she was going to have to choose between her mother Lynne, 71, or father Terry, pictured, on Christmas due to having a family of five </p>

<p>New rules: On Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'</p>

<p>'You can't have your parents over on Christmas Day but you can go on public transport? For the life of me, I can't make any sense of it.'</p>

<p>'I wish that we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives,' he said.</p>

<p>'I will be absolutely clear. This is not, these measures are not, another national lockdown. The whole point is to avoid a second national lockdown,' he added.</p>

<p>The new rules will be enforced in England and will apply to indoor and outdoor gatherings, including homes, parks, pubs and restaurants.    </p>

<p>It comes amid claims that Holly is reportedly preparing for a legal battle against her old talent agency in a disagreement over money.</p>

<p>The This Morning presenter is taking action against the YMU Group after they are said to be demanding a percentage of her future earnings, despite Holly forming her own agency Roxy. </p>

<p>The TV star is reported to be gearing up to take legal action and has a plethora of support from her showbiz friends, with a source telling The Sun: 'She won't be taken for a fool.'</p>

<p>The source told the publication: 'Holly is a strong, savvy, very successful woman working in a tough industry — she won’t be taken for a fool. </p>

<p>'It’s a real shame how things have turned out, as she was incredibly loyal to YMU for many years, but now they are demanding commission on future earnings. It is madness.' </p>

<p>Fines: Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200 (Holly's husband Dan pictured with their three children)</p>

<p>The insider went on to add that after setting up her 'all-female team' Roxy, Holly is all about 'empowerment' and will not 'roll over on the matter' should the dispute go down the legal route.</p>

<p>MailOnline have contacted a representative of Holly and YMU for comment.   </p>

<p>Last month it was reported that Holly had quit the showbiz agency that she shares with This Morning co-star Phillip Schofield. </p>

<p>The mum-of-three is said to have made plans to manage herself within an all-female team, after leaving the agency after 13 years.</p>

<p>The company YMU, who were previously known as James Grant, have a number of big name stars on the books including Ant and Dec, Graham Norton and Claudia Winkleman.</p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'Lockdown has given her time to reflect and think about her future. In many ways, it has become the perfect opportunity to start afresh and it was just time for a change.</p>

<p>'She is really excited about managing herself and having more say over decisions on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>'She has always had such incredible business sense and is proud to be a working mum and career woman.'</p>

<p>The insider went on to say that Holly's career decision was the 'logical next step' after she hoped to develop a 'better work-life balance.'</p>
