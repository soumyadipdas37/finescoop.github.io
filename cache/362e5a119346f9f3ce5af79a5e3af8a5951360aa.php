<p>Going solo: 5SOS drummer Ashton Irwin sent fans into a frenzy on Thursday when he announced his debut album will be released next month</p>

<p>Ashton said the lyrics on his upcoming album, Superbloom, were inspired by his childhood, depression, alcoholism and body dysmorphia.</p>

<p>'I had to reach a certain level of lyrical maturity in order to write about something I actually cared about,' he added.</p>

<p>'I think it's always important as an artist to have a mission statement, like, "Why do you make music? Why do you write the lyrics you write?"'</p>

<p>His first single, Skinny Skinny, tackles body image, which is something he 'never confronted in a creative form' before.</p>

<p>'I have been through stages in my life where I've been sickened by that state of mind,' he explained.</p>

<p>Ashton played Superbloom to his 5SOS bandmates, Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford and Calum Hood, a few hours after completing it.</p>

<p>Personal: 'I had to reach a certain level of lyrical maturity in order to write about something I actually cared about,' Ashton explained</p>

<p>'I wasn't scared because I'd told myself, "Trust yourself. You're proud of this record and you know these guys are your best mates and they will f**king get it,"' he said. </p>

<p>'It was awesome, I felt stoked to show them,' he added.</p>

<p>Ashton's debut album, Superbloom, will be released on October 23</p>
