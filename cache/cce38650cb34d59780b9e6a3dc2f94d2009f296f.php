<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's Hot or Not time again as Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai reveals what's been making him feel warm and what's been leaving him cold this week.   </p>

<p>Bryson DeChambeau</p>

<p>Not the easiest chap to warm to. For a catch-up on that, maybe search his name and ‘fire ants’ or ‘brand’. But popularity is trivial. He took a major risk with his career this year and the pay-off is that his bulking up project could change an entire sport, whether that is a good thing or not. The US Open won’t be his last major title.</p>

<p>Les Ferdinand</p>

<p>Not everyone will agree with his stance around footballers taking the knee, but once again he sounded like one of the smarter guys in the room. There is a value in gestures; there is a greater value in having the courage to call out a sport that tends to favour soundbites over action.</p>

<p>Tadej Pogacar</p>

<p>Aged 21, the Slovenian won the yellow, polka-dot and white jerseys at his first Tour de France. His time trial to snatch the yellow from Primoz Roglic on the penultimate day was extraordinary. But it was also a head-scratcher for many. And that’s because it’s cycling, where no great feat should pass without a quick history lesson.</p>

<p>Ronnie O’Sullivan</p>

<p>Comedy is in the timing etc. So how very amusing that Ronnie O’Sullivan’s first match since winning the worlds — where he ridiculed the young talent coming through — should end in defeat at the European Masters to Aaron Hill, an 18-year-old, ranked No 115.</p>

<p>Grant McCann</p>

<p>Hull’s manager was asked the other night why they turned down the offer of a virus test from West Ham.</p>

<p>‘We didn’t want to create anything,’ he said. True, Hull are highly unlikely to be alone in not wanting to ‘create’ a problem for themselves. And presumably football’s authorities can do more to take the decisions out of their hands. But deary me.</p>

<p>Patrick Siele</p>

<p>The number of Kenyan athletes serving doping bans now stands at 66. Siele was given a three-year suspension for evasion and the case centres on the rather fun detail that when testers turned up at the marathon runner’s base, he bolted and hurdled a fence to get away.</p>
