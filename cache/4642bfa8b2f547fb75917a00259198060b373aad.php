<p>It came as business leaders criticised the PM for imposing new restrictions on the economy as it begins to recover from the depths of the Covid crisis. </p>

<p>Mr Johnson said it was necessary to reintroduce working from home rules and a swathe of social measures in order to avoid a dramatic surge in deaths. </p>

<p>But the beleaguered premier faced fire from all sides as he U-turned on his push to reopen workplaces. </p>

<p>He also faced barbs for introducing other swingeing new measures including a 10pm pub curfew and £200 fines for mask rule-breakers in England. </p>

<p>The more domestically-focused FTSE 250 was also up this morning, climbing 0.86%. </p>

<p>Traders will be keenly analysing the effects of the new restrictions on economic activity, as well as data on new infections. </p>

<p>The FTSE 100 closed 25 points (0.43%) at 5,829 yesterday - a marked recovery from Monday's plunge which saw £51bn wiped off its value.  </p>
