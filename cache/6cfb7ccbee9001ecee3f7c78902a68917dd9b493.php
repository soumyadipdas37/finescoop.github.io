<p>The former grid girl recently announced her new reality TV show will air on ITVBe this autumn.</p>

<p>The eight-episode series will follow Olivia and the Blackburn Rovers footballer as they plan for their wedding and buy their first home in Cheshire.</p>

<p>The couple got engaged in Dubai in October last year following a four-year on/off romance.</p>

<p>Olivia previously had her own reality show with ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes called Crackin' On.</p>

<p>However, their relationship took a turn for the worse when Chris, 27, broke up with her on camera, telling her the relationship wasn't making him happy anymore.</p>

<p>He said to her at the time: 'I love you, I always will. You know that, nothing doubts that. You can't kid yourself.'</p>

<p>Olivia then reunited with Bradley, whom she was with before Love Island, while Chris found love with his now ex-girlfriend Jesy Nelson.</p>
