<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She's expecting her first child with her husband Laurens Van Leeuwen.</p>

<p>And on Saturday, Romee couldn't help but flash the proof with a playful Instagram post about her growing baby bump.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old Victoria's Secret Angel posted a set of two photos, one with her tummy covered by lingerie, and the other with it revealed. </p>

<p>Peekaboo! Romee Strijd, 25, showed off her growing baby bump in two playful photos posted to Instagram on Saturday in which she wore a pale pink lace chemise</p>

<p>Romee was posed seductively on a powder blue loveseat as she gazed into the camera.</p>

<p>She was dressed only in a pale pink lace chemise from Victoria's Secret that covered her tummy, and she wore her long blonde locks in waves cascading down her chest.</p>

<p>In the second photo, the model lifted up her top to cradle her baby bump.</p>

<p>'1 or 2?' she joked in the caption while adding a pink heart emoji with an arrow through it. </p>

<p>Bumping along! Late last month, Romee showed off her tummy in an Instagram video as she rubbed cream on herself to help with stretch marks</p>

<p>'I usually do it at night and I try to take the time to connect with the little one,' she explained.</p>

<p>'It's very important to take the time, and I love to see if she kicks or anything. It's just very important to connect with him or her,' she added.</p>

<p>Back in mid-June, Romee revealed that her baby was about the size of an avocado,  a standard comparison used around 16 weeks, so the catwalk star would now be a little over six months along. </p>

<p>Bared her belly: The Dutch model said she likes the time alone with her baby because she can feel her kick</p>

<p>Romee has been enjoying plenty of time at beaches in the Netherlands in recent weeks.</p>

<p>In August, she shared photos from a day out in the sun with her fellow Angel Taylor Hill and other friends.</p>

<p>Despite the ongoing pandemic, neither she nor anyone in the photos appeared to be wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>Unlike in many other nations, Dutch public health officials have resisted calls to mandate or even recommend non-medical mask use, aside from on public transit, where they're required. </p>

<p>Romee announced she was expecting her first child with her husband Laurens in May, and revealed they were expecting a baby girl in June.</p>

<p>Laurens stood at her side in an announcement video with a thick metal canister that spewed pink smoke</p>

<p>'We can’t wait to meet our little girl,' captioned the runway star, adding a heart emoji for good measure.</p>

<p>Romee and Laurens, whose father is a famous TV presenter in the Netherlands, eloped in October 2018 after dating since 2010.</p>

<p>'We can't wait': Romee announced her pregnancy in May and revealed she was expecting a girl in June</p>

<p>The model revealed in May that she was expecting her first child, following a year's long struggle with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) that kept her from having periods for years.  </p>

<p>Romee wrote that '2 years ago I got diagnosed with PCOS after not getting my period for 7 years. I was devastated because being a mom and starting a family with <?php echo e('@'); ?>laurensvleeuwen is my biggest dream..</p>

<p>'I was so scared that I would never be able to because I got told it was harder to get babies in a natural way.. I started to research PCOS and came to the conclusion that mine was not the typical pcos,' she added. </p>

<p>'Mine was because of my body being in fight or flight mode.. which means my body was under constant stress,' she continued. 'I never felt mentally super stressed so it was hard to understand this, but my life consisted of traveling all the time (no biorhythm), working out every day, eating super clean (restricting foods).'</p>

<p>Her solution was to give up the high-intensity training she had been doing and not to restrict her food choice, as well as being 'nice to myself' and taking breaks whenever she needs them.    </p>

<p>'WE'RE SOON A FAMILY OF THREE': The announcement came after the model revealed she had struggled with PCOS for years and had gone long stretches without periods</p>
