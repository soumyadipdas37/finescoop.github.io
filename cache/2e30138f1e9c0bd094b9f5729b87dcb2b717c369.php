<p>Wijnaldum has entered the final year of his contract at Liverpool with no current sign of an extension to remain at Anfield on the table.</p>

<p>The central midfielder has become a key part of the success at the Merseyside giants, missing just one game in their Premier League-winning season this year.</p>

<p>Koeman is looking to rebuild Barcelona after signing a two-year deal at the helm last month and Wijnaldum is a player he knows well from his two-year stint as Holland boss.</p>

<p>Wijnaldum has scored 19 goals in 186 appearances for Liverpool since joining the club from Newcastle in 2016.</p>
