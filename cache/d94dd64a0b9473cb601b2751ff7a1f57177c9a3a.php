<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wolves have secured the signing of highly-rated young defender Ki-Jana Hoever from Liverpool for £10million.</p>

<p>The Dutch centre-back made two appearances in the FA Cup for the Reds' first-team but never played in the Premier League, instead impressing for their under-23 side. </p>

<p>Hoever adds to a strong summer for Wolves, who have already broken their club record fee to capture Fabio Silva from Porto for £36m. The club have also signed Vitinha on-loan from the Portuguese club, Marcal and Matija Sarkic this summer.</p>

<p>Wolves have completed the signing of 18-year-old Liverpool defender Ki-Jana Hoever</p>

<p>The signing of Hoever will be followed by the exit of Wolves winger Diogo Jota, who has agreed to go the other way in a £41million move to Liverpool.  </p>

<p>Hoever may not have broken into Jurgen Klopp's first-team but the centre-back was along for the ride in a golden era at Anfield, witnessing their rapid rise to world champion status and earning multiple call-ups to match-day squads. </p>

<p>The 18-year-old was poached from Ajax's academy in the under-17 ranks, joining the Reds in August 2018, just in time for their magical two years featuring Champions League and Premier League glory. </p>

<p>Hoever managed to break into the Reds first-team four times, scoring against MK Dons </p>

<p>Hoever's four first-team matches included a 2-0 victory over MK Dons in the Carabao Cup, heading in from James Milner's cross for his only Reds goal and keeping a clean-sheet. </p>

<p>He also started as the Reds' youngest ever starting XI beat Shrewsbury 1-0 in the FA Cup fourth-round replay, while Klopp and his first-choice stars jetted to Qatar for their Club World Cup triumph.  </p>

<p>Wolves made a strong start to the season last weekend, beating Sheffield United 2-0 with a solid performance, led by front-man Raul Jimenez.  </p>
