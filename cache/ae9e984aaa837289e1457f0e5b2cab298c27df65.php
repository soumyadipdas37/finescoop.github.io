<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The weather may be more summery than usual but autumn is most definitely here.</p>

<p>And one of the best things about this season is the chance to really get cosy at home, creating a warm and welcoming space where it's a pleasure to be.</p>

<p>So as well as lighting the fire on cold nights and cooking up some comforting favourites in the kitchen, we've rounded up a few ideas for how to really embrace an autumnal aesthetic.</p>

<p>Check them out below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use lighting to cosy effect</li>
</ol>

<p>As the days get shorter and the nights get darker, it's the ideal time to use lighting to as a way to really build on that 'battening down the hatches' feel.</p>

<p>Personally we believe string fairy lights to be acceptable all year round, but now they really come into their own. Drape them on the fireplace and over doorways and the twinkling will be sure to get you in the mood for autumn.</p>

<p>With your more permanent lighting, use lower wattage bulbs that cast off a warm glow rather than a harsh white light. </p>

<p>L-R: Wilder Jute Vessel Table Lamp (£45) and Arty Ribbed Glass Table Lamp (£32) at Very</p>

<p>And why not upgrade your lighting while you're at it? We love this rustic (more to come later) jute table lamp, or for a more sleek look this ribbed glass lamp is lovely.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Embrace an autumnal colour palette</li>
</ol>

<p>Autumn really is a beautiful time of year.</p>

<p>Those canopies of leaves in gold, rust, red, orange and yellow really lift the soul and are great fun to jump in when they've fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>So bring some of that colour inside with accessories in similar shades. You don't need to redo your whole home's colour schemes, just add in touches of these warm seasonal hues instead.</p>

<p>A mustard cushion can be added to sofas, armchairs and beds, while this lovely checked throw can be layered over furnishings ready to be snuggled up in when the temperature drops.   </p>

<p>L-R: Genoa Cushion (£16.99) and Cascade Home Cheltenham Throw (£12.99) at Very</p>

<p>Small Cotton Rope Storage Basket (was £14, now £11) at Very</p>

<p>And this burnt orange rope basket is a stylish way to store toys, extra throws and magazines, so your house will be clutter-free while also autumn ready.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Add texture to furnishings</li>
</ol>

<p>Building on the inclusion of autumnal shades, this is also the time to add texture to your home.</p>

<p>By mixing fabrics and choosing those with a warm tactile quality you'll be upping the cosy factor by about 10. </p>

<p>So look for crochet, knits, faux fur, velvet and tassels and mix and match them throughout your space. </p>

<p>This fabulous fringed rug will look amazing on wooden floorboards or tiles and will help to keep the room toasty. </p>

<p>Calandre Fringed Rug (was from £59.99, now from £49.99) at Very</p>

<p>L-R: Catherine Lansfield Knitted Cushion (£14.99) and Catherine Lansfield Cuddly Throw (£27.99) at Very</p>

<p>This adorable knitted cushion covers off texture and colour in one go and who wouldn't want to be cosied up with this cuddly throw?</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Create an autumn-inspired display</li>
</ol>

<p>Pumpkins, cinnamon and autumn leaves make for a stunning display</p>

<p>This is a lovely way to welcome the new season.</p>

<p>Pick a spot in your home (or you may want to do it outside the front door) and pull together some autumnal items to create a gorgeous focal point.</p>

<p>Pumpkins and gourds of all sizes and colours are a must and why not add in stunning fall leaves, adding fragrance with cinnamon sticks tied up in a bundle. </p>

<p>Tonal flowers, pumpkins and candles help to nail that autumn look</p>

<p>Or mix your pumpkins with some flowers in burnt orange and rich-hued berries, lighting a candle to watch as the flickering light creates atmosphere and warmth.</p>

<p>The pumpkins can then also be used for cooking or for Halloween so nothing will go to waste. </p>

<p>Set Of 3 Smoked Grey Glass Led Pillar Candles (£50) at Very</p>

<p>This set of smoked grey glass LED candles is a safe and stylish way to get the effect.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Go rustic </li>
</ol>

<p>Back to the rustic vibe we mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>This is all about nature and having a feeling that as the natural world changes outside, so our homes do on the inside.</p>

<p>Just small touches around the house will make all the difference. Add in pieces which look handcrafted (even if they weren't) and which can be used alongside the things you already own.</p>

<p>This carved wooden trinket tray is perfect and we love this set of wooden bowls. USe them to hold fruit and serve seasonal salads or make them part of your autumnal display, filling them with pine cones and pumpkins.</p>

<p>L-R: Treat Republic Rustic Carved Wooden Heart Dish (£24.99) and Creative Tops Naturals Set of 3 Wooden Bowls (was £13, now £10) at Very</p>

<p>Nile Rattan-Style Baskets - Set of 2 (was £30, now £22) at Very</p>

<p>And use these rattan baskets to store wood for the fire, loo rolls or anything else that could do with a new tidy spot!</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Play with woodland motifs</li>
</ol>

<p>In a similar way to going down the natural materials route, adding in motifs that speak to the changing seasons and the outside world is a sweet and rather whimsical way to update your home. </p>

<p>And embroidered stag cushion is ideal and we love that tartan background. Very Monarch of the Glen! </p>

<p>Premier Housewares Heritage Stag Cushion (£22.99) at Very</p>

<p>L-R: Graham &amp; Brown Hare Print On Wood (£32) and KitchenCraft Into the Wild Stag Large Tray (was £8, now £6) at Very</p>

<p>And take the theme further with this hare print on wood which will look great on a hall or kitchen wall.</p>

<p>And we're obsessed with this sweet stag print tray by KitchenCraft. In fact, we'll be using it as a decorative accessory in our kitchen as well as a practical piece of kit! </p>

<p>So there you have it. Getting your home cosy and snug for autumn is easy and affordable. </p>
