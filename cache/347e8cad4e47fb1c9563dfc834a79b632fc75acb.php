<p>'I've never moved to LA, I've never wanted or tried to be an actress in Australia, never wanted or tried to get work as an actress in LA and certainly am not acting on the Bachelor,' Bella wrote on Instagram. </p>

<p>Without naming names, she went on to claim that people had tried to 'fabricate' stories about her in order to feel 'relevant' and 'important'.</p>
