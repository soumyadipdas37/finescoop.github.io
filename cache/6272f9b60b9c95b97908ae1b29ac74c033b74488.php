<p>Classic lyrics: Taylor Swift fans flooded his Instagram comments Monday with lyrics from her song All Too Well, which appeared on her fourth studio album Red in 2012, allegedly inspired by their brief romance (pictured in February, 2020)</p>

<p>The 39-year-old posted a black-and-white childhood photo, which appeared to be a yearbook scan of little Jake in big round glasses.</p>

<p>Several followers commented some version of the lyric: 'I heard you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed.'    </p>

<p>Jake and Taylor, 30, briefly dated for three months back in 2010, when he was 29 and she was 21, following her split from John Mayer, 42.</p>

<p>It was widely presumed when All Too Well dropped, that the critically-acclaimed song was about their relationship.</p>

<p>Swift told Good Morning America at the time: 'All Too Well [was difficult to write emotionally] because it took me a really long time to filter through everything I wanted to put in the song without it being a 10 minute song, which you can’t put on an album. </p>

<p>'I wanted a story that could work in the form of a song and I called my co-writer Liz Rose and said, "Come over, we’ve gotta filter this down,’ and it took me a really long time to get it."'</p>

<p>The track also supposedly references Jake's equally famous sister Maggie Gyllenhaal, 42, in the lyric: 'And I left my scarf there at your sister's house / And you've still got it in your drawer even now.'</p>

<p>The Deuce star hilariously addressed the lyric back in 2017, when she appeared on Watch What Happens Live.</p>

<p>'You know, I never understood everybody asked me about this scarf. What is this?' she asked Andy Cohen, who explained the popular theory about the song.</p>

<p>Maggie responded: 'I am in the dark about the scarf. It’s totally possible. I don't know. But... I have been asked this before! And I've been like, "What are you talking about?"'</p>
