<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Her acerbic pen and astonishingly indiscreet memoirs have caused outrage among the political establishment.</p>

<p>But former minister's wife Sasha Swire has admitted she was naive and insists she was surprised by the furore her book has caused, especially her claims about David Cameron.</p>

<p>'Maybe I was naive,' she said in an interview to promote Diary of an MP's Wife: Inside and Outside Power. 'But I'm terrified of causing trouble. People are going to make this all about David; they won't see the integrity of the diary as a whole.'</p>

<p>The controversial book, packed with personal anecdotes and private conversations often involving sexual or lewd behaviour, has upset past and present senior Tory politicians – and led to suggestions that she is doomed to 'social Siberia'.</p>

<p>Sasha Swire, 57, insists she was surprised by the furore her book, Diary of an MP's Wife: Inside and Outside Power, has caused - especially her claims about David Cameron</p>

<p>However, Lady Swire, 57, has no intention of holding back and could not stop herself taking aim at 'amateur' politicians.</p>

<p>In the interview with The Observer, she said: 'Outsiders think politics should be very professional. It's not. It's totally amateur.</p>

<p>'That's why it's so sexy and so toxic, and I'm so happy I'm not in it anymore.'</p>

<p>Her husband Hugo Swire, MP for East Devon until last year, is a former Foreign Office minister.</p>

<p>Among the embarrassing memoir claims are how Mr Cameron thought it was 'hilarious' to joke with Mr Swire about the size of Michael Gove's manhood.</p>

<p>There was also the time on a country walk when Mr Cameron allegedly told Lady Swire her scent made him want 'to grab you and push you into the bushes and give you one!'</p>

<p>Despite the lurid headlines about the book, Lady Swire revealed in the interview how she and her husband stayed at David and Samantha Cameron's house in Cornwall last weekend. </p>

<p>Despite the embarrassing memoir claims, Lady Swire has revealed how she and her husband Hugo stayed with David and Samantha Cameron (above) in Cornwall last weekend</p>

<p>Lady Swire said she joked then about the book with Mrs Cameron, who she regards as a 'Lefty'. </p>

<p>She added: 'Sam said to me: "I suppose you're going to call me a communist [in your book]", and I said "yeah", and she laughed.'</p>

<p>The ex-prime minister is content with his new life in the shadows, added Lady Swire, saying: 'He's close to Samantha. He's devoted to his children.'</p>

<p>She also commented on Sir Hugo's career, saying: 'When your husband becomes a minister, everyone thinks it's glamorous. At the Foreign Office, he was away all the time, flying to Rio for a one-hour meeting.</p>

<p>'You arrive, and there are some sirens going: that's the glamorous thing. But then you come back, and your wife asks why you're never at home. It's exhausting.</p>

<p>'You're not in the job because you're the best at it. There are all these other things in play.'</p>

<p>In the book, Dominic Cummings is labelled 'stark raving mad' – and Lady Swire clearly has not changed her opinion of Boris Johnson's chief adviser.</p>

<p>'It will all go tits up with him, it always does. He'll explode,' she claimed in the interview.</p>

<p>Her opinion of Theresa May is equally unflattering: 'She didn't have an original idea in her head. And no friends either.'</p>

<p>Mr Cameron also advised the Swires on how to convert a barn at their home in Devon but was ignored. He suggested simply putting a pool table inside but the couple turned it into a fully functional Victorian-style pub.</p>

<p>They also have a disco room complete with lights which Lady Swire called 'rather good exercise' when they are on.</p>

<p>She even has a dedicated writing room to pen her diaries while her home's bathrooms are described as 'luxuriantly boho'.</p>

<p>Her book is out on Thursday.</p>
