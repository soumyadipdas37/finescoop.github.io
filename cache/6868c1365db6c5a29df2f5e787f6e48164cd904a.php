<p>The weekend of their special day came just before the explosive Finding Freedom biography, which delved into Harry and Meghan's rift with the Royal Family, was also released and Cressida wanted to avoid being in the spotlight.</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Cressida split in 2014, reportedly because Cressida was tired of the scrutiny that came with dating a member of the royal family. </p>

<p>A family member told MailOnline that just 30 of Cressida and Harry's closest family and friends attended the ceremony in July, in keeping with the government's Covid-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>'It was a beautiful ceremony and they are just so happy,' the source said. 'It was a very private and intimate ceremony and that is what they wanted.</p>

<p>'Cressida looked stunning and was radiant. We are just all so happy for them and it was a great day but they did request that no one talks about it.'</p>

<p>A friend added: 'Cressida did not want a big fuss,and did not want others to talk about it. You most certainly will not be seeing her wedding in Hello magazine. </p>

<p>'She is also was aware that [Prince] Harry is in the headlines and knew the attention her wedding would attract if it leaked out.'</p>

<p>In May Cressida hinted that their original wedding had to be postponed due to the current crisis, posting a snap as she and Harry posed in front of an 'Auto-wed' machine in fancy dress </p>

<p>While they have both moved on and married other people, Harry and Cressida remained on good terms and socialise in similar circles, with Princess Eugenie, who introduced the couple, among Cressida's closest friends</p>

<p>Only 30 people are said to have attended the newlyweds private countryside wedding, due to lockdown restrictions limiting the number of guests allowed to attend</p>

<p>On the day of their wedding, Cressida had her blonde hair pulled back into a casual updo and wore a simple white dress which fell above her knees</p>

<p>The bride's brother, Jacobi Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, shared an Instagram photo of the happy couple 'riding off into their beautiful future' on horseback. </p>

<p>Cressida is the only child of 1960s 'It' Girl Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon and her third husband, Old Harrovian entrepreneur Jeffrey Bonas</p>

<p>The actress, who appeared in ITV drama White House Farm, has three half-brothers from her father Jeffrey Bonas' first marriage, George, Charles and Henry Bonas.</p>

<p>The actress, who appeared in ITV drama White House Farm, has three half-brothers from her father Jeffrey Bonas' first marriage, George, Charles and Henry Bonas.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her mother has four children to her first two husbands: Pandora Cooper-Key, daughter of Esmond Cooper-Key, and sculptor Georgiana Anstruther, Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, and Jacobi Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, the children of property developer John Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe. Isabella is married to Sir Richard Branson's son Sam.</p>

<p>Harry Wentworth-Stanley, an associate director at estate agents Savills, is the son of Nick Wentworth-Stanley, a debonair Old Etonian, and Clare, now the Marchioness of Milford Haven, who acquired the title upon her second marriage to Harry’s stepfather, the Marquess of Milford Haven.  </p>

<p>Before his relationship with his now wife became official, Harry, who is dashingly handsome and 6ft 4in tall, was regarded as one of London's most eligible bachelors.   </p>

<p>He inherited his looks from his mother, Clare, a beauty who remains stunning. There was a brother, James, four years his senior, and younger sister Louisa. When Harry was a child, his mother and father divorced. In 1997, Clare married George, Marquess of Milford Haven, a cousin of the Queen, himself divorced with two children.</p>

<p>The family settled at Great Trippetts, an estate set in 1,000 acres in the Sussex Downs. For a time, life was perfect. Clare stayed on good terms with her former husband, Nick Wentworth-Stanley, who went on to marry Dutch beauty Millie Brenninkmeyer, with whom he had three more children. </p>

<p>Shortly before Christmas 2006, the Marquess and Marchioness and their children went to stay with Nick and his wife in Worcestershire. James, Harry’s elder brother, was recovering from a relatively minor procedure. The operation was a success, but James had become very anxious in the days that followed.</p>

<p>Harry Wentworth-Stanley, an associate director at estate agents Savills, is the son of Nick Wentworth-Stanley, a debonair Old Etonian, and Clare, now the Marchioness of Milford Haven, who acquired the title upon her second marriage to Harry’s stepfather, the Marquess of Milford Haven. Pictured, the Marquess and Marchioness in 2017</p>

<p>One evening, the family were gathered in the house when they heard a shot fired. They rushed outside to find James lying dead.</p>

<p>The family was shattered by the tragedy.</p>

<p>Clare was floored by her son’s suicide. Touchingly, it was Harry, then 17, who helped her through it. She said in an interview 18 months after James’ death: ‘For the sake of the other children, you have to set an example. If you are strong, it gives them permission to be strong. If you fall to bits, they will.</p>

<p>‘The day after James died, his brother Harry said his biggest fear was that it would destroy me, and that would destroy everything else. It suddenly made me feel how important I was.’</p>

<p>The couple had a serious relationship when they were both students at Leeds University. The couple were known to their crowd — for reasons that aren’t entirely clear — as ‘Water-Cress’. The romance petered out when he took off for a gap year to Argentina in 2011 after graduating.</p>

<p>Friends have previously said Cressida wasn’t quite over Harry when another Harry — Prince Harry himself — began pursuing her in the summer of 2012 and a romance began. There were concerts, rugby matches, skiing trips and cosy nights in at Kensington Palace.  </p>

<p>However the couple split in 2014 after three years together. </p>

<p>The following year Harry Wentworth-Stanley and Cressida were photographed on a Valentine's Day date, although their relationship became public and official in 2017. </p>

<p>In August last year Harry proposed while on a trip to the US and the couple's smiles in the Instagram announcement told followers all they needed to know about their love for each other.  </p>

<p>His older brother James Wentworth-Stanley, took his own life in 2006 at the age of 21, and he has a younger sister, Louisa, born in 1993.</p>

<p>His father went onto have three more children with his second wife, Mille Brenninkmeyer, while his mother, now Marchioness of Milford Haven, inherited two stepchildren on her marriage to the Queen's cousin, George Mountbatten.</p>

<p>Cressida, who appeared in this year's ITV drama White House Farm, announced her engagement to estate agent Harry in August 2019. The couple first dated while studying at university before rekindling their romance in 2017.</p>

<p>In May she hinted that their original wedding had to be postponed due to the current crisis, posting a snap as she and Harry posed in front of an 'Auto-wed' machine in fancy dress outfits.</p>

<p>Sharing the photo on Instagram, Cressida wished her beau a happy birthday before commenting: 'Well, if all else fails there’s always Auto Wed...! Happy birthday my heart. #OneDay.'</p>
