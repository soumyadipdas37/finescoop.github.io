<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Experts have verified a 29-year-old weather reading from Greenland which sets a new record for the coldest temperature ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere. </p>

<p>An automated weather station positioned more than 10,000 ft above sea level and atop the Greenland ice sheet took the measurement on 22 December 1991. </p>

<p>The temperature sunk as low as -69.6°C (-93.3°F) at the site, located in a frigid place called Klinck, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.  </p>

<p>The temperature tally surpasses the previous record of -67.8°C (-90°F), detected twice before at the Siberian sites of Oimekon in 1933 and Verkhoyanksk in 1892. </p>

<p>The latter Russian site made headlines in recent months for recording a new record-high temperature north of the Arctic Circle during a heatwave in the region.</p>

<p>On June 19 2020 it is believed to have reached 100.4F (38C) in Siberia, an astonishing 32F (18C) above the normal level for this time of year.</p>

<p>The coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth was -89.2°C (-128.6°F) recorded in 1983 at the high-altitude Vostok weather station in Antarctica. </p>

<p>'In the era of climate change, much attention focuses on new heat records,' said WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas in a statement. </p>

<p>'This newly recognised cold record is an important reminder about the stark contrasts that exist on this planet.'</p>

<p>The automated weather site at Klinck was set up in the early 90s and operated for two years. </p>

<p>It was designed to form part of a network to record the meteorological conditions around the Greenland Crest during the Greenland Ice Sheet Project. </p>

<p>As a result, it was deliberately installed as close to the summit of the desolate ice sheet as possible.  </p>

<p>In 1994 it was returned to the laboratory for testing and then sent for use in the Antarctic. </p>

<p>WMO has recognized a new Northern Hemisphere low temperature record of -69.6°C in Greenland. It eclipses the -67.8°C recorded in 1892 in Russia's #Verkhoyanksk, which this year reported a temperature of +38°C on 20 June during Siberia's heatwave.❄️ 🌡️https://t.co/qX05pdhjgC pic.twitter.com/vEjoqx2g3R</p>

<p>The new temperature record surpasses the -67.8°C recorded twice at Siberian sites of Oimekon in 1933 and Verkhoyanksk in 1892. The latter Russian site recorded a new record-high temperature north of the Arctic Circle in June (pictured)</p>

<p>June, July and August of 2020 created the hottest summer ever recorded in the Northern hemisphere, according to official data. </p>

<p>When accounting for the Southern hemisphere as well, 2020 ranks as the world's third-warmest summer since records began in 1880.</p>

<p>From the start of June to the end of August, the average temperature north of the equator was 2.11°F (1.17°C) above the pre-industrial average. </p>

<p>This tops the previous hottest summers of 2016 and 2019, which were tied in top spot. </p>

<p>The figures come on the back of the second-hottest August on record for the top half of the globe. </p>

<p>Last month, the temperature was, on average, 2.14°F (1.19° C) higher than the average August temperature of the 20th century, before the Industrial Revolution.  </p>

<p>However, some regions suffered more than others in the August heat.</p>

<p>North America endured its hottest August on record, driving record-breaking wildfires, while Europe sweltered through its third-hottest recorded summer. </p>

<p>South America and Oceania experienced their fourth-hottest August on record, according to NOAA data.  </p>

<p>August 2020 also marks the 44th consecutive August where temperatures have been above the 20th-century average.</p>

<p>All components of the Automatic Weather Station were chosen because they are able to function in extremely cold conditions, according to George Weidner, who helped design the station. </p>

<p>'On Greenland, all of the sites were installed by snowmobile. So the Automatic Weather Station had to be packed to survive a traverse over very rough snow surfaces,' he said.</p>

<p>'Years of packing experience in Antarctica helped us keep our Automatic Weather Station safe and snug on the sleds being pulled by the snowmobiles,' he said. </p>

<p>But the readings from the station went under the radar, as the body which tracks heat records, the WMO Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes, only formed in 2007.   </p>

<p>The new low was discovered by so-called 'climate detectives' working with the WMO's Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes in Geneva.</p>

<p>They pored over reams of historic data in search of records like high and low temperatures, greatest rainfall, and even 'heaviest hailstone' and 'longest lightning flash.'</p>

<p>After spotting the extremely cold temperature, the team tracked down the scientists who initially installed and operated the station, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>

<p>Independent experts assessed the data, which was said to have been immaculately recorded and kept, the weather of 1991 and the panel unanimously recommended acceptance of the observation as valid.</p>

<p>'This investigation highlights the ability of today’s climate scientists to not only identify modern climate records but to play 'climate detective' and uncover important past climate records—thereby creating a high-quality long-term record of climate for climate-sensitive regions of the world,' said Professor Randall Cerveny, Rapporteur of Climate and Weather Extremes for WMO. </p>

<p>The full findings are published in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society.</p>

<p>Melting from Greenland's ice sheet broke records last year — losing a total of 532 gigatonnes of mass overall, analysis of satellite data has revealed.</p>

<p>Experts led from Germany found that the ice loss in 2019 was 15 per cent higher than the previous worst year on record — which was 2012.</p>

<p>However, they also noted that favourable conditions in 2017–2018 meant that melting was lower than in any other two-year period between 2003–2019. </p>

<p>Researchers can assess how fast ice mass is lost by tracking changes in gravity as recorded by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) missions. </p>

<p>Melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet is one of the largest contributors to sea level rise and presently contributes an increase of around 0.03 inches (0.76 mm) annually.</p>

<p>In total, sea levels rose by around 0.14 inches (3.5 mm) each year from 2005 to 2017, researchers have calculated.</p>

<p>The findings come a week after a study revealed that Greenland's glaciers have already passed what researchers have called the 'point of no return'.</p>

<p>This, experts warned, means that the ice would now continue to melt away even if global warming could be completely stopped.</p>
