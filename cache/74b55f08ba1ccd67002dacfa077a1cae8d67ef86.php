<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United have had a loan enquiry rejected for Italian winger Federico Chiesa, after the Red Devils failed to make any progress in landing Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho, according to The Telegraph.</p>

<p>The Old Trafford club still harbour hopes of finalising a deal for Sancho before the transfer window slams shut, however Dortmund have remained steadfast in their valuation of £108million for the England star. </p>

<p>With just five days of the transfer window remaining, United are looking at alternative options on loan. </p>

<p>Manchester United are reportedly interested in Italian international winger Federico Chiesa</p>

<p>Red Devils are also interested in Ousmane Dembele as another alternative to Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>Serie A side Fiorentina are not interested in loaning out Chiesa - the 22-year-old is wanted by Juventus who are willing to pay around £45m to secure his services permanently.</p>

<p>Watford's Senegalese winger Ismaila Sarr is also only available for a permanent deal with the Hornets having no interest in loaning him out. </p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer's side retain an interest in taking Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele on a season's loan, however manager Ronald Koeman wants the Frenchman to remain at the Nou Camp.  </p>

<p>Manchester United cruised into the Carabao Cup quarter finals with a comfortable 3-0 win at Brighton on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Manchester United ran out comfortable 3-0 winners at the Amex in Carabao Cup fourth round</p>

<p>The draw for the next round will take place on October 1, following the conclusion of Liverpool's game against Arsenal. </p>

<p>Goals from Scott McTominay, Juan Mata and Paul Pogba ensured the encounter was far more comfortable than the Premier League game between the two sides on Saturday.</p>

<p>Brighton hit the woodwork a record five times and United had to rely on a last-gasp penalty from Bruno Fernandes to claim the points at the Amex.  </p>
