<p>Millionaire property developer Peter Morgan, 58, strangled his lover Georgina Symonds, 25, at the sprawling castle in 2016.</p>

<p>But a mystery buyer splashed out £1.1million at auction for the property despite its chilling past.</p>

<p>A sprawling castle estate (pictured) near Newport, Gwent, where a jealous millionaire tycoon strangled his 25-year-old escort girlfriend, has been sold at an auction for £1.1million</p>

<p>Married Morgan - who paid £1.7million for Pencoed Castle - was jailed for a minimum of 25 years for strangling Georgina to death in the castle grounds.</p>

<p>He launched the horrific attack after finding out escort Georgina was planning to get her hands on his £20million fortune.</p>

<p>Georgina had been living at a bungalow in the grounds of her 'sugar daddy's' 16th century castle - which went under the hammer with Morgan behind bars.</p>

<p>The sprawling Pencoed Castle in Llanmartin, near Newport, Gwent, was bought by Morgan for £1.7million after it was put up for sale for £2.5million in 2001.</p>

<p>He dreamed of convert it into a luxury holiday home mixed with business units on the historic site.</p>

<p>He previously said: 'There is no way we would consider splitting the castle into apartments it needs to be left as one.'</p>

<p>Morgan was filmed by a police 'bodycam' telling officers he had no idea where Georgina Symonds was on the day he had murdered her. He was jailed for life for her murder</p>

<p>Peter Morgan wrote a chilling shopping list of items he needed to carefully dispose of his escort lover's body, his murder trial heard.</p>

<p>The millionaire businessman typed the list into his iPhone at 3.20am – five hours after he tapped Georgina Symonds's phone and learned of her plot to fleece him.</p>

<p>Written in the early hours after he became 'enraged' by her plans, the macabre list, entitled 'String', read: 'O2, poly, glove, snip, handle, tape, Special K, starter, rag, adapter.' </p>

<p>Hours earlier Morgan had overheard Miss Symonds tell her new love interest Thomas Ballinger that she intended to leave the millionaire and go back to escorting in London, where she would continue to 'fleece' him.</p>

<p> Prosecutors said that on January 12 2016 – a day after he wrote the list – Morgan took tape, twine, a metal pole and plastic sheeting to Miss Symonds's rural bungalow in Llanmartin, near Newport.</p>

<p>He had also bought a mobile phone SIM card a day earlier, the jury heard, and told police officers that it was to call a taxi after dumping Miss Symonds's body. After strangling the mother of one with the twine, Morgan wrapped her body in sheeting and bound it with rope and tape.</p>

<p>He had meticulously positioned her body so it would neatly fit inside the boot of his £52,000 Porsche Cayenne, the court heard.</p>

<p>CCTV footage taken two hours later showed Morgan driving to an outbuilding at the farmhouse he had previously shared with his wife, before taking Miss Symonds's body – wrapped in sheeting and attached to a bar – out of the car.</p>

<p>But his plans crumbled after he started his affair with Ms Symonds - and it ended in tragedy.</p>

<p>His company put the property up for sale for a reduced price while serving out his sentence - with a guide price of £950,000.</p>

<p>But it was sold by auctioneers Alsopp for £1,110,000 after a flurry of late bids.</p>

<p>The auctioneers said they could not reveal the buyer.</p>

<p>Morgan was jailed at Newport Crown Court for the 2016 murder after he secretly bugged the castle bungalow to spy on Ms Symonds.</p>

<p>He overheard how she planned to 'do him over' with a series of sex pictures at his home.</p>

<p>The court heard Morgan was worth at least £20million and was 'obsessed' with Ms Symonds - calling himself her 'sugar daddy.'</p>

<p>Two days after hearing her plot he confronted her and wrapped bailing twine around her neck to strangle her.</p>

<p>He then took Ms Symonds in the boot of his £52,000 Porsche Cayenne to an outhouse at his Beech Hill Farm in Usk.</p>

<p>When Georgina failed to pick her five-year-old daughter from school, her worried family and friends alerted police, who tracked her smartphone to Morgan's farm.</p>

<p>He admitted killing her and told officers: 'I can't take it. I need to tell you I strangled her this morning. </p>

<p>'You'll need these keys - she's locked in the outhouse.'</p>

<p>Morgan is listed at Companies House as owning more than 75 per cent of the company owning the castle.</p>

<p>There is planning permission in place to restore the castle, convert the outbuildings to offices and develop 12 new dwellings.</p>

<p>The auctioneers said the total area of the site is 64.8 acres.</p>

<p>A spokesman said: 'Extensive Shops, Bars and Restaurants are located nearby in Newport and Newport Rail Station is situated eight miles to the west.</p>

<p>'The property has easy Access onto the M4 Motorway.'</p>
