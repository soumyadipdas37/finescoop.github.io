<p>Alvaro Morata has returned to Juventus after playing for the Italian club from 2014 to 2016</p>

<p>Morata spent two years at the Turin club from 2014 to 2016 before joining Chelsea for a then club record €60m.</p>

<p>At his official unveiling on Friday, he told football-italia.net: 'Being back here is great. I'm now a more experienced person and player. </p>

<p>'This is the chance of a lifetime.</p>

<p>'Seeing Pirlo as a coach has been great. I saw it coming because he was made to be one. Juve need him and I'm happy to be here with him.</p>

<p>The striker has joined on a one-season loan from Atletico Madrid with an option to buy</p>

<p>'After the first two training sessions, I was already impressed with how he managed the group. He knows how to get us to play well with the ball.</p>

<p>'I'm sure we'll do well. I'm ready to play and do whatever the coach asks of me. I want to win and I'd like to score 35 goals.</p>

<p>'I've always said that my dream was to play for Atletico Madrid, but they were banking on me here when I was a still a young lad, so I'm very grateful.</p>

<p>'I'm at the right place at the right time. The best memory of when I was here is my wife, in addition to the trophies I won, which are unforgettable.'</p>

<p>The 27-year-old striker has backed Andrea Pirlo's side to win Champions League</p>

<p>Morata reunites with Cristiano Ronaldo, his strike partner at Real Madrid.</p>

<p>'I know Cristiano well, both as a player and as a person. I always had a good relationship with him. He told me that he was happy I came here.</p>

<p>'It wasn't my decision to leave the first time. A contract must be respected. Before returning, I talked to everyone and saw that there was this possibility.</p>

<p>'I was happy at Atletico, I won't forget what I did for them, but now I'm here and that's the most important thing.</p>

<p>'I've always felt the faith of his club, even when I wasn't here.'</p>
