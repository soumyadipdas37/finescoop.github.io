<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Opera singer Placido Domingo has said the only thing he has done wrong in his career has been to stay silent over sexual harassment allegations made against him.</p>

<p>The 79-year-old Spanish star, who has recovered after being hospitalised with coronavirus, had appeared to accept his guilt in February.</p>

<p>He apologised for ‘the hurt’ caused to his accusers and said he accepted ‘full responsibility’ for his actions.</p>

<p>But shortly afterwards he issued a second statement saying his first one had given the wrong impression.</p>

<p>Spanish opera singer Placido Domingo, 79, has said the only thing he has done wrong in his career has been to stay silent over sexual harassment allegations made against him</p>

<p>In it, he insisted: ‘I have never behaved aggressively towards anyone and I have never done anything to obstruct or hurt anyone’s career in any way.’ The tenor was alleged to have forcibly kissed, grabbed and fondled women over a period of more than 30 years.</p>

<p>The claims led to him being blacklisted by several prestigious opera houses, particularly in the US.</p>

<p>Now, he has broken a year-long TV silence, telling Spanish broadcaster TVE on Saturday night: ‘I have changed. Confinement and having suffered Covid has made me recapacitate. The time I spent in isolation, the fragility and solitude, made me see I had to clarify things.</p>

<p>‘I discovered a renewed strength, a will to live, and to carry on. I thank God I am alive and I have been able to sing again, which is everything for me.’</p>

<p>He insisted his initial statement in February was ‘taken out of context’.</p>

<p>When asked if he had thought he had done anything wrong during his career, he said: ‘I think I made a mistake when I stayed silent. That silence has harmed me a lot, not only in my life and my career.’</p>

<p>He apologised for ‘the hurt’ caused to his accusers and said he accepted ‘full responsibility’ for his actions</p>

<p>Quizzed on what he would say to the women who have made allegations against him, he said: ‘If I had realised I had made them uncomfortable in any way I would have said sorry immediately.’</p>

<p>He added: ‘To those who have stopped believing in me, I’d like nothing better than to make them change their opinion if they have felt disappointed by what they’ve read in the press.</p>

<p>‘I’m convinced many people have judged me without knowing me. Those who know me know what I’m like.’</p>

<p>Two investigations were launched after the allegations, one by Los Angeles Opera, a company that Domingo helped found, and another by the American Guild of Musical Artists union. The AGMA probe found the Spanish tenor had ‘engaged in ​inappropriate activity, ranging from flirtation to sexual advances, in and outside of the workplace’.</p>
