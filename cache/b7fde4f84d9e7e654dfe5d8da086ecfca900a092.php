<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A union boss who slated 'out of touch' university vice-Chancellors' salaries has been accused of hypocrisy after it emerged she was paid over £500,000 herself.</p>

<p>Sally Hunt, 56, was named today as the highest paid public sector trade union leader in 2019 for the £534,805 total remuneration she is said to have received.</p>

<p>The numbers were revealed by the Taxpayers' Alliance's Trade Union Rich List over her former role as the general secretary of the University and College Union.</p>

<p>Ms Hunt stepped down from her role in 2019 on health grounds but during her time in charge led a number of strikes at universities and criticised vice-Chancellors' salaries.</p>

<p>Former University and College Union general secretary Sally Hunt earned over £500,000</p>

<p>Bolton University and Bath Spa University came under fire from the union boss in recent years.</p>

<p>In 2018 she slammed Bolton head George Holmes' £55,000 pay rise and in 2017 slated Bath's vice chancellor Christina Slade's £429,000 'golden goodbye'.</p>

<p>Research director of the TaxPayers' Alliance Duncan Simpson said trade union leaders being paid massive amounts were 'hypocritical'.</p>

<p>He added: 'Taxpayers have had enough lectures from loaded union leaders, claiming to represent the workers earning a fraction of their bumper pay packets.</p>

<p>'Hypocritical union heads should be making the same sacrifices as everyone else, cutting back these whacking great wages and contributing to the national effort against covid-19.'</p>

<p>It said in 2019, the public sector trade unions with the most senior staff on total remuneration more than £100,000 were the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and the POA, with two each.</p>

<p>The report continued: 'Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair and general secretary of the British Medical Association, received £193,414 in total remuneration.</p>

<p>Ms Hunt lives in a Brighton house worth £640,000 and is a keen Arsenal FC supporter</p>

<p>'His salary alone (£171,000) was over 6 times what a foundation (FY1) doctor working in the NHS receives in 2020 (£28,243).'</p>

<p>Ms Hunt lives in a £640,000 house in Brighton, East Sussex, and has a daughter.</p>

<p>She is currently working with an organisation providing food to those who need it with and has previously been involved with migrant charity Care4Calais.</p>

<p>The former union boss has been off social media since she stepped down last year, but often tweeted her views.</p>

<p>One in 2017 complained of a noisy eater: 'Ucu NEC today. Thanks all. Lots done.</p>

<p>'Now on a train next to man eating wine gums, mouth open, headphones on. I confess to violent thoughts.'</p>

<p>She appeared to have been a Jeremy Corbyn supporter as well as Arsenal fan and once claimed the 'left' had the best music.</p>
