<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prince Harry is 'happier than ever' on his 36th birthday and 'doesn't miss his old life at all', royal experts have claimed.</p>

<p>The Duke of Sussex, who today turns the same age his mother Princess Diana was when she died, is 'very content' with his marriage and family and 'thriving' in his professional life, according to Omid Scobie.</p>

<p>Scobie, who co-authored the controversial royal biography Finding Freedom which raised eyebrows for its gushing praise and intimate knowledge of Harry and Meghan Markle, 39, told Vanity Fair: 'This is the moment [Harry] can sit back and think, "I made it".'</p>

<p>Meanwhile royal commentator Ingrid Seward told the publication that the Duke of Sussex can celebrate his birthday 'on a high', adding: 'He's embracing his new life and everything is an adventure right now. He has moved on very quickly, and I don't think he misses his old life at all.'</p>

<p>Prince Harry, pictured in Amsterdam in September 2019, is 'happier than ever' on his 36th birthday and 'doesn't miss his old life at all', royal experts have claimed</p>

<p>Writing in Vanity Fair, royal expert Katie Nicholl said it's likely that the prince is reflecting on his mother's life and legacy even more than usual on this milestone day.</p>

<p>Harry was just 12 years old when Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997, aged 36, and on his 18th birthday he vowed to 'to carry on the things that she didn’t quite finish' with regard to her charity work.</p>

<p>Having quit as a senior member of the Royal Family in March, he, wife Meghan and son Archie, one, have relocated to California, where they live in a sprawling $14million mansion in Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the couple signed a mega production deal with Netflix believed to be worth around $150million, announcing their intention to provide 'hope and inspiration' with their upcoming documentaries, feature films and children's programming.</p>

<p>'Harry's royal life is very different, but that pledge remains as important to him now as it was 18 years ago,' writes Nicholl.</p>

<p>Scobie branded it 'destiny', adding: 'We've long mourned Diana's place on the humanitarian landscape, and here we have Harry, who embodies her values and is willing to dedicate his life to them. </p>

<p>'He's at an age now where he’s taken that baton and is able to run with it in a way that he would never have been able to do within the House of Windsor. That's very powerful and exciting.'</p>

<p>This morning Prince William and Kate Middleton led tributes to Harry on his birthday - a month after fresh claims of the brothers' strained relationship were published in Finding Freedom.</p>

<p>The Cambridges shared a light-hearted snap of Harry beating them both in a running race at a joint engagement in London in 2017, accompanied by the caption: 'Wishing a very happy birthday to Prince Harry today!' </p>

<p>Prince William and Kate Middleton appeared eager to lay to rest any reports of a family rift and chose a light-hearted snap of Harry beating them both in a running race for their Instagram post. The image, taken in London in 2017, was accompanied by this simple caption </p>

<p>The Queen, 94, also sent her best wishes to her grandson on social media, posting a simple message alongside a photo of him smiling at her at a Buckingham Palace reception in 2017. Proud father Prince Charles, 71, opted for a snap of him laughing with his son at the Invictus Games in 2014 and a second portrait of Harry. </p>

<p>Despite tensions between Harry and William, heightened after the younger brother's decision to exit The Firm, royal sources have claimed the pair are back in regular contact and will make a point of speaking on his birthday today. </p>

<p>Harry will also chat to his father and his grandmother - whom he 'frequently calls and video-chats to', according to Nicholl.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month a source told Fabulous Digital that Meghan and Harry failed to tell the Queen about their Netflix deal before announcing it to the world. </p>

<p>Her Majesty had to be told by her aides about the couple's new venture - which involves a yet-to-be-named production company.</p>

<p>'Her Majesty is all too aware of the pitfalls of when senior royals embark on lucrative projects - Prince Edwards’ production flop and some of the deals Sarah Ferguson has signed over the years to name a few,' the source said.</p>

<p>'Her view is simple, the Royals are not for sale and danger surrounds high profile roles outside of the institution itself.'</p>
