<p>'He's been in Colorado and this was all a surprise. He was completely blindsided,' the source said.  </p>

<p>Since announcing their split earlier this year, Randolph and Underwood have had public dust ups about their relationship and break up. </p>

<p>In July, Randolph accused her ex of trying to 'monetize' their split by writing about it in the upcoming second edition of his book without her prior approval and though they agreed to remain silent on the reasons of the split.  </p>

<p>'I have gained so much clarity about what I want and more importantly what I need in a relationship,' she wrote at the time. 'I'm so excited for this next chapter of my life with new stories and new people. I can't thank y'all enough for your understanding and your support during this time.' </p>

<p>Adding: 'I would like to place on public record &amp; ask you politely to refrain from discussing our relationship, as we agreed... I would also like to ask that you don't cloud our great, 11/2 year relationship with a messy breakup. ' </p>

<p>'When our relationship ended we agreed to handle things as privately as possible as we attempted to navigate our new relationship as friends,' Underwood wrote to Instagram after Randolph appeared in a short segment for The Bachelor: Greatest Seasons of All Time. 'I chose to do that since we were living in this interim period, but obviously a lot changed this week.' </p>

<p>She declined to divulge much information, however, Underwood said he was upset to see how Chris and The Bachelor franchise focused solely on their split, it has been claimed.</p>

<p>'Cass stayed extremely professional and extremely quiet about our breakup,' Colton said during an interview with Reality Steve. 'What bugged me was the fact that that show took advantage of her.' </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Colton said he could see them getting engaged by the end of 2020.</p>

<p>'If she were here, she'd nudge me for saying this, but I think an engagement is something we'd both like to see this year,' he said. </p>

<p>'To put it very frank, after the show, we realized we weren't communicating as well as we once did,' he wrote in his memoir The First Time</p>
