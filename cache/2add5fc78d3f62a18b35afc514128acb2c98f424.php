<p>It is not yet known when the actress gave birth. The baby's gender and name have also yet to be publicly revealed.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted a representative for Felicity Jones for comment. </p>

<p>Over the past several months, the British actress hadn't been seen out and about, likely because of the global COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Pram: She pushed her precious cargo along the streets of the English capital in a blue pram</p>

<p>Bag: Ensuring she was totally prepared, the star carried a striped baby bag on her shoulder</p>

<p> Joy: Felicity looked elated as she steered the pram during her relaxing mother-and-baby stroll</p>

<p>However, Felicity and Charles are known to be a fiercely private couple, who rarely publicly share details about their home life.</p>

<p>Felicity first confirmed her pregnancy news after debuting her baby bump at The Aeronauts premiere in New York City in December, 17 months after tying the knot with director Charles Guard.</p>

<p>Felicity's representative first confirmed that she was expecting to The Hollywood Reporter, after she debuted her bump at The Aeronauts premiere.</p>

<p>The Theory Of Everything star dated Charles for two years before he proposed in May 2017, and they tied the knot in July 2018 at the picturesque Sudeley Castle in the Cotswolds, Oxfordshire.</p>

<p>Tresses: Still looking glam while casual, she wore her chestnut brown tresses in a lustrous bun</p>

<p>Natural beauty: The actress opted to keep her makeup light and minimal for the outing, letting her natural beauty shine through</p>

<p>Wed: She married her husband in July 2018 at the picturesque Sudeley Castle in the Cotswolds</p>

<p>Felicity and Charles are very private about their relationship and life together, but she did open up about her outlook on love in a 2014 interview with The Telegraph. </p>

<p>'I am definitely romantic, and I love romantic stories — that's why I keep making romantic movies,' she said.</p>

<p>'It's funny how seeing a love story never gets boring, because it's the dream isn't it? It's the dream to have a true connection with another human being,' she said.</p>

<p>At the time of the interview, she was single and had yet to meet her future husband. </p>

<p>Accomplishments: While Felicity enjoys a successful acting career, her husband is an established filmmaker, best known for directing the 2009 thriller The Unknown</p>

<p>Private: Felicity and Charles are known to be a fiercely private couple, who rarely publicly share details about their home life</p>

<p>Before meeting her husband, who is best known for directing the 2009 thriller The Unknown, Felicity dated sculptor Ed Fornieles for 10 years after they met at the Ruskin School of Art.</p>

<p>In 2016, Felicity told Harper's Bazaar she worried how having children might impact her career.</p>

<p>'Fortunately, I feel like we're in a new era, where it is empowering rather than limiting to have children,' she said.</p>

<p>'From what I can see from friends and relatives, women get stronger and more decisive from having children, they don't waste their time doing things they don't want to.'</p>
