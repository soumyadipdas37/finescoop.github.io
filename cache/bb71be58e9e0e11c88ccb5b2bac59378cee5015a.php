<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A map by Imperial College London predicts which areas will be hit with tough Covid-19 restrictions based on infection rates</p>

<p>Birmingham could be the next city put back into lockdown after infection rates doubled in a week, local leaders have warned.</p>

<p>West Midlands mayor Andy Street said even tougher restrictions were 'looking likely' now Birmingham's case rate had jumped to 69 per 100,000, up from 30 a week ago.</p>

<p>The Government announced all gatherings in England will be reduced from 30 people to six because of a worrying increase in infections right across the country.</p>

<p>But Mr Street said people in Birmingham could be hit with even tougher rules seen in the likes of Leicester and swathes of Manchester, Lancashire and Yorkshire.</p>

<p>These places have banned households from mixing in private homes or gardens and people are only allowed to dine out with people they already live with. </p>

<p>Local leaders in Birmingham are meeting with national health chiefs today to thrash out a plan to curb the escalating crisis.</p>

<p>Mr Street told Birmingham Live: 'Thus far, it (the virus) has concentrated in the younger age groups, that's why we're not saying that much increase in hospitalisations and deaths.</p>

<p>'But if we don't stop this it will translate into these elder age groups and we will have a very serious situation on our hands.'</p>

<p>He added the 'simplest form of restriction would be city-wide', adding that given the size of the current infection rate numbers further restrictions were now 'very, very likely'.</p>

<p>The alarm was raised in Birmingham at the weekend as the city's infection rate soared past the 50 mark, considered a good indicator of imminent restrictions. </p>

<p>Birmingham public health director Dr Justin Varney said: 'This is not a false alarm - we are on the precipice and if we are not careful we will be back where we were in April and May and lives will be lost.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, scientists running the Covid Symptom Tracker mobile app have warned they are noticing a significant rise in cases across the UK.</p>

<p>Nearly four million of people have been using King's College London's app and self-reporting symptoms, which has helped scientists monitor the virus's trajectory. </p>

<p>They say there has been 3,164 daily new cases of the disease on average over the two weeks up to September 4.</p>

<p>This is the highest number of cases the app has recorded since late June and the numbers have been climbing for the last few days.</p>

<p>The latest figures were based on the data from 8,456 swab tests done between 22 August to 4 September. </p>

<p>KCL now estimate that 30,948 people currently have symptomatic COVID in the UK.  </p>
