<p>You can do it! But Andy only had words of encouragement as he said Alex just needed to go 'nice and steady' before reassuring him it was easier climbing down than it was going up</p>

<p> Amusing: The presenter slowly made his way up the mast, being careful not to slip, claiming the cameramen would 'speed it up in post'</p>

<p>The duo rolled up their sleeves to help prepare food for the park's twelve hundred residents, including mixing an insect porridge to feed a hungry anteater, which included plenty of mealworms and termites. </p>

<p>Alex told MailOnline: 'We had a fun day filming the first episode of the new series at Longleat earlier this week. We met some koalas and fed the anteaters. </p>

<p>'I did have one moment of horror where I spilt some of the anteater porridge down my top. That was pretty disgusting. </p>
