<p>Mobile phone detection cameras will be active for the third double demerit period in NSW, with drivers facing a $457 fine and 10 demerit points if caught on the phone</p>

<p>NSW Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott said patrols will be active in the community to ensure the safety of road users.</p>

<p>'One or two mistakes on the road could cost you your licence,' Mr Elliott told reporters. </p>

<p>The double demerit period will run for four days from Friday October 2 to Monday October 5 inclusive.</p>

<p>It will be the third double demerit period where mobile phone detection cameras are used to catch out drivers.</p>

<p>Motorists caught using their phone behind the wheel will receive a $457 fine and 10 demerit points.</p>

<p>Drivers will lose six demerit points for driving without wearing a seat belt and 12 points if two of their passengers are travelling without wearing their belt.</p>

<p>'Operation Slowdown will see our Traffic and Highway Patrol officers targeting speeding, drink and drug driving, driving while fatigued, mobile phone, helmet and other traffic offences,' NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said.</p>

<p>'The message is clear – don't speed or drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the roads and waterways, and importantly use safety equipment, such as seat belts and life jackets because we know they really do save lives.'</p>

<p>There were six deaths on the road over the Labour Day long weekend in NSW last year, with the current 2020 state death toll at 236. </p>

<p>'One road fatality is one too many,' Mr Elliot said.</p>

<p>'Stick to the speed limit, put your phone down, and observe the road rules. We want people to arrive at their destination safely.</p>

<p>'As we all start to embrace the warmer weather, I urge everyone to abide by the road and maritime rules.</p>

<p>'We don't want to see a long weekend end in tragedy - so don't risk your life, or the lives of others, over poor decision making that could have lifelong repercussions.' </p>

<p>Motorists who are behind the wheel while under the influence of drugs or alcohol will face hefty fines this long weekend</p>
