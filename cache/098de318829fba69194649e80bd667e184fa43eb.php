<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Political correctness has invaded and struck at the heart of Germany with a series of strange new phrases in a new diversity-sensitive language guide.</p>

<p>Berlin city council   has told state employees in the capital to watch their language to avoid offence.</p>

<p>New guidelines put in place by the nanny state authority have led to guidance on every day phrases that they say should not be used. </p>

<p>Among the many phrases targeted by the PC brigade is asylum seeker. According to the new guide this term is misleading as there is a fundamental right to asylum.</p>

<p>Instead state employees should use the term persons requiring protection.</p>

<p>Foreigners should be replaced with 'residents without German citizenship' and people with a migrant background should be referred to as 'people with an international history.'</p>

<p>State workers in Berlin have been issued politically correct guidance which lists phrases they should not use</p>

<p>The new rules have been criticised across Germany.</p>

<p>Gunnar Schupelius, a commentator on the local daily newspaper BZ, said that a 'clique' of politicians was trying to influence people to believe what they think is right. </p>

<p>He wrote that they want to ensure people 'behave in accordance with their political ideology.'</p>

<p>The guidance has been turned into a 44-page guide and it forms part of a national diversity programme.</p>

<p>It aims to train Berlin's state employees to communicate 'with the people in this city,' regardless of their sexuality, gender, age, disability, religion or ethnic origin.</p>

<p>The booklet also states that if someone changes gender then officials should not say gender change but gender realignment.</p>

<p>While the German phrase Schwarz fahren, which translates as riding black, and is a widely used German term for fare dodging on public transport should not be used at all.</p>

<p>There are no penalties for failing to adhere to the PC Brigade's list of pointless changes as they are only a set of recommendations.</p>

<p>The PC guide was written by the State Office for Equal Treatment Against Discrimination, which is run by Justice Senator Dirk Behrendt, from the Green Party.</p>

<p>Justice Senator Dirk Behrendt, from the Green Party, who is behind the guidance</p>

<p>Berlin's centre-left city government is a coalition of the Greens with the Social Democrats and Left Party.</p>

<p>Mr Behrendt, in a press statement, said: 'Berlin is home to people from many different backgrounds and in very different situations</p>

<p>'Berliners should understand the administration as their own and therefore the administration should also be open to this diversity.</p>

<p>'If the diversity of Berlin is reflected in the administration, then that is a benefit for the entire city.'</p>
