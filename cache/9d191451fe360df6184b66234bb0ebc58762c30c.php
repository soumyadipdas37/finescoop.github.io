<p>Receiving the call, a 999 operator spoke to the suicidal man who could be heard saying: 'I swear to god I'm going to hang myself. I'm climbing the pyramid on the shaft thingy.</p>

<p>'I can't do f*** all 'cos I'm on probation so I may as well just go kill myself. All afternoon mate, I've thought about it and this is it. I've already put on Facebook 'RIP I'm gone.'</p>

<p>And when asked by the operator why he wanted to kill himself, Danny, replied: 'I can't even go to the doctor because of my anxiety and depression.'</p>

<p>'I'm in the middle of nowhere. I'm at the top of the pyramid. I can see right down it. i reckon if I fell, I'd hang onto a branch and snap and die.' </p>

<p>Another 999 phone operator (pictured) told how she has received calls from suicidal people in the past and has been on the end of the phone shaking</p>

<p>Turning to the camera, another concerned 999 operator explained: 'We've had 999 calls from suicidal people and I've been on the end of the phone shaking speaking to them.</p>

<p>You just think, "please, please let us have someone available to get to them. '</p>

<p>'I think the people that phone us, the majority of the time, it is a cry or help. But whose to day this time, it's not going to happen? I'm not going to make that decision.' </p>

<p>As the phone operator continued to urge Danny not to do anything stupid, he could be heard saying: 'If you want to come here and arrest me I'm going to run and hide. I'm going to go somewhere else to another mine shaft.'</p>

<p>Eventually, a helicopter was able to locate the man in question, and ground police were able to find him and bring him to safety.</p>

<p>Following the episode, social media was inundated with well-wishes for the man, with many adding they hope he receives the help he needs. </p>

<p>'Well done all officers on #callthecops tonight. So brave putting themselves at risk to find a man in urgent need of help. Hope he gets the help he needs,' wrote one, while a second added: 'Hopefully he will get the help he needs now.' </p>

<p>A third wrote: 'Amazing teamwork to find that poor lad, really shows that it's not just criminals that the police deal with. Great effort everyone, you all do an amazing job,' </p>
