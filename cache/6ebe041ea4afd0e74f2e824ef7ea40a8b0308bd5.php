<p>And on Sunday, Candice Warner revealed why she decided to take part in the gruelling new challenge show. </p>

<p>In a new trailer, the 35-year-old admits she wants her children to think 'it's not just daddy who is tough and strong,' citing her husband David's infamous ball-tampering scandal as the reason she joined the all-star line-up. </p>

<p>'It's not just daddy who is tough and strong': Candice Warner (left) revealed her husband David's (right) infamous ball-tampering scandal was the reason she signed up for SAS: Australia in a new trailer for the upcoming show </p>

<p>'There was a ball-tampering incident. My two kids having to face that media was shocking,' the former Ironwoman said. </p>

<p>'The hardest thing for me was being told that I was a really bad mother.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I'm doing this for my family. To show my kids that it's not just daddy who is tough and strong.' </p>

<p>It has been a difficult period for Candice - who gave birth to her third child, Isla, in July - after she suffered two miscarriages in 15 months since David's cheating incident in Cape Town in March 2018.</p>

<p>Proving herself: In the short clip, Candice revealed that she's 'doing this for her family' after being called a 'bad mother' amid the ball-tampering scandal </p>

<p>In an interview with Stellar last October, Candice reflected on the dark period her family faced - saying there were times her husband struggled to even get out of bed.</p>

<p>'Looking back, it was a very horrific time,' she told the publication. 'We had two miscarriages. It definitely took a toll on my body. It was heartbreaking. I thought, 'What more can be taken from me?'</p>

<p>Candice made the decision to be the 'strength and rock' for her husband and their children, after David was hit with a ban from the sport for a year for his role in the ball-tampering ordeal.</p>

<p>Rather than hide away in shame, the model was determined to 'power on' through the trauma, and get her husband back into fitness and into a routine.</p>

<p>David, former Australian captain Steve Smith and player Cameron Bancroft were slapped with bans for conspiring to cheat against South Africa in March 2018 by rubbing the ball with sandpaper.</p>

<p>David's 12-month ban has since ended, and he was selected for Australia's preliminary squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.</p>

<p>Candice decided to look at the positive aspects of Warner's ban - in that his doting daughters could have an abundance of 'daddy time' with their father.</p>

<p>'David and I now look at each other and say, 'How did we get through that?',' she added. 'But we did. We now know for sure that nothing will ever break us.'</p>
