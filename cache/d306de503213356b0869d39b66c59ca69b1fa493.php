<p>Exciting: Emma is set to make her long-awaited debut as Princess Diana in The Crown's fourth series, which will be released on Netflix in November</p>

<p>Candid: The Grantchester star recently said she got to know Princess Diana 'like you would a friend,' while discussing taking on the iconic role</p>

<p>No mean feat: Emma also revealed that she needed 10 people to help get her into the 'massive' replica wedding dress</p>

<p>She will portray Diana during the early part of her relationship with the Prince of Wales, before handing over the role to Elizabeth Debicki, for series five and six of the hit Netflix drama.</p>

<p>The Misbehaviour star explained how she developed a sense of 'empathy and understanding' for the late princess.</p>

<p>She told the publication: 'I feel I've got to know Diana like you would a friend. I know that sounds really weird, but I get a great sense of companionship from her.</p>

<p>'I suppose, over time, you kind of start to patch together a sense of empathy and a sense of understanding. I love figuring people out.'  </p>

<p>The young actress also recalled filming the first scene with Diana in her wedding dress.</p>

<p>Beauty: On the moment she tried on the dress for the first time, she said: 'I walked out and everyone went completely silent. More than anything else I wear in the series, it's so... it's her.'</p>

<p>The original ivory silk taffeta wedding gown designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel was hand-embroidered with 10,000 pearls and featured a 25ft train.</p>

<p>Emma revealed that she had needed 10 others to help her put on the replica gown, and that the crew went silent seeing her in it for the first time.</p>

<p>She told the magazine: 'The Emmanuels, who designed the original, gave us the patterns, and then it was made for me.' David Emmanuel was a consultant on set.</p>

<p>'We were filming the scene when you first see her in the wedding dress - I think it was Lancaster House in London - and I had a team of about 10 people helping me put it on, because it's massive.</p>

<p>'I walked out and everyone went completely silent. More than anything else I wear in the series, it's so... it's her.'  </p>

<p>Keeping quiet: Emma also admitted that she had kept the role secret, but that some friends had correctly guessed her casting</p>

<p>The immense train of the original dress was famously creased when Diana arrived for the wedding, prompting Elizabeth Emmanuel to whisper to David: 'Oh it's creased. But when she came out of that carriage it was the most wonderful vision I'd ever seen.'</p>

<p>Emma also admitted that she had kept the role secret, but that some friends had correctly guessed her casting. </p>

<p>She said: 'I didn't tell anyone for a while. I love my mates but I think it would have got out.</p>

<p>'My friends from school did this incredible thing, where they made me a scrapbook filled with all of the screenshots from our group WhatsApp, where I have said, 'Oh my God, guys, I've been invited to read'.</p>

<p>'Or a random conversation we'd had four years ago when I said, 'Isn't Diana amazing!'   </p>

<p>Diana married Charles in 1981, and the couple welcomed sons William in 1982 and Harry in 1984. After separating in 1991, the couple divorced in 1997.</p>

<p>Emma's casting was announced in April 2019, with The Crown's creator Peter Morgan calling her 'a brilliant talent who immediately captivated us when she came in for the part of Diana Spencer.'</p>

<p>'As well as having the innocence and beauty of a young Diana, she also has, in abundance, the range and complexity to portray an extraordinary woman who went from anonymous teenager to becoming the most iconic woman of her generation.'   </p>
