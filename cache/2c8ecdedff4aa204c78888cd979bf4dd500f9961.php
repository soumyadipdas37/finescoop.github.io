<p>Upsetting: Tamzin Outhwaite has claimed that Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli (pictured) refused to let her star in close-ups for an advert, as she was struggling with acne</p>

<p>'It was Don Johnson playing the piano. We were the champagne bubbles on the piano keys. We were in gold all-in-ones.' </p>

<p>Bruno was our choreographer, we were filming in Barcelona. One morning my acne came up very bad around my jaw line, it was raised and it couldn't be covered.</p>

<p>'I remember Bruno said, 'I'm really sorry, but I'm going to have to sit you out for this close up shot'. It was because of my acne. </p>

<p>'I was mortified. I do remember feeling mortified that something so physical on my face was stopping me doing what I loved.'</p>
