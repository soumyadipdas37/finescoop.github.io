<p>The London box, featuring Mr Shonibare, is in Brixton. Sir Lenny is honoured in Belfast, Mr Tull – the first black player for Rangers – in Glasgow and Mrs Seacole in Cardiff, pictured.</p>

<p>Peter De Norville, Royal Mail’s head of diversity and inclusion, said: ‘Black History Month is a great opportunity to celebrate the contributions that black people have made to this country over many generations.</p>

<p>‘We are also using it as an opportunity to celebrate the vital work that our black employees do throughout the nation, from the mail bag to the meeting room.’</p>

<p>The aim is for the postboxes to help people mark the success of black Britons, Royal Mail said.</p>

<p>The London postbox is in Acre Lane in Brixton, which is near to Black Cultural Archives - a leading museum for the British black community.</p>

<p>In Cardiff, the black postbox celebrating Black History Month features Mary Seacole</p>

<p>This box features the image Queuing at the RA by Yinka Shonibare.</p>

<p>He said: ‘As a citizen of the commonwealth, it was particularly important to me to be making a visible contribution in a historic public space.’</p>

<p>Footballer Walter Tull, who become the first black player for Rangers, appears on the Glasgow postbox, in Byres Road in the city’s West End.</p>

<p>He featured in a set of stamps released in 2018 to mark the centenary of the end of the First World War, and was also the first black Army officer to command troops in a regular unit.</p>

<p>He was killed in action during the war.</p>

<p>Mary Seacole, who nursed wounded British soldiers back to health during the Crimean War and built a dedicated place for them to recuperate known as the British Hotel, appears on the Cardiff postbox at King Edward VII Avenue.</p>

<p>Sir Lenny Henry, the stand-up comedian, actor, singer, writer and television presenter and co-founder of the Comic Relief charity, is honoured by the postbox in Bedford Street, Belfast.</p>
