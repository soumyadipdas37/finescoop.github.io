<p>Engineers from the University of Toronto created a computer model to estimate how many electric vehicles would be required in a heavily car dependent country.</p>

<p>The team focused on the US, as currently only 0.3 per cent of vehicles are electric and it is a wealthy nation with a high overall rate of car ownership per capita. </p>

<p>To meet UN climate targets, about 90 per cent of passenger vehicles in the US would need to be electric by 2050 - something the Canadian team say is 'unrealistic'.</p>

<p>Instead, the team suggests countries focus on a massive investment in public transport and redesigning cities to allow for more trips by bicycle or foot.  </p>

<p>UN climate targets require member countries to take action to prevent average global temperatures from rising more than 3.6°F above pre-industrial levels by 2100. </p>

<p>Engineers from the University of Toronto created a computer model to estimate how many electric vehicles would be required in a heavily car dependent country</p>

<p>There are more than seven million electric vehicles (EV) in operation around the world, compared with only about 20,000 a decade ago, the Toronto team said.</p>

<p>While this is a massive change, it won't be 'nearly enough to address the global climate crisis' on its own, they explained.</p>

<p>Lead author Alexandre Milovanoff, a PhD student at the University of Toronto, said people think a larger-scale shift to electric vehicles will solve climate problems. </p>

<p>'I think a better way to look at it is this: EVs are necessary, but on their own, they are not sufficient,' the study author explained. </p>

<p>Published in the journal Nature Climate Change, the team found the US would need to have about 350 million electric vehicles on the road by 2050, or 90 percent. </p>

<p>'It's true that sales are growing fast, but even the most optimistic projections suggest that by 2050, the US fleet will only be at about 50 per cent EVs,' said Milovanoff.</p>

<p>They decided to run a detailed analysis of what a large-scale shift to EVs would mean in terms of emissions and related impacts.   </p>

<p>Depending on EVs would also create a higher demand for electricity, the researchers said, with new power plants and infrastructure needing to be built.</p>

<p>According to the paper, a fleet of 350 million EVs would increase annual electricity demand by 1,730 TWh, or about 41 per cent of current levels.  </p>

<p>The shift could also impact what's known as the demand curve - the way that demand for electricity rises and falls at different times of day - which would make managing the national electrical grid more complex. </p>

<p>Finally, there are technical challenges to do with the supply of critical materials, such as lithium, cobalt and manganese for batteries.</p>

<p>There are more than seven million electric vehicles (EV) in operation around the world, compared with only about 20,000 a decade ago, the Toronto team said</p>

<p>The team concludes that getting to 90 per cent EV ownership by 2050 is an unrealistic scenario. </p>

<p>Instead, what they recommend is a mix of policies, including many designed to shift people out of personal passenger vehicles in favour of other forms of transportation.</p>

<p>These could include massive investment in public transit - subways, commuter trains, buses - as well as the redesign of cities to allow for more trips to be taken via active modes, such as bicycles or on foot. </p>

<p>They could also include strategies such as greater adoption of telecommuting, a shift that is already underway as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Study co-author Heather MacLean said EVs do reduce emissions but they 'don't get us out of having to do the things we already know we need to do'. </p>

<p>'We need to rethink our behaviours, the design of our cities, and even aspects of our culture. Everybody has to take responsibility for this.' </p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Nature Climate Change. </p>
