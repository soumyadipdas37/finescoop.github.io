<p>The Reds' recent signing of Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich is likely to see Oxlade-Chamberlain fall down the pecking order at the club and get limited chances.</p>

<p>Wolves are eyeing up a shock move Liverpool midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</p>

<p>The arrival of Thiago Alcantara means Oxlade-Chamberlain will fall down pecking order</p>

<p>The versatile attacker made 30 appearances for Jurgen Klopp's side last season as he helped them storm to their first ever Premier League title.</p>

<p>However, he has never managed to cement a place in Liverpool's starting side due to injury problems and tough competition for places.</p>

<p>That competition has now become even stiffer, with Alcantara's arrival earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Liverpool would want to receive as much of the £25m they splashed out on the 27-year-old</p>

<p>Liverpool would want to receive as much of the £25million they splashed out on the 27-year-old from Arsenal back in 2017.</p>

<p>He has been out of action so far this season after picking up another injury during the club's pre-season tour in Austria.</p>

<p>The two Premier League sides have already managed to get deals over the line this window, with Diogo Jota heading to Anfield and £9million signing Ki-Jana Hoever heading the other way to Wolves.</p>
