<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian makeup artist has warned against getting lip fillers at 'random a**e places' after the injections she had been getting for five years migrated up to her nose, and she was forced to have them dissolved.</p>

<p>Shani Grimmond, 23, shared a video on her YouTube channel detailing the process of getting filler removed from your face, saying she was 'excited and nervous' about her visit to a reputable clinic. </p>

<p>'I've been looking for a good place to dissolve my lips for a year and I finally found it,' she said, mentioning Angel Aesthetics Clinic in Brisbane, Queensland.</p>

<p>Shani Grimmond, 23, shared a video on her YouTube channel detailing the process of getting filler removed from your face, saying she was 'excited and nervous' about her clinic visit (pictured before getting them dissolved)</p>

<p>'I've been looking for a good place to dissolve my lips for a year and I finally found a place,' she said, shouting out Angel Aesthetics Clinic on Queensland's Gold Coast (pictured left at 18 and right at 23)</p>

<p>The popular beauty blogger said she first dabbled with cosmetic injectables at age 18 and has a total of 6mL of filler in her lips, which has been inserted by six different beauty salons.</p>

<p>While she was happy with the results for many years, more recently she started noticing that it 'looked like she had a mouth guard in' because her top lip was protruding.  </p>

<p>'So we've got filler in my lips that hasn't dissolved naturally and instead has migrated above my lip. It's really quite scary to be honest,' she said.</p>

<p>Shani wanted to 'start again' and decided to get all of the filler removed, a process which involves numbing the lips before injecting hyaluronidase into them (pictured left after getting them dissolved and right four days later)</p>

<p>Hyaluronidase is a dissolving agent which helps the body breakdown the filler itself.</p>

<p>The needles can leave the patient swollen and with significant bruising so Shani was prepared for two weeks spent at home recovering.</p>

<p>She documented the experience by sharing footage of her lips immediately after the treatment, a week later - when she had to get more hyaluronidase injected into her puffy top lip - and almost three weeks on, when she looked like an '18-year-old version of herself'.  </p>

<p>'I am so relieved that it's done. This is the lesson I have had to learn. Going to random places and I don't know what they're putting in there... this is what happens,' she said.</p>

<p>Although her lips have now returned to their previous state (pictured), Shani is hoping to get them refilled slightly to achieve a natural result</p>

<p>The maximum amount she will get put back in is 2mls.</p>

<p>Many of her loyal followers were pleased to see Shani's lip reduction and said it made the youthful brunette look even younger.</p>

<p>'You look so much younger without the filler, the natural lips look so nice,' one woman said.</p>

<p>'It's actually comforting to see all of these influencers getting their filler dissolved and being aware of the migration and promoting a more natural look,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'I totally understand you like yourself more with bigger lips, but girl, I actually love your natural lips SO MUCH I think it honestly makes you look younger and suits you better'.</p>

<p>She will be uploading a separate video showcasing her new, slightly plumper lips.   </p>
