<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Parents having their children baptised face an agonising decision over having grandparents present after Christenings were limited to just six people. </p>

<p>Downing Street confirmed today that the Christian rite of faith will be subject to the Rule of Six. </p>

<p>The decision has been taken despite weddings being allowed to go ahead with 15 guests from Monday and funerals allowed up to 30 mourners.</p>

<p>The decision will leave parents in a quandary. The baby is included in the total, plus a priest. </p>

<p>If both parents are present that leaves only two more places to cover godparents and grandparents - or any other friends and family they wish to have present. </p>

<p>The Church of England website suggests those being baptised should have 'at least three' godparents, although the parents can take up two of those roles, plus one other. </p>

<p>The rule change comes days after Boris Johnson had his own son baptised. </p>
