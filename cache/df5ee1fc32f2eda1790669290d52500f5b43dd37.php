<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victoria Police have arrested a protester who sang the John Farnham hit You're The Voice at officers to protest Victoria's harsh lockdowns.</p>

<p>The man, who had a GoPro strapped to his chest and was waving the Australian, British and American flags, bellowed off-key to more than 10 police officers in Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens. </p>

<p>'I'm the voice try and understand it,' he sang as the officers approached. 'I'm makin' a noise and I'm makin' it clear - woaah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh'.</p>

<p>The song was Australia's biggest hit in 1986, and ranked number six in radio station Triple M's 'Ozzest 100' most Australian songs of all time in 2018.</p>

<p>'I'm the voice try and understand it' the man bellows, waving three allied flags on one pole</p>

<p>'Are we going to sit in silence and sit in fear?' he shouted as three officers ripped away his megaphone and grabbed his flag pole.</p>

<p>'What for? What for?' he shouts as they tackled him to the ground.</p>

<p>Four police subdued him on the ground to arrest him as his friend, wrapped in a Eureka flag and wearing a beanie talks calmly to more officers.</p>

<p>The flag was flown at the 1854 Eureka Stockade at Ballarat, a famous uprising by miners against the Victorian colonial authority.</p>

<p>The friend can be heard telling police he knew there are coronavirus restrictions. </p>

<p>'I know we've got no freedom at all... not allowed to go 5km, not allowed to walk without a mask,' he said.</p>

<p>The police were not impressed. Three officers tackled the protester, taking his megaphone and grabbing his flag pole. Pictured: the first officer moves in</p>

<p>The Aussie rock fan was tackled to the ground, the GoPro strapped to his chest recording the moment he hit the grass</p>

<p>The officers discuss arresting him, saying he was already arrested the week before in the same spot.</p>

<p>'That's it, we are here to protest,' the man told them.</p>

<p>'We're here to protest against our loss of freedom - it's just craziness. This is Melbourne is it? I don't think we're North Korea.'</p>

<p>It was not known what day the arrest happened, but the video surfaced Monday on a social media account of Antifa supporter 'Cam Smith' (not his real name) who hosts a community radio show with anonymous anarcho-communist 'Andy Fleming'. </p>

<p>Four officers ended up restraining the man on the ground while his friend, wearing a beanie and draped in a Eureka flag, told police they were there to protest for their freedom</p>

<p>It is not known when the two-man protest happened but it may have been Saturday's 'Melbourne Freedom Walk' planned for the Tan track which was censored by Facebook (pictured: the censorship notice)</p>

<p>'You can have little a maskhole being taken down mid-Farnsey, as a treat,' wrote 'Smith' on posting the video to social media.</p>

<p>About 340 people committed to attend a 'Melbourne Freedom Walk' protest at the Royal Botanic Gardens on Saturday.</p>

<p>However the protest's Facebook page was hit with a 'legal restriction' for encouraging a breach of Stage 4 lockdown laws.</p>

<p>Four men were charged with incitement in the lead-up to the previous Saturday’s ‘Freedom Day’ rally in Melbourne at the Shrine of Remembrance and Albert Park which resulted in violent scuffles, 17 arrests and more than 160 fines. </p>

<p>Individual and group protests have been rising as Melbourne struggles under a tough Stage Four lockdown that has been in place since August 2.</p>

<p>Mounting pressure has been put on Premier Daniel Andrews to re-evaluate his four-step road out of coronavirus lockdown by business leaders, the Federal Government, small business and ordinary people who are feeling the strain of losing their income. </p>

<p>Premier Andrews, however, has defended his tough measures saying they are the only way to be sure that the state does not ease restrictions too soon, resulting in lockdowns having to be re-introduced.</p>

<p>The tight Melbourne lockdown will not ease significantly until Step Two is reached, which will allow more than 100,000 workers to go back to work in construction, manufacturing, and maintenance.</p>

<p>Victoria's government is aiming at September 28, however progress to Step Two depends on improvement in the 14-day rolling average of new case numbers. </p>

<p>The 14-day rolling average of new daily cases has been falling rapidly to reach 56.9 on Sunday. Step Two easings will be triggered when new daily cases hit between 30 and 50 per day for 14 days, the Victorian Government says on it's website.</p>

<p>The rolling average has been falling dramatically, reaching 56.9 on Sunday down from 120.8 two weeks previously.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded 35 new cases of coronavirus on Monday bringing the total number of cases to 19,872 with 729 deaths, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>There are 1075 active infections of which 122 patients are in hospital and 12 in intensive care.</p>

<p>Of the 1075 active infections, the vast bulk - 1019 cases - are in Melbourne's metropolitan area, subject to the Stage Four restrictions. </p>

<p>The Stage Four restrictions were eased slightly on Monday as Step One on the road to recovery was implemented.</p>

<p>The Step One changes were minor: one extra hour of outdoors time, one less hour of curfew and allowing people who live alone to socialise with one other person. </p>

<p>Step one: The first step came into effect at 11.59pm on September 13.</p>

<p>Step two: The second step will be implemented when Melbourne has 30-50 COVID-19 cases a day on average over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on September 28. </p>

<p>Step three: The move to step three will occur when there is a daily statewide average of five new cases over the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on October 26.</p>

<p>Step four: The move to step four will come when there have been no new COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days. The aim is for this to come into place on November 23.</p>
