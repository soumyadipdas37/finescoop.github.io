<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An 18-month mystery as to why a Welsh village's broadband was plagued with issues at the same time every morning has finally been solved.</p>

<p>Villagers living in the Powys village of Aberhosan were suddenly struck with poor broadband connectivity and slow speeds every morning at 7am.</p>

<p>But engineers were left scratching their heads when repeated visits to the village, near to the market town of Machynlleth, found the network was working perfectly.</p>

<p>Baffled BT workers even replaced a large sections of cable that served the village in a bid to fix the mystery issue.</p>

<p>They were even forced to call in the Openreach Chief Engineer team, a crack team described as the company's 'SAS', to fix the problem.</p>

<p>Now, after 18 months, the issue has finally be identified - as an old-fashioned TV.  </p>

<p>Villagers living in the Powys village of Aberhosan (pictured), Wales, were suddenly struck with poor broadband connectivity and slow speeds every morning at 7am</p>

<p>Engineers discovered the TV set was emitting a burst of electrical interference at 7am each day.</p>

<p>They traced the signal to a property in the village and the 'mortified' householder confirmed that they switched on their old television at that time every day – causing the broadband in the village to be affected.</p>

<p>The householder immediately agreed to switch off the television and not to use it again.</p>

<p>There have been no further issues reported with the broadband network in Aberhosan since.</p>

<p>Michael Jones, a local engineer for Openreach, said the company's chief engineering team helped to solve the mystery by using a spectrum analyser to look for a phenomenon known as Shine (single high-level impulse noise).</p>

<p>'We walked up and down the village in the torrential rain at 6am to see if we could find an 'electrical noise' to support our theory,' Mr Jones said.</p>

<p>'And at 7am, like clockwork, it happened. Our device picked up a large burst of electrical interference in the village.</p>

<p>'The source of the 'electrical noise' was traced to a property in the village.</p>

<p>Engineers discovered an old-fashioned TV set in a house in the village (pictured) was emitting a burst of electrical interference in at 7am each day - causing the issue</p>

<p>'It turned out that at 7am every morning the occupant would switch on their old TV which would in turn knock out broadband for the entire village.</p>

<p>'As you can imagine, when we pointed this out to the resident they were mortified that their old second-hand TV was the cause of an entire village's broadband problems, and they immediately agreed to switch it off and not use it again.'</p>

<p>Suzanne Rutherford of Openreach said such issues are not as rare as people may think.</p>

<p>'Anything with electric components – from outdoor lights to microwaves to CCTV cameras – can potentially have an impact on your broadband connection,' she said.</p>

<p>She advised people to ensure their electrical appliances are properly certified and meet British standards.</p>

<p>Aberhosan will be connected to fibre broadband later this year as part of Openreach's work with the Welsh Government to expand the network in rural Wales.</p>
