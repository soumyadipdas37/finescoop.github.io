<p>Andrew Cuomo: 'Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg selflessly pursued truth and justice in a world of division, giving voice to the voiceless and uplift those who were pushed aside by forces of hate and indifference'</p>

<p>Stefanie McKenzie, a Columbia University student from Kenya, told New York Daily News that Ginsburg was a personal hero.</p>

<p>'She represented all of the ideals I believe in,' McKenzie, 19, told NYDN.  'Going to the school, there are all these big names and it gets hard, you lose focus, but she didn’t, she fought all her life and I find that so inspiring.</p>

<p>After her death, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo revealed that a statue of Ginsburg would be built in Brooklyn. </p>

<p>'Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg selflessly pursued truth and justice in a world of division, giving voice to the voiceless and uplift those who were pushed aside by forces of hate and indifference,' said Cuomo.</p>

<p>'As a lawyer, jurist, and professor, she redefined gender equity and civil rights and ensured America lived up to her founding ideals - she was a monumental figure of equality, and we can all agree that she deserves a monument in her honor.'</p>

<p>In Washington D.C., Capitol Hill was transformed into a makeshift garden as loads of bouquets and single stem flowers overcame the sector.</p>

<p>People of all generations stood outside the winding steps to mourn Ginsburg's death in the city where she worked tirelessly and with fierce dedication for decades.</p>

<p>Several banners held quotes from Ginsburg, including one that read 'Women Belong in All Places Where Decisions Are Being Made.' </p>

<p>Amy Weaver gathered before the Supreme Court building on Saturday for an evening candlelight vigil. She drove 10 hours from the Chattahoochee River in Georgia after learning of Ginsburg's death.</p>

<p>'When I wanted to go to law school, I was told I couldn’t work and study at the same time,' Weaver told National Geographic.</p>

<p> 'I was divorced with two young children, and I was told I couldn’t do it all. Women like RBG were showing me I could.'   </p>

<p>Sarah Silberman visited the National Portrait Gallery this weekend to view the portraits of the four women Supreme Court Justices: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Conno, Elena Kagan and Soni Sotomayor.</p>

<p>'I started coming to see this portrait when I was applying to law school, back in 2015,' she told National Geographic.</p>

<p>'Then I just made a point of visiting once a year. Any time I struggled in law school, any time I felt like I wasn’t going to make it, I thought of her caring for her husband with cancer and for her child, while still taking classes. She made me believe I could make it through.'</p>

<p>And Paula Hughes, a former public defender, told National Geographic that she drove more than six hours from Columbus, Ohio, to Washington D.C. to mourn Ginsburg's death.</p>

<p>She brought along her 10-year-old daughter, Lilly.</p>

<p>'I’ve been an RBG groupie for years, and I always told my children that the women lawyers and women judges that came before me were the only reason I was allowed to practice,' Hughes told the publication.</p>

<p>'My older kids knew I would fall apart when I heard the news, so they told my sister first, and she broke it to me.'</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the city, a number of painted murals of Ginsburg appeared on store fronts and building exteriors as locals grappled with the loss. </p>

<p>Rose Jaffe, a local artist, told WUSA 9 that she was commissioned to create one of the murals, but did not know how the community would react to her piece.</p>

<p>Luckily, she was pleasantly surprised by the outpouring of love and compassion.</p>

<p>'I didn’t know what to expect. And this is just blowing me away. I hope that this lives on as a monument to her,' said Jaffe.</p>

<p>Christily St. Sauver was one resident who visited the mural and, as she held back tears, told WUSA 9 that Ginsburg's commitment to public service deeply impacted her own.</p>

<p>'My thanks to her is that I was an air force officer and a mother. That being one, I didn’t have to give up the other, because of a case that she argued,' St. Sauver said.</p>

<p>Murals of Ruth Bader Ginsburg were commissioned to artists and quickly appeared across Washington D.C. after the Justice died inside her home on Friday (pictured)</p>

<p>'I'm just really grateful for what she has done for women in this country and for women at this school,'  Jin Lee, a second-year Harvard Law student, told WGBH. </p>

<p>Ginsburg was one of eight woman in a class of 552 men when she enrolled at Harvard Law School.</p>

<p>'Obviously, it's a pretty big blow to lose her on the court right now, and to lose her as an icon to so many people everywhere,'  Heidi Mitchell, a political consultant, told WGBH.</p>

<p>'But it's also nice to just be able to show our appreciation for everything she stood for.'</p>

<p>'You feel the loss of her and the legacy that she left, and you wonder who else is going to be the next person that's going to do as much as she did for women in law,' Perez told WGBH.</p>

<p>'I definitely feel a sense of duty to do something to make a difference. In her name, but also, that’s why we're all here.'</p>

<p>On the West Coast, admirers of Ginsburg's also held vigils and created makeshift murals for the late Justice.</p>

<p>Residents gathered outside the Sacramento County Courthouse, some with candles and photos of Ginsburg, before attending another vigil at the California State Capitol, Capradio reports.</p>

<p>Lynn Lenzi, of North Natomas, told Capradio that she visited the memorial to remember Ginsburg's legacy of fighting for women.</p>

<p>'She paved the way for women in all walks of life, and she worked tirelessly to break down the norms of society at the time, discrimination against women of all races and creeds,' said Lenzi.</p>

<p>'She was someone who you admired. We're just here to pay our respects and say goodbye.' </p>

<p>A Sacramento-native said she wanted to support others like Ginsburg who were 'trying to help those that are truly challenged.'</p>

<p>'Ruth was an incredible woman that stood for so much righteous,'  Maria Dickerson told Capradio. </p>

<p>'And we've been having such a hard time, and she was an incredible fighter and I think that it is very important to support where we care as much as we can.'      </p>
