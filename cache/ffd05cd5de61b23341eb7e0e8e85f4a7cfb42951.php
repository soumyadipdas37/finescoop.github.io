<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Plans to restore rail and bus services to normality have been ditched by one of Britain's biggest transport operators because of fresh coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>David Brown, the boss of Go-Ahead Group, said his company had been hoping to increase capacity on buses – until the Government's work from home U-turn this week.</p>

<p>Passenger numbers on buses and trains plummeted during the virus lockdown, with usage recovering in recent weeks but still remaining far below normal levels.</p>

<p>Hard road: Passenger numbers on buses and trains plummeted during the virus lockdown, with usage recovering in recent weeks but still remaining far below normal levels</p>

<p>Go-Ahead, which commands about 11 per cent of the UK regional bus market, yesterday revealed it had swung into a loss of £200,000 in the year ended June 27, after making a £97million profit last year. </p>

<p>That came despite its revenues rising by 6 per cent to £3.9billion.</p>

<p>Brown said: 'We were starting to believe over the last week that things were going to get back to normal.'</p>

<p>But restrictions put in place this week are expected to hit passenger levels again. </p>

<p>After weeks of saying that employees who could return to their workplace should, the Prime Minister on Tuesday asked them to again work from home if possible. </p>

<p>The change is expected to result in fewer white-collar workers using public transport to get to work.</p>

<p>Brown questioned why people can go to a pub but are advised against all but essential travel and insisted that buses and trains were safe if passengers wore masks and followed social distancing rules.</p>

<p>Go-Ahead's regional buses are carrying between 50 per cent and 60 per cent  of their pre-Covid passenger numbers.</p>
