<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Newcastle head coach Steve Bruce has revealed injured duo Allan Saint-Maximin and Jamal Lewis suffered no lasting damage during Sunday's 3-0 Premier League defeat by Brighton.</p>

<p>Frenchman Saint-Maximin limped off before the break having aggravated an ankle problem, while £13.5million summer signing Lewis suffered a cut eye in a challenge which led to Yves Bissouma's late dismissal.</p>

<p>Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Wednesday night's Carabao Cup third round trip to Morecambe, Bruce said: 'Saint-Maximin had a scan on his ankle. He's tweaked it and twisted it, but we don't think it's that serious.</p>

<p>Steve Bruce is thankful there is no lasting damage to summer signing Jamal Lewis</p>

<p>Lewis suffered a cut eye in a challenge which led to Yves Bissouma's late dismissal</p>

<p>'We don't think he'll make tomorrow, but he'll have a chance for Sunday.</p>

<p>'We were worried about Jamal's eye, but that seems to be OK, although it's closed at the minute and has a cut above it. He won't be involved in the cup game, but thankfully there's no lasting damage.'</p>

<p>Bruce made 10 changes for the 1-0 victory over Blackburn in the last round and will adopt a similar approach this time around.</p>

<p>He said: 'We all have to look at the situation and have a bit of rotation. Now, we've got a squad of players where we're able to pick a different XI.</p>

<p>'We'll pick a team I hope is going to be good enough and strong enough to get us into the next round.'</p>

<p>Allan Saint-Maximin limped off before the break having aggravated an ankle problem</p>

<p> But while he will miss Wednesday's game he could be fit to face Tottenham on Sunday</p>
