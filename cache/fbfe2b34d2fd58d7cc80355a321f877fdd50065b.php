<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ed Sheeran's local pub, which is nearby his £3.7million 'mini village' in Suffolk, has been forced to close after a coronavirus scare. </p>

<p>A worker at The Dennington Queen has tested positive and has now shut until further notice. </p>

<p>Ed and his wife Cherry were regulars at the pub in Dennington, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, before the coronavirus lockdown begun. </p>

<p>The pub, on the A1120 which runs through the heart of the county between the A140 and A12 shared the news on their Facebook today. </p>

<p>A worker at The Dennington Queen, in Dennington, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, has tested positive and has now shut until further notice</p>

<p>The statement said: 'We are sorry to advise that a member of our staff has tested positive for Covid-19. </p>

<p>'We take the health of our staff &amp; patrons extremely seriously &amp; so with regret we have decided to implement a temporary closure whilst further staff testing and investigations are carried out. </p>

<p>'We will provide further updates as &amp; when possible &amp; will be contacting customers who have been in the premises recently &amp; indeed have bookings with us in the coming week. </p>

<p>'Thank you for your understanding &amp; patience in this matter. </p>

<p>'If you have any concerns please refer to the Government guidelines/website.'  </p>

<p>Landlord Jon Reeves and his wife Lorna have run the popular pub for the last 13 years but now are struggling through lockdown as it's been forced to shut.  </p>

<p>Many locals are shocked because they had not expected their rural community to be affected. </p>

<p>One said: 'It's a terrible shame and we hope the person affected will be OK. But it shows that nowhere is completely safe, even a sleepy little place like this. </p>

<p>'Jon and his team at the pub have been brilliant during the epidemic - they have organised takeaways and deliveries to some of the more vulnerable people who live here. </p>

<p>'It's been very difficult but the whole community has come together. </p>

<p>'We are a small village of just 600 people and we all support the pub because it is a vital part of community - we only have one part-time shop. It shows that nowhere is safe from the virus.' </p>

<p>Ed grew up in historic market town Framlington and since moving close to Dennington he has transformed the modest property, even building his own pub. </p>

<p>But it has not been without its critics. Some locals accuse him of over-developing the site to the detriment of wildlife and the neighbourhood.   </p>

<p>Building on Ed's £3.7million 'mini-village' in Framlingham started in 2012 and, in April last year, he was buying the home of a neighbour for £875,000. </p>

<p>His neighbour had complained 'enough is enough' about his building work and objected to his plans to build a tree house and 32ft chapel.</p>

<p>In 2012, he bought his first property - a detached farm house and surrounding land for £895,000. Around the same time, he acquired a Grade II listed 16th century home for £450,000. </p>

<p>He bought the four-bed detached house opposite for £925,000 in 2016 and the bungalow on the other side of his drive for £525,000 in 2017. </p>

<p>In June 2019, planning permission was given for signs at The Lancaster Lock, the pub he built.  </p>
