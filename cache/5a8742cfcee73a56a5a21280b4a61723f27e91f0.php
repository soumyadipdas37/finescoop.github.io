<p>Talking about Songs From My Heart in a statement earlier this month, Amanda said: 'People think they know who I am because they see me being loud and outrageous on the television or radio. </p>

<p>'That is a part of me but really I'm all about my family. This album is all the songs I've loved in my life, sung for the people who mean the most to me. It's a very emotional album that everyone can relate to.'</p>

<p>She added: ' I had a tape recorder as a little girl and would sing into it dreaming of this moment.</p>

<p>'There is a story behind every song on the album, celebrating life, love and loss – the darkest and happiest moments in my life so far. It is literally my heart laid bare.'</p>

<p>Songs From My Heart is set to be released on October 2.  </p>
