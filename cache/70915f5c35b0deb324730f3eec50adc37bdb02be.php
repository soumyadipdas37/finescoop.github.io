<p>Laine-Ella Hyland, from the Gold Coast, was reported missing after she left her Main Beach home 'because of a disagreement with her mother' on August 18. </p>

<p>She hasn't been heard from since she reportedly visited a friend's house on August 24 and Queensland Police issued the urgent alert on Thursday.    </p>

<p>Police also released CCTV video of Laine-Ella's last confirmed sighting and called for 'urgent public assistance' in finding the missing girl.  </p>

<p>An Amber Alert was issued for Laine-Ella Hyland (pictured), 11, from the Gold Coast, on Thursday. She left her Main Beach home after an argument with her mum on August 18</p>

<p>Queensland Police released chilling CCTV footage (pictured) of Laine-Ella's last confirmed sighting at Main Beach on August 18. She appeared to say goodbye to two girls </p>

<p>The footage showed Laine-Ella, dressed in a grey hoodie, and two other girls walk out from a residence on Cronin Avenue on August 18. </p>

<p>The two taller girls took turns hugging Laine-Ella before she walked down the stairs and out of view. </p>

<p>Regional Crime Coordinator Detective Superintendent Brendan Smith said police were looking to speak with the girls in the footage. </p>

<p>'We want to identify those two girls because they may assist us with who she's with or where she is,' he told reporters on Friday.   </p>

<p>Supt Smith said it was a 'massive concern' that Laine-Ella had not been seen for ten days. </p>

<p>'Most runaways would be seen by somebody so that's really heightened my concern.</p>

<p>'This person could be anywhere so please come forward with the slightest but of information,' he said.  </p>

<p>Supt Smith said Members of the Homicide Squad, PolAir and 'other more covert strategies' were being used to search for the missing girl. </p>

<p>Queensland Police hold 'serious concerns' about Laine-Ella's welfare and said she was last seen at a friend's home in Southport on August 24 (the Gold Coast pictured) </p>

<p>'We just want to find her, we just want her to come home. </p>

<p>'If she's got concerns about her home life and that's why she's refusing to come home we will address that once we find her,' Supt Smith said.   </p>

<p>He explained that police were anxious to see 'proof of life'.</p>

<p>'Ten days is a long time... I'm hoping it's because she doesn't want to be found but I can't rule out foul play.'   </p>

<p>Supt Smith also said Laine-Ella could have been abducted or assisted by another family. </p>

<p>'Abduction is at the top end but we're also looking at people actively assisting her to stay away from home. </p>

<p>'Some of the people we have been dealing with have not been telling us the whole truth,' he told reporters on Thursday.   </p>

<p>It is not known whether Laine-Ella is being held against her will.      </p>

<p>Laine-Ella is described as Caucasian, with a slim build and about 150cm tall, with shoulder-length blonde hair and blue eyes.  </p>

<p>Police urged members of the public to look out for Laine-Ella around Southport and the Gold Coast as well as in south Brisbane. </p>

<p>Anyone who has seen Laine-Ella or has further information has been urged to contact Queensland Police. </p>
