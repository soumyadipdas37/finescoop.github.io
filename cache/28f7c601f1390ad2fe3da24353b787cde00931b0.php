<p>Out and about: He recently admitted that he struggles with maintaining his new slimline physique. Yet Chris Moyles seemed in good spirits after his Radio X show in London on Monday</p>

<p>Chris recently discussed his weight loss and detailed how he struggles to maintain his new physique.</p>

<p>Speaking to Ross Kemp on his podcast The Kempcast, Chris admitted he still suffers from body dysmorphia, despite having shrunk from 18 stone to 12 stone.</p>

<p>He admitted his strict regimen of weighing himself daily and barely eating all day Monday-Friday, before enjoying himself at the weekends. </p>

<p>Transformed: Chris admitted he still suffers from body dysmorphia, despite having shrunk from 18 stone to 12 stone (pictured left in 2006) </p>

<p>He also claimed he still 'feels fat'.</p>

<p>He said: 'Before lockdown, Monday, Wednesday, Friday I would do the show we would have a quick meeting... and then I'd get to the gym and I'd train 11-12 or 11-1, depending on how fat I was feeling. I'm feeling really fat at the moment!</p>

<p>'I'm fascinated by body dysmorphia because I really have an issue with body dysmorphia, which I think most people do. I've lost six stone from my worst weight when I was 18 stone! </p>

<p>'I know my body really well now, and I'm still learning. I don't have the metabolism of an 18-year-old girl or boy, I just don't.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'I will, and people don't believe me, but I weigh myself six days a week, and I know you shouldn't and I know it's not for everyone, but I do that so I can learn about how my body works.</p>

<p>'I will train Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and I will watch what I eat and I'll eat very little. I do intermittent fasting and I'll eat at 6:30PM or 7PM and I'll be fine. I need to do that from the weekends that I have.' </p>

<p>Leggy lady! Weather presenter Sian Welby was also seen leaving the Global Studios and looked radiant in a pair of black shorts teamed with ankle boots </p>
