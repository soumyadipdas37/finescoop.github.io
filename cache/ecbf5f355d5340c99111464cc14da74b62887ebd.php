<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian amateur bakers have invented the 'world's easiest cake recipe' using just two ingredients: pre-made vanilla or golden butter mix and a tin of apple slices in juice.</p>

<p>Forget butter, milk and eggs, this homegrown dessert gets its 'moist' middle from the extra juice inside the apples - and it can be whipped up for less than $4.</p>

<p>'After seeing a lot about the "two Ingredient cake" and reading everyone's hot tips I had to try it,' one woman wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>One woman poured half of the batter into the cake tin, added a thin layer of cold custard to the middle (pictured), before pouring the second half</p>

<p>'It's AMAZING! And so easy. I won't buy cake again if I've got the time to cook this.'</p>

<p>Then mix the apples with either a vanilla or golden butter cake mix until it's a syrupy concoction.</p>

<p>Spray the edges of a cake tin with cooking oil and pour the batter in. One woman poured half, added a thin layer of cold custard to the middle, before pouring the second half. </p>
