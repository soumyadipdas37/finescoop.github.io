<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Brentford boss Thomas Frank admits star forwards Ollie Watkins and Said Benrahma can leave for the right price this summer - but Rico Henry, David Raya and any other players will not be sold.</p>

<p>The Championship club are holding out for £25million for both Watkins and Benrahma amid interest from Aston Villa, Fulham and West Ham.</p>

<p>They are also braced for offers from Arsenal for goalkeeper Raya while left back Henry has admirers at Brighton and West Brom.</p>

<p>Brentford boss Thomas Frank has revealed the club are willing to let go of Said Benrahma </p>

<p>They are also open to an exit for Ollie Watkins this summer, wanting £25m for both stars </p>

<p>Frank led Brentford to the play-off final in 2019-20 and wants to keep most of the squad </p>

<p>'I can stop all that talking and say: we know there a lot of rumours about our players because we had a top season,' Frank said.</p>

<p>'It's no secret that Ollie Watkins and Said Benrahma are players that other clubs are interested in and if the price is right then we're open for potentially selling them. The rest are not for sale.' </p>

<p>Watkins scored 26 goals and Benrahma cemented himself as one of the Championship's finest talents as Brentford came within a whisker of promotion to the Premier League last season, only to lose the play-off final to Fulham. </p>

<p>Frank revealed he won't sell other stars, with Rico Henry set to stay at the Championship side</p>

<p>Benrahma has been targeted by a number of Premier League clubs after a superb season</p>

<p>Frank believes both players 'deserve' to leave this summer and accepts 'speculation will continue to the day they're not here or the window is closed.' </p>

<p>He added: 'Players come and go and we need to create a team that can perform and when some players are leaving, some are growing. they take a step up and show their quality because now they have the opportunity. Of course we're all focusing on what we have.</p>

<p>'It was the same the year before when we had Neal Maupay, we sold him (to Brighton) and everyone thought it was a disaster and we just actually made a potentially even better striker so let's see what's happening.'</p>
