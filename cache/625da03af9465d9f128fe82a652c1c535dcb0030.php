<p>Farewell: Olivia Culpo bid Summer farewell by uploading a stunning bikini-clad portrait to Instagram on Monday</p>

<p>Culpo appeared to be wearing a black string bikini that highlighted her refined curves and enviable tan.</p>

<p>Her brunette tresses were tied back into a bun, while a stylish woven sunhat rested atop her head.</p>

<p>She posed with both of her hands positioned on the brim of her hat as she sat on her legs and turned her head to the side.</p>

<p>The luxe canopy was made out of branches and lined with plenty of comfy pillows. </p>

<p>Wining and dining: Olivia took to Instagram on Sunday to share a few portraits that her sister snapped of her during dinner</p>

<p>Olivia's post on Monday comes just two days after the former girlfriend of Nick Jonas was spotted having a girls day with her younger sister Sophia in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The siblings had a blast sifting through various styles of purses at a storefront for Italian luxury designer Bottega Veneta.</p>

<p>Olivia and Sophia each left the high end store with brand new additions to their handbag collection, before heading to a nearby restaurant for dinner.</p>

<p>Relaxing: 'Really missed the wining and dining,' she wrote, while posing next to a glass of white wine</p>

<p>Chic: Wearing her dark hair down in an attractive bob, Olivia slipped into a white sleeveless shirt and tucked the top into a pair of high-waisted jeans</p>

<p>Although their outing took place on Saturday, Olivia took to Instagram on Sunday to share a few portraits that her sister snapped of her during dinner.</p>

<p>'Really missed the wining and dining,' she wrote, while posing next to a glass of white wine. </p>

<p>Wearing her dark hair down in an attractive bob, Olivia slipped into a white sleeveless shirt and tucked the top into a pair of high-waisted jeans. </p>

<p>She cinched a belt around her trousers to emphasize her enviably trim waistline as she watched the sunset with her sister.  </p>

<p>Living with pain: Although Olivia is often seen with a smile on her face, the brunette beauty revealed last month that she suffers from endometriosis, a painful condition in which the uterine lining grows outside of the uterus; Olivia pictured on September 15</p>

<p>Although Olivia is often seen with a smile on her face, the brunette beauty revealed last month that she suffers from endometriosis, a painful condition in which the uterine lining grows outside of the uterus. </p>

<p>In a recent interview with People, Culpo explained that she is hoping to manage the condition via a 'holistic route as of now,' rather than undergoing an immediate laparoscopy. </p>

<p>'I want to try to see if I can figure some things out for myself, but we'll see. It's a journey. Every month is different because I try different things every month. But I'll definitely keep everybody posted on what works for me, and eventually having to get the surgery because it really depends. Everyone's different,' she said.</p>

<p>Opening up: Olivia had never spoken about her diagnosis publicly until this past August, which she admitted 'was something that [she] was nervous to share'</p>

<p>Holistic route: In a recent interview with People, Culpo explained that she is hoping to manage the condition via a 'holistic route as of now,' rather than undergoing an immediate laparoscopy</p>

<p>Olivia had never spoken about her diagnosis publicly until this past August, which she admitted 'was something that [she] was nervous to share.'  </p>

<p>'Because I really didn't know if people would be familiar with the condition, and it turns out a lot of women are. I was shocked to see how many women have also suffered from endometriosis, and how many questions women have about painful periods.'</p>

<p>She emphasized the seriousness of the condition and that painful periods are 'not normal' and 'could get in the way of your fertility.' </p>

<p>Quarantine partner: Olivia is currently dating and living with NFL star Christian McCaffrey; Olivia and Christian pictured on September 13</p>
