<p>Forest are in discussions over the sale of Matty Cash to Aston Villa for £12m plus bonuses.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Aston Villa have made an improved £12million bid for Nottingham Forest right back Matty Cash.</p>

<p>Nottingham Forest are expected to sign Benfica midfielder David Tavares on a loan deal</p>

<p>Forest want around £15m for the 23-year old who has interest from Fulham, Sheffield United and Southampton. </p>

<p>However, Villa, who had a £10m offer rejected, believe they can reach a compromise as talks continue.</p>

<p>Several Premier League clubs were in for the promising right-back in January but none could reach a deal with the Championship side.</p>

<p>Cash stayed and helped Forest in their bid to seal play-off football, which they agonisingly missed out on on the final day of the season on goal difference.</p>

<p>Cash has scored 16 goals for the club, including three this season, in 141 appearances since breaking into the senior side from the club's academy.  </p>
