<p>Many women say they haven't worn foundation since discovering the product (inset), which coats the face with a natural glow, reduces redness and conceals blemishes</p>

<p>Eco Tan was born in 2010 when Gold Coast founder Sonya Driver set out to make a product that allowed people to tan without exposing themselves to chemicals or harmful ultra-violet rays.</p>

<p>Shunning all manner of chemicals typically used in self-tanners, Ms Driver experimented with samples of cacao, flower essence, chamomile and all things natural, mixing batches in the kitchen of her Currumbin home.</p>

<p>The result is what is now one of Australia's most popular natural skincare brands, one that's won over 50 coveted awards for its clever organic formulations.</p>

<p>Eco Tan made history in 2011 when it became the first and only tanning manufacturer to be certified organic by the Australian government's Organic Food Chain.</p>

<p>Eight years later in 2019, the brand's Eye Compost – a $49 all-natural eye cream - hit headlines after women on social media raved about its ability to lighten dark circles and banish fine lines after just one week of use. </p>

</ul>

<p>The cream promises to leave the eye area 'bright and smooth' with a blend of powerful ingredients like vitamin C, spirulina and Kakadu Plum, a fruit grown in Australia's Northern Territory. </p>

<p>Described as 'supercharged luxe eye cream', the piercing blue formula proved wildly popular with hundreds reporting noticeable improvements after one application.</p>
