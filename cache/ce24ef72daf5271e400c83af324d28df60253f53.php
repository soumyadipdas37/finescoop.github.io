<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Duke and Duchess of Northumbria who live in a castle made famous by the Harry Potter films have hired bouncers to boot out abusive fans after a spate of verbal attacks on staff.</p>

<p>Alnwick Castle in Northumberland has recently reopened partially following lockdown, offering 'broomstick lessons' for wizarding fans - who recognise the structure from a scene in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. </p>

<p>But bosses at the castle - which is home to the Duke of Northumberland Ralph Percy, 62, and his wife Duchess Jane, 60 - are increasing security following a spate of incidents involving visitors verbally abusing staff and guides.</p>

<p>Due to Covid-19 restrictions, visitors must pre-book tickets, but some have complained about long queues and areas of the castle being closed.</p>

<p>One recent visitor wrote on Tripadvisor: 'Do not waste your money.</p>

<p>'To charge £8 to basically look at the walls of the castle is shocking.</p>

<p>'Yes you could go inside to one part if you were prepared to stand in a queue for an hour. You could be in and out in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>'Also hope you're not thirsty unless you're prepared to pay £2 for a can of Coke.'</p>

<p>Other holidaymakers complained they were not allowed to climb the castle walls while others said guides 'did not know what they are doing'.</p>

<p>Managers of the castle say abusive visitors will be booted out by 'our security team'.</p>

<p>A spokesperson said: 'We are sad to report that we are currently experiencing a high volume of verbally abusive behaviour towards our stewarding staff.</p>

<p>'We appreciate that your visit to Alnwick Castle will feel different this year - there are new procedures in place and some areas cannot be accessed.</p>

<p>'We understand visitors may be frustrated, but we cannot excuse abusive behaviour towards staff or other visitors.</p>

<p>'We hope all our visitors understand our current opening measures are in place for their safety, and that of our staff, during the challenging times we still live in.</p>

<p>'Abuse is not acceptable.</p>

<p>'If any visitors engage in this type of behaviour, our security team may ask you to leave the grounds.'</p>

<p>Measures put in place include visits only via booking, access restricted to the inside of the castle and limited numbers allowed in the museum.</p>

<p>Alnwick Castle, a 150-room, heavily crenellated, many-towered magnificence perched on a rocky outcrop above the River Aln in Northumberland, is the second-largest privately inhabited castle after Windsor — and it bears the scars of centuries.</p>

<p>There are musket pockmarks, made by Oliver Cromwell’s army, in the yellow sandstone.</p>

<p>In the main entrance, a maroon board offers Broomstick Training sessions on the very spot where Daniel Radcliffe had his first flying lesson in Harry Potter And The Philosopher’s Stone.</p>

<p>Ralph Percy, the 12th Duke, with the help of his energetic Duchess, Jane, transformed Alnwick into one of Britain’s most visited attractions.</p>

<p>The castle is exquisite — an assault of gilded ceilings, gold leaf, polished floors, gleaming swords and exquisite views over the Capability Brown-designed parkland.</p>

<p>There is an art collection, described as one of the finest outside the Royal Collection, which includes works by Turner, Titian, Canaletto, Van Dyck and William Dobson.</p>

<p>Maintenance of the castle costs more than £1.5 million a year. Ralph and Jane had to make the castle work in the 21st century, as a home, a tourist spot and historical treasure, fighting against convention with a raft of visitor attractions, jousting sessions, gift shops and tearoom, and a few controversial decisions.</p>

<p>Over the years, the castle has featured as a backdrop for Blackadder, Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, Elizabeth, Mary Queen Of Scots, Transformers and the Christmas special of Downton Abbey.</p>

<p>But it was Harry Potter — and, in particular, the broomstick lessons and Quidditch matches — that really changed things.</p>

<p>‘There’s been a huge Harry Potter effect and we’re very grateful for it,’ says Ralph. ‘We do as much Harry Potter stuff as possible and it just doesn’t seem to die out.’</p>

<p>Over the centuries, Alnwick has had so many incarnations, lurching from good fortune to bad and back again with every new monarch. </p>

<p>During the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, the Percys abandoned Alnwick as the north was considered too dangerous. </p>

<p>By the 18th century they were back, and the place was abuzz. There was a staff of more than 200 maids, cooks, valets, butlers, grooms, ten priests and, at one point, even a resident executioner.</p>

<p>Now the staff seems to consist mostly of guides, shop assistants, cafe workers and gardeners. The Percys themselves have a daily as well as a chef.</p>
