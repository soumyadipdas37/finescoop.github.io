<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Riyad Mahrez is targeting more titles as he reaches a notable career milestone against the side with whom he won his first Premier League crown this weekend.</p>

<p>The Manchester City winger is poised to make his 200th Premier League appearance as former club Leicester visit the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Algeria international was named player of the year for his starring role in the Foxes' memorable title triumph of 2016. He went on to claim a second winner's medal with City three years later.</p>

<p>Riyad Mahrez could play in his 200th Premier League game against Leicester City on Sunday</p>

<p>The Algerian winger (above) won the league with the Foxes back in 2016 under Claudio Ranieri</p>

<p>Liverpool relieved City of their title last season and Mahrez is determined to help win it back.</p>

<p>'I think the Premier League is the best league in the world for me,' said the 29-year-old, who had to delay his return to training this season after testing positive for Covid-19.</p>

<p>'Obviously I didn't play in all the leagues, but I love it. Two hundred games is an amazing achievement. I obviously want to play 200 or 300 more.</p>

<p>'My time in the Premier League has been very good. I won trophies, I scored some goals, I enjoyed playing in the Premier League, enjoyed home games and away games' atmospheres, and I hope I will keep going until I retire.</p>

<p>Mahrez won the league for a second time with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in 2019</p>

<p>'We weren't good enough to win it last season, and now we know what we can improve on to try to be there at the end of the year.</p>

<p>'I think we have a very good squad and a very good team. I think it's all about consistency and focus and we'll be there at the end.'</p>

<p>City, who began their campaign with a 3-1 victory at Wolves on Monday, come up against a Leicester side who have won their opening two games.</p>

<p>Mahrez, who left the King Power Stadium for City in a £60million deal in 2018, still has great fondness for his old club.</p>

<p>Manchester City's Mahrez (right) looks back on his time at Leicester City with fond memories </p>

<p>He said: 'I look back at an unbelievable moment. Everything we achieved as a group of players and as a club was amazing. I spent so many good moments there.</p>

<p>'I think it's going to be a tough game. Both teams were good last season and have good players. I don't know how they're going to play but it's going to be a tough game.'</p>

<p>City have a host of absentees. Sergio Aguero, Gabriel Jesus, Bernardo Silva, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Joao Cancelo are all out injured while Ilkay Gundogan is self-isolating with coronavirus. Nicolas Otamendi is also doubtful and Aymeric Laporte is not fully fit following his positive Covid-19 test.</p>

<p>Pep Guardiola (left) has several injuries to deal with ahead of the Leicester game on Sunday</p>

<p>Manager Pep Guardiola is likely to include a number of youth players in his matchday squad for a game made especially challenging by the strength of the opposition.</p>

<p>Guardiola said: 'Leicester, for four or five, six years, have always been there.</p>

<p>'It will be incredibly tough, we know it. Always it's been difficult and this will be no exception.</p>

<p>'But we play at home and, even though we have just 13 players for the first team, I see the team really well in terms of happiness and relations between them.</p>

<p>'The young players help us a lot. We have an exceptional group for Sunday.'</p>
