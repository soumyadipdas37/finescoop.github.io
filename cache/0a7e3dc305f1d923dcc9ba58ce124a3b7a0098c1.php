<p>Out and about: April Love Geary modeled a stylish coral and white cocktail dress while out in Los Angeles this Wednesday</p>

<p>She accessorized her ensemble with a black leather Yves Saint Laurent purse and made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask.</p>

<p>April and her beefcake pop star, who is 17 years her senior, are already the proud parents of two-year-old Mia and one-year-old Lola.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this month Us Weekly reported that the dynamic duo are now awaiting the arrival of their third little pride and joy.</p>

<p>Last month April swung by her social media to brush off the internet trolls who have criticized her for her figure after she had two children. </p>

<p>On the go: The 25-year-old blonde bombshell emerged from lockdown to pick up a couple of bouquets of flowers from a shop</p>

<p>'Just letting you know that I'm not really bothered by all your guys' comments when you say I was "so much more attractive" when I was skinnier,' she said.</p>

<p>'Because before having babies, I didn't have this fat a** and I am forever grateful for this baby weight,' April added cheekily. </p>

<p>Robin also has a 10-year-old son called Julian Thicke whom he shares with his ex-wife, actress Paula Patton. </p>

<p>April, who joked on her 23rd birthday that Robin was 'gonna have to swap me out for a younger chick soon,' has been with Robin since 2014.</p>

<p>Love of her life: Her latest outing comes amid a swirl of rumors that she is pregnant with her third child by her dashing fiance Robin Thicke</p>

<p>Robin married Paula Patton in 2005 after dating her since they were teenagers, and they brought Julian Fuego into the world in 2010.</p>

<p>After they separated in February 2014, Robin waged a public campaign to get Paula back, including an album named Paula with a lead single entitled Get Her Back.</p>

<p>Despite his efforts Paula filed in October 2014 for a divorce that was ultimately finalized the following March.</p>

<p>Paula and Robin waged a rancorous custody battle over Julian - one that they settled weeks before April told the world she was pregnant with Mia.</p>
