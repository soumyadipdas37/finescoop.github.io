<p>Come again? Louise Thompson shared a cryptic tweet referring to cheating on Thursday</p>

<p>Shocker: The former Made In Chelsea star, 30, who is engaged to personal trainer Ryan Libbey, took to Twitter to share a message with her 520,700 followers reading: 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful'</p>

<p>Louise's tweet came just hours after she enjoyed a family dinner with Ryan and her brother Sam Thompson, which she documented on Instagram.</p>

<p>The star did not provide any clarity over who she was referencing in her message. MailOnline has contacted Louise's representative for comment.  </p>

<p>In April, Louise admitted she's 'working on her relationship' with fiancé Ryan and they still haven't made plans for their wedding.</p>

<p>The star, who got engaged to Ryan in 2018, told MailOnline 'I am just not sure exactly what I want yet' after cancelling her big day last December.</p>

<p>Way back when: Having shot to fame on the E4 show in 2011, Louise became part of a central storyline due to her romance with love rat Spencer Matthews, leading to speculation from fans that the tweet was about her ex</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview Louise said being in isolation with Ryan hasn't been easy and they've agreed to 'try harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.'</p>

<p>Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'At the beginning it wasn't that easy but we've had to make a really conscious effort to make some changes.</p>

<p>'We are actively working on our relationship now. For the first couple of years in a relationship you're still in that love phase, there are still new things to experience. </p>

<p>The family! Louise's tweet came just hours after she enjoyed a family dinner with Ryan and her brother Sam Thompson, which she documented on Instagram</p>

<p>We've been together for four and a half years now and you do go through phases. You have to try a bit harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.</p>

<p>'We are communicating more and having chats about what each other wants, so now we have set some boundaries.'</p>

<p>The pair had booked to marry at London's Kew Gardens in December 2019 but cancelled their plans, with Louise saying: 'It's just the bigger picture for myself and Ryan that we need to get to grips with first.'</p>

<p>Work harder: In an exclusive interview Louise said being in isolation with Ryan hasn't been easy and they've agreed to 'try harder and make the effort to appreciate each other'</p>

<p>Months later, Ryan revealed they had agreed on a venue in Ibiza for their wedding to go ahead in spring 2020 – but now Louise says they're still 'figuring out what it is we want' and their plans have come to a halt.</p>

<p>She said: 'No… actually, we haven't, we are still sort of figuring out what it is we want to do because we're so busy with the business.</p>

<p>'I am someone that really wants to have the best day ever and I want to be in the right space, I am just not sure exactly what I want yet.'</p>
