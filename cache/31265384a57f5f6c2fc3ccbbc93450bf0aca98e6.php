<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Yorkshire pub has barred under 25s following a rapid surge in Covid-19 infections among young people since July.</p>

<p>The Oddfellows Arms in Sherburn-in-Elmet said it will refuse to service those in the 18-25 age bracket as they 'cannot take the risk' of serving young people.</p>

<p>In a statement on Facebook, they said that they would rather keep the venue safe than be 'teetering on the risk of closure' and urged people to think of the 'implications' for the business.</p>

<p>This comes after official data showed that rising Covid-19 cases across July and August were being driven by people in their teens and 20s.</p>

<p>The Oddfellows Arms in Sherburn-in-Elmet, Yorkshire, (above) has barred under 25s as they 'cannot take the risk' amid the coronavirus crisis</p>

<p>MailOnline analysis shows infections have surged from 9.2 to 28 cases per 100,000 since July 4, 'Super Saturday', in those aged 20 to 29 in England</p>

<p>The statement read: 'In light of recent events and an escalation in cases we are now not serving anyone in the age bracket 18-25.</p>

<p>'We have thought about this very carefully, we will continue to try and ensure our community, customers and staff are all kept safe in these difficult times.</p>

<p>'Before anyone tries to say we are wrong, think of the implications for us as a business.</p>

<p>'This is not where we want to be. We would rather have a safe environment than a place which is teetering on the risk of closure.</p>

<p>'Please see that we are acting for everyone's best intentions at this time.</p>

<p>'We have some of the most amazing well mannered, well behaved customers in that age bracket, but we simply cannot take the risk.</p>

<p>'As soon as we feel safe to do so we will ensure everyone knows. Thank you for understanding.'</p>

<p>But the Oddfellows Arms have not been the first to ban under 25s as a Sheffield pub barred the age bracket after 'some trouble' last month. </p>

<p>Police temporarily closed The Stag in Woodhouse from August 1 until August 3 after an incident on the Friday before. </p>

<p>Landlady Samantha Oldfield introduced stricter measures after saying under 25s had 'proved that they can't behave' since the pub reopened, Metro reported. </p>

<p>The case rate has quadrupled among those aged 10 to 19 years old over July and August, before schools reopened, from 4.1 cases per 100,000 people to 16.2</p>

<p> Scientists have said over 80s are more likely to take social distancing rules seriously and to continue staying home because they understand the risks of the virus</p>

<p>She added: 'After the weekend, we will only be allowing over 25's in. I will monitor and decide if plastic glasses need to be used after 6pm. </p>

<p>'They (under 25s) have proved that they can't behave and I'm having to put stricter measures in.'</p>

<p>The Oddfellows Arms decision comes after rising Covid-19 cases were reportedly being driven by people in their teens and 20s, where cases have tripled since July, official data shows. </p>

<p>MailOnline analysis shows infections have surged from 9.2 to 28 cases per 100,000 since July 4, or 'Super Saturday', in those aged 20 to 29 in England.</p>

<p>And the case rate has also quadrupled among those aged 10 to 19 years old over July and August, before schools reopened, from 4.1 cases per 100,000 people to 16.2.</p>

<p>But cases in those over 80 have  dropped drastically since the height of the pandemic, when they made up the majority of Covid-19 cases, and have halved since July. </p>

<p>Scientists have said older groups are more likely to take social distancing rules seriously and to continue staying home to protect themselves because they understand the risks of the virus. </p>

<p>Health officials are warning young people to stop going to parties and large gatherings and to respect the social distancing laws.</p>

<p> Health Secretary Matt Hancock appeared on Radio 1 on Monday to tell youngsters 'Don't kill your gran' as deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said people had 'relaxed too much'. </p>

<p>The pub is refusing to serve those between ages 18 and 25 after the Government announced people will no longer be allowed to gather in groups later than six from Monday</p>

<p>Calling the figures 'concerning', Mr Hancock told LBC radio: 'The message to all your younger listeners [on LBC] and everybody is that even though you are at a lower risk of dying from the coronavirus, if you're that age, if you're under 25, you can still have really serious symptoms and consequences.'</p>

<p>He said the most important point to get across was that the uptick in cases in the past few days have been in younger people under 25, 'especially 17 to 21 year olds'.  </p>

<p>In the latest recorded cases, the UK announced 2,659 more coronavirus cases and eight deaths yesterday.</p>

<p>The rise of 2,659 cases means almost 13,000 case have been diagnosed in the past four days alone - the highest numbers since mid-May.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson has said the spike in infections seen over the past week left him no choice but to tighten lockdown across England for the first time since March.</p>

<p>The strict new coronavirus safety rules have seen gatherings larger than six people become illegal from Monday, unless everyone lives in the same household.</p>

<p>The 'rule of six' is a dramatic reduction on the limit of 30 put in place on July 4. </p>

<p>It includes meetings in houses and gardens, parks and beaches, as well as public places including bars and restaurants. </p>

<p>Events such as weddings and funerals in Covid secure venues are excluded from this rule. Schools and workplaces are also exempt from the new restrictions. </p>

<p>Health officials are warning young people to stop going to parties and large gatherings and to respect social distancing laws, as Boris Johnson announced new strict coronavirus measures</p>

<p>Pubs, cafes and restaurants which have been voluntarily collecting the contact details of customers will now have to collect names, addresses, emails and phone numbers by law - and hold them for 21 days. </p>

<p>Police will be encouraged to break up larger groups and issue £100 fines, which will then double on each repeat offence up to £3,200. </p>

<p>Covid Wardens, who are employed by local authorities, will also be sent to towns and cities across the country to enforce new virus laws, the Prime Minister said yesterday.</p>

<p>The marshals will patrol parks, shopping centres, train stations and other areas where groups of people are likely to gather in larger numbers.</p>

<p>They will break up groups of more than six in town centres and alert police if fines need to be handed out.</p>

<p>Recently retired environmental health officers will also be drafted in to enforce legislation at pubs and restaurants.</p>

<p>They will help enforce social-distancing rules and ensure contact details of all customers are collected for the test and trace system. </p>
