<p>The claims were included in a ‘Freshman Safety Knowledge Handbook’ published by China Academy of Arts, the first arts university in Chinese history.</p>

<p>The safety guide angered hundreds of thousands of angered users who slammed the reputable Chinese college for suggesting women were responsible for sexual assault.</p>

<p>The incident has sparked a heated discussion online after pictures of the handbook have been widely shared on Chinese Twitter-like Weibo since Thursday.</p>

<p>A paragraph from the safety guide, titled ‘Causes of Sexual Assault’, said the primal reason is ‘the girl’s personal influences’.</p>

<p>‘[She] cares about maintaining physical appearances and blindly pursues materialistic pleasures,’ the handbook read.</p>

<p>‘[She] has beautiful looks and a flirtatious manner; has a timid nature and is unable to defend herself.’</p>

<p>The university also branded sexual assault victims as ‘introverted and weak-willed’ women who have ‘a poor sense of self-protection’.</p>

<p>The controversial claims were included in a ‘Freshman Safety Knowledge Handbook’ published by China Academy of Arts, the first arts university in Chinese history</p>

<p>Outraged social media users called for a formal apology from the fine arts college which told Chinese media that they were investigating the matter.</p>

<p>One commenter wrote: ‘Stop all the excuses, you need to come out and apologise.’</p>

<p>Another said: ‘Was this handbook written by rapists? Are you blaming the victims for sexual assault?’</p>

<p>The university has yet released any formal statements following the incident.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, another Chinese university's guidelines warning women students not to wear 'revealing' clothes on campus 'to prevent arousing temptation' whipped up online fury in the socially conservative country.</p>

<p>'Do not wear clothing and skirts that are overly revealing, low-cut, exposing your waist, or showing your back, so as to prevent arousing temptation,' the advisory note for new female students read.</p>

<p>China has taken some steps towards key demands from its nascent #MeToo movement, with its first-ever civil code - passed in May - expanding the definition of sexual harassment. A group of graduate students is pictured in the file photo attending an opening ceremony at Huazhong University of Science and Technology at the university's stadium on September 4</p>

<p>The recommendations were included in a 50-point safety guide issued by Guangxi University, which also urged women to avoid going out alone.</p>

<p>China has taken some steps towards key demands from its nascent #MeToo movement, with its first-ever civil code - passed in May - expanding the definition of sexual harassment.</p>

<p>But it remains difficult to get justice for many sexual assault crimes due to conservative attitudes and many women reluctant to come forward.</p>
