<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Panicked investors are offloading Sydney homes at heavily discounted prices in a desperate bid to fast track sales as coronavirus bites the market.</p>

<p>Some investors with CBD and inner city apartments are slashing up to $250,000 from the original price listed before the pandemic hit Australia's shores earlier this year.  </p>

<p>While prices for all housing categories across Sydney has dropped in recent months, the inner city unit market was one of the hardest hit.</p>

<p>Advertised unit prices in Sydney's CBD are down 15 per cent compared to a year ago, according to SQM Research's Asking Prices Index.</p>

<p>This three bedroom unit in the Sydney CBD has had $250,000 slashed from original price</p>

<p>Listed in March, the same Kent Street apartment remains on the market</p>

<p>'The inner city unit market is Sydney's weakest and will probably remain so until international travel restrictions are lifted,' My Housing Market economist Andrew Wilson told the Realestate.com.au.</p>

<p>Among the biggest savings is a three bedroom, two bathroom unit at 361-363 Kent Street originally listed at $1.55million.</p>

<p>It remains on the market at $1.3million, the price it last sold for in 2017.</p>

<p>A few blocks away in the same street, a one bedroom unit has been slashed by $50,000 to the discounted price of $730,000.</p>

<p>A one bedroom in nearby Clarence Street was listed for $1.05m but remains on the market six months later at the reduced price $960,000. </p>

<p>There are also plenty of bargains in the nearby inner-city suburb of Ultimo.</p>

<p>This one bedroom unit in Wattle Street Ultimo had a $826,000-$855,000 price range</p>

<p>Six months later, the Wattle Street unit remains on the market and slashed up to by $95,000</p>

<p>A one bedroom unit in Wattle Street is currently listed at $735,000-$760,000, almost $100,000 below the original $826,000-$855,000 price range.</p>

<p>A two bedroom unit in the same suburb was originally listed $1.2m but has since been slashed by $200,000 to $1.03m.</p>

<p>If the plummeting prices in the inner city are still out of reach, there are still bargains across Sydney.</p>

<p>One couple recently snapped up a home for $300,000 less than the pre-COVID listing price in Warriewood on Sydney's northern beaches.</p>

<p>'We first thought we had no chance, we were so used to being outbid, but the owner needed to sell in a hurry … our offer was accepted over another couple because we already had pre-approval for the loan. They didn’t,' the buyer said.  </p>

<p>Mortgage Choice director and broker James Algar said buyers can snap up a bargain if they act quickly and already have loan pre-approval.</p>

<p>Now is the time to snap up a bargain in the Sydney CBD and surrounding inner city suburbs</p>
