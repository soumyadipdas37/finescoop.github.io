<p>The reality show followed the lives of Kim and her family, including sisters Kendall, Khloe, Kylie and their mother Kris.</p>

<p>Lisa explained: 'It was the first time I'd interviewed her, and I will be forever grateful that just before we came back from the break Kim pointed out that I might want to do my fly up'</p>

<p>During the lengthy post, she said that it was 'time to say goodbye', however she did not cite an official reason for the once hugely-popular reality show to be finishing at the end of its contract next year. </p>

<p>KUWTK was an instant hit in America and only rose in popularity as viewers tuned in to keep up with the family drama, with 4.8 million tuning into the season four finale at its peak.</p>

<p>However it is no secret that viewership has dropped in recent years and less than 900,000 live viewers on average tuned into the 18th and most recent series of the programme.</p>
