<p>An article on September 5, 2010, "...fury as police cash in on car phone picture" said Andrew Perry, a CPS lawyer, might have been in contempt of court by giving a presentation using an evidence picture of footballer Jermain Defoe using a mobile phone while driving, before the case had been heard.</p>

<p>In fact the picture related to a speeding case, prosecuted by Mr Perry, that had already concluded; a mobile phone case mentioned in the article had not yet begun. We are happy to set the record straight.</p>
