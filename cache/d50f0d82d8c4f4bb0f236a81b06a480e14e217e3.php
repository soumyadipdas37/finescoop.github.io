<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>San Francisco's mayor labeled President Trump a 'terrorist' and declared it's 'time for us to move on' from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial salon visit.</p>

<p>Mayor London Breed made the remarks on Friday while handing out free masks with The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in Dolores Park, which sits just two miles away from the salon Pelosi visited earlier this week.  </p>

<p>eSalon SF, found in the affluent Cow Hollow neighborhood, became the subject of headlines after the House Speaker was seen flouting pandemic health guidelines inside the business.</p>

<p>Pelosi argued that she was 'set up' by the owner, but the salon has since denied those claims and called them 'absolutely false.'</p>

<p>This week, Fox News released footage of Nancy Pelosi (pictured) inside eSalon SF when the business was closed over pandemic restrictions and without a mask </p>

<p>'We have a terrorist, we have a dictator who is running this country and Nancy Pelosi is at the forefront fighting against this person everyday, you know, and I'm not trying to excuse what happened,' said Breed.</p>

<p>She pointed to other serious issues, like homelessness, that deserved more attention than the salon visit.  </p>

<p>'I'm just saying that to allow an issue like this to turn our city upside down when we got folks who are homeless, we've got people who can't open their business, including these salons. I understand.' </p>

<p>Footage obtained by Fox News showed Pelosi inside the San Francisco salon on Monday without a face mask and inside the business when only outside service was permitted. </p>

<p>Beauty parlors in San Francisco weren't allowed to open until September 1, prompting Pelosi's premature visit to upset local business owners and some residents.</p>

<p>Some critics took to the streets on Thursday in response and gathered outside outside of Pelosi's local home with curlers and blow dryers. </p>

<p>Hair salons were among several industries that were shuttered during the COVID-19 pandemic that saw California become the first state to implement lockodwn orders and later an infection hot spot. </p>

<p>The Golden State has recorded more than 733,000 confirmed infections and 13,600 deaths.  </p>

<p>'Let me just be clear, I can be responsible for my behavior, I can't tell other people what to do,' Breed added.</p>

<p>By Friday, the hair salon tools that had been strung in trees outside of Pelosi's home had been removed.</p>

<p>Breed added that she sympathized with salon owners and customers who were unsettled by the footage, but maintained it was time to press on.</p>

<p>'I get that they have these feelings, they are voicing their feelings, but we are doing the very best we can and I know that's not good enough for them, I understand,' she said.</p>

<p>'I get it, but at the end of the the day, it is really time for us to move on.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump continued his attacks against Pelosi on Twitter, where he questioned how'd she fare in global negotiations given claims the incident was a 'set up.'</p>

<p>Mayor Breed (center): ''I get that they have these feelings, they are voicing their feelings, but we are doing the very best we can and I know that's not good enough for them, I understand'</p>

<p>President Trump continued his attacks against Pelosi with a Twitter post on Saturday </p>

<p>'Nancy Pelosi said she got “set up” by the owner (a very good one) of a beauty parlor,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'If so, how will she do in negotiations against President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, or Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Not so well, I suspect, but far better than Joe Hiden’ would do!'    </p>

<p>Trump is just one of several Republicans who have leveraged Pelosi's controversy as a criticism against Democrats ahead of the November election. </p>

<p>Many deemed Pelosi a hypocrite for flouting face mask guidelines after criticizing Trump for not wearing one.  </p>

<p>When he was pictured in one in July she said: 'He's crossed a bridge. So hopefully by his example, he will change his attitude, which will be helpful in stopping the spread of the coronavirus.'</p>

<p>In July Pelosi announced that all members will be required to wear a mask when voting on the House floor. She said failure to wear would be 'serious breach of decorum' for which members could be removed from the chamber.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>'It's a sign of respect for the health, safety and well-being of others present in the chamber and in surrounding areas,', she added.</p>

<p>Trump previously tweeted: 'Speaker Pelosi has pushed policies that would keep our economy closed and our small businesses shut down. But for herself?'</p>

<p>'She probably treats him like she treats everyone else...And she strongly supported a Kennedy who just lost in, of all places, Massachusetts.'</p>

<p>In a follow-up tweet, Trump boasted 'we will almost certainly take back the House.' </p>

<p>After her visit made national news, Pelosi said she had been to the salon several times over the years and was 'set up.'</p>

<p>'I take responsibility for trusting the word of a neighborhood salon I've been to over the years many times, and when they said we're able to accommodate people, one person at a time, and that we can set up that time, I trusted that. As it turns out, it was a setup,' she said.</p>

<p>'It was a set up, and I take responsibility for falling for a setup,' she added.</p>

<p>Erica Kious, the owner of eSalon SF, denied that Pelosi duped and told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that's she's received death threats.</p>

<p>Pelosi (pictured) said in a statement that she had been 'set up' by the salon and asked for an apology</p>

<p>The salon owner, Erica Kious, said: 'It was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can't work'</p>

<p>'[Pelosi] had called the stylist, or her assistant did, and had made the appointment so the appointment was already booked so there was no way I could have set that up,' said Kious.</p>

<p>'And I've had a camera system in there for five years, I mean I didn't go in there and turn cameras on as soon as she walked in and set her up so that's absolutely false.' </p>

<p>Speaking Wednesday Kious added: 'For the past six months, we are pretty much done. We have lost at least 60 per cent of our clients, I've lost the majority of my staff. So six months is a long time to be closed down.</p>

<p>'Just to see her come in, especially her not wearing a mask, that's what really got to me. This isn't political, it's the fact she came in and didn't have a mask on.</p>

<p>'If she is in there comfortably then why are we shut down?'</p>

<p>Kious, who rents out chairs to different stylists, said since the release of the footage Tuesday evening she has received threats to burn down her salon.  </p>

<p>A GoFundMe set up for Kious -set up by former Nevada State GOP chairman Amy Tarkanian - has raised more than $272,000 of it's $300,000 goal.</p>

<p>The donations will go towards paying off debts from the business as it shuts down and relocation costs. </p>

<p>A GoFundMe for Erica Kious was started this week and raised more than $270,000 so far </p>
