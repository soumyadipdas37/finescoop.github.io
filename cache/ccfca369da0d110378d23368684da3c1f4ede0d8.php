<p>Devastating: Phillip Schofield revealed a close family member suffered life-changing brain injuries after a bike accident</p>

<p>'I'm a very keen bike rider. I would not think about going on my bike without a helmet.</p>

<p>'We have an extended member of our family who had an accident on a bike and sustained life changing brain injuries. So it is inconceivable for me to get on a bike,' he said. </p>

<p>'And also the money it costs the National Health Service a year, for people who have been riding bikes without a helmet on and have brain injuries, because they did not have a helmet.'</p>

<p>Dangerous: On Thursday's This Morning the presenter, 58, discussed with Alice Beer and Headway charity deputy exec Luke Griggs about the dangers around E-scooters</p>

<p>Safety first: Phil revealed his personal heartache and said he would 'not think about going on my bike without a helmet', after seeing the aftermath crashes can cause first hand</p>

<p>Important: 'We have an extended member of our family who had an accident on a bike and sustained life changing brain injuries. So it is inconceivable for me to get on a bike,' he said</p>

<p>Viewers took to Twitter to share their views, one wrote: 'e-scooters &amp; cyclists should be made pay road tax and insurance if they want to use the road. Why should car drivers pay for cycle lanes and how would damage be paid for if an e-scooter/cyclist hits a car and it is not the car drivers fault'. </p>

<p>Another typed: 'Emily Hartridge was killed not long ago whilst riding an E-Scooter. They’re very dangerous.'</p>

<p>A third viewer chimed: 'E-Scooter's aren’t eco friendly as they need charging riders also almost invisible in the dark as the back light isn’t visible from more than 10 yards.'</p>

<p>Last month, Simon Cowell broke his back while doing an accidental wheelie on his electric bike at his Los Angeles home. </p>

<p>Simon reportedly came within 'one-centimetre of being paralysed' when he fell from his electric bicycle and broke his back in multiple places.</p>

<p>The entertainment mogul was rushed to hospital at the beginning of August when he fell from his new vehicle whilst taking it for a test drive at his house in Malibu. </p>

<p>He was at home with his partner Lauren Silverman, 43, their son, Eric, six, and his stepson Adam, 14, at the time of the incident.                              </p>

<p>Speaking just days after the accident, a family friend told MailOnline that the father-of-one was 'doing well', but was in 'shock and massive amounts of pain'. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, earlier this month Rihanna was spotted sporting a black eye and a bruised face after falling on an electric scooter.</p>

<p>Her rep told TMZ 'the scooter flipped over, smacking her in the face and forehead'. </p>

<p>Back in July, E-scooters were allowed on Britain's roads for the first time. </p>

<p>The trials are being held for 12 months to assess whether the devices reduce traffic and what impact they have on the safety of users and those around them.</p>

<p>Bruised face: Meanwhile, earlier this month Rihanna was spotted sporting a black eye and a bruised face after falling on an electric scooter</p>

<p>Some fear the safety of the vehicles, which have already been involved in fatal accidents including YouTube star Emily Hartridge who was en route to a fertility clinic scan last July when she was killed in a crash in Battersea, south west London. </p>

<p>The scooters have already caused controversy across the Atlantic. </p>

<p>The Associated Press estimates there have been at least 11 electric scooter rider deaths in the US from the beginning of 2018 to last June- nine of those were on rented scooters. </p>

<p>According to the Department of Transport, e-scooters are classed as 'powered transporters' and meet the legal definition of a 'motor vehicle'. </p>

<p>They must therefore meet a number of requirements in order to be used on the road, including having insurance and conforming to 'technical standards.'</p>

<p>As they do not, they are considered illegal to use on roads in Britain. </p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police has also said it is illegal to use e-scooters on the road and riders risk being fined or even having penalty points on their licence. </p>

<p>Riders also risk having their e-scooters seized by police.</p>

<p>In May 2019, the Metropolitan Police ran an operation in London seizing e-scooters which were being illegally used on the city's streets </p>

<p>The Met has warned e-scooter users from riding their machines on the road</p>

<p>The Department of Transport said e-scooters are covered by the 1988 Road Traffic Act, which also includes Segways, hoverboards, go-peds (combustion engine-powered kick scooters), powered unicycles, and u-wheels'. </p>

<p>The ban does not apply to electrically-assisted pedal bicycles.  </p>

<p>According to the Department of Transport: 'For motor vehicles to use public roads lawfully, they must meet a number of different requirements. These include insurance; conformity with technical standards and standards of use; payment of vehicle tax, licensing, and registration; driver testing and licensing; and the use of relevant safety equipment.</p>

<p>'If the user of a powered transporter could meet these requirements, it might in principle be lawful for them to use public roads. However, it is likely that they will find it very difficult to comply with all of these requirements, meaning that it would be a criminal offence to use them on the road.' </p>

<p>E-scooters are also banned from using pavements under the 1835 Highway Act. </p>

<p>E-scooters can be used on private land with the landowner's permission. </p>
