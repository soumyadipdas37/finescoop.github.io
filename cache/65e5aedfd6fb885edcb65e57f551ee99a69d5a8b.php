<p>Conway Police were called to perform a wellness check at Lasker's church back on September 18. </p>

<p>Detective Brittani Little arrived on the scene to find Lasker, a dangerously thin toddler covered in 'multiple bruises from head to toe', and the child's mother in the church, an arrest warrant filed in Faulkner County Circuit Court states. </p>

<p>The mother allegedly told cops the 21 month old was 'possessed by a demon'.</p>

<p>The infant was rushed to a local hospital 'with a brain bleed and extreme malnourishment' and remains in ICU, authorities said.</p>

<p>Officers then returned to the House of Refuge and Deliverance on September 22 as part of their investigation in the child abuse case but Lasker was not at the church. </p>

<p>They tracked him down to an Exxon gas station in the town, according to a second affidavit.</p>

<p>Police said they found the suspect in the passenger seat of his white Dodge truck while another man, Timothy Bynum, was standing near the driver's side of the vehicle. </p>

<p>A search of the truck uncovered four grams of meth in a small baggie inside the door panel, a pipe, a second smoking device and more meth on the floor of the passenger side of the vehicle, the affidavit says.</p>

<p>Lasker told officers in an interview he didn't know there were drugs inside the truck but admitted to having used meth in the past. </p>

<p>He then confessed to doing drugs with his parishioners 'several times' including with the mother of the toddler, the warrant says. </p>

<p>Police later executed a search on the church where they reportedly found a baggy of a substance suspected to be meth. </p>

<p>When asked about the allegations of child abuse, the pastor admitted he tried 'to exorcise the demon in [the child] but he would not explain how he did this,' the warrant says. </p>

<p>Conway Police were called to perform a wellness check at Lasker's church back on September 18 when they discovered the 'bruised and 'emaciated' child </p>

<p>The pastor also confessed to having a shotgun at his home. </p>

<p>A search of his home uncovered a shotgun, shotgun rounds and ammunition, the warrant states. </p>

<p>Lasker was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of a gun by a convicted felon. </p>

<p>Bynum, who said the meth belonged to Lasker, was also arrested on charges relating to the meth found in the door and the pipe. </p>

<p>Lasker made his first court appearance on September 23 where he was given a $7,500 bond.</p>

<p>He is next scheduled to appear in court on October 13.     </p>
