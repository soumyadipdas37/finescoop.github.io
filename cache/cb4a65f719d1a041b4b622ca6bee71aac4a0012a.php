<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Princess Beatrice's husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and his ex-fiancee Dara Huang proved they're on excellent terms this week as the architect visited the site of his company's latest luxurious development, branding it 'gorgeous'. </p>

<p>London-born Edo, 37, runs the property development and interior design firm Banda, which he started age 23.</p>

<p>Its aim is to design homes for affluent clients in 'undervalued' parts of London, getting them value for money. </p>

<p>American-Chinese architect Dara, 38, who shares four-year-old son Wolfie with property developer Edo, shared a snap of her outside a Banda property in Notting Hill to Instagram on Tuesday. </p>

<p>American-Chinese architect Dara Huang, 38, who shares four-year-old son Wolfie with her property developer ex-fiance Edo, 37, shared a snap of her outside a glamorous Banda property in Notting Hill on Instagram on Tuesday</p>

<p>Edo, pictured with Princess Beatrice on their wedding day, dated Dara Huang for three years before they split months before he began a romantic relationship with Beatrice</p>

<p>Having pitched up on an electric scooter, Dara captioned the image: 'My new mode of transport and work wear. Visiting a gorgeous site designed by <?php echo e('@'); ?>banda.property (off of #westbournegrove) such a cool street and design.'</p>

<p>It is believed Dara was visiting the Banda project 13-19 Leinster Square, which comprises of five luxurious maisonettes, eight expansive lateral apartments and two stunning penthouses. </p>

<p>The company's Instagram page recently shared a series of images of the glamorous refurbishment, which is on the cusp of Westbourne and Notting Hill. </p>

<p>In January, a friend of Dara and Edo insisted the estranged couple remain close, with Dara even cutting Edo's hair and occasionally buying him clothes.  </p>

<p>Their amicable relationship meant Dara was on the original guest list for Edo's wedding to Beatrice, 32, before the coronavirus pandemic forced the couple to cancel their May nuptials.</p>

<p>Beatrice and Edoardo later secretly tied the knot on July 17 in Windsor, with the Queen and Prince Philip in attendance and Wolfie acting as best man. </p>

<p>Dara and Edo dated for three years before splitting in 2018. Edo and Beatrice, who were long-time family friends, started dating in October 2018 and got engaged during a romantic trip to Italy's Amalfi Coast in September last year, after an 11-month whirlwind romance. </p>

<p>When news of Edo and Beatrice’s romance became public in December 2018, Dara’s father Po-Tien accused the Royal Family of helping to rob his daughter of the chance to walk down the aisle with Edo.</p>

<p>‘Why would they want to go and break this up?’ the retired Nasa scientist said. ‘I can’t understand it. It’s not fair, but the Royal Family are very powerful.’</p>

<p>However, her father’s apparent frustration did not result in Dara cutting ties with her ex-partner.</p>

<p>Dara has recently found love again with 37-year-old London-based financier Filippos Kodellas de la Morena, the son of 'a Greek diplomat and a well-connected Spanish mother', according to the Daily Mail diarist Richard Eden. Filippos is also reportedly director of La Perla.</p>

<p>Earlier this week Bea was on stepmum duties as she popped into a London branch of Waitrose to pick up some groceries with Wolfie while Edo waited in their Range Rover outside.</p>

<p>The princess, the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, made sure Wolfie was safely in the back seat before climbing in the passenger seat next to her husband. It was the first time they had been seen out together since their secret wedding.</p>

<p>Beatrice dressed down for the Waitrose outing over the weekend, pairing a casual blue button-down shirt with a white skirt with blue detailing.</p>

<p>She wore her hair loose around her shoulders, adding a ruby red velvet hairband for her own styling twist. </p>

<p>It is the third time Beatrice has been seen running errands in London in recent days.</p>

<p>Last week she was seen picking up a bag of organic groceries and stopping off at baby shop The Little White Company to pick up a gift.</p>

<p>The outings suggest she and Edo are settling into married life in London. Wolfie also plays an important part in their lives together in the city, with friends previously speaking of the good relationship Beatrice has with her new stepson.</p>

<p>Beatrice and Edoardo headed off to France for a low-key honeymoon shortly after their private wedding on July 17. The couple exchanged vows in front of immediate family, including the Queen and Prince Philip, at All Saints Church, Windsor. </p>

<p>A source told the Mail on Sunday that Beatrice and Edo had planned to skip a traditional honeymoon, but decided at the last minute to take a trip across the Channel.</p>

<p>‘The wedding was arranged in a couple of weeks, and with lockdown their choice of honeymoon destinations was severely curtailed.</p>

<p>‘They weren’t going to bother but at the last minute they decided to pack up the car and head out. They’re a very down-to-earth couple.’</p>

<p>It is understood that they are planning a trip to Lamu Island, off Kenya, where Edo’s family own a home and where he took Beatrice in the early days of their romance.</p>
