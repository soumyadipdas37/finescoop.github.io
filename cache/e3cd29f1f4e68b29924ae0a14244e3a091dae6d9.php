<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A student claims she was attacked in the French city of Strasbourg by three men who were offended by her wearing a skirt. </p>

<p>The woman, who identified herself only as Elisabeth, 22, said she was taking a walk through the city while she smoked a cigarette on Friday last week when the men began shouting at her.</p>

<p>She claims that one yelled 'look at that whore in a skirt', which caused her to apologise on instinct, before the group told her to 'shut up and lower your eyes'. </p>

<p>Two men then grabbed her by each arm while the third hit her in the face, leaving her with a black eye that was visible when she spoke to France Blue TV on Monday.</p>

<p>After the attack the men, who Elisabeth estimated to be in their 20s, fled without saying anything else, she claims.</p>

<p>Elisabeth said she has complained to police, who confirmed they are investigating, but have yet to identify any suspects.</p>

<p>She claims that around 15 people witnessed the attack, but that none of them tried to intervene, called police or tried to stop the attackers fleeing.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters, she called out what she described as a worsening atmosphere for young women in the French city, which is where she grew up.</p>

<p>Elisabeth said she had gone for a walk and a cigarette in Strasbourg when three men called her a 'whore' and then hit her in the face for wearing a skirt (file image)</p>

<p>'It's really violent, dirty, perverse,' she said, 'It's always remarks in the back. A man will shout 'very nice!' and will leave immediately. </p>

<p>'It's always very cowardly. That's what I have noticed this summer. It's the summer of cowards.'</p>

<p>Police are now calling for witnesses to come forward and speak to them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, France Blue Alsace reported that two women aged in their 20s were attacked on Wednesday this week by a man who was also offended by their skirts.</p>

<p>Police say the 18-year-old man accused them of having their skirts 'too short' as they waited for a tram in the city centre around 4.30pm.</p>

<p>Officers say the man then slapped one woman across the face, before grabbing the second by the throat when she tried to intervene. </p>

<p>He was arrested around 20 minutes later, and has been charged with assault. </p>
