<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The personal coaches of Olympian Claudia Fragapane have been suspended by British Gymnastics pending an investigation.</p>

<p>Helen Potter and Rory Weavers, who coach at Bristol Hawks Gymnastics Club, have received complaints about their conduct which meet ‘a certain threshold’ to trigger a temporary suspension.</p>

<p>Fragapane, who won four gold medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games aged 16 and appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016, has worked with Potter and Weavers throughout her career.</p>

<p>The personal coaches of British Olympian Claudia Fragapane have been suspended </p>

<p>Complaints to Helen Potter and Rory Weavers have triggered the move before an investigation</p>

<p>However, it is understood the complaints made against the two Bristol coaches are not linked to the 22-year-old.</p>

<p>Fragapane praised her coaches earlier this summer in the wake of the widespread allegations of abuse in British Gymnastics.</p>

<p>In a statement on social media, she wrote: ‘I’ve been lucky to have amazing personal coaches who make me feel brave and have a laugh in the gym — they are like my family.</p>

<p>‘My coaches are always by my side and support me in everything I do.’</p>

<p>Potter and Weavers have previously been part of the Great Britain coaching team at World Championships and have worked with Team England at the Commonwealth Games. </p>

<p>The suspension comes after women's team coach Amanda Reddin was also stood down </p>

<p>Their suspension comes a week after Amanda Reddin, the head coach of Britain’s women’s team which includes Fragapane, was temporarily stood down while claims into her conduct were investigated.</p>

<p>Following that news, Fragapane tweeted: ‘What upsets me and makes me angry is that the social media/TV portray people in a negative way before they have a chance to have their say.’ </p>

<p>The Rio 2016 athlete then received a backlash from other gymnasts, who thought she was trying to protect Reddin. Fragapane said this week she was taking a break from social media.</p>

<p>Fragapane has backed both Reddin and her personal coaches on social media over the matter</p>

<p>Confirming the suspension of Potter and Weavers, a British Gymnastics spokesperson said: ‘Where a complaint meets a certain threshold, we will implement a temporary suspension.</p>

<p>‘Suspension is a neutral, non-blame process, to protect both members to whom the suspended person may pose a risk and the suspended person who has had allegations made against them.</p>

<p>‘This step does not prejudge the outcome of the complaints process but is a precautionary part of appropriate safeguarding practice.’</p>

<p>Potter and Weavers, as well as Bristol Hawks, have been approached for comment. Bristol Hawks said it has ‘full confidence in all its coaching staff’.</p>

<p>Fragapane competed at Rio 2016 as well as winning gold at the Commonwealth Games</p>

<p>A statement from the lawyers for Potter and Weaver said: ‘Following complaints made to British Gymnastics, and our respective suspensions, it is inappropriate for either of us to comment and/or go into any detail in respect of any investigation, other than to confirm that we are both fully co-operating.</p>

<p>‘British Gymnastics has confirmed that the suspension is a neutral, non-blame process to enable an investigation to take place. The steps taken by British Gymnastics do not prejudge the outcome of the complaints process but is a precautionary response and in keeping with appropriate safeguarding practice.</p>

<p>‘We of course do have every sympathy for gymnasts who may have suffered mental and/or physical abuse during their career as gymnasts, and consider that it is vitally important that when complaints are made they are fully and thoroughly investigated.</p>

<p>‘However, throughout our careers, we remain confident that we have followed British Gymnastics’ best practice, and the applicable guidelines and policies on safety. The welfare and wellbeing of all of our gymnasts, past and present, has been paramount at all times, whilst helping them to achieve their personal gymnastics goals.’</p>
