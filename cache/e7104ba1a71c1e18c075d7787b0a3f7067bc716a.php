<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victoria may have lost the AFL Grand Final but its public holiday will remain, re-branded as a day to honour the state's battle against coronavirus.</p>

<p>The state government confirmed the October 23 holiday as it was announced The Gabba, in Brisbane, will host the grand final the following day.</p>

<p>It will be the first time in AFL history that the Grand Final is held outside Victoria.</p>

<p>Grand Final eve has been a holiday in Victoria since 2015 but has divided opinions, with business saying it is a hit to the local economy.</p>

<p>'(It) means that the government can lock in ... a "Thank You Day" for Victorians who have made so many sacrifices as part of the community effort to contain the spread of coronavirus,' the government said in a statement.</p>

<p>Former Premier Jeff Kennett also called on Daniel Andrews to ensure the MCG is opened up on grand final day, with the game shown on the ground's big screens for fans.</p>

<p>'Invite members of competing teams to attend with social distancing. Allow drinks and food to be sold. Allow many Victorians to have a fun night,' Mr Kennett tweeted.</p>

<p>'Premier Andrews, ensure it can happen.'</p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk rejected a question about whether she was proposing to 'pack the Gabba' while there was a 'significant spread' of the virus in southeast Queensland.</p>

<p>'But there isn't (a significant spread), there isn't. It's contained,' she said.</p>

<p>'No there is not, that's not correct. That's not correct - I reject the premise of your question.'</p>

<p>The Queensland government will review the border closure at the end of this month.</p>

<p>The state's deputy police commissioner Steve Gollschewski said that since March, nearly 660,000 vehicles had been checked at the state borders and 290,000 incoming plane passengers had been screened.</p>

<p>The Grand Final couldn't be held in Victoria as Melbourne is in Stage 4 lockdown</p>

<p>Just two new cases of COVID_19 were recorded in Queensland in the 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday with the number of active cases in an existing cluster remaining at 28.</p>

<p>The current outbreak in the state's southeast is centred on the Corrective Services Academy at Wacol, southwest of Brisbane.</p>

<p>The premier said 18,000 tests had been conducted in 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday, more than double the 7480 in the previous 24 hours.</p>

<p>She also said stage four lockdowns will maintained in state prisons after a riot at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre, southwest of Brisbane, on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>'These measures are no different to the quarantine measures that have had to be put in place to keep everyone safe,' Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>
