<p>And only 750 people will be allowed in daily from Albania as of August 16, Peloni said.</p>

<p>On Sunday Greece reported its highest daily tally of coronavirus infections, 203 cases, since the start of the outbreak.</p>

<p>The brought the total number of infections in the country to 5,623 since its first infection surfaced in late February. Greece has recorded a total of 212 deaths since the pandemic began. </p>

<p>The government also moved to suspend public gatherings, including shows and concerts, where audiences are not seated.</p>

<p>The announcement comes as it emerged British holidaymakers are gambling on Greece instead of Spain despite an increase in coronavirus cases in the country - as fears grow of a second spike in France.</p>

<p>Brits desperate for a foreign break have set their sights on destinations in Greece, such as Crete, Corfu and Santorini, as reported by The Sunday Telegraph. </p>

<p>Previously the most sought after destinations on Skyscanner, a flight booking website, were Ibiza, Barcelona and Malaga, but they have now dropped out of the top 10, after the UK government changed travel advice required people who return from Spain to England to quarantine for two weeks.</p>

<p>It comes as Spanish police have broken up a 'coronavirus party' where guests were allegedly trying to spread the disease on purpose - as the country suffers a sharp rebound in cases with infections rising across Europe. </p>

<p>More than 60 people were found camping on an out-of-bounds Tenerife beach in what police called a 'get-together on the beach to spread Covid-19', apparently in the hope of developing immunity. </p>

<p>Civil Guard officers swooped to shut down the gathering with youngsters forced to dismantle their tents, but officials say the party was a 'very serious threat' after Spain suffered more than 25,000 new cases in the last week. </p>

<p>Spain has already been hit with new travel restrictions in a blow to its tourism-reliant economy, while there are fears that France, Germany or Holland could be put back on the UK's quarantine list after spikes in cases there.    </p>

<p>Summer holidays have been blamed for rising cases in Germany and Italy, while France has tightened its face mask rules in tourist hotspots such as Paris and the Mediterranean resort of Saint Tropez. </p>

<p>However, Europe has yet to see a major spike in deaths or hospital cases, amid signs that many of those testing positive are young and less vulnerable to the disease.  </p>
