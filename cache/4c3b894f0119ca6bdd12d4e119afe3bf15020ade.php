<p>EXCLUSIVE: Anna Vakili has candidly revealed she is yet to lose the weight she gained in lockdown (pictured R in May after losing 1.2 stone)</p>

<p>A few months ago, the pharmacist revealed she tipped the scales at nearly 13 stone (81kg) at her heaviest in January.    </p>

<p>The TV star discussed her health journey while stressing the importance of 'enjoying our lives and feeling good'. </p>

<p>Anna said: 'At the beginning of lockdown, I lost loads of weight and was looking really great, but I ended up putting it all back on, even more. It was so up and down, I'm an emotional eater. </p>

<p>'I haven't lost it again as I've been so busy with the campaign. I tried to work out last week, but...it's all about finding the balance.'</p>

<p>'It was so up and down, I'm an emotional eater': A few months ago, the pharmacist revealed she tipped the scales at nearly 13 stone (81kg) at her heaviest in January (pictured)</p>

<p>Explaining that they have a genetic predisposition to gaining weight, fellow influencer Mandi said: 'It just takes one bad thing to happen to us and we're on a roll, we eat everything that comes our way. </p>

<p>'Our mum has got all health conditions that come with being weight so we need to be careful with our bodies.'</p>

<p>On dealing with body image and confidence issues in the public eye, reality star Anna added: 'We've definitely had issues with body image. If I was to say that we didn't, it would be a lie. </p>

<p>'A lot of women go through different stages in their life where they might feel a bit insecure or extra confident. We always pick ourselves up and be confident in our own skin.' </p>

<p>The online stars have been subjected to online abuse from cruel trolls during their time in the spotlight, and were even forced to act in s'elf-defence' when they were attacked by a group of teens at Hyde Park back in May.</p>

<p>Anna insisted they've developed thick skin to the naysayers as she said: 'It's really important to talk to someone, we have each other. At the moment we deal with it much better.</p>

<p>'I guess this sounds bad, but I'm immune and desensitised to it now. Mandi is always there for me. When it comes to her, she's rarely affected, she's that bad b***h who doesn't care about things like that. </p>

<p>'I feel like it's made me stronger and I've built up resistance to these trolls. Now someone can be like ''you're fat'' and I would laugh it off.'</p>

<p>'We get so much love and attention when we walk down the street, there's only that rare occasion when we get negativity in person', Mandi added.</p>

<p>On whether she'd be open to following in her sister's footsteps by trying her hand at reality TV, she said: 'I feel like I've got no filter and I'm very controversial, so I would be the most hated person on TV.</p>

<p>Positive: 'We get so much love and attention when we walk down the street, there's only that rare occasion when we get negativity in person', Mandi explained</p>

<p>'You'd either love me or hate me, but why not? I'd give it a go if anyone is brave enough to take me on!'</p>

<p>The Instagram model has teamed up with her sidekick Mandi to launch their inclusive collaboration with Peachland, available from Wednesday.</p>

<p>Revealing the driving force behind their fashion edit, Anna said: 'We want the collection to embrace all women of all sizes. It's very inclusive. </p>

<p>'As Mandi and I are really tall and have really big boobs, it's really difficult to wear clothes from other brands as they have capped cup sizes. We want to give off powerful energy from or collection.'</p>

<p>The FIYAR collection with Peachland is available now and features 100 pieces, available in sizes 6-16 and priced from £10-£40.   </p>
