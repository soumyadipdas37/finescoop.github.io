<p>EXCLUSIVE: TOWIE star Courtney Green has revealed she's reunited with her businessman beau Callum Bushby after reconnecting with him in lockdown (pictured together in August)</p>

<p>Courtney explained that 'something happened' at the beginning of lockdown which made her reach out to Callum, and it's eventually led them to rekindle their romance. </p>

<p>She said: 'I did get back with my ex-boyfriend, something happened at the start of lockdown and we just started talking again. Me and Callum, obviously we're allowed out we've started dating each other and seeing a lot more.</p>

<p>'If lockdown hadn't happened I don't know if we would have got back together. I feel like because lockdown happened we feel like we had a lot of time to chat and we didn't have any distractions.'</p>

<p>Gorgeous! Speaking before the new series she admitted it's unlikely she'd have reunited with Callum if it wasn't for lockdown, and as restrictions lifted they've seen each other 'a lot more'</p>

<p>Courtney was first reported to be dating Essex recruitment consultant Callum in November 2018 following her split from Myles Barnett. </p>

<p>As the rumour mill went into overdrive, a friend of Courtney's confirmed to MailOnline that the pair were an item, but were determined to keep their romance low-key. </p>

<p>Sadly the couple split in December after he allegedly refused to settle down and commit to their relationship.</p>

<p>In March, Courtney then appealed for help when then-ex Callum was slashed across the face with a pair of 'scissors' during a violent attack in Woodford.</p>

<p>Reunited: Courtney was first reported to be dating Essex recruitment consultant Callum in November 2018 following her split from Myles Barnett, and they split in December 2019</p>

<p>Courtney went onto tell MailOnline that she's been working on her businesses during the lockdown after struggling to complete her challenge to 'get a six-pack.'</p>

<p>The star also reflected on the furious backlash she faced from fans after flouting social distancing rules to host a raucous party for her 25th birthday.</p>

<p>Courtney confessed that it was 'silly and stupid' to host the party, even after co-star Chloe Lewis claimed the group had been tested for coronavirus so were therefore 'safe' and allowed to break the rules.</p>

<p>She said: 'Thankfully no one got ill. I've learned from it and it's just such a weird time for everyone, it just felt weird. </p>

<p>'Three days after my birthday we were allowed to sit in restaurants, we were allowed to sit in pubs, so I was a bit confused as to what you could and couldn't do. So I was half-thinking ''why can't I have a couple of friends over? Do I have to sit in a restaurant with them?'' </p>

<p>'But then you live and you learn and I know you've just got to stick to the rules for everybody's sake and everybody else's health as well.'</p>

<p>That's not two metres! The star also reflected on the furious backlash she faced from fans after flouting social distancing rules to host a raucous party for her 25th birthday</p>

<p>Courtney will join her co-stars for TOWIE's new series, which will celebrate the reality show's 10th Anniversary, and has been filmed in accordance with social distancing guidelines.</p>

<p>The star admitted she's found it strange filming the scenes two metres apart, saying: 'It is really strange because your first instinct is to run up because you've not seen your friends for ages, is to run up and give them a hug but you're not allowed to.</p>

<p>'You have to stay two metres apart from everyone, you've got to wear masks, get our temperatures checked because it is really weird but it is easy to adjust to.'</p>

<p>She added that she's had her fair share of highs and lows during her five years on the show, saying: 'So my highs would probably be all the places I got to travel to, I got to go to Thailand. So I liked all the away trips obviously get to be with my friends everyday and I love working with my friend it's an absolute dream.</p>

<p>'Obviously my lows were getting cheated on, that was in public, having all them rows when I first joined, I literally didn't get on with anyone, not one person spoke to me and Chloe it was awful. </p>

<p>'That was really really hard when we first joined, but I've come out the other end! I'm still here!'</p>

<p>Is it that funny? Courtney confessed that it was 'silly and stupid' to host the party, even after co-star Chloe Lewis claimed the group had been tested for coronavirus so were therefore 'safe'</p>

<p>Having never been shy of a confrontation during her early years on the show, Courtney insisted she wouldn't change anything from her time on TOWIE. </p>

<p>'To be honest I wouldn't change anything, because if I wasn't on TOWIE I wouldn't be the person I am now,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'm so strong, I'm still bad in arguments, I'm absolutely awful in arguments, but I wouldn't be so thick-skinned as I am now. I'm not scared of anyone I'm not scared of anything, and I feel like every argument, laughter, I had on the show has made me the strong person I am now.' </p>

<p>TOWIE premieres this Sunday at 9pm on ITVBe, and will continue every Wednesday and Sunday.</p>
