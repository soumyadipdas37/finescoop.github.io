<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Football Association hope the Government's £100billion 'Operation Moonshot' project can prevent Euro 2020 from being played in front of empty stadiums.</p>

<p>There are growing concerns the delayed European Championships will not be played in front of full capacity stadiums - or even worse behind closed doors - next summer after the Government scrapped plans to reintroduce fans back into grounds this week.</p>

<p>The appropriate footballing bodies fear they will not be in a position to slowly phase fans back into stadiums until March.</p>

<p>The FA hopes 'Operation Moonshot' will mean Euro 2020 can be played in front of fans</p>

<p>It could take a number of months before venues are at full capacity, raising concerns Euro 2020 matches played at Wembley and other European venues will be played in front of completely or partially empty grounds when the tournament starts in June.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands, however, the FA believe the situation could change rapidly if the Government can successfully launch Operation Moonshot, a project which would see millions of Covid tests - including some giving results within minutes - processed daily.</p>

<p>The governing body are also being updated on the development of a Covid vaccine, which if successful could accelerate the process of reintroducing spectators to matches before the Euros.      </p>

<p>Plans to allow fans back in stadiums were scrapped this week after a spike in coronavirus cases</p>
