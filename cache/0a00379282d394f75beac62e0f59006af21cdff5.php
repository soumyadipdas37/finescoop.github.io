<p>'My son will be five months old in less than two weeks,' Cooper captioned the selfie. 'He is such a happy baby even though he has started teething.' </p>

<p>'He loves being read to and so far Dr. Seuss is his favorite,' he added. 'Particularly, One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish.' </p>

<p>Though he joked 'Ok, that's my favorite, but he does seem to like it a lot.' </p>

<p>The journalist has previously opened up about his choice to co-parent Wyatt with his ex-boyfriend Benjamin Maisani, who he split from in 2018 after ten years together.  </p>

<p>Speaking in the June Pride issue of People, he said 'I knew what it was like growing up without a dad,' adding, 'If there was ever something that happened to me, I would want Wyatt to be surrounded by love,' in regards to his father Wyatt Cooper passing away during surgery when he was just 10. </p>

<p>In the same issue of the magazine, the new dad said he hasn't ruled out welcoming more children in the future. </p>

<p>'I need to probably sleep a little bit more and clear my head, but I think it would be great, one day, to have a brother or sister for Wyatt,' he said.  'I haven't ruled anything out down the road.' </p>

<p>Despite adjusting to his new schedule, which includes waking up around 7 a.m., after anchoring his CNN show every weekday night, his son has 'changed everything,' while speaking to WSJ. Magazine in August.</p>

<p>'It's changed everything,' he admitted. 'I've often in my life felt like I was waiting for my actual life to begin - it's obviously ridiculous because I'm 53 years old - but… I've been very focused on getting to some place, getting a story. Because I’m focused on him, it gives an order to everything.'</p>
