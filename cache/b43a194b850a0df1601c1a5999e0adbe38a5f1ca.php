<p>Speaking out: Just a day after they were accused of cheating on The Block, Luke and Jasmin (pictured) addressed the scandal during Wednesday's episode</p>

<p>She added: 'Shaynna may have come and had a chat, but the upside is we've still got the [prize] money in our account.</p>

<p>'We've still got the beautiful room that I dare say our buyer's going to fall in love. They're not going to go, "Oh, well, you know, that looks very similar to another room I once saw..."'</p>

<p>Luke, 35, described Shaynna's remarks as 'constructive criticism', but admitted he was 'feeling a little deflated' after being called out.</p>

<p>'We definitely do not want to come off as copycats,' he added.</p>

<p>The 57-year-old judge accused Luke and Jasmin of cheating during a tense conversation during Tuesday's episode. </p>

<p>Shaynna told Luke and Jasmin that she had some concerns about their winning kids' bedroom, after discovering they'd completely ripped off their design. </p>

<p>Brushing it off: When asked how they were feeling the day after their tense confrontation with judge Shaynna Blaze (pictured), the couple claimed they weren't overly concerned</p>

<p>While Shaynna initially thought they had taken inspiration from former Block contestants Kyal and Kara, she said she went home and did some 'fishing'.</p>

<p>'It felt familiar, and then I found this,' she said, before pulling up a series of comparison photos on a tablet.  </p>

<p>Luke and Jasmin's idea for their kids' bedroom had completely come from the pages of interior design magazine, Inside Out, with Shaynna pointing out all the similarities. </p>

<p>Practically identical: Luke and Jasmin's idea for their kids' bedroom had completely come from the pages of interior design magazine, Inside Out</p>

<p>'You're calling it inspiration,' continued Shaynna. 'What happens is inspiration is one thing, completely taking someone's idea and making it your own is another.'</p>

<p>Shaynna explained that it was one thing for them to copy a design for their own home, but she reminded them that they were in a competition.</p>

<p>'You haven't changed it up enough. It's not fair on the other contestants that they can win a room, with money, on someone else's ideas,' she added. </p>

<p>Feeling bad: Luke described Shaynna's remarks as 'constructive criticism', but admitted he was 'feeling a little deflated' after being called out</p>
