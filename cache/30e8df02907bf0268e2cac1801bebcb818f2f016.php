<p>The Australian Magpie is one of the world's most complex songbirds</p>

<p>It can be found across Australia and lives near trees and open areas </p>

<p>The magpie is black and white and feeds on insects and larvae </p>

<p>Magpies will often perform a loud flute-like song in pairs or groups</p>

<p>The birds are known to become aggressive during their breeding season and attack humans or animals near their nests </p>

<p>Magpies swoop to protect their territory while chicks are nesting nearby.</p>

<p>The swooping season began earlier this year due to breeding beginning ahead of schedule due to a mild winter.</p>

<p>Some have observed the birds may be more aggressive as they feel particularly threatened by people wearing face masks.</p>

<p>Birdlife Australia's national public affairs manager, Sean Dooley, said the birds would not be able to recognise people they had previously identified as a friend or threat. </p>

<p>'A magpie may know you and know that you're okay, but when you're wearing a mask they may not be able to recognise you,' Mr Dooley told 3AW last month.</p>

<p>Mr Dooley claimed magpies could recognise and remember up to 100 individual people through facial recognition.</p>

<p>He explained magpies would not be able to tell people apart and could swoop any mask-wearing person that they associated with bad experiences.</p>

<p>'If they're seeing more than 100 people a day and they can't work out who is who they will just start to target those types of people.</p>

<p>'It might be the colour of the mask that makes them go for you,' Mr Dooley explained. </p>

<p>Magpies will most often swoop when they feel threatened and want to protect the young in their nest.</p>

<p>'It's usually a six-week period and they don't all do it at exactly the same time, so any particular pair might swoop for six weeks between September and November,' Dr Kelly said explained.</p>

<p>At least 625 magpie attacks (swooping magpie pictured) have been recorded since June</p>

<p>Dr Kelly warned if had you encountered an aggressive magpie in a particular spot it would most likely return to the same location this year.</p>

<p>'They always go back to the same site so if you had a swooping pair last year you can bet your bottom dollar they're going to be back again this year,' she said. </p>

<p>Australians are advised to avoid eye contact and detour around magpie territories whenever possible.</p>

<p>'If you're riding a bike have a flag on top, they'll usually go for the tallest point, you can also have an umbrella if you really need to,' Dr Kelly said.</p>

<p>As magpies are native to Australia, those affected by the swooping are forbidden from taking any preventative action which may harm the birds or disturb their nests. </p>

<p> *If you are swooped while riding, get off of your bike as many injuries are caused in falls during an attack.</p>

<p>*Keep an ear open for their distinctive warble</p>

<ul>
<li>Stay still and calm to provoke a further attack.</li>
</ul>

<p>*Wear sunglasses and large wide-brimmed hat to protect your head and eyes.</p>

<p>*Face the magpie as they tend to attack from behind. Keep facing the bird as you walk out of their territory to avoid be swooped as soon as you look away.</p>
