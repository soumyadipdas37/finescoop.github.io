<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Queensland nurse has tested positive for COVID-19 after suspecting he may have the virus when he started suffering from a very rare symptom - abdominal pain.</p>

<p>The 37-year-old nurse at the Ipswich Hospital's dedicated virus ward is one of two additional coronavirus infections confirmed by the state on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the nurse at the facility in the state's south-east had pain that ordinarily would not be defined as a COVID-19 symptom.</p>

<p>'He identified he had abdominal pain, not normally considered a symptom of COVID-19, but he was incredibly wise and he identified that that was a symptom that could be from COVID-19,' Mr Miles said.</p>

<p>A medical worker speaks to a person at a drive-through COVID-19 testing facility in Brisbane on August 25. A different healthcare worker has tested positive for the illness after experiencing the rare symptom of abdominal pain (pictured)</p>

<p>'He went and got tested and that test came back positive.'</p>

<p>Mr Miles said the nurse is in a stable condition and has relatively mild symptoms.  </p>

<p>'It underlines how we can all do the right thing by monitoring our health and if we have any symptoms at all that are of any cause for concern we can go and get tests,' he said. </p>

<p>Coronavirus symptoms usually include flu-like afflictions, including a fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. </p>

<p>But abdominal pain has been named as a symptom of an inflammatory condition linked to COVID-19, which has affected some children during the pandemic. </p>

<p>Scientists have said multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is caused by the same virus as COVID-19 - but there is no widespread evidence of the condition in adults.</p>

<p>Experts believe the hyper-inflammatory condition is a delayed immune response to the infection, rendering traditional throat and nose swabs redundant. </p>

<p>MIS-C almost exclusively affects children or young adults, in contrast to COVID-19 which rarely harms the young. </p>

<p>The Royal College of Physicians in May reported 'atypical' cases of three patients presenting at a hospital in Montpellier in France with acute abdominal pain.</p>

<p>All three of them later tested positive for the coronavirus. </p>

<p>Queensland reported two new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 9am, with the total number of active cases reaching 28.</p>

<p>The virus, called COVID-19, is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. </p>

<p>It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. </p>

<p>Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.  </p>

<p>Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms including a sore throat, headache, fever, cough or trouble breathing.  </p>

<p>Severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.  </p>

<p>Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure. </p>

<p>All of those cases are part of a cluster linked to Queensland's Corrective Services Academy in Wacol in south-western Brisbane.</p>

<p>The other new case was an 18-year-old male student at Staines Memorial College at Redbank Plains, south-east of Brisbane.</p>

<p>The school has closed indefinitely after another student tested positive on Sunday night. All 600 students are being screened.</p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced two additional cases of COVID-19 in the state on Tuesday</p>

<p>The health minister said 7,489 tests had been conducted in 24 hours to 9am on Tuesday, up from more than 6864 in the previous 24 hours.</p>

<p>Health restrictions remain in place preventing more than ten people gathering in Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan, the Gold Coast, South Burnett and Goondiwindi without a COVID-19 safety plan.</p>

<p>Mr Miles said restrictions could remain in place for up to four weeks.</p>
