<p>Break: Lacey Turner, 32, is reportedly set to take a lengthy break from EastEnders just as her character Stacey Fowler has returned to Albert Square</p>

<p>An insider said: 'Lacey will be taking a break. The top bosses agreed to give her some time off from the show.</p>

<p>'This is a great opportunity for the writers to come up with something big for Lacey to get her teeth into.'</p>

<p>The source added that Lacey will return to the soap within the year and there are no plans for her to permanently leave EastEnders.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Lacey and EastEnders for comment. </p>

<p>Departure: According to the Daily Star, Lacey's return will be a brief one as she will be off the soap again by the end of the year, with bosses currently plotting her temporary departure</p>

<p>Last year, Stacey bashed Phil Mitchell over the head and left him for dead, before she fled Walford. </p>

<p>She also split up from husband Martin Fowler (James Bye) and has since been dating a man named Jerome.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, tensions are undoubtedly set to rise as Martin has moved on with her best friend Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton). </p>

<p>Speaking about Martin and Ruby's romance, Lacey told Digital Spy: 'I think for Stacey, she just felt angry towards Ruby – that's supposed to be her best friend.</p>

<p>An insider said: 'Lacey will be taking a break. The top bosses agreed to give her some time off from the show'</p>

<p>'She's really sad about her and Martin. In her heart of hearts she does still love him and I think it's quite hard her to watch them together.</p>

<p>'But in true Stacey style, she will just put on a front and pretend she doesn't care. She thinks that it's not that serious and that he's there for the money. She definitely doesn't think it's going to last forever.'  </p>

<p>Lacey added she thinks Stacey is still 'very much in love' with her ex and would take him back tomorrow if she could.  </p>

<p>Stacey's return to EastEnders airs on Monday September 20 at 8:05pm on BBC One.</p>

<p>Return: The source added that Lacey will return to the soap within the year and there are no .plans for her to permanently leave EastEnders (pictured in May 2016)</p>
