<p>Clapping back: Kaley Cuoco recently clapped back at some trolls, who were shaming her for wearing a face mask during her workout, after she posted a video of herself jumping rope</p>

<p>The 34-year-old shared the clip Monday, captioned: 'Jump It Out. My newest obsession during COVID/quarantine! All you need is 20 mins , a jump rope, and good music !'</p>

<p>She showed off her taut physique in a black sports bra, blue shorts and white trainers, with a blue surgical mask.</p>

<p>'You’re wearing a mask because why?' one follower asked, as another commented: 'Don’t use mask to exercise. CO2 Nice going.'   </p>

<p>Cuoco later commented: 'For everyone and their mask comments. I wear a mask when I’m in an enclosed space around others, which I was. I’m protecting myself and everyone around me. That’s why I choose to wear a mask. Thanks for playing.'</p>

<p>Anti-maskers: 'You’re wearing a mask because why?' one follower asked, as another commented: 'Don’t use mask to exercise. CO2 Nice going'</p>

<p>In her defense: As she appeared to be keeping with CDC guidelines, Kaley later defended herself in a comment</p>

<p>She also received some support from followers, one person writing: 'Best exercise ever!! And well done for doing it with a mask on! Being a great example.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Wearing a mask is not dangerous if you listen to your body. Kaley will likely feel a lot fitter after exercising like this once she can train without wearing a mask. It’s like athletes doing altitude training. She is being a responsible citizen, it’s a shame more people can’t be!!' </p>

<p>The CDC guidelines on the topic state: 'People who are engaged in high intensity activities, like running, may not be able to wear a mask if it causes difficulty breathing. </p>

<p>'If unable to wear a mask, consider conducting the activity in a location with greater ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors) and where it is possible to maintain physical distance from others.'</p>

<p>Kaley has recently returned to work on her HBO Max series The Flight Attendant, sharing some behind-the-scenes masked selfies last week with costar Michiel Huisman.</p>

<p>She captioned the photos: 'We’re back!! Keeping our distance of course! ...Time to land this [airplane emoji]!'</p>

<p>The suspenseful drama series went on hiatus back in March, as the COVID-19 lockdown forced Hollywood to temporarily shut down.</p>

<p>Production previously wrapped on all international locations, with about three episodes left to shoot, which will all film in New York City.</p>

<p>Back to work: Kaley recently returned to work on her upcoming drama series The Flight Attendant, after undergoing a mandatory two-week quarantine</p>

<p>Land that plane: She shared some behind-the-scenes masked selfies last week with costar Michiel Huisman, writing: 'We’re back!! Keeping our distance of course! ...Time to land this [airplane emoji]!'</p>

<p>Co-worker goals: She also shared another masked-up selfie over the holiday weekend with costar Zosia Mamet</p>

<p>Kaley executive produces and stars as Cassie, a flight attendant who wakes up in a strange place with a dead man in her bed and no recollection of what happened.</p>

<p>She also shared a masked-up selfie over the weekend with costar Zosia Mamet, writing: 'Friends that get covid tested every few days , wear masks, take necessary pre-cautions, listen to production rules , wash hands all day long and respect the process together, get to act together <?php echo e('@'); ?>zosiamamet </p>

<p>'This picture was taken right before we shot today’s scene in a very structured quarantined environment. Very proud of our cast and crew at #theflightattendant and everyone <?php echo e('@'); ?>warnerbrostv &amp; <?php echo e('@'); ?>hbomax for making this possible for us!'</p>

<p>The 8 Simple Rules actress revealed last month on Instagram that she was returning to work on her new show.</p>

<p>She said in a video: 'The first update would be that I am going back to work! So my sister, me and my trusty assistant Emma go back to New York on Monday. And we have to quarantine – I'm sure you'll see a lot of stuff on social media about our quarantine.</p>

<p>'We'll be quarantined for two weeks and you'll get a look at our shenanigans, I'm sure. And then back to work. We only have like two and a half episodes left, so I'm going to wrap up by the beginning of October.'</p>

<p>The show, which is expected to premiere in November, is based on the 2018 novel of the same name by Chris Bohjalian.</p>

<p>Kaley continued: 'I don't have an exact date but that is exciting at all in itself. I don't know if you guys know this but I have been working on this project for three years. </p>

<p>'It goes back to three years from when I actually found the original book, so it's very exciting for me, and then obviously developing it for over two years.'</p>

<p>Mystery ensues: Kaley executive produces and stars as Cassie, a flight attendant who wakes up in a strange place with a dead man in her bed and no recollection of what happened</p>
