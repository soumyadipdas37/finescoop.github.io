<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will speak with Mason Greenwood over his expulsion from the England squad, but Manchester United are determined to protect their teenage striker from any further fallout.</p>

<p>Manchester City are likely to adopt a similar policy over Phil Foden after the young Premier League stars were sent home from Iceland in disgrace for smuggling two girls into England’s team hotel in Reykjavik.</p>

<p>Foden has not returned to training with City yet, although Pep Guardiola’s side don’t kick off the new season until a week on Monday when they play Wolves at home.</p>

<p>Mason Greenwood broke cover on Wednesday after being sent home from the England squad</p>

<p>Greenwood will soon speak to Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer over the incident </p>

<p>There is a desire at United to protect  the 18-year-old Greenwood from any further fallout </p>

<p>United also have a late start two days earlier against Crystal Palace and Greenwood was undergoing a Covid risk assessment on Wednesday to determine when he can rejoin his teammates at Carrington.</p>

<p>Solskjaer will discuss the breach of discipline with Greenwood that followed the 18-year-old’s senior England debut against Iceland, but it’s understood the emphasis will be on learning a lesson from the first controversy of his fledgling career.</p>

<p>Sources at United and City have stressed that both clubs are wary of adding to the widespread criticism of the players having already issued statements condemning the incident.</p>

<p>Solskjaer and United are said to be keen to ensure lessons are learned from the controversy</p>

<p>Greenwood made his England debut in the 1-0 Nations League win over Iceland at the weekend</p>

<p>United and Greenwood do not begin the Premier League season until September 19</p>

<p>City slammed Foden’s ‘totally inappropriate’ actions while United said they were ‘disappointed’ in Greenwood.</p>

<p>The clubs will take into account the young age and inexperience of the two England debutants who have both made public apologies since being kicked out of the squad by manager Gareth Southgate on Monday.</p>

<p>They were denied an opportunity to win a second cap against Denmark on Tuesday night, and could be punished further by missing next month’s games with Wales, Belgium and the Danes again.</p>

<p>Southgate, who confirmed that Foden and Greenwood would have been sent home irrespective of the breach of quarantine, stressed the importance of helping them move on from the controversy.</p>

<p>But shortly after, both he and fellow debutant Phil Foden (left) were out of the England squad </p>

<p>Gareth Southgate said he would have sent Greenwood home even if quarantine wasn't in place</p>

<p>‘You’ve got to help young people get back on their feet,’ said the England boss.</p>

<p>‘There has to be consequence to what happened and then we have to help them rebuild. That doesn’t mean you hold that against them forever.</p>

<p>‘With the spotlight that is on them, what their families will be having to deal with, that’s an incredible ordeal. I have to try and help, with their clubs as well.</p>

<p>‘They are young men that need support because everyone is wading in on them. They need help to rebuild and understand the expectations of being an England player. That’s going to take time.’</p>
