<p>Exciting: Amanda Holden, 49, has revealed she's dedicated a song on her debut album Songs From My Heart to her late son Theo ahead of its release this month</p>

<p>Amanda told The Mirror: 'The last lines of this song are ''You took my life with you, Took my world with you'' and so this is for Theo, our baby who was born sleeping and for Chris who stayed strong when I fell apart.</p>

<p>'It was Chris who told me he always thought of Theo when he heard this song which floored me so it's also his song for Theo.</p>

<p>'It's very emotional to sing this song but I think you get chosen for experiences like that only if you are strong enough to deal with it. And it changes you.'</p>

<p>In July Amanda spoke candidly about the devastating moment she learned there was no heartbeat when she was pregnant with her baby son.</p>

<p>Speaking on BBC's Dear NHS Superstars special, the star explained that she chose to have a C-section and initially thought she would not be able to hold her baby after he was born.</p>

<p>Performer: Amanda announced her album plans after releasing a cover of the ballad Over The Rainbow in May to raise money for NHS charities</p>

<p>She said: 'I kept saying, "I can't hold a dead baby." I was absolutely terrified. Just as baby was going to come out my husband Chris had to leave the room, he couldn't bear it. </p>

<p>'Jackie [her midwife] wrapped him up and I said, "Jackie, I can't do it, I can't hold him." Jackie said, "he's absolutely gorgeous, you need to see him."</p>

<p>'That's when I held him even though he was fast asleep. The one thing I remember is his perfectly formed eyebrows, which all my children have.'</p>

<p>Amanda became emotional as she remembered the moment and said she and Chris were given 'keepsakes' of Theo to take home with them. </p>
