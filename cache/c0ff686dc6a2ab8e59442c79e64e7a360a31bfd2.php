<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Slaven Bilic would be 'extremely disappointed' if West Bromwich Albion fail to re-sign his key target Filip Krovinovic and urged the club board to find the funds to make the deal happen.</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed last month that Bilic was growing increasingly frustrated at Albion's work in the market and on Thursday he sent a clear message to his bosses about the importance of bringing in midfielder Krovinovic from Benfica.</p>

<p>Bilic's fellow Croatian made 43 appearances in all competitions as Albion were promoted to the Premier League last term and would like to return, yet the club have still not agreed terms with Benfica, who are believed to be seeking a loan fee with an obligation to buy at the end of the campaign.</p>

<p>Slaven Bilic is determined for West Brom to re-sign Filip Krovinovic (right) this summer</p>

<p>Bilic sent a clear message to his bosses that the club need to find the money to re-sign him</p>

<p>'I would be extremely disappointed if it doesn't happen,' said Bilic, whose side face Everton tomorrow/on Saturday. 'I don't want to even think about it.</p>

<p>'Every day when I walk in the training ground I ask "Is he coming?" because last year he was brilliant for us. That is how highly I value him.' </p>

<p>Asked why the 25-year-old had not yet joined, Bilic said: 'Budget. We have to find some money for a loan or whatever.</p>

<p>Krovinovic is believed to be keen on a return to the Hawthorns but a deal is yet to be agreed</p>

<p>'He wants to come, we want him here. Everybody wants him here, there is a strong will. I heard there is a possibility also from Benfica so that is why I'm optimistic regarding Filip.' </p>

<p>Albion have completed permanent deals for three of last season's loan players, Grady Diangana, Matheus Pereira and Callum Robinson, but Bilic is desperate to add a quick centre-forward before the window closes on October 5.</p>

<p>'I would love to do it,' he said. 'It's important to bring someone in who is different to other strikers in the club. We are trying to do it. It's not easy but it's instrumental for us.' </p>
