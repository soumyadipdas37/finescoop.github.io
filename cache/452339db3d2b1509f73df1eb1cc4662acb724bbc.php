<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The governor of New York has recruited Paul Rudd to star in a jokey video encouraging young people to wear face masks, which has sharply divided critics online.</p>

<p>In the clip, which is just over two minutes long, Rudd, 51, takes on the persona of a 'hip' young person, dressed in a yellow hoodie and NY baseball cap, with headphones around his neck and holding a skateboard.</p>

<p>'Yo, what up doogs, Paul Rudd here - actor and certified young person,' he begins.</p>

<p>Paul Rudd, 51, adopted a millennial persona for Andrew Cuomo's public service announcement</p>

<p>With his skateboard and hoodie, he laughingly riffed off a 'youth culture' script</p>

<p>'A few days ago I was chatting on the iPhone with my homey Governor Cuomo, and he was just going off on how us millennials need to wear masks because - get this - apparently a lot of COVID is transmitted by us millennials.'</p>

<p>The New Jersey-born actor said that 'Cuoms' had asked him to get the message across.</p>

<p>'So fam, let's real talk,' he said. 'Masks - they are totally beast! So slide that into your DMs and twitch it.'</p>

<p>Rudd vows 'not to preach like some celebrity - ugh.'</p>

<p>He then claims that Billie Eilish, 18-year-old singer-songwriter, is calling him to say she, too, is wearing a mask.</p>

<p>'You're so my bae,' he tells her.</p>

<p>At one point Rudd pretended to call his 'bae', Billie Eilish</p>

<p>He said 'caring about other people is the new "not caring about other people"'</p>

<p>Rudd then spoofed a TikTok dance in a bid to win over young viewers</p>

<p>'Listen up - caring about other people is the new "not caring about other people",' he concludes, before doing a TikTok and rapping: 'My name is Paul, I'm six feet tall - almost.'</p>

<p>Rudd then sheds the persona, as the screen behind him turns grey.</p>

<p>He becomes serious, saying: 'It's not hard. People are dying, hundreds of thousands of people are dying. I shouldn't have to make it fun - it's science!'</p>

<p>The clip then concludes with Rudd on Hot Ones, a wildly popular YouTube show where celebrities eat successively spicier BBQ wings while answering pointed questions.</p>

<p>Both Rudd and host Sean Evans have their face masks on, smeared with BBQ sauce.</p>

<p>The background switched when the actor became serious, pleading for mask wearing</p>

<p>Rudd concluded by appearing on an episode of Hot Ones with his face mask on</p>

<p>Host Sean Evans and Rudd both sported face masks smeared with hot sauce </p>

<p>Responses to the spoof video were mixed.</p>

<p>'I don't understand,' one person said.</p>

<p>'They tried to make a satire of cringey public service announcements.... while creating an even more cringey public service announcement which was serious? </p>

<p>'It just comes off as mocking younger people while trying to preach at them about masks....' </p>

<p>Another told Cuomo: 'I think the crime and businesses closing are what you should really be focused on!'</p>

<p>One self-described Trump supporter and 'deplorable' tweeted: 'I was embarrassed for both of you while watching this.' </p>

<p>And another social media, tweeting with the Twitter handle <?php echo e('@'); ?>lameland, said: 'This is so cringe.' </p>

<p>Yet others were more charitable.</p>

<p>Lisa Helvey-Poole tweeted: 'Most funny thing I have seen yet in masks! Loved it!'</p>

<p>And another concluded: 'I’m a millennial and I approve this message. Paul Rudd never ages.' </p>

<p>On Twitter, some users were left bemused by the spoof advert</p>

<p>Others felt that the clip was a waste of Cuomo's resources and energy</p>

<p>Avowed Trump supporter Harvey said that he was left embarrassed by the clip</p>

<p>Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>lameland said she found the clip 'so cringe'</p>

<p>Others, however, found the skit amusing</p>

<p>Even millennials were left laughing at Rudd's comedic efforts</p>
