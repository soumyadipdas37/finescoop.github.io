<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother has opened up about her painful struggles of living without an oesophagus and stomach after a restaurant mistakenly gave her oven cleaner as a remedy for her hiccups.</p>

<p>Amanda Merrifield believed she was swallowing vinegar when she was handed the spoonful of toxic chemicals at The Point, on the Gold Coast, in 2013. </p>

<p>The chef had mistaken the oven cleaner for cooking liquid, which was kept in a similar looking bottle, before then-owner Paul Jeynes handed it to Mrs Merrifield.  </p>

<p>The 46-year-old immediately collapsed in pain and has since endured more than 80 surgeries, 120 hospital visits and seven years of agony, Courier Mail reported.</p>

<p>A mother (pictured, Amanda Merrifield) has opened up about her painful struggles of living without an oesophagus and stomach after a restaurant mistakenly gave her oven cleaner as a remedy for her hiccups</p>

<p>'After the first two months in hospital I was on the operating table every week for months, and then every two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, trying to save my oesophagus,' she said. </p>

<p>Mrs Merrifield had her oesophagus and stomach removed and has to take medications and some injections at least three times a day just to keep her body 'somewhat liveable'.</p>

<p>'Mentally and physically, it's broken me,' she said.</p>

<p>The distraught mother has also lost her career prospects as a lawyer as well as her social life.</p>

<p>Her time is spent mostly at home with every life decision centred around her injuries.</p>

<p>Husband Bob and nine-year-old son Jack have been with her every step of the way.</p>

<p>'My hope is to stay alive and see my son grow up and not feel like I'm a burden all the time,' Mrs Merrifield said. </p>

<p>Queensland Health, Blue Care and private health insurer Bupa have provided some relief for Mrs Merrifield.</p>

<p>The insurer of the restaurant has also paid for some of the expenses.</p>

<p>But Mrs Merrifield and her family are slowly bending under the strain of hospital bills.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old immediately collapsed in pain and has since endured more than 80 surgeries, 120 hospital visits and seven years of agony</p>

<p>Mrs Merrifield had her oesophagus and stomach removed and has to take medications and some injections at least three times a day just to keep her body 'somewhat liveable'</p>

<p>The family has also launched a $5million claim against the restaurant in 2018.  </p>

<p>No-one has been charged over the incident and the local council told the restaurant to label its products more clearly.</p>

<p>Ms Merrifield earlier told reporters then-owner Mr Jeynes has never apologised to her.</p>

<p>'Never, I've never heard from him again, ever,' she said,</p>

<p>However Mr Jeynes said he has 'apologised profusely'.</p>

<p>The restaurant has since been sold to a new owner and has a new name. </p>
