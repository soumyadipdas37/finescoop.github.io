<p>TMZ reports that in the book, Carey says SHE shared 'a warm, slow, intoxicating kiss' on Jeter's roof (which would be the inspiration behind her hit song The Roof) but they decided against going any further as she was married at the time.</p>

<p>Carey writes: 'Everything was so new and sweet, down to the smooth texture of his honey-dipped skin. It was how it was supposed to feel.'</p>

<p>Yet it was not meant to last, as Carey said 'DJ was a love in my life, not of my life.' </p>

<p>'Of course I do! I can never forget that moment,' Carey said in an excerpt of the memoir, which will  be published on September 29.</p>

<p>'I mean, it’s not like it was some intensely deep, intellectually stimulating — again, it was a great moment, and it happened in a divine way because it helped me get past living there, in Sing Sing, under those rules and regulations,' she added.</p>
