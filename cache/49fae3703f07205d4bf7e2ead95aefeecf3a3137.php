<p>The horrifying incident took place in the Dordogne village of Parcoul-Chenaud, north east of Bordeaux, on Friday.</p>

<p>Irritated by the fly on a sultry evening, the 80-year-old, who has not been named, took out an electronic bug zapper.</p>

<p>A French pensioner blew up his kitchen and the roof above it while trying to kill a fly with an electronic zapper (stock image)</p>

<p>The contraption – which looks like a tennis racket – is designed to burn insects the moment there is contact.</p>

<p>'On this occasion, gas was leaking into the man's house,' said an investigating source. 'The very hot zapper ignited the gas, causing a sudden explosion.</p>

<p>'The man was lucky to get away with a burned hand after diving on the floor, but the kitchen was destroyed along with part of the roof.'</p>

<p>The fly had been disturbing the man while he was eating dinner but the gas had been left on, causing an explosion when he used the electronic swatter</p>

<p>The man was treated in hospital in Libourne following the disaster, which happened at around 7.45pm.</p>

<p>He has not been allowed to return to the house, and is instead staying in a local campsite until repairs are carried out.</p>

<p>It is not known whether the fly survived the blast, but it appeared that it had at least escaped being incinerated by the zapper.</p>

<p>In 2007, a two-year-old Thai boy ended up in hospital in Bangkok with severe burns caused by an electric zapper.</p>

<p>The horrifying incident took place in the Dordogne village of Parcoul-Chenaud (pictured), north east of Bordeaux, on Friday</p>

<p>The child's father had been using the device to kill a mosquito in a workroom containing flammable adhesive glue that had ended up on the floor.</p>

<p>After the insect made contact with the metallic mesh screen, an electrical arc was generated, and the insect was incinerated.</p>

<p>The boy then placed the hot swatter on to the floor, which ignited the glue and then the boy's clothing.</p>
