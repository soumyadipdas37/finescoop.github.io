<p>Gordon Ramsay has branded a fan an 'idiot sandwich' after the chef came under fire for sharing a picture of his lacklustre £19 Full English breakfast. The Scotland-born chef, 53, shared a picture to Twitter earlier this week of his new breakfast dish which will be served as part of his menu at his central London restaurant the Savoy Grill from Monday</p>

<p>But as soon as it was shared online, many questioned the size of the 'quintessentially British' dish, given it's £19 price tag.</p>

<p>Essex-based Tony Moore, shared a a snap of a fry up made by the 'Fry Up Police',writing : 'THIS is a full English Gordon. Take a leaf out of <?php echo e('@'); ?>fryuppolice 's book....'</p>

<p>The dish consisted of six slices of toast, two eggs, two black puddings, three sausages, baked beans, a hash brown, bacon, mushroom and tomaotes.</p>

<p>Not taking criticism for an amateur cook, Gordon quipped back 'That’s called a Full English Classic Heart Attack you idiot sandwich'.</p>

<p>The phrase is a reference to a sketch Gordon acted in on the Late Late show with James Corden in 2016.</p>

<p>In the sketch - dubbed Hell's Cafeteria, a parody of his own show Hell's Kitchen - Gordon holds two pieces of bread either side of TV host's Julie Chen head and calls her an 'idiot sandwich'.</p>

<p>The photo has since become viral meme, and Gordon has revealed he's often asked by fans to reenact the scene.</p>

<p>Fans were quick to question the size of Gordon's meal, with many upset the dish had no hash browns</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the celebrity chef took to TikTok to brand a food writer an idiot sandwich after she made a 'low carb sandwich'.  </p>

<p>In one of the clips in his new #RamsayReacts series, Gordon shows his disgust to a 'low carb' meal by influencer My Nguyen.</p>

<p>To make the dish, the food writer from Brentwood, California smears cream cheese over an orange bell pepper, before adding seasoning, turkey ham and slathering it in  mustard.</p>

<p>Shaking his head in disgust, Gordon shouts: 'That is not a sandwich. Young lady, that is an idiot sandwich'.</p>
