<p>Charley Hull (above) has tested positive for coronavirus and will miss the ANA Inspiration</p>

<p>'I am very disappointed to have to withdraw from what is one of my favorite (sic) events of the year but wish everyone the best of luck at this week's tournament and look forward to when I can return to playing on Tour.'</p>

<p>Hull, whose runner-up finish at Mission Hills Country Club in 2016 remains her best performance at a major, missed the cut at last month's AIG Women's Open.</p>

<p>The world number 28 added: 'I didn't feel great yesterday but I put it down to jet lag, the heat and my asthma playing up.</p>

<p>'I now realise I have some mild symptoms which feel similar to having a cold and I am self-isolating and working with the Tour on contact tracing.'</p>
