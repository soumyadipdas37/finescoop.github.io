<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother has revealed how she was able to renovate an old caravan with the help of her sister while embracing her creative streak in lockdown.</p>

<p>Katie Dolphin, 34, who lives in Warrington, was tasked with rejuvenating a tired mobile home that her parents bought second-hand for £1,000. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two and her sister Amy spent an additional £1,000 on Frenchic paint, accessories from Asda and Facebook Marketplace to transform the caravan into a gorgeous, modern space. </p>

<p>Katie who is a pastoral manager revealed the DIY project saved them large sums, estimating that buying a caravan already renovated to a similar standard would have cost up to £5,000.</p>

<p>She shared a selection of impressive before and after photographs of the caravan with money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk.   </p>

<p>Katie said: 'During the lockdown, my mum and dad spotted a caravan for a sale from a friend for £1,000.</p>

<p>'They decided to buy it and asked me and my sister if we would do it up.</p>

<p>'I've always had a passion for painting and I'm always doing things in my house.</p>

<p>'I discovered Frenchic paint and used it on projects in my house, so I decided to try it in the caravan. I found a local stockist and purchased the following colours.</p>

<p>'I bought Wolf Whistle for the main colour, which we used on the walls and cupboards, Stormzy for the kitchen cupboards, Dusky Blush, which I used on one wall and created a blackboard for the kids, and Blackjack on the kitchen worktops and taps.</p>

<p>Katie who estimates a newly renovated caravan would've cost £5,000, said she has always had a passion for painting and completing projects around her home. Pictured: The caravan before</p>

<p>Katie used heat resistant paint to give the cooker and heater a new lease of life in addition to adding sticky tiles in the kitchen area. Pictured: The caravan after </p>

<p>'I used heat-resistant paint for the cooker and heater.</p>

<p>'I used white enamel spray to respray the yellow kitchen sink. We added sticky back tiles in the kitchen area also.</p>

<p>'A friend recovered the seats, which cost £400 for fabric and work. A friend made the curtains which in total cost £200.</p>

<p>Katie and Amy (pictured) said a friend recovered the caravan seats for £400</p>

<p>'We found the carpet free on Facebook Marketplace.</p>

<p>'The rest was cushions and accessories mainly from ASDA online.</p>

<p>'The cost of a caravan done up nicely would normally cost over double.</p>

<p>'I think you'd have to spend between £4,000 and £5,000 for a caravan with newly decorated seat coverings, curtains, carpets and all newly painted.</p>

<p>'I reckon with the cost of caravan, cushions, curtains, paint and accessories, it's cost another £1,000, so £2,000 in total and it's been worth every penny.</p>

<p>'The kids are so excited about holidays in it and love the idea of the chalkboard.'</p>

<p>Gushing about the results of the caravan renovation, Katie said the project was a great distraction during the many months of self-isolation.   </p>

<p>'Me and my sister created this and it really helped us throughout lockdown,' she said.</p>

<p>'We had this parked on my nan's drive. My nan is 80 and was self-isolating but seeing us daily visiting the caravan and having a sneak peek really helped her emotionally and mentally, because it meant she got to see us from afar too.</p>

<p>Katie explained that the DIY renovation was the perfect project for helping them stay busy throughout lockdown. Pictured: The caravan before, left and after, right </p>

<p>Katie said completing the project on the driveway of their 80-year-old grandmother helped her emotionally and mentally, while self-isolating. Pictured: The caravan after </p>

<p>'It was hard finding the time to do it with the girls, but I mainly did it when my husband was home from work.</p>

<p>'We knew it would be worth it to make memories with the family.'</p>

<p>Tom Church who is the co-founder of LatestDeals.co.uk, said: 'It's always tempting to buy something swanky and new, but as Katie's caravan project shows, it's definitely not the most cost-effective way forward.</p>

<p>'Instead, buying second-hand - whether furniture, clothes or caravans - and then using your creative talents to upcycle it - is affordable, eco-friendly and can save you thousands!'</p>

<p>Admitting it was challenging to find time for the project, Katie said she often worked on the caravan when her husband was home from work. Pictured: The caravan after </p>
