<p>Wow! Kylie Minogue, 52, looked sensational in a black mini dress and jewelled garter with matching gloves, in snaps shared to her social media accounts on Tuesday</p>

<p>Kylie, who is gearing up to release her 15th studio album, put on an elegantly leggy display in the tiny halter neck frock.</p>

<p>With a light shining behind her, the singer peered through her dishevelled tresses for the sultry snaps.  </p>

<p>Last month, Kylie spoke about what it was like to film the music video clip for her new single Say Something entirely in front of a green screen amid COVID-29 restrictions.   </p>

<p>'It was a different shoot with the restrictions but it felt good to be back on set,' the songstress told The Herald Sun.    </p>

<p>Disco! The popstar held onto one arm as she stooped forward in the shots, while putting on an elegantly leggy display in a strappy pair of stilettos</p>

<p>Different!: Last month, Kylie revealed what it was like to film her Say Something video clip entirely in front of a green screen amid coronavirus restrictions </p>

<p>During the clip, Kylie rides a horse statue as a salute to Bianca Jagger, who famously rode a white horse on the Studio 54 dance floor. </p>

<p>'The horse was the star of the show. I don't think my galactic steed was designed to be ridden, but I fell in love with him, he was gorgeous,' she said. </p>

<p>She finished: 'I hope when people see it, it takes them to another level and away to wherever their happy place is.'  </p>

<p>This is the 15th studio album for the songstress, who has a global cult following, including in her native Australia and the UK.  </p>

<p>Stunning visuals: The clip, directed by Sophie Muller, sees the pop princess riding a golden horse and dancing in front of an interstellar backdrop</p>

<p>The album is said to be a return to form for Kylie, whose last record Golden was a country-inspired effort. </p>

<p>A source told the The Sun: 'From what I've heard of it so far, the new record is set to be a disco classic.</p>

<p>'It's everything you want from a Kylie album. Fans are going to love it. She has been working on her new music for a while now but everything has really come together in the last few months.'</p>

<p>She's back! Say Something is the first single from Kylie's upcoming album, Disco, due out November 6</p>
