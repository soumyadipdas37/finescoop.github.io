<p>Kim began a four-year apprenticeship at a law firm in San Francisco in 2018 and is working under Erin Haney and Jessica Jackson to complete her law studies, according to NBC.</p>

<p>Kardashian often documents her rigorous study sessions, which involve plenty of extensive note taking, on her Instagram Story.</p>

<p>But Wednesday evening's session proved to be a real treat for Kim and her renown mentors. </p>

<p>You decide: 'Tequila and torts...Cocktails and contracts...Crunk and crim...' she listed, followed by a laughing face emoji</p>

<p>In March, she spoke of how becoming a mother prompted her to begin her apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Speaking to Grazia, the beauty, who is a little more than a year into a four year law course, said: ‘Becoming a mom has really opened up my heart, and it’s changed me. </p>

<p>‘I don’t know if this journey would have happened for me before I was a mom. I will do what I can to help keep on shouting the stories of these people I’ve met.’</p>

<p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said she was 'prideful' that she could set an example for her children through her work and that a 'big part' of life should be giving back.</p>
