<p>Problems: Jessica shocks Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif as she opens up about her disastrous surgeries in Mexico on Monday night's episode of the E! reality series Botched</p>

<p>First: After undergoing a dramatic weight loss that left her with sagging skin, Jessica had a breast augmentation and a tummy tuck in Guadalajara, but she wasn't 'happy' with the results</p>

<p>'I wanted bigger breasts, maybe even another tummy tuck,' she explains to the doctors. 'I still had, you know, flabby skin.' </p>

<p>Jessica opted to have another breast augmentation to increase the size of her implants, another tummy tuck, and liposuction —  this time in Tijuana, where her friend had recently had plastic surgery.  </p>

<p>'The surgeon taped me with surgical tape. No gauze. Nothing,' she recalls. 'So I called my sister, and she's slowly, slowly trying to remove it.' </p>

<p>Jessica's sister tells the doctors that it looked like the skin was actually 'coming off with the tape.' </p>

<p>And that basically left me with scars everywhere,' Jessica adds. </p>

<p>Ouch: Jessica wanted 'bigger breasts' and more skin removed, so she went to Tijuana to have another round of surgeries. The surgeon applied surgical tape directly onto her wounds</p>

<p>Disaster: When the surgical tape was removed, she was left with scars all over her stomach</p>

<p>'Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif are visibly stunned that her surgeon would make such a grave and careless mistake.    </p>

<p>'Wow, you know what? I don't think I've ever said this in my entire life. I'm speechless,' Dr. Dubrow tells her. 'Did you call him and say, "Hey I've got this disaster brewing?"' </p>

<p>Jessica notes that when she contacted the surgeon, he blamed her for removing the tape, saying: 'Well, I told you not to take it off.'   </p>

<p>In his testimonial, Dr. Dubrow warns that tape should never be directly put onto a wound because it will lead to unnecessary scarring.   </p>

<p>'As the skin stretches and becomes swollen, the tape does not expand with it and will cause a burn type reaction to the skin,' he explains. </p>

<p>Oh no: Despite the trauma, Jessica went under the knife for a second time in Tijuana to fix her breasts and ended up with 'butchered boobs'</p>

<p>Why risk it? Dr. Nassif (left) and Dr. Dubrow (right) couldn't believe that Jessica would get another surgery in Tijuana after being permenantly scarred </p>

<p>End result: Jessica says her third breast augmentation left her with a nipple that sits on top of her breast</p>

<p>Despite everything that had happened to her, Jessica decided to have a third breast augmentation in Tijuana, much to the doctors' surprise.    </p>

<p>After my second surgery, I had oval looking breasts. I wanted to do something about it, so I went back to Tijuana. But my third surgeon definitely left me with butchered boob,' she admits in her testimonial.</p>

<p>Dr. Nassif can't help but ask Jessica where that trust came from when she planned another surgery in Tijuana after having such a traumatic experience.</p>

<p>Jessica said she was 'was seeing a lot of girls out and about' with good results from doctors, so she decided to take the plunge — again. But, unfortunately, for Jessica, the third time wasn't a charm. </p>

<p>'So before my surgery, my nipple was here,' she says, pointing to the middle of her chest. 'My nipple is here now,' she notes, pointing to the top of her breast.</p>

<p>'I mean, this is a disaster,' Dr. Dubrow admits at the end of the clip.  </p>
