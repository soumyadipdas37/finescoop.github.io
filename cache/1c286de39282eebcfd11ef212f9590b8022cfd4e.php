<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A single Australian radio producer has shared her worst Tinder date of all time, which involved a man inviting all of his conquests to a house party 'like The Bachelor'.</p>

<p>Triple M radio worker Jana Hocking, 36, has dubbed Tinder the 'sleaziest' online dating app after an encounter she had with a narcissistic male a few years ago.</p>

<p>'He had just moved into a swanky new apartment and was clearly keen to show off,' she told FEMAIL. 'I was meeting his friends for the first time, but turns out I was also meeting the other girls he was dating!'</p>

<p>She described how everyone was sitting in his lounge room getting to know each other when one girl casually mentioned that she was dating him.  </p>

<p>'Then another girl was like, "wait, I'm dating him as well" and I just went straight to the bedroom to grab my bag,' Jana said.</p>

<p>'He came in to check on me and I told him about the other two girls and he freaked out, followed me down the stairs as I left telling me not to leave but I was out of there.'</p>

<p>Over the following days the man - who had acted like he was a contestant on The Bachelor - texted, called and apologised to Jana for what had happened.</p>

<p>'But once a player always a player. Such a douche,' she said.</p>

<p>After sharing the Tinder fail with her broader friendship circle Jana discovered she wasn't the only one who had been exposed to sleazy behaviour.  </p>

<p>'My friend discovered her stepbrother was on the app. Her MARRIED stepbrother,' she told news.com.au.</p>

<p>'Another friend went on a date with a Tinder guy whose girlfriend slid into her DMs to inform her that he lived with her and they were expecting a child.'</p>

<p>She argues that more people are turning to the likes of Bumble and Hinge to procure a date, over the 'cesspit of f**kboys' that is Tinder, because you can get a feel for another person's personality before going out to dinner.</p>

<p>'Tinder just feels like that seedy late-night bar people go to when they're just looking for some action,' Jana said.</p>

<p>Despite her disaster dating story Jana has previously spoken about the importance of seeing 'more than one person at a time' to avoid needlessly getting your heart broken.   </p>

<p>Despite her disaster dating story Jana has previously spoken about the importance of seeing 'more than one person at a time' to avoid needlessly getting your heart broken</p>

<p>She believes that having two men at any one time is feasible but any more is a 'juggling act'.</p>

<p>'Plus you forget what you've said on dates and end up telling them the same story twice,' she said.</p>

<p>There are some downsides to employing her strategy though, namely that you could be on one date and run into the other 'date' while out and about. </p>

<p>'I once got caught doing the Bondi to Bronte walk in Sydney with a guy, the morning after I had been on a date with another guy who was on the same walk,' she said.</p>

<p>'What was worse is that he stopped to chat and I had to introduce him to my current date.'</p>

<p>Once you've been on a few outings with someone and things are looking more likely to progress, that's when you'll need to decide who you want to be with.</p>

<p>'I think you know something is real once they have done something that would normally turn you off, like farting or having a boogie on their face, and you still like them. Not the most romantic answer but true,' Jana said.  </p>
