<p>Happy news: Binky Felstead flashed her new £50,000 engagement ring as she was pictured for the first time since announcing her engagement to Max Darnton over the weekend</p>

<p>Josh appeared to be heading off to a workout, arriving to the meeting wearing sports gear with the former couple's daughter India on his shoulders. </p>

<p>Binky and Josh met while co-starring in Made In Chelsea in 2015 and dated on and off until September 2018, when they confirmed their split.  </p>

<p>Bride-to-be: Binky looked casual in a nude shirt dress and trainers, while sheltering her eyes with a pair of dark shades</p>

<p>Oliver Horner, a gemologist for Prestige Pawnbrokers from Channel 4's Posh Pawn, told MailOnline: 'Binky's statement engagement ring is inspired by the Art Deco period from around the 1920s/30s and looks to be set with a centre diamond weighing between 2.5 to 3 carats.</p>

<p>'A double halo surround made up of smaller stones brings the total diamond weight to approximately six carats. </p>

<p>'The hexagonal halo looks to be set in bi-coloured 18ct gold. It's an unusual but stunning choice for an engagement ring and I would estimate the cost to be in the region of £50,000.'</p>

<p>Binky revealed her good news via Instagram when she shared a picture of her kissing the businessman while holding up her hand to show off the sparkling diamond ring.</p>

<p>Mr and Mrs: The reality star announced her engagement to businessman boyfriend Max Darnton, 30, on Sunday after a 19-month romance</p>

<p>Gushing about the proposal, which took place on Friday after Max asked her daughter India for permission to pop the question, she wrote: 'The easiest "Yes" EVER! </p>

<p>'On Friday morning, on their way to the duck pond, Max asked India for her permission to ask her mummy to marry him. I love you Max - you bring out the best in me. Im so lucky (sic).' </p>

<p>In the sweet snap, Binky - real name Alexandra - passionately kissed her beau after she had accepted his proposal, which took place in a picturesque field at the Long Man of Wilmington.</p>

<p>Binky and Max, who is managing director at a global executive search and consulting firm, have been in a relationship since January 2019 after meeting at countryside private members' club Soho Farmhouse. </p>

<p>In November, the couple took the next step by buying a home together in Barnes, west London, where they live with Binky's daughter India.  </p>

<p>The reality star previously admitted the relationship is so serious that she and Max have already discussed having children in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>She told MailOnline in an interview in 2019: 'I think you always want what you are one of. I am one of three, so I've always had three in my head – girl, boy, girl.'</p>

<p>Asked whether she could see this happening with Max, Binky replied: 'I wouldn’t be mentioning it [my relationship with Max] if I didn't think it had any legs. He is really great. I am very happy.'</p>

<p>The reality star also admitted it is refreshing to be in a relationship with someone who isn't in the public eye.</p>

<p>She told MailOnline: 'He [Max] is just amazing. The first thing I told him was that I'm a mum when he asked me what I did.</p>

<p>'He is a businessman, he isn't really into being in the public eye, he just likes to get on with his own stuff.</p>

<p>'He has a firm he runs in Asia. He is very different. He has a different thing to what I have going on which is nice.</p>

<p>'He's very supportive, he gets me, he makes me laugh, we have a giggle and we take the mick out of each other.'</p>
