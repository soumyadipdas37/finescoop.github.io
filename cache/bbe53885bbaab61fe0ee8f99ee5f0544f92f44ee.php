<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Star casino's coronavirus protocols have come under scrutiny after security guards told a man with a 48C temperature to 'cool down and come back'. </p>

<p>A viral video posted by the satirical news site The Chaser, put the Sydney venue's COVID-19 screening process to the test in a comedic video.</p>

<p>The presenter artificially raised his temperature by putting a heat pack on his forehead to find out 'how sick you have to be for them not to let you gamble?'</p>

<p>But The Star have labelled the 'edited' video a 'stunt' and said it doesn't represent what really happened. </p>

<p>Scroll down the video. </p>

<p>Serious questions have been raised about The Star casino's coronavirus protocols after security guards told a man (pictured) with a temperature reading of 48C  to 'cool off'</p>

<p>A viral video posted by the satirical news site The Chaser, put the Sydney venue's COVID-19 screening process to the test in a comedic video</p>

<p>When he attempts to enter the gaming floor, guards carry out a temperature check using an infrared thermometer gun.</p>

<p>But when reading comes back at 48C, the blasé security guards tell the man to 'cool down for 10 minutes or so' and 'come back'.</p>

<p>Seemingly unconcerned by the extremely high reading - 11C above what is considered normal at 37C - a guard suggests that perhaps his 'Russian hat' is to blame for the reading. </p>

<p>The alarmingly casual approach to the screening process comes after a coronavirus-positive man visited the The Star two months earlier. </p>

<p>A gambler visited the glitzy venue on July 4 and was later found to be infected. </p>

<p>The Star was forced to undergo a massive deep clean before reopening. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the video, a Chaser presenter arrives at the casino in a hospital gown and attempts to make entry but he is refused.</p>

<p>The Star told Daily Mail Australia the 'gown stunt' was their last interaction with security officers.</p>

<p>'Clearly this has been created as a comedic and satirical stunt. It's what these guys do,' the casino said in statement.</p>

<p>'However, the video published completely misrepresents events through substantial editing and reordering of events. </p>

<p>'No one with a high temperature was permitted entry to the casino and the hospital gown episode was reported to police due to welfare concerns.</p>

<p>'Further, the claim that the person in the gown later gained entry after changing clothes is false.   </p>

<p>NSW recorded four new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday.</p>

<p>Three of the cases were returned travellers staying in hotel quarantine and one case was linked to a known cluster.</p>

<p>The patient had already been in self-isolation because they were a close contact of an infected person linked to the Concord Hospital outbreak in Sydney.</p>

<p>There are currently 136 active coronavirus cases in NSW.  </p>

<p>The Star casino in Sydney has confirmed that gambler has tested positive for coronavirus</p>
