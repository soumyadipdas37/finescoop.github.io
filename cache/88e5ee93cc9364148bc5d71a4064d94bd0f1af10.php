<p>The 43-year-old Jersey Boy is now looking at months of physical therapy to repair the nerve, tendon, and muscle damage he sustained on September 20 while tinkering with a malfunctioning pinsetter.</p>

<p>'I've reset it a hundred times. [This time] I guess I looked away, and then my hand got pinned. The metal barb pushed right through the middle of my ring finger and my middle finger. I was stuck in a machine,' Valastro recalled in the new issue of People, on newsstands Friday.</p>

<p>'It's really preliminary right now, but they're saying it's definitely going to be a long road to recovery...I have a thing with my hands. If I get a paper cut on my hand, I'm p***ed off. My hands to me are my lifeline of everything I do. And I wonder, "Am I ever going to do what I used to be able to do?"'</p>

<p>Buddy (born Bartolo) wrote on Instagram that he was 'grateful' and 'blessed' to be recovering at home beside his wife Lisa and their four children - Sofia, 17; Buddy Jr., 16; Marco, 13; and Carlo, 9.</p>

<p>'He will bake again, even if he has to use his left hand. Trust me.'</p>
