<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham will face the winner of FC Botosani or KF Shkendija if they advance to the Europa League third qualifying round. </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho's have been drawn as the away side, meaning they will be forced to travel to either Romania or Macedonia if they see off Lokomotiv Plovdiv in the second qualifying stage.</p>

<p>Spurs are already set for a trip to Bulgaria to play Ploviv on September 17 - in between Premier League games against Everton and Southampton. Now the start to their season has received further disruption ahead of possible journeys to eastern Europe.</p>

<p>Tottenham will travel to FC Botosani or KF Shkendija if they advance in the Europa League </p>

<p>FC Botosani play in the Romanian top division but have never won the league title - often finishing in mid-table. They won promotion from the second tier in 2012-13, and were in the third division as recently as 2003-04.</p>

<p>KF Shkendija, meanwhile, have won the Macedonian first division three times, their last triumph coming in 2018-19, and have won their national cup twice.</p>

<p>The tie will take place on September 24 - and will be one-legged, like their upcoming game against Plovdiv, with extra time and penalties if required. </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho could be facing two trips to eastern Europe in a blow to his plans for the season</p>

<p>Should Spurs advance, they will be facing a European trip just two days before their home game against Newcastle.</p>

<p>The north Londoners will be overwhelming favourites to overcome the challenge of Plovdiv, but the clash still comes as a huge banana skin with Mourinho desperate to secure a trophy in his first full season. </p>

<p>Tottenham looked set to seal a spot in the group stage of the competition, before bitter rivals Arsenal won the FA Cup - forcing them to contend with three gruelling qualifying rounds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Celtic will be away at Latvian side Riga or San Marino outfit Tre Fiori after dropping out of the Champions League, while Rangers will take on Luxembourg's Progres Niederkorn or Eredivisie side Willem II if they get past Lincoln Red Imps. </p>
