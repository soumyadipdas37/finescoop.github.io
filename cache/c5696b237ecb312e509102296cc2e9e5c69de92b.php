<p>The MP for Islington North tonight apologised for the incident. admitting it was a 'mistake'. </p>

<p>'I recently had dinner at a friend's house where the number of guests eventually exceeded five,' he told The Sun. </p>

<p>'I understand that remaining at the dinner was a breach of the rule of six. I apologise for my mistake.'</p>

<p>Guests at the event reportedly included left-wing activists, filmmakers and artists.</p>

<p>One guest got up from the table to take a picture of the other eight, with an unsmiling Corbyn sitting two seats away from his wife.  </p>

<p>The 'rule of six' was brought in by the government on September 14 in an attempt to control the spread of a second wave of Covid-19. </p>

<p>Those in violation of the rules face potential fines of £200 each for first-time offenders.</p>

<p>The MP for Islington North tonight apologised for the incident. admitting it was a 'mistake'</p>

<p>it is understood the dinner party took place on the same day Corbyn's older brother Piers led an anti-mask rally in Trafalgar Square. </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'It's clear that Jeremy realised immediately the danger the photo had put him in.</p>

<p>'His face says it all. He knew he shouldn't have been present and he, of all people, should know the rules.'</p>

<p>David Morris, Tory MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, described the image as 'disappointing'. </p>

<p>'Millions of Brits are quietly sticking to the rules to defeat this horrific virus while Jeremy Corbyn is swanning around at a posh ­dinner party,' he said. </p>

<p>The Rule of Six applies across England by law, meaning that gatherings should not be larger than that.</p>

<p>There are also local lockdowns in place across much of England with some 16 million Britons living under such local restrictions. </p>

<p>Britain today recorded 7,108 more coronavirus cases and another 71 deaths — including a three-month high of seven in Scotland. </p>

<p>Daily infections are up 15 per cent on last Wednesday's 6,178 and almost 80 per cent higher than on Wednesday two weeks ago. </p>

<p>But Britain's infections are a far-cry from what they were during the darkest days of the crisis in March and April, when at least 100,000 people were getting struck down every day. </p>
