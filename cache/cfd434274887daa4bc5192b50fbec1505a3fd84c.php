<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman in her 20s has revealed why she has been in self-imposed lockdown for 183 days. </p>

<p>Jazzy Regan lives with her parents, five siblings and her 84-year-old grandmother, in Sydney. </p>

<p>The whole family are concerned about infecting Ms Regan's elderly grandmother and went into strict lockdown when coronavirus swept Australia in March.</p>

<p>Ms Regan, who works with social media, was so determined not to leave her parent's house that she moved in her boyfriend.  </p>

<p>She is also worried about her own health because she suffers from severe asthma and always thinks winter will be the 'death' of her. </p>

<p>'I'm high risk and my grandma is even more high risk than I am,' she told news.com.au.    </p>

<p>Jazzy Regan, who shares a home with her boyfriend, five siblings, parents and 84-year-old grandmother, has been holed up inside since coronavirus swept Australia back in March</p>

<p>'Last year I had a chest infection three times (and was hospitalised). That's why we were so scared — if I can't even get through winter in a normal season, what would COVID-19 be like?' </p>

<p>There are only 84 active coronavirus cases in New South Wales, with just six new infections recorded across the state on Saturday.</p>

<p>Sydneysiders are living relatively 'normal' lives after successfully controlling the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>Restaurants, bars and shops are open with the implementation of COVID-19 safety protocols and the enforcement of social distancing. </p>

<p>Ms Regan is high risk to the virus as she suffers from severe asthma and allergies</p>

<p>Ms Regan's boyfriend Robbie Wilson moved in with the family in March so the couple wouldn't be separated throughout the health crisis.</p>

<p>No one in the household-of-ten left the home during lockdown and the family instead opted to get their groceries delivered.</p>

<p>But with coronavirus restrictions eventually eased and life reaching a 'new normal' in Sydney, Ms Regan's younger siblings were required to go back to school. </p>

<p>The family decided to adopt a 'shielding approach', where her siblings are segregated to their bedrooms and use a different shower and living space.</p>

<p>Ms Regan, who is known as DJ JAZZY on her social media profiles, still gets her groceries delivered and shops online. </p>

<p>It was only last month the content producer decided to leave her house to go for local strolls.  </p>

<p>Unlike most people her age, Ms Regan has enjoyed her time confined to her home. </p>

<p>'I think the fact that we are at our age (and not going out) confuses some people. My friends don't understand it at all,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Regan transformed her living room into a 'mini F45 gym' during her COVID-19 lockdown. She has even lost seven kilograms</p>

<p>The pandemic has probably been the 'best time ever' for Ms Regan - as she has learnt to cook and transformed her living room into a 'mini F45 gym'.</p>

<p>She said she has even lost seven kilograms during her self-imposed lockdown.</p>

<p>Ms Regan, a producer and singer-songwriter, has been able to work from home by pushing her career on social media.</p>

<p>She said her YouTube channels saw 'crazy' success during lockdown - which she plans to continue focusing on. </p>

<p>The pandemic has given Ms Regan the opportunity to spend time doing things she loves, rather than being distracted by the social pressure to go out all the time.  </p>
