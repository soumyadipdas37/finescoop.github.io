<p>'Best idea I've ever seen, my daughter's going to love this,' one mum said.</p>

<p>'Great idea!! I should get this! I have a lot of nail polish and I'm never able to find the right box to store them!' Another said.</p>

<p>A third said: 'Oh this is a brilliant idea! This would work well for sewing supplies as well.' </p>
