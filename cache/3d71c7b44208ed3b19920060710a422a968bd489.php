<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The recent A-level fiasco has thrown the plans of half a million students hoping to start university into chaos. But a spot of homework should still enable them to get rewards picking a bank account. </p>

<p>Fortunately, there is no need for dodgy algorithms and grade predictions when choosing a bank. </p>

<p>Young adults starting university next month are eligible for a student account that comes with benefits and interest-free overdrafts. </p>

<p>The banks are not just being nice. They know that once a bank account is set up, the customer may be hooked for life. Last year just one in 50 customers switched bank. </p>

<p>Jake Butler, a finance adviser for money savings website Save the Student, says: 'It is easy to be lured in by freebies but freshers should consider what these are worth.' </p>

<p>Do your homework: Young adults starting university next month are eligible for a student account that comes with benefits and interest-free overdrafts</p>

<p>He rates Santander as the best value for those going away to university and planning several train journeys a year to return to visit family and friends. </p>

<p>This is because Santander offers a four-year 16-25 railcard worth £30 a year. It enables students to pay a third less for off-peak train travel. The bank's '123' student account also benefits prudent students who are able to stay in the black – paying 1 per cent interest a year on balances of up to £2,000. Santander also offers an interest-free overdraft of £1,500 for the first three years, rising to £1,800 for year four, and £2,000 for any studies beyond that. </p>

<p>One of the most generous accounts for students dipping into the red often is offered by Nationwide Building Society. It provides a £1,000 interest-free overdraft for the first year, £2,000 in year two and £3,000 for years three and beyond. </p>

<p>After graduation, Nationwide's 'FlexStudent' account becomes FlexGraduate, with the interest-free overdraft limit incrementally lowered over three years – from £2,500 to £1,750 then £1,000. Exceed these limits and interest charges of 39.9 per cent a year apply. </p>

<p>HSBC offers similar limits for students, but from November the interest-free overdraft on its 'Graduate' account will start at £1,500 for the first year and drop to £1,000 for year two. Borrowing above this is also charged at 39.9 per cent. </p>

<p>NatWest offers several freebie choices and an interest-free overdraft rising to £2,000 in the final year, while Lloyds and TSB offer interest-free overdrafts that go up to £1,500. </p>

<p>Butler says: 'Banks are not loyal to customers so students should not be loyal when choosing a bank. About 40 per cent of all students opt for the bank that their parents use – for no other reason than they are simply following their lead. This is a mistake.' </p>

<p>The presence of a bank branch on campus is a consideration for those who appreciate the personal touch of speaking to someone face-to-face. But, increasingly, students do most of their banking online, often just using a phone app. </p>

<p>Among a new breed of challenger banks are online-only providers such as Monzo, Starling Bank and Atom. Save the Student says though these are useful for day-to-day budgeting, they are no substitute for a high street provider. It says having a physical bank to visit is important if a student has a problem such as an unexpected cash crisis. Andrew Hagger, of the financial research company MoneyComms, agrees, saying: 'University is a challenging time for students learning about money and a high street bank you can visit can be a life-saver. </p>

<p>'Budgeting is important because there are lots of financial constraints. Sadly, at the end of your studies, bank loans and debts will at some stage need to be paid off.' </p>

<p>Student Finance is the Government-backed organisation providing loans for day-to-day living costs and accommodation. This is usually paid into a student's bank account at the start of each term. </p>

<p>The maximum amount that can be borrowed is £7,747 for those living at home for the forthcoming academic year and £9,203 if living away from home. This rises to £12,010 if students live away from home and stay in London. </p>

<p>On top of this is a tuition fee loan of up to £9,250 a year that students must pay direct to the university. Interest is currently charged at up to 5.4 per cent a year after graduation, with graduates in England and Wales repaying loans when their annual earnings exceed £26,575.  </p>
