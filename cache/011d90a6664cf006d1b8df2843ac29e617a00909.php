<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Vanessa Bryant is accused of kicking her mother out of the house in the time following the death of Kobe Bryant.</p>

<p>Sofia Laine made the claim in an interview airing on Univision on Monday, alleging that the mother-of-four demanded the immediate return of a vehicle too.</p>

<p>'She told me, "I need you to get out of this house." She also told me that she wanted her car and she wants it now,' Laine cried to interviewer Dave Valadez on the Spanish language show 'El Gorda y La Flaca.' </p>

<p>She told me, "I need you to get out of this house," Sofia Laine said in an interview for Univision's 'El Gorda y La Flaca' airing on Monday</p>

<p>Laine (left next to Gianna Bryant) was last pictured with Vanessa in a Thanksgiving family photo posted on Kobe's Instagram</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant, 41, and his 13-year-old daughter died in a Calabasas, California helicopter crash along with several other passengers and a pilot in January. </p>

<p>It's unclear from the preview released this weekend what might have happened between the mother and daughter to cause the apparent rift.</p>

<p>Laine was last pictured with Vanessa in a Thanksgiving family photo that was posted on Kobe's Instagram account last November.</p>

<p>The family owns multiple properties on the Newport Coast and Sofia used to live in one until it was sold in 2013.</p>

<p>After the basketball legend's death, a source told Us Weekly that Laine was helping Vanessa and her grandchildren - Natalia, 17, Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months.</p>

<p>'[Vanessa] is incredibly close to her mom and her mom has been her rock throughout the past few weeks,' the insider said.</p>

<p>'Her mom is always with her and the girls and she's been keeping Vanessa strong and she's the weight of her support system.'</p>

<p>The grandmother added: 'She also told me that she wanted her car and she wants it now'</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna Bryant attend a basketball game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Atlanta Hawks at Staples Center on November 17, 2019. They both died in the helicopter crash in January 2020</p>

<p>Laine also appeared to be very close to Kobe and was waiting outside his locker room in 2015 after he played his last game.</p>

<p>Their relationship may have been even more special Kobe admitted he didn't get along with his own parents.</p>

<p>It's not clear how Vanessa and her mother's relationship was at Kobe's memorial in February. Singer Beyonce was seen comforting the widow at the LA Lakers' home of the Staples Center in Los Angeles during the service.</p>

<p>It's unclear where Laine – who also has a daughter named Sophie Laine - could be living now.</p>

<p>The grandmother divorced Vanessa's stepfather in 2003 after 13 years of marriage on claims that he cheated. He denied the claims.</p>

<p>In 2011 when Vanessa and Kobe almost split over infidelity matters, Vanessa's estranged stepfather – whose last name she took as a child – compared her to her mother.</p>

<p>'Her mother taught her well to wait for the 10-year mark,' Stephen Laine said about their 10-year union. </p>

<p>'In California, it's considered a long term marriage and then she gets paid for life or until she remarries … just like her mother is doing to me. I have to pay her mom $1,800 every month and clearly, they don't need it.'</p>
