<p>Russian police are searching for 41-year-old Vitaly Molchanov (left and right) after he went on the run following the murder of Valentina Saprunova's two daughters</p>

<p>But reports say she was unaware of his past as a child murderer and sex attacker for which he had been jailed for almost a decade.</p>

<p>He had told her he was wrongly convicted but not admitted the seriousness of the offences.</p>

<p>The mother got home from a long hospital shift to find the bloodbath in Molchanov's flat which they had moved into only a month earlier hoping for a new start.</p>

<p>She is now in the care of a police psychologist too distraught even to talk to her family.</p>

<p>Neighbours said that the couple had appeared 'madly in love'.</p>

<p>Saprunova's daughter Yana is pictured at a younger age. Saprunova, 40, came home from work and found her daughters 'literally shredded' by a knife</p>

<p>They were often seen holding hands and jogging together or riding bicycles.</p>

<p>After walking out of his block of flats, he was reported to have made away on a white bike.</p>

<p>His previous 2010 conviction included murder, rape and desecration of the dead.</p>

<p>He was also described as a 'convicted paedophile'.</p>

<p>The governor of Yaroslavl region. Dmitry Mironov has offered a £5,000 reward for information leading to Molchanov's detention.</p>

<p>Russia's children ombudsman Anna Kuznetsova called the killings 'inhuman'.</p>

<p>'No words to describe,' she said.</p>

<p>'A terrible crime.</p>

<p>'The perpetrator of this atrocity has not yet been found.</p>

<p>'It is known that he was previously convicted of the rape and murder of a child.</p>

<p>'Now two more girls have become victims.'</p>

<p>She demanded more action from the Kremlin to tackle paedeophiles including a register and 'supervision' for child sex attackers.</p>

<p>She has previously pleaded for paedophiles to be tagged for life and banned from using the internet.</p>

<p>'Children are dying, let's take these or other measures to protect children,' she said.</p>

<p>Valentina uprooted with her daughters from Siberia to move into her new boyfriend's flat, convinced she had found true love.</p>

<p>The Russian Investigative Committee has opened a criminal case into a double child rape and murder 'committed with extreme cruelty'.</p>

<p>Molchanov (pictured with the mother of his victims), 41, had prior convictions for child rape and murder and was released from a long prison sentence in 2010, according to reports </p>

<p>The nurse had met Molchanov online via a dating app around six months ago, say Russian reports citing law enforcement.</p>

<p>In one posting in April, before they were together, he wrote: 'This is my girlfriend, this is very sad that we are in different cities, but I love her and we can solve all the other issues.'</p>

<p>Sources said that Molchanov had become angered and 'jealous' that her job involved 24 hour shifts from which she often came back late.</p>

<p>A neighbour said: 'This woman came to look for happiness in Rybinsk.</p>

<p>'I feel so sorry for her and the girls. He is a beast.</p>

<p>'He must be destroyed immediately.'</p>

<p>The dead children's father was revealed to be a retired police major Valentin Suprunov, a former senior criminal investigator.</p>

<p>The divorced couple have an older son, Sergey, now 19.</p>

<p>He told journalists that if he had known she was in a relationship with a convicted killer, he would have taken the children away.</p>
