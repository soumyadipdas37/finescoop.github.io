<p>But on Wednesday, Tristan MacManus admitted his role has been 'a bit difficult to get used to' because he'd been working as a landscaper before landing the TV gig. </p>

<p>Speaking on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O show, the Irish dancer, 38, said: 'It's been a bit difficult to get used to. It's not like I have a point to reference.'</p>

<p>'Now I have a suit on!' New studio 10 host Tristan MacManus (pictured) has revealed he'd been working as a landscape labourer months before landing his role on the breakfast show</p>

<p>'I'd been breaking my a** for the last couple months landscaping when my work got cancelled,' he added.</p>

<p>'I was labouring and now I have a suit on and I'm getting paid well,' he said.</p>

<p>Tristan was a judge on Channel 10's Dancing with the Stars but filming for the show ended in March and he started working as a labourer.</p>

<p>The Irish co-host made his debut on Studio 10 last Monday, less than one week after former co-host Joe Hildebrand revealed that he'll be leaving the show.</p>

<p>Joe's position on the morning talk show had been up in the air ever since Channel 10 announced its latest round of redundancies last month.</p>

<p>But many viewers have criticised the revamped version and are now calling for Joe, 44, to return to breakfast program alongside Sarah.</p>

<p>'I think this is the death of Studio 10. I don't find that MacManus bloke very appealing it's actually very boring,' one person tweeted. </p>

<p>'I'm not watching Studio 10 without Joe,' another commented. 'Joe we need you back on Studio 10 pronto,' another person agreed.</p>

<p>'Today's #Studio10 was like trying on a new pair of shoes for the first time. It will take a bit of wearing in before I decide if I like them or not,' one person said.</p>

<p>Ten also reportedly made the decision to disable comments on the show's Instagram account after viewers criticised the new format.</p>

<p>According to TV Blackbox, hundreds of negative comments have been deleted from the show's Instagram and Facebook pages.</p>
