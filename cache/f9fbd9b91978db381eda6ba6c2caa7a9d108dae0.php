'My beautiful stomach held 4 healthy children, and those stretch marks remind me every day of how powerful my body is and how much mothers endure during pregnancy. </p>

<p>'I won't airbrush my body to perfection so you see a fake version of me or an unrealistic picture of a mother. I love myself and I know that beauty is found in our imperfections.' </p>

<p>'I learned really creative ways to satisfy hunger without eating. I got very, very, thin and I became so scared of putting and weight back on. I got myself caught up in it all, in these habits that were incredibly unhealthy. And they stuck with me for the next 10 years.' </p>
