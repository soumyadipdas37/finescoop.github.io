<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar has reportedly agreed to join Arsenal.</p>

<p>According to Telefoot, the highly regarded Frenchman wants to join the Gunners despite interest from Barcelona and Juventus, with neither of those clubs having made a concrete bid.</p>

<p>Arsenal have held further talks with Lyon over a deal for Aouar.</p>

<p>Highly regarded Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar has reportedly agreed to join Arsenal </p>

<p>An offer is understood to have been put forward on Thursday with negotiations ongoing.</p>

<p>Arsenal still have to strike a deal with Lyon, who are reportedly demanding £54million for Aouar.</p>

<p>If Arsenal are able to bring in the 22-year-old it would provide Mikel Arteta's side with some much-needed creativity.</p>

<p>Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas is typically tough to negotiate with, so it is unlikely that Arsenal will face a straightforward task as they look to sign Aouar before the transfer window closes on October 5.</p>

<p>Lyon president Jean-MIchel Aulas believes Arsenal don't have the funds required to sign Aouar</p>

<p>The French club are demanding a fee of £54million for the hugely talented 22-year-old</p>

<p>Aulas suggested that at present Arsenal don't have the required funds to secure a deal for Aouar.</p>

<p>'Financially, Arsenal are like everyone else (in a tricky spot),' Aulas was quoted as saying in the French publication, Le Progres. 'And Houssem could say to himself that the best thing would be to stay with us.' </p>

<p>Aulas is determined to keep Aouar along with Moussa Dembele and Memphis Depay, who have also been linked with moves away.</p>

<p>Aulas said: 'From the start I said that we would not lose the three players announced every day in the newspapers.' </p>

<p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is determined to sign Aouar to boost his side's creativity</p>

<p>Aouar, a France Under-21 international, has spent his entire career to date at Lyon, making over 130 appearances for the club.</p>

<p>Arsenal have improved immensely under Arteta but they are certainly in need of a player who can create chances with regularity, especially with Mesut Ozil having been frozen out.</p>

<p>In addition to Aouar, Arsenal have been looking to bring in a more defensive-minded midfielder in Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey.</p>

<p>So far in this transfer window Arsenal have secured deals for Willian, Gabriel and Alex Runarsson. </p>
