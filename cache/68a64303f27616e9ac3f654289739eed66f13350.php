<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Harry Maguire made a personal attempt to convince Gareth Southgate to recall him to the England squad after his successful appeal against his conviction, according to reports.</p>

<p>It has been claimed the 27-year-old called the Three Lions boss in a late bid to change his mind after being removed from the group that will face Iceland and Denmark in the Nations League. </p>

<p>But The Sun report that Southgate ultimately decided against shuffling his pack once again and chose to side with unsure FA chiefs. </p>

<p>Harry Maguire attempted to convince Gareth Southgate to recall him to the England squad</p>

<p>Southgate had removed Maguire from the group after the defender's guilty verdict in Greece</p>

<p>Southgate is even believed to have been approached by members of his own coaching staff, who asked to reinstate Maguire ahead of Saturday's clash in Reykjavik.</p>

<p>There were figures at the FA, however, who remained steadfast in their belief that the Manchester United captain should remain out of the spotlight after the drama that unfolded on the Greek island of Mykonos.  </p>

<p>Despite the attempt from Maguire, Southgate opted against bringing the defender back into the fold and believes he would benefit from clearing his head before United begin the new campaign. </p>

<p>Members of Southgate's coaching staff are also said to have wanted Maguire to be recalled</p>

<p>Maguire had been found guilty of aggravated assault, bribery and resisting arrest in Mykonos</p>

<p>Maguire was found guilty of aggravated assault, bribery and resisting arrest while on holiday last month, and Southgate was forced into a U-turn after naming the star in his initial squad before news of his conviction surfaced. </p>

<p>On the same evening, Maguire had been axed from the squad. However, the player was soon granted an appeal - although he may be forced to wait for up to two years due to a supposed backlog of legal cases in Greece.</p>

<p>There were reportedly members of Southgate's inner circle who backed Maguire's appeal to the coach, citing their concerns over a lack of defensive depth.  </p>

<p>Sportsmail reported previously that Maguire is likely to be recalled for next month's fixtures against Wales, Belgium and Denmark. </p>

<p>Maguire is now considered innocent after his successful appeal against the 21-month suspended prison sentence originally imposed.</p>

<p>After his successful appeal against the verdict, Maguire called Southgate for a change of heart</p>
