<p>Brisbane couple Denise and Darryl Blight agreed to pay $3,000 when tradesmen offered to replace their dirt driveway with a bitumen one.</p>

<p>When the job was completed, not only did the tradesmen leave their mess behind but they also did such a shoddy job that pieces of carpet, tree roots and bare earth showed through the uneven surface.</p>

<p>The tradesmen then demanded $12,000 for their dodgy work, which they disguised by parking a truck over the worst bits of the driveway. </p>

<p>'We've waited 34 years for a driveway so I was happy,' Ms Blight told Quest Newspapers.</p>

<p>'When the bobcat turned up, it went crazy and was doing wheel stands it was working so quickly.'</p>

<p>A retired self-employed carpenter, Mr Blight insists on quotes but had been preoccupied with his recent battle with kidney cancer while his wife, 73, suffers from epilepsy.</p>

<p>After the couple negotiated the price down to $8,000, Mrs Blight mistakenly put in the wrong bank account details and the money was not transferred.</p>

<p>They told their daughter-in-law about the dodgy work, who alerted police and the Office of Fair Trading, which has since described the tradesmen's conduct as despicable.</p>

<p>The couple arranged a time with the tradesmen to return to their home be paid but they didn't show up, instead later sending an email demanding payment.</p>

<p>Under Queensland fair trading laws, door-to-door traders must give consumers a 10-day cooling off period and cannot start work or accept payment during that period.</p>

<p>Consumers can cancel any agreement within this period without penalty and can request a free 'Do-not-Knock' sticker from the Office of Fair Trading. </p>

<p>The Office of Fair Trading received 10 reports about bitumen bandits in 2019.</p>

<p>Consumers can lodge a complaint by calling 13 74 68 or log onto qld.gov.au/fairtrading. </p>
