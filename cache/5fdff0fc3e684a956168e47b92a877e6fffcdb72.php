<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>All bars, cafés and restaurants are to shut down in France's second city because of the worsening Coronavirus pandemic, the country's Health Secretary said tonight.</p>

<p>The closures in Marseille - which start on Monday - were announced by Olivier Véran on Wednesday as part of a nationwide series of tough new measures.</p>

<p>They also include bars in Paris, Lille and Grenoble having to shut at 10pm from Monday, while gatherings of more than 10 people will also be banned.</p>

<p>An even earlier closure of bars can also be sanctioned by local prefects, said Mr Véran.</p>

<p>A lowering of the number of people allowed to attend sports and cultural events from 5,000 to 1,000, and a temporary ban on renting party venues, including for weddings, were also announced.</p>

<p>The closures in Marseille (pictured) - which start on Monday - were announced by Olivier Véran on Wednesday as part of a nationwide series of tough new measures</p>

<p>'The Greater Paris health system is now strongly under strain' said Mr Véran, during a press conference broadcast live.</p>

<p>'The number of hospitalised patients within the region is increasing very rapidly. There are nearly 1,000 hospitalisations for Coronavirus over the last seven days, against 460 the previous week. A doubling.'</p>

<p>The total shut down of bars, cafés and restaurants in Marseille will last for a minimum of two weeks to begin with, and will be reviewed after that.</p>

<p>It will mean many businesses facing ruin, especially if the closures turn into rolling ones.</p>

<p>The total shut down of bars, cafés and restaurants will also be introduced in the French overseas territories of Guadeloupe, in the Caribbean.</p>

<p>'The Greater Paris health system is now strongly under strain' said Mr Véran (pictured), during a press conference</p>

<p>Mr Veran said the new measures were 'not aimed at scaring people too much, but it is to tell you that there is still time to act.</p>

<p>'The measures we are taking aim to make this curve flat, or rather to get off the path we're on, so as to protect our hospitals and intensive care units.</p>

<p>'If we do not take action quickly, we risk reaching a critical situation in some of the most affected areas in a matter of weeks.'</p>

<p>It followed ministers in Paris holding a series of crisis meetings to analyse the latest surge, which saw more than 10,000 cases and 78 deaths recorded in France on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The incidence rate of infection has risen to 204 per 100,000 inhabitants in the greater Paris area.</p>

<p>Mask wearing is already mandatory in public places in France, but there have been concerns about people flouting social distancing advice.</p>

<p>Young people have in particular been criticised for gathering in large groups, often without masks, at bars and cafés in the capital.</p>

<p>With more than 460,000 confirmed cases and over 31,400 deaths to date, concern is growing about hospital capacity to handle a second wave.</p>

<p>Admissions have started to rise again after being contained during France's lockdown between March and May.</p>

<p>Paris is set to be hit with new lockdown measures today that will ban gatherings of more than 10 people, along with alcohol consumption in public places after 8pm</p>

<p>France, Spain and the UK are all seeing spiking Covid cases - but only the UK has imposed new national measures, while France and Spain have used more-relaxed local lockdowns</p>

<p>The developments in France follow Prime Minister Boris Johnson introducing new restrictive measures in Britain.</p>

<p>The new rules mark a major step backwards for the French capital, but are more relaxed than those brought in by this week by the UK - which has banned gatherings larger than six across the country, and ordered all pubs to close by 10pm.</p>

<p>That is despite France having more than double the UK's daily coronavirus cases, based on a seven-day rolling average.</p>

<p>France, Spain and the UK are bearing the brunt of a second wave of coronavirus cases in Europe, which comes after countries across the continent eased lockdown.</p>

<p>Until this week, all three countries had been dealing with problem using local lockdowns, targeted at areas where cases were rising fastest.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday the UK suddenly broke ranks with a raft of new nationwide measures, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said will last for the next six months.</p>

<p>In addition to cutting the size of gatherings and closing pubs early, he also urged workers to return to working from home - despite an earlier drive to get people back into offices - and banned indoor team sports.</p>

<p>He also increased fines for rule-breakers, and made the army available to help police enforce the measures.</p>

<p>That is not the case in Spain or France, where both countries have resisted imposing new nation-wide measures on focused on local lockdowns.</p>

<p>Parts of Madrid have been plunged back into full lockdown as coroanvirus cases in Spain have soared, but most of the city is still allowed to move around freely</p>

<p>UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted the new nationwide measures will need to remain in in place for the next six months to keep infections down over winter </p>

<p>In Spain, parts of Madrid with rapidly rising infections have been thrown back into full lockdown, with authorities calling on the army to help enforce the rules.</p>

<p>The remaining 6.6million residents have been encouraged to say indoors, though are not required to do so - yet. New measures are due to be announced next week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Catalonia, where Barcelona is located, has also announced bans on gatherings larger than six people.</p>

<p>Spain saw 11,300 new cases of coroanvirus on Tuesday this week, based on a rolling seven-day average. </p>

<p>In France, the cities of Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, and Nice had all already been hit with tougher new lockdown measures, though country-wide restrictions have remained the same.</p>

<p>Measures include no drinking in public places after 8pm, all bars to close by midnight, and the size of gatherings cut.</p>

<p>Masks are already compulsory across France in all indoor spaces, though many cities have made them compulsory outdoors as well.</p>

<p>France reported 10,155 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, based on a seven-day rolling average. The figure for the UK was 3,928.</p>
