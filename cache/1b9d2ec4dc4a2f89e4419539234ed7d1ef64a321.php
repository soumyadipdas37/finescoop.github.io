<p>A British woman was killed after being hit by a boat propeller off Avlaki beach today (file photo) off the coast of the Greek holiday island of Corfu </p>

<p>The 60-year-old British woman was swimming off the coast of Corfu when a speedboat captain allegedly failed to spot her in time </p>

<p>There were thought to be numerous speedboats in the area and the local port authority is investigating the woman's death.  </p>

<p>The woman's body pulled from the sea shortly before 10am and taken to Corfu General Hospital. An autopsy is expected tomorrow, according to I Efimerida. </p>

<p>The British woman's name has not been revealed, but her husband and eldest daughter have been informed of her death. </p>

<p>She was described as a resident of Corfu for most of the year who was 'very popular in the local community', according to public broadcaster ERT.   </p>

<p>Some reports described her as a permanent resident of Corfu, but others said she was on holiday on the island. </p>

<p>UK tourists have been returning to Greece in recent weeks after travel restrictions were lifted. </p>

<p>Greece is one of the 'travel corridor' countries where tourists can go without having to quarantine for two weeks when they return to Britain. </p>

<p>However, an increase in coronavirus cases in recent weeks has pushed it closer to the threshold of 20 cases per 100,000 in a week at which the UK is likely to re-impose quarantine rules. </p>

<p>The current figure is 14.1, after nearly 1,500 new cases were reported in the last seven days.   </p>

<p>Greece needs tourism to revive an economy still grappling with the aftermath of a depression that wiped out a quarter of its economy. </p>

<p>New local restrictions have been imposed in tourist hotspots such as Mykonos to curb the spread of the virus, including a midnight curfew for bars, restaurants and cafes and a ban on large gatherings.  </p>
