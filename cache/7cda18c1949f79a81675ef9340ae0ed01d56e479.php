<p>A World War II submachine gun is among dozens of illegal firearms seized by police in Tasmania as part of a crackdown on firearm trafficking</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Damien George said the machine gun find was 'most troubling'.</p>

<p>'The individual in question had gone to a reasonable effort to conceal that weapon,' he told reporters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The guns were uncovered with the help of a specialist sniffer dog.</p>

<p>A 57-year-old man from Richmond, near Hobart, has also been charged with illegal gun trafficking.</p>

<p>It is alleged he had been operating as a licensed firearms dealer.</p>

<p>Police have seized some 40 guns since the operation began in May.</p>

<p>The two men are expected to face court in early 2021.</p>
