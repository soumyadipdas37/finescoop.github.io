<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Josh Taylor, having fretted through his 11-month absence from the ring, needed only 161 seconds to reassert his domination over world super-lightweight boxing.</p>

<p>The Tartan Tornado he surely is, this exceptional fighter from Prestonpans.</p>

<p>Apinum Khongsong, the Thai challenger for Taylor’s two unified world titles, crumpled into a heap the first time he was hit to his slender body in a venue fabled for extraordinary happenings.</p>

<p>Josh Taylor knocked out Apinun Khongsong in an incredible first round on Saturday night</p>

<p>The Scot threw a devastating left-hand body shot to send his opponent down in 161 seconds</p>

<p>This night will rank among the more bewildering in the storied history of East London’s York Hall.</p>

<p>Khongsong spent five times longer writhing on the canvas than the two minutes and 41 seconds it took Taylor to plant that devastating left beneath his ribs.</p>

<p>Even after all that medical attention Taylor’s victim had to be wheeled out of the echoing, Covid secure emptiness of the arena on a stretcher.</p>

<p>While he waited, Taylor took a quiet, courteous bow.</p>

<p>Taylor moves closer to a world unification fight with WBO and WBC champion Jose Ramirez</p>

<p>Khonsong is unusually tall for this division and that gangly frame had been reputed to give him the leverage for all the knock outs on his record.</p>

<p>But that frame proved to be a fatal flaw. He was not possessed of the shock absorbers to withstand even one of Taylor’s precision power punches.</p>

<p>Taylor could have done with a few rounds but will still head on to even greater things next year. Hopefully with his tartan army in attendance.</p>

<p>Jose Ramirez, his rival world champion, has been warned.</p>
