<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The night after TV weatherman Steve Jacobs' ex-wife Rosie was dumped by her latest boyfriend she demanded he return the key to her apartment. </p>

<p>'Please be advised that I want my house key returned to me immediately,' the 41-year-old wrote to retired AFL player Matt Shir in an email sent at 6.40pm on January 10.</p>

<p>One minute later, Jacobs sent a second email to Shir explaining why she needed the key back, and about six hours after that he forced his way into her home.</p>

<p>Shir, who Jacobs called 'Ragnar' after legendary Viking hero Ragnar Lodbrok, told police he had gone to her apartment because he was concerned for her welfare after their split. </p>

<p>Rosie Jacobs was in a tumultuous relationship with former AFL footballer Matt Shir after her split with TV weatherman husband Steve Jacobs in 2018. Shir walked out on Jacobs in January and the next night when he came to her apartment she called police. The couple is pictured </p>

<p>Jacobs hooked up with Shir months after her separation from husband Steve and the couple lived together in her apartment at Bronte. The relationship deteriorated in the second half of last year. The couple is pictured at Bronte on Christmas Day, 2018 with one of her daughters</p>

<p>Rosie and Steve Jacobs met on the set of Today, where she was a producer, and married in Bali in May 2010. She announced their separation in March 2018. Rosie later described the marriage as 'unhappy' </p>

<p>Jacobs, who said she feared for her safety, claimed 39-year-old Shir later contacted her ex-husband and made 'a number of assertions' about her parenting skills.   </p>

<p>Details of the couple's tumultuous relationship can be revealed after Shir admitted assaulting Jacobs in her $1.56million home at Bronte in Sydney's eastern suburbs.</p>

<p>'There were reciprocal allegations of the other's mental health state, alcohol addiction and infidelity,' a statement of facts tendered to Downing Centre Local Court said.</p>

<p>'[Shir] was verbally abusive towards [Jacobs] and would sometimes call her "b<strong>ch" or "c</strong>t".'</p>

<p>Jacobs announced the split with her husband, with whom she has two daughters, in March 2018 and had a brief fling with Canadian ex-commando Dylan Nash. </p>

<p>Shir, who Jacobs called 'Ragnar' after the Viking hero Ragnar Lodbrok, told police he had gone to her apartment on night in January because he was concerned for her welfare after their split. The couple is pictured at Bronte on Christmas Day in 2018</p>

<p>'There were reciprocal allegations of the other's mental health state, alcohol addiction and infidelity,' a statement of facts tendered to Downing Centre Local Court said. '[Shir] was verbally abusive towards [Jacobs] and would sometimes call her "b<strong>ch" or "c</strong>t"'</p>

<p>Shir was with Jacobs by October 2018 and moved into her apartment but their relationship deteriorated in the second half of last year.</p>

<p>While Shir had moved out of the flat by the middle of 2019 he still stayed over on occasion, usually coming in through the balcony, although he retained a house key.</p>

<p>One night late last year Shir entered the apartment via the balcony while Jacobs was in bed with her two daughters and not expecting a visitor.</p>

<p>Shir, who according to the statement of facts had been out drinking, cut his hand while climbing in and smeared blood on the walls. </p>

<p>On January 9, the pair 'officially' separated at Shir's suggestion and the next night Jacobs asked him to return the key to her apartment. </p>

<p>Later that night Jacobs got into bed with her phone after securing all entry points to the second floor flat, including locking and latching the front door. </p>

<p>Shir arrived shortly after midnight and tried to open the front door with his key but could not get past the latch and began calling out, 'Rose'.</p>

<p>Shortly after Rosie split from Steve she began seeing Canadian ex-commando Dylan Nash but within months had moved on with retired AFL footballer Matt Shir by October 2018. Jacobs and Nash are pictured</p>

<p>Shir played 11 games for the Adelaide Crows in 2001-2002. He is pictured right tackling St Kilda player Lenny Hayes at Football Park in Adelaide on February 24, 2002</p>

<p>'[Jacobs] heard [Shir] but did not want to see him so she did not reply,' the statement of facts said. 'She made no noise and kept the lights off in the hope that he would just go away.'</p>

<p>Shir went downstairs, climbed up a screen fence, damaging the structure, and jumped over Jacobs' balcony.</p>

<p>'[Shir] called out over and over saying, "Rose, let me in!",' according to the statement of facts. '[Jacobs] remained silent hoping he would just go away.'</p>

<p>The former footballer, who played 11 games for the Adelaide Crows in 2001-2002, tried to open a window then gained access through a rear sliding door with a faulty lock. </p>

<p>He went into Jacobs's bedroom, took off his shirt and got into bed with her. Jacobs sat up, told Shir to leave and asked for her key to be returned.</p>

<p>Shir drew Jacobs into an embrace as she repeatedly told him he was not welcome and he tried to pull her into a hugging position.</p>

<p>Rosie, 41, recently chopped and dyed blonde her brunette locks (pictured) and has a new corporate hosting gig with financial services company Adviser Ratings</p>

<p>Rosie and Steve Jacobs met on the set of Today, where she was a producer, and married in Bali in May 2010. She announced their separation in March 2018. </p>

<p>The couple had moved to Vanuatu in mid-2017, in what friends described as a 'last-ditch attempt' to save their marriage. They have two daughters: Isabella, nine, and seven-year-old Francesca. </p>

<p>The couple sold their matrimonial home at Coogee in Sydney's eastern suburbs for $4.6million in April 2018 and Rosie bought a two-bedroom apartment at nearby Bronte for $1.56million in November that year. </p>

<p>The same month Steve told WHO magazine he had been dealt a few 'curve balls' since his separation from Rosie.  </p>

<p>Shortly after Rosie split from Steve she began seeing Canadian ex-commando Dylan Nash but had moved on with retired AFL footballer Matt Shir by October 2018.</p>

<p>In February 2019 Jacobs celebrated her 40th birthday with Shir, who had moved into her Bronte apartment, in Bali. In June that year she wrote about her marriage breakdown in an article for Whimn.</p>

<p>'Two years ago I decided to leave my unhappy marriage, after years of trying desperately to make it work,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'As a result of this separation, I've experienced plenty of anxiety and depression, often blaming and questioning myself.'</p>

<p>Steve, 53, left his role as Today weatherman last December and has been presenting a breakfast radio program this year. </p>

<p>Rosie, 41, who recently chopped and dyed blonde her brunette locks, has a new corporate hosting gig with Adviser Ratings, a company which helps people find qualified financial advice.</p>

<p>Jacobs eventually freed herself from Shir and warned he was on his 'last chance' before she called her neighbour downstairs.</p>

<p>'[Shir] followed her into the living area where [he] used his body to herd and corner her against the wall so that she could not move,' the statement of facts said.</p>

<p>'He tried to kiss and bear hug her while she kept asking him to leave, moving his face towards [her] face.'</p>

<p>Shir said: 'I just want to be in bed with you. I'll be in bed with you tonight. I'll leave tomorrow, I swear.'</p>

<p>Jacobs replied: 'I will punch you in the face if you don't let me down.'</p>

<p>She then called her neighbour who came to the apartment but Shir would still not go home. Jacobs rang the police from her bathroom and Shir finally left saying, 'I'm out of here'.</p>

<p>'The victim felt intimidated, scared, unsafe and physically threatened,' the statement of facts said.  </p>

<p>Shir was originally charged with stalking/intimidation with intent to cause fear and aggravated break and enter but after representations to police by his solicitor Greg Goold those charges were withdrawn. The couple is pictured</p>

<p>'The victim in no way contacted the offender in any form to suggest she was in a suicidal state or that she was feeling miserable.</p>

<p>'Nor had the victim received any communication from the offender. The victim had not consumed any alcohol or drugs on the day or night of the incident.'</p>

<p>Since the incident Shir had still not returned the apartment key and Jacobs had changed the lock on her front door.</p>

<p>'[Jacobs] has also heard that [Shir] contacted her ex-husband and made a number of assertions about her parenting skills,' the statement of facts said. </p>

<p>Shir was arrested at his then Bondi home about 2.30am and told police he had gone to Jacobs' apartment because he was concerned for her welfare.</p>

<p>'She's like, "Get the f*** out of the house",' he told police. 'I'm going, "What do you mean? I want to stay, I just want to stay here the night.'</p>

<p>Shir told police he had drunk eight to ten beers after work and that going to Jacobs' apartment after midnight was 'probably not the ideal time'.</p>

<p>'He is not a doctor, nurse or trained in mental health and accepts that ringing the police of ambulance would have been more appropriate,' the statement of facts said.</p>

<p>'He agreed that it could have been quite frightening for the victim.'</p>

<p>Shir, who was guarantor for Jacobs' mortgage on the apartment, also believed he had a right to enter the premises. </p>

<p>'He says he's done this "plenty of times",' the statement of facts said.</p>

<p>'They were talking about last night and then all of a sudden he's a c**t for leaving her last night.'</p>

<p>Shir was originally charged with stalking/intimidation with intent to cause fear and aggravated break and enter but after representations to police by his solicitor Greg Goold those matters were withdrawn. </p>

<p>He pleaded guilty earlier this month to damaging property - the fence - and common assault. Shir will be sentenced on October 8.</p>
