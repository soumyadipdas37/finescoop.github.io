<p>The former Gogglebox star, who turns 30 on October 17, was forced to cancel her bigger bash for next month and opted for a gathering at home with '10 people' instead.</p>

<p>Still managing to make the most out of the situation, the 2016 I'm A Celebrity winner marked the occasion with an epic picnic, karaoke with her loved ones and even a silent disco in the garden.</p>

<p>There's no stopping her! Scarlett Moffatt let her hair down as she threw an early birthday party due to England's imminent 'six person rule' on Saturday</p>

<p>The presenter addressed why she decided to celebrate her birthday over a month early to her social media followers as she said: 'So I have noticed I'm wearing different outfits. </p>

<p>'Despite having a party of 10 people, I still got changed three times. You only turn 30 once I suppose.</p>

<p>'It's not my 30th until October 17, but change of plans with only having six people meant that my birthday celebrations were cancelled.</p>

<p>'So I feel anyone's pain who was going to get married or have an event as it's a bit s****y but we've got to follow the rules and make sure we're keeping ourselves safe. I'm hungover now!'</p>

<p>Milestone: The former Gogglebox star, who turns 30 on October 17, marked the occasion with an epic picnic, karaoke with her loved ones and even a silent disco in the garden</p>

<p>'It's s****y': The media personality was forced to cancel her bigger bash for next month and opted for a gathering at home with '10 people' instead</p>

<p>Fancy: The Newcastle native's outdoor area was decorated with a chic teepee design, a vibrant balloon arch and comfy cushions for her guests</p>

<p>'Absolutely loved life': Holding onto a glass of wine, the birthday girl appeared in great spirits as she boogied to music through her headphones</p>

<p>Having fun: The brunette posed with a unicorn balloon as she let loose throughout her modest celebrations</p>

<p>'We made the most of it': The host sang and danced to lively music with her nearest and dearest</p>

<p>'You only turn 30 once!' The presenter stunned in a bedazzled cardigan, a black T-shirt and ankle-grazing jeans to mark her third outfit of the day</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, the TV star admitted her anxiety is at a high as the new COVID-19 restrictions ruined her plans.</p>

<p>Taking to her Instagram Stories, Scarlett confessed: 'My anxiety is so bad now because of this news. Anyone else feel like living in another country for a year.  </p>

<p>'So they told us to go out and do help out to eat out. Now they're saying we have to stay in! What is happening man! 30th birthday plans ruined, wish corona would just F**K OFF NOW.</p>

<p>Impressive: Her boyfriend Scott Dobinson even managed to set up a personalised mini bar at their home</p>

<p>Snacks: Chocolate cupcakes, fruits and cheese were presented to guests </p>

<p>'I know I like to spread positivity, but I can't lie to you all, I've never felt so crap in my life. Boris announcement has seriously knocked me. Hope you're all ok.</p>

<p>'And to those who are feeling like me and are struggling, don't feel ashamed about it. What's happening is strange and crap. It's a natural reaction.</p>

<p>'Also side note - the fact all my 30th birthday plans have been cancelled means I can stay 29 for another year?' (sic)</p>

<p>From Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'. </p>

<p>Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200.  </p>

<p>The law has been different to the official 'guidance' since July 4, which has been a source of confusion among some. Now, official rules are closer - yet not entirely in sync - with the state's advice. </p>
