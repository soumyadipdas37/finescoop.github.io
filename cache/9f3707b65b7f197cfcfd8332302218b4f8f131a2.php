<p>Toshka spent most of his life as a circus animal performing tricks for audiences but was recently taken to a sanctuary in Satanov, Ukraine, for 'rehabilitation and life support'.</p>

<p>In the 2-minute clip, taken on August 26, the bear sits happily in a patch of sun at the edge of trees and bushes.</p>

<p>Toshka spent most of his life as a circus animal performing tricks for audiences but was recently taken to a sanctuary in Satanov, Ukraine, for 'rehabilitation and life support'</p>

<p>Temperatures in the Ukraine can get as high as 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35C) so the cold water was a welcome relief for the bear - which has two coats of fur to protect it from cold weather.</p>

<p>Toshka regularly enjoys showers in the sun, according to his caretaker, who said it was his 'favourite pastime'.</p>

<p>Toshka regularly enjoys showers in the sun, according to his caretaker, who said it was his 'favourite pastime'</p>

<p>They said Toshka was so afraid of humans after his horrific ordeal in the circus he refused to leave the bushes for 14 days. </p>

<p>'A month ago, we transported him and 3 other bears. Toshka was very afraid of people: he didn't leave the bushes for 2 weeks,' they added.</p>

<p>'Care and attention melted his heart. Now his favorite pastime is to shower in the sun. He takes a sitting position and is ready to sit for hours.' </p>
