<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sacha Baron Cohen went for an extremely risqué poster for the upcoming Borat 2 movie, ahead of its release on October 23 on Amazon Prime. </p>

<p>In a nod to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Sacha, 48, donned a face covering in place of the character's now-iconic, neon green mankini. </p>

<p>The highly-anticipated sequel to the actor's wildly successful 2006 comedy Borat, will premiere on Amazon after bosses bought the worldwide rights to the film and the new poster boasts the slogan: 'Wear mask. Save live'.  </p>

<p>Ahem! Sacha Baron Cohen went for an extremely risqué poster (pictured) for the upcoming Borat 2 movie, ahead of its release on October 23 on Amazon Prime </p>

<p>The sequel is titled Borat: Gift of Pornographic Monkey to Vice Premiere Mikhael Pence to Make Benefit Recently Diminished Nation of Kazakhstan, according to a now-deleted listing at the Writers Guild of America website (via The Film Stage). </p>

<p>There were first hints that a sequel was happening in August, when Cohen was spotted in his iconic Borat suit driving an old pickup truck.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Collider reported the Borat sequel has already been filmed, and even screened for unspecified industry types, after the crew resumed production as soon as coronavirus restrictions were eased. </p>

<p>Deadline reports Sacha 'risked his life' while filming and had to wear a bulletproof vest on two different shooting days.</p>

<p>Shocker! The green mankini worn by the character became a pop culture favourite and is often spotted being used as a fancy dress costume  </p>

<p>He's back! The highly-anticipated sequel to the actor's wildly successful 2006 comedy Borat, will premiere on Amazon after bosses bought the worldwide rights to the film and the new poster boasts the slogan: 'Wear mask. Save live' (pictured in 2006)</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted the comedian's representatives and Amazon for comment.  </p>

<p>While the title has yet to be confirmed with any official marketing materials, it does fall in line with the full title of the original film: Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.  </p>

<p>The name suggests that Pence will be a target, while former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani will also make an appearance. </p>

<p>Return: The film became a cult classic</p>

<p>Sequel: There were first hints that a sequel was happening in August, when Cohen was spotted in his iconic Borat suit driving an old pickup truck </p>

<p>The title also insinuates that Pence has ties to Russia, calling him 'Mikhael Pence' instead of Mike Pence, and giving him the Russian title of Vice Premiere instead of Vice President.</p>

<p>The original 2006 film featured Cohen playing his Borat character, which he first debuted on his hit TV series Da Ali G Show.</p>

<p>Borat was a TV reporter from Kazakhstan, who was sent to America with his producer Azamat (Ken Davitan).</p>

<p>While Borat is sent to report on the American way of life, he quickly becomes obsessed with the old TV series Baywatch, as he begins a quest to find and marry star Pamela Anderson. </p>

<p>Quite the character: The original 2006 film featured Cohen playing his Borat character, which he first debuted on his hit TV series Da Ali G Show</p>

<p>The screenplay is credited to Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Dan Swimer, Peter Baynham, Erica Rivinoja, Dan Mazer, Jena Friedman, and Lee Kern with story by Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Dan Swimer, and Nina Pedrad.</p>

<p>Hines, Baynham and Mazer all got screenplay credit on the original Borat movie, with Cohen, Baynham, Hines and Todd Phillips getting story credit.</p>

<p>Swimer, Kern and Hines have worked with Cohen on his hit Showtime series This Is America, while Rivinoja wrote for South Park and worked on movies such as Girls Trip, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Trolls.</p>
