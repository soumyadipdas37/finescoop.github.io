<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A four-year-old born without ears is hoping reconstructive surgery will help her feel like every other little girl.</p>

<p>Harriet Sanders, four, (pictured) was born without ears or ear canals</p>

<p>Harriet Sanders from Tarragindi in Brisbane's south has a rare congenital condition known as bilateral microtia and atresia. </p>

<p>She does not have ears or ear canals on either side of her head. </p>

<p>Her father Jay Sanders said she seemed like a perfectly healthy baby when she was delivered.</p>

<p>'When she was born she came out and as little babies are they are all squashed and you don't really think much of it you think oh cool I've got a beautiful girl,' he said. </p>

<p>But he said it wasn't long before they discovered something was wrong.</p>

<p>Harriet was fitted with hearing aids at three weeks old and developed like any other normal child</p>

<p>Her father Jay Sanders (pictured with Harriet) said she seemed like a perfectly healthy baby when she was delivered</p>

<p>'I remember looking at her side and thinking one ear is all scrunched up and the other side looks a little bare and I thought that's a bit strange,' he said.</p>

<p>'No-one could tell us what the story was, the doctors didn't really know much and Anna and I had to sleep on it for 24 hours until an ENT came the next day and said this is what has happened.'</p>

<p>Harriet was fitted with hearing aids at three weeks old and developed like any other child.   </p>

<p>But her parents are fighting to get expensive reconstructive surgery so she can look and feel like a normal four-year-old girl.</p>

<p>The operation to construct and surgically attach the 3D printed ears would take between 10 to 12 hours. </p>

<p>But her parents Anna and Jay Sanders (pictured together with Harriet) are fighting to get expensive reconstructive surgery so she can feel like a normal four-year-old girl</p>

<p>To cover the costs they have reached out to the community through crowdfunding platform GoFundme</p>

<p>'This operation will mean she can go to school and go through life looking like everyone else, with no physical deformity,' Mother Anna Sanders said. </p>

<p>'It will give her a huge amount of confidence.'</p>

<p>'For her to be able to wear sunglasses, and to look like a normal kid- to push her hair behind her ears- they are simple little things that she doesn't get to do today,' Mr Sanders said.</p>

<p>The family faces being left $70,000 out of pocket even with private health insurance and Medicare footing part of the surgery bill.</p>

<p>They have reached out to the community through crowdfunding platform Gofundme to help cover the costs.</p>

<p>The family has raised more than $56,000 of their $70,000 goal since launching the fundraiser on September 3.</p>

<p>Her parents are fighting to get expensive reconstructive surgery so she can feel like a normal four-year-old girl</p>

<p>They say they are 'truly overwhelmed' by the support and generosity of strangers across Australia.</p>

<p>'We want to thank each and every one of you that have very generously donated and your kind words. We really do appreciate your support so much,' they wrote on GoFundme.</p>

<p>'We are so grateful and excited that Harriet's dream of having ears is getting much closer.' </p>

<p>The surgery will be performed by Dr Joe Dusseldorp, known to his patients as Dr Joe.</p>

<p>He will construct new ears using a 3D printer constructed with tiny holes which allow tissue to grow into it.</p>

<p>The scaffolding is then covered with skin grafts so it looks like normal ears. </p>

<p>Since launching the fundraiser on September 3 they have raised more than $56,000 of their $70,000 goal to get Harriet life changing surgery</p>
