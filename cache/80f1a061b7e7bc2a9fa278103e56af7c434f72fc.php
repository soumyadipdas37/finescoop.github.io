<p>Revealing her baby's gender for the first time, she said: 'I haven't settled on a name yet. There are two names I absolutely love, but I just need to decide which way round I would prefer his name to be.</p>

<p>'I haven't registered him yet, (the government are allowing extra time to register a child during the Covid: 19 pandemic) so I have a bit of time to decide.'</p>

<p>She has now however posted the introduction post to Junior and subsequently a lengthy and gushing post about her baby son. </p>
