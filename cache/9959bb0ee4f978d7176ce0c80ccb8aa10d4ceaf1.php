<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Samsung has officially unveiled its new foldable phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 2, with a bigger 7.6-inch display, 27 per cent smaller bezels and a smoother fold, retailing for a whopping £1,799.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 2, unveiled at a virtual event today, is the Korean company's third foldable phone and an update of the original Galaxy Fold, released last year. </p>

<p>When unfolded, the phone's screen is bigger and more square in shape than its predecessor for a more cinematic and immersive viewing experience thanks to thinner bezels – the borders between a screen and a phone's frame. </p>

<p>The device, which supports 5G, also comes with a Infinity-O display, which covers the entire face of the phone and features a small 'hole punch' for the camera.   </p>

<p>Samsung revealed a sneak peak of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 at its virtual Unpacked event for the Galaxy Note 20 smartphone last month but has only just released full details.</p>

<p>The phone goes on sale on September 18, with pre-orders starting on the Samsung website from today. </p>

<p>Samsung has already released two foldable devices – the Galaxy Z Fold and the Galaxy Z Flip, which flips like a retro 90s phone thanks to a hinge through the screen.  </p>

<p>'Last year Samsung pioneered a new mobile category with the launch of the Galaxy Fold,' said Gina Suk, manager of Marketing Relations at Samsung Electronics. </p>

<p>'Now, our innovation journey continues with the Galaxy Z Fold 2.' </p>

<p>The new Galaxy Z Fold 2 has been redesigned based on consumer feedback and smartphone user behaviours, according to Samsung.</p>

<p>The company surveyed 476 Galaxy Fold users in the US and Korea late last year and found a 71 per cent surge in watching video clips and a 35 per cent increase in gaming compared to their previous smartphones.  </p>

<p>The device's 'free stand' capability allows it to stand from anywhere between a 75 to 115 degree angle for hands-free use, such as watching videos while exercising </p>

<p>The biggest difference between the original Galaxy Fold and the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is the two screens – the outer screen and the larger main screen that's revealed when unfolded. </p>

<p>The cover screen is 1.63 times the size of the cover screen on last year's model – 6.2 inches across compared with 4.6 inches on the original.  </p>

<p>The main screen, meanwhile, is an impressive 7.6 inches across, bigger than the original Galaxy Fold's 7.3 inches.  </p>

<p>Dimensions of the device when unfolded measure slightly larger in width than the original – 5.04 inches, compared with 4.64 inches – and around the same length. </p>

<p>But the extra screen space for enjoying content is also thanks to smaller bezels and the Infinity O display. </p>

<p>Infinity-O, which is the closest thing to an all-screen design, has a tiny circular cut-out at the top of the display for the front camera.  </p>

<p>The main screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 2 now also features a 120Hz default refresh rate for smoother scrolling and better gameplay, twice that of the Galaxy Fold.</p>

<p>Dual speakers on either side of the screen also provide a balanced stereo effect for a more immersive sound experience without the need for Bluetooth speakers.</p>

<p>Both the main and cover screen have 10 megapixel cameras designed for selfies, while the back of the device features a triple camera system – 12 megapixel ultra wide, 12 megapixel wide-angle and a 12 megapixel telephoto camera with up to 10 times digital zoom. </p>

<p>The device's 'free stand' capability allows it to stand from anywhere between a 75 to 115 degree angle for hands-free use, such as watching videos while exercising. </p>

<p>By placing the phone on a level surface, users can record video clips without 'ever having to worry about the effects of shaky hands', Samsung said. </p>

<p>When completely folded, the new device is also slimmer than its predecessor for a better fit in the owner's pocket, thanks to less chunky components.  </p>

<p>Samsung has also touted more 'seamless transitions' when users want to switch between folded and unfolded mode while using apps.  </p>

<p>'Multi-active window' lets users open multiple files from the same app at the same time, viewing them side by side on the main screen when the phone is unfolded. </p>

<p>Galaxy Z Fold 2 also has a 4500mAh dual battery, fast wireless charging, 12GB RAM with 256GB internal storage and runs Android 10.</p>

<p>One industry expert has praised the larger exterior screen and the phone overall - despite its sizeable price tag</p>

<p>Industry expert Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said the new phone addresses all the major shortcomings of its predecessor, most notably the 6.2-inch external display.</p>

<p>'On the last version, it was extremely tricky to use the device as a one-handed smartphone so you ended up having to constantly open the phone to do simple tasks such as send text messages,' he said. </p>

<p>“The Galaxy Fold 2 is a significantly refined version of this flagship device. </p>

<p>'The larger external display lends itself to one-handed use in a similar manner to a normal smartphone but you still have the benefit of the tablet-like 7.6-inch internal screen which is only marginally smaller than an iPad Mini.</p>

<p>'Add to that the new hinge which allows you to have the screen open at different angles and it’s a major step forward as the previous device was only really viable when it was fully open or closed.' </p>

<p>Galaxy Z Fold 2 is available in two colours - mystic black and mystic bronze - although customers can pick the colour of the hinge</p>

<p>The original Galaxy Fold was released in September 2019, following technical troubles that held up its worldwide launch, including reports of broken displays after only a few days of use when the device was released to reviewers in April. </p>

<p>Some of the damage was caused by impact on the top and bottom exposed areas of the hinge, the company said.</p>

<p>Among the issues were dust and particles finding their way underneath the display and causing bumps and blemished in addition to interfering with the hinge mechanism.  </p>

<p>The phone initially appears similar to the original Galaxy Fold. Both devices feature an outer screen and a giant inner screen that appears when unfolded</p>

<p>The main screen now features a 120Hz default refresh rate for smoother scrolling and better gameplay, twice that of the Galaxy Fold</p>

<p>Galaxy Z Fold 2 overcomes these issues with sweeper technology that makes it more difficult for dust to infiltrate the folding mechanism.   </p>

<p>Its design is 'anchored' by the Hideaway Hinge, which fits into the device body with the CAM mechanism and enables free standing capabilities. </p>

<p>The designs uses a dual CAM mechanism that makes standing the device upright easier. </p>

<p>A CAM has two ridged-shaped parts with a flat surface in the middle and the folding and unfolding are maintained when the edges meet.   </p>

<p>Galaxy Z Fold 2 is available in two colours – mystic black and mystic bronze.</p>

<p>But consumers have the option of customising the colour of the hideaway hinge to fit their tastes – either metallic silver, metallic red, metallic blue or metallic gold.  </p>

<p>The phone also comes as a limited edition as part of a partnership with American clothes retailer Thom Browne, which goes on general sale in the UK on September 25 for a mind-numbing £2,999, exclusively on Samsung.com and Harrods. </p>

<p>Each Thom Browne Edition Package also includes the Galaxy Watch3, Galaxy Buds Live and customised accessories. </p>
