<p>Shayk's sighting comes after a slew of platonic reunions with her ex Bradley Cooper, who is the father of her three-year-old daughter Lea. </p>

<p>The former couple have been making the most of their time together, as they were photographed together on Tuesday and Thursday.</p>

<p>Bradley and Irina began dating in 2015. Lea was born in 2017, but they called it quits in June 2019.</p>

<p>Exes: Bradley and Irina split in June 2019 after four years together. They're seen at the 2018 Met Gala above</p>

<p>The couple haven't let the end of their romance or their busy schedules interfere with their co-parenting.</p>

<p>'There are still challenges because he does have a very busy schedule and she's back at work now so there are times they have to compromise, and they do,' a source told HollywoodLife in March.</p>

<p>'He's been making an effort to take projects that aren't too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he's very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he'd carry her everywhere.' </p>

<p>Rumours: It comes after Irina and art dealer Vito Schnabel continued to spark relationship rumours over the weekend </p>

<p>'He's totally devoted to Lea, it's really sweet to see how much he loves being a dad,' the insider went on.</p>

<p>He's been back in NYC after spending time in Southern California shooting a yet-to-be-titled Paul Thomas Anderson film.  </p>

<p>She has been spotted several times with her potential new boyfriend Vito Schnabel, who is a longtime pal and previously dated Heidi Klum. </p>
