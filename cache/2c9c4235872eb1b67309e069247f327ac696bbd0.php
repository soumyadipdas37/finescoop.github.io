<p>A celebrity astrologer has revealed how signs of the zodiac will react to the next few months of Mars Retrograde, which is known for 'disrupting' energy levels. </p>

<p>The planet Mars is going into retrograde from September 9 until November 13, 2020, which Hollywood stargazer Nicolas Aujula laments will affect vitality, sex life and relationships, both at home and in the office.</p>

<p>'Mars rules over your energy levels and how you jump into action. During retrograde this energy is limited and we begin to feel more irritation, frustration, anger and impatience,' he told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>'It is key that we know how to assert and clarify ourselves through meaningful action.'</p>

<p>Broadly speaking this retrograde will make the world more prone to conflict, protest, war and infections - a less than positive note in the midst of a global pandemic. </p>

<p>'Mars retrograde also forms a challenging 90 degree square with Saturn, the planet of hard work and order, so we'll have to contend with extra restriction, uphill battles, and slowed progress,' he said.</p>

<p>So what's on the cards for you? </p>

<p>Mars in retrograde for Aries will make their usual driven attitude feel a bit deflated (stock image)</p>

<p>Aries: March 21 - April 19</p>

<p>Mars in retrograde for Aries will make their usual driven attitude feel a bit deflated.</p>

<p>'Mars can really dampen your personal energy so you might feel frustrated that you're not achieving much, but it's time to take it easy and be still,' Nicholas said.</p>

<p>'Issues around unresolved anger can come up. Confront those issues and channel your frustration through something physical, like boxing.'</p>

<p>Every 26 months or so, there are a couple of months when Mars' position from night to night seems to change direction and move east to west, Nasa reported.</p>

<p>It's an illusion, caused by the ways that Earth and Mars orbit the sun.</p>

<p>Earth moves faster than Mars - so much faster that it makes two laps around the Sun in as much time as it takes Mars to go around once.</p>

<p>Every two years Earth comes up from behind and overtakes Mars, which is called 'retrograde motion'.</p>

<p>Taurus: April 20 - May 20</p>

<p>Your focus can fluctuate as you figure out what direction to put your efforts in.</p>

<p>There might be some confusion and lack of knowledge on what step to actually take.</p>

<p>'Don't rush, take your time. It can be a period to cut your losses and move away from those aspects that are not working out,' Nicholas said.</p>

<p>'There can be much to gain by retreating to take some spiritual reflection, so go within.'</p>

<p>Gemini: May 21 - June 20</p>

<p>Friendships can become a source of conflict in retrograde for Geminis, where old wounds and disagreements come to a head.</p>

<p>You can find yourself not being assertive enough with certain friends and colleagues and you might question your needs over that of others. </p>

<p>'It's essential to reclaim your place without stepping on too many toes,' Nicholas said.</p>

<p>'When you work with others, you can advance further than you would going it alone.'</p>

<p>Be mindful of spending as debt can be a problem for Virgos right now. </p>

<p>Reduction in income or increased outgoings means having to reassess your finances. </p>

<p>'If you rely on others for help then it may not be available now,' Nicholas said.</p>

<p>Libra: September 23 - October 22</p>

<p>Sagittarius: November 22 - December 21</p>

<p>This season might be a time for Sagittarius to rekindle past romances or hear back from ex flames, which will bring a temporary passion into your life. </p>

<p>It won't be long-lasting but will give you closure and understanding.</p>

<p>'Rather than focus on one thing during this time, focus on as many as you can,' Nicholas said.</p>

<p>'Whilst you won't finish them all, in the process you will find something fulfilling and rewarding.'</p>

<p>Capricorn: December 22 - January 19</p>

<p>Aquarius: January 20 - February 18</p>

<p>Impulse spending over things you later realise you don't need leads to waste. </p>

<p>'Revisit your budget, list your in goings and out comings to fully understand spending. Keep money aside for a rainy day as there will be unexpected costs ahead,' he said.</p>
