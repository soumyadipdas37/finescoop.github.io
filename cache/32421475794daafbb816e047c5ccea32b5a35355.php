<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An image of a 'delicate supernova blast wave' seen draped across the sky 2,400 light years from Earth, has been captured by the NASA Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<p>Appearing like a light veil across the sky, it is actually the outer edge of a supernova remnant from an explosion that blasted apart a dying star up to 20,000 years ago.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA), a partner in the Hubble telescope, said the exploding star would have been about 20 times more massive than our Sun.  </p>

<p>The stellar phenomenon is called the Cygnus supernova blast wave - the name comes from its position in the northern constellation of Cygnus (the Swan).  </p>

<p>Appearing like a light veil across the sky, it is actually the outer edge of a supernova remnant from an explosion that blasted apart a dying star up to 20,000 years ago</p>

<p>Since the original supernova explosion blasted apart the giant star, the remnant has expanded out as much as 60 light-years from its centre. </p>

<p>The shockwave imaged by Hubble marks the outer edge of the supernova remnant and continues to expand at around 217 miles per second, ESA explained. </p>

<p>'The interaction of ejected material and low-density interstellar material swept up by the shockwave forms the distinctive veil-like structure seen in the image,' ESA said.</p>

<p>A supernova is an explosion where a giant star reaches the end of its life and expels most of its mass into space - over time resulting in strange shaped remnants.</p>

<p>The Cygnus remnant covers an area of the sky 36 times larger than the full Moon.</p>

<p>Hubble is now celebrating 30 years since it was launched into low earth orbit in 1990 - over that time it has helped revolutionise our understanding of the universe. </p>

<p>While Hubble has been an amazing source of information for scientists, it has also revealed some of the most iconic astronomy images ever captured.</p>

<p>Since the original supernova explosion blasted apart the giant star, the remnant has expanded out as much as 60 light-years from its centre. This is an image of the wider Cygnus Loop captured by Hubble in 1991</p>

<p>As well as showing the world this new 'outer edge' of the Cygnus supernova blast, Hubble also captured the wider Cygnus loop.</p>

<p>This is a stellar nebula created from the same supernova explosion. </p>

<p>Most stars that explode in a supernova leave behind a small stellar remnant - such as a neutron star or a black hole - but so far nobody has found the one left from the explosion that created this extensive blast wave.</p>

<p>It is expected that the remnant left behind by the Cygnus supernova will be up to 15 times more massive than the Sun - putting it in the range of a neutron star.  </p>

<p>The Hubble telescope was launched on April 24, 1990, via the space shuttle Discovery from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.</p>

<p>It is named after famed astronomer Edwin Hubble who was born in Missouri in 1889.</p>

<p>He is arguably most famous for discovering that the universe is expanding and the rate at which is does so - now coined the Hubble constant. </p>

<p>The Hubble telescope is named after famed astronomer Edwin Hubble who was born in Missouri in 1889 (pictured)</p>

<p>Hubble has made more than 1.3 million observations since its mission began in 1990 and helped publish more than 15,000 scientific papers.</p>

<p>It orbits Earth at a speed of about 17,000mph (27,300kph) in low Earth orbit at about 340 miles in altitude.</p>

<p>Hubble has the pointing accuracy of .007 arc seconds, which is like being able to shine a laser beam focused on Franklin D. Roosevelt's head on a dime roughly 200 miles (320km) away.</p>

<p>The Hubble telescope is named after Edwin Hubble who was responsible for coming up with the Hubble constant and is one of the greatest astronomers of all-time</p>

<p>Hubble's primary mirror is 2.4 meters (7 feet, 10.5 inches) across and in total is 13.3 meters (43.5 feet) long - the length of a large school bus.</p>

<p>Hubble's launch and deployment in April 1990 marked the most significant advance in astronomy since Galileo's telescope. </p>

<p>Thanks to five servicing missions and more than 25 years of operation, our view of the universe and our place within it has never been the same. </p>
