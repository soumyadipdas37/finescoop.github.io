<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>David De Gea is set to start the season in goal for Manchester United with a warning from manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that his place is under threat from Dean Henderson.</p>

<p>It’s understood that De Gea will get the nod against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday evening but his status as United’s undisputed No.1 is in serious jeopardy for the first time in 10 years at United.</p>

<p>Henderson has made it clear that he will not be happy sitting on the bench after returning from a loan spell at Sheffield United and signing a new contract. The 23-year-old wants first-team football to push his claims to be England’s No.1 at the European Championships next summer.</p>

<p>David De Ges will start season in goal for Manchester United but warned place is under threat</p>

<p>Dean Henderson is pushing to replace the Spaniard as No 1 for first time in 10 years at United</p>

<p>Ahead of United’s first game of the season against Palace, Solskjaer insisted the best man will play and keep the shirt on merit.</p>

<p>‘Yeah, you keep your place in the team or you play when you play well, it doesn’t matter if you’re a keeper or a striker or full-back,’ said the United manager.</p>

<p>‘Of course, keeper is a different position on the pitch. There are less physical demands compared to an outfield player that you will rotate more maybe.</p>

<p>‘But you need competition, and you need to get that competition to push each other so we can get the best possible performance out of one of them. Hopefully the two of them will always be performing when they play.’</p>

<p>Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has warned the best performer will take and keep the shirt</p>

<p>Solskjaer stood by De Gea during another sticky spell at the end of last season, playing the Spaniard in the semi-finals of the FA Cup and Europa League even though Sergio Romero had done well in most of the earlier rounds.</p>

<p>Romero is now looking to leave United and has stayed at home in Argentina while his next move is sorted out.</p>
