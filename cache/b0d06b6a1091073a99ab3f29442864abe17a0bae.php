<p>A red-bellied black snake has been pulled from the glove box of a red Toyota after a woman spotted the venomous reptile while driving</p>

<p>'The lady driving obviously got a hell of a fright as she saw it coming out while driving,' Andrew's Snake Removal wrote on Facebook, alongside a video of the removal.</p>

<p>The woman called Andrew's Snake Removal to remove the metre-long creature from the car</p>

<p>'I opened up the glove box and there it was sitting nice and content.'</p>

<p>The snake catcher grabbed the serpent by his tail and begun to pull his body through a gap at the top of the glove box.</p>

<p>'He was sitting right in your glove box,' the snake catcher told the woman.</p>

<p>He then softly jiggled the snake's belly to free him from the car.  </p>

<p>'C'mon buddy,' he said before the snake fell through the gap. </p>

<p>Andrew's Snake Removal said it had been a 'busy day' but he was glad to have freed the snake swiftly.</p>

<p>'Its usually a nightmare to find a snake when its got in to a car but luckily found this guy pretty quickly,' the Facebook post read. </p>
