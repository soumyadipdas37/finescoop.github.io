<p>The poster was shared on Twitter by artist and theatre-maker Harriet Mould. The post has had 14,000 retweets and received more than 93,000 likes in just 24 hours</p>

<p>Twitter users were left feeling hot under the collar, with one posting: 'Good Lord. I can't stop staring.'</p>

<p>Another tweeted: 'Now this might be my typa coffee, a movie with a dominant woman and a not-so-dominant man [sic].'</p>

<p>A third added: 'I haven't the slightest clue what it's about but i want premiere tickets.'</p>

<p>However others were left disappointed when they watched the trailer and discovered the UK film is a modern day psychological thriller and not the romp the poster suggests. </p>

<p>Others noted there seemed to be a 'period movie' feel to the image, although the film is set in present day England.</p>

<p>Another shot from the film shows Northern Irish actress Antonia Campbell-Hughes (who plays Cordelia and her twin) with co-star Johnny Flynn (who plays Frank)</p>

<p>The film poster left fans feeling hot under the collar and they joked they wanted tickets without needing to see a preview. Dozens have taken to Twitter to share their excitement (pictured) </p>

<p>One tweeted: 'I straight up thought Cordelia was a period piece about a sexually dominate woman based on its poster, and apparently I wasn't alone. But we're all wrong. It's a modern day horror movie? Huh.'</p>

<p>A second user agreed: 'The poster made me think it was gonna be some Victorian era love story or sumn [sic]. But the teaser looks like that of a modern age horror/thriller movie. I'm confused.' </p>

<p>Directed by Adrian Shergold, the film stars Antonia Campbell-Hughes as both title character Cordelia and her twin sister Caroline. </p>

<p>The sisters live in their central London basement flat left to them by their late father. </p>

<p>Directed by Adrian Shergold, the film stars Antonia Campbell-Hughes as both title character Cordelia and her twin sister Caroline. Pictured, Campbell-Hughes in the film </p>

<p>The sisters live in their central London basement flat left to them by their late father. The drama centres around Cordelia's relationship with her neighbour Frank (Flynn), pictured</p>

<p>The trailer reveals Cordelia is a psychological thriller, not the romp suggested by the poster</p>

<p>Cordelia, who has been left traumatised from an event from the past, sees her recovery thrown into turmoil when her sister leaves for a weekend away, according to film site Flickering Myth. </p>

<p>It is then that Cordelia meets neighbour Frank, played by Flynn, who appeared in Emma and is set to star as David Bowie in biopic Stardust.    </p>

<p>'As their relationship develops, Cordelia becomes convinced she is being stalked. Increasingly anxious and unsure of Frank’s motives, Cordelia begins to unravel,' Flickering Myth continues.</p>

<p>However Frank is also wary of Cordelia. At one point in the trailer, he asks: 'Am I safe with you, Cordelia?'</p>

<p>However others were left disappointed when they watched the trailer and discovered the film is a modern day psychological thriller and not the romp the poster suggests. Others noted there seemed to be a 'period movie' feel to the image, although the film is set today</p>

<p>Cordelia is due to be released in the UK on October 23. </p>
