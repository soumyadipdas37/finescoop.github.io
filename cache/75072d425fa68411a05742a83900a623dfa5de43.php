<p>This week Lib Dem leader Ed Davey checks into our travel Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>He talks about his earliest travel memory, his favourite party conference town, the trip he took this summer - and more.</p>

<p>WHAT'S YOUR FIRST HOLIDAY MEMORY?</p>

<p>Going to Skegness in Lincolnshire — or Nottingham-by-the-Sea as we used to call it. We'd traipse there every summer to stay in my grandma's caravan.</p>

<p>ANY SPECIAL TEEN TRAVEL MEMORIES?</p>

<p>My parents had both died by the time I was 15. The year after Mum's death I organised an Interrail holiday around Europe with three schoolmates. We had a great time, even if we did have to sleep on the odd bench.</p>

<p>GO ANYWHERE NICE THIS SUMMER?</p>

<p>We had planned a trip to France but ended up staying with my mother-in-law near Blandford Forum in Dorset. The two kids loved it.</p>

<p>WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN A HOLIDAY ?</p>

<p>It's all about the children these days. My son John is disabled and needs warm water for his muscles, so we sometimes visit Hungary, which, besides having a treatment centre in Budapest, has some super spas.</p>

<p>TIPS FOR VISITORS TO HUNGARY ?</p>

<p>Every Hungarian town seems to have a spa, and everyone goes and lets it all hang out — it's not seen as elitist. People even play chess in the warm waters.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE PLACE THERE?</p>

<p>The city of Orosháza has the most amazing indoor and outdoor spa complex with slides the kids just love. It's really off the beaten track.</p>

<p>HOLIDAY FROM HELL?</p>

<p>In Jersey, which is the loveliest island, as a boy. A kid at our hotel said: 'Everyone who stays here gets ill.' Lo and behold, days later we all had stomach upsets.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE PARTY CONFERENCE TOWN?</p>

<p>Harrogate... or York.</p>

<p>Ed says Jersey is the 'loveliest island' but that he had a holiday from hell there as a boy</p>

<p>EVER HAVE A DIP DURING CONFERENCE?</p>

<p>I take my trunks if it's at the seaside, but more in hope than in expectation...</p>

<p>NEXT FAMILY HOLIDAY?</p>

<p>France next summer, but I suspect it may be Dorset again — no bad thing.</p>

<p>DREAM DESTINATION?</p>

<p>New Zealand, driving a camper van around South Island with the family.</p>
