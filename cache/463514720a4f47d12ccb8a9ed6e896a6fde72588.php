<p>Bilic was left angered by the officiating surrounding Kieran Gibbs' sending off following an off the ball incident with James Rodriguez, and remonstrated with Dean as the players left the field.</p>

<p>But despite his furious outburst, BT Sport pundits Joe Cole and Owen Hargreaves have defended him and believed he had every right to question the man in the middle over his decision-making.</p>

<p>Slaven Bilic was shown a red card for a furious argument at half-time in the loss at Everton</p>

<p>West Brom's boss entered the field of play at the break to discuss an incident with Mike Dean</p>

<p>A goal and a red card to finish off the half, it's all gone wrong for West Brom!Slaven Bilic vents his frustrations at Mike Dean ðŸ˜¡ pic.twitter.com/2GBqEsnHqv</p>

<p>Slaven Bilic: Check the foul, check the red card. Now itâ€™s done, you could also kill us.</p>

<p>Mike Dean: Go away, you go away.</p>

<p>Slaven Bilic: So I can't talk to you? I can't talk to you?Â </p>

<p>The Premier League newcomers gave a superb account of themselves during the first half at Goodison Park, but found themselves losing 2-1 after Rodriguez's first goal in English football.</p>

<p>Gibbs soon allowed his frustrations to get the better of him, and was caught on camera pushing the Colombian playmaker in the face while the action continued around them.</p>

<p>His red card visibly angered Bilic on the touchline, and the 52-year-old headed straight over to Dean to openly air his disagreement with the punishment.Â </p>

<p>'Check the foul, check the red card. Now itâ€™s done, you could also kill us,' Bilic could be heard insisting on camera.</p>

<p>'Go away, you go away,' Dean replied, pointing at another irked member of Bilicâ€™s coaching staff.Â </p>

<p>'So I canâ€™t talk to you? I canâ€™t talk to you?' Bilic asked as the three officials headed towards the tunnel.</p>

<p>Bilic was sent to the stands after asking referee Dean to check the foul on James Rodriguez</p>

<p>Bilic may face a touchline ban after the argument, and was restricted to watching on from the stands - while wearing a face mask - as Everton eased to a 5-2 win.Â </p>

<p>Hargreaves and Cole, however, have backed the tactician's right to protest.Â </p>

<p>â€˜I think he has the right to ask the question,â€™ Hargreaves insisted on BT Sport. â€˜Heâ€™s saying check the foul, check the red card.Â </p>

<p>'He didnâ€™t swear, he wasnâ€™t rude. I think he just wanted to know. Iâ€™m not sure he deserved to be sent off.â€™Â </p>

<p>Owen Hargreaves and Joe Cole have defended Bilic's right to protest the decision on BT Sport</p>

<p>Cole added: â€˜I think Mike lost his composure a little bit there but heâ€™s well within his rights to do it. Passionate game, Slaven just coming up.Â </p>

<p>â€˜You can understand the frustration, heâ€™s set his team up so well in that first half and in three incidents, itâ€™s killed him.'Â Â </p>

<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin plundered two more goals after the break to complete a stellar hat-trick, leaving West Brom winless after their first two fixtures back in the top flight.Â </p>
