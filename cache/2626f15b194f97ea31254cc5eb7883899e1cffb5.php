<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona have made a bid of eight million euros (£7.2m) to sign Manchester City defender Eric Garcia, according to reports in Spain. </p>

<p>SPORT claim the Premier League club value the 19-year-old centre-back at 40 million euros (£36.2m) but would be willing to lower their asking price significanty, with the player's current deal set to expire in June 2021.</p>

<p>New Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman is keen to bring the Spaniard, who graduated through the club's famous La Masia academy, back to the club. </p>

<p>Eric Garcia has reportedly been subject of an offer from  Barcelona worth eight million euros</p>

<p>However, Garcia has said he is 'focused on next season with City' which appears to rule out an imminent switch to Barcelona. </p>

<p>'It is true I have told the club I do not intend to extend my contract beyond 2021,' Garcia told Marca.</p>

<p>'But I will return to Manchester when I am finished on international duty with Spain, and I am focused on next season with City.'</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman is looking to overhaul Barcelona but could be frustrated in a deal for Garcia</p>

<p>The 19-year-old has had to remain patient under Pep Guardiola but has impressed when partnering Aymeric Laporte in the centre of the City defence. </p>

<p>He started the Champions League quarter-final defeat to Lyon and the club appear to retain hope that they can convince Garcia into a U-turn on a new deal.  </p>

<p>Garcia featured 22 times in all competitions for City during the 2019-20 season and the Citizens lost just two out of the 13 matches in which he featured in defence</p>

<p>Koeman is planning a youth overhaul of the Barcelona squad he has inherited with Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal pushed to the exit and Ivan Rakitic already sent back to his former club Sevilla.</p>
