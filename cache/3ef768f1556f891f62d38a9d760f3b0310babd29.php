<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Exeter Chiefs are not here to mess about any more.</p>

<p>They have enjoyed some big days out in their decent decade, sometimes happy to drink in the post-match ciders on the way home content they had even made it that far, but are now done with the heart-break, the near-misses and silver medals.</p>

<p>It is time to shake up the old order.</p>

<p>Henry Slade believes Exeter Chiefs can shake off their final woes and win the European Cup</p>

<p>In recent history only teams with overgrown wallets or long-established dynasties have lifted the European Cup.</p>

<p>Perhaps only Brive in 1997, Ulster in 1999 and Northampton in 2000 have broken up the run of either rich or establishment winners on the continent.</p>

<p>2016 Premiership Final L 28-20 v Saracens</p>

<p>2018 Premiership Final L 27-10 v Saracens</p>

<p>2019 Premiership Final L 37-34 v Saracens </p>

<p>So for Henry Slade and his Chiefs, Europe is due a new conqueror.</p>

<p>‘There are teams left that are notoriously very good in Europe, and have been big names, but we feel like it’s irrelevant,’ he tells Sportsmail in an exclusive interview.</p>

<p>‘We’re confident and will back ourselves against anyone.</p>

<p>‘We have massive respect for the teams left, but history doesn’t mean anything in the present does it?</p>

<p>‘It’s all about who does it this year, and that’s hopefully going to be us.’</p>

<p>Despite their now permanent residency at the top of English rugby’s domestic tables, Sunday will be only Exeter’s second European quarter-final.</p>

<p>Four years ago they let slip a 24-11 lead against Wasps losing, with the last Jimmy Gopperth kick, by a point.</p>

<p>‘It was tough to take,’ Slade explains.</p>

<p>Exeter Chiefs have now lost the Premiership final to Saracens three times since 2016</p>

<p>‘At that stage of the club’s development we were happy to be in a quarter-final. It’s different this time.’</p>

<p>Since they have won the league just once, and been beaten by Saracens in Premiership finals three times – each one feeling sicker, especially knowing now that their rivals cheated their way to those titles.</p>

<p>‘It’s gutting,’ says Slade.</p>

<p>‘Every one gets harder. The last one left me absolutely distraught.</p>

<p>‘We never want to feel that again. That is still burning in the bellies of the boys and hopefully it spurs us on.’</p>

<p>It was a 31-12 away win at La Rochelle 10 months ago this week that Exeter kicked-off their European campaign with a marquee victory.</p>

<p>They went unbeaten through the pool stage, drawing only to Glasgow in January, to set up Sunday’s quarter-final against Northampton originally due to be played in April.</p>

<p>With the form Saints are in – after six defeats in seven since rugby’s restart – most expect Exeter to walk into the semi-finals.</p>

<p>Sunday's game against Gloucester will only be Exeter's second European quarter-final</p>

<p>But Slade is focussed.</p>

<p>‘We know we’ve got a tough Saints side coming down who are hurting. That can make a team very dangerous.</p>

<p>‘You can stumble with what’s in front of you if you look too far ahead.’</p>

<p>While desperate for success, Slade himself is a lot freer these days.</p>

<p>Not in the sense that he has more time – that notion turned to dust when his partner Megan gave birth to daughter Olive last month – but now his anxieties have eased.</p>

<p>It is tricky to imagine that a player who looks so elegant and poised on the field, with a permanently perfect Devon sun-tan, has spent most of his career feeling so up-tight and in such a wrestle with his mental-health that he has felt he cannot perform properly.</p>

<p>Thankfully he has broken a cycle of OCD and now 27 we might at last see the most at-ease version of the Exeter and England centre yet.</p>

<p>'I felt like if I didn’t do things right – tying shoelaces, switching off lights – I’d get injured or bad things would happen to my family or friends,’ Slade explains.</p>

<p>‘It started when I was a little kid, 8 or 9, and I broke it just a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>‘On the pitch I was telling myself “that might be crap, because I haven’t done this right”.</p>

<p>‘I ended up thinking “the way I turn the light off isn’t going to affect how I play or how someone’s health is going to be”.</p>

<p>‘It immediately felt a massive weight off my shoulders. I wasn’t worrying about things as intensely.</p>

<p>‘Positivity is so much better for you mentally and when you’re playing.’</p>

<p>Slade jokes that team-mate Luke Cowan-Dickie will be used to scare men off his daughter</p>

<p>Olive’s arrival has helped too.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know if I like waking up at night to change a shitty nappy but I’m enjoying most of it!’ Slade laughs.</p>

<p>‘Seeing her being born was an unbelievable experience. It’s the best feeling ever – I couldn’t speak for three hours.</p>

<p>‘I’ve always tried to find ways of relaxing outside of rugby, because you can’t be thinking about it all the time.</p>

<p>‘The season is so long, and now they’re moulding into one you need a chance to relax and take your mind off things. I used to play Call of Duty, now I’m changing nappies!’</p>

<p>Now she has squad of hulking uncles, pity the poor bloke who becomes Olive’s first boyfriend.</p>

<p>‘There’s that series Money Heist where they’re in a gang and one of the daughters has a boy wanting to take her out,’ smiles Slade looking into the future.</p>

<p>‘He brings her inside and the whole gang are waiting in the garage!</p>

<p>Slade admits Exeter are 'a bunch of misfits' but that it makes for a good and diverse squad</p>

<p>‘It’ll be like that – I’ll get Dave Ewers round, Luke Cowan-Dickie… the big lads to scare him off! “Make sure she’s home before nine!”’</p>

<p>They are tighter than most down in Devon. Moulded in the image of boss Rob Baxter the Chiefs are expected to out-work everyone – the non-negotiable standard set – but also enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>With a squad full of dodgy haircuts, sprawling tattoos, sons of fisherman, pigeon-racers and butchers as well as muscle-car drivers, hunters, eccentrics and the best from out west it is also clear they are encouraged to be themselves.</p>

<p>‘We’re a bunch of misfits really,’ says Slade, who grew up in the south Devon village of Yealmpton.</p>

<p>‘It makes for a good and diverse squad.’</p>

<p>The move from old-school Championship dirt-trackers to England’s elite has been gradual, always with a nod back to an amateur past.</p>

<p>‘We transitioned from the old-fashioned rugby club stuff of beers on the way back,’ says Slade before interrupting himself.</p>

<p>‘Well, we still have beers on the way back from a tough game, but it’s different.</p>

<p>‘We make time and days for beers together. That’s when you learn most about each other, after a couple of pints.</p>

<p>‘Exeter is an awesome place to be. On the rugby side we are going really well and have a great group of players and coaches.</p>

<p>‘Outside that, I’m from here, but the South West is such a nice place to live.</p>

<p>‘The beaches are nearby, the moors are close, and Exeter is not the biggest place so the boys live near each other.</p>

<p>‘That combination of factors is why people enjoy it so much down here.</p>

<p>‘It makes you feel very proud looking at the journey the club has been on, having been there for pretty much all of it.’</p>

<p>But Slade and Exeter are no longer starry-eyed. The only stars they are interested in are ones they can stitch on their shirts.</p>
