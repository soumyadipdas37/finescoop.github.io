<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australians could soon be enjoying cheaper beer, as Australia's largest breweries push the government to cut excise tax to reduce prices and provide a lifeline to struggling pubs and clubs.</p>

<p>Coopers, Lion and Carlton &amp; United Breweries combined to make the call, saying  booze must be made more affordable to entice badly-needed customers back to bars after many months of heavily reduced trade due to coronavirus lockdowns.</p>

<p>The breweries estimate 85 per cent of the country's beer stock is made in Australia. </p>

<p>Coopers, Lion and Carlton &amp; United Breweries called on the government to make booze at pubs and clubs more affordable as 85 per cent of the country's stock is made in Australia (pictured, woman pouring a beer in Bunbury on May 18)</p>

<p>This would make alcohol more affordable for customers and help the struggling industry (pictured, people having a beer in Victoria on June 1)</p>

<p>Currently breweries are taxed $2.23 per litre of alcohol at the manufacturing point, which is passed on to consumers. </p>

<p>Peter Filipovic, chair of Brewers Association of Australia, said a cut would help breweries' biggest customer - the hospitality industry.</p>

<p>'We need to make a beer at the pub more affordable. It is as simple as that,' Mr Filipovic said.</p>

<p>'The tax on beer has gone up twice annually for the past 35 years forcing Australians to pay the fourth highest beer tax in the industrialised world.</p>

<p>'This has meant beer, the drink that brings people together, is less and less affordable for everyday Australians. It's not unusual for a single pint to cost $10 or more nowadays, whereas in the 1970s, a beer would set you back less than a dollar.'</p>

<p>He said Australian beer drinkers need some respite from price rises - with consumption of the amber liquid sliding to a 50-year low pre-COVID-19, due chiefly to cost.     </p>

<p>"As we recover from COVID-19 Australians will want to return to their favourite local, however, there is a risk that COVID-19 will have caused permanent behaviour change meaning there is a reticence to gather in pubs and clubs,' he said.</p>

<p>'By cutting excise the Government has an opportunity to incentivise Australians to get out and about and support our vibrant, world leading hospitality industry.'</p>

<p>The loss from pubs and clubs being closed has not been made up for in liquor store sales.  </p>

<p>Breweries are also pushing for a domestic tourism package and a continuation of JobKeeper.  </p>
