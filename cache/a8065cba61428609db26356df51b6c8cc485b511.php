<p>'I have very good memories of it,' she said of her husband's presidency.  </p>

<p>'It was an extraordinary time, but I was scared all the time. 'I was scared all the time for my husband, I was scared for myself, that I'd do something I wasn't supposed to do.</p>

<p>'I was afraid someone who tell or make up a story.  It's such a high role, I felt I was a target.'</p>

<p>On top of the attention from the public and the press, Bruni was afraid something graver would happen to her spouse or herself.  </p>

<p>She continued: 'I was afraid he [Sarkozy] would be killed or that something very serious would happen. I was worried about the weight of all these important issues on his shoulders and that we would be held responsible for them.'</p>

<p>Former French Lady Carla Bruni, 52, who married Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, opened up about her time at the Elysee Palace on French TV (pictured in Cannes in May 2019)</p>

<p>Bruni said she felt like a target and was afraid of doing things wrong as France's first lady (pictured during a State Banquet at Windsor Castle with the QWueen and the Duke of Edinburgh in 2008) </p>

<p>She went on to say that in spite of this anxious time, she did not regret her years as France's First Lady. </p>

<p>She ended on a lighter note, mentioned the letters of complaints her husband sometimes would receive about the rain or adverse weather, things he had no control over. </p>

<p>Before she was a first lady, Bruni, who has both French and Italian nationality, had made a name for herself as a singer and model. </p>

<p>She recently was named in the autobiographical novel from her ex-partner - and father of her son - Raphaël Enthoven. </p>

<p>Enthoven, 45, calls Bruni the 'ideal woman' in his new book Le Temps Gagné (Time Saved), which lays bare parts of his and his family's private lives under the guise of a work of fiction. </p>
