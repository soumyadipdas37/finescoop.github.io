<p>Oscar Wilde (1854-1900), full name Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde, was born in Dublin but moved to London in 1878.</p>

<p>He was known for his wit and his critically acclaimed novel and play writing. His parents both published their own books - his father's on archaeology, folklore and the satirist Jonathan Swift, while his mother, who wrote under the pen name Speranza, was a revolutionary poet. </p>

<p>Oscar Wilde (1854-1900), full name Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde, was born in Dublin but moved to London in 1878</p>

<p>Wilde won scholarships at Trinity College in Dublin and then Magdalen College at Oxford University - which awarded him a degree with honours.  </p>

<p>In the early 1880s, when Aestheticism (a movement which believed in art for art's sake) was all the rage in London, Wilde established himself in social and artistic circles by his wit and flamboyance.</p>

<p>Eager for further acclaim, Wilde agreed to lecture in the United States and Canada in 1882, announcing on his arrival at customs in New York City that he had 'nothing to declare but his genius.' </p>

<p>After his return he lectured in the UK about his impressions of America. </p>

<p>In 1884 Wilde married Constance Lloyd, the daughter of a prominent Irish barrister. The pair had two children - Cyril and Vyvyan in 1885 and 1886. </p>

<p>At this time, Wilde was a reviewer for the Pall Mall Gazette and then became editor of Woman’s World, during which time he published The Happy Prince and Other Tales.</p>

<p>It was in the last 10 years of his life that Wilde wrote almost all of his major work. His only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, saw him combine supernatural elements of the Gothic genre with sins of French decadent fiction.  </p>

<p>Intentions (1891), consisting of previously published essays, restated his aesthetic attitude toward art by borrowing ideas from the French poets Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire and the American painter James McNeill Whistler. In the same year, two volumes of stories and fairy tales also appeared, testifying to his extraordinary creative inventiveness: Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, and Other Stories and A House of Pomegranates. </p>

<p>Wilde's greatest successes were his society comedies. His first success was Lady Windermere's Fan, followed by his macabre play Salomé, written in French and designed to make his audience shudder by its depiction of unnatural passion. </p>

<p>A second society comedy, A Woman of No Importance, convinced one critic that Wilde's plays 'must be taken on the very highest plane of modern English drama'.</p>

<p>His final plays, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Ernest,  were produced in 1895. The second was his greatest achievement and saw him expose the hypocrisies of Victorian society. </p>

<p>He was known for his wit and his critically acclaimed novel and play writing</p>

<p>Throughout this time, Wilde was on trial accused of being a homosexual by the Marquess of Queensbury (the father of Lord Alfred Douglas, whom Wilde had an affair with). </p>

<p>He was found guilty and in 1895 was sentenced to two years in prison with hard labour. He was released in 1897 and was bankrupt. </p>

<p>Wilde immediately travelled to France, where being gay was no longer illegal, and wrote his final work - The Ballad of Reading Gaol - in which he revealed his concern for inhumane prison conditions. </p>

<p>He died suddenly in 1900 of acute meningitis brought on by an ear infection but was accepted into the Roman Catholic Church (which he had long admired) just before passing away.  </p>
