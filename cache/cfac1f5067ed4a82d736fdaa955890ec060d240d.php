<p>The publication reports that the changes will keep cast and crew safe, and ensure that there are episodes ready to go should filming be impacted by the virus.</p>

<p>Producing the show in Australia will also pose a problem with filming it live due to the change in time zones, meaning that it will need to be prerecorded. </p>

<p>Channel 10's Head of Entertainment Stephen Tate told MediaWeek: 'The fact that we won’t have a time difference that Africa gave us will mean the show will need to be prerecorded.' </p>

<p>The past seasons of I'm a Celebrity have all been filmed in the South African jungle, however with production unable to travel overseas due to coronavirus travel restrictions, the 2021 series will be filmed in Australia.</p>

<p>According to TV Tonight, the campsite is less than an hour from the Gold Coast, off Dungay Creek Road, north of Murwillumbah. </p>

<p>The UK version of the show, which has been filmed in Australia for almost two decades, has also been forced to reconsider its location due to the pandemic. </p>

<p>Back in May, ViacomCBS executive Beverley McGarvey confirmed the show would 'definitely be back next year' and that a potential change of format was on the cards. </p>

<p>At the time, Ms McGarvey explained I'm A Celebrity... could 'absolutely' be filmed Down Under.</p>

<p>'The jungle is kind of a character in the show, but we just don't know if that's possible or realistic, so we're just looking at a range of options,' she told news.com.au</p>
