<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The boss of Flight Centre has issued a desperate plea for Australia's borders to be reopened 'as soon as possible' after more store closures were announced.</p>

<p>The company will close another 91 stores across the country with hundreds of staff expected to lose their jobs as the coronavirus pandemic continues to take a crippling toll on the travel industry.</p>

<p>Chief executive Graham Turner has called for Australia's international borders to be reopened in wake of the latest announcement.</p>

<p>'We have to live with this virus,' Mr Turner told ABC News Breakfast on Thursday.</p>

<p> 'A vaccine is still some months away — and even if it's here, the virus will still be around for at least two or three years.</p>

<p>'We need the Australian borders open, we need the New Zealand trans-Tasman [bubble] up and running as soon as possible.'</p>

<p>The latest store closures and job cuts are in addition to 4,000 Flight Centre already let go in the past six months due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Graham Turner wants to see a Trans-Tasman travel bubble open up between Australia and  New Zealand. Pictured are tourists taking a selfie at New Zealand's Milford Sound</p>

<p>'Without question, the past six months have been the most challenging period in our almost 40 years in business,' managing director James Kavanagh said in a statement on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>'Never before had we imagined – let alone faced – a scenario whereby all discretionary travel would be halted for a prolonged period. </p>

<p>'We are incredibly sorry that some of our great people are not able to continue on their Flight Centre journey with us at this time but we are taking steps to preserve as many roles as possible for the future, while building a smaller but stronger overall network.' </p>
