<p>The US chief of naval operations underwent heart surgery after suffering a medical episode during a run near his home, officials disclosed on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Admiral Mike Gilday, 57, had 'become ill' while running on the Washington Naval Yard, where he lives, on August 10, sources told the Wall Street Journal. </p>

<p>Gilday was assisted by a Marine and was treated by his physician immediately after. He underwent heart surgery two weeks later.    </p>

<p>The Navy chief is now in 'good condition' and returned to full duty at his post at the Pentagon on Monday, spokesman Commander Nathan Christensen told the publication. </p>

<p>Gilday is pictured far right during a COVID-19 press briefing at the White House in April, alongside President Trump, Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien</p>

<p>Navy officials did not disclose Gilday's medical condition due to privacy reasons but said the incident stemmed from a 'pre-existing' issue. </p>

<p>A source revealed Gilday had already been scheduled to undergo the procedure, which was expedited after the incident in August. </p>

<p>The admiral was expected to speak at the 'State of the Navy' virtual event scheduled for Friday that has been postponed to October 13, Defense One tweeted. </p>

<p>Officials however, said the change in date is not connected to Gilday's medical issue.</p>

<p>Gilday, who was nominated for his role by President Trump in 2019, made headlines earlier this year over his response to the coronavirus outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt where more than 1,000 sailors became ill with COVID-19. </p>
