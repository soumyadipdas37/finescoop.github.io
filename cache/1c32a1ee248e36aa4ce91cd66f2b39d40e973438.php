<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Conor McGregor has coming out swinging online once again, branding Daniel Cormier a 'fat fool' for doubting that he's been chasing fights before agreeing a charity bout with Dustin Poirier.</p>

<p>McGregor shared a number of private messages between himself and UFC president Dana White showing how hard he was pushing for match-ups earlier this year before announcing his retirement in frustration at the lack of activity. </p>

<p>But Cormier, who recently retired after the trilogy fight defeat by Stipe Miocic, cast doubt over whether the 'Notorious' was telling the truth. </p>

<p>Daniel Cormier doubts Conor McGregor's claims that he wanted to fight anyone this year</p>

<p>McGregor beat Donald Cerrone in January and said he wanted four more fights this year</p>

<p>The American, speaking on the DC &amp; Helwani show, said: 'Conor is trying to use a guy like you (Helwani) to prove that he would fight anybody. We just talked about Diego (Sanchez) being done and the biggest star in UFC history is saying he'll fight him. </p>

<p>'If you say you're fighting Diego Sanchez is fighting anybody... the reality is Conor ain't fighting anybody, it has to be the right fight. </p>

<p>'If Conor was fighting anybody, he would have agreed to be the replacement guy for Khabib Nurmagomedov vs Tony Ferguson. If he was willing to fight anyone right, he would agree to that. Conor is just saying it like he wants to be in the octagon, and if he wants to be in the octagon, let's get him in there. </p>

<p>'The reality is, if you're the back-up and Khabib vs Ferguson is scheduled, you're actually fighting because we all know that fight never happens. Conor is a bigger star than anyone, I'm just trying to prove to you, if this was real, he was going to fight anyone at any time, that would have been the case.' </p>

<p>McGregor leaked messages online between himself and Dana White from earlier this year</p>

<p>Underneath the clip shared on Twitter, McGregor responded in no uncertain terms. </p>

<p>He wrote: 'I asked for May you fat fool, what you saying? I fought in January and tried to go again but was purposely held back to be an alternate for a July fight. Wait 7 whole f****** months and “maybe” I’d get to fight? Are you stupid? What are you saying mate? I asked for May vs ANYONE!</p>

<p>'I asked for all these fights on February the 13th!! Corona didn’t exist. May/Anyone! August, Dublin/Diego(Just fought that night) End Of year/rematch. 4 fights/1 year. I was held back to wait it out to be an alternate for a fight many months away. There’s no other way to see this. </p>

<p>'While then thrown under the bus saying that I turned down a fight with Tony after khabib had bottled it. Lol at that one. The deciphering abilities of people in this business absolutely baffles me! It’s clear as f****** day!'</p>

<p>Interestingly, fellow lightweight contender Dustin Poirier commented: 'Conor?' </p>

<p>Dustin Poirier (right) wants a fight but the UFC are not paying him what he feels he is worth</p>

<p>Poirier is looking for a fight but rejected the UFC's terms for a match-up with Ferguson as he felt he wasn't being paid his value. </p>

<p>McGregor then suggested a charity match-up between the two of them outside of the remit of the UFC. </p>

<p>The Irishman wrote: 'Hey bro! You want to do an MMA charity fight? Zero to do with the UFC. I will donate half a mill towards your charity for it. Sell it on ppv or work a tv deal and we work out other charities that are close to my heart also. I am engaged in many. Strictly a charity “exhibition”.</p>

<p>'December 12th in the Point depot, Ireland. No weigh ins. Open weight, unified rules. I will arrange all travel fare for you and family. McGregor Sports and Entertainment MMA, in association with The Good Fight Foundation. Charity Mixed Martial Arts!'</p>

<p>Poirier suffered defeat by McGregor earlier in his career but has since dramatically improved and lost the title fight with Khabib last year. </p>

<p>McGregor claims he will be fighting legendary boxer Manny Pacquiao later this year </p>

<p>He asked if the exhibition would be in boxing, but McGregor responded that it will be MMA. </p>

<p>The former two-weight UFC champion is also planning to fight Manny Pacquiao in a huge boxing match later this year. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen if he will be able to jump through the legal loopholes from his UFC contract to be able to do so but the Filipino fighter confirmed he has given the green light for the contest.  </p>
