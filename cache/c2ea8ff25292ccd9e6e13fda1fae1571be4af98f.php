<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Auckland's tough Stage Three lockdown will come to an end tonight after several extensions, but life won't yet return to a pre-COVID normal.</p>

<p>From 11.59pm on Sunday, restrictions in New Zealand's most populous city will be eased after two-and-a-half weeks to a Stage Two warning, like the rest of the nation.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern made the announcement on Sunday afternoon as she confirmed a further two coronavirus cases linked to the Auckland cluster.</p>

<p>But the eased restrictions won't look exactly the same as they do for the rest of the nation.</p>

<p>A further two COVID-19 cases were identified in New Zealand on Sunday, both linked to the Auckland cluster</p>

<p>Aucklanders will be subject to temporary 'Stage 2.5' restrictions, officials said.</p>

<p>Authorities will continue to stress the importance of wearing face masks where possible - without making them mandatory - and discourage non-essential public gatherings.</p>

<p>Mask use is only mandatory on public transport for commuters aged 12 and above in Auckland, and that policy will remain under level 2.5 restrictions.</p>

<p>Social gatherings will remain limited to 10 people, despite Stage Two lockdown in the rest of the nation allowing gatherings of up to 100.   </p>

<p>'No gathering can be larger than 10. I cannot stress how important this is. Much of this cluster has stemmed from social gatherings. If we want to stop the spread, we have to stop socialising for a time,' Ms Ardern said on Sunday.</p>

<p>'We are also keeping aged care facilities in Auckland on very strict settings. To those this affects, I am sorry. I know how hard this will be but we need to keep everyone in our aged care facilities safe,' Ms Ardern added.</p>

<p>The restrictions remain in place throughout Auckland, but the prime minister has urged anybody from the region who is travelling to exercise caution and 'common sense'.</p>

<p>'If you are an Aucklander, please don't just pop into an aged care facility no matter where it is in the country,' she said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Sunday Auckland would enter a 'level 2.5' lockdown to ease out of Stage Three</p>

<p>'Please don't attend a mass gathering, even if it is not in Auckland. And if you are sick, please stay home. Definitely don't travel.' </p>

<p>There are now 135 cases linked to the Auckland cluster, and Ms Ardern told the public she highly doubted the virus had spread into other cities.</p>

<p>'We are still dealing with a single source, and a single cluster,' she said.</p>

<p>But the PM, who has acted swiftly at every stage of the pandemic, insisted she wouldn't hesitate in locking down the community again if she considered it necessary.</p>

<p>'We need the team of five million to help us get back where we need to be. Our system is only as good as our people,' Ms Ardern said. </p>
