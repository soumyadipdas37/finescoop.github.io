<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Traces of phosphine gas detected in the clouds above Venus could be an indication that the planet supports microbial life, a study has concluded.</p>

<p>On Earth, phosphine — a colourless gas that smells like garlic, or decaying fish — is naturally produced mainly by certain microorganisms in the absence of oxygen.</p>

<p>It can also be released in small amounts from the breakdown of organic matter, or industrially synthesised in chemical plants.</p>

<p>Experts from the UK, however, found signs of phosphine in Venus' atmosphere — suggesting the planet must support unknown chemical processes, or even life.</p>

<p>The second-closest planet to the Sun, Venus is inhospitable — with a surface temperature around 867°F (464°C) and pressure 92 times that of on the Earth.</p>

<p>However, its upper cloud deck — 33–38 miles (53–62 kilometres) above the surface — is a more temperate 120°F (50°C), with a pressure equal to that at Earth sea level.</p>

<p>The clouds are also highly acidic — meaning that the phosphine would be broken down very quickly and must therefore be being continually replenished.</p>

<p>The researchers have cautioned, however, that life is only one possible explanation for the source of the phosphine — with further investigation needed.</p>

<p>NASA is presently considering two missions to Venus that propose to study the planet's atmosphere and geochemistry — dubbed 'DAVINCI' and 'VERITAS'.</p>

<p>Traces of phosphine gas detected in the clouds above Venus, seen here in an image taken by NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft — could be an indication that the planet supports microbial life</p>

<p>In their study, astronomer Jane Greaves of Wales' Cardiff University and colleagues observed Venus using both the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at Hawaii's Mauna Kea Observatory and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile.</p>

<p>They detected a so-called spectral signature that is unique to phosphine — and furthermore were able to estimated that the gas is present in Venus' clouds in an abundance of around 20 parts-per-billion.</p>

<p>The team explored assorted ways that the gas could have been produced in this setting — including from sources on the surface of the planet, micrometeorites, lightning, or chemical processes happening within the clouds themselves.</p>

<p>However, they were unable to determine exactly what is the source of the detected trace quantities of the gas.</p>

<p>The researchers have cautioned that the detection of phosphine is not itself robust evidence for alien microbial life — and only indicates that potentially unknown geological or chemical processes are occurring on the planet.</p>

<p>Further observations and modelling will be needed, they added, to better explore the origin of the gas in the planet's atmosphere.</p>

<p>'Phosphine could originate from unknown photochemistry or geochemistry — or, by analogy with biological production of phosphine on Earth, from the presence of life,' the research team wrote in their paper.</p>

<p>'If no known chemical process can explain phosphine within the upper atmosphere of Venus, then it must be produced by a process not previously considered plausible for Venusian conditions,' they added.</p>

<p>'This could be unknown photochemistry or geochemistry — or possibly life.'</p>

<p>'Even if confirmed, we emphasise that the detection of phosphine is not robust evidence for life, only for anomalous and unexplained chemistry.'</p>

<p>The researchers detected a so-called spectral signature (pictured) that is unique to phosphine — furthermore were able to estimated that the gas is present in Venus' clouds in an abundance of around 20 parts-per-billion. However, they were unable to determine the exactly source of the detected trace quantities of the gas</p>

<p>'There are substantial conceptual problems for the idea of life in Venus's clouds — the environment is extremely dehydrating as well as hyperacidic.</p>

<p>'However, we have ruled out many chemical routes to phosphine, with the most likely ones falling short by four to eight orders of magnitude.'</p>

<p>'To further discriminate between unknown photochemical and/or geological processes as the source of Venusian phosphine, or to determine whether there is life in the clouds of Venus, substantial modelling and experimentation will be important.'</p>

<p>'Ultimately, a solution could come from revisiting Venus for in situ measurements or aerosol return.'</p>

<p>The second-closest planet to the Sun, Venus is inhospitable — with temperatures on its surface (pictured, as imaged by the Magellan spacecraft) of around 867°F (464°C) and pressures 92 times that of on the Earth. However, its upper cloud deck — 33–38 miles  above the surface — is a more temperate 120°F (50°C), with a pressure equal to that at Earth sea level</p>

<p>'This is one of the most exciting signs of the possible presence of life beyond Earth I have ever seen — and certainly from the most surprising location I could imagine,' said astronomer Alan Duffy, who was not involved in the present study.</p>

<p>'Our twin planet Venus is a hellish world,' added the expert from the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

<p>'While the surface is hot enough to melt lead, the temperature drops as you go higher into the clouds, becoming Earth-like in both temperature and pressure by an altitude of 50 kilometres [31 miles], exactly where the phosphine was found.'</p>

<p>'While the temperature is benign, the clouds contain sulphuric acid which should break down the phosphine,' he continued.</p>

<p>This, he explained, means that 'something is forming it anew — and as phosphine is associated with life on Earth, it is tempting to think it could be life on Venus.'</p>

<p>'But before we can become more confident about that we have to rule out all possible other non-biological means of producing it.'</p>

<p>The full findings of the study were published in the journal Nature Astronomy.</p>

<p>Discovery of pulsars</p>

<p>British astronomer Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell was the first person to discover a pulsar in 1967 when she spotted a radio pulsar.</p>

<p>Since then other types of pulsars that emit x-rays and gamma rays have also been spotted.</p>

<p>Pulsars are essentially rotating, highly magnatised neutron stars but when they were first discovered it was believed they could come from aliens.</p>

<p>'Wow!' radio signal</p>

<p>In 1977, an astronomer looking for alien life in the nigh sky above Ohio spotted a powerful radio signal so strong that he excitedly wrote 'Wow!' next to his data.</p>

<p>In 1977, an astronomer looking for alien life in the nigh sky above Ohio spotted a powerful radio signal so strong that he excitedly wrote 'Wow!' next to his data</p>

<p>The 72-second blast, spotted by Dr Jerry Ehman through a radio telescope, came from Sagittarius but matched no known celestial object.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists have since claimed that the 'Wow! signal', which was 30 times stronger than background radiation, was a message from intelligent extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>Fossilised martian microbes</p>

<p>In 1996 Nasa and the White House made the explosive announcement that the rock contained traces of Martian bugs.</p>

<p>The meteorite, catalogued as Allen Hills (ALH) 84001, crashed onto the frozen wastes of Antarctica 13,000 years ago and was recovered in 1984. </p>

<p>Photographs were released showing elongated segmented objects that appeared strikingly lifelike.</p>

<p>However, the excitement did not last long. Other scientists questioned whether the meteorite samples were contaminated. </p>

<p>They also argued that heat generated when the rock was blasted into space may have created mineral structures that could be mistaken for microfossils. </p>

<p>Behaviour of Tabby's Star in 2005 </p>

<p>The star, otherwise known as KIC 8462852, is located 1,400 light years away and has baffled astonomers since being discovered in 2015.</p>

<p>It dims at a much faster rate than other stars, which some experts have suggested is a sign of aliens harnessing the energy of a star.</p>

<p>Recent studies have 'eliminated the possibility of an alien megastructure', and instead, suggests that a ring of dust could be causing the strange signals.</p>

<p>Exoplanets in the Goldilocks zone in 2015 </p>

<p>In February this year astronomers announced they had spotted a star system with planets that could support life just 39 light years away.</p>

<p>Seven Earth-like planets were discovered orbiting nearby dwarf star 'Trappist-1', and all of them could have water at their surface, one of the key components of life.</p>

<p>Three of the planets have such good conditions, that scientists say life may have already evolved on them. </p>

<p>Researchers claim that they will know whether or not there is life on any of the planets within a decade, and said 'this is just the beginning.' </p>
