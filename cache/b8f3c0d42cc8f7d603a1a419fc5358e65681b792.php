<p>The 'spectacular find' was unearthed by an international team of palaeontologists preserved inside a female ostracod – a type of tiny crustacean that resembles a mussel.</p>

<p>Researchers believe the female mated shortly before becoming trapped in the resin.</p>

<p>They say the findings provide 'an extremely rare opportunity' to learn more about the evolution of the reproduction process in animals.</p>

<p>Until now, the oldest known fossilised animal sperm was thought to have been found in a 50-million-year-old worm cocoon from Antarctica.</p>

<p>The researchers say the ostracod specimen belongs to a new species, dubbed Myanmarcypris hui.</p>

<p>They believe these creatures lived on the coast as well as inland waters of what is now Myanmar, surrounded by trees that produced huge quantities of resin.</p>

<p>Scientists have discovered what they believe to be the oldest fossilised animal sperm from around 100 million years ago</p>

<p>A team led by Dr Renate Matzke-Karasz, a geobiologist at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich, analysed 39 specimens of ostracods trapped in a tiny piece of amber using 3D X-ray reconstructions.</p>

<p>The researchers discovered ripe giant sperm stored in a pair of sperm receptacles inside the female ostracod, waiting for the eggs to mature, in what could also be the earliest direct evidence of a completed insemination.</p>

<p>While a majority of male animal species, including humans, produce very large quantities of very small sperm to increase chances of fertilisation, there are exceptions.</p>

<p>Some creatures, such as fruit flies and modern-day ostracods, produce a small number of oversized sperm, with tails several times longer than the animal itself.</p>

<p>In these cases, the researchers say, chances of fertilising an ovum can increase with the size of the sperm cell.</p>

<p>Knowing more about how giant sperm cells evolved could shed light on what the researchers describe as 'ancient and advanced instance of evolutionary specialisation'.</p>

<p>They say the findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, provide 'an extremely rare opportunity' to learn more about the evolution of the reproduction process</p>

<p>'The most significant part of our story is that we can now show that using giant sperm for reproduction is something that can last long in Earth history,' Dr Matzke-Karasz told the PA news agency.</p>

<p>'Previously, we were not sure if animals that 'switched' to using these giant sperm at a certain point in their evolutionary history [were] doomed to become extinct very quickly,' she explained.</p>

<p>'After all, these are enormous costs for the animals — large sperm must be produced, the reproductive organs are much bigger than in other species, they take up a lot of space in the animal and mating lasts long.'</p>

<p>'This is a lot of biological energy that must be allocated to reproduction — so you might think that this doesn't make sense from an evolutionary standpoint.'</p>

<p>'But in ostracods, it seemed to work for more than 100 million years,' she added.</p>

<p>'From an evolutionary point of view, sexual reproduction with the aid of giant sperm must, therefore, be a thoroughly profitable strategy.'</p>

<p>The full findings of the study were published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. </p>
