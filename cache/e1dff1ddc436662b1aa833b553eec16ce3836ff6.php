<p>Megan Fenwick, 26, was a sleepover with best friend Amy Smith, 26,  at her home in London, when her ex- boyfriend Mitchell Bains broke into her flat and attacked the pair.</p>

<p>She has been left with a scar on her face, after thug, Bains, 23, sunk his teeth into her cheek.   </p>

<p>In May, he was jailed for 20 months.</p>

<p>Now, Megan shares the details of their relationship in a bid to raise awareness for stalking.</p>

<p>26-year old Megan Fenwick was having a sleepover with her best friend when her ex- boyfriend broke into her apartment</p>

<p>Megan was left with scars on her face after her ex- boyfriend sunk his teeth into her cheek</p>

<p>Megan says Bains  dragged her by her hair to the door and repeatedly slammed it into her arm</p>

<p>She said: 'The night he attacked me was the worst of my life.</p>

<p>'If Amy hadn't have been there, I believe he would've killed me.</p>

<p>'I'm just glad I survived.'  </p>

<p>Megan and Bains met in August 2017 when she started a job in a car sales garage where he worked.</p>

<p>The pair hit it off and two months later they were a couple - almost a year later, in March 2018 the pair moved in together. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Megan was left with scars on her face after Bains sunk his teeth into her teeth</p>

<p> Megan added: 'At first, he was sweet.</p>

<p>'He made me laugh and everyone got on with him.</p>

<p>'But one night, on New Year's Eve, while we were at a party, some men hit on me and Mitchell nearly started a fight with them.</p>

<p>'When we got home, he punched the fridge.</p>

<p>'His jealousy was out of control.'</p>

<p>The following month, the couple attended a family member's wedding, when Bains got drunk and eventually confessed he had cheated on Megan. </p>

<p>The pair met in August 2017, when Megan got a job at the car sales garage he was working</p>

<p> She says: 'He blurted out that he'd cheated and then stormed out of the hotel room into the road.</p>

<p>'I was upset but wanted to talk things through.</p>

<p>'I followed him outside and he yelled at me and shoved me in the chest.</p>

<p>'At that moment, a police car pulled up and he spent the night in a cell.'</p>

<p>After that, Bains begged for Megan's forgiveness and she eventually forgave him.</p>

<p>Bains regularly got drunk and and started arguments, accusing Megan of being unfaithful.</p>

<p>Gradually he became more aggressive too.</p>

<p>Megan says: 'One day he came home with two pairs of boxing gloves.</p>

<p>'Thinking it'd be fun, we put them on and I jabbed at him playfully.</p>

<p>'But then he whacked my arm hard and it bruised.</p>

<p>'After that I hid the gloves under my bed.'</p>

<p>A few weeks later, Bains ordered a Taser gun online.</p>

<p>Megan says: 'When it arrived, he pointed it and threatened to shoot me with it.</p>

<p>'I was terrified.' </p>

<p>In October 2019, Megan decided she reached her limits and plucked up the courage to break up with him.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, he took the news well and moved out.</p>

<p>But, just days later, he began to stalk her.</p>

<p>For six months, he bombarded Megan with over 300 texts a week, even sending her flowers every day, begging her to take him back.</p>

<p>Bains was sending her more than 300 texts a week asking her to get back together</p>

<p> Megan added: 'He even turned up at my workplace and followed me in his car.</p>

<p>'I'd see him sitting in his car outside my flat, watching me-it was so creepy.</p>

<p>'I was forced to change my locks.'</p>

<p>Bains continued to stalk Megan, so she went to stay with her parents for two weeks.</p>

<p>But when she returned to her flat, she noticed Bain's van parked outside.</p>

<p>She says: 'I hurried inside my flat and reported him to the police who agreed to investigate.</p>

<p>'The next few days he posted love notes through my door and left flowers on my doorstep.</p>

<p>'He even threatened to kill us both if I didn't get back with him.'</p>

<p>Then, in March 2020, Megan's and her best friend, Amy, an events coordinator, were at her flat for a sleepover.</p>

<p>The stalker ex- boyfriend broke into Megan's flat while she was having a sleepover with her best friend</p>

<p>That night, the pair were jolted awake by Bains, who had broken into the flat.</p>

<p>Megan says: 'I woke up to find Mitchell stood over me.</p>

<p>'He dragged me by my hair to the door and repeatedly slammed it into my arm.</p>

<p>'Amy screamed for him to let me go, but he continued to hurt me.' </p>

<p>'He pushed me to the floor and started punching me in the face.</p>

<p>'Then he started to strangle me-I thought I was going to die.</p>

<p>'Moments later, he sunk his teeth into my cheek, ripping the skin.</p>

<p>'The pain was excruciating.'</p>

<p>Amy attempted to pull Bains off Megan, but he punched her away.</p>

<p>IT was then Bains pulled out a knife and started waving it at the pair.</p>

<p>Thankfully, neighbours heard the commotion and called the police who arrived shortly after and arrested Bains.</p>

<p>Paramedics arrived and treated Megan for a deep cut to her cheek, while Amy suffered bruised ribs and a torn ligament.</p>

<p>After leaving Megan scarred, Bains was jailed for 20 months in May at Derby Crown Court</p>

<p>In April 2020, Bains, of Alvaston, Derby, pleaded guilty to stalking, ABH, assault by beating, assault on an emergency worker and criminal damage.</p>

<p>He was jailed for 20 months, and given a ten year restraining order against Megan at Derby Crown Court.</p>

<p>Megan says: 'His sentence is a joke.</p>

<p>'He's already been released from prison after serving only a few months.</p>

<p>'I'm so angry, it was barely punishment for the horrific pain he inflicted on me and Amy.</p>

<p>'I've been left with a permanent scar under my left eye which is a constant reminder of that night.</p>

<p>'I just hope I never see his face again.'</p>
