<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bradley Cooper has revealed how he has been spending quarantine with his mother Gloria Campano and daughter Lea.</p>

<p>The actor, 45, was speaking with his A Star Is Born costar Anthony Ramos for Interview Magazine, where he revealed he had not left the house because of his mother's health.  </p>

<p>Bradley also said he had been 'running a one-man playschool' for his three-year-old daughter, whom he has been teaching how to swim in their bathtub.</p>

<p>'We have not left the house': Bradley Cooper has revealed how he has been spending quarantine with his mother Gloria Campano and daughter Lea (pictured with daughter Lea and ex Irina Shayk in 2018)</p>

<p>'I'm with my daughter and my mother and my two dogs, and we have not left the house. My mother is going to be 80, and she has a colostomy bag, so I can't let anybody in the house. And I can't leave the house, because if she gets it, it's over,' he said.</p>

<p>'We live in a little townhouse, thankfully there's a backyard. I'm running a one-man preschool. We get up, we do swim class in the bathtub.'</p>

<p>Bradley shares his daughter Lea with ex-girlfriend Irina Shayk, whom he split from last year after four years together.</p>

<p>In an interview with British Vogue earlier this summer, Irina discussed her relationship with 'B.'</p>

<p>'I can't leave the house': Cooper has been conscientious about remaining indoors on account of his mother</p>

<p>'I think in all good relationships you bring your best and your worst – it's just the nature of a human being. Two great people don't have to make a good couple. I think we've been very lucky to experience what we had with each other. Life without B is new ground,' she said. </p>

<p>Irina admitted to having moments struggling to acclimate to life as a single mother. </p>

<p>'It's hard to find a balance between being a single mom and being a working woman and provider. Trust me, there are days I wake up and I'm like, "Oh my god, I don't know what to do, I'm falling apart."'</p>

<p>Shortly before announcing their split, Bradley and his A Star Is Born costar Lady Gaga landed at the center of romance rumors following an intimate performance of their song Shallow at the Academy Awards.</p>

<p>Gaga has since denied the rumors.   </p>

<p>Bradley starred in and directed the 2019 hit film A Star Is Born, which saw him star opposite Lady Gaga and Anthony Ramos as a down-on-his-luck country singer.</p>

<p>Ramos was complimentary of Bradley during their Interview chat, referring to him as 'one of the greatest directors of all time.'</p>

<p>'First and foremost, people ask me all the time, "How was it working with Bradley Cooper?" I say, "He's probably one of the great- est directors of all time. That dude is one of the best teachers I have ever had the honor and privilege to learn under." If I could sit on the set with you and just learn, I don't even need to be in the movie. Just give me a seat, and I'll sit back and watch you work.'</p>

<p>Bradley has returned to work, despite the current waging pandemic.</p>

<p>The actor has been spotted on the set of the currently untitled Paul Thomas Anderson film in Encino, California these last few days.</p>

<p>Little is known about the plot except that is set in San Fernando Valley in the 1970s and follows a high school student who also works as a child actor.</p>
