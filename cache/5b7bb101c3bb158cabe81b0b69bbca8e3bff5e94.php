<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jurgen Klopp 'hates' the perception certain games matter more to Liverpool than others </p>

<p>Klopp faces Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta for the second time in three days on Thursday</p>

<p>And he confirmed he'll keep shuffling his pack for each fixture because of the demands on his squad.</p>

<p>Writing in his official programme notes for the Arsenal match, Klopp said: 'It is not a case of treating certain competitions as priorities over others. It's about managing the situation, the circumstances and the squad.</p>

<p>'It is likely we will make changes this evening but I hate that this is perceived in a way that certain games matter more than others. </p>

<p>'This game tonight matters like you wouldn't believe. We want to win it with all we have, but the situation and circumstances cannot be ignored.'</p>

<p>The German coach faces a selection headache with a number of key players ruled out of the match.</p>

<p>Liverpool assistant boss Pepijn Lijnders confirmed earlier this week that Jordan Henderson, Joel Matip and Kostas Tsimikas will not feature after failing to overcome their injuries in time. </p>

<p>Summer signing Thiago Alcantara will also be absent after testing positive for coronavirus.</p>

<p>Klopp added: 'I have over 20 players for each match who, in my opinion, are good enough and have earned the right to play, but the rules mean I can only pick 11 to start each time.</p>

<p>'This is the hardest part of management when you are blessed to have such an incredible group of players.</p>

<p> 'We played on Monday just gone and we play again this Sunday coming. </p>

<p>'We are fortunate to have players who can come in and our quality and approach not change even 0.1 per cent. For Arsenal I'm sure it is the same.'</p>
