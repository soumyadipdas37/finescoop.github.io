<p>In a Facebook post, Cast revealed that people had sent her messages claiming that she faked the whole incident. </p>

<p>'I read all your messages to me, even the private ones, I can tell you that this truly did happen and there is nothing fake about it.</p>

<p>'I do not wish to speak to anyone, it doesn't matter to me if it's a journalist who wants to put it out on the news, I will not put my family in danger by exposing myself any more than what I have already, besides the media will just twist my words.</p>

<p>In a Facebook post, Cast (pictured) said: 'If I need to do this again to protect my family and my neighbors, I will in a heartbeat do it again, except this time I will not be as nice as I was'</p>

<p>Cast continued: 'Some of you still think we're not being attacked. I found this individual walking in my property as I was driving in, all he had were some matches in his hand.</p>

<p>'I walked him out of my property at gunpoint and then when we got to some asphalt ground on the main road [where I] made him lay down while the cops arrived.'</p>

<p>She said: 'Had my husband been here he would have been dead. This criminal has got multiple warrants, one of them [for] assaulting a police officer.'</p>

<p>It's unclear if local police have charged the man. </p>

<p>The incident comes as California, Oregon (pictured) and Washington state suffer from historic wildfires that have burned faster and farther than ever before</p>

<p>The fires have caused hazardous air quality conditions in Portland, Oregon, Seattle and San Francisco</p>

<p>The incident comes just days after a man was arrested Portland for allegedly using a Molotov cocktail to start a brush fire. </p>

<p>Domingo Lopez Jr, 45, was arrested on Sunday for allegedly starting the fire. He was released just hours before he is accused of starting six additional fires early Monday morning.  </p>
