<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A family from rural New South Wales have begged Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for a border exemption so their son can return home from boarding school in the school holidays.</p>

<p>Gravesend mother Kate Warby's son Hunter is attending boarding school in Brisbane, 500km northeast from his family home in northern NSW.</p>

<p>Both Hunter and his family want the 12-year-old to come home for the upcoming holidays in two weeks, but strict Queensland border controls have made his return nearly impossible.</p>

<p>'We can't get to him at the moment,' Ms Warby told 2GB.  </p>

<p>'This is his first year away at boarding school and he would definitely be home to help his father and I and go and help his grandparents, aunties and uncles on the farm.</p>

<p>'He's a great help and we're going to miss him.' </p>

<p>Kate Warby (pictured) has pleaded for border exemptions for boarders so she can see her son Hunter in the upcoming school holidays</p>

<p>While Hunter is able to return home to Gravesend, a small country town 615km north of Sydney, he would be required to quarantine for two weeks on return to Queensland at great expense.</p>

<p>'Hunter is free to come home, we can get him home, yet to get him back we're going to be up for in excess of $7,000 to 8,000 for hotel quarantine and that's just not an option,' Ms Warby said.</p>

<p>'To hear it last night in his voice, he just desperately wants his father and I to be able to bring him home.'</p>

<p>Ms Warby said many Outback families in her district are struggling with not being able to see their children, despite having no cases or transmissions of coronavirus in the region.</p>

<p>She hoped political leaders could put themselves in her shoes and allow for travel exemptions for boarding students.</p>

<p>'We're holding onto hope that at the eleventh-hour compassion, empathy and just common sense will prevail at the end,' Ms Warby said. </p>

<p>'These kids need to come home and recharge. They need to see their families.</p>

<p>'They're coming out of a busy term, an uncertain year and they desperately need their families because there's no place like home.' </p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (pictured) has refused to change her border rules despite several dramas</p>

<p>Traffic queues at the NSW-Queensland border check point in Coolangatta on August 7</p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Tuesday revealed her state's border wouldn't open until at least October. </p>

<p>'We said we would review at the end of the each month and there has been no advice from the chief health officer to change what we are doing,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'll tell you what we're looking for - to keep Queenslanders safe, that's what we're looking for.'</p>

<p>Queensland's extreme border restrictions were highlighted last week after Ballina woman Kimberley Brown lost her unborn baby girl after she was forced to travel 750km for an urgent operation because she was unable to enter the state. </p>

<p>Despite problems with hospital admissions, Ms Palaszczuk said she would not be changing her border closure policy.</p>

<p>'Queensland will continue to have our borders closed to keep Queenslanders safe, I'm not going to be moved on this,' she said.</p>

<p>'Fundamentally the health of Queenslanders is my number one concern.</p>

<p>'We know that people wanted to open our borders earlier. We would have seen a situation that's happening in Victoria happening in Queensland.'</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been outspoken in his criticism of border closures and asked state premiers to commit to having their borders open by Christmas.</p>

<p>'Australia was not built to have internal borders. In fact the very point of federation was not to have them. That was the point of Australia,' he said.</p>

<p>'We must be one and indivisible as a nation. We must be Australians first and we must not allow this crisis to force us to retreat into provincialism. That's not the answer.'</p>

<p>Victoria:</p>

<p>Victoria is under strict Stage Four and Stage Three lockdown, meaning residents cannot partake in non-essential travel.</p>

<p>In addition to Victoria's own restrictions to stem the spread of COVID-19, every other state and territory in Australia has implemented border closures to keep Victorians - and the virus - out. </p>

<p>New South Wales:</p>

<p>New South Wales currently only has incoming restrictions in place for Victorians, meaning residents from every other state and territory are welcome to travel there.</p>

<p>But any person who has been in New South Wales is restricted from travelling to Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, and may be subject to quarantine if they enter South Australia, Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory.</p>

<p>Queensland:</p>

<p>Queensland's border is closed to any residents from New South Wales, Victoria and Australian Capital Territory.</p>

<p>Residents from anywhere else in Australia are welcomed to travel to the Sunshine State without restrictions.</p>

<p>Queenslanders are permitted to travel to every state except Western Australia, where a hard border closure remains in place.</p>

<p>When visiting Tasmania, they may be required to quarantine.</p>

<p>Tasmania:</p>

<p>Tasmanians are free to travel to any state, but may be subject to hotel quarantine when returning home.</p>

<p>Visitors from high risk areas are banned from entering the state, while people from anywhere else are potentially subject to hotel quarantine. </p>

<p>Western Australia:</p>

<p>Western Australia has a hard border closure in place.</p>

<p>Nobody can enter the state without an exemption.</p>

<p>South Australia:</p>

<p>The border with Victoria is closed, but people from Queensland, Northern Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia are welcome to visit.</p>

<p>Travellers from New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory can enter only after testing and quarantining.</p>

<p>Northern Territory:</p>

<p>The Northern Territory border remains open but anybody who has been in a hot spot like Victoria or parts of New South Wales must undertake 14 days hotel quarantine at a cost of $2,500. </p>

<p>Australian Capital Territory:</p>

<p>Anybody who has travelled to Victoria is barred from entering the region, unless they are an ACT resident.</p>

<p>Travellers from hot spots may be subject to quarantine, but travellers from any other states and territories can travel without restrictions. </p>
