<p>The NSW premier announced on Thursday there were three new cases in the state, two are in hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>The third is believed to be an old case but was added to Thursday’s numbers. </p>

<p>Hospitality leaders have been calling for restrictions to be eased to allow for double the amount of patrons inside a venue at one time. </p>

<p>The current one person per four square metre rule has been in place since May and has weighed heavily on the hospitality industry, with food and beverage sales down 60 per cent. </p>

<p>However, Ms Berejiklian was less than optimistic, saying residents 'should not assume this zero number is going to continue'.</p>

<p>Food and beverage sales have been down 60 per cent as a result of having just one patron per four square metres (pictured, friends visit a bar in Sydney)</p>

<p>'We know the disease is lurking in the community so I don’t want anyone to be surprised if tomorrow or the day after we get cases of community transmission.' </p>

<p>The Australian Hotels Association said increasing the number of customers could allow for 15,000 new jobs in the hospitality sector.</p>

<p>The one person per two square metre rule has already been taken on in South Australia and Western Australia.</p>

<p>Queensland allows more patrons in venues under 200 square metres.</p>

<p>As NSW is about to enter into school holidays, the matter surrounding patrons will be highly considered if there is no new spike in infections. </p>

<p>More to come </p>

<p>Clubs and pubs are hoping to double the amount of patrons allowed inside after NSW went two days without any new coronavirus cases (pictured two women enjoy at drink at the Royal Hotel in Sydney)</p>
