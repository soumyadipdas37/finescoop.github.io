<p>Salma has been reflecting on her stellar career recently, admitting that she has been delighted to have filmmakers approach her for roles in recent years after starting her career trying to get them to cast her in their movies.</p>

<p>Time flies: Writing alongside the stunning snap, Salma, 54, who shares Valentina with her husband François-Henri Pinault, 58, gushed that time had flown since her pregnancy (pictured with Valentina in 2019)</p>
