<p>After saying she would not reveal the father to save herself 'a lot of' headaches on an Instagram Story in July, she later confirmed the child was Bow Wow's, when asked directly.  </p>

<p>Bow Wow raps: 'I don't know what to say / That's gonna be one of them talks we have face to face / I'm looking in his eyes, I'm trying to see me in 'em / I'm peeping on the swag and see the resemblance / Seen the boy three times, why would I lie? / Baby mom brings him through so we can spend some time / And if he's mine, I'm stepping up / Kobe set that example, you know I send my blessings up / I told you dealing with me was going to be hard to do (facts).'  </p>
