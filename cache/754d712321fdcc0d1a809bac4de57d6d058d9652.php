<p>The reality star, 23, who is expecting her first child with boyfriend Sammy Kimmence, admitted she feels anxious about welcoming her baby into the world amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>As she prepares to enter motherhood, the Love Island 2018 winner also revealed she spends 'most days' in her nightwear and only manages to do her hair 'once or twice a week' after revealing she suffers from crippling fatigue.</p>

<p>'I only do my hair once or twice a week!' Dani Dyer relaxed in her PJs as she shared a candid Instagram post about her pregnancy on Wednesday</p>

<p>The actress uploaded images of herself cradling her baby bump while sporting maternity Amour slogan co-ords by New Look. </p>

<p>Detailing how she's coping in the second trimester, the media personality shared: 'This really is me most days in my pyjamas trying to get organised but also feeling the biggest anxiety of what is happening in this world right now.</p>

<p>'But I thought I'd show you that the hair really is only done once maybe twice a week (hardly) happy Wednesday everyone x.' (sic)</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the TV star confessed that while she loves being pregnant, she's constantly worrying about the health of her baby.</p>

<p> New chapter: The reality star, 23, is expecting her first child with stockbroker boyfriend Sammy Kimmence, 24</p>

<p>'I have the biggest anxiety about what's going on in the world': The reality star, 23, admitted she feels anxious about welcoming her baby amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic </p>

<p>In another honest social media message, the blonde confessed she spent her whole first trimester on the phone to her doctor for reassurance and since being diagnosed with an anterior placenta, her worries have only increased.</p>

<p>The daughter of actor Danny Dyer said: 'Being a first time mum is such an amazing experience but also a worrying one. I find it crazy how I can love something so much that isn’t even here yet and all I want to do is look after it!</p>

<p>'Social media can paint a picture that being pregnant is so easy but the reality is it can be really tiring and hard sometimes. I've suffered from severe migraines, tiredness and I started going off so many foods when I first fell pregnant.'</p>

<p>Dani recently revealed she has an anterior placenta - when the placenta attaches to the front wall of the uterus.</p>

<p>'It's amazing but also worrying': Earlier this week, the TV star confessed that while she loves being pregnant, she's constantly worrying about the health of her baby</p>

<p>The reality star explained she was worried she 'wouldn’t be able to feel my baby move,' because of the condition, but she got reassurance from other mums and mums-to-be. </p>

<p>'This is when I got recommended to join the <?php echo e('@'); ?>peanut app, and it changed everything,' she wrote. 'Seeing women going through the same worries as me really made me feel more relaxed and understand that it’s normal to feel how I’m feeling.'</p>

<p>'The mums on the app gave me loads of tips, like laying on your side to help you feel more so the baby can kick against that rather than where the placenta is. I absolutely love being pregnant but it’s a constant battle of wanting everything to be perfect and for my baby to be healthy.'</p>

<p>An anterior placenta is when the placenta attaches to the front wall of the uterus. This is a normal place for the placenta to implant and develop.</p>

<p>However having this can make it a bit harder to feel movements as the baby is cushioned by the placenta.</p>

<p>Most women start to feel kicks between 18 and 24 weeks, but first time mums may not until after 20 weeks.</p>

<p>It can also make it more difficult to have some tests, such as amniocentesis, but not all women are offered this during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Having an anterior placenta can also increase the chances of the baby being in a back-to-back position before birth.</p>

<p>Always contact your midwife if you think your baby’s movements have slowed or changed.</p>
