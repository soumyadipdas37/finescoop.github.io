<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Joe Cokanasiga marked the end of his year-long injury ordeal with a trademark act of brilliance as Bath staged an astonishing comeback to maintain their title challenge.</p>

<p>Stuart Hooper’s side were 20-3 down with an hour gone and their hopes of reaching the Premiership play-offs appeared to be ebbing away.</p>

<p>But Bath turned the tables on their West Country rivals with a four-try blitz led by their front-rowers and capped by giant England wing Cokanasiga’s eye-catching assist, which earned a bonus point and lifted them to second place in the table.</p>

<p>Tries by Chris Harris and Matt Banahan, along with Billy Twelvetrees’ goal-kicking, had left Bath in the tightest of corners but they still managed to conjure their seventh victory out of eight games since the season resumption. </p>

<p>It means they will go to Saracens on October 4 knowing that their fate is in their hands and a semi-final is there for the taking.</p>

<p>The miraculous revival began in the 61st minute, from a lineout drive on the left, as England hooker Tom Dunn broke down the blindside and blasted over.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Dunn struck again from another pack drive and another Rhys Priestland conversion meant the gap was just three points.</p>

<p>Bath had become an unstoppable force. Seven minutes from time, Anthony Watson ran back a kick impressively and the outstanding Sam Underhill stormed through in midfield before another driving onslaught allowed Lewis Boyce to touch down.</p>

<p>That put Hooper’s men in front and there was a final flourish as Cokanasiga — on his first appearance since the World Cup, having recovered from a serious knee injury — swerved clear down on the left and his inside pass freed Ben Spencer to deliver the bonus-point try.</p>

<p>‘That step was box-office,’ said Hooper, of his returning replacement’s contribution.</p>

<p>‘It was a huge win for us.’</p>

<p>Scrum-half Ben Spencer crossed over for Bath's fourth try of the game and a bonus point</p>
