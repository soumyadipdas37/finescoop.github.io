<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester City will finalise the £64million signing of Benfica defender Ruben Dias this week with Nicolas Otamendi travelling in the opposite direction for a separate £13.7m.</p>

<p>Dias captained and scored for Benfica in their 2-0 win over Moreirense on Saturday before hugging sporting director Rui Costa as he said his farewells.  </p>

<p>Talking to Benfica TV afterwards, the 23-year old said: ‘This was a special moment for me and I think everyone understands why. I'm very happy of course, it was a very important game for me and being able to mark this game with a goal was very special. I believe that everyone already has an idea of why I hugged Rui Costa.’</p>

<p>Manchester City will finalise the £64million deal for Benfica defender Ruben Dias this week</p>

<p>Manchester City's Nicolas Otamendi will go the opposite way for a separate fee of £13.7million</p>

<p>Otamendi, 32, is expected in Lisbon on Monday.</p>

<p>Benfica coach Jorge Jesus said: 'He's a player we're sorry to see go, he came through the academy, is our captain and plays for the national team. Otamendi is a player we'd like to have. Though the player who joins us will have to understand that my ideas are completely different from those at Manchester City.'</p>

<p>City moved for Dias after growing frustrated by Sevilla's valuation of Jules Kounde.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Barcelona remain interested in City defender Eric Garcia though may have to sell Jean-Clair Todibo before they can bid. Todibo has attracted interest from Everton and Fulham. </p>

<p>Barcelona have agreed to pay £18m to Ajax for right-back Sergino Dest. The deal put paid to the chance of Norwich City defender Max Aarons joining Barcelona though he has interest from Bayern Munich. </p>
