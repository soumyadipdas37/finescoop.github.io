<p>And the 37-year-old revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Tuesday there was one song she didn't want to sing without her mask on. </p>

<p>The Wicked star explained that she was glad that she wasn't eliminated after her performance of I Touch Myself last week, because she would have been too nervous to sing the tune without her costume on at the end of the episode.  </p>

<p>Nerves: On Tuesday, Lucy Durack (pictured) told The Kyle and Jackie O Show there was one song she didn't want to sing without her mask on</p>

<p>'You said you were so glad you didn't go out last week 'cause you didn't want to have to sing I Touch Myself with the head off,' commented radio host and The Masked Singer judge Jackie 'O' Henderson. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two agreed, saying: 'That's very true, I was like, "Oh my God, I'm not sure I have the confidence to sing this song not in a mask."'</p>

<p>She even admitted that she was worried about practicing the song at home in case her eldest daughter Polly, five, heard her. </p>

<p>Setting an example: Lucy admitted that she was worried about practicing the song at home in case her eldest daughter Polly (pictured), five, heard her and sang it at kindy</p>

<p>'I practiced a lot at home and my daughter, Polly, was listening to me,' she said. </p>

<p>'But I didn't practice I Touch Myself at home 'cause I was worried she was going to learn it and sing it at kindy.' </p>

<p>Thankfully, Lucy made it through to the next round and didn't have to sing the racy Divinyls' tune without her cactus costume. </p>

<p>Who is it! On Monday night's episode of The Masked Singer Australia, the celebrity inside the Cactus costume was finally revealed</p>

<p>However, she was sadly voted out on Monday night's episode following her performance of Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart. </p>

<p>Lucy wasn't at all upset at being voted out, jumping up and down and beaming when she pulled off the mask.   </p>

<p>'When you're behind the mask, it's so much fun 'cause you've kind of got this freedom to just have a go,' she said on the program.  </p>

<p>The Masked Singer continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten </p>

<p>Loves it! Lucy wasn't at all upset at being voted out, jumping up and down and beaming when she pulled off the mask</p>
