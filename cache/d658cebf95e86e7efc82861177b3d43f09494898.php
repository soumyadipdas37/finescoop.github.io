<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jimmy Kimmel had his work cut out for him when he returned to host this year's 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.</p>

<p>But the late night host rose to the occasion, which included several safety protocols, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>He walked viewers through some of the precautions taken during the awards show, as he broadcasted live Sunday with an empty audience at the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Safety dance: Jimmy Kimmel walked viewers through some of the precautions taken during the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, as he broadcasted live Sunday with an empty audience at the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles</p>

<p>The 52-year-old gave a tour of the stage, explaining: 'Here's how the show is gonna work... or not. We are attempting to do something that has never been attempted before, and for good reason.</p>

<p>'Instead of bringing the nominees to us, we went to them. We have live feeds to and from more than a hundred locations around the world. You know how hard it is to get your parents to FaceTime? Multiply that by a lot.'</p>

<p>He walked through a hall of screens, before taking a squirt of hand sanitizer from a bottle being held by one of the iconic gold Emmy statues.</p>

<p>Kimmel said: 'This is where the magic happens. This is the nerve center. As you can see, we've taken every safety precaution.</p>

<p>Never been done: The 52-year-old gave a tour of the stage, explaining: 'Here's how the show is gonna work... or not. We are attempting to do something that has never been attempted before, and for good reason'</p>

<p>Wash your hands: He walked through a hall of screens, before taking a squirt of hand sanitizer from a bottle being held by one of the iconic gold Emmy statues</p>

<p>Zoom meeting: Kimmel then walked up to a curved wall, featuring a giant grid of feeds from dozens of nominees and celebs</p>

<p>Standing by: He continued, as he addressed the star-studded guest list: 'They're all standing by. We've installed cameras and microphones in their homes. We've been watching you for weeks now'</p>

<p>He then walked up to a curved wall, featuring a giant grid of feeds from dozens of nominees and celebs.</p>

<p>The Jimmy Kimmel Live! host continued, as he addressed the star-studded guest list: 'These are tonight's nominees. Hello everybody! Congratulations! They're all standing by. We've installed cameras and microphones in their homes. We've been watching you for weeks now.'</p>

<p>'How many of you have already started drinking? Show of hands,' he took a poll, as multiple hands in the video grid shot up, adding: 'I feel like I'm in a Best Buy. This is wonderful.'</p>

<p>He continued to explain: 'So, here's how this is gonna happen. If you win, a guy will drive to your house and chuck the Emmy through your window, OK? No, we won't do that. But we will be connected to everyone throughout the show, hopefully.</p>

<p>'This is the show that will finally answer the question, "Does Alan Arkin know how to use a webcam?" This is a major undertaking. We have a hundred different feeds going all at once. What could possibly go right?'</p>

<p>Suit up: The COVID-19 precautions extended to the delivery of the awards, as they had a custom black tuxedo-style hazmat suit made for presenters</p>

<p>Magic box: Kimmel also revealed that his fellow nominees in the Outstanding Variety Talk Series category would each receive a 'magic box,' one of which would contain the award</p>

<p>No losers: He joked that his own black box would include a participation award, as he anticipated being passed over once again </p>

<p>In addition to Kimmel, he beat out Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee and Stephen Colbert, who tuned in from home while cuddling with his dog. </p>

<p>Stay gold: The Emmy ultimately went to John Oliver, his fifth consecutive year winning for his HBO show Last Week Tonight, which was presented with a golden confetti bomb and an animatronic hand, giving him his statue</p>

<p>Small bomb: The British comedian said in his acceptance speech: 'Thank you so much to the Academy for sending what's technically a small bomb to my house'</p>

<p>Stiff competition: In addition to Kimmel, he beat out Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee and Stephen Colbert, who tuned in from home while cuddling with his dog</p>

<p>Remote location: Late night legend David Letterman was on hand to virtually present the British comedian with the award, rocking a tux on the side of a secluded road in a remote country location</p>

<p>Oliver telecasted from New York, where he sat next to a big black box, anticipating the golden confetti bomb that came out with an animatronic hand, giving him his statue.</p>

<p>The British comedian said in his acceptance speech: 'Thank you so much to the Academy for sending what's technically a small bomb to my house. The way this year has gone, I honestly wouldn't have been surprised if this had blown this room up and caused a small wildfire here in New York.'</p>

<p>For the first time in its 72-year history, this year's show was telecast from the homes of presenters, nominees and winners around the world, keeping with COVID-19 safety protocols.  </p>

<p>Kimmel recorded live from the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles, while producers sent more than 150 video kits to other talent, for them to record from home. </p>
