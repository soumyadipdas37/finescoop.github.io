<p>Captioning the snap on Instagram, she wrote: 'Off for a dip in this beautiful place.' </p>

<p>Earlier this week Oliver, 32, revealed his tanned torso by going shirtless while planting a kiss on Pixie's cheek as they relaxed on the shoreline of the Greek island.  </p>

<p>Right decision: Pixie has made the most of relaxed travel restrictions by jetting to the Greek Islands with her hunky fiancé</p>

<p>The wedding to her model beau has been affected due to the coronavirus pandemic, so they have decided to wait and resume planning when lockdown restrictions have lifted completely.  </p>

<p>She said in an interview with The Sun:  'I’m a big family girl, a very big family girl. Family is everything for me so I would love to have my own family when I can find the time. When the time is right I would love that. It’s such an amazing thing to have. </p>

<p>'We were planning to have our wedding this year and now ­everything is so up in the air, we’ve just delayed it.</p>

<p>'There’s still a lot of planning behind the scenes but we are waiting for the time there are no restrictions and rules, because we don’t really want to have that on the special day.' </p>

<p>Beautiful: Rounding off her set of updates from Greece on Thursday Pixie shared a selfie, her naturally pretty features accentuated by subtle touches of make-up</p>
