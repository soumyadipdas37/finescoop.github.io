<p>And Tuesday was no exception, as Holly Willoughby was caught off guard by Lorraine during a video link segment on This Morning. </p>

<p>The presenter, 39, looked flustered as she realised she was on camera while shuffling her script, which her co-host Phillip Schofield, 58, then teased her about. </p>

<p>Oops: Holly Willoughby was caught off guard by Lorraine during a video link segment on This Morning</p>

<p>'Didn't catch you surprise that time then?', Phil said.     </p>

<p>To which Holly replied: 'I know, Lorraine totally caught me by surprise. We've got our new seating arrangement here so if I go like this, my hand disappears.</p>

<p>'My scripts are, I'm a complete mess and Phil's very tidy and neat, and my scripts look like they're vomited across the table, disappearing into the abyss.</p>

<p>Awkward gaffe: The presenter, 39, looked flustered as she realised she was on camera while shuffling her script, which her co-host Phillip Schofield, 58, then teased her about</p>

<p>Hilarious: 'Didn't catch you surprise that time then?', Phil said. To which Holly replied: 'I know, Lorraine totally caught me by surprise'</p>

<p>Messy: 'My scripts are, I'm a complete mess and Phil's very tidy and neat, and my scripts look like they're vomited across the table, disappearing into the abyss'</p>

<p>'And then Lorraine caught me! I didn't realise I was on, I was literally like "nothing to see here, look over there!".'</p>

<p>The duo are now using a clever split screen which makes it look like they are sitting next to each other, but in reality they are obliging to social distancing rules.   </p>

<p>The split screen baffled some viewers, while others said they loved it. </p>

<p>Holly took to Instagram ahead of the show to showcase her chic monochrome outfit. </p>
