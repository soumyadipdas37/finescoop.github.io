<p>Look of love: Denise Richards rang in her two-year wedding anniversary with Aaron Phypers this Tuesday on Instagram</p>

<p>In a string of pictures from their seaside ceremony Denise could be seen cuddling up to Aaron, who was once married to Nicollette Sheridan. </p>

<p>Aaron was 1970s California chic in a flowing white button-down shirt with several of the buttons left beguilingly open over his chest.</p>

<p>She could be seen in her Mark Zunino wedding mini-dress holding hands with Aaron in front of a huge infinity symbol made of roses. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Denise, the ex-wife of Charlie Sheen, had legs for days in her high-cut bridal mini as she hopped behind Aaron on a 'Just Married' motorcycle.  </p>

<p>All that sweet affection: The 49-year-old Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills posted an album of romantic throwback snapshots from their Malibu nuptials</p>

<p>Since the wedding Aaron has adopted Denise's nine-year-old daughter Eloise, whom she adopted in 2011 and who has special needs. </p>

<p>Denise has been seen on the currently airing season of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills staunchly denying Brandi Glanville's claim that they had an affair.</p>

<p>Brandi, who herself used to be a Beverly Hills Housewife, alleged that she had a dalliance with Denise last April.</p>

<p>At a group dinner in Rome, Denise blew up at her fellow Housewives whom she felt had relentlessly 'interrogated' her about the subject.</p>

<p>So in love: In a string of pictures from their seaside ceremony Denise could be seen cuddling up to Aaron, who was once married to Nicollette Sheridan</p>

<p>The meal deteriorated into a massive row where Denise slammed her co-stars as 'mean girls' and fled the table before a producer convinced her to come back.</p>

<p>This February she responded to an Instagram comment claiming she had an 'open marriage' and insisted that she is '100% monogamous to my husband.'</p>

<p>Last year the onetime Bond girl revealed that both she and Aaron got happy ending massages at her suggestion during their romance. </p>

<p>The blonde actress recently returned to Madrid to resume filming on the series Glow And Darkness after the shoot was put on hold on March because of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Vroom vroom: Aaron was 1970s California chic in a flowing white button-down shirt with several of the buttons left beguilingly open over his chest</p>

<p>Sadie, Sadie, married lady: Meanwhile Denise, the ex-wife of Charlie Sheen, had legs for days in her high-cut bridal mini as she hopped behind Aaron on a 'Just Married' motorcycle</p>

<p>Denise shares her elder two daughters - Sam, 16, and Lola, 15 - with Charlie, with whom she now has a friendly co-parenting relationship. </p>

<p>After they co-starred in the 2000 film Good Advice and she got a guest shot on his show Spin City in 2001, Denise and Charlie tied the knot in 2002.</p>

<p>Denise filed for divorce in 2005 and during their explosive split she accused him of making death threats against her, shoving her and endangering their children via his affinity for prostitutes and pornography, TMZ reported.</p>

<p>Charlie, who was reportedly once thrown out of the Plaza Hotel by police after trashing his room while on cocaine, is now HIV positive.</p>

<p>Family man: Since the wedding Aaron has adopted Denise's nine-year-old daughter Eloise, whom she adopted in 2011 and who has special needs</p>

<p>So romantic: One snap of their seaside wedding showed their rings lodged in the wet sand with a heart drawn around them</p>
