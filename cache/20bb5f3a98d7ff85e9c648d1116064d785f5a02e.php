<p>As a makeup artist and self-confessed beauty junkie Erin loved 'luxurious beauty shopping' and was 'sick' of doing all of her shopping in a health food store - but they were the only ones selling organic and cruelty-free items. </p>

<p>'I wanted to shop brands and products with safe ingredients that were sustainable and cruelty-free but I didn't want to compromise on results or the luxury look and experience of brands and beauty shopping,' she said.</p>
