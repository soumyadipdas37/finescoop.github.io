<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>After just one game into the new Premier League season, tensions are high again at West Ham and one of their owners has since admitted they could walk away from the club if fans continue their protests.</p>

<p>The Hammers have endured a summer of discontent and their misery was compounded on Saturday when they were convincingly beaten 2-0 at home to Newcastle on the opening day of the season.</p>

<p>Fans are furious once again with the direction West Ham are going in and are venting their frustration at David Sullivan, David Gold and Karren Brady after a summer of fall-outs mixed with no new signings.</p>

<p>West Ham owners David Gold (second left) and David Sullivan (right) are facing more protests</p>

<p>Pressure is increasing on the unpopular owners and vice-chairman Karren Brady (above)</p>

<p>Pressure has been mounting on the unpopular owners with some fans supporting the GSB (Gold, Sullivan, Brady) Out campaign. A small group of protestors unfurled anti-ownership banners outside the ground before kick-off at the weekend.</p>

<p>And on Monday, it was revealed on talkSPORT that one of the owners would consider walking away - claiming 'everybody has their breaking point.'</p>

<p>Host Jim White, speaking to Simon Jordan, revealed: 'Since we came on air, I got a call from one of the owners. And obviously they do not like it, the fact that in their eyes they are being hung out to dry, they are being persecuted. </p>

<p>'It seems by a minority of the West Ham fans that there was a protest before the game against Newcastle. Game number one and he says there was a protest of course at the stadium. </p>

<p>'But as well as that Simon, how telling is this? I said "are you going to walk away?". And the answer was "not at the moment, not at the moment. Everybody has got their breaking point but not at the moment".'</p>

<p>West Ham supporters have been protesting against the club's board for quite some time</p>

<p>The heat was turned up on the West Ham trio after former Hammers winger Trevor Sinclair criticised the board for not backing David Moyes in the transfer market.</p>

<p>Sinclair wrote on Twitter: 'If you can't or won't back Moyes and invest in players needed then sell. #GSBOUT.'</p>

<p>That Tweet on Sunday night followed his thoughts following the defeat by the Magpies on Saturday evening, where he said: 'Great transfer window for Newcastle and this was a must win for West Ham looking at our fixtures, long season ahead unless signings made.</p>

<p>'If #GSB haven't got the funds to invest in players why not sell the club to a buyer that has the funds and wants to resurrect our club.'</p>

<p>West Ham are the only top-flight club not to bring in a new recruit this summer and the scrutiny on the club's board has increased in recent weeks following the sale of Grady Diangana to West Brom.</p>

<p>Sinclair has criticised the board for not backing manager David Moyes in the transfer market</p>

<p>Sinclair aired his thoughts on the situation at West Ham following their 2-0 defeat on Saturday</p>

<p>Captain Mark Noble was left seething with the club after the winger was sold to a Premier League rival for £20million, explaining that he was 'gutted, angry and sad' in a Tweet.</p>

<p>Other players showed their support for Noble with Chelsea target Declan Rice liking his skipper's Tweet and Jack Wilshere also commented on Diangana's Instagram post.</p>

<p>But now things could get much worse for West Ham as they get ready for a daunting run of fixtures following their opening day defeat.</p>

<p>West Ham face seven out of last season's top nine in their next eight Premier League fixtures, starting away at Arsenal on Saturday evening. </p>

<p>The Hammers endured the worst possible start to the season following their home defeat</p>
