<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The mysterious deaths of 11 elephants in Zimbabwe may have been the result of bacterial infection, officials say.</p>

<p>Authorities had already ruled out two possibilities after the carcasses were discovered on Friday in Pandamasue Forest, between Hwange National Park and Victoria Falls, in the west of the country.  </p>

<p>The dead elephants were found with the tusks still on their bodies, meaning they were not killed by poachers, and cyanide poisoning has also been ruled out as a cause of the deaths.  </p>

<p>Today, Columbus Chaitezvi, principal veterinary officer at the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) said that, following preliminary tests, the agency suspected the elephants could have contracted a deadly bacterial infection while searching for food.</p>

<p>As the country enters the hot summer season, food becomes scarce and younger elephants tend to eat grass and burrow into the soil, exposing themselves to bacteria, he said.</p>

<p>'So far the laboratory indication is that it's a bacteria infection but we don't know what kind of bacteria it is,' Chaitezvi told Reuters.</p>

<p>Zimparks spokesman Tinashe Farawo said the dead were aged between five and six years and less than 18 months.</p>

<p>'You can see that those young ones can't reach for tree tops, so they end up eating anything, which in some cases can be poisonous,' said Farawo. </p>

<p>In recent years hunters in Zimbabwe have poisoned dozens of elephants and taken their ivory tusks to flog to illegal traders. </p>

<p>Blood samples have since been taken to a laboratory to determine the cause of their deaths.</p>

<p>Tinashe Farawo, spokesman of the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, said yesterday: 'We can only ascertain the cause of death after the tests but we have ruled out cyanide poisoning.</p>

<p>'Only elephants were affected, no vultures or any other animals were affected. Initial tests show that it is not cyanide. </p>

<p>'We are also ruling out poachers because the tusks were intact.'</p>

<p>The mysterious deaths of the elephants in Zimbabwe appears similar to the deaths last month of more than 275 elephants in neighboring Botswana. </p>

<p>Scientists are still investigating the deaths of the elephants in the Okavango Delta area with poaching, poisoning and anthrax all ruled out.</p>

<p>Botswana has the world's largest elephant population, estimated at 156,000 and Zimbabwe has the second largest, estimated at 85,000. </p>

<p>Last year about 200 elephants in Zimbabwe died of starvation as a result of the country's drought. </p>

<p>Gangs hunted and killed elephants and rhinos to feed an Asian demand for ivory and horns for use in folk medicines. </p>
