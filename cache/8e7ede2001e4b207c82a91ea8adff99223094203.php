<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Harmful levels of hydrogen peroxide in some energy drinks may explain cancer risk trends in the age group who consume them, a Monash University study has found.</p>

<p>Professor Louise Bennett, who led the study, says the levels of hydrogen peroxide in some energy drinks were found to be 15,000-fold higher than the natural levels produced in the body.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide is the chemical present in household bleach and hair dye.</p>

<p>'The research indicates that people are drinking diluted hydrogen peroxide when they consume some energy drinks,' Prof Bennett said in a statement.</p>

<p>'The long term effects may explain some cancer risk trends in the age group who consume energy drinks.'</p>

<p>Levels of hydrogen peroxide in some energy drinks were found to be 15,000-fold higher than the natural levels produced in the body (stock)</p>

<p>The body produces low levels of hydrogen peroxide - less than 0.0003 mg/kg - as a signalling molecule that can be inactivated by cellular processes.</p>

<p>The research, published on Thursday in Food Chemistry, notes hydrogen peroxide is usually used for sanitisation with residues of up to 5mg/kg allowed in food or beverage products in Australia.</p>

<p>In many countries, the permitted levels are lower at up to 0.5mg/kg.</p>

<p>The researchers analysed the levels of hydrogen peroxide in a range of commercial beverages and found that some chemical combinations of ingredients can drive this chemistry.</p>

<p>Prof Bennett hopes the research will lead to new standards for avoiding the production of hydrogen peroxide in these beverages.</p>

<p>'Our current research is addressing how to avoid or degrade the hydrogen peroxide,' she said.</p>
