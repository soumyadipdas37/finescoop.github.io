<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thousands of Australians have been selling risqué content on OnlyFans to make money during the coronavirus recession.</p>

<p>And a woman named Jasmine left her mother fuming on Monday when she joked that she was flogging her nude selfies on the platform.</p>

<p>In an Only Lying prank call on The Kyle and Jackie O Show, the woman told her mum she had become a porn star after her 'JobKeeper ran out'. </p>

<p>Shoot for the stars! One daughter told her mother she would be joining influencers like Luke Erwin (left) and Vanessa Sierra (right) by posting nude pictures on OnlyFans</p>

<p>'We're not getting JobKeeper anymore. I'm probably going to get back to four hours a week, so it's not that much money. So I was thinking of starting this thing called OnlyFans,' Jasmine said.</p>

<p>'Fans? What do you mean fans? We have air conditioning!' the mother responded.  </p>

<p>'Oh my god, mum! OnlyFans, it's pretty much you take nude photos and you get money for it. It's kind of like a porn site,' Jasmine clarified.</p>

<p>'Uhm hmm,' the unimpressed mother replied, before becoming more agitated by her daughter's indecent proposal.</p>

<p>Only funs! Jackie 'O' laughs during a segment were a young woman named Jasmine tells her mother she was resorting to OnlyFans because 'JobKeeper ran out' </p>

<p>'Doing what you're doing isn't the right thing to do - it's just the same as being a prostitute. I don't care, I don't care!' the mother said. </p>

<p>'The industry is the wrong industry. I don't care, I will never ever approve of you being a prostitute. Because that's what it is. It's prostitution. It is disgusting and it is the lowest form of life you could ever do!'</p>

<p>Jasmine then ramped up the prank call by asking her mother join OnlyFans too because her 'boobs are bigger' and they can produce content together. </p>

<p>'I beg your pardon? Jasmine, I don't know who put this stupidity into your brain. No!' the mother furiously responded.</p>

<p>Concerned? Kyle listened in disbelief as the mother went as far to disown her own daughter for posting nude photos, calling her a 'disappointment' </p>

<p>Things escalated when the mother vowed to disown her own daughter.</p>

<p>'I don't care, no matter amount of money. You are such a disappointment, you are not welcome in this house anymore doing stuff like that!' she said. </p>

<p>As things the phone call reached fever pitch, radio hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson interrupted and confirmed it was just a prank. </p>

<p>'It's only a joke. She's won herself $6,000 and no boob has been on display. Not an areola, not even a peak of nipple,' Kyle said.  </p>

<p>It was just a prank! The radio hosts eventually intervened, revealing that is was just a joke and Jasmine had been paid $6,000 for participating </p>
