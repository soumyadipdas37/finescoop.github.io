<p>The hooded assailant was videoed inside Wally’s Deli along East 223 Street in Wakefield shortly after 9pm on September 8</p>

<p>With a pistol clasped in his hand, the gunman unleashed a hail of bullets through the front window of the store at a group of people standing out-front</p>

<p>In the video, the gunman is seen staggering backwards and taking cover behind a potato chip stand, before cocking his pistol and firing it towards the store once again.</p>

<p>Bullets can be seen piercing bags of snacks all around the gunman in the returned fire, exploding the plastic and spilling confectionary onto the shop floor.</p>

<p>As the frightening exchange continues, a panicked cat is seen darting from under some shelves and running out of the back door to safety.</p>

<p>The gunman then follows in the cat’s footsteps out the rear of the store and later fled the scene, police say.</p>

<p>Incredibly, nobody was injured in the shootout but the deli owner reported property damage to store windows.</p>

<p>The scene has been described by some online as like a scene from the 'Wild West’. </p>
