<p>The Merseyside outfit pulled off the shock signing of the Real Madrid forward this summer, signing a two-year deal at Goodison Park. </p>

<p>It had been thought that Everton had paid as much as £20million to land the Colombia international, but it has now been claimed this is not the case.</p>

<p>According to Marca, a statement made by Banfield insisted that there was no fee involved.</p>

<p>Argentine club Banfield have revealed Everton paid no transfer fee for James Rodriguez</p>

<p>Banfield, who sold Rodriguez to Porto in 2010, were due a small percentage of the sell-on fee and chased up the details of the deal to find out what they would be entitled to. </p>

<p>However, the club treasurer Ignacio Urquiza said: 'Unfortunately for the pass of James Rodríguez from Real Madrid to Everton Banfield does not correspond to money. </p>

<p>'The transaction was made without cost, as if it were a free player. The pertinent consultations have already been made to the two clubs involved and to the corresponding organisations. </p>

<p>'In all cases they confirmed to us that the club will not receive money as a solidarity mechanism.'</p>

<p>Rodriguez has put an end to a trying spell at Real Madrid by making the move to Goodison Park</p>
