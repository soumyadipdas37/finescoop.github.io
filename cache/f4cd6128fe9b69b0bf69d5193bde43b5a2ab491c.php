<p>Journey: Alexandra Cane took to Instagram on Friday to share before and after snaps of herself as she reflected on how far she's come both physically and mentally over the past 12 months</p>

<p>In a lengthy, candid post, Alexandra opened up on her one year journey in which she has overhauled her lifestyle and overcome struggles such as anxiety, thoughts about death and an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. </p>

<p>The beauty also told how the past year had been 'confusing' and 'testing' for her, while also revealing that maintaining her lifestyle had been the 'hardest part' of her process. </p>

<p>She penned: 'WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES. This year has honestly been one of the most confusing, testing years of my life (and I think for a lot of others too) but my word has it taught me so many lessons that I will never EVER forget.</p>

<p>'This exact date last year I was seriously low and clasping at straws to find ways to get myself feeling better. To look back at where I was then and where I am now, it’s almost like I’m looking at two different people. </p>

<p>Changes: The Love Island star, 29, penned 'what a difference a year makes' as she shared a stunning bikini snap alongside images of herself with a more fuller figure</p>

<p>'Not even just physically, but mentally I know how far I’ve come. I had the worst anxiety, falling asleep thinking about death every night, zero purpose, zero motivation, in denial about my relationship with alcohol, food &amp; most importantly, myself.</p>

<p>'My life has been turned absolutely upside down - and for the better.' </p>

<p>Speaking further about her experience, Alexandra continued: 'All I wanted to do was strive to be the best version of myself. It’s been hard - I won’t sugarcoat it. </p>

<p>'The maintenance has been hardest part. Learning to trust myself whilst being in lockdown with minimal distractions, moving away from home, sick family members, wanting to raid the cupboard out of boredom, lack of human connection... </p>

<p>Struggles: The beauty also told how the past year had been 'confusing' and 'testing' for her, while also revealing that maintaining her lifestyle had been the 'hardest part' of her process</p>

<p>'Constantly having to remind myself WHY I started. Eventually the new habits I’d made have become a LIFESTYLE and I’m so proud of the person I’ve become. </p>

<p>'The fact I’m able to inspire others achieve the best version of themselves just fills me with so much joy &amp; so incredibly rewarding - it’s the best part.'</p>

<p>The social media star went on to inspire others to follow her lead and step out of their comfort zones and added that though she's 'never' be 'perfect', she always gives her 'best'. </p>

<p>She continued: 'It’s ok not to have everything figured out... just taking that first step is what matters. Having the courage to step outside your comfort zone might be the best step you’ll ever take!!!  </p>

<p>Her story: In an open and honest Instagram post, the Love Island star recalled the changes she's made in her life both physically and mentally and how it's helped her for the better</p>

<p>'It’s taken a lot of graft, patience, learning, understanding, trust, strength. But ultimately, the end goal has been worth every second. I am only just getting started. I’m not perfect, I never will be. But I will always give my best. And that’s good enough for me.</p>

<p>'Once you find out your ‘why’ things become a little clearer. Believe that you can. Trust yourself. Commit to yourself. YOU DESERVE IT!</p>

<p>'I can’t wait to continue this journey with you and give you everything I’ve got - knowledge, workouts, motivation, giggles.'</p>

<p>Alexandra's heartfelt post was met with a plethora of comments from fans who praised her for sharing her story.</p>

<p>She went on to say that her post was documenting not just her physical change, but her mental one too, stating that in the past she dreamt about death and her anxiety had got so bad that she was hospitalised. </p>

<p>The star then encouraged those who didn't resonate with her message to unfollow her as she noted: 'The mental growth means more than my physical appearance ever will'.  </p>
