<p>Regional data is different national employment figures, which fell from a 22-year high of 7.5 per cent in July to 6.8 per cent in August.</p>

<p>A total of 111,000 were created last month dashing fears of that unemployment would go into freefall. </p>

<p>National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster said the 111,000 new jobs created last month simply reflected a surge in the number of people identifying as self employed. </p>

<p>'There was a big spike in those that were basically self employed and not employing anybody,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Friday. </p>

<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia said on Thursday that recessions had 'enduring effects on unemployment rates.'</p>

<p>'Regions that experienced larger-than-average downturns had significantly higher unemployment rates for around a decade afterwards,' it stated on its website.</p>

<p>RBA added 'early 1990s recession led to an even wider range of outcomes, with regional unemployment rates changing by between -5 and 13 percentage points.'</p>

<p>'These differences in the "initial exposure" of regions to national recessions can reflect differences in industry composition, demographics and average skill levels, among other factor.'  </p>

<p>Wide Bay MP Llew O'Brien told The Australian towns within his electorate had 'really serious high unemployment and really serious youth unemployment'.</p>
