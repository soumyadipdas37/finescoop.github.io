<p>Brighton and Aston Villa are also interested in Diangana, who signed a six-year West Ham contract that runs until 2025 just last January.</p>

<p>Diangana made 31 appearances for West Brom last season, scoring eight goals and setting up six more to play a key role for former Hammers manager Slaven Bilic’s side as they won promotion back to the Premier League.</p>
