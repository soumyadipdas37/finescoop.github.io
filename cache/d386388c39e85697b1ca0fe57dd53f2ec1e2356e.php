<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Torino are still in the hunt for Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira despite Atletico Madrid's heavy interest, according to reports.</p>

<p>Torreira has fallen out of favour at the Emirates under Mikel Arteta and he could be on his way out this summer in order to raise vital transfer funds.</p>

<p>And according to Sport Italia and Calciomercato, Serie A outfit Torino are still very much in the hunt for the Uruguayan despite Atletico currently winning the race for his signature. </p>

<p>Lucas Torreira has fallen out of favour at Arsenal under Mikel Arteta and may be on his way out</p>

<p>It has also been reported that Torino directors are currently in London to negotiate a deal with Arsenal.</p>

<p>Once both sides can thrash out a deal, perhaps on loan with an obligation to buy, reports suggest agreeing personal terms should be relatively straight-forward. </p>

<p>Torreira enjoyed his best spell of football under Marco Giampaolo at Sampdoria and is now interested in a reunion at Torino. </p>

<p>The Uruguayan midfielder is reportedly keen to reunite with Torino boss Marco Giampaolo</p>

<p>The 24-year-old burst onto the scene in some style in north London but he now appears to be out of the picture under Arteta.</p>

<p>Torreira hasn't even made the bench for the Gunners in their opening two Premier League matches against Fulham and West Ham.</p>

<p>Arsenal may look to cash-in on Torreira to give them a spending boost in the summer transfer window, as they eye moves for top targets Houssem Aouar and Thomas Partey.</p>
