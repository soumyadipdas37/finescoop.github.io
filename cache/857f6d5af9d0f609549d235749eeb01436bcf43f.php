<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Crisp autumnal days were made for country walks. Add a pub with a crackling fire and a welcoming room to snuggle up in after your exertions, and you have all the ingredients for a cosy weekend escape. </p>

<p>These pubs all have great walks that start the moment you step outside their door.</p>

<p>A WILTSHIRE INN WITH GRANNY CHIC </p>

<p>Seasonal wonders: The grounds of the 2,650-acre Stourhead estate in Wiltshire</p>

<p>Wiltshire’s 2,650-acre Stourhead estate is home to both a Palladian mansion surrounded by beautiful landscaped gardens and to the Spread Eagle Inn. The latter may not have a Regency library or Chippendale furniture – its five bedrooms are more granny chic than 18th Century elegance – but it’s a cosy base from which to explore the National Trust estate.</p>

<p>No one bats an eyelid when you tramp muddy boots over the flagstone floor. Pub classics on the menu include the excellent Wiltshire ham, fried egg and chips.</p>

<p>Packed lunches can be provided.</p>

<p>Walk: Take the two-hour circular hike past an Iron Age hill fort to King Alfred’s Tower, a 160ft folly built on the spot where Alfred the Great was said to have rallied his troops before a battle in 878.</p>

<p>Book: B&amp;B doubles cost from £125 a night (spreadeagleinn.com).</p>

<p>A TOAST AFTER A HIGHLAND HIKE</p>

<p>Ramble on: A beautiful view over the Cairngorms National Park in Scotland </p>

<p>Just because you’re staying in the middle of the Cairngorms National Park doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy a bit of style. Cue the Fife Arms in Braemar, which is stuffed full of Victoriana and art – a Picasso hangs in the drawing room – and offers 46 sumptuous bedrooms.</p>

<p>A pamphlet details all the nearby hikes. Get the kids and dog out on a 30-minute loop, or try an all-day guided tramp that takes in a couple of munros (the Scottish name for a small mountain).</p>

<p>Return to toast your success with a choice of more than 180 whiskies in the bar.</p>

<p>Walk: The good news about climbing 2,818ft Morrone from Braemar is that you start at an altitude of 1,112ft. The four-hour circular route heads through a protected birch wood.</p>

<p>Walk: Stretching seven miles from Woodditton to Reach, Devil’s Dyke is an Anglo-Saxon fortification with a footpath on top. Make a day of it and recharge at the Dyke’s End pub at Reach, or cut the walk short on a circular trail.</p>

<p>Walk ten minutes from the Gurnard’s Head in Treen to the coastal path, and you can turn right for a four-hour walk to St Ives, with its Tate gallery, or turn left for a longer romp to Land’s End, past Botallack tin mine, which featured in the BBC’s Poldark. Either way, you can be sure of a comfortable night when you return, as the seven bedrooms all have luxury Vispring beds, Roberts radios and books (but no TVs). Settle down by the log fire in the shabby-chic bar, and tuck into a menu strong on local seafood.</p>

<p>Walk: Shorten the St Ives route and stop in Zennor to see the 12th Century church’s medieval chair with a carved mermaid, then pop into the Tinners Arms, before returning on inland paths.</p>
