<p>Earnings: Phil is said to have seen his earnings grow to £2.5 million last year according to Companies House accounts, after reportedly having £1.7 million the year before</p>

<p>According to the Daily Mirror, insiders revealed an extra £300,000 had been allocated to pay Holly and Phillip for their extra thirty minutes of hosting.</p>

<p>The presenting duo were previously paid £600,000 a year for their roles on This Morning, after Holly's pay was brought in line with Phillip's in 2017.  </p>

<p>Last month it was claimed the TV presenter saw his Fistral Production company's funds rise by £807,413 in the previous year, according to figures seen by The Sun. </p>

<p>Phil's Fistral Productions allegedly had a net worth of £2,544,296, broken down into £1,831,526 in cash, £1,247,758 in money owed to the firm, and £534,988 expenses.</p>

<p>After deducting the cost of his bills, the company recorded an impressive worth of £2.5 million at the end of November 2019, according to the publication.</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted Phil and Holly's representatives at the time. </p>
