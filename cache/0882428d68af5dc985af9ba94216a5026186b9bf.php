<p>Only Gonzalo Higuain's bank manager could be more happy than he is at the moment. His groundbreaking deal to join David Beckham's Inter Miami would come just days after he was paid £2.3million from Juventus to end his contract a year earlier.</p>

<p>I suspect that won't be the last we hear of this saga though. His release clause is only £111m and let's face it, another £20million to a club like City is basically pennies down the back of the sofa.</p>

<p>Real Madrid have been keen to offload the Welsh forward for over a year but are struggling to find a suitor to pay his £600,000-a-week wages despite offering to pay half as part of a deal.</p>

<p>The defender starred while on loan at the Italian side last term and is still hopeful of securing a move back to Serie A.</p>

<p>Sources close to Ashley say the owner has been told he has a strong case against the League and believes they did not apply the rules of their Owners and Directors Test correctly.</p>

<p>Still no more faces look to be coming in at Tottenham as far as strikers are concerned but potentially some loans out including promising young goalkeeper Alfie Whiteman.</p>

<p>Tempers were already simmering before the start of the season but West Ham supporters have even more of an axe to grind with the club's owners after a shambolic start to the season following a 2-0 defeat by Newcastle United at the London Stadium on Saturday night.</p>

<p>The Hammers have high hopes for goalkeeper Trott, 21, who has been earmarked to become the London Stadium club’s first choice in the long term.</p>

<p>Trott impressed on loan at AFC Wimbledon last season in his first taste of senior football and West Ham want the Bermuda-born England youth international to continue his development with another season of regular football.</p>

<p>The England star scored 17 goals and laid on 16 more for his team-mates as Dortmund finished as Bundesliga runners-up to Bayern Munich.  </p>

<p>He is set to be part of a devastating front line for the Bundesliga giants alongside forward Erling Braut Haaland, Thorgan Hazard and Julian Brandt.</p>

<p>Relegation from the Premier League will have really hurt the bean counters at Carrow Road, coupled with the financial impact from the coronavirus outbreak that affected many clubs.</p>

<p>Fulham were thumped 3-0 by Arsenal on the opening day of the season but there is some good news for Cottagers fans with Denis Odoi, Joe Bryan and Josh Onomah all agreeing new deals today.</p>

<p>Odoi has penned a deal until 2022, while Bryan and Onomah are now tied down until 2023.</p>

<p>Interesting debate, this. Is it right for teams to just go out and spend £200million, especially with all that has happened and is happening at the moment in football.</p>

<p>Or should we be encouraging more investment from owners in these times. Either way, Frank Lampard does have a point here regarding the common factor among winning teams...</p>

<p>It won't be a case of who wants him (who wouldn't?) but who can afford him? Right now it appears Real Madrid may have a headstart over their rivals.</p>

<p>Tottenham Hotspur clearly don't want Danny Rose at the club anymore but their new problem is who does?</p>

<p>The former England international was one of the best in the Premier League as recently as three years ago, now not even Newcastle want him following a loan spell last season. There has to be one club interested in him, surely?</p>

<p>West Ham slumped to a 2-0 home defeat on the opening day of the season to Newcastle United but Trevor Sinclair insists the board must be prepared to help manager David Moyes out with signings in the transfer window, or look to sell the club instead.</p>

<p>Pini Zahavi was the agent who helped broker the moves for Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United and Ashley Cole to Chelsea so this particular agent knows how to play the market.</p>

<p>Either way Bayern Munich may have to sell David Alaba this summer to generate decent value for the versatile star or risk losing him for nothing next summer on a free transfer.</p>

<p>The Chelsea misfit's career has gone downhill rapidly since moving to Stamford Bridge and he endured a torrid time in loan campaigns at Burnley and Aston Villa last season.</p>

<p>But now a chance to join Ranieiri at Sampdoria could present itself, having played under the Italian during Leicester City's title winning year in 2015-16.</p>

<p>Luis Suarez has been in talks with Juventus over the summer but he is no rush to leave the Nou Camp as he assesses his options. If staying at the Nou Camp is one of them, Ronald Koeman is prepared to freeze him out the first-team picture as he enters the final year of his contract.</p>

<p>The Bees midfielder was a crucial part in their march to the Championship play-offs last term and the Eagles are keen to complete a move with West Ham and Aston Villa's interest having dropped in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Getting a deal over the line is going to be tricky for Jurgen Klopp's side though as Borussia Monchengladbach have little intention to sell the defensive midfielder until at least next summer when he has a year left on his contract.</p>

<p>But talks looks set to continue between the clubs regardless as the Hammers are interested in landing full-back Emerson Palmieri given he has fallen down the pecking order following the summer arrival of Ben Chilwell at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>Emiliano Martinez looks to be heading to Aston Villa for first=team football and the Gunners of course will need a back-up to be called upon when needed.</p>

<p>Brentford keeper David Raya is also being considered as an alternative.</p>

<p>The former Chelsea striker is expected to complete a move at Villa Park by penning a three-year-deal.</p>

<p>It looks like Borussia Dortmund may be demanding a price so high that even Manchester United will not pay, but the Red Devils appear to have a Plan B, C and even D.</p>

<p>The Premier League season may be underway but that does not mean the time for transfers is over with clubs still having until October 5 to strengthen their squads. </p>

<p>So whether your team has come firing out of the blocks or endured a slow start we will keep you up to date with all the latest developments throughout the day.</p>

<p>Here, Sportsmail will provide live updates from the Premier League and European clubs as they continue to negotiate and complete signings during this summer transfer window.</p>
