<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor's Bella Varelis is tipped to one of Locky Gilbert's final two contestants. </p>

<p>But on Monday, the 25-year-old marketing consultant pretty much let slip that she is no longer with the adventure guide, 31. </p>

<p>Bella described fellow contestant Bec Cvilikas as her 'other half' on the show rather than Locky, hinting that their relationship is over. </p>

<p>'Bec was my other half!' Did The Bachelor's Bella Varelis (left) just let slip she's not with Locky Gilbert (right)? </p>

<p>'Bec was my other half. Once we met, it was like, yep, we're going to be friends,' Bella told New Idea.  </p>

<p>While Bella was only talking about her friendship with Bec, the use of the term 'other half' is telling since it is normally reserved for romantic partners. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bec said: 'The second we met, I knew we were going to be friends.' </p>

<p>Besties! Bella (left) said fellow contestant Bec Cvilikas (right) is her 'other half', which is an interesting choice of words a friend </p>

<p>Bella and Bec, both 25, remain close off the show and frequently hang out together.</p>

<p>The pair even wore matching outfits and went for a girls' breakfast with model Jordan Simek at White Rabbit in Double Bay on Sunday.   </p>

<p>They are two of just four contestants who remain on The Bachelor along with Irena Srbinovska and Izzy Sharman-Firth.   </p>

<p>All over? Bella and Locky enjoyed many dates together but the 25-year-old marketing consultant is rumoured to come second place on the show</p>

<p>While Bella and Bec are close friends, she has an ongoing feud with Irena, who is tipped to win Locky's final rose over her. </p>

<p>The women found it increasingly hard to be around each other as their feud escalated and numbers dwindled in the mansion. </p>

<p>An on-set source previously told Daily Mail Australia that the front-runners were separated by producers into different hotels at the height of the show's drama.</p>

<p>Pointy end of the competition: Bella (right) and Bec (second from right) are two of just four contestants who remain on The Bachelor along with Irena Srbinovska (second from left) and Izzy Sharman-Firth (left)</p>
