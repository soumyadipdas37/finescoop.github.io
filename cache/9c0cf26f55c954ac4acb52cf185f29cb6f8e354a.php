<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Scientists have created an army of microscopic robots, each smaller than the width of a human hair, that can be injected into the body to wage war on disease.</p>

<p>It resembles the plot of sixties film Fantastic Voyage in which a vehicle was miniaturised and then injected into a patient. Scientists inside the tiny vehicle then destroyed the patient's blood clot using a laser gun. </p>

<p>The new real-world micro-bots could monitor nerve impulses in the heart or brain or even deliver drugs directly into organs, according to scientists from Cornell University who created the machines. </p>

<p>The minute four-legged machines will enter the body via a hypodermic needle and travel through human tissue and blood using four electrochemical actuators that function as 'legs'. </p>

<p>An army of microscopic robots thinner than a human hair have been created that can be injected into the body to wage war on disease, researchers claim</p>

<p>The minute four-legged machines will also be able to move through tissue and blood after entering the body via a hypodermic needle. The picture shows the process the machines go through to 'walk' - they effectively twist back and forth to slowly edge forward or back</p>

<p>Lead author Dr Marc Miskin, who is now at Pennsylvania University, said: 'Controlling a tiny robot is maybe as close as you can come to shrinking yourself down.'</p>

<p>He said machines like this are going to allow humans to venture into amazing worlds that are 'too small to see' and could change medicine forever.  </p>

<p>They are the first robots smaller than 0.004 inches in size in which on-board electronics are used to direct them. </p>

<p>These robots provide a template for building even more complex versions that utilise silicon-based intelligence and can be mass produced.  </p>

<p>The walking robots are the latest iteration, and in many ways an evolution of previous nanoscale creations, from microscopic sensors to graphene-based machines. </p>

<p>This is an artist's impression of a microscopic robot with legs around the width of a human hair which are able to bend when hit by a laser light, creating a walk-like motion</p>

<p>Lead author Dr Marc Miskin, who is now at Pennsylvania University, said: 'Controlling a tiny robot is maybe as close as you can come to shrinking yourself down'</p>

<p>The legs, 'or actuators', bend when stimulated by laser light - causing a walking motion. In tests over a million were produced - on a 4-inch wafer of silicon.</p>

<p>The micro-bots are powered by solar cells and are made using a technique called photovoltaics - used at a larger scale in solar energy panels.</p>

<p>The legs are wired to several 'photovoltaic' patches on the robots central chassis and when an operator shines a laser on them they 'bend and unbend'. </p>

<p>This can alternate between bending the front and back legs by aiming the light on different patches - propelling the robot.</p>

<p>'They are robust, surviving highly acidic environments and temperature variations of more than 200 degrees centigrade,' explained Dr Miskin.</p>

<p>'They can be injected with a hypodermic needle - offering the potential to explore biological environments.'</p>

<p>Miniaturisation of electronics to produce cell-sized robots is a 'holy grail' of medical research but there has been a lack of smaller enough suitable systems. </p>

<p>The bots get round this problem. They are about 5 microns thick, 40 microns wide and 40 to 70 microns in length. A micron is a millionth of a metre.</p>

<p>Each consists of a simple circuit made from silicon - which essentially functions as the torso and brain. Four electro-chemical actuators function as legs.</p>

<p>It resembles the plot of sixties film Fantastic Voyage in which a vehicle was injected into a patient. Scientists inside destroyed his blood clot - with a laser gun</p>

<p>The researchers control the robots by flashing laser pulses at different cells - each of which charges up a separate set of legs.</p>

<p>By toggling the laser back and forth between those at the front and back, the robot walks and despite being cutting edge tech, they use a fraction of a volt in power. </p>

<p>They can survive the harshest of conditions, according to the researchers that designed the technology. The limbs of the microbots are also incredibly strong.</p>

<p>Each robot's body is 1,000 times thicker and 8,000 times heavier than each leg. </p>

<p>As they are manufactured from silicon, sensors will be able to measure temperature and electrical pulses.</p>

<p>Each robot's body is 1,000 times thicker and 8,000 times heavier than each leg</p>

<p>Dr Miskin's team at Cornell University in New York is now exploring ways to soup them up with more complicated electronics and onboard computation.</p>

<p>The improvements could lead to swarms of microscopic robots suturing blood vessels - or being dispatched en masse to probe large swaths of the human brain.</p>

<p>Other applications include getting them to fix electronic devices - or crawl through and restructure materials.</p>

<p>Dr Sam Stanton, program manager for the Army Research Office in the US which part-funded the project, said: 'This breakthrough provides exciting scientific opportunity for investigating new questions relevant to the physics of active matter.'</p>

<p>He added: 'It may ultimately lead to futuristic robotic materials.'</p>

<p>The microscopic robot is seen here alongside a type of tiny creature called a paramecium, as Laser technology has been used by scientists to make microscopic robots effectively walk</p>

<p>Professor Michael Strano, a chemical engineer at MIT, not involved in the study, said: 'The compatibility of these devices with micro-electronics systems suggests a path to the mass manufacture of autonomous micro-robots.'</p>

<p>However, these robots have some limitations, such as being slower than other swimming robots, not being able to sense their environments, and a lack of integrated control.</p>

<p>'Controlling a tiny robot is maybe as close as you can come to shrinking yourself down,' said Miskin.</p>

<p>'I think machines like these are going to take us into all kinds of amazing worlds that are too small to see.'</p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Nature. </p>
