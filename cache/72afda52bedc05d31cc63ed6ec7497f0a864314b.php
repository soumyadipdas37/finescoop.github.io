<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Princess Eugenie has only just announced her pregnancy - but there is already speculation over what she will name her baby. </p>

<p>Boris, Diana and George all appear on bookmakers' early baby name picks, although some are far more likely than others. </p>

<p>Arthur is the favourite boy's name for both Paddy Power and Ladbrokes, while Coral has Oliver as the most likely choice if the couple have a son. There's a greater spread on girls' names with Alice, Victoria and Lily emerging as the favourites. </p>

<p>The Princess of York, 30, revealed on Instagram that she and her husband Jack Brooksbank, 34, were expecting their first child for 2021 this morning. Booking have now opened the betting on what the baby's name will be </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Royals are known to favour traditional names so it is perhaps of no surprise bookies think Eugenie might name their child after a family member. </p>

<p>Ladbroke has George - the name of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son, as well as the Queen's father - at odds of 14/1. Paddy Power is offering 20/1. </p>

<p>According to Ladbrokes odds, it would be possible that Eugenie could name her daughter Sarah in honour of her mother the Duchess of York, 60, with odds at 80/1. </p>

<p>Odds were 20/1 that Eugenie would also name her Diana after her late aunt.  </p>

<p>Odds are 20/1 that Baby York could share the name George with his seven-year-old cousin, who is third in line for the throne. Arthur, which is a middle name for Charles, William (right) and Louis is a favourite with odds of 5/1 from Ladbrokes and 8/1 from Paddy Power</p>

<p>Bookies said that while Eugenie was likely to go for traditional names, the chances of her and Jack opting for a left-field name for their child were still high. </p>

<p>Currently leading the odds, Arthur is a beloved name among the royal family and is often picked by betters. The moniker appears in the middle names of Prince Charles, 72, Prince William, 38 and Prince Louis, two. </p>

<p>It was also touted as a possible name for baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten, the son of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex before his birth on May 6 2019.   </p>

<p>Chances are scarce that Eugenie will name her baby Sarah after her mother (pictured in February 2020) if it's a girl, with odds at 80/1. Could Eugenie name her daughter after her late aunt Lady Diana? Odds are now 20/1 that she could</p>

<p>However, Andrew was an unlikely name for the child, with odds at 100/1. Boris is also an outside pick with odds of 200/1. </p>

<p>It is unlikely that Eugenie and Jack will name their son Boris after the Prime Minister (pictured in Northampton on Thursday 24 September) </p>

<p>The tips were shared in the moments after Princess Eugenie, 30, and husband Jack Brooksbank, 34, announced they are expecting their first child together in early 2021. </p>

<p>Sharing the news on Instagram today, Eugenie, 30, wrote: 'Jack and I are so excited for early 2021....,' alongside photos of baby slippers and her and Jack smiling. </p>

<p>Sarah Ferguson shared her excitement, writing: 'I am so excited by the news that Eugenie and Jack are expecting their first child. Thrilled for them both and in my 60th year cannot wait to be a grandmother. Welcoming a new baby into the York family is going to be a moment of profound joy.'</p>

<p>The baby will be the first grandchild for Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, and will be the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's ninth great-grandchild.</p>

<p>Eugenie and Jack's child will be 11th in the order of succession, which means the Queen's youngest son Prince Edward will slip down a place into 12th place.</p>
