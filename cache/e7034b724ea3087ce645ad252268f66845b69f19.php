<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nando's Australia has unveiled a never-before-seen indulgent food item on its 'secret menu' - but you'll have to be quick because it won't be around for long.</p>

<p>The restaurant chain has created the ultimate 'loaded chips' for just $9 - complete with its signature PERi-PERi chips, juicy grilled capsicum, tomato and onion, topped with a dollop of creamy aioli, smoky relish and finished with a tangy feta cheese.</p>

<p>For those feeling extra hungry, diners can customise the dish by adding a protein such as grilled PERi-PERi chicken tenders, a plant-based 'Great Pretender' or a 'superfood' veggie patty. </p>

<p>Nando's has unveiled a never-before-seen food item on its 'secret menu' called 'loaded chips'</p>

<p>'We're always experimenting with flavours and textures, and loaded chips are no exception,' Nando's head of food Mario Manabe said.</p>

<p>'Knowing our fans can't get enough of our PERi-PERi Chips, we put the call out on Instagram to get people's opinions on toppings, which was great fun and helped solidify the mix of flavours we chose. </p>

<p>'The richness of the aioli and feta paired with the smokiness of our capsicum relish really elevates this dish to something special.</p>

<p>'Our loaded chips are super delicious on their own, but if you're feeling extra hungry, you can also customise the dish by adding one of our amazing protein options.'</p>

<p>Self-proclaimed burger expert Jimmy Hurlston - who documents his food adventures at Jimmy's Burgers on Instagram - said the loaded chips are 'seriously next level'.</p>

<p>'The bite from the grilled veg mix and spice from the PERi-PERi Salt, combined with the creamy aioli and sharp tang of feta makes for whole new taste experience.</p>

<p>'I'm no stranger to a plate of loaded chips - but this is about as good as it gets and I'll be loading up while I can.' </p>

<p>However, diners will not find this item anywhere in stores as it's only found exclusively on the 'secret menu' in the restaurant's new app.</p>

<p>To get your hands on the dish, you need to sign up to become a PERi-Perks loyalty member and you'll be rewarded exclusive access to member-only offers, freebies on your birthday and earn one point for every $1 spent.</p>

<p>Simply jump on the app, online or head to your local store as the secret menu item is now available at all restaurants for dine-in and takeaway, or via Nando's delivery until Wednesday, November 4. </p>

<p>The loaded chips are yours for dine-in or takeaway for $9 without protein, $13 with grilled chicken tenders or superfood veggie patty, or $14 with a Great Pretender.</p>
