<p>Last month, in an interview on Hollywood Raw with Dax Holt and Adam Glyn, Kelly revealed that back in 2017, she'd turned to her brother Jack for help when she hit rock bottom with her drinking. </p>

<p>'I was a functioning alcoholic,' she admitted. 'Full blown functioning alcoholic. I kept my job; I kept my friends. What it was for me, what I reached a spiritual low where I was just so morbidly unhappy and lost and directionless and just broken in every way.' </p>

<p>Kelly explained: 'I remember I picked up the phone August 8, 2017, and called my brother and I said 'I'm done, I need some help, can you come to get me? I don't want to be a fat drunk loser anymore; I want to be a skinny winner.' I was ready to work on myself and I did it.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Black Sabbath rocker Ozzy, 71, says that despite being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, he's not yet done with music.</p>

<p>His latest tour had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and he has been self-isolating at his home in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>But he's ready to go back on the road, telling Britain's Daily Mirror in an article published last Friday: 'You know the time when I will retire? When I can hear them nail a lid on my box. And then I'll f***ing do an encore. I'm the Prince of Darkness.' </p>

<p>Ozzy and Sharon have also said they are developing a biopic of the heavy metal star which will also detail their 38-year marriage and business relationship.</p>

<p>Sharon, 67, told the Mirror earlier this month: 'We're not making it for kids. 'It's an adult movie for adults. We don't want it to be squeaky, shiny clean and all of that.'  </p>
