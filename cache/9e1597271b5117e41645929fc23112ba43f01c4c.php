<p>Sell: Noel Gallagher has reportedly sold his London home for a cool £8million, after dropping the price by £3.5million (pictured in December 2019) </p>

<p>A source said: 'It’s a mystery why it took so long to sell. It’s a great location and one of the nicest homes in the area. He’s pleased the sale has finally happened.'</p>

<p>Last year, Noel bought an £8million, seven-bedroom mansion in Hampshire, complete with swimming pool, tennis court and a library.</p>

<p>With views across rolling countryside, the impressive property also features a croquet lawn and an adjoining cottage.</p>

<p>The source added: 'Noel loves the country life. Now he’s shot of the London mansion he’ll have more time to spend there. It’s a far cry from what he used to get up to but he’s happy.</p>

<p>'He enjoys visiting the local shops. He enjoys the countryside a lot.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted a representative for Noel for comment. </p>

<p>Noel's country home is conveniently located for an exclusive school to which he and wife, Sara MacDonald, hope to send son Donovan, 11. </p>

<p>The fees of more than £20,000 a year for day pupils will barely dent the singer's estimated £50 million fortune, accrued mainly thanks to the extraordinary success of Oasis during the Britpop era.</p>

<p>There are several public schools in the area, which include Brockwood Park School, Bedales and Church's. All of which was no more than a 15 minute drive from the property.</p>

<p>The musician may also be attracted by the school’s strict discipline – not least given that he was expelled from school at 15 for throwing flour over a teacher – and by the celebrities among the school’s alumni.</p>

<p>The father of three previously sent his model daughter, Anais, 20, whose mother is Meg Mathews, to private school.</p>

<p>The singer bought his new home from a renowned interior designer. She purchased the property for £3.6 million back in 2007 but claims the outlay on its refurbishment means she will make little profit from the sale.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether Noel, whose youngest child, Sonny, is eight, is funding the purchase with the sale of his six-bedroom home in London’s Little Venice.</p>
