<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Football fans around the world have had their say after Lionel Messi announced he will reluctantly stay at Barcelona to avoid a courtroom battle with the club. </p>

<p>The superstar's bombshell U-turn was officially announced on Friday evening, although Messi has once again doubled down on his criticism of the board and its under-fire president Josep Bartomeu.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old club captain announced he is finally abandoning attempts at a sensational move to Manchester City this summer in a recorded interview despite having initially demanded to leave.</p>

<p>Among those football fans reacting to the news, one Twitter user said: 'Messi publically slating Bartomeu &amp; the rest of the board is incredibly huge. </p>

<p>'They might remain at the club, but their image will forever be damaged with Bartomeu being the face of all of that damage, there is no way they will ever be able to recover that. Well done by Messi.'</p>

<p>Another person cynically suggested: 'Messi used City to topple the Barca president.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, another fan revealed they had been reduced to tears by Messi's decision to remain at the Nou Camp. </p>
