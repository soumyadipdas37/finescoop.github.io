<p>An anti-lockdown coronavirus sceptic has launched a makeshift security force to 'protect' protesters from police.</p>

<p>Nathan Glover, from Mt Eliza in Melbourne's south, masterminded the 'protection and tactical incident response' group known as P.A.T.I.R when police shut down anti-lockdown protests in the CBD during Stage Four lockdown. </p>

<p>The 43-year-old is a regular at the demonstrations and has pledged his allegiance to future events, despite receiving large fines for flouting stay at home directives.</p>

<p>In a video released on Facebook on Saturday, the tradie modelled his new protective wear, which includes helmets, chest plates and motorbike vests. </p>

<p>Mr Glover said the armour is necessary because it could 'take the heavy handed treatment' from police.</p>

<p>'I am not there to attack anyone, or fight anyone. If the police want to be brutal, I am there,' he said.   </p>

<p>'If you need care, P.A.T.I.R will be there. Our guys are highly trained. We're there for you guys to do what you do without getting messed up.' </p>

<p>The 43-year-old (pictured in protective gear) is a regular at the illegal demonstrations and has pledged his allegiance to future events</p>

<p>In the video, he is seen hitting his arms, legs and torso with a stick while covered in armour to demonstrate the strength of the gear.</p>

<p>He wrote on social media that the makeshift taskforce is necessary because police 'get pleasure out of hurting people and have the emotional range of a sack of potatoes'. </p>

<p>In subsequent video shared on Tuesday, Mr Glover introduced a long piece of metal wiring to add to his protective gear.</p>

<p>He said the metal had been donated by a screen door company that did not want to be identified. </p>

<p>In the video, he is seen hitting his arms, legs and torso with a stick while covered in armour to demonstrate the strength of the gear. A long piece of metal wiring also covers his mid-section</p>

<p>He said the makeshift taskforce is necessary because 'get pleasure out of hurting people and have the emotional range of a sack of potatoes'</p>

<p>Mr Glover also claimed the lockdowns in Melbourne ruined his music career and 'decimated' the live scene, according to the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>He added that he doesn't think COVID-19 is as much of a threat as leaders say.</p>

<p>'The fact they say it is contagious, this doesn't make any sense. It doesn't transmit through contagion,' he said. </p>

<p>A contagion is classified as an illness that can spread from person to person through direct contact.</p>

<p>Mr Glover also claimed the government turned the city into a 'prison', and risks a $1,652 fine if he is involved in a future protest</p>

<p>According Health Direct, run by the Australian government, the virus spreads through droplets transmitted by touching an infected person, or an object or surface where an infected person has been.</p>

<p>Mr Glover risks a $1,652 fine if he is involved in a future protest.</p>

<p>Victorian Police are preparing for another round of demonstrations this weekend.</p>

<p>On Sunday, up to 250 residents amassed at Queen Victoria Market for a second day of riots as tensions escalate over the city's tough stage four restrictions, which prohibit Melburnians from leaving home for non-essential reasons. </p>

<p>Protesters were outnumbered by a sea of police officers who flooded the scene to break-up the demonstration </p>

<p>A heavy police presence was seen at the Queen Victoria Market on Sunday as protesters organised a 'freedom walk' against coronavirus restrictions</p>

<p>Protesters chanting 'Freedom' and 'Power to the people' were outnumbered by officers, with some demonstrators throwing fruit at police after raiding market stalls. </p>

<p>Victoria Police arrested 74 people and issued at least 176 infringement notices for breaching the Chief Health Officer directions. </p>

<p>Officers said many protestors were aggressive and threatened violence towards officers, however no members of the force were injured.</p>

<p>'It was extremely disappointing to see people not just protesting, but putting the lives of other Victorians at risk despite all the warnings,' a Victoria Police spokesperson said.</p>

<p>'Our investigations into this protest will continue, and we expect to issue further fines once the identity of individuals has been confirmed.'</p>

<p>A man appeared to be in pain as officers restrained his arms as he laid on the cement</p>

<p>Victoria police warned that anyone caught breaching COVID-19 directives will be punished.</p>

<p>Melburnians will be fined almost $5000 if caught trying to sneak into regional Victoria under a tough new penalty. </p>

<p>Melbourne remains in a Stage Four lockdown, meaning residents cannot leave their houses without a valid reason, and restrictions are in place to limit movement more than 5km from a person's home.</p>

<p>The restrictions remain in place, and both a State of Emergency and State of Disaster, have been extended a further four weeks.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Victoria recorded eight new coronavirus deaths and 42 infections. The state's active cases dropped below 1,000.</p>
