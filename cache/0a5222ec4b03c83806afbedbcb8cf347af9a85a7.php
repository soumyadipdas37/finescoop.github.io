<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The first official trailer for the much-anticipated Disney+ miniseries WandaVision debuted during the virtual 2020 Emmy Awards on Sunday.   </p>

<p>Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are back as their Marvel characters - Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch and Vision -  in a six episode run that Marvel has described as a 'mega event series'.  </p>

<p>Created by Captain Marvel writer Jac Schaeffer, the show centers on the two super-powered beings living an idyllic suburbia life in a world straight out of a 1950s sitcom. </p>

<p>First taste: The first official trailer for the much-anticipated Disney+ miniseries WandaVision debuted during the virtual 2020 Emmy Awards on Sunday</p>

<p>The teaser opens with the couple playing the traditional husband and wife roles that borders between comedic and creepy, all while shot in black-and-white.</p>

<p>About midway through, the trailer shifts into bright color, complete with more zany and odd behavior.  </p>

<p>The series has been described as a 'blend of classic television and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems.'</p>

<p>Retro: The teaser opens with the couple playing the traditional husband and wife roles, all while shot in black-and-white.</p>

<p>Triumphant return: Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany are back as their Marvel characters -- Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch and Vision</p>

<p>The show centers on the two super-powered beings living an idyllic suburbia life in a world straight out of a 1950s sitcom.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the teaser, some of the stars of the show can be seen dancing while other fly through portals as federal agents seemingly look on.</p>

<p>'We are an unusual couple, you know,' Olsen's Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch says to Bettany's Vision in a return to the black-and-white look.</p>

<p>'Oh I don't think that ever was in question,' Vision answers back at end the trailer along with crowd laughter in the background. </p>

<p>Bizarre: The six episode season has described by Marvel as a 'mega event series'</p>

<p>Hybrid: The series is a 'blend of classic television and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems'</p>

<p>MCU: WandaVision was created by Captain Marvel writer Jac Schaeffer</p>

<p>WandaVision will take place following the events of last year's Avengers: Endgame, but so far far it's not clear how Vision, who was killed in Infinity War, was revived.  </p>

<p>It's also been revealed that the show will feature characters from Captain Marvel, Thor and Ant-Man, and it will tie into the upcoming 2022 movie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.</p>

<p>Along with Olsen and Bettany, WandaVision also stars Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis, Randall Park as Jimmy Woo and Kathryn Hahn plays a 'nosy neighbor'. </p>

<p>In living color: About midway through, the trailer shifts into bright color, complete with more zany and odd behavior</p>

<p>Out of this world: Bettany plays an android and Avenger created using the artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron and the Mind Stone</p>

<p>Shaking it: Towards the end of the teaser, some of the stars of the show can be seen dancing while other fly through portals as federal agents seemingly look on</p>

<p>Blast from the past: Some scenes are reminiscent of the 1960s fantasy sitcom Bewitched</p>

<p>The series, which has been long awaited by Marvel fans, was also one of the many productions shut down in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier in the year. </p>

<p>The first look at the upcoming series took place earlier this year, during the Super Bowl in February.</p>

<p>So far there's no official word on an exact release date just yet but it is expected to premiere some time in December 2020.            </p>

<p>There's plenty of high-flying scenes by the last part of the teaser</p>

<p>The premise: WandaVision will take place after the events of last year's Avengers: Endgame</p>

<p>Familar faces: The show will feature characters from Captain Marvel, Thor and Ant-Man</p>

<p>Coming soon: So far there's no official word on an exact release date just yet but it is expected to premiere some time in December 2020</p>

<p>Jimmy Kimmel hosted the 2020 Emmys at the Staples Center in Los Angeles without a studio audience due to the the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, although he tried to dupe the viewing audience in the opening by having clips from previous ceremonies edited in.</p>
