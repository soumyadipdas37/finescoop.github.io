<p>Kourtney has been vocal about her reluctance to appear on the show in recent years, butting heads with her sisters over the matter before finally quitting the series.</p>

<p>'I was feeling unfulfilled and it became a toxic environment for me to continue to have it occupy as much of my life as it was,' she told Vogue Arabia of her decision to leave.</p>

<p>'Life was moving so, so fast, even after taking a break from the show and attempting to slow down and give more time to my kids… It wasn't until this time that I have been able to learn their needs again, see their strengths, and be able to be connected as deeply as I once was, before juggling so much.' </p>
