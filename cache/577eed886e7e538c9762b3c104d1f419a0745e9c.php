<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has left the national team's training camp to return to Real Madrid ahead of a couple of international matches.</p>

<p>The Belgian Football Federation made the announcement Friday without providing further details.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the federation denied media reports that Courtois tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Thibaut Courtois has left the Belgium squad and returned to Real Madrid without explanation</p>

<p>Courtois spent time with his family in Marbella, Spain, after Real Madrid's 2019-20 campaign was ended by a Champions League defeat by Manchester City last month.  </p>

<p>Only on Thursday, the former Chelsea shot-stopper had posted a picture of himself on national team duty, along with the caption: 'Back at it!'  </p>

<p>Belgium travel to Denmark this week for its first Nations League match. </p>

<p>In the absence of Courtois, Simon Mignolet is likely to be handed a start. Belgium then hosts Iceland on Tuesday.</p>
