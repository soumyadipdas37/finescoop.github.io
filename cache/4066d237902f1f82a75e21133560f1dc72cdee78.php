<p>Sleep over: Staycayions needn't be boring when you can bunk down with your four-legged friends</p>

<p>This quirky unique and magical experience is the first of its kind in the UK and is set to prove popular with children and adults alike</p>

<p>The horse, meanwhile, sleeps in a spacious stable section with an automatic water feeder and haynets.</p>

<p>There are dinner and breakfast buckets so guests can feed their four-legged roommates and a luxury grooming kit is also provided.</p>

<p>The room - which is lit up by twinkling fairy lights at night time - is separated using a see-through divider.  </p>

<p>Stroke of genius: Guests can chat and stroke their horses from the comfort of their beds</p>

<p>Roommates can develop a rapport over dinner and breakfast with the horses at Black Horses Ltd, Cumbria</p>

<p>From the top bunk bed guests can stroke and chat to their horse as well as feed them treats such as carrots and Polo mints.</p>

<p>The unique experience, dubbed Stable Stays, is offered by Black Horses Ltd and prices start at £250 per night for the stable.</p>

<p>Tracey Alexander, owner of Black Horses Ltd, said: 'As a child I used to read books about people who let their little Shetland Ponies in to sleep on their bed and it's just something that's stuck with me.  </p>

<p>Pasture bedtime: Who wants to go to sleep when there is a four-legged friend to chat to?</p>

<p>Horsing around: Horses don't sleep like we do so it may be a long night ahead for the guests </p>

<p>'I am surprised no one has come up with the idea before.</p>

<p>'The breeding of Friesian Horses is very closely monitored and they are known for being very people orientated, friendly and kind so this suits them perfectly.</p>

<p>'Our little Shetland Pony is also really sweet, although I do have to worn people he is a bit nibbly sometimes.</p>

<p>We'll drink to that! Guests are enjoying 'Stable Stays' offered by Black Horses Ltd which cost £250 per night</p>

<p>'Horses don't sleep like we do. They are up and down during the night and can often be heard wandering around or munching away.</p>

<p>'We do offer ear plugs but people don't come here for a full night's sleep. They come for a unique and magical experience.'</p>

<p>Is it time for breakfast yet? Guests can feed their four-legged pals treats such as carrots and Polo mints</p>
