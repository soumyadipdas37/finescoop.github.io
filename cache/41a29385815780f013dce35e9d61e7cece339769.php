<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists his Manchester United defence is good enough to cope this season without reinforcements.</p>

<p>The Manchester United manager is under pressure to bolster his squad after losing the first Premier League game of the season at home to Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>So far United have added only Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek but questions have been asked recently about the central defensive partnership of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof. </p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has insisted his defensive line is good enough and doesn't need reinforcement before the transfer window closes on October 5</p>

<p>Harry Maguire looks dejected as United are beaten 3-1 by Crystal Palace last weekend</p>

<p>Victor Lindelof didn't have the greatest of games as United lost their Premier League opener</p>

<p>Solskjaer said ahead of Saturday's visit to Brighton: 'Last season proved to us how we can defend at our best.</p>

<p>'Yes, last week was not fantastic. We conceded sloppy goals.</p>

<p>'But our defensive record last season showed with Eric and Harry how good a partnership they can be [we can do it]. We defended very well as a team.</p>

<p>'Eric [Bailly] is fit again which is a big bonus. I am looking forward to him developing. We have been waiting for him to be fit and to play more regularly.</p>

<p>'I am very confident in my players. We are working on getting better.'</p>

<p>United have a big squad by Premier League standards with a number of players seemingly having little chance of starting games this season.</p>

<p>Asked if this could be a problem, Solskjaer said: 'It is not my job to keep them happy.</p>

<p>'My job is to pick players to get results. It is up to them to be fit and work hard and be ready when called upon.'</p>

<p>But Solskjaer wouldn't be drawn on whether United plan to make any more new signings to bolster his squad ahead of the transfer deadline on October 5 as fans grow more anxious about the lack of new additions. </p>

<p>'As I've said many times I'm very confident in my players,' he said. 'If and when something happens, both ins and outs, we'll update you. In football you can't predict too much.</p>

<p>'For me, I'm just working on getting better. My focus is solely on the game, I can't be thinking any other way. We need points and then we can talk again.' </p>

<p>Solskjaer has tried to establish a consistent central defensive partnership between captain Maguire and Lindelof.</p>

<p>However, Lindelof conceded a penalty in the 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace last weekend and Solskjaer's positive comments about Bailly could suggest the Ivorian will replace Lindelof in the side. </p>

<p>It comes as Chris Smalling makes a plea to leave United before the deadline following a successful loan spell with Roma last season. </p>

<p>Other options include Phil Jones, who was used sparingly last season, Marcos Rojo, who went out on loan to Estudiantes in Argentina, and the inexperienced but highly promising Axel Tuanzebe. </p>
