<p>Kurt Beathard has left his job as a coach for Illinois State football team</p>

<p>Prior to his departure, Beathard left a sign on his door reading: 'All lives matter to our Lord'</p>

<p>In the weeks leading up to his abrupt leave-taking, a Black Lives Matter poster which was in the team's locker room was removed. Beathard insisted he had nothing to do with its removal.</p>

<p>At the end of August, Beathard's former colleague Larry Lyons, director of athletics, caused controversy among Redbirds - the athletic teams that represent Illinois State University - by telling students: 'All Redbird lives matter'. </p>

<p>Some college athletes based at the Normal, Illinois center temporarily boycotted team meetings, workouts and practices as a result.</p>

<p>An Athletics March for Black Voices was held on September 4. </p>

<p>ISU announced in a Wednesday afternoon press release that Beathard was being replaced by Ghaali Muhammad-Lankford and C.J. Irvin, who would both serve as co-offensive coordinators. </p>

<p>Andy Belluomini has been added to the ISU coaching staff to assume the quarterbacks coach position previously held by Beathard.</p>

<p>Beathard spent the 2014 and '15 seasons as the Redbird offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach before taking two years off to spend more time with his family. </p>

<p>Beathard coached the team in 2014 and 2015; took a break; then returned for 2018 onwards</p>

<p>He came back to ISU in the same roles in 2018.</p>

<p>Beathard is a member of a remarkable footballing family.</p>

<p>His nephew, CJ Beathard, is a quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers, and his uncle, Pete Beathard, played professionally from 1964-75. </p>

<p>Beathard's father Bobby Beathard, now 83, was a general manager for the NFL.</p>

<p>As a player, Beathard Sr's teams competed in seven Super Bowls, winning four times.</p>

<p>He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018.</p>
