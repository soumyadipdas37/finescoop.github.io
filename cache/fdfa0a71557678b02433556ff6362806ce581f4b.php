<p>Amanda's outing comes after it was revealed she has ended up with a £6,000 luxury rabbit pen for her bunnies at her south-west London home.</p>

<p>The TV personality shares the property with her record producer husband of 12 years, Chris Hughes, and their two daughters Lexi, 14, and Hollie, eight. </p>

<p>The Britain's Got Talent host has made the most of her daughters' old playhouse by transforming it into an incredible comfy home for her two rabbits Princess and Beatrice. </p>

<p>Amanda is thought to have spent £6,000 to up-cycle the space for her beloved pets who can now enjoy their own porch and bunk beds, reports The Sun. </p>

<p>Lady in blue: The Britain's Got Talent judge perfectly matched her baby blue jumper with a pair of patent stilettos and injected a touch of glamour with her leather black clutch</p>

<p>A source said: 'Amanda loves these rabbits, and they're treasured members of the family. It's only right they live like starlets.' </p>

<p>And a representative for Amanda told MailOnline: 'The playhouse was purchased 6 years ago for Lexi and Hollie to play in, but they’ve outgrown it now.  </p>

<p>'Converting it into a home for the rabbits has cost just £200. Rather than dismantling it, Amanda has simply recycled it!' </p>
