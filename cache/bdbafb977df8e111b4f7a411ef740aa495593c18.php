<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Couples who attempt to lose weight together are almost three times more likely to be successful, a study has found.</p>

<p>Heart attack survivors in the Netherlands were given lifestyle plans to aid recovery and cut their risk of suffering another.</p>

<p>Partners were encouraged to join in, so scientists could compare the success rates between couples who attempted to lose weight together and those who didn't. </p>

<p>Survivors keen to drop the pounds lost more weight if they were supported by their spouse, results showed. </p>

<p>And they were 2.7 times more likely to lose weight over a year than those who did it without the support of their partner, the researchers said.</p>

<p>But partner participation did not influence the success rates of quitting smoking or exercising more, which the researchers suggested requires more personal motivation. </p>

<p>Heart attack patients in the Netherlands keen to drop the pounds lost more weight when they were supported by their significant other compared to when they were not (stock)</p>

<p>The study, led by Lotte Verweij, a registered nurse and PhD student at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, was presented during a virtual briefing today at the annual European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress.</p>

<p>Ms Verweijj said: 'Our study shows that when spouses join the effort to change habits, patients have a better chance of becoming healthier - particularly when it comes to losing weight.' </p>

<p>A heart attack is when heart tissue dies because blood to the heart is blocked, most often due to a buildup of fat or cholesterol. It's different from cardiac arrest, when the heart’s electrical system malfunctions.</p>

<p>It's important for heart attacks survivors to receive follow-up care so doctors can monitor their recovery and prevent another episode.</p>

<p>It typically includes annual blood pressure checks, a blood test for cholesterol and kidney function and a review of medication. </p>

<p>The three main ways to prevent a heart attack are to eat healthier to avoid hardening of the arteries, stopping smoking and keeping blood pressure down, the NHS says. </p>

<p>Being active can lower your blood pressure by keeping the heart and blood vessels in good condition.</p>

<p>If a person has persistent high blood pressure, it puts an extra strain on the arteries and heart, increasing the likelihood of a heart attack. </p>

<p>A total of 824 heart attack survivors were randomly assigned to receive either standard care with the addition of a lifestyle programme or standard care alone.</p>

<p>The 411 patients in the intervention group were able to pick from three programmes for weight reduction, physical activity, or to stop smoking.   </p>

<p>Research had previously shown heart attack survivors were more likely to adjust their behaviour if they were given programmes to guide them. </p>

<p>The latest analysis — which tracked patients for a year — wanted to see if partner contribution helped make those changes easier.</p>

<p>Spouses were encouraged to attend the free sessions. Some 48 per cent of partners participated, defined as attending at least once. </p>

<p>Patients with a participating partner were almost three times more successful in losing weight compared to those who did it alone.</p>

<p>They lost more weight compared to patients with a partner who did not join the programme, said Ms Verweij, but did she did not reveal by how much. </p>

<p>There was no more improvement in smoking cessation or physical activity when partners actively participated, however.</p>

<p>'These lifestyle issues may be more subject to individual motivation and persistence,' Ms Verwij said.  </p>

<p>'Lifestyle improvement after a heart attack is a crucial part of preventing repeat events.</p>

<p>'Couples often have comparable lifestyles and changing habits is difficult when only one person is making the effort.</p>

<p>'Practical issues come into play, such as grocery shopping, but also psychological challenges, where a supportive partner may help maintain motivation.' </p>

<p>The weight loss programme was weekly group sessions with a Weight Watchers coach for a year. For physical activity, an online coach was provided.</p>

<p>The smoking cessation programme was motivational interviewing by a trained professionals for three months plus a prescription of nicotine replacement or varenicline therapy as appropriate. </p>

<p>Standard care consisted of visits to the cardiologist and cardiac rehabilitation plus up to four visits to a nurse-coordinated programme to encourage healthy living.</p>
