<p>Ouch! Gogglebox Australia star Chantal Bakac has been left terrorised after being attacked by a vicious dog. The blonde required several stitches on her lower lip following the scary incident</p>

<p>Early on in the episode, Chantal was gifted by a bouquet of flowers by Kaday who joked: 'I got you flowers for being stupid. This is your flowers, for putting your face in a dog's face.' </p>

<p>The Sydney-based friends later watched an episode of Channel 10's new comedy Drunk History, which proved to be challenging for the injured star when she laughed.</p>

<p>At one point, Chantal couldn't contain her laughter as the inebriated comedian, Anne Edmonds, narrated Dame Nellie Melba's life story.</p>

<p>Kaday, who is also a nurse, urged her friend to close her mouth so she wouldn't further injure herself and damage the stitches in her lip.</p>

<p>She then told her pal: 'If there was a Cocker Spaniel at the other end, it would be like Lady and the Tramp.'</p>
