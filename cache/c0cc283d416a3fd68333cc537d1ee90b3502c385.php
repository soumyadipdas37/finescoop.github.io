<p> Moving on: Melissa Doyle (pictured) was ousted from Channel Seven last month, after 25 years of service with the network. Now a new report claims the 50-year-old journalist could be heading for Channel 10's The Sunday Project</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another report in Woman's Day also alleged earlier this month that Melissa is being headhunted for The Project.  </p>

<p>Apparently, executive producer Rove McManus is trying to get the show's budget in order so they can afford to hire the former Sunrise anchor.</p>

<p>'Lisa [Wilkinson, the host of The Sunday Project] is up for renewal, and the guess is she will take a big pay cut to make way for Mel to step in as a regular on The Project,' a source told the magazine.   </p>

<p>New gig? According to New Idea , Melissa 'is poised to ink a big deal with Network Ten' to join the cast of the panel news show, where she will work alongside 'her good friend Lisa Wilkinson' (pictured right)</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Ten for comment. </p>

<p>In her first interview since her shock departure, Melissa told The Sunday Telegraph's Stellar magazine this week that the axing wasn't out of the blue.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't say it came as a total shock, I just felt really sad,' she admitted.   </p>

<p>Melissa also revealed how she allowed herself one day to 'wallow on the couch'. </p>

<p> Claims: Meanwhile, another report in Woman's Day also alleged earlier this month that Melissa is being headhunted for The Project</p>

<p>'I let myself have one day when I wallowed on the couch and had a gin and tonic a little earlier than I should have,' the mother-of-two said with a laugh.   </p>

<p>During her career, Melissa hosted several of Seven's flagship programs, including Sunrise, Today Tonight, 7News, Sunday Night and The Latest. </p>

<p>Her departure is believed to be the result of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit Seven particularly hard.  </p>
