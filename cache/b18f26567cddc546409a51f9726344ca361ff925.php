<p>Chris is heard saying: 'I don't believe it. This is incredible. I have got this giant space that I can actually use. Just being able to be outside and with a fire. It is such a simple thing but it means so much to me.' </p>

<p>Describing how he'd fallen ill, Chris explained: 'I was feeling a bit under the weather. Temperature was up and I was drenched in sweat, but I had no idea what it was.</p>

<p>'My wife was doing a return to nursing course and two weeks prior to this happening she went on a sepsis course. The only reason I am here is because she recognised that I had about five of the six red flags for sepsis.'</p>
