<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Skye Wheatley sent her Instagram fans into meltdown on Sunday after uploading what appeared to be a pregnancy announcement.  </p>

<p>The former Big Brother star, 26, had uploaded a sweet family photo of herself, boyfriend Lachlan Waugh and their one-year-old son Forest - but it was her misleading caption that landed the Instagram model in hot water.  </p>

<p>'And then there were five,' the mother-of-one began her caption, seemingly implying she and Lachlan are expecting twins. </p>

<p>'And then there were five': Skye Wheatley, 26, made her fans believe she was expecting TWINS by posting a 'fake' pregnancy announcement post via Instagram on Sunday. Pictured with partner Lachlan Waugh, one-year-old son Forest, and dogs Winston and Crunchie</p>

<p>'And don't ask what's going on with my shorts, promise I didn't grow a penni,' she continued, referring to the creased fabric of her denim shorts. </p>

<p>Making the so-called pregnancy post even more compelling was the fact that Lachlan's hand was seen resting on Skye's belly. </p>

<p>However, upon closer inspection it seems the phrase 'and then there were five' actually a reference to her pet dachshunds Winston and Crunchie, who were seen playing in the background.   </p>

<p>Say what? 'And then there were five,' the mother-of-one began her caption, seemingly implying she and Lachlan are expecting twins </p>

<p>Mystery solved? Upon closer inspection it seems Skye post was actually a reference to her pet dachshunds Winston and Crunchie (pictured), who were seen playing in the background</p>

<p>Having grabbed fans' attention, Skye finished her caption by promoting her new business Presets By Skye &amp; Freja, which sells pre-made image filters.  </p>

<p>Skye's followers were understandably confused by the post, with one commenting: 'Omg I thought this was a pregnancy announcement'. </p>

<p>'I thought you meant you were pregnant with twins god damn,' another frustrated follower concurred.  </p>

<p>Show and tell: Skye tirelessly documented her first pregnancy with son Forest, one, on Instagram in 2018 (pictured) </p>

<p>'I thought you meant you were pregnant!' Skye's followers were understandably confused by the post</p>

<p>The surgically-enhanced reality star eventually responded to the cacophony of comments, confirming that she isn't pregnant and that her next baby announcement will be 'far more epic than a mirror selfie'. </p>

<p>Skye has previously spoken about her desire to welcome a second child.  </p>

<p>'How are you so perfect two days old? Wonder what our next one will look like?' she wrote next to a photo of newborn Forest. </p>

<p>Then, just a few weeks later, the new mother posted to Instagram: 'This is my life now... And I still want another one, god I'm bat s*** crazy haha.'  </p>

<p>Well that clears things up! Skye eventually confirmed that she isn't pregnant and that her next baby announcement will be 'far more epic than a mirror selfie' </p>

<p>Clucky!  Skye has previously spoken about her desire to welcome a second child after welcoming baby Forest on Christmas Eve, 2018 </p>
