<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gary Neville fears trouble is brewing at Manchester United as David de Gea and Dean Henderson compete to be first choice goalkeeper.</p>

<p>Henderson has returned from an excellent season on loan at Sheffield United at a time when De Gea's position looks vulnerable after a succession of high-profile errors.</p>

<p>It leaves manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with a dilemma ahead of the new season but Neville doesn't believe the competition is a positive thing.</p>

<p>David de Gea's status as Manchester United's No 1 goalkeeper is under increasing pressure</p>

<p>Dean Henderson has returned from his loan spell to challenge De Gea for the No 1 spot</p>

<p>The goalkeeper situation leaves manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer facing a headache </p>

<p>The Old Trafford legend told Sky Sports: 'The idea that Dean Henderson would come into Manchester United and replace David de Gea as No 1 goalkeeper straight away… it won't happen, I can guarantee it won't happen.</p>

<p>'This has got 'problem' written all over it. The one area of the pitch where you need consistency and stability is your goalkeeper.</p>

<p>'You need to know who your No 1 is, you cannot be flip-flopping. It just does not work; I've never seen it work at any club or at international level.</p>

<p>'Where there is a decision to be made about two goalkeepers you have to pick your No 1, go with him and stick with him, even if there is a mistake.</p>

<p>'Once you take David de Gea out of the team and put Henderson in, you may as well forget about De Gea. That's coming from my experiences at United.</p>

<p>Gary Neville fears the goalkeeping situation spells trouble for Solskjaer and Man United</p>

<p>He expects Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (R) to keep faith in De Gea despite some high-profile errors </p>

<p>De Gea makes a mistake in Man United's defeat to Watford back in December last year</p>

<p>'The period between Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar we had Ricardo, Fabien Barthez, Mark Bosnich, Roy Carroll, Tim Howard, Massimo Taibi, many goalkeepers over a five to six-year period and there was inconsistency that certainly didn't help.'</p>

<p>Spain international De Gea, 29, has been United's No 1 goalkeeper for nine seasons now and is regarded as one of the game's best shot-stoppers.</p>

<p>But mistakes have crept into his game with Watford, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea among the opponents to benefit last season.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old was impressive for Sheffield United and has no plans to be second choice </p>

<p>Henderson impressed for Sheffield United on their Premier League return and the 23-year-old, who has been on United's books since 2011, has made it clear he doesn't want to serve as De Gea's back up.</p>

<p>United get their Premier League season underway at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday after being given an extra week of pre-season following their run to the Europa League semi-finals.</p>
