<p>Months later, in 2019, it was revealed the pair with dating, after Stacey split from her long-term boyfriend Sam Tucknott.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the dancer revealed that he was so desperate to be paired with eventual winner Stacey, he called in a favour with one of the choreographers.</p>

<p>Speaking on The Kevin Clifton Show podcast he revealed he asked Strictly choreographer Jason Gilkison, who he worked with on the Burn The Floor tour, for a hand. </p>

<p>He said: 'I was a fan of your documentaries and for the last couple of years I'd tweeted you a few times, going 'I really liked your documentary', and you were like, ''Oh cheers Kev!'' </p>

<p>Couple: Kevin and Stacey started dating after she starred on Strictly. The pair were crowned champions and became a couple in April 2019 (pictured on the show in 2018)  </p>

<p>'So yeah, I was like ''Stacey Dooley's wicked. She'll be really interesting... great just to talk to about her experiences.''</p>

<p>'Once I heard you were doing it, I said to Jason, ''Remember that time when I had broken shins and it was the difference between Burn The Floor going bust or going to Broadway?''</p>

<p>'You (Jason) were like ''I need you to give a big performance tonight'' and I was, ''Yes I'll do it. I'll take lots of ibuprofen and go on stage''.</p>

<p>Jason then went onto work on Strictly, and when he and Kevin were reunited the dancer asked him to try and 'push' for Stacey to be partnered with him.</p>

<p>Meant to be! Earlier this year, the dancer revealed that he was so desperate to be paired with eventual winner Stacey, he called in a favour with one of the choreographers (pictured in 2018)  </p>

<p>Kevin added: 'Jason was like ''What do you want?'' and I said, ''Well I've heard Stacey Dooley may be doing Strictly. If there's any chance you could push for her to be my partner...'' It's something I don't normally do.' </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for Strictly Come Dancing for comment at the time.   </p>

<p>During the same podcast Stacey made the same admission that she 'pushed' to be paired with Kevin, and claimed bosses originally wanted to pair her with AJ Pritchard.  </p>

<p>Insisting she believed they'd be coupled with other stars of the series, Stacey said: 'I imagine at some point, total speculation, that you were meant to have Lauren [Steadman] or Katie [Piper] and they were going to put me with AJ. </p>

<p>'I pushed for you for whatever reason. If I hadn't been so vocal, I wouldn't have gotten you. I really wanted you. You're so nurturing and patient.</p>

<p>'I remember telling Louise, I would like Kevin please! She told me it doesn't really work like that [laughs]'</p>

<p>In March, Kevin announced that he decided to quit Strictly after seven years in the professional line-up after landing his dream West End role in Strictly ballroom. </p>
