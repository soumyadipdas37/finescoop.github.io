<p>'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told her.</p>

<p>'When I think about our future together, I'm so excited and I can't wait to just travel the world and make all your dreams come true.</p>

<p>'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.' </p>

<p>In an interview with Who magazine on Friday, the couple revealed the codenames they used to communicate with each other while the show was airing.   </p>

<p>'Mine was as simple as Roger Roger and it had a smiley face,' Locky said, referring to the moniker he used to save Irena's number in his phone.</p>

<p>'And Locky was under Doug in my phone,' Irena revealed.  </p>

<p>'Douglas is Locky's middle name so that's where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' she explained. </p>
