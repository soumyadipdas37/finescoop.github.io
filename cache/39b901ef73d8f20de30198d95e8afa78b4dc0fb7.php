<p>Ben Wallace appeared to question the legality of the Iraq invasion while standing at the Commons despatch box.</p>

<p>In a heated exchange with his Labour counterpart, Mr Wallace said: 'What we should recognise is much of the mess we are having to come and clean up today is because of your [Labour's] illegal wars, your events in the past.'</p>

<p>Defence Secretary Ben Wallace triggered a row last night after he appeared to question the legality of the Iraq invasion while standing at the Commons despatch box</p>

<p>Labour defence spokesman John Healey replied: 'That is not worthy of the office of the Secretary of State for Defence. This is too important for party politics. It should be beneath the Secretary of State to reduce this to party politics.'</p>

<p>The row came as MPs debated legislation the Government has said will mean service personnel will be protected from 'vexatious claims and endless investigations'. </p>

<p>Mr Wallace said the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill, which received its second reading in the Commons last night, would provide 'certainty' for troops.</p>

<p>The Bill seeks to limit false and historical allegations arising from overseas operations by introducing a statutory presumption against prosecution, making it exceptional for personnel to be prosecuted five years or more after an incident.</p>

<p>To override the presumption, the consent of the attorney general will be required. The prosecutor must weigh up the 'adverse impact of overseas operations on service personnel' and, where there has been no compelling new evidence, the public interest in cases coming to a 'timely conclusion'. </p>

<p>But campaigners and some senior military figures have warned that the legislation will create a presumption against prosecution of torture and other serious crimes, except rape and sexual violence.</p>

<p>General Sir Nick Parker, former commander of land forces, last week said he was worried that the focus on prosecutions 'risks us being seen as setting double standards'.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace (pictured with Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick) suggested British troops had taken part in 'illegal wars'</p>

<p>Mr Wallace, a former soldier who served in Northern Ireland, rejected claims that the Bill could decriminalise torture and murder.</p>

<p>He said: 'We've been told that this Bill is controversial. Some have gone as far to have said it decriminalises torture or prevents veterans from receiving compensation. Both allegations are untrue.</p>

<p>'It is our intention should new or compelling evidence be brought forward to prosecute for those offences. It is not decriminalising torture, it is not decriminalising murder.'</p>

<p>Mr Wallace added: 'We want the ability if necessary to allow soldiers to focus on the danger and job in hand in operations, not on whether they will have a lawsuit slapped on them when they get home.'</p>

<p>Afghanistan and Iraq were the major military campaigns in which Tony Blair sent British troops into combat. The latter proved particularly controversial.</p>

<p>In 2010, Nick Clegg was forced to clarify the government's position on the Iraq war after he denounced the invasion as 'illegal'. The then deputy prime minister made the remarks while standing in for David Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions.</p>

<p>Mr Clegg later stressed his opinion was a 'long-held' personal one and Downing Street said he was not speaking for the government.</p>

<p>The Conservatives backed the then Labour government's decision to commit troops to Iraq in 2003, with current key figures including Boris Johnson all supporting the war.</p>
