<p>Making new moves? Maisie Smith has reportedly signed up to compete on Strictly Come Dancing, despite being under investigation for smoking a 'strong-smelling cigarette' </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'It is unthinkable that Strictly would sign her after the few weeks she has had. The show is the pinnacle of the BBC and gives rising stars and established ones a huge step to more fame.</p>

<p>'So it’s very weird to give someone whose future was very unclear just weeks ago such an opportunity. Perhaps they see it as a way of nailing down a rising star rather than her leaving and taking with her a young audience.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Maisie Smith and Strictly Come Dancing for comment. </p>

<p>Maisie previously allegedly turned down an eye-watering amount of money from a record label to promote their artists music on her videos. </p>

<p>She reportedly rejected the offer after being told it would breach her EastEnders contract, however she is believed to have gone on to accept a second deal.    </p>

<p>An EastEnders spokeswoman confirmed to the publication: 'We are looking into this matter.' </p>

<p>'When you're in a soap, you have to remember that you have an influence on others - especially younger people - and you have to set an example.</p>

<p>'You are an ambassador for your show, so you have to make sure you uphold its values. I can't imagine she will get away with it lightly.'</p>
