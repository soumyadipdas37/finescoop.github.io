<p>In 2018 a major deal to support and supply range safety and aircrew training vessels to the Ministry of Defence was signed.</p>

<p>The £39million, seven-year contract has the aim of providing range safety patrol vessels at military firing ranges - with river and coastal boundaries - and marine support to tri-service aircrew training across the MOD, the ministry said.</p>

<p>Initially the contract is set to run until March 2023, with an option to extend and provide for helicopter training, sea survival drills, target-towing, fast-attack craft simulations and range safety. </p>

<p>'This supports the operational readiness of military personnel across all three Services,' the MOD said at the time.</p>

<p>The Smit Yare is one of four purpose-built aircrew training workboats, 27 metres in length, 19 knots with 12 passengers plus four instructors and a crew of six. </p>

<p>The other three are the Smit Don, Smit Dee, and Smit Spey. </p>
