<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There are just eight contestants left vying for Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor.</p>

<p>And on Wednesday, rumoured finalists Irena Srbinovska and Bella Varelis posted some very telling cocktail party photos ahead of tonight's rose ceremony.</p>

<p>Nurse Irena, 31, posted a snap of herself in a sparkly blazer dress accompanied by a cheeky caption that suggested she and Locky are still very close. </p>

<p>'Stole this from Locky's wardrobe': How Bella and Irena’s (pictured) pre-cocktail party promo snaps hint who wins</p>

<p>'Stole this from Locky’s wardrobe. We are back tonight at 7:30,' she captioned the post, followed by a monkey emoji. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, marketing consultant Bella, 25, posted a picture of herself in a pink zebra print dress accompanied by a rather flat caption. </p>

<p>'Emotions are running high tonight. Tune in at 7:30pm as we reach the tail end of this crazy journey,' she wrote. </p>

<p>End of the road? Bella (pictured) said 'emotions are running high' in tonight's episode and that she was reaching 'the tail end of this crazy journey'</p>

<p>Bella's reference to 'the tail end of the journey' seems to suggest that her relationship with Locky will end once The Bachelor finishes. </p>

<p>It is rumoured that Bella and Irena will be the final two contestants who Locky has to choose between. </p>

<p>The marketing consultant is set to confront Locky about Irena on Wednesday night's episode, which actually seems to play in Irena's favour. </p>

<p>Competition! It is rumoured that Bella and Irena will be the final two contestants who Locky has to choose between. Contestants Izzy, Irena, Bella and Steph</p>

<p>'I decided to say something to Locky because it seems like she's getting into his head,' Bella said in a promo. </p>

<p>But Locky was having none of it, saying:  'I am actually pretty pretty upset, I have seen a side of Bella I didn't think I would see'.  </p>

<p>The Bachelor is then shown insisting they go back to the party, while Bella tries to make him stay with her.</p>

<p>'I really hope it's not too late,' a distressed Bella says at the end of the clip. </p>

<p>Oh dear: In a promo clip, Bella is seen at the dinner party, ragingly angry, and decides to confront Locky</p>
