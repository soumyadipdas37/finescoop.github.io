<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the hilarious moment a rare Kermode 'spirit' bear stands on its hind legs and starts scratching its back on a wooden power pole.</p>

<p>A footage recorded in Terrace, British Columbia, Canada, the white bear is seen wandering up to a massive wooden power pole.</p>

<p>After a quick glance up, the bear stands up on its hind legs and leans its back against the pillar.</p>

<p>A rare Kermode bear stands up on its hind legs and leans against a wooden power pole Terrace, British Columbia, Canada, before moving up and down to scratch its back before grabbing hold of the post with a paw and trying to nibble it</p>

<p>Once comfortable, the bear then lifts its head up so that the top is also against the post and starts rubbing up and down against it.</p>

<p>Clearly enjoying itself, the bear reaches up to the pole with one of its paws and grabs hold and begins wiggling side to side.</p>

<p>The Kermode bear's near-rhythmic movement could almost be mistaken for dancing.</p>

<p>It then attempts to nibble the pole before continuing to scratch its back and then walking off into the forest.</p>

<p>After its back is suitable scratched, the bear climbs down from its pole and wanders off back into the forest</p>

<p>The video was originally recorded on August 27 and has recently re-emerged after being shared on social media.</p>

<p>Kermode bears, also known as spirit bears, are a sub-species of the American black bear with a rare gene that turns their fur white or cream.</p>

<p>Though not considered endangered, there are believed to only be around 400 Kermode bears left in the wild.</p>

<p>Only one in ten black bears possess the gene that turns their fur light and in order for it to be passed onto baby bears, both parents must have it. </p>
