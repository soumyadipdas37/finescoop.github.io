<p>The character was played by two different actors in the first two seasons of the series, but Hafthor took over the role in season four and continued until the final season, making him the one most identified with the part.</p>

<p>Despite originally working as a waitress, Kelsey seems to have taken up her husband's passion for fitness, and she regularly shows off her own muscles on Instagram, even after announcing her pregnancy.</p>

<p>A week ago, Hafthor announced on his Instagram that he was quarantining after possibly being exposed to someone who contracted the novel coronavirus, but he appeared to have gotten a negative test result and was able to be with his wife in time for the birth.</p>
