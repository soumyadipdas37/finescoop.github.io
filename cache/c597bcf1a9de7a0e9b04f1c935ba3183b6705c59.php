<p>'We want to give as much of a leg up to those people who want to travel as soon as possible,' the premier said on Monday.</p>

<p>'The numbers are looking really good. Just four new (coronavirus) cases in NSW. If they give us the advice tomorrow, we'll be very quick to open that border.</p>

<p>'I'm very keen to open that border the minute I get the advice that it's safe to do so.'    </p>

<p>Eased restrictions would allow families to be reunited in the lead up to the September school holidays and the October long weekend.  </p>

<p>The pandemic-induced lockdowns and border restrictions have jeopardised one million tourism jobs, and are set to cost the country a whopping $54.6billion this year. </p>

<p>But on Monday, Ms Palaszczuk doubled down on her stance, telling reporters she is prepared lose the election to maintain hard borders and keep COVID-19 out of her state. </p>

<p>The premier has come under sustained fire from federal Coalition politicians like Prime Minister Scott Morrison, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and the state's opposition Liberal National Party over the Queensland's strict border policies in recent weeks.    </p>

<p>Political opponents have accused Ms Palaszczuk of being heartless for not being more lenient about exemptions on compassionate grounds ahead of the election on October 31.</p>

<p>She's promised to speed up the exemption application process, but she will stake her political future on keeping borders shut.</p>

<p>'Now if it means I have to lose the election, I will risk all that if it means keeping Queenslanders safe,' Ms Palaszczuk said on Monday. </p>
