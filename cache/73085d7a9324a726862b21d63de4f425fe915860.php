<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Around a ton of cocaine has been discovered concealed within shipments of fruit at the Kent port.</p>

<p>The class A drugs, which have a street value of approximately £100 million, were discovered in pallets which had arrived into the Port of Dover on a vessel from South America on Tuesday morning.    </p>

<p>The 'huge seizure' will now take away a 'valuable commodity that would have been sold to fund further serious and organised criminality', the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. </p>

<p>Following the joint operation by the NCA and Police Scotland Organised Crime Partnership, two men have been arrested on suspicion of importing class A drugs. </p>

<p>Around a ton of cocaine was discovered in pallets which had arrived into Dover on a vessel from South America on Tuesday morning</p>

<p>The 40-year-old from Brentwood, Essex, and the 64-year-old from central Glasgow were questioned before being released under investigation.     </p>

<p>The investigation, which is linked to Operation Venetic, has so far seen hundreds of arrests across the UK following the infiltration of an encrypted communications platform.</p>

<p>NCA director of investigations Nikki Holland said: 'This is a huge seizure of class A drugs, made as a result of some excellent joint working between the NCA and Police Scotland under the Organised Crime Partnership (Scotland), and our Border Force colleagues.</p>

<p>'This operation has prevented a large amount of cocaine from making it on to our streets, we estimate that once adulterated and sold it could have had a street value of up to £100 million.</p>

<p>'So in making this seizure we have taken away a valuable commodity that would have been sold to fund further serious and organised criminality.</p>

<p>'Our investigation into this attempted importation is continuing.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Angela McLaren, assistant chief constable organised crime, counter terrorism and intelligence, said: 'This seizure is undoubtedly a massive setback for serious and organised criminals.</p>

<p>The discovery was made following a joint operation by the NCA and Police Scotland Organised Crime</p>

<p>The NCA said the class A drug were found by the team concealed within fruit at the port of Dover</p>

<p>'This operation and our other recent successes underline our unwavering commitment to working with partners, including the NCA, Border Force and SOC Taskforce, to disrupt this sort of criminality.</p>

<p>'Working together we will relentlessly pursue those who seek to bring misery to our communities whether they are in Scotland or elsewhere in the world.'</p>

<p>Searches have been carried out in Glasgow and Essex as the investigation continues, the NCA said. </p>

<p>The Organised Crime Partnership (Scotland) is a covert investigation team comprising of officers and staff from Police Scotland and the NCA.</p>
