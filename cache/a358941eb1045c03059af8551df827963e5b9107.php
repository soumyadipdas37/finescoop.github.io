<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain today recorded 10 more coronavirus deaths in the preliminary count, with all of the fatalities occurring in England.</p>

<p>Health officials have yet to confirm the final daily figure, which takes into account data from every setting across the UK. The early count for England only includes laboratory-confirmed victims in NHS-ran hospitals.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the virus claimed 17 more lives - down from 34 on Saturday - although fatalities are normally lower on Sundays and Mondays due to a lag in the way they are recorded in hospitals.  </p>

<p>Today's jump means Britain's coronavirus death toll stands at 41,998, the worst in Europe, with only the US, Brazil, India and Mexico recording more fatalities.</p>
