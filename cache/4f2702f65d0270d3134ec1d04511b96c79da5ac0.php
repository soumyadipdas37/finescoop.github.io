<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits they 'will have some fun' with Curtis Jones after the youngster starred in their 7-2 Carabao Cup third-round victory over Lincoln.</p>

<p>The Toxteth-born 19-year-old scored twice to help take the game beyond their hosts before half-time and dictated play from midfield like an experienced pro.</p>

<p>Klopp has introduced the teenager gradually to his first team but he looks set to play a more involved role this season.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has talked up 'exceptional talent' Curtis Jones after his brace at Lincoln</p>

<p>The 19-year-old took both his goals fabulously well, earning the man-of-the-match award</p>

<p>'First half really good, start of the second half really good,' was Klopp's assessment of the youngster's performance.</p>

<p>'There is still space for improvement but everyone knows my opinion of Curtis Jones, he is an exceptional talent and we will have some fun with him I am pretty sure in the future.</p>

<p>'Both goals were difficult, the second one the first touch was absolutely exceptional between two opponents and then he opens up and sees the opportunity and finishes it off.'</p>

<p>Xherdan Shaqiri, somebody who has become something of a fringe player in the last 18 months and would be one of the men Liverpool would be happy to offload, opened the scoring with a superb free-kick and had a good game in midfield.</p>

<p>Jones bossed the midfield on Thursday night and Klopp admits he has a big future</p>

<p>Klopp offered some hope to the Swiss, and the likes of Divock Origi who scored an 89th-minute goal to round off the scoring but was relatively ineffectual apart from that, as he insisted the door is not closed on anyone's career.</p>

<p>'Everyone used the opportunity to show up, that is very important,' he said.</p>

<p>'My door is always open and if a player shows desire - because they all can play football - that is why they are at Liverpool. There are a lot of games in the season.</p>

<p>'They showed desire, we saw attitude tonight, so many things of what I like and what we want to see from a Liverpool team.</p>

<p>'Really a lot of good things and that is why we came here, we wanted to win but we wanted to play good as well and I saw a good game.'Lincoln manager Michael Appleton admitted his League One side were out-classed but was still disappointed in the scoreline.</p>

<p>Xherdan Shaqiri may have forced his way back into Klopp's plans after quite brilliant free-kick</p>

<p>'I think in the first half there was a class of finishing from Liverpool, with one or two mistakes,' he said.</p>

<p>'We had a couple of moments ourselves in the first half but in the second half it was very difficult and a disappointing performance - I thought we should have scored four or five goals.'</p>

<p>Liverpool's first four goals were all scored from outside the penalty area and Appleton was asked if they could have done more to stop them.</p>

<p>'If we had put some kind of bucket in the top corner or maybe a sheet to stop them going in,' he said.</p>

<p>'In terms of the build-up for the second and fourth goals we definitely could have prevented them with a couple of different decision.</p>

<p>'But you get punished by these side at this level.'</p>
