<p> 'Can't believe it,' DJ Yousef tweeted. 'Only spoke to him last week... he was troubled, less than perfect but was always amazing to me and helped us get circus going in the early days, and we had many amazing times over the 20 years we were friends. Genuinely gutted. RIP.'</p>

<p>'Heartbreaking news. No words. Rest In Peace,' DJ Joseph Capriati wrote alongside a picture of himself with Morillo.</p>

<p>'Will always be a massive honour to have DJed for him at his Subliminal Sessions Arena's.' </p>

<p>DJ Lölsch added: 'Terrible news. Erick Morillo RIP. A legend has left us.'</p>

<p>Morillo's death comes less than four weeks after he was arrested in Miami on August 6 and charged with sexual battery after a rape kit allegedly came back positive for his DNA. </p>

<p>He was set to appear in court on Friday.  </p>

<p>Morillo had denied the allegations made against him by a fellow female DJ who claimed he raped her at his home in December 2019. </p>

<p>DJ Anton Powers recalled playing for Morillo years ago</p>

<p>Police said that Morillo and the female DJ had been hired to work a private event and went back to his house for drinks afterwards with another unidentified female. </p>

<p>According to the police report, the alleged victim told authorities that Morillo 'made several advances towards her, some sexual in nature, but she refused all of his attempts'.</p>

<p>The victim said in the report that she took an Uber to his home and put on a bathing suit to go swimming when she got there but felt uncomfortable after he made advances so she changed back, according to the Miami New Times. </p>

<p>She told police that he apologized so she decided to stay and later went to sleep alone somewhere in the house.</p>

<p>The victim claimed she woke up 'nude on the bed and that Morillo was 'standing on the side of the bed also nude.' Following the alleged assault, the victim said she was in pain and called 911 to report being raped. </p>

<p>She was taken to a rape-treatment facility and had a rape kit done. The results of that kit came back this week positive for Morillo's DNA, police said.     </p>

<p>Miami Beach police had responded to the scene of the incident following the 911 call and Morillo told them he had already 'spoken with his attorney prior to their arrival,' according to the Miami New Times.</p>

<p>In his recorded statement, Morillo denied that he raped the woman but told cops that he did have sex with the second woman who had also gone back to his house for drinks.  </p>

<p>According to the report, the second woman told investigators that she slept on the couch and didn't see anything. </p>

<p>Morillo's attorney said in a statement to DailyMail.com: 'Mr. Morillo's arrest is based on an incident that occurred back on December 7, 2019. Since then, Mr. Morillo has fully cooperated with the police. </p>

<p>'It is important the public understands that the police report contains mere allegations and Mr. Morillo is presumed innocent. There is more to the story than what is in the initial police report, and I look forward to sharing this evidence as I defend Mr. Morillo in court. </p>

<p>'Our system of justice requires that an accused is treated fairly and with due process. Mr. Morillo will be exercising all of his constitutional rights and I am confident when all of the evidence is presented in this case, justice will be served, and Mr. Morillo will be vindicated.'</p>

<p>Morillo was born in New York to Colombian parents but considered Miami to be his home. </p>

<p>He released his first album Move It! in 1994, followed by Are You Ready For Some More in 1996.  </p>

<p>In addition to spinning, Morillo produced music under a number of aliases including Ministers de la Funk, The Dronez, RAW, Smooth Touch, RBM, Deep Soul, Club Ultimate and Li'l Mo Ying Yang. </p>

<p>In the years before his death Morillo was open about his struggles with ketamine and alcohol addiction, which he said he had overcome in 2017.  </p>

<p>'I went to rehab three times and even after all three I never gave up alcohol,' Morillo told Skiddle. 'That was what seemed to keep pulling me under. So, besides the fact that I hurt so many people, I think the most difficult part was coming to the realization that I was going to have to go completely sober.'</p>

<p>'It was a scary thing because you think life is going to be boring then,' he continued.  'What's life going to be like if I can't drink and if I can't go to a place where there's drinking?</p>

<p>'You stop worrying about the future and you start focusing on the right now. So, the beginning of being completely sober was the hardest part. Once I had six months under my belt it was very easy.'</p>

<p>At the time Morillo revealed that he was going to therapy and was happy about where his life was at.  </p>

<p>'I've accomplished so much in my career and I'm happy about who I am today,' he said. </p>

<p>'I don't have to be the biggest, the greatest, the youngest. These were just pressures I put on myself: "Oh my God, that's it, my career is over!" </p>

<p>'I did it to myself. Because I didn't talk to anybody those ideas were just stuck in my head and that made me depressed and made me want to use. Now I don't feel like that.'</p>

<p>Morillo continued playing shows up until the pandemic struck, shutting down nightlife venues around the country. </p>

<p>On July 24 he tweeted a photo of himself performing with the caption: 'I miss going to work.' </p>

<p>Morillo was born in New York to Colombian parents but considered Miami to be his home</p>
