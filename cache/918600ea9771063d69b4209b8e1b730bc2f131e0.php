<p>'I'm fine on my own and I've come to terms with being on my own. I'm better off on my own.</p>

<p>'I know I don't have the best track record in telling the truth when it comes to women. But I promise there aren't any other women on the scene.</p>

<p>'I am so busy at the minute and I have no time, especially with a 10pm curfew, it's not like you can go out later.'</p>

<p>A source told The Sun on Sunday: 'They crossed the line from friendship to romance and it got messy.</p>

<p>In celebration of National Hair Day, Pete had 6 inches cut from his long locks, leaving him with a short bob.</p>

<p>The reality star said the transformation was a 'massive deal' for him and he was 'very nervous' before letting celebrity stylist Jonathan Andrew loose on his hair.</p>

<p>Pete had the haircut with brand Fudge Professional, who documented the styling session in a short video.  </p>

<p>Talking about the cut, Pete said: 'I had 6 inches off it, which is a massive deal for me. It's the shortest it's been in six years, so since me joining TOWIE.</p>

<p>New look: In celebration of National Hair Day, Pete had 6 inches cut from his long locks, leaving him with a short bob </p>

<p>'In all seriousness, I was very nervous. I haven't had my hair cut in 10 months, since way before lockdown. It might not look it but it feels so much healthier.</p>

<p>'People seem to be obsessed with my hair – in general it's the only thing people like about me. It also disguises my oddly shaped potato head.</p>

<p>'I had a skinhead for 15 years and I only grew my hair because everyone told me I was going bald. I grew it when I was 25 and then it became a thing.</p>

<p>'My mum is over the moon that I've had it cut because I'm like the little girl she never wanted. She likes it this length but now that I've started, you never know.'</p>
