<p>Career change: Beloved children's author Paul Jennings spoke about what led to his decision to become a professional writer at the age of 40. Pictured at his home in Melbourne in May 2005</p>

<p>Paul said at the age of 12, he decided to send a story into The Australian Women's Weekly, hoping they'd publish it, only to receive a rejection letter in return.</p>

<p>'I was so hurt by it that I thought they're all geniuses, writers, I could never make it,' he confessed. </p>

<p>He added: 'I didn't have another go until I was nearly 40.'</p>

<p>Devastated: During an interview on The Project on Monday, the 77-year-old revealed he was put off pursuing a career as an author at the age of 12, after receiving a rejection letter</p>

<p>Paul said he was experiencing a lot of changes in his life, including the breakdown of his marriage, which left him caring for his four children.</p>

<p>He said he was working as a lecturer at the time, while also studying, and told his boss he wouldn't have the time to finish his Master's degree.</p>

<p>His boss told him the lack of a degree would cause him to lose his job, and suggested he pursue something different instead.</p>

<p>Quite the resume: The author eventually went on to write countless children's books. Pictured, some of his stories</p>

<p>It was then that Paul came back to writing, enrolling in a course in Melbourne, after his boss generously loaned him his car to get there.</p>

<p>He said the course was being run by author Carmel Byrne, who asked everyone in the class to submit a short story.</p>

<p>'She said, "They are all good, but one has got something special. I'm going to read it out." I thought, "Please let it be mine." As we left the class, she said, "You're good,"' he recounted. </p>
