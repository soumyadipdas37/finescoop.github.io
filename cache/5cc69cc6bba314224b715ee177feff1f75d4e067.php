<p>The trailer opens with the Devil asking his minions who they should recruit to wreak havoc on Earth. </p>

<p>'We work with Charles Manson, Richard Nixon, Hitler...when was the last time you ran into a genuine dark triad? Minions, do we have anybody that'll fit that bill?' the Devil asks. </p>

<p>One minion raises his hand and says: 'I've got one,' as the screen cuts to Griffin as Trump - complete with a jarring fake tan and yellow quaff - strutting through a mansion.  </p>

<p>'He's a narcissist, he's Machiavellian, a psychopath,' the minion says before another exclaims: 'A dark triad!' </p>

<p>Trump is then seen looking in a mirror and telling himself: 'If a guy from Kenya not even born in the US can become president, you can too.' </p>

<p>'Bad President is a film we all need to see especially before the 2020 election to remind us of the incidents that took place five years ago,' Gill said over the summer.</p>

<p>'I enjoyed taking Trump's true statements and unforgettable moments and turning them into something we could all laugh at.' </p>

<p>VMI founder Andre Relis added: 'The world is laughing at Trump not with him – this film really nails it. </p>
