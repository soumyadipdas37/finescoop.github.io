<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Parents concerned that religion has ignored their LGBT children have been assured by Pope Francis that God loved their children as they are.</p>

<p>He spoke to the parents of 40 of LGBT children from the Italian association, Tenda di Gionata (Jonathan’s Tent). </p>

<p>Members of Jonathan's Tent welcomes LGBT Christians, their families and pastoral workers and it provides them with support and information.</p>

<p>It was founded in 2018 by a group of people inspired by a Catholic priest, the late Reverend David Esposito, of the Diocese of Fermo, in the Marches region of Italy.</p>

<p>Mara Grassi, vice president of the association, along with her husband Agostino Usai presented the Pope with a booklet entitled Genitori Fortunati (Fortunate Parents).</p>

<p>Pope Francis has reassured the parents of LGBT children that God loved them</p>

<p>The booklet documented the experiences of the parents of LGBT children with the church.</p>

<p>It stated that many of the experiences were difficult and that, despite seeking to be accepted by the church, they were too often seen as undesirables. </p>

<p>Mara told Pope Francis: 'We wish to create a bridge to the church so that the church too can change its way of looking at our children, no longer excluding them but fully welcoming them.'</p>

<p>The Pope met the parents' group following the public audience in the Renaissance courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican.</p>

<p>Speaking to Avvenire, the daily paper of the Italian Bishops' Conference, she said: 'our association aims to foster dialogue between the church and the families of LGBT (people). </p>

<p>'We consider ourselves fortunate because we had to change the way that we had always looked at our children.</p>

<p>'We found a new way of looking that enabled us to see in them the beauty and love of God.' </p>

<p>Members of the Jonathan's Tent group met the Pope to discuss religion and LGBT people</p>

<p>Mara revealed that she is the mother of four children, the oldest who is gay, and that she did not feel that the church accepted him.</p>

<p>She said: 'After I came to know that my son was homosexual, I suffered a lot because the rules of the church made me think that he was excluded from the love of God.' </p>

<p>The group gave the Pope a rainbow coloured T-shirt with the words 'In Love There Is No Fear' on it.</p>

<p>He told them: 'The church does not exclude them because she loves them deeply. </p>

<p>'God loves our children because they are all children of God. The church loves our children as they are.'</p>
