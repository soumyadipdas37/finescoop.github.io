<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Ham and Newcastle are among the clubs showing an interest in Juventus defender Daniele Rugani.</p>

<p>The Italian champions are willing to listen to offers for the 26-year-old as they look to balance the books.</p>

<p>Rugani, who has been on the periphery of June’s first team, has been offered to Premier League clubs with Juventus hoping to sell to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>Juventus defender Daniele Rugani is attracting interest from both West Ham and Newcastle</p>

<p>Italian international Rugani (right) is not a regular in the starting XI for the Serie A champions</p>

<p>Newcastle though are exploring loan deals with their own budget limited following the arrival of Callum Wilson, Jamal Lewis, Jeff Hendrick and Ryan Fraser.</p>

<p>They had arranged to sign Rob Holding from Arsenal on loan before that was put on hold and Steve Bruce sees centre back as a priority before the window closes.</p>

<p>West Ham also have an interest in Italy international Rugani but are juggling a couple of options after their bids for Burnley’s James Tarkowski were rebuffed.</p>

<p>Watford’s Craig Dawson is understood to be one of those of interest but is also on Fulham’s list of defensive targets.</p>
