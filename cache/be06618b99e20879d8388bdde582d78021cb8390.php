<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Some TV shows become such a major part of popular culture that actors who star in them are forever known by their characters' names. </p>

<p>However, the design of sets also sticks in people's minds, to the extent that just one image is enough to trigger instant recognition. </p>

<p>A new quiz developed by HouseholdQuotes puts your telly show knowledge to the test by showing a minimalist take on the sets of some of the world's most iconic shows.</p>

<p>Among those featured are long-running TV classics as well as more recent global successes. With the help of some handy clues, put your knowledge to the test and then check out the answers below... </p>

<ol>
<li>Things Are Pretty Strange Around Here </li>
</ol>

<p>This one should be pretty easy - especially if you consider the dated style of the furniture</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>The One with the New Yorkers </li>
</ol>

<p>The signature colour scheme says a lot here, as does the picture frame on the door and the open cupboards</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>It's the Accepted Creation Theory </li>
</ol>

<p>Do you get the feeling here that geeks might be somewhere nearby? Batman and Superman are standing in front a nice and clean whiteboard</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Gritty Melodrama, Four Times a Week </li>
</ol>

<p>This is almost too easy. Let's just say it has been running since the 1980s and features a very famous pub</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>This Show is a Ball </li>
</ol>

<p>This is slightly trickier but it might help if we tell you that a third season is in the pipeline - and it's a very glamorous show...</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>A Show About Very Little </li>
</ol>

<p>This show's title character ended up as an unlikely style icon, even though the final episode aired more than 30 years ago</p>

<ol start="7">
<li>Beaming into Your Living Room… </li>
</ol>

<p>This set has become a major part of TV fandom, especially for dedicated fans of the show in question</p>

<ol start="8">
<li>Vampires Beware </li>
</ol>

<p>There's a fair amount going on in this set mock-up, but it shouldn't be too tricky to guess the show</p>

<ol start="9">
<li>Sitcom. Or Documentary. Meh. </li>
</ol>

<p>A version of this show was first made in the UK before it was taken to the US and became even more popular</p>

<ol start="10">
<li>America's First Family </li>
</ol>

<p>This show has been running for so long that many people forget that new episodes are still being made</p>

<ol start="11">
<li>It's the New Upstairs Downstairs </li>
</ol>

<p>This creation gripped millions of viewers across the world and turned some stars into household names</p>

<ol start="12">
<li>Everyone's Favourite Mum &amp; Daughter Show </li>
</ol>

<p>This show first ran in the early 2000s and centred on the relationship between a mother and daughter</p>

<ol start="13">
<li>These Girls are Golden </li>
</ol>

<p>This show pre-dates another iconic classic but it doesn't mean that people of all generations can't have a good guess</p>

<ol start="14">
<li>What's the Weather Like in Philly? </li>
</ol>

<p>The familiar shade of slime green in this poster should be a hint for fans of this show, although you can take a guess if you're still not sure</p>

<ol start="15">
<li>A Very Dangerous Game </li>
</ol>

<p>Fans of this show were just a little disappointed with the final series' finale but it has still gained global recognition</p>
