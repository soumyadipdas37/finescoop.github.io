<p>More trouble: Memphis Garrett has been accused by fans of calling co-star David Alexander the N-word when he was talking to Cody Calafiore during Wednesday's live feed of the CBS reality TV series</p>

<p>Not in an easy place: Memphis has also been hard on David calling him a 'boy'</p>

<p>Fans noticed and shared clips from the live feed on Twitter. Now many viewers are demanding that Garrett be fired from the show.</p>

<p>Fans have also accused Garrett of being hard on Alexander in the past, like by calling him a 'boy.'</p>

<p>They also note it is unfair to treat David this way especially since he is the only remaining black person on the show after several others were evicted or threatened. </p>

<p>There have been several petitions circulating asking for Memphis' removal. </p>

<p>Change.org has a petition from fan Sophia that asks for Memphis be taken off the show because he has done 'racially charged things' to David and his behavior is 'disgusting.' </p>

<p>Not a wise move: And Memphis seemed to show his guilt of using the N-word when he made a face after Cody told him to watch out </p>

<p>Coming to David's defense: Now many viewers are demanding that Garrett be fired from the show. They also note it is unfair to treat David this way especially since he is the only remaining black person on the show after several others were evicted or threatened</p>

<p>The 37-year-old Garrett, who is from Tennessee, has yet to comment on the alleged use of the N-word as he is sequestered on the set of Big Brother: All Stars and cannot be reached.</p>

<p>DailyMail.com reached out to CBS for comment but did not get an immediate reply. In the past the network has claimed to not condone that comments made by the guests of the show, </p>

<p>It was just a week ago that Big Brother: All-Stars contestants Memphis, Christmas Abbott, Dani Briones, and Nicole Franzel were seen on live feeds laughing and making fun of Terry.</p>

<p>They criticized his self-soothing technique of rocking back and forth. </p>

<p>Memphis compared Ian to the young boy from The Shining, mimicking the child's 'Red rum' line. </p>

<p>'It stresses me out': Garrett was among the contestants making fun of Ian Terry on Big Brother: All-Stars last week</p>

<p>'It stresses me out,' Memphis said, adding it 'scares me.' </p>

<p>He even said he may have nightmares of Ian rocking at the end of his bed. </p>

<p>In a conversation with Nicole, Dani said watching Ian rock back and forth stressed her out.</p>

<p>'I can't even look at him sometimes because his constant movement, it stresses me out. Do you feel like that?' Dani asked.</p>

<p>Cruel: Terry was the subject of cruel jokes made by Big Brother contestants making fun of his autism self-soothing techniques</p>

<p>So many mean girls in the group: The others could be seen laughing as the bullying continued </p>

<p>'Yeah I do sometimes,' Nicole replied.</p>

<p>'I feel mean saying that, but I'll literally have to move to a point where I can't see him out of my peripheral vision,' Dani continued.</p>

<p>The comments were made behind Ian's back, but many Twitter users took offense to the remarks. </p>

<p>Bullying: He even said he may have nightmares of Ian rocking at the end of his bed</p>

<p>'Disappointed': Big Brother viewers were offended by the comments contestants made</p>

<p>'Memphis, Dani, Nicole, and Christmas y'all need to GO!!!! Laughing at man for his autism is a BIG PROBLEM! As a father of a wonderful autistic boy, I do not stand for any type of bullying. This is complete garbage and needs to be addressed publicly. Do better!' tweeted <?php echo e('@'); ?>MannyLemus81.</p>

<p>'Not cool. I love Ian. He opened up about being on the spectrum and this is what he gets!?' tweeted <?php echo e('@'); ?>JodisBox.</p>

<p>'Disappointed = understatement. #BBAllStars contestants openly mock #IanTerry for his autism and self soothing behaviors due to autism. #danibriones #NicoleFranzel #christmasabbott You've been faves of mine for years Not sure I can watch anymore. I can't let my son w/autism watch,' tweeted <?php echo e('@'); ?>MonGrayRN.</p>

<p>Big Brother alum Kaysar Ridha was among the many taking a stand on the issue.</p>

<p>'Inside the BB house reflects society's failures when it comes to our handling of diversity. We could use a lesson in empathy &amp; awareness. Ppl who are neurodiverse &amp; on the spectrum should be protected not trashed. I have zero tolerance on this issue #BB22,' he tweeted.</p>

<p>Ian has previously opened up about his struggles living with autism inside the Big Brother house.</p>

<p>In a recent episode, Ian called the competition 'autistic hell.'</p>

<p>'This is like autistic hell, and I mean, you know, you can tell right? I'm autistic... I gave up on trying to hide it,' he told Kaysar. </p>

<p>In the diary room, Ian said he wasn't defined by his diagnosis.</p>

<p>'Being on the spectrum isn't my identity. I'm a smart guy, I have a great family, friends, girlfriend, and I won Big Brother.'</p>

<p>This is not the first time Big Brother contestants have been slammed for making racist or offensive remarks.</p>

<p>In a 2019 statement, CBS and show producers condoned some of the opinions expressed by their contestants.</p>

<p>'At times, the houseguests say things that we do not condone,' read the statement obtained by Us Weekly. 'We share some of the viewers' concerns about inappropriate behavior and offensive comments, and producers have addressed specific incidents with the houseguests involved. However, there is absolutely no truth that the casting of the show is racially motivated, that the houseguests' behavior is predetermined or that the outcome is controlled in any way.'</p>
