<p>Still having fun: Kendall Jenner has been enjoying an extended vacation in nature with her friends this week. And the 24-year-old supermodel invited her 138M Instagram followers in on the getaway as she shared several new images on Thursday</p>

<p>Ride on: The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was seen in different swimwear as she made the most of her time away from Los Angeles and New York City. 'I love lakes,' the sister of Kylie Jenner wrote in her caption</p>

<p>Her sister Kim Kardashian quickly posted, 'Me too'; and Kourtney Kardashian's ex Scott Disick replied, 'Who doesn't.' Khloe Kardashian clicked 'like' as did 2M others. </p>

<p>Her longtime male pal Fai Khadra added, 'Lakes love you.' </p>

<p>In the first image the star had on a yellow floral 1960s style print string bikini as she took a mirror selfie where her face was hardly visible.</p>

<p>The suit tied in the front with a lazy bow hanging down over her stomach area.</p>

<p>Kim K approved: Her sister Kim Kardashian quickly posted, 'Me too'; and Kourtney Kardashian's ex Scott Disick replied, 'Who doesn't.' Khloe Kardashian clicked 'like' as did 2M others</p>

<p>Her tummy looked very flat with abs and she had sculpted legs and arms, proving she wants to stay in cover girl shape.</p>

<p>A gold necklace with a round pendant hung from her neck as a nice on-trend accent. </p>

<p>The Chanel runway star was also seen in the exact same suit as she was pictured on a blue and white jetski on a lake. The image was of her back and her face not visible.</p>

<p>Tan time: She also treated her followers to an image of her laying down on a blue and white towel over a wood dock. Her bikini body was on display as she had on another two piece that also highlighted her fit midsection</p>

<p>Good view: This cute suit was white with red flowers and a red piping on the edges. She had on a blue baseball cap and her knees up. The star had on the same gold necklace as well</p>

<p>Kendall held onto a beverage as a red plaid shirt was seen next to her. </p>

<p>Long legs: This photo was of the 5ft10in in a pair of denim overalls over her bikini as she stood on a wood fence. The jet setter added Converse sneakers</p>

<p>The jet setter added Converse sneakers. </p>

<p>The day before she was loving the fresh air as she enjoyed a hike through the mountains.</p>

<p>Kendall looked sensational as she jumped up and smiled for the camera while wrapping her bombshell body in a chic black unitard. </p>

<p>Kendall was ready to go in her sporty one-piece, which she paired with practical hiking boots. She also carried a pair of goggles in one hand, just in case the wind decided to pick up.</p>

<p>Not needing much makeup, she went with a fresh-faced glow and kept her chocolate tresses hanging loose.</p>

<p>First Jenner shared a snap of herself in front of some pine trees with mountains and a cloudy sky in the background.</p>

<p>Then she got an action shot, seen steadying herself while going down a rocky trail.</p>

<p>Kendall wasn't afraid to get a bit dirty, also sharing a first-person look at her dust covered legs and shoes. </p>

<p>It was unclear where the IMG beauty was enjoying the outdoors, but she was last spotted in LA on August 23rd.</p>

<p>Recently Jenner has been enjoying time with new flame Devin Booker, who she was seen putting on a steamy display with in Malibu last month.</p>

<p>While things looked hot and heavy between the pair, Kendall and Devin aren't taking things too seriously according to sources.</p>

<p>'They're hooking up, but they're not serious,' a source told Us Weekly over the weekend. </p>

<p>Roughing it: Kendall wasn't afraid to get a bit dirty, also sharing a first-person look at her dust covered legs and shoes</p>

<p>It seems Booker isn't the only one Jenner may have an interest in, according to the insider who said: 'She's talking to a couple different guys. She has so many men after her it's crazy.'</p>

<p>Kendall and Devin were first spotted together in April and have been fueling gossip ever since. In July they appeared to go on a trip to Sedona, Arizona together, only intensifying rumors.</p>

<p>While Jenner's always shown a liking for basketball players - previously dating the 76ers' Ben Simmons and Pistons pro Blake Griffin - Booker's relationship history makes him an interesting choice.</p>

<p>Devin previously dated her sister Kylie's ex bestie Jordyn Woods, who was booted from the Kardashian/Jenner inner circle after smooching Khloe Kardashian's babydaddy Tristan Thompson, who plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers.  </p>
