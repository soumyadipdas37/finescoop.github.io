<p>Citigroup has named Scottish-born Jane Fraser as its next boss.</p>

<p>The married mother-of-two – who described pursuing a career while bringing up children as 'the toughest thing I have ever had to do' – will make history next year as she becomes the first woman to lead one of America's biggest banks.</p>

<p>Citigroup has named Scottish-born mother-of-two Jane Fraser as its next boss. It means she becomes the first woman to lead one of America's biggest banks</p>

<p>The appointment was hailed by fellow bankers on Wall Street.</p>

<p>'Great news for the company and for women everywhere,' tweeted Bank of America operations and technology chief Cathy Bessant. 'A big and fantastic moment.'</p>

<p>Born in St Andrews, the 53-yer-old has degrees from Harvard Business School and Cambridge University.</p>

<p>She has worked at Citi for 16 years, and is its president and the boss of its sprawling consumer bank.</p>

<p>She will replace Mike Corbat, 60, who is stepping down next February after 37 years at Citi, including eight at the helm.</p>

<p>Fraser, who has long been a rising star in the financial services industry, has already made her mark at the lender. </p>

<p>During her time as head of the private bank, she increased revenue by more than a fifth between 2010 and 2013.</p>

<p>She started her career at Goldman Sachs and before joining Citi in 2004, Fraser (pictured) was a partner at advisory giant McKinsey &amp; Company where she also made an impression on colleagues. </p>

<p>Then 26, she said she would only take the job if she could work directly for the head of banking.</p>

<p>Lowell Bryan, who held that position, was so impressed by her forthright attitude that he hired her. In a McKinsey report, she later said: 'Being a mother of young children and having a career is the toughest thing I have ever had to do.</p>

<p>'You are exhausted, guilty, and you must learn how to do things differently. It was the making of me because I became much more 80-20 – focusing on what was really important – got good at saying no, and also became more human to the clients who also face many of these issues too.'</p>

<p>JP Morgan, America's most profitable bank, may soon be following in Citi's footsteps as Marianne Lake is widely tipped to become the next boss when Jamie Dimon retires in around five years.</p>

<p>Lake, 51, who is also British, has spoken about the importance of diversity in finance.</p>
