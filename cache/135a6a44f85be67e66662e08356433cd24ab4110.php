<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The possibility of Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder going toe-to-toe without spectators has been dealt a knockout blow by the former's promoter, Frank Warren.</p>

<p>The highly-anticipated trilogy fight had been pencilled in for this year after Fury beat Wilder in February to win the WBC heavyweight title.</p>

<p>However, those plans have been put on hold due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Tyson Fury's (left) trilogy fight with Deontay Wilder will not take place without spectators there</p>

<p>The trilogy bout had been scheduled to take place this year before the Covid-19 pandemic hit</p>

<p>But, Fury's promoter Frank Warren says it will only happen with fans due to stop revenue loss</p>

<p>Boxing has returned in recent months with Warren holding fight cards without fans but he has ruled out this possibility for this bout due to the sheer size of it - instead suggesting that it could be held outside of the UK or USA if the landscape is different in another country.</p>

<p>Speaking on Wednesday's Good Morning Britain, Fury's UK-based promoter said: 'Not a fight of that magnitude [taking place without fans].</p>

<p>'Wilder and Fury was the highest grossing fight to ever take place in Vegas. We just can't lose that gate. It's a huge amount of money. We need the gate.</p>

<p>'Or we come up with a scenario where there is a huge site fee from a territory to take it, and we use it to promote their country.</p>

<p>'We are looking at those situations.'</p>

<p>The previous two bouts have taken place in Las Vegas and Fury's US-based promoter, Top Rank's Bob Arum, previously revealed he is working on a protocol with the Nevada commission that would allow a limited amount of fans to gain entry.</p>

<p>Fury is the current WBC heavyweight champion after a seventh-round stoppage of Wilder</p>

<p>'It is quite frustrating to be honest but we're not in this boat alone,' Fury told Good Morning Britain on Wednesday when asked about the situation.</p>

<p>'I'm not the only athlete on the planet who is not active at the moment. We're all in it together.</p>

<p>'We're all working as a team to source a date and a venue. Hopefully they'll allow crowds in sooner or later - we're just all working towards that goal.</p>

<p>Fury vs Wilder III previously received a bold bid to be staged in Australia on Christmas Day.</p>

<p>Speaking to Sky Sports, promoter Dean Lonergan said:Â 'I just made the point: "Bob, if Australia opens up, you could come down here. Here's a budget, here's what it could look like. We've worked together before it would be a great place to do it".'</p>

<p>Speaking on Wednesday, Fury told of his frustration but hopes an outcome can be sorted soon</p>
