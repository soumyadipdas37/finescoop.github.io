<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Newcastle suffered an embarrassing 5-1 defeat against local rivals Middlesbrough on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Magpies captain Jamaal Lascelles and home midfielder Lewis Wing were both sent off in the match following an off-the-ball altercation - sources described it as a 'grappling match' - but they will avoid a suspension in the regular season, instead missing Monday’s rematch between the teams on Tyneside.</p>

<p>Newcastle’s pre-season is turning into a nightmare for the head coach with serious injuries to goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and striker Dwight Gayle followed by Tuesday’s heavy loss at Championship side Boro.   </p>

<p>Allan Saint-Maximin was Newcastle's most dangerous player and scored in the 5-1 defeat</p>

<p>Jamal Lascelles (centre) was sent off in the friendly for an off-ball clash with Lewis Wing</p>

<p>Bruce has been desperate to add some more fresh faces to his squad before the season starts and will be even more convinced they need some new blood after this showing. </p>

<p>Within 34 minutes, Newcastle were already chasing a lost cause here.</p>

<p>A double from Britt Assombalonga and a Marcus Tavernier strike had put the hosts in the ascendancy.</p>

<p>Neil Warnock would have been impressed by what he saw from his Middlesbrough side</p>

<p>Key player Miguel Almiron featured but couldn't prevent Newcastle from losing heavily</p>

<p>Andy Carroll (right ) also played and is currently Newcastle's only fit senior striker</p>

<p>The impressive Allan Saint-Maximin - who was one of few bright sparks for Newcastle - gave them hope by reducing the deficit six minutes before the break.</p>

<p>But Boro reasserted their dominance after the interval with Grant Hall scoring five minutes into the second half to put the game to bed.</p>

<p>Stephen Walker completed the rout late on from the penalty spot.</p>

<p>Newcastle boss Bruce, who is hoping to sign Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson over the coming days, will want to see a much improved performance when Boro come to their Benton training centre for a second friendly on Monday. </p>
