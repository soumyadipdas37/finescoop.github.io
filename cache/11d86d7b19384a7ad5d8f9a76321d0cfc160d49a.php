<p>Dogs have a very acute sense of hearing, making some everyday events like fireworks and thunderstorms troublesome for canines, as they can be too loud for them. </p>

<p>However, Ford may have developed a solution with its noise-cancelling dog house. </p>

<p>While fireworks might be a sign of celebration for humans, they don't elicit quite the same reaction from dogs. Ford may have developed a solution with its noise-cancelling dog house</p>

<p>The carmaker created a futuristic-looking dog kennel that uses noise-cancellation panels and Ford's active noise control technology to create an insulated environment for pets. </p>

<p>It works similarly, in part, to noise-cancelling technology found in headphones in cars, according to Ford. </p>

<p>The company's active noise control technology works by fighting noise with noise.</p>

<p>'Once microphones inside the prototype kennel detect the sound of the fireworks, a built-in audio system emits opposing frequencies that in effect cancels out the noise completely – or at least reduces it significantly,' Ford explained. </p>

<p>'High-density cork, ideal for sound proofing was an integral part of the design.</p>

<p>'...When microphones pick up high levels of noise from the engine or transmission, this is counteracted using opposing sound waves from the car’s audio system,' the firm added. </p>

<p>In effect, it reduces the noise of fireworks to a level that doesn't disturb dogs' ultra-sensitive hearing, Ford said. </p>

<p>'The result? No more stress for your pet,' Ford explained.</p>

<p>'A concept for now, but with the potential to mean a much better start to the year, both for your dog – and for you.' </p>

<p>A recent study by the University of Bern in Switzerland found that some 50 percent of dogs show signs of fear with fireworks, such as panting and getting anxious or nervous</p>

<p>Active noise control is found in high-end noise cancelling headphones and promises to reduce the amount of ambient sound entering a wearer's ears. </p>

<p>Each headphone speaker is equipped with a microphone, which enables the system to detect the waveforms of sounds entering them.</p>

<p>It then generates an exact match for these sound waves, which is then inverted. </p>

<p>When these two opposite signals meet, it cancels out the offending outside sounds.</p>

<p>Some systems claim to be capable of reducing noise by up to 90 per cent, although this may be as low as 50 per cent in some models.</p>

<p>The technology has existed for several decades, but has relatively recently been used in commercial headphones.</p>

<p>Even more recently, it has begun to be applied in industrial and other public situations.</p>

<p>Full size speakers equipped with the technology is used to cancel out the disruptive noises of transformers, compressors and other low frequency machinery.</p>

<p>A number of institutions are also working on ways to incorporate it into residential and commercial buildings, like homes, shops and offices. </p>

<p>In a video, the company showed what the structure is made out of, including noise-cancellation panels and the active noise control, which looks similar to speakers.</p>

<p>There's also an automatic glass door, 'anti-vibration block risers' and sound-proof ventilation. </p>

<p>It turns out noise sensitivity is a big problem for many dogs. </p>

<p>'We wondered how the technologies we use in our cars could help people in other situations,' Lyn West, marketing communications at Ford of Europe, said in a statement. </p>

<p>'Making sure dogs and their owners could enjoy a stress-free New Year’s Eve seemed like the perfect application for our Active Noise Control system, and we have a few more ideas in progress as to how our everyday lives might benefit from a little Ford know-how.' </p>

<p>For now, Ford says the dog kennel is just a concept, meaning it's not for sale. </p>

<p>The project is one of several initiatives that fall under Ford's 'Interventions' series, which aim to take automotive tech and apply it to everyday problems. </p>
