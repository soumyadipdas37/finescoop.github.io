<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Young Australians are expected to bear the brunt of the coronavirus recession and will likely struggle to find their feet for years to come. </p>

<p>Australia's first recession in almost three decades was confirmed on Wednesday, with the economy shrinking seven per cent in the June quarter.  </p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was a devastating day for Australia.</p>

<p>'Our Australian economy has been savaged by the COVID-19 global pandemic and recession,' he told Parliament.</p>

<p>'It is delivering an awful and heartbreaking blow to Australians and their families all around the country.'</p>

<p>But the news is a particularly low-blow for Gen Z - those born after 1996 - who experts anticipate will be pushed out of their prospective careers by those already crowding jobs - their parents and Millennials. </p>

<p>Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who warned the road out of recession will be 'hard and bumpy', referred to 'scarring' in the labour market.</p>

<p>'What they [economists] refer to is people who lose their job, who find it very difficult to get back in,' he said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'We all know that if you don't have a job, it is not just the economic impact and your loss of potential income, but it is also the emotional impact that it has on your overall well-being.'</p>

<p>The nation is its first recession since the early 1990s as a result of the lockdowns to suppress the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>The June quarter result, the largest quarterly fall since the Australian Bureau of Statistics started plotting the nation's economic growth in 1959, was even worse than the six per cent decline economists had expected.</p>

<p>In the March quarter, the economy had contracted by 0.3 per cent.</p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said younger people and women have been more likely to lose their jobs during the pandemic because they have been working hospitality, tourism and retail. Pictured: A woman in a fask mask walks near the Tan in Melbourne on August 24</p>

<p>The seven per cent plunge in Australia's gross domestic product during the June quarter of 2020 was even more dramatic than the early stages of the 1930s Great Depression</p>

<p>A technical recession is defined by two consecutive quarters of negative growth.</p>

<p>Wednesday's release of the national accounts also saw annual gross domestic product shrink by 6.3 per cent, the biggest yearly decline since 1945.</p>

<p>Mr Frydenberg compared the current economic situation to the 80s and 90s, explaining a key difference was the 'cohorts of people who are most impacted'. </p>

<p>'In the 80s and the 90s, you saw some structural change in the Australian economy, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and you saw older people, mainly men, who are losing jobs,' he said. </p>

<p>'Right now we have seen more younger people and more women lose jobs because of the sectors that they have been working in predominantly, hospitality, tourism, retail.' </p>

<p>Hospitality, tourism and retail were some of the hardest hit industries during the pandemic as they were required to shut during coronavirus lockdown.  </p>

<p>Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg speaks to the media during a press conference at Parliament House on Wednesday </p>

<p>Gross domestic product plunged by a record seven per cent in the June quarter</p>

<p>First technical recession since mid-1991 - following 0.3 per cent downturn in the March quarter </p>

<p>Worst quarterly downturn in records going back to 1959</p>

<p>Slump more severe than early stages of 1930s Great Depression </p>

<p>Household consumption dived by a record 12.1 per cent</p>

<p>Mr Frydenberg said the government is focused on the 'challenge' of getting young people back to work.  </p>

<p>'That's where the skills and the training programs are absolutely critical,' he said. </p>

<p>Jeff Borland, an economist at the University of Melbourne, said young people are going to suffer through two waves during the pandemic.</p>

<p>The first wave was young people who were working in industries subject to coronavirus lockdown.   </p>

<p>'But the second wave of recession where our young people will be hurt most has not yet ­arrived,' he told The Australian.</p>

<p>'Young people, finishing school or university, will soon be competing for jobs in a depressed labour market, with a massive drop in demand for labour.</p>

<p>'This is what happened in the decade after the global financial crisis, and it was gradual; this time the process is on speed.'</p>

<p>Youth unemployment rose by about three per cent in Australia after the GFC, compared to five per cent across countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). </p>

<p>A Treasury paper about 'the career effects of labour market conditions at entry' released in June said those graduating during a recession are expected to face worse career prospects in the short term. Pictured: A woman wearing a face mask walks at Carlton Gardens in Melbourne</p>

<p>A Treasury paper about 'the career effects of labour market conditions at entry' released in June said those graduating during a recession are expected to face worse career prospects in the short term. </p>

<p>'It is less clear whether this initial setback has lasting consequences, though there are a range of reasons to think that it might,' the research paper said.  </p>

<p>'For example, the human capital of recent graduates may depreciate if their skills become redundant or are lost while they are not being put to use in a well-matched job.'</p>

<p>The early part of a career is 'critical' - 'with estimates that almost 80 per cent of lifetime wage increases occur within the first decade of an individual's career.' </p>

<p>'There may be 'psychological' scarring with graduates adjusting down their aspirations when faced by a shock during a particularly formative period,' the report said.   </p>

<p>Up until the 1991 recession, Australia had suffered an economic contraction several times a decade, on average. </p>

<p>A prolonged recession that began in September 1982 lasted a year, during a period of prolonged drought and the devastating Ash Wednesday bushfires in Victoria and South Australia. That followed another recession in 1981.</p>

<p>Another recession also occurred in 1977, during an era of widespread strikes.</p>

<p>The economy also took a beating in the final two quarters of 1975, when Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam as Labor Prime Minister.</p>

<p>A recession also occurred in late 1971 and early 1972, several months before Billy McMahon lost the election, ending 23 years of Coalition rule.</p>

<p>A credit squeeze also sparked another recession during the June and September quarters of 1961, ending only two months before then Prime Minister Robert Menzies held on to power by one seat.</p>
