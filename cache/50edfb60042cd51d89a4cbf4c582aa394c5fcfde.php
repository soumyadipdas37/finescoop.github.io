<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Of all the areas of Manchester United's team, few expected the midfield to be posing an early season conundrum for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>

<p>It's the one position United have actually managed to strengthen during a summer transfer window that has largely been a tale of frustration.</p>

<p>And it's certainly a department where Solskjaer isn't short of options, especially after the arrival of Donny van de Beek from Ajax.</p>

<p>Donny van de Beek is Manchester United's sole summer signing to date, arriving from Ajax in a £35million deal to bolster their midfield options</p>

<p>Van de Beek is capable of playing in the No 10 role like Bruno Fernandes (left) or the No 8 position like Paul Pogba (right) but isn't defensively minded</p>

<p>Solskjaer faces a challenge to maintain the balance of his United side with his midfield options</p>

<p>But that surplus of midfielders has led to questions about how Solskjaer best sets up his midfield and maintains the balance of his team.</p>

<p>Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher made the point on Monday Night Football that none of Van de Beek, Paul Pogba or Bruno Fernandes offer United any defensive cover.</p>

<p>There is a temptation for Solskjaer to play all three within his established 4-2-3-1 formation with Fernandes in the No 10 role ahead of Pogba and Van de Beek.</p>

<p>But although this sounds exciting on paper, Carragher rightly pointed out this set-up would be far too easy to counter-attack against.</p>

<p>Carragher was reflecting on United's 3-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace in their Premier League opener last weekend, a game that saw their defence repeatedly look vulnerable to pace and direct runs.</p>

<p>And that was with Pogba playing alongside the more defensively-minded Scott McTominay in central midfield, with Fernandes further forward as normal.</p>

<p>Pogba started in midfield alongside Scott McTominay (right) as United lost 3-1 to Palace</p>

<p>The Frenchman was taken off for Van de Beek in the second-half with United trailing 1-0</p>

<p>Replace McTominay with Van de Beek and there's every chance United's central defensive pairing of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof, as well as left-back Luke Shaw, will be exposed by any opponent that attacks quickly.</p>

<p>None of those defenders covered themselves in glory when faced with the threat of Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend.</p>

<p>And with all due respect to Palace, they represent modest opposition when compared to some of the opponents coming up for United, especially as they return to the Champions League.</p>

<p>Van de Beek isn't going to be your straight swap replacement for McTominay, Fred or Nemanja Matic.</p>

<p>Though his stats for recoveries and interceptions were decent enough in the Dutch league for Ajax, he isn't a defensive midfielder, playing instead as either a No 8 or a No 10.</p>

<p>His ability to play incisive passes between the lines, link the midfield and attack, and drift into wider areas to create overloads before crossing are the hallmarks of an effective No 10.</p>

<p>United will still rely on someone like Nemanja Matic (left) to anchor the midfield </p>

<p>Van de Beek can operate as a No 8 or a No 10 but he's not naturally a holding midfielder</p>

<p>Fixtures subject to change</p>

<p>Really, Van de Beek would play the Fernandes role but the Portuguese has been so transformative to United since arriving in January only injury would keep him out of Solskjaer's side.</p>

<p>So that leaves the Dutchman deeper in midfield and given the evident need for United to deploy a holding player like McTominay or Matic, it's going to be Van de Beek against Pogba for the spot.</p>

<p>If Solskjaer played Pogba and Van de Beek together, there's no question they could work in tandem creating pockets of space for the other to operate in.</p>

<p>But when United lost possession, any team able to transition quickly on the counter attack would hurt them.</p>

<p>The balance of the team would be too weighted towards the attack and United simply aren't reliable enough defensively to get away with it.</p>

<p>As Carragher said: 'I'm not convinced this team, who have now become more possession-based since Fernandes has come in, Pogba is in the centre of midfield, the more possession you have the more chance you can get counter-attacked. That midfield for me is not right.'</p>

<p>There are echoes here of the efforts of successive England managers to try and squeeze Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard - too generational talents but ultimately too similar - into the same midfield.</p>

<p>A succession of England managers were unable to accommodate Gerrard and Lampard</p>

<p>It would help if United has centre-backs at their disposal more comfortable in one-on-one situations.</p>

<p>Maguire and Lindelof never look entirely comfortable when players run at them. Aaron Wan-Bissaka at right-back, nicknamed 'The Spider', is probably their best defender at this and some have suggested he could be converted into a centre-back one day.</p>

<p>But until United get this, they'll need one of Matic, McTominay or Fred to provide the back line with cover.</p>

<p>United legend Bryan Robson suggested this week that Pogba should be the one left out by Solskjaer to make way for Van de Beek.</p>

<p>'I would probably go with Fernandes, Matic and Van de Beek [in central midfield] and just see where they go with it,' Robson said.</p>

<p>Pogba was absent through injury for most of last season but did look strong when he returned to the United side post-restart in June.</p>

<p>Fernandes and Pogba had started to form a good understanding towards the end of last season</p>

<p>United centre-backs Harry Maguire (left) and Victor Lindelof have looked susceptible </p>

<p>There were signs of an understanding with Fernandes and Solskjaer did decide to start the French World Cup winner against Palace last weekend.</p>

<p>Having said that, Pogba was replaced by Van de Beek midway through the second-half with United trailing 1-0 and the Dutchman did go on to claim a debut goal.</p>

<p>So Solskjaer needs to decide whether Pogba or Van de Beek starts and it certainly won't be the easiest of dilemmas.</p>

<p>Any tactical tweak to try and accommodate everyone is unlikely to solve the problem of United's vulnerability to the counter.</p>

<p>A 4-3-3 set-up with Fernandes alongside Pogba and Van de Beek in the midfield is a case of too many cooks and ultimately wouldn't be too dissimilar to the 4-2-3-1 and lacks the ballast of a holding player.</p>

<p>Any system using three at the back and wing-backs, as Solskjaer played against Manchester City at Old Trafford in March, really requires two holding midfielders.</p>

<p>Solskjaer looks on thoughtfully from the stands as United beat Luton in the Carabao Cup</p>

<p>Besides, it's clear that Solskjaer believes the 4-2-3-1 is the best option for United in terms of balance and to suit his forward options.</p>

<p>But circumstances could come to the rescue for the Norwegian. The intense schedule that lies in wait for United - and everyone else - this season means rotation will be essential.</p>

<p>That means Van de Beek, Pogba and Fernandes could be swapped around week-by-week without anyone getting too upset. And this is without factoring in the inevitable injuries and fatigue.</p>

<p>Van de Beek's ability to play as a No 8 or a No 10 gives a handy choice and means Fernandes won't have to shoulder the work load of last season.</p>

<p>There's also the perception that Van de Beek is a purchase for the long-term and far from an unnecessary midfield purchase when United actually needed a right-sided attacker and defenders.</p>

<p>Pogba could well leave next summer and Van de Beek, who at 23 should have his best years to come, will already have had a year's experience in English football under his belt.</p>

<p>More than anybody, Solskjaer subscribes to the Manchester United traditions of thrilling, attacking football.</p>

<p>But even he will recognise that any desire to play Pogba, Van de Beek and Fernandes together in his midfield will have to be resisted.</p>
