<p>The second episode of the Channel 4 series saw contestants tackle Biscuit Week, with the bakers asked to create florentines in the first challenge set by judges Paul Hollywood and Prue. </p>

<p>But viewers were left howling after the judge told baker Mark, from Liverpool, she had been 'worried about his very large nuts' in his Chunky Mango Lassi Florentines.</p>

<p>One commented: '"I remember worrying about your very large nuts". HOWLING.'</p>

<p>Great British Bake Off viewers were left in hysterics last night after Prue Leith made a very cheeky comment about one baker's 'very large nuts'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'I am enjoying the innuendo this week from Prue: large nuts and spurt...' </p>

<p>At the start of the show, Prue and Paul set the bakers off with the signature task- 36 chocolate Florentines with a perfect snap. </p>

<p>During the challenge, Mark explained he was keen to include larger nuts in his signature biscuits.</p>

<p>He told the camera: 'In my nuts I want some bigger bits because you want, obviously, a bite of nuts.'  </p>

<p>Many of those watching at home were left howling over the cheeky comment from Prue, with some saying the innuendo had them 'howling'</p>

<p>His florentines were crammed full of macadamia nuts and chunks of mango. </p>

<p>While trying out the bakes in the first challenge, Paul told Mark: 'It looks a little bit lumpy.' </p>

<p>And Prue couldn't help but comment on the 'size of his nuts', as she surveyed the biscuit, explaining:  'I remember worrying a bit about your very large nuts.'</p>

<p>The comment left the judges and host Noel Fielding in hysterics, while the rest of the cast and crew could also be heard giggling and covering their faces with surprise.  </p>

<p>Mark explained that he was keen for his florentines to be crammed with larger pieces because he wanted to give the judges 'a bite of nut'</p>

<p>During the signature challenge, the baker packed the biscuits full of macadamia nuts and chunks of mango </p>

<p>Viewers were also left howling at the playful innuendo, as one said: 'Steady on Pru! Worrying about Marks very large nuts. Ooh la la...' </p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Prue worrying about Mark's very large nuts, had me creased right up.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile another commented: 'Prue worrying about the lads very large nuts. It's why we watch.' </p>

<p>Elsewhere in the episode, contestants were asked to create macaroons and a 3D memorable meal show-stopper. </p>

<p>While the baker was praised for the snap on his fruit and nut biscuits, Paul told him they looked 'lumpy' </p>

<p>Meanwhile Mark was left red-faced after Paul and Prue's assessment of his biscuits had the tent cackling with laughter </p>

<p>Despite Rowan having a disastrous three rounds, with Prue once again mentioning the music teacher didn't take Paul Hollywood's advice to 'rein it in', Mak was eliminated.</p>

<p>Of his exit, Mak said: 'I just felt it in my bones it was me. I know I gave it everything. It was a privilege to be here.'</p>

<p>Fans of the show couldn't believe eccentric music teacher Rowan had escaped leaving the tent by the skin of his teeth. </p>

<p>The baker seemed the clear front runner to face the axe after being unable to finish off his waistcoat Florentines, leaving around half a dozen just covered in chocolate, as well as placing last in the technical with his 'peculiar piped' macarons. </p>

<p>The Great British Bake Off continues on Channel 4 next Tuesday at 8pm. </p>
