<p>Britney revealed in new court filings obtained by TMZ that she's done with live performances — at least for the time being.</p>

<p>She made the disclosure as her battle with her father Jamie Spears has intensified over her ongoing conservatorship.</p>

<p>Jamie has been at the helm of Britney's affairs for more than 10 years following her involuntary psychiatric hold in 2008.</p>

<p>In her documents, the singer objected to her father's attempts to bring back Andrew Wallet as a co-conservator, a job he held from 2008–2019.</p>

<p>But dad Jamie has hit back, claiming Britney's stated objections to Wallet's appointment are inaccurate and requesting a hearing to determine the facts in his own legal docs.</p>

<p>The pop star has recently been trying to unseal court documents so that the public could see them, and her lawyer expressed support for the #FreeBritney movement earlier this month. </p>
