<p>Sarah, 39, who was verging on tears during the segment, revealed she'd suffered a miscarriage eight weeks into her first pregnancy, and admitted just reliving it was causing her to get 'all shaky'.</p>

<p>'It was the day before the Logies... and I was trying on Spanx, as you do, and I was in the change room, and there was just blood everywhere,' she said. </p>

<p>'I called my mother-in-law and said, "I don't know what's happening," and she said, "You're probably having a miscarriage."'</p>

<p>Sarah said she called her GP, who confirmed she was indeed having a miscarriage, and advised her to go for a scan on the Monday.</p>

<p>Getting emotional: Verging on tears, Sarah, 39, revealed she'd suffered a miscarriage eight weeks into her first pregnancy, and admitted just reliving it was causing her to get 'all shaky'</p>

<p>'For 36 hours, I just bled and thought, "Oh, well. That's my first baby gone," and I kind of just dealt with it in my own way,' she revealed.</p>

<p>But after going for the scan, the sonographer discovered another heartbeat, and told Sarah she'd miscarried a twin, before she safely delivered her first son, Paul, in December 2015.</p>

<p>Sarah said the revelation that she was still pregnant led to what she described as a 'horror' few weeks, where she was too afraid to do anything in case she lost the other baby, too.</p>

<p>She admitted that it was still something she was coming to terms with, having never really dealt with it.</p>

<p>'I don't think I really took the time to grieve it, because I had that beautiful baby in the end,' she confessed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Angela, 53, became tearful, dabbing her eyes with a tissue as she revealed she was a week late going for her eight-week scan, and when she did finally see her obstetrician, she was told the baby had no heartbeat.</p>

<p>The mum-of-one said she was already terrified of going for pregnancy scans, because her 13-year-old daughter Amelia's heart condition had been diagnosed during the 20-week scan.</p>

<p>'I never really dealt with it, and I now know in retrospect that I went into a pretty bad period of depression,' she added. </p>

<p>Both women admitted they were shocked to hear about each other's experiences, and said the 'taboo' culture of discussing miscarriages was something that needed to change.   </p>
