<p>Britain will have to cope with reduced intelligence on Islamic terror suspects following our exit from the EU, the former head of MI6 warned yesterday.</p>

<p>Sir John Scarlett said there would be a 'degree of capability loss' when the Brexit transition period ends because the UK will no longer have access to European databases.</p>

<p>He added: 'It's almost impossible to avoid it. I'm not in a position to quantify that exactly and it's important not to exaggerate it. It's just a fact.' </p>

<p>And Sir John explained that limited data sharing will 'potentially weaken our ability to respond to the Islamic jihadi threat'.</p>

<p>Britain can access information on Islamic threats through EU-wide databases. </p>

<p>However, continued access to these sources has not yet been agreed as part of the Government's transition negotiations with Brussels.</p>

<p>Sir John, who was boss of the Secret Intelligence Service from 2004 to 2009, added: 'In terms of our overall security environment, the jihadi extremist threat is definitely still there. </p>

<p>'Last year in the EU I think there were 21 terrorist-related attacks. That of course includes the famous one on London Bridge. </p>

<p>'Now that threat has absolutely not gone away.'</p>

<p>Sir John said: 'Last year in the EU I think there were 21 terrorist-related attacks. That of course includes the famous one on London Bridge' (pictured, tributes to the victims) </p>

<p>Speaking at an online event organised by the think tank Royal United Services Institute, Sir John warned: 'You've only got to look at the situation in Iraq and Syria, for example, and also the spreading of capability into the Sahel and Central Africa.'</p>

<p>And Sir John and Sir Julian King, a former British EU commissioner, told the Times: 'We need to find the most effective ways to work together with our partners, allies and neighbours to counter shared threats and to protect our future.'</p>
