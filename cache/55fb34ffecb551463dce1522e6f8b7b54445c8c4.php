<p>A hunter has been viciously mauled after a miss-shot failed to kill a bear.</p>

<p>Alex Machavo, of Medford, Oregon, was attacked by the injured animal near Shady Cove on Thursday.</p>

<p>According to Andrea Carlson, a local sheriff's spokeswoman, the hunter and his wounded target rolled down a 50-ft embankment with the bear biting 22-year-old Machavo all the way down.</p>

<p>Black Bears number about 30,000 in Oregon and are North America's most common bear</p>

<p>A second hunter, 24-year-old Nathan Shinn of Phoenix, Oregon, was eventually able to shoot and kill the wounded animal.</p>

<p>Responding deputies found Machavo on a forest road and had him rushed to a Medford hospital.</p>

<p>Machavo's condition wasn't available but Carlson says his injuries did not appear to be life-threatening.</p>

<p>Shinn was unhurt. Carlson says the hunters had a tag that allowed them to shoot the bear legally.</p>
