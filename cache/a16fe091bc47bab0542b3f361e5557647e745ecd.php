<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New York City's restaurants resumed indoor dining on Wednesday after months of crippling closures but are only allowed to serve 25 percent of their normal capacity, which means none will come close to breaking even. </p>

<p>It is the latest in a string of blows for the industry which has been left 'in the dark' by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio since they were suddenly forced closed in March. Cuomo finally announced on September 9 that he would allow indoor dining to resume on September 30. </p>

<p>It came after months of pleas for information from restaurant owners about when they would be able to welcome patrons back inside. With the sudden announcement, they scrambled to organize their staffs and spaces. </p>

<p>Last week, Mayor de Blasio also announced that he would extend outdoor dining - which had been happening since June - indefinitely. He'd previously said that it would end in November. </p>

<p>On the surface, both announcements were good news for the industry. But the reality for operators now is a whole new set of challenges.</p>

<p>The 25 percent capacity limit drastically reduces the amount of money restaurants - many of which struggled to turn a profit when packed - can make. </p>

<p>Many are urging Cuomo to allow them to start at 50 percent on October 15 and 75 percent on November and 100 percent by Thanksgiving. </p>

<p>It would fall in line with what the rest of the state has been allowed to do since June. To continue offering outdoor dining through New York's frigid winters, outdoor heaters are essential. </p>

<p>But with little to no notice that they'd need them, restaurants are struggling to gain the appropriate heaters - which have to be approved by the FDNY - or the permits they need to use them, which could take months. On top of that, they need to source the gas they'd need to keep them functioning. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, some restaurants were able to open their doors for the first time since March 16. </p>

<p>Chef Daniel Boulud, of the famous Daniel restaurant on the Upper East Side, told DailyMail.com he was excited to finally welcome diners back for dinner but that it was not without its challenges. </p>

<p>'It's a mix of anxiety and excitement for sure, I am very excited for the staff to be back to work of course. </p>

<p>'I may see the 25 percent lasting longer than we thought though because of resurgence in different countries [of lockdowns],' he said. </p>

<p>Boulud said it was 'impossible' to run a business with such a limited capacity. </p>

<p>'All my life, I have spent it cooking in fine dining restaurants and in restaurants where, of course, we put a lot of effort, energy and creativity in to provide the best food and service. Our entire pyramid collapsed,' he said. </p>

<p>Daniel - where prices for soup start at $35 - is able to reopen because, as Boulud says, they were doing 'financially very well' before the pandemic. </p>

<p>'Thank god we were financially very well before COVID, so we have been able to reopen and bring back a lot of staff but it is very, very frightening to know so many little businesses had to close,' he said. </p>

<p>Reservations at Daniel started last Friday and filled up quickly, he said. Now, there is a wait list. </p>

<p>Fox Hospitality Group also took diners in three of its restaurants on Wednesday.   </p>

<p>Group owner Mark Fox told DailyMail.com: 'We've had a busy lunch, tables have been full guests are definitely delighted to sit inside again, it's definitely helpful. If we could increase capacity that would move things along.'  </p>

<p>Sant Ambroes in SoHo and the West Village also welcomed diners back indoors. A manager at the SoHo location, who preferred not to be named, said most diners were still choosing to sit outside but that it had been a 'great experience for everybody' finally bringing people back to dining rooms. </p>

<p>Rob Mahon, owner of Toro Loco, said he'd welcomed back diners inside. Mandatory temperature checks and QR code menus are in place.</p>

<p>'We will have to increase our team at busy times however I don’t see any change in terms of current revenue from now until Christmas,' he said. </p>

<p>The restaurant had put much of its indoor furniture outside to accommodate outdoor dining. Now, they have to rejig the layout again.</p>

<p>Mahon also said he was not optimistic about outdoor dining with heaters when temperatures in New York City plummet.  </p>

<p>'I don’t see people sitting outside when it’s NYC cold regardless of outdoor heating systems you install,' he said. </p>

<p>Restaurants in the city have been crying out for additional financial help for months. The PPP payments they were given initially, along with every other type of small business, have dried up.</p>

<p>Diners at Katz's Deli on the Lower East Side, a famous lunch restaurant known for its sandwiches </p>

<p>Diners are told to wear masks before they get to their tables and only take them off when they are eating and drinking</p>

<p>They also say their needs are more individual than others. </p>

<p>In New York City, many restaurants rely largely on tourism and office workers - who have all but vanished - for trade.  </p>

<p>Only 10 percent of the city's office workers have returned to work after being given the option to work from home. </p>

<p>Tourists are still a long way from returning to the city. </p>

<p>And after being forced to stay closed for seven months, restaurants in the city - particularly independently owned ones - are 'on their knees.' </p>

<p>'To think 25% helps at this late stage, four months after the rest of the state, when we pay more per squre foot than any other region, after all our PPP funds have been used, even with outdoor seats... we'll come nowhere close to preventing hundreds, if not thousands, of restaurants from closing. </p>

<p>'It could have been prevented. That's the tragedy,' Fox said. </p>

<p>Some restaurants reported that diners were more eager to sit outside than indoors. The weather remains warm in New York. Above, Serafina on the Lower East Side </p>
