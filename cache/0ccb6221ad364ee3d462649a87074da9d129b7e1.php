<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Lionel Messi-Barcelona saga took another farcical turn when Spanish media filmed Josep Bartomeu's car circling Jorge Messi's flat in the city.</p>

<p>Bartomeu was not in the car, leading to speculation on Twitter that he a) was in the boot b) had tried to fool media with a decoy c) had been left behind by mistake by an absent-minded chauffeur.</p>

<p>The duo were set for showdown talks on Wednesday afternoon to clarify the six-time Ballon d'Or winner's future.</p>

<p>Reporters filmed Bartomeu's car outside the Barcelona flat on Wednesday afternoon</p>

<p>The Argentine superstar sent shockwaves throughout football after informing Barcelona recently, via fax, that he wanted to leave the club on a free transfer.</p>

<p>However, the transfer saga took another twist after footage emerged of Bartomeu's car waiting outside Jorge's flat- but the Barcelona president was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Messi's father arrived in the Catalan city on Wednesday morning to negotiate his son's exit from the club with the first face-to-face talks with Bartomeu since the Argentine sent a burofax to the club, informing them he wants to move on - with Manchester City his expected landing spot.</p>

<p>Bartomeu was reportedly only planning to use the meeting as a way to convince Messi to remain at the club. </p>

<p>The beleaguered president has a better relationship with Jorge than he does with Messi and is hopeful that could work to the club's advantage.</p>

<p>But Messi's father - before talks were set to get underway - confessed it is 'difficult' to see his son staying in Barcelona this summer.</p>

<p>As he emerged out of a taxi, a reporter quizzed Jorge for any updates on the situation and while he remained tight-lipped, he did express that he feels it is tough for Messi to stay given the player and club are at war now over his contract.</p>

<p>He was also asked if there had been any contact with current frontrunners City, any negotiations with manager Pep Guardiola, but he remained dismissive. </p>

<p>Messi is said to be keen to move to City so as to reunite with Guardiola, who managed him so successfully at Barcelona.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' Jorge said. 'There's nothing yet'.</p>

<p>Messi - who has scored an astonishing 634 goals and created 285 assists in 731 appearances for Barcelona - is desperately searching for a new chapter after growing increasingly frustrated with the club's hierarchy.</p>
