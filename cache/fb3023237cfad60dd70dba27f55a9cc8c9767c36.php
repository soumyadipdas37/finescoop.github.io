<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A wealthy haulage boss is facing a long jail term after admitting drugs trafficking and money laundering, a court heard.</p>

<p>Irishman Thomas Maher, 39, was told by Judge Brian Cummings QC he will likely be given a 'substantial' prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to a string of offences at Liverpool Crown Court today.</p>

<p>Father-of-three Maher, appearing via video-link from HMP Liverpool, had been arrested in October last year after the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people found in a shipping container in Essex.</p>

<p>His home in Warrington, Cheshire, was raided by police but he was not charged with any offences in connection with the deaths.</p>

<p>Irishman Thomas Maher, 39, (pictured) is facing a long jail term after admitting drugs trafficking and money laundering</p>

<p>He was re-arrested by the National Crime Agency on June 30, and charged with the other offences including two counts of conspiracy to import class A drugs and two counts of conspiracy to launder money.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Maher pleaded guilty to four counts of conspiracy to commit a crime abroad, spanning March 28 and May 11 this year.</p>

<p>They included two charges of conspiracy to import class A drugs into Ireland and two of transferring criminal property into Ireland, 300,000 euro (£274,000) in April and 600,000 euro (£549,000) in May.</p>

<p>Catherine Rabaiotti, prosecuting, said the pleas entered were accepted by the prosecution and Maher will be sentenced on December 1.</p>

<p>Remanding Maher into custody until then, Judge Cummings told the defendant: 'Plainly on the face of it, you are facing a substantial custodial sentence, but the exact nature and extent of the sentence will be decided on the next occasion on December 1.'</p>

<p>Maher had been arrested in October last year after the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people found in a shipping container in Essex. Pictured: Police and forensic officers inspect the location where the 39 bodies were discovered</p>

<p>The facts of the case were not opened during the brief hearing.</p>

<p>Maher is believed to have been co-ordinating a transport network to facilitate drug importations into the UK via Ireland, and the transport of money from Ireland to Holland using encrypted EncroChat phones.</p>

<p>EncroChat phones were used by major criminals across Europe as they were regarded as uncrackable by police.</p>

<p>But the secret communication system was hacked by law enforcement in June, leading to hundreds of arrests across the country.</p>

<p>NCA deputy director Craig Naylor said: 'Maher was the logistics man for a number of crime groups, and played a key role in an important criminal infrastructure.</p>

<p>'He was able to use his contacts and his business to facilitate large amounts of class A drugs to enter the UK and Ireland, with little thought to the damage they inflict on people and communities.</p>

<p>'Going the other way, he was able to ship large amounts of cash after taking a cut himself - which no doubt was used to fund further criminal activity.</p>

<p>'Put simply, organised crime groups can't function without people like Maher.</p>

<p>'Operation Venetic has halted thousands of criminal conspiracies and led to the arrests of hundreds of suspects.</p>

<p>'Thomas Maher was undoubtedly one of the most significant.'</p>

<p>Maher was told by Judge Brian Cummings QC he will likely be given a 'substantial' prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to a string of offences at Liverpool Crown Court (pictured)</p>

<p>Maher pleaded not guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit a crime abroad, that of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm to Ronan Hughes in Ireland between April 21 and April 29 this year.</p>

<p>The final charge will not be prosecuted, the court heard.</p>

<p>He has been remanded in custody until his sentencing trial in December. </p>

<p>It is believed that his case will be one of the first in the UK related to EncroChat to be sentenced. </p>

<p>Haulier Ronan Hughes, 40, from Co Armagh in Northern Ireland, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey in August to 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>

<p>He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration between May 1 2018 and October 24 2019.</p>
