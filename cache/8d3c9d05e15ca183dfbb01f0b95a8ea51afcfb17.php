<p>Separate figures for total earnings before tax, costs and fees found Sheeran is the third wealthiest solo artist in the world after Taylor Swift and Kanye West, who made £143million ($185million) and £115million ($150 million) in 2019 respectively.     </p>

<p>The musician, who has sold more than 150million albums worldwide, paid himself a wage of £10million in 2019, documents published on Companies House revealed. </p>

<p>This is more than £7million less than in 2018, when he earned £17.1million.</p>

<p>It was reported last month that the musician, who has taken a two-year break from music amid the birth of his daughter Lyra Antartica, has grown a property portfolio worth £61million after purchasing new homes during lockdown.</p>

<p>The father has boosted his portfolio by £4.5million after making the cash purchases, according to The Sun.</p>

<p>Hot property: Ed splashed £10million on the London property market over the years, growing his empire to 27 flats, houses, and mansions, as well as his own 16-acre estate in Suffolk</p>

<p>Sheeran reportedly filed documents of the new purchases under his two firms, the Maverick Properties Limited and Maverick Commercial Properties Limited, with Companies House.  </p>

<p>In May, it was claimed the star had paid for his entire property portfolio with cash, leaving him completely mortgage-free. </p>

<p>A source said: 'He has a great portfolio of properties and he owns the lot free and clear. There was no need to borrow the cash from a lender because he already had it.</p>

<p>'Some people have the cash tied up so need to raise a mortgage but Ed has piles of the cash in the bank so there was no point in letting a bank earn money by lending him the money. He just bought them outright.'</p>

<p>He's also said to be making himself self-sufficient on his sprawling 16-acre Suffolk pile, by setting up a beehive on the edge of his estate, where he can make his own honey – in addition to growing vegetables, owning an orchard and raising livestock.</p>

<p>'Ed’s placed a wooden beehive at the edge of his estate,' another insider added. 'He’s already got other produce growing and some animals so he’s clearly enjoying the idea of that lifestyle.'   </p>

<p>In May, the singer-songwriter was officially named as the UK's richest musician under the age of 30.  </p>

<p>He owns 22 properties in London, including two homes on Floral Street in Covent Garden and a pair of flats by the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home down Palmer Road.  </p>

<p>These four homes alone are thought to be among his most expensive, with conservative estimates putting them at a total value of £9million.  </p>

<p>Sheeran also owns five apartments in Wiverton Tower in Whitechapel worth £3.9million and a mansion in Holland Park valued at nearly £20million. </p>
