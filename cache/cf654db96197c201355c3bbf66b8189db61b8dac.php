<p>Right now, the Shark DuoClean Corded Stick Vacuum with Flexology True Pet (HV390UKT) is on sale for just £159.99 - that's a saving of £110</p>

<p>The stylish rose gold vacuum from Shark features a unique two brush roll design. One vacuum head houses both a bristle and soft brush roll, which work together to remove everyday household dust and dirt from carpets and hard floors. </p>

<p>This means it can clean on hardwood floors, carpets and tiles with ease without stopping to switch heads.</p>

<p>In addition, other notable features include swivel steering for manoeuvrability, LED lights and an extra-long 10-metre cord. And thanks to its flexibility, with a click of a button, it folds so it can be stored anywhere in the home.</p>

<p>One satisfied Amazon shopper said it blew competitors such as Dyson out of the water: 'This has got to be the best vacuum I've ever come across if you're thinking between one of these and a Dyson then its shark all the way.</p>

<p>'I've had many Dysons and not lived up to expectations this is the first shark I've owned and will never buy another brand of vacuum!!!'.</p>

<p>Not only is it perfect for stair cleaning and under furniture, but it's also compact and lightweight and can be stored away easily afterwards</p>

<p>All Shark vacuums have an anti-allergen seal, allowing most of the dust particles you pick up to be captured dust while preventing them from releasing back into the air.</p>

<p>This TruePet model also includes the Shark Motorised Pet Tool, designed to remove even the most embedded hair from floors and furnishings.</p>

<p>If you have pets, this Shark model, which is now 26 per cent off, boasts anti-hair wrap technology which actively removes hair from the brush-roll, so you won't need to worry about any clogging or build-up of fur.</p>
