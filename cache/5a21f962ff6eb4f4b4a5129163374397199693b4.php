<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wout van Aert on the flatlands, Primoz Roglic in the mountains: Jumbo-Visma are dominating the 2020 Tour de France, grabbing their third win after just seven stages.</p>

<p>Belgian sensation Van Aert sprinted past Edvald Boasson-Hagen and Bryan Coquard to win comfortably after a nervous 168 kilometres into Lavaur on stage seven, with strong winds ripping the peloton to shreds.  </p>

<p>Adam Yates locked-in another day wearing the leaders' yellow jersey with a smart ride to ninth-place, while Tadej Pogacar, Mikel Landa, Richard Carapaz and Richie Porte were all caught-out, losing a costly 1 minute and 21 seconds. </p>

<p>Wout van Aert sprinted to victory on stage six of the 2020 Tour de France on Friday afternoon</p>

<p>The Belgian took his second stage win in three days, with Jumbo earning their third of the race</p>

<p>Mitchelton-Scott's Adam Yates maintained the race lead after a stressful day in the crosswinds</p>

<p>Jumbo are sitting pretty as the Tour moves into the Pyrenees on Saturday, with Roglic poised three seconds behind Yates in second-place overall, while Ineos Grenadiers' Egan Bernal lurks 13 seconds back in fourth. </p>

<p>The boredom of stage six was quickly forgotten as early breakaway attempts from Beniot Cosnefroy and Michael Schar were crushed by a storming Bora-Hansgrohe.  </p>

<p>With Peter Sagan still searching for his first win of 2020 the German setup put the hammer down - jettisoning pre-stage favourites Caleb Ewan and Sam Bennett and riding them out of contention after a doomed pursuit.   </p>

<p>Bora-Hansgrohe split the race early-on, distancing their leader Peter Sagan's sprint rivals </p>

<p>Benoit Cosnefroy tried an early move but was quickly swept up by the action behind him </p>

<p>The Tour de France's most famous fan, Didi 'El Diablo' Senft, was out on course on Friday </p>

<p>Reigniting the action with 40 kilometres to ride, it was Ineos who forced the next big selection - sweeping up a Thomas de Gendt solo mission and sending Pogacar and Co backwards with a powerful attack. </p>

<p>As Julian Alaphilippe and Bernal impressed by driving the pace, Ineos' plan backfired as Richard Carapaz suffered a mechanical issue.</p>

<p>The Venezuelan never saw the front again despite Ineos sending Jonathan Castroviejo back to help, curiously leaving only Michal Kwiatkowski to shepherd Bernal.  </p>

<p>Ineos Granadiers leader Egan Bernal impressed as he helped drive the pace in the wind </p>

<p>Van Aert's powerful sprint continued the Belgian's incredible form since the racing restarted</p>

<p>On a still day, 172-ride peloton would have been barrelling down the Lavaur finish straight at a frightening pace. But after the crosswind brutality, Groupama-FDJ had to drag the weary 40-strong peloton into the final kilometre. </p>

<p>Bora-Hansgrohe's work deserved reward and Sagan was favourite to deliver as he bumped and barged with Hugo Hofstetter for Van Aert's slipstream, but the Slovak couldn't find a way through as the Belgian stamped on the pedals and sunk back to a disappointing 13th. </p>

<p>Van Aert now has seven wins in 2020, with two in the last three days during only his second Tour de France. </p>

<p>The triple cyclocross world champion has stamped his mark on the sport this year, and is now among the favourites for stage 21 victory on the Champs-Elysees. </p>
