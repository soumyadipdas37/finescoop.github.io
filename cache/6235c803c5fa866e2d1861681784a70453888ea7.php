<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The wife of an Australian Defence Force soldier sobbed in court as he was found guilty of trying to trick a nurse into 'assisting' him provide a sperm sample.</p>

<p>Captain William Howieson was stationed at Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea in 2018 when he gave an unsigned doctor's note to a PNG army nurse saying she needed to help him produce five sperm samples.</p>

<p>While giving evidence at an ADF Court Martial in Canberra, the nurse said she refused the 29-year-old's proposition. </p>

<p>She handed Captain Howieson a specimen jar and took him to a cubicle before telling him: 'You need to go and masturbate yourself in there', the court heard. </p>

<p>Captain William Howieson was stationed at Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea in 2018 when he gave an unsigned doctor's note to a PNG army nurse saying she needed to help him produce five sperm samples</p>

<p>The nurse said he then told her 'but the paper says that you need to assist'. </p>

<p>The jury on Tuesday found beyond a reasonable doubt that Captain Howieson brought discredit on the ADF. </p>

<p>Captain Howieson's wife Bronte Millman - a vet from from Townsville - cried in court as the verdict was delivered, the Townsville Bulletin reported. </p>

<p>During the trial the nurse also alleged Captain Howieson told her he had a lump in his groin and asked her to examine it in private. </p>

<p>She told the court martial there was no lump, and said he pulled down his pants. </p>

<p>However, the court found Captain Howieson not guilty of those allegations, the ABC reported.</p>

<p>Defence Force Magistrate Brigadier Michael Cowen QC told the panel it might conclude Captain Howieson's offending had 'a rather brazen element to it'.</p>

<p>He said Captain Howieson, who previously had a perfect service record, was a 'mature man who doesn't have the folly of youth on his side'.</p>

<p>Prosecutors told the court it was clear the act had been premeditated.   </p>

<p>Chief Judge Advocate Brigadier Michael Cowan said Captain Howieson's role as a liaison officer and responsibility of controlling a large amount of money gave him confidence in his position.  </p>

<p>'You may think that that confidence emboldened him to commit the offence,' he said. </p>

<p>Captain Howieson faces a maximum sentence of three months behind bars, or a fine and demotion.   </p>

<p>He will be sentenced later this week.</p>
