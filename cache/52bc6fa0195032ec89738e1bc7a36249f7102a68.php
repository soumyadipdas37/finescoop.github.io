<p>The latest: Jack Osbourne, 34, opened up on how two of his three daughters caught COVID-19, while appearing on the Pretty Messed Up podcast on iHeart</p>

<p>While Jack didn't name his children who had caught it, his mother Sharon Osbourne previously said on The Talk that she was under quarantine after her granddaughter Minnie was diagnosed with the virus.</p>

<p>The U.K.-born television personality said that someone who works for him had caught the virus.</p>

<p>'They didn't tell me they were going out of town, they just appeared like, "Oh yeah we went out" and I was like, "Oh," and my daughter picked up a drink they sat down and took a sip and yeah,' Jack said.</p>

<p>He added that one of his daughters showed 'a little bit of a runny nose and a fever' in battling the disease.</p>

<p>Family man: Jack posed with his loved ones earlier this year in a group shot </p>

<p>Chilling out: The TV personality recently took to social media taking an ice bath</p>

<p>'She's got zero symptoms now' he said. 'She's still technically in the positive window because it hasn't been two weeks. It's just a lot of dodging and weaving - we spend a lot of time outdoors.'</p>

<p>Osbourne said that 'every two days' he gets a coronavirus test, and he wears N95 masks and is 'constantly washing up' as a health precaution.</p>

<p>Osbourne, who's past been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), said that while the virus doesn't directly impact his MS, it could have a massive impact on his health should he test positive for it.</p>

<p>'I was at my neurologist recently asking these questions and they [said] the kind of autoimmune disease I have isn't like someone with diabetes - it's a bit different,' he said. 'What they don't know is if you get COVID and it totally rocks you, they think it would make you more susceptible to an MS flareup.'</p>

<p>Playing it safe: Jack's mother Sharon Osbourne, 67, said she quarantined from her CBS panel show The Talk Monday after Minnie tested positive for COVID-19</p>

<p>Osbourne said her heart was with the show on it's 11th season debut, but she was acting out of caution amid the pandemic, and following safety protocols </p>
