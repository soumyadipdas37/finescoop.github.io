<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>About 240 million years ago a 15ft long dolphin-like sea lizard gorged on a 12ft reptile and its bones have have been found in the remains of the giant beast's stomach. </p>

<p>The exact cause of death is unknown, according to a team from the University of California, Davis, but analysis reveals the predator died shortly after its enormous meal. </p>

<p>This prehistoric ichthyosaur had jaws powerful enough to rip the smaller marine lizard to pieces before eating it and researchers say 'it started in the middle'.</p>

<p>This is the largest fossil ever found inside another creature, according to the team behind the discovery, who said it took several years before they accepted the find. </p>

<p>The species, Guizhouichthyosaurus, a type of marine lizard was unearthed at a quarry in southwestern China in 2010 with the smaller thalattosaur lizard in its stomach.</p>

<p>Ichthyosaurs were a group of marine reptiles that appeared in the oceans after the Permian mass extinction, about 250 million years ago. </p>

<p>They had fish-like bodies similar to modern tuna, but breathed air like dolphins and whales and like modern great white sharks - it's believed they were apex predators. </p>

<p>Co-author Professor Ryosuke Motani, said despite this theory there had been no direct evidence that the species actually was an apex predator - until they studied the remains.</p>

<p>'We always guessed from tooth shape and jaw design that these predators must have fed on large prey - but now we have direct evidence that they did,' Motani said.</p>

<p>The stomach of this 240-million year old fossil ichthyosaur contains the mid-section of another marine reptile that in life would have been only slight smaller</p>

<p>'Our ichthyosaur's stomach contents weren't etched by stomach acid, so it must have died quite soon after ingesting this food item.'</p>

<p>The researchers spent years visiting the dig site where the remains were found - looking at the same specimens - until they believed what they were seeing. </p>

<p>On examination, they identified the smaller bones as belonging to another marine reptile, Xinpusaurus xingyiensis, which belonged to a group called thalattosaurs. </p>

<p>Xinpusaurus was more lizard-like in appearance than an ichthyosaur, with four paddling limbs - found still attached to its body inside the larger beasts stomach. </p>

<p>This showed the predator's last meal was the thalattosaur's middle section - from its front to back legs. It had been snapped in three. Its head has not been found. </p>

<p>Their small, peg-like teeth had previously been thought to be adapted for grasping small, soft prey such as the squid-like animals abundant in the oceans at the time.</p>

<p>Carnivores that consume large animals are often assumed to have huge teeth adapted for slicing them up - but this discovery suggests that isn't always the case.</p>

<p>It's the first direct evidence of ancient megapredation - one large animal eating another</p>

<p>Prof Motani said Guizhouichthyosaurus used its inch-long teeth to grip its prey - perhaps breaking the spine with the force of its bite before ripping it apart. </p>

<p>Modern apex predators such as orca and crocodiles use a similar strategy.</p>

<p>Stomach contents are rarely found in marine fossils - leaving researchers to rely on tooth and jaw shapes to estimate what prehistoric species feasted on. </p>

<p>Prof Motani said: 'Now we can seriously consider they were eating big animals - even when they had grasping teeth - suggesting the cutting edge was not crucial. </p>

<p>'It's pretty clear that this animal could process this large food item using blunt teeth.'</p>

<p>The team no know the ichthyosaur killed rather than scavenge and could eat animals larger than a human - and almost as big as itself.</p>

<p>This image shows the ichthyosaur's teeth, with the broken white line indicating the approximate gum line of the upper jaw</p>

<p>This image shows the quarry dig site where ichthyosaur and thalattosaur were uncovered, now part of the Xingyi Geopark Museum in China</p>

<p>'We now have a really solid articulated fossil in the stomach of a marine reptile for the first time,' explained Professor Motani. </p>

<p>The team is still excavating the site where the pair of fossils were found - which has now been turned into a museum - they've been digging there for a decade.</p>

<p>'At this point, it's beyond our initial expectations, and we'll just have to see what we'll discover next.'</p>

<p>The findings have been published in the Cell journal iScience. </p>

<p>Ichthyosaurs were a highly successful group of sea-going reptiles that became extinct around 90 million years ago.</p>

<p>They appeared during the Triassic, reached their peak during the Jurassic, and disappeared during the Cretaceous period. </p>

<p>Often misidentified as swimming dinosaurs, these reptiles appeared before the first dinosaurs had emerged.</p>

<p>They evolved from an as-yet unidentified land reptile that moved back into the water.</p>

<p>The huge animals, which remained at the top of the food chain for millions of years, developed a streamlined, fish-like form built for speed.</p>

<p>Scientists calculate that one species had a cruising speed of 22 mph (36 kmh).</p>

<p>The largest species of ichthyosaur is thought to have grown to over 20 metres (65 ft) in length.</p>

<p>The largest complete ichthyosaurus fossil ever discovered, at 3.5 metres (11ft), was found to have a foetus still inside its womb.</p>

<p>Scientists said in August 2017 that the incomplete embryo was less than seven centimetres (2.7 inches) long and consisted of preserved vertebrae, a forefin, ribs and a few other bones. </p>

<p>There was evidence the foetus was still developing in the womb when it died. </p>

<p>The find added to evidence that ichthyosaurs gave birth to live young, unlike egg-laying dinosaurs.</p>
