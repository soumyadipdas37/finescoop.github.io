<p>This is the moment a drug dealer was arrested while sitting on the loo as police raided his home in Peru</p>

<p>The man, who is known by the alias ‘Old Toad’, 39, was discovered on the first floor of his home.</p>

<p>He claimed that he was suffering from diarrhoea and did not know there were drugs being prepared for sale in his property.</p>

<p>The man pleaded ignorance despite the fact that police had been recording him allegedly selling drugs.</p>

<p>Cops claim he was preparing bags of cocaine on the ground floor and only fled upstairs when he heard them breaking in.</p>

<p>Police had obtained a search warrant for the premises.</p>

<p>At first, the accused denied that the drugs belonged to him, then he admitted to only selling what is left over from his personal use.</p>

<p>He then finally admitted that he has been selling it for several months but claimed that for each bag he makes little more than 4.2 PEN (1 GBP).</p>

<p>It is not known what exact charges the man is facing.</p>
