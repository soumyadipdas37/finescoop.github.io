<p>He explained: 'We are delighted to [have this experience] at a time 'that is difficult for families that have been separated but in the next weeks will see each other again.</p>

<p>'A birth is a message of hope, it's a blessing. This is what we are so happy to share with Luxembourg and all the different countries.'</p>

<p>Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy in which the Grand Duke holds executive power and bills only become law with his signature.</p>

<p>Its monarchy is one of the youngest in Europe and began in 1815 following the Congress of Vienna at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.</p>

<p>Full independence under the Grand Dukes came just under 20 years later, when the Treaty of London enshrined Luxembourg's existence in international law and ended years of rule by the Burgundians, French, Prussians and the Dutch.</p>

<p>Although part of Luxembourg was later incorporated into what would, in 1839, become Belgium, the country remained intact through the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the First and Second World Wars. </p>

<p>In 1890 the grand duchy passed to Adolf, Duke of Nassau who ruled until 1905 - he was famed for his efforts to strengthen the territory's autonomy.</p>

<p>But, during the war, Luxembourg was occupied by German troops. The royal family fled and a government-in-exile was established in London.</p>

<p>In 1964 Grand Duchess Charlotte abdicated in favour of her son, who becomes Grand Duke Jean.</p>

<p>In 2000, Crown Prince Henri became Grand Duke of Luxembourg on the abdication of his father, Jean. Crown Prince Henri remains in his position today.</p>

<p>Much of the executive power lies with the prime minister - a grand duke appointee - and his cabinet. The duchy's figurehead remains a powerful and influential figure.</p>
