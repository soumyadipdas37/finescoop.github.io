<p>The chart-topper went on to explain that she's now come to the liberating realisation that mental health will always be part of her life, after previously thinking that she needed to change herself to alleviate it.</p>

<p>The star went on to say that she's learned that being confident in who she really is deep down is what's important and which helps keeps her in control of her anxiety. </p>

<p>She said: 'I had this misconception that confidence was becoming the person that I wanted to be and I know now that confidence is actually being 100 per cent OK with who you really are. Now, I can hear the little voice in my head and I’m just like, "OK, you’re there, but I’m not going to believe everything you say."'</p>

<p>Mabel has previously opened up to GQ, about her childhood anxiety and how writing songs helped her to deal with her issues.</p>

<p>She told the publication: 'I would have bad panic attacks. I just couldn’t come to terms with the fact that my parents didn’t know the answers to some things.</p>

<p>'They would tell me that a lot of creative people suffer from things like anxiety, that it was completely normal and that I should write stuff down.'</p>

<p>The singer has high ambitions for her musical career and told the publication she hopes to become an international star.</p>

<p>She said: I’ve always wanted to win Grammys, tour the world and have global success.'</p>

<p>Mabel began her career in 2015 with the release of her single Know Me Better and found mainstream success two years later with the song Finders Keepers featuring rapper Kojo Funds.</p>
