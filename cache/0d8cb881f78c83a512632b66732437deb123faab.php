<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When I look back on my two maternity leaves, it is with some regret that I made things so hard for myself. </p>

<p>Like many new mothers, I set myself a tight schedule that I then struggled to keep to — indeed, I struggled to get anywhere.</p>

<p>Babies are rarely light packers; nor, frankly, am I. By the time I would get all our clobber together, we were leaving the house about five minutes after we were due at baby rhyme/yoga/Mandarin.</p>

<p>Novels Her by Harriet Lane and Expectation by Anna Hope focus around new mothers who are struggling with loneliness</p>

<p>Further problems were created by my husband and I having eschewed our generation’s city buggies of choice — the bijou Bugaboo and budget Maclaren — for the perambulating equivalent of a Sherman tank.</p>

<p>It even came clad in military khaki; when I finally sallied forth, I felt like General Patton at the helm of the Third Army.</p>

<p>When my younger son started speaking, it became apparent he both adored cats and unfortunately thought they were called ‘***k’ — probably because most days we met our neighbour’s cat as we belatedly tumbled out of the house, with me swearing like a navvy. </p>

<p>A maternity leave during lockdown would have been a gift to me.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson’s fiancée Carrie Symonds must have had one of those, which explains why she and the PM thought it was a good idea to go on holiday to a gale-strafed cliff-edge, then erect a bell-tent on it.</p>

<p>In The New Girl, by Harriet Walker, fashion editor Margot recruits her maternity cover Maggie, then grows paranoid that the more carefree woman is trying to supplant her.</p>

<p>Her by Harriet Lane is also set during a maternity leave. Emma is struggling to ally the go-ahead career woman she used to be with the drudge she’s become. But is new friend Nina the saviour she seems?</p>

<p>Expectation by Anna Hope explores the interweaving lives and dreams of thirtysomething Cate, Hannah and Lissa. </p>

<p>Cate is struggling with motherhood in a new town until the right person asks her how she is.</p>

<p>If you are a new mother, look after yourself, and let others look after you, too. </p>
