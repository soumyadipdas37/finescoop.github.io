<p>Looking good! Rebel Wilson showed off her trim figure as she stepped out in West Hollywood after a workout</p>

<p>She was dressed in green sneakers, black leggings and a blue T-shirt.</p>

<p>The actress accessorised with a pair of sunglasses and wore a face mask for safety.</p>

<p>After months of rigorous exercise and dieting, Rebel finally revealed her magic weight loss number last week. </p>

<p>Trim: The 40-year-old looked fit and healthy in sporty activewear with a shopping bag in hand</p>

<p>The Bridesmaids star revealed she is currently 83kg (13 stone, or 183lbs).</p>

<p>The blonde uploaded photos of herself flaunting her slimmed-down figure in a blue wrap dress, explaining in the caption that she's not far off her goal weight of 75kg (11.8 stone, or 165lbs).</p>

<p>'Thanks for all the love so far on my "Year of Health" journey,' she wrote in the caption of her post.</p>

<p>Safety first! The actress accessorised with a pair of sunglasses and wore a face mask for safety</p>

<p>'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself "hmmmm...better not" and had a bottle of water instead.</p>

<p>She added: '8kg to go until I hit my goal - hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'</p>

<p>Rebel has lost an estimated 18kg since the start of the year, after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.</p>

<p>Time to pay! The Aussie comedian slipped some cash into the parking meter </p>

<p>'So for me 2020 is going to be called "The Year of Health",' she wrote on Instagram at the time.</p>

<p>'So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she declared.</p>

<p>'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'</p>
