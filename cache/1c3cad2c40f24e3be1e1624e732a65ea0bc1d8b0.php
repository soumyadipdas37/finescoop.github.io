<p>'Gloria is a living leader - a hero because she carved out her course in life against many odds and made it work for herself and for millions of women,' Taymor told the mag. </p>

<p>'Her humility, her ability to listen, her humor, her ease with she moves across cultural, racial and gender lines. She is the great communicator. I love her positive attitude to conflict. She is always looking to 'the upside of the downside' and one of her great expressions is, "The truth will set you free but first it will p*** you off."' </p>
