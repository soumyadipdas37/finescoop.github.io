<p>'Happy birthday <?php echo e('@'); ?>shaunwhite,' she went on, continuing the gag by telling the world record holder: 'Hang in there. one day you will accomplish something. #dontgiveup.'</p>

<p>The artsy photo, which looked like it was shot on film, showed the couple in a silly moment. Shaun hid one eye behind a water bottle while Nina stuck her tongue out.</p>

<p>Back to reality: Over the weekend Dobrev said 'Adios' to their fabulous time in Mexico, posting a cheeky selfie along with the caption: ''All good things must come to an end. time to go home...'</p>

<p>Insiders say that White is totally different from Dobrev's past boyfriends, who have included her Vampire Diaries co-star Ian Somerhalder, actors Austin Stowell, Glen Powell and most recently filmmaker Grant Mellon.</p>

<p>'Shaun is a departure from previous guys Nina has been with,' a source told E! News in March. 'Her friends are pleasantly surprised.'</p>

<p>'You either have chemistry or you don't, but a lot of what attracts me is a guy's mind and humor and talent,' she said.</p>
