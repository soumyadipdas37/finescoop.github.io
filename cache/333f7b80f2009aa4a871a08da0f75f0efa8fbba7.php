<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ian Wright has urged Arsenal to sign Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar, with the Gunners icon insisting it is 'imperative' that Mikel Arteta lands his man before the closure of the transfer window. </p>

<p>Arteta's side went into Monday's contest with Liverpool in good form but the Premier League champions demonstrated they are on a different level altogether, with Jurgen Klopp's side running out 3-1 winners at Anfield. </p>

<p>The new Arsenal boss is desperate for a midfielder to bolster his options this season, with Aouar and Atletico Madrid star Thomas Partey heavily linked with a move to north London.</p>

<p>Ian Wright says it is 'imperative' Arsenal sign Houssem Aouar following the Liverpool defeat</p>

<p>The Gunners icon said Monday's defeat 'felt like a training game' with the gap in quality clear</p>

<p>The Gunners have had budget issues this summer, with the need to generate funds preventing Arteta from landing his targets for the most part. </p>

<p>Arsenal have stepped up their pursuit of Aouar in the past week, though, with Lyon president Michel Aulas confirming that they had received a 'tame' offer for the star from the Gunners. The French side are looking for an offer of £45m for the midfielder.</p>

<p>And Arsenal legend Wright has urged his former club to secure the signing of Aouar before the window shuts, with the Frenchman's arrival seen as 'imperative' for Arteta's side. </p>

<p>'It felt like a training game for Liverpool in respect of Arsenal were saying you can try and get out but we will press you,' Wright told Premier League Productions via Goal of Arsenal's performance at Anfield.</p>

<p>22-year-old Aouar has been heavily linked with Arsenal, amid talk of a £45million move</p>

<p>Wright says Arsenal must sign the Lyon star if they want to close the gap on the champions</p>

<p>'You can see that in Liverpool's team everyone can move forward because Arsenal were starting so deep but what was evident to me was that we didn't have that person in midfield who was comfortable enough on the ball until Ceballos came on.</p>

<p>'[They need] someone who they can pass the ball to, who is comfortable to receive it with someone on his back, who can pop it off, who can turn it around the corner. From there Arsenal can play but we can't do that at the moment.</p>

<p>'That's why it's imperative we get Aouar from Lyon. He's someone that can get on the ball and get the forwards going. You saw the chances that Ceballos made when he came on, that's what Arsenal need.'</p>

<p>The 22-year-old could well be the missing piece to link Arsenal's midfield and attack, with his creativity likely to help unleash the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexander Lacazette.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta has been desperate for midfield reinforcements this summer transfer window</p>

<p>Aouar scored nine goals and provided 10 assists in 41 outings for Rudi Garcia's side last season, and was instrumental in them reaching the Champions League semi finals.  </p>

<p>'What we've seen is that Arsenal can keep it to 3-1 but in times before Arsenal have really collapsed under Unai Emery and in the latter stages under Arsene Wenger,' Wright added. 'They're so much more organised now but with the organisation, they need the right pieces in there.</p>

<p>'If they can't get that player this is what will happen. We can beat the likes of Fulham but when it's that type of calibre of team (Liverpool), you'll see Arsenal struggle.'</p>
