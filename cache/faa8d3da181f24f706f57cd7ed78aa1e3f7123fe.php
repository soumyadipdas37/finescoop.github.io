<p>Sadie looked stylish for the outing as she wore silver trousers and a dark grey top that she paired with a simple black blazer.  </p>

<p>Sadie and Jude used to lead the Primrose Hill Set, a name given to the all-star group of edgy residents of the leafy neighbourhood, who were known in their heyday for their wild ways with stories of their antics becoming the stuff of legend.</p>

<p>In the nineties they would spend their nights partying with the likes of Kate Moss, Davinia Taylor and Gavin Rossdale.</p>

<p>But things were not made to last, with Jude and Sadie getting a divorce in 2003, after six years of marriage.</p>

<p>In her autobiography Crazy Days, Sadie blamed depression that 'weaved a dance of destruction' through her adult life on the breakdown of their marriage.</p>

<p>Jude is now married to psychologist Phillipa, 32, who he was first spotted with at the Hay literary festival in 2015.</p>

<p>The couple got married at Old Marylebone Town Hall in London last year before partying in Mayfair – three months after the actor announced their engagement.</p>

<p>The actor also has an nine-year-old daughter Sophia with model Samantha Burke and Ada, four, with musician Catherine Harding.</p>
