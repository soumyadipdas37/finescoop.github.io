<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian Nutella lovers have been whipped into a frenzy by the news they can now buy hazelnut-flavoured biscuits made by the famous chocolate brand.</p>

<p>The confectionery giant launched the Nutella-flavoured biscuits last year and Australians have mostly had to look overseas so far to get their hands on the in-demand product.</p>

<p>But a popular Sydney convenience store has revealed it has now taken delivery of the biscuits - as well as another addition to the brand's product range in the Nutella B-ready chocolate bar.</p>

<p>The B-ready bar features a crunchy wafer shell with Nutella inside, while the biscuits are made from a shortbread outer layer encasing the hazelnut spread filling. </p>

<p>Redfern Convenience Store in Sydney's inner-city has announced it has taken delivery of Nutella's in-demand new range of biscuits - as well as the popular B-ready bar</p>

<p>Redfern Convenience Store in Sydney's inner-city shared a photo on Instagram showing a spread of the two Nutella products to its 24,000 followers last week.</p>

<p>'I'm sure I'll spend at least $100 going here - so many options,' one fan of the nutty snack wrote. </p>

<p>The new Nutella biscuit range has proven to be a hit success for parent company Ferrero since launching earlier this year.</p>

<p>Ferrero has expanded the product's distribution internationally following its initial launch in France, but it is not yet known if or when the company are bringing the biscuits to Australia.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ferrero Australia for further information. </p>

<p>The chocolate manufacturer said sales of the new product in France are three times higher than its next nearest rival in the market.</p>

<p>Nutella's iconic chocolate spread was invented 55 years ago and the brand's products are sold around the world in 160 different countries. </p>

<p>Last year, Nutella was rocked by explosive allegations the product relies on child labour.  </p>

<p>The hazelnuts which make Nutella, Ferrero Rocher, Kinder Surprise and Bueno chocolate are picked by immigrants and children in Turkey.</p>

<p>The sweet biscuits are made from a shortbread outer layer encasing a hazelnut spread filling</p>

<p>The European country is home to more than 400,000 family-owned hazelnut orchards where children as young as 10 work up to 10 hours a day for 95 lira (AUD$25) a day, according to a BBC News report.</p>

<p>In a statement obtained by Daily Mail Australia, the popular chocolate company said it was against child labour.</p>

<p>'Being a larger hazelnut user, Ferrero is committed to contributing to influencing and driving sustainable changes in the hazelnut production sector,' the statement read.</p>

<p>'This includes combating child labour with a multi-stakeholder approach that involves a combination of different measures, as in our Ferrero Farming Values Program (FFV).</p>

<p>'In fact, the complexity of the hazelnut supply chain means it cannot be transformed by one single actor, and cooperation is absolutely essential to tackling the issue of child labour.'</p>
