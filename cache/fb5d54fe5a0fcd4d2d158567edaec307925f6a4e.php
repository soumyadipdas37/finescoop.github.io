<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The boss of Britain's biggest casino complex has warned that a 10pm curfew would be 'disastrous' for night-time industries. </p>

<p>Simon Thomas, chief executive of the Hippodrome in London's West End, said casinos make half their revenue after 10pm, and a national curfew would force him to make 'substantial redundancies' among his 700 staff. </p>

<p>He already expects to make a 'significant loss' this year, after losing £1million a month during the five months the business was closed, and said the situation remains 'fragile'. </p>

<p>Losing streak: Visitor numbers are down 80 per cent at the Hippodrome</p>

<p>Visitor numbers are down by about 80 per cent since the Hippodrome reopened last month. </p>

<p>'The curfew poses an existential threat to theatres, hotels, bars and clubs,' said Thomas. </p>

<p>'It is an unnecessary over-reaction to Covid and it would be a disaster for London.' </p>

<p>Thomas owns about half of the Hippodrome, which has casinos, restaurants and bars on six floors of a 19th Century former music hall and circus. His 86-year-old father Jimmy owns 20 per cent. </p>

<p>He said he had worked hard to make the casinos safe, with gaming positions separated by flexi-glass walls, and the 80,000 sq ft premises prepared to receive just 400 people, down from 1,600. </p>

<p>He has raised £10million of Government loans and bank debt. A consultation on redundancies has started, but the number of job cuts has not been confirmed while 300 staff remain on furlough. </p>

<p>Thomas said: 'It's frustrating as the core business is excellent – the building is beautiful and a huge asset to London. We are very happy to pay tax, to provide jobs and entertain people – but we have to be allowed to do it.'</p>
