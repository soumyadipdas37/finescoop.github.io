<p>Oh dear: On Monday night's episode of Plate Of Origin, Team Greece - cousins Dezi, 42, and Penny, 33, (both pictured) - found themselves suffering a dramatic hiccup when the dough for their loukoumades exploded</p>

<p>'Penny! You better come over here. Don't freak out you gotta come over here!' she cried out. </p>

<p>When Penny arrived at the fridge, she gasped as she saw a bowl of dough that had expanded and burst all over the fridge.   </p>

<p>'Oh my god! It's exploded! It's exploded! My god it's exploded!' she cried out in panic. </p>

<p>Whoops: The pair were making a loukoumades, fig and ice cream dessert when Dezi urgently called Penny over to the fridge</p>

<p>There she blows: 'Oh my god it's everywhere, there is dough dripping off, like, literally strands dripping off the shelf,' Dezi said</p>

<p>Rush job: The only choice for the pair of cooks was to start over and Penny quickly got to work on a new batter</p>

<p>'It's like a volcano has erupted in the fridge,' she added.  </p>

<p>'I've seen you make a cake - a whole cake - for a birthday party in under 45 minutes, you can do this!' Dezi encouraged her. </p>

<p>Winners: The pair not only managed to complete and plate their dessert, they left Team France, entrepreneurs Austine, 28, and Leo, 32, (pictured) quaking in their wake</p>

<p>Looking good: The Greek team crushed them with 49 out of 60 with their main of octopus with garlic mash and loukoumades dessert</p>

<p>She added with a laugh: 'We wouldn't be Greek without the drama'. </p>
