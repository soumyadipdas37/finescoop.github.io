<p>'He has often admitted he enjoys being in front of the camera and was looking forward to more TV opportunities centred around the things he likes, like travelling and adventure', an insider told the publication on Monday.  </p>

<p>The publication claimed several of the girls competing on The Bachelor were  unhappy after learning about Locky's quest for fame. </p>

<p>'It caused a lot of issues with the girls - they were divided, some felt it was fine and others didn't want to become collateral damage for someone who just wanted to add to his acting reel,' the source alleged.  </p>

<p>Locky and Jordan dated for three years between 2017 and 2019. </p>

<p>Speaking to New Idea in August, Jordan said she is sceptical about Locky finding love on the show.  </p>

<p>'I don't believe it. Obviously you have genuine feelings and you're in a bubble on the show, but no, I don't think he will end up married with kids with this person on The Bachelor,'' she said.</p>

<p>Ouch! It comes after Locky found himself in hot water with his ex-girlfriend, Love Island Australia star Jordan Cayless (pictured), claimed he only signed up to the dating show for publicity</p>

<p>'I saw the ad where he says, 'I'm the type of guy to get down on one knee' and I thought, 'Yeah, you will – for the publicity and the ratings!''  </p>

<p>Jordan even claimed that Locky had previously mentioned that he wanted to become The Bachelor, and suggested he would use the attention and following to 'lift up' his business in Bali.     </p>
