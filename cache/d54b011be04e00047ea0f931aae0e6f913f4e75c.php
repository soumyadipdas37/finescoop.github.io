<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Swapping supermarkets can save you the price of a family holiday in less than a year without cutting back on a single product, a financial adviser has revealed.</p>

<p>Victoria Devine recently started shopping at an Aldi store close to Melbourne CBD and quickly noticed savings of almost $70 a week.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old host of financial advice podcast 'She's on the Money' used to spend an average of $170 on groceries at a leading competitor but now pays just $101 for the same items at the German-owned chain.</p>

<p>If she deposited the difference into a savings account for the next year, she would have $3,640 by October 2021 - enough to cover the cost of Christmas or a two-week trip overseas.</p>

<p>Ms Devine told Daily Mail Australia she wants consumers to question why they are so 'brand loyal' to retailers that don't offer them the best deal, noting: 'It's often only because it's what was on the kitchen benchtop when we were growing up.'</p>

<p>Compare male and female equivalents </p>

<p>A recent comparison of the cost of male and female razors at a leading supermarket infuriated Ms Devine after she discovered a huge discrepancy in favour of men.</p>

<p>An eight-pack of men's disposables was $3.50, while a five-pack of women's was $5.60 - despite the only difference being the colour of the handle.</p>

<p>'They had the same amount of blades, probably the same product manufactured in the same factory, just different colours and fancy branding,' she said.</p>

<p>Her solution to price discrimination is simple: always pick the cheaper option.</p>

<p>'I feel very powerful when I'm like, 'no, I'm not going to buy the pink one',' she said. </p>

<p>While Aldi is a German-owned company with global headquarters in Essen, in the country's west, the vast majority of brands stocked in Australian stores are sourced from Australian farmers, producers and manufacturers.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Of the 1,200 suppliers that Aldi Australia currently works with, more than 1,000 are Australian-owned.</p></li>
<li><p>100 percent of meat and eggs stocked in Aldi come from Australian farms.</p></li>
<li><p>97 percent of fruit and vegetables stocked in Aldi are grown in Australia.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>* Products from national brands are an average of 20 percent cheaper at Aldi than at Coles and Woolworth, a 2017 CHOICE consumer study revealed.</p>

<p>Identify big ticket items</p>

<p>Meat, plant-based substitutes and pre-packaged products like chopped vegetables and ready-meals will always be more expensive than food in its natural form.</p>

<p>That's why Ms Devine says it's crucial to resist the attractive packaging and clever marketing slogans typically used on processed snacks, which are likely to be the priciest items in your trolley.</p>

<p>But even fresh produce can send grocery bills sky high, especially if you're buying fruit and vegetables out of season.</p>

<p>Ms Devine recommends buying frozen greens instead, which is often more nutritious and considerably cheaper than what you pick from the shelf. </p>

<p>Frozen vegetables have higher nutritional values because they are 'snap' frozen soon after they are harvested, locking in more vitamins and minerals than their fresh counterparts which lose nutrients in transit.</p>

<p>Switch substitutes for wholefoods</p>

<p>Roughly 2.5million Australians are now following a vegetarian or almost vegetarian diet - that's 12.1 percent of the population in the market for plant-based alternatives and meat replacements.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that these products are usually wildly expensive, with tubs of vegan mince costing up to $18 while beef mince is as little as $7 a tray.</p>

<p>But Ms Devine argues extortionate grocery costs can be avoided by going straight for wholefoods and skipping fancy branded substitutes altogether.</p>

<p>'It's actually very cheap if you don't get caught up in the faddy products and the shiny parts of being plant-based,' she said.</p>

<p>'You could just eat lentils, beans or root vegetables in your pastas and curries instead of processed alternatives, that way it won't be insanely expensive.'</p>

<p>Meal plan, not meal prep</p>

<p>An easy way to avoid wasting food and money is planning five meals a week around special offers in supermarket catalogues, Ms Devine suggests.</p>

<p>If there are deals on meat, consider how you might build multiple dinner around the discounted cut.</p>

<p>'Can you do curried sausages and then a barbecue later in the week to use up the leftovers? This way you're going to get more value for money,' she said. </p>

<p>'It's about meal planning not meal prepping because let's face it, most of us don't have entire Sundays to spend making dinners in bulk.' </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Compare the prices of male and female equivalent products - then buy whichever is cheaper</p></li>
<li><p>Shun meat replacements and prepackaged snacks for wholefoods</p></li>
<li><p>Buy frozen rather than fresh fruit and vegetables</p></li>
<li><p>Never go to the supermarket without a shopping list</p></li>
<li><p>Don't allow yourself to be blindly 'brand loyal' - shop around</p></li>
<li><p>Plan five dinners a week based on special offers in supermarket catalogues </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Always write a list</p>

<p>It's well worn advice but Ms Devine insists that going shopping without a list is akin to a kamikaze mission for your finances.</p>

<p>'It's about making sure you go in with a plan. If not, you are absolutely going to buy stuff you don't need,' she said.</p>

<p>'It's too easy to go in and say, 'oh I feel like TimTams' when they don't fit you budget.'</p>
