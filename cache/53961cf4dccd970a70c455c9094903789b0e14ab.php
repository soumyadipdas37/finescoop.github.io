<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool will have to pay back more than any other Premier League club as the top flight foots the coronavirus bill from broadcasters. </p>

<p>All 20 Premier League clubs have to repay the £330m they were told they needed to pay the league's broadcast partners as a result of the three-month suspension of football.  </p>

<p>And last season's champions Liverpool face a £17.3m cut in television revenue, pocketing £143.8m instead of a forecast £161.6m, the Premier League's 2020-21 handbook states. </p>

<p>Liverpool will have to pay the biggest chunk of a £330million rebate payment to broadcasters</p>

<p>The Premier League's broadcast partners are owed the amount after the suspension of football</p>

<p>Manchester City, who finished runners-up to Jurgen Klopp's side, are set to repay the next biggest bill of £16.8m, taking their earnings from £156.7m to £139.9m. </p>

<p>On average, most clubs will have to repay around 10 per cent of their total broadcast earnings, with the proportion paid back decreasing for the teams that finished lower in the league.</p>

<p>It means that Norwich City, who finished 20th last season, will see their earnings drop from £95.2m to £88.1m, representing a 7.5 per cent loss. </p>

<p>Manchester City will pay the second-largest amount, set to be around £16.8million</p>

<p>Arsenal will have to repay more than Wolves and Spurs despite finishing below them</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the trio of promoted clubs this season will not have to pay anything back until next season, when their broadcast earnings are accounted for and they'll have to pay £8.4m each. The same applies for the three clubs that are promoted from the Championship next season.</p>

<p>The Big Six are most seriously affected by the coronavirus bill, with Arsenal expected to pay £15m - which is more than Wolves - despite the fact Nuno Espirito Santo's side finished above them last season.</p>

<p>The Gunners £15m bill is also slightly dearer than north London rivals Spurs, who will have to pay back £14.8m. </p>

<p>The same applies for Chelsea who, despite finishing below Manchester United will lose £16.3m while United will lose £16.2m.  </p>
