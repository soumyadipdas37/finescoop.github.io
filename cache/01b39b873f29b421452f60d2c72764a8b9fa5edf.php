<p>Footage of the former France international surfaced on social media and Evra showed that he has lost none of his skill.</p>

<p>Evra, in the No 11 shirt, took a throw-in down the left flank and after receiving the ball back from his team-mate played a back-heel pass.</p>

<p>'Thanks for letting me playing with you guys .. such a good day, don't worry Giggsy I honoured your number the best I could,' Evra wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>Evra, who wore the No 11 shirt on Saturday, posted on Twitter following the 3-2 defeat</p>

<p>It appears that Evra was keen to get some minutes under his belt ahead of Soccer Aid match</p>

<p>The ex-United full back will return to Old Trafford next month as he's in the World XI to face England in the charity football match Soccer Aid.</p>

<p>It appears that Evra was keen to get some minutes under his belt ahead of the clash on September 6.</p>

<p>The Twitter account of Brentham wrote: 'It was a real privilege to have <?php echo e('@'); ?>Evra train and play for us. He needed some minutes ahead of the <?php echo e('@'); ?>socceraid Socceraidcharity match for <?php echo e('@'); ?>UNICEF taking place at <?php echo e('@'); ?>ManUtd Old Trafford next month.'</p>

<p>Evra, who became a football television pundit after hanging up his boots, is widely regarded as one of the best left backs to ever grace the Premier League after a successful eight-year spell at United.Â </p>

<p>Evra won the Premier League five times at United as he enjoyed a trophy-laden career</p>
