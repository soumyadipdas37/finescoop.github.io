<p>Jennifer, 51, appeared first back at her home as she spoke with host Jimmy Kimmel, who had earlier joked that she needed to leave the Staples Center in LA otherwise it would mean 'she wouldn't win' in her category. </p>

<p>She was then joined by Courteney, 56, and Lisa, 57, who joked that they all lived together, alongside 'Ross' who was actually the actor Jason Batemen. </p>

<p>Friends reunited... again! Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, and Lisa Kudrow made a surprise reunion at the Emmy Awards on Sunday night</p>

<p>Last month, Jennifer sounded unfazed about news that the highly anticipated Friends reunion would be delayed again until May 2021. </p>

<p>The actress said the 'glass is half-full' when it came to the postponement while speaking with Deadline. </p>

<p>'It’s going to be super. You know what? This has also given us more time to make it even more exciting and more fun than it would have been,' she said. </p>

<p>'I choose to see it as the glass is half-full that it got postponed,' she continued. 'Look, we’re not going anywhere. You’re never going to get rid of Friends, sorry. You’re stuck with us for life, guys.' </p>

<p>The highly anticipated reunion has been plagued with delays and HBO Max has now pushed the special back again due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which is now surging in California. </p>

<p>Filming won't take place until next 'May at the earliest', according to sources who spoke with Variety about the project recently. </p>

<p>'Unfortunately it’s very sad that we had to move it again,' Jennifer said. </p>

<p>The Emmy winner is still excited about getting back to work as soon as it's safe for everyone involved. 'It was, "How do we do this with live audiences?" This is not a safe time. Period. That’s the bottom line. It’s not a safe time to do it.' </p>
