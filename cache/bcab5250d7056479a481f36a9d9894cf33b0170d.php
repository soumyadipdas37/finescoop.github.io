<p>The 167.5km stage from Chatelaillon-Plage came down to the expected sprint finish with Ewan taking his second stage of the Tour while Peter Sagan claimed second ahead of Sam Bennett in a photo finish.</p>

<p>Ewan was a close second to Bennett 24 hours earlier on the Ile de Re but this time had the speed to come past the Irishman just before the line.</p>

<p>Australian Caleb Ewan claimed victory in the 11th stage of the Tour de France in Poitiers</p>

<p>The Lotto-Soudal claimed victory just 24 hours after being narrowly edged out by Sam Bennett</p>

<p>Deceuninck-QuickStep's Bennett had been hoping to repeat the victory of fellow Irishman Sean Kelly the last time a Tour stage finished in Poitiers back in 1978 but had to settle for retaining the green jersey, with his advantage over Sagan cut to 15 points.</p>

<p>There was no change at the top of the general classification, with Slovenian Primoz Roglic of Jumbo-Visma continuing to lead from defending champion Egan Bernal of the Ineos Grenadiers.</p>

<p>Victory for Australian Ewan followed his success on stage three to Sisteron.</p>

<p>Ewan (RC) edged out Peter Sagan and Bennett (LC) in a sprint finish in the the 167.5km stage</p>

<p>'It was very, very hectic,' the Lotto-Soudal rider said.</p>

<p>'I knew from the first stage that I won just to stay calm and wait for the right gap to open. I just had a real desire to win today after yesterday and I'm happy to repay my team-mates with the win.'</p>

<p>A messy finale saw Jumbo-Visma's Wout Van Aert open it up early in pursuit of a third stage victory, but Sagan forced his way through on the inside, and beat Bennett with a bike throw on the line.</p>
