<p>The Coronation Street icon, 63, is said to have been telling friends she is still keen to take part and will not let the agonising pain from her recent hip operation get in the way.</p>

<p>Such is her level of commitment to recover in time, that some friends are now predicting she is set to win.</p>

<p>Committed: Corrie's Beverley Callard, who is rumoured to be starring in I'm A Celebrity, has reportedly vowed to appear on the show - despite being in terrible pain from botched surgery</p>

<p>A source close to the actress told the The Mirror: 'There is still a long way to go before the show starts and Bev is determined to use this time to keep getting better. She is nothing if not a fighter.</p>

<p>'I'm a Celebrity may have switched from New South Wales to cold north Wales but she still hopes to be there. </p>

<p>'It's been a great target for her as she continues with physio, working hard to get fit for the show in a couple of months is really helping to spur her on. She's so focused, some of her friends are convinced that she will go all the way and win.'</p>

<p>Presenters: 'I'm a Celebrity may have switched from New South Wales to cold north Wales but she still hopes to be there', a source said (pictured hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly)</p>

<p>If Beverley were to form part of the line-up or even go on to win, it would represent an incredible achievement after a very difficult year.     </p>

<p>Beverley's nightmare began when she visited her GP in March to seek advice on a 'niggle in my hip, in my groin on the right side'.</p>

<p>Her doctor said it could easily be fixed with a small operation, however, the star faced a series of complications following the surgery.</p>

<p>Beverley explained following what she thought was a 'minor operation' at the hospital, which she is not naming for legal reasons, she was told the surgery didn't go as planned.</p>

<p>She explained to the publication that her hip had 'crumbled' during surgery and she needed 'further operations'. </p>

<p>Appearing on Loose Women earlier in September, Beverley said: 'It's been a pretty difficult time. I'm trying to walk now. I'm on crutches as opposed to being hoisted around and pushed around, but I'm getting there slowly but surely.' </p>

<p>'It's been one of the worst times I've gone through. But I'm battling, I'm fighting. I've got physio every day, hydrotherapy twice a week – I'm trying my best.'</p>

<p>Beverley is mum to Rebecca, 45, and Joshua, 31, while her husband of 10 years Jon McEwan has Ben, 34, Jon, 31, and Danielle, 29. </p>

<p>Corrie fans were initially left baffled as Liz suddenly left Weatherfield off-screen, with it revealed that she had moved to Spain. But Beverley revealed on the same Loose Women appearance that she will be heading back for a full exit scene. </p>

<p>She said: 'I will go back maybe the beginning of next year. So they will see a bit more of Liz and it's going to be very dramatic I believe!</p>

<p>'I wasn't going to talk about the operation at all, but I know there was a bit of an uproar, because after 35 years they're just sending her off to Spain and we're not going to see her.</p>

<p>'So it wasn't Coronation Street's fault, it was no one's fault, it was just one of those things. What I'm hoping for the exit is Liz and Jim get back together and just go off into the sunset, but I have a feeling that might not happen.'    </p>
