<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump on Monday cast doubt on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dying wish to have the next president replace her on the Supreme Court, alleging it was actually written by a Democrat. </p>

<p>He accused Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, Speaker Nancy Pelosi or House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff as being behind the justice's last request - an allegation that has no proof nor did Trump offer any.</p>

<p>'I don't know that she said that, or was that written out by Adam Schiff, Schumer and Pelosi,' Trump said during an interview on 'Fox &amp; Friends.'</p>

<p>'I would be more inclined to the second, it sounds so beautiful. But that sounds like a Schumer deal or maybe a Pelosi or shifty Schiff. So that that came out of the wind. Let's see. I mean, maybe she did and maybe she didn't,' he added.</p>

<p>Donald Trump cast doubt on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dying wish to have the next president replace her on the Supreme Court, alleging it was actually written by a Democrat.</p>

<p>'My most fervent wish is that I I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,' said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a statement dictated days before her death</p>

<p>Ginsburg dedicated a message to her granddaughter Clara Spera in her dying days.</p>

<p>'My most fervent wish is that I I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,' she said. </p>

<p>Democrats have used Ginsburg's words and Republican Senator Mitch McConnell's actions in 2016 - when he held back President Barack Obama's nominee until the election was decided - as an argument to let the winner of November's contest nominate Ginsburg's replacement.</p>

<p>The president said since Republicans won the last presidential election, he got to nominate Ginsburg's replacement. </p>

<p>And, he said, he needed to nominate a new judge because there could be legal proceedings following the election.</p>

<p>With many states and voters using mail-in ballots, both parties are preparing to file legal cases on any voting irregularities. </p>

<p>'Look, the bottom line is we won the election. We have an obligation to do what's right and act as quickly as possible. We should act quickly because we're going to have probably election things involved here, you know,' he said.</p>

<p>Trump argued it was important to have a full court of nine justices in case of legal issues so a 4-4 tie would be avoided. However, if the Supreme Court had only eight justices, a tie decision on the high court would mean the lower court decision would stand. </p>

<p>'Well, we don't want of to have a tie, no, we don't, and we want to have nine justices,' he said.</p>

<p>'We won the election, and elections have consequences,' he said. </p>
