<p>Teasing: Susanna Reid playfully called Piers Morgan 'chubster', after he revealed he had put on half a stone on in lockdown</p>

<p>Piers said: 'Like a lot of people in lockdown, especially when you bust your ankle up, I have put on weight.</p>

<p>'I am carrying too much weight. I reckon I put on at least half a stone, three quarters of a stone. I need to be fat-shamed to get it off.'</p>

<p>Taking the bait, Susanna told him: 'Yes, you fat person, lose the weight. It's about time, chubster.'</p>

<p>Playful: Piers, 55, encouraged his co-host, 49, to fat-shame him live on Good Morning Britain on Monday, so he could use the insults as motivation to shed the pounds</p>

<p>Susanna, who admitted she had put on a stone over the past couple of months, called the columnist: 'You fat person'</p>

<p>While Piers said the insults would help him lose the weight, Susanna said: 'That brings me out in hives just saying that.'</p>

<p>To which the Britain's Got Talent judge told her: 'No, that will genuinely have the right affect on me.  </p>

<p>'I will go back today and probably eat a little less cheese and put the second bottle away and try to get back on the Peloton for the first time in a few months.</p>

<p> Chubster! Susanna told him: 'Yes, you fat person, lose the weight. It's about time, chubster'</p>

<p>Awkward: While Piers said the insults would help him lose the weight, Susanna said: 'That brings me out in hives just saying that'</p>

<p>'I think we all need to be slightly shamed about weight.'</p>

<p>But Susanna disagreed and told him: 'No, I don't think shaming works. Sensible advice works. Throwing insults does not help people lose weight.'</p>

<p>Piers shouted: 'No, saying "stop chunking up fatso and eating so many cakes", that works. That's what you need to be told.'</p>
