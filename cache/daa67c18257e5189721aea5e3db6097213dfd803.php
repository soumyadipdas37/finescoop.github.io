<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A jet pilot had one of the most terrifying flights of his life when he momentarily passed out mid-flight due to high G-force. </p>

<p>Alex Kowtun, from West Palm Beach in Florida, had a heart-stopping experience after he lost consciousness while flying an Aero L-39 Albatros fighter-jet trainer.</p>

<p>Mr Kowtun had been invited for an aerobatic piloting session by Scott Farnsworth, airline captain and owner of Farnsworth Aerosports, where he performed high-speed manoeuvres.</p>

<p>But while flying with Mr Farnsworth, the hobbyist airplane pilot momentarily blacks out due to high g-force, terrifying footage shows.</p>

<p>In the video, Mr Kowtun loses consciousness and his head drops forwards for a few seconds while the aircraft continues to fly at high-speed.</p>

<p>Alex Kowtun, from West Palm Beach in Florida, lost consciousness for a few seconds during a high-speed manoeuvre in an Aero L-39 Albatros fighter-jet trainer</p>

<p>A terrifying video shows the hobbyist airplane pilot momentarily black out due to high g-force before regaining consciousness and shouting 'oh s**t'</p>

<p>The pilot looks shocked and shouts 'oh s**t' following the terrifying moment, while Mr Farnsworth is also heard asking him 'are you back?'. </p>

<p>Mr Farnsworth, who has flown with Mr Kowtun numerous times, laughs and says 'you said you wanted it' after the pilot regains consciousness, the footage shows.</p>

<p>Mr Kowtun, who is also an entrepreneur, said: 'I had trained many times with Farnsworth, but for that flight I wanted to push the jet to its limits and experience how that felt full force.</p>

<p>'Farnsworth agreed to put me through the test of his entire airshow routine.</p>

<p>'The one in the video was the last manoeuvre of the routine, a very hard pull with a midfield break over the runway.</p>

<p>'It was the hardest-g pull of the day and I have zero memory of it, I completely passed out halfway through the turn, game over.'</p>

<p>Mr Kowtun described the experience as 'humbling' and said it was a 'lifelong lesson' as he 'thanked god' that the other pilot was 'better prepared'.</p>

<p>He added: 'This experience was the most memorable flight of my life, it reminded me that we are not invincible, it was an amazing ego check.</p>

<p>'If I had been flying the jet alone and passed out in a similar fashion, it would have been all over for me.' </p>

<p>Mr Kowtun was flying with Scott Farnsworth, airline captain and owner of Farnsworth Aerosports, when the heart-stopping incident occurred</p>

<p>Pilots undergo high-G training to prevent a g-induced loss of consciousness, which is caused by high levels of acceleration which move blood away from the brain</p>

<p>The footage of the heart-stopping moment has been seen by more than three million shocked viewers since it was shared on TikTok on August 30. </p>

<p>Farnsworth Aerosports travels with two jets and a tour bus to deliver heart-pounding performances in the sky.</p>

<p>Aviators and astronauts undergo high-G training to prevent a g-induced loss of consciousness caused by high levels of acceleration during flight.</p>

<p>G-forces can move blood away from the brain in high-speed manoeuvres, which can lead to pilots blacking out and can have fatal consequences.</p>

<p>The heart rate also increases to try and provide the brain with necessary blood flow while the acceleration rises.</p>

<p>Mr Kowtun's terrifying flying experience took place in December 2019.</p>
