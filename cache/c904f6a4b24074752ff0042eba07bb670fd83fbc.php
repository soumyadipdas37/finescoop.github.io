<p>Finance expert Canna Campbell used just five 'holy grail' beauty products for her natural look</p>

<p>She used just five items in her 'minimalist' makeup routine to perfect her radiant look in just four-and-a-half minutes - but will last all day</p>

<p>Giorgio Armani Neo Nude Natural Glow Foundation (shade: 5.5): $68</p>

<p>Fenty Beauty Cream - Butta Biscuit: $50</p>

<p>Westman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick (shade: Petal): $80</p>

<p>Maybelline Great Lash Mascara: $12.95</p>

<p>Lanolips 101 Ointment lip balm: $18.99 </p>

<p>After applying her serum, SPF50 sunscreen and moisturiser, she used a $68 Giorgio Armani 'Neo Nude Glow' foundation as the base.</p>

<p>'It's really important to have a really good base to then build upon to keep it nice and fresh and natural,' she explained.</p>

<p>'Giorgio Armani Neo Nude is incredible. I'm wearing the shade 5.5. It's supposed to be like a tinted moisturiser but I would actually say it's a little bit heavier than a tinted moisturiser but only marginally.</p>

<p>'You only need the teeniest tiniest amount and it goes a long way. It stays on all day, it is so light and dewy and of course if you want a heavier look, you can very easily just layer it up.</p>

<p>'This is unbelievable to the point where I could actually wear this and not need any other foundation. For me it just ticks so many boxes and it's not as heavy as a foundation. It's so light but it gives me that little bit more coverage than a tinted moisturiser would.'</p>

<p>Canna said her second favourite product is the $50 Fenty Beauty cream bronzer in the 'Butta Biscuit' shade. </p>

<p>'I use it as a contour so I just dab it... I use the natural light to help me work out the contours... Dabble and blend around the hairline so it gives me a slightly bronze look without looking artificially tanned because I am quite fair skinned,' she said. </p>

<p>After applying her serum, SPF50 sunscreen and moisturiser, she used a $68 Giorgio Armani 'Neo Nude Glow' foundation as the base</p>

<p>Canna said she uses the $50 Fenty Beauty cream bronzer in the 'Butta Biscuit' shade (left) as a contour before applying $80 Westman Atelier 'baby cheeks' blush stick (right) on her cheeks</p>

<p>Canna said her go-to item is the classic $12.95 Maybelline Great Lash Mascara (left) and she finished off her look with the $18.99 Lanolips lip balm (right)</p>

<p>Next, she used the $80 Westman Atelier 'baby cheeks' blush stick.</p>

<p>'This is beautiful,' Canna said. </p>

<p>'If you're a minimalist and you don't want too much makeup, this is a great investment. You can use it on your lips, you can blush and eye shadow. Really natural.'</p>

<p>Canna pointed out the three-month rule that applies to mascara so she never wants to be a fortune on the product. </p>

<p>Beauty experts have said old products should be discarded after three months as there could be germs in the tube, putting you at risk of an eye infection.</p>

<p>She said her go-to products Giorgio Armani foundation, blush stick and Maybelline mascara</p>

<p>Canna said her go-to item is the classic $12.95 Maybelline Great Lash Mascara.</p>

<p>'Mascara lasts three months so I have an issue with paying too much for a really expensive mascara. But this is great because it's cheap, it's really good, it's a cult product... this goes back to the 80s,' she said.</p>

<p>To finish off her look, Canna applies the $18.99 Lanolips lip balm. </p>

<p>'There's nothing that annoys me more than the sensation of having dry lips. I hate it,' she said. </p>

<p>Canna added: 'So this is my fresh, clean, minimal makeup look. Something I would gravitate towards most days and it's so quick and easy to apply.</p>

<p>'I've used five products all of which neatly and tidily fit into a very organised, efficient makeup pouch of mine. Five products - a fresh, everyday, minimal makeup look.'</p>
