<p>Read all about it: Before loading up the car, Kate ran to her nearest Sainsbury's to pick up a copy of her pregnancy interview with Hello! Magazine</p>

<p>Speaking with Hello! magazine, Kate explained they started trying for a baby after their wedding was cancelled and she's 'never felt more ready' to be a mum.   </p>

<p>Kate added the pregnancy was 'completely planned' after her nuptials were rearranged twice due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>She explained: 'The wedding got cancelled and I wasn't thinking about a baby at all. </p>

<p>'But when we rebooked it for the following year, a few of our friends and family said we could have a baby between now and then.</p>

<p>Exciting: Kate has talked about how Martin has wanted children for a long time and so the couple are over the moon with their baby news</p>

<p>'I laughed, but then I turned 40 in May and suddenly I felt grown up and like I was ready for something and I didn't know what it was.' </p>

<p>The reality star also said she had felt 'pressurised' in the past but is happy that she waited to have a child until it felt right.</p>

<p>Kate, who won Big Brother in 2002, said: 'I think I am going to be a much happier person knowing that I did this when I wanted to.'   </p>

<p>Ultrasound: Kate showed ultrasound scans on Tuesday and joked her bundle of joy was 'entertaining' </p>

<p>Adorable: Another scan made it look like Kate's little one was waving and holding a thumbs up</p>

<p>Sweet: She gushed, 'A head, a thumbs up, a wave, a teeny foot and the universal symbol for #SmashYerFaceIn. Baby Boj gave us quite an entertaining performance at the 16 week scan'</p>

<p>During the candid interview, Kate also told the magazine doctors said she had a low egg count and this helped contribute to her being ready to become a mother.</p>

<p>The star explained how she knew the 'decision would be taken out of her hands eventually' and she was 'sad' at thinking she wouldn't be able to conceive.    </p>

<p>Sharing the news on social media, she wrote: 'Still can’t believe we’re adding another set of paws to our pack and this time it’s not another dog.'  </p>

<p>Kate previously discussed the possibility of having children last September during another Hello! interview, saying her partner of eight years Martin really wanted to start a family.</p>

<p>The issue became the subject of several 'heated arguments' between the pair and features as the central theme to a podcast hosted by them, called Maybe Baby. </p>

<p>Out now: read the full interview in this week's HELLO! magazine, out now </p>

<p>Asked what would happen if Kate didn't change her mind, she revealed fears of Martin divorcing her after they tie the knot. </p>

<p>'He always said we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. And I know what that means - that we'd get divorced,' she said.  </p>

<p>But the radio DJ, who presents Virgin drive time, added that Martin recently offered her reassurance with a sweet comment. </p>

<p>She told the magazine: 'But a couple of weeks ago, he said: "If you decide you really don't want kids, I'm okay with that. I would rather have you and not have children than not have you. " It was the first time he'd ever said that.'  </p>
