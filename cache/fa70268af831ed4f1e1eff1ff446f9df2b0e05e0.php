<p>However the interiors of cars can heat up well beyond what is considered safe for children - usually within minutes.</p>

<p>In tests conducted by RACQ, the interior temperature of a car peaked at 75.1C when it was just 32.5C outside - more than double the outdoor temperature.</p>

<p>Even when parked in shaded areas, RACQ said interior temperatures can soar beyond 40C in Queensland.</p>

<p>Temperatures beyond 40C can lead to death or serious injury for children trapped in a car.  </p>

<p>Dr Neil Archer, the Cairns Hospital Paediatrics Clinical Director said more care needed to be taken to prevent tragedies from occurring.</p>

<p>Police have not confirmed the relationship between the man and the two young children. </p>

<p>The man was charged with leaving a child under 12 unattended and will front court on December 8.   </p>
