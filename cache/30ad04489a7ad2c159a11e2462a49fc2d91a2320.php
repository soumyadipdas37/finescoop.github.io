<p>The Portuguese midfielder netted in the 100th minute of the match for his 13th goal for the club after Neal Maupay's handball following Harry Maguire's header handed United a last-gasp spot kick.</p>

<p>The penalty was awarded only after referee Chris Kavanagh - who had blown the final whistle before the appeal was looked at by VAR - had consulted the pitchside monitor, leaving Fernandes with a long wait before the pressure moment.</p>

<p>Rio Ferdinand and Joe Cole lauded Bruno Fernandes' composure after his winning penalty</p>

<p>Man United were awarded a penalty after Neal Maupay's handball from Harry Maguire's header</p>

<p>But former England internationals Cole and Ferdinand praised the 26-year-old January signing for the way he handled the situation.</p>

<p>'This man is ice cold in these situations,' Ferdinand told BT Sport.</p>

<p>'He changed his runup a little bit there from his usual hop, skip and jump thing. The pressure was on but he calmed himself down and went back to basics.'</p>

<p>Cole was also in awe of Fernandes' ability to remain calm but was interested to see how decisions and the pressure changes in those situations when fans return to stadiums. </p>

<p>But Fernandes was forced to wait as Chris Kavanagh checked the handball on the monitor</p>

<p>However Fernandes converted, leaving Ferdinand and Cole to praise his calmness late on</p>

<p>'We could see that while all the melee was going on, Bruno was the coolest man in this building. It was a great penalty,' Cole said.</p>

<p>'It will be interesting to see how much it will change when fans are back with these decisions. </p>

<p>'Full credit to Brighton as we were waxing lyrical about their system. They deserved at least a point.' </p>

<p>The penalty was Fernandes' 13th goal for the club since his arrival at Old Trafford in January</p>

<p>The penalty handed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men their first win of the Premier League season.</p>

<p>Fernandes had conceded a penalty which Maupay put away but United bounced back through a Lewis Dunk own goal and a stunning Marcus Rashford solo effort.</p>

<p>Solly March thought he had rescued a point in the final minute of stoppage time with a header at the back post, only for Graham Potter's men to be left heartbroken by Fernandes' late penalty. </p>
