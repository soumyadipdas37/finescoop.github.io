<p>While it's unclear if they're an item, the pair are definitely close according to an E! News source from April.</p>

<p>Quarantine left the pair plenty of free time to spend together, according to the insider who added: 'Now, they are both single and quarantined in New York.'</p>

<p>'Vito is a big flirt and Irina is his type,' they went on. 'She likes the attention. They are neighbors and are spending a lot of time together. When Irina's daughter is with Bradley [Cooper], she has downtime and she likes the company. It's easy for right now to see Vito and go over to his place. They've been spending all day together and the evenings as well. She likes connecting with someone she is comfortable with.'</p>

<p>'He’s been making an effort to take projects that aren’t too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he’s very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he’d carry her everywhere.' </p>

<p>'He’s totally devoted to Lea, it’s really sweet to see how much he loves being a dad,' the insider went on.</p>
