<p>The post comes after Molly-Mae was moved to tears on Saturday as she tearfully recalled her skin cancer scare.  </p>

<p>She revealed she'd visited a doctor three times after noticing a mole on her calf, before reassuring followers that the mark turned out to be non-cancerous.</p>

<p>Molly-Mae added that it was her mum Debbie who first noticed the mole while she was in the Love Island villa, before pleading with her fans to get any unusual marks checked out. </p>

<p>In a series of videos she posted to Instagram Stories, Molly-Mae admitted she'd been moved to tears after watching a Stand Up To Cancer segment about Emily Hayward.</p>

<p>Scare: She revealed she'd visited a doctor three times after noticing a mole on her calf, before reassuring followers that the mark turned out to be non-cancerous</p>

<p>Emily died in June 2018 after being diagnosed with skin cancer seven years earlier when she was just 17, and documented her battle with the disease on a YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Molly-Mae then told her followers she'd found a similar mole on her calf when she was in the Love Island villa last year.</p>

<p>She explained: 'And I actually found a mole on the back of my calf about a year or so ago and had it checked, obviously I'm so blessed that mine wasn't cancerous, but it just made me so upset that like ''what does she do to deserve that? Who deserves that?''</p>

<p>'It is just the worst thing in the world. It's just to comprehend for families that have to go through it, how much of a struggle it must be for people who actually deal with cancer. It just broke my heart watching that.'</p>

<p>Molly-Mae went onto urge her followers to get any unusual moles checked out, and shared a snap of the one she'd noticed on her calf.</p>

<p>She said: 'Get your moles checked out people!!! It is so unbelievably important. I've had this checked three times now by different consultants just to be sure.</p>

<p>'This just appeared out of nowhere for me and my mum actually noticed it when I was on Love Island through watching me on TV...'  </p>
