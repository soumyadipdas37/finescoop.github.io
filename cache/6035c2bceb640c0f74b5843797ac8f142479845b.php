<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eddie Hearn remains hopeful Canelo Alvarez could still face British world champions Callum Smith or Billy Joe Saunders this November despite the pound-for-pound star's messy legal situation with his promoters and broadcasters.</p>

<p>Canelo is currently at war with Golden Boy and DAZN after they failed to agree terms for his next fight and has subsequently filed a lawsuit alleging a breach of contract, seeking damages of at least $280million (£216m).</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands that DAZN had grew tired of Golden Boy's failure to deliver the trilogy fight with middleweight kingpin Gennady Golovkin and rejected a number of possible opponents put to them by the promotional company. </p>

<p>Canelo Alvarez's next fight is shrouded in doubt amid legal dispute with Golden Boy and DAZN </p>

<p>Eddie Hearn is hopeful Callum Smith (L) and Billy Joe Saunders (R) could still fight him this year</p>

<p>Smith and Saunders - who was due to fight Canelo before the coronavirus pandemic, and then ruled out a revised September date - were both mentioned to DAZN but negotiations never materialised.</p>

<p>Matchroom boss Hearn is confident that Canelo will return to the ring this year and believes a fight against either Smith or Saunders is still possible.</p>

<p>'We want to see him back in the ring particularly because the two fights there for him are Callum Smith and Billy Joe Saunders, two of our guys. I want them to have the opportunity to fight Canelo,' he told Sky Sports. </p>

<p>'Hopefully it (legal dispute) gets resolved and we see Canelo back in the ring - he's one of the biggest stars in world boxing and is a terrific fighter.</p>

<p>Hearn expects pound-for-pound star Canelo to return to the ring at the end of this year</p>

<p>The Matchroom boss admitted a fight between Smith and Saunders can't happen without fans</p>

<p>'I think the plan is still for Canelo to box in November, or at least this year.</p>

<p>'If he does, I've got my fingers crossed they pick Callum or Billy.'</p>

<p>A Battle of Britain between Smith and Saunders has also been considered, but Hearn admits a fight of that magnitude cannot be staged behind closed doors.</p>

<p>He added: 'If Canelo doesn't pick them, they should fight each other. But if there's no fans, how do you do Smith vs Saunders?</p>

<p>'Right now it's about keeping the fighters active but also recognising some fighters are better for 2021.'</p>
