<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Natalina Angok was a sweet soul with a heart of gold, whose life was ended by a man she chose to love.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old, described as the light of her family, was strangled to death in a Melbourne laneway by her boyfriend in April last year.</p>

<p>Christopher Allen Bell, 33, had a history of family violence against Ms Angok throughout their nine-month relationship.</p>

<p>Christopher Allen Bell, 33, had a history of family violence against Ms Angok throughout their nine-month relationship</p>

<p>A police officer is seen on Little Bourke St where Ms Angok's dead body was found on April 24, 2019</p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to killing her in the early hours of April 24 last year after an ice and alcohol 'bender' in the city.</p>

<p>When police confronted Bell about the discovery of Ms Angok's body in a Chinatown laneway he initially claimed 'I don't have a girlfriend', but told them he sometimes had blackout episodes.</p>

<p>He later admitted he 'choked the life out of her until she breathed no longer'.</p>

<p>CCTV captured their final evening together. Prosecutor Jeremy McWilliam told a pre-sentence hearing in Victoria's Supreme Court that Bell had tried to steal a bottle of wine from a liquor store and aggressively challenged a security guard to a fight after he was caught.</p>

<p>Ms Angok apologised to staff for his behaviour, and a taxi driver who picked them up said she had been angry and upset with him afterwards.</p>

<p>They went to a hotel and later walked through Chinatown, where they were shown having 'animated' discussions.</p>

<p>Ms Angok's body was found in Little Bourke St (pictured) in Melbourne on April 24 last year</p>

<p>Ms Angok was strangled to death by Bell. She fought back during the fatal attack and Bell's DNA, from a scratch on his neck, was found under her fingernails</p>

<p>Just after 5am Ms Angok walked into Celestial Avenue, followed by Bell. Her body was found there by a member of the public at around 6.30am.</p>

<p>Bell described his memory of the incident as 'hazy like it was real but not real'.</p>

<p>His lawyer Rohan Lawrence said Bell was remorseful.</p>

<p>'He reports he immediately regretted what he had done and was weeping while berating himself,' he said.</p>

<p>But he then spent an hour gambling at Crown Casino and bought food, cigarettes, wine and an Anzac badge.</p>

<p>He had been released from prison shortly before meeting Ms Angok and was released from inpatient mental health care a week before the murder.</p>

<p>'You were supposed to love and protect her ... even if my life depended on it, I will never forgive you,' Ms Angok's sister said</p>

<p>Doctors believe Ms Angok had become part of his complex delusions and that he had suffered untreated schizophrenic illness for four to five years beforehand.</p>

<p>She had been encouraged to leave Bell by her sister in the days before her death, because of Ms Angok's concerns he would kill her.</p>

<p>'You were supposed to love and protect her ... even if my life depended on it, I will never forgive you,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Angok fought back during the fatal attack. Bell's DNA, from a scratch on his neck, was found under her fingernails.</p>

<p>Bell has four children from two previous relationships, but no longer has contact with them.</p>

<p>Justice Lex Lasry said there appeared to be a 'well entrenched pattern' of violence by Mr Bell against partners, including before the onset of his schizophrenic symptoms in 2014.</p>

<p>The hearing is continuing.</p>
