<p>The young man posted a TikTok video showing an old photo of his parents standing alongside Mr Andrews and a married couple on their wedding day. </p>

<p>A Melbourne man has jokingly asked to be adopted after realising his parents had been friends with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews</p>

<p>The video quickly received lots of attention, with 346,000 views and 44,000 likes.</p>

<p>'Dad said he (Mr Andrews) was alright to get on the beers with,' the man added. </p>

<p>'But mum said he was boring.'  </p>

<p>While many Victorians agreed with the sentiment of the video, many of the 1,146 comments were in defence of the premier. </p>

<p>'Don't see how it's Dan Andrews' fault you Victorians couldn't stay in your house yikes,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'Andrews has not stopped since this began, he is literally trying to keep up safe,' another said.</p>

<p>'If he does or doesn't do his job people are going to complain.'</p>

<p>'You should be blessed that your parents have known such greatness,' another commented. </p>

<p>The young man posted a Tik Tok showing a group photo at a wedding where Mr Andrews was standing alongside his parents</p>

<p>Meanwhile many comments slammed the premier for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>'The look you give when you're about to ruin six million Victorian's lives,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'I would not be advertising that you know Dan Andrews,' another said.</p>

<p>The Victorian premier has been accused of 'decimating' Victoria due to the state undergoing a strict stage four lockdown.</p>

<p>The Melbourne man then turns the camera to show his face with a thumbs down</p>

<p>When one user commented saying 'Dan looks like a good bloke', the original poster responded: 'Dad said he was alright to get on the beers with'</p>

<p>Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Monday described the premier's handling of the crisis as 'the biggest public policy failure by a state government in living memory'.</p>

<p>Victorian Opposition MPs told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Andrews has 'trashed' the state and should resign unless he comes up with a plan that can save livelihoods and restore hope.</p>

<p>Case numbers in Victoria have been coming down in recent weeks, with 113 recorded on Thursday.</p>

<p>But Mr Andrews still refused to talk about how to end lockdown and said he will keep Victorians in the dark for at least another week, with no plan revealed until Sunday. </p>

<p>'If I could provide a 100 per cent certain road map today, then I would. But that would not be responsible, frankly, and that is not the way that I operate,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews said that even after he comes up with a plan, it may not be implemented.</p>

<p>'It cannot be 100 per cent certain, because everything must be based on case numbers,' he said, adding that stage four lockdown might continue beyond September 13 when it is due to end.</p>

<p>Victorian Liberal MP James Newbury said Mr Andrews had ruined the state and should resign if he does not offer a good enough plan out of lockdown.</p>

<p>'Daniel Andrews has trashed the great state of Victoria,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'He let the pandemic out, crushed private enterprise and destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs. Our state has been decimated.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews said that even after he comes up with a plan to end lockdown, it may not be implemented. Pictured: A property for lease</p>

<p>'Yet the Premier has refused to soften current restrictions and instead delivers daily messages of pessimism.'</p>

<p>Mr Newbury added: 'Is there any wonder that mental health issues have crashed over the community like a tidal wave?</p>

<p>'Businesses need certainty, people need to provide for their families, and the community needs a pathway of hope.</p>

<p>'If Daniel Andrews cannot offer Victorians a 'Back to Life' plan of hope he should resign.'</p>

<p>Gideon Rozner, Director of Policy at free market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs, also slammed Mr Andrews for his 'negativity'.</p>

<p>'The Victorian people of deserve a message of hope from their Premier, not a daily telling off for not following the rules,' he told Daily Mail Australia.  </p>
