<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The NRL Grand Final has moved away from its traditional venue, the SCG, to another Sydney stadium to allow more fans to watch the game while socially distanced.  </p>

<p>The Grand Final will now be played at the larger-capacity ANZ Stadium in Sydney Olympic Park in Homebush on October 25. </p>

<p>ANZ Stadium has a capacity of 83,500 but only 40,000 tickets will go on sale from Wednesday to ensure social distancing at the game. </p>

<p>It was previously rumoured the final could be relocated to Perth or even New Zealand as the NRL was powerless to reach a decision amid COVID-19 uncertainty last month. </p>

<p>NRL CEO Andrew Abdo said they chose ANZ Stadium as it is the biggest venue in NSW so 'more of our fans will be able to experience grand final day live'.</p>

<p>'This year will be a historic grand final day. The teams competing would have overcome all challenges in front of them and we will experience the culmination of a season like no other,' Mr Abdo said. </p>

<p>'We can't wait to see 40,000 fans at the venue. Our fans have been so patient and loyal throughout the season and having crowd caps increase for the Finals Series is the perfect way to acknowledge that loyalty. </p>

<p>Mr Abdo said the 'world class' contact tracing by the NSW Government 'has enabled a crowd of 40,000 to attend our grand final day'. </p>

<p>'We will continue to follow all public health orders to ensure the general community remains healthy,' he said.   </p>

<p>NSW Minister for Tourism Stuart Ayres said ANZ Stadium and Sydney were a perfect fit for a blockbuster NRL grand final.</p>

<p>'ANZ Stadium has hosted many of Australia's most iconic moments in sporting history and the 2020 NRL grand final will be among them,' Minister Ayres said.</p>

<p>'I encourage NRL fans attending the grand final to stay COVID safe and make the most of the electric atmosphere in Sydney by making a weekend of it, booking a hotel staycation and getting out to enjoy the hospitality and attractions of the city.' </p>

<p>There are eight teams left in the running; the Penrith Panthers, Sydney Roosters, Canberra Raiders, Cronulla Sharks, South Sydney Rabbitohs, Newcastle Knights, Melbourne Storm and Parramatta Eels.  </p>
