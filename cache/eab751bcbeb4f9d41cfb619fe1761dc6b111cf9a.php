<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman has lost a whopping 180lbs after her weight took a toll over her life, feasting on three McDonald's burgers and fries every day eating a whopping 4000 calories.</p>

<p>Alex Bevacqua, 27, from Sacramento, California, grew up as an overweight child and had suffered from obesity her entire life, piling on the pounds over the years - thanks in large part to her calorie-heavy diet. </p>

<p>She admits that she ate McDonald's every day, and her typical order would consist of two McDoubles, one McChicken sandwich, a large fries and a sweet tea – but her over-the-top indulgence did not end there. </p>

<p>Transformed: 27-year-old Alex Bevacqua, from California, has revealed how she shed a whopping 180lbs after struggling with obesity from childhood </p>

<p>Changes: Alex says she used to gorge on 4,000 calories a day, binging on everything from McDonald's and fried tacos to candy and ice cream before starting her weight loss journey</p>

<p>Upset: When Alex reached her 20s, she realized that her weight was ruining her life, leaving her unable to enjoy simple things like going out and making friends </p>

<p>On top of her fast food order, Alex would consume nachos, fried tacos, burgers, ice cream, a family-sized bag of chips and various other fried foods during the day.</p>

<p>At her heaviest, Alex weighed 320lbs at her heaviest, and she says her size was making her miserable, while also preventing her from living her life to the fullest.</p>

<p>Speaking about her diet, Alex, who works as a sales director, said: 'I had been obese my entire life and the older I got the more obese I became.</p>

<p>'I probably was eating 3,000 to 4,000 calories a day... When I would cook at home, I would use a ton of oil to fry, lots of high-carb, high-fat foods including nachos, fried tacos, burgers.</p>

<p>'Snacks would be half a bag of family-sized chips, a pint of ice cream, or sometimes I would stop and get a full meal at a fast-food place and call it a 'snack'.'</p>

<p>Once she reached her early 20s, Alex felt trapped by her weight, admitting that she couldn't truly 'live her life'; she didn't go out, she struggled to find clothes that fit her, and she didn't feel confident enough to make new friends.</p>

<p>So, in October 2016, Alex decided to change her lifestyle for the better and go on a weight loss journey.</p>

<p>New normal: Alex completely transformed in diet in late 2016, giving up all high-calorie sodas, and focusing on nutritious, balanced meals, before later undergoing a gastric bypass</p>

<p>Boost: The surgery helped Alex to completely transform her body - and she has since lost a whopping 180lbs, slimming down to a svelte 140lbs (right)</p>

<p>Journey: While the surgery helped Alex to lose the weight initially, she has had to work hard to maintain her weight by following a strict healthy diet and workout regimen</p>

<p>Changes: After losing her weight, Alex was left with a lot of loose skin, so she underwent a butterfly lift tummy tuck, as well as muscle repair and a breast augmentation</p>

<p>For the first three months, Alex cut out all high-calorie sodas from her diet and focused on eating healthy and nutritious food.</p>

<p>From the fourth month onwards, Alex dropped her daily calorie intake even further and began incorporating regular exercise into her routine, including Zumba classes and signed up personal training sessions.</p>

<p>On the sixth month of her weight loss journey, Alex underwent gastric bypass surgery to reduce the size of her stomach and curb her appetite.</p>

<p>Now, Alex keeps herself active six times a week, taking HIIT classes, weight training, walking her dog regularly and ensures she hits her 10,000 steps target every day.</p>

<p>Speaking about her changing eating and exercise habits, Alex explained: 'During the first three months, I just focused on nutrition.</p>

<p>'I cut my calories down to 1,800 a day and only drank water or zero-calorie beverages.</p>

<p>'From month three to month six, I dropped my calories down to 1,600 a day and starting walking my dog 45 minutes to 1 hour every day.</p>

<p>'From the sixth month, I had gastric bypass surgery and cut my calories even lower.</p>

<p>'I also incorporated the gym; I took Zumba classes three days a week and went to a personal trainer two days a week.</p>

<p>'On the first two years, I focused on nutrition consuming low carbs and high protein along with exercise classes such as Zumba, kickboxing, spin, barre and went to a personal trainer once a week.</p>

<p>'On the third year, which is now, I make sure I am active six days a week.</p>

<p>'I do this by taking my dog on long walks, going for HIIT style classes three to four days a week plus weights two to three days a week.</p>

<p>'I also make sure I get at least 10,000 steps a day.'</p>

<p>With her new-found healthy lifestyle, Alex managed to shed 180lbs in just under three years, dropping her weight to 140lbs - which she has maintained ever since.</p>

<p>Alex now focuses on eating nutritious, high-protein meals such as oats, Greek yogurt, hearty salads - but still keeps room for some dessert.</p>

<p>Speaking about her current diet, Alex said: 'For breakfast, I usually have a smoothie with fruit, spinach, and protein power, a parfait with Greek yogurt, fruit, and bran cereal or oatmeal with chopped up fruit and protein powder.</p>

<p>'For lunch I usually have a big salad with tofu or chicken and for dinner, I usually eat grilled meat with lots of veggies.</p>

<p>'And for dessert, I'll eat a Fibre One brownie bar or sugar free chocolate.'</p>

<p>She has since undergone a butterfly lift tummy tuck, muscle repair and a breast augmentation due to the weight of her excess skin.</p>

<p>Alex said: 'My entire motto during this transformation is trying to find that balance between happy and healthy.</p>

<p>'I do not call this a diet I call it a lifestyle or way of life.</p>

<p>'I know this is something I have to be mindful of for the rest of my life and if I put deadlines or guilt myself when I mess up, I'll never find it sustainable long term.</p>

<p>'I am much more confident and happier because I am willing to push myself further than I had ever expected. It has come with some struggles I will not lie about that.</p>

<p>'I now deal with social anxiety, body dysmorphia, and have had to work through eating disorder issues.</p>

<p>'These past few years have definitely changed my thoughts of foods and has taught me how to be more mindful when eating, ordering, [and] cooking.</p>

<p>'It is not as strict as when I was losing weight because I am eating in a calorie maintenance range rather than a calorie deficit.</p>

<p>In a few words of advice to others who wish to lose weight, Alex said: 'Do not give up! Push through all the hard and find someone to talk to or relate to. It could be an Instagram, a friend or a therapist.'</p>
