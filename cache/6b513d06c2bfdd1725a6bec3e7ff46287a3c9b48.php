<p>New hair, don't care! The Bachelor's 'oppressed ranga' Zoe-Clare McDonald debuted her new cut and style after visiting a hairdresser in Brisbane on Wednesday</p>

<p>After the haircut and treatment, her long red locks were styled in loose waves and fell effortlessly by her shoulders.</p>

<p>The reality TV star showed off her slim figure in a white crop top and light blue jeans for the outing.</p>

<p>The Bachelor star completed her ensemble with a pair of white sneakers and wore a neutral palette of makeup.</p>

<p>Fresh: Zoe-Clare had her tresses trimmed and styled at hairdressing salon Edwards And Co</p>

<p>Zoe-Clare starred on this season of The Bachelor but was eliminated after failing to receive a rose from Locky Gilbert, last week. </p>

<p>Shortly after her arrival on this year's season, she went on a lengthy rant about how redheads are regularly discriminated against after Areeba Emmanuel interrupted her discussion with Locky.</p>

<p>'To me, it's disrespectful. If she wants to act the child, that's fine,' she told producers.</p>

<p>Natural beauty: She also had a gloss treatment to enhance the colour and shine of her natural red hair</p>

<p>She continued:'I'm the only redhead in the whole entire house... The only colours are blonde or brunette, and then there's me. I think that's exactly why Areeba is targeting me. It's the red hair. It's just...it's not appropriate.'</p>

<p>'Like, did Areeba do it to any of the blonde girls? Any of the brunette girls? No.' </p>

<p>She continued: 'What's wrong with a ranga? I'm sorry, do you want me to dye my hair every 10 seconds because you don't like my colour? I'm so sorry, but this is natural, guys. It's not going anywhere.' </p>

<p>Unlucky in love: Zoe-Clare starred on this season of The Bachelor but was eliminated after she failed to receive a rose from Locky Gilbert</p>
