<p>Aldi Australia is releasing a limited number of 58-inch 4K Ultra HD Android televisions</p>

<p>But bargain hunters will need to get in quick as limited stock will be available at stores across Australia.</p>

<p>Aldi sold out within minutes of opening stores across the country for its 65" version of the same television seven weeks ago.</p>

<p>Disappointed customers expressed frustration on social media about stock levels after missing out.</p>

<p>'They will only have one per store with 100s waiting at the door, Typical ALDI Australia,' one customer wrote. </p>

<p>'Just ridiculous that there was only 8 TVs in the store and all gone in the 1st minute,' another wrote.</p>

<p>The TV has Google Assistant built in, which gives the viewer direct access to streaming apps Netflix, Amazon Prime and Youtube</p>

<p>One woman described watching an elderly man get pushed over in customers' haste to get to the item. </p>

<p>The September 19 special buys sale will also feature a number of accessories, including a Fabric Soundbar for $89.99 and a movable TV wall mount for $59.99.  </p>

<p>The sound bar features two 20W remote-controlled speakers with optical inputs, Bluetooth and USB playback.  </p>

<p>Each of the devices also come with a one year warranty.  </p>
