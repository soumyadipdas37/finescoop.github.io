<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona are reportedly considering a move for ex-player Thiago Alcantara this summer, but new boss Ronald Koeman prefers a pursuit of Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum. </p>

<p>Bayern Munich playmaker Thiago, who is currently on international duty with Spain, has just a year left on his contract and has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League, with Liverpool and Manchester United interested. </p>

<p>But Barca, where Thiago came through the famed youth system at before leaving in 2013, are also keeping an eye on the Spaniard's situation yet new boss Koeman is more keen on Wijnaldum due to their time together with the Holland national team, according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo. </p>

<p>Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara is now an option for former club Barcelona </p>

<p>Yet Ronald Koeman prefers Georginio Wijnaldum following their time together with Holland </p>

<p>The report details that with Wijnaldum's contract also set to expire next summer, Barca think they can nab the Dutchman at an affordable price, around the £22m (€25m) mark. </p>

<p>Koeman is particularly keen on strengthening his midfield, given the departure last week of Ivan Rakitic to Sevilla and the likely hole left by Arturo Vidal leaving the club in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>Wijnaldum, 29, worked under head coach Koeman with the Holland national team from 2018-2020. </p>

<p>Club sources say that Thiago is a player the coaching staff like, but believe the situation is complicated, particularly given Liverpool's longstanding interest in the 29-year-old. </p>

<p>Thiago progressed through the youth system into the first-team at Barca, but left in 2013 </p>

<p>Both players are options for the Catalans though, with Koeman planning a first-team overhaul this summer following the European humiliation against Bayern last month.  </p>

<p>Barca also lost their LaLiga crown and although Lionel Messi has performed a U-turn on his future and decided to stay at the club, Luis Suarez is another senior player on his way out - seemingly to Juventus.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Thiago - who is currently on international duty - refused to comment on speculation linking him with a move away. </p>

<p>Thiago is currently on international duty with Spain for their UEFA Nations League games</p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara hinted on Saturday that he may stay at Bayern Munich for the coming season</p>

<p>'I have not told anyone that I'm leaving,' Thiago said on Saturday ahead of Spain's game against Ukraine on Sunday. </p>

<p>'Every year, they put me in a different club. For me my future is tomorrow's game (against Ukraine) and there is nothing more to say. </p>

<p>'I neither care nor am I interested. What interests me is tomorrow.'   </p>
