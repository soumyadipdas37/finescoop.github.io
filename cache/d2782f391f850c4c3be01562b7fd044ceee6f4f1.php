<p>Hello sunshine: Lewis Burton was pictured making the most of his trip to Marbella on Thursday, as he relaxed with a group of friends</p>

<p>Lewis appeared to be in his element as he relaxed on a sun lounger, while cooling himself down with a long, cold drink.</p>

<p>He was seen chatting with a blonde female friend, who caught the eye in a neon green bikini as she lounged beside him in the sunshine. </p>

<p>The hunk flew on a private jet formerly owned by Lewis Hamilton to Biggin Hill airport in London on August 24 after holidaying on the Spanish party island with his influencer girlfriend, 21.</p>

<p>Eight days later, Lewis travelled to Marbella, making him in breach of the government's quarantine rules and susceptible to a £1,000 fine.</p>

<p>Holidaymakers returning from Spain to the UK are required to self-isolate for 14-days, a rule which was made compulsory from July 27.</p>

<p>Lewis spent a week in Ibiza with Lottie, where the new couple were seen passionately kissing, before arriving back at his Kent home for eight days.</p>

<p>Caroline Flack's ex-boyfriend has since been posting photos on his Instagram story from Marbella, including at restaurant Nobu and hotel Puente Romano.</p>

<p>The model appears to be abroad with pal Steven Sulley, who has also been sharing pictures from Marbella on his social media.</p>

<p>Lewis has likely put others at risk by breaking the law and flying to Marbella, despite only being eight days into his quarantine. </p>

<p>First, fill in a 'locator form' online. This includes your travel history, contact details and the UK address where you will be self-isolating for 14 days. Border Force agents will check you have completed this form before you are allowed through passport control. </p>

<p>Does quarantine really mean 14 days indoors?</p>

<p>Yes. You can't nip out to exercise or shop, and are not allowed visitors unless they are providing emergency help or medical care. Food should be ordered online or delivered by friends or family.</p>

<p>Does anyone else in my house have to self-isolate if they didn't travel?</p>

<p>No. Only those who travelled to a quarantine country have to self-isolate for 14 days. The rest of the household can carry on as normal – although they should try to minimise contact with anyone who is self-isolating.</p>

<p>What happens to those who break the rules?</p>

<p>Even failing to fill out a locator form is a criminal offence, which could result in a £100 fine. Those caught breaching quarantine face a £1,000 penalty in England, or even prosecution – which can result in an unlimited fine.</p>

<p>How will this be enforced?</p>

<p>Public health officials will carry out random checks by telephone. If these raise doubts, police will visit the address in question. </p>

<p>I have a holiday booked to a quarantine country. Should I go anyway?</p>

<p>It's up to you. The Foreign Office now warns against 'all but essential' travel to countries on the list. Most insurance policies will not cover medical expenses in this scenario. In addition, countries are likely to respond with their own measures for arrivals from Britain.    </p>

<p>The 14-day self-isolation period was instated following a rise in coronavirus cases in Spain, and the Balearic and Canary Islands in late July. </p>

<p>Quarantining means you aren't able to leave your house for exercise or to go to the shops and visitors are prohibited, unless they are providing emergency help or medical care.  </p>

<p>Those caught breaching quarantine face a £1,000 penalty in England, or even prosecution – which can result in an unlimited fine. </p>

<p>If you're returning to the UK from countries such as France, Portugal, Austria, Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba, Czech Republic, Jamaica or Switzerland, you will be required to self-isolate. </p>

<p>Lottie, who should be quarantining following her trip to Ibiza, posted a picture on Wednesday, which was taken in Brighton, with the caption: 'Mid-week hair flick' though it is unclear if the snap is a throwback.  </p>

<p>Lewis became romantically involved with Lottie five months after the tragic passing of Love Island host Caroline Flack, who took her life aged 40.</p>

<p>The model last posted about the loss of Caroline in March, one month after her death. </p>

<p>He said on Instagram: 'It's already been a month, I love and miss you so much, I never thought that one day I will never be able to see or speak to you again. </p>

<p>'I wake up and think you're going to be laying next to me or you're going to call me in a minute. </p>

<p>'It just doesn't seem real.'  </p>

<p>Caroline's mum Christine recently voiced her opinion towards Lewis' new relationship by posting comments on photographs of her daughter with her former boyfriend. </p>

<p>Christine wrote 'This relationship did end her life' on a picture of Caroline and Lewis taken in August 2019 and 'he's doing the same pose with a different girl' on a separate post.</p>

<p>Writing on a photo shared to Caroline's Instagram profile of her and Lewis, Christine added: 'Want this deleted so much.' </p>

<p>Another follower commented: 'He's got a new gal and she's dead. I honestly blame his womanising ways, poor Caroline.'</p>

<p>Christine replied: 'I agree.' She also wrote elsewhere in the comments section: 'I feel the same this photo is a lie.' </p>

<p>Sultry: Lottie posted a picture taken by a photographer on Wednesday, which was shot in Brighton, with the caption: 'Mid-week hair flick' though it is unclear if the snap is a throwback </p>
