<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Anthony Joshua may well be one of the most fearsome heavyweights on the planet but even he didn't fancy his chances up against some of the spiciest sauces on the shelves.</p>

<p>The unified world champion went head to head with UFC star Israel Adesanya in a crazy hot sauce challenge on First We Feast YouTube's channel.</p>

<p>In the hilarious video, AJ and Adesanya had to answer some fairly hard-hitting questions truthfully or face taking a bite out of a chicken wing dabbed in one of three hot sauces varying in intensity. </p>

<p>Anthony Joshua (R) and Israel Adesanya (L) faced off in a hilarious hot sauce challenge</p>

<p>Joshua made Adesanya try the first sauce after suggesting his answer was not truthful enough</p>

<p>The Brit escaped the first round unscathed after giving his opinion on YouTubers becoming professional boxers for one fight and getting multi-million pound paydays. </p>

<p>'The thing that annoys me the most is there is so much talent from the grassroots level who are trying to get their name recognised by the bigger audience and they’re struggling so it’s kind of a world of who is popular and who can just do it versus who is talented and who is trying to get their name recognised but isn’t get a look in,' he said.</p>

<p>'But the big benefit of it for the sport is it that it attracts a whole new audience.' After the first couple of rounds the questions began to get tougher. UFC's middleweight world champion Adesanya was the first to take the plunge after failing to reveal what media reporters he feels cover him unfairly.</p>

<p>Joshua hesitated trying the most mild of hot sauces after not saying what film he's cried at</p>

<p>After some encouragement from Adesanya, AJ finally took a bite of the chicken wing</p>

<p>'I’d love to answer that one but I blocked them in real life,' Adesanya said. 'You know that episode in Black Mirror where you block them and they become a blur, I’ve done that to a couple of reporters and I can’t remember their names but I know their faces and if I did remember it, I’d say it.'</p>

<p>But AJ wasn't convinced by his answer and shouted: 'I think that's a dab!' Adesanya had no major problems dealing with the first sauce, though he did describe it as 'tantalising'.</p>

<p>Joshua's turn was next after he refused to answer what the last film that reduced him to tears. After some hesitation and pretending to dip his chicken wing in the sauce , Joshua finally took a bite and appeared unfazed. </p>

<p>Joshua named Emanuele Leo as the easiest victory of his career in the truth or dare game</p>

<p>Adesanya admitted most annoying thing about Dana White (L) is that he is 'very emotional'</p>

<p>The 30-year-old got through the rest of his questions by admitting that his first-round knockout victory over Emanuele Leo on his debut was the easiest win of his career and naming Don King as a promoter who has been suspected of fixing fights. King has always denied any accusations of fight-fixing.</p>

<p>Adesanya said Dana White’s most annoying quality is that he is very emotional but insisted that was also his strength and has contributed to helping the UFC become the global enterprise it is today. </p>

<p>But the UFC champion would end up trying the second hottest sauce after volunteering himself to do it.  </p>

<p>After being asked who is the dirtiest fight, he said: 'There’s a few,' before even naming one fighter who he thought might have 'some extra supplements south of the border that he takes.' </p>

<p>Adesanya was shocked at how hot the middle sauce was after trying a little bit on his finger</p>

<p>The UFC champion said 'you could put this sauce on the food of the people you hate'</p>

<p>'I don’t understand the stress it takes to cheat but I feel like trying this one anyway so I might try some of this on one of these chicken wings. We can’t just go through this trying only one sauce, you got to break at least two.'</p>

<p>After trying just a tiny bit on his finger, Adesanya said: 'Wow it jumps up levels, if that (picked up the first bottle of sauce) was level three, this is level six. </p>

<p>'That is a big jump. If you hate someone you can put this in their food but I’ll try a little bit because I’m no b****.' </p>

<p>After the round of questions were over, Joshua and Adesanya braved it by going in to try more of the sauces. </p>

<p>Both men are currently preparing to defend their titles with Adesanya taking on Paulo Costa next Sunday and Joshua expected to face Kubrat Pulev at the backend of this year.</p>
