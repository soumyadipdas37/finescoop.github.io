<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A young dancer threw herself from an eighth storey balcony because she felt there was no other way to escape her abusive boyfriend.</p>

<p>Georgia Brodrick, 22, has bravely opened up about the day she hurled herself over the balcony of her apartment in Melbourne's CBD. </p>

<p>On the morning of July 17, a hysterical Ms Brodrick called her father to come pick her up after learning her controlling boyfriend had cheated on her.  </p>

<p>'My dad didn't make it before I jumped,' she told Daily Mail Australia.  </p>

<p>Georgia Brodrick, 22, felt so helpless and thought she had no other option but to jump from her eighth floor apartment in Melbourne's CBD on July 17</p>

<p>Ms Brodrick, who is unemployed as a result of the pandemic, has blacked out the moment she fell from her balcony (pictured above) and plunged to the ground</p>

<p>She landed on a fence and her body bounced into a nearby ditch.</p>

<p>The young woman was so battered that doctors gave her a ten per cent chance of survival.</p>

<p>'I was rushed to the Alfred Hospital where they put me in an induced coma and performed emergency surgery to my left arm as it was partially amputated,' she said.  </p>

<p>Ms Brodrick was unconscious for seven days with a broken back, neck and leg, but says she is no longer in pain.</p>

<p>She has blocked out all memories of the horrible moments before she jumped.</p>

<p>Because of the damage, Ms Brodrick is now in a wheelchair after being in the trauma ward for three weeks where she had to be fed through a tube. </p>

<p>'All the doctors believed that it was a miracle that I survived without any brain damage,' she said.  </p>

<p>Ms Brodrick and her partner had started fighting but when she tried to escape him and leave, she claims he turned abusive</p>

<p>Ms Brodrick was put into a coma for seven days with a broken back, neck and leg and hopes she will be able to walk again in the coming months</p>

<p>The young woman said she never realised just how much she was being manipulated by her partner.</p>

<p>'If I tried to leave him he would sit at the front door and wouldn’t let me out of the apartment,' she said.</p>

<p>'My family tried to warn me because they could see through his manipulation, so he constantly put them down and blamed them for my insecurities.</p>

<p>'He made me feel like he was the only person who truly loved me ... I am safe with my family and am getting the help I need.'</p>

<p>Ms Brodrick said she is happy to have survived as she feels like she isn't being 'controlled' anymore and is positive about her future. </p>

<p>Because of the damage Ms Brodrick is now in a wheelchair after being in the trauma ward for three weeks where she had to be fed through a tube</p>

<p>When she was put into an induced coma Ms Brodrick's friends started a GoFundMe to help with future surgeries. </p>

<p>'She has had a lot of surgeries but she will still have a massive recovery ahead,' the fundraiser read.</p>

<p>'There is going to be a lot of cost to get our girl back on her feet as she may never be able to walk properly again.'</p>

<p>'The money will be going to get her Dialectical behaviour therapy as well as rehab and other treatments along the way.' </p>

<p>Ms Brodrick hopes to walk again by Christmas, but doesn't know if she'll ever regain full function of her left arm.</p>

<p>'At the moment I can only wiggle my fingers a tiny bit,' she said. </p>

<p>Her advice to others in the same situation is to seek help as soon as possible.</p>

<p>'Please speak to a family member or a close friend that you trust, ask them for help and organise a plan to get out of the dangerous situation.'</p>
