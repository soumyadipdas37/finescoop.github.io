<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When under-fire Annastacia Palaszczuk teared up in public last week about 'losing loved ones' during the pandemic, she was thinking of her grandmother, 95, who quietly died two months ago.   </p>

<p>The Queensland Premier was angrily accused of 'crocodile tears' on social media last week when she choked up over criticism about a nurse, 26, being banned from attending her dad's funeral.  </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk's health officials told Sarah Caisip, from virus-free Canberra, that she couldn't attend the funeral under the state's strict hotel quarantine and border arrangements. </p>

<p>Amid a media furore and growing exasperation with the state shutting its doors to the rest of the country, the Premier welled up as she said: 'I'm human like everyone else.  </p>

<p>'These issues hurt me deeply. They hurt me deeply because during this pandemic I have lost loved ones as well. I know exactly what people are going through, OK?' </p>

<p>Despite critical comments on social media, it can be revealed that the Premier quietly mourned the death of her 'best friend' two months ago.   </p>

<p>The Premier's nanna Beryl Erskine died in June 21. She was 95.   </p>

<p>Annastacia Palaszczuk's grandmother Beryl Erskine (together, above) died age 95 on June 21 - the Queensland Premier keeping the family death private </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk's voice cracked as she spoke last week, and she didn't single out who she was specifically speaking about.</p>

<p>That gave rise to criticism on social media she was performing or being insincere. </p>

<p>One Facebook user called her a 'paid actress' and another labelled it 'crocodile tears'. </p>

<p>A third added 'I bet she didn't cry before there was a public backlash,' while a fourth said: 'Right now I'm ashamed to be a Queenslander.'</p>

<p>But a newspaper death notice makes clear that the Premier had simply kept the death of Mrs Erskine private until now. </p>

<p>In the death notice, the late Mrs Erskine was described as 'adored by all who knew her'.  </p>

<p>'Annastacia' was simply listed among Mrs Erskine's beloved grandkids, alongside her three sisters Catherine, Nadia and Julia, and the Premier's parents Lorelle and Henry.</p>

<p>She wasn't specifically described as the grandmother of the state's premier. </p>

<p>Under coronavirus restrictions, her funeral was open to up to 100 guests who were required to abide by social distancing restrictions. </p>

<p>In a sign of the times, it was also livestreamed. </p>

<p>The death went unremarked upon by the media until the identity of her mystery loved one was reported by InQueensland at the weekend. </p>

<p>It has since been confirmed by state government officials.   </p>

<p>A death notice printed in the Courier Mail name-checked the Queensland Premier and members of her family as it broke the news of Mrs Erskine's daeth</p>

<p>The criticism comes at a time of intense public pressure for Ms Palasczuk, weeks before the October 31 election.</p>

<p>An opinion poll commissioned by a coal company and released on Monday showed a surge in support for the Opposition in marginal seats.</p>

<p>A tradesman paid for a plane to fly over Brisbane late last week carrying the slogan: 'VOTE HER OUT'.  </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk's announcement that the state was welcoming 400 AFL officials, players and their wives for the grand final - and allowing them to quarantine at a resort - has likewise sparked criticism, coming about the same time desperate daughter Ms Caisip was refused to attend a funeral.  </p>

<p>Mrs Erskine (centre) was mobbed by reporters when she arrived at her granddaughter's election victory party in 2015 - and was confident Ms Palaszczuk would win</p>

<p>There is no doubt Ms Palaszczuk was close with her nana - with a record of speaking about her over two terms as Premier. </p>

<p>Mrs Erskine wheeled into Ms Palaszczuk's election party in 2015 and made an early prediction to reporters that she would win.</p>

<p>'Her best quality? Her brains, she's got a brain,' Mrs Erskine said.</p>

<p>During her victory speech, Ms Palaszczuk said: 'Hi nanna'. </p>

<p>In 2017, Ms Palaszczuk visited her grandma at her retirement village the same she visited the state's Governor to dissolve Parliament and announce an election. </p>

<p>'She's very important to me,' the Premier tweeted at the time. </p>

<p>The Premier most recently mentioned Mrs Erskine in Parliament at the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>'I've got a grandmother in aged care,' she told Parliament in March. 'I understand people are anxious about their loved ones.' </p>

<p>Three months later, Mrs Erskine died peacefully with her daughters at her side.  </p>

<p>Sarah Caisip (above) was allowed to see her father's body, alone, while dressed in full personal protective equipment</p>

<p>Queensland Health officials sparked a furore last week when Canberra nurse Sarah Caisip was told she couldn't attend her father's funeral in Brisbane.</p>

<p>Ms Caisip went public from hotel quarantine and her plight moved Prime Minister Scott Morrison to implore Ms Palaszczuk to make an exception.  </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk told state Parliament she 'would not be bullied' by Mr Morrison. </p>

<p>She said the authority for the decision rested with the chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young.</p>

<p>As controversy raged, Ms Caisip was granted something of a reprieve and allowed to see her father's body, alone, following the funeral.</p>

<p>But she was required to dress in full personal protective equipment - including a face shield - and was unable to hug her nearby family members. </p>

<p>The incident became symbolic of the political row over border closures. </p>
