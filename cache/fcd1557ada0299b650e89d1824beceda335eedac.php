<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Surgeons have been forced to ‘play God’ by selecting which patients they operate on during the pandemic, leading doctors warned yesterday. </p>

<p>The toll among cancer patients who have missed out on treatment may surpass that of Covid itself, they admit. </p>

<p>Ben Challacombe, a urological surgeon at Guy’s and St Thomas’ in London, said: ‘We may eventually win the battle with Covid and lose the war with cancer.’ </p>

<p>Ben Challacombe (pictured) has warned 'We may eventually win the battle with Covid and lose the war with cancer'</p>

<p>He said many patients were arriving with severely advanced cancer because they had not sought treatment during lockdown. </p>

<p>‘The second resurgence of cancer will come, unfortunately,’ he said. </p>

<p>Calling for a national awareness campaign, he added: ‘We need to just encourage everybody to go and get checked.’</p>

<p>Speaking at a meeting of the Royal Society of Medicine, Mr Challacombe said surgeons have had to agree between them which patients got theatre time. </p>

<p>They quickly realised they were effectively ‘playing God’, he said, and set up committees to decide which patients should take priority. </p>

<p>Those with severe non-cancerous conditions – such as enlarged prostates, gallstones and arthritic hips – have had to wait while those with life-threatening tumours went to the front of the queue. </p>

<p>But those patients with less severe conditions have suffered while waiting for treatment, experts said. </p>

<p>Mr Challacombe who works at Guy’s and St Thomas’ in London was speaking at a meeting of the Royal Society of Medicine and revealed surgeons have had to agree between them which patients got theatre time</p>

<p>Professor Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, told the meeting: ‘The harsh reality is that many patients will have worse outcomes than they should have had if we had not had this crisis and this delay. </p>

<p>‘We have never had to deal with anything like this before.’ He cited official figures which reveal more than two million people have waited more than the 18-week maximum for a procedure. </p>

<p>Professor Alderson said this will have a huge impact on patients. </p>

<p>‘The scale of the problem is unprecedented,’ he said. </p>

<p>It comes as figures reveal that more than 1,500 breast cancer patients have been denied reconstruction during the pandemic, and may have to wait years to get a procedure.</p>

<p>The Breast Cancer Now charity said last night women were being forced to live with one breast, no breasts, or asymmetric breasts. </p>

<p>Chief executive Baroness Delyth Morgan said: ‘We are deeply concerned. </p>

<p>Reconstructive surgery is an essential part of recovery after breast cancer for those who choose it.’ </p>
