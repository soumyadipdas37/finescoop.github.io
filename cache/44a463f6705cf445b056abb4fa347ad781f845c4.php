<p>And Christine Quinn proved that she can even make a bikini look high fashion as she turned a luxury yacht into her personal runway on Friday. </p>

<p>The reality star, 31, is currently on a two-week cruise in Croatia with her multi-millionaire husband, retired tech entrepreneur Christian Richard, 41, and has certainly been living the high life. </p>

<p>Looking good: Christine Quinn proved that she can even make a bikini look high fashion as she turned a luxury yacht into her personal runway on Friday</p>

<p>Fun in the sun: The reality star, 31, is currently on a two-week cruise in Croatia with her multi-millionaire husband, retired tech entrepreneur Christian Richard, 41</p>

<p>Layering up, the reality starlet also donned black hotpants that clung to her perky derriere.  </p>

<p>Fashionista: Christine is famed not just for her acid tongue, but her incredible wardrobe on Selling Sunset</p>

<p>Tanned and toned: Soaking up the sunshine on the deck of their luxury liner, Christine looked phenomenal as she modelled her scanty bikinis</p>

<p>While Christine often shows off her incredible figure, she has made no secret of the fact that she has had cosmetic surgery, and is passionate that people should be honest about any procedures they've undergone.  </p>

<p>The blonde bombshell told Vogue: 'I'm all about plastic surgery truth-bearing. It's important in a world where there's this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia. </p>

<p>'People think that [things are] real, and it's not. I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of make-up. </p>

<p>'How I look on Selling Sunset is not how I look when I wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>'The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two-and-a-half to three hours. My glam isn't cheap, either – $1,000 a day, if I go all out. It's expensive to look this cheap.' </p>

<p>Christine went on to say in season one she wasn't doing as well financially so used to buy designer clothes and then return them after filming.</p>

<p>Wild thing! Putting her ample cleavage and toned stomach on display, the real estate agent looked phenomenal in a neon green zebra print bikini top</p>

<p>Looking good! She teamed the item with tie side briefs that clung to her peachy posterior and exposed her enviably long legs</p>

<p>Pricey: Showcasing her love of luxury labels, the blonde bombshell accessorised with a $395 Balenciaga baseball cap and $499 Louis Vuitton shades</p>

<p>Two's company: Christine was joined by a female pal on the outing and seemed in good spirits as they chatted away to one another </p>

<p>This comes just after Christine told The Sunday Times that she has shed a tear or two over 'hurtful' trolls reacting to her role on Selling Sunset. </p>

<p>The siren said: 'People that don't know me say hurtful things. I'm just like, "Ugh, whatever." I don't know these people. </p>

<p>'But when I hear stuff from other people… That's upsetting. Sometimes, it hurts my feelings. Sometimes, it makes me cry.'</p>

<p>Although she's as vulnerable as the next person, Christine clarified she has no intention of toning down her villainous persona.</p>

<p>She said: 'That's what people love about me. But obviously there are different sides to me. On the show, it's one note. But I'm a multifaceted villain.'</p>

<p>Season three of Selling Sunset saw Christine tie the knot businessman Christian at a downtown Los Angeles cathedral in front of 75 friends and family, where they even had black swans in attendance. </p>

<p>Candid: While Christine often shows off her incredible figure, she has made no secret of the fact that she has had cosmetic surgery</p>

<p>Honest: Christine is passionate that people should be honest about any procedures they've undergone</p>

<p>Spot on: She told Vogue, 'I'm all about plastic surgery truth-bearing. It's important in a world where there's this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia'</p>

<p>Although the wedding took place in December 2019, fans were not able to see any pictures of footage from the big day until last month, ahead of the latest series' debut.  </p>

<p>The bride was a vision in a billowing black gown, and looked lovely even though she was sick with coronavirus at the time.</p>

<p>The winter wonderland wedding was put together in just two months by Beverly Hills event planner Lisa Lafferty with 'love' as the budget and included black stallions, a bleeding cake topped with gargoyles, and real snow in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Thrifty: Christine went on to say in season one she wasn't doing as well financially so used to buy designer clothes and then return them after filming</p>

<p>Upsetting: This comes just after Christine told The Sunday Times that she has shed a tear or two over 'hurtful' trolls reacting to her role on Selling Sunset</p>

<p>Christine told People magazine: 'We wanted to get married in December to start off the New Year [as husband and wife]. And a winter wonderland theme with a wicked twist is memorable forever.</p>

<p>'I never conformed to the status quo or societal expectations. I’ve always enjoyed being bold, different and trendsetting. </p>

<p>'I’ve always wanted to get married in a black wedding dress, and I’m so happy that my dream came true.'</p>

<p>Sizzling: Christine proved she was living the millionaire lifestyle as she shared a slew of the bikini-clad snaps from her Croatia trip on Instagram</p>

<p>But the real estate agent, who recently worked with Farrah Abraham of Teen Mom fame, did not feel her best.</p>

<p>Talking to Goss Chats, she said: 'I was really, really sick on my wedding day. I actually had, which I now know, was corona.</p>

<p>'I got really sick in late December and we were travelling. I was sick for about a month when we were filming.</p>

<p>'I couldn’t even have a bachelorette party, I was so bummed about that. That time was such a high but a low at the same time.' </p>

<p>Here comes the bride: Season three of Selling Sunset saw Christine tie the knot businessman Christian at a downtown Los Angeles cathedral in front of 75 friends and family</p>
