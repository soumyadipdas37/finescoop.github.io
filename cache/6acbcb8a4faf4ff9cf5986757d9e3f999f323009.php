<p>'A dream come true!' On Wednesday, Farmer Wants a Wife alum Nikki Warren (right) revealed she's going to be appearing on Home and Away alongside Sam Frost (left)</p>

<p>'I've watched Home and Away for many years, and to be selected to do some extras work is a dream come true,' Nikki wrote in the caption. </p>

<p>'I was also lucky to get a photo with this absolute stunner Sam Frost.' </p>

<p>While Nikki is only appearing as an extra, this is a great way for her to gain valuable on-set experience and could lead to a speaking role in the future. </p>

<p>A foot in the door! While Nikki is only appearing as an extra, this is a great way for her to gain valuable on-set experience and could lead to a speaking role in the future</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for Australian reality stars to make the jump to acting. </p>

<p>Sam Frost was the Bachelorette before landing her role on Home and Away, and (until recently) former Bachelor Tim Robards had a regular spot on Neighbours. </p>

<p>Nikki briefly appeared on Farmer Wants a Wife earlier this year and hoped to get a place on Alex Taylor's property, but was not selected.  </p>

<p>Remember her? Nikki briefly appeared on Farmer Wants a Wife earlier this year and hoped to get a place on Alex Taylor's property, but was not selected</p>

<p>'This moment was definitely up there with one of the hardest moments I've had to face. After 12-hour days of filming, no one was ready and prepared to go home this early,' Nikki said at the time.</p>

<p>'We all wanted to get to know Farmer Alex a little more. But I have no regrets, it was such a great experience and I have made life long friends.' </p>

<p>Instead, Alex chose Henrietta, Sarah, Jessica and Britanny to go to his farm. He ended up choosing Henrietta at the end of the season.   </p>
