<p>Michael suffered a near-fatal brain injury back in December 2013 when he fell and hit his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in the French Alps.</p>

<p>Schumacher was placed in a medically-induced coma which he is now out of, but following the skiing accident seven years ago, his condition has been kept a closely guarded secret from those outside his Lake Geneva mansion.</p>

<p>Schumacher won 72 of his record 91 victories for Ferrari but was unable to be there to celebrate his former team's landmark race at Mugello.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old said it was an 'honour' to drive the iconic car around the old-school circuit</p>

<p>It is the second time Mick has driven his father's F2004 after he took it for a spin at the 2019 German Grand Prix to mark 15 years since Michael's iconic World title.</p>

<p>After coming back into the pits, Mick said: 'This was always a dream for me to drive this car.</p>

<p>'I drove the car at Hockenheim last year but to drive it at Mugello in non-rainy conditions has been an absolute honour.'</p>

<p>The sound of the V10 engine pleased many watching fans as they reminisced over the dominant car.</p>
