<p>The attendant was one of two cabin crew members injured during a domestic flight from Melbourne to Adelaide in September 2017.</p>

<p>A new Australian Transport Safety Bureau report has found the actions of the captain, a first officer acting as pilot, contributed to their injuries.</p>

<p>A Virgin Australia flight attendant eating a meal in an aircraft galley suffered a broken leg when a high-speed descent went wrong (file picture)</p>

<p>The Boeing 737 was instructed by air traffic control to perform a high-speed descent near Adelaide Airport.</p>

<p>A sudden wind change during the descent resulted in the aircraft's speed increasing and approaching the maximum operating limit of 340 knots.</p>

<p>The concerned captain abruptly pulled back on the control, disconnecting the autopilot.</p>

<p>It meant sudden changes to the aircraft's pitch altitude and vertical acceleration as the attendants stood in the rear galley eating a meal.</p>

<p>Both suffered injuries during the incident, the report said, with one 'badly' breaking their leg.</p>

<p>It then took over 90 minutes for the crew member to be removed from the plane after touching down in Adelaide.</p>

<p>They were unable to walk or sit in a wheelchair and an ambulance stretcher would not fit down the aisle, the report noted.</p>

<p>Emergency services ultimately dragged the injured staff member to the front of the aircraft using a slide sheet before moving them onto a stretcher.</p>

<p>The ATSB said Virgin has since changed procedures for ground staff responding to emergency services requests, and has updated training and information for pilots on overspeed and overspeed recovery.</p>

<p>Dr Stuart Godley, the bureau's director of transport safety, said the commercial flight had exceeded its maximum operating speed by one knot.</p>

<p>He said it served as a reminder to pilots that they can decline air traffic control instructions if they believe them unsafe in the circumstances.</p>
