<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Backpackers who were forced to work seven days a week for just $111 in oppressive conditions have opened up about the seedy underbelly of farm work in Australia. </p>

<p>The federal Government requires young travellers who want to extend their Working Holiday Visa for an extra year to spend 88 days working in regional areas.</p>

<p>They are frequently exploited by farmers and contractors looking for cheap labour and made to endure harsh conditions just to qualify for an extra year in Australia.</p>

<p>Many backpackers like American Kiah Fowler lost their hospitality jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic and moved to do their regional work. </p>

<p>The tourist told the ABC, she looked for work in Bundaberg, in the Wide Bay region, after losing her hospitality job in Airlie Beach due to coronavirus restrictions.     </p>

<p>Ms Fowler said she saw the 'underbelly' of the industry as she tried to find enough work to pay for food and rent.  </p>

<p>The Fair Work Ombudsman has identified the horticulture sector in Queensland's Wide Bay region as 'high risk' for underpaying staff and breaching workplace laws. </p>

<p> Workers report being paid $19 an hour when the minimum wage for a casual in Australia is $19.84 plus at least 25 per cent loading (stock image)</p>

<p>Ms Fowler described how she saw two sides of the industry whilst working as a backpacker.  </p>

<p>'I've met some really lovely farmers who pay the legal wage and do their best to give good working conditions … and then you have this flipside which is the underbelly of the industry,' she said.  </p>

<p>Ms Fowler contacted a labour hire company offering share accommodation and work planting strawberries but had to leave as she was earning less than her rent.  </p>

<p>She was paid just $19 an hour when the minimum wage for a casual in Australia is $19.84 plus at least 25 per cent loading.  </p>

<p>'I was very frustrated when I found out that they were intentionally underpaying people,' she said.   </p>

<p>Backpackers received pay slips that stated they had been paid 9.5 per cent superannuation which was not true</p>

<p>Netherlands backpacker, Merlee Quuak, 24, had a similar experience when she arrived in Bundaberg. </p>

<p>'I worked seven days a week … the most I made in one week was $111,' she said.</p>

<p>With only three months left on her visa, Ms Quaak said she picked tomatoes and any other jobs she could find - but the pay did not cover her hostel rent. </p>

<p>'I didn't have any time to complain or wait for a good job, I just needed to get my days done so I had to accept whatever I was getting.'</p>

<p>She found hourly work in a packing shed but uncovered another dirty practice with pay slips saying she receiving 9.5 per cent superannuation that was never paid. </p>

<p>Farmers often pay seasonal workers per row of fruit, per basket or per hour.  Ms Quaak's payslips did not specify and listed her job as 'covering'.  </p>

<p>'Covering is working in the field, which I didn't do,' she said. </p>

<p>Fair Work Australia has confirmed it is looking into employers in the region which is highly dominated by the horticultural and agricultural sector.  </p>

<p>It comes after a national review in 2018, the Harvest Trail Inquiry, which revealed workers had been underpaid more than $1million dollars. </p>

<p>At the time, 638 businesses were investigated and half were found to be in breach of labour laws and were underpaying staff and falsifying records.  </p>

<p>In August, Fair Work inspectors revisited businesses that were identified in the report - and also conducted investigations into employers in Wide Bay and Moreton Bay.  </p>

<p>At least 38 businesses were in breach of labour laws. </p>

<p>The regulator said improving conditions remains a priority and it will continue to work with employers, relevant unions, grower bodies and national supermarkets to improve conditions for workers.   </p>
