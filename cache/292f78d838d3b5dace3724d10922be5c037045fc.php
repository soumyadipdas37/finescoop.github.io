<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An off-road biker has been jailed for nine years for killing a 'peacemaker' with a single punch after he asked him to stop 'dangerous' nuisance riding near children.</p>

<p>James Rowley, 21, attacked Joe Higgins, 41, in front of youngsters in Radford, Coventry as the victim returned home from celebrating St Patrick's Day on March 17.</p>

<p>The father-of-two fled the scene of the killing, where he had been noisily 'showing off' on grassland despite having no licence or insurance, and was arrested two days later.</p>

<p>Mr Higgins, who lived in Bedford but was originally from Coventry, died in hospital a day after suffering a head injury. </p>

<p>Joe Higgins, 41, was attacked in front of children in Radford, Coventry, as he returned home from celebrating St Patrick's Day on March 17</p>

<p>James Rowley, 21, killed Mr Higgins with one punch before fleeing the scene of the crime</p>

<p>Rowley initially claimed to have acted in self-defence but later pleaded guilty to unlawful killing at Warwick Crown Court.</p>

<p>Judge Sylvia de Bertodano was told Rowley, who also admitted dangerous driving, had previously been given a referral order as a teenager for an assault in which his victim lost consciousness.</p>

<p>Passing sentence today, the judge said he had given police a false account of what happened as Mr Higgins returned home from celebrating St Patrick's Day with his cousin.</p>

<p>She said: 'You were riding your motorbike in a way that was clearly dangerous and aggressive.</p>

<p>'You shouldn't in fact have been driving it at all as you had no licence and no insurance.</p>

<p>'Having ridden it on the wrong side of the road and through a red light... you arrived at Jubilee Crescent. You started riding the bike on the grassed area there.</p>

<p>'The bike had no lights and the danger you were causing was obvious - so obvious that a bystander called the police.</p>

<p>'It was this behaviour that caused Joe Higgins to come over and speak to you.'</p>

<p>Addressing the attack itself, the judge added: 'He tried to speak to you politely and tell you to stop.</p>

<p>'In the words of his brother, he was being a good citizen. You however refused to listen. You revved the engine and asked him if he 'wanted to get battered'.</p>

<p>'You then got off the bike with the clear intention of inflicting violence on Joe Higgins.</p>

<p>'You were described by one witness as bouncing on your toes like a boxer. Joe Higgins had his hands down.</p>

<p>Rowley initially claimed to have acted in self-defence but later pleaded guilty to unlawful killing at Warwick Crown Court</p>

<p>'One witness described it as the most vicious punch he had ever seen.</p>

<p>'The punch caused him to fall to the ground and hit his head, whereupon you rode off dangerously and at speed, taking, as you went, his hat.'</p>

<p>The judge, who ordered Rowley to serve a two-year driving ban after his release from prison, added: 'On the facts of this case, the defendant was behaving in an aggressive manner well before he came across Joe Higgins.</p>

<p>'It [the punch] was sufficiently hard to bring a 17-stone man to the ground, a man who was acting as peacemaker, had his hands down and was unable to react to the blow.'</p>

<p>Prior to sentence, defence QC Kevin Hegarty, offering mitigation, said Mr Higgins had become concussed because he had hit his head on the ground.</p>

<p>Victim impact statements were also read to the court, including from the victim's partner and his twin brother Chris Higgins.</p>

<p>In his statement, Mr Higgins described his brother, a stepfather to three children, as a 'gentle giant' and true gentleman who was kind, caring and fun.</p>

<p>'At 41 he had his whole life ahead of him,' Mr Higgins said of his sibling.</p>

<p>'The happy future that Joe had planned has been cruelly taken away from him.'</p>
