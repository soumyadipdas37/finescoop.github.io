<p>The Wycombe striker was incensed after being 'repeatedly' called a fat water buffalo at last season's League One play-off semi-final between the two sides, saying he felt 'dehumanised' by what he felt was a racist term.</p>

<p>The FA decided that the term was not a racial slur and therefore the Fleetwood staff member was cleared, leaving Akinfenwa disappointed and the PFA furious.</p>

<p>Adebayo Akinfenwa has responded to the FA's final ruling from his complaint of a racial slur</p>

<p>The Wycombe striker was called a fat water buffalo by Fleetwood Town staff member</p>

<p>In a video response the FA's ruling, Akinfenwa said: 'Anyone who follows me on social media knows I use my social media for light-hearted stuff, banter or positive vibes. But I feel this incident, this issue needed more of a personal touch.</p>

<p>'I just received the outcome from the FA on my complaint. Am I disappointed? Yes. Am I surprised? No.</p>

<p>'Before I get started, listen I already know that talking anything race is an uncomfortable conversation. I have said it numerous times we need to have these uncomfortable conversations. I know racial terminology is a trigger but some people but let me say this. I am disappointed with the FA's final findings are.</p>

<p>'See, they basically confirmed that a comment was said, but said that it could be deemed racist or not racist so they aired of the caution of it not being racist. I was told about this comment 24 hours after the comment was said and I got told by white members of my football club. And they waited 24 hours to tell me because they know how I would have reacted if they told me on that day.  </p>

<p>'Therefore, there would have been a bigger backlash I would have got suspended, I would have got done for whatever I would have got done for. And they chose to wait 24 hours because they deemed it as racist.</p>

<p>Akinfenwa said he was disappointed by the decision but not surprised by the FA's ruling</p>

<p>'See, the FA had an opportunity to stamp this out and say that there is no grey areas, wrong is wrong and so it never happens again we are going to follow through. They chose not to.</p>

<p>'On advice of my club, I lodged a complaint, unfortunately I received a 10% increase of racist abuse on my social media platforms and I'm not going on like a bad man, I actually don't care about those people that wanted to send or promote negativity or hate. What I care about is the FA. </p>

<p>'They had an opportunity to stamp this out, to show a united front and say going forward to educate the masses there is certain terminology that cannot be used. They chose not to.</p>

<p>'The FA want us to report incidents, like a father I would say to my kids do the same thing, somebody does you wrong, report it. But if the system time and time again lets you down, what is there for you to do? How are you meant to feel?</p>

<p>But listen, I want to say shoutout and thank you to everyone that showed support and showed love, we've still got to continue to fight, we've got to continue to stay together. I have said my piece.'</p>

<p>The striker's comment follow the PFA's response to the news, as they said: 'The PFA is disappointed that The FA has decided not to carry forward Wycombe Wanderers' complaint of alleged racial abuse from a Fleetwood Town representative toward Adebayo Akinfenwa due to a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>'It is abundantly clear that a white player with a similar stature to Akinfenwa would never be described in the way he was during this incident. Black people have battled dehumanisation for centuries, and the PFA strongly condemns the use of all disparaging remarks that compare Black players to animals.</p>

<p>'This type of hurtful, derogatory language is unacceptable, regardless of intent, and Adebayo showed great courage in coming forward to report this incident, which tarnished what should have been a night of celebration for Wycombe Wanderers.'</p>
