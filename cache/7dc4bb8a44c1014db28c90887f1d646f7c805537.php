<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fulham have confirmed the capture of winger Ademola Lookman on loan from RB Leipzig.</p>

<p>Lookman will join the Cottagers on an initial loan deal for a fee of around £2million and has sealed a return to the Premier League following his £22.5m move from Everton to Germany last summer.</p>

<p>Winger Lookman, 22, said: 'I'm glad to have it over the line and done now. I'm glad I can be here to help the team.</p>

<p>Fulham have completed the season-long loan signing of Ademola Lookman from RB Leipzig</p>

<p>Former Everton forward Lookman returns to the Premier League a year after joining Leipzig</p>

<p>'After the conversations I had with Scott Parker, I got a great feeling, that's the working relationship I want to have. He's young and hungry and I'm young and hungry as well so it's a good match.'</p>

<p>Fulham are braced for a busy few days ahead of the closure of the transfer market on Monday and after starting the season with three successive league defeats.</p>

<p>They are among the clubs keen on Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek who could leave Stamford Bridge on loan.</p>

<p>Aston Villa's capture of Ross Barkley has now ruled out Villa Park as a potential destination for Loftus-Cheek due to Premier League loan rules.</p>

<p>West Ham are also interested in Loftus-Cheek while Southampton anticipate his wages will be out of their reach.</p>

<p>Lookman has been restricted to mainly substitute appearances since his move to Germany</p>

<p>Fulham are among the club interested in Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek</p>

<p>The Cottagers are also desperate for central defensive reinforcements after shipping 10 goals in those three defeats.</p>

<p>After apologising for Fulham's 3-0 home loss to Aston Villa, Fulham's director of football Tony Khan said: 'We've looked to add centre-backs since [the play-off final at] Wembley.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry we haven't yet as two got Covid and we lost a free we thought was close and had another issue with a fourth centre-back. I promise players in and better efforts from this squad.'</p>

<p>Sassuolo's Brazilian defender Marlon is understood to have failed the medical.</p>

<p>Fulham, along with West Ham, are also understood to have considered Lyon's Joachim Andersen though Torino, managed by his old Sampdoria coach Marco Giampaolo, are favourites to sign the Danish defender. </p>
