<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Year 12 students at a New South Wales school have swapped Muck Up Day antics for a charity fundraiser in the wake of disturbing 'challenges' being exposed at some of the nation's most elite schools.</p>

<p>HSC students at Mackillop Catholic College on the Central Coast have raised $1500 for the Starlight Foundation.</p>

<p>Students dressed up in costumes and collected donations in exchange for performing harmless activities, including rafting on the school dam.</p>

<p>School captain Ryley Small said despite the coronavirus pandemic making their final year of schooling difficult, his cohort wanted to help those doing it even tougher.</p>

<p>HSC students at Mackillop Catholic College on the Central Coast raised $1500 for the Starlight Foundation by dressing up in costumes and collecting donations in exchange for offering fun activities</p>

<p>School captain Ryley Small said that despite the coronavirus pandemic making their final year of schooling difficult, his cohort wanted to help those doing it even tougher</p>

<p>Activities to raise money included rafting across the school dam (pictured)  </p>

<p>'We wanted to give to a children's foundation because some students might not have the opportunity to have a charity day themselves or the opportunity to graduate,' he told The Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>Principal Debra Ferguson praised her students for helping those less fortunate instead of taking part in the mayhem of a traditional 'Muck Up Day'.</p>

<p>The fundraising comes just days after elite schools around the state were exposed for vile end of year pranks and challenges. </p>

<p>Leaving students at Merewether High School in Newcastle, north of Sydney, were challenged to send a sexual abuse survivor - who was abused from the age of four to 10 - a message 'defending paedophiles' to score points in the hunt. </p>

<p>An 18-year-old girl, who Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to name, became the victim of one of the challenges on Wednesday night when she began receiving unsolicited messages from boys she hardly knew defending paedophilia</p>

<p>One of the boys who participated messaged the teenage sexual abuse survivor late on Wednesday night to say: 'I really don't think paedophiles are that bad.' </p>

<p>When she questioned the message, the boy added: 'My uncle was one and I think he's a good bloke. Is there anything wrong with that?</p>

<p>'Everyone is human. We are all the same, black, white, pedo, not pedo.'</p>

<p>The young woman, who can't be identified, later learned the messages were sent to earn points for the selective school's muck-up day scavenger hunt. </p>

<p>The New South Wales Department of Education told Daily Mail Australia he was barred from graduating with his peers after the school learned of the incident. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the elite Shore School on Sydney's lower north shore was forced to go into damage control last week after a document detailing a muck up day scavenger hunt circulated among Year 12 students was leaked to the public.</p>

<p>Titled the 'Triwizard Shorenament,' students at the $33,000-per-year school were encouraged to participate in a series of activities such as spitting on a homeless man, breaking into Taronga Zoo and taking drugs. </p>

<p>The 'rule book' - detailed by students in a PDF documents - reveals plans to meet at a park on the lower north shore on the night before the traditional celebrations.</p>

<p>Year 12 students would be split into teams of five or six before carrying out a series of tasks to gain the most points.</p>

<p>Some challenges are illegal, such as 'snort a line' (of cocaine) or 'rip a cone on the Harbour Bridge' (smoke cannabis out of a bong).</p>

<p>The list of challenges also denigrates women, urging students to have sex with a woman over 80kg or hook up with an unattractive women deemed '3/10 or lower' </p>

<p>Others dare students to 'break into Taronga Zoo', 'spit on a homeless man', and 'sh** on a train'.</p>

<p>Some involve assaulting total strangers by hitting them in the genitals while they are walking past.</p>

<p>Instructions written into the rule book advise students they must document their completed tasks on Instagram.</p>

<p>But they are also warned not to upload any potentially incriminating evidence of illegal behaviour including 'inappropriate or sexual advances'.</p>
