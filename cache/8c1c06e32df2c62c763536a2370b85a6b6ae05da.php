<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thiago Silva finalised his shock move to Premier League giants Chelsea on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain on Friday, becoming the latest Brazilian to test his talents in the English top-flight. </p>

<p>The Brazilian defender is widely-regarded as one of the top centre-halves in world football and is part of a £200million summer overhaul by Blues boss Frank Lampard.</p>

<p>While the jury will remain out on the 35-year-old in England for now, history has shown some of his compatriots to revolutionise their sides while others are truly forgettable. </p>

<p>Sportsmail runs through the best - and the worst - Premier League players originating from the football-mad South American country...</p>

<p>Chelsea have bolstered their defensive ranks by completing the free transfer of Thiago Silva</p>

<ol start="10">
<li>Lucas Leiva - Liverpool</li>
</ol>

<p>For all the Samba skills that are normally associated with Brazilian players, ex-Liverpool man Lucas Leiva was the opposite of the classic mould.</p>

<p>Lucas was an understated figure at Anfield for a decade due to his hard-working mentality and his high success rate in the tackle. In fact, he had the highest tackle-per game ratio of any player between 2010 and 2016. </p>

<p>While other players are flashier and made more of a difference going forward, Lucas still holds the record for the most Premier League appearances by a Brazilian player.  </p>

<ol start="9">
<li><p>David Luiz - Arsenal and Chelsea</p>

<p>Silva will have to compete with Arsenal defender David Luiz as the best Brazilian centre-half to grace the Premier League.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>While the 33-year-old certainly has a defensive error in him, his wide range of passing makes him one of the more unique centre-backs in England at the moment. </p>

<p>Let's not forget Luiz's trophy record too. He was a key part of Antonio Conte's Chelsea side that dominated the Premier League in the 2016-17 season, while he also also picked up countless domestic honours in England. </p>

<p>As he approaches 200 Premier League appearances for the London rivals, Mikel Arteta will be hoping there is at least one more good season left in Luiz.  </p>

<p>David Luiz can be defensively inept at times - but the Arsenal man does have his moments</p>

<ol start="8">
<li>Fernandinho - Manchester City </li>
</ol>

<p>For every successful attacking line-up, you need a stop-gap in the midfield. Fernandinho's role at Manchester City has complimented the glitz and glamour of Sergio Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva going forward in recent years.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old has made 224 top-flight appearances since moving to the Etihad Stadium in 2013 and has helped City to win three Premier League titles. His impact has been invaluable.</p>

<p>Manager Pep Guardiola has even said Fernandinho is capable of playing 10 different positions on the pitch, which is testament to the Brazilian's versatility and all-round game.  </p>

<p>Fernandinho has been a mainstay in the Manchester City team and has won three league titles</p>

<ol start="7">
<li>Philippe Coutinho - Liverpool</li>
</ol>

<p>Rule number one as a defender when playing against Philippe Coutinho: don't let him cut inside on his right foot from the left-hand side.</p>

<p>The ex-Liverpool man was a steal for the Reds when he moved to Anfield for just £8.5m in 2013. The midfielder dazzled Premier League fans across the world with his intricate feet movement and link-up play. </p>

<p>Coutinho is currently the highest Brazilian assist-maker in the top-flight, with 35 to his name over his five years in Merseyside. He also had an eye for scoring too, as he netted 20 goals in his final 45 Premier League matches before sealing a £145m move to Barcelona in 2018.  </p>

<p>Philippe Coutinho was the master of cutting in on his right and finding the opposite corner</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Juninho - Middlesbrough</li>
</ol>

<p>Loads of Brazilian players have made a positive impact in the Premier League over the years... but arguably none more so than Juninho at Middlesbrough. </p>

<p>The tricky midfielder was given the nickname 'The Little Fella' on Teeside as the 5ft 5in Brazilian rang rings around defences for the north east club. </p>

<p>Juninho scored 12 goals in the 1996-97 Premier League season but could not stop Boro from getting relegated to Division One. He moved to Atletico Madrid that summer before making a dramatic return to the Riverside Stadium a year later.</p>

<p>Then two years after moving back to Brazil in 2000, he delighted Boro fans again by having a third stint at Middlesbrough and scored eight Premier League goals in his final top-flight season in 2003-04. A true cult-hero. </p>

<p>Juninho was given the nickname 'The Little Fella' during three stints at Middlesbrough</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Ederson - Manchester City</li>
</ol>

<p>When Pep Guardiola arrived at Manchester City, he knew he needed a goalkeeper who was just as good at playing out from the back as he was keeping the ball out the net.</p>

<p>Joe Hart was axed and Claudio Bravo was a defensive liability meaning the Spanish coach had to fork out £35m to capture Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson from Benfica. In retrospect, it was an absolute bargain.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old is so good at recycling the ball with his feet that there are wide-spread claims he would do a decent job in City's midfield. </p>

<p>Ederson was named in the PFA Team of the Year in the 2018-19 season, while he also won the Golden Glove last term for the most clean sheets ahead of Burnley's Nick Pope. </p>

<p>Ederson has proven to be so good with his feet that he could even turn out in midfield for City</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Willian - Arsenal and Chelsea</li>
</ol>

<p>Brazilian winger Willian has been one of the more consistent Brazilians playing in the top-flight over the last few years. </p>

<p>The 32-year-old winger has scored double digit goal tallies in all competitions for Chelsea in five out of the last six seasons, with his pace and shot power a nightmare for Premier League defenders. </p>

<p>His free transfer to Arsenal this summer still shows he is highly-rated in England, with Mikel Arteta even suggesting he could have a central midfield role in his side this season. </p>

<p>Ex-Chelsea winger Willian has been one of the most consistent Brazilians in the top-flight</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Alisson - Liverpool</li>
</ol>

<p>Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson has been a key part of Jurgen Klopp side's success in recent seasons. Since his arrival at Anfield in 2018, the Reds have conceded the fewest goals in the top-fight for two seasons in a row. </p>

<p>The shot stopper is able to pick out a pass from anywhere on the pitch, much likee Ederson, while he has saved Liverpool so many times with his excellent reflexes and judgement calls. </p>

<p>The Alisson vs Ederson rivalry next season will be an exciting one to watch.  </p>

<p>Alisson has shared awards with fellow Brazilian Ederson, with their rivalry set to continue</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Roberto Firmino - Liverpool </li>
</ol>

<p>'Mo Salah, world class, but not every day. Sadio Mane, world class, but not every day. Roberto Firmino, world class, pretty much every day,' claimed Liverpool boss Klopp.</p>

<p>That is how important the Brazilian forward is to the epic front three that the Reds currently possess. </p>

<p>Firmino is currently the highest-scoring Brazilian player in top-flight history with 57 goals, but he also boasts an incredible 40 assists too.</p>

<p>The current Premier League champions have several top-class stars, but Firmino is the one who knits them all together.  </p>

<p>Roberto Firmino is currently the record Brazilian goalscorer in Premier League history</p>

<ol>
<li>Gilberto Silva - Arsenal </li>
</ol>

<p>The Brazilian midfielder arrived at Arsenal as a World Cup winner but nobody knew the effect he was going to have on the Gunners' midfield. </p>

<p>Known as the 'Invisible Wall' back in Brazil, Gilberto formed a devastating partnership with Patrick Vieira, as the north Londoners won the 2003-04 Premier League title without losing a single game. </p>

<p>Gilberto had everything you wanted in a midfielder - a high pass completion rate, defensive astuteness and the ability to affect matters in the opposition penalty area. </p>

<p>He even managed to net 10 Premier League goals in the 2006-07 top-flight season, despite being the deepest midfield option in Arsene Wenger's side. </p>

<p>Gilberto Silva was the perfect midfielder who could both defend and score goals for Arsenal</p>

<p>And what about some of the worst...</p>

<p>Roque Junior - Leeds United</p>

<p>Centre back Roque Junior arrived on loan at Elland Road in 2003 to much excitement. The World Cup winner was highly-rated and was touted as the man to fix Leeds' leaky defence.</p>

<p>In fact, he did the opposite. The defender was sent off on his home debut against Birmingham City, as the Whites conceded 25 goals in his first seven games at the heart of the back four. </p>

<p>Leeds were relegated in Roque Junior's only season in the top-flight, with the defender struggling to reach the top level for the rest of his career.  </p>

<p>Sent off and conceding 25 goals in seven games - Roque Junior was a disaster at Leeds</p>

<p>Kleberson  - Manchester United</p>

<p>Like Roque Junior, midfielder Kleberson had impressed at the triumphant 2002 FIFA World Cup with Brazil and was touted as a future star by some of Europe's top clubs.</p>

<p>Manchester United beat the likes of Barcelona, Celtic and Newcastle to the midfielder's signature in 2003. However, his time at Old Trafford never really took off, owing to a clear lack of quality on the Premier League stage. </p>

<p>Kleberson made just 20 appearances for Sir Alex Ferguson's side over two seasons, before being carted off to Besiktas in 2005.  </p>

<p>World Cup winner Kleberson showed very little talent during his time at Manchester United</p>

<p>Andre Santos - Arsenal </p>

<p>In the 2011 summer transfer window, Wenger made some astute deadline day signings such as Arteta and Per Mertesacker. </p>

<p>The legendary French boss, however, did not do himself any favours by landing Brazilian left back Andre Santos for around £6m from Fenerbahce. </p>

<p>The left back showed a complete ignorance to defending and was often caught too high-up the pitch, leaving the Gunners open to several counter attacks.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he riled the Arsenal faithful when he chose to swap shirts with ex-Arsenal captain Robin van Persie when they were losing at half-time to the Dutchman's new employers Manchester United.  </p>

<p>Andre Santos did remarkably little defending at Arsenal despite being a left back by trade</p>
