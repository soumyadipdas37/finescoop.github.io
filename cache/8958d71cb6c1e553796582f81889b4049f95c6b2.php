<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Santa will be interacting with children and their families over Zoom this Christmas as the pandemic shuts his Australian grottos.</p>

<p>Rather than visiting the man in red at shopping centres, families will be able to bring him into the safety and comfort of their own home online. </p>

<p>Zoom Santa links will be offered to those who book a spot online, but the 12-minute one-on-one sessions cost $199 and video recordings are available. </p>

<p>Scroll down for video </p>

<p>For the first time due to the coronavirus crisis, Santa will be interacting with children and their families over Zoom</p>

<p>The initiative comes from Straight Down The Line Promotions, which has been providing Santas for 25 years across Australia for a whole range of memorable experiences.</p>

<p>Numbers are limited so families should book their Zoom chat with Santa via the Zoom Santa website or Facebook page. </p>

<p>Shopping centres will also have the chance to have Santa at the centre in a COVID-safe environment by streaming him live.  </p>

<p>Santa will be speaking directly to excited children from his workshop at the North Pole, offering a magical experience the whole family will be talking about for years to come</p>

<p>Children will have the opportunity to interact with the big man himself in shopping centres through a webcam, microphone and large screen TV, as well as have their photo taken via the screen. </p>

<p>Straight Down the Line Promotions will provide all electronics including the TV Screen, audio, webcam and access to Santa of course, shopping centres only need to provide WIFI.  </p>

<p>Shopping centre management teams are also urged to line up their Santa chats to avoid missing out.</p>
