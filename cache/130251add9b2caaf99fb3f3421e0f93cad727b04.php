<p>They're back! Production on The Last Duel was shut down in March as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc on the film industry, but filming resumed in Ireland on Monday as Jodie Comer was spotted on set</p>

<p>Jodie was a far cry from her most famous role as Villanelle in Killing Eve, dressed in a pink velvet gown and corset.</p>

<p>Her blonde hair was styled into elaborate braids for the day's filming.</p>

<p>As she carefully hitched up her long robes to walk to set, Jodie wore a face visor, while crew members escorting her were in masks.</p>

<p>Matt was also seen in his visor, teamed with bronze robes. The Hollywood star looked delighted to be back filming, grinning and waving at the huge crowd of fans who had gathered to catch a glimpse of the stars.</p>

<p>Adapted from Eric Jager's book of the same name, it follows the true story of Jean de Carrouges (Damon), a 14th century knight who embarks on a fight to the death with former friend Jacques Le Gris (Driver) after accusing him of raping his wife. </p>
