<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Denmark, Italy and mainland Greece are at risk of being added to the quarantine list this week following a rise in coronavirus infections. </p>

<p>Figures show Denmark's cumulative number of cases over seven days – closely watched by Downing Street – is now at 28.7 infections per 100,000 people. </p>

<p>This is well over the Government's quarantine threshold of 20 but less than United Kingdom's own rate of 31.5. </p>

<p>Denmark is at risk of being added to the quarantine list this week following a rise in coronavirus infections.</p>

<p>Italy yesterday logged 16.5 cases per 100,000 residents and Greece 15.4. </p>

<p>This puts all three nations in the amber zone – places at risk of being added to the red list of countries from which arrivals must self-isolate for 14 days. </p>

<p>Insiders say ministers could hold off on imposing blanket restrictions on Italy but may insist on quarantining arrivals from Sicily, which has seen a spike in infections. </p>

<p>Officials from the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which monitors local outbreaks, will brief ministers later in the week. </p>

<p>The Department for Transport usually announces new additions to the quarantine list on Thursday evening, giving travellers until 4am on Saturday to return. </p>

<p>The addition of Italy and mainland Greece would cause chaos for tens of thousands of Britons abroad and cap off a summer of misery for struggling airlines. </p>

<p>The DfT has already imposed quarantine restrictions on seven Greek islands but has held off from taking action on the mainland. </p>

<p>Greece is in the amber zone, meaning it is at risk of being added to the red list of countries from which arrivals must self-isolate for 14 days</p>

<p>Last week ministers re-added Portugal to the quarantine list, wrecking the travel plans of 35,000 British holidaymakers. </p>

<p>Aviation bosses are desperate for ministers to end the 'quarantine roulette' and have backed the Daily Mail's campaign for a virus testing regime. </p>

<p>A DfT spokesman said: 'We keep the data for all countries and territories under constant review and update our exemptions list with any changes on a regular basis.'</p>
