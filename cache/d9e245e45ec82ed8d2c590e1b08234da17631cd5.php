<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A local council has been left embarrassed after images of a newly-installed child safety gate showed how completely useless it is. </p>

<p>The gate, which cost $1,232, was installed at Windsor Siding Park near Prahran and St Kilda East in Melbourne as part of a $300,000 upgrade by Stonnington Council.</p>

<p>An image of the gate shows it placed next to evenly spaced wooden stakes which revealed the awkward blunder.</p>

<p>The gaps in the makeshift fence mean children can easily escape the playground even if the safety gate is locked. </p>

<p>The gate which cost $1,232 was installed at Windsor Siding Park in Melbourne as part of a $300,000 upgrade by Stonnington Council </p>

<p>Stonnington Council spokesman Jim Carden said the gate looked 'odd' and the issue will be rectified. </p>

<p>'Obviously the gaps in the adjoining ''fence'' would appear to make the gate a bit redundant, so we have been looking at how to tidy it up without losing what is a nice design,' he said. </p>

<p>'So we are just adding some plants to fill in the gaps.'</p>

<p>Ratepayers Stonnington president Dean Hurlston said that council workers should have spotted the gate's uselessness immediately. </p>

<p>'Surely council staff or contractors can see the glaring error of judgment,' he told Herald Sun.</p>

<p>'It's another example of council being out of touch with responsible spending and execution of projects.</p>

<p>'It's a good concept which has totally failed upon delivery.'</p>
