<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former teen beauty queen claims Ghislaine Maxwell tried to recruit her as a masseuse for Jeffrey Epstein while she was working out at a Florida gym when she was just 14.  </p>

<p>Molly Skye Brown, now 42, went to the FBI to tell her tale of meeting Maxwell, Epstein's alleged madam, in 1992, when she was still in high school.  </p>

<p>She said the encounter took place at a gym inside a childcare facility in Palm Beach, near the billionaire pedophile's mansion, where she had a part time job that gave her a free membership to the workout facility. </p>

<p>'I was 14, I was starting to get more into modeling, acting, singing and pageants with the expectation of making some scholarship money or grant money to further my education,' Brown told The Sun.   </p>

<p>'I was on the elliptical machine working out, which is by the front window. I was half-naked, a young girl with an exercise outfit on, showing my body. I saw Maxwell walk by and she stopped. I was the only one in there.' </p>

<p>Former teen beauty queen Molly Skye Brown (pictured) claims Ghislaine Maxwell tried to recruit her for Jeffrey Epstein while she was working out at a Florida gym when she was just 14</p>

<p>Brown, now 42, said she reported Maxwell to the FBI last year - nearly 27 years after their encounter at a gym in Palm Beach</p>

<p>Brown continued: 'She looked me up and down, then came into the gym, walked to the front counter and I could hear her say: "I'm not going to be long, I just want to talk to this girl."'</p>

<p>She said Maxwell then walked up to her and handed her a business card.  </p>

<p>'She walks towards me and hands me her business card. She introduced herself, said she was a modeling scout and asked: Do I do any modeling? I said I did,' Brown recounted.</p>

<p>'She said: "Well, you have the look, how old are you?" I told her my age and she said: "Oh my God, you look so much older, you could easily pass for 18."'</p>

<p>Brown claimed that Maxwell went on to offer her a masseuse job and promised that she could help the teen get a modeling contract from Victoria's Secret. </p>

<p>But Brown was apprehensive from the start, since she suffered from congenital hip dysplasia and knew she wouldn't be able to walk as a model, The Sun reported.  </p>

<p>'Maxwell painted a picture of international traveling, modeling, massages and opportunities with Victoria's Secret,' Brown said. </p>

<p>'It was going in one ear and out the other.' </p>

<p>Maxwell is currently behind bars on charges she  helped groom dozens of young girls for Epstein (pictured together in 2005)</p>

<p>'I've had reconstructive surgery, but my knees are dislocated, I limp and I've already been told by professional agencies that I was never catwalk modeling material,' she said.</p>

<p>'I told Maxwell I really preferred acting, singing and musical theater. She said: "Well, if you change your mind, I have a lot of modeling opportunities."' </p>

<p>Nearly 30 years later, Brown sees the experience in a whole new light as Maxwell sits behind bars awaiting trial on charges she helped groom dozens of young girls for Epstein. </p>

<p>'She was just a predator prowling the streets I have no doubt. I've now had others tell me that I'm exactly the type. I fit the bill perfectly,' Brown told the Sun.</p>

<p>She said that she later heard stories about Maxwell prowling around Orlando's Altamonte Mall making similar promises to other young girls.  </p>

<p>'Another girlfriend of mine told me that Ghislaine used to come up to scout up there. She'd be roaming the shops, handing out her card. It happened regularly,' Brown said.   </p>

<p>This is a developing story.</p>
