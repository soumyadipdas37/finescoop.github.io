<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tennis star Andy Murray is urging officials to consider renaming Melbourne's Margaret Court Arena over the Australian's anti-gay stance.</p>

<p>Court once praised South Africa's apartheid system, said 'tennis is full of lesbians' and described transgender children as 'the work of the devil'.  </p>

<p>British three-time Grand Slam champion Murray says he doesn't think the tennis veteran's values align with the sport.</p>

<p>'She has obviously offended and upset a lot of people over the years,' said Murray in an interview with Pridelife.com. </p>

<p>Tennis star Andy Murray (pictured with wife Kim Sears) is urging officials to consider renaming Melbourne's Margaret Court Arena over the Australian's anti-gay stance</p>

<p>'I think the players certainly have spoken up, which is a positive thing.</p>

<p>'As far as renaming the venue. I think that yes, it's something the sport should consider.'</p>

<p>Murray, who is a five-time runner-up at the Australian Open, said her opinions are drawing attention away from the game.</p>

<p>'When you get to the Australian Open you want to concentrate on the tennis. Court's views detract from that,' said Murray.'</p>

<p>Margaret Court (pictured right with husband Barry) once praised South Africa's apartheid system, said 'tennis is full of lesbians' and described transgender children as 'the work of the devil'</p>

<p>'I don't know who makes the final decision on that but I don't think her values are what tennis stands for.'</p>

<p>Murray's comments follow calls from WTA founder Billie Jean King to remove Court's name from one of the main stadiums at the Australian Open's Melbourne Park venue.</p>

<p>A number of other senior figures in the tennis world have also criticised Court over her conservative views.</p>

<p>Margaret Court (pictured in the 1960s) remains one of the greatest tennis players of all time after winning a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles</p>

<p>Court, who won a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles, has become a divisive figure in tennis, and especially at the Australian Open.</p>

<p>At the tournament in January, Tennis Australia held a low-key ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of her 1970 calendar-year Grand Slam.</p>

<p>Officials noted her views had 'demeaned and hurt many in our community'.</p>

<p>Murray said her reception from the public was 'lukewarm.'  </p>

<p>There are growing calls to rename Melbourne's Margaret Court Arena (pictured) over the tennis veteran's controversial views on homosexuality and race</p>

<p>At the same tournament, American greats John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova were reprimanded for an on court protest.</p>

<p>They unfurled a banner calling for Margaret Court Arena to be renamed after Evonne Goolagong, the three-time Australian Open winner. </p>

<p>In retirement, Court, now a devoutly Christian church pastor and based in Perth, Western Australia, has often attracted controversy over her comments on race and homosexuality.  </p>
