<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Embattled ex-Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale has announced he is taking time away from his role in the election after he was involuntarily committed to a hospital this week amid allegations of abuse.  </p>

<p>'I am stepping away from my company and any role in the campaign for the immediate future to focus on my family and get help dealing with the overwhelming stress,' Parscale told Politico in a statement on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>It comes days after the 44-year-old was hospitalized after reportedly barricading himself inside his Fort Lauderdale home with a gun.</p>

<p>Police were called to the home after his wife Candice dialed 911 and said her husband was threatening to harm himself Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>According to police reports, she also told cops Parscale had been violent with her and she was seen with 'large sized contusions' on her body. </p>

<p>Brad Parscale on Wednesday announced he is taking time away from his role in the election</p>

<p>Embattled ex-Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale allegedly threatened to shoot himself and others on multiple occasions in the weeks before police stormed his Florida mansion on Sunday afternoon, according to a police petition seeking permission to temporarily confiscate a small arsenal of firearms from his home.

<p>Candice on Wednesday denied the abuse claiming her comments had been 'misconstrued.'</p>

<p>'The statements I made on Sunday have been misconstrued, let it be clear my husband was not violent towards me that day or any day prior,' she said in a statement. </p>

<p>Fort Lauderdale police had filed a petition seeking permission to confiscate a cache of firearms discovered at Parscale's home during the episode.</p>

<p>The petition revealed a bevy of alarming allegations about Parscale's heavy drinking, physical assaults on his wife Candace, and threats to harm himself and others - painting a portrait of a man whose life has spiraled out of control since his Trump campaign demotion in July. </p>

<p>Fort Lauderdale Detective Christopher Carita wrote that Parscale, who stands at 6'8", 'poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to himself or others by having a firearm or any ammunition in his custody or control, or by potentially purchasing, possession, or receiving a firearm or any ammunition'. </p>

<p>DailyMail.com revealed on Monday that Candice Parscale was seen screaming and fleeing her home in just her bikini on Wednesday before officers arrived at the scene. Candace allegedly told police that her husband had shown increasing signs of stress in recent weeks</p>

<p>The claims were alarming enough to convince a Broward County judge to sign off on the temporary confiscation of 10 guns from the demoted Trump aide's home in the upscale Seven Isles neighborhood on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>The petition, first obtained by the Miami Herald, also confirmed several details from the incident that DailyMail.com had already brought to light earlier this week. </p>

<p>Police rushed to Parscale's home just before 4pm on Sunday after a caller reported that he had barricaded himself, fired a gun and was threatening to kill himself, the petition states. </p>

<p>DailyMail.com revealed on Monday that Candice Parscale was seen screaming and fleeing the home in just her bikini, telling a passerby: 'I think my husband just killed himself.' </p>

<p>According to the petition, Candice was standing outside when officers arrived. She told them that her husband had been drinking, was armed and she was worried that he would shoot either her or himself.  </p>

<p>She said that she'd heard a loud bang - presumably a gunshot - after she fled from the home, but said she believed he was still alive because she heard him 'ranting and pacing' inside. </p>

<p>Parscale contacted one of the officers outside the home, who eventually convinced him to come outside unarmed, the petition states. </p>

<p>When he reluctantly emerged, Parscale was shirtless, holding a can of beer, his 'speech was slurred as though he was under the influence of alcohol and he appeared to be crying', an officer wrote in the document.   </p>
