<p>Wedding bells: Earlier this month, Kerry and Ryan shared more details of their romantic Spanish engagement as they appeared on Loose Women</p>

<p>Speaking about telling her brood before getting down on one knee, Ryan explained: 'I thought it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>'Everyone was excited, everyone was on board. It was lovely in that respect. I went to pick the ring with DJ and Heidi. I think Max was asleep at the time.'  </p>

<p>Kerry said she couldn't believe DJ didn't tell her. 'For a six year old, she did really well. Crafty that one, I'll watch out for her!' she laughed. </p>

<p>Sweet: The fitness guru proposed to Kerry last month during a holiday in Spain, with the blessing of her five children - Molly, 18, Lilly, 17, Heidi, 13, Max, 12, and DJ, six</p>

<p>Carol McGiffin then asked Ryan what he would have done if the kids had said no and Ryan revealed: 'If it was the youngest three, I would have brainwashed them with a McDonald's, the older two, harder work.</p>

<p>'But yeah, I don't know really. I get along so well with them all so I kind of knew it was going to work… I'm really happy about it.'</p>

<p>Discussing why this marriage will be different, Kerry said: 'Before, it's always been about a wedding, I don't want a wedding, I want a marriage. Ryan's my partner, my life partner. I feel like this is how it should have been the first time and second… and third time around!.</p>

<p>'The past is the past. Just because I've been married and divorced and I've got five kids with three dads, doesn't mean I don't deserve to be happy… I'm really happy and I'm in love.'  </p>

<p>For Kerry, this will be her fourth marriage. She was previously married to Brian McFadden, 40, Mark Croft, 49, and late ex-husband George Kay.   </p>

<p>In an interview with New Magazine, the couple hinted they could well tie the knot in a Las Vegas wedding. </p>

<p>Showing his apparent aversion to lavish nuptials, Ryan said: 'To me, weddings have always been overrated. I've never been a fan of the big, white wedding. </p>

<p>'I always knew if I was going to do it, I'd want to hop on a plane and do it in Vegas in a chilled-out way.' </p>

<p>Exciting: For Kerry, this will be her fourth marriage. She was previously married to Brian McFadden, 40, Mark Croft, 49, and late ex-husband George Kay</p>
