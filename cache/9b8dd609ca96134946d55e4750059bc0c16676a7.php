<p>Rebecca first showed off her fig plant, saying that she's had trouble keeping it alive during Melbourne's cold winter.</p>

<p>'He's so bloody sad! He's been there a year and was always thriving and amazing but by the end of the Melbourne winter, things just got too cold for him outside and he started loosing his leaves,' she said. </p>

<p>'I'm hoping now that it's spring and it's warmer that he's going to fight back but things aren't looking good. Sorry mate!'  </p>

<p>Fiddle-leaf figs can range in price from $26 for smaller plants to $800 for larger ones.</p>
