<p>The Telecommunications Industry ombudsman fielded 2,000 complaints last financial year after customers were unable to contact their internet provider.</p>

<p>That was up a whopping 1,500 per cent compared to the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>Sudden overseas call centre shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic have been blamed for a sharp rise in Australian internet customer queries going unanswered</p>

<p>The ombudsman's 2019-20 annual report, published on Wednesday, said the crisis had placed unusual pressure on offshore call centres in India and the Philippines from March to June, with many forced to close.</p>

<p>'This led to a rapid increase in the number of complaints from consumers who were unable to contact their provider,' ombudsman Judi Jones wrote.</p>

<p>It flowed on from difficulties arising from the summer bushfires, with complaints about not having a working phone or internet connection jumping by almost 70 per cent year-on-year over January to March.</p>

<p>'The bushfire and flood season highlighted the vulnerability of Australians living in regional, rural, and remote areas,' the ombudsman's department said in a statement.</p>

<p>'For consumers impacted by natural disasters, not being connected to phone and internet meant exclusion from basic services and running a business.'</p>

<p>Overall, 127,151 complaints were referred to the telco ombudsman over the financial year to June 30 - down four per cent from 2018-19.</p>

<p>Mobile service complaints remained steady, but the bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic impacted internet and landline numbers over the final two quarters.</p>

<p>Although internet complaints fell by 0.7 per cent from 2018-19, it was still the most common source of customers' ire and accounted for 33.7 per cent of all complaints.</p>

<p>That rose to 38.6 per cent over the final quarter as locked-down Australians became more dependent on their home internet connections.</p>

<p>The ombudsman said industry, government and regulators had responded, providing temporary financial relief and extra NBN capacity amid 'unprecedented challenges'.</p>

<p>Despite increasingly reliant Australian consumers facing connection frustrations, she praised telcos for largely continuing to deliver services.</p>

<p>'The lessons learnt from the rollout of the NBN over the last three years has galvanised and matured Australia's telecommunications sector,' she said.</p>

<p>'These lessons have strengthened the telco ecosystem with industry, government, regulators, advocates, and ombudsman, each playing a part to ensure continuity of service for consumers in the face of great change.</p>

<p>'But as this year's events have shown us, there is always more work to do.'Â </p>
