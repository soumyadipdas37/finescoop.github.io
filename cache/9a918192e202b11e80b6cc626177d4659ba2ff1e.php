<p>This week author and broadcaster Loyd Grossman checks into our travel Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>He talks about his earliest holiday memory, in New York, his favourite part of the U.S, his top destination in the UK - and more...</p>

<p>EARLIEST HOLIDAY MEMORY?</p>

<p>As a child growing up in America in the 1950s, I'll never forget visiting New York after Thanksgiving one year and seeing the window displays in the big Fifth Avenue department stores.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE PART OF THE U.S?</p>

<p>I grew up in Boston, New England, and love Maine's rocky Atlantic landscape.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE RESTAURANT?</p>

<p>I adore the Minetta Tavern in Greenwich Village. It has the most wonderful 'New York in the 1920s and 1930s' feel and serves amazing hamburgers.</p>

<p>TOP TIPS FOR VISITING THE U.S?</p>

<p>Explore small-town America — you'll find it fascinating. And remember that American coffee can be quite weak — it's why diners offer you endless refills.</p>

<p>MEMORABLE PLACE?</p>

<p>Loyd says that the most memorable place he has ever visited is the South Pacific island of Bora Bora, pictured </p>

<p>The South Pacific island of Bora Bora. I got to go scuba-diving and saw lots of varieties of shark.</p>

<p>They're the most fascinating creatures in the wild.</p>

<p>WHERE DO YOU LIKE IN THE UK?</p>

<p>I've just discovered north Norfolk with its stunning beaches, churches and delicious food. I ate the most amazing crab there.</p>

<p>ANYWHERE ELSE YOU WOULD RECOMMEND?</p>

<p>Gladstone's Library, which is an extraordinary monument to one of our great Prime Ministers, in beautiful North Wales.</p>

<p>DREAM DESTINATION?</p>

<p>Loyd's dream destination? Peru or Ecuador. Pictured is Machu Picchu in Peru </p>

<p>Peru or Ecuador, to see the heartland of South America's ancient civilisation.</p>

<p>A SILVER LINING TO NOT TRAVELLING?</p>

<p>Definitely. It's a chance to remind ourselves just how many wonderful places there are in the UK.</p>

<p>WHERE NEXT?</p>

<p>Sicily — as long as it's not on the quarantined list. </p>
