<p>Family of four: In photos posted to the Good Bones star's Instagram account on Wednesday morning, Starsiak, 35, appeared tired but happy as she cuddled with her newborn daughter, Charlotte Drew</p>

<p>Pint-sized: 'Charlie' weighed 7 lbs., 6 oz., and measured 18.5 inches long, the couple's rep told People</p>

<p>The arrival comes with particular joy after Starsiak spent months documenting her struggles with infertility on social media.  </p>

<p>'When I told [Steve] I was pregnant with Jack, he just started crying. When I told him I was pregnant this time, it was shock,' Mina told People at the time.</p>

<p>While she got pregnant easily the first time around, conceiving baby number two was harder.</p>

<p>Excitement: 'We are just obsessed with our little family and can't wait for Jack to be the best big brother to sweet Charlie,' they said in a statement</p>

<p>'Based on our experience with Jack, by month three of trying, I was like, "This is not going to schedule. This isn’t how it happened the first time. There’s no reason it should be taking this long,"' she said.</p>

<p>She first spoke about struggling to get pregnant in June of last year, taking to Instagram to open up to her fans and friends.</p>

<p>'This nugget came easy but #2 is being far more stubborn!' she wrote, posting a picture of herself with Jack.</p>

<p>'I can’t seem to get my [body's] schedule figured out but I’m rocking ​<?php echo e('@'); ?>avawomen to figure it out for me.​ You just wear this to bed and it measures signals in your body to pinpoint your fertile days. Fingers crossed for #2 soon!'</p>

<p>Shook: 'When I told [Steve] I was pregnant with Jack, he just started crying. When I told him I was pregnant this time, it was shock,' Mina told People at the time</p>

<p>She tried several things to help increase her chances of getting pregnant, and in July 2019 she shared a photo of herself getting acupuncture, with nearly a dozen needles poking out of her stomach.</p>

<p>'For those of you who’ve tried making a baby, it’s whatever works! So this is round 2 of acupuncture,' she wrote at the time.</p>

<p>They soon moved to IVF, but their first round failed. After, they decided to give getting pregnant one more shot before they 'settled with being done.'</p>

<p>Last hurrah: They soon moved to IVF, but their first round failed. After, they decided to give getting pregnant one more shot before they 'settled with being done'</p>

<p>For the last attempt, they tried intrauterine insemination, in which a doctor injected sperm directly into Mina's uterus.</p>

<p>It worked, and now they're a family of four.</p>

<p>'It doesn’t feel real yet. But when we heard the heartbeat, there were so many happy tears,' Mina said after revealing she'd conceived.</p>

<p>Big brother: Mina and Steve already have a son, Jack Richard, who was born in August 2018</p>
