<p>The dramatic decline comes after a drive to encourage patients to eat a healthier diet and take more exercise.</p>

<p>It also occurred despite increasing numbers having pre-diabetes – raised blood sugars which have not reached diabetic levels.</p>

<p>Researchers found the percentage who went on to suffer type 2 diabetes dropped from 8 per cent to 4 per cent between 2000 and 2014.</p>

<p>It is estimated around 5 million people in the UK have pre-diabetes, known as non-diabetic hyperglycaemia. They are usually asymptomatic but will often be clinically obese.</p>

<p>The high levels are linked to Britain having one of the highest obesity rates in western Europe, with two in three adults overweight or obese.</p>

<p>Researchers at The University of Manchester suggest the fall in those developing the full disease is the result of interventions like the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme.</p>

<p>This identifies those at high risk and refers them on to a behaviour change programme encouraging them to eat more healthily and exercise more.</p>

<p>Some patients are also prescribed the drug Metformin, a common treatment for type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>The academics studied data on 148,363 people in the UK with pre- diabetes to see how quickly they developed type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>From 2000 to 2015, 1.6 per cent had developed the illness after a month, 4.2 per cent after six months and 20.4 per cent after four years.</p>

<p>Diagnosis of pre-diabetes became more common over time, rising from 0.07 per cent of the population in 2000 to 1.85 per cent in 2015, said the study in BMJ Open journal.</p>

<p>But fewer converted to type 2 diabetes, with the annual rate falling from 8 per cent in 2000 to 4 per cent in 2014.</p>

<p>Dr Rathi Ravindrarajah, of the university, said: ‘We are not certain why but we suspect it’s good preventative work and changing definitions of non-diabetic hyperglycaemia. This sample is large enough to give a good representation of what is going on.’</p>

<p>There are 3.4million patients with type 2 diabetes in England and around 200,000 new diagnoses every year.</p>

<p>Last week the NHS said thousands of them will be offered a three-month 800-calorie soup-and-shake daily diet in a bid to reverse their condition.</p>
