<p>The bearded man, who rarely shows his face online, started sharing videos on TikTok in January, but has only recently gained traction for his niche cooking methods. </p>

<p>He closed the fryer lid and set it to 180 degrees for seven minutes. When the time was up the ultimate breakfast meal was ready to be eaten.  </p>

<p>'I'm going to have to do this in a few minutes. It looks delicious,' one person wrote underneath his video.</p>

<p>'I tried this this morning! It saved me so much time and I had a nice meal before work! Thank you,' said another. </p>

<p>Air fryers rose to prominence as a way to 'fry' food without submerging it in oil. </p>

<p>A mystery Australian man who goes by 'Air Fryer Guy' has taken the internet by storm with his inventive food experiments using Kmart's popular $89 air fryer (marshmallows pictured)</p>

<p>In some cases the food will become a crispier version of itself, which is what happened to the Subway sandwich, a cob loaf he filled with leftover pasta and mozzarella he put on baking paper.</p>

<p>While other instances saw pink and white marshmallows become a wobbly 'cloud' fused together, Hubba Bubba gum, Starburst and sour worm lollies melt or cookie dough mixture form a cake.</p>

<p>Air Fryer Guy made Ferrero Rocher chocolates wrapped in dough turned out to be bite-sized biscuits, Arnott's Tic Tocs melted to a caramel consistency and corn on the cob became popcorn.</p>

<p>Starburst lollies melted into a syrupy mess when he removed them from the air fryer </p>

<p>Not all of his videos are believable, with many saying his pancake batter attempt - which saw him pour five lots of batter onto baking paper and put it into the fryer - doesn't work</p>

<p>The same was said about his Apple TV remote control being put into the device, only to come out as an Apple Mac. Or his grandfather's watch coming out as his family member's ghost. </p>

<p>Alongside the videos the man creates a 'jingle' to frame what is happening on the screen, singing as he cooks.</p>

<p>Corn on the cob turned into delicious popcorn when it was put into the air fryer (pictured)</p>

<p>Crispy noodles (pictured) made by pouring two-minute noodles into the cooking device was also a popular watch online</p>

<p>Some of his most popular ones are 'The Bacon Song' and 'Where the Smiles are Free'. </p>

<p>'When I first got the air fryer I was kind of scared of it,' he told Fox News. </p>

<p>'The settings and timing were very different to an oven or a microwave. It was almost like a "magical" machine that could do anything. </p>

<p>'I figured that most people would feel the same way, so I started putting random things into it like money, potted plants and an Apple Watch. Just for a laugh.' </p>
