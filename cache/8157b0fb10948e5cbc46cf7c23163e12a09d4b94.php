<p>The 47-year-old chef was spotted cooking up a storm with her current partner Jono Bennett, her ex-husband Matthew Phipps and his new wife Sarah Rich.</p>

<p>Modern family! MasterChef's Poh Ling Yeow (pictured) tended her food stall at Adelaide Showground Farmers' Market on Sunday with her partner Jono Bennett, her ex-husband and his new wife</p>

<p>The former MaserChef star kept warm in black jeans, a green jumper and a colourful scarf.</p>

<p>She completed her comfortable ensemble with her pair of yellow sneakers and wore silver earrings.</p>

<p>At one point, Poh stood off to the side chatting to her ex Matthew and several other shoppers.</p>

<p>Good terms: She was spotted working alongside her ex-husband's wife Sarah Rich and serving customers as they lined up at the stall</p>

<p>Poh and Matthew have remained friends since they split several years ago, and he's now married to her best friend and Jamface business partner, Sarah. </p>

<p>The former couple met in 1990 - at the time both were Mormons - and were married for nine years. </p>

<p>Poh then met Jono in 2009 on the first season of MasterChef. She was a contestant while he was working behind the scenes as a runner.</p>

<p>They started dating after the show's finale, and married five years later in 2014. </p>

<p>Catching up: At one point, Poh stood off to the side chatting to her ex Matthew (left) and several other shoppers</p>

<p>Comfort: Poh's current partner Jono Bennett (pictured) wore blue jeans, a black jumper and a pair of sneakers</p>

<p>In an extraordinary twist, the two couples went into business together and opened their café, Jamface.</p>

<p>Poh has made no secret of the unusual arrangement, saying in multiple interviews that the four of them are adults who manage to make things work.</p>

<p>'He's my ex-husband. She's my best friend. And when we broke up, they got together and it's all dandy. It's actually really good!' she told Mamamia in 2017.</p>

<p>Warm: The former MasterChef star kept warm in black jeans, a green jumper, a colourful scarf and pair of comfortable yellow sneakers</p>
