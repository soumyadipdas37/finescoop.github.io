<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Matt Doherty’s Premier League journey did not begin until he’d spent a year slogging away as a carpet cleaner for his dad, a grounding Tottenham’s new recruit believes has given him the work ethic which caught Jose Mourinho’s eye.</p>

<p>Doherty, a £15m summer signing from Wolves, is living the dream earning big bucks playing in one of the world’s best leagues, European club competitions and representing Ireland.</p>

<p>And it’s not a lifestyle he is going to take for granted given his very unglamorous upbringing while playing part-time for Bohemians back in Ireland.</p>

<p>Matt Doherty has had a journey to the top flight not like many of his professional colleagues</p>

<p>Tottenham's new £15m signing used to clean carpets with his dad in Dublin as a youngster</p>

<p>‘I was working with my dad for the best part of two years and it just gave me a sense of what real work was like,’ said Doherty speaking ahead of Tottenham’s showdown with Newcastle on Sunday.</p>

<p>‘It also showed me the kind of work that I didn’t want to do because of how hard it was, how tough it was going around in the van. Carpet and upholstery cleaning was not easy work.</p>

<p>‘Those two years between 16 and 18, they probably matured me a lot and probably meant that when I did get over [to England] there was never going to be any homesickness or anything like that that I might have had at 16.</p>

<p>‘It was just an opportunity that I knew I had to take with both hands and there was no way I was going to let anything get in the way or stop me from giving it 100 per cent.’</p>

<p>Doherty's time cleaning carpets made him determined to seize his opportunity at Wolves </p>

<p>Little wonder then that during a decade at Molineux Doherty was renowned for his work ethic and no surprise that he’s the type of player who also found himself on Mourinho’s radar.</p>

<p>‘Not many people get to work with a manager like Jose and it was something I was very excited to do,’ said the 28-year-old.</p>

<p>‘As everyone knows, I like to get up and down on the right-hand side and obviously it was a fit for his eye.’</p>

<p>The Irishman feels his work ethic is one characteristic that caught the eye of Jose Mourinho</p>

<p>He has traded one Portuguese boss for another but says Mourinho and Nuno share qualities</p>

<p>Doherty has traded in one Portuguese boss - Nuno Espirito Santo - for another and he can see similarities between the two men.</p>

<p>‘They’re similar in some ways,’ he said. ‘Obviously, Nuno was second-choice keeper at Porto when Jose was the manager so he obviously learned a lot from working with him. They do have some things in common but shape-wise it’s different, there are things they do differently on a personal level also.’</p>

<p>And Doherty also says the occasionally grumpy Mourinho the public see bears no relation to the Mourinho he works with on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>Doherty has settled in quickly at Tottenham as he looks to take the next step in his career</p>

<p>‘He’s even better because he has that relationship with players on a personal level; he has a great sense of humour, he can joke around with players, he cares a lot for his players. For sure he has been better than I expected.’</p>

<p>Doherty has settled in quickly at Tottenham Stadium where, given the Irishman’s background, the club’s cleaners had better be on their guard.</p>

<p>He joked: ‘I’m looking at the carpets thinking, “There’s a stain there, a stain there, I could get that out”.’</p>
