<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>As the Government deadline for striking a Brexit deal with the EU approaches next month, I hear that old bruiser Nigel Farage is preparing for a possible political return to the fray.</p>

<p>Only last year the Brexit Party won the European elections and became the largest group in the European Parliament, with 26 MEPs. </p>

<p>Those MEPs lost their jobs, of course, when we left the EU on January 31.</p>

<p>As the Government deadline for striking a Brexit deal with the EU approaches next month, I hear that old bruiser Nigel Farage is preparing for a possible political return to the fray</p>

<p>But they have not gone away. Richard Tice, the former chairman of the party, declared last week on a WhatsApp group they have all joined: 'We are the country's insurance policy.' </p>

<p>He explained that if there is any hint of a sell-out on EU access to British fishing waters, the party will relaunch. </p>

<p>A source close to Farage added ominously: 'We are sleeping, not extinct.'</p>

<p>And the platform they will fight on? There's the Brexit deal, but private polling by the party also shows members are almost unanimously opposed to current lockdown measures.</p>

<p> A source close to Farage added ominously: 'We are sleeping, not extinct'</p>

<p>There is talk of fielding a candidate in the mayoral election next year in London on an anti-lockdown ticket. </p>

<p>It may prove popular, as large parts of Central London resemble a ghost town. </p>

<p>Ann Widdecombe, who was a Brexit Party MEP, says the crackdown is excessive: 'We have not got a proportionate response.'</p>

<p> A devastating take on Baroness Harding, head of the Covid test-and-trace system, from 'Beast of Bolsover' Dennis Skinner, 88, who lost his Commons seat last year: 'Some are born mediocre, some achieve mediocrity and some have mediocrity thrust upon 'em. She's been put to the test and now there's NO trace.' </p>

<p> How Javid caught out Campbell</p>

<p>Too-clever-by-half Alastair Campbell, who was Tony Blair's spin doctor, tweeted a photo of the Tory benches last week showing nine 'all white men'.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, Tory MP Sajid Javid, the first ethnic minority Chancellor, posted a photo of the front bench showing his successor Rishi Sunak, whose parents are of Indian origin; Home Secretary Priti Patel, whose parents were Ugandan Asians; and Attorney General Suella Braverman, whose parents are also of Indian origin.</p>

<p>At Prime Minister's Questions, the Northern Ireland DUP MP Sammy Wilson challenged the logic of the Government scientists' warning that there could be 50,000 infections a day. </p>

<p>'What is not in dispute is the scare tactics being used.' </p>

<p>Tactics that didn't work on Wilson, who was seen on the London Underground breaking the rules by not wearing a mask.</p>

<p>Bafta's 'woke' rules to prevent the embarrassment of any all-white shortlists at its 2021 film awards require its 8,000 members to take 'unconscious bias training' before casting their votes. </p>

<p>Good luck to the luvvie who has to teach double Oscar-winner and former Labour MP Glenda Jackson how to suck eggs. </p>

<p>Gushing praise for London Mayor Sadiq Khan from Labour leader Keir Starmer: 'My friend Sadiq Khan is an inspiration, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western city and a source of pride for us all. </p>

<p>'We'll never let those who seek to divide us win.' </p>

<p>Hasn't Starmer noticed that Khan's Transport for London is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and that Crossrail is two years behind schedule and £2.8 billion over budget? </p>

<p>Did Dave really win the war?</p>

<p>Biographer Sir Anthony Seldon, who is standing down as vice-chancellor of Buckingham University, is 'captivated' by the diaries of the 'shamelessly disloyal' Sasha Swire. </p>

<p>The wife of ex-Tory MP Hugo Swire, she threw much bile at David Cameron for not putting her husband in the Cabinet when he was PM. </p>

<p>Seldon says: 'I will continue to admire the intelligence and courage of David Cameron but I confess to being disappointed he may or may not have boasted to her [Sasha] of Libya in 2011: "I've just won the war".' </p>

<p>Seldon, who co-wrote Cameron At 10, adds in the New Statesman: 'Great PMs, without exception, have a wisdom and moral seriousness that he never fully acquired.' </p>
