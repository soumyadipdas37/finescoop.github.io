<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Russia's most notorious female gangster and her criminal ring are facing allegations of up to 'three dozen' more murders. </p>

<p>Matriarch mobster Inessa Tarverdieva and three of her relatives were jailed for a total of 76 years in 2018 for a reign of terror which included ten 'horrible and bloody' killings. </p>

<p>Now a new trial has begun over more alleged murders by the so-called Amazon gang which held Russia's Rostov region in fear. </p>

<p>Newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported the new criminal case includes 'three dozen murders', ten robberies and 60 thefts.  </p>

<p>In one of the new cases, two young policemen were allegedly lured to a dental surgery after the gang staged a break in.</p>

<p>The gangsters are accused of shooting sergeant Vladimir Mandrik, 26, and police driver Vasily Kamforin, 22, to steal their Kalashnikov assault rifle and Makarov pistols.</p>

<p>One of the pistols was later used to shoot dead a taxi driver, according to the prosecution.</p>

<p>In another new case the gang shot at two policemen, killing one, in 2013, it is alleged.</p>

<p>Tarverdieva, 52, a former nursery school teacher, her daughter Viktoria, 31, her husband's brother-in-law Sergei Sinelnik and his wife Anastasia, both 33, were all jailed two years ago.   </p>

<p>When she was convicted over 10 'horrible and bloody' murders, Tarverdieva said as she left court in handcuffs: 'The verdict is fair, I won't appeal against it.'</p>

<p>She had schooled her daughter Viktoria in murder, the court was told.</p>

<p>The gang's earlier victims included half a dozen policemen - and her own 12 year old goddaughter Lera Klochko, who was fatally shot through the eye when a burglary went wrong and the girl saw the identity of the criminals.</p>

<p>Tarverdieva, dressed in black to hear her sentence, was compared to US 1930s female mobster 'Ma' Barker.</p>

<p>She earlier appeared in court wearing bright red with Louboutin shoes, and expensive make-up - even though it was banned in the grim detention centre in Rostov-on-Don where she was held.</p>

<p>She was jailed for 21 years in a strict labour colony regime while her daughter Viktoria was sent down for 16 years.</p>

<p>The gang had included the crime queen's lover, Roman Podkopaev - a 36 year old dentist described by a relative as 'weak and obedient' to her.</p>

<p>He died in a 2013 shoot out when the other gang members were arrested and is seen by police as being directly involved in 20 murders.</p>

<p>The family, including younger daughter Anastasiya, now 17, were seen as 'dull and normal', fond of camping trips.</p>

<p>At night they morphed into ruthless killers, the earlier trial was told.</p>

<p>Tarverdieva admitted that the crime family saw murder and robbery like 'going to the office for a day's work', while she also confessed to loathing police, boasting: 'I'm a gangster by nature.'</p>

<p>Killing was a 'means of earning money', she said, before demonstrating her gun handling skills to detectives during a crime reenactment.</p>

<p>Both the middle-class criminal godmother and her dentist partner had good higher education qualifications.</p>

<p>She gave up work in a nursery school and 'switched completely to their robbery and murder business', said a police source.</p>

<p>She carried a knife engraved 'to my beloved Amazon warriors'.</p>

<p>Searches of her family's homes revealed an 'arsenal' of 20 firearms, including automatic rifles, grenades, shotguns, silencers and ammunition, as well as items stolen from their victims.</p>
