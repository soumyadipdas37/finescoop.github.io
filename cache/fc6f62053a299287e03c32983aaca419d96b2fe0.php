<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thiago Silva's agent has slammed former Paris Saint-Germain manager Unai Emery after the defender's move to Chelsea.</p>

<p>Paulo Tonietto has reportedly claimed that the club lost 'two-years' of progress when they appointed Emery back in 2016.</p>

<p>The Spaniard won one Ligue 1 title with the Parisians but failed in the Champions League, most famously when they gave away a 4-0 first leg advantage to Barcelona.</p>

<p>Thiago Silva's agent says Unai Emery's PSG appointment in 2016 set the club back two years</p>

<p>His agent was speaking following the defender's move to Chelsea as a free agent this summer</p>

<p>'PSG lost two years the day they appointed him,' Tonietto told L'Equipe.</p>

<p>'His problem is that he has trouble managing the stars. In Paris, it was the players who solved the situation after Neymar and (Edinson) Cavani clashed on-field over a penalty. When he went to Arsenal, the first player he got angry with was Mesut Ozil</p>

<p>'He's a good coach to play in the Europa League, not the Champions League. The suit was too big for him. He was a terrible coach for PSG.</p>

<p>'If there had been a coach of another calibre during these two years, PSG would have already won the Champions League.' </p>

<p>Tonietto also blamed the 6-1 defeat by Barcelona, in a match known as the Remontada, on Emery.</p>

<p>He said: 'The person foremost responsible for the Remontada is Emery. He put Angel Di Maria on the bench. When he came on, the team played better before the final collapse.</p>

<p>Emery was heavily blamed for PSG's 6-1 Champions League defeat to Barcelona in 2017</p>

<p>Thiago Silva's final game for PSG game in their Champions League final loss to Bayern Munich</p>

<p>'Against Real Madrid in a 3-1 loss in 2018? Emery made bad changes by putting Dani Alves through the middle to bring in Thomas Meunier. At the same time, Zinedine Zidane brought on Marco Asensio, who was decisive.'</p>

<p>In 2018, the club decided not to retain Emery who went on to manage Arsenal in a spell which also did not end well for the Spaniard, who now manages Villarreal.</p>

<p>Under Thomas Tuchel, PSG made the final of this year's Champions League, only to fall 1-0 in the final against Bayern Munich.</p>

<p>Tuchel campaigned for Silva to remain with the French champions but the Brazil international decided not to renew his deal and moved to Chelsea. </p>
