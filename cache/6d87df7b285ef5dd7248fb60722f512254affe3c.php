<p>The firefighter died on Thursday in the San Bernardino National Forest as crews battled the El Dorado Fire.</p>

<p>Authorities say they won't release the name of the firefighter until family members are notified. The cause of the firefighter's death is under investigation, the US Forest Service said in a statement. </p>

<p>'Our deepest sympathies are with the family, friends and fellow firefighters during this time,' Forest Service spokesperson Zach Behrens said. </p>

<p>The fire erupted on September 5 when a couple staged a baby gender reveal at El Dorado Ranch Park at the foot of the San Bernardino Mountains.</p>

<p>Authorities say a smoke-generating pyrotechnic device sparked the blaze after it was set off in a field and quickly ignited dry grass. </p>

<p>The couple frantically tried to use bottled water to extinguish the flames and called 911. </p>

<p>The wildfire has already burned nearly 30 square miles and is about 66 percent contained, according to Cal Fire. The fire has destroyed 10 buildings and damaged six others. </p>

<p>Authorities have not released the identities of the couple, who could face criminal charges and be held liable for the cost of fighting the fire. </p>

<p>It comes as more than 17,000 firefighters continue to battle more than two dozen major wildfires in California. </p>

<p>The blazes are blamed for at least 25 deaths. </p>

<p>Crews continue to battle more than two dozen major fires across California - the most populous US state</p>

<p>A front of humid and rainy weather on Friday aided the efforts of weary emergency crews and brought some relief to a region that has suffered a historically devastating fire season. </p>

<p>The deadly wildfires have raged for weeks due to tinderbox conditions created by high winds, lightning and drought.  </p>

<p>The region still faces a formidable recovery from the fires, which have burned some 3.2 million acres in California since mid-August and another 1.7 million acres in Oregon and Washington state since Labor Day.</p>

<p>Several small towns have largely been incinerated, with thousands of dwellings destroyed and at least 35 lives lost - 26 in California, including the firefighter - eight in Oregon, and one in Washington state. </p>

<p>Thousands of evacuees, especially in Oregon, remained huddled in emergency shelters, mobile trailers and hotel rooms. </p>

<p>The situation was particularly dire in Oregon, a state unaccustomed to wildfires of such magnitude and lacking sufficient resources to deal with them.</p>

<p>Oregon's firefighting force has more than doubled over the past week, with some 6,500 personnel on the fire lines. </p>

<p>CalFire said more than 17,400 firefighters were deployed against 26 fires in the most populous state.</p>
