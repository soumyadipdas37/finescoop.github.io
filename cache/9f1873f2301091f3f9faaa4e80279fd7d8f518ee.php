<p>The latest: 90 Day Fiancé stars Paul Staehle, 37, and Karine Martins, 24, have dropped restraining orders they applied for amid a series of accusations they had this past summer </p>

<p>Staehle in July said in an Instagram Stories clip that the Brazilian beauty had put in for a 'full restraining order' from him and that he was 'not allowed to be around her or my son, within 500 feet of them at all.'</p>

<p>Both traded serious allegations against the other in official documents they filed: Martins said that Staehle had sexually assaulted her and tried to manipulate her by not letting her have her Green Card, US reported.</p>

<p>'I am terrified he will hurt me or hurt my son because I [ran] away from him and I am even afraid to go back to Brazil now because he can go to Brazil and hurt us,' she said in court docs, the outlet reported.</p>

<p>Staehle said Martins had 'assaulted' him and that he suspected her of trying to poison his food with glass. He told the court: 'I previously found glass in my food. I found similar glass shards from an item she broke.'</p>

<p>Where things stand: Martins last month took to Instagram Stories about how she got a protective order against Staehle following a sequence of disturbing instances</p>

<p>Bundle of joy: The couple welcomed son named Pierre Martins Staehle last year </p>

<p>A judge subsequently issued an order keeping Martins at least 500 feet from Staehle amid the problems between the pair.</p>

<p>Staehle also implied on social media that he and Martins were expecting a second son; and that he was working on a home in Brazil and keeping it 'sanitary and baby safe' for the family's sake.</p>

<p>'I have to accept the fact that I will probably never see my wife and son again,' he said on social media earlier this month. 'Or see the birth or ever see my unborn child. That being said I think I am doing what is best staying constructive and busy.'</p>
