<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman threatened to stab a worker at a KFC in California during a screaming rant during which she jumped onto the restaurant counter after she was allegedly refused service for not wearing a mask.</p>

<p>The Kentucky-fried fiasco shows a maskless woman becoming aggressive with a female employee in the KFC which is believed to be in the Fresno area.</p>

<p>Footage of the incident shows the woman then jumping onto the counter where she yells 'Gimme something to f---ing eat! I'm hungry!'</p>

<p>The woman then launches a largely unintelligible rant at a male employee during which she dares him to call the cops.</p>

<p>The unidentified woman also threatens to stab a female worker unless she gets 'something to eat' immediately.</p>

<p>In another video the woman clarifies her order of mashed potatoes and chicken despite staff telling her that she will not be served.</p>

<p>One employee tells the angry woman: 'I can't. I'll get fired.'</p>

<p>The woman continues to shout and scream at staff at the restaurant as they refuse to serve her</p>

<p>Despite the this staff member obviously working at the KFC the woman yells back at him: 'You don't even work here!'</p>

<p>Shortly after the woman kicks over a promotional sign as she walks up to the counter and climbs onto it, says Fox News. </p>

<p>At this point she again demands to be told why she cannot get any food. A staff member tells her that it is because she is not wearing a mask.</p>

<p>The woman is abusive to the worker before she appears to threaten him with aggravation when he gets off work.</p>

<p>Largely ignored by the staff the woman gets off the counter and moves towards the door.</p>

<p>She is offered a spare mask by another customer but the woman then declares that 'she doesn't give a s***' anymore and states that the KFC's kitchen is disgusting.</p>

<p>The woman shouts at staff after they refused to serve her at the restaurant</p>

<p>The angry woman decides to leave the KFC, believed to be in Fresco, after staff refuse to serve her for not wearing a mask</p>

<p>The furious woman climbs onto the counter at the KFC to continue her rant against staff for refusing to serve her</p>

<p>No-one from KFC or Yum! Brands, its parent company, were available for comment on the videos. </p>

<p>The footage was shared to TikTok and Facebook by a woman who said it took place in Fresno.</p>

<p>This is one of several fast-food meltdowns in recent months with most seeming to be due to customers refusing to wear masks. </p>

<p>In a Taco Bell, in Bolivar, Missouri, a mask-free woman shouts at customers, uses racial language and claims to be 'Charlie f*****g Manson's daughter,' when she was denied service. </p>

<p>Similar style outburst have also been reported at McDonald's and Burger King among other places.</p>
