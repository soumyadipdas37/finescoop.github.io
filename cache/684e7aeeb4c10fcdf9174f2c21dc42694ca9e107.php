<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are preparing to finalise agent salary and fees before submitting an official offer to Borussia Dortmund for Jadon Sancho. </p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made the England international his top transfer target this summer to bolster his attacking options, with Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood currently occupying the front three positions. </p>

<p>However, talk of a Sancho move to Old Trafford had gone quiet over the past few weeks, with the Bundesliga club steadfast in their refusal to budge from their valuation of the player, understood to be £108million. </p>

<p>Manchester United are preparing to finalise Jadon Sancho's agent fees before submitting a bid</p>

<p>The England international is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's top transfer target this summer window</p>

<p>Dortmund chief Michael Zorc insisted last month that any chance of United signing their 20-year-old star had dissipated after they missed a deadline to agree a deal for the player. </p>

<p>Sportsmail understands, though, that United are preparing to go back in for Sancho, but will first sort out the salary and fees of intermediaries before approaching Dortmund with an official bid. </p>

<p>Sancho's agent is understood to be Emeka Obasi of the Elite Project Group agency. The agency also looks after the likes of Bukayo Saka, Todd Cantwell and Eddie Nketiah. </p>

<p>Dortmund chief Michael Zorc had said that United's deadline to sign had passed last month</p>

<p>But Sportsmail understands that United are ready to go in for Sancho with an official bid</p>

<p>United remain the frontrunners to sign Sancho this summer, and are looking to strike while the iron is hot after landing Donny van de Beek this week. </p>

<p>The Ajax youngster had been on the radar of a number of high-profile clubs in Europe after starring for the Dutch club in their Champions League run to the semi final last season.</p>

<p>But United have won the race for the attacking midfielder, who sealed a £40m switch to Old Trafford, signing a contract until June 2025 in the process.  </p>
