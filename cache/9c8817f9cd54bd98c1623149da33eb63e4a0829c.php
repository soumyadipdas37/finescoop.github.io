<p>'People can't believe how tight Jason and I are, or how tight I still am with [my daughter] Zoë's mom, how we all relate,' the 56-year-old rock star said in the November edition of Men's Health.</p>

<p>'We just do it because that's what you do. You let love rule, right? I mean, obviously, after a breakup, it's work. It takes some work and time, healing and reflection, et cetera. But as far as Jason and I? Literally the moment we met, we were like, "Oh, yeah. I love this dude."'  </p>

<p>2019 modern family portrait: Despite their 1993 divorce, four-time Grammy winner Lenny Kravitz (2-R) is proud that he's remained close with his ex-wife Lisa Bonet (3-L) as well as her second husband Jason Momoa (L)</p>

<p>The 56-year-old rock star said in the November edition of Men's Health: 'People can't believe how tight Jason and I are, or how tight I still am with [my daughter] Zoë's mom, how we all relate. We just do it because that's what you do. You let love rule, right?'</p>

<p>In his upcoming memoir, Lenny focuses on his early years leading up to his marriage to the 52-year-old former Cosby kid, whom he met in an elevator backstage at a New Edition concert in 1985.</p>

<p>Lisa inspired Kravitz - then known as Romeo Blue - to discover his artistic path in a more authentic way, and she even co-wrote two songs on his 1989 debut record, Let Love Rule.</p>

<p>The Ride rocker called his 31-year-old daughter - currently filming her role as Catwoman in Matt Reeves' The Batman - as 'the most real person I know.'</p>

<p>'Just having two parents who were known in the world. The comparisons. She didn't let any of that hinder her in any way.'</p>

<p>In March as the coronavirus swept the globe, Kravitz left his four-story 1920s townhouse in Paris's upscale 16th Arrondissement to live in an Airstream trailer on the beach at the Bahaman isle of Eleuthera.</p>

<p>The biracial belter later bought a one-room house that she shares with his adopted potcake dogs off the street, Leroy and Jojo.</p>

<p>Lenny noted: 'It's a beautiful thing to really realize what you don't need. If I have to stay here another five months, five years, I'm good.'</p>

<p>Kravitz's strict vegan raw diet comes from the many fruits and vegetables he grows on his farm.</p>

<p>'Soursops are my favorite. Soursop is good for you,' the native New Yorker said in an accompanying Men's Health video.</p>

<p>'As you can see, I'm vegan and primarily raw. I have done extensive raw diets where I eat raw for a year. When I'm here, I like to eat as much food as possible especially in the summer time when you have all of these beautiful fruits growing.</p>

<p>'But then there will be times where I don't take in sugar - not even fruit sugar - and I just eat green. Like sauteed spinach or kale salad. I'm very careful about what I put into my body and how I take care of my body. </p>
