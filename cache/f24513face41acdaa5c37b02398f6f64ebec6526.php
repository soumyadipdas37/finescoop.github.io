<p> A savvy Australian woman has shared a 'game changing' tip for restoring your old, bendable carrots to their juicy orange state with a glass of water</p>

<p>'Do you have some old, bendy carrots sitting in the fridge? Well don't throw them out, they're probably just dehydrated,' she said in the video.</p>

<p>'Pop them in some water for five minutes - yes this does work - pull them out and they will be as good as gold!'</p>

<p>But the amount of time required often varies depending on how weak the carrot is.</p>

<p>The same method can also be used to restore lettuce, celery, spring onion and bok choy to their former glory.</p>

<p>A carrot is a root vegetable often claimed to be the perfect health food.</p>

<p>Carrots' water content ranges from 86 to 95 per cent, and the edible portion consists of around 10 per cent carbs.</p>

<p>Due to this high percentage, this vegetable needs water to last for longer periods of time in the fridge.</p>

<p>When a carrot is placed in water, a process called osmosis takes place in which the fine hairs on the carrot help absorb the water.</p>

<p>The same method can also be used to restore lettuce, celery, spring onion and bok choy</p>

<p>While some TikTok users doubted the hack, others who have tried it confirmed it works very well.</p>

<p>'It does work! Sometimes it helps to peel them a little bit first,' one person said.</p>

<p>'Does work but after a few hours,' another said.</p>

<p>A third added: 'I store mine in water in the fridge - change the water once a week and they last for ages.' </p>

<p>On her TikTok page, Lottie has also shared other helpful videos including how to grow spring onions or shallots</p>

<p>To do this, she says to chop off the ends of the vegetable and leave between two to three centimetres of stem from the roots </p>

<p>To do this, she starts by chopping off the ends of the vegetable and leaving between two to three centimetres of stem from the roots.</p>

<p>Use a rubber band to keep the short stems together and place it in a jar of water and keep it in a sunny spot.</p>

<p>The spring onions will regrow from the stems over time and the same method can be implemented each time.</p>

<p>And vegetables aren't the only thing water can restore - Lottie said rubber hair ties can also be brought back to the original, tight form after being immersed in warm water </p>

<p>'All you need to do is boil the kettle and soak the [hair ties] in water for about ten seconds and they become nice and tight again!' Lottie said.</p>
