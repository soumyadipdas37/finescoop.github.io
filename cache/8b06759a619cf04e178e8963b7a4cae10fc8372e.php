<p>Vogue's career is also taking off with her regular early morning Sunday show on Heart Radio as well as a new job on Channel 4's Steph's Packed Lunch.</p>

<p>She also has a weekly podcast with husband Spencer Matthews, on which the couple debated Vogue's increasing workload in a candid conversation this week.</p>

<p>'So I got a new job this week that I’m very pleased about, I’m joining The Steph Show, and it films up in Leeds, and I’ve never seen someone’s face drop so hard when I told him that I was going to be spending some time in Leeds,' Vogue told her listeners of Spencer's reaction to her new job.</p>

<p>'I want your career to go from strength to strength,' clarified Spencer. 'You put your career first sometimes, which is absolutely fine, as do I a lot of the time, but you, you wouldn’t be deterred for a job if it was spending 5 days in Leeds, and we’ve got two kids at home.' </p>

<p>Vogue hit back with: 'That is absolutely not true, you did the same with Heart, and Spenny gets nervous when I get asked to cover people’s shows in Heart, he gets nervous that I’m going to go in more and more and more and just won’t suit him for me to do that.'</p>

<p>'I did the same with Heart and what happened, you landed a job every single Sunday morning which involves you leaving the house at 4:15am which completely disrupts our Saturday evening sleep,' Spencer told her.</p>

<p>On the one day that we could spend the morning in bed, you are out of the house, and I’m left with the kids, which is fine, love the kids, no problem.'</p>

<p>'Then it gets to the point where literally you’re like “oh my god great we’ve been working so hard, let’s go away for the weekend, oh can’t, Vogue’s radio show” and now she’s taking about spending some time in Leeds every week.'</p>

<p>'I love Leeds but let me touch on the Heart debate there,' continued his wife. 'I get up at 4:15 in the morning and leave at 10 to 5, I’m back in this house by 9:20 in the morning, you’re not left with the kids struggling all day, you’re only here till 20 past 9.'</p>

<p>Spencer at least agreed with that point, laughing: 'Yeah honestly on a Sunday morning I’d probably would sleep till 9 and not get up at 6.'</p>

<p>'How would you possible sleep till 9, we’ve got two babies,' pointed out Vogue. 'Oh yeah, I’m always the one to get up in the morning.'</p>

<p>'You have to pump. If I had two udders attached to me full of delicious milk that required pumping, then I’d get up because I would need to drain my udders,' quipped Spencer.</p>
