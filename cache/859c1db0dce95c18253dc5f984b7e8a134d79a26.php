<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Conor McGregor has been drug-tested by officials on his £3million yacht despite retiring from Mixed Martial Arts earlier this year.</p>

<p>The former two-weight UFC champion is currently in Monaco as he prepares to set off for a 180km voyage to raise awareness of water safety.</p>

<p>However, his preparations were interrupted as he posted to social media that he received an unexpected arrival from USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency) onboard his super yacht.  </p>

<p>Conor McGregor has been drug-tested by officials on his £3million yacht despite retiring</p>

<p>He tweeted: 'What's going on here UFC? USADA have just arrived to my yacht this morning for testing? I've retired guys! </p>

<p>'But go on then, I'll allow them test me. It's all natural here baby! Forever and always, God Bless.</p>

<p>'180km across the Mediterranean Sea tomorrow! LET'S GO!!'</p>

<p>By completing the test, McGregor has left himself available to fight again inside the octagon or boxing ring.</p>

<p>The Irishman also took a shot at his old foe Nate Diaz as he hints at return to the octagon</p>

<p>The Irishman hung up his gloves back in June for the third time in his career despite making an impressive UFC comeback in January as he beat Donald Cerrone in the opening round of their bout at UFC 246.</p>

<p>Another UFC fighter prompting to make a return to the octagon is Nick Diaz, the brother of McGregor's old foe Nate Diaz.</p>

<p>McGregor took no time to take a shot at both the brothers, as after his test he tweeted: 'Juice head rats <?php echo e('@'); ?>NateDiaz209' </p>

<p>A potential fight for McGregor opened up earlier this week as Dustin Poirier was unable to agree terms with Tony Ferguson, but with the former champion having already beaten the American, it is unlikely he will be pursuing that option.  </p>
