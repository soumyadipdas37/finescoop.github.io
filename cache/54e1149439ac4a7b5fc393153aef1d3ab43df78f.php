<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thursday night's episode of The Bachelor saw Locky Gilbert's final five suitors declare their love to him in a 'group challenge', after writing their musings down in a journal. </p>

<p>While the segment may have been an innocent reminder of why they were all on the reality show, fans found the 'toast' too much to bear. </p>

<p>'OMG who came up with this "challenge"? Ultra cringeworthy,' one fan tweeted. </p>

<p>'I can't imagine saying any of this!' On Thursday, Bachelor viewers slammed the 'ultra cringeworthy' moment the remaining ladies poured their heart out to Locky Gilbert. Pictured: Irena Srbinvoska </p>

<p>A second wrote: 'I don't know how I feel about this task. All the girls sucking up to ... oops I mean toast Locky!' before asking: 'Is it [loved-up emoji] or [vomit emoji]?'</p>

<p>'Do you think they got given a book of classic Facebook inspo quotes?' a third said.</p>

<p>'Imagining Bella about to do her vows,' another joked, referring to her lengthy toast.</p>

<p>Sorry! And while the challenge may have been an innocent reminder of why they were all on the reality show, fans found it anything but romantic. Pictured: Bella Varelis</p>

<p>'Do the girls watching also get champers? I feel like that would be the only way to get through these cringe fests,' added another.</p>

<p>Watching from home, one fan argued the challenge was anything but believable.</p>

<p>'These feel more like wedding vows then toast but...' they wrote. </p>

<p>Not convinced: 'OMG who came up with this "challenge"? Ultra cringeworthy,' one fan tweeted</p>

<p>In her toast, Bella revealed it was difficult to see other girls share their feelings towards Locky.</p>

<p>'I think it's just weird when you're so invested, you don't really want to see the guy that you like having that strong connection with someone else,' she began.</p>

<p>'I'm telling myself not to not overthink it and not to overlook it because I know how special and strong our connection is.'</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten </p>

<p>Is she The One? Bella was one of the final five to pour her heart out to Locky on The Bachelor </p>
