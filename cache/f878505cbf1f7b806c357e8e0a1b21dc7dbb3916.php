<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Financier Lord Spencer has doubled down on his investment in a technology company shaking up the bond market. </p>

<p>The former Conservative party treasurer has led a £4.3m fundraise for Digital Debt Capital Markets (DDCM), a London-based firm making it easier for companies to manage bond sales. </p>

<p>Grandee: Former Conservative party treasurer Lord Spencer has led a £4.3m fundraise for Digital Debt Capital Markets</p>

<p>He had already invested in the company's first £2.5m seed fundraising personally, and this time has invested through his private investment group IPGL, along with David Rutter, the chief executive of US technology company R3. </p>

<p>DDCM's Agora software streamlines the way bonds are managed, from their issuance to their repayment. </p>

<p>Many firms still use clunky systems and spreadsheets to manage bonds, and several jobs are inadvertently duplicated by bankers and lawyers. </p>

<p>Backing from Spencer, founder of inter-dealer broker Icap, will help DDCM as it builds its software and attracts customers. </p>
