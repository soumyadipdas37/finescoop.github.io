<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tarek El Moussa and his fiancée Heather Rae Young made another big commitment to each other by buying their first house together in Newport Beach, California.</p>

<p>But the 39-year-old Flip Or Flop star and the 33-year-old Selling Sunset fixture still have a lot of work to do on the home, which will need to be totally updated and restored.</p>

<p>That because Tarek originally bought the home with the intention of flipping it, only to decide it had the potential to be their dream home, according to People.</p>

<p>Dream home: Tarek El Moussa, 39, revealed the inside of the new home that he and his fiancée Heather Rae Young bought. People reported that Tarek originally planned to flip it</p>

<p>'Tarek originally bought it as a flip but then they decided to make it their new home,' a representative for the couple said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Tarek shared video to his Instagram Stories of him and Heather touring the new house, which the two plan to give a full makeover before moving in.</p>

<p>'It’s their first project together!' their rep continued. 'They have a lot they want to do with it and the house needs some work so they are going to continue to live in their current home until the new home is ready.'</p>

<p>In his Insta Stories, Tarek said the couple are already meeting with a designer to decide how to proceed with the new property.</p>

<p>Blank canvas: On Tuesday, Tarek filmed Heather giving a tour of the bare home, which they plan to renovate before moving in </p>

<p>Room to work: 'This is basically the blank slate,' Heather says of the bare home and its all-white kitchen, which led to the living and dining rooms</p>

<p>'This is basically the blank slate,' Heather says of the bare home and its all-white kitchen.</p>

<p>The home has a spacious open floor plan, and just off the kitchen are the living room and dining room, along with a staircase up to the second floor.</p>

<p>The couple head upstairs to the open roof top, which features gorgeous views of the area and would be perfect for a barbecue or get-together.</p>

<p>Tarek calls the open space 'why we fell in love with this house' in his video. 'This is why we love this house: the ocean is right there,' he continues.</p>

<p>Although Tarek and Heather didn't seem fazed by it, the sky was filled with a grayish haze from wildfires raging near Los Angeles to the north.</p>

<p>Party space: Tarek and Heather loved the large rooftop area, which they planned to install a hot tub in and connected to the master bedroom</p>

<p>Perfect view: The couple appreciated the great views of the ocean and Newport Beach, even though the sky was filled with smoke from wildfires burning near LA</p>

<p>Throughout the videos, Heather points out things they're already planning to change, like one fire pit that will be removed and another that will be updated, as well as a spot where they plan to install a hot tub.</p>

<p>The couple will have prime access to the hot tub thanks to a door going from their master bedroom upstairs to the balcony.</p>

<p>While Tarek and Heather work on fixing up their new home, they'll continue to live in their rented house, also located nearby in Newport Beach.</p>

<p>They've been living their together since the HGTV star sold off the home he bought with the intention of living with his children following his divorce from his Flip Or Flop costar Christina Anstead.</p>

<p>Heather and Tarek met on July 4, 2019, after mutual friends introduced them in Newport Beach, and they got engaged on July 25 this year.</p>
