<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pope Francis has said that the pleasures of a well-cooked meal or loving sexual intercourse are 'divine' in a newly-published book of interviews. </p>

<p>He believes they have unjustly fallen victim to 'overzealousness' on the part of the Catholic Church in the past.</p>

<p>'Pleasure arrives directly from God, it is neither Catholic, nor Christian, nor anything else, it is simply divine,' the Pope told Italian writer Carlo Petrini.</p>

<p>Pope Francis has said that the pleasures of a well-cooked meal or loving sexual intercourse are 'divine' in a new book by Italian writer Carlo Petrini</p>

<p>He said there was no place for an 'overzealous morality' that denies pleasure, something which he admitted had existed in the church in the past.</p>

<p>The 83-year-old, born in Jorge Bergoglio in Argentina, insisted that this was 'a wrong interpretation of the Christian message' according to RTÉ. </p>

<p>'The Church has condemned inhuman, brutish, vulgar pleasure, but has on the other hand always accepted human, simple, moral pleasure,' he said. </p>

<p>'The pleasure of eating is there to keep you healthy by eating, just like sexual pleasure is there to make love more beautiful and guarantee the perpetuation of the species.</p>

<p>He added: 'The pleasure of eating and sexual pleasure come from God.'  </p>

<p>Pope Francis added that opposing views 'have caused enormous harm, which can still be felt strongly today'. </p>

<p>The book 'TerraFutura, conversations with Pope Francis on integral ecology', written by Petrini, was published on September 9.  </p>

<p>Mr Petrini is the founder of the global 'slow food' movement created in the 1980s in opposition to 'fast food'.  </p>

<p>The interviews focus on the pope's vision of environmentalism with a social face, outlined in his 2015 encyclical 'Laudato Si'.</p>

<p>This comes days after the pontiff told an audience at the Vatican that 'coronavirus would be defeated by God's love' and removed his mask to chat with worshipers.  </p>
