<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Violent crime has soared to its highest level in a decade after a surge in drug feuds, domestic abuse and hate crime, statistics show.</p>

<p>Drug rivalries became increasingly violent in the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic in order to retain their turf.</p>

<p>Violence outside of venues also soared as lockdown restrictions loosened due to 'pent up rage', according to police.</p>

<p>It comes after it was revealed violent crime had returned to pre-Covid levels last month, amid fears that numbers could rise even further as lockdown measures are lifted.</p>

<p>Violent offences were at their highest level in nearly ten years across two thirds of forces in England and Wales in July</p>

<p>Analysis of police data by The Times shows violent offences were at their highest level in nearly ten years across two thirds of forces in England and Wales in July.</p>

<p>Violent crime was higher last month than in July 2019 in 31 of 39 police forces who published their statistics.</p>

<p>Gloucestershire saw violent crime rise by 39 per cent while Durham had and increase of 35 per cent, the two highest rises in the country. </p>

<p>Rachel Almeida, assistant director of Victim Support, said domestic violence had been 'more intense, of high severity, and more frequent' during lockdown. </p>

<p>She said: 'During lockdown perpetrators have increased their control and violence, and victims were unable to get away.' </p>

<p>Last month saw 17 killings in London - two more than July 2019. January this year saw 11 homicides in the capital, and February just seven. Violent crime rates (pictured) are also soaring</p>

<p>Violent crime monthly figures for June across the West Midlands - which includes Britain's second-most populated city, Birmingham - was the highest seen in the last year</p>

<p>West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said crime had 'bounced back' since restricting lockdown measures were relaxed. </p>

<p>Violent crime rose by 27 per cent across the West Midlands this July since the same time last year, with 10,849 offences reported. </p>

<p>Mr Jamieson fears young people - who are not working - could get involved in criminal activity due to an abundance of time or missed schooling.</p>

<p>He said the surge in violent resulted from the 'unlocking of a lot of pent-up frustrations' built during lockdown.</p>

<p>Mr Jamieson added Covid-19 had disrupted the drugs market, resulting in a 'sudden explosion of violence as the drugs gangs fight for territory'.</p>

<p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there is a 'real risk of violent crime spiking as lockdown is eased' in the capital</p>

<p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there is a 'real risk of violent crime spiking as lockdown is eased' in the capital after the pandemic sent crime rates plummeting by a quarter in England and Wales.</p>

<p>July saw 17 killings in the city - two more than July 2019. January this year saw 11 homicides in the capital, and February just seven.</p>

<p>There were 19,104 violent crimes in June - compared to 17,264 in February and 18,569 in January. </p>

<p>Mr Khan told The Guardian that he is concerned that 'the last decade of government austerity, where ministers decimated police and youth services – causing violent crime to rise in London and across the UK' could be repeated all over again.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, a 20-year-old was knifed to death in broad daylight in Stockwell Road in south London at around 2.51pm.</p>

<p>The victim was found with a number of stab wounds and died at the scene despite paramedics' best efforts.</p>

<p>Pastor Lorraine Jones, who lost her own son Dwayne Simpson to gun crime when he was also 20 in 2014, witnessed the distressing scenes.</p>

<p>She said in a video shared on Twitter: 'I've just been holding a mother who just lost her son.</p>

<p>'Why was this young boy stabbed? Why? What is the reason? There is so much that must be tied to it.'</p>

<p>Forensic teams and officers search the crime scene in north London on Monday night</p>

<p>Met Police were called at 8pm to North Road, Islington, and found a young man suffering with stab injuries</p>

<p>Earlier on Monday, an 18-year-old was stabbed to death in north London after being chased and attacked.</p>

<p>Met Police were called at 8pm to North Road, Islington, and found Kamal Nuur suffering with stab injuries.</p>

<p>He was treated at the scene by paramedics, but was later pronounced dead.</p>

<p>Police said Mr Nuur was chased and attacked in Goodinge Close, just off North Road, by two male suspects who then fled in the direction of York Way.</p>

<p>A witness told the Evening Standard she tried to save his life after a chase and fight lasting less than a minute.</p>

<p>She said: 'I heard a ruckus then a cry of "help me help me". There was a young man laying on the ground. I went out with other neighbours, he was still breathing.</p>

<p>'We tried to comfort him. His friend was with him shouting ‘raise your hand if you can hear me’. He was not conscious.</p>

<p>'I can’t get the image of the boy laying there. The neighbours did their best. It’s heartbreaking, our thoughts are with his family.'</p>

<p>His death was the fifth murder in London in as many days. </p>
