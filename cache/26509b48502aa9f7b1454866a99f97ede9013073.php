<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>After being hit with a transfer ban 12 months ago, the revolving door at Stamford Bridge is back up and running and hasn't stopped spinning this summer.</p>

<p>Incoming players Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech, Thiago Silva and now Edouard Mendy have dominated the headlines, part of a £220million spending spree.</p>

<p>But dozens of other players from Chelsea's enormous squad have left, whether on permanent deals like Willian, Pedro and Mario Pasalic, or out on loan like Michy Batshuayi, Ethan Ampadu and Davide Zappacosta.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard has been ruthless in thinning out Chelsea's bloated squad this summer and it's likely some more of his under-used players will depart before the October 5 deadline</p>

<p>German duo Kai Havertz (left) and Timo Werner are two of Chelsea's expensive summer buys</p>

<p>With the transfer window open until October 5, Frank Lampard's thinning of personnel is far from finished.</p>

<p>The expensive new arrivals will increase competition but consign some to a season on the bench or on the sidelines.</p>

<p>We take a closer look at some of the Chelsea outcasts who may yet depart before the window closes.</p>

<p>Antonio Rudiger</p>

<p>Not the best start to the season for the German centre-half, who has been left out of the last two Chelsea squads having been an unused substitute in their Premier League opener at Brighton.</p>

<p>Rudiger has apparently slipped to Chelsea's fifth-choice in that position behind Kurt Zouma, Andreas Christensen, Fikayo Tomori and new signing Thiago Silva.</p>

<p>He may have an escape route before the window shuts, however, with Barcelona emerging as frontrunners along with Paris Saint-Germain and his old club Roma.</p>

<p>Defender Antonio Rudiger could be on his way out with interest from Barcelona and PSG</p>

<p>Marcos Alonso</p>

<p>Competition for the left-back spot is fierce at Chelsea following the arrival of £50m man Ben Chilwell.</p>

<p>That is likely to push at least one of the club's other left-backs out the door, with Alonso reportedly wanted by former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte at Inter Milan.</p>

<p>The Spaniard has played both of Chelsea's Premier League matches so far but only because Chilwell is injured.</p>

<p>However, Alonso will certainly want to stay and fight for his place and there are doubts over Inter's financial power without selling players.</p>

<p>Marcos Alonso is reportedly an Inter Milan target as he faces competition from Ben Chilwell</p>

<p>Danny Drinkwater</p>

<p>Drinkwater has been surplus to requirements in Chelsea's midfield for a long time now with his last appearance coming in the 2018 Community Shield.</p>

<p>Various indiscretions and incidents have ruined subsequent loan spells at Burnley and Aston Villa, with Chelsea telling him to find a new club this summer.</p>

<p>Nothing has yet been agreed, though there have been rumours of a potential reunion with his former Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri at Sampdoria.</p>

<p>Danny Drinkwater, who spent time on loan at Aston Villa last season, is likely to leave Chelsea</p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga</p>

<p>While it's unlikely Kepa will be moving in the next couple of weeks, he does face the prospect of a season as Chelsea's goalkeeping outcast following some high-profile errors.</p>

<p>His latest gaffe to gift Sadio Mane a goal in last weekend's loss to Liverpool came at a terrible time as Chelsea confirmed the signing of Edouard Mendy from Rennes on Thursday.</p>

<p>Now under severe pressure for his place, Kepa, the world's most expensive keeper, could easily spend the remainder of the season warming the bench.</p>

<p>His confidence is shot after a series of mistakes and Mendy's arrival only heaps further pressure on the Spaniard's shoulders.</p>

<p>Kepa faces a season warming the Chelsea bench after a series of high-profile mistakes</p>

<p>Ross Barkley</p>

<p>Chelsea are certainly well-stocked for midfielders and surely one or two will need to be off-loaded before October 5.</p>

<p>Aston Villa are interested in a potential loan deal for England international Ross Barkley, who scored in Wednesday night's Carabao Cup win over Barnsley.</p>

<p>Barkley started 13 league games last season and has come off the bench against both Liverpool and Brighton.</p>

<p>But if he is to make a case for inclusion in Gareth Southgate's Euro 2020 squad, it would make sense to go somewhere for more game time.</p>

<p>Barkley may have to go out on loan for greater game time given Chelsea's midfield options</p>

<p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek</p>

<p>Another Englishman looking for an opportunity to impress, Loftus-Cheek didn't take his chance when Lampard started him against Brighton.</p>

<p>Aston Villa are also interested in a loan arrangement but they must choose between Loftus-Cheek and Barkley because of Premier League rules.</p>

<p>Gary Neville criticised Loftus-Cheek after his ineffective display at Brighton, saying: 'There's going to come a point when they're going to cash in and get £25million for him.'</p>

<p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek didn't impress in Chelsea's win at Brighton and Lampard took him off</p>

<p>Callum Hudson-Odoi</p>

<p>The winger's Chelsea future has come under increasing scrutiny after Lampard told the 19-year-old to work harder in training.</p>

<p>The Blues aren't exactly short of attacking options and there are a number of leading clubs - including Bayern Munich - who are monitoring the situation.</p>

<p>When central midfielder Mason Mount is favoured in Hudson-Odoi's usual wide position, even with Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech injured, it does suggest the manager's faith is wearing thin.</p>

<p>However, he would still face stiff competition for game time at Bayern and only signed an expensive five-year deal with Chelsea last summer.</p>

<p>Callum Hudson-Odoi has been told to train harder but would interest top European clubs</p>

<p>Victor Moses</p>

<p>It seems such a long time ago that Moses thrived as one of Antonio Conte's flying wing-backs.</p>

<p>The Nigerian has since been out on loan to Fenerbahce and Inter Milan where he was reunited with Conte and his team of Premier League cast-offs.</p>

<p>Now Moses is back at Chelsea and scored in a recent friendly with AFC Wimbledon. However, he wasn't assigned a squad number and will surely be offloaded as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Victor Moses during his loan spell at Inter Milan last season - his Chelsea days are numbered</p>

<p>Tiemoue Bakayoko</p>

<p>Another in the 'can't believe he's still a Chelsea player' category, Bakayoko last played for the club at the end of the 2017-18 season.</p>

<p>The midfielder - another favourite of Conte but nobody since - has been on loan at AC Milan and then his old club Monaco in the past two years.</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain and Milan are reportedly interested in taking him off Chelsea's hands for good but may have to pay £32m for the 26-year-old.</p>

<p>Tiemoue Bakayoko has attracted some interest from PSG and Milan but Chelsea want £32m</p>

<p>Emerson Palmieri</p>

<p>Another likely to miss out on regular football when Chilwell regains full match fitness.</p>

<p>The Italy left-back played in the Carabao Cup against Barnsley but that could well be the extent of his ambitions for the season unless he moves on.</p>

<p>There are suggestions that Juventus may take Emerson on a loan deal with an option to buy the 26-year-old if he prospers.</p>

<p>Emerson will face stiff competition at left-back but Juventus are reportedly interest in a loan</p>
