<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Many Brits have spent their five months in lockdown picking up new skills, with thousands taking to the kitchen to perfect a dish or two. </p>

<p>And now a new service has launched offering interactive online classes taught by Michelin starred chefs and other food experts to help people cook along and make restaurant quality dishes at home.</p>

<p>The Knowledge Recycled Zoom classes, which start at just £9, are fronted by an all-star line up of those at the top of the food and drink industry, including Tom Anglesea, the Head Chef at The Laughing Heart, and Great British Menu winner Lee Westcott, a Michelin star chef.</p>

<p>The new venture was the lockdown project of Julia Kemp, who set up Knowledge Recycled after moving back to her native UK from San Francisco, where she was working as growth marketing consultant.</p>

The new venture was the lockdown project of Julia Kemp (pictured), who set up Knowledge Recycled after moving back to her native UK from San Francisco</p>

<p>Some of the classes are one offs, while others are run as a 'series'; for example, Shaun Presland, a top sushi chef who runs pacific in Mayfair, is going through Japanese cuisine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile while James Cochran, who made his name at two-Michelin starred The Ledbury, is helping people cook 'Michelin star' dishes, starting with knife skills and progressing to sauces and foams. </p>

<p>All ingredients and equipment needed for the class are shown on the website when purchasing a ticket.</p>

<p>Those taking part will need to purchase the ingredients in advance of the class to participate, but it isn't compulsory to cook along, and some just watch.</p>

<p>All experts have carefully selected affordable and accessible ingredients that are available in most supermarkets. </p>

<p>No later than 72 hours before the start of the class, participants are provided with any more information about the class and the relevant Zoom link.</p>

<p>Monisha Bharadwaji: Award winning author and Indian chef told Femail it's best to balance flavours by not adding too much of one spice</p>

<p>TOP TIP: 'Make sure to add the right amount of ground spices to a curry - usually, one teaspoon each of a few spices is enough. </p>

<p>Tom Dyer - World Champion Flair Bartender and 12-time UK Flair Bartending Champion is also on the list of experts offering classes</p>

<p>TOM'S TOP TIPS FOR BARTENDING </p>

<p>'If you don't have professional bar equipment, you can use kitchen tools to make great drinks. A large jar acts as a great shaker, a sieve as a strainer and a rolling pin as a muddler.</p>

<p>'Ice is the secret ingredient to most cocktails. Don't be scared to use it, make sure you have more than you think you need and make sure that it is COLD. Use it straight from the freezer and don't let it melt or get wet as it will dilute your drink too much.</p>

<p>'A great cocktail is all about pairing flavours and getting the correct balance. Just like cooking, always try and follow a recipe and try and recreate flavour combinations you already know.'</p>
