<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eugenie Le Sommer, Saki Kumagai and Sara Bjork Gunnarsdottir fired record-breaking Lyon to their fifth successive Women's Champions League title with a 3-1 win over Wolfsburg in Spain.</p>

<p>Lyon made light of big-name absentees like Ada Hegerberg and Nikita Parris to defeat Wolfsburg for a third time in the Champions League final.</p>

<p>Alex Popp hit back for the German side with a smart header, but Lyon were too strong, too savvy and too collected - and Iceland midfielder Gunnarsdottir rubber-stamped the win with a late third.</p>

<p>Lyon had to battle hard but fully merited their record seventh Champions League success, in their ninth final in 11 years.</p>

<p>The French giants have not tasted defeat in competitive action since a 1-0 loss to Paris St Germain in the French cup final back on May 31, 2018.</p>

<p>England's Lucy Bronze finished her Lyon career in style, bowing out with a hat-trick of European titles.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old has yet to reveal her next destination, but sealed the ideal exit as Lyon prevailed in San Sebastian. </p>

<p>Lyon recorded their fifth successive Women's Champions League title on Sunday</p>

<p>Two-time winners Wolfsburg fell to familiar foes Lyon again, unable to dislodge the French side in their fifth final.</p>

<p>Gunnarsdottir only joined Lyon in July - making the switch from Wolfsburg. The 28-year-old turned out for the Germans earlier in this season's competition, but the coronavirus-delayed campaign meant she faced her old club in the final.</p>

<p>Lyon dominated from the off, Europe's outstanding talents again showing all the poise and polish required for another triumph.</p>

<p>Le Sommer put the defending champions ahead, sweeping home at the second attempt having had her first effort parried by Friederike Abt. </p>

<p>The lively Delphine Cascarino had created the opportunity, charging down the right flank and laying on a smart cutback across the area.</p>

<p>Wolfsburg shook off the setback and settled into the contest, but crucially were unable to carve out any genuine chances.</p>

<p>And Lyon punished the Germans just ahead of the break, thanks to Kumagai's high-quality strike.</p>

<p>The Japan midfielder drilled home from the edge of the area with a fine technical finish, to leave the French side in total control at the break.</p>

<p>Lyon eased into the second half and appeared entirely comfortable, only for Wolfsburg to snatch a lifeline just ahead of the hour.</p>

<p>Ewa Pajor delivered a smart cross in latching onto Lyon keeper Sarah Bouhaddi's fumble, and Popp reacted adroitly with the snap-header finish.</p>

<p>Wolfsburg's bid for an equaliser was ultimately ended by Gunnarsdottir's scrambled finish, following Le Sommer's driven shot as Lyon emerged victorious once again.</p>
