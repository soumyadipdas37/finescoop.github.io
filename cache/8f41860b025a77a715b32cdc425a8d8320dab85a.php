<p>Smitten: Brooklyn referred to Nicola as 'my wife' in a sweet Instagram post last month, ramping up speculation they have already wed</p>

<p>Speculation: Appearing to confirm the union, the son of David and Victoria Beckham, commented 'my wife' on a smitten snap of the pair - which Nicole had captioned 'My forever'</p>

<p>Nicola's new post comes after it was claimed she could be set to wed fiancé Brooklyn at London landmark St Paul's Cathedral, according to The Sun.</p>

<p>The photographer's parents David, 45, and Victoria, 46, are able to request to hold Brooklyn's marriage at the iconic venue due to their OBE status.</p>

<p>Choosing the London cathedral as the couple's wedding venue comes with a price however, as they would have to wait until 2022 due to a long waiting list.</p>

<p>Brooklyn and Nicola would be following in the footsteps of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer who married there in 1981, shunning the traditional Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'David and Victoria are aware Brooklyn can get married at St Paul's. </p>

<p>Sweet: Brooklyn took to Instagram in July to announce his engagement to Nicola following reports he had popped the question to his 'soulmate' after just eight months of dating </p>

<p>'They are overseeing their British wedding and want to make sure it has the wow factor for Nicola's family.</p>

<p>'If they went ahead, the wedding would have real gravitas and set the benchmark for what comes later in America. Brooklyn and Nicola are weighing up their options.' </p>

<p>The ceremony would be traditional and has to include at least one Bible reading, while any sort of contemporary music would be off the cards. </p>

<p>Wedding ceremonies are held in the Chapel of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the crypt, and applications have to be passed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. </p>

<p>The publication reported that the basic cost of a wedding at the cathedral would be more than £5,000, as the ceremony alone costs £3,240.  </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for comment at the time.  </p>

<p>Big plans! The star's new post comes after it was reported that she could be set to wed Brooklyn at London's iconic St Paul's Cathedral</p>
