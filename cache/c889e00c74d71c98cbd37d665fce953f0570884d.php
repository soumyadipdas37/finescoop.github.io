<p>Off-duty Milwaukee police community service officer Naeem Sarosh, 35, was fatally shot Monday night around 6pm by his 65-year-old neighbor, police say</p>

<p>'I’m dumbfounded by it because everybody is very quiet. We always say hello. Nodoby bothers anybody. It’s shocking,' neighbor Tammy Mitton, who overheard Sarosh arguing with his neighbor.</p>

<p>'I heard loud discussion, couldn’t make out any words, but then, a man just screamed at the top of his lungs, "I told you to put that down,"' Mitton said.</p>

<p>The 65-year-old man has been taken into custody.</p>

<p>Sarosh’s family and the suspect’s family were reportedly good friends before the shooting, but some neighbors say Sarosh and the suspect had gotten into fights before.</p>

<p>Neighbor Nicole Santiago said to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Sarosh was 'an outstanding member of the community' who leaves behind a wife and two daughters.</p>

<p>He lived in the neighborhood for about four to five years, but had recurring disputes with the suspect, Santiago said.</p>

<p>She said the suspect has lived in the area for decades but has mostly kept to himself.</p>

<p>Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett released a statement praising Sarosh as a well-respected employee.</p>

<p>'While the circumstances of the situation haven’t been fully determined, these types of senseless acts of violence should disturb us all,' Barrett said.</p>

<p>A police investigation into the shooting is ongoing and criminal charges will be presented to the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s office in the coming years. </p>

<p>'Community Service Officer Sarosh is a four-year veteran with the Milwaukee Police Department and was assigned to District 2. He will be greatly missed by the members of this organization and by the members of our community,' the Milwaukee Police Department said in a statement.</p>

<p>Sarosh worked with the Milwaukee Police Department for four years and as a community service officer he responded to crimes like vandalism and no injury traffic crashes to take pictures and reports. Pictured right in an interview in 2011</p>

<p>According to a 2017 job posting community service officers are not sworn officers but they help respond to non-emergency calls and help with accident investigations. They are also unarmed.</p>

<p>Ald. Scott Spiker, who represents the Clayton Crest neighborhood where the shooting happened, called the fatal attack ‘senseless’ in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'When guns are used to settle disputes, whether among acquaintances or complete strangers, only tragedy can result,' he said. </p>

<p>A GoFundMe page has been set up to support Sarosh's family, raising over $13,000 of its $20,000 goal so far. </p>
