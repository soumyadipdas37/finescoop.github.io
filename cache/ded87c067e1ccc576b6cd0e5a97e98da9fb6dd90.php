<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Actor Kevin Spacey was sued on Wednesday by actor Anthony Rapp and a second, unnamed person for assault and battery in the 1980s, when both were under the age of 18.</p>

<p>The civil lawsuit was filed in New York State court in Manhattan on Wednesday. </p>

<p>Rapp's claim is that the actor climbed on top of him and tried to perform a sex act on him in 1986 when he was 14. He first made the allegation in a 2017 BuzzFeed interview. </p>

<p>The second accuser is anonymous. </p>

<p>He says that in another incident in the 80s, Spacey raped him and that they performed oral sex on each other. </p>

<p>Kevin Spacey has been sued by Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp and one other anonymous accuser for alleged sexual assaults in the 1980s </p>

<p>He also alleges that Spacey tried to sodomize him before he got out of his apartment.   </p>

<p>Spacey, who has largely retreated from public life after a starring in films such as 'American Beauty' and 'The Usual Suspects,' could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. </p>

<p>In his 2017 BuzzFeed interview, Rapp claimed he and Spacey met while they both performed on Broadway shows. </p>

<p>He says that on one occasion, he went back to Spacey's apartment for a party and that when there, Spacey lifted him by his buttocks onto his bed and leaned over him. </p>

<p>Rapp was 14 at the time and Spacey was 26.</p>

<p>'My stomach churns. I still to this day can't wrap my head around so many aspects of it. It's just deeply confusing to me,' he said at the time. </p>

<p>In his response to Rapp's claims, Spacey said he did not remember it. </p>

<p>'If I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior,' he said.</p>

<p>Last summer, a different young man withdrew a lawsuit in which he claimed that Spacey had assaulted him in a restaurant in Nantucket in 2016.  </p>

<p>Weeks later, a criminal case against Spacey over that incident was also dropped.  </p>
