<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A grandfather who suffered serious fractures in a ladder fall believes he may not be still here today if he wasn't wearing his trusty Apple Watch at the time. </p>

<p>Jason Potts, 54, was cleaning his gutters with a pressure cleaner at his Latrobe Valley home in Victoria's Gippsland region earlier his month when disaster struck.</p>

<p>A piece of timber he was holding broke, which forced him to fall backwards, topple over a 1.8m high fence and land head first on the concrete path in the backyard next door.</p>

<p>As neighbours rushed to his aid and rang triple-0, Mr Potts' Apple Watch also detected the chaos.</p>

<p>An injured Jason Potts is treated by paramedics after his Apple Watch (pictured) called triple-0</p>

<p>'A voice came out of my watch saying "hello, can anyone hear me, your Apple Watch has detected a hard fall and called triple-0, do you require an ambulance?",' Mr Potts told Seven News.</p>

<p>'That was a spin out as if the fall wasn't a spin out itself.'</p>

<p>The smart device also alerted Mr Potts' wife Michele, who was set up on the watch as an emergency contact.</p>

<p>'I received four messages saying Jason had a hard fall and his last location,' she said. </p>

<p>Still bearing the physical scars, Mr Potts suffered a dislocated collarbone, fractures to his spine and ribs, along with a nasty gash to his head, which required surgery.</p>

<p>He spent five days in hospital and will need another 4-6 weeks to recover from his injuries. </p>

<p>'I'm 107kg so I landed with all that weight on my head and shoulder,' Mr Potts said.</p>

<p>The near-fatal accident hasn't deterred Mr Potts, vows to get back up on the ladder and finish cleaning his gutters once he's fully recovered.</p>

<p>He feels comforted to know his Apple device will be watching if disaster strikes again. </p>

<p>Grandfather-of-nine Jason Potts survived a horrific fall from his ladder on September 20</p>

<p>Jason Potts suffered a dislocated collarbone, fractures to his spine and ribs and a head gash</p>

<p>'It's like, that's clever, it's nice to know that worked,' Mr Potts told NCA Newswire.</p>

<p>'Eighteen months ago when I bought it I must have known something about triple-0 because I didn't want to test it, what are you going to do to test it?</p>

<p>'I think this is something that people need to know that it works - even the people in the hospital hadn't heard of it before.'</p>

<p>Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority says it's not the first time triple-0 operators have received a call from a smart watch.</p>
