<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leicester Tigers are in danger of being taken to the High Court unless they pay out close to £750,000 to five players who were axed in the summer.</p>

<p>Greg Bateman, Kyle Eastmond, Noel Reid, Manu Tuilagi and Telusa Veainu had their contracts terminated by in July after refusing to accept a 25% pay cut.</p>

<p>All bar Eastmond have signed for new clubs on reduced salaries and have sought legal advice for lost earnings caused by unfair dismissal.</p>

<p>Leicester Tigers could be taken to court unless they pay £750k to five released players</p>

<p>One source told the Mail on Sunday: ‘The players weren’t in agreement with the pay cut but that wasn’t a sackable offence. The club were 100% in breach of contract.’</p>

<p>The players’ total loss in earnings is close to £750,000 – with Tuilagi facing the biggest shortfall – and Leicester were given a 28-day window to reach a settlement.</p>

<p>The Mail on Sunday understands no offer has yet been made to the players, who are subsequently poised to sue the club for damages in the High Court.</p>

<p>Leicester Tigers declined the opportunity to comment.</p>
