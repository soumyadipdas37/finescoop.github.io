<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Carlo Ancelotti has backed under-fire Jordan Pickford by saying Everton have no interest in signing a new goalkeeper.</p>

<p>Reports on Friday suggested the Toffees are considering a move for Manchester United's Sergio Romero after England No 1 Pickford made a series of errors.</p>

<p>But Ancelotti says Pickford has his 'total confidence' and described him as a 'great goalkeeper.' </p>

<p>Jordan Pickford has the 'total confidence' of manager Carlo Ancelotti despite recent errors</p>

<p>England No 1 Pickford made two errors in Everton's Carabao Cup win over Fleetwood</p>

<p>Pickford was unable to keep out Callum Camps' overhead kick despite it being straight at him</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of Everton’s trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday, Ancelotti said: ‘There is a lot of focus on him but, I have to be honest, he started really well and did a fantastic match against Tottenham.</p>

<p>‘I am not really focused on him, like you. He is a great goalkeeper. He has my total confidence.’</p>

<p>Asked whether Everton intended to bring in a new goalkeeper, the Italian replied: ‘We are not looking for this.’</p>
