<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who claims she was shot in the breast by a right-wing protester wielding a paintball gun on the streets of Portland is now suing him for $250,000.</p>

<p>Meg McLain filed suit against Alan Swinney, who identifies himself as a member of the far-right Proud Boys group, on Tuesday - saying he deliberately shot her during demonstrations in the city on August 22.</p>

<p>McLain, who says she was a curious bystander amid violence between right and left-wing demonstrators, is claiming a quarter of a million dollars for 'pain, discomfort, distress, and interference with daily life.'</p>

<p>Alan Swinney, a self-declared member of the far-right Proud Boys and a vocal Trump supporter, is being sued for $250,000 after firing paintballs at protesters in Portland</p>

<p>Swinney was pictured firing into the crowd with a paintball gun as violence flared between 300 pro-Trump demonstrators and counter-protesters</p>

<p>The lawsuit described Swinney as 'an irresponsible gun owner who travels to Oregon to organize.. purposefully violent rallies and events'.</p>

<p>It also includes a social media post from Swinney in which he appears to admit shooting members of the crowd, while claiming self-defense.</p>

<p>Multiple photographs and videos taken on the day in question show Swinney firing the paintball gun into the crowd, and being hit by paint in return.</p>

<p>At one point he also drew a handgun and pointed it into the crowd, but did not fire.</p>

<p>Michael Fuller, the attorney representing McLain, said the shooting was reported to police at the time, but they refused to arrest or issue a citation to Swinney.</p>

<p>Meg McLain claims she was shot in the right breast while observing events, and is now suing Swinney for 'pain and distress'</p>

<p>'It’s just one of the many cases where police are seemingly showing favoritism to Trump supporters,' Fuller told The Oregonian.</p>

<p>Prosecutors are investigating the violence in Portland on August 22, but so far no charges have been filed against Swinney.</p>

<p>Around 300 pro-Trump demonstrators had gathered in the city that day for a rally, following weeks of marches by left-wing BLM and Antifa groups.</p>

<p>As the two sides faced off, paintballs began flying while clouds of mace filled the air.</p>

<p>Police largely stood by as the violence escalated, with police chief Chuck Lovell saying later that he was worried intervening would escalate things further.</p>

<p>Portland has been gripped by weeks of near-continuous protests that began in the wake of George Floyd's death and have now been ongoing for 96 days.</p>

<p>The violence ratcheted up at the weekend with the fatal shooting of Aaron 'Jay' Bishop, a member of the pro-Trump Patriot Prayer group, in the city.</p>

<p>The lawsuit also brands Swinney an 'irresponsible gun owner' after he was pictured pointing a handgun at protesters, though did not open fire</p>

<p>Swinney was involved in clashes between protesters and counter-protesters in Portland on August 22, with police criticized for not intervening in the clashes</p>

<p>Portland has been gripped by more than three months of demonstrations that began in the wake of George Floyd's death in May, and have continued since then</p>

<p>Police are thought to have identified Michael Forest Reinoehl, who describes himself online as 100% antifa, as a suspect.</p>

<p>Left-wing marchers have repeatedly targeted law enforcement buildings along with mayor Ted Wheeler's house during their nightly events.</p>

<p>Wheeler announced Monday that he will be moving home after his condo in an upmarket area of the city was repeatedly targeted by protests which have been ongoing for months. </p>

<p>Ted Wheeler sent an email to other people living in the Pearl District block where his two-bed, $840,000 condo is located after activists lit fires outside the building, set off fireworks and blared music to 'celebrate' his 58th birthday on Monday night.</p>

<p>Wheeler apologized for 'the fear that you are experiencing due to my position' before announcing his move, saying it is 'best for me and for everyone else's safety.'</p>
