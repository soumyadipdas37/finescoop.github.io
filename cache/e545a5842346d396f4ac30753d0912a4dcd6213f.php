<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bayern Munich's return of supporters has been blocked mere hours before their season opener after authorities revoked the move following a spike in coronavirus infections in Germany. </p>

<p>The Champions League winners host Schalke tonight as they look to defend their Bundesliga title once more at the Allianz Arena, after Hans Dieter-Flick's side romped home to victory last season.</p>

<p>There had been plans for 7,500 fans to attend the game this evening, as football attempts to bring supporters back to games amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Bayern Munich will not host 7,500 fans during tonight's season opener against Schalke</p>

<p>However, following a recent surge in cases in the country, authorities have opted against allowing the fans into the ground tonight, according to Bild. </p>

<p>At the time of writing, Germany has 2,194 covid-19 cases, which is a big jump from the 927 cases confirmed on September 14.</p>

<p>That represents an overnight spike of 34 cases per 100,000 to 47.6 in the Bavarian capital.  </p>

<p>It was announced on Wednesday that the 7,500 fans would be allowed to attend the game, but by Thursday, authorities grew concerned that the move may have been made too soon.</p>

<p>The remainder of the 2019-20 campaign was played behind closed doors with the Bundesliga one of the first leagues to return amid the pandemic.  </p>
