<p>Ann Marie Smith (pictured), 54, died at Royal Adelaide Hospital in April from septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores and malnourishment </p>

<p>South Australia Police raided the office of Ms Smith's National Disability Insurance Scheme care providers, Integrity Care SA, (pictured above) on Thursday morning</p>

<p>Ms Smith died at Royal Hospital Adelaide and it is believed she was severely neglected for a year prior to her death.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old lived alone in putrid conditions at her Adelaide home and relied on carers under the National Disability Insurance Scheme to look after her. </p>

<p>Police allege Ms Smith's jewellery was taken, her money was stolen and she was left in the same chair for 12 months. </p>

<p>Her carer Rosemary Maione, 69, was arrested at a Hectorville home and charged with manslaughter on August 6.  </p>

<p>Detective Superintendent Des Bray said the Integrity Care head office and a home at Huntfield Heights were raided as part of an ongoing investigation. </p>

<p>'We've shifted our focus to the role of others employed or running Integrity Care SA who had a responsibility to deliver care,' he explained.   </p>

<p>Supt Bray called on Integrity Care employees to talk to police and assist with the investigation.    </p>

<p>'Some employees have steadfastly refused to cooperate and have done nothing whatsoever to assist the investigation or to ensure that this sort of neglect could never happen to anybody again.</p>

<p>Rosemary Maione (left), 69, was charged with manslaughter over Ms Smith's death</p>

<p>South Australian police have released photos from inside Ms Smith's home where she sat in her final days. The 54-year-old was allegedly left in the same chair for 12 months </p>

<p>'We know some employees were concerned about operating practices and we plan to speak to more of them in the coming days,' he explained.</p>

<p>Supt Bray urged anyone with information about Ms Smith to contact police.   </p>

<p>'We encourage employees to cooperate in this investigation, so we can ensure this never happens again.</p>

<p>'It's time for all employees, past and present, to do the right thing and speak to investigators by phoning Crime Stoppers tonight.</p>

<p>'Detectives will be available to talk to anybody who rings Crime Stoppers and anybody who's worked for Integrity SA,' he said.   </p>

<p>Police allege Maione treated Ms Smith (pictured above with dogs) with severe neglect and also stole money and jewellery from the 54-year old </p>

<p>Maione (pictured) was granted a strict home detention bail at her house in Hectorville </p>

<p>The investigation has already received at least 78 calls with information in relation to Ms Smith.    </p>

<p>The National Disability Insurance Scheme commission has been investigating Integrity Care, which took two weeks to report Ms Smith's death to the NDIS Commission.</p>

<p>The provider was slapped with a $12,600 fine over its failure to notify the Commission within 24 hours and has been banned from operating.   </p>

<p>Integrity Care will no longer be a registered provider of NDIS-funded supports and services and will be banned from providing them to people covered by NDIS.</p>

<p>The Commission's investigation into Integrity Care remains ongoing and further regulatory action may be taken. </p>

<p>Maione was employed by Integrity Care until May 18, days after the police investigation into Ms Smith's death was launched.</p>

<p>She was granted strict home detention bail and will be electronically monitored at her Hectorville home. </p>
