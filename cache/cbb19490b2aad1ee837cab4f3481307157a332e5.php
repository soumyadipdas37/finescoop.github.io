<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The World Health Organization's European director has said that 'alarming' Covid-19 transmission rates across Europe are a 'wake-up call'.  </p>

<p>Dr. Hans Kluge also warned national governments Thursday against reducing the quarantine period for people potentially exposed to the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that Covid-19 'fatigue' was setting in with growing public resistance to the measures needed to control the pandemic.</p>

<p>Dr. Kluge said that 'even a slight reduction in the length of the quarantine' could have a significant effect on the spread of the virus which returned to 'alarming rates of transmission' in Europe this month.</p>

<p>Kluge insisted that countries should only reduce the standard two-week quarantine period if it was scientifically justified. He offered to convene scientific discussions on the issue, if necessary.</p>

<p>WHO Europe's 53-country region recorded more than 300,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the last week, and more than half of the countries reported a rise of more than 10% in cases over the last two weeks, he said. Of those countries, seven had their cases jump by more than two-fold.</p>

<p>Such statistics should be 'a wake-up call for all of us,' Kluge said.</p>

<p>He called for 'regional coherence' and said that Europe's response has been effective when 'prompt and resolute. But the virus has shown (to be) merciless whenever partisanship and disinformation prevailed.'</p>

<p>Last week, France cut its required quarantine time for people possibly exposed to someone with COVID-19 from 14 days to seven, saying many people did not observe the full two-week period anyway.</p>

<p>Katie Smallwood, WHO Europe's senior health emergency officer, said its recommendation that people quarantine themselves for 14 days after a possible exposure was based on the agency's understanding of the disease's incubation period and transmission patterns.</p>

<p>'We would only revise that on a basis of a change in our understanding of the science, and so far that's not the case,' she said.</p>

<p>Smallwood added that several countries were considering reducing their required quarantine periods - a move that is not endorsed by WHO.</p>

<p>'We would really re-emphasize that our position is that a 14-day quarantine is important for patients that have been exposed to the virus,' she said.</p>

<p>During a press briefing with both substance and symbolism, the two WHO Europe officials both wore masks during a video conference from Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The decision was a marked statement compared to a news conference held an hour earlier at WHO's world headquarters in Geneva, where neither Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, his emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, nor any other officials were masked.</p>

<p>Switzerland and France, which all but surrounds Geneva, both have reported a surge in confirmed virus cases in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Kluge said his decision to wear a mask was 'a clear signal that we are going into a worsening situation.'</p>

<p>'At the moment...we see a fatigue and resistance in the behavior that is helpful' in fighting the virus,' he explained. 'It's very important to give a signal, and certainly it's a strong sign of solidarity.'</p>

<p>Kluge said past successes in Europe suggested the continent would be again capable of suppressing the virus' recent rebound.</p>

<p>'In the spring and early summer, we were able to see the impact of strict lockdown measures. Our efforts, our sacrifices, paid off. In June, cases hit an all-time low,' he said. 'The September case numbers, however, should serve as a wake-up call for all of us.'</p>
