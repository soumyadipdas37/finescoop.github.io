<p>The resident who called the police took a video of people drinking outside at the back of the pub.</p>

<p>'I was concerned at what I saw,' she said. 'There appeared to be a large group of people drinking outside the pub and they looked quite close to each other.</p>

<p>'I felt I had to alert the police in case rules were being broken. I felt it was my public duty to report this and I would do the same again.'</p>

<p>Ms Humphries claimed she hosted a wake for 30 people on behalf of a local resident which started at 10.45am.</p>

<p>'The police called me twice to check that my customers were following the coronavirus rules,' she said.</p>

<p>'I spoke to all of customers to remind them of the rules but we always ensure that the rules are being followed properly at all times. All our customers were in groups of six and spaced apart.</p>

<p>'After the two calls the police just turned up at the pub. They asked us to move some people from the back of the pub to the front to help with social distancing so we did.</p>

<p>'They left satisfied that no rules were being broken.</p>

<p>Police called the pub (pictured) twice and spoke to the landlady Sue Humphries then turned up unannounced to check that the rules were being followed</p>

<p>'The last of the people from the wake left at about 5.30pm. We were a lot less busy after they left.'</p>

<p>Ms Humphries said she reopened the pub on August 1 after lockdown.</p>

<p>The incident came ahead of Oadby and Wigston today being urged to restrict their movements amid a new lockdown in the area. </p>
