<p>Georgina added a caption on the shot reading: 'De la mano, con muchos sueños por cumplir', which translates to: 'Hand in hand, with many dreams to fulfill'.</p>

<p>Georgina and Ronaldo had been isolating with their family - Cristiano Jr, 10, Ronaldo's twins Eva and Mateo, three, and their daughter Alana, two, after relocating from Portugal to Turin in northern Italy. </p>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family isolated together in Madeira, after three of Ronaldo's team-mates - Daniele Rugani, Paulo Dybala and Blaise Matuidi - were among the first Serie A players to test positive novel coronavirus.</p>

<p>They returned to Turin at the start of May and were required to spend 14 days at home in self-isolation as per government rules for international arrivals. </p>

<p>Ripped! Cristiano also shared a sizzling snap as he showcased his sportsman physique </p>

<p>In January, Georgina sparked speculation that she'd tied the knot with her footballer beau when she referred to him as her 'husband' in a gushing post celebrating her 26th birthday.  </p>

<p>Sharing a snapshot of herself and Ronaldo posing with their children, Georgina wrote: 'Happy 2️⃣6️⃣ for me, very happy. I can't ask life more. Just a lot of health for my family and me and to always enjoy them. </p>

<p>'Thank you all for your congratulations, flowers and therefore love ✨ And Thank you to my husband for giving me the best of life, our children. I love you.'</p>

<p>Sweet: Georgina recently shared a sweet tribute to her man as he prepared to go to his first football match since the season was suspended due to COVID-19</p>

<p>In Spanish, 'marido' is often used to describe a common law husband, while 'esposo' is more commonly employed as a description for a legally wed male.</p>

<p>When contacted by MailOnline, representatives for Ronaldo declined to comment.</p>

<p>For his part, Ronaldo shared the same snapshot on his own Instagram account, alongside the caption, in which he shared that he 'love[s] [her] so much'.</p>

<p>The Portuguese sportsman wrote alongside the heartwarming image: 'Congratulations my love! I wish you a very nice day! You are a great woman and an excellent mother for our children. I love you so much honey!'</p>
