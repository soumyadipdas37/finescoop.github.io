<p>The 22-year-old impressed in Norwich's back line last season despite their dismal campaign in the Premier League.</p>

<p>Everton have offered Norwich City £26million to sign their star centre-back Ben Godfrey</p>

<p>Frank Lampard is reluctant to let Tomori leave as he requires additional cover at the back due to the current absence of Antonio Rudiger.</p>

<p>Given a deal between the two clubs would have to be completed before the transfer window closes on October 5, it seems unlikely that Ancelotti will be able to attain his first choice option.  </p>

<p>Manager Carlo Ancelotti sees Godfrey as a good alternative to first choice Fikayo Tomoriin</p>

<p>Frank Lampard is reluctant to sell Tomori as he requires cover for absencent Antonio Rudiger</p>

<p>Everton would, however, have until October 16 to sign Godfrey because of the extended deadline between the top flight and the EFL, according to The Telegraph. </p>

<p>That means Everton could potentially see whether or not they can sign Tomori, before making a decision on Godfrey once the October 5 Premier League deadline has passed. </p>

<p>Godfrey only penned a new deal at Carrow Road last summer and has a contract in place until 2023.</p>

<p>He featured in 30 games in the Premier League last season and played regularly under under Daniel Farke - apart from around the Christmas period when he missed five matches due to a torn knee ligament.  </p>
