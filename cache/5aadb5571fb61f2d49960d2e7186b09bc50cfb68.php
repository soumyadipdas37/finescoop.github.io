<p>Dubbing the video to the upbeat Demi Lovato track Sorry Not Sorry, the star said the simple exercises worked for her as she'd found it 'hard' to exercise since giving birth.</p>

<p>Writing a candid caption she added: 'I have NOT been consistent with working out, finding the time - and energy is hard. </p>

<p>'But when I do, I'm reminded how nourishing moving my body is. And I'm still in awe that it's only been a few months since I pushed an actual baby out.</p>

<p>'Be gentle to yourself and kind to your body. You're doing amazing!!! Also, these moves aren't just for PP they are great for everyBODY.'</p>

<p>Wow: She added a touch of glam with large hoop earrings and kept safe with a face mask as she navigated the steep canyon</p>

<p>It comes after Iskra detailed the 'pressures' of breastfeeding her four-month-old baby son in another candid video. </p>

<p>Iskra admitted there have been times when she's had a 'screaming, hungry baby' while being a 'sobbing mess' as she opened up on her anxieties about the process via Instagram.</p>

<p>The body confidence advocate displayed the various different positions she uses to feed her son alongside a lengthy caption.</p>

<p>'Let's just get to the point. Breastfeeding is hard af!' she wrote. 'And it's not ok that so much pressure is put on women to be able to do it. Or that you won't have the same connection if you can't breastfeed - that is BS. </p>

<p>In shape: The model recently admitted that her exercise regime hasn't been 'consistent' since giving birth four months ago as she gave fans an update on her regime in a video</p>

<p>'It's not 'breast is best' it's 'fed is best'. As I shared before my milk supply dropped completely and it was awful. A screaming hungry baby and I was a sobbing mess.</p>

<p>'I wish I wouldn't have put so much pressure on myself surrounding breast feeding. I wish I had a formula ready that my baby liked, and not been afraid of using it.</p>

<p>'When I tried supplementing with formula it really was the biggest relief and will happily do it whenever we need to. </p>

<p>'So this video is me sharing the positions that have worked for us - best latching and most comfortable.'  </p>
