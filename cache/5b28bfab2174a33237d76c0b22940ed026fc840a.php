<p>Shane Andrew Lunnay, 35, pleaded guilty in the District Court on Tuesday to multiple counts of possessing and controlling child abuse material and importing prohibited goods.</p>

<p>The court heard he was in possession of photographs and videos including some showing children under the age of 14, The Advertiser reported.</p>

<p>Judge Geraldine Davison said Lunnay's obsession with the animated material, called hentai, may have formed a 'foundation' for his use of child abuse material.</p>

<p>Adelaide man and YouTube gamer Shane Andrew Lunnay, 35, (pictured) pleaded guilty to possessing child abuse material and importing prohibited goods </p>

<p>'Is this another example, perhaps, that one shouldn't consider that anime, or hentai material, is harmless, victimless,' she said.</p>

<p>She described his bedroom as a 'fantasy world' with posters of young animated girls plastered on every wall. </p>

<p>The YouTube gamer was not directly charged for live-streaming himself having sex with what appeared to be a doll while aware children were watching him.  </p>

<p>His lawyer, Andrew Culshaw, conceded his client lived in an 'unhealthy, deviant and illegal fantasy world' but he has since sought therapy. </p>

<p>Prosecutor Pantelia Marinakis told the court Lunnay had confessed to a psychologist he had no interest in child exploitation material. </p>

<p>He would use his YouTube channel, Radical Dreamer Shane-O, to post clips of himself playing video games and talking about his collections. </p>

<p>The 35-year-old is due to be sentenced in late September. </p>
