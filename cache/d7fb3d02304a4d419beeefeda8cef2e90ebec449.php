<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service has apologised for taking two hours to respond to the Manchester Arena terror attack.</p>

<p>At the public inquiry into the attack on Wednesday, the service blamed 'silence' from the police on the night of the bombing which led fire service bosses to assume there was a continuing marauding terror strike and so firefighters were kept back.</p>

<p>But they pointed to an infamous terror training exercise at the Trafford Centre some 12 months before the Arena attack where there was an almost identical communications failure which delayed firefighters and paramedics reaching the scene for 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Salman Abedi (pictured) killed himself and 22 innocent people when he detonated a huge bomb in his backpack as concert-goers were leaving an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena on May 22, 2017. Hundreds of others were also seriously injured.</p>

<p>The revelations emerged on day 13 of the Manchester Arena public inquiry as organisations involved in the aftermath, including the emergency services, continued to make opening statements to the chairman, Sir John Saunders.</p>

<p>Salman Abedi killed himself and 22 innocent people when he detonated a huge bomb in his backpack as concert-goers were leaving an Ariana Grande concert at the Arena on May 22, 2017. Hundreds of others were also seriously injured.</p>

<p>Abedi's brother Hashem has been jailed for life and must serve a minimum 55 years behind bars for helping his sibling source chemicals for the bomb and prepare for the attack.</p>

<p>Andrew Warnock QC, representing Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) on behalf of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, said: 'In relation to the fire service response on the night, we say at the outset that GMFRS accepts and agrees with the conclusions of the fire and rescue expert... that its initial actions in response to the Arena bombing were neither adequate nor effective.</p>

<p>'It is unacceptable that it took over two hours for the fire and rescue service to attend the Arena.</p>

<p>'On behalf of GMFRS we would like to say to the families and victims that we are sorry that this happened.</p>

<p>'The inquiry will hear evidence from many individual GMFRS witnesses who still have profound feelings of frustration and deep anguish that they were not there to help.</p>

<p>'It is important that the reasons for that failing are fully investigated. GMFRS would like the chairman and the families to know that it welcomes the aim of this inquiry to get to the truth of what happened on the evening of the attack and to scrutinise whether the measures GMFRS has put in place since the attack are sufficient to protect Manchester into the future.'</p>

<p>Mr Warnock admitted: 'There were failures in communication, in particular with other agencies and their control rooms.'</p>

<p>He went on that there was 'an unforeseen gap in incident command... delaying these difficulties being solved as quickly as they might have been'.</p>

<p>The QC admitted there was 'a lack of situational awareness' from the fire service due to communication problems on the night.</p>

<p>Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service has apologised for taking two hours to respond to the Manchester Arena terror attack at the public inquiry into the attack three years ago</p>

<p>The response of the fire service 'was driven by a misinformed and skewed understanding of what was happening'.</p>

<p>He said: 'The information relayed to key GMFRS personnel, combined with their assumptions as to what a terror attack would likely involve, led them to assume that the bomb was one part of an on-going terrorist attack of a type which had recently incurred in the UK, continental Europe and elsewhere.</p>

<p>'Silence from partner agencies as the night went on fed the assumption that the police were dealing with an on-going armed threat.'</p>

<p>He added: 'No responsible fire officer could send unarmed and unprotected personnel into what they understood to be an ongoing gun or bomb attack and, indeed to do so would have been contrary to the established guidance for dealing with such incidents.</p>

<p>Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi (pictured) was brought to the attention of M15 on at least 18 occasions before the 2017 terror attack, a public inquiry has heard</p>

<p>'However, the understanding itself was - it is now known - completely wrong.'</p>

<p>The QC pointed to an infamous training drill at the Trafford Centre in May 2016 which replicated a marauding terrorist attack.</p>

<p>Police chiefs had to apologise when the man playing the suicide bomber shouted 'Allahu Akbar' as he 'detonated' his fake bomb at the beginning of the drill, which was filmed by the media.</p>

<p>At the Arena inquiry, Mr Warnock said: 'We would like the bereaved families to know that prior to the attack GMFRS had taken the risk of terrorist attacks and the need to respond to mass casualty events extremely seriously.</p>

<p>'That it had done so makes it all the more disappointing for all involved that the organisation's response fell so far short when the Manchester Arena bomb happened.'</p>

<p>He said police were supposed to declare Operation Plato, where there is suspected to be a marauding terrorist, during the Trafford Centre training exercise, named Winchester Accord, which would then have triggered a response from the fire and ambulance services.</p>

<p>Mr Warnock said said neither the fire service nor specialist ambulance crews received any contact from GMP during the drill and that 'attempts to contact the police commanders proved unsuccessful'.</p>

<p>The enquiry heard that Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service accepts and agrees with the conclusions of the fire and rescue expert and that 'its initial actions in response to the Arena bombing in May 2017 were neither adequate nor effective'</p>

<p>The QC said: 'The result was a delay of at least one-and-a-half hours in both the fire and ambulances services being deployed to the Trafford Centre.'</p>

<p>The QC said: 'There are obvious, striking, parallels with what happened on the night of the Arena incident.</p>

<p>'One difference being that ambulance personnel did reach the Arena, but largely it seems by reason of the fact that Paramedic Ennis self-deployed and gained early situational awareness for that agency.</p>

<p>'It has been suggested that experiences such as these gave rise to negative expectations on the part of some GMFRS personnel about what could be expected of the police.</p>

<p>'That evidence will be explored by the inquiry, but it would be wrong to conclude that this led GMFRS to be defeatist and simply resign itself to non-compliance with... principles by the police.</p>

<p>'On the contrary, GMFRS acted proactively to address these issues in the aftermath of Winchester Accord.'</p>
