<p>A pensioner who bashed a pregnant Muslim mother and stomped on her head said he attacked because she wouldn't 'give him a dollar' and she 'could afford it'. </p>

<p>Rana Elasmar was with friends at dessert café Bay Vista Parramatta in Sydney's west in November 2019 when she was brutally set upon while 38 weeks pregnant.    </p>

<p>Sickening CCTV showed Stipe Lozina, 43, dragging Ms Elasmar, 32, to the ground before he began stomping on her head and repeatedly kicking her.</p>

<p>Lozina, who has a long history of mental health issues, pleaded guilty to the unprovoked attack and appeared via video in the Parramatta District Court on Monday.</p>

<p>The court heard he told a prison psychologist the attack was Mrs Elasmar's fault, The Daily Telegraph reported. </p>

<p>'She should've just given me the dollar, she could afford it,' Lozina told the psychologist. </p>

<p>Ms Elasmar, who was wearing a hijab at the time, said the man first asked for money before assaulting her and yelling 'you Muslims wrecked my mum'</p>

<p>Lozina told the court he did not like Muslims because a member of the Islamic community 'raped my mother'.</p>

<p>He also said Muslims were 'burning priests alive in Bosnia'.</p>

<p>'I don't hate them but I don't get along with them, I don't do business with them,' he said.</p>

<p>He then engaged in a bizarre exchange with crown prosecutor Sara Gul, first asking if she was Filipino, calling her 'dumb' and refusing to answer several direct questions about whether he hated Muslims. </p>

<p>Lozina, who has committed 28 violent crimes and threats since 1997, represented himself after refusing legal aid.</p>

<p>He agreed he should in a psychiatric ward.</p>

<p>'I'm too violent, I drink, I am a smoker,' he said.</p>

<p>Rana Elasmar, 32, was 38-weeks' pregnant when Stipe 'Steven' Lozina approached her, punched her several times and then stomped on her head</p>

<p>Elasmar told the court on Tuesday she deliberately turned her abdomen away from her attacker and prayed for God to protect her child.</p>

<p>'If nobody intervened, I could have been killed,' the mother-of-four said, tearing up.</p>

<p>'I remember thinking - hit my head as long as you don't touch my baby.'</p>

<p>She told 9 News outside court on Tuesday that the 'first thing that you think of as a mother [is to] protect your baby.' </p>

<p>Ms Elasmar, who was wearing a hijab at the time, said the man first asked for money before assaulting her and yelling 'you Muslims wrecked my mum'. </p>

<p>'No woman should excuse a man of such behaviour - it is our right to decide what do with our bodies,' she said.</p>

<p>'Islamophobia needs to end. Violence against women needs to stop.'</p>

<p>'If you feel the right to physically or verbally abuse someone because they look a bit different than you, Australia isn't the right country for you.' </p>

<p>Bay Vista cafe in Parramatta, in Sydney's west, where Lozina beat the mother-of-four</p>

<p>Following the vicious attack, the bruised woman could not chew her food and suffered lingering migraines and headaches.</p>

<p>She vowed to use her experience to help end violence against women.</p>

<p>'Unless we take a stand and voice our opinions, nothing is going to change.' </p>

<p>Lozina, who appeared before Judge Christopher Craigie said he attacked Ms Elasmar because she did not give him money.</p>

<p>The offender also said he was a 'chronic paranoid schizophrenic' and that he felt remorseful for what happened. </p>

<p>Ms Gul told the court Lozina had also been convicted of verbally abusing two Muslim women at a shopping centre six weeks prior to his assault of Ms Elasmar.</p>

<p>Judge Craigie said the attack was 'wicked and deplorable' and that the matter was 'one of the more difficult cases' he had faced in a long time.</p>

<p>'You have no lawyer, you are obviously unwell, and committed a very serious offence, which rightfully appals people,' he said.</p>

<p>Lozina, who pleaded guilty in June to assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Ms Elasmar, will next face court on October 1.</p>
