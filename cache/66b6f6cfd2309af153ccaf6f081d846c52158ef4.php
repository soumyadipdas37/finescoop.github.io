<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro's attempt to access £800million worth of gold stored in the Bank of England's vaults has been heard by the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>The controversial leader wants to sell the assets but has been blocked on the grounds that his government is not recognised by the UK. </p>

<p>Maduro - reelected in a controversial ballot in 2018 which most opposition parties boycotted - says the bullion can help cash-starved Venezuela fight coronavirus.</p>

<p>Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro wants to sell £800m worth of gold stored in the Bank of England's vaults but has been blocked on grounds his government is not recognised by the UK</p>

<p>But in a previous ruling, a High Court judge said the Bank could not lawfully release the gold to Maduro because the UK recognises his rival, Juan Guaido, as the country's leader.</p>

<p>Guaido has asked the bank not to hand the assets over because, he argued, it would be used for corrupt purposes. </p>

<p>But the High Court's ruling is being appealed by Maduro's laywers, who say the UK has given 'de facto' recognition to his government even though it officially recognises Guaido.</p>

<p>The Banco Central de Venezuela also claims the case raises issues of international law, which forbids the interference by any country in the internal affairs of another.</p>

<p>Sarosh Zaiwalla, its board solicitor, said it could also present 'a further threat to the international perception of English institutions as being free from political interference'.</p>
