<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Harry Kane has been left hugely impressed by Mason Greenwood in England training, hailing the international newbie as a 'real top finisher'.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old has been called up to the Three Lions senior squad for the first time after an exciting breakthrough season for Manchester United in the 2019-20 campaign. </p>

<p>Greenwood could make his debut in England's Nations League double-header against Iceland and Denmark but faces competition from a host of other England names such as Kane, Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho and Danny Ings for the starting spot.</p>

<p>But according to England captain Kane, the teenager has done his starting chances no harm with a string of impressive displays in training so far.</p>

<p>‘Mason’s been great since the first training session we had. You can tell he’s full of confidence as a player, not afraid to shoot, not afraid to take players on and that’s exactly what we want,’ the Tottenham striker said at a press conference on Friday afternoon. </p>

<p>‘He’s obviously done great for his club in the period after lockdown especially and it’s great to have him in the team. </p>

<p>Greenwood received his first call-up after his breakthrough season for Manchester United</p>

<p>‘As a goalscorer, people use the phrase “natural goalscorer” and I guess it’s just one of those things you work on a lot, being in the right place at the right time. </p>

<p>‘Some of it is just instinct, balls dropping to you in the box and being able to finish it. </p>

<p>Greenwood was in fine goalscoring form for the Red Devils last season, nailing down a regular starting spot in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side after lockdown and scoring 16 goals in all competitions.</p>

<p>The United academy product showed his capability to score goals of all kind and with both feet, something Kane thinks shows he is the complete package. </p>

<p>The 18-year-old could be in line to make his senior international debut on Saturday</p>

<p>Kane has praised the teenager's ability to score goals of any kind during their training sessions</p>

<p>‘But I guess looking at him in the short time we’ve spent together, it’s all different types of finishes, whether it’s left foot or right foot, inside of the foot, powerful shots – I think that shows a real complete goalscorer, when you can score in any situation. </p>

<p>‘Obviously it’s only been a short space of time but he definitely looks like a real top finisher and we look forward to having him in squads to come because he’s still very young.’ </p>

<p>Greenwood is one of five uncapped players called up by manager Gareth Southgate along with Phil Foden, Kalvin Phillips, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Jack Grealish.</p>

<p>Southgate's men face Iceland on Saturday in Reykjavík before travelling to Copenhagen to face Denmark on Tuesday. </p>
