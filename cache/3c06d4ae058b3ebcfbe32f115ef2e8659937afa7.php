<p>Sir Philip Green's £100 million superyacht has been quarantined in Monaco with his wife on board.</p>

<p>Two crewmen on the 300ft Lionheart have tested positive and its yellow flag has been flying in Port Hercules to signify the vessel bears the contagion.</p>

<p>Lady Tina Green, 71, told The Sun that she was on board the luxury boat, but did not reveal whether Sir Philip or their 29-year-old daughter Chloe were with her.</p>

<p>'After maintenance in Italy, the boat returned to Monaco. We were meant to go on a cruise with my family,' Lady Tina said.</p>

<p>'It was my responsibility to have the whole crew tested before leaving. We then discovered two cases - one asymptomatic and the other with a sore throat.</p>

<p>'The two have been confined to the cabin ever since. The rest and myself are on the boat. Everyone is well.'</p>

<p>Topshop boss Sir Philip – who furloughed 14,500 staff in April – was last spotted lounging on the yacht three weeks ago on the French Riviera.</p>

<p>The colossal boat, replete with helipad, pool, 15 crew cabins and room for 12 guests, is where the 68-year-old has conducted much of his business for the last two years.</p>

<p>When not at sea, Sir Philip lives at his £20million Roccabella penthouse in Monaco.</p>

<p>Sir Philip has faced repeated calls to lose his knighthood over his involvement in a string of controversies.</p>

<p>Last year, a member of the House of Lords claimed the businessman had 'multiple' grievance claims against him. Green denied all the claims.</p>

<p>The allegations were revealed by Lord Hain, who last year used the cloak of parliamentary privilege to identify the Topshop boss as the person behind a legal injunction preventing the Daily Telegraph from publishing allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse.</p>

<p>The claims, which Sir Philip 'categorically and wholly denied', included allegations that the retail tycoon dragged a woman around in a headlock and smashed a male employee's mobile phone.</p>

<p>It was also claimed that he mocked a male employee's dreadlocks and referred to him 'throwing spears in the jungle'.</p>

<p>Sir Philip also faced allegations that he groped a female executive, paying her more than £1million to stay quiet.</p>

<p>He has not been to Britain since the claims surfaced in October 2018 and has run the Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop, from Monaco.</p>

<p>Green enjoyed almost two decades of ruling the high street after lucrative takeovers of BHS in 2000 and Arcadia in 2002.</p>

<p>The collapse of BHS - less than a year after he sold it for £1 - plunged Green into even more controversy.</p>

<p>Arcadia was in trouble even before the current coronavirus crisis. It recorded an operating loss of £138m on turnover of £1.8bn in 2018.</p>

<p>Last year Arcadia carried out an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement to cut rents and close some shops.</p>
