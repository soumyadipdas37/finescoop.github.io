<p>And it seems Sonia Kruger will continue to dominate the network's prime time schedule by fronting Seven's mini golf-themed game show, Holey Moley.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old will be front and centre on the competitive series next year, along with sportscaster Matt Shirvington, golf legend Greg Norman and actor Rob Riggle.</p>

<p>TV takeover: Channel Seven has announced that Sonia Kruger (pictured) will host mini golf show Holey Moley - meaning she is the face of three prime time programs </p>

<p>'The golf is taken seriously, but the course is seriously kooky,' Sonia told The Daily Telegraph of the 'refreshingly new, utterly unique and completely bonkers' show.</p>

<p>'It's either going to be the funniest sports show in the world, or the sportiest comedy, either way it's a crime that I get to call this work,' she added. </p>

<p>The 'kooky' obstacle course on Holey Moley will be its biggest feature.</p>

<p>Third time's the charm! Sonia already hosts Big Brother on Channel Seven, and was recently announced as the presenter of The Voice (pictured on set)</p>

<p>Exciting: 'The golf is taken seriously, but the course is seriously kooky,' Sonia told The Daily Telegraph of the 'refreshingly new, utterly unique and completely bonkers' show</p>

<p>If it's anything like the U.S. version, Holey Moley will be filled with supersized windmills for participants to run thorough, rolling logs for them to jump over and a pretend ski slope to climb up.</p>

<p>Water pits, fire flames and screaming Army marshals are also featured in the American series as participants try to maneuver their way from start to finish.</p>

<p>Sonia will replace actress Olympia Valance, who had been recruited by Seven earlier this year to host the show and Australia's Got Talent, but was unable to make it because of COVID-19 travel restrictions. </p>

<p>What to expect: If it's anything like the U.S. version, Holey Moley will be filled with supersized windmills for participants to run thorough (pictured), rolling logs for them to jump over and a pretend ski slope to climb up</p>

<p>Sonia, Matt and Rob have spent the past two weeks quarantining in Queensland to start filming Holey Moley from Thursday.</p>

<p>Greg remains in the U.S. and will appear on the show via segments filmed abroad.</p>

<p>Seven had initially planned to film Holey Moley on a large custom-built set in the U.S., but these plans changed due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Dream team: Sonia will be front and centre on the competitive series next year, along with sportscaster Matt Shirvington (left), golf legend Greg Norman and actor Rob Riggle (right)</p>

<p>Holey Moley will now be filmed on a property in Cleveland, in Brisbane's south-east, because of Queensland low infection rate. </p>

<p>The course has been created by production company Eureka. </p>

<p>The show will comprise children, aged between eight and 12 years, and adults. Filming will take place over a period of two weeks.  </p>
