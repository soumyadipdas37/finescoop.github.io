<p>Candid: Perrie Edwards has admitted she wishes that social media 'didn't exist' as she describes the networking platforms as a 'blessing and a curse'</p>

<p>She said: 'There isn't too much about it that's decent. I just wish it never existed.'</p>

<p>Explaining her sense of 'guilt', when she doesn't post however, Perrie said: 'I feel guilty when I don't post enough. I feel bad for our fans that do want to see us post. It's trying to find a balance.' </p>

<p>'When I wake up I've got a little ban on my phone so I can't get on it past 10 am. It's actually really good because then you're not obsessed over it. Social media is a blessing and a curse. For us it's such a big platform and hugely beneficial.'   </p>

<p>Jesy - who has been open about her experiences at the hands of cruel online trolls - feels that the group are 'a lot better' with social media than in the past.</p>

<p>Tips: The Little Mix star, 27, also revealed how she combats becoming 'obsessed' with Instagram during an appearance on BBC Breakfast</p>

<p>She said: 'I think we're a lot better with social media than what we used to be. I think we're not on it as much as we used to be, we're not as obsessed with it. </p>

<p>'I can't be on it all the time because I know, for me, mentally it's not good. I admire people who don't have social media. I think it's so refreshing when I meet people that don't have it.' </p>

<p>The band released a video for their latest single Holiday last month, in which Perrie accessorises in a stunning bubble-inspired headpiece that she recently shared a snap of with her fans.</p>
