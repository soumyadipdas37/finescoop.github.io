<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Anthony Joshua has taken a swipe at heavyweight rival Tyson Fury by claiming he 'should be looking to retire soon'.</p>

<p>The pair are hoping to clash in a highly-anticipated mega-fight next year that would see the winner crowed as undisputed champion, with both fighters holding all five world title belts between them.</p>

<p>And Joshua says he is 'here and ready' to share a ring with Fury, claiming it might be time for him to call it a day after turning professional 12 years ago. </p>

<p>Anthony Joshua has taken aim at Tyson Fury, saying his rival should be looking to retire soon</p>

<p>Joshua is hoping to face the Gypsy King in an all-British undisputed title fight next year </p>

<p>Joshua told Sky Sports: ''Fury has been professional much longer than me. He should be looking to retire soon.</p>

<p>'If he wants to cement his legacy, I'm here and ready. I've built myself into this position.'</p>

<p>The IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO champion has enjoyed a fairytale rise to the top of boxing having savoured wins over Dillian Whyte, Wladimir Klitschko Joseph Parker and Alexander Povetkin.</p>

<p>And while the British star is eager to prove his worth by fighting WBC champion Fury and Deontay Wilder, he insists his record proves that he has faced stronger opponents. </p>

<p>The Watford-born star claims he is 'here and ready' for a mega bout with Fury in 2021</p>

<p>The pair drummed up excitement about a contest after meeting in Marbella this summer</p>

<p>'I'll challenge Fury, I'll challenge Wilder,' he said. 'These guys aren't the biggest names that I've fought on my record anyway. They are just another heavyweight.</p>

<p>'Look at my record. They are not the best fighters that I have challenged. When they are ready, I'm here to fight.'</p>

<p>Joshua had a whirlwind year in 2019 as he suffered a shock stoppage loss to Andy Ruiz Jr last summer before winning his titles back in the rematch in Saudi Arabia. </p>

<p>He won gold at the 2012 Olympics in London before quickly turning professional the following year - becoming a world champion three years later. Joshua said he was on 'a different journey to Fury' but had no fear of facing him. </p>

<p>Joshua believes he has fought stronger opponents than Fury and insists he does not fear him </p>

<p>'I came up quick,' he added. 'That shows I'm ready. These boys turned professional in 2008 and it took [Fury seven years] to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. He's on a completely different journey. I want to steam through.</p>

<p>'I haven't got fear of Fury - whether he's got a better chin than me, a better jab than me, whether he's all of this stuff that people say. So be it. Let me go in there and prove myself. Show you who I am and what I can do.</p>

<p>'I've fought five champions and been in two unification fights. I'm a two-time heavyweight champion in the space of 24 fights and a [seven-year] career. It shows you I am serious.</p>

<p>The four-belt world champion must first see off the challenge of Kubrat Pulev later this year </p>

<p>'If Fury is serious, I'll take that fight seriously too.'</p>

<p>Both Joshua and Fury have obstacles to get past if they are to set up a clash next year. The Watford-born star has a mandatory fight against Kubrat Pulev, which still does not have a designated venue after their April bout at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was postponed. </p>

<p>Fury, meanwhile, must see off Deontay Wilder in their trilogy fight, slated for later this year in the US. </p>
