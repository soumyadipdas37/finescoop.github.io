<p>Paedophile Rolf Harris has been seen in public for the first time since he turned 90 during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>The disgraced entertainer was spotted taking his dog for a walk in Bray in Berkshire.</p>

<p>Harris was seen carrying a wooden walking stick with him as he took his dog for a stroll.</p>

<p>Wearing a blue shirt, green vest, beige trousers and sandals for his outing, Harris looked a frail figure.</p>

<p>The 90-year-old lives with his wife Alwen Hughes at their home in Berkshire where he has been placed under 'house arrest' by his family following a 'disastrous incident'.</p>

<p>Last year, Harris entered the grounds of  Oldfield Primary School and waved at pupils.</p>

<p>Wearing a blue shirt, green vest, beige trousers and sandals for his outing, Harris looked a frail figure</p>

<p>Richard Jarrett, head of Oldfield Primary School, said Harris had no access to the pupils and ordered him off the grounds before informing the police.</p>

<p>But neighbours at the time defended him, saying: 'He's an asset to the area, he's been a tremendous supporter of any charity we've been part of.'</p>

<p>Another said the incident had an adverse effect on his health, saying: 'It's badly affected him; he's in poor health and has declined rapidly. He doesn't come out any more and when he does it's only ever with his carer.'</p>

<p>Harris was convicted of 12 indecent assaults at Southwark Crown Court in June 2014, and was sentenced to six years behind bars.</p>

<p>Harris was seen carrying a wooden walking stick with him as he took his dog for a stroll near his home in Bray, Berkshire</p>

<p>The assaults include one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens, and a catalogue of abuse against his daughter's friend of over 16 years.</p>

<p>Some of the offences had been carried out while his daughter was in the same room. He admitted having a relationship with the woman, but said it only started when she reached 18. </p>

<p>However, he was released from HMP Stafford on parole in May 2017 after serving just three years of his sentence. </p>

<p>During his time behind bars he was hospitalised after his diabetes spiralled out of control. </p>

<p>Of the 12 convictions, one was overturned on appeal in November 2017, and a jury chose not to convict him in two additional cases in the same year. </p>
