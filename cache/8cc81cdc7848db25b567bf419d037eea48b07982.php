<p>Last month, Alexandradeclared she's 'proud of my body and the skin I'm in' in a candid post shared to Instagram.</p>

<p>The singer showcased her toned figure as she slipped into black lingerie by Lounge Underwear in a photo taken weeks before.</p>

<p>Months after revealing she was once told to lighten her complexion, the artist admitted she was apprehensive about uploading the radiant photo to social media at first, but later found the courage to be confident and embrace her 'blemishes'.</p>

<p>The brave media personality wrote in the accompanying caption: 'Scrolling through my phone and found this picture I took a few weeks ago...</p>

<p>Comfy: Another picture showed a stunning lunchtime set-up she had with a giant balloon arch and massive heart shaped cushions to sit on</p>

<p>'I wasn’t going to post it because I’m quick to put myself down... I’m finding that mental space to remind myself that i’m proud of my body and the skin I’m in.. blemishes and all... bring it on... ❤️.' (sic)</p>

<p>Alexandra's bold post came after she made an emotional revelation that she was told to bleach her skin after she won The X Factor in 2008.</p>

<p>The musician spoke in a candid Instagram video in which she said she was told she would have to work 'ten times harder than a white artist'.</p>

<p>The Islington native, who is of Jamaican descent, also delved into the 'microagressions' she experienced from various music labels throughout her career and how she has struggled.</p>

<p>A photo to remember: She showed off another staircase set-up which was covered in pink balloons as her pals posed for a snap</p>

<p>Every angle: She was so in love with the set-up, that she took lots of photos </p>

<p>The TV star, who was visibly shaken, explained: 'The music industry is such a funny little place. I love signing, I love what I do but if it wasn't for the love that I have for music I definitely wouldn't be in this industry.</p>

<p>'A few reasons are, when I won the X Factor I was told, ''Right, because you are black, you are going to have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin...</p>

<p>'You can't have braids, you can't have an afro, you can't have anything that basically is my identity, you have to have hair, for example, that appeals to white people so they can understand you better.''</p>

<p>'That was so hard to digest. I was told to bleach my skin and that was something I refused to do.'</p>

<p>'Blemishes and all, bring it on!' Alexandra recently declared she's 'proud of my body and the skin I'm in' as she slipped into a Lounge Underwear set for a candid Instagram post </p>
