<p>Too much: An average 5.4 million viewers tuned in to watch Des however some fans were deterred by the chilling details of his crimes which included necrophilia and dismemberment</p>

<p>Dennis, who died at the age of 74 in 2018 at HMP Full Sutton, 34 years into his life sentence, is believed to have killed as many as 15 gay men, most of them homeless, at his homes in north London suburbs Cricklewood and Muswell Hill.</p>

<p>During his killing spree, Dennis would befriend his subjects in pubs and bars in London before luring them into his flat, where he would murder them and sit with their corpses before dismembering them.</p>

<p>His crimes were discovered when a drain outside his home on Cranley Gardens, Muswell Hill, became blocked by human remains that he had tried to flush away.  </p>

<p>Dennis was jailed for life with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 25 years in 1983, on six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. The sentence was later upgraded to a whole-life tariff.   </p>

<p>Shocking: Dennis (pictured) who died at the age of 74 in 2018 at HMP Full Sutton, 34 years into his life sentence, is believed to have killed as many as 15 gay men at his homes in north London</p>
