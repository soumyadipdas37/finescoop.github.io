<p>Biologist Vladimir Burkanov says that so far this fur seal on Tyuleny Island - nicknamed The Ugly Duckling - has not become a total outcast, yet there are signs of it being slightly shunned.</p>

<p>'This pup looks well fed and was very active, so its mother clearly gave it plenty of milk,' he said.</p>

<p>'Other seals don't pay too much attention to it in a somewhat worrying manner, so something is not quite right with it.</p>

<p>The seal is believed to have poor eyesight and Dr Burkanov is doubtful the seal will successfully breed</p>

<p>'But it is not getting chased or bitten.'</p>

<p>If it is rejected, wildlife specialists are ready to rescue the mammal and hand it to a dolphinarium.</p>

<p>A similar looking male fur seal is known to have matured Severo-Zapadnoe rookery on Bering Island and is now five or six years old.</p>

<p>If it is rejected, wildlife specialists are ready to rescue the mammal and hand it to a dolphinarium</p>

<p>'He did not participate in reproduction this season and was seen on the bachelor section of the rookery only,' said the biologist.</p>

<p>'Perhaps, this is the first documented case of the survival of a northern fur seal of an abnormal colour to adulthood.'</p>

<p>But in a case in 2011, an ostocised ginger fur seal called Nafanya - also from Tyuleny Island, a breeding ground for the species - had to be rescued and was flown to Sochi Dolphinarium on the Black Sea.</p>
