<p>The boss of Knightsbridge Japanese restaurant Nozomi has been ordered to perform 100 hours of unpaid work after he continued to manage a company while disqualified.</p>

<p>Marios Georgallides, 62, oversaw the celebrity eatery near Harrods in central London while banned from acting as the company director. </p>

<p>The fashionable restaurant opened to much fanfare in 2005 and has welcomed celebrities such as Rihanna and Lindsey Lohan through its doors. </p>

<p>Georgallides was banned from acting as a company director for 12 years in 2016 after taking on the role while already disqualified, failing to pay debts of £1.3million and abusing a company's banking facilities.   </p>

<p>He had already been slapped with a six-year ban in February 2010 preventing him from running the business.</p>

<p>But Georgallides ignored the order and continued to sign over 1,200 cheques for Nozomi, many of which bounced, according to the Insolvency Service.</p>

<p>The businessman, from Highgate in north London, has now admitted three counts of using a prohibited company name and a further count of taking part of the promotion, formation or management of a company whilst disqualified.</p>

<p>He was given a 12-month community order and ordered to undertake 100 hours of unpaid work at Southwark Crown Court.</p>

<p>A further disqualification from serving as a company director was handed which will run concurrently with his existing one.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Valerie Charbit told the court: 'He used a prohibited company name when barred from doing so, on three occasions, and ... he was involved in the management of a company whilst disqualified. </p>

<p>'These are all criminal offences.'</p>

<p>In 2009, Nozomi was taken over by Eastzest - a company Georgallides had resigned from several months earlier.</p>

<p>Ms Charbit added: 'Mr Georgallides used the company to carry out the business of Nozomi restaurant and obviously he was prohibited from doing so.' </p>

<p>Georgallides owes nearly £1.5million to his creditors, including some of his own money which he had invested in the business.</p>

<p>Richard Whittam, defending, said that the 'jingoistic press statement' the insolvency service had issued in 2015 had resulted in 'punishing' publicity against his client.</p>

<p>'The last alleged offending, even if it had been dealt with in the company court, is nine years ago,' said Mr Whittam.</p>

<p>'Significantly, no other offences have been prosecuted. No offences of fraud, not offences having an element of dishonesty.'</p>

<p>The fashionable restaurant opened to much fanfare in 2005 and has welcomed celebrities such as Rihanna and Lindsey Lohan through its doors</p>

<p>Mr Whittam added that Georgallides had lost £70,000 of his own money that he had invested in the companies.</p>

<p>His wife had to put their north London house down as a security to pay the debt, added Mr Whittam.</p>

<p>The businessman who was held in 'high regard' in his community also suffered from a number of health issues, said Mr Whittam. </p>

<p>In 2012, bailiffs turned up at Georgallides's £4million Highgate home to demand payment for an overdue driving penalty after he performed an illegal u-turn in Ponders End. </p>

<p>Judge David Tomlinson said he had found no evidence Georgallides had been dishonest.</p>

<p>'You will not be able to play the role of a company director until you are 70 years old at least,' he said. 'I take account that you lost money in regards to two of these companies.' </p>

<p>The prosecution will now bring confiscation proceedings against him.</p>

<p>The Insolvency Service said in its statement released in November 2015: 'Eastzest Ltd took over the trading of the Knightsbridge Japanese restaurant, Nozomi, in July 2009 with Marcello Santese as it's only recorded director, Georgallides having resigned as a director in March 2009.</p>

<p>'However, the overwhelming evidence showed he remained in control as a director throughout its trading until liquidation on 8 June 2011.</p>

<p>'Mr Georgallides had previously been disqualified as a director for six years in February 2010 but retained ownership through various family trusts and remained a signatory to the bank account until March 2011, when the bank discovered his disqualification.</p>

<p>'During that period, Mr Georgallides signed over 1,200 cheques.</p>

<p>'At liquidation, the company owed nearly £1.3million to HMRC in relation to arrears of VAT, PAYE and National Insurance Contributions having only paid £111,500 of the debt due during trading.</p>

<p>'During its trading period, the company issued cheques and direct debit payments which were not met on 1,065 occasions with a total value of £1,018,068, incurring £29,700 in bank charges.'</p>

<p>Mark Bruce, Chief Investigator with the Insolvency Service, had said: 'Mr Georgallides effectively ignored his first disqualification and carried on as the main director of this prestigious restaurant.</p>

<p>'He must have realised during the trial, that the weight of evidence was heavily against him and threw in the towel.</p>

<p>'I was involved in the investigation of his previous companies and Mr Georgallides has a repeated history of non-payment of his various companies' debts and abuse of the banking facilities.</p>

<p>'He displays exactly the sort of behaviour that gives some directors a bad name and a 12 year ban reflects how serious the insolvency service views his attitude to business.'</p>
