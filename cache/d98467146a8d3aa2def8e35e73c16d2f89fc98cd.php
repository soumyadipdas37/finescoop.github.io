<p>Other signs read 'smiles not masks' and 'the great reset = digital slavery.' Thousands of protesters flocked to Trafalgar Square on Saturday</p>

<p>Signs reading 'Covid cure: Strict 90-day TV-free diet' and 'we can choose' were clutched by demonstrators as they marched in London </p>

<p>A massive crowd of people took to the streets of London during the protest on August 29. They clutched various signs as they marched to Westminster</p>

<p>The Unite for Freedom rally started at noon in the capital and they demonstrators marched past Downing Street towards the Houses of Parliament. </p>

<p>Pictures from the demonstration showed Trafalgar Square packed with protesters - none of whom wore masks - holding signs that branded the pandemic as a 'hoax'.  </p>

<p>Other signs claimed masks reduce immunity and likened the restrictions to 'child torture'. One person held a homemade placard on which he had scrawled 'no to mandatory vaccines.' </p>

<p>David Icke attended yesterday's protest and urged police to 'stop serving the psychopaths' and join those protesting in a speech addressing the cheering crowd.  </p>

<p>Video from the scene showed organisers label the Government 'terrorists who are waging a war on the people of this country'. </p>

<p>One man says: 'This is a political agenda to commit mass genocide on the population. That is their agenda.' </p>

<p>A poster advertising the event read: 'Nothing is more important as time is very short - the Government are voting for a two-year extension of their emergency Covid-19 powers in September 2020.</p>

<p>'The first six months was a disaster - this must not be allowed to continue! We have to take a stand.'</p>

<p>Protesters take part in a demonstration organised by a group called 'Stand Up X'. Participants clutch signs reading: 'Police choose your side'</p>

<p>Huge crowd of anti-vaxxers  joined Jeremy Corbyn's brother and David Icke in Trafalgar Square before marching on the Houses of Parliament</p>

<p>It lists its priorities as 'no more lockdowns, no social distancing, no masks. No track and trace, no health passports. No mandatory vaccinations, no 'new normal'. Restore all human rights that have been violated.'</p>

<p>The poster lists 'top world class doctors and nurses speaking out with real truth on Covid-19 against GMC constraints'. </p>

<p>Mr Corbyn was arrested on May 16 after he used a megaphone to say 'vaccination is not necessary' and '5G towers will be installed everywhere', adding: '5G enhances anyone who's got illness from Covid, so they work together.' </p>

<p>There is no evidence to link 5G and Covid-19 and scientists fear that a rise in measles among children can be attributed in part to unfounded fears about vaccines.</p>

<p>He was then arrested again on May 30 at a protest in which he also spoke through a megaphone. </p>
