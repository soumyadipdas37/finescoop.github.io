<p>Michelle didn't attend the demonstration, but in recent weeks she has been sharing several workout and cycling videos to her Instagram Stories with Mark.</p>

<p>She recently admitted she loved the lockdown period because it gave her and Mark the opportunity to spend quality time together, walking their dogs, doing jigsaws and cycling near their Essex home.</p>

<p>The experience also gave the actress the opportunity to start writing her own material and she has already had interest from production companies about potentially developing her projects. </p>

<p>She said in a recent interview with Cosmopolitan magazine: 'We [Mark and I] were saying we'd enjoyed it. It's been nice because we've both been working from home.</p>

<p>'Normally we could be out all day or I have to go to Manchester [to film Brassic] or Mark is in London. I'm taking my dogs for daily walks, I've been doing a jigsaw a week and I've taken up cycling on a proper road bike. We go out three times a week and do 11 miles!</p>

<p>'I'm writing two things. I've never had the time to sit down, write and research and I'm really enjoying the process. It's a comedy drama and a mini-series drama.'</p>

<p>Michelle married Mark in a lavish ceremony in 2015 and earlier this summer the couple enjoyed a holiday to Spain together.</p>
