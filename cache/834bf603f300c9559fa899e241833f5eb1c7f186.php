<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Scott Morrison has taken aim at Daniel Andrews for extending Melbourne's lockdown, claiming better health care trumps tough restrictions. </p>

<p>The city will remain under draconian stage four restrictions until at least October 26 but some restrictions will be eased from midnight next Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews has outlined a four-step plan for the state to return to normality if case numbers continue to fall.</p>

<p>But the prime minister took a swipe at the embattled Victorian premier, saying his decision to keep Melbourne locked down will 'come at further economic cost'.</p>

<p>Scott Morrison has subtly criticised Daniel Andrews for keeping Melbourne in lockdown for ten more weeks</p>

<p>Mr Andrews has outlined a four-step plan for the state to return to normality if case numbers continue to fall</p>

<p>'The continued restrictions will have further impact on the Victorian and national economy, in further job losses and and loss of livelihoods, as well as impacting mental health,' a statement from Mr Morrison, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Health Minister Greg Hunt read. </p>

<p>Mr Morrison said it is of 'critical importance' that Victoria's contact tracing is strengthened to the 'highest level possible'. </p>

<p>'In NSW, this has enabled the Berejiklian Government to respond to multiple outbreaks while permitting businesses and people to carry out their daily lives in a CovidSafe way,' the statement read. </p>

<p>'Restrictions are not substitutes for strengthening health systems to cope with the virus, especially when community outbreak is brought under control.' </p>

<p>'The most effective means of reducing community transmission must be an effective testing, tracing and quarantine system, bolstered by enhanced local health capacity and physical distancing.</p>

<p>'These are essential prerequisites to reduce the spread, save lives and manage economic and job impacts.'</p>

<p>Melbourne will remain under a nightly curfew and people will be unable to leave their homes for non-essential reasons until at least October 26.</p>

<p>The lockdown will lift on that date if the average number of new cases falls below five and there are fewer than five unknown source cases.</p>

<p>Up to five visitors from a nominated household and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people will also be allowed.</p>

<p>'We can't run out of lockdown. We have to take steady and safe steps out of lockdown to find that COVID normal,' Mr Andrews said on Sunday.</p>

<p>'I want a Christmas that is as close to normal as possible and this is the only way, these steps are the only way that we will get to that point.'</p>

<p>Melbourne will remain under a nightly curfew and people will be unable to leave their homes for non-essential reasons until at least October 26</p>

<p>The premier said the nominated 14-day average of five cases provided a 97 per cent chance of avoiding having to go back into lockdown.</p>

<p>Victoria's average daily number of cases during the previous 14 days was about 100.</p>

<p>'If you open up at that level you are not open for long,' he said.</p>

<p>'We either do it this way or in fact we won't be opening up at all. We'll just have a short respite from these rules, which I know and appreciate and understand are incredibly difficult.'</p>

<p>The last step will come into effect from November 23, if Victoria goes 14 days with no new cases, allowing public gatherings of up to 50 people and 20 home visitors at a time.</p>

<p>All remaining restrictions will be removed when Victoria goes 28 days with no new cases, although masks will likely remain compulsory for some time.</p>
