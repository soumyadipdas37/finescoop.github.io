<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea have received an approach from Paris St Germain to take Antonio Rudiger on loan. </p>

<p>The French champions proposed a loan with option to buy the Germany international centre back. </p>

<p>Chelsea are considering whether to sell the 27-year old outright with other clubs showing interest. </p>

<p>PSG have submitted a loan offer for Chelsea's out-of-favour defender Antonio Rudiger </p>

<p>The German has been left out of Chelsea's matchday squads for their past two games against Liverpool and Barnsley.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands Rudiger is not part of Frank Lampard's first-team plans and is likely to leave Stamford Bridge before the October 5 transfer deadline.</p>

<p>A move to PSG currently looks like the most likely scenario for Rudiger. </p>

<p>However, despite losing his place in Lampard’s plans, Rudiger maintains his reputation as one of the most accomplished defenders in Europe and will not be short of takers if Chelsea - as appears likely - will make him available.</p>

<p>Rudiger has two years left to run on his current deal but has not been approached about signing an extension. </p>

<p>That means he effectively becomes a free agent in January 2022 - something Chelsea are acutely aware of. It is why the club are keen to sell him this window while his value is still reasonably high.</p>

<p>Rudiger is not part of Frank Lampard's plans and will likely leave before the October 5 deadline</p>
