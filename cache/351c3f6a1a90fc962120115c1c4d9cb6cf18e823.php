<p>Santander has extended its branch opening hours after Money Mail revealed how banks had failed to resume normal services after lockdown eased.</p>

<p>Branches will be open from 9.30am until 4.30pm on Monday to Friday as of September 7.Â </p>

<p>The bank had restricted its weekday hours to 10am until 3pm due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Its opening hours were 9.30am until 5pm before lockdown.</p>

<p>Santander's Saturday hours will return to normal, with branches open from 9.30am to 12.30pm or 4pm.</p>

<p>Experts have warned of a cynical attempt to speed up branch closures, as firms will be able to claim fewer customers are using them.</p>
