<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A police chief in Pakistan is facing a growing backlash after he seemed to blame the victim of an alleged gang rape because she was driving without a male companion at night.</p>

<p>Lahore police chief Umar Sheikh repeatedly criticised the victim for failing to take a male friend.</p>

<p>The victim was allegedly assaulted and raped by several men in front of her two children when she ran out of petrol outside of Lahore late on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Police chief Umar Sheikh told AFP that no-one in Pakistani society would 'allow their sisters and daughters to travel alone so late.'</p>

<p>He added that the woman, a resident of France, probably 'mistook that Pakistani society is just as safe' as her home country.</p>

<p>Women protest against the alleged gang rape of a French woman outside Lahore, in Pakistan</p>

<p>Pakistani politician, Shireen Mazari, the Human Rights Minister, has criticised his remarks.</p>

<p>She said, according to AFP, that 'Nothing can ever rationalise the crime of rape.'</p>

<p>Khadija Siddiqi, a lawyer and women's rights activist, told AFP that the police chief's comments were part of an unfortunate and very rampant culture of victim blaming in Pakistan. </p>

<p>Sheikh's comments have sparked calls for his resignation and protests are planned in cities across Pakistan today.</p>

<p>Nighat Dad, a women's rights activist and an organisers of an annual women's rights march in Lahore, added: 'We are angry, we demand his removal and we demand his apology.'</p>

<p>Angry protesters took to the streets after the alleged assault and rape of a French woman in Pakistan</p>

<p>A patriarchal code of honour governors much of Pakistan life which is in favour of the oppression of women by stopping them from doing certain things, like choosing their on husband.</p>

<p>Deadly violence by men, usually male relatives, against those women who break the taboo  have been attacked by activists.</p>

<p>In Pakistan around 1,000 people, mainly women, are murdered yearly in honour killings for bringing shame onto a family.</p>
