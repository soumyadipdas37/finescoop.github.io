<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian consumer organisation CHOICE has ranked popular dishwashing detergents from best to worst.</p>

<p>The experts explained how detergents can make a huge difference between getting sparkling results in the first cycle or worse, having to rewash the dishes by hand.</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter how good your dishwasher is, you'll never get sparkling results if the detergent you use performs poorly,' CHOICE'S reviewer Ashley Iredale said.</p>

<p>'Switch to a good quality detergent and you'll notice better cleaning performance straight away.'</p>

<p>The supermarket tablets, capsules, gel and powder were rated based on value for money and cleaning performance against common stains such as egg yolk, red wine, coffee and baked-on cheese.</p>

<p>Australian consumer organisation CHOICE has put popular dishwashing detergents to the test</p>

<p>6. Finish Powerball 0 Percent ($17): 75% </p>

<p>7. Finish Powerball Quantum Ultimate Powerful Clean &amp; Shine Lemon Sparkle ($23): 75%</p>

<p>Of the 25 products tested, Earth Choice Dish Tablets ($16.20) and Finish Powerball Quantum Ultimate Pro Lemon Sparkle ($32) both achieved the highest score of 78 per cent.</p>

<p>The two products were able to tackle the dirtiest dishes, with Earth Choice, which costs just 39 cents per wash, removing egg yolk at 84 per cent, baked-on cheese at 93 per cent, red wine at 66 per cent and coffee at 67 per cent.</p>

<p>Finish Powerball, which costs $1 per wash, scored 85 per cent on egg yolk, 93 per cent on baked-on cheese, 86 per cent on mince meat, 62 per cent on red wine and 65 per cent on coffee. </p>

<p>EcoStore Dishwasher Tablets ($19 - 38 cents per wash) and Finish Powerball Quantum Ultimate Pro Baking Soda ($32 - $1 per wash) both landed on 77 per cent.</p>

<p>Koh Dishwashing Tablets ($29.99 - 60 cents per wash) earned 76 per cent, followed by Finish Powerball 0 Percent ($17 - 77 cents per wash) and Finish Powerball Quantum Ultimate Powerful Clean &amp; Shine Lemon Sparkle ($23 - 46 cents per wash) at 75 per cent. </p>

<p>Despite being one of the most expensive brands on the market, Finish Powerball proved to be worth every cent as it claimed four spots out of the top seven.</p>

<p>Coles Ultra Dishwasher Powder Lemon Fresh 2x Concentrate ($4) scored the lowest points of just 43 per cent, followed by Simply Clean Lemon Myrtle Dishwasher Powder ($11.90) at 44 per cent.</p>

<p>Of the 25 products tested, Earth Choice Dish Tablets ($16.20) and Finish Powerball Quantum Ultimate Pro Lemon Sparkle ($32) both achieved the highest score of 78 per cent</p>

<p>EcoStore Dishwasher Tablets ($19 - 38 cents per wash) and Finish Powerball Quantum Ultimate Pro Baking Soda ($32 - $1 per wash) both landed on 77 per cent while Koh Dishwashing Tablets ($29.99 - 60 cents per wash) earned 76 per cent</p>

<p>Despite being one of the most expensive brands on the market, Finish Powerball proved to be worth every cent as it claimed four spots out of the top seven</p>

<p>The experts recommended the top seven detergents out of the 29 products tested.</p>

<p>'We use a bank of four identical dishwashers and use pre-stained plates. Why do we use pre-stained plates? Because if you want to compare dishwasher detergent performance fairly, you have to use the same conditions for all of them, Mr Iredale said.</p>

<p>'These stained plates are embedded with a specific amount of dirt, are identical and made up of a very specific formula.</p>

<p>'These are used all over the world by large detergent makers, plus other consumer organisations and are considered a standard in testing detergents. </p>

<p>'Using these is a means to minimise the amount of variables so you can see which detergent comes out best when comparing them.'</p>
