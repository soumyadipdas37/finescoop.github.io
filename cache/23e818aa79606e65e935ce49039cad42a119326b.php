<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Southampton have issued a hands-off warning after Tottenham made an enquiry for Danny Ings.</p>

<p>Spurs are on the verge of confirming Gareth Bale's stunning return to the club and the £27.5million capture of left back Sergio Reguilon, both from Real Madrid.</p>

<p>And they remain in the market for a striker to support talisman Harry Kane with Southampton star Ings featuring high on manager Jose Mourinho's long list of potential targets.</p>

<p>Southampton have issued a hands-off warning to Tottenham over star striker Danny Ings</p>

<p>Tottenham made an enquiry to Southampton on Wednesday but that has been firmly rejected</p>

<p>Spurs made contact with Southampton on Wednesday to firm up their interest however Southampton made it clear have no interest in selling their star striker.</p>

<p>Ings scored 25 times last season, including 22 in the Premier League to fall just one short of a share of the Premier League Golden Boot.</p>

<p>His form has earned him a recall to the England squad after a five-year absence too.</p>

<p>And rather than entertain selling the 28-year-old Southampton are hoping to tie Ings down on a new contract, as revealed by Sportsmail last month.</p>

<p>Ings' current £65,000-per-week deal expires in 2022.</p>

<p>When asked about Spurs's interest in Ings following Southampton's 2-0 Carabao Cup defeat against Brentford on Wednesday night, manager Ralph Hasenhuttl said: 'I do not want to comment on any rumours, no.' </p>

<p>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is keen to bolster his striking options before the window shuts</p>
