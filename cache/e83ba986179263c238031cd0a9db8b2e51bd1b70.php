<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Morrisons has reinstated door marshals at its stores to limit the number of shoppers amid fears of Covid-19 panic buying - as supermarkets double their delivery slots to prepare for a second wave.</p>

<p> Staff will be stationed at all 494 of Morrisons supermarkets to monitor shoppers and remind them to wear face masks.</p>

<p> It comes as bosses at Britain's big chains insisted they have enough stock and delivery slots for everyone, as they try to prevent scenes of panic buying seen back in March.</p>

<p>Morrisons has reinstated marshals to monitor customer numbers and remind them to wear masks, while Tesco has boosted its online ordering capacity</p>

<p>Tesco's weekly ordering capacity has risen from 600,000 to 1.5million - but it remains fully booked until Wednesday, The Mirror has reported.</p>

<p>There are three-day waiting times for Ocado, while Sainsbury's is experiencing high demand. </p>

<p>The supermarket revealed the number of Christmas pudding searches was four times higher than this time last year.  </p>

<p>Concerned shoppers took to Twitter over the weekend to share photographs of their local supermarkets, showing shelves completely emptied of essential items.</p>

<p>One Twitter user shared photographs of an ASDA in London where cereals seemed in short supply, leaving shoppers with fewer brands to choose from.</p>

<p>Another shopper posted pictures of a Tesco in the West Midlands, where kitchen roll and toilet roll was in short supply - but had not been completely cleared out.</p>

<p>Concerned shoppers shared pictures of panic buying from stores in London and other parts of the country</p>

<p>Andrew Opie, head of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told The Mirror: 'We urge consumers to be considerate and shop for food as they would usually during this difficult time.'</p>

<p>One supermarket worker in Birmingham told the paper: 'Some people are definitely panic buying again. We have 4,000 more items this weekend than we usually would. </p>

<p>'When the panic buying started months ago, we hadn't experienced it. We are prepared now.' </p>
