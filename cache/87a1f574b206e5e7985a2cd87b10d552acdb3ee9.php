<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Â A club in Sydney's southwest is closed for cleaning after it was recently visited by a person with COVID-19, NSW Health says.</p>

<p>The infectious person dined at the Moorebank Sports Club at Hammondville on the evening of September 14.</p>

<p>Anyone who attended the club needs to monitor themselves for symptoms, and if they appear, get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result.</p>

<p>NSW Health is working with the venue to identify people who were at the club at the time and contact patrons to identify close contacts.</p>

<p>Anyone identified as a close contact must immediately self-isolate, get tested and remain isolated for 14 days even if a negative result is received.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the NSW government has announced its plan for a COVID-safe summer, telling beachgoers to keep a towel length between themselves and others.</p>

<p>The plan encourages more outdoor dining and safe distancing will be marked out in parks and some public spaces from next month.</p>

<p>At the same time, COVID-safe summer program of events will be launched in outdoor areas to encourage people to get out and about safely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a coronavirus infection in a Sydney taxi driver could delay South Australia lifting border restrictions with NSW.</p>

<p>The state's health officials have sought details from NSW ahead of a meeting on Tuesday to consider lifting the 14-day quarantine requirement.</p>

<p>But any decision could now be delayed until Friday or later.</p>

<p>NSW Health is trying to contact anyone who took trips with the Silver Service taxi driver, who tested positive on Saturday and worked in Sydney's west and southwest.</p>

<p>The critical dates are September 8 to 18.</p>

<p>While a large number of people who rode with that driver have already been identified, the names of nine passengers is still unknown. It's likely they hailed the cab on the street.</p>

<p>NSW reported four new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday, including three returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one case that was locally acquired.</p>

<p>That person had already been in self-isolation because they were a close contact of an infected person linked to the Concord Hospital cluster in Sydney.</p>
