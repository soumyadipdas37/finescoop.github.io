<p>Birthday blues? A glum-looking Sam Armytage failed to raise a smile as the Sunrise crew surprised her with cupcakes on her 44th birthday on Friday</p>

<p>Sam was probably very grateful for the cupcakes, but it seems she was caught at a rather stressful moment.</p>

<p>The Weight Watchers ambassador looked chic in a red shift dress, and styled her blonde hair in loose waves and a slightly off-centre parting.</p>

<p>She opted for a simple makeup look comprising a flawless complexion, a hint of blush on her cheeks and a matte pink lipstick.</p>

<p>Here you go, boss! As she removed the microphone from her collar, a production assistant arrived with an assortment of cupcakes on a three-tier stand </p>

<p>Lovely! In addition to the sweet treats, she also received a beautiful bouquet of flowers</p>

<p>She found Mr Right! Sam's birthday celebration comes after she announced her engagement to horse breeder Richard Lavender (left) in June </p>

<p>At the time, she said that Richard had proposed on the spur of the moment 'weeks' earlier in the paddock of his rural property in the NSW Southern Highlands.</p>

<p>Sam explained they'd held back making the announcement because they were waiting for the personalised ring to arrive.</p>

<p>A jeweller from House of K'dor estimated that the cushion-cut sparkler Richard gave Sam cost him about $80,000. </p>

<p>Sam and Richard, who began dating in April last year after meeting at a friend's party, confirmed their romance in November.</p>
