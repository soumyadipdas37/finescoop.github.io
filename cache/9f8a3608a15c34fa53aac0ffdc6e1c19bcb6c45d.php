<p>Joanne also discussed her big day in 2016, which saw her officially become Mrs Dyer.</p>

<p>Speaking about her wedding she said: 'I don’t regret it at all, we had a great time, a great party, but if I knew the situation I was going to get myself into, I wouldn’t have gone down that route.'</p>

<p>Danny explained: 'I don’t know if Joanne saw how much I missed ’em, but the visits started getting longer and we’d sit down with a cup of tea.</p>

<p>'Next minute... we’re having an affair. I said: 'F*** this! We’re sneaking around like schoolkids. We’ve got a beautiful girl. Let’s give it a go".'</p>
