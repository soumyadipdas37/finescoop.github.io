<p>The body of a pregnant woman has been found 'wrapped up' and her ex-boyfriend arrested after a month-long search for her in Washington state. </p>

<p>Kassanndra Cantrell, 33, vanished in late August after nobody saw or heard from her in two days and she failed to attend a doctor's appointment despite her pregnancy. </p>

<p>Her car was found abandoned in Tacoma and detectives searched nearby houses in a desperate four-week hunt, which ended on Tuesday when her remains were found using GPS data from her ex-boyfriend's truck. </p>

<p>The ex-boyfriend, 37-year-old Colin Patrick Dudley, was arrested yesterday afternoon and is being held in a Pierce County jail on suspicion of murder. </p>

<p>Dudley was arrested by a SWAT team from the Pierce County Sheriff's Office after his truck was seized in a search warrant at his home earlier this month. </p>

<p>Detectives spotted the truck and identified its license plate in surveillance footage which showed him walking from Cantrell's car to a nearby parking garage. </p>

<p>Cantrell's white Mazda 3 sedan had been found abandoned near the Tacoma Dome with no sign of the 33-year-old nearby. </p>

<p>Her family raised the alarm on August 27 after she had 'not returned home and not been seen or heard from in two days'. </p>

<p>She had also missed a doctor's appointment which was reportedly the first ultrasound scan of her pregnancy. </p>

<p>A SWAT team took a suspect into custody on Tuesday after Cantrell's body was found nearly a month following her disappearance in Tacoma, Washington </p>

<p>The search for Cantrell ended on Tuesday when the pregnant 33-year-old's remains were found using GPS data from her ex-boyfriend's truck</p>

<p>On the day Cantrell went missing, friends said she may have planned to go to a grocery store, but detectives found no signs of financial activity to suggest that she did this. </p>

<p>Detectives said they were 'concerned' because there was no activity on her phone at all in what her family said was an 'unusual' lack of contact.  </p>

<p>Dudley's home was searched on September 1 after he was identified as the man in the footage and his truck was seized. </p>

<p>According to Q13, Dudley raised further suspicion by claiming not to have seen or spoken to Cantrell in years - despite phone records allegedly proving this was untrue.</p>

<p>Cantrell was said to be 'over the moon' about her pregnancy and had already started buying baby clothes and toys. </p>

<p>However, although she had told relatives that Dudley was the father of her unborn child, she was reluctant to tell Dudley himself, it is claimed.  </p>

<p>Cantrell was allegedly alarmed by Dudley's long-ago remark that he would take legal action if his girlfriend got pregnant 'just to spite the mother'. </p>

<p>Using the GPS data from Dudley's truck, detectives found a 'set of human remains that were wrapped and disposed of over a steep hillside along Chambers Creek', the sheriff's office said.  </p>

<p>Rescuers 'performed a high-angle ropes operation to recover the remains, which are believed to be Kassanndra Cantrell' pending confirmation from a medical examiner.  </p>

<p>Jail records show that Dudley was booked shortly before 6pm on Tuesday evening and faces charges in Pierce County's Superior Court.    </p>
