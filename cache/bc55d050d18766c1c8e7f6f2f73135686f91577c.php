<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert makes no secret of the fact he is a keen adventurer and wants to share his love of the great outdoors with his future partner.</p>

<p>And a wild rumour surfaced this week that Irena Srbinovska, who is the bookies' favourite to win the show, has been pretending to enjoy hiking to impress the former Australian Survivor star.</p>

<p>During Wednesday's episode, the 31-year-old nurse told Locky she liked bushwalking in her spare time - but this was disputed by her rival Bella Varelis.</p>

<p>Rumours: The Bachelor's Irena Srbinovska (pictured) has been rocked by a wild theory that she is faking her love of hiking and the outdoors to impress Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>While Bella's skepticism may have simply been the result of jealousy, her claim that Irena was being disingenuous about her love of hiking hasn't gone unnoticed.</p>

<p>On Thursday, former contestant Alisha Aitken-Radburn said on Channel 10's official Cocktails and Roses podcast that she doubted Irena's sincerity, too.</p>

<p>Alisha noticed while stalking Irena's Instagram account that she had conspicuously shared two hiking-themed posts in May - when Locky and the women were all under lockdown and staying in contact via Zoom, texts and FaceTime.</p>

<p>Was she being honest? During Wednesday's episode, the 31-year-old nurse told Locky she liked bushwalking in her spare time - but this was disputed by her rival Bella Varelis</p>

<p>Suspicious minds: While Bella's (pictured) skepticism may have been the result of jealousy, her claim that Irena was being disingenuous about her love of hiking hasn't gone unnoticed</p>

<p>On-site production of The Bachelor was suspended from March until the first week of July due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Alisha suggested that Irena's posts were a strategic attempt to catch Locky's eye at a time when he had 10 different women trying to impress him.</p>

<p>She added: 'I do think that she was doing a bit of positioning. You know, Locky's just at home sussing out his future wife - we haven't determined exactly which one it will be yet - and if you see, you know... tick for Irena!'</p>

<p>Skeptical: On Thursday, former contestant Alisha Aitken-Radburn (pictured) said on Channel 10's official Cocktails and Roses podcast that she doubted Irena's sincerity, too</p>

<p>Trying to get Locky's attention? Alisha noticed while stalking Irena's Instagram account that she had conspicuously shared two hiking-themed posts in May - when Locky and the women were all under lockdown. Pictured: one of Irena's posts from May 16</p>

<p>Hmm! Alisha singled out this post from May 19 that showed Irena climbing over rocks in Mount Macedon, Victoria, as evidence that she was conspicuously trying to get Locky's attention</p>

<p>Alisha hastened to add, however, that Irena has shared photos of herself on country walks dating back several years.</p>

<p>Her podcast co-host Osher Günsberg replied with a laugh: 'Well played, Irena!'</p>

<p>Irena is the current bookies' favourite to win Locky's heart on The Bachelor, with 25-year-old marketing consultant Bella tipped for runner-up.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10</p>
