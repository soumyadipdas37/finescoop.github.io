<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Authorities will investigate whether a dead tiger shark caught in a net off a Gold Coast beach is the one that killed a surfer in the same waters on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Nick Slater, 46, was fatally mauled at about 5pm on Tuesday off popular Greenmount Beach, on the Gold Coast tourist strip, in a rare attack where swimmers are protected by shark netting.</p>

<p>His death is only the second fatal shark attack at one of Queensland's 85 beaches that have been protected by nets and drum lines since 1962, the state government said. </p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said a large tiger shark had been found since Slater's death tangled in a net off Greenmount Beach.</p>

<p>'Further investigations will be conducted to discover if there is any link between it and the fatal attack,' Palaszczuk told state parliament.</p>

<p>Australian star surfer Mick Fanning - who narrowly escaped being mauled by a great white shark in South Africa in 2015 - contacted a teenage 'grommet' surfer who was metres away from Tuesday's attack and shaken up by the horrific scenes. </p>

<p>'The kid was freaked out by what had happened,' a surfing insider told the Courier-Mail.</p>

<p>'So Mick reached out to him and had a chat and told him to take it easy and that he doesn’t have to rush straight back out in the water if he doesn’t want to.</p>

<p>'He told him it’s perfectly okay to be freaked out by something like that and to take it at your own pace.' </p>

<p>Before nets were put in place, the last fatal shark attack off a Gold Coast beach - 24 of which are now netted - was in 1958.     </p>

<p>The horrific mauling was captured by surf watch cameras and witnessed by at least one other rider. </p>

<p>'It doesn't matter how long it has been, still a devastating shock to the community of the Gold Coast.' </p>

<p>The mayor said the beaches would remain closed until it is determined the shark is no longer in the vicinity. </p>

<p>Mr Tate said the shark attack was a reminder to all beachgoers to 'look after your mates'.</p>

<p>'I mean really it brings to reality, when we go off the land we go into water, it is the shark's domain,' he said. </p>

<p>Surfer Jade Parker told 7News he first spotted a school of fish and up to 30 birds near the victim, which is what attracted the shark to the surfer. </p>

<p>He had been walking along the footpath near a lookout when he noticed some commotion in the water.</p>

<p>'There were four or five people yelling and pointing at the water, and I looked out to where they were pointing and I spotted a board floating and a body was next to it,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Parker just assumed the surfer had been knocked out because he wasn't moving so he ran down to the beach and swam to the victim, who was in waist deep water.</p>

<p>'There were about three on the scene before me and they were all trying to drag him in with the board he had. I helped drag him into the beach as well.' </p>

<p>When they arrived on the sand lifeguards were waiting with a stretcher but Mr Parker said he was 'pretty much gone' by the time they arrived.</p>

<p>Mr Parker said the injury stretched from the 'groin area to just below his knee'.</p>

<p>'It was pretty much all taken... there was nothing there, it was just hanging there by not much,' he said. </p>

<p>'Honestly, I do not want to get to the gory parts but he was in a bad way. He was not conscious. It looked like he had already pretty much passed away at that point in time.'</p>

<p>Mr Parker added that the attack would not put him off surfing.</p>

<p>'I know the sharks are always out there so I will just have to accept that fate,' he said. </p>

<p>He was mauled by a shark 250m off Surfers Paradise beach and died of his injuries despite lifesavers coming to his rescue.    </p>
