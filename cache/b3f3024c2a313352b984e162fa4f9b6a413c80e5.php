<p>XR has received £269,000 from the Climate Emergency Fund set up by wealthy environmentalists in the United States.</p>

<p>But last night one of the philanthropists, Trevor Neilson, condemned the group's tactics as an unhelpful attack on free speech.</p>

<p>'I deeply respect the passion of climate activists but also believe that preventing newspapers from doing their job is not a helpful strategy in the fight against the climate emergency,' he told the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>More than 80 Extinction Rebellion protesters were arrested for blockading printers in Hertfordshire and Merseyside, depriving many newsagents of Saturday's papers including The Times, Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail</p>

<p>'A free press is the cornerstone of democracy.' </p>

<p>Mr Nielson said last year that if groups used CEF cash for anything illegal ''I imagine we would not provide them funding again''.</p>

<p>XR also came under fire from Bianca Jagger, a veteran environmentalist, who said the printworks protest last weekend was a mistake for the green cause. </p>

<p>'And together we must all stand firm against the guerrilla tactics of Extinction Rebellion and that means adapting to the threat they pose and ensuring that justice is served.'</p>

<p>An XR spokesman said: 'Our action was a call for greater democracy.'</p>
