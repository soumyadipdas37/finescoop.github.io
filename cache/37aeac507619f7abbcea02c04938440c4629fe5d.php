<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Coronavirus is able to rapidly multiply by hijacking the body and forcing it to produce more receptors it can use to enter and infect organs, a study suggests.</p>

<p>US experts processed 2.5billion genetic combinations of Covid-19 in a super-computer to try and understand how the virus impacts the body.</p>

<p>They believe they have cracked why Covid-19 causes a slew of bizarre symptoms and are now recommending more than 10 potential treatments for the disease.</p>

<p>The team, from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, found the virus typically infects people through ACE-2 receptors in the nose, where they are most common.</p>

<p>It then races through the body, invading cells in other places where ACE-2 is located, including the intestines, kidneys and heart - explaining the cardiac and kidney damage, and abdominal pains, seen in many patients.</p>

<p>Once inside human cells, though, it tricks the body into producing more ACE-2 receptors where they are normally only present in small numbers, including in the lungs.</p>

<p>This essentially opens the floodgates and allows Covid-19 to rapidly multiply and send armies of viral particles to infect more parts of the body in huge numbers.</p>

<p>A byproduct of this crafty process is that it interferes with the body's ability to control levels of a chemical called bradykinin, which helps regulate blood pressure, according to the team's analysis.</p>

<p>This leads to a catastrophic build-up of the chemical, causing a 'bradykinin storm' which makes blood vessels leaky and drives up the risk of inflammation, blood clots, strokes and brain damage - deadly symptoms observed in the sickest of patients.</p>

<p>The Oak Ridge scientists are recommending a series of bradykinin-reducing drugs including danazol, stanozolol, and ecallantide, which are already approved in the UK and US for other conditions.</p>

<p>Coronavirus is able to rapidly multiply by hijacking the body and forcing it to produce more receptors it can use to infect, a study suggests (stock image of a coronavirus)</p>

<p>The team, led by Professor Daniel Jacobson, a computational systems biologist at the lab, looked at more than 40,000 genes from 17,000 genetic samples of the coronavirus.</p>

<p>They input the data into Summit, the second fastest super-computer in the world, which analysed 2.5 billion genetic combinations over a week.</p>

<p>This helped the scientists to understand the genetic make-up of the virus, how that could interact with the human body and what symptoms it could cause. </p>

<p>After analysing the results, the team believe the coronavirus interferes with the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), which controls bradykinin levels.  </p>

<p>Researchers from King's College London have developed a symptom-tracking app which has seen millions of Britons sign up and report their symptoms. </p>

<p>The full list of symptoms, in order of how predictive they are of the disease, include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Loss of smell/taste</p></li>
<li><p>Persistent cough</p></li>
<li><p>Fatigue</p></li>
<li><p>Loss of appetite</p></li>
<li><p>Skin rash</p></li>
<li><p>Hives</p></li>
<li><p>Fever</p></li>
<li><p>Severe muscle pain</p></li>
<li><p>Shortness of breath</p></li>
<li><p>Diarrhoea</p></li>
<li><p>Delirium</p></li>
<li><p>Abdominal pain</p></li>
<li><p>Chest pain</p></li>
<li><p>Hoarse voice</p></li>
<li><p>Eye soreness</p></li>
<li><p>Sore or painful throat</p></li>
<li><p>Nausea or vomiting</p></li>
<li><p>Headache</p></li>
<li><p>Dizziness or light headedness</p></li>
</ol>

<p>They believe it is the 'bradykinin storm' causing the majority of the unusual symptoms, rather than a 'cytokine storm', an overreaction by the immune system which sees it attack healthy tissue, which was previously touted as the possible cause.</p>

<p>As bradykinin accumulates in the body, it makes the protective walls around blood vessels less waterproof and more likely to leak. </p>

<p>The researchers say this causes immune cells to leak into vital organs like the lungs, causing deadly inflammation – a useful recovery process when well controlled – that makes it hard to breathe. They have called their theory the 'bradykinin hypothesis'. </p>

<p>The RAS system is also responsible for keeping the heart beating properly and controlling blood pressure.</p>

<p>The theory would explain why a fifth of Covid-19 hospital patients suffer heart damage, despite many never having previously had cardiac troubles.</p>

<p>And arrhythmias - irregular heart beats - and low blood pressure have also been spotted in a large proportion of patients.</p>

<p>According to Professor Jacobson, it is leaky blood vessels that are triggering Covid-19's symptoms in the nerves and brain, which have puzzled doctors and scientists alike.</p>

<p>Leaks in a barrier between blood vessels in the skull and brain cells is causing dizziness, seizures, delirium, and stroke - thought to affect half of all hospitalised Covid-19 patients to some degree.</p>

<p>The blood-brain barrier acts as a filter between the organ and the rest of the body, only allowing essential nutrients to pass through and keeping out toxins and pathogens.</p>

<p>When broken down, these cells are able to infiltrate the brain and trigger inflammation and brain damage.</p>

<p>Professor Jacobson told the medical news website Elemental: 'It is a reasonable hypothesis that many of the neurological symptoms in Covid-19 could be due to an excess of bradykinin.</p>

<p>'It has been reported that bradykinin would indeed be likely to increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. In addition, similar neurological symptoms have been observed in other diseases that result from an excess of bradykinin.'</p>

<p>The scientist said Covid-19's effect on the body appears to echo nasty side effects of blood pressure-lowering drugs.</p>

<p>Such medications, known as ACE inhibitors, are prescribed to patients with extremely high blood pressure, known as hypertension.</p>

<p>They are known to, in some cases, cause a dry cough, fatigue and loss of taste and smell - three tell-tale signs of the coronavirus.</p>

<p>Professor Jacobson's theory may also explain why men are disproportionately catching and dying from coronavirus.</p>

<p>Males are dying at twice the rate of the disease in the UK and the findings are consistent worldwide.</p>

<p>Professor Jacobson said there are a higher number of protective proteins that prevent the RAS system from going haywire located on the X chromosome. </p>

<p>This suggests 'women… have twice the levels of this protein than men' which 'could explain the lower incidence of Covid-19 induced mortality in women', he added.</p>

<p>The peer-reviewed study, published in the journal E Life Sciences, is said to contribute to a better understanding of Covid-19' and 'add novelty to the existing literature,' according to the independent scientists who reviewed it.</p>

<p>Professor Jacobson and his team are now recommending scientists investigate more than 10 bradykinin-blocking drugs on Covid-19 patients.</p>

<p>Many, which have the potential to stop a bradykinin storm, include danazol, which treats endometriosis, a painful disorder affecting the womb, the anabolic steroid stanozolol and ecallantide and icatibant, which treat skin conditions.   </p>
