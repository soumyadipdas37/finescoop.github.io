<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An unidentified woman received a devastating note from her neighbor revealing that her boyfriend had cheated — and criticizing her for her dirty car.</p>

<p>The note was shard by the Instagram account Neighbors from Hell after it was left on the woman's windshield.</p>

<p>'FYI I f***ed your boyfriend,' it reads in all-caps red marker. 'He said you were broken up. I live in 5D.'</p>

<p>Too bad! An unidentified woman received a devastating note from her neighbor revealing that her boyfriend had cheated — and criticizing her for her dirty car</p>

<p>The semi-anonymous note was written on a piece of notebook paper with the words 'Stuff To Do' pre-printed at the top.</p>

<p>And, to add insult to injury, the woman who wrote the note decided to add a few 'to do's' to her message at the bottom of the paper.</p>

<p>After the revelation about her boyfriend cheating — and lying about his relationship status — the note has two tasks for the unlucky-in-love woman.</p>

<p>'1. Wash your car,' it reads. '2. Dump him (not in that order).' </p>

<p>Both bits of advice seem like good ones, particularly because the small amount of the car visible in the photo is incredibly filthy — though it does seem like an unnecessary bit of shaming on the part of the woman who left the note. </p>

<p>Uh-oh! The Instagram account that shared the note posted an unfortunate update: 'Twist: Person who received this note tested positive for an STD' (stock image) </p>

<p>The Instagram post has amassed over 11,000 likes, with commenters praising the neighbor for telling the note's recipient about her bad boyfriend.</p>

<p>'Honestly this is the kinda neighbor I would like to have,' wrote one.</p>

<p>'If be happy to get this message in this way. Obviously I’d be heading over to 5D with a bottle,' said another.</p>

<p>'I’d appreciate the tip about the cheating boyfriend but mind your business about my car,' said one more.</p>

<p>Later, the Instagram account that shared the note posted an unfortunate update: 'Twist: Person who received this note tested positive for an STD. Leaver of note needs to get checked!'</p>
