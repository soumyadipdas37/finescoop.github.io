<p>Felicity also went on to speak about plastic surgery, Lorraine said she considered getting botox because of how well the actress looked with the procedure as she claimed: 'You only need a little bit very rarely.'</p>

<p>However, Felicity was clear that exercise was also a reason for her youthful features, as she added: 'I do yoga and weight, that's really important because bones get weak and crumbly.</p>
