<p>She said in a recent interview with Cosmopolitan magazine: 'We [Mark and I] were saying we'd enjoyed it. It's been nice because we've both been working from home.</p>

<p>'Normally we could be out all day or I have to go to Manchester [to film Brassic] or Mark is in London. I'm taking my dogs for daily walks, I've been doing a jigsaw a week and I've taken up cycling on a proper road bike. We go out three times a week and do 11 miles!</p>

<p>'I'm writing two things. I've never had the time to sit down, write and research and I'm really enjoying the process. It's a comedy drama and a mini-series drama.'</p>

<p>Michelle married Mark in a lavish ceremony in 2015 and earlier this summer the couple enjoyed a holiday to Spain together.</p>
