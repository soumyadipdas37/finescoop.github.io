<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>On paper, perhaps it wasn’t the most powerful studio line-up for Sky’s first Super Sunday of the season.</p>

<p>Doncaster Rovers manager Darren Moore and former Everton midfielder Tim Cahill don’t have the presence or punch of, say, Roy Keane or Graeme Souness.</p>

<p>But, then again, we didn’t know Sky were going to show a moving eight-minute segment on the Black Lives Matter movement and sport’s response in the 111 days since George Floyd lost his life.</p>

<p>Darren Moore was touched by Sky's touching segment on the Black Lives Matter movement</p>

<p>Former West Brom favourite Moore was primarily on hand to offer analysis on Albion’s opening game against Leicester City, but he was even more relevant in his role as chairman of the Premier League Black Participants’ Advisory Group.</p>

<p>‘I was really gripped by it,’ he said after seeing the segment. ‘The clear message is change. We have it within ourselves to see change. When we do initially take that step, there will be a whole generation behind it.’</p>

<p>Cahill too was also very good as he discussed the world his four children will inhabit.</p>

<p>‘To watch that, it hits home,’ said Cahill. ‘It hit home today, but will it still be there tomorrow?</p>

<p>Tim Cahill, also appearing on Super Sunday, spoke about the world his children will inhabit</p>

<p>‘I think more about my children. We need to learn what’s right and what’s wrong. We can’t always change adults but we can change what children are learning.’</p>

<p>Cahill was in the studio as a member of the last Everton team to win away at Tottenham in 2008, but the spiciest soundbites were always likely to come from co-commentator Gary Neville and Jamie Redknapp pitchside.</p>

<p>Neville threw down the gauntlet to Carlo Ancelotti’s revamped team early doors.</p>

<p>‘I look across that Everton team: internationals, quality players, a manager of great experience, there are no excuses,’ he said.</p>

<p>Gary Neville has thrown down the gauntlet to Carlo Ancelotti’s revamped Everton early doors</p>

<p>He weighed in on Tottenham after Dominic Calvert-Lewin headed the only goal of the game - ‘the reaction from Spurs isn’t good enough, just look at them walking around the pitch sulking’ - and so did Redknapp.</p>

<p>‘I don’t understand what formation Jose Mourinho has ended up with.</p>

<p>‘He’s just thrown players on the pitch to try and make something happen,’ observed Sportsmail’s columnist.</p>
