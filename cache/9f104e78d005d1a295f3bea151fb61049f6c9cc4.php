<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New Manchester City signing Nathan Ake has revealed that he is looking forward to the challenge that awaits him following his £40million switch from Bournemouth.</p>

<p>Ake was relegated from the Premier League with Bournemouth at the end of last season but still received praise for some of his individual performances. </p>

<p>The 25-year-old stressed that he has already proved that he has the talent to succeed at the highest level. </p>

<p>Nathan Ake has revealed his determination to succeed after signing for Manchester City</p>

<p>Ake told The Mirror: 'I have not signed for City thinking I can prove all the critics wrong. I have already proved to myself that I have the ability to play at top level – and I love a challenge. </p>

<p>'I showed that when I was a kid playing in my hometown in the Hague and I moved to ­Rotterdam to join Feyenoord. I showed it again when I packed my stuff and moved to Chelsea.</p>

<p>'I have had to work incredibly hard to make it to the top – and I know I am ready. I have also achieved my dream of playing for Holland.'</p>

<p>Ake insists that he doesn't have anything to prove despite being relegated with Bournemouth</p>

<p>The Dutch international revealed that he struck up an 'instant connection' with Pep Guardiola</p>

<p>Ake revealed that he found it difficult to believe that City wanted to sign him.</p>

<p>The centre-back added that he struck up an 'instant connection' with manager Pep Guardiola.</p>

<p>Ake said: 'I had to pinch myself in the arm. I was thinking, 'Is this real?'.</p>

<p>'When I heard they wanted me to come to Manchester I was bowled over.</p>

<p>'Manchester City are one of the best clubs in the world and Pep Guardiola is one of the best managers in the world.</p>

<p>'I had a really good talk with Guardiola and there was an instant connection. The way City play really suits me. I have played against them so many times and I know how hard it is to face them.' </p>

<p>Ake's first Premier League appearance for City could come on September 21, when Guardiola's side commence their campaign away to Wolves.</p>

<p>Having joined Chelsea as a youngster, Ake featured for the Blues at first-team level but was loaned out on three occasions, with the last of those spells being with Bournemouth before he made a permanent move.</p>

<p>In total he played 121 times for the Cherries, and he will now get the opportunity to test himself in the Champions League with City.  </p>
