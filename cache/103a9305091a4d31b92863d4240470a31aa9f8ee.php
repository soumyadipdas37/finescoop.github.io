<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She is known for hitting the red carpet in weird and wonderful ensembles. </p>

<p>But Helena Bonham Carter revealed she might be ditching her curious outfits in favour of her birthday suit for this year's Emmys Awards on 20 September, where she is nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress.  </p>

<p>The actress, 54, revealed in an interview with The Mirror that going nude might be the best solution as she doesn't know what to wear for the virtual ceremony. </p>

<p>Going nude: Helena Bonham Carter revealed she might be ditching her curious outfits in favour of her birthday suit for this year's Emmys Awards on 20 September</p>

<p>She said to the publication: 'Don’t even ask what I am going to wear. Maybe I won’t wear anything – that is all. I will just have my head on and cause a sensation. </p>

<p>Mimicking a red carpet interviewer, Helena added: 'What are you wearing? "Me!"'</p>

<p>The mother-of-two is nominated for the Outstanding Supporting Actress In A Drama Series award for her portrayal of Princess Margaret in Netflix series The Crown. </p>

<p>Cheeky! She said to The Mirror: 'Don’t even ask what I am going to wear. Maybe I won’t wear anything – that is all. I will just have my head on and cause a sensation'</p>

<p>The 72nd Emmy Awards ceremony will take place at the Los Angeles Staples Center, but Helena will appear via video link from her home in the UK.    </p>

<p>The annual event takes place virtually with 130 stars being sent fully-assembled broadcasting units including a camera, laptop, ring light and boom mic, so they can connect up via video link for the nominations and acceptance speeches.</p>

<p>Emmy Awards bosses have admitted the upcoming ceremony is a 'logistic nightmare' and could go terribly wrong.     </p>

<p>Executive producer Reginald Hudlin thinks the video links will offer a more relaxed and authentic feel to the ceremony, and the possibility of chaos could add an amusing touch to the ceremony.</p>

<p>He said during a virtual press conference: 'We're essentially making things up as we go along.</p>

<p>'I know that's not the most reassuring answer, but it's kind of the truth! We've never done this before.' </p>
