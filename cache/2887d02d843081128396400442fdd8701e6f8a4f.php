<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>'Liverpool are stronger today than they were 12 months ago. Some players need five or six (games) to get up to speed. But right now, I think Liverpool could run away with it.'</p>

<p>Graeme Souness sent an ominous warning to the rest of the Premier League on Sunday evening, and a little over 24 hours later Liverpool reinforced that message.</p>

<p>After dismantling Chelsea eight days earlier, the defending champions held Arsenal at arm's length with a controlled display in an emphatic 3-1 victory at Anfield.</p>

<p>Liverpool's players celebrate after sealing victory with the third goal against Arsenal</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp described his side's performance as 'absolutely exceptional' after the game</p>

<p>It is only a few weeks since serious doubts were raised over the ability of Jurgen Klopp's side to defend their crown, that they were in danger of going backwards after standing still in the transfer market.</p>

<p>Sir Alex Ferguson always said defending a league title was the hardest trick of all. Since he led Manchester United to the third of three in a row in 2009, only Pep Guardiola's Manchester City have successfully defended retained their crown. That shows the challenge Liverpool are facing, and the measure of their early form.</p>

<p>The arrivals of Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota, and the ease with which they have swatted aside two of their top six rivals, suggest that fears of a title hangover have been wildly misjudged.</p>

<p>Manchester City were many pundits' tip for the title a month ago, but now it's Liverpool making the early running. Sportsmail take a look at how Klopp is masterminding the latest tactical evolution of this Liverpool side... </p>

<p>Four years of expert squad-building </p>

<p>Klopp is now being held up as the reason to give managers like Frank Lampard and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer time at Chelsea and Manchester United.</p>

<p>It is true that Klopp has been afforded a luxury that others in his industry have not. Though he arrived at Anfield as a proven manager in the elite of his field, given his accomplishments at Borussia Dortmund, there were legitimate fears that his brand of football had been, to an extent, 'found out'.</p>

<p>He was always going to be given time at Anfield. And he has deserved it by delivering improvements year upon year. The team has hit its targets - and then some - at the end of every season since his first full one in charge in 2016.</p>

<p>Sadio Mane celebrates following his swift equaliser minutes after Arsenal's opening goal</p>

<p>Given that it is now three seasons since they reached the first of two Champions League finals, and now two seasons ago that they finished a Premier League season with 97 points, that is astonishing.</p>

<p>In 2016 Sadio Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum arrived. In 2017 Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson were signed and Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez emerged as bonafide first-team players. In 2018 they made the most significant jump, with Virgil van Dijk and Alisson overhauling the defence after the departure of Philippe Coutinho.</p>

<p>Since the arrival of those two defensive pillars, and the 'Lighthouse' Fabinho, it has been about refinement to the personnel and the tactics.</p>

<p>Klopp's assistant, Pep Ljinders once said that 'the best signing you can make is the training process.' Liverpool's impressive squad-building of the past four years began in the transfer market but has been schooled on the grass of Melwood. </p>

<p>No player doubts what is expected of him, and everyone who joins has been meticulously scouted both on and off the pitch. It is not a coincidence that the recruitment process headed up by Michael Edwards has been near perfect in the last four years.</p>

<p>New-found strength in depth </p>

<p>Just a year ago there was no doubting the difference between Manchester City and Liverpool. Both had exceptional first XIs, but crucially Pep Guardiola had a squad that appeared unrivalled in England. When Leroy Sane is your first change from the bench, you know you are in business.</p>

<p>Sane and David Silva have both returned to their homelands, and City all of a sudden appear threadbare, even accounting for an injury crisis that Guardiola claims has left him with only 13 fit players.</p>

<p>Chasing victory against Leicester on Sunday, Guardiola chucked on 17-year-old Liam Delap in just the 51st minute. Klopp, by contrast, was able to wait until the 80th minute to introduce James Milner and Diogo Jota. Takumi Minamino came on for a run around in injury time while Curtis Jones and Divock Origi stayed on the bench.</p>

<p>Diogo Jota (right) scored on his Premier League debut for Liverpool after an impressive cameo</p>

<p>Jordan Henderson was injured, so too the new boy Thiago Alcantara, but Liverpool hardly missed either, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been sidelined by injury since pre-season.</p>

<p>Xherdan Shaqiri, who had Klopp purring after starring in a deeper role in last week's 7-2 rout of Lincoln, wasn't even in the matchday 18.</p>

<p>Three important acquisitions in the transfer market this year - Minamino, Thiago and Jota - coupled with the emergence of young talents like Jones, Neco Williams and Harvey Elliot have given Klopp the options he has so longed for. From last year's first-team squad, only Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana have left so far.</p>

<p>Against Manchester City, the tables have now turned. </p>

<p>The revamped midfield </p>

<p>When pressed in the summer about what was to come next from Liverpool, assistant boss Lijnders promised: 'unpredictability'.</p>

<p>Liverpool's supremacy in recent years has come from finding new ways to beat opponents, to make incremental improvements that keep their rivals guessing.</p>

<p>After the Champions League final defeat in Kiev in 2018, Liverpool targeted set-piece improvements and overhauled their approach to throw-ins to the extent that they were widely ridiculed for hiring a specialist coach for it.</p>

<p>And then it was the concentration on getting the most out of their two flying full-backs - Alexander-Arnold and Robertson. Given the space to play in Liverpool were ruthless with their electric front three of Salah, Mane and Roberto Firmino.</p>

<p>Assistant Pep Lijnders (left) promised Liverpool would add 'unpredictability' this season</p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara and Naby Keita are set to be central figures in a revamped Liverpool midfield</p>

<p>Sides tucked in and defended deep to negate this threat. So Liverpool found another way to win, centred on the delivery and the energy of their two wing-backs.</p>

<p>Alexander-Arnold, in particular, has been revolutionary, providing Kevin De Bruyne-esque numbers with his impact in the final third of the pitch from his position of right-back.</p>

<p>Now opposition sides know what is coming from both flanks, attention has turned to tweaking the midfield, which underpins the arrival of the metronomic Thiago. In his 45-minute cameo at Stamford Bridge this month he showcased everything that he will bring to Liverpool. Quick passing, both short and long, and the authority and calmness he brings was in full evidence at Chelsea.</p>

<p>The level of control he can exert on a match, and the angles that he can access with his range of passing, will only help Klopp's side unlock those low-block sides further. Mane and Salah will relish running onto his through balls this season.</p>

<p>Liverpool won 14 games by a single-goal margin last season - Thiago's arrival is all about increasing the margin of those victories against stubborn opponents.</p>

<p>Georginio Wijnaldum has found himself occupying more forward areas so far this season</p>

<p>What the capture of Thiago can also unlock is the attacking impetus of Wijnaldum, who could now be freed higher up the pitch in the way he has been at international level by Ronald Koeman. He scored eight times in nine appearances for the Dutch side as a midfielder charged with attacking the box.</p>

<p>Wijnaldum was stationed noticeably higher up the pitch when Thiago was introduced at Chelsea and twice came close to finding the back of the net. </p>

<p>Naby Keita is another who has much to gain from the arrival of the former Bayern Munich star. At Anfield on Monday night he started a fifth consecutive Premier League game for the first time. After a quiet first two years he is beginning to finally influence Liverpool's style in the way many envisaged when he arrived. </p>

<p>Klopp joked last week that his coaching had made Keita worse, while he struggled with injury issues and a new environment. Now he is fully settled his unique abilities are coming to the fore. On Monday night he misplaced only one of his 40 passes and was tireless in his attempts to break up opposition play. He looks set to have a big impact on Liverpool's season.</p>

<p>New formations and tactical flexibility </p>

<p>Liverpool's growing mass of midfield options is making them a much more unpredictable side now. The sheer congestion of this season's fixture calendar has led Klopp to target an increased depth of numbers in the middle third. </p>

<p>There is a reason the midfield is called 'the engine room'. It gets through so much of the unseen dirty work, and Klopp's side are no different. Currently the Liverpool boss has 10 options to choose from for his preferred midfield three. It is an embarrassment of riches, and so many provide different points of focus that allow for greater tactical variety.</p>

<p>That was in evidence in the win at Chelsea, where injuries to centre-backs Joe Gomez and Joel Matip prompted Fabinho to drop in to partner Virgil van Dijk.</p>

<p>Fabinho's ability to slip into defence provides Liverpool with an extra layer of variety</p>

<p>The Brazilian delivered a man of the match performance to rival matchwinner Sadio Mane, and successfully shackled the electric Timo Werner. Klopp will not be loathe to field him there again, as the control he brings with his range of passing can help open up teams that come only to defend.</p>

<p>Gomez, restored to the XI on Monday night, was exceptional against Arsenal both with and without the ball. He completed more dribbles in the game than anyone except Salah and Mane. Next to him, van Dijk was pinging balls forward to either flank with ease.</p>

<p>Every single starting outfield player either had a shot or created a scoring opportunity for Liverpool on Monday night. </p>

<p>In attack, the blossoming Takumi Minamino provides an option that adds even great variety. Though he has barely featured yet in the Premier League this season, what he offers was in full evidence in the Community Shield against Arsenal.</p>

<p>He came on midway through the second-half to add Liverpool a further attacking option as they chased the game. The formation, somewhere between a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-2-2-2, sacrificed a midfield player for further numbers in attack. Liverpool as a result penned back their opponents and gave them a different problem.</p>

<p>Minamino scored the equalising goal, benefiting from the confusion as Arsenal struggled to figure out who was picking up who. The Japanese international will be key in adding a fourth thrust to the already fabled front three, and providing a different central option to the effervescent Roberto Firmino.</p>

<p>The high press is getting higher</p>

<p>Sky Sports' Monday Night Football were left marvelling at Liverpool's attacking press this week. Coming a week after the victory over Chelsea, it is now increasingly obvious that the high press is getting even higher this season.</p>

<p>Both Chelsea and Arsenal played the ball out from the back and in both games Liverpool had close to seven players converging on the opposition penalty area.</p>

<p>The press is led from the front by Mane, Salah and Firmino, but it is ably backed up by the tireless Keita and Wijnaldum. And backing them up, you have Liverpool's full backs Robertson and Alexander-Arnold pressing opposition full backs.</p>

<p>Liverpool are making it even harder for opponents to get out of their own half now and attack them. They have made pressing an art form, not just because they are so fine-tuned as athletes, but because as a collective they been so well coached in it.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has been instructing his players to press higher up the pitch this season</p>

<p>If any of the elements of that pressing system are out of sync, then it is like a castle built on sand, and will crumble like a pack of cards.</p>

<p>Arsenal were still able to break free on a couple of occasions and create opportunities, indeed their opening goal came from such a situation. But this is a calculated risk that Klopp is willing to take.</p>

<p>This is why he bristled so when Roy Keane suggested Liverpool had sloppy moments, that they gave up scoring opportunities.</p>

<p>In the last two games, Liverpool limited Chelsea and Arsenal to a combined eight shots, one of which was offside. The goal they conceded was down to one inexplicable defensive error from Robertson.</p>

<p>Klopp retorted: 'That's an incredible description of this game. It was absolutely exceptional. Nothing was sloppy, absolutely nothing...' </p>

<p>'We had to be brave enough to cause them problems and that's how it worked. We didn't stop - that's very important. At half time, I liked it so much that I thought we couldn't keep it going.'</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta conceded afterwards: 'They set the bar and they're probably the best standard that the Premier League has seen in many years,' said Arteta.</p>

<p>'They have a lot of good work, a lot of belief in the way they play, great recruitment. This is where we have to get and obviously we're still a long way from getting there.'  </p>

<p>Arteta wasn't wrong, and he won't be the last Premier League manager to concede that before the end of the season.</p>
