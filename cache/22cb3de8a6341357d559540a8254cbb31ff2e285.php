<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ghost hunters have captured chilling images at a former monastery believed to be the spirit of England's 'Lost Queen' who was destined for the throne after Elizabeth I.</p>

<p>Paranormal investigators captured one of their members coming face-to-face with a spooky apparition at historic Rufford Abbey in Sherwood Forest, Notts., last week.</p>

<p>Retford Ghost Hunters believe they encountered the renowned White Lady of Rufford who, according to legend, is believed to be the spirit of ill-fated Arbella Stuart.</p>

<p>Retford Ghost Hunters' leader Rachel Parsons said she was left spooked by the image showing her seemingly inches away from a ghostly woman dressed in white (pictured)</p>

<p>She died of starvation in the Tower of London in 1615, and was the great great granddaughter of Henry VII and Mary Queen of Scots' niece.</p>

<p>The 17th century noblewoman was tipped to take the throne before she found herself at the centre of a political wrangling which saw her banished to the tower.</p>

<p>Group leader Rachel Parsons said she was left spooked by the image showing her seemingly inches away from a ghostly woman dressed in white.</p>

<p>The disturbing picture was later compared to horror film promo posters like Poltergeist and The Exorcist after the group uploaded their findings to social media.</p>

<p>It was only when Rachel researched the history of the 12th century building that she uncovered the story of it being haunted by the White Lady of Rufford.</p>

<p>Rachel, 48, who has taken part in paranormal investigations for 20 years, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I looked up the history of the place the next day.</p>

<p>Rachel, who has taken part in paranormal investigations for 20 years, said she sensed something on the spot where she was standing as she urged viewers who were watching the live stream on Facebook to get screenshotting</p>

<p>'The first thing that came up was the White Lady Of Rufford. She's been spotted there quite a few times by all accounts.</p>

<p>'It was about 11pm inside the ruins when we all heard a woman's cough so I ran towards the direction of it with my torch.</p>

<p>'I then sensed something on the spot where I was and I said to the others: 'She's standing right in front of me'.</p>

<p>Rachel researched the history of the Rufford Abbey in Sherwood Forest, Notts., and uncovered the story of it being haunted by the White Lady of Rufford (pictured)</p>

<p>'At that point I told our viewers watching the live stream on Facebook to get screenshotting because I knew she was there.</p>

<p>'It was only when we got back home and a viewer sent the screen grab that I discovered how close I was to her.</p>

<p>'People have said it looks like a horror movie poster but I was just delighted to get such compelling evidence of what could be the famous White Lady of Rufford.'</p>

<p>The group also captured spooky images showing a face at a doorway, which they believe could be the spirit of one of the monks who resided at the abbey.</p>

<p>One viewer spotted the face of a monk in one of the doorways which led to the dining room where they would eat and talk</p>

<p>The White Lady Of Rufford has been spotted at the historic Rufford Abbey in Sherwood Forest, Notts. quite a few times</p>

<p>Lady Arbella Stuart(1575 – 25 September 1615) was an English noblewoman who was considered a possible successor to Queen Elizabeth I of England.</p>

<p>Arbella's father died in 1576 when she was an infant and she was raised by her mother Elizabeth Cavendish, Countess of Lennox. </p>

<p>Her mother too died and seven-year-old Arbella became an orphan, in 1582. and became the ward of her grandmother.</p>

<p>During the reign of king James VI and I she married William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset in secret. King James imprisoned William Seymour and placed her under house arrest. </p>

<p>When she and her husband tried to escape England, she was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London. </p>

<p>She never saw her husband again and in her days as a prisoner in the Tower of London, Arbella Seymour refused to eat. </p>

<p>She subsequently fell ill and died at the age of 39 on 25 September 1615. She was buried in Westminster Abbey on 29 September.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The 'defined face with chiselled cheekbones' appeared at a doorway which would have led to the monks' dining room at the English Heritage site.</p>

<p>Rachel said the face appeared as she called out to ghosts at the Cistercian abbey, which was one of the first to be affected by King Henry VIII dissolution of the monastery.</p>

<p>She added 'Earlier in the night, another viewer spotted the face of a monk in one of the doorways which led to the dining room where they would eat and talk.</p>

<p>'There's only ruins left there and the face appeared in one the few remaining parts of the building which is still intact.</p>

<p>'It's an amazing defined face with very chiseled cheekbones.</p>

<p>'It was only there for a few seconds then disappeared - I think whoever he was he was just wanting to know what we were doing.</p>

<p>'He looks to me to be only in his 30s or 40s but it was a hard life for monks - there was lots of disease and they died young.'</p>

<p>Mental health worker Rachel, who developed an interest in errant spirits after having paranormal experiences as a young girl, described the findings as 'fantastic evidence'.</p>

<p>She said: 'I grew up in a very religious family and so this kind of thing wasn't encouraged but it gives people some comfort and belief that there may be an afterlife.</p>

<p>'We like to keep things respectful and keep getting fantastic evidence so we must be sending out some positive energy.'</p>
