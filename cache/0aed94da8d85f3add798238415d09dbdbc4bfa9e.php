<p>Reese's has unveiled a decadent peanut butter-flavoured ice cream, sandwiched between two chocolate cookies</p>

<p>Australian shoppers can find the ice cream sandwiches in the freezer aisle at Coles, available in a pack of three for just $8.50, about $2.83 each</p>

<p>One foodie who tasted the new creation rated the treat a nine out of 10, adding the brand was very generous with its peanut butter.</p>

<p>The new sandwich joins the Reese's range of ice cream in supermarkets.</p>

<p>Among the $8.50 peanut butter chocolate-flavoured products are the ice cream tubs, four pack of ice cream sticks and a four pack of cones.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, a Melbourne snack reviewer shared their glowing reviews on the brand's popular ice cream cones. </p>

<p>The creamy dessert consists of the brand's famous peanut butter cups, which are finely grounded and blended into the silky smooth ice cream</p>

<p>'I had the tub version and absolutely loved it. So, the cone version was a no brainer,' the founder of Neko Snacks wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>'Peanuts on top, peanut butter ice cream, chocolate ice cream, chocolate drizzle over the top and an inner peanut butter core. </p>

<p>'The flavour is so damn good. It's salty, sweet, nutty, chocolatey plus the cone adds an extra delicious dimension to it all. Plus that thick PB core is just amazing.' </p>
