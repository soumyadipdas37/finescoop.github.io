<p>There are two bedrooms and one bathroom, as well as a screened-in porch and a shed in the backyard. </p>

<p>As you make your way from the living room to the kitchen, you must pass through a sectioned off dining space perfect for an intimate dinner.</p>

<p>Complete with white cabinetry and coordinating crown molding, the nearly 100-year-old house's kitchen set-up is undeniably airy and leads directly into the sunroom.   </p>

<p>Intimate: As you make your way from the living room to the kitchen, you must pass through a sectioned off dining space perfect for an intimate dinner</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the home, which features pale grey walls, the sunroom is given an added sense of brightness due its unique white wood panel walls and ceiling.</p>

<p>Like the living room, the sunroom also happens to have a fireplace, which gives the room a more rustic feel.</p>

<p>As you swing open the wood doors that lead outside, guest and occupants come face to face with a tranquil, screened in back porch.</p>

<p>The master bedroom includes two large windows that allow a ton of light to flood the room and is just big enough to sleep a couple comfortably.</p>

<p>The second bedroom features a more narrow layout and appeared to be the perfect place for Kacey and Ruston to store their instruments, while also offering a place for guests to lay their heads. </p>
