<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother of a 15-year-old girl who was left suicidal after an older chef pressured her into having sex has branded the £700 fine he was handed 'an insult'.</p>

<p>Jack Cross, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, admitted begging the victim for sex after meeting her on social media.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old preyed on the schoolgirl in 2017 and after persistently asking her to meet him, they had unprotected sex on two occasions.</p>

<p>Persistent Jack Cross pressurised the schoolgirl to have sex with him and admitted three charges of sexual activity with a child at Warwick Crown Court</p>

<p>Cross was caught after the girl's teacher heard rumours that she might be pregnant and questioned her.</p>

<p>He was arrested and on Tuesday (8 September) he admitted three charges of sexual activity with a child at Warwick Crown Court.</p>

<p>Outraged, the girl's stepfather stormed out of the court after Cross was spared jail and handed a 12-month community order.</p>

<p>He was also ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work and ordered to register as a sex offender for five years.</p>

<p>The judge offered to order Cross to pay the victim £700 compensation but her mother refused, branding it 'an insult'.</p>

<p>In a victim impact statement, the court heard the girl suffered flashbacks and felt suicidal.</p>

<p>She added that she 'would go to a train station and hope that a train came,' and 'sometimes sat down with a knife'.</p>

<p>Recorder Charles Falk said: 'I have read her victim impact statement, and it makes grim reading.'</p>

<p>The court heard sous chef left his victim suicidal after pressurising her into having sex with him </p>

<p>He told Cross: 'You are now a young man of 19, two weeks off from your 20th birthday. These offences all took place in 2017.</p>

<p>'It is important for you to understand that the law draws a line on a young person's 16th birthday, and you fell on the wrong side of it.</p>

<p>'You were well aware of what you were doing, but you continued to go ahead.</p>

<p>'What you need to understand is that children have a right to be protected.</p>

<p>'That is why the law is there, and the law expects other people to accept those boundaries.</p>

<p>'You were still a young person yourself, and not yet an adult in the eyes of the law.</p>

<p>'But as the older participant you should have shown responsibility, but you sought to persuade and cajole and inveigle her to take part in sexual intercourse.'</p>

<p>Warwick Crown Court heard how Cross had sex with the girl at her home while her mother was out - once in her bedroom and a second time in the living room</p>

<p>Recorder Falk asked the girl's mother whether she would accept £700 compensation or whether it would be 'adding insult to injury'.</p>

<p>The mother replied: 'The second one.'</p>

<p>Instead, Cross was ordered to pay £700 court costs.</p>

<p>Peter Cooper, prosecutor, said that in 2017 Cross and the girl had arranged to meet after chatting on social media..</p>

<p>Cross then began continually asking her for sex, despite knowing she was only 15, 'and in the end she agreed'.</p>

<p>The court heard Cross had sex with the girl at her home while her mother was out - once in her bedroom and another time in the living room.</p>

<p>When he was arrested Cross, who accepted he knew she was only 15, claimed that on the first occasion the girl had instigated sex.</p>

<p>Amy Jackson, defending, said: 'He accepts he had come to realise before the sexual activity occurred that she was under 16. </p>

<p>The court heard Cross and his family had suffered harassment and threats and had left the area and he was now working as a sous chef.</p>
