<p>David was mayor of Verviers from 1798 until his death in 1839.</p>

<p>David governed the city during various regimes and after the revolution of 1830, made sure that peace returned to the city and oversaw, among other things, that Verviers had its own fire brigade and secondary school.</p>

<p>David died unexpectedly in 1839 at 58 and the local authorities reportedly decided to keep his heart.</p>

<p>According to several historical accounts, the heart was kept in the town hall for 44 years until 1883, when it is said to have been buried in the heart of the city under the fountain.</p>

<p>The legend of the heart under the fountain has now been verified and it will be on display for visitors to come and see.</p>

<p>The little black box, which has not been opened, is now part of an exhibition on the first floor of the Museum of Fine Arts in Rue Renier in a space specially designed in memory of the city's first mayor, which also includes documents from the municipal archives.</p>
