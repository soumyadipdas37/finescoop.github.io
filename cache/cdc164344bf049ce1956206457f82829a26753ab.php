<p>The 36-year-old has made the extraordinary claim as he seeks to end the Ukrainian's undefeated record in their showdown on October 31.</p>

<p>He is also looking to reclaim his status as WBO mandatory challenger despite a 32-9 record.</p>

<p>Dereck Chisora has fired a warning to upcoming opponent Oleksandr Usyk</p>

<p>The 36-year-old is seeking to end the Ukrainian's undefeated record in the ring next month</p>

<p>'I am not losing. I'm going all out, guns blazing,' Chisora told Sky Sports.  </p>

<p>'The way I will come for him will be unbelievable. I will go through him. </p>

<p>'I don't think, in the heavyweight game, there is anybody stronger than me right now.</p>

<p>'Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury, Dillian Whyte, Deontay Wilder? No, they aren't stronger than me.</p>

<p>'I'm stronger, crazier and I want it more.' </p>

<p>Chisora believes he is stronger than everyone in the heavyweight division - even Tyson Fury</p>

<p>Chisora insists he is 'stronger, crazier and wants it more' than rivals, including Anthony Joshua</p>

<p>Usyk and Chisora were originally set to go head-to-head on May 23, but the fight was delayed due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic </p>

<p>Now after a hiatus of more than five months, they will collide at the end of October, with a venue to be confirmed soon. </p>

<p>Usyk has become the undisputed cruiserweight king, but is now targeting all the world heavyweight belts to keep himself on course for a WBO mandatory title fight with Anthony Joshua.</p>

<p>But the 33-year-old must first turn his attentions to defeating Chisora, who overpowered Artur Szpilka at The O2 in July last year, 12 months after his stunning eighth-round knockout of Carlos Takam at the same location. </p>

<p>Ukranian star Usyk was originally set to enter the ring against opponent Chisora on May 23</p>
