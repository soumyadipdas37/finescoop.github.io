<p>But a victory for Kem Cetinay in this year's Soccer Aid might have already slipped through his fingers as he reportedly suffered an excruciating injury during training and might have to sit out the charity match. </p>

<p>The reality star, 24, and his appearance on the Soccer Aid World XI squad this weekend is in jeopardy after he revealed he pushed himself 'too hard' and tore his hamstring muscle.</p>

<p>Out of action? Kem Cetinay revealed that he might not be able to play in this weekend's Soccer Aid match after he tore his hamstring muscle after pushing himself too hard during training</p>

<p>He told The Sun: 'I was pushing myself too hard and one day I heard it pop and I was in agony. It happened about three weeks before the game.</p>

<p>'It started bruising up straight away so I knew it was bad. The next day I saw the physio and he said I’d torn it.</p>

<p>'He was like, "Realistically you probably shouldn’t play but we can give it our best shot", so I’m just hoping for the best.</p>

<p>The Love Islander, 24, said: 'I was pushing myself too hard and one day I heard it pop and I was in agony. It happened about three weeks before the game. It started bruising up straight away'</p>

<p>'I’d rather get injured again in the game and play a bit than watch on the side and feel gutted. I’ll just see how I get on.</p>

<p>His reality star pal, Mark Wright, reportedly suffered a similar fate in 2019 when he tore his hamstring.</p>

<p>He was able to battle through and make it onto the Soccer Aid pitch alongside the likes of Mo Farah and Joe Wicks, and he has been guiding Kem through his recovery.   </p>

<p>Advice: His reality star pal Mark Wright reportedly suffered a similar injury last year but was able to make it to the Soccer Aid pitch and has been advising Kem on his recovery</p>

<p>The Love Island winner said: 'All the boys have been great and supportive. As soon as I did it, Mark Wright called me because he did the exact same thing last year. </p>

<p>'He was taking me through his exercises, really helping me out.'</p>

<p>'I was so demoralised. I know to others it’s just a game, but I was so excited for it, I was gutted.'    </p>

<p>Injuries: Kem is up against the England squad, and their team captain, Olly Murs, recently underwent knee surgery which could affect his performance at this weekend's match</p>

<p>Kem is up against the England squad, and their team captain, Olly Murs, recently underwent knee surgery which could affect his performance on the weekend.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen if both men will play, and if they will be able to bring their 'A' game to the pitch.  </p>

<p>For the moment, the ball is no longer in Kem's court as he hopes to recovers in time and get the green light to play at the upcoming charity match. </p>

<p>Risky business: Kem hopes he can make it onto the pitch, and would rather risk getting injured a second time during the game then sit the entire match out and watch from the sidelines</p>
