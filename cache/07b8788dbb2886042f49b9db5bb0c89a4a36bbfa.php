<p>RIP: On Tuesday, the late great Robin Williams' widow Susan Schneider discussed the 'invisible monster' that caused him to take his life by suicide, at age 63, six years ago</p>

<p>Brain scan: The legendary comedian - who was a Tony away from elite EGOT status - was incorrectly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three months before his death, but he was actually suffering from Lewy body dementia</p>

<p>'I was called in to sit down to go over the coroner's report. They sat me and down and said he essentially Robin died of diffused Lewy body dementia. They started to talk about the neurodegeneration. He wasn't in his right mind.'</p>

<p>Susan continued: 'I was relieved it had a name. Robin and I had gone through this experience together, really being chased by an invisible monster. And it was like whack-a-mole with the symptoms. I left there with a name of the disease, the thing that Robin and I had been searching for.'</p>

<p>The UCSF director of memory and aging, Dr. Bruce Miller, said he was 'amazed' that 'Robin could walk or move at all' after coming down with the deadly neurodegenerative disorder.</p>

<p>Schneider remembered the confusion Williams experienced when instructed by his doctors to sleep in a separate bed from her in order to get some relief from the insomnia that comes with Lewy.</p>

<p>Susan continued: 'I was called in to sit down to go over the coroner's report. They sat me and down and said he essentially Robin died of diffused Lewy body dementia. They started to talk about the neurodegeneration. He wasn't in his right mind'</p>

<p>'It's a killer': The UCSF director of memory and aging, Dr. Bruce Miller, said he was 'amazed' that 'Robin could walk or move at all' after coming down with the deadly neurodegenerative disorder</p>

<p>'He said to me, "Does this mean we're separated?" And that was a really shocking moment,' the American Brain Foundation vice chair said.</p>

<p>'When your best friend, your partner, your love, you realize that there's a giant chasm somewhere, and you can't see where it is. But that's just not based in reality. That was a hard moment.'</p>

<p>Susan - who met the twice-divorced father-of-three at an Apple Store in 2008 before marrying in 2011 - also fondly recalled how he said his life goal was to 'help people be less afraid.'</p>
