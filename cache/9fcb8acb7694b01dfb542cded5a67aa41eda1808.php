<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A wedding videographer has revealed he has filmed 100 funerals since April after making the 'daunting' choice to switch his services amid the Covid-19 crisis.</p>

<p>Ian Wilkinson, from Rothley, Leicestershire, usually films about 40 weddings a year with his company Confetti Wedding Videos.  </p>

<p>But the videographer decided to change his offering in April after global coronavirus restrictions left fewer mourners able to attend funerals.</p>

<p>Speaking to the BBC, he said the switch had been 'daunting', adding: 'I think the thing that hit me most was the sensitivity of it and how it could actually upset me inside listening to the amazing things people have done.'</p>

<p>Ian Wilkinson, from Rothley, Leicestershire,has revealed he has filmed 100 funerals since April after making the 'daunting' switch his services amid the Covid-19 crisis</p>

<p>Ian said he usually films 40 weddings each year but said he began filming funerals after he saw his bookings plummet amid the Covid-19 crisis </p>

<p>While the crisis means there are fewer weddings to shoot, more people are now filming their final goodbyes to loved ones. </p>

<p>He said he began filming funerals after the coronavirus pandemic led to the cancellation of many of his wedding bookings.</p>

<p>The videographer explained: 'It was daunting, but as a videographer you have to film lots of different things, so like all projects you adapt to it.'  </p>

<p>'So the feedback I've had from relatives that can't be there has been actually truly amazing.'</p>

<p>The videographer said he often  live-streams the funerals across the world, and said the feedback he has received has been 'truly amazing'</p>

<p>While most of his weddings are London based, Ian regularly films weddings across the country. </p>

<p>He has since live-streamed funerals across the world because Covid-19 restrictions have meant fewer people could attend services.   </p>

<p>While his wedding package costs at least £1195, it is unknown what the cost of Ian's funeral services are. </p>

<p>He said initially, many of the funerals he was filming were for victims of the virus, saying: 'I would say in April and May, two out of every three people I filmed had passed away from coronavirus.</p>

<p>Ian said initially many of the funerals he was filming were people who had died from coronavirus </p>

<p>'However they were in the autumn of their lives.'</p>

<p>Despite more than doubling his bookings this year, Ian said he is determined to continue in the wedding industry.</p>

<p>He revealed: 'You know weddings is what I like doing, it's very creative. So I will continue to film weddings, probably not on the scale of what I used to do before.</p>

<p>'I've never done anything that I've felt so good about doing for other people.'</p>

<p>More than 73,000 weddings and civil partnership ceremonies were cancelled after a ban was declared at the start of lockdown in March.</p>

<p>Last month, the Government declared they could resume, but capped the number of guest to 30. </p>

<p>Addressing Parliament last week, Boris Johnson confirmed wedding guest numbers would be capped at 15 - but 30 mourners are allowed at funerals. </p>
