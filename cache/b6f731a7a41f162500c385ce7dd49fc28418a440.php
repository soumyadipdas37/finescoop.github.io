<p>His grieving family said the loss was 'heart wrenching' for his unnamed daughter, who shared a bond with him 'like no other'.</p>

<p>Her older sister, Chantel Farleigh, has started a Go Fund Me page on her little sister's behalf to raise money for 'a beautiful final goodbye' for Mr Stockdale. </p>

<p>'Anybody who has experienced a loss would know funeral expenses aren't cheap nor are their many payment options,' Ms Farleigh wrote.</p>

<p>'I'm reaching out for my baby sister, so she can create the goodbye she believes her father deserves, in which he very much does deserve it.' </p>

<p>Ms Farleigh said the thought of explaining to her little sister her father's body would be handed over to the state to be cremated, instead of buried, if arrangements could not be made 'absolutely breaks her heart'. </p>

<p>'With both of Richard's parents deceased, he doesn't have a large network to cover the expenses, and it is with such little financial option that we reach out for donations to give Richard and my baby sister the goodbye they both deserve,' she said.</p>

<p>'It's a Father's Day she will never forget, and this day truly deserves to be remembered for her.</p>

<p>'There is no amount of appreciation in the world to give for even just cents of donations and to share this story as far as you can.'  </p>
