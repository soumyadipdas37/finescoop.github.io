<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you have a spare bedroom that rarely gets used, you might have considered turning it into a dressing room.</p>

<p>And when one couple were quoted more than £1,000 by IKEA to turn the room into an amazing walk-in wardrobe, they decided to do it themselves.</p>

<p>Hari Harris, 25, a father-of-one and retail manager from Shropshire, had a spare room in his home that he was keen to turn into a space for his clothes.</p>

<p>After seeing the expensive price from IKEA, Hari and his partner Jamie decided to undertake the project themselves using DIY kits from B&amp;Q.</p>

<p>They created the walk-in wardrobe of their dreams for less than £370, saving hundreds of pounds as a result.</p>

<p>After: Hari Harris and his partner Jamie were quoted £1,000 by IKEA to turn their spare room into a walk-in wardrobe so decided to do it themselves. Pictured, the room after the makeover</p>

<p>Before: The couple found they did not use the spare bedroom (pictured) and decided it would be better used as a large walk-in wardrobe</p>

<p>Hari told money-saving community LatestDeals.co.uk: 'We had recently renovated our home and after the main jobs were done, we moved onto the bedroom.</p>

<p>'After discussing ideas, we decided to remove the wardrobe in the bedroom and use the unused guest bedroom as a wardrobe.</p>

<p>B&amp;Q Form Pole &amp; Satelit Matt white Wardrobe Dressing kit x2: £220</p>

<p>Form Pole Matt white Wardrobe Dressing kit x 2: £45 </p>

<p>Dunelm canvas boxes x 3: £8</p>

<p>The Range and B&amp;Q accessories: £50 </p>

<p>'We looked at many ideas and designs, and even had an online quote done from IKEA which came in way over £1,000 so we looked for the next alternatives but were set on having an open wardrobe.</p>

<p>'By chance, we went shopping in B&amp;Q for some paint and came across the form dressing kit.</p>

<p>'We purchased two form pole and satelit matt white dressing kits at £110 each and two form pole matt white wardrobe dressing kits at £45 each. We then purchased the canvas boxes from Dunelm for three for £8.</p>

<p>'It was all flat pack and took us roughly two hours to build. It was a DIY pack so we just followed the instructions.</p>

<p>'They're secured to the walls and floors with the L brackets provided. There are so many different designs and they can all be cut down to fit!'</p>

<p>Hari said the trip to B&amp;Q was worth it because of the money he and Jamie saved whilst ending up with a very similar outcome to what it would have looked like from IKEA. </p>

<p>'I also spent £50 on accessories for the room from The Range and B&amp;Q,' he added. </p>

<p>Hari and Jamie sourced flatpack wardrobe kits from B&amp;Q instead of IKEA</p>

<p>They ended up with their wonderful walk-in wardrobe which houses all of their clothes, shoes and accessories such as sunglasses</p>

<p>Hari, who shares his home transformations on Instagram at <?php echo e('@'); ?>house_number_twelve, is delighted with the transformation and found it to be an excellent distraction during the lockdown.</p>

<p>'During the lockdown, we managed to complete a garden makeover and a dressing room makeover,' he adds.</p>

<p>'It gave us something to concentrate on as well as being rewarding - after all, DIY is most rewarding when the job is complete!</p>

<p>'We've been renovating our home for two years and with just one room left to do it's finally coming to an end.</p>

<p>Hari is delighted with the transformation and found it to be an excellent distraction during the lockdown</p>

<p>'My main tips would be to shop around and look because the savings can be huge.</p>

<p>'The B&amp;Q kits were easy to build, and can be cut down to fit the room so any space can be transformed.'</p>

<p>Tom Church, co-founder of LatestDeals.co.uk, comments: 'One would normally think that IKEA would always be one of the most affordable options, but as Hari and Jamie prove, shopping around can save you huge amounts.</p>

<p>'By sourcing their flatpack wardrobe kits from B&amp;Q instead of IKEA, they saved over £650 and ended up with virtually the same result: a stunning walk-in wardrobe!'</p>

<p>Hari added: 'It gave us something to concentrate on as well as being rewarding - after all, DIY is most rewarding when the job is complete!</p>
