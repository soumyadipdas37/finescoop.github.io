<p>'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself,' it continued.</p>

<p>'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us the extra time we were able to spend with her.</p>
