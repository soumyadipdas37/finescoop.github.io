<p>The murder was described as a 'senseless impulsive act of extreme violence' by Crown Prosecutor Mitch McClenaghan during her trial. </p>

<p>While Justice Gerald Nation acknowledged her troubled upbringing among gangs with repeated violence and neglect had led to a pattern of violent behaviour.  </p>

<p>Epiha was sentenced to at least ten years in prison in May 2019, as part of a life sentence over the murder charge.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old is facing another five year charge for escaping custody - on top of her existing prison sentence.</p>
