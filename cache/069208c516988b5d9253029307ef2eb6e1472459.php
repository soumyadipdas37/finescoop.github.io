<p>'We're not trying, but we're not doing anything to prevent it,' she told The Courier-Mail earlier this year. </p>

<p>It also follows the traumatic delivery of Romi, the couple's second child, in November 2019. </p>

<p>Shortly after the birth, Boyd spoke about the 'trauma' he experienced watching his wife and then unborn child battle for lives. </p>

<p>Ms Boyd (pictured with her daughter) said she hoped to fall pregnant with the couple's third by the end of 2020</p>

<p>Ms Boyd and the child became distressed during the labour process, forcing medical staff to perform an emergency caesarean to save their lives.</p>

<p>'It was pretty awful seeing Kayla in such pain, going through contractions while they tried to put an anaesthetic needle in her back,' Boyd told New Idea.</p>

<p>Mum and bub eventually pulled through, and Romi was born three weeks early on September 28, 2019. </p>

<p>She weight 3.2kg and came following a miscarriage and abortion in 2016, and a failed IVF attempt.</p>

<p>'We didn't have anything prepared,' Ms Boyd said. </p>

<p>'But Romi was ready and knew what we needed in our lives before we knew.' </p>

<p>The introverted footballer said he cried with relief at the happy outcome. </p>

<p>She arrived three weeks premature, keeping her parents on their toes before her entry into the world. Pictured: Romi Yves Boyd</p>

<p>Boyd was raised by a single mother, and has never known the identity of his father, making his time with his growing family incredibly precious. </p>

<p>'I just want to grow my own little family,' Boyd said. </p>

<p>'I was an only child and sometimes, seeing Willow around other kids, I felt she was lonely and needed a sibling.' </p>

<p>Baby Romi helped put football strains to the back of Boyd's mind.</p>

<p>'I just remember looking up at Darius and he was crying, I was crying,' Ms Boyd told The Courier-Mail in December 2019, adding she hoped to fall pregnant with the couple's third by the end of 2020.</p>

<p>'If it did happen we'd be so happy.'</p>
