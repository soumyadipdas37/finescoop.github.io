<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Murder hornets could spread 'rapidly' across America if action is not taken to contain them, scientists have warned.</p>

<p>A male Asian giant hornet was trapped by researchers in Whatcom County, Washington, earlier this year - the first ever male of the species to be found in the US.</p>

<p>Seven others have been discovered since July 14 which has prompted fears that the country could soon be facing an invasion.</p>

<p>'This could be, if it were to become established, one of the most damaging invasive species that we could almost imagine,' said Washington State University entomologist David Crowder. </p>

<p>Seven others have been discovered since July 14 which has prompted fears that the country could soon be facing an invasion (the male Asian giant hornet pictured)</p>

<p>The study carried out by the university analyzed more than 200 records from the insect's native habitats in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.</p>

<p>It determined that due to their preferred climate they may colonize parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia within the next 20 years.</p>

<p>The Washington State Department of Agriculture (WDSA) have now set-up 1,400 traps in the area to capture the hornets live in order to tag and track them back to the nest.</p>

<p>If researchers are able to locate a nest, it will be eradicated. </p>

<p>Asian hornets have a dark brown or black velvety body, have a yellow or orange band on the fourth segment of the abdomen and have yellow-tipped legs. </p>

<p>They are the world's largest species of hornet and typically measure around two inches long. </p>

<p>Asian giant hornets are more than double the size of honeybees, and have a wingspan measuring more than three inches</p>

<p>In December 2019, the WSDA received and verified two reports of Asian giant hornet near Blaine, Washington, close to the Canadian border.</p>

<p>These were the first-ever sighting in the United States. </p>

<p>Canada had also discovered Asian giant hornet in two locations in British Columbia in the fall of 2019. </p>

<p>Asian giant hornets target honeybee hives and can kill 40 bees in under one minute.</p>

<p>The hornets enter a 'slaughter phase' where they kill bees by decapitating them before then defending the hive as their own and taking the brood to feed their own young.  </p>

<p>The species does not tend to attack people or pets but can be fierce when threatened.  </p>

<p>Their stinger is also longer than that of a honeybee, which means it can sting though beekeeping suits.</p>

<p>The Washington Department of Agriculture announced that officials captured their first Asian giant hornet (pictured) in a bottle trap in Watcom County</p>

<p>It also delivers nearly seven times the amount of venom that contains neurotoxin, which is capable of causing both cardiac arrest and anaphylactic shock, the department said.</p>

<p>It has previously been stated that multiple stings can kill humans even if they are not allergic. </p>

<p>'Preventing the establishment and spread of Asian giant hornets in western North America is critical for protecting bees and beekeepers,' said Crowder. </p>

<p>The bee population has been on a concerning decline for years and their eradication could have detrimental affects on the environment. </p>

<p>A survey by the U.S. National Agriculture Statistics Services showed that  the population declined from six million hives in 1947 to 2.4 million hives in 2008, a 60 per cent reduction. </p>
