<p>One August 21 page titled 'Revolutionary Strategy' includes the note 'Stalin - defend USSR at all costs' and 'Trotsky — United front of all working class but don't let capitalists in,' sources said.</p>

<p>Sources say that notes mention the Spanish Civil War, and a declaration 'failure of leadership' led to the end of the revolution of 1936.   </p>

<p>'Some think actual revolution will be lead by more deliberate leadership,' Kraebber said in her notes, according to sources. </p>

<p>Kraebber was once a fan of then-US Rep Beto O'Rourke's 2018 bid to unseat Senator Ted Cruz and had donated $121 to the Rice Young Democrats PAC, but she had since declared her disdain for mainstream liberal politics. </p>

<p>'Anyone who f–ks with Democrats can't be leadership,' she stated.  </p>
