<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A French woman has been arrested for filming herself naked on a holy bridge in India to promote her necklace-selling business.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old now faces charges under India's internet law and up to three years behind bars if found guilty.</p>

<p>'She told us she sells bead necklaces online and the shoot was aimed at promoting her business,' R.K. Saklani, head of the police station, said. </p>

<p>But the woman said she posted the video to raise awareness of harassment that females experience in India. </p>

<p>The Lakshman Jhula footbridge over the Ganges river in India, made famous by the Beatles in the 1960s</p>

<p>Authorities detained Marie-Helene on Thursday after she allegedly posted footage of herself on the Lakshman Jhula in Rishikesh. </p>

<p>The footbridge over the Ganges river was made famous by the Beatles in the 1960s and remains a draw for backpackers and yoga practitioners.</p>

<p>'Maybe in France these things are not considered objectionable,' Saklani said.</p>

<p>'But Rishikesh is a holy place and the Lakshman Jhula is the place where (Hindu gods) Ram, his brother Lakshman and wife Sita crossed the Ganges.'</p>

<p>Police identified Marie-Helene by her first name only and said she had been in Rishikesh since March - just before its nationwide coronavirus lockdown was imposed.  </p>

<p>The woman apologised on Sunday and said 'I am sorry my actions hurt the local community'. </p>

<p>'I was lacking awareness on cultural specificities,' she added. </p>

<p>Marie-Helene told AFP though that no-one else was around when she carried out the stunt, and she did it to raise awareness over harassment in India.</p>

<p>'I chose to partially uncover on Laxman Jhula because each time I crossed the bridge I felt I was being harassed.</p>

<p>'My Indian sisters and fellow female travelers surely have experienced the same,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Marie-Helene told AFP though that no-one was around when she carried out the stunt, and she did it to raise awareness about harassment in India (file photo)</p>

<p>'The main goal was to help oppressed Indian women to access education and to leave abusive marriages or situations, where there are no other options or help.'</p>

<p>The French woman had also taken naked pictures inside a hotel room, Saklani added.</p>

<p>Police were alerted after the footage and photos were posted on social media.</p>

<p>The woman has been released on bail and the case could take months to complete, the officer said. </p>

<p>Her mobile phone was seized as part of the investigation. </p>
