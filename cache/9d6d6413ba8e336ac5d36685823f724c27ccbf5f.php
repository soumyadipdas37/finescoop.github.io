<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Maybe there's something in this Nappy Factor after all. Written off by many in the build-up to the US Open, a visibly more relaxed Rory McIlroy opened with a fine 67 on Thursday for his lowest first round score in a major since his last victory in 2014.</p>

<p>It was just the start the Northern Irishman needed following his sketchy form post-lockdown. It was also the perfect antidote to finding himself playing catch-up at a number of recent majors after poor first rounds, most notably at the Open last year, where he started with a horrific 78.</p>

<p>'I think I was putting myself under too much pressure to start well but today I resolved to just accept what the course gave me rather than trying to force anything,' he explained.</p>

<p>Rory McIlroy took advantage of favourable conditions to make a strong start to the US Open</p>

<p>The Northern Irishman opened with a fine round of 67 at Winged Foot on Thursday</p>

<p>Justin Thomas leads the way at Winged Foot after a fabulous pace-setting 65 on Thursday</p>

<p>What the course gave him was a wonderful opportunity to begin strongly, owing to the rather curious decision by the organisers to go against the tournament's raison d'etre and offer soft greens of the kind seen most weeks on the PGA Tour.</p>

<p>Driving the ball long and straight, leaving him with short irons to inviting targets, it was heaven-sent for McIlroy to the extent he was a little frustrated at the finish to close with a score of only three under par.</p>

<p>At the driveable par four 6th, his wondrous tee shot finished 30ft from the hole, only to three putt. 'I felt like I was in control of my game for most of the round,' he said. 'If anything, I'm a little disappointed it wasn't lower but I'm not about to complain.' </p>

<p>Nor was world number three Justin Thomas, following a fabulous pace-setting 65. As he said: 'The greens were softer than I expected but it's still Winged Foot and you still have to hit the shots.' </p>

<p>That he did for a one stroke lead over former Masters champion Patrick Reed, who rode his luck, hitting just five fairways but getting away with it courtesy of an ace and some freakily good lies in the rough. Alongside him is the Belgian Thomas Pieters, like McIlroy another new parent, who came here following a couple of good results on the UK swing.</p>

<p>The same could not be said for Tiger Woods as he suffered a miserable opening at Winged Foot</p>

<p>A wild shot played from a bunker hampered woods as he finished poorly in the opening round</p>

<p>'I definitely think becoming a father has freed my mind up a little and helped me become more accepting of bad shots,' said Pieters.</p>

<p>Alongside McIlroy is the veteran Lee Westwood who, in his prime, always looked like he would win the US Open one day. His performance was a rare bright spot among the English contingent, with Tyrrell Hatton, Matt Fitzpatrick and Tommy Fleetwood all shooting 74.</p>

<p>Among the afternoon wave, world number one Dustin Johnson has left himself with work to do after a 73. It was always a big ask to come here straight after his big FedEx Cup success but at least the damage can be repaired with a good round this morning.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the favoured in the build-up will be quietly content. World number two Jon Rahm never had the pace of the greens all day but still shot 69, one more than the quietly impressive American, Xander Schauffele.</p>

<p>With conditions so favourable for the sluggers, it was no surprise to see Bryson DeChambeau become yet another to break 70, as he opened with a 69.</p>

<p>Spectators gathered together in the trees to catch a glimpse of the opening round</p>

<p>Thomas was playing alongside Tiger Woods, who mixed plenty of good holes with too many bad ones. Standing over a long putt on the 9th, he was two over par and struggling. Enter his priceless Scotty Cameron putter, the wand with which he won 14 of his 15 majors. Tiger sank that unlikely putt for the first of three birdies in a row. A fourth slipped just by, and with it the momentum went the other way, as he followed it with two more costly mistakes. Once more, the putter came to the rescue with a 30ft birdie putt at the 16th.</p>

<p>He couldn't keep it going, alas. In sight of a heartening level par round, he followed a bogey at the 17th with a duffed chip and a dispiriting double bogey at the 18th for a 73.</p>

<p>Former USPGA Champion Thomas, by contrast, kept on making birdies. He spoke on Tuesday of his instant love of this layout, and showed it with the way he shaped one great shot after another. A more typical Winged Foot test will surely emerge over the next three days but the 28 year old American has all the shots to cope.</p>

<p>'I'm obviously delighted to have posted that round over such a beautiful course,' he said. 'It was a sweet day's work.' Not everyone found Winged Foot easy. The biggest casualty of all was Collin Morikawa, the 23 year old who won the USPGA Championship in such impressive style. Here there was an obvious reaction, as he hit the ball all over the place and ended up carding a 76 that leaves him facing an uphill task simply to make the halfway cut.</p>

<p>A good first day, therefore, if one where the set-up offered far too much of an advantage for the longer hitters, hence a leaderboard where they dominate. If truth be told, it was more like a top PGA Tour event than the major that's supposed to test players to the limit.</p>

<p>Let's hope the sub-air system under all 18 greens was left on full blast overnight - and by Friday morning, we get the US Open back.</p>

<p>Ex-world No 1 McIlroy is looking to get a first major title since the 2014 US PGA Championship</p>
