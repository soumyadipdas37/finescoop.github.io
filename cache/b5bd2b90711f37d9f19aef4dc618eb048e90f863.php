<p>Honest: Megan Barton Hanson has revealed that she split with former beau Wes Nelson when he put money and his career above their relationship. They are pictured together in 2018</p>

<p>It comes as last week Wes revealed he became a millionaire at the age of just 21 following a series of TV appearances and canny investments with his earnings.</p>

<p>Speaking on the Independent's Millennial Love podcast, Megan said: 'I don't have a bad word to say about him but that relationship broke down ultimately because of our priorities.</p>

<p>'So he was very career-driven, taking every job under the sun and rightly so.</p>

<p>Candid: The Love Island star, 26, split with Wes last year after meeting on the reality show in 2018, originally saying it was due to them being at different stages in their lives</p>

<p>'But because I'd already experienced having money fairly easy with the stripping, I was more dedicated and focused on the relationship, so it's super hard to get that balance just right and work together.'</p>

<p>Commenting on their age difference when they split last year, Megan told Grazia: 'It all ended very amicably.</p>

<p>'I really love Wes as a person, but we realised we are in very different stages of our lives and our priorities are different.</p>

<p>Last kiss? Megan has lifted the lid on the real reason behind the break up, claiming Wes was very focused on making money</p>

<p>'I'm 24 and by the time I'm 30 I want to be engaged. Wes is only 20. He's living his best life.'</p>

<p>Speaking on the podcast, Megan also discussed dating girls, being bisexual and why she didn't come out when she was on Love Island.</p>

<p>Megan revealed it was when she met Dr Alex George in the villa and had to tell him she was a stripper.  </p>

<p>She said: 'So from that point I thought, 'oh god, I'm going to be perceived as really sexual, I'm probably going to get slut-shamed on the outside world'.</p>

<p>Past love: Speaking on the Independent's Millennial Love podcast, Megan said: 'I don't have a bad word to say about him but that relationship broke down because of our priorities'</p>

<p>Former couple: Wes dated Megan for six months after they got together on Love Island in the summer of 2018</p>

<p>'So I didn't want to add to that and be like, 'oh I like girls too'.</p>

<p>'It took me so long to come out because I worked in the sex industry because I didn't want it to be for the male gaze, or for people to think, oh she's doing it for attention, or to seem more appealing to men.</p>

<p>'That is the furthest thing from the truth so that's why I kept it so quiet until I went on another show [Celebs Go Dating] and I didn't really want to do the show.</p>

<p>'I was struggling to meet gay girls. It's so hard when you're into feminine girls and you're feminine yourself, it's really hard to navigate who is gay and who's not. So it thought, this show is perfect, they can go and get me some cute girls.' </p>

<p>Revelations: Commenting on their breakup when they split last year, Megan told Grazia : 'I really love Wes as a person, but we realised we are in very different stages of our lives'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Wes revealed last week that he became a millionaire the age of just 21 following a series of reality TV appearances and canny investments with his earnings - and claimed he'll never have to work again. </p>

<p>The 2018 Love Island finalist, now 22, recently also signed a record deal with EMI Records - a moment he described on Instagram as 'my biggest dream'.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, Wes said: 'I was a millionaire by the age of 21. And that's not being a show off or anything, but it's wise investments and understanding this life doesn't last forever.' </p>

<p>'I have a passive income and generational wealth, so my children, whenever they come about, they're not going to have to work again. I don't have to work again.' </p>

<p>Wes added that he used to listen to property podcasts in-between making club appearances, meaning he now owns 'a lot' of mortgage-free properties. </p>

<p>Only last month, Wes revealed he'd signed his first solo record deal, following his failing to win The X Factor: Celebrity last year. </p>

<p>Wes shared a gallery of snaps from the moment he signed his contract and described himself as 'the happiest man on the planet.' </p>

<p>Jet set: Meanwhile, Wes revealed last week that he became a millionaire the age of just 21 following a series of reality TV appearances and canny investments</p>

<p>He added: 'I've got a great team around me, this is just the start! The debut single is on the way.'</p>

<p>The reality failed to set the music world alight as a part of pop group No Love Lost last year, which was eliminated during the third live show.</p>

<p>Wes, who worked as a nuclear engineer before joining Love Island,  impressed with his rapping skills during the performances, and also taught himself to play the piano.</p>

<p>He split from latest girlfriend Arabella Chi, 29, earlier this summer after nine months of dating. </p>

<p>How it all started: Wes first found fame as a  finalist on the 2018 series of Love Island, but has come a long way since then</p>
