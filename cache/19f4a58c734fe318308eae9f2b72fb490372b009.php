<p>T-Rex on the loose! And when Greg surprises his two children with a huge dinosaur in the garden, the youngsters are left hysterical as they start crying and screaming over the elaborate gift</p>

<p>Trying to explain, she says: 'It's just pretend, it's just pretend,' with Nelly screaming: 'No!'</p>

<p>Attempting to make a joke out of the situation, Greg quips: 'Be careful if you are living in Brentwood... there's a T-Rex on the loose!'</p>

<p>Speaking behind-the-scenes, Billie explains: 'I get that he thought this was going to be great but actually we avoided going to a kid's birthday party a few months ago because they had one of these T-Rex dinosaurs there. </p>

<p>'We knew Nelly and Arthur wouldn't like it! It completely backfired and all it did was prolong my shoot.' </p>

<p>Not impressed: And things go from bad to worse when the noise interrupts a fuming Billie as she comes downstairs to comfort her two children</p>

<p>It's pretend! Trying to explain, she says: 'It's just pretend, it's just pretend,' with Nelly screaming: 'No!'</p>

<p>Going back to the scene of the dinosaur, Billie is forced to take her hysterical children upstairs to get away from the huge costume.</p>

<p>While a sheepish Greg has to send away the dinosaur hire company and apologise for his upset children.</p>

<p>He says: 'They're having none of it, they won't even come downstairs at the moment. Thanks, I appreciate it.'</p>

<p>And when Greg goes upstairs, he is confronted by an annoyed Billie who says; 'Greg, you dealt with that all wrong.'</p>

<p>Fuming: Speaking behind-the-scenes, Billie explains: 'It completely backfired and all it did was prolong my shoot.'</p>

<p>Hysterical: Going back to the scene of the dinosaur, Billie is forced to take her hysterical children upstairs to get away from the huge costume</p>

<p>Oh dear: Yet Nelly and Arthur are still hysterical over the dinosaur with Billie remarking: 'No offence, but I've really got to get on. Great daddy daycare!'</p>

<p>The reality star then attempts to calm down his two children again as he says: 'Listen, you two, the man just left. It's not a real dinosaur in the garden, he was just dressed up.'</p>

<p>Yet Nelly and Arthur are still hysterical over the dinosaur with Billie remarking: 'No offence, but I've really got to get on. Great daddy daycare!'</p>

<p>Explaining his actions, Greg says: 'I didn't intend, if you had helped me' with Billie replying: 'I didn't know what was going on!'</p>

<p>Feeling deflated over his backfired surprise, Greg goes downstairs while his two children continue to cry over the dinosaur.</p>

<p>And as well as Billie, Greg gets told off by daughter Nelly as she jokes in a behind-the-scene clip: 'Naughty daddy!' </p>

<p>The Mummy Diaries continues at 9pm on ITVBe.  </p>
