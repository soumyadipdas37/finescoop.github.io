<p>The study also found that more than seven in 10 adults consider their furry, scaled and feathered friends to very much be a part of the family.</p>

<p>Among the best things about having a pet were the affection they give (55 per cent) and having their company (61 per cent).</p>

<p>And in a year in which many have been isolated or lonely, more than seven in 10 over-55s said that having a pet for company was their top perk of having an animal at home.</p>

<p>But despite 45 per cent of adults admitting they would like to have a pet, or have more than they do already, four in 10 don't currently have one.</p>

<p>A lack of space was the top reason for not getting a pet, with those in London most likely to consider this a barrier.</p>

<p>In Yorkshire 41 per cent of those who want a pet said they can't afford to give a furry friend a happy life.</p>

<p>It also emerged that for 27 per cent of those polled, their love of animals is so great that they dreamt of becoming a vet when they were a child.</p>

<p>Callum Woodhouse, who plays Tristan Farnon in Channel 5's new adaptation, said: 'I'm a huge dog lover. </p>

<p>'Any scene in All Creatures Great and Small where you see me with our Golden Retriever, that was me asking to have him in the scene with me as I adore him so much.</p>

<p>'There were five dogs I wanted to take home with me - Tricki-Woo included.</p>

<p>'One of my favourite scenes was a close up of my face being licked to pieces by one of our gorgeous dogs. Heaven. I'm with the public on this one.'</p>

<p>Nicholas Ralph, who plays James Herriot, said: 'Surrounding ourselves with our furry, scaled and feathered friends, great and small, can bring us all great companionship.</p>

<p>'On set, there was a little Dachshund called Frank whose nickname was Frankems, he was so endearing, I would have loved to take him home.</p>

<p>'And then Tricki Woo too, a little fluff ball whose real name was Derek - he was very charming, but I think Frankems did it for me.</p>

<p>'I'd love a little dog but for me right now, the biggest hurdle is having the time.'</p>

<p>All Creatures Great and Small continues on Channel 5 Tuesdays at 9pm. </p>
