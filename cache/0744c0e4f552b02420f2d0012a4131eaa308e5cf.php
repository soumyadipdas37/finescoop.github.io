<p>Lorena Delaguna, 53, was arrested on Monday on hate crime and harassment charges after she was filmed launching an unprovoked attack at Tiffany Johnson, 37, pictured left and right </p>

<p>The August 17 attack was caught on video. The suspect behind the attack pictured above sipping from a glass bottle at the corner of 53rd Place and Broadway in Woodside, Queens</p>

<p>Johnson was on a run at 53rd Place and Broadway in Woodside, Queens around noon on August 17 when she passed a corner and Delaguna threw a glass bottle at her feet.</p>

<p>She shouted: 'Get out of here n*****, go back to Africa,' according to video release by the NYPD on Wednesday. </p>

<p>'It's a hate crime. It's not acceptable. She has to be [held] responsible for her behavior,' Johnson had previously told the New York Post. </p>

<p>Johnson revealed she thought Delaguna had mistaken her for someone else, and didn't initially think the attack was racially motivated. </p>

<p>But once the woman started to scream hateful insults at her, she realized it was because she is black. </p>

<p>As Johnson approached the corner the suspect suddenly threw the bottle at her feet and yelled 'Go back to Africa, n****r', police say </p>

<p>The woman threw the glass bottle and it shattered on the ground near the jogger's foot </p>

<p>The suspect then repeatedly screamed 'Get out, Go back to Africa, n****r!'. Johnson looked back and said, 'What is your problem?' before continuing her run</p>

<p>'She could see the color of my skin and she reacted to that,' Johnson said.</p>

<p>'I was definitely shocked. I was surprised but more importantly I wanted to get away from her,' she added.</p>

<p>In the clip Johnson is seen turning back confused and saying 'What is your problem?' when the woman berates her and then continues her run.</p>

<p>'I'm entitled to go for a job, live my life, enjoy my life and enjoy the things that makes me happy,' she said.</p>

<p>Johnson said she took the route of being the bigger person and leaving rather than arguing with the woman.</p>

<p>Johnson previously revealed she was happy police were on the hunt for her attacker. She did not report the incident at the time until a friend saw the witness video on social media </p>

<p>'That's not on me. That's a reflection on her. She needs to look at herself and figure out why she looks down on somebody,' she said.</p>

<p>'We are always trying to give reasons for what people do but I can't get into her head. I only know what she did, what she said and her actions,' she added.</p>

<p>Johnson previously revealed she was happy police were on the hunt for her attacker. She did not report the incident at the time until a friend saw the witness video on social media. </p>

<p>She told ABC7 she has not gone back to that neighborhood since the incident, but has received an outpouring of support from groups like Black Girls Run. </p>
