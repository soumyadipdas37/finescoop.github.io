<p>Police allege Farrell was part of a group involved in the attack on Mr Solan.</p>

<p>He is also wanted over an assault on a man at Matraville in November last year. </p>

<p>The hunt for Farrell comes after he was jailed in Ireland in 2013 for three years over the violent death of 20-year-old Andrew Dolon before he made the move to Australia. </p>

<p>Neighbours found victim Oliver Solan, 30, barely conscious in a hallway at a Young Street apartment block in Randwick, in Sydney's east, about 8.40pm on August 29</p>

<p>Mr Solan was left with a severed ear and a punctured spleen which later had to be removed.  </p>

<p>Earle, Murtagh and Mr Solan had been drinking together at the couple's home on the night of the alleged stabbing.</p>

<p>An argument between the two men ensued, with Mr Solan allegedly the first to attack Earle causing injuries to his arm.</p>

<p>Mr Earle suffered a dislocated arm and cuts to his head before allegedly contacting his friend John Dunlea to ask for help.</p>

<p>At about 8.30pm, Mr Dunlea, along with two other Irishmen, Patrick Farrell and Christopher Morrison, arrived at the apartment complex where Murtagh let them in. </p>

<p>The unit block (pictured) was splattered with blood after the alleged attack</p>

<p> Mr Solan was then allegedly stabbed several times. </p>

<p>CCTV evidence shown to Mullingar Circuit Criminal Court during Farrell's case showed the victim put his hands out and begged 'please don’t hit me'. </p>
