<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wealthy Australians earning $200,000 a year are set to have their $11,640 tax cuts fast tracked.</p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's first budget in April 2019 unveiled three stages of income tax cuts - with the full package passing the Senate after the election.</p>

<p>The second stage, giving tax cuts of $2,565 for those earning more than $120,000 a year, was meant to roll out in July 2022 but Mr Frydenberg, the Liberal Party's deputy leader, has given multiple hints this will be brought forward to 2021 in Tuesday night's budget.</p>

<p>The tax relief for the rich doesn't end there with the third stage of tax cuts, originally due in July 2024, giving even more generous relief to those on six-figure salaries.</p>

<p>Wealthy Australians earning $200,000 a year are set to have their $11,640 tax cuts fast tracked. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's first budget in April 2019 unveiled three stages of income tax cuts - with the full package passing the Senate after the election</p>

<p>The government is expected to bring those tax cuts forward too as it accelerates a program to abolish the 37 per cent tax bracket and create a 30 per cent tax bracket for those earning $45,001 and $200,000.</p>

<p>Tax cuts of $255 for those earning between $18,200 and $37,000 were legislated in July 2019.</p>

<p>Those earning $48,000 to $90,000 saw their tax cuts double from $530 to $1,080.</p>

<p>The government's tax cuts package, announced in the April 2019 pre-election Budget, had three stages.</p>

<p>Stage one increased the threshold for the 32.5 per cent personal income tax bracket from $87,000 to $90,000, over four years until 2022.</p>

<p>Stage two, from July 1, 2022, would increase the 19 per cent personal income tax bracket from $41,000 to $45,000. It also raises the 32.5 per cent personal income tax bracket from $90,000 to $120,000.</p>

<p>Stage three would see the 37 per cent tax bracket abolished from July 1, 2024 and a new 30 per cent tax bracket created for all individuals earning between $45,001 and $200,000. The number of tax brackets would be slashed from five to four for the first time since 1984  </p>

<p>The slashing of tax brackets, from five to four for the first time since 1984, will see those at the top end on $200,000 receive a tax cut of $11,640 compared with the 2017-18 financial year.</p>

<p>This could occur despite predictions Australia's gross government debt could reach $1trillion within the next two years as a result of the coronavirus-induced recession.</p>

<p>Westpac is expecting Mr Frydenberg to unveil a budget deficit of $240billion for 2020-21 - comprising 12.5 per cent of gross domestic product. </p>

<p>The bank's key economists Bill Evans and Andrew Hanlan said record-low interest rates meant the government could afford to bring forward both the stage two and stage three tax cuts.</p>

<p>'Our forecasts highlight that such policies can be easily accommodated and the cost of servicing the total debt, even under this more aggressive profile, will be contained as a proportion of GDP due to the collapse in interest rates,' they said.</p>

<p>Economist Saul Eslake said income tax cuts tended to favour the rich because the top three per cent of Australians, earning more than $180,000 a year, paid a greater volume of overall income taxes.</p>

<p>'Our top rate cuts in at a fairly modest income by international standards,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'We have a very steeply progressive income tax scale and what that means is that 30 per cent of the personal income tax is paid by the three per cent of people who pay the top rate.</p>

<p>'More generally, it's actually hard to cut Australian personal income tax without most of the benefits going to middle and upper-income earners.' </p>

<p>Those earning more than Australia's average full-time salary of $89,123 stand to get the most back should the stage three tax cuts be brought forward. </p>

<p>The third stage of the federal government's tax cuts was designed to give generous relief to those on six-figure salaries from July 2024. This could be accelerated in Tuesday's budget</p>

<p>Australians earning between $90,000 and $100,000 are getting back $2,340.</p>

<p>That grows to $3,040 for those between $100,000 and $120,000.</p>

<p>The generosity only gets better with those on salaries between $120,000 and $140,000 to receive $4,440.</p>

<p>There's more, with highly-paid professionals or tradies earning $140,000 to $160,000 getting back $5,840.</p>

<p>The well-off who are paid between $160,000 to $180,000 get $7,240, which expands to $8,640 for the fortunate hard workers on more than $180,000 but less than $200,000.</p>

<p>Little more than 400,000 Australians earn more than $180,000, Australian Taxation Office data shows. </p>

<p>Mr Eslake predicted wealthy Australians would be less likely to spend their income tax cuts, and would instead pay down their debt. </p>

<p>The second stage, giving tax cuts of $2,565 for those earning more than $120,000 a year, was meant to roll out in July 2022 but Mr Frydenberg, the Liberal Party's deputy leader, has given multiple hints this will be brought forward to 2021 in Tuesday night's budget</p>

<p>'A significant proportion of any income tax cuts that are brought forward, irrespective of to when, will probably be saved or used to pay down debt,' he said.</p>

<p>Tax cuts in 2019, geared towards low and middle-income earners, also did little to stimulate spending and Mr Eslake expected the same effect from the stage two and stage three tax cuts.</p>

<p>'The problem is you can't guarantee that they're going to take it out of their pockets and spend it,' he said. </p>

<p>Deloitte Access Economics and Westpac calculate that bringing forward the stage two tax cuts would cost $12.35billion in 2020/21.</p>

<p>The stage three tax cuts would cost $14.8billion in 2022-23 if they weren't accelerated to an earlier financial year. </p>
