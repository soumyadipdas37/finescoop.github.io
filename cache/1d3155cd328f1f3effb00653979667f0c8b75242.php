<p>Blast from the past: Hailey Bieber, 23, and her husband Justin, 26, both shared cute photos of themselves recreating funny childhood poses Tuesday on Instagram</p>

<p>Justin started the nostalgia trip when he shared a cute photo of himself and Hailey aboard a private jet.</p>

<p>The two were enjoying sushi boxes from the Katsuya offshoot Krispy Rice and may have been returning to Los Angeles from their recent trip to Idaho. </p>

<p>The Sorry singer sported a shaggy quarantine hairdo and a dark t-shirt, while Hailey wore a black jacket over a matching tank top. </p>

<p>The model scrunched up her face and stuck her tongue out playfully while Justin played it straight.</p>

<p>Later, Hailey shared a cute side-by-side comparison of herself sticking her tongue out when she was just a tiny tot, next to her present-day self. </p>

<p>Time flies: Justin shared a photo of the two aboard a private jet, and Hailey juxtaposed her extended tongue with a cute photo of herself making the same face when she was a child</p>

<p>Justin joined in on the fun with a short video that was also shared in Hailey's Insta Stories.</p>

<p>She started by zooming in on his phone, on which he had a funny picture of himself with a strained smile and bulging eyes as he stood next to a friend.</p>

<p>Hailey pulled back the camera and panned over to Justin's face to reveal his updated attempt at the crooked smile.</p>

<p>'OMG,' she captioned the hilarious expression. </p>

<p>On his own Instagram page, Justin shared some more meditative photos of himself.</p>

<p>He gazed off into nature while standing against in Idaho after the sun had just gone down past the horizon.</p>

<p>The Love Yourself singer looked as if he was deep in though or praying in a follow-up picture taken in his driveway.</p>

<p>He stood against his tan car with his hands clasped as he looked downward with a somber face.</p>

<p>The singer–songwriter wore an olive toque and a fuzzy white shirt over a white tank top and khakis with yellow, white and red trainers.</p>

<p>He let both photos speak for themselves and didn't bother to caption them. </p>

<p>Justin gave his 147 million fans a closer look at his new rose neck tattoo with its barbed stem in a closeup selfie featuring the same outfit that he posted to his Insta Stories.</p>
