<p>Farewell then, to Jenni Murray, host of Woman’s Hour on Radio 4 for the past 33 years. Farewell, too, to her co-presenter Jane Garvey.</p>

<p>What a passing of an era.</p>

<p>Christa D'Souza (pictured) argues there needs to be representation of those over age 60, as Jenni Murray leaves Radio 4's Woman's Hour</p>

<p>I shall miss Jenni’s dulcet tones terribly, as will many others, I’m sure — that’s a rare skill she has there, to mollify and probe at the same time.</p>

<p>Her reason for leaving? A dignified ‘it was time to move on’, which is all well and good but I do hope it didn’t have anything to do with her turning 70 this year (Jane Garvey is 56). I have my suspicions.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant decision of Radio 4’s to hire Emma Barnett, the 5 Live and Newsnight presenter who is set to take Jenni’s place. Emma is a brave, fearsome and — most importantly — likeable journalist. She is also 35.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see who the co-presenter will be. Will she, like Emma, be in her 30s? I understand that Woman’s Hour needs to ‘revitalise’ and not veer too far into ‘knitting pattern-and- incontinence pad’ territory. But it needs to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

<p>We 60-plussers need representation too.</p>
