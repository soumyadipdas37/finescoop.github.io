<p>Mackenzie Guild, 15, and her sibling Charlie, 11, were sitting in the tray of a ute that was towing a bogged car at their family's cattle property Niall Station, 170km north of Charters Towers in northern Queensland.</p>

<p>They were helping with the vehicle at about 10pm Friday when the snatch rope between the two cars snapped and hit Mackenzie in the chest.</p>

<p>Mackenzie died at the scene and Charlie was airlifted to Townsville University Hospital where she is in a stable condition, The Townsville Bulletin reports.</p>

<p>The accident has devastated the close-knit town of Charters Towers and the girls' school at Columba Catholic College.</p>

<p>Principal Candi Dempster said the loss was 'heartbreaking' and sent 'shockwaves' through the school community.</p>

<p>'Mackenzie had a sense of hope, positivity and a "have a go nature" at every opportunity presented to her,' Ms Dempster said.</p>

<p>Both Mackenzie and her family were heavily involved in the school community, with her twin sister Courtney and older sister Georgia also boarding students at the college.</p>

<p>Charlie was also due to join them when she begins year seven in 2021.</p>

<p>Ms Dempster has been in contact with Mackenzie's parents, Alisha and James Guild, to pay her respects.</p>

<p>'Alisha is just a very capable, bubbly woman who is being very stoic for her family in knowing that Mackenzie touched the lives of so many,' Ms Dempster said.</p>

<p>Ms Dempster said the parents are showing 'incredible strength' during this traumatic time and said Mackenzie shared the same 'indomitable spirit' as her mother.</p>

<p>'She was so comfortable in her own skin. She's one of those characters that actually lights up the room,' the principal said.</p>

<p>Ms Dempster said while the accident has been heartbreaking, the school was grateful for knowing Mackenzie.</p>

<p>Grief support is being offered for school staff, student and parents through the college's pastoral care team and parish priest.</p>

<p>Columba Catholic College plans to honour Mackenzie in a service involving her sisters, friends and parents when school resumes for term four.  </p>
