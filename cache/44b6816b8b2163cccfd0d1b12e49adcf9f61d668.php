<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Courtney Roznowski (pictured) was jailed after having sex with a 16-year-old high school student in Green Bay, Wisconsin </p>

<p>A disgraced school worker who had sex with a 16-year-old high school student was branded the 'nightmare of every parent' by a judge as he jailed her for six months. </p>

<p>Courtney Roznowski admitted a charge of exposing herself to a minor under a plea deal which saw more serious sexual assault counts dropped. </p>

<p>The 32-year-old was handed the six-month sentence at a hearing last Friday where she told the Green Bay court that 'I know what I did was wrong', according to Fox11. </p>

<p>But judge Donald Zuidmulder said he was 'unimpressed' by her pleas for understanding, calling her actions 'appalling'. </p>

<p>'You are, frankly, the nightmare of every parent. Because what a parent assumes is that their child is in safe environment with trusting people,' the judge said. </p>

<p>He also told Roznowski to turn around and look at her parents in the public gallery of the Green Bay courtroom. </p>

<p>'Here’s what I want to tell you, Miss Roznowski: You’ve broken their hearts,' the judge said. </p>

<p>'And whatever punishment I impose on you, I assume that the humiliation and embarrassment you’ve caused your mother and father is more punishment that you will carry than what I could impose on you.'</p>

<p>The support worker was also placed on probation for three years and ordered to write a letter of apology to Southwest High School staff.  </p>

<p>According to a police report obtained by WBAY, Roznowski admitted having sex with the boy, who said she told him he was 'special and deserved special things'. </p>

<p>Roznowski was jailed for six months, placed on probation for three years and ordered to write a letter of apology to staff at Southwest High School (pictured) in Green Bay, Wisconsin </p>

<p>Roznowski told investigators she had seen herself as a mentor to the boy before their relationship became sexual.  </p>

<p>According to the police report, the 16-year-old victim told investigators that 'it is every kid's dream to do a teacher'. </p>

<p>Roznowski said she accepted responsibility and admitted her actions were wrong, but said she had not 'initiated' the relationship. </p>

<p>She said she had not initially realized that she was exchanging messages with a student at her school, but admitted she should have stopped when she found out.</p>

<p>The school worker also blamed her behavior on a drinking problem which she told the court she had since overcome. </p>

<p>Roznowski was arrested last year on the more serious charges of sexual assault of a child by a staff member. </p>

<p>Brown County jail records show she was booked in last August and released on a $10,000 bond.  </p>

<p>She later confessed to investigators when they asked for permission to go through her phone. </p>

<p>A judge accepted a plea deal earlier this month after state authorities said her contract at the school had ended before the sexual contact took place.  </p>
