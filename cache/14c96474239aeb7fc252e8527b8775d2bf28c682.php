<p>Kat Kingsley, from Hayle, Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor last Thursday. </p>

<p>But just three days later the 25-year-old claims she received text messages from a male worker that said she had been 'living in his head' and admitted 'knowing all the risk involved in using data that's not supposed to be for me'.</p>

<p>Kat Kingsley, 25, (pictured) from Hayle, Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor last Thursday</p>

<p>Ms Kingsley said that as she got on the bus she had given her name and number to a staff member who wrote them on a piece of paper as part of the NHS Test and Trace programme.</p>

<p>She claims that a few days after the trip she received a message that read: 'Basically, the other day after you left I felt silly, keep looking around to see if I could spot you again. </p>

<p>'Yesterday they sent me again to Windsor and I felt even more silly realising I was still hoping to see you.</p>

<p>'Along with the idea of this stupid message you've been living my head (not really good conditions but the rent is cheap and there is plenty of room ) for 3 days now... </p>

<p>Three days later Ms Kingsley claims she received text messages from the man that said she had been 'living in his head' and he admitted 'knowing all the risk involved in using data that's not supposed to be for me'</p>

<p>Ms Kingsley (pictured) said she was 'shocked' when she received the messages which she branded as 'so creepy' and left her 'weirded out'</p>

<p>'Joking joking joking! So today I decided to stop being silly and go full stupid and write you, knowing all the risk involved in using data that's not supposed to be for me. </p>

<p>'Don't get me wrong, mainly I'm just zealous and professional to test, in advance, a totally random phone number to see if it is correct in case he NHS will need it in the future.' </p>

<p>Ms Kingsley said she was 'shocked' when she received the messages which she branded as 'so creepy' and left her 'weirded out'. </p>

<p>She has since urged said people to be cautious as she said the system was 'not very safe'.</p>

<p>Original Tour told the BBC that if the incident was 'proven from our investigation, this is totally unacceptable' and it would take appropriate action.</p>

<p>'It goes against the values of our organisation entirely,' the spokesman said.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Original Tour for comment. </p>

<p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: 'The unauthorised use of customers' information provided for contact tracing is unacceptable and every business must comply with all date protection legislation.'</p>
