<p>This week they bring you the lowdown and verdict on Wigan Athletic left back Tom Pearce.  </p>

<p>Age: 22</p>

<p>Club: Wigan Athletic</p>

<p>Position: Left back</p>

<p>Value: £250,000 </p>

<p>Opportunities come in all forms and for all reasons.</p>

<p>Not long ago, this player was doing well at Leeds but he was displaced by Barry Douglas under coach Marcelo Bielsa.</p>

<p>Now part of a decimated Wigan Athletic set-up, it’s not too late for him to make his mark. This left-footed left back has seen many colleagues depart this summer as the club has suffered terrible financial hardship.</p>

<p>Here, I saw a player who looks fit after a spell of injury, taking responsibility in the Wigan defence.</p>

<p>When going forward, he showed purpose and in 20 first-half minutes he surged upfield on three separate occasions, providing two excellent crosses as he combined effectively with his experienced wide man.</p>

<p>On the third occasion his determination forced a corner as he was hit by a last-gasp tackle at the byline.</p>

<p>In a first half where his team were poor defensively on the other side of the field, he did well to get into decent covering positions to cope with unopposed crosses. </p>

<p>Tom Pearce looks fit after a spell of injury, and is taking responsibility in the Wigan defence</p>

<p>When having to defend, he was adequate in one-v-one situations, but once he got too square on to his opponent and was beaten by a push and run.</p>

<p>He must watch out for this. On the whole, however, he was not exposed. This will be a difficult season for Pearce and his club. For the moment he will have his experienced manager John Sheridan — once a classy passer of the ball — to guide him. Pearce passes it simply. He has a strong left foot and a nice build for a full back — not too tall or sluggish on the turn and not too small to cope with aerial threats.</p>

<p>He has been in the shadows but was well scouted and represented England at Under 20 and Under 21 level. He was considered a big talent. There are many reasons a player’s career can stall and injuries certainly don’t help. At 22, Pearce will have a crucial role this season in a patched-up team. He should seize the opportunity.  </p>
