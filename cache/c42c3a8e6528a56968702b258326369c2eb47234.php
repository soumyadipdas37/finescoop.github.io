<p>Parents-to-be Matt and Ashleigh Conwell, from Brisbane, had been tightly budgeting to care for their three unborn babies after they both lost their jobs due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>But the 29-year-old's dreams of a happy family were dashed when her 'beloved soulmate' was hit and killed by a 4WD on Wednesday, The Courier-Mail reported.</p>

<p>Pictured: Matt, 32, and Ashleigh Conwell, 29, on their wedding day in 2017. They met in 2008 on MySpace</p>

<p>Matt Conwell (pictured) died 'under sudden and tragic circumstances' on Wednesday</p>

<p>The expectant mother was one of the first on the scene, where she broke down. </p>

<p>According to a Go Fund Me page set up by a family friend, the devastating loss has 'torn apart' Mrs Conwell.</p>

<p>'Losing Matt has placed an almost overwhelming burden on Ashleigh,' the fundraiser read. </p>

<p>'They were already stretching every dollar and budgeting tightly for the arrival of their unexpected but so very wanted family ... the financial hardship she now finds herself in is significant.'</p>

<p>The friend added that costs of pregnancy, delivery and caring for triplets that would be 'challenging for any couple' are especially difficult for a single mum.</p>

<p>The page has been inundated with friends and family offering financial and emotional support to the mother-to-be.</p>

<p>'Sending you a million hugs from the other side of the world. Stay strong and know that we are here thinking of you always,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'As a new mother of twins and a wife of a police officer, this is my greatest fear. I hope you find the love and support you and the babies will need. My heart breaks for you, and I pray you deliver three healthy babies,' another shared. </p>

<p>The 32-year-old cricket coach had been looking forward to meeting his triplets, due at the end of 2020.</p>

<p>Junior cricket teams paused for a minute's silence before their matches on the weekend to remember Mr Conwell, The Courier-Mail reported.</p>

<p>He was described as 'a true gentlemen' and a 'great advocate for cricket, in particular women's cricket' by members of the Darling Downs and South West Queensland cricket club.</p>

<p>The couple (pictured) met in 2008 when Mr Conwell saw his future wife pictured on the cover of a local newspaper after she attended a fundraising event for leukaemia</p>

<p>Upon seeing her face and reading her name, the then 20-year-old contacted her on MySpace.</p>

<p>After weeks of messaging each other, 17-year-old Ashleigh agreed to meet at Cleveland Harbour in Brisbane's west.</p>

<p>'I was definitely hesitant, but I finally agreed to meet with him,' she told the publication.</p>

<p>'I wasn't really concerned. I could tell he had a good heart.'</p>
