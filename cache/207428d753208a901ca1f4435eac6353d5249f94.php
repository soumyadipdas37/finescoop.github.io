<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bureaucrats in NSW have been encouraged to adopt politically correct language and avoid using phrases such as 'husband and wife' and 'ladies and gentlemen'.</p>

<p>NSW treasury workers, who are amidst the state's worst economic crisis in almost a century, have also been urged to include their preferred pronouns in their email signatures. </p>

<p>But the focus on inclusive language has been slammed by One Nation MP Mark Latham, who believes there are greater issues to battle through during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Staff received an official message from NSW Treasury's Economic Strategy Deputy Secretary Joann Wilkie following a training day in line with 'Wear It Purple', The Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>Staff received an official message from NSW Treasury's Economic Strategy Deputy Secretary Joann Wilkie (pictured) following a training day in line with 'Wear It Purple'. The note detailed 'some of the things we can all do to help create a safe space'</p>

<p>The note detailed 'some of the things we can all do to help create a safe space' in the workplace.  </p>

<p>'Things like adding a pronoun preference to your signature block,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'And not assuming when you're talking to a colleague that they are heterosexual/cisgendered/endosex, so use 'partner' rather than 'wife' or 'husband' and use an introduction like 'welcome folks' rather than 'hi guys' (I need to work on this one) or 'good morning ladies and gentlemen'.' </p>

<p>Mr Latham said treasury staff's priority should be on non-stop job creation as Australia struggles through a recession. </p>

<p>He said the notion of needing a safe space is 'ridiculous' and claimed Ms Wilkie would be on $250,000 a year while working in one of the 'safest' offices in the country.</p>

<p>'She should do her day job of 'economic strategy and productivity' instead of insulting the thousands of business owners who have closed down and the hundreds of thousands of workers who have lost their jobs with her work priority of safe spaces and PC-word training,' Mr Latham said.</p>

<p>IPA western civilisation program director Bella d'Abrera agreed with the One Nation MP's comments. </p>

<p>Ms d'Abrera said treasury staff should focus on getting Australians back to work rather than whether they say 'wife' or 'husband'.  </p>

<p>National accounts data released last week confirmed national GDP collapsed by seven per cent in the June quarter and around 6.3 per cent in the 12 months to June.</p>

<p>The 8.6 per cent decline in NSW for the June quarter was the worst of all states and territories and the worst in the state's history.</p>

<p>Treasurer Dominic Perrottet told the publication all large organisations have plans for inclusion as staff should be treated with respect and feel safe in the workplace. </p>

<p>Treasury has been instructed to focus on preparing the budget, creating jobs and supporting business, he added.    </p>
