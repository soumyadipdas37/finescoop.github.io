<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A New Zealand shearer has discovered a huge fluffy sheep - dubbed Shrek 2 - living next to his station.   </p>

<p>Rob Faulkner, who works at Wairakaia Station on the North Island, said the wild sheep had avoided shearing for about five years by living in a nearby forestry block. </p>

<p>'Every attempt we made in the past to muster the animal failed. Over time sheep like it become a bit feral and get very cunning,' Mr Faulkner told The Gisborne Herald. </p>

<p>A New Zealand farmer discovered a massive sheep named Shrek 2 (pictured) that had been living in a forest block next to his station and avoided being shorn for five years  </p>

<p>Shrek 2 was named after another New Zealand ram named Shrek (pictured) who was discovered with a record breaking 27kg fleece in 2004 and gained international fame </p>

<p>Shrek 2 was named after a Merino that gained international fame in 2004 after he was found on New Zealand's South Island with a fleece around 27kgs. </p>

<p>Mr Faulkner said he was in awe when he first discovered the enormous sheep.  </p>

<p>'A few weeks ago it got into the back paddock and I realised just what a magnificent sheep it was,' he explained. </p>

<p>The shearer said he was unsure of the sheep's weight or gender but would find out at the Poverty Bay A&amp;P Spring Show. </p>

<p>'We are working on a 'guess the weight of the fleece' competition, and at some time on the Friday afternoon of the show, Shrek 2 will be shorn,' he said. </p>

<p>The original Shrek was discovered in Tarras, a tiny farming community, and evaded the annual shearing round-ups for seven years.  </p>

<p>Shrek's owner John Perriam described him as 'an elderly statesman'. </p>

<p>Shrek was toured around the country for charity events in the back of a van by musterer Danny Devine (left) and owner John Perriam (right) </p>

<p>Mr Perriam said Shrek was able to survive the winters and avoid detection by moving about a series of sheltered caves and by munching on small native shrubs.</p>

<p>'It's bizarre that we missed him seven years in a row,' he said.</p>

<p>'But from his point of view, it was the perfect environment.'</p>

<p>Shrek was one of about 17,000 sheep on the the 27,000-acre farm.</p>

<p>After Shrek became a star, Mr Perriam gave him his own barn and showroom.</p>

<p>Shrek even had a personal carer to look after him when he became sick, before being put to sleep at the age of 17 in 2011. </p>

<p>A ram dubbed Shrek II was also discovered in regional New South Wales in 2018. </p>

<p>He was located near the Warrumbungle National Park, 550 kilometres northwest of Sydney, with a massive fleece weighing in at 30kg. </p>

<p>A ram also dubbed Shrek II (pictured) was found by New South Wales farmers in 2018 with more than 30kgs of wool</p>
