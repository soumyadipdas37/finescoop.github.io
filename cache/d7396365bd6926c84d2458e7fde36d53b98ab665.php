<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eoin Morgan conceded England were beaten by the better team on Wednesday after their five-year long unbeaten home one-day international series record was ended in dramatic style by Australia.</p>

<p>Australia, all but beaten at 73 for five chasing 303 in this final match of the men’s international season, hit back to win by two wickets with two balls to spare after a record breaking partnership of 212 for the sixth wicket by Glenn Maxwell and Alex Carey.</p>

<p>And the England captain had no complaints as their attempt to go unbeaten in all formats this summer with Test victories against West Indies and Pakistan, a 50-over victory over Ireland, a Twenty20 success over Australia and a drawn short-form series against Pakistan ended at the very last of England’s 18 international bio-secure matches.</p>

<p>Eoin Morgan conceded Australia were better than England as the Aussies won the ODI series</p>

<p>A record partnership of 212 by Glenn Maxwell and Alex Carey gave Australia the series win</p>

<p>‘Australia were too good for us today,’ said Morgan after an epic finale to the men’s international season. 'Having started so badly we were still in the game making 300 but Carey and Maxwell played exceptionally well.</p>

<p>‘We had small opportunities that might have changed the game but when you are beaten by the better side you just have to put your hand up.’</p>

<p>Morgan started the series wanting to play on slow, low pitches to try to improve England’s game in conditions that do not suit them and felt they could take much from a 2-1 series defeat as they plan for two sub-continental World Cups in the next three years.</p>

<p>England looked set to win the series and had Australia sweating at 73-5 chasing 303</p>

<p>‘The positive of the series is that we can win when we are not at our best,’ said Morgan. ‘We’ve also learnt a lot about the group playing on slower wickets. And we’ve learnt playing against Australia you’re never home and dry. It hasn’t gone our way today and Australia have outplayed us but we’ve addressed our weaknesses.’</p>

<p>And Morgan feels England have shown the way forward for the world game with the success of the painstakingly organised bio-secure bubbles here and in Southampton.</p>

<p>‘We have pioneered how to get cricket back on and the fact we’ve had no positive cases in the bubble will be something every team in the world will look at,’ added Morgan.  ‘The ECB have done an outstanding job. The challenge for the players is spending an extended period of time away from your family.</p>

<p>‘Being away from them is part of being an international cricketer but when you’re doing it while you’re playing at home it makes it harder. We might need to look at that travelling to other countries.’</p>
