<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A video captures the 'incredible' moment that an angry motorist ploughs through a series of bollards marking out a cycle lane on Brighton's sea front.</p>

<p>The unnamed driver is heard ranting about 's****y bike lanes' before he gives the slim bollards - known as wands - on the lane's edge 'a proper little battering'.</p>

<p>However, his actions see his own wing mirror wrecked in the process as he drives at force into the wands - and films himself crashing into them while on his mobile phone.  </p>

<p>The expletive-filled clip was shared on Facebook by Julie Dawes, and spotted by broadcaster Jeremy Vine, who then posted the clip to his 760,000 Twitter followers. </p>

<p>The clip ends with the man laughing: 'Oops, I've knocked my wing mirror off, knocked that right off'.  </p>
