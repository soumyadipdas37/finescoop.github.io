<p>Brendan Beavon, a lawyer who was passing by on his way to work, told Daily Mail Australia there were protesters sitting on the road.</p>

<p>'They were sitting on the roadway and shouting "murderers, murderers" and "blood on your hands",' he said.  </p>

<p>Protesters also shouted: 'How do you spell racist? QPS!'</p>

<p>Officers could be seen pushing protesters away from a police car attempting to make its way down the road.</p>

<p>A female protester said how she marched the same streets in 1994 for the same issues - but back then is descended into violence.</p>

<p>She said she hoped people would remain peaceful during today's statement, with the gathering crowd kneeling down in response. </p>

<p>Brisbane City Greens Councilor Jonathan Sri was among the protesters, as well as prominent climate activists Emma Dorge and Alice Wicks.  </p>

<p>A 49-year-old woman was found dead in her watchhouse cell on Thursday.</p>

<p>She had been arrested on drug and property matters on September 6, and she was remanded in prison until October 7.</p>

<p>The group also shouted phrases such as 'f**k the police' and 'Black Lives Matter' as they crowded the streets (pictured)</p>

<p>She was in the watchhouse waiting to be transferred to a correctional facility. </p>

<p>'While the circumstances of the death are to be determined, the investigation will include consideration of any underlying health conditions,' Queensland Police Service said in a statement. </p>

<p>The investigation into the woman's death continues. </p>

<p>Mr Sri said the protest had started peacefully, and blamed the police for inflaming tensions.  </p>

<p>'An Aboriginal woman died in police custody and police haven’t explained why or how,' he told news.com.au.</p>

<p>'They haven’t released footage from the cell.</p>

<p>'Residents were protesting peacefully, spaced out safely, and without warning or negotiation police randomly arrested people, turning a safe situation into a tense one.'</p>
