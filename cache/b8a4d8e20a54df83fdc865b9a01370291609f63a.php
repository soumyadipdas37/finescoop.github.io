<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Channel 10 is currently searching for Australia's next Bachelor.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, franchise host Osher Günsberg shared a promotional image featuring former Bachelors and encouraged people to apply.</p>

<p>While most of the suitors from 2013 to 2020 were featured in the photo, two were notably missing.</p>

<p>Oops! A Channel 10 promotional image encouraging people to apply for the next season of The Bachelor was missing two former stars of the franchise</p>

<p>Season four's Richie Strahan was noticeably absent, as was season two's Blake Garvey.</p>

<p>Tim Robards, Matty Johnson, Sam Wood, and this season's leading man Locky Gilbert were all featured.</p>

<p>It's unclear why Richie and Blake were left out, but it could be because their relationships from the show didn't last.</p>

<p>Remember me? Season two star Blake Garvey was noticeably left out of the photo. Pictured with Sam Frost, the winner he dumped shortly after their season finale in 2014</p>

<p>Richie split from his winner Alex Nation in 2017, while Blake Garvey broke up with Sam Frost shortly after their season finale in 2014.</p>

<p>Blake later found love with second runner-up Louise Pillidge, but the pair called it quits 18 months later.</p>

<p>'Are you looking for love? Think you're Australia's next Bachelor?' Osher wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>Flashback: Season four's Richie Strahan (pictured) was also left out of the photo</p>
