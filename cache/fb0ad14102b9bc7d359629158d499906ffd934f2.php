<p>Zara - who found fame on Love Island two years ago - and Sam called quits on their romance last month, just weeks after enjoying a loved-up holiday in Mykonos.</p>

<p>'Sam has gone away to have a break from it all and clear his head away from Zara and social media.'</p>

<p>Protective? On MIC, Zara was seen declaring that she wants to marry and have children with Sam. She also moved in with him at the start of lockdown</p>

<p>Louise tweeted last Wednesday, 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful,' which prompted fans to assume she had trouble in her own relationship with fiancé Ryan Libbey.</p>

<p>Days later she sparked further speculation by posting: 'Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair' followed by 'I'm proud of my heart. It's been played, stabbed, cheated, burned and broken… somehow still works.' </p>

<p>An insider told MailOnline: 'Things between Louise and Ryan are really great. Her tweet last week was actually aimed at a friend.'</p>

<p>The couple went public with their romance in May 2019, four months after Zara's split from Love Island co-star Adam Collard.</p>

<p>Speaking in July, Zara said: 'I have learnt more about Sam in the last couple of months than I have the whole of last year. Sam is quite a weird person.</p>

<p>'He needs his space but also likes attention and it's been hard to know when to give him his boy time and when to be a really attentive girlfriend.</p>

<p>'It hasn't been plain sailing for us like we have argued over the most stupid things. I would think "Why am I arguing with Sam over who's unloading the dishwasher today?"</p>

<p>'Sometimes I will do the wrong thing and he'll do the wrong thing but it's part of being in a relationship.' </p>

<p>Trouble in paradise: The couple went public with their romance in May 2019, four months after Zara's split from Love Island co-star Adam Collard</p>

<p>She said: 'I would not be with someone who I couldn't see myself being with forever. I know him well enough to know the way we work and being able to smile and laugh everyday is not something I've never had before. </p>

<p>'Sam teaches me not to take myself so seriously. He brings out all the good in me and that's all I want in a person.</p>

<p>'His sister Louise is like a sister to me now, we are super close and lockdown has bought us together so much.</p>

<p>'I don't know how we're going to have time apart now. I do love him so much – he's the sweetest thing.'  </p>
