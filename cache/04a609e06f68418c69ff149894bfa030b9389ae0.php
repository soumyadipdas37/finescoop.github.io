<p>Sizzling: Nicole Poturalski, 27, put on a sizzling display on Wednesday, when she took to her Instagram account to share an eye-catching snap of herself</p>

<p>With her glossy brown locks falling before her face in soft waves, the stunning beauty highlighted her good looks with a light and natural palette of makeup.</p>

<p>Captioning the captivating image, which showed her posing before a light grey wall, mother-of-one Nicole wrote: 'Its all about your Mindset.' [sic]</p>

<p>Her snap comes after it was revealed by MailOnline that Nicole met Hollywood superstar Pitt, 56, at her husband's high-class Berlin restaurant.</p>

<p>Romance: Her post came after it was revealed that she's dating Brad Pitt. Pictured in February</p>

<p>Pitt is said to have been mesmerised by the striking brunette with the seductive pout when he locked eyes on her for the first time in August 2019. </p>

<p>Double Oscar winner Pitt became acquainted with Borchardt and its flamboyant owner Roland Mary, 68, in 2009 when he was filming on location in Germany for the Quentin Tarantino movie, Inglorious Basterds.</p>

<p>He returned to the €150-a-head city centre restaurant in August last year while promoting his latest Tarantino movie, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, with the legendary director and co-stars Leonardo Di Caprio and Margot Robbie.</p>

<p>And it was in that night in August last year that he met Nicole - who bears a startling resemblance to his ex-wife Angelina Jolie - for the first time and fell in love.</p>

<p>Snaps: The day before her post, Nicole shared another of herself posing in a bright baggy top</p>

<p>The model was in Los Angeles a few weeks later for a photo shoot and met up with Brad. They were later pictured together at a Kanye West concert in November 2009.</p>

<p>A year on, Brad Pitt and Nicole Poturalski are a couple in love and recently spent time at his luxury £50 million Chateau Miraval in the south of France.</p>

<p>'Brad Pitt first met Nicole [Poturalski] in August last year at Borchardt which is her husband Roland's restaurant,' a friend of Nicole told MailOnline.</p>

<p>'Brad Pitt has been coming to Borchardt for years. He knows Roland [Mary] and Nicole was at the restaurant when he came to celebrate his new film.</p>

<p>What a stunner: Nicole is a successful fashion model from Germany, who has graced the cover of ELLE and is signed to Next Management in Los Angeles and A Management in Germany</p>

<p>'Brad was introduced to Roland's wife Nicole [Poturalski] and she passed him her number.</p>

<p>'Nicole travels a lot for her work as a fashion model and he connected with Brad Pitt while she was in LA for work.'</p>

<p>Nicole remains married and has a seven-year-old son called Emil with Roland.</p>

<p>The youngster recently started school in Berlin but was pictured earlier this month in Beverley Hills with mum Nicole.</p>

<p>Roland Mary declined to discuss his wife's love affair with Brad when contacted by MailOnline. He said simply: 'No comment.'</p>

<p>Long-time acquaintance: Double Oscar winner Pitt became acquainted with Nicole's husband  Roland Mary, 68, in 2009 (above) when he shot Inglorious Basterds in Germany</p>

<p>However Roland is said to be 'philosophical' about his wife's 'close friendship' with the Hollywood heart-throb Pitt.</p>

<p>The friend told MailOnline: 'Roland is a very philosophical guy. He has been married several times and has five children. He is not interested in negativity or jealousy.</p>

<p>'They are still married but you could describe their relationship as an "open marriage".' </p>

<p>A spokesman for Brad Pitt declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.</p>

<p>New romance: A year on, Brad and Nicole are a couple in love (pictured at Kanye West's performance in the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles in November 2019)</p>

<p>It is no surprise that Brad would have chosen to celebrate Germany's opening night of his latest film Once Upon A Time In Hollywood at Roland's Borchardt restaurant.</p>

<p>The iconic eatery has become a landmark in Berlin's show business scene.</p>

<p>The café and restaurant, which dates back to 1853 is popular with statesmen and celebrities who visit the German capital.</p>

<p>US President Barack Obama and German leader Angela Merkel have dined there. Other notable diners include George Clooney, Madonna, Natalie Portman and Harvey Weinstein.</p>

<p>This comes as Brad and Nicole were pictured enjoying a cosy date night nine months ago, as their relationship was confirmed last Thursday. </p>

<p> Meeting: A source said, 'Brad was introduced to Roland's wife Nicole [Poturalski] and she passed him her number' (pictured arriving at Nicole's husband's upscale restaurant)</p>

<p>The pair were seen cosying up together in the VIP box during Kanye West's performance at LA's Hollywood Bowl in November 2019, with onlookers saying they pair were deep in conversation as they waited for the performance to begin.</p>

<p>Sources revealed last Wednesday that actor Brad and Nicole were in a relationship after they were spotted touching down at France's Le Castellet Airport.   </p>

<p>During the concert the pair were joined by actress Alia Shawkat, who Brad later shut down claims he's dating.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, sources confirmed that Brad and Nicole were dating, telling Page Six: 'They are seeing each other, they're enjoying a vacation together.'   </p>

<p>Brad, who previously shut down claims he's dating actress Alia Shawkat earlier this year, is now believed to be staying at Château Miraval, an estate he purchased for $67 million in 2011 with his ex-wife Angelina. </p>

<p>Having fun? The fashion model was in LA for a photshoot a few weeks after their meeting in Berlin and met up with Brad (pictured November 2019)</p>

<p>He sported a protective face mask while wearing his signature flat cap, a white T-shirt and khaki green trousers as he touched down in France on a private jet.</p>

<p>He looked stylish as he prepared to spend time in the South of France with Nicole, who he jetted straight in from Los Angeles to meet up with him in Paris, before they embarked on the last leg of their trip.</p>

<p>The US edition of OK! magazine has quoted an eyewitness saying that before boarding their private jet, the pair were seen acting like 'loved up teenagers'.</p>

<p>'They were kissing and Brad was being super attentive to her,' added the source. 'He was in a semi public place but didn't seem to mind people seeing him. She's a real beauty and obviously a lot younger than him.'  </p>

<p>The star's palatial 35-room home located in the village of Correns in the South of France is where he and his ex Angelina, 45, have vacationed in the past and tied the knot in 2014.</p>

<p>Who's who? The dark blonde beauty, left, strikes an uncanny resemblance to the screen star's former spouse (pictured right  in 2019)</p>

<p>They purchased the 1,100-acre estate for $60 million and are thought to have spent between $10 million and $12 million renovating it.</p>

<p>Bombshell Nicole has graced the cover of ELLE and is currently signed to Next Management in Los Angeles and A Management in Germany. </p>

<p>She has brains as well as beauty and her 10 years on the catwalks of the fashion world has helped her become multi-lingual and she can speak in five different languages.</p>

<p>Nicole comes from Bergkamen, Germany, which is in the old industrial Ruhr region and is of Polish heritage.  </p>

<p>On her Facebook page, the fashion star, who is a favourite for British designer Vivienne Westwood, reveals she is single and listed her former city as Warsaw.</p>

<p>Love: In February, Nicole raised eyebrows as she shared a snap of herself along with a caption about her mysterious 'love'</p>

<p>Her career has taken her to fashion shows in New York, Paris and Milan and she has been a cover girl for ELLE, Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire. </p>

<p>At 13, she wanted to be a marine biologist but was apparently spotted by a talent scout in Disneyland Paris and her parents agreed to allow her to model.</p>

<p>But talented and beautiful model still managed to complete her Abitur - German A levels - and founded an organisation devoted to helping sharks.</p>

<p>While she boasts a long list of accomplishments, the model is particularly proud of her son, Emil, who makes regular appearances on her Instagram account.  </p>

<p>When contacted by MailOnline, a representative for Brad Pitt said: 'We don't comment on personal relationships.'</p>

<p>Another: Several weeks later, in March, she alluded to her 'love' once again in another post as she mentioned her 'better half'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Nicole Poturalski's representatives for further comment. </p>

<p>'In his eyes it was like a suggestion that he'd somehow lost custody when that couldn't be further from the truth. If Angelina wanted to leave the country with the children for a permanent move, she'd need to go to court and get permission.</p>

<p>'Brad knows a lot of it is speculation but Angelina has spoken about wanting to leave America before and seeing stuff like this leads to more questions.'</p>

<p>Their eldest son, Maddox, is spending much of his time in South Korea, where he is a university student.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for comment. </p>

<p>Drama: The TV and film star's divorce proceedings with ex Angelina have stretched into a fourth year (pictured in 2015)</p>

<p>The TV and film star's divorce proceedings with ex Angelina, 45, have stretched into a fourth year. </p>

<p>Last month, the Lara Croft actress requested to disqualify Judge John W. Ouderkirk, who married the pair in 2014, for 'failing to disclose' his working relationship with one of her former spouse's attorneys.   </p>

<p>The Ad Astra frontman and the One and Only Ivan star's custody trial is set to begin in October, over a year after their divorce was finalised.</p>

<p>In March, sources claimed Brad has not dated anyone since he split from Angelina in 2016 following a two-year marriage and a 12-year relationship.</p>

<p>'He doesn't feel any need to get back on the dating scene right now - his focus is elsewhere, they told TMZ. </p>

<p>In January, an insider denied rumours the thespian and his first wife Jennifer Aniston had rekindled their romantic relationship following a string of alleged secret dates. </p>

<p>The exes - who were married from 2000 until 2005 - were reported to have rekindled their relationship before their cosy appearance at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.</p>

<p>However, the reports were shut down at the time as the source told MailOnline: 'There is absolutely no truth to this'. </p>

<p>Family: Former Hollywood couple Brad and Angelina share Maddox, 19, Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and 12-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox (pictured in 2014)</p>
