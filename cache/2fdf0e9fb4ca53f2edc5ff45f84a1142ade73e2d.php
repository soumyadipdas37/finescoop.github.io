<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A super-fit mother and PE teacher, 43, has shared the five 'golden rules' she follows to maintain optimum health, including avoiding juices and salt and doing 30 minutes of cardio everyday.</p>

<p>Belinda Norton, who lives on Queensland's Gold Coast, is often complimented on her toned physique, which has been sculpted as a result of her impressive - and consistent - weight training.</p>

<p>The beach-loving blonde said she's focused on lengthening muscles as she ages rather than 'bulking' because she believes that kind of bodybuilder training is 'detrimental to overall mobility'.</p>

<p>Belinda Norton is often complimented on her toned physique, which has been sculpted as a result of her impressive - and consistent - weight training (pictured)</p>

<p>'Our health and wellness is determined by how our body functions not how big our muscles are, not how thick our glutes are and certainly not by our abdominals,' she said (pictured with her daughter)</p>

<p>'Our health and wellness is determined by how our body functions not how big our muscles are, not how thick our glutes are and certainly not by our abdominals,' she said.</p>

<p>'It is determined by our mobility to achieve daily life and work activities. If we cannot function due to injury then we are moving our body incorrectly.'</p>

<p>So what health guidelines does she follow?   </p>

<ol>
<li>Limit sugar and salt</li>
</ol>

<p>High amounts of either of these additives can swell our joints, causing undue stress and injury.  </p>

<p>'If our prime food source is preserved with either salt or sugar we are prone to fluid retention and swelling especially around our joints,' Belinda told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>'A quality food lifestyle of nutrient-loaded whole foods is key to longevity and skin suppleness.'</p>

<p>'If our prime food source is preserved with either salt or sugar we are prone to fluid retention and swelling especially around our joints,' she told FEMAIL</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Avoid juices</li>
</ol>

<p>While some people enjoy starting their day with a smoothie or green vegetable-packed health drink, Belinda steers clear. </p>

<p>'We tend to grab a quick fix, especially juice or iced tea, however these are high in sugar and do not provide the body with its most simple requirement - clean water,' she said.</p>

<p>If you do dabble in the fruit juice department, ensure you're supplementing with water to flush the 'liquid pollutants' out of your system.</p>

<p>While some people enjoy starting their day with a smoothie or green vegetable-packed health drink, Belinda steers clear</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Add yoga, Pilates or stretching to your routine </li>
</ol>

<p>These movements ensure your muscles and joints remain mobile and flexible.</p>

<p>The yoga or Pilates can be completed just as easily at home as it can in a gym or studio, provided you have a mat and 20 minutes set aside where you can work on stretching out your body. </p>

<p>'It is easy important, particularly post-coronavirus, as many of us are are out of our usual routine of movement,' Belinda said.</p>

<p>'Try to move more incidentally. If you are at a desk take breaks often. Go outside and climb the stairs or do step ups on the lounge if you normally climb stairs. Find a better movement routine to ensure alignment.'</p>

<p>Belinda recommends incorporating stretching into your daily routine if possible</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Balance your workouts with strength and cardio</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Quick oats</p></li>
<li><p>Hemp seeds (for salads and protein balls)</p></li>
<li><p>Sunflower seeds</p></li>
<li><p>Pumpkin seeds</p></li>
<li><p>LSA (linseed and soy/almond meal mix)</p></li>
<li><p>Rice bran syrup</p></li>
<li><p>Almonds</p></li>
<li><p>Peanut butter</p></li>
<li><p>Cacao powder</p></li>
<li><p>Coconut oil</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly, Belinda starts the day by doing 30 minutes of cardio.</p>

<p>'Start your morning cardio (walk, run, skip, bike) only 30 minutes before breakfast,' Belinda wrote on her website. </p>

<p>She then returns home to have a hearty breakfast such as green tea poached pears with sesame hemp seeds; coconut yogurt and almond milk porridge or a fried egg with mushrooms and spinach.</p>

<p>Belinda allows herself one or two coffees per day, usually with almond or soy milk.</p>

<p>She believes that doing cardio fasted helps to create long, lean and toned muscles. </p>

<p>High intensity interval training or HIIT is also invaluable for getting in shape, and the PE teacher said she will usually do a high intensity session three times per week at some point in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Typically, this includes activities like hill sprints, body crawls with push ups and step ups on to a box or block. </p>

<p>Belinda likes to do her high intensity training around 4.30pm or 5pm, when she has finished the working day before dinner. </p>

<p>Once a week, Belinda said she'll do a heavy weights session - either with her own body weight or heavy dumbbells. </p>

<p>This might include squats, lunges, curtsy lunges and bicep curls. </p>

<p>She likes to mix up the sessions in order to target different areas of the body.</p>

<p>'I never do heavy weights on heavy period days either,' Belinda posted on Instagram.</p>

<p>'On heavy days, sometimes I just rest and eat perfectly.'   </p>

<p>The devoted mother lost 20 kilos after piling on weight over the course of two pregnancies, overhauling her diet and exercise routine</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MORNING TEA: Mixed berries and a cup of almond milk.</p></li>
<li><p>MAIN MEAL: Barbecue chicken or tofu with raw broccoli and cauliflower with a splash of teriyaki seasoning and hemp seeds, cooked for two minutes in the microwave.</p></li>
<li><p>AFTERNOON TEA: Raw roasted almonds, mini cucumbers and a small carrot.</p></li>
<li><p>HYDRATION: Either water or coconut water.</p></li>
</ul>

<ol start="5">
<li>Love every part of your body </li>
</ol>

<p>Belinda is a firm believer in loving the body you've been gifted.</p>

<p>'Remember to avoid the negative self talk. Find one thing daily about yourself that you can compliment yourself on... it's key to mental wellness and self confidence,' she said.</p>

<p>The devoted mother lost 20 kilos after piling on weight over the course of two pregnancies, overhauling her diet and exercise routine.</p>

<p>Even during the weight loss process Belinda praised herself for small accomplishments along the way.  </p>
