<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Maryland GOP congressional candidate Kim Klacik slammed The View co-host Joy Behar for wearing blackface in a heated interview on the daytime talkshow on Friday.</p>

<p>The conversation had largely remained civil until the end, during which Klacik was replying to a question asked by co-host Sara Haines about President Donald Trump telling journalist Bob Woodward that he had downplayed the seriousness of coronavirus during the pandemic's early days. </p>

<p>'Come on, Kim. Excuse me, I have to say something to you,' Behar interjected. </p>

<p>'He told Bob Woodward that it was a very serious issue, and it's airborne and that it was terrible, and then he went out and told the American people: "Don't wear masks. It's all going to go away." You have to put some blame on your president. I'm sorry!'</p>

<p>In turn, Klacik replied: 'Is this Joy speaking? The same Joy that paraded around in blackface not too long ago?'</p>

<p>After Behar said President Donald Trump deserved blame for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Klacik (pictured) replied: 'Is this Joy speaking? The same Joy that paraded around in blackface not too long ago?'</p>

<p>During a taping of The View in 2016, Behar revealed she had dressed as a 'beautiful African woman' for a Halloween party at age 29 (pictured)</p>

<p>In 2016, Behar admitted during a taping of The View that she dressed up as a 'beautiful African woman' for a Halloween party when she was 29 years old.</p>

<p>She said her curly Afro was natural but that she used makeup 'that was a little bit darker than my skin.'</p>

<p>Behar was angered by Klacik's remarks and denied that she ever wore blackface. </p>

<p>'That's not true. Excuse me, excuse me! The Black community had my back,' Behar replied. </p>

<p>'They know that that was not blackface. That was an homage.' </p>

<p>In response, Klacik said: 'The Black community has my back as well.'</p>

<p>Co-host Sunny Hostin then stepped in to defend Behar and mocked Klacik's claims that African-Americans in Baltimore support her.  </p>

<p>'The Black community does not vote for you! The Black community did not vote for you! What planet are you living on?!' Hostin said. </p>

<p>Klacik attempted to reply to Hostin, but Behar wrapped up the segment and thanked the candidate for her appearance.</p>

<p>Later, Klacik tweeted additional criticism of Behar and her treatment on the show. </p>

<p>Behar lashed out at Klacik and said her costume was an 'homage' and that the Black community 'had her back' (pictured)</p>

<p>Klacik, a staunch Trump supporter, is running against Kweisi Mfume (D) in November to replace the seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings in October 2019. Pictured: Klacik addresses the virtual Republican National Convention on August 24, 2020</p>

<p>'The ladies of <?php echo e('@'); ?>TheView didn't like what I had to say, so naturally they cut me off,' she wrote in a tweet that has been liked more than 26,000 times.</p>

<p>'Why are they silencing Black Women? Hey, <?php echo e('@'); ?>JoyVBehar - I think your White Privilege is showing through your blackface!'</p>

<p>This is not the first time a View guest has called out Behar for wearing blackface. Last year, in November 2019, Donald Trump Jr also attacked the host. </p>

<p>'We've all done things that we regret. Joy, you have worn blackface,' Trump Jr said during his interview.    </p>
