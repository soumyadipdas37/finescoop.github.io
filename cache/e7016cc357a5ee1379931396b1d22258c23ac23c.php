<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lisa Armstrong did a good deed on Monday when she left out ex husband Ant McPartlin's possessions for people to take. </p>

<p>No doubt the items were no longer wanted by Ant, 44, so Lisa made sure they went to a good home instead. </p>

<p>The 43-year-old make-up artist placed them in boxes marked 'Help yourself' and put them out in the street. </p>

<p>'Help yourself': Lisa Armstrong left ex husband Ant McPartlin's unwanted possessions out on the street in London for people to take on Monday before moving home</p>

<p>Tidy up: The items were easily identifiable as Ant's because they included his Newcastle United shirts and a 'Team Ant' foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway (pictured in 2005)</p>

<p>There was also Ant's old dressing gown and a pile of board games. </p>

<p>No longer needed was Piers Morgan’s book The Insider and Lisa threw in her own Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales from the Dance Floor - she is Strictly's head make-up artist</p>

<p>Lisa was also throwing out a bowl used by labrador, Hurley, as well as a Banksy artwork calendar and a Jamie Oliver book.</p>

<p>No more junk: Lisa was also throwing out a bowl used by labrador, Hurley, as well as a Banksy artwork</p>

<p>A source told The Sun that Lisa is leaving her West London house and wanted a 'big clear out.'</p>

<p>They added: 'Ant had already sifted through what he wanted to keep and had gophers collect them in recent weeks.</p>

<p>'What was left is being offered for free. His bathrobe has been taken. Footie memorabilia has also been given away. But it was the end for his Newcastle shirts.”</p>

<p>Another source said: 'Some of it is Ant’s, some of it is Lisa’s and some of it they bought together.' </p>

<p>Check this out: One man appeared over the moon to be looking through the former couple's book collection</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said he did not agree with Lisa's decision to throw out these possessions, even though she is divorced.</p>

<p>He was particularly astonished to see she had thrown out his book.  </p>

<p>Piers told co-host Susanna Reid and the audience: 'Ant McPartlin’s ex Lisa Armstrong – who is a wonderful makeup artist, she does my makeup on Life Stories.</p>

<p>Free: Lisa had left a sweet sign advising people to help themselves </p>

<p>'And I thought we were friends. I really did. I was quite friendly with Ant. Apparently this is stuff that Ant himself didn’t want back.</p>

<p>'These are the unwanted items that neither of them ever wanted to see again. There were things you’d expect, like Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales From the Dancefloor. Wholly understandable. </p>

<p>'His Newcastle shirt. I wouldn’t want to keep them either. A Team Ant foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway. Again, why would you want that?</p>

<p>'So you have all these things – and in the middle of it, you have a copy of my book, The Insider.'</p>

<p>Later on in the show, Piers said Lisa had contacted him to apologise.  </p>

<p>She told him: '"Oh my god, I’m so sorry, I wasn’t even there. I haven’t even see that book. Are you mad at me?"’ Yes – I am mad at you. No, I just want my book back!' </p>

<p>Piers Morgan said Lisa had contacted him to apologise for throwing out his book, saying: '"Oh my god, I’m so sorry, I wasn’t even there. I haven’t even see that book. Are you mad at me?"'</p>

<p>Lisa split from Ant in 2018 after 12 years of marriage, and is now reported to be dating James Green. </p>

<p>Lisa and Ant finalised their divorce back in April after their split in January 2018 following the presenter's highly documented battle with painkillers and alcohol.</p>

<p>The Saturday Night Takeaway star has continued his relationship with his former personal assistant and girlfriend of two years, Anne-Marie Corbett, 43.  </p>

<p>However last month Lisa appeared to confirm that she was dating her new lover James, after fans reached out on Twitter to congratulate her on the happy news.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lisa has named her new cosmetics range after the pals who supported her following her split from Ant. </p>

<p>Lots to look at: Among the haul were picture frames as Lisa cleared out the old</p>

<p>Moving on: Ant has already taken what he wanted from the house and no doubt he won't mind one bit </p>
