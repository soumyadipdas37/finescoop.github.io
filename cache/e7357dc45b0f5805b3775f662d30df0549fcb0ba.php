<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother says her daughter was 'let down' after she killed herself when her face-to-face counselling sessions were cancelled during lockdown.</p>

<p>Georgia Gallaway, 19, had suffered with mental health problems for many years but had finally agreed to seek help before the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>But when the UK went into its coronavirus lockdown, the sessions she had booked were replaced with ones over the telephone.</p>

<p>Her family say she tried to pursue them, but struggled to talk with a stranger she had never met. This caused a downward spiral that resulted in her taking her own life in July, her grieving mother Sophie Alway has claimed.</p>

<p>Ms Alway has now launched a campaign to help other youngsters so no other parent has to go through what she has. She also wants to set up a support group to stop young girls like Georgia falling through the net.  </p>

<p>'There was very little help, and because of lockdown any help she did get was over the phone,' she said. 'But like many teenagers, Georgia really struggled with talking at all let alone on the phone to a stranger she couldn't see.</p>

<p>'She was so let down. I don't blame any individuals but it was a system failure. Things need to change and our children's lives matter. </p>

<p>'Georgia's life mattered and I'm determined to make sure her life makes a difference to others and can hopefully save many lives.'</p>

<p>Ms Alway said she wanted the support group to be a 'safe place where young girls can come and talk, or not talk, while being around others that have similar feelings will make them realise they are not alone.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I want to build a huge support system so they always have someone they can reach out too, I never want another child to feel so low and alone that they think suicide is their best or only option.</p>

<p>'Georgia was the funniest person you could meet, she would do little dance routines constantly and was always trying to make people laugh, so many people have come forward since she's died to tell me how she helped them through hard times.</p>

<p>'But she never really confided in anyone about hers, she thought there was something wrong with her. She didn't feel her problems were 'bad enough' to talk to someone about, and got angry at herself for the way she felt.</p>

<p>Her family say she tried to pursue them, but struggled to talk with a stranger she had never met. This caused a downward spiral that resulted in her taking her own life in July, her grieving mother Sophie Alway has claimed</p>

<p>Ms Alway has now launched a campaign to help other youngsters so no other parent has to go through what she has. She also wants to set up a support group for young girls</p>

<p>'Her emotions would come out at home and she would often sob her heart out in her room at home, I felt so helpless.'</p>

<p>Ms Alway, who lives in Falmouth, Cornwall, with partner Lee and daughter Mia, said another problem she faced was not being able to stay involved once her daughter turned 18.</p>

<p>She added: 'Parents need to be allowed to be more involved, as soon as she turned 18 they didn't involve me in anything, they said she was an 'adult' but she wasn't. She was still a child in so many ways.</p>

<p>'I don't blame any authorities. I just want improvements to be made. She did do the phone sessions but just didn't find it helpful as she struggled to talk on the phone.</p>

<p>'She did need more help, but I don't want to place the blame on anyone, it was just an overall system failure.'</p>

<p>Her friends and family are also now fundraising to hold a celebration of her life after pandemic restrictions prevented them from saying a proper goodbye.</p>

<p>Sarah Brandwood, who set up the group alongside another family friend Carly Geach, said: 'Georgia was the most beautiful girl, with a massive smile and an infectious laugh. She brightened up everyone's day mostly being a total clown!'</p>

<p>An online donation page has been set up to raise money for an event for Georgia, with any funds left over going to a charity that raises awareness of suicide among young people and campaigns for change.</p>

<p>They have already smashed the initial £4,000 target within the first four days.</p>

<p>The suicide rate for men in England and Wales in 2019 was the highest for two decades, official figures have revealed.</p>

<p>New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), published on Tuesday, found there were 5,691 suicides registered in England and Wales in 2019, with a rate of 11 deaths per 100,000 population.</p>

<p>The ONS said men accounted for around three-quarters of suicide deaths registered in 2019 - 4,303 compared with 1,388 women.</p>

<p>The England and Wales male suicide rate of 16.9 deaths per 100,000 was the highest since 2000 but remained in the line with the 2018 rate, it added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rate for women aged between 10 and 24 has almost doubled since 2012 from 1.6 deaths per 100,000 (81 deaths) to its highest level at 3.1 deaths per 100,000 females (159 deaths) in 2019. </p>

<p>Yorkshire and Humber was the area with the highest rate of suicide for both men and women. </p>

<p>In total, the rate for women was 5.3 deaths per 100,000, the highest since 2004.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>'She was always dancing and making others smile, caring and protective of her loved ones. Unfortunately, she couldn't see how beautiful she was, and she fought a battle every day unable to see those qualities.</p>

<p>'She hated everything about herself from the inside out, which made her feel as though people only pretended to like her; she felt unworthy, and unlovable and always needed reassurance.'</p>

<p>Ms Brandwood said that Georgia was reluctant to talk to someone but eventually started to open up to her mum.</p>

<p>She added: 'She told her that the reason she wouldn't have counselling was because she didn't think her problems were bad enough and that there was just something wrong with her - she actually thought that the professionals might laugh at her problems.'</p>

<p>Georgia didn't enjoy school and had some bullying issues but the family say they can't pinpoint the moment her problems began.</p>

<p>Ms Brandwood said: 'Georgia finally had a plan and was going to attend counselling sessions which perked her up a bit, and she started going to the gym which she really loved.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, this was all at the start of lockdown and not having a routine or being able to see her friends was a real struggle for Georgia and she started to spiral downwards. She had no motivation or energy to do anything, she couldn't see the point.</p>

<p>'Nobody can explain the agonising emotional and physical pain that losing a child causes, the guilt that is left is horrendous and Sophie wants to raise awareness for those with mental health problems, especially teenage girls. </p>

<p>'She wants to find a way to provide safe places where teenagers can talk, or not talk but be around others who are feeling the same and understand them.</p>

<p>'No parent, sibling or friend should go through the horrendous pain that Sophie and her family have endured.'</p>

<p>The family would now like to hold a celebration of Georgia's life on October 30, on what would have been her 20th birthday, because Covid restrictions limit the number of people who can attend her funeral. </p>

<p>Any extra funds raised will go to a charity that raises awareness of suicide among young people and campaigns for change.</p>
