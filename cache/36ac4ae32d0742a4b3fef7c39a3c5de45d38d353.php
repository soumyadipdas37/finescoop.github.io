<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A glamorous model who had a love child with cricket legend Dean Jones during a decade-long affair has been cruelly trolled just hours after his sudden death.</p>

<p>Kerri-Anne Hamilton, the cricket star's well documented former mistress, was viciously targeted on her Twitter account on Thursday night by trolls calling her an 'irresponsible woman' and a 'DNA thief'.</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton met Jones when she was working at a golf day in the late 1990s and the pair began a torrid affair.</p>

<p>The married father-of-two would regularly travel up from Melbourne to Sydney to see her and the couple enjoyed overseas holidays together.</p>

<p>But in early 2009 Ms Hamilton fell pregnant and by mid-2010 the affair had become public.</p>

<p>After Ms Hamilton shared her tale on A Current Affair, Jones confirmed the child was his.</p>

<p>'Following an on-and-off relationship with a woman, a child was conceived and subsequently delivered,' he said in a statement at the time. </p>

<p>Adding to the scandal was the fact Jones had been celebrated as Victorian Father of the Year in 2007.  </p>

<p>Kerri-Anne Hamilton, the former lover of cricket legend Dean Jones, has been viciously trolled online just hours after his death from a heart attack in an Indian hotel room</p>

<p>Jones had a decade-long romance with Ms Hamilton that led to a child in 2009. Throughout his romance with Ms Hamilton he was still with wife Jane, with who he has two daughters Isabella and Phoebe (pictured)</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton was viciously targeted on her Twitter account on Thursday night by trolls calling her an 'irresponsible woman' and a 'DNA thief' on videos she posted of her son with Jones</p>

<p>The vile Twitter attack came just two hours after it emerged Jones, 59, who was working as a cricket commentator in India, died after suffering a massive heart attack.</p>

<p>Fellow commentator and cricket legend Brett Lee unsuccessfully tried to save his mate's life with CPR.  </p>

<p>On a post Ms Hamilton made showing hers and Jones' son playing baseball, the troll wrote: 'Give him a cricket bat'.</p>

<p>That was followed by another comment: 'Another child where both parents choose to create life. NOT. An accident created by an irresponsible woman. DNA theft.'</p>

<p>After a preview for Ms Hamilton's interview with A Current Affair in 2010 referenced a romance with a mystery 'retired cricketer', Jones came out to set the record straight.</p>

<p>'I can confirm that I am the retired cricketer referred to in the A Current Affair preview last night (Friday),' he said in a statement.</p>

<p>'Following an on-and-off relationship with a women (sic), a child was conceived and subsequently delivered. I can also confirm I have supported the mother and child more generously than was agreed.</p>

<p>'At no stage have I not met my obligations.</p>

<p>'My immediate aim is to seek the forgiveness and understanding of family.' </p>

<p>News of Jones' death at the Trident Hotel in Mumbai, India, late on Thursday night Australian time, has left the cricket world in shock and mourning the loss of one of the game's legends.</p>

<p>In early 2009 Ms Hamilton fell pregnant with Jones' child and by mid-2010 the story was out, with her sharing her tale to A Current Affair leading the former batsman to admit it was his</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton (centre) was a model at the time she met Jones, before becoming an air hostess</p>

<p>Jones is seen batting during the 1987 World Cup match against India on October 9, 1987</p>

<p>The former flashy batsman and 1980s icon was in India commentating on the IPL T20 tournament alongside a host of other retired superstars of the game.</p>

<p>Lee was in the hotel lobby with Jones at the time of his heart attack and desperately tried to save him. </p>

<p>He was rushed to hospital but couldn't be saved.</p>

<p>Jones and Lee were in the city as part of Star India's commentary team for the Indian Premier League, which is being played in the UAE because of coronavirus but is still being commentated on from India. </p>

<p>Lee, distraught by the loss of his colleague and friend, courageously returned to television for Star India's coverage of the IPL little more than three hours later.</p>

<p>Jones would have normally appeared alongside him in the studio for their IPL pre-match segment 'Select Dugout'.  </p>

<p>'I think the thing we want to say about Deano is he would have wanted us to be here tonight. It's pretty much the "Select Deano" we call it. It's Deano's dugout tonight,' Lee said. </p>

<p>Jones had been staying in the Mumbai hotel with Brian Lara (second from right), Graeme Swann, Scott Styris (right) and Brett Lee (second from left) </p>

<p>Former Australian cricketer Brett Lee has bravely fronted television cameras in India just hours after trying in vain to save the life of Dean Jones</p>

<p>'He is an absolute legend. Firstly to his family and friends we send our condolences. It's a real tough day for everyone, not only for his close mates ... and the whole cricketing world in general.</p>

<p>'What Deano would've wanted is for us to come out here in the dugout, get it done, have some fun for the game we all love.'</p>

<p>Former New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris, another member of the commentary team, choked back tears speaking alongside Lee.  </p>

<p>'Who would have thought ... this morning we got up, I had breakfast with Deano. I watched him jog up and down the hallway,' Styris said.</p>

<p>'That was his way of keeping fit because of course we are in the bubble here in Mumbai. Who would have thought merely a couple of hours later he had this heart attack or some sort of cardiac problem. It's incredibly sad.</p>

<p>'He thought this to be the Deano show really. He's on to me every day with new ideas on how we can make it better. So I think it's the right thing to do to be here, it's gonna be hard but we hope to make him feel proud tonight.' </p>

<p>Jones had been staying at the hotel with Styris, Lee, West Indies legend Brian Lara and former England spinner Graeme Swann. </p>

<p>Jones' daughter Augusta opened up about her heartbreak with a post on Instagram as news broke in Australia, sharing a series of pictures of her and her dad together.  </p>

<p>'I cannot believe I am writing this. My heart is broken, My Dad. My Hero. The sweetest and most caring person you could ever meet,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Australian cricket great Dean Jones died on Thursday and leaves behind his wife Jane (left) and their two daughters, Augusta (right) and Phoebe (second from the left) </p>

<p>His daughter Augusta opened up about her heartbreak with a post on Instagram on Friday</p>

<p>The world has been left rocked by the death of cricket legend Dean Jones. His daughter Augusta shared a heartfelt post asking: 'How will I do this without you?'</p>

<p>Jones celebrates his One Day International century against Pakistan at the WACA on January 2, 1987</p>

<p>'If only you could see now how many lives you touched. If only you could see now how loved you were.</p>

<p>'You held my hand through the toughest times this year, how will I do this without you?</p>

<p>'The heavens have opened their gates for another angel. Wait for me dad. Everything I do is for you. I love you Dad.'</p>

<p>Just two weeks before Jones' shock death, his daughter Phoebe shared a Father's Day Instagram post for her dad, who was already in India at the time. </p>

<p>The snap shows Jones walking back to the pavilion with bat in his hand after being dismissed during a match in his heyday.  </p>

<p>Phoebe, who was a little girl at the time, is seen waiting at the fence for her father.</p>

<p>'Can you spot me? This is me waiting for [dad] to come home and he's only just left!' she wrote. </p>

<p>'Happy Father's Day to the most dedicated and generous man I know. I love you!' </p>

<p>Tragically, Phoebe did not get to see her father again. </p>

<p>Just two weeks before Jones' shock death, his daughter Phoebe shared a Father's Day Instagram post for 'dedicated' dad </p>

<p>In May, Jones' daughter Augusta posted a pictured of the family-of-four in an embrace and referred to the coronavirus pandemic. Pictured: The caption Augusta used for the photo</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison: 'A true entertainer at the crease, whose flair with the bat and electric running between the wickets changed the game forever.' </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The cricket great played in 52 Tests for Australia and averaged 46.55 batting in the middle order.</p>

<p>He scored 3,631 runs and 11 centuries in his illustrious career. </p>

<p>Former Australian cricketer, friend and teammate of Jones, Rodney Hogg,  told 3AW Jones was the toughest cricketer he has known.</p>

<p>'Deano was a star, an absolute star.</p>

<p>'His depth of knowledge in cricket was very, very incredible.'</p>

<p>'Dean Jones was a hero to a generation of cricketers and will forever be remembered as a legend of this great game,' Cricket Australia chairman Earl Eddings said.</p>

<p>'Anyone who watched cricket in the 1980s and 1990s will fondly recall his cavalier approach at the crease and the incredible energy and passion he brought to every game he played.</p>

<p>'This is a truly sad day. Deano's loss will be felt not just at home in Australia, but across the globe.'</p>

<p>Australia coach Justin Langer said Jones was integral to the rebuilding of the Test and ODI side that went on to dominate the sport for nearly 20 years.</p>

<p>'What a great player and a great bloke. We are shocked and very sad to hear of his passing,' Langer said.</p>

<p>'Deano was a true legend of Australian sport and world cricket, one of the great players and personalities in a golden time for the game.</p>

<p>'His role in the team's World Cup win in 1987 and the 1989 Ashes under AB were a huge turning point for Australian cricket.</p>

<p>'His double century in Madras was one of the greatest and most courageous innings of all time.</p>

<p>'We can only hope to make Australians as proud of our team as they were of Deano, he will be missed by the game and millions of people around the world.</p>

<p>'Our love to Jane and the girls.'</p>

<p>Lara, a former international cricketer for West Indies who had been commentating with Jones, shared a video of the pair jokingly boxing in the studio.</p>

<p>'I love you too Dean Jones!! You have been a joy and absolute pleasure to work with at Star Sports India,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'The world has has lost a real legend and lover of our great game, cricket. </p>

<p>Cricket commentator Tim Lane said his death had shocked the cricketing world.</p>

<p>'He was idolised as a player because Victoria didn’t produce any great batsmen for a really really long time.'</p>

<p>Fast bowler Brett Lee (left) desperately tried to revive him Jones (right) after he suffered a massive heart attack on Thursday</p>

<p>A classy right-handed batsman, Jones played in an era of great change in Australian cricket. </p>

<p>He played his first of 52 Tests against the mighty West Indies at Port of Spain in 1982 with his most famous innings his double century in the tied Madras Test in 1986.</p>

<p>There, he spent more than eight hours at the crease in 42C heat and severe humidity for his 210.</p>

<p>It earned him not only a place in Australian cricket folklore, but left him on a drip in hospital after losing eight kilos and any memory of the second half of his innings.</p>

<p>'The fractured memory of that amazing experience still jumps back into my mind in bits and pieces,' Jones wrote in his 1994 autobiography 'Deano My Call'.</p>

<p>'Some of them blurred and some crystal clear.</p>

<p>'Sometimes I have to refer to descriptions written at the time to fill in huge gaps in my own consciousness.'</p>

<p>Jones (pictured) is hailed for revolutionising the ODI format</p>

<p>Jones is seen during a ODI match against South Africa at the SCG in January 1994</p>

<p>Former Australia coach Bob Simpson said he had not 'seen a braver innings'.</p>

<p>'He was running on adrenaline,' Simpson told Cricinfo.</p>

<p>'During breaks we would have one bloke waiting to take off his pads and another would strip him and put him in an ice bath just to try and revitalise him. It was immensely courageous.'</p>

<p>For all his toughness shown in that innings, Jones led the way with his aggression in the white-ball game during an era where teams were still cautious with their ODI batting.</p>

<p>His 6068 runs in the format was the second highest of all-time when he played his last match in 1994, while his strike-rate of 72.56 was also brisk for that era.</p>

<p>He played with flamboyance, not afraid to walk down the pitch to bowlers, attacked when running between the wickets and saved runs in the field.</p>

<p>The end of his time in Australia's Test team was controversial, with his axing in 1992 still one of the most perplexing in Australian cricket.</p>

<p>Former Australian cricket captain Allan Border told Foxsports.com.au Jones 'revolutionised the game'. </p>

<p>'I can't believe this news but I'd like to pay tribute to Brett Lee for everything he did,' Border said.</p>

<p>'Deano was unbelievable at the Test level but his aggression at the one day level will be remembered forever.</p>

<p>'He loved his family, cricket golf and wine. I loved batting with him and he backed me and for that I will always love him.'</p>

<p>Cricket greats posted their condolences when the shock news broke on Thursday night. </p>

<p>Former England Test cricketer Monty Panesar said: 'Very sad to hear passing away of Dean Jones.</p>

<p>'Top commentator and coach, great cricket brain, will be missed by the cricketing community #RIPdeanjones.'  </p>

<p>Indian cricket coach Ravi Shastri said he was shocked to lose 'a colleague and a dear friend'.</p>

<p>'Gone so young. Condolences to the family and may his soul rest in peace,' he wrote. </p>

<p>'A wonderful soul taken away too soon. Had the opportunity to play against him during my first tour of Australia,' he said.</p>

<p>'May his soul rest in peace and my condolences to his loved ones.'  </p>

<p>'A genuine good guy and a huge loss.'</p>

<p>Cricketers quickly posted their condolences to Twitter when the news broke on Thursday night</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the 'absolute cricketing legend'</p>

<p>To a generation of Australian sport lovers he was our golden boy, a confident, cocky cavalier with the looks of a Greek God and the ego of a Hollywood superstar.</p>

<p>He was christened Dean Mervyn Jones but to us he was always Deano, a cricketing matinee idol in the days before Twitter and Facebook.</p>

<p>Not that Deano needed social media to promote his 'brand'. He attracted plenty of followers the old-fashioned way – by singing his own praises whenever a microphone or camera were in range.</p>

<p>And fair enough too. Deano had plenty to crow about.</p>

<p>Jones celebrates his One Day International century against Pakistan at the WACA on January 2, 1987 </p>

<p>It is a truism of human nature that we all think the stars of our own era are the brightest that ever shone. Today's AFL and NRL fans are convinced that their games started the day that Dustin Martin or Nathan Cleary first tied on a boot.</p>

<p>And try telling a current day cricket tragic that 35 years ago Australia boasted a player who combined the timing of Steve Smith, the swagger of David Warner and the grit of … well, actually I can't think of any modern day player who has come close to exhibiting the grit of Deano … and they'll look at you as if you're nuts.</p>

<p>But that was Dean Jones, who passed away last night aged just 59.</p>

<p>It's hard to put into words how big a part of Australian cricket Deano was at his peak in the mid-1980s and 90s.</p>

<p>He wasn't the rock of the team like captain Allan Border, or the court jester like Merv Hughes. He wasn't even a star in the making like Steve Waugh, but in some ways he was bigger than all of them.</p>

<p>It was his aura, his glow. In the vernacular of the time, he was 'full of himself', but in a good way. His team-mates used to joke that on any day of the year Deano could tell you his batting average down to the third decimal point, and when he strode out to the middle you'd swear he owned every blade of grass.</p>

<p>But on his day he was good, oh man was he good.</p>

<p>In a locker room surrounded by future greats like Alan Border (pictured celebrating victory together in 1987), Merv Hughes and Steve Waugh, Jones still seemed bigger than them all</p>

<p>One Day Cricket could have been invented for Dean Jones. The lights, the crowds, the theatre. He lapped it up like a dry-tongued dog at a water bowl.</p>

<p>His critics called him a fancy dan, a pretty-boy show-pony who wouldn't be sighted when the whips were cracking, but boy did he prove them wrong.</p>

<p>On September 18, 1986 in Chennai, India, that pretty-boy show-pony played arguably the gutsiest innings in the history of Test cricket.</p>

<p>On a day so hot that you could have fried an egg on a taxi bonnet, Deano batted himself to the point of physical and mental exhaustion.</p>

<p>At one stage he walked down the other end and told Border that he couldn't continue.</p>

<p>'Alright, go then,' snapped Captain Grumpy to his Victorian team-mate. 'I'll get a Queenslander out here to do the job'.</p>

<p>On September 18, 1986 in Chennai, India, Jones played arguably the gutsiest innings in the history of Test cricket</p>

<p>Deano looked daggers at him, strode back to the crease and batted on. And on and on and on.</p>

<p>Dehydrated, delirious, barely able to hold his bat and half blinded by sweat, he stayed out there for 502 minutes before being dismissed for 210 and setting up only the second tied Test in the game's history.</p>

<p>No-one ever called Dean Jones soft again.</p>

<p>And now he's gone. Dismissed early and suddenly to a heart attack in India, the country that he had come to know as his second home.</p>

<p>Today's young cricket fans will have their own heroes of course, and they will never believe that anyone born over 25 years ago will be able to hold a candle to them.</p>

<p>But they will be wrong. In the case of Dean Mervyn Jones, very wrong indeed.</p>
