<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Disgraced Trump fixer and personal lawyer Michael Cohen's forthcoming tell-all book reveals supposed examples of the president's alleged racism, hatred of Barack Obama and reaction to a surprising strip show performance.  </p>

<p>Cohen's memoir, Disloyal: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump, hits bookshelves Tuesday - despite his still serving out a three-year federal prison sentence for tax evasion, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations.  </p>

<p>In the book, Cohen reveals information about a variety of alleged Trump actions and statements that have made headlines since the former reality TV star ran for office, according to the Washington Post, which obtained an advance copy of it. </p>

<p>Disgraced lawyer Michael Cohen's forthcoming memoir reveals all sorts of unflattering anecdotes about President Trump (on September 4) </p>

<p>Cohen, who is still serving prison time for federal convictions, wrote of Trump's 'hatred' for Barack Obama and also presented alleged instances of his racist commentary</p>

<p>Cohen writes that he was 'one of Trump’s bad guys,' while calling Trump - who he had previously defended to the hilt - 'a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man.'</p>

<p>He wrote that during the 2016 campaign, Trump allegedly said that minorities were 'not my people' and that the president also supposedly claimed he would 'never get the Hispanic vote,' because, 'Like the blacks, they’re too stupid to vote for Trump.' </p>

<p>The disbarred lawyer detailed Trump's 'hatred and contempt' of Obama, too.</p>

<p>Over the years, Trump has been criticized for spreading 'birther' statements, which insinuated that Obama was unqualified to be president because he might not have been born in the US - an untrue theory. </p>

<p>Among Cohen's book's claims was that Trump said the only reason why Obama had been admitted to Columbia University for undergrad and then Harvard Law School was because of 'f---ing affirmative action.'</p>

<p>Cohen also wrote that Trump's 'low opinion of all black folks' included him allegedly saying: 'Tell me one country run by a black person that isn’t a s---hole. They are all complete f---ing toilets.' </p>

<p>Cohen wrote that Trump said the only reason why Barack Obama (pictured) got into Columbia University and Harvard Law was 'affirmative action'</p>

<p>Cohen also wrote that Trump allegedly said Nelson Mandela (in 1996) had turned South Africa into a 's**thole' and that he 'was no leader'</p>

<p>Cohen wrote that Trump allegedly said that his supporters would 'think it’s cool that I slept with a porn star,' of the Stormy Daniels (in 2019) payoff scandal</p>

<p>According to Cohen, Trump used the 's**thole' phrase again, when talking about South African President Nelson Mandela. </p>

<p>When Mandela died in 2013, Cohen wrote that Trump didn't think Mandela 'was a real leader — not the kind he respected.'</p>

<p>Cohen claimed that Trump said 'Mandela f---ed the whole country up. Now it’s a s---hole. F--- Mandela. He was no leader.'  </p>

<p>Mandela was a key figure in ending apartheid in South Africa, a practice which divided the country along racial lines. </p>

<p>Trump was slammed in January 2018 after he allegedly said, during an Oval Office meeting about the visa lottery, 'Why do we want all these people from "s**thole countries" coming here?' while supposedly referring to Central American and African nations. </p>

<p>He later denied making the 's**thole countries' remark. </p>

<p>In another anecdote that bites from headline-making news about Trump, Cohen wrote about a supposed 2013 visit Trump made to a Las Vegas strip club.  </p>

<p>Cohen wrote that Trump went to the strip club with Russian father-son oligarchs Aras and Emin Agalarov. </p>

<p>During the visit, Cohen claimed that they watched as one of the strip club performers simulated urinating on another performer, who then pretended to drink it. </p>

<p>According to Cohen, Trump reaction to what they saw on stage was 'disbelief and delight.'</p>

<p>In January 2017, word surfaced of a so-called 'pee tape,' which was supposedly filmed at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013, when Trump was attending the Miss Universe pageant there. </p>

<p>In the alleged video - described in the Steele Dossier - Trump was said to have watched two prostitutes as they urinated on a bed Barack and Michelle Obama supposedly slept in.  </p>

<p>The tape was supposedly made because Russia's state security agency, the FSB, had the hotel under surveillance and had multiple microphones and hidden cameras in the room.  </p>

<p>Cohen also devoted portions of his book to Trump’s alleged role in the Stormy Daniels hush money scandal, in which she claimed that she had an extramarital affair with Trump, but was paid $130,000 to keep her quiet prior to the 2016 election. </p>

<p>Cohen admitted to using his own money to pay Daniels off, but said that Trump reimbursed him with 'fake legal fees,' according the AP, which also obtained an advance copy of the memoir. </p>

<p>'It never pays to settle these things, but many, many friends have advised me to pay,' Cohen wrote Trump said. 'If it comes out, I’m not sure how it would play with my supporters. But I bet they’d think it’s cool that I slept with a porn star.'</p>

<p>While making all these alleged revelations about his former client, Cohen also wrote: 'I care for Donald Trump, even to to this day.'</p>

<p>He also noted: 'and I had and still have a lot of affection for him.' </p>

<p>Cohen wrote that his support of Trump for president was due to thinking 'Trump was a visionary with a no-nonsense attitude and the charisma to attract all kinds of voters.' he writes. </p>

<p>But, wrote that he really wanted Trump in the White House 'because I wanted the power that he would bring to me.'</p>

<p>In a statement to the Washington Post Saturday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that 'Michael Cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress. He has lost all credibility, and it’s unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies.'</p>

<p>The White House, meanwhile told the AP that the memoir amounted to 'fan fiction.'</p>

<p>Cohen 'readily admits to lying routinely but expects people to believe him now so that he can make money from book sales,' White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern said in a statement to the news agency. </p>

<p>'It’s unfortunate that the media is exploiting this sad and desperate man to attack President Trump.'</p>
