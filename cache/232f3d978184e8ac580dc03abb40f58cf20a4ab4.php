<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mikel Arteta has lauded praise on Arsenal's new summer signing Gabriel after a man of the match display in their 3-0 win over Fulham.</p>

<p>The £25m summer signing scored the Gunners' second as they cruised to an opening day victory away at Craven Cottage.</p>

<p>After a few nervy moments in the opening few minutes, the 22-year-old gained composure and confidence and Scott Parker's side found it tough to get past the young Brazilian.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta has praised Gabriel for his man of the match display during Arsenal's 3-0 win</p>

<p>Gabriel scored on his first competitive game in six months since playing for Lille in March</p>

<p>His performance was even more impressive seeing that the last time he played a competitive game was for Lille during a 1-0 victory over Lyon on March 8.</p>

<p>After Arsenal's victory, Arteta praised both his new signings Gabriel and Willian who got himself a couple of assists.</p>

<p>He said: 'Yeah they've been training very well, for Gabi it was a big challenge to come into this small ground in the Premier League.</p>

<p>'Gabi did really well, I think he didn't play for six months with everything that happened in France. For the new guys more than any again I think was brilliant today.'</p>

<p>During his post-match interview, Arteta was asked about a number of his player's futures at the club.</p>

<p>Alexandre Lacazette scored the opener for the Gunners after just eight minutes, though he has been linked with a move away from the club.</p>

<p>Arteta said: 'He is in my plans - a player I like a lot. He knows that he has Eddie (Nketiah) next to him and he's going to push him. Whoever is in better shape is going to play and that's the same for everyone.</p>

<p>It was a good start for Arteta's side with a lot of positives to take from their win over Fulham</p>

<p>Another player linked with a move away from the club over the summer is Rob Holding.</p>

<p>Arsenal's boss said that he has spoken to Holding in an attempt to keep him at the Emirates despite talks of him wanting a loan move.</p>

<p>He said:  'I said to him (Rob Holding) change your mind because you're not going anywhere. Again Rob is another one, he's a difficult time. And now why I have to let him go? He's playing so why leave this football club.'</p>

<p>Arteta spoke about a number of players' futures at the club including Alexandre Lacazette</p>

<p>One issue which hasn't gone away is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's proposed new contract.</p>

<p>The deadly striker who scored Arsenal's third goal in superb fashion, has kept everyone waiting with announcement of a new deal.</p>

<p>Arteta said regarding Aubameyang's new deal: 'I'm really positive we'll get it done and in the next few days you'll get some news.'</p>

<p>And Arsenal's victory over Fulham saw Mohamed Elneny make his first appearance since the end of the 2018/19 season.</p>

<p>Artera said: 'Mo has been excellent since day one in training. I know him from playing together and I know what he can give us and how willing he is to improve. I think today he has been phenomenal.'</p>
