<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>US researchers have warned that a shortage of monkeys could delay efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine. </p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has increased demand for the animals, which are challenging to source for primate research even under normal circumstances due to the cost and controversy surrounding it. </p>

<p>Rhesus monkeys are most commonly used in biomedical research, according to The National Primate Research Centers. </p>

<p>'We can't find any rhesus any longer. They've completely disappeared, Mark Lewis, the CEO of contract research firm Bioqual, said. Rhesus monkey pictured above </p>

<p>'Nationally, there is basically a big shortage,' Koen Van Rompay, of the California National Primate Research Centre, told The Atlantic magazine. </p>

<p>The increased demand for the monkeys during the global pandemic has been coupled with a severe decline in supply from China.</p>

<p>China provided 60 per cent of the nearly 35,000 monkeys imported to the US last year. However the country shut off its exports after coronavirus hit. </p>

<p> Further complicating the situation, monkeys infected with coronavirus must be kept in special Animal Biosafety Level 3 labs which have a unique design to help prevent the spread of the virus. </p>

<p>The US only has a limited number of such laboratories. </p>

<p>US researchers say monkeys are useful in testing out a potential Covid-19 vaccine as the animals' immune system is almost identical to that of a human. </p>

<p>The primates are usually tested on as a final step before human clinical trials, but now some pharmaceutical companies are reportedly considering going ahead with human trials before testing on monkeys at all. </p>
