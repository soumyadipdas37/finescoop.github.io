<p>Open: Jade Thirlwall has opened up about feeling 'ashamed' of her heritage when she was growing up during a candid discussion with her mother</p>

<p>Speaking about her experience, Jade revealed: 'I had suppressed who I was because I wasn't proud. </p>

<p>'I had been bullied into thinking I should be ashamed of my identity, so I didn't talk enough about my heritage in interviews. It makes me sad to think about it now.'</p>

<p>Jade explained that she believes her reluctance to discuss her heritage stemmed from a lack of representation for her culture while growing up.  </p>

<p>The singer said: 'When I was younger, I didn't see enough representation of Arabs in magazines or on TV, and when I saw people who looked like my granddad they were always misrepresented. </p>

<p>Strong bond: Jade and her mum Norma, 62, detailed how they are currently looking into their culture more during the September issue of Vogue Arabia</p>

<p>'I regret now that I didn't talk about it more, but I was young and scared. I'm trying to make up for it now.'</p>

<p>Jade revealed her mother also had her own struggles with their culture and recently felt 'a lot of trauma' during the Black Lives Matter movement and the war in Yemen.</p>

<p>She said: 'My mam and me have started looking into our culture more and it's something that is bringing us closer together. </p>

<p>'The BLM movement and the war in Yemen has triggered a lot of trauma for my mam, who I think suppressed who she was for a long time, too. The past few months have been very eye-opening for us.'</p>

<p>Despite feeling unable to discuss her heritage during the early days of her career, Jade revealed she is now 'connecting' with herself. </p>

<p>She revealed: 'As an adult I'm connecting more with my Arab side – it's a shame that it's taken me until now to understand that. Being Arab is a beautiful thing.'</p>

<p>'When I was young, my grandad used to play Arabic songs for me, and I think it did influence me… people say they can tell I have Arab heritage because when I do riffs I must subconsciously perform them in an Arabic style, which is lovely.'</p>

<p>Jade, who is from from South Shields in Tyne and Wear, said: 'I think when I then entered the group I subconsciously didn't want to talk about my heritage or what my background was in fear of not being as popular...</p>

<p>'Which sounds awful to say but I was only 18 years old and through years of being ashamed of who I was I found it quite hard to talk about it.</p>

<p>'I think it was through a lack of education as well. Even now I am constantly learning what the right things are to say and I would hate to talk about my race and my heritage and not say the right things.'</p>

<p>Jade also revealed some of the abuse she suffered as a child, and said: 'Where I am from, if you weren't evidently black you were literally put in a bracket of being called the p-word.'</p>

<p>Discussing the topic on the No Country For Young Women podcast, she said: 'I think because I was bullied quite badly in school because of the colour of my skin and for being Arab I wasn't very proud of who I was'</p>

<p>She continued: 'When I was at school if I was ever bullied for the colour of my skin I'd get so confused as I'd be like, well I'm not from Pakistan.</p>

<p>'I remember one time I got pinned down in the toilets and they put a bindi spot on my forehead, it was horrific.' </p>

<p>Jade also told that she struggled to fit in when she joined a mostly white high school, and said: 'When I went to secondary school I was literally one of three people of colour in the school. It was a very predominately white Catholic school.</p>

<p>'I went through a lot in the first two years of secondary school. It was known as a really good school and my mam wanted me to have a really good education.'In hindsight I probably would have just rather gone to school were I would fit in more.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I have constantly had this inner battle of not really having who I am or where I fit in or what community I fit into.</p>

<p>'Some of the things I think about that I can laugh about now are just so crazy. I used to be in an amateur operatic society, they would literally put white powder on my face to whiten me on stage.</p>

<p>'Even now me and my mum will talk about it and we'll be like, 'That was f****** mental'.'We never really understood what was going on at the time.' </p>
