<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wolves are close to completing the £35million signing of Barcelona right-back Nelson Semedo, according to reports.</p>

<p>Nuno Espirito Santo has been searching for a replacement for Matt Doherty following his departure to Tottenham and sees Semedo as the ideal candidate, according to Fabrizio Romano for the Guardian.</p>

<p>The Portugal international is deemed surplus to requirements at the Catalan club as new manager Ronald Koeman tries to overhaul the squad after a traumatic season and summer.</p>

<p>Wolves are reportedly close to agreeing the £35m transfer of Nelson Semedo from Barcelona</p>

<p>Nuno Espirito appears to have found his replacement for Matt Doherty who left for Tottenham</p>

<p>The report indicates Barca are holding out for £36m but there is confidence from all sides that the deal will be completed.</p>

<p>A further tweet from the sports journalist indicates the 26-year-old will sign a five-year deal with the Midlands club and will undergo a medical next week.</p>

<p>Semedo has made 124 appearances for Barcelona since signing in 2017 but was one of several players criticised in a rare trophyless season at the Nou Camp which culminated in a dismal 8-2 drubbing by Bayern Munich.</p>

<p>Should the deal go through, it will be Wolves' fifth major signing of the summer after bringing in Fabio Silva, Fernando Marcal, Vitor Ferreira and Ki-Jana Hoever. </p>

<p>Wolves have already confirmed the signing of Ki-Jana Hoever from Liverpool this weekend</p>

<p>Versatile forward Diogo Jota also completed a £41m move to Liverpool on Saturday. </p>

<p>Koeman appears to have secured another outgoing as Aturo Vidal is reportedly set to sign a two-year contract with Inter Milan for less than £1m, according to the same report.</p>
