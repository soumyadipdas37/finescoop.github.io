<p>Chelsea have agreed a deal worth up to £25million with Rennes for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy</p>

<p>The 28-year-old Senegal international will become Frank Lampard's eighth summer signing</p>

<p>The previous record fee for a goalkeeper moving from France to England was the £12.3m Chelsea paid to Rennes in 2004 for Petr Cech, who is now Chelsea's technical director and played a key role in Mendy's selection.</p>

<p>Chelsea conceded 54 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and manager Frank Lampard wants Mendy to help eradicate such a poor record. </p>

<p>He will be aided by the additions of Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell while Lampard would also like to sign a defensive midfielder.</p>

<p>West Ham's Declan Rice is their prime target but their London rivals have no wish to sell.</p>
