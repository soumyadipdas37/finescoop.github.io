<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Allan's switch to Everton drew ever closer on Wednesday afternoon as the Brazilian midfielder was pictured arriving in Liverpool on a private jet.</p>

<p>The Napoli midfielder was seen exiting the aircraft with his wife Thais Marques and the pair were collected by a member of club staff.  </p>

<p>He travelled to Liverpool to undergo a medical with Everton ahead of sealing a £21million switch, which will see him reunite with Carlo Ancelotti.  </p>

<p>The pair worked together during Ancelotti's tenure in Naples and the Italian made Allan a primary target as he looks to refresh Everton's midfield on the eve of the new Premier League season. </p>

<p>Allan, a Brazil international, adds international pedigree as well as Champions League experience to Everton's group.</p>

<p>He has been at Napoli since 2015 and has made 212 appearances in all competitions for the Italian side. </p>

<p> Allan has established himself as a reliable midfielder in Serie A, winning the Coppa Italia</p>

<p>Allan was part of the side that won last season's Coppa Italia, as Genarro Gattuso's side beat Serie A champions Juventus on penalties in the final.</p>

<p>His exit from Napoli was expected last year when Paris Saint-Germain declared their interest but with Ancelotti in charge, Allan stayed in Naples. </p>

<p>Now the pair appear ready to renew acquaintances in England.  </p>

<p>Allan is the first piece in what could be a busy rebuilding summer for Ancelotti in midfield and attack.  </p>

<p>The Italian boss is also keen to reunite with another of his former players in the shape of James Rodriguez.   </p>

<p>The Colombian is out of favour at Real Madrid with Zinedine Zidane and Ancelotti looks ready to offer him a rout out. </p>

<p>Rodriguez, who joined Real Madrid in 2014 from Monaco, has struggled to convince at the Bernabeu, having been sent out on loan for two seasons to Bayern Munich in 2017. </p>

<p>Despite being handed chances to impress by Zinedine Zidane, it is now clear his future remains away from the LaLiga champions, and Goodison Park could prove his next destination. </p>
