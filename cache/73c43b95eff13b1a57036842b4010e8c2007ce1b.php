<p>Bluebird Merchant Ventures reopens old gold mines. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange's main market.</p>

<p>What's the latest?</p>

<p>It is in the process of buying 100 per cent of its projects in South Korea from joint venture partner Southern Gold. This week it said there is local support to restart a Philippines project.</p>

<p>Who backs it?</p>

<p>Management and other individuals own more than a third of the stock. Boss Colin Patterson is the largest shareholder with 17 per cent. Harwood Capital is also a backer.</p>

<p>Why should you invest?</p>

<p>John Meyer, mining analyst at SP Angel, says: 'Reopening old mines is generally seen as a lower-cost route into mining, so Bluebird should have relatively low capital costs and certainly have very low corporate costs.'</p>

<p>And why shouldn't you?</p>

<p>But, he adds: 'This is definitely a stock at the higher-risk end of the spectrum â€“ if they do what they say they're going to do then it will be very good.</p>

<p>'There is also an element of risk for any company that needs to get permits for their work until they are secured.'</p>
