<p>All of the bachelorettes bid farewell to Locky in Sydney and returned to their hometowns, but instead of sitting around and waiting to do Zoom calls with the hunky Survivor star, Irena was on the frontline fighting the virus.</p>

<p>'Hearing about the what was happening in the world was heartbreaking, especially being a nurse,' she told New Idea. </p>

<p>'My heart was torn - a part of me was selfishly devastated that the show was stopping, but then the other half of me was so eager to get back home and fight COVID.'</p>

<p>'It was hard saying goodbye to Locky and the girls, but also so rewarding that I could do my part to help out with the pandemic,' she added.</p>
