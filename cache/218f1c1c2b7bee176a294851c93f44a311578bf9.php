<p>MAY AT 10</p>

<p>by Anthony Seldon (Biteback £12.99, 736 pp)</p>

<p>'Assessing the performance of a prime minister is a very inexact science,' writes Anthony Seldon. </p>

<p>But as the author of five books on modern prime ministers, he is well placed to consider what history should make of Theresa May's premiership.</p>

<p>When Mrs May became prime minister in 2016, her overriding mission was to take Britain out of the European Union. </p>

<p>But it became clear that she was painfully unsuited to the task. </p>

<p>Hardworking, with a keen sense of duty, she was also shy, inflexible and unable to charm fellow world leaders, voters or even her own MPs.</p>

<p>TALL TALES AND WEE STORIES </p>

<p>by Billy Connolly (John Murray Press £8.99, 336 pp)</p>

<p>'I love losing my way,' writes Billy Connolly. 'I love wandering off down long and winding streets, turning corners and seeing what's there. And I love getting lost in my stories for the same reason.'</p>

<p>While he was performing live, Billy was reluctant to publish his routines in book form but believes 'this feels like the right moment to put these stories down, once and for all.'</p>

<p>The sound of those inimitable Glaswegian tones, fulminating against 'beige people, intent on turning the world into one great massive bore', echo from every page.</p>

<p>Bracingly sweary, robustly rude and brilliantly original, this is essential reading for fans of the Big Yin. </p>
