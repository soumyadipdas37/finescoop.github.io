<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Three sisters who allege they were sexually abused by their female school principal feel like they can 'breathe again' after a six-year extradition battle. </p>

<p>An Israeli court on Monday approved the extradition of the former teacher to Australia, potentially paving the way for her to stand trial on 74 charges of child sex abuse. </p>

<p>Malka Leifer, a former educator who is accused of sexually abusing several former students, has been fighting extradition from Israel since 2014.</p>

<p>She returned to her place of birth in 2008 after accusations of sexual misconduct surfaced. </p>

<p>Leifer has always maintained her innocence. </p>

<p>The decision to grant the extradition brings an end to strained relations between Israel and Australia, and is a relief to the alleged victims. </p>

<p>Child sexual abuse victims Nicole Meyer and Dassi Erlich have been campaigning for Leifer's extradition</p>

<p>Nicole Meyer, 35, told The Australian it felt like 'we can all breathe again' after learning the news on Monday. </p>

<p>'It's a huge validation for us and the many other victims of sexual abuse. Between us, there's many years of pent-up breath and to be able to exhale is a huge relief,' she said. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Israel's Supreme Court ruled that Leifer was mentally fit to stand trial to 'put an end to the saga that has been drawn out for many years'. </p>

<p>The mother-of-eight initially tried to claim that she was too unwell to face court, and the legal battle has been a drawn out and exhausting process for all involved.</p>

<p>An Israeli psychiatric panel determined Leifer had lied about suffering a mental condition that made her unfit to stand trial. </p>

<p>Critics, including Leifer's alleged victims, have accused Israeli authorities of dragging out the case for far too long. </p>

<p>Ms Meyer, along with her younger sisters Dassi Erlich, 32, and Elly Sapper, 31, allege Leifer sexually abused them over a four-year period. </p>

<p>They were students at an ultra-Orthodox school in Melbourne where Leifer was the head teacher, and have since claimed there were other victims among the student body. </p>

<p>The trio were together when they learned of the latest update in the Israeli court. </p>

<p>'We can't stop smiling,' Ms Meyer told Nine Network television news, flanked by her sisters.</p>

<p>'There's just so many emotions flooding through us now, like, relief, excitement - we can't believe we finally got here.'  </p>

<p>The formal extradition now requires an order by Israel's justice minister.</p>

<p>Sisters Elly Sapir, Dassi Erlich and Nicole Meyer allege they are victims of their former teacher</p>

<p>Leifer initially claimed she was mentally unfit to stand trial but her extradition has since been approved</p>

<p>Leifer's attorneys said they would appeal an extradition order to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing that it would be a 'political decision'.</p>

<p>'For those who think that this chapter is now closed, I'm sorry, the process will still last quite a few months more,' Nick Kaufman, one of Leifer's defense lawyers said.  </p>

<p>Australian parliament member Josh Burns praised the court ruling on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>'Justice has taken far too long. But finally, justice has won the day,' Burns said. </p>

<p>'And while we await further appeals, we call on the Israeli judicial system to deal with them as quickly as possible and for the justice minister to give the extradition the final sign off without any further delays.'</p>

<p>Manny Waks, the head of Kol v'Oz, a Jewish group that combats child sex abuse and that has been representing the three sisters, said Monday's ruling marked 'a great day for justice.'</p>

<p>'It is a day which at times seemed like it would never arrive, but we are thrilled that it is finally here,' Waks said.</p>

<p>'It has taken 71 court hearings to get to this point. It has been Israel's shame.'</p>
