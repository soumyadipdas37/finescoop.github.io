<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A small AFL club in a country town with zero COVID-19 cases could be forced to cancel their grand final because of a 'frustrating' COVID-19 restriction. </p>

<p>The Gunnedah and District Bulldogs Football Club may have to move their September 26 event to another town - hours away - if it cannot erect a six-foot-high, 500 metre long fence and implement a 500-attendee cap for the day.</p>

<p>The not-for-profit organisation would be thousands of dollars out-of-pocket if they were forced to put the barrier up, despite the game being held at 'a park in the middle of town'.</p>

<p>This year's AFL Grand Final will be played at Brisbane's Gabba on October 24 in front of a packed 30,000 stadium. </p>

<p>The Gunnedah and District Bulldogs Football Club in Gunnedah could be out-of-pocket up to $5,000 to put a fence in place for its September 26 game, despite an expected 30,000 people packing into Brisbane's Gabba (pictured) on October 24 for the AFL grand final</p>

<p>Bulldogs senior coach Doug Meagher (pictured) said the rules enforced for larger clubs in cities and COVID-19 hotspots should not apply to smaller, country organisations in areas with zero coronavirus cases</p>

<p>Bulldogs senior coach Doug Meagher said the rules enforced for larger clubs in cities and COVID-19 hotspots should not apply to smaller organisations in country areas with zero coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>The harsh rules could see the club affected financially - taking away from its unpaid players and coaches - or the game being moved up to two-and-a-half hours away. </p>

<p>'If we can't meet the current COVID regulation, we'd have to forfeit the right to host the grand final and it may need to be moved to Tamworth or Inverell,' he said. </p>

<p>'It's wrong because if either team hasn't finished top, we shouldn't have to play there.</p>

<p>'We should be playing on home soil.' </p>

<p>The event this year will be the fourth grand final the Bulldogs are playing in, and their sights are set on a third premiership.</p>

<p>'We'll be having three teams playing in the grand final - under 14s, senior womens and senior mens. It is a first for our club,' Mr  Meagher said.</p>

<p>'We did not have juniors or womens last year, and its actually the first year of existence for the womens team at our club so its a big deal. </p>

<p>'They've done really well and it would be great to see how they do here.'</p>

<p>Gunnedah AFL Club President Hamish Russell said there was 'no chance of 500 people turning up' on the day.</p>

<p>Harsh restrictions could affect the Gunnedah and District Bulldogs Football Club financially - taking away from its unpaid players and coaches (pictured) - or the game being moved up to two-and-a-half hours away</p>

<p>The not-for-profit organisation could be out-of-pocket up to $5,000 to put it in place, despite the grand final being held at Wolseley Oval (pictured)  - 'a park in the middle of town'</p>

<p>The club is expected to host eight teams from towns including Moree, Armidale and Glen Innes. </p>

<p>'We're just a simple bush footy club in a small town. Not-for-profit, run by volunteers. We turn up, play footy and keep it simple,' he told 3AW on Friday.</p>

<p>'I'm so frustrated by this and by the COVID-19 restrictions.'</p>

<p>Mr Meagher, however, said there was a possibility the game could attract a crowd of 500, with the players, coaches and volunteers taking out half the amount.</p>

<p>But Gunnedah not being Sydney and 'totally COVID-19 free ... from Moree to Inverell' was the reason Mr Meagher believed the rules should be relaxed.</p>

<p>'We're playing in a park in the middle of town,' he said. 'We are not Sydney and we haven't had a coronavirus case for months.'</p>

<p>Mr Meagher added the club was looking for sponsors to help pay for the fencing if the club was not eligible for an exemption or the game could not be moved. </p>

<p>The Gunnedah and District Bulldogs Football Club grand final will be held at at the Wolseley Oval, Gunnedah, from 9.15am on September 26. </p>
