<p>Van de Beek is set to join from boyhood club Ajax imminently - in what will be United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first signing of the summer.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old has agreed a five-year contract around £107,000-a-week before bonuses.</p>

<p>Donny van de Beek has been warned about the pressures at Man United by Robin van Persie</p>

<p>Van de Beek is set to join United imminently in a £40m transfer from boyhood club Ajax</p>

<p>Van Persie says the Premier League is a 'completely different world' to the Dutch Eredivisie</p>

<p>While Van Persie - who was the catalyst for the Red Devils' 2012-13 title - is delighted for his Dutch compatriot, he has warned Van de Beek that the Premier League is a 'completely different world' to the Eredivisie and that his hefty price tag won't count for much inside the United dressing room.</p>

<p>'Donny van de Beek is 23-years-old and that is a nice age to make a transfer to the Premier League,' Van Persie wrote in his column for De Telegraaf.</p>

<p>'I was a bit younger when I went to Arsenal, and in the locker room, I was considered a player for the future. Winning the UEFA Cup with Feyenoord meant nothing. The Premier League is a completely different world.</p>

<p>'Donny will be brought in as a major purchase from Manchester United, but he will discover that those other 22 players have also been brought in as a "major purchase". One had an even bigger transfer than the other.</p>

<p>'It means that he has to stand there right away and he has to mentally adjust to that. Because Manchester United is in every way a beast of a club.'</p>

<p>Van Persie was the catalyst for the Red Devils' Premier League title win during the 2012-13 term</p>
