<p>PC Andrew Harper's grieving widow Lissie Harper has revealed she still sleeps with his ashes in a wooden box in her bedroom and doesn't know if she will ever be able to love anyone else again.    </p>

<p>Lissie, now 29, had been married to Andrew, 28, a Thames Valley police officer, for just four weeks when he was killed by a gang of three teenage thieves in August last year.  </p>

<p>One year on, she says that she has dreams where her husband is still alive and has written him 'loads of letters' which helps her deal with the grief. </p>

<p>Teenage sweethearts, the couple had been together for twelve years when they married in Oxfordshire in the summer of 2019. </p>

<p>Just four weeks later Lissie was woken up by a knock on her front door to the news that her husband was dead.</p>

<p>The brave police officer had been killed by a gang of three teenagers in a speeding getaway car, who dragged him for more than a mile on country roads.  </p>

<p>PC Andrew Harper, a 28-year-old newlywed who was a traffic officer for Thames Valley Police, was killed horrifically on August 15 last year</p>

<p>Pictured here on their wedding day in Oxfordshire in July 2019, the couple were just weeks into their marriage when Andrew was killed</p>

<p>In an emotional interview with the Sunday Mirror, Lissie said the hardest moment was collecting Andrew's ashes, which made her realise that her sweetheart was really dead. </p>

<p>But even after a year she hasn't yet been able to bring herself to scatter his ashes.  </p>

<p>'I've kept his ashes and they're in a wooden box in my bedroom where I can see them,' she said.</p>

<p>The pain of her loss is still incredibly raw and Lissie said she still talks to Andrew and can hear him 'reassuring' her and telling her not to worry. </p>

<p>Lissie said she hasn't been able to watch their wedding video back yet and said that 'everything reminds me of him'</p>

<p>'I still have dreams where Andrew is there and I've written loads of letters to him, which is something quite healing for me,' she said. </p>

<p>'On days like anniversaries, I still speak to him like I tell him things like 'missing you'. </p>

<p>'I can hear him reassuring me and telling me not to worry, just like he always would.' </p>

<p>However, Lissie said she hasn't been able to watch their wedding video back yet and said that 'everything reminds me of him'. </p>

<p>'I don't know if I'll ever be able to love anyone else again,' she said.  </p>

<p>'It's not something I can consider or think about because Andrew was one of a kind. He's a huge part of me and always will be.'</p>

<p>She told The Daily Mail last month that the young couple had been planning to try for a baby after their honeymoon to the Maldives in September - which Lissie had to cancel after Andrew's death.   </p>

<p>'Andrew would have been a great dad and having a family with him is one of the many things his killers have taken from me,' she said.  </p>

<p>'I miss everything about him — the hugs, the kisses, him coming in and scooping me up, giving me love. It's crippling.'</p>

<p>This week, Lissie met with Secretary of State Priti Patel on September 2 after launching her Harper's Law campaign. </p>

<p>The campaign would ensure a minimum life sentence for criminals convicted of killing an emergency services worker.   </p>
