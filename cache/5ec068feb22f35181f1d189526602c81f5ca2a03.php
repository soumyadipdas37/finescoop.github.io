<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A young woman who accused a police officer of breaking her arm during a routine arrest is suing for damages.</p>

<p>Madison Holt, 22, claims she was dragged from a home in Taranganba, west of Rockhampton in Queensland, to be questioned over a stolen cell phone in February 2019.</p>

<p>She claimed she was being restrained by detective Alex Nesic Detective Sergeant Craig Strohfeldt when Nesic allegedly punched the top of her left arm. </p>

<p>She alleged she heard a 'loud cracking noise' and began yelling that her arm was broken.</p>

<p>In a claim filed in Brisbane District Court, Ms Holt alleged police used unreasonable force during the arrest because they didn't have reasonable grounds to suspect she had broken the law, the Courier Mail reported.</p>
