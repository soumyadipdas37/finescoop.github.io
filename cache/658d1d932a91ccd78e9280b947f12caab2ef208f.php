<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Texas fugitive who fled into the woods in Georgia after allegedly shooting at a deputy who pulled him over has been captured following a nearly three-day manhunt.</p>

<p>The Georgia Bureau of Investigation tweeted that Dalton Potter was in custody after authorities surrounded him late Wednesday following another shooting outside the town of Resaca. In that shooting, authorities said Potter opened fire on a man on his property and the man fired back.</p>

<p>Whitfield County Sheriff Scott Chitwood had told reporters Wednesday that investigators had surrounded Potter, 29, northwest of the town.</p>

<p>'We probably have over 100 officers, we´ve set up a strong perimeter, we still have the [Georgia State Patrol] helicopter in the air, we've got K-9s on the ground tracking in the woods,' Chitwood said, noting that it was getting dark outside.</p>

<p>Caught: Texas fugitive Dalton Potter, 29 (left), wanted for the shooting of Whitfield County Sheriff's Deputy Darrell Hackney (right), was captured on Wednesday evening</p>

<p>Chitwood said the civilian who was shot was hospitalized in stable condition.</p>

<p>Noah Cloer identified his father, Eddie Cloer, as the victim. He was feeding animals in his yard in Gordon County in the afternoon when Potter attacked, shooting him in the arm and grazing his head, Noah Cloer told WTVC. Eddie Cloer was able to fire back and Potter fled, his son said.</p>

<p>Several hours later, Sheriff Chitwood said that officers came upon Potter on a road inside Gordon County and jumped him, reported WDEF. </p>

<p>Prior to his captures, officials say Potter exchanged fire with homeowner Eddie Cloer (pictured), who suffered injuries to his arm and head </p>

<p>The Senior Inspector of the US Marshals Office who made the arrest said Potter was about 250 yards into the woods, sitting under a tree behind a home and nursing a head injury.</p>

<p>Resaca, where Clower was shot, is about 16 miles from the city of Dalton, where investigators said Potter fired multiple shots at Whitfield County Sheriff's Deputy Darrell Hackney around midnight Monday morning during a traffic stop.</p>

<p>Hackney was struck, but his ballistic vest saved him, the GBI said. Hackney and another deputy returned fire, but Potter drove away south on Interstate 75. He wrecked the truck and escaped into the woods on foot, the GBI said.</p>

<p>The GBI also revealed Wednesday that Potter was hauling explosives in a stolen trailer that was found along the southbound lanes of I-75, near the Whitfield-Gordon county line. The GBI's bomb disposal unit will get rid of the explosives, the agency said.</p>

<p>Potter, from Leakey, Texas, was wanted in Georgia on five counts of aggravated assault, and on Texas charges of larceny and theft of more than $2,500.</p>

<p>Authorities in Georgia released bodycam footage from a traffic stop on the southbound Interstate 75 highway before dawn on Monday</p>

<p>When a Whitfield County Sheriff's deputy approached the driver's side window, he asked the driver, who has been identified as Dalton Lee Potter, 29, for his identification</p>

<p>Potter is then seen flashing a gun. The sheriff's deputy is knocked backward and the video footage is cut off</p>

<p>A second Texas man, Jonathan Hosmer, 47, was arrested at 5am on Tuesday at a location given to law enforcement by an anonymous tipster, after surveillance video recorded him leaving the truck crash. </p>

<p>Also wanted in Texas on larceny and theft charges, he's charged in Georgia with possession of methamphetamine, bringing stolen property into the state, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</p>

<p>Body camera footage released by Georgia authorities on Tuesday showed the terrifying moment Potter allegedly fired on the deputy before dawn on Monday morning. </p>

<p>In the video, a sheriff’s deputy carrying a flashlight approaches a pickup truck that has a trailer attached to its rear.</p>

<p>When he approaches the driver’s side window, he finds a man wearing glasses and a purple tank top.</p>

<p>The sheriff’s deputy asks the man for ID. Immediately afterward, the man flashes a gun, and the deputy appears to duck. The video ends at this point. </p>

<p>Sheriff Chitwood said the deputy was treated at a hospital and is now at home. </p>

<p>'Thank goodness that his vest protected it,' said Chitwood. </p>

<p>'He was treated and released at the hospital last night. Had a burning sensation, little abrasion, but overall fine, right below the rib cage.'</p>

<p>Investigators told WGXA-TV that Potter is a 'survivalist' who is skilled at surviving in the woods over the course of a long period of time.</p>

<p>According to law enforcement officials, Potter was hauling explosives in the stolen trailer seen in the bodycam video.  </p>

<p>Potter, from Leakey, Texas, was driving a white Chevrolet Tahoe with a stolen trailer behind</p>

<p>On Monday morning Georgia sheriffs issued an alert for Potter, following the shooting</p>

<p>A second wanted Texas fugitive, Jonathan Hosmer, 47, was later identified by the wreck</p>

<p>Hosmer, also from Leakey, Texas, was wanted for burglary of a building. He was taken into custody on Tuesday</p>

<p>Local residents were assisting police, WRCBtv reported.</p>

<p>Chitwood said eyewitness reports have helped them narrow their search, which was filmed by Fox5 Atlanta.</p>

<p>'One of the neighbors gave the description, we felt like it was legitimate, we focused on that area. </p>

<p>'But we've come up with nothing at this point. We did come up with a pack of fresh cigarettes we felt like possibly could be his,' Chitwood added.</p>

<p>It's unclear why Potter came to Georgia.</p>

<p>Helicopters are pictured searching for the two fugitives in Georgia</p>

<p>A manhunt is underway for the two Texans who fled when their vehicle crashed</p>
