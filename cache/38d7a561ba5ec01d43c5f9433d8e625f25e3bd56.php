<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the moment a white woman pulled a handgun on black activists in South Africa as they protested a hair advert that has been deemed racist.</p>

<p>The 52-year-old woman got into a confrontation with far-left activists in a shopping mall in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday, amid nationwide demonstrations against the Clicks chain of pharmacies which broadcast the advert.</p>

<p>One of the demonstrators can be heard shouting 'go back to Europe' at the woman and her companion, as they are escorted out of the mall by five security guards.</p>

<p>At one point, a demonstrator pushes the woman who then pulls a handgun out of her pink jacket and turns around to point it at them. </p>

<p>This is the moment a 52-year-old white woman pulled out a handgun on black activists after they got into a confrontation during a protest against a pharmacy chain in South Africa</p>

<p>Police said three people had to be escorted out of the shopping mall in Port Elizabeth after the argument, with at least two of them placed in handcuffs - though nobody was arrested</p>

<p>A man and a woman can then be heard shouting 'shoot, shoot' as the women are hurried outside by security.</p>

<p>Police told Times Live that three people were removed from the Walmer Park Shopping Centre after an altercation, though did not reveal details.</p>

<p>Officers said the same three people also had to be removed from the car park after a further argument erupted outside.</p>

<p>Pictures show the woman who pulled the gun an a black activist being handcuffed in the car park, though officers say nobody was arrested.</p>

<p>Protesters from the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters political party have been targeting branches of Clicks at malls across South Africa since the weekend, after it shared an advert online that was deemed racist.</p>

<p>The ad, which ran on its website, showed four contrasting images of hair - two images of black women with natural hair, and two images of blonde, white women.</p>

<p>The black women's hair was labelled 'frizzy, dull, dry and damaged' while the white women's hair was called 'fine, flat and normal'.</p>

<p>The argument between the woman (left) and activists (right) comes amid protests across South Africa over a hair advert that was deemed to be racist</p>

<p>The far-left EFF party has called for all stores of pharmacy chain Clicks to be shut down over an advert that branded black women's hair 'dull, frizzy and damaged'</p>

<p>Clicks quickly apologised and pulled the advert from its site, before agreeing to pull all TRESemme hair products - the company which produced the advert - from the shelves and replace them with 'natural' alternatives.</p>

<p>But the EFF accused the company of 'publicly dehumanising black people' and called for its stores to be shut down due to its 'unrepentant and perverse racism.'</p>

<p>The organisation has since sent demonstrators to protest outside stores across the country, in an attempt to keep them closed.</p>

<p>Clicks said that EFF protests have taken place at 37 stores in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Western Cape. </p>

<p>Seven stores have also been targeted by vandals and at least one, on the outskirts of Johannesburg, has been burned - though the EFF has denied responsibility.  </p>

<p>The high court in Johannesburg has issued an order preventing the EFF from intimidating and threatening Clicks' employees or any of its operations.</p>

<p>The order also stopped the party from inciting violence against the company's everyday commercial operations.</p>
