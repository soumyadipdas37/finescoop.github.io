<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The honeymoon period’s over for Frank Lampard. Spending £200million on new recruits has seen to that.</p>

<p>But Lampard is adept at getting over the line, he’s done it his entire career. Here at the Amex Stadium, Chelsea, albeit sluggishly, did what was necessary.</p>

<p>This wasn't as fluent as Lampard would have envisaged, nor was it the dream debut that either Timo Werner or Kai Havertz dreamed of on Monday night.</p>

<p>The Blues right-back lets fly from 25 yards as Frank Lampard's men regain their lead in emphatic fashion on 56 minutes</p>

<p>But a win’s a win. When your at Chelsea, that’s all that matters.</p>

<p>If last season was a ‘free hit’ for Lampard because of the club’s inability to recruit, then Chelsea boss will now be judged by Roman Abramovich’s infamously high standards.</p>

<p>Only success is good enough. Anything below that, well, Lampard knows the consequences.</p>

<p>That won’t catch Lampard by surprise, of course - he helped set those standards. He knows exactly what’s expected.</p>

<p>And while this victory over Brighton was more laboured than lavish, Chelsea’s season has got off to a positive opening.</p>

<p>Jorginho hops and skips in his unique style before stroking the ball beyond Ryan and into the net</p>

<p>The expectations on Graham Potter, of course, are different to Lampard’s but by no means less significant. Retaining their Premier League status remains the ultimate goal for the Seagulls.</p>

<p>But judging by this performance, Brighton will be absolutely fine.</p>

<p>For 20 minutes, Brighton kept Chelsea’s highly-priced debutants at bay. Lewis Dunk supremely marshalled his back five, while fellow central defender Adam Webster was equally impressive.</p>

<p>Brighton were even causing the visitor’s defence problems with their own ventures forward.</p>

<p>Brighton (3-4-1-2): Ryan 5; White 6.5 (Gross 79), Dunk 7, Webster 7; Lamptey 8, Alzate 5 (Jahanbakhsh 79), Bissouma 7, March 6.5; Lallana 6.5 (Connolly 45, 6); Trossard 7, Maupay 6. Subs: Steele, Stephens, Burn, Veltman.</p>

<p>Potter: 6.5</p>

<p>Chelsea (4-3-3): Kepa 5.5; James 7, Zouma 7, Christensen 6.5, Alonso 5.5; Jorginho 7 (Azpilicueta 85), Kante 6.5; Havertz 6 (Hudson-Odoi 80) Loftus-Cheek 6 (Barkley 61), Mount 6.5; Werner 6.5. Subs: Cabellero, Rudiger, Abraham, Giroud.</p>

<p>Lampard: 7</p>

<p>Referee: Craig Pawson - 6.5</p>

<p>dson-Odoi 80), Kanté, Jorginho (Azpilicueta 85), Mount, Loftus-Cheek (Barkley 61), Werner</p>

<p>Subs not used: Rüdiger, Abraham, Caballero, Giroud</p>

<p>Booked: None</p>

<p>Scorers: Jorginho (PEN 23), James (56), Zouma (66)</p>

<p>Referee: Craig Pawson</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Chelsea, in contrast, were stagnant and stale - but then came Steven Alzate’s moment of madness.</p>

<p>The midfielder appeared to have the situation under control; that was until his sloppy pass found Jorginho, whose instant ball played in Werner.</p>

<p>The £45million man looked to ease past Matt Ryan, only to be brought down by the Brighton goalkeeper in the process.</p>

<p>Referee Craig Dawson pointed to the spot - the only complaint Ryan could have was towards team-mate Alzate who’d just left horribly exposed.</p>

<p>Jorginho stepped up to send Ryan the wrong way and hand Chelsea the lead. Lampard turned to his bench with his fists clenched, Alzate on the other hand wanted the ground to swallow him up.</p>

<p>An instant impact from Werner, too, pouncing on the mistake with ruthless assurance.</p>

<p>It was perhaps cruel on Brighton - but they know the drill by now. Mistakes, more often than not, cost you dear.</p>

<p>Kai Havertz made his frist Chelsea start but appeared subdues after suffering a muscular injury in a collision with Mat Ryan</p>

<p>Brighton full-back Tariq Lamptey embarks on a direct run against his former club at the beginning of the second half</p>

<p>Leandro Trossard celebrates with his Brighton team-mates after drawing his team level with a powerful long-range strike</p>

<p>Credit to Potters’ men, though, they were patient and stuck to the gameplan.</p>

<p>Had Neal Maupay not horribly mis-timed a header from the impressive Tariq Lamptey’s cross - or had Kepa Arrizabalaga not produced an outstanding stop to deny Alzate’s long-range effort in the 34th minute then Brighton could easily have levelled before the break.</p>

<p>The first-half ended on a sour note for Brighton as debutant Adam Lallana limped off moments before the break to spark concerns of another spell on the sidelines for the former England international.</p>

<p>It could have been worse for the Seagulls, Ryan producing a instinctive stop to deny Werner’s powerful near-post effort as the German threatened again on the stroke of half-time.</p>

<p>Lampard’s side were ahead but the Chelsea boss would have been far from happy; his team were passive and uninventive.</p>

<p>Seagulls captain Lewis Dunk holds his his head in his hands after failing to pull his team level in the second half</p>

<p>Lewis Dunk missed a glaring opportunity to score Brighton's second goal, but headed wide from close range</p>

<p>Much like the first, Brighton were bursting with intent after restart. Maupay squandered a chance at the near post following Solly March’s cross while Lamptey continued to cause Marcos Alonso all world of problems down the right.</p>

<p>In contrast, Havertz’s subdued debut was encapsulated in the 53rd minute when he pinged a pass into empty space and out for a throw as Chelsea continued to labour.</p>

<p>And two minutes later Brighton got their just desserts. Inevitably, Lamptey was at the heart of it, the diminutive winger standing up Alonso before finding Trossard, who fired past Arrizabalaga from the edge of the box.</p>

<p>Arrizabalaga will be disappointed he couldn't keep it out. Once Lampard sees it again, he will be too.</p>

<p>Zouma's volley from the edge of the area deflected off Adam Webster and past the helpless Mat Ryan to secure three points</p>

<p>Kurt Zouma (second from left) celebrates with team-mates after his deflected effort doubled Chelsea's advantage</p>

<p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard congratulates his players before tapping fists with the officials at full time</p>

<p>The Chelsea manager isn't convinced Arrizabalaga can be his long-term No 1 - his contribution here will do nothing to quell those doubts.</p>

<p>Chelsea, though, through an unlikely source found themselves back in front just 100 seconds later.</p>

<p>When the ball landed at Reece James’ feet fully 25 yards from goal, Brighton’s defenders were probably wishing for the youngster to have a crack.</p>

<p>He obliged, and milliseconds later Chelsea were back in front - James’ thunderous effort whizzing past Ryan.</p>

<p>Potter stood in his technical area with his arms outstretched by his side. But his players simply had no answer to James’ supreme strike.</p>

<p>Yet Brighton came again, Dunk squandering a golden opportunity as he guided his unmarked back-post header wide when it was surely easier to hit the target.</p>

<p>And the Brighton skipper was made to pay for his miss in the 66th minute as Kurt Zouma scored Chelsea’s crucial third when his volley from James corner ricochetted off the unlucky Webster’s leg and past Ryan</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>That concludes tonight's Sportsmail coverage of Brighton vs Chelsea. Thank you for tuning in and see you next time!</p>

<p>Chelsea get the job done in their season opener. Credit to Brighton who fought hard but a crazy few minutes at the AMEX fell in Chelsea's favour.</p>

<p>Jorginho opened the scoring in the first half before Leandro Trossard equalised in the second. Moments later, Reece James scored a thunderbolt and Kurt Zouma sealed all three points with a deflected volley.</p>

<p>Four added minutes.</p>

<p>Coming into the closing few minutes at the AMEX Stadium. Chelsea in complete control and seem to be cruising to their first three points. </p>

<p>Kai Havertz makes way for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Not a fantastic debut, but he put a good shift in. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Aaron Connollyskips past challenges but can't beat Kepa.</p>

<p>Ross Barkley makes a brilliant darting run on the counter attack and sets up Timo Werner in the box. Ben White scurries across and makes the last ditch block.</p>

<p>Chelsea are starting to control this match since they took the two-goal lead. Kai Havertz makes a great recovery run to stop Solly March as Graham Potter prepares an attacking substitution. </p>

<p>GOAL for Chelsea. Kurt Zouma volleys home from a Chelsea corner but was helped by a deflection off Adam Webster.</p>

<p>Some good inter play by Chelsea. Havertz finds James out wide, who then crosses the ball low into Werner who tries an audacious flick. </p>

<p>Should have been the equaliser! Lewis Dunk misses a golden chance unmarked at the back post after a brilliant cross in from a set-piece for the hosts. This match has sparked into life.</p>

<p>EVEN BETTER GOAL! Reece James that is outstanding! An immediate response from the defender, who unleashes a thunderbolt into the top right corner. Simply unstoppable and goal of the weekend.</p>

<p>WHAT A GOAL! It has been coming and it's Leandro Trossard from range. A delightful effort from outside the box. Looking at the replay, Kepa has to do better but take nothing away from the hit.</p>

<p>Beautiful from Tariq Lamptey against his old side. He breezes past Marcos Alonso and mason Mount into the box and smashes a shot goalwards. Kurt Zouma makes the block and is down in pain for his troubles. </p>

<p>Good chance fr Brighton early on. Solly March gets in behind the Chelsea defence and crosses to Aaron Connolly, who hits the sidenetting.</p>

<p>We are back at it on the south coast.</p>

<p>Chelsea enter the break with a 1-0 lead over Brighton thanks to a penalty from Jorginho. </p>

<p>It has been a very evenly-contested match with few chances coming to either side. Brighton have looked comfortable in possession and have posed just as much of a threat as Chelsea have at the other end. Still plenty to play for.</p>

<p>Timo Werner comes close! He dribbles into the Brighton box and pulls the ball over to his left foot. He had options to cross but instead shot towards the near post and Mat Ryan was forced the make a save,</p>

<p>Four minutes added time.</p>

<p>Adam Lallana's debut for Brighton has come to an early end. He is replaced by Aaron Connolly.</p>

<p>Chelsea break through Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Timo Werner makes a blistering run to join in but the England midfielder can't quite find his new team-mate. That was seriously quick from the German to catch up.</p>

<p>Steven Alzate almost draws Brighton level! The midfielder glides through into the final third and unleashes a shot towards goal. Kepa manages to fist it away.</p>

<p>A shaky moment for Kepa! The Chelsea goalkeeper came out to punch a Brighton corner but completely fluffed up his lines. Thankfully for him, no-one was standing behind him waiting to head the ball in.</p>

<p>That was a good chance for Brighton. A delightful cross from Tariq Lamptey finds the head of Neal Maupay. However, the striker does not make a good connection and Kepa Arrizabalaga deals with the danger.</p>

<p>Jorginho scores the penalty! He sends Mat Ryan the wrong way.</p>

<p>PENALTY to Chelsea! Timo Werner is taken out by Mat Ryan.</p>

<p>Chelsea try and create a chance after some good work from Mason Mount. The midfielder battles for the ball and crosses a ball into the box. Timo Werner can only just get his head on it and can't direct it goalwards. </p>

<p>It's been hard-fought at the AMEX so far. Neither side has taken control of the match with the all the battling coming in the midfield. </p>

<p>It's been a positive start from Brighton. They've dominated most of the possession and won plenty of challenges against the visitors. However, they have failed to create a chance yet.</p>

<p>First sight at goal for Chelsea. Reece James plays a ball over the top for Timo Werner to chase, who then fires a low cross into the box but Kai Havertz can't quite get on the end of it. The striker was slightly offside.</p>

<p>We are underway at the AMEX Stadium.</p>

<p>There's just ten minutes left until the final match of the Premier League's opening weekend is underway. Real anticipation and excitement around this Chelsea team, but Brighton are a well-oiled machine under Graham Potter and do pose their own threat with Neal Maupay up front and Adam Lallana </p>

<p>Stay tuned, kick-off is not far away.</p>

<p>The striker will be looking for a fast start following his £54million move to the Premier League. He scored 28 goals and got eight assists from 34 Bundesliga matches last season. Watch this space.</p>

<p>Attacking midfielder Adam Lallana will make his Premier League debut for Brighton tonight against a tough Chelsea team. He joined the South coast side from champions Liverpool earlier this summer.</p>

<p>Brighton's AMEX Stadium is looking beautiful under the evening sky. There's just one thing missed... the fans packing into the concourse.</p>

<p>Chelsea's new boys Kai Havertz and Timo Werner are both starting for the Blues tonight. Meanwhile, new signings Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Hakim Ziyech are not in the squad for various reasons. </p>
