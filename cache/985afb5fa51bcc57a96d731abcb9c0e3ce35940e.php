<p>POST-MENOPAUSE BOOST</p>

<p>I feel better now than at 50, as I’ve come through the menopause. When it started, at 48, I had the sweats, sleepless nights and a fogged mind. I thought I was going crazy, until I saw my gynaecologist. I didn’t want HRT and found a natural solution, Red Clover Isoflavones by Complete Woman (£16, boots.com); the tablets contain plant extracts that mimic the effects of oestrogen. My sleep improved a lot within months. Plus, I cut down on alcohol, caffeine and sugar, which helped with hot flushes.</p>

<p>TREAT YOUR SKIN</p>

<p>Each month, I get a non-invasive CACI facial (£75, thebeautybaressex.com). I also buy good-quality skincare. Last month, I bought La Prairie Anti-Aging Day Cream SPF 30 and Night Cream (£203 each, harrods.com); plus Cellular-3-Minute Peel (£200) and my skin feels radiant. I alternate these with L’Oréal versions, to save money.</p>

<p>MIDLIFE MODELLING</p>

<p>I’ve been an interior designer for 40 years. But, two years ago, an agency messaged me on Instagram, to ask if I’d ever considered modelling. Since then, I’ve been doing it part-time. I’m often told my hair is thick and long for my age. I use OGX Thick &amp; Full Biotin &amp; Collagen shampoo and conditioner (£6.99 each, boots.com).</p>

<p>PRO PESCATARIAN</p>

<p>I have given up red meat and chicken and now eat only fish, which has made my skin glow. I also take supplements: Lamberts Curcumin Ultra Turmeric Extract (from £19.95, lambertshealthcare.co.uk) to help with joint pain; Solgar Formula Multivitamins (£26.99) for energy; and Solgar Calcium Magnesium Plus Zinc tablets (£7.79, both hollandand barrett.com) for healthy bones.</p>

<p>ENERGISING REGIME</p>

<p>Each morning, I meditate for 15 minutes at dawn before a workout: yoga, Pilates, salsa, weights or body conditioning — with a virtual personal trainer at a cost of just £5 a week.</p>
