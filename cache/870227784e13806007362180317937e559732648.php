<p>Biden named California Sen. Harris as his running mate last month, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket. </p>

<p>The 55-year-old first-term senator, who is also of South Asian descent, is one of the party's most prominent figures. She quickly became a top contender for the No. 2 spot after her own White House campaign ended.  </p>

<p>Trump, who had donated to her previous campaigns, argued she was 'about the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate.'</p>

<p>'I would have thought that Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit,' he said. </p>

<p>Harris had been talking to small business owners in Arizona when she made the gaffe, appearing to suggest she was top of the ticket.  </p>

<p>Trump has previously said Biden is 'a puppet of Bernie Sanders, AOC and the radical left'.  He has also frequently questioned Biden's cognitive abilities, challenged him to take a cognitive test and has called himself a 'very stable genius.' </p>

<p>In one of his favorite riffs to supporters at his campaign rallies, Trump pretends to be a lost Joe Biden trying to figure out what state he is in. </p>

<p>In May Biden referred to himself as a 'transition candidate'. But in August he said he will ‘absolutely’ serve two terms if elected president. </p>

<p>Harry Reid, the Democratic former Senate majority leader, told The New York Times: 'Joe being 77, I think people are going to look to see who is the person who could be the next president. </p>

<p>Former Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota said of the VP nomination: 'This is really auditioning to be the next leader of the Democratic Party.'</p>

<p>Harris' slip up caused some online to suggest she had accidentally revealed the Democrat's plans for her to be in charge</p>

<p>In August Jill Biden was forced to defend her husband. </p>

<p>'I see Joe every single day. He's writing speeches. He's being briefed, making phone calls, he's doing zoom constantly, he's doing fundraisers. We go from nine in the morning till, gosh, 10, 11 at night I don't see any of that,' she said on ABC's 'Good Morning America.'</p>

<p>'I mean, Joe is totally engaged and you know Joe, I mean he just, he loves it. He's the, I guess, consummate politician,' she added.</p>

<p>She told NBC's Today show the attacks were 'ridiculous.'  </p>
