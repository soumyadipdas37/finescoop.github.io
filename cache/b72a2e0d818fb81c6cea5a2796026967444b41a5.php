<p>This is the moment rescuers pull a man and his daughter onto a boat after the man attempted to commit suicide and drown his daughter in a river following a family row.</p>

<p>The harrowing scene unfolded in Qingjiang township of Yueqing, Zhejiang province yesterday.</p>

<p>The man who was identified only as Mr Wang, started walking into a river with his daughter to commit suicide after a family dispute on Saturday.</p>

<p>Rescue: Rescuers pull a man, fourth right and a girl, centre, onto a boat after the man attempted to commit suicide with his daughter</p>

<p>However, police and rescuers managed to save them both and no one was injured during the incident according to local media.</p>

<p>Two boats with four men can be seen surrounding the distraught father and his child as they grab him by his neck to haul him out of the river and into the boat.</p>

<p>But as the rescue unfolds, Mr Wang appears to fight back as the men try to pull him into the boat and he can be seen grimacing as the men struggle to lift his body weight.</p>

<p>As they stage their daring rescue, the boat begins to dip into the water from the weight of Mr Wang being pulled on board.</p>

<p>One of the rescuers can be seen on the left hand side in a long coat, holding an oar steady as he watches the rescue unfold from his wooden green and red boat.</p>

<p>The little girl, whose name and age are unknown, is held tightly by a man in a purple coat as she is rescued from the river.</p>

<p>Her rescuer clutches hold of an oar, perhaps to steady himself as he looks down at the little girl to make sure she is alright.</p>

<p>The men all appear to be wearing their everyday clothes, but two of the rescuers have managed to put on inflatable orange life vests for the rescue.</p>

<p>One man looks as though his grey shirt has become soaked through with water as he helps out with the rescue.</p>

<p>It is not known why Mr Wang took such drastic measures to end his life alongside his daughter - aside from reports about the family argument.</p>

<p>But he and his daughter are thought to be safe, according to local media reports.</p>
