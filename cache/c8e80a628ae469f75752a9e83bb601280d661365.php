<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bizarre poem written by Dennis Nilsen in which he describes the smell of condoms has been revealed in a recently-unearthed letter to a penfriend. </p>

<p>Nilsen wrote to the unnamed man from HMP Full Sutton, in Yorkshire, where he served the latter part of his full life sentence for the murder of at least 12 young men and boys between 1978 and 1983. </p>

<p>The penfriend, who has not been named, has made the 2009 letters he received from Nilsen public for the first time following the release of ITV drama Des, which told the story of the serial killer's arrest and prosecution. </p>

<p>One of the two letters contains a bizarre poem in which Nilsen describes the scent of condoms. They also include references to being censored by the prison guards. </p>

<p>Nilsen wrote to the unnamed man from HMP Full Sutton, in Yorkshire, where he served the latter part of his full life sentence for the murder of at least 12 young men and boys between 1978 and 1983 </p>

<p>One of the letters, pictured, contains a bizarre poem in which Nilsen describes the scent of condoms </p>

<p>Nilsen also ranted against authority, inequality, the Afghanistan and Iraq wars in angry rants written from prison.</p>

<p>The strangest part of the letters was a bizarre and unsettling poem Nilsen penned about contraception.</p>

<p>He wrote: 'The amorous lumber of thin, necessary, latex/ Stripped from the packet, concealed in one’s jacket/ As substantial as a whiff of pink vapour/ Settling on the shimmering rum of doubt/ The line between fact and fiction/ Before the truth will out.'</p>

<p>The amorous</p>

<p>lumber of </p>

<p>thin, necessary, latex</p>

<p>Stripped from the packet</p>

<p>Concealed in one’s jacket</p>

<p>As substantial as </p>

<p>A whiff of pink vapour</p>

<p>Settling on the </p>

<p>Shimmering rum of doubt</p>

<p>The line between </p>

<p>Fact and fiction</p>

<p>Before the truth will out. </p>

<p>The poem is a hint at Nilsen’s sadistic deviant fantasies. The serial killer would perform solo sex acts in front of his victim's dead bodies.</p>

<p>Nilsen was corresponding with a British man who has written letters to politicians, footballers as well as long-serving lags. The unnamed man - who is revealing the letters for the first time - said: 'Nilsen wrote his letters like lectures.</p>

<p>'He liked to throw in long words, however they didn’t always make sense. He came across as arrogant.'</p>

<p>The bizarre ramblings showed Nilsen’s addled world view, which could have helped drive him to kill.</p>

<p>The psychopath wrote: 'I suppose that, like many other people in society, you believe that the ruling authority is intelligent, wise and cognitively well intentioned.</p>

<p>'Despite the fact that our "moral betters" have gotten us into two aggressively invasive wars, presided over a fracturing of society (with its inordinate gap between rich and poor), and ruined the financial/economic system of Global proportions?'  </p>

<p>In 2009, he wrote several letters which show his twisted worldview.</p>

<p>In his strange ranting - written using a typewriter on sharp yellow paper - the psychopath revealed his strange conspiracy theories which may have driven him to murder.  </p>

<p>In a letter dated to 6 March 2009, the serial killer rambled on about a conspiracy against him in prison </p>

<p>In the letters, he said: 'Apart from the banks and the economy there is, apparently, still room for additional rottenness in what is called "the system".</p>

<p>'Little things engage the full attention of little mind with all the really big and massive problems escaping their attention.'</p>

<p>The serial killer also went on a bizarre rant about the Prison Service blocking his autobiography, poetry and music.</p>

<p>The penfriend, who has not been named, has made the 2009 letters he received from Nilsen public for the first time following the release of ITV drama Des, which told the story of the serial killer's arrest and prosecution. Pictured, David Tennant as Nilsen in Des</p>

<p>He said: 'Over the years the Prison Service has much-interfered with my correspondence coming in or out of prison.</p>

<p>'My autobiographies are banned, and anthology of my poetry and tapes of my musical compositions were banned.</p>

<p>'The censorious beast of the mindless and brainless penal machine (devotedly assisted by its faithful priests, both high and low), continue to censor me at every chance they get. And it doesn’t take much to set them off.' </p>
