<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle might want to keep away from her TV screen this autumn because she has two exes competing on two major dance shows. </p>

<p>It was announced on Wednesday morning that her ex, American NFL star Jason Bell, 42, will compete in UK show, Strictly Come Dancing. </p>

<p>But hours later, Desperate Housewives star, Jesse Metcalfe, 41, was announced as a contestant on the version of the show, Dancing With The Stars.</p>

<p>What are the Cha-Cha-chances? Nadine Coyle's TWO exes Jason Bell (pictured in 2018) and Jesse Metcalfe are BOTH revealed to be competing in Strictly and DWTS</p>

<p>Nadine, 35, herself has never appeared on Strictly, opting to go on rival ITV show, I'm A Celebrity in 2019, coming in fifth place. </p>

<p>The Irish singer is still on very friendly terms with her ex-fiancé Jason who she dated for 11 years. The couple are parents to daughter Anaíya, six. </p>

<p>The couple met when Nadine was living in Los Angeles and running her own Irish bar in Sunset Beach called Nadine's Irish Mist. </p>

<p>All over: Nadine also dated Jesse Metcalfe in 2006 for about a year and he even got a tattoo of the brunette beauty inked on his shoulder, (pictured in 2006) </p>

<p>Nadine previously told The Sun: 'I got with Jason when I was 23 and [got] engaged, and I suddenly thought: "Hang on. I can’t get married, I’m only 25!"</p>

<p>'I needed to take a wee bit of time out. So I moved to New York."</p>

<p>But they later got back together and Jason in proposed once more in 2014 shortly after their daughter was born, but it was not meant to be.     </p>

<p>Nadine later told The Sun: 'A baby adds more stress to a relationship – you’re up all night and it really is a test. Everything changes. </p>

<p>A reminder: Nadine also dated Jesse in 2006 for about a year and he even got a tattoo of the brunette beauty inked on his shoulder</p>

<p>'You can’t just go for lunch or dinner or a drink. That goes out the window, and you’re dealing with the serious stuff.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jason has said that his daughter couldn't wait to see him on the dancefloor. </p>

<p>He said: 'Strictly is the epitome of British television and this year, more than ever, I’m so proud and humbled to be participating.</p>

<p>'Strictly was the first show I ever watched when I moved to the UK and I’m a massive fan.</p>

<p>'My six-year-old daughter never got the chance to see me run out on the field at an NFL game but she is very excited about me taking to the dance floor. I hope I can do her proud.'</p>

<p>Nadine also dated Jesse in 2006 for about a year and he even got a tattoo of the brunette beauty inked on his shoulder.  </p>

<p>He said on an episode of LA Ink: ‘I had the idea of a female angel lassoing a human heart to my heart. </p>

<p>'It’s not that I’m not over the break-up, it’s just that I really wanted to remember what it felt like to be in that relationship so that I never really go there again.’ </p>
