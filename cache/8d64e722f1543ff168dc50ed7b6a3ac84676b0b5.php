<p>British beauty expert Elsa McAlonan reveals how to get the feline flick look</p>

<p>There's no escaping the feline flick trend this autumn, but the good news is that the newest fine eyeliners make the look simpler than ever to perfect.</p>

<p>Easiest on the eyes is Milk's Kush Liquid Eyeliner (£20, selfridges.com) with cannabis seed oil, which helps the felt-tip glide along the delicate lash line.</p>

<p>IS TAP WATER AGEING MY SKIN? </p>

<p>Yes, the nature of the water supply where you live could determine how well your skin ages.</p>

<p>'Hard water increases transepidermal water loss and forms a residue on the skin's surface,' says dermatologist Dr Vikram Rajkomar, of Pall Mall Medical. </p>

<p>'This has the effect of drying the skin.'</p>

<p>A reader asks if tap water is ageing their skin. Elsa says that yes, the water supply in your area could determine how your skin ages. Pictured: the new Liz Earle Hydrating Cream Mask (£20, john lewis.com) is formulated to replenish and protect skin's moisture levels.</p>

<p>Check the water hardness in your area and get recommendations for your skin type with the new online tool available at cosmetify.com/the-water-effect.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a quick way to bring moisture back to your skin, the new Liz Earle Hydrating Cream Mask (£20, john lewis.com) is formulated with shea butter and apricot kernel oil to replenish and protect skin's moisture levels.</p>
