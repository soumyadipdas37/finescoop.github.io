<p>The 32-year-old winner of The Voice orchestrated a 'surprise' proposal on September 20 that took place in Hoyt's hometown of Phoenix, Arizona and included her closest family members.  </p>

<p>'I knew how important being around family was to Britt, and with her birthday coming up, I knew it would be the perfect time to do it!' explained Hoot to People on Tuesday. </p>

<p>'[Brittney is] one of seven, so arranging everyone to fly in and it still be a surprise was tough, but we all coordinated how it would happen, and it went off without a hitch!'</p>

<p>Despite his best efforts, Brittney caught on to Jake's plan when she noticed her family was waiting around idly at the proposal location. </p>

<p>Jake said that Brittney totally 'lost it' once the reality of the situation finally set in.</p>

<p>'I had to keep her moving forward because she was crying and trying to fall down on me! Then after I popped the question, we were both so emotional that I almost had to wrestle her arm to put the ring on her hand!' recalled the musician.</p>

<p>Brittney, who happens to run the nonprofit The Radiant Initiative, could not help but gush over her stunning engagement ring, which she described to the outlet as her 'dream ring.'  </p>

<p>The pair originally met seven years ago, while performing as wedding singers at a mutual pal's wedding, but they, eventually, 'went [their] separate ways.'</p>

<p>They were then 'brought back into each other's lives while doing missions in Nicaragua' and Hoot said that that trip made him realize Hoyt was bound to be his wife. </p>

<p>'Her heart for others and love for God made me fall in love with her. I'm so glad God blessed the broken road that brought us back around to each other numerous times!' he gushed.</p>

I love Jake's heart for the Lord, how consistent he is no matter who he is around, I love his heart for missions, the poor, I love his humility, his integrity, I knew he was someone I could build a life with.'</p>
