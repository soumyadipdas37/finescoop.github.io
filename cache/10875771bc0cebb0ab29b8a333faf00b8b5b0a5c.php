<p>Sir Richard Branson has revealed plans for a £300million 'blank cheque' company to help expand his Virgin empire.</p>

<p>The British tycoon has proposed a so-called special purpose acquisition vehicle - or 'spac' - that would hunt for attractive businesses that can be bought for bargain prices in the wake of the pandemic.</p>

<p>The venture will look at firms in sectors Virgin already operates in, such as travel, leisure, financial services and fitness, according to regulatory filings.</p>

<p>Spacs, which have gained popularity in recent months, are billed as a way for companies to list on the stock market without having to go through the usual regulatory process.</p>

<p>They act as listed shell companies which private companies are then reversed into.</p>

<p>Branson's firm, named VG Acquisition, is registered in the Cayman Islands and would aim to raise £309million ($400million) from investors. </p>

<p>It would have two years to spend the money or return it.</p>
