<p>Melting hearts! Radio star Fifi Box (pictured) shared an adorable photo of her one-year-old daughter Daisy Belle sitting in a washing basket on Thursday</p>

<p>In the picture, an adorable Daisy Belle sat in the white washing basket and smiled at the camera.</p>

<p>Fifi's post comes one day after she shared a video of Daisy Belle cheekily flipping her mum the middle finger. </p>

<p>In a video posted to Instagram on Wednesday, the radio host can be heard laughing from behind the camera.</p>

<p>Sweet memories! In the picture, an adorable Daisy Belle sat in the white washing basket and smiled at the camera</p>

<p>Covered in pasta sauce, Daisy pulled a series of funny faces as her mum filmed her, bunching up her nose, pursing her lips and squeezing her eyes shut.</p>

<p>She then began repeatedly shaking her head while smirking, before subtly rubbing her nose with her middle finger, leaving Fifi in hysterics as she filmed the interaction.</p>

<p>'Happy little pasta eater (and yes I think she flipped the bird at me),' she captioned the video, adding a crying-with-laughter emoji.</p>

<p>Sticking it to her: Fifi's post comes one day after she shared a video of Daisy Belle cheekily flipping her 43-year-old mum the middle finger</p>

<p>In June 2019, Fifi welcomed daughter, Daisy Belle, via IVF and an anonymous donor. The identity of Daisy's father is not public knowledge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the radio host shares her daughter Trixie, with her ex Grant Kenny.  </p>

<p>In an interview with Show + Tell in October 2015, Fifi spoke about her life as a single mum, and confessed she doesn't get too overwhelmed.</p>

<p>'Motherhood was a challenge that I always hoped would maybe come along one day, which I looked forward to, and for me, it's my soul,' she said.</p>

<p>She continued: 'I've always felt it would be very natural, and I've always felt I am very maternal anyway, so for me, it's just the biggest blessing.' </p>

<p>Mummy's girls: In addition to Daisy, Fifi is also single mum to seven-year-old daughter, Trixie (far left), who she shares with ex Grant Kenny</p>
