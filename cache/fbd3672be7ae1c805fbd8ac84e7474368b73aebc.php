<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>From King Canute’s victory in 1016 that briefly restored Viking rule to our shores to today’s ongoing battle against Covid-19, it vibrantly illustrates life’s rich tapestry as seen from a quaint corner of England.</p>

<p>Across ten skilfully embroidered panels that would, if joined together, be around 32ft long, the Rochford District Heritage Tapestry covers more than 1,000 years of history and social change.</p>

<p>The story that unfolds on its calico panels includes tales of kings and queens, the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381, witch trials of the 16th century, suffragettes, scientific innovation — and even a Victorian policeman’s unfortunate encounter late at night with a dancing bear.</p>

<p>The Rochford District Heritage Tapestry is made up of 10 'timeline' panels that depict the key historic, Christian and social events across the 14 parishes of Rochford District in Essex since the decisive battle of Assandun in 1016, which determined the destiny of the English crown (pictured)</p>

<p>If joined together, the ten panels would be around 32ft long and cover more than 1,000 years of history and social change</p>

<p>Inspired to depict key events in the 14 parishes of Rochford, around 90 adult volunteers and 80 children — aged six to 90-somethings — were involved in different aspects of the project, with the ‘makers’ ranging from beginners to experienced craftspeople</p>

<p>Project manager Geoff Durham, 67, chairman of Rochford Town Team which aims to promote Rochford for its historical charm, estimates around 400 to 500 hours of work went into each of the ten panels, which each measure just over 2ft high by 3ft wide prior to framing</p>

<p>But beyond all that, it is also an inspiring project that has knitted together the community that created it and refused to be beaten during the difficulties, restraints and privations of the 2020 pandemic.</p>

<p>It took the good folk of Rochford, in Essex, some 20 months to plan, research and complete, with 13 of those months dedicated to the mixture of appliqué, felting and different types of embroidery that produced the stunning finished result.</p>

<p>It is hoped parts of the tapestry can be displayed in venues such as churches and libraries. Pictured: Religious penitents crawl to a statue of the Virgin Mary said to have divine powers</p>

<p>The community project was funded through a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and additional sponsorship from the Estuary Elim Church Group</p>

<p>Originally, the tapestry’s creation was centred in a church hall where the crafters would bring in their completed parts.</p>

<p>But social distancing put an end to that. Instead, work had to continue at home with finished sections being sent to tapestry headquarters by post.</p>

<p>Bringing things bang up to date, the last panel features a rainbow (bottom right) which became a symbol of hope and thanks dedicated to the NHS during the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>The tapestry begins with Ashingdon Church, built in 1020 by King Canute to commemorate those who fell at the Battle of Assandun in Essex four years earlier, when his armies defeated those of Edmund Ironside, King of England.</p>
