<p>Former Titans defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth was arrested Monday after he was accused of threatening and yelling at his ex-girlfriend Brittany Jackson and her new boyfriend</p>

<p>Albert Haynesworth and Brittany Jackson attend the Cedars-Sinai Sports Spectacular at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza on May 31, 2015 in Century City, California. The couple, who have a child together, have since broken up, leading to a public battle with accusations of racism </p>

<p>'After being told multiple times to stop yelling and cursing, Haynesworth was taken into custody, charged with domestic assault and disorderly conduct and transported to the Bradley County Justice Center,' the statement reads.</p>

<p>An officer at the jail said Haynesworth was no longer in custody Tuesday.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the sheriff's office did not immediately respond to a request for information about bail in the case. An email to a lawyer who has previously represented Haynesworth was not immediately returned Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Jackson is a former University of Tennessee basketball star who went on to play in the WNBA.  </p>

<p>In 2017, Haynesworth made news by publicly accusing Jackson of racially and physically abusing him during their two-year relationship.</p>

<p>Haynesworth was speaking out about the alleged violence on Twitter after Jackson publicly accused him of not paying child support for their son, Ayden.</p>

<p>Haynesworth claimed that during their relationship, Jackson, 36, called him 'unthinkable names' - including the N-word - and was 'extremely violent'.</p>

<p>In a series of tweets he titled 'The Ugly Truth About Brittany', Haynesworth said he had called the police on his six-foot tall former WNBA-pro girlfriend more than ten times.</p>

<p>'I have witnesses and bruises but me for some reason still tried to protect her by not sending her to jail bc I didn't want to ruin her so called career and name,' he wrote in the statement.</p>

<p>Haynesworth has been receiving dialysis since his kidneys failed. After he revealed the news last summer, Vanderbilt University Medical Center said it had more than 1,000 calls and offers to donate a kidney or ask about the process within a day. However, he has not yet received a transplant</p>

<p>Haynesworth claimed that Jackson called him the N-word because he 'didn't show her affection' and she wanted him to 'feel hurt'.</p>

<p>The football player added: 'Being a man I am a provider and protecter (sic) I have millions of faults that are not flattering but NO ONE deserves to be mentally and physically abuse!!!' </p>

<p>Jackson responded to the accusations in a statement, calling Haynesworth's claims 'absurd.'</p>

<p>The 15th overall pick in the 2002 draft, Haynesworth spent the first seven years of his career with the Titans, earning Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro honors in his final two seasons. He parlayed those campaigns into a record-setting, seven-year, $100 million deal with the Washington Redskins in 2009</p>

<p>The 15th overall pick in the 2002 draft, Haynesworth spent the first seven years of his career with the Titans, earning Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro honors in his final two seasons. He parlayed those campaigns into a record-setting, seven-year, $100 million deal with the Washington Redskins in March of 2009.  </p>

<p>Haynesworth played just three seasons after that, appearing in 20 games with Washington, six with New England and seven with Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>And since his deal with the Redskins was not fully guaranteed, he reportedly retired with $55 million in career earnings, according to spotrac.com. </p>

<p>In a 2015 article for the Players' Tribune, Haynesworth addressed his younger self and admitted that he should have never signed with Washington. </p>

<p>'You thrive in a very specific scheme,' he wrote. 'When you hit free agency, the Washington Redskins are going to offer you $100 million. Everyone will talk about this (they won't talk about the fact that most of that money is not guaranteed, or that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offered you $135 million). The $100 million will become a huge burden. Take less and stay in Tennessee where you belong.'</p>

<p>He ended his career with 30.5 sacks in 123 games (92 starts).</p>

<p>Haynesworth developed a reputation as a dirty player following a game against Dallas in 2006 in which he kicked off Cowboys center Andre Gurode's helmet and stomped on his face.</p>

<p>Gurode had to get 30 stitches and Haynesworth was suspended for five games. He later apologized and the pair reportedly became friends.</p>

<p>Haynesworth was arrested in 2011 for groping a woman. A charge of sexual assault was later reduced to simple assault. He pleaded no contest.  </p>

<p>Earlier that year, he was charged with simple assault for a road rage incident. The charge was later dropped in a settlement.      </p>

<p>Haynesworth played just three seasons after that, appearing in 20 games with Washington, six with New England and seven with Tampa Bay</p>
