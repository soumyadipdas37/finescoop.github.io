<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A simple road rule quiz about trucks on roundabouts has bewildered drivers. </p>

<p>Transport WA posted a question to Facebook about whether a truck is allowed to use two lanes when turning right on a roundabout.</p>

<p>'The driver of this truck is turning right at the roundabout,' it wrote.</p>

<p>'It has a 'DO NOT OVERTAKE TURNING VEHICLE' sign on the back. Is the truck allowed to take up two lanes to turn at the roundabout?'</p>

<p>Some drivers were adamant they had the right to continue in their allocated lane.</p>

<p>Transport WA posted a question to Facebook about whether a truck is allowed to use two lanes when turning right on a roundabout</p>

<p>'Look at the size of the semi compared to the roundabout,' one woman wrote.</p>

<p>'I therefore believe it is possible to use the outside lane without crossing into the inside lane. </p>

<p>'The driver therefore has a responsibility to stay in one lane.'</p>

<p>But she was part of the minority, with most drivers accepting it would be a risky to travel beside a turning truck.</p>

<p>'Anyone who tried to overtake must have a death wish!' a woman wrote.</p>

<p>'Yes and don’t try to sneak around the truck, if you get hit you're in the wrong,' another agreed.</p>

<p>Transport WA confirmed the truck was allowed to use both lanes while turning right at a roundabout. </p>

<p>'Long vehicles often need more space to turn safely,' it wrote.</p>

<p>'They're allowed to use any part of the two marked lanes to turn left or right at corners, intersections and roundabouts - if they have a 'DO NOT OVERTAKE TURNING VEHICLE' sign.'</p>

<p>Drivers could cop a $400 fine and be docked four demerit points if they fail to overtake at a safe distance in Western Australia.</p>

<p>The same penalties are in place for overtaking at a railway or pedestrian crossing and overtaking on a continuous white line.  </p>
