<p>Recently, Kourtney just held her first virtual Poosh Wellness Festival on Saturday. The festival's mission aimed to provide 'immersive activities and engaging conversations within the wellness space.'</p>

<p>A few days ago, Kourtney spoke to WWD where she discussed Poosh and her push for clean eating - a movement especially in LA that has become more normalized. </p>

<p>'It's frustrating to feel like it's kind of this weird thing to eat organically or things that to me are pretty standard in self-care, so I think now it's become normal in a way and I'm just happy that it's catching on' she shared.  </p>
