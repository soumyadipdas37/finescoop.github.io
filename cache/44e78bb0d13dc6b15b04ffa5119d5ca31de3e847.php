<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Andy Murray has revealed he intends to respond to his early French Open exit by playing as much as possible for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>The former world No 1 and 2016 finalist suffered a sobering three-set defeat to Stan Wawrinka in the first round at Roland Garros, with the 33-year-old Scot winning just six games as he crashed 6-1 6-3 6-2 on Sunday.</p>

<p>The loss to his old Swiss rival was Murray's equal heaviest in a Grand Slam tournament and came on the back of only taking nine games against Felix Auger-Aliassime in the second round of the US Open.</p>

<p>Andy Murray exited the French Open after being beaten by 2015 champion Stan Wawrinka</p>

<p>Murray's straight-sets defeat by old Swiss rival Warwinka was his equal heaviest in a major</p>

<p>Murray, who is battling back after having right hip surgery in January 2018 and 2019, was competing in his first clay-court match since reaching the 2017 semi-finals in Paris, where he again lost to Wawrinka.</p>

<p>But he revealed he now aims to play as many matches as possible for the rest of 2020, including events in Germany before heading to Australia.</p>

<p>'I know tournament-wise I'm going to try to play as much as I can between now and the end of the year,' Murray said. </p>

<p>'The plan is to play in Cologne, the two tournaments there. Probably the only positive (of his defeat by Wawrinka) is I will get more time to prepare on the indoor hard courts for that.'</p>

<p>Murray aims to head Down Under before the end of the year to prepare for the Australian Open</p>

<p>Murray accepts travelling to Australia will depend on Covid-19 restrictions, but he hopes to be part of Britain's team for the new 24-nation ATP Cup in early January ahead of the Australian Open in Melbourne later that month.</p>

<p>'We don't know exactly what the rules are going to be for Australia, but it's looking like you'll have to get there very early to prepare for that,' Murray added.</p>

<p>'As it stands, I wouldn't make the ATP Cup team, but my understanding is they are looking to put an ATP event on in Australia the beginning of the year, so that's currently what I would be doing.        </p>

<p>'I'd like to play in the ATP Cup because I was supposed to last year, and it looked like a great event.</p>

<p>Murray said he hopes to play in the ATP in Australia before the first Major of 2021 in Melbourne</p>

<p>'My plan is to for sure go to Australia. I just don't know exactly what the exact situation is in terms of what date we would have to go, because by the sounds of it, it's pretty early I think. You'd have to go like mid-December.'</p>

<p>Murray is now 3-3 since the resumption of the ATP Tour after the five-month COVID-19 suspension, and is currently ranked world No 111.</p>

<p>'I'll need to have a long, hard think and try and understand what happened,' he said after losing to Wawrinka.</p>

<p>'It's not for me the sort of match I would just brush aside and not give any thought to. There are obviously reasons behind a performance kind of like that.'</p>
