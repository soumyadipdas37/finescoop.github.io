<p>Natural beauty: Nicole Poturalski, who is dating Brad Pitt, showcased her stunning good looks in a series of stylish black and white snaps shared on Instagram on Sunday</p>

<p>Nicole completed the elegant look with a pair of high-waisted trousers, posing casually with one hand in the pocket.</p>

<p>She tilted her head slightly to the side as she gazed intensely into the camera, her long raven tresses hanging loosely over her shoulders.  </p>

<p>Nicole captioned the stylish shots: 'Slow Sundays,' which was amusingly followed by a sloth emoji.</p>

<p>Nicole and Brad had enjoyed a romantic trip to his Chateau Miraval in France, where the Oscar winner produces a $390 rosé champagne.</p>

<p>The boyfriend: Brad and Nicole were first spotted together in November at the Hollywood Bowl</p>

<p>But the visit has reportedly angered his ex-wife as the chateau was where the two were married in 2014.</p>

<p>Making matters worse was that Brad and Nicole visited only days after what would have been his sixth wedding anniversary with the actress.</p>

<p>'Angie is furious and utterly stunned Brad could stoop this low,' a source told The Mirror. She was highly hopeful they could dial down the intensity after a terrible summer of fighting, but now that’s totally off the table.' </p>

<p>'It grosses her out that he’s cavorting around Europe so publicly with this girl, instead of keeping a private and dignified lid on his love life.'</p>

<p>The former couple were believed to have worked out some of their differences in recent months, but the Changeling star seems to have shaken things up by seeking to have the judge in their divorce proceedings dismissed. </p>

<p>'The way Brad sees it, she’s made his life hell for years by blocking so many of his basic requests and his efforts to be fair and cordial,' said another insider. 'Basically, they’re two extremely proud and stubborn people who have a strong point of view and won’t back down.'  </p>
