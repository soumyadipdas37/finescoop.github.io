<p>'And I just felt like, since it's kids stuff, I'm just going to make a page for my daughter, because it's going to be her business, her stuff, and she's going to be the boss. </p>

<p>'I understand why people say, "Oh it's kind of weird because she's two years old." Well, my two-year-old and your two-year-old [are] different, you know what I'm saying? Stop staying stuff. She's well protected. I always protect my kid, and I don't want her page being [covered] with negativity. </p>

<p>'Like I said, she's a happy baby. It's supposed to be a happy page and soon her business ventures are going to launch. All of you guys enjoy it and stop with the weird stuff please. I know how to be a mom. If I'm not good at nothing else, I'm good at being a mother. Trust.'</p>
