<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Selma Blair has come a long way in the 22 months since going public about her multiple sclerosis diagnosis and grueling chemotherapy treatments.</p>

<p>And on Thursday,  the Cruel Intentions star looked seemingly happy and healthy when she stepped out for a casual afternoon with boyfriend Ron Carlson and her son Arthur Saint Bleick.</p>

<p>The day's events included a stop at a restaurant where the trio sat outside and ate lunch and sipped on the tasty beverages.</p>

<p>Quality time: Selma Blair, 48, enjoyed a casual afternoon  on Thursday in Los Angeles with beau Ron Carlson and son Arthur Saint Bleick, which included lunch at a restaurant</p>

<p>Blair, 48, was all about casual-comfort in the fashion department in a black and white striped shirt that, at times, was partially covered up with a black hoodie.</p>

<p>She also donned baggy black sweatpants, black sneakers and her dark tresses styled in a grown-out pixie-cut, which is a major contrast considering she had lost her hair during a round of experimental chemotherapy.</p>

<p>In accordance to health and safety protocols, the Michigan native wore a red protective mask at all times, with the exception of when she sat down to eat.</p>

<p>They got the memo: Both mom and son fashion coordinated in identical black and white striped shirts and sweatpants</p>

<p>Since there was proper social distancing between the tables and the waiter wore a mask and face shield, Blair was able to feel secure with the risks amid the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The actress seemed to really content sipping on a cup of tea after enjoying a light meal.</p>

<p>Arthur, nine, appeared to have worn the exact same style shirt as his mother along with a pair of olive-green sweatpants and a white and black mask.</p>

<p>Carlson, 51, looked fit and trim in blue denim jeans, a navy blue t-shirt, white sneakers, a black and white Atari baseball cap and a multi-colored mask. </p>

<p>Safety first: The trio were able to take off their protective masks amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to proper social distancing at the restaurant</p>

<p>Healthy and radiant: The Cruel Intentions star, who sipped on a cup of tea after a light meal, now has a grown out pixie-cut, which is a major contrast considering she had lost her hair during a round of experimental chemotherapy</p>

<p>After lunch the trio were seen heading on their way down the sidewalk, all wearing their masks again and Arthur cruising along the pavement on a two-wheel kick scooter. </p>

<p>The actress and novelist reignited their romance in January 2020 following Blair's breakup with David Lyons weeks earlier. </p>

<p>They had previously dated from July 2017 until about January 2018, which was seven months before her MS diagnosis. </p>

<p>Blair shares her son with ex-partner and fashion designer, Jason Bleick.        </p>
