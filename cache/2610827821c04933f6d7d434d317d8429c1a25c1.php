<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Branded wine ranges seem to be the latest celebrity tactic for making a few extra pennies as Kylie Minogue joins the list of famous faces with their own vintages, standing to make £1million off the back of their deals. </p>

<p>While most savvy celebrities always have an eye on expanding their ever-growing empires with endorsements and brand deals, wine seems to be the most popular new venture for 2020. </p>

<p>In the last three months alone, Kylie, 52, has launched her new rosé collection, and actress Cameron Diaz and singer Post Malone have also unveiled their own bottles of pink. </p>

<p>They join a long list of famous faces flexing their star power with their own alcoholic offerings, including Graham Norton, Cliff Richard, Phillip Schofield, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Sarah Jessica Parker. </p>

<p>And wine brands are not just limited to celebrities, even the Queen has a range of sparkling white wine - Windsor Great Park Vineyard 2014.  </p>

<p>Kylie Minogue, 52, joins the long list of celebrities using the power of their name to a brand as a side hustle, this time branching out into the wine industry</p>

<p>Last month Cameron Diaz, 47, launched her new wine line in partnership with entrepreneur Katherine Power. The range comprises of a Spanish red and French rosé</p>

<p>Graham Norton has a successful wine brand, with a best-selling SauviGNon Blanc, South Australian Shiraz, New Zealand Rosé, Italian Prosecco as well as Pink and Irish gins</p>

<p>Not a stranger to putting her name to products, Kylie Minogue recently stepped into the world of vintage wines after the success of her affordable collection launch earlier this year. </p>

<p>Her latest addition, 'Côtes de Provence Rosé' priced at £18 a bottle, joins her debut Classic Collection which was developed in celebration of her 52nd birthday.  </p>

<p>The popstar, who always seems to be at the forefront of the branding deals, also has  homeware range Kylie Minogue at Home which launched in 2010, a few years before several stars, including Rita Ora, Holly Willoughy and Tess Daly, jumped on the trend.</p>

<p>And it doesn't end there, Kylie also has also put her name to several fragrances since her debut into the perfume industry in 2006. </p>

<p>So what is it about wine that may have caught Kylie's eye as her next side hustle?</p>

<p>After launching her debut vino earlier this year, Kylie unveiled her new vintage offering this week, a deal which one PR expert believes could make her up to £1million</p>

<p>The popstar has been known to use her well-known name to get her foot into the door of several industries, including homeware with her Kylie at Home collection </p>

<p>CEO of PR agency 10 Yetis Digital Andy Barr said: 'The main draw of the wine business, aside from the obvious cash money returns and the vague tax laws around investing in the industry, is the chance for a niche or maybe B list celebrity to upscale their "brand" appeal and take them to the A-List level, with the right marketing and PR strategy that is. </p>

<p>Andy Barr, CEO of PR agency 10 Yetis Digital, says Kylie could make as much as £1million from the deal</p>

<p>'There is a reason The Beckhams, The Jolie/Pitt's (RIP to Brangelina!), Sting and Francis Ford Coppola all decided to develop a wine side hustle. </p>

<p>'Lending a respected and well-known name to an existing vineyard enables mediocre or substandard wine to be sold for an inflated price, increasing the potential margin just by franchising a celebrity name. </p>

<p>'Easy money, for very little involvement, especially if they don't actually own and oversee the production themselves. </p>

<p>'I can't imagine Posh Spice treading the grapes herself in her skinny white jeans, can you?'</p>

<p>Off the back of their alcohol deals, retail expert Mr Barr said famous faces depending on how well known they are, can stand to make as much as £1million by adding their name to the brand. </p>

<p>Cliff Richard has a wine brand, Vila Nova, which he produces at his vineyard in Adega Do Cantor, Guia, Algarve, Portugal</p>

<p>Rock star Bon Jovi launched a premium rosé label in 2018 with his son Jesse Bongiovi and acclaimed French Winemaker Gérard Bertrand. The wine has been named on of the top five rosés in the world</p>

<p>Earlier this year Post Malone was one of the latest celebrities to add his name to a rosé wine brand, Maison No.9</p>

<p>'The potential returns from being associated with a drinks brand depends largely on if the celebrity owns it, or just endorses or licences their name to it' he says.  </p>

<p>'For example, George Clooney made his bank balance look as handsome as his face when he sold the tequila brand he owned for $1bn.</p>

<p>'A celebrity looking to just lend their name to a brand can expect to earn upwards of £1m based on their own celebrity worth and stature. </p>

<p>'Sometimes the deals are based on sales volumes and, when you think that wine makers are reported to operate at a 50% gross profit margin, you would expect this kind of deal to surpass the £1m endorsement mark.'  </p>
