<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two of Australia's largest liquor retailers have launched a massive recruitment drive as they advertise 1,600 new jobs in a bid to keep up with summer demand.</p>

<p>With a record 1.45million Australians on JobSeeker during the COVID-19 pandemic, Dan Murphy's alone is looking to hire more than 1,000 casual team members starting as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The chain said the impact of COVID-19 on shopping habits means they need more staff to man their direct-to-boot pick up and contactless delivery services.</p>

<p>BWS is meanwhile advertising for more than 600 staff to work in its stores across metro and regional Australia.</p>

<p>To apply for a Dan Murphy’s job, prospective applicants can enter the stores within commuting distance of their availability at My Career Dan Murphy’s. </p>

<p>Dan Murphy’s Head of Culture &amp; People Siobhan Pelc said the roles on offer would be ideal for university students on a summer break or those who have a background in hospitality.</p>

<p>'If there is a Dan Murphy’s near you, then that store is looking for Customer Assistants who can start as soon as possible or in the coming weeks and months,' Ms Pelc said.</p>

<p>Applicants need to be at least 18 years of age and have a valid RSA to apply. </p>

<p>Both BWS and Dan Murphy's have brought in new measures since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to minimise contact in their stores.</p>

<p>Dan Murphy's has introduced plexiglass screens at checkouts, signage to aid social distancing and strict limits on the number of customers allowed inside at once.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the chain unveiled its first-ever high-tech drive-thru bottle shop - promising a speedy service for customers who want to skip the queue.  </p>

<p>Liquor chain Dan Murphy's earlier this month unveiled its first-ever high-tech 'drive-thru' promising a speedy service for customers who want to skip the queue</p>

<p>The booze retailer's first drive-thru opened at Manly Vale on Sydney's northern beaches, with the service expected to roll out to more outlets across Australia in the next 12 months.</p>

<p>Australians can expect to be served in record time with the direct-to-boot service allowing drivers to be in and out in less than three minutes with their orders.</p>

<p>The process is very simple - customers place their order online, then enter their registration number at point of order, and when they arrive at the drive-thru, digital cameras alert the team members, who then place the order in their car boot.</p>

<p>To apply for a BWS job, applicants can either register in the store or online through Wow Careers and search for BWS. </p>
