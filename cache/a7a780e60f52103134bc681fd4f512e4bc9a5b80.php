<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the horrifying moment a mother-of-two was hogtied and carried out of her house by officers after a Child Protective Services (CPS) visit gone wrong.</p>

<p>In June 2017, Vanessa Peoples's two-year-old son wandered off during a family picnic and, though he was quickly found, it wasn't before a stranger called 911 and reported her.  </p>

<p>One month later, a CPS worker visited her home in Aurora, Colorado, and called police when nobody answered the door because she feared the children had been left alone, according to the magazine Reason.</p>

<p>Peoples was home but hadn't heard the knocks, which officers said was 'concerning.' </p>

<p>When Peoples's mother and a police officer got into an altercation - and Peoples tried to intervene - they ended up pinning her on the ground and tying her hands and legs together.</p>

<p>Although the case was eventually settled out of court, the incident ended in a dislocated arm for Peoples and ongoing nightmares for her two children.  </p>

<p>Mother-of-two Vanessa Peoples, 25, of Aurora, Colorado, was hogtied (pictured) and carried out of her home during a CPS visit gone wrong</p>

<p>In July 2017, a CPS caseworker (right) visited Peoples (left) after she was issued a ticket for child neglect when her toddler wandered off during a family picnic a month prior</p>

<p>When Peoples didn't answer, the caseworker called police. When officers and Peoples's mother got into an argument, and Peoples tried to intervene (pictured), that's when the situation turned violent</p>

<p>According to Reason, Peoples, who is a nursing student, and her children - then ages two and four - were at a family picnic in a park in June 2017.</p>

<p>When a cousin left, the younger son allegedly followed the cousin to the car. </p>

<p>A pedestrian noticed the toddler, who appeared to be unattended, and grabbed him.</p>

<p>That's when Peoples reportedly walked over, having noticed that her child was missing, and demanded the passerby return the child.     </p>

<p>'I'm telling her: "Ma'am, that's my son,"' Peoples told Reason.</p>

<p>'She's refusing to let go of him and talking on the phone. I didn't know she was talking to the police.'</p>

<p>When police arrived, they issued a Peoples a ticket for child neglect and told her a CPS caseworker would be following up.</p>

<p>One month later, when a caseworker called to conduct a well-being check, no one answered her knocks at the door, Reason reported.</p>

<p>Peoples claims she didn't hear the knocks because she was downstairs doing laundry after having given her children baths.</p>

<p>When the caseworker saw a child inside the house, she feared the youngsters had been left alone and called police.</p>

<p>According to the police report, viewed by Reason, officers found the door unlocked and announced that they were entering the residence, and drew their guns.  </p>

<p>'As I was going up the stairs, the sergeant has a gun pointed at my head, saying: "This is the Aurora Police Department!"' Peoples told Reason.  </p>

<p>Bodycam footage shows Peoples pinned down (above) and restrained with hobble handcuffs, which is when the hands and legs are each individually handcuffed and then attached together</p>

<p>She was then carried to a police car (pictured) but paramedics were called, who took her to a hospital where it was learned she dislocated her shoulder</p>

<p>Cops asked Peoples why she didn't answer the door, to which she replied that she is hard of hearing in one ear - which police noted as a 'concern.' </p>

<p>When Peoples's mother arrived at the house, that's when the situation escalated with the mother and an officer arguing. </p>

<p>Bodycam footage shows Peoples walking over and, when an officer tells her to stand back repeatedly, she replies: 'No, that's my mom. I don't have to stand back' and attempted to walk past hm.</p>

<p>The incident then turns violent and the footage shows the officer putting a hand on Peoples's throat and throwing her to the ground.</p>

<p>She is pinned down and restrained with hobble handcuffs, which is when the hands and legs are each individually handcuffed and attached together </p>

<p>During this confrontation, the 25-year-old is yelling: 'I can't breathe!' and calling for her mother.</p>

<p>'You know how you tie a pig upside down and his feet are hanging from the stick? That's how they carried me,' Peoples told Reason.</p>

<p>The police asked her if she needed medical attention and, when paramedics arrived, Peoples was transported to the hospital.</p>

<p>This when where doctors told her that, during the incident, her should had been dislocated. She was given a sling, ibuprofen and ice - and then booked. </p>

<p>After being bailed out by her mother, she took a plea deal and pleaded guilty to charges of child endangerment.</p>

<p>Peoples took a plea deal and pleaded guilty to charges of child endangerment and also hired an attorney to sue police for the injury, but it was settled before the paperwork was filed</p>

<p>Reason reported that the plea allowed her to avoid jail time, but she also needed to pay a fine and take parenting classes.</p>

<p>Peoples hired Erica Grossman, a civil rights attorney, to sue police for dislocating her shoulder while she was being arrested. </p>

<p>The lawsuit was settled before it was even filed, for an undisclosed amount, but Grossman says this is going to leave a permanent scar. with the families. </p>

<p>'They were using a level of military force like they're at a huge crime scene instead of a child [well-being] check,' Grossman told Reason. </p>

<p>'They did this in front of her two children without a hint of concern about the trauma the children would experience, in the name of making sure their mother was attentive enough.' </p>

<p>Peoples says her children currently experience nightmares about police officers taking her or her husband away in handcuffs.  </p>

<p>'The cops forgot we were human,' Peoples told the magazine.</p>
