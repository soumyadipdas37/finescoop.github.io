<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Graeme Souness has claimed that Leeds have done Liverpool 'a major favour' by given them a tough test in the opening day clash.</p>

<p>Leeds battled bravely at Anfield and ended up losing 4-3 in a hugely entertaining encounter.</p>

<p>Although Leeds left without anything to show for their efforts, Souness believes that they proved to Liverpool how difficult a task they will face this season, with teams set to up their game when they face them. </p>

<p>Graeme Souness praised Leeds for their 'incredible' performance in their 4-3 loss to Liverpool</p>

<p>Souness believes Leeds have done Liverpool 'a major favour' by giving them a scare</p>

<p>Speaking on Sky Sports, Souness said: 'I think that's been a great night for Liverpool in the sense that this is what you're going to get. You're the champions, this is going to be everyone's cup final. I think Leeds have done Liverpool a major favour.'</p>

<p>Liverpool are used to dominating games at Anfield, but Leeds managed to have 52 per cent possession as they gave a very good account of themselves.</p>

<p>Souness was impressed with the way in which Leeds operated and described their performance as 'incredible'. </p>

<p>Liverpool had to work extremely hard to prevail in the entertaining encounter at Anfield</p>

<p>He said: 'Liverpool weren't allowed to be at their best, Leeds hunted them down for the largest part of the game. Liverpool usually do that to teams that come here. </p>

<p>'Tonight Leeds had more possession at Anfield than Liverpool. I don't think I've ever seen a team do that to this Liverpool team. Incredible performance, but they've got nothing to show for it.' </p>

<p>Leeds found the net on three occasions, with Jack Harrison, Patrick Bamford and Mateusz Klich all scoring.</p>

<p>Although Marcelo Bielsa will want his side to be more resilient defensively, this was still a very encouraging performance to mark their return to the Premier League.</p>

<p>Liverpool, meanwhile, were vulnerable at the back, with Virgil van Dijk performing significantly below his usual standard. </p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp's side won the title at a canter last season but are now aware that they could face a considerably more difficult task this time around.  </p>
