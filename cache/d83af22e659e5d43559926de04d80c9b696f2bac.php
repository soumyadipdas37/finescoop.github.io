<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Grant Denyer has shared details of his violent altercation with former Sunrise executive producer Adam Boland 15 years ago.</p>

<p>Speaking about the incident on his It's All True? podcast, Grant explained that the violent blow-up occurred while he was on the job as Sunrise's weatherman in 2005.</p>

<p>Grant, 43, had travelled to Hawaii with Adam to produce a special episode of Sunrise when long-standing tensions between the two men finally came to a head.</p>

<p>'I slammed him against the wall': Grant Denyer (left) has admitted he 'nearly killed' former Sunrise producer Adam Boland (right) during a violent altercation 15 years ago</p>

<p>'One morning we had a technical failure and the signal drops out and Adam Boland instantly goes absolutely crazy!' he recalled.</p>

<p>Grant claimed that he'd overheard Adam chastising his wife, Chezzi, who was working as Sunrise producer at the time, over the loss of signal.</p>

<p>Chezzi, who had travelled to Hawaii with the crew, was pregnant at the time. It is not suggested Adam knew she was pregnant.</p>

<p>'He turns on Cheryl and says, "She's dropped the ball, Cheryl is useless, incompetent,"' Grant claimed.</p>

<p>Grant said he suddenly snapped, telling Adam: 'That's enough!'</p>

<p>Reflecting on what happened next, he said: 'I needed to put a stop to this. He starts flat out abusing us and I blew up.</p>

<p>'I grabbed him and slammed him against the wall and held him by the throat, yelling at him for 10 minutes.' </p>

<p>Furious: The pint-sized TV presenter lost his temper when Adam blamed Grant's wife, Chezzi (left), for a technical error. 'I grabbed him and slammed him against the wall and held him by the throat, yelling at him for 10 minutes,' he said</p>

<p>'Enough is enough and I wanted to stop this guy. I let him have it. It wasn't okay. I did the wrong thing but I needed to have my say and it took three people to pull me off him,' he added. </p>

<p>Grant insisted that he's 'not proud' of the incident. </p>

<p>'I nearly killed him,' he said. 'I am ashamed of my actions and I'd do it differently now, but a few things happened that brought this to a head.' </p>

<p>Adam has also previously spoken about his clash with Grant in Hawaii.</p>

<p>In his 2014 memoir Brekky Central, Adam described Grant 'storming into the control room' in a fit of fury.</p>

<p>'His face turned red as he levelled abuse, accusing me of insulting his wife,' Adam wrote.</p>

<p>'I instructed him to leave but the yelling continued. Members of the crew were left stunned as they heard it unfold on the production intercom.  </p>

<p>'Here was the weather presenter and executive producer engaged in a screaming match while our happy little breakfast show was still on air.'</p>
