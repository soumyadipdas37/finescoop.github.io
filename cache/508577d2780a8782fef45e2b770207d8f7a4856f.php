<p>And the 67-year-old actress has blasted Australian networks for 'taking advantage' of the COVID-19 pandemic to slash quotas on locally made content.</p>

<p>'It's very, very disturbing': Veteran actress Noni Hazlehurst has accused major TV networks of using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to slash local content quotas</p>

<p>'They’ve been trying to do that for years. The reality is they put so much money into sport, which certainly came back to bite them on the bum, and stretching the boundaries of what constitutes Australian content,' she added.</p>

<p>Noni is known for her roles on dramas such as The Sullivans, City Homicide and A Place to Call Home.</p>

<p>She is also famous for presenting children's program Playschool from 1978 to 2001.</p>

<p>Commercial free-to-air television licensees must broadcast an annual minimum of 55 per cent Australian programming between 6am and midnight.</p>

<p>Noni acknowledged that the networks weren't entirely to blame for the dearth of local content, saying they were currently experiencing tough financial times.</p>

<p>Hard times: Noni acknowledged that the networks weren't entirely to blame for the dearth of local content, but she blamed the government for its lack of support for the creative industries</p>

<p>In June, the Federal Government announced a $250million recovery package for the entertainment, arts and screen sectors. </p>

<p>That was followed by a $400million incentive in July to attract productions to Australia and create jobs for production staff, special effects experts, lighting technicians, local actors, extras and set designers. </p>

<p>But Noni argued this was insufficient, saying: 'An $11billion industry with 660,000 workers that's not worth supporting, really leaves a bad taste in your mouth.' </p>

<p>Noni said she was doubtful the next great Australian production would receive any funding by the major networks, even after the economic recovery.</p>
