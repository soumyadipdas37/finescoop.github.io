<p>Mission Possible: Tom Cruise was seen making the impossible look anything but on Sunday, when he shot gravity-defying scenes for Mission: Impossible 7 in Norway</p>

<p>Soon after leaping into the air, the Hollywood screen star let go of the motorbike, allowing it to fall to the grown as he continued his descent in a parachute.</p>

<p>According to eyewitnesses on the set, the awe-inspiring stunt took four takes to pull off on the steep mountainside before rolling cameras.</p>

<p>A helicopter was seen trailing the star as all of the death-defying action took place, as production continued on the big budget production. </p>

<p>On Saturday, he was seen not taking any chances as he prepared to film another heart-stopping scene while donning a face mask to practice his latest fight.</p>

<p>The star was dressed in all-black as he rehearsed his latest scuffle with a stuntman atop a train in Norway, after production for the blockbuster was relocated from the UK following a five-month break amid the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Cruise − who will reprise his role as Ethan Hunt in the spy film series − was attached to a harness for the scuffle on the roof of a train, and briefly chatted to crew members as he prepared to film the scene.</p>

<p>The scenes were filmed in the heart of the Norwegian countryside with a vintage-style train recreated as the setting, surrounded by plenty of scaffolding. </p>

<p>Never shy to take on a challenging stunt, the scene also saw Tom running towards a helicopter as it took off into the sky.</p>

<p>After production for Mission Impossible 7 was moved to Norway, it was reported that Cruise hired a £500,000 ship for the film's crew to avoid any coronavirus-related delays.</p>

<p>Filming was already delayed for five months after COVID-19 spread across Italy, where production had been based in March, leading the release date to be pushed back to November 2021.</p>

<p>Sources claimed the screen star rented the Hurtigruten watercraft for filming as he is 'determined' to avoid further set-backs on the franchise.</p>

<p>'They are terrified of further delays. Tom is determined not to see any more hold-ups. The studio believes it will keep everyone safe and get this shoot wrapped up', a source told The Sun. </p>

<p>It was recently claimed that Tom was 'exempt from Norway's quarantine rules' as he  restart filming in the Scandinavian country. </p>

<p>The media personality revealed how 'excited' he was to start shooting the latest instalment of the franchise in a phone call with Norway’s Minister of Culture Abid Raja. </p>

<p>Speaking about his return, he said: 'It’s a gorgeous country, I can’t wait to get back there. I’m very excited, as is the whole crew, about coming back.' </p>

<p>During the call, the minister told how Norway is 'looking forward to having [Tom] back' and insisted how the Hollywood star and crew are allowed to shoot in the country without having to quarantine at home first, Norwegian publication VG reported.  </p>

<p>However, cast and crew had to pass two tests for coronavirus within 48 hours of landing in Norway and a series of daily rigorous health checks were in place.</p>

<p>Abid added that the film production team wouldn't not have contact with anyone that is not part of the set.</p>

<p>The films focus on agent Ethan and will be directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who previously worked on 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout in 2018.</p>

<p>Mission Impossible 7 will be released on November 19, 2021. </p>
