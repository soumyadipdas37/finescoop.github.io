<p>Failing health prevented the 78-year-old boss of his eponymous team from travelling to Monza on Sunday, but his deputy and daughter waved the cars out of the garage for the final time.</p>

<p>There were tears at Williams, presents exchanged, interviews conducted - and in the middle of it a contest in which Nicholas Latifi finished 11th and George Russell 14th.</p>

<p>Failing health prevented Frank Williams from travelling to the Italian Grand Prix in Monza</p>

<p>Claire Williams paid tribute to her father, Sir Frank, on Sunday night, who has left grand prix</p>

<p>A new board appointed by American investment company Dorilton will now put their stamp on the organisation following a buyout last month.</p>

<p>Sir Frank has made way after half a century and 16 world championships.</p>

<p>Claire said: 'We have had a great time in this sport. My dad, with (Sir) Patrick Head, leaves an incredible legacy.</p>

<p>'Today the team gave me a present - the front wing assembly from the 2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix car.</p>

<p>'It is extraordinary what my dad has done. I am so proud of him. I have been inspired by him. This sport has given our family so much and we will be eternally grateful.'</p>

<p>Williams (middle) described her dad's contribution as 'extraordinary' while out in Monza</p>
