<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham fans have reacted with delight to the news that Gareth Bale has returned to the club.</p>

<p>It was announced on Saturday that the Welshman will spend the next season at the club on loan from Real Madrid. </p>

<p>The news comes seven years after the 31-year-old left the club, following a memorable six-year stint at the old White Hart Lane. </p>

<p>Tottenham have confirmed the return of Gareth Bale on loan from Real Madrid for 2020-2021</p>

<p>Bale spent six years at Tottenham and makes his return after seven years at Real Madrid</p>

<p>After Tottenham broke the news, fans flooded onto social media to give their immediate reaction to the news. </p>

<p>Nigel Parker tweeted: 'Yessss back home where you belong' while RyanGoldy8 commented: 'This is the greatest day of my life and I'm fully including my wedding day in that Gareth Bale is home'.</p>

<p>A number of users joked about the Welshman being the best replacement for himself, since he left in 2013.</p>

<p>One user commented: 'Tottenham finally replace Bale...with Bale. Fair play, great signing and a great player, definitely gonna be frighting going forward.' </p>

<p>Erik Lamela was seen as the replacement to Bale when he joined from Roma in 2013 for just under £26m.</p>

<p>GabriFifa tweeted: 'Erik Lamela, from being the "Bale replacement" to now being replaced by Bale.'</p>

<p>A number of supporters also joked about Bale and his love of golf.</p>

<p>Kobey Davidson joked about Tottenham's video unveiling Bale, 'Not gonna lie disappointed it was not a golf video.'</p>

<p>While ElNino posted a picture of golf flags posted on the goal-line at the Tottenham Hotspurs Stadium with the caption 'Spurs have already made some adjustments in the goal post for him.'</p>

<p>During his first-spell at the club, Bale scored 55 goals in 203 appearances, winning the PFA Player of the Year during his last year at the club.</p>

<p>Tottenham fans might have to wait a month for the winger to make his second debut with the club as he recovers from a knee injury sustained on international duty with Wales.</p>

<p>They will be hoping the signings of Bale and Sergio Reguilon, also from Real Madrid, will help propel them into Champions League qualification this season.</p>
