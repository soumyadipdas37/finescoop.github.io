<p>'Maxi taxi on the side at least three possibly four persons inside. One person on the road breathing extremely shallowly and lost a lot of blood,' the operator said.</p>

<p>'Just kicked in the back window of the maxi taxi, got the other two guys out,' Nick Dupont told Nine News. </p>

<p>One of them was only 14-years old.  </p>

<p>Paramedics transported 11 people to the John Hunter hospital, with most of the passengers in the Holden Commodore sustaining only minor injuries.</p>
