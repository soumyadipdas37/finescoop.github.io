<p>Great British Bake Off viewers were left in shock when contestant Sura, 31, (right) accidentally knocked her rival Dave's (left) cake off the judging table onto the floor </p>

<p>Dave, 30, from Hampshire, was left in a difficult situation when his mini pineapple upside-down cakes were knocked onto the floor</p>

<p>An upset Sura quickly apologised, insisting: 'I'm so sorry. Oh my god. I'm so sorry there was a fly, I went to shoo it away and I knocked it'. </p>

<p>Sura then burst into tears and hosts Noel Fielding and Matt Lucas rushed over to help, with Noel teasing: 'I blame Matt.'</p>

<p>Comforting Sura, the Little Britain comedian added: 'It's probably my fault, because I was looking at you and I think you were probably hypnotised by my beauty.' </p>

<p>However viewers were slightly less forgiving of the incident, with several calling the incident 'sabotage', and saying they had 'gasped out loud' when the cakes had toppled. </p>

<p>Sura (pictured) then burst into tears and hosts Noel Fielding and Matt Lucas rushed over to help the upset contestant </p>

<p>'I actually screamed when she dropped his cakes', wrote one impassioned viewer.  Another said: Omg this is more intense than Baked Alaska Gate'. </p>

<p>A third said: 'Oh. My. Goodness. Sabotage! Another agreed, 'Sabotage on the first bake off. I can't believe it'.   </p>

<p>But despite the drama, it was a guilty looking Sura who took away the first prize on the technical challenge, narrowly beating Peter who came in second place. </p>

<p>Viewers were slightly less forgiving of the incident, with several calling the incident 'sabotage', and saying they had 'gasped out loud' when the cakes had toppled</p>

<p>And luckily for Dave, his cakes survived to live another day, and were judged on their taste over their misshapen appearance.  </p>

<p>Many viewers compared the moment to the infamous Baked Alaska scandal that shook the nation in 2014.  </p>

<p>Construction engineer Iain Watters was appalled when Women's Institute member Diana Beard removed his Baked Alaska show-stopper from the freezer on a 30 degree day - and left it out to melt.</p>

<p>A devastated Sura wiped tears away from her eyes as she insisted the incident was accidental </p>

<p>Dave was left worried about his cakes, but told Sura that 'accidents happen' and not to worry </p>

<p>Iain, much like his dessert, went into meltdown, threw his soggy creation into the bin and stormed out of the tent.</p>

<p>The viewing public let out a collective gasp when Iain later returned and presented Mary and Paul with nothing. Mel was seen rubbing her temples in panic while Paul looked dumbfounded.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Iain was given the boot, causing viewers to scream 'fix' at the baking show and the hashtag 'Justice for Iain' began trending on Twitter.</p>

<p>Luckily for Dave, his cakes survived to live another day, and were judged on their taste over their misshapen appearance</p>

<p>The BBC was even forced to issue a statement on the debacle after receiving 556 complaints from furious fans.  </p>

<p>Equally shocked fans took to twitter this evening, with one viewer writing: ''Omg this is more intense than Baked Alaska Gate'</p>

<p>Another, very impassioned viewer said: 'SHE'S KNOCKED THE CAKES OUT OF HIS HANDS. IT'S THESE TWO ALL OVER AGAIN'.  </p>

<p>A third commented: 'Is pineapple upside down cake the new baked Alaska?!' </p>
