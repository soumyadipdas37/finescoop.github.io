<p>During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Bella Varelis and Irena that he was in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.</p>

<p>After an emotional break-up with Bella, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena , telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her.</p>

<p>'Irena, every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that,' he told the nurse.  </p>

<p>'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole package.'</p>

<p>'And Locky was under Doug in my phone,' Irena revealed.  </p>

<p>'Douglas is Locky's middle name so that's where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' she explained.</p>
