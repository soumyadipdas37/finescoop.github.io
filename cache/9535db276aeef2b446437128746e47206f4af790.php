<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Parents are being kept away from their babies in intensive care as hospitals impose ‘horrendous’ social distancing rules, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.</p>

<p>One mother, Taylor Moss, told of her anguish at how visits to her seven-week premature baby, Tyger-Rose, were being restricted. </p>

<p>Her daughter was given less than a five per cent chance of survival and has been in intensive care for the past ten days. </p>

<p>But the hospital only allows one parent in at a time.</p>

<p>Ms Moss said: ‘We had to pick alternate days to see our child. It made us feel horrendous, and me very vulnerable. It was horrible.’</p>

<p>The campaign has today been backed by Stoke MP Jonathan Gullis, whose first child, Amelia, was kept in hospital for a week after she was born last month with a high temperature, and needed antibiotics. Pictured, Mr Gullis, partner Nkita and baby Amelia, now all back at home</p>

<p>Another new mother told how she was not allowed to hold her baby for more than 24 hours after giving birth. She said: ‘I spent the whole day crying to see her.’</p>

<p>Clinicians have raised alarm over the policies. One midwife told The Mail on Sunday the rules could damage a baby’s chances of survival.</p>

<p>This newspaper is campaigning to end the scandal of lone births which leaves women at half of NHS Trusts without support, flying in the face of the Government guidelines.</p>

<p>Mr Gullis was only allowed to see her for an hour a day while she was in hospital. ‘I felt like I’d missed out on a really big bonding opportunity,’ he said. </p>

<p>‘It is essential that parents be able to access their child, especially where it could be the difference between life and death’</p>

<p>Joeli Brearley of campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, said: ‘It is unimaginable that a parent would be prevented from touching and holding their own baby after birth, particularly when the baby is sick and requires intensive care.’</p>

<p>A poll commissioned by The Mail on Sunday from Deltapoll has found nearly two-thirds of people support our campaign. </p>
