<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hundreds of pupils across the UK were self-isolating yesterday after a string of Covid-19 outbreaks in schools.</p>

<p>Some schools were forced to close entirely but Education Secretary Gavin Williamson insisted the Government is ‘very much’ in control of the safe return of students.</p>

<p>Dozens of schools across England and Wales reported cases of the virus, resulting in children and staff being sent home.</p>

<p>At least three shut completely while others delayed their openings or told dozens of youngsters to stay away from lessons.</p>

<p>However, outbreaks have only happened in a small proportion of the UK’s more than 30,000 schools.</p>

<p>A school visited by Boris Johnson on August 26 (pictured) – Castle Rock High School in Coalville, Leicestershire – put a number of pupil groups into self-isolation ‘as a precaution’ after a staff member tested positive</p>

<p>Cases emerged yesterday after primaries and secondaries began reopening to all year groups last week for the first time since March, with the remainder due to open this week.</p>

<p>A school visited by Boris Johnson on August 26 – Castle Rock High School in Coalville, Leicestershire – put a number of pupil groups into self-isolation ‘as a precaution’ after a staff member tested positive. During his visit, Mr Johnson had said that ‘continuing to be out of school’ was the biggest risk to children.</p>

<p>Yesterday in a House of Commons session with Mr Williamson, Labour MP Matt Western said: ‘Just in the last week, we’ve had 46 cases in schools across the UK.</p>

<p>‘In Scotland, there were 86 cases, a total of 158 schools already have cases.</p>

<p>‘In a Suffolk school, five teachers, I think it’s in Health Secretary [Matt Hancock’s] own constituency, five teachers and the school has had to close.’</p>

<p>He asked: ‘Is [Mr Williamson] confident the Government really has this under control?’ The Education Secretary responded ‘very much so’ and told MPs schools will only be shut as an ‘absolute last resort’.</p>

<p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said yesterday it was ‘impossible’ to eliminate the risks of transmission in school or the wider community.</p>

<p>He added: ‘It is therefore likely that disruption will continue over the coming weeks and months.’</p>

<p>A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘The very small number of schools asking some or all of their pupils to remain at home are following our clear published process following a positive case being confirmed.’</p>

<p>The Suffolk school referred to by Mr Western – the Samuel Ward Academy in Haverhill – closed yesterday but said it hoped to reopen today.</p>

<p>As many as 200 pupils across eight Liverpool schools are self-isolating for 14 days after confirmed coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>Old Buckenham High School in Norfolk closed after a member of staff tested positive, according to the BBC education website. It will reopen after a deep clean.</p>

<p>In Middlesbrough, Hemlington Hall Academy was closed to reception and nursery children yesterday after a member of staff went home with suspected symptoms on Friday. The affected classes will not be allowed to return until September 21.</p>

<p>Cases have also been confirmed at three schools in the surrounding area. The city was added to the official Covid-19 watchlist as an ‘area of concern’ on Friday.</p>

<p>Six schools in Sunderland announced partial closures while a seventh in the area shut fully.</p>

<p>The JCB Academy in Rocester, Staffordshire, shut on Friday after a pupil tested positive and around 100 students are self-isolating.</p>

<p>Schools in East Sussex, South London, Leeds and Nottingham have also closed to some year groups or delayed reopening, forcing pupils into self-isolation, after teachers tested positive.</p>

<p>Year One pupils at Newsham Primary School, Blyth, Northumberland, have been asked to self-isolate after a child tested positive. The school had only reopened last Wednesday.</p>

<p>In Wales, at least eight schools were believed to have been affected by coronavirus since reopening. Schools in Scotland have been open since mid-August.</p>

<p>Many also complain of a lack of support and up-to-date advice from their universities.</p>
