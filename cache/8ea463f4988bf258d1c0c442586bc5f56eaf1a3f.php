<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian man who recently discovered his six-year-old daughter wasn't his has appeared on live radio to ask listeners if he should confront his wife.</p>

<p>John and his partner had been trying unsuccessfully for a second child before he booked himself in for a doctor's visit to see whether something biological was standing in their way.</p>

<p>The doctor confirmed that John was infertile - and had been his entire life - before a DNA test showed that he hadn't fathered his young daughter.</p>

<p>Shocked and at a loss of what to do, John appeared on KIIS 106.5's Kyle and Jackie O radio show on September 30 to discuss his options with fellow listeners.</p>

<p>Do you think John should confront his wife?</p>

<p>Do you think John should confront his wife?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>So far his partner of more than eight years doesn't realise John is aware of their daughter's biology.   </p>

<p>'It hits hard because I haven't told anyone. She was conceived quite young and we weren't married at that time,' John said.</p>

<p>'When you do have a child of your own it's amazing. It's fantastic. Now that I look back at it, my whole world has stopped and I don't know what to think.'</p>

<p>The couple were together for almost two years before John's wife got pregnant.  </p>

<p>'At the end of the day I'm going to call her my daughter. But I'm trying to get the answers. Do I disappear, do I not? Do I stay? It's hard to look at my wife but that's my daughter,' he said.</p>

<p>Shocked and at a loss of what to do, John appeared on KIIS 106.5's Kyle and Jackie O (pictured) radio show on September 30 to discuss his options with fellow listeners</p>

<p>During the COVID-19 lockdown work dried up for John and things became stressful at home.</p>

<p>He put down their inability to conceive a second child to this stress before noticing that it had been quite a number of years of trying.  </p>

<p>A listener named Dave called into the station and said the same thing happened to him but his daughter was two, and he had to cut all ties from the mother and child.</p>

<p>Dave was upset and began to cry on the phone, saying that his partner had been toxic and the little girl still wasn't sure who her father was.</p>

<p>John was distressed by this and said that he didn't want to be out of his daughter's life in the same way Dave had been pushed aside. </p>

<p>A woman said that there was no point in John bottling this information up any longer than he already has as it will 'ruin your relationship with the mother', so she recommended bringing it into the light now. </p>

<p>Perhaps the mother would like it to be kept quiet as well and they could pretend nothing had changed, she suggested.</p>

<p>But child counsellor Tara said that John's daughter's world is going to be turned upside down by the news and he needs to be there for her, if that's what he ultimately chooses to do. </p>

<p>A woman who found out her father wasn't her dad at 54 through ancestry.com agreed, suggesting the girl would have comfort knowing now rather than later.</p>
