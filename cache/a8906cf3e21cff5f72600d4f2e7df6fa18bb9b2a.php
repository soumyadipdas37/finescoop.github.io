<p>Premalal Jayasekara from the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) was convicted in August of murdering an opposition activist after opening fire at an election rally in 2015.</p>

<p>But the 45-year-old's conviction and sentence came after nominations for the August 5 poll, meaning he could still contest the election and take up his seat.</p>

<p>Premalal Jayasekara, a convicted murderer, was heckled as he took oath as an MP in Sri Lanka's parliament</p>

<p>Jayasekara was a no-show when the current parliament held its first session on August 20 as prison authorities refused to let him out.</p>

<p>However, he petitioned the Court of Appeal which on Monday held that he should be escorted from prison to exercise his rights as an MP.</p>

<p>Opposition lawmakers wearing black shawls in protest heckled Jayasekara as he took the oath and several staged a walkout.</p>

<p>He is to be escorted back to prison after the day's session.</p>

<p>Jayasekara became the first convicted murderer to serve as an MP in Sri Lanka. He has been an MP since 2001.</p>

<p>In January 2015, he opened fire at a stage being set up for an election event by a rival party, killing one person. He has appealed the conviction and the death sentence.</p>

<p>Although Sri Lanka hands down death sentences, no one has been executed since 1976.</p>
