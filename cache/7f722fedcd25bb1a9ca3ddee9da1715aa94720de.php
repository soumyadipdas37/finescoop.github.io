<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>WHAT IS IT?</p>

<p>The Smithson Investment Trust is the newest fund to be launched by Fundsmith, the firm founded by lauded stock picker Terry Smith.</p>

<p>As the name might suggest, it is smaller than Smith's gargantuan Fundsmith Equity fund, and focuses on small and mid-sized companies around the world.</p>

<p>It is not run day-to-day by Smith himself, but rather by Simon Barnard and Will Morgan.</p>

<p>Top holdings include tonic firm Fevertree, US tech firm Verisk Analytics, online estate agent Rightmove and Domino's Pizza</p>

<p>WHAT DOES IT INVEST IN?</p>

<p>The fund invests savers' money for the long term, in a portfolio of around 25-40 companies. It follows Smith's well-tested technique of focusing on good-quality companies which stand to grow in the future.</p>

<p>Top holdings include tonic firm Fevertree, US tech firm Verisk Analytics, online estate agent Rightmove and Domino's Pizza.</p>

<p>WHAT DO THE EXPERTS LIKE?</p>

<p>Patrick Thomas, investment director at Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, says the trust has an 'excellent team, consistent process and performance has been stellar'.</p>

<p>ANY DOWNSIDES?</p>

<p>Thomas says the shares often trade at a premium to the value of the fund's underlying assets, meaning it could be seen as expensive.</p>
