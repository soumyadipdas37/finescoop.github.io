<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cineworld shares rose nearly 5 per cent after the cinema chain's boss said it had seen a number of sold-out screenings and that summer blockbuster Tenet had triggered a much-needed surge in bookings.</p>

<p>Chief executive Mooky Greidinger said the company was 'very pleasantly surprised' by the number of people who had bought tickets since cinemas reopened after lockdown.</p>

<p>The chain has been hammered by the pandemic which has led to many movie studios delaying the release of major blockbusters, such as the new Bond movie, or sending them straight to streaming networks. </p>

<p>Cineworld said pre-bookings for the new Christopher Nolan film Tenet were in demand</p>

<p>Its UK sites have been reopening throughout August and around 200 of 550 cinemas in the US – where it owns the Regal chain – are up and running.</p>

<p>Greidinger said a number of screenings, which socially distanced audiences, had been sold out.</p>

<p>And Cineworld said pre-bookings for the new Christopher Nolan film Tenet were 'tracking at a similar level to that of a blockbuster released pre-Covid' before it was released on Wednesday.</p>
