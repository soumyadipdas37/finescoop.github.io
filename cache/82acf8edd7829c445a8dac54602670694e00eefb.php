<p>Brave: On Tuesday, Ali Oetjen (pictured) broke down in tears in an emotional video on her Instagram page as she vowed to show fans 'all parts' of her emotions - even at her lowest points</p>

<p>'You always see happy me. This is me today &amp; has been my daily occurrence since my breakup,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'It’s bloody slow healing, sadness &amp; hurt fill my whole body. Meditation, Yoga, exercise, nature, cooking, family, friends and focusing on my goals allows for my peaceful spirit to just be.</p>

<p>'I’ve never experienced anything like this where my soul still feels connected, I still love but know we don’t align.'</p>

<p>'I want to share this to inspire strength in you, as you do me, because I know you’re also going through a break up or you’re finding it extremely tough atm in these huge world changes &amp; darkness we’re being exposed too,' she continued. </p>

<p>'WE ARE GROWING STRONGER, AWAKENING to PURGE THE HATRED &amp; are ASCENDING to be FREED FROM CONDITIONAL PATTERNS &amp; CAN THEN BE DIRECTED BY OUR SOULS.'</p>

<p>So sad: Alongside heartbreaking footage of herself wiping tears from her mascara-stained eyes, the 34-year-old admitted she 'still loves' her ex - but added that she 'knows we don't align' </p>

<p>She signed off with the message: 'We’re all equal beings &amp; hopefully by now waking up to our true essence, our true nature which is only LOVE. </p>

<p>'When you follow me, view my pics/vids/see me on the street, look into my soul as I do yours &amp; know we’re the same.' </p>

<p>The video comes just weeks after the couple made the break-up announcement at the end of July.</p>
