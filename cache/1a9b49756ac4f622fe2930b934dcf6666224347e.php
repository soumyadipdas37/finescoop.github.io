<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has become an official resident of Monaco, joining a host of other tycoons to relocate to the tax haven.</p>

<p>The city state on the French Riviera is listed as the 67-year-old's main home, replacing Hampshire, according to filings published by Companies House this week.</p>

<p>Ratcliffe, a high-profile supporter of Brexit, is the founder of chemicals giant Ineos and boasts an estimated fortune of £12.2billion.</p>

<p>On the move: Billionaire Ineos fouder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has become an official resident of Monaco</p>

<p>He ranks as the UK's fifth-richest person, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, and owns sports clubs, including cycling's Team Sky.</p>

<p>His relocation to Monaco was first reported in 2018 – the same year he was knighted by the Queen for 'services to business and to investment'. </p>

<p>But it was claimed last year that plans for Ratcliffe and two other Ineos bosses to become tax residents of Monaco had sparked a rift with auditor PwC.</p>

<p>The relocation is thought to have saved the trio as much as £4billion. </p>

<p>But reports of the disagreement with PwC are said to have contributed to a 'breakdown' in the relationship later on between the firm and Ineos, which later sacked it and appointed rival Deloitte instead. </p>

<p>Before he left for Monaco, Ratcliffe was reportedly the third-biggest individual taxpayer in the UK, making an annual contribution of £110million to Treasury coffers.</p>

<p>He has used some of his fortune to splash out on a £91million expedition ship called Sherpa – which is designed to travel to extreme locations – and a £115million luxury yacht, dubbed Hampshire II.</p>

<p>Monaco is home to Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green , Matalan founder John Hargreaves, billionaire brothers David and Simon Reuben and Yorkshire mobility tycoon John Jakes</p>

<p>Ratcliffe is not the only wealthy Briton to move to Monaco in recent years. Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green is also another well-known resident, as well as Matalan founder John Hargreaves, billionaire brothers David and Simon Reuben and Yorkshire mobility tycoon John Jakes.</p>

<p>Sir James Dyson, inventor and Britain's richest man, was also reported last year to have become a permanent resident in Singapore after buying the country's most expensive penthouse for £42million. </p>

<p>He had earlier announced his company was moving its headquarters from Britain to Singapore because of the growing importance of markets in Asia. </p>

<p>But moves by Ratcliffe and others to tax havens have previously been condemned by MPs as 'obscene' and 'deeply cynical'.</p>

<p>Yesterday former Public Accounts Committee chairman Dame Margaret Hodge said: 'It seems Jim Ratcliffe is so rich he can't afford to pay his taxes.</p>

<p>'While his tax contributions to the public purse will be missed, I'm not sure the same can be said about him.'</p>

<p>An Ineos spokesman said: 'We don't comment on the personal details of our directors and employees.'</p>
