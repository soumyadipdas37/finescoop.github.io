<p>The winger scored a try during his first touch of the match, before turning it into a double in a fairytale debut for the 20-year-old.</p>

<p>His mum had to hide her tears behind her sunglasses as she celebrated her son's proud achievement during his first time on the field.</p>

<p>But the emotional moment didn't go unnoticed by the Fox News team's eagle-eye commentators. </p>

<p>'You work so hard as a kid and you dream, your only dream as a young fella is to play first grade,' Fox League commentator Braith Anasta said.</p>

<p>'It's your parents who get you there. They support you. They invest in you. You are their life. Then you're on debut at WIN Stadium and you come up with two first half tries.' </p>

<p>He said it gave him goosebumps.  </p>

<p>But the rookie's third attempt at a try was disallowed by referees after being deemed offside.</p>

<p>His mother's anger at the referee's decision was also caught on film.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Stojanov broke down again during a half time chat with Fox League sideline reporter Hannah Hollis. </p>

<p>'Cody has worked so hard. It takes a village to raise a child, but Cody has done a lot himself too,' she told Fox Sports.</p>

<p>'March was the last time I have seen Cody because of COVID-19. We message each other every day.'</p>

<p>'His dream's come true. And he's out there doing what he loves. It's amazing. It's just amazing. And everyone is here to celebrate with him.'   </p>

<p>Ramsey had a total of 57 friends and family watching his NRL debut.</p>
