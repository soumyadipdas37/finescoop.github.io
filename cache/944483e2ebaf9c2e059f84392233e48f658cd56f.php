<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wild weather is threatening to wreak havoc across large parts of central Australia bringing heavy rain, flash flooding and destructive winds over the weekend.</p>

<p>A massive cut-off low pressure system sitting on the southern border of Western and South Australia will start pelting down rain on Friday and continue throughout the weekend as it moves east.</p>

<p>Severe weather warnings are in place for South Australia, southeast parts of the Northern Territory, southwest Queensland and northwest parts of Victoria. </p>

<p>Western areas of New South Wales are also urged to stay alert for severe thunderstorms. </p>

<p>Large parts of central Australia are being warned of heavy rainfall, flash flooding destructive winds and large to giant hail</p>

<p>'There is a large low pressure system that is dragging a lot of pressure from the north to the south,' Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Grace Legge told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'We will see steady rainfall over the next 24 to 48 hours. But embedded in that, we will also seeing thunderstorms which will bring quite significant rainfall in a very short period of time which could lead to flash flooding.'</p>

<p>Some areas could see more than their average Spring rainfall in just a couple of days.</p>

<p>Over 50mm of rain is expected in parts of inland Australia, where the average annual rainfall is normally about 200mm.     </p>

<p>This could cause roads to be cut off making some communities inaccessible.  </p>

<p>'We have a warning for parts of southwest Queensland in place on Friday and there is a chance we might get thunderstorms that bring large to giant hail,' Ms Legge said.  </p>

<p>There are severe thunderstorm warnings in place for the southwest of Queensland</p>

<p>There are severe thunderstorm warnings in place for the northwest of Victoria</p>

<p>Destructive wind gusts of over 100km/h will lash South Australia and the Northern Territory tonight, bringing severe downpours.</p>

<p>On Saturday, regional Victorians in the northeast of the state are being warned to stay indoors with 10-20mm of rain expected fall. </p>

<p>The State Emergency Service is advising residents who may travel or camp over the weekend to monitor conditions.</p>

<p>'We encourage people to avoid setting up camp under trees or on low-lying areas alongside creeks or rivers,' Commander David Tucek said.</p>

<p>He said residents should clean their gutters, downpipes and drains to prevent blockages and clear loose items from backyards.  </p>

<p>The build up of moisture is also set to wreak havoc on the western half of NSW tomorrow with severe thunderstorms.</p>

<p>On Saturday, regional Victorians in the northeast of the state are being warned to stay indoors with 10-20mm of rain expected fall (pictured: rain disrupts commuters in Geelong)</p>

<p>But the east coasts capital cities are likely to avoid the worst of the wild weather. </p>

<p>'The more significant rainfall probably won't make it to the east coast capitals like Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne,' Ms Legge said.</p>

<p>'But on Sunday we will see that rainfall heads to the coast, but it will have lost a lot of its power by then.</p>

<p>'However, Canberra could see about 10mm of rain.'</p>

<p>Although low pressure systems usually mean a cold snap, on this occasion, it might actually get warmer. </p>

<p>'It will actually increase the temperature, It's a very warm air mass and a lot of the areas will probably experience quite muggy, humid temperatures,' Ms Legge said.   </p>

<p>The system is expected to ease late on Sunday before it then moves offshore.  </p>

<p>'The more significant rainfall probably won't make it to the east coast capitals like Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne,' Ms Legge said</p>
