<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Competition for work during the COVID-19 pandemic is seeing thousands of hopefuls apply for the same job. </p>

<p>One employment ad on Seek for a dishwasher in Sydney saw over 6,000 applicants, while a position for someone to hand out flyers on the street prompted almost 2,800 responses. </p>

<p>A Sydney woman who applied for the role doing street promotion spoke candidly about her struggles trying to find work during the coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>One role Ms Perkins hoped to get (job ad pictured) received about 2,800 applicants alone</p>

<p>Karen Perkins is currently receiving JobSeeker after her business was derailed by the pandemic and she's now applying for up to 30 positions a month.</p>

<p>But with so much many other also applying for the same job, she told Daily Mail Australia the process is becoming increasingly disheartening.   </p>

<p>'I have a medical condition and have partial work capacity which restricts me from working full time. I'm also in my 50s,' Ms Perkins said.</p>

<p>'I was applying for a few office and administration jobs prior to COVID and there were about 100 to 200 applicants per job.</p>

<p>'But in the month of August it's was least 600 or higher for every job.'</p>

<p>One job ad posted online showed over 6000 Sydneysiders applied for a role as a dishwasher</p>

<p>For the past decade Ms Perkins had been running a successful business called Clear and Clutterfree as a professional organiser.</p>

<p>The interesting and unusual profession was made famous by the Japanese Tidying Up queen Marie Kondo in her smash hit Netflix show.</p>

<p>'I help people set up for success and bring a bit of organisation in their home or office,' Ms Perkins said.</p>

<p>She learned art of tidying up while working for the Salvation Army.  </p>

<p>Ms Perkins would often be called out to collect items from homes which had been gathering dust in the corner.</p>

<p>She became so good at deciding what to keep and where to put it, others starting calling on her services professionally. </p>

<p>'The work tends to be very one-off and sporadic, but I was getting regular inquiries and clients', she said.</p>

<p>But since the onset of the coronavirus, her business has been decimated.</p>

<p>But despite the strain on the jobs market, official ABS unemployment figures recently improved, dropping from 7.5 per cent in July to 6.8 per cent in August.</p>

<p>Ms Perkings said in the past two weeks she has noticed the number of job applicants for each role have declined, but she's not convinced the situation is actually getting any better.</p>

<p>'I think people are just giving up because they're tired of seeing these high numbers,' she said.</p>

<p>'They think what's the point, the competition is too high.'</p>

<p>With so much competition to find work, Ms perkins said the hunt to find work is becoming increasingly disheartening</p>
