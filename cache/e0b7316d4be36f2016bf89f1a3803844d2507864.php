<p>The United captain was in attendance with his brother (front) and younger sister Daisy (back left), who was also allegedly caught up in the unsavoury scenes out in Mykonos</p>

<p>Maguire kept his fans up to date on his whereabouts by uploading his Old Trafford view to his two million followers on Instagram.</p>

<p>Writing a caption alongside the image, Maguire wrote: 'Great event as always.'</p>

<p>It is the first time Maguire has been seen in public since his arrest in Greece on the holiday island of Mykonos.</p>

<p>Maguire shared updates from his view in the main stand at Old Trafford during the match</p>

<p>The defender was ejected from Gareth Southgate's England squad as a result, and is missing UEFA Nations League fixtures with the national side.</p>

<p>Maguire has appealed his convictions and will face a full retrial after his legal team filed an appeal against the decisions last week.</p>

<p>In a statement printed in Greek publication Protothema, one of the arresting officers on the night of the scrap recalled Mr Maguire, 27, launching a torrent of abuse as he was placed under arrest.</p>

<p>The statement alleges Mr Maguire shouted: 'F*** you all, f*** off, f*** the Greek police, f*** policemen, f*** Greece, f*** the Greek civilisation, I don't give a s***'.</p>

<p>The statement adds that Maguire, 'attacked the sergeant... he pushed him away and kicked him in the right leg causing swelling of his left and right tibia.'</p>

<p>Maguire posted updates on his social media pages to keep his two million followers clued up</p>

<p>England boss Southgate has however promised Maguire a quick return to the England squad next month as he revealed they have been in constant contact.</p>

<p>'I think we've talked right the way through very openly and honestly, and, of course, Harry would prefer to be here with the team,' said Southgate.</p>

<p>'He wants to play football and he wants to be part of it. </p>

<p>'But I think with everything that's gone on in his life in the last couple of weeks it was so important that he's been able to let everything just calm down, get some more time on holiday. He hasn't really had any sort of a break.'</p>
