<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Alistair Overeem has blasted speculation over a potential Brock Lesnar return to the UFC as the heavyweight questioned whether anyone would care about a comeback by the WWE icon.</p>

<p>Rumours have been rife that Lesnar, 43, could make a sensational return to the sport after his contract with WWE expired, as Jon Jones called out the former heavyweight champion for a tantalising matchup.Â </p>

<p>But UFC veteran Overeem, 40, who defeated the WWE star in 2011, has slammed talk of Lesnar returning to the sport for the first time in four years.</p>

<p>Alistair Overeem has blasted talk of a UFC return for Brock Lesnar amid Jon Jones rumours</p>

<p>Lesnar's WWE contract has expired and Jones has called the old heavyweight champion out</p>

<p>'He's 43 years old. To be honest, I don't think he's gonna come back,' he told TMZ Sport via The Sun.</p>

<p>'The last time he came back, it was a debacle so I don't think he's gonna come back.</p>

<p>'I was wrong about the last time though, because I predicted the same thing. It actually did become a debacle, but we'll see what happens.'</p>

<p>Overeem is referring to Lesnar's comeback in 2016, when he faced Mark Hunt at UFC 200 in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>The 43-year-old made a return to the sport in 2016 when he faced Mark Hunt at UFC 200</p>

<p>But Overeem, who defeated Lesnar in 2011, says no one would care for a Lesnar return</p>

<p>The 43-year-old defeated the Super Samoan with ease, but the fight was made a no-contest after the WWE star failed a pre and post-fight drug test.</p>

<p>Lesnar was also close to making a UFC return two years ago, when he entered the octagon to promote a potential bout with former heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier after UFC 226, but a fight never materialised.</p>

<p>Dana White has revealed that he would be interested in arranging a fight between Lesnar and Jones if both fighters are interested, but Overeem is adamant that very few would care about a Lesnar return.</p>

<p>'Who cares about Brock? Which fans? He's not coming back. He's 43 years old, he's flunked tests, it's over with him.</p>

<p>'He's not coming back. Last time they waived the testing for him and still he got into trouble. It's been a debacle. He's not gonna come back.</p>

<p>'Listen, if he does, all hats off to him, but I don't think he's gonna come back.'</p>
