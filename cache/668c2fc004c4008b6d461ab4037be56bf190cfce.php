<p>The Gunners are determined to sign the 22-year-old this summer and will reportedly raise their dismissed £32million offer to £36.5m with a further £9m in bonuses in a hope to secure the creative midfielder.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, who has made 130 appearances for Lyon, is paramount to Mikel Arteta's plans as he looks to deploy his team in a 4-3-3 formation this season.</p>

<p>Arsenal are already preparing a significantly improved second bid for target Houssem Aouar</p>

<p>Despite rejecting their opening offer, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas suggested that the club would be open to selling Aouar for the right price.</p>

<p>He Tweeted: 'For Houssem Arsenal is too far from his value: we are counting on him to play a great match in Lorient and lead OL in CL next year.'</p>

<p>The 22-year-old attacking midfielder will be vital to Mikel Arteta's 4-3-3 formation this season</p>

<p>Their initial £32million offer was rejected by Ligue 1 side Lyon's president earlier this week</p>

<p>Aouar has been previously valued at £54m but it is believed the Ligue 1 side will lower their asking price amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to football.london. </p>

<p>Aouar is reportedly keen to depart the Ligue 1 club before the end of the transfer window, meaning any deal must be completed before the deadline on October 5. </p>

<p>The France youth international has been successful at Lyon, registering nine goals and 10 assists in 41 club appearances during the 2019-20 season. </p>

<p>The youngster also played a vital role in their run to the Champions League semi-final last season. </p>

<p>Arteta will be hoping Aouar will help improve Arsenal's disappointing eighth place Premier League finish last season.  </p>
