<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A chef has revealed how she scored the 'best markdown of all time' after she purchased $46 worth of roast pork for just 20 cents at Coles.</p>

<p>The woman, from Victoria, said she was in the middle of lining up to pay for her grocery when she noticed an employee slashing the prices off the hot food.</p>

<p>So she wondered over to the shelf assuming the two $23 pork roasts were reduced down to $10 each - but she was stunned to find a 10 cent price tag upon closer inspection.</p>

<p>'I was there just before closing and I was waiting in the line to pay for other items as she marked them down,' she wrote in Markdown Addicts Australia Facebook page.</p>

<p>'From far, I thought they were marked down to $10 and I was like sweet, I'll grab one. Then bam, they where 10 cents each so grabbed them both. One of my best scores.'</p>

<p>A chef has revealed how she scored the 'best markdown of all time' after she purchased two $23 pork roasts for just 10 cents each at Coles </p>

<p>She explained the roasts were heavily discounted because her supermarket has been shutting early every night due to strict stage four COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

<p>'They were reduced to that price because in Melbourne, our supermarkets close at 7.30pm at the moment,' she said.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Coles for comment.</p>

<p>The woman shared her bargain buy on social media, with many shoppers praising her for snapping up the 'best bargain ever' at the 'right time, right place'.</p>

<p>'Wow! Best I've got on one of those roasts was about $8 and even that is a bargain. Good score,' one woman said, while another added: 'That's nuts. Great score! Cheapest I've paid is $5.'</p>

<p>Thrifty shoppers have been raving on social media about how they've managed to slash hundreds of dollars off their grocery bills just by shopping at the right times</p>

<p>Some who were stunned by the discount asked: 'Is this a misprint?' while others said: 'It has to be a mistake.'</p>

<p>However, not everyone was on board with the sale, with one woman saying: I'd be so skeptical on why they are 10 cents. </p>

<p>'I probably wouldn't of brought them just for that reason. It's just too good to be true, hope you're not paying for it tomorrow. If you aren't, well good on you for the score.'</p>

<p>Another shopper said: 'Assuming they have sat in those warmer for so long... if it doesn't make you sick, good score, if it does, well it was 10 cents.'</p>

<p>But the woman reassured everyone there was 'nothing wrong' with the heavily discounted roast pork when she took them home to eat. </p>

<p>Supermarkets tend to discount items progressively through the day, with 20, 40, 60, 80 and eventually 99 per cent slashed off the retail prices of popular items.</p>

<p>There are no set time-of-day for markdowns as products go out of date constantly - but some supermarket employees suggest the best times to shop are either around 11am and 4pm.</p>
