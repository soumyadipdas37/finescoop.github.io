<p>Just the two of us: Pixie Lott enjoyed some quality time with her fiancé Oliver Cheshire as they enjoyed a road trip to Cornwall in a flashy Ferrari on Wednesday</p>

<p>Opting for comfort, the blonde went barefoot as she posed on the hood of the stylish car.</p>

<p>The Mama Do hitmaker looked naturally radiant as she wore minimal make-up, and wore her tresses in its curly state.</p>

<p>Model Oliver, 32, meanwhile, cut an effortlessly cool figure in a black denim jacket and a baseball cap.</p>

<p>Radiant: The singer, 29, ensured all eyes were on her as she caught the eye in a flirty floral print mini-dress, complete with a low-cut neckline</p>

<p>Better safe than sorry! Later in the day, the musician uploaded an Instagram photo of herself wearing a face shield</p>

<p>Pixie, who has won The Voice Kids twice as a coach, recently revealed she's hoping to have a 'big family' as she admitted having her own brood means everything to her.</p>

<p>However, the singer is waiting for the right time as she is currently focused on marrying her long-term partner after a nearly four-year engagement. </p>

<p>The wedding to her model beau has been affected due to the coronavirus pandemic, so they have decided to wait and resume planning when lockdown restrictions have lifted completely.</p>

<p>Having fun: Earlier in the week, the curly-haired beauty appeared in great spirits as she joined a friend on the beach</p>

<p>'Had the worst time!' The media personality toasted to her staycation with refreshing beverages in a beaming photo, alongside a sarcastic caption</p>

<p>She said in an interview with The Sun:  'I’m a big family girl, a very big family girl. Family is everything for me so I would love to have my own family when I can find the time. When the time is right I would love that. It’s such an amazing thing to have. </p>

<p>'We were planning to have our wedding this year and now ­everything is so up in the air, we’ve just delayed it.</p>

<p>'There’s still a lot of planning behind the scenes but we are waiting for the time there are no restrictions and rules, because we don’t really want to have that on the special day.'  </p>
