<p>She also wore a low-cut white dress and showed off her lovely sin, before panning a bit to reveal Joshua driving.</p>

<p>'Mum &amp; Dad,' she captioned the clip, and the two looked as if they were heading out for a picnic with their four-month-old daughter Janie, whom Jodie gave birth to in April. </p>

<p>A representative for the couple told People at the time: 'Both mother and baby are happy and healthy.' </p>

<p>Days after the statement was released, Jodie announced the big news herself, gushing on Twitter that, 'i'm a mother!' </p>

<p>Bumping along nicely: She welcomed daughter Janie with spouse Joshua Jackson back in April; pictured together in February in London</p>

<p>Last month, Jodie opened up about the stresses of raising a newborn.</p>

<p>She posted a short selfie video captioned, 'what is it about the sound of your baby crying that drains you of energy??'</p>

<p>The Neon Demon actress added, 'feel like i ran a marathon today — that delirious feeling of pride in your accomplishment and also like where is the nearest hole to crawl inside and sleep till next year?'  </p>

<p>Earlier this week Joshua affectionately posted a social media snapshot of his wife breastfeeding their firstborn child.</p>

<p>The acting couple were first linked in 2018. They were seen wearing wedding rings back in November, but it wasn't until December that they confirmed they had secretly wed. </p>
