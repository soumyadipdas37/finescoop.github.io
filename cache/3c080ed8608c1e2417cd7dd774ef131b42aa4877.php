<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona are reportedly monitoring the situation of Real Sociedad striker Willian Jose as they eye replacements for the outbound Luis Suarez.</p>

<p>The Spanish giants have endured a frustrating summer transfer window after struggling in their pursuits of both Lautaro Martinez and then Memphis Depay, who was viewed as a cheaper option.</p>

<p>And according to Spanish publication Sport, Barcelona are now looking at Jose as an alternative to both Martinez and Depay.</p>

<p>Willian Jose has once again emerged as a transfer target for Spanish giants Barcelona</p>

<p>Barcelona were interested in his signature in the January transfer window and could make a move for him again this summer.</p>

<p>A deal for Jose would reportedly cost Barcelona, who have endured a turbulent summer amid the Lionel Messi transfer saga and their finances taking a hit due to coronavirus, around £28m.</p>

<p>Barcelona's sporting director Ramon Planes is a huge admirer of the Real Sociedad striker and is behind the club's push for his services. </p>

<p>Barcelona had pursued Inter Milan's Lautaro Martinez but his price tag proved too much</p>

<p>Jose has a hefty release clause inserted in his Real Sociedad deal of £64m but they would be reportedly willing to lower his valuation to around £28m.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old Brazilian moved to Real Sociedad back in 2016, and has featured 149 times for the club.</p>

<p>During his four years in Spain, Jose has scored 56 goals and provided 14 assists for his Real Sociedad team-mates. </p>

<p>The Nou Camp outfit have also struggled in their pursuit of Lyon forward Memphis Depay</p>
