<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gary Lineker has appeared to shrug off the new BBC director-general's warning to employees to cut out political tweeting.</p>

<p>The vocal Match of the Day presenter suggested he was not worried by Tim Davie's anti-bias drive, which seems to have landed with many of his colleagues who have reined in their social media. </p>

<p>He replied 'nah' in response to suggestions he should be 'terrified' of the clampdown.</p>

<p>Mr Davie is planning a radical shake-up of the national broadcaster to dispel bruising accusations of partiality that dogged his predecessor and have thrown the BBC's future into question.</p>

<p>In a debut speech yesterday he said: 'If you want to be an opinionated columnist or a partisan campaigner on social media then that is a valid choice, but you should not be working at the BBC.'</p>

<p>Gary Lineker (pictured on a video stressing the benefits of refugees) has appeared to shrug off the new BBC director-general's warning to employees to cut out political tweeting in an anti-bias dive</p>

<p>Mr Davie is planning a radical shake-up of the national broadcaster to dispel bruising accusations of partiality that dogged his predecessor and have thrown the BBC's future into question</p>

<p>His impartiality drive had been widely reported before he took charge and many BBC journalists, typically active on social media, rowed back their tweeting. </p>

<p>Yet Lineker, who was on a £1.75million salary but has offered to take a pay cut, has ploughed ahead with tweeting politicised content which has recently centered on his support for refugees.</p>

<p>Migrant numbers has long been a thorny issue and ministers have been grappling with record numbers of Channel crossings this summer.</p>

<p>Lineker yesterday posted a video stressing the benefits of refugees to British society, and even revealed he would be prepared to have one with live with him.</p>

<p>He retweeted a message which read: 'It's easier not to talk about this subject due to far-right Twitter's constant attacks. But we must. Truth must outweigh perception &amp; prejudice.'</p>

<p>He replied 'nah' in response to suggestions he should be 'terrified' of the clampdown</p>

<p>The post came before Mr Davie's hard-hitting speech, but Lineker later appeared to brush aside the new director-general's warning.</p>

<p>Referencing a Telegraph column arguing Lineker should be 'terrified of Tim Davie's speech', one journalist at the paper tweeted the ex-England star and said it 'must be a double pants moment' for him - to which Lineker replied 'nah.' </p>

<p>This week, he also took a swipe at Donald Trump, claiming 'he's a few tins short of 57 varieties.'</p>

<p>Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told MailOnline: 'I think licence fee payers will be shocked the Gary Linkeker is the highest remunerated person employed by the BBC.</p>

<p>'If Gary Lineker wants to get in to politics as he seems to inspire to do so, then he's perfectly entitled to do that. </p>

<p>'But I can promise it doesn't pay as well as working for the BBC. He'll have to be prepared to take a huge pay cut!' </p>

<p>He also said the online anti-bias drive does not go far enough to tackle the fundamental flaws blighting the Corporation.</p>

<p>The MP said: 'I think that Tim Davie's plan to prevent BBC employees expressing political opinions on social media is a step in the right direction, but that will never in itself remove the intrinsic and entrenched political bias in the organisation.'</p>

<p>Mr Davie's remarks followed controversies over impartiality, including Newsnight host Emily Maitlis sparking a furore with a monologue on the Dominic Cummings lockdown row.  </p>

<p>The BBC later said the episode 'did not meet our standards of due impartiality'.</p>

<p>BBC Breakfast host Naga Munchetty was also rebuked last year after commenting on remarks made by US President Donald Trump. </p>
