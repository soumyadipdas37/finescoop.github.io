<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prince Harry has paid back the £2.4 million of taxpayers' money he and Meghan Markle used to renovate Frogmore Cottage thanks to the multi-million pound Netflix deal struck by the couple.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Duke of Sussex today confirmed he had paid the bill in full by making a contribution to the Sovereign Grant.</p>

<p>The payment was made possible thanks to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's new Netflix deal, reportedly worth some $150m, a source said.</p>

<p>Harry's spokesman said: 'A contribution has been made to the Sovereign Grant by the Duke of Sussex.</p>

<p>'This contribution as originally offered by Prince Harry has fully covered the necessary renovation costs of Frogmore Cottage, a property of Her Majesty The Queen, and will remain the UK residence of the duke and his family.'</p>

<p>Prince Harry has paid back the £2.4 million of taxpayers' money he and Meghan Markle used to renovate Frogmore Cottage thanks to the multi-million pound Netflix deal struck by the couple</p>

<p>Last year's royal accounts showed the cost of the renovations at the cottage - paid for from taxpayers' money - was £2.4 million</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan agreed to pay back the money as part of the plans drawn up when they quit as senior working royals in March.</p>

<p>The couple signed a high-profile deal with streaming giant Netflix last week for their new yet-to-be-named production company to make documentaries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming.</p>

<p>A documentary on Princess Diana could be included among the haul, it was claimed over the weekend, though Royal sources have warned it could 'fuel tensions between Harry and William'. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess said they planned to create programmes that 'inform but also give hope' and make 'impactful content that unlocks action'.</p>

<p>The couple, who are now living in Los Angeles, are expected to concentrate on behind-the-camera roles as producers rather than necessarily star themselves.  </p>

<p>The deal intensified calls for Harry and Meghan to pay back the seven-figure sum spent sprucing up Frogmore Cottage and now it appears the pair have bowed to the growing pressure.</p>

<p>The house was extensively renovated for the couple after their marriage in May 2018, with the intention of it being a family home for son Archie.</p>

<p>But they have since left to live in America, where they have purchased a £14.7million mansion in California.</p>
