<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Novak Djokovic's former manager believes that Roger Federer would not have been disqualified for hitting a line-judge in the same manner that the Serb did at the US Open on Sunday. </p>

<p>The world number one shocked the world of tennis as he was kicked out of the tournament for accidentally hitting a ball at line judge Laura Clark in a moment of frustration during the first set against Pablo Carreno Busta.</p>

<p>Clark keeled over after being struck in the throat and the tournament favourite was defaulted after consultation with officials. But Niki Pilic, who used to manage the 33-year-old, believes there is no chance that 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer would have received the same punishment and accused Clark of 'acting a little.' </p>

<p>World No 1 Novak Djokovic was disqualified from the US Open after hitting a line judge</p>

<p>Djokovic inadvertently struck official Laura Clark in the throat on Sunday in the fourth round</p>

<p>Yet Djokovic's ex-manager believes Roger Federer would have got away with a similar incident </p>

<p>'In my opinion, Novak Djokovic accidentally hit the line-judge with the ball,' Pilic told the Serbian press. </p>

<p>'I think he should have been punished with a confiscated game. It is not right to disqualify the first in the world because of this.</p>

<p>'I believe that the judge also acted a little, I don't think she was so hurt.</p>

<p>'Do you think Roger Federer would be kicked out for something like this? No chance. This decision is tendentious.' </p>

<p>Pilic's comments come days after some fans said Federer was not penalised at all for a similar incident at the 2006 Australian Open.  </p>

<p>Djokovic is currently three short of Federer's record-haul of 20 Grand Slam men's singles titles</p>

<p>After his first serve was called out, Federer swung his racket behind his back and inadvertently hit a ball boy at the side of the net.</p>

<p>The Swiss star didn't receive a code violation and the situation was also laughed off by the ball boy at the time.</p>

<p>However, fans have since brought that incident again as they have been comparing it to the Djokovic saga from the past week. </p>

<p>One fan simply said: 'If Federer did what Djokovic did he wouldn't be disqualified. The ATP hates to see Djokovic win.'</p>

<p>Swiss star Federer struck a ball boy accidentally at the Australian Open 14 years ago</p>

<p>Federer swung his racket from behind before hitting the ball boy (circled in yellow) </p>

<p>The incident involving Federer back in 2006 was laughed off by everyone court-side</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'I'm not the biggest Djokovic fan but I would 100% agree that there was no anger or malice in that incident. </p>

<p>'I can't believe the extent of his punishment. I also agree that had that been Federer it would have been a totally different outcome.' </p>

<p>Yet with Djokovic's disqualification, the US Open men's singles draw is wide open ahead of the semi-finals on Friday. </p>

<p>Busta, who was the beneficiary of Djokovic's default, plays Alexander Zverev, while third seed Daniil Medvedev takes on second seed Dominic Thiem in the second semi-final as all four players bid to win their first major title. </p>
