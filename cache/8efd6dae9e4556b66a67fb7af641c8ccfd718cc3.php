<p>I'm pleased to read of the 63-year-old pharmacy employee who won £15,000 in compensation after being taunted at work by her fellow workers about her hearing loss.</p>

<p>Everyone keeps going on and on about the new James Bond trailer — and how great Daniel Craig, 52, looks for his age. </p>

<p>Maybe he does, but if I were him I'd wish everyone didn't keep saying that.</p>

<p>Christa D'Souza (pictured) wonders why 52 can't just look great on its own</p>

<p>Why the qualification? Can't 52 just look great on its own? No, of course not, what am I thinking in this youth-obsessed world we live in? </p>

<p>There has been a lot of fuss about who will be cast as the next Bond, for this is Craig's last go, and a hodge-podge of names — Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston and Richard Madden among them — have been touted as future 007s.</p>

<p>The movie industry, despite its rampant ageism, likes to think of itself as 'woke', and as such there are a few female candidates in the offing, including Jodie 'Killing Eve' Comer. </p>

<p>Would they really do that? Have a female Bond? Probably not.</p>

<p>But mark my words, it is more likely the next Bond will be female than someone who could be described as looking 'great for their age'.</p>

<p>Weirdly the industry is much more squeamish about age than it ever was before.</p>

<p>Roger Moore was 58 when he did his last Bond. Idris Elba is a frontrunner, yes, but he is 48. Bet you a fiver it won't be him.</p>
