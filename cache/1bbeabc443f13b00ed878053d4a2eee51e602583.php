<p>John Stones wants to stay at Manchester City and fight for his place in Pep Guardiola's side</p>

<p>Stones has lost his spot in the City starting line-up and played just 16 league matches last term</p>

<p>But according to the Telegraph, Stones will not be seeking a move away from the Etihad Stadium this summer and hopes to win back the trust of Guardiola.</p>

<p>The Spanish coach has already added to his defensive ranks this term with the £41million signing of Nathan Ake from Bournemouth.</p>

<p>With Stones behind the likes of Aymeric Laporte, Eric Garcia, Fernandinho and Nicolas Otamendi in the centre-back pecking order at Manchester City, that move looked to push Stones one step closer to the Etihad exit door. </p>

<p>Chelsea were reportedly keen on Stones' services but the Blues have signed Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr this summer as defensive reinforcements.</p>

<p>Stones has been linked to Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham but looks set to stay in Manchester</p>

<p>The 26-year-old has also lost his spot in Gareth Southgate's England squad over the past year</p>

<p>Stones was also linked with a move to Arsenal and a reunion with former City assistant coach Mikel Arteta, but the Gunners opted to go for Lille defender Gabriel Magalhaes while William Saliba has returned from a loan spell at Saint-Etienne. </p>

<p>The English defender arrived at City from Everton in 2016 for £50million which made him the second most-expensive Premier League defender at the time. </p>

<p>The 26-year-old has since made 133 appearances in all competitions for Guardiola's side and has won two Premier League titles, two League Cups and one FA Cup triumph. </p>

<p>He has also been capped 39 times for England and was part of the Three Lions squads that finished in third-place at the 2018 World Cup and the 2019 Nations League finals. </p>
