<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A teenager has been arrested after he allegedly imported almost $190,000 worth of methamphetamine hidden in coffee sachets sent from Malaysia</p>

<p>The 19-year-old is now behind bars after being arrested at his home in Booragoon in Perth's south on Tuesday and charged with importing 93 grams of ice.</p>

<p>Australian Border Force officers allegedly found a white crystal-like substance hidden in the sachets in an air cargo consignment which allegedly returned a positive result to the drug.</p>

<p>AFP officers then swapped the contents of the package and after the delivery was made they searched the teenager's home, allegedly finding it in his bedroom. </p>

<p>A 19-year-old is behind bars after he allegedly imported 93 grams of methamphetamines into Perth from Malaysia </p>

<p>The teenager allegedly ordered the drugs that had been hidden in coffee sachets</p>

<p>The 19-year-old was charged with attempting to possess a marketable quantity of unlawfully imported border controlled drugs and could face a maximum of 25 years in jail.</p>

<p>At the end of last month another man from Perth was charged with importing 114 grams of meth from Malaysia.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old allegedly hid the drugs inside a bottle of cooling powder.</p>

<p>AFP Detective Superintendent Tim Underhill said the drugs seized both had an extremely high street value. </p>

<p>'These two seizures equate to more than two thousand street level deals of the drug, which are currently being sold for $200 each,' he said.</p>

<p>'This means the sale of 95 grams would have netted approximately $190,000 in street deals, while 114 grams was worth $228,000. </p>

<p>'Methamphetamine causes harm, not only to users and the people in contact with them, but to the broader community, because drugs are a key factor in a range of serious criminal offending.'</p>

<p>The 35-year-old is in custody and will appear in court on September 25.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old was due to face court on Wednesday. </p>

<p>At the end of last month another man from Perth was charged with importing 114 grams of meth from Malaysia after the drugs were allegedly found in a cooling powder container</p>

<p>The 35-year-old will face court on September 25 after allegedly importing the drugs</p>
