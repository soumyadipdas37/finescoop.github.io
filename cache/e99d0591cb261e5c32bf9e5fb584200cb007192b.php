<p>'But we have talked about getting married. We certainly wouldn't do it at the moment. We wouldn't want a socially distanced wedding.</p>

<p>'At some point it would be nice. We have discussed it and said it would be nice to do but it has to be the right time and this year isn't it.' </p>

<p>Denise shares her daughter Betsy, ten, with her ex-husband Lee Mead while Eddie is a father to two including his 21-year-old daughter Leah.</p>
