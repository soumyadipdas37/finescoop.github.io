<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The new Premier League is all set to begin on Saturday and the race for the Golden Boot will restart as the sharpest shooters around look to get their hands on the prestigious award.</p>

<p>Leicester City's Jamie Vardy is looking to defend his title after becoming the club's first player in history to win the award, while two-time winners Mohamed Salah and Harry Kane will be looking for a hat-trick - something they're very used to. </p>

<p>Newcomer Timo Werner, however, will be looking to assert his authority in the English top-flight after joining big-spending Chelsea for £53million.</p>

<p>There are, however, a whole host of players who could realistically challenge to be crowned the top flight's No 1 striker. </p>

<p>Here are the 10 most likely players to be in contention... </p>

<p>With the Premier League set to begin again, the race for the Golden Boot restarts</p>

<p>Odds to win: 5/1</p>

<p>Mohamed Salah has been named as the early favourite to claim the Golden Boot for 2020-21 campaign.</p>

<p>Despite winning the title with Liverpool last season, Salah will have been somewhat disappointed to have finished in fifth place among the top goalscorers. Nevertheless the Egyptian forward found the net a respectable 19 times – just four behind Vardy.</p>

<p>Desperate to defend the title and shut out title rivals Manchester City, Salah will push on this season and look to pick up the trophy for a third time, having claimed it in both 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>It is not unreasonable for Salah to be named favourite so early on, given the fact he broke records set by Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis Suarez and Alan Shearer by scoring 32 goals in his first season with Liverpool.</p>

<p>Liverpool's Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah has won the Golden Boot on two occasions</p>

<p>Odds to win: 6/1</p>

<p>There is no surprise in seeing Harry Kane as the second favourite to take the Golden Boot.</p>

<p>Kane was on fine form for Tottenham last season before missing a series of games due to a hamstring injury in January which kept him on the sidelines until the restart in June.</p>

<p>The England captain did, however, return to the squad to provide Jose Mourinho’s side with seven goals in their remaining nine games – with only Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling and West Ham United’s Michael Antonio contributing more in that period.</p>

<p>Should Kane remain injury free for the season, the Golden Boot could be his for a third time.</p>

<p>The ever prolific Harry Kane has won the Golden Boot for both Tottenham and England</p>

<p>Odds to win:  6/1</p>

<p>Joint-second favourite with Kane, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is now happy and settled at Arsenal having tied up his future at the club with a bumper new contract.</p>

<p>The Gunners captain was chasing the tail of Vardy right until the end last season, finishing just one short of the Leicester man’s tally.</p>

<p>A previous joint-winner of the award in 2019 - alongside Salah and Sadio Mane - Aubameyang will play a starring role in Mikel Arteta’s team as they look to better their eighth-place finish last term.</p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang won the Golden Boot in 2019 along with Mane and Salah</p>

<p>Jamie Vardy - 23 goals in 35 games, 132 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - 22 goals in 36 games, 143 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Danny Ings - 22 goals in 38 games, 128 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Raheem Sterling - 20 goals in 33 games, 133 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Mo Salah - 19 goals in 34 games, 152 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Sadio Mane - 18 goals in 35 games, 153 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Harry Kane - 18 goals in 29 games, 144 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Marcus Rashford - 17 goals in 31 games, 156 minutes per goal </p>

<p>Anthony Martial - 17 goals in 32 games, 155 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Raul Jimenez - 17 goals in 38 games, 191 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Sergio Aguero - 16 goals in 24 games, 91 minutes per goal</p>

<p>Odds to win: 7/1  </p>

<p>He is Manchester City’s record scorer, yet Sergio Aguero is somewhat injury-prone, missing most of the restart last season, and not getting any younger at 32. </p>

<p>Yet he makes the most of his time on the pitch. Last season Aguero scored a total of 16 goals in 24 appearances while playing under Pep Guardiola – putting his average of goals per match at 0.67.</p>

<p>The Argentine will be looking to increase his tally next season, and the enforced coronavirus break and pre-season period has given Aguero the time to rest and recover ahead of Man City’s bid to win back the Premier League title.</p>

<p>Odds to win: 9/1 </p>

<p>Everyone loves an outsider and what better option than Timo Werner. </p>

<p>The Chelsea starlet had long been linked with a move to reigning champions Liverpool before Frank Lampard worked his magic to bring him to Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>Werner was guaranteed more game time with the Blues rather than the Reds next season - giving the 24-year-old the opportunity to find the net more often.</p>

<p>The German international took the Bundesliga by storm, making him hot property. Werner scored a total of 28 goals in just 34 league appearances last season for RB Leipzig.</p>

<p>Known for his lightening-quick speed, fast feet and sharp shooting, Werner could cause some real damage in the Premier League next season. </p>

<p>Timo Werner has made a big-money summer move and will want to make an impression</p>

<p>Odds to win: 12/1</p>

<p>Raheem Sterling had one eye on the Premier League and one eye on the Golden Boot last season after becoming a real goalscoring force under Pep Guardiola.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old is eager to get his hands on the trophy after finishing fourth in the goals table last term. </p>

<p>He scored a total of 20 for Manchester City - three more than his previous record from the season before. Keep up that rate of improvement at the prize could be his.</p>

<p>Raheem Sterling is a realistic contender as his transformation into a prolific scorer continues</p>

<p>Odds to win: 16/1</p>

<p>Liverpool supporters have long recognised Sadio Mane’s brilliance and he is now recognised outside of Merseyside as a world-class talent.</p>

<p>The Senegal international scored 21 times overall last season, which was just two behind team-mate and Golden Boot favourite Salah, with whom he shared the award in 2019, as well as Aubameyang.</p>

<p>Mane was pivotal to The Reds' title success, scoring 18 goals in the league and registering seven assists. </p>

<p>Some would argue that he needs to become as selfish in front of goal as his team-mate to win this award outright. </p>

<p>Sadio Mane scored 21 times last season, which was just two behind team-mate Salah</p>

<p>Odds to win: 18/1</p>

<p>The reigning champion, who once helped to spearhead the most incredible Premier League title triumph of them all - became the first player in Leicester's history to win the Golden Boot after scoring 23 goals last season.</p>

<p>That was not Vardy’s only moment of glory as the 33-year-old managed to reach a century of efforts in the top flight too.</p>

<p>Only three other players in the Foxes’ history have scored 100 for the club. The last of those, Arthur Lochhead, hit that mark back in 1933-34.</p>

<p>Many will view him as an outsider for this award - but when did that ever stop this remarkable footballer? </p>

<p>Jamie Vardy became the first player in Leicester City’s history to win the award last season</p>

<p>Odds to win: 20/1</p>

<p>With Aguero edging towards the end of his career, Guardiola will be looking to use Gabriel Jesus more often, so watch out for him this season. </p>

<p>Should Jesus be given plenty of chances, he has the ability to push for the Golden Boot. The 23-year-old had a better expected goals rate per 90 minutes than any other player in the league last season - bar his own team-mate Aguero.</p>

<p>With an expectation of 0.82 goals per game, Jesus was well ahead of the rest of the competition. </p>

<p>Vardy was the next best on 0.58 xG per game, while Aubameyang's rate of 0.42 xG was only around half of Jesus's expected return. Aguero was on 0.9 xG.</p>

<p>It's time for Jesus to prove he's more than just a super-sub. </p>

<p>Gabriel Jesus had a better expected goals per 90 minutes than any other player in the league</p>

<p>Odds to win:  22/1</p>

<p>Danny Ings burst into the top bracket of goalscorers last season and was the inspiration for Southampton to fight back and finish the season in the middle of the pack after a quite awful start.</p>

<p>Ings became the first name on the team sheet in a season that saw him score 22 Premier League goals - and rack up an impressive xG rate of 0.52 goals per 90 minutes.</p>

<p>If the 28-year-old - and his Southampton team-mates - can come back fresh and fighting like they did in the second half of last term then he could push the likes of Salah and Kane again.</p>

<p>Of course, he remains a big outsider and it seems unlikely that the average punter will stick it all on Ings to win the award, but his odds also reflect his lack of previous prolific seasons, which were often ruined by injury.</p>

<p>The only way looks up for this fine finisher. </p>

<p>Danny Ings is an outsider for the Golden Boot but his form is getting better and better</p>
