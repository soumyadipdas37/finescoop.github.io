<p>Uploading a clip of Sean's back as he played Call Of Duty, the beauty wrote: 'This is how we spend our Sunday's.'</p>

<p>With Sean fully immersed in the game while wearing his headset, it was clear that Jesy wasn't impressed by his lack of attentiveness as she added a GIF which read: 'I need attention.'</p>

<p>It comes after it was claimed earlier this month, that her hunky new beau is on celebrity dating app Raya.</p>

<p>In a screenshot of his profile obtained by The Sun, Sean's cover image is a shirtless snap and lists his profession as acting and his location as London. </p>
