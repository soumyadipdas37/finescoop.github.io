<p>Proud mom: Frankel welcomed Bryn with estranged husband Jason Hoppy, 49, with whom she filed for divorce in 2013</p>

<p>She may be getting ready to become a mother again, recently opening up about her desire to adopt in the comments of an Instagram post about a boy in foster care.</p>

<p>The BStrong activist commented: 'I will adopt him. Bryn said “momma you should adopt him.”</p>

<p>Frankel also revealed: 'The thing that surprises people is that once they get into the system, it is hard to get them out. Growing up, we always heard that everyone wants a baby and not an older kid. </p>

<p>'I tried a while back to adopt a 3-year-old and it was a harder process than a newborn. If it’s like other family law systems, it’s not as easy as the movies make it.'</p>
