<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A group of heartless selective schoolboys have tormented a teenage sexual abuse survivor as part of a twisted Year 12 muck-up day scavenger hunt. </p>

<p>Leaving students at Merewether High School in Newcastle, north of Sydney, were challenged to send the girl - who was abused from the age of four to 10 -  a message 'defending paedophiles' to score points.  </p>

<p>And in a sickening abuse of trust, the idea to target the 18-year-old actually came from one of her friends. </p>

<p>The teenager had only recently confided in him about being sexually abused by a close family friend over six years. </p>

<p>In Facebook messages obtained by Daily Mail Australia, graduating students contacted the vulnerable teenager - who does not even go to the school - late on Wednesday night to defend paedophiles in a sick attempt to elicit a reaction. </p>

<p>The young woman, who can't be identified, later learned the messages were sent to earn points for the selective school's Muck Up Day scavenger hunt. </p>

<p>Other challenges in the warped hunt included flicking a dog's testicles, abusing a teacher via email, filming sex acts and abusing new mothers. </p>

<p>Leaving students at Merewether High School in Newcastle, north of Sydney, were challenged to send the girl a message 'defending paedophiles' to score points</p>

<p>An 18-year-old girl, who Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to name, became the victim of one of the challenges on Wednesday night when she began receiving unsolicited messages from boys she hardly knew defending paedophilia</p>

<p>The young girl from Newcastle, north of Sydney, later learned the messages were sent to earn points for a local schools' Muck Up Day scavenger hunt challenge (pictured)</p>

<p>It is the latest in a string of sick muck-up day challenges involving graduating NSW students, including at elite schools such as Shore in Sydney where so-called pranks included spitting on homeless people and pooing in public. </p>

<p>The girl's shattered mother told Daily Mail Australia the messages had 'broken' the 18-year-old, who recently started university after leaving school in Year 10 to cope with her trauma.</p>

<p>'The days of throwing toilet paper over lawns and having innocent fun are gone... This is way too far,' the mother-of-three said.  </p>

<p>Her daughter was at home when she received a message from a boy her age that read: 'I really think paedophiles aren't that bad.' </p>

<p>When she questioned the message, the boy added: 'My uncle was one and I think he's a good bloke. Is there anything wrong with that? </p>

<p>'Everyone is human. We are all the same, black, white, pedo, not pedo.'</p>

<p>The messages immediately triggered the young woman, who was repeatedly molested as a child and has needed therapy to deal with her trauma ever since. </p>

<p>A friend in the year group revealed he had seen the muck-up day scavenger hunt challenges for Year 12 students at the Newcastle high school, and the messages were part of the twisted game to earn notoriety and points ahead of graduation. </p>

<p>'She was sobbing, shaking,' her mother tearfully explained to Daily Mail Australia late on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>'I'm taking her for a drive to calm her down now. She hasn't stopped saying how she feels so humiliated and exposed.'</p>

<p>The exact challenge was for the students to 'message [her] and start an argument about paedophilia', all while knowing about her traumatic experience.</p>

<p>'The boy who created the challenge, she confided in him. She thought he was her friend and instead he's turned her trauma into a joke.</p>

<p>'We're just totally shattered, and that's an understatement.'</p>

<p>The girl only found out she was the centre of the sick scavenger hunt when a friend messaged her (her conversation with him above)</p>

<p>The girl took to Facebook to confront the former friend who abused her trust </p>

<p>She also privately messaged the former student, demanding to know why 'you literally made me being molested into a f***ing scavenger challenge) </p>

<p>On Wednesday night, the young woman decided to confront the issue on Facebook after she realised 'all of Newcastle was about to find out about it one way or another'.</p>

<p>'I thought it would be better for it to come from me. It was my story to tell and I wanted to be able to tell it myself rather than in this group, so I posted it on Facebook,' she said.</p>

<p>The post attracted hundreds of comments from outraged friends sharing their own muck-up day horror stories and condemning the boy who created the challenge. </p>

<p>'I wasn't ready to publicly announce it at all, but I felt like I didn't have a choice,' she said.</p>

<p>Within hours, Facebook had removed the posts and any other comments affiliated with it, claiming it violated community standards.</p>

<p>'It's okay for him to put it all around Newcastle and the high school that he went to, and for students at the school to have a hard copy of this challenge list and to contact my daughter, but it's not okay for her to post about it,' her mother said. </p>

<p>The mother-of-three explained that she understood kids needed to let off steam at the end of a school year, but said it should never come at the expense of another person.</p>

<p>'That boy has caused irreparable damage to [her] and to our family,' the woman said. </p>

<p>'We were finally starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel and now we're back at square one. As a mother, I helped her put the pieces back together and now they've just totally fallen apart again because of one person's idea of funny.'   </p>

<p>When she was just 10 years old, the brave girl told her parents about the abuse she had endured for six years. Her family had no idea. </p>

<p>'She stood up in that box at court and she was just so brave in testifying against him. He was charged and it took her a very long time to trust anybody with that information, to trust boys at all.'    </p>

<p>'She's so broken again. She'd been trying to build up trust in people. She's just said to me ''what's the use?' It's just heartbreaking.'</p>

<p>On Wednesday night, the family rang police about the messages she was receiving and about the muck-up day challenges.</p>

<p>They were told nothing could be done, even though they had names and evidence of some of the people involved, including the young man who first distributed the rumours. </p>

<p>She had not yet contacted the school, but the young girl involved told Daily Mail Australia she knew the scavenger hunt had been planned without the school's authorisation.</p>

<p>'A few years back, I was told a student died while doing the scavenger hunt. Ever since then, the school has wanted no part in it,' she said.</p>

<p>The post attracted hundreds of comments from outraged friends sharing their own muck-up day horror stories and condemning the boy who created the challenge</p>

<p>Shore School is among the top ranked in New South Wales and regularly features impressive Year 12 results. Students have been embroiled in controversy after a muck-up day manifesto was leaked</p>

<p>NSW Education said they were aware of the girl's post and were co-operating with police.</p>

<p>'The school understands that the posts are not from a student or students enrolled at the school,' a spokesperson said. </p>

<p>'No students at any school, including Merewether High School, are to take part in any inappropriate or anti-social activities.' </p>

<p>Since she began receiving the vile messages, the young woman has slipped back into a dark place and has been inconsolable. </p>

<p>'In the past, she has been in a place where she couldn't even find a reason to live,' her mother explained.</p>

<p>'I would camp outside her door and sleep on the wooden floor just to make sure she wouldn't harm herself. I'm so terrified now. I'm praying and I've made her promise she won't hurt herself.'</p>

<p>It's understood the boy responsible for including her name in the challenge completed his HSC at the same school in 2019. He has since deleted his social media accounts. </p>

<p>He and the young woman had been friends prior to the incident, and she was doubly heartbroken when she learned he had broken her trust.   </p>

<p>'Someone's idea of a scavenger challenge to hurt and break a person is not my idea of fun or funny,' the girl's mother said.</p>

<p>'They've made it personal. I think they're young, and silly and don't realise the repercussions of their actions.</p>

<p>'Some of these challenges include taking three ecstasy pills and washing it down with a bottle of Jack Daniels, last year they were told to burn swastika's into their bums.'</p>

<p>She acknowledged that the students had worked hard and overcome major setbacks in 2020 to make it to their graduation, but said it was no excuse to ruin someone else's life.</p>

<p>The young woman is not a student at the school and has no affiliation with the muck-up day challenge, and said she had no idea why she was ever brought into it.</p>

<p>The exclusive bubble stretches from Belmore Park, out the front of Central Station, to the Spit Bridge and includes Kirribilli, Neutral Bay and Mosman</p>

<p>Students at several other schools are known to be participating in similar muck-up day challenges, bouncing ideas off one another in nationwide Facebook groups. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, the manifesto from Shore School on Sydney's lower north shore revealed students were willing to 'spit on homeless people' and denigrate women for sport.  </p>

<p>The 'official rule and challenge book' - revealed they planned to meet between 5pm and 6pm on Wednesday at Waverton Park for the series of 'treacherous' challenges.  </p>
