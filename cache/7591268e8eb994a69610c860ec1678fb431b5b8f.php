<p>Getting political: Retired WWE wrestler Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson made his first-ever presidential endorsement on Sunday during a virtual seven-minute chat with Democrat Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris</p>

<p>Speaking to the pair, Dwayne said: 'You guys are both obviously experienced to lead. You've done great things. Joe, you've had such an incredible career. You've led in my opinion, with great compassion, and heart, and drive, but also soul. You and I talked about that in the past and how important soul is.'</p>

<p>Johnson also praised the 55-year-old California Senator as being 'smart and tough' saying: 'I've seen you in those hearings and in my opinion you are a certified bad***.'</p>

<p>When the half-Black, half-Samoan action star asked them how they plan on earning the respect of the entire nation, the 77-year-old former Vice President was first to respond.</p>

<p>'By doing what we say we're going to do. By keeping our word. By leveling with the American people. By taking responsibility. When we fail, acknowledge it. We're not going to be perfect, but take responsibility,' Biden explained.</p>

<p>'Say, "This is what I'm going to do, this is what I believe and tell the truth." That sounds so basic, but the American people are strong, they're tough, they can take anything if you level with them, and tell the truth, and one of the ways we're going to do it is to demonstrate we mean what we say. Our administration, DJ, is going to look like America. It's going to be representative of all of America.'</p>

<p>Harris expanded on the idea of not having trust unless you speak the truth.</p>

<p>'You know that as a parent, we know that as parents, you have to speak truth. And as long as there is an understanding that it is being spoken not to confront, not to hurt, but to deal with things, the way they must be handled,' Kamala continued.</p>

<p>'That has to be part of the core of what we do as we go forward because to your point, we're facing as a country so many challenges and people are grieving. I mean, people are grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of certainty, the loss of normalcy and to heal and get through this we're gonna have to be honest about what healing will require. </p>

<p>'That's one of the things that Joe and I really do have in common, which is we're motivated by healing, but we know to do that, we have to be honest about what it's going to take.'</p>
