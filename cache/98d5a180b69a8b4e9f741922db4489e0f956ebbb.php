<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Neymar has decided to end his £78.6million partnership with Nike after 15 years.</p>

<p>The striker's contract with the sportswear company will end on August 31, as reported by Brazilian outlet Diario do Peixe, with the pair unable to agree how much he would be paid for a renewal. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old did not appear in their latest worldwide campaign, 'You Can't Stop Sport' which included Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo with a Nike spokesperson telling AFP he is no longer one of their athletes.</p>

<p>Neymar has decided to end his £78.6million partnership with sportswear company Nike</p>

<p>The forward is said to be in talks with German company Puma after spending 15 years with Nike</p>

<p>Several reports suggest the forward will sign with German company Puma, who are the current kit suppliers of Manchester City and AC Milan.</p>

<p>Nike have sponsored the Brazilian since he was 13 years old, long before he became a professional. During his rise to stardom at Santos, they even supplied sports equipment for the club.</p>

<p>Neymar's switch of allegiances could be bad news for Paris Saint-Germain with Nike the club's kit supplier.</p>

<p>The American company supplied equipment to Santos when they first linked up with the star </p>

<p>The French side had an increase in their contract after signing the megastar, receiving €70m (£62m) as a result of his world record transfer from Barcelona.</p>

<p>Neymar renewed his Nike contract after winning the Copa Libertadores in 2011 and the deal, worth a huge £78.6m, was reportedly set to end in 2022.</p>

<p>But the deal looks to have ended early and will have a big impact on the American company because of the striker's global appeal. As well as PSG, Nike supply the kits of Chelsea, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Tottenham and recently gained Premier League champions Liverpool.</p>

<p>They also sponsor some of the biggest stars in sport including Virgil van Dijk, Raheem Sterling, LeBron James, Serena Williams and Tiger Woods.</p>
