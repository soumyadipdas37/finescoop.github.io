<p>He referred to Miley as 'one of [his] best friends' in an interview with GQ Australia in December that year.</p>

<p>'Miley is one of my best friends and she helps with some of that transitional stuff – trying to escape your childhood. She's super open-minded and I'm working on becoming more like that,' he gushed.</p>

<p>Her first public kiss with Cody occurred nearly two months after it was revealed that Miley and Liam, 30, were getting divorced.</p>
