<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jadon Sancho has revealed he is humbled by his £108m price tag as the Borussia Dortmund star insisted that it is important he must remain patient during his career. </p>

<p>The 20-year-old has been identified as Manchester United's No 1 transfer target this summer, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer eager to bring the youngster in to bolster his attacking ranks.</p>

<p>Last month, Dortmund said that the Old Trafford club missed a set deadline to agree a deal for the star, who the Germans value at £108m, and a drastic breakthrough is needed if United want to land their man. </p>

<p>Jadon Sancho has revealed he is humbled by his hefty price tag of over £100million</p>

<p>The Borussia Dortmund star has been heavily linked with a move to Man United this summer</p>

<p>And Sancho, who joined the Bundesliga side from Manchester City for £8m in 2017, says he is humbled by the hefty price tag Dortmund have placed on him.   </p>

<p>'I guess it’s a nice feeling to be worth so much, but again, I don’t really look at it that much,' he told SoccerBible. 'For me it’s about doing well for my team and doing well for myself as well.'</p>

<p>The 20-year-old took a big risk to walk away from City as a teenager, opting not to stay in the academy and the opportunity to develop under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola. Sancho insists, though, that it is important to be patient.  </p>

<p>Negotiations between the two clubs have been prolonged with a big breakthrough needed</p>

<p>Sancho added that it is important that he remains patient at this early stage of his career</p>

<p>'I feel like everything is a process,' he added. 'So you’ve got to be patient in what you do. Obviously I took a massive risk coming to Germany. I had a lot of people doubting me saying why are you leaving City, but I just felt like it was the right time for me.</p>

<p>'It’s about patience. You can’t rush things. Everything happens for a reason. If it was meant to be this year that I broke through, then I’d be more than happy. I’m still young at the end of the day.</p>

<p>'But obviously I was lucky enough that I had the coaches that had faith in me, and they took a chance. The last few years have gone so quick for me and I’m enjoying the journey.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has identified Sancho as his No 1 target to bolster his attacking options</p>

<p>'For me, I just focus on my football. I just want to do what’s best for my team and win titles at the end of the day.'</p>

<p>United have trailed Sancho all summer but are making little progress in talks surrounding the agent fee for brokering a move and the player's salary.</p>

<p>Discussions between the two parties are ongoing, albeit slowly, and United will not negotiate a fee with Borussia Dortmund until a deal has been reached with the 20-year-old's representatives.</p>
