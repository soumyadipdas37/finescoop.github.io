<p>More than 200 people took part in the gathering, the brainchild of American artist Spencer Tunick at London's Alexandra Palace. </p>

<p>The artist, who is known for his images of groups of naked people taken all over the world, said that creating the work was 'liberating and life-affirming'. </p>

<p>Some 220 volunteers have stripped naked - apart from their masks - for a socially distanced art installation at London's Alexandra Palace</p>

<p>The installation, assembled in the early hours, was 'about breaking down barriers', he said.</p>

<p>'The reality of masses of people close together - shoulder to shoulder, skin touching skin - may be something of the past for now, but still the desire is there for that natural connectivity, perhaps more so now than ever,' the photographer added.</p>

<p>A total of 220 people posed nude as they stood at least one metre apart and had their temperature checked on arrival to ensure they were covid safe. </p>

<p>American artist Spencer Tunick who is known for his images of groups of naked people taken all over the world, said that creating the work was 'liberating and life-affirming'</p>

<p>The socially distanced artwork was created to mark the Sky Arts channel becoming free from 17th September.  </p>

<p>Tunick said it had been liberating and life-affirming to be invited by Sky Arts to create Everyone Together, which invites the public to participate, becoming not just a viewer but a collaborator.  </p>

<p>The artist is best known for bringing hundreds -- and sometimes thousands -- of participants together to pose for striking mass nude photographs.</p>

<p>Previous installations have seen him transform sites like the Sydney Opera House into seas of exposed bodies, all in the name of art.</p>

<p>The latest project is the first major participatory work of art for the US artist since lockdown in March. </p>

<p>It saw him asking groups of face mask-wearing participants to strip down and assume coordinated poses before he captured them in single collage-style screenshots. </p>

<p>With Covid-19 sending him into lockdown in New York, Tunick has had to find a new medium for his work: video conferences.  </p>
