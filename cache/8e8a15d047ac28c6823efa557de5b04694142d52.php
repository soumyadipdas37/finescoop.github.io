<p>But the mother of one has been getting some help since returning home. </p>

<p>'I proudly say that my little girl is home with my sister now, and I had a housekeeper come in on Monday to help me with the washing, and I'm having my dinners delivered,' she said.</p>

<p>'I certainly cannot do it all - and I think the expectation or that thought that we can just puts so much pressure on us as women.' </p>

<p>It comes after Jesinta opened up about the struggles of becoming a mother in an interview with Body + Soul on Sunday.</p>

<p>She explained that the difficulties she had breastfeeding left her feeling 'wrecked'.</p>

<p>'I was so exhausted, my body was wrecked and, mentally, there were so many tears,' she said. </p>

<p>'I was encouraged to still pump because I was told that one teaspoon of breast milk a day was better than nothing. I'd torture myself to get even half a teaspoon.'  </p>
