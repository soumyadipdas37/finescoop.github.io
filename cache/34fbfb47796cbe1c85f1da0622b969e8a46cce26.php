<p>With the traffic one largely one way and heading towards Tottenham's goal, a touchline spat between Jose Mourinho and Frank Lampard was one of the first-half highlights.</p>

<p>Not long after the other, Timo Werner's first Chelsea goal, a war of words broke out on the sidelines.</p>

<p>A touchline spat between Jose Mourinho and Frank Lampard erupted on Tuesday evening</p>

<p>Their war of words broke out after Chelsea had gone ahead against Tottenham in the EFL Cup</p>

<p>One by-product of the empty stadiums is the exchanges between players, managers and officials now being much easier to pick up.</p>

<p>'F****** hell Frank, when you're losing 3-0 you're not standing up here,' Mourinho said, in one of the most cutting verbal blows.</p>

<p>Mourinho also indicated Lampard was talking too much as tempers flared. The Chelsea manager bit back but, in the main, smiled it off.</p>

<p>He could do at the time with his side well in control of proceedings, unlike on Saturday at West Brom when his side were 3-0 down and being humiliated at the Hawthorns before a second-half fightback, the game Mourinho referred to.</p>

<p>Mourinho also indicated to the officials that Lampard was talking too much as tempers flared</p>

<p>The Chelsea manager bit back but, in the main, smiled it off as he clashed with his former boss</p>

<p>Lampard's Mourinho spat brought back memories of his X-rated clash with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp at Anfield towards the end of last season.</p>

<p>What is clear from both is that as he carves out his own managerial career Lampard will be no pushover.</p>

<p>Some of his players such as Antonio Rudiger and Marcos Alonso, both omitted after getting on the wrong side of Lampard, will vouch for that.</p>

<p>So too will Mourinho, now, as well as Klopp.</p>

<p>Tuesday night was the latest evidence that Lampard will stand his ground against anyone, regardless of how glittering their CV is or experienced they are.</p>

<p>It comes after Lampard got into a spat with Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool's coaches in July</p>

<p>Lampard owes much of his success as a player to Mourinho.</p>

<p>In one of their first conversations following Mourinho's 2004 appointment as Chelsea manager he famously approached a naked Lampard in the shower and told him he was the best player in the world.</p>

<p>He wasn't at the time but developed into one of them under Mourinho, becoming one of his most loyal soldiers during the Special One's trophy-laden first spell in charge at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>But after Lampard scored against Chelsea in 2014, having quit Mourinho's Chelsea and returning to face them with Manchester City, the latter declared 'the love story is over.'</p>

<p>Those good times the pair once shared looked like they counted for little when they locked horns in the heat of the moment.</p>

<p>There was some low-level sniping in the build-up too.</p>

<p>Lampard had little sympathy for Spurs' punishing schedule, highlighting how they got a bye to this round and night off last Tuesday due to Leyton Orient's coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>Ahead of the game he also laughed off Mourinho's claims he didn't have enough bodies to name a strong team.</p>

<p>But Lampard has shown again that he will not stand down against Mourinho or anyone else</p>

<p>After picking a striker-less side, meanwhile, Mourinho made a reference, perhaps aimed at big-spending Chelsea, to Spurs having to adopt a different approach to recruiting a new striker.</p>

<p>What really mattered was who did their talking on the pitch. The pair did make peace, shaking hands before the shootout which decided this tie.</p>

<p>And there was, no doubt, some extra satisfaction for master Mourinho as he had the last word, outwitting pupil Lampard for the first time in four attempts.</p>
