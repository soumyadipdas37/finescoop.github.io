<p>'Is it possible that Sydney 2000 was Cathy Freeman's second biggest triumph behind the '96 Stawell Gift?' Adam Zwar wrote on Twitter. </p>

<p>'She started 54 metres behind the field and got elbowed in the final straight. If you haven't seen this, you need to.'</p>

<p>Freeman appeared to cop an elbow in the ribs after she bumped shoulders with a fellow sprinter during the main straight of the race.   </p>

<p>'I feel bad for saying that Cathy got 'elbowed'. On further inspection, the runners seem to bump shoulders. Happens all the time. No villains here,' Mr Zwar added. </p>

<p>Freeman came in first at 50.54 seconds. In 1995, Freeman won the 400m final in the time of 53.24 seconds despite the 54metre handicap. </p>

<p>The commentator said: 'Last year was much easier than that, they weren't going to let her get it easy here today, she got a shove and all.' </p>

<p>The Stawell Gift website said Freeman 'thrilled' the crowd with 'two of the most memorable races ever witnessed at Stawell.'  </p>

<p>Twitter viewers quickly heaped praise on the 'incredible athlete'. </p>

<p>'That is ridiculous. Not sure how it's really even possible. What an athlete,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'Remarkable run, rode the elbow well, amazing speed that last 50. She was just a beautiful athlete, loved watching her run,' another wrote. </p>

<p>Freeman's personal best in the 400m was 48.63 seconds at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. </p>

<p>The dated vision resurfaced as Freeman marked the 20-year anniversary of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.</p>

<p>Freeman lit the cauldron to launch the sporting event and went on to win a gold medal in the 400 metres.</p>

<p>'It's at times like this that I reflect and I ponder the power of sport and the difference that sport can make in all of our lives,' Freeman said on in a message recorded Melbourne. </p>

<p>'I am very proud of the fact that when I lit the cauldron all those years ago, it was a symbol of hope for all young Australians.' </p>
