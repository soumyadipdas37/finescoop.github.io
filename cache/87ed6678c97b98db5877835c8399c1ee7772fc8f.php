<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New York State Liquor Authority board have been slammed after board members failed to wear face coverings during a meeting where they issued fines to businesses breaking the safety rule.</p>

<p>The SLA chairman Vincent Bradley and commissioners Lily Fan and Greeley Ford did not wear face masks during Wednesday's meeting.</p>

<p>The board members, who sat with distance between them, were reviewing bar and restaurant fines during the live-streamed meeting, Times Union reported.</p>

<p>A member of staff, who was also not wearing a face covering, enters the meeting at one point and hands papers to Ford, who stands up behind an unmasked Bradley to accept the documents.</p>

<p>Around ten minutes after the interaction, the board fined an unnamed organisation $1,500 due to 'employees with no masks'.</p>

<p>The panel approved fines against bars and restaurants for safely violations which were identified in recent compliance checks. </p>

<p>The panel imposed fines and penalties totalling tens of thousands of dollars during Wednesday's meeting.</p>

<p>SLA spokesman William Crowley told Times Union: 'The format of the meeting was designed to provide for social distancing, and we have advised everyone that COVID-related protocols must be followed at all times.</p>

<p>'But let's be clear, comparing this isolated lapse during a distanced board meeting to a crowded bar or restaurant where alcohol is present and patrons are literally shoulder-to-shoulder is a stretch.' </p>

<p>The panel members sat with some distance between them, though it is not known if they were six feet apart, as they fined an unnamed firm $1,500 due to 'employees with no masks'</p>

<p>Safety guidance released by the state in spring asks public and private employees to maintain a 'distance of at least 6ft at all times', unless safety of the activity requires a shorter distance.</p>

<p>It added that workers who come within 6ft of each other must wear 'acceptable face coverings' which cover both the nose and mouth.</p>

<p>The SLA board members were seated with some distance between them, but it is unclear whether they were positioned six feet apart. </p>

<p>This comes after the board have suspended licenses of at least 168 New York businesses due to 'egregious violations', according to SLA records</p>

<p>Andy's Place, The New Elbo Room and Mark's Place have all shut down after violations including staff and patrons not wearing face coverings or adhering to social distancing regulations. </p>
