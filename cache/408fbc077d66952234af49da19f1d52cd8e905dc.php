<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A drunk venture capitalist who boasted about his good looks to police after trying to sexually assault a terrified woman at a Christmas party, a court has heard.</p>

<p>Pavel Grushin, 26, was at a corporate party at the Royal Festival Hall in London when he cornered his victim in a lift last December.</p>

<p>The victim told the court how Grushin, who attended a £26,500-a-year private Mayfair college, grabbed his victim's wrist when she tried to leave and attempted to pull her back in.</p>

<p>When he was arrested at his Kingston-upon-Thames home, Grushin boasted about his good looks to police and urged them to check his Instagram account.   </p>

<p>This 'feeling of self-importance' was criticised by a district judge, who convicted Grushin, a University of Cambridge graduate in Entrepreneurial Studies of common assault and attempted sexual assault.</p>

<p>Pavel Grushin, 26, wsa convicted of assault and the attempted sexual assault of a woman at a Christmas party in London last year</p>

<p>Croydon Magistrates Court heard Grushin, of Samuel Gray Gardens, Kingston-upon-Thames, was a guest at the private event on December 12, last year.</p>

<p>He was spotted loitering on an upper landing by the victim at around 11pm.</p>

<p>'He was leaning over the staircase bannister for balance, he looked to be very drunk and unsteady and I could hear him mumbling,' she told the court.</p>

<p>The woman entered a lift with Grushin and his two male companions. </p>

<p>She added: 'He very quickly walked towards me and tried to corner me, with his arms raised and using his body so I couldn't get around him.</p>

<p>'His eyes were very glazed over and he seemed to be enjoying himself and I was immediately very frightened by his demeanour and expression.</p>

<p>'His motive seemed sexual. I was afraid for my safety.</p>

<p>'He followed me out of the lift and grabbed my right wrist very, very tightly and pulled me in his direction, back towards the lift.</p>

<p>'He said: "Come on," a few times and I just kept saying: "No," loudly, firmly and very clearly.</p>

<p>'To escape, I kept walking backwards and his mouth was puckered as if leaning in for a kiss and I placed my hand on his chest to push him away as he leaned in three times to kiss me.</p>

<p>'I firmly pushed with all my body strength and he stumbled back and stopped.</p>

<p>'Afterwards I burst into tears and there was a big red mark on my wrist, like a Chinese burn.'</p>

<p>Venture capitalist Grushin had begun his night out at a Pall Mall club and ended it at members-only Tramp, near Piccadilly, insisting he limited himself to two glasses of champagne and two glasses of wine.</p>

<p>Pavel Grushin cornered his victim in a lift during a Christmas party at the Royal Festival Hall on London's Southbank in December</p>

<p>After being arrested at home over a month later, wearing just his boxer shorts, he told police he had 'social status' and had met 'many' women.</p>

<p>When officers asked if he thought the victim was attracted to him he replied: 'She could have been. Look at me.'</p>

<p>Describing himself as 'very successful,' Grushin urged the officers to check his Instagram account, where he could be seen 'hanging out with cool people.'</p>

<p>He told the trial: 'I absolutely, categorically did not touch her,' but contradicted himself immediately by saying: 'It is possible I friendly patted her, but I don't remember.'</p>

<p>Grushin denied cornering the victim in the lift, claiming he was reaching for the buttons.</p>

<p>District Judge Nigel McLean bailed Grushin for sentencing on September,29, telling him: 'Alcohol had been consumed and you accept it did effect your behaviour.</p>

<p>'I entirely accept the complainant's reaction was to freeze through fear.</p>

<p>'I did not find you a credible witness and reject your account.</p>

<p>'The alcohol diminished your inhibitions and you had an inflated feeling of self-importance in your appearance and everything else.</p>

<p>'You did attempt to kiss her and that behaviour was sexual in nature.'</p>
