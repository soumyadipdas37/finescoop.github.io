<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Georgia authorities have released body cam footage showing the terrifying moment a fugitive pulled a gun on a sheriff’s deputy and shot him as he was pulled over on a highway before dawn on Monday morning.</p>

<p>In the video, a sheriff’s deputy carrying a flashlight approaches a pickup truck that has a trailer attached to its rear.</p>

<p>When he approaches the driver’s side window, he finds a man wearing glasses and a purple tank top.</p>

<p>The sheriff’s deputy asks the man for ID. Immediately afterward, the man flashes a gun, and the deputy appears to duck. The video ends at this point. </p>

<p>Authorities in Georgia released bodycam footage from a traffic stop on the southbound Interstate 75 highway before dawn on Monday</p>

<p>When a Whitfield County Sheriff's deputy approached the driver's side window, he asked the driver, who has been identified as Dalton Lee Potter, 29, for his identification</p>

<p>Potter is then seen flashing a gun. The sheriff's deputy is knocked backward and the video footage is cut off</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials in Georgia identified the man in the video as Dalton Lee Potter.</p>

<p>Potter and another man on the run from police are considered 'armed and dangerous' after they allegedly shot and wounded a sheriff's deputy before crashing their stolen trailer and running off into the woods. </p>

<p>Potter, 29, was wanted in Texas when he was pulled over in a white Chevrolet Tahoe, pulling a stolen utility trailer, in Whitfield County, Georgia, on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Potter opened fire on Deputy Darrell Hackney, who was saved only by his bulletproof vest.</p>

<p>Hackney and another deputy, Adrian Gomez, both returned fire, but Potter escaped, driving south on Interstate 75, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. </p>

<p>Potter, from Leakey, Texas, then sped off in the stolen trailer, crashing it on I-75 South. </p>

<p>Potter, 29, was pulled over early on Monday morning in Whitfield County, Georgia</p>

<p>Potter, from Leakey, Texas, was driving a white Chevrolet Tahoe with a stolen trailer behind</p>

<p>On Monday morning Georgia sheriffs issued an alert for Potter, following the shooting</p>

<p>A second wanted Texas fugitive, Jonathan Hosmer, 47, was later identified by the wreck</p>

<p>A second man, Jonathan Hosmer, 47, also from Leakey, was captured on a home surveillance system in a subdivision near the truck wreck.</p>

<p>Both men are now being sought by police - with Potter being seen taking off into the woods.</p>

<p>Hosmer was wanted in Texas for burglary. </p>

<p>Potter has been charged with aggravated assault on the deputy; Hosmer has not yet been charged but an arrest warrant has been issued for him.</p>

<p>'Potter is considered armed and dangerous and a 'Blue Alert' has been issued for Potter's capture,' the Georgia Bureau of Investigations said. </p>

<p>Scott Chitwood, Whitfield County sheriff, said the deputy was treated at a hospital and is now at home. </p>

<p>'Thank goodness that his vest protected it,' said Chitwood. </p>

<p>'He was treated and released at the hospital last night. Had a burning sensation, little abrasion, but overall fine, right below the rib cage.'</p>

<p>Whitfield County Sheriff Scott Chitwood speaks about the incident on Monday</p>

<p>Deputy Darrell Hackney was saved only by his bulletproof vest during the shooting</p>

<p>Hosmer, also from Leakey, Texas, was wanted for burglary of a building</p>

<p>Local residents are assisting police, WRCBtv reported.</p>

<p>John Locklear, who lives near the crash site, said he told police he had seen him on Monday morning.</p>

<p>'He walked, went down that road, went over the railroad tracks and went that way, I said about five minutes ago,' Locklear said. </p>

<p>'I looked at him and he turned his head, he didn't want me to look at his face. </p>

<p>I said, well, there's something weird about that. So I got back here and checked my stuff out to see if anything was missing. </p>

<p>'But they said he was armed,' Locklear added.</p>

<p>Chitwood said eyewitness reports have helped them narrow their search, which was filmed by Fox5 Atlanta.</p>

<p>'One of the neighbors gave the description, we felt like it was legitimate, we focused on that area. </p>

<p>'But we've come up with nothing at this point. We did come up with a pack of fresh cigarettes we felt like possibly could be his,' Chitwood added.</p>

<p>It's unclear why Potter came to Georgia.</p>

<p>Helicopters are pictured searching for the two fugitives in Georgia</p>

<p>A manhunt is underway for the two Texans who fled when their vehicle crashed</p>
