<p>Awful: Vicky Pattison, 32, has told how she was left horrified after a stranger spat at her in the street</p>

<p>Speaking on her Instagram Story, Vicky fumed: 'Nothing could have f******g prepared me for what just happened. </p>

<p>'So we are doing some street style shooting today on location because the whole vibe of this shoot is edgy and contemporary. </p>

<p>'We are showing people how they can wear [the clothes] with different styles and in different places that's not just a studio.</p>

<p>'Against my better judgement we're in Notting Hill because it's super pretty but I had heard rumours that these people are less than hospitable towards people taking pictures. Well nothing could have f*****g prepared me for what has just happened.'</p>

<p>The former Geordie Shore star explained how she popped in a coffee shop to quickly take some snaps when a woman became hostile towards her.</p>

<p>She continued: 'We were quick and super apologetic because we know people are just going about their daily lives. </p>

<p>'Anyway, some woman starts taking the p*** out of us like pouting and posing and laughing. And I was like, I get it because I look like a bit of a c*** so I started laughing and gave her a wave.</p>

<p>'But then she starts giving us the finger. And I was like, 'Oh my God that's a bit intense.' And then when I laugh she spat at me! Spat at me in the middle of a global f***** pandemic.'</p>

<p>While Vicky may have been the victim in this case, Geordie Shore viewers will remember she once spat in the face of fellow cast member Jay Gardner in series one. </p>

<p>Jay delivered some insults Vicky's way, leaving her shocked and ultimately spitting on him when the argument got out of hand with their co-stars separating them. </p>

<p>Vicky expressed regret for her actions later on the show, saying: 'I am not an idiot and I am not above apologising for myself. </p>

<p>'I know when I'm in the wrong. Spitting on someone does not make you big and it doesn't make you clever.' </p>

<p>Sorry: Vicky expressed regret for her actions later on the show, saying: 'I am not an idiot and I am not above apologising for myself'</p>
