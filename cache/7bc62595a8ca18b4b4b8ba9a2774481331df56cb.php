<p>Mountain Rescue and Civil Guard officials were sent to the scene and first rescued the dog, trapped on a small rocky ledge.</p>

<p>Rescue teams then helped the woman get to safe ground.</p>

<p>The other female hiker, who had also attempted to climb the mountain with her pooch, was stuck as well.</p>

<p>One of the hikers held onto a tree to save her from falling further down the mountain after trying to reach the dog</p>

<p>But her position was not as dangerous as the others so she was helped by rescuers last.</p>

<p>The group was helped to a higher spot on the mountain where the rescue helicopter could land and take them to the Son Espases Hospital in Majorca.</p>

<p>They were reportedly exhausted and stressed from the ordeal.</p>

<p>So far this year, the Mountain Rescue and Intervention Group have taken part in 47 rescue operations in the Balearic Islands.</p>
