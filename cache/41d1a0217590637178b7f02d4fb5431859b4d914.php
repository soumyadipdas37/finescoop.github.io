<p>Delay: Mario Falcone has revealed he and fiancée Becky Miesner were disappointed they had to postpone their wedding as they were planning on trying for a second child right after</p>

<p>He said: 'We’re all set for next year and it’s still going to be in Italy. The more annoying thing for us was that we would have tried for baby number two but now that’s on hold as well. It’s one of those things.     </p>

<p>Mario admitted the wedding cancellation was tougher on Becky who had been looking forward to it for a long time.  </p>

<p>He said: 'I was more upset for Becky because I think wedding days are more for the lady, it’s the thing they dream of. Life goes on. </p>

<p>'There’s people at the moment who are not working, who are made redundant and are suffering because of what’s going on.'</p>

<p>Postponed: The former TOWIE star, 32, was forced to call off his summer nuptials in Italy after social distancing restrictions due to Covid-19 made the ceremony impossible</p>

<p>The couple were originally going to wed on May 28 this year with Becky admitting she was 'heartbroken' when they were forced to call it off.</p>

<p>She wrote: 'Thursday 28th May 2020 was going to be our wedding day in Italy but we have decided to cancel due to the current situation, heartbroken.' </p>

<p>Mario - who is of Italian origin from his father's side - popped the question to his girlfriend in Santorini back in June 2017, with the couple welcoming Parker in November 2018. </p>

<p>The reality star is looking forward to when he and Becky can begin trying for another child, saying he thinks Parker will take to no longer being an only child well.  </p>

<p>He said: 'The more annoying thing for us was that we would have tried for baby number two but now that’s on hold as well. It’s one of those things'</p>

<p>He told MailOnline: 'I love Parker. I was thinking, "could I love another child as much as Parker?" Yeah I would. He enjoys being around other kids so much.'</p>

<p>Mario left TOWIE in 2018 but recently returned to film a new episode with Parker where he reunited with Chloe and Charlie Sims.</p>

<p>He said: '[Parker] wasn’t phased really. He was very smiley. We did a thing at the end for the 10 year anniversary, it was very cute. He’s actually really good. </p>

<p>'I’ve only gone back for an episode but it was nice. It was nice to see Charlie and Chloe, I grew up with them, and it was nice to see the people behind the scenes as well.'  </p>

<p>He added: 'I was more upset for Becky because I think wedding days are more for the lady, it’s the thing they dream of. Life goes on'</p>

<p>The former Celebrity Big Brother star  doesn't think he would return to TOWIE on a full-time basis as his new life as a father and husband-to-be doesn't suit the dramatic nature of the show.</p>

<p>He said: 'It’s a tough one because the show is based on a lot of drama and I haven’t got time for that. </p>

<p>'If I got to just do things with Parker [that would be great], but that doesn’t really fit the demographic of what TOWIE is and I understand that.'</p>

<p>TOWIE returns to ITVBe on Sunday September 13 at 9pm. </p>
