<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The ex-wife of Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown has told The Mail on Sunday that she was left emotionally shattered by his repeated infidelity during their marriage.</p>

<p>Blythe Brown launched a lawsuit against her husband in July claiming he had ‘sordid extra-marital affairs’ and accusing him of ‘secretly plundering significant sums of their marital assets’, which he allegedly spent on four mistresses, showering one with horses and a home.</p>

<p>Last week, Mr Brown, 56, spoke exclusively to this newspaper to reveal he is countersuing his ex for libel and slander, insisting her lawsuit had ‘no regard for the truth’.</p>

He has said he is countersueing her for libel</p>

<p>But last night, Mrs Brown – who was married to the best-selling author for 21 years – said: ‘This is all about trying to regain my self-respect. After the divorce, I learned Dan had gone to great lengths to lie and to betray me, which left me emotionally shattered.’</p>

<p>Mrs Brown says her husband cheated on her repeatedly during the last six years of their marriage – including with Dutch horse trainer Judith Pietersen, 29, and bought her two horses, one costing £260,000.</p>

<p>She claims the author also had affairs with a hairdresser, his personal trainer and a political official.</p>

<p>‘He even swore to the court in the divorce he had no future projects in the works and told me he was retiring, which clearly wasn’t true. I just don’t recognise the man I knew any more.’</p>

<p>Mrs Brown won an early victory in their fight in August when a Dutch judge ordered Ms Pietersen to disclose her financial records.</p>

<p>Mr Brown said: ‘The lawsuit has been heartbreaking. I have great respect for Blythe. She and I were terrific together, a great couple for many years.’</p>
