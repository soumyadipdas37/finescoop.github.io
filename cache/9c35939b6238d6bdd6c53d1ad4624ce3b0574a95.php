<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has given his strongest hint yet that the JobSeeker payment will continue to be boosted next year.</p>

<p>In April the government doubled the payment to $1,100 as thousands lost their jobs due to coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>The $550 boost has now decreased to $250 and is due to end at the end of December.</p>

<p>In April the government doubled the dole payment to $1,100 as thousands lost their jobs due to coronavirus restrictions</p>

<p>But Mr Fydenberg today said his government is 'leaning' towards extending the boost. </p>

<p>'As a government, later this year, we'll make a decision about further support for people in JobSeeker, but we're leaning in on continuing to provide support,' he told reporters.</p>

<p>Social Services Minister Anne Ruston has said the government would not make a call until it could see the impact of a scheduled reduction in payments.</p>

<p>'We will not be making announcements in budget,' she told reporters last week.</p>

<p>'We don't know what Australia is going to look like on the other side of this pandemic. We don't know when it's going to end.'</p>

<p>'So we will remain agile and we will continue to provide the support that is needed for Australia and Australians.'</p>

<p>About 1.6 million Australians receive unemployment payments.</p>

<p>From today the supplement has been cut to $250 each fortnight. </p>
