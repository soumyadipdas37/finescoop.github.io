<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A seven-year-old boy has been dubbed a real-life Spider-Man after he was filmed channeling his favourite Marvel superhero and climbing up a 10ft high wall.</p>

<p>Footage captured in India shows Yasharth Singh using his arms and legs to effortlessly scale the high wall at his family home without the aid of a harness or safety gear.</p>

<p>The primary school pupil confidently takes his hands off the wall and joins them together before slowly making his way back to the ground and repeating the action.</p>

<p>Seven-year-old schoolboy Yasharth Singh, from India, uses his arms and legs to scale the 10ft wall at his family home</p>

<p>The young boy, who been dubbed a real-life Spider-Man, climbs to the top of the wall without a harness or safety gear</p>

<p>During the clip, Yasharth places his hands and barefeet against the wall and slowly pulls his body up the wall.</p>

<p>The young boy holds his position and joins his hands in a namaste gesture as he reaches the top of the 10ft wall before carefully climbing back down.    </p>

<p>He later said: 'I once watched a Spider-Man movie and I really wanted to be able to climb walls just like him.</p>

<p>'I started trying but the first time I did, I fell down. I kept practising and eventually one day I could climb. I called my brother who called my parents.</p>

<p>'Everyone was shocked but they asked me to not climb again otherwise I could fall and get hurt but I convinced them that I can climb.' </p>

<p>The primary school pupil reaches the top of the 10ft wall and joins his hands in a namaste gesture</p>

<p>Yasharth uses his hands and feet to hold himself steady as he reaches the top of the high wall</p>

<p>The young boy said he tried climbing the walls of his family home after watching a Spider-Man film</p>

<p>Yastharth, who does not wear any safety gear while scaling the high walls, said he is not scared of the height and climbs down carefully to avoid getting hurt. </p>

<p>He added: 'I look forward and not downwards. And if I ever feel like falling, I take the plunge carefully so to not hurt myself.'</p>

<p>The little boy's skills now see locals in the neighbourhood visit his family home in order to see him scaling up the wall and while his parents fear a mishap, they are equally enthralled by the sudden recognition their child has been receiving.  </p>

<p>Mother Garima Singh said: 'One day he was climbing the wall and he called us. Since then he has been practising and now, he's up and down the walls all the time.'</p>
