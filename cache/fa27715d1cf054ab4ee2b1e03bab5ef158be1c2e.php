<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre has described how the millionaire paedophile and his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell fed their victims fruit platters and iced tea to keep them looking 'prepubescent'. </p>

<p>Giuffre claims she spent two years as a 'sex slave' in Epstein's luxury properties, forced to give him erotic massages and 'tuck him into bed' along with other girls. </p>

<p>Speaking to the podcast Broken: Seeking Justice, she said Epstein wanted 'tanned bodies, he wanted petite bodies, he wanted prepubescent bodies' among the girls who would 'lay out completely naked' at Epstein's mansions.  </p>

<p>'Jeffrey had us on these ridiculous diets. It was all organic and it was all like shaved salmon on a bed of pilaf or couscous and vegetables,' she said. </p>

<p>'It was never like carbs, you can't just fill up, they wanted you to look a specific way.' </p>

<p>Julie K. Brown, an investigative journalist credited with bringing some of the claims against Epstein to light, said the financier 'wanted girls who looked young'. </p>

<p>'Even if they were 18, he wanted girls that looked like they were 14. That was very clear to anyone that did the recruiting for him,' she said.  </p>

<p>Giuffre is trying to extract evidence against Epstein from celebrity chef Adam Perry Lang, who worked for Epstein but says he did not witness any of his crimes. </p>

<p>She described on the podcast how Perry Lang would make her pizzas when she was 'starving' and drink beer with her on Epstein's private Caribbean island. </p>

<p>Giuffre described Perry Lang as a 'friend' and called the late-night pizzas a 'small act of rebellion' against the conditions she was allegedly being kept under.    </p>

<p>However, Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly 'reprimanded' the pair when she found out about the small gatherings and 'made sure we weren't talking any more'.  </p>

<p>Giuffre recently wrote a letter to Perry Lang urging him to come forward with any evidence against Epstein. </p>

<p>'He's gone now, he can't hurt us any more,' she says in the letter. </p>

<p>'I'm not here to ruin your life. You have so much knowledge of the various people on the planes, in his homes and anywhere you would have been with him. </p>

<p>'You have the ability and frankly the responsibility to speak now... you could help me on my pursuit of justice.' </p>

<p>Perry Lang acknowledges that he worked for Epstein but says he was 'unaware' of the late financier's crimes. </p>

<p>Epstein and his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who denies federal charges of helping him to recruit and abuse underage girls </p>

<p>Adam Perry Lang (pictured in 2015) worked for Epstein as a chef but denies that he witnessed or knew about any of the paedophile's crimes  </p>

<p>'I never saw sexual activity or nudity, I was never aware of underage girls, I was never told of nor saw any of the depraved acts committed by Epstein and his friends,' Perry Lang said in a statement. </p>

<p>In a message sent directly to Giuffre he praised her 'fierce advocacy' for Epstein victims and promised to speak to her attorneys. </p>

<p>Perry Lang's lawyer also said that the chef was in contact with federal prosecutors in New York who are investigating Epstein's accomplices. </p>

<p>Giuffre's lawyers are also involved in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell, who is awaiting trial on charges of helping Epstein to recruit and abuse underage girls.  </p>

<p>The lawyers have been arguing for the release of Maxwell's deposition in a lawsuit against Giuffre in 2016.   </p>

<p>Maxwell's lawyers argue that her deposition contained 'intimate, sensitive, and personal information' and that its release would wreck her chances of a fair trial. </p>

<p>The British socialite, who denies the claims against her, last month pleaded with judges not to 'let the cat out of the bag' by unsealing the documents. </p>

<p>Giuffre's lawyers responded by saying that other high-profile suspects such as al-Qaeda terrorists and cult leader Charles Manson had been given fair trials.</p>

<p>Quoting from a ruling in the Manson case which ended with the killer being sentenced to life in prison in 1972, Giuffre's lawyers said that massive pre-trial publicity 'does not automatically translate into prejudice'. </p>

<p>Ghislaine Maxwell (pictured in a court sketch during a July 14 hearing) is battling to block the release of documents from her 2016 lawsuit against Virginia Roberts Giuffre </p>

<p>Maxwell's trial is scheduled for next July. She was arrested in New Hampshire on July 2 and is being held in a Brooklyn jail after a judge deemed she was a flight risk.  </p>

<p>A grand jury returned a sealed, six-count indictment against Maxwell on June 29, almost a year after Epstein was charged.  </p>

<p>It alleges that Maxwell groomed three unnamed girls, all under the age of 18, in London, New York, Florida and New Mexico between 1994 and 1997. </p>

<p>She is accused of having befriended them by taking them to the movies or on shopping sprees and 'normalised' abusive behaviour by getting undressed in front of them.   </p>

<p>Maxwell's lawyers have tried to distance their client from Epstein, saying she'd had no contact with him for more than a decade.  </p>

<p>Epstein killed himself at age 66 in August 2019 at a federal jail in Manhattan while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. </p>

<p>He had previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge, and completed a 13-month jail sentence now widely considered too lenient.  </p>

<p>Before Epstein's conviction, he and Maxwell had a network of powerful friends including Prince Andrew, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton.     </p>

<p>Giuffre claims that she had sex with Andrew in the early 2000s. He denies this. </p>
