<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jeffrey Epstein spent an hour of his day watching explicit episodes of Girls Gone Wild while working out and cavorting with nubile young women at his private Caribbean island, as seen in these photos exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>The perverted financier, who committed suicide at age 66 in August 2019, would ride his exercise bike as he watched the X-rated footage -featuring bare-breasted college girls - because it was 'inspiration' for him, a source who spent time on the island told DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Epstein, who reportedly demanded sex three times a day, was transfixed by the graphic videos that showed young women flashing their breasts to the camera in bars and nightclubs.  </p>

<p>New details of his sinister life have further been exposed in never-before-seen photographs of his private island Little St James, which was dubbed 'pedophile' and 'orgy' island by disgusted locals.</p>

<p>Epstein appears in the series of images surrounded by nubile young women, including some who have been accused of participating in his sex trafficking ring. </p>

<p>It is not clear when the photos were taken.</p>

<p>Kellen, now 41, worked for Epstein for 10 years and has previously been described as Ghislaine Maxwell's (together left) 'second in command', 'assistant' or 'lieutenant.' Marcinkova (right), is now 34 and an airline pilot</p>

<p>The revealing pictures also paint a picture of the solace offered on the remote island property that featured swimming pools, private bungalows, a helipad and a private boat dock where guests would take a short ATV ride up to the major residence and bungalows where guests would stay</p>

<p>Despite the beautiful scenes, a catalogue of horrific rapes and abuse is said to have occurred there. Epstein has been accused of trafficking girls as young as 12 to the island. Pictured: Epstein and a young woman about to board his private plane </p>

<p>Kellen, now 41, worked for Epstein for 10 years and has  been described as Ghislaine Maxwell's 'second in command', 'assistant' or 'lieutenant.' </p>

<p>The insider said Epstein and Maxwell were extremely close with Kellen 'always by his side'.</p>

<p>They said: 'She was his shadow. She stayed close to him at all times with her notebook that was color coordinated and she was constantly taking notes about anything that he wanted. </p>

<p>'Anything that he remembered throughout the day, she took notes and managed his life. She was his personal assistant.'</p>

<p>'Jeffrey was always up before everyone else, drinking coffee at that table. He would be taking notes, in his robe every morning, writing down ideas, making phone calls, calling the office. Most of the daily life was spontaneous but Sarah was always by his side,' the insider added.   </p>

<p>Describing Epstein's interactions with Marcinkova, now 34 and an airline pilot, the insider revealed that the pair had a deep and close bond.</p>

<p>One victim previously told how she was raped up to three times a day during a five month stay and was so desperate to escape she even attempted to swim across shark-infested waters.</p>

<p>Sarah Ransome from South Africa previously told of her escape attempt: 'A shark would have been my best friend at that point. I didn't even think about it - it was just, get me away.'</p>

<p>But on the surface, a source who spent time on the island told DailyMail.com, said it seemed like life on the island 'was like a dream come true'. </p>

<p>They added: 'On one side of the spectrum it was paradise and idyllic. But then on the opposite spectrum the dark side was just as extreme.'   </p>

<p>The insider revealed that everything was catered for women – and the bedrooms had any beauty product that a female could wish for.</p>

<p>'The bedrooms were like your ideal Caribbean bungalow that you would find in a five star hotel suite. The linens were crisp and thick. Super high end. Best quality everything.</p>

<p>'It was the best of the best.</p>

<p>'In the bathrooms there was sunscreen, chapsticks, razors and soaps, lotions from well-known beauty brands to manicure and pedicure equipment.</p>

<p>'It was a girl's dream. In the wardrobes there were dresses and shoes. Everything you needed as a young lady was accessible.</p>

<p>'The wardrobes in the bedrooms were full as though somebody lived there. It was like the finest hotel. In the wardrobe there would be three or four different style dresses in several different colours. Spaghetti strap dresses, simple dressed and in every single colour. The garments were very basic standard that would fit anybody.</p>

<p>'On reflection it's extremely creepy that he was trying to accommodate anybody of any size.'</p>

<p>Meals were cooked by a private chef who lived on the island and rustled up new exciting recipes each day for guests, the source explained</p>

<p>For guests wanting to get away from the rest of the group, there were activities for people wanting solitude. 'There were lots of different hiking trails. And around the island there were different bungalows, individual cabins with beds in them. Again it is disturbing to think what happened there.'

<p>The source said of Epstein: 'He was very pensive, quiet, almost playful like a child. Seeing him liaising with his guests it was hard to believe he was this Jekyll and Hyde character'</p>

<p>After spending time on the island, the guest told how Epstein exuded power. They said: 'He was on top of the world. He exuded a level of confidence and security in himself. It was a little bit intimidating'</p>

<p>'Food was eaten at the table he can be seen sitting at. Breakfast, lunch and dinner was served at that table outside. It was fine dining. </p>

<p>'The private chef came up with something new every day. The staff lived there on the island full time.'</p>

<p> 'Jeffrey loved to work out in his personal gym on the island. It was huge, about 3,000 square foot in size. There was an area to do ballet in and a Pilates machine, which was something he was into for a bit.</p>
