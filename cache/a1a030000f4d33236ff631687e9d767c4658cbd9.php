<p>Finding herself: Reinhart revealed she had been doing a lot of healing during the pandemic </p>

<p>Following a 'chaotic' few years, Lili has been using her newfound free time to work on herself.</p>

<p>'I've talked to my therapist weekly and read self-help books... spent time with people who love, appreciate and validate my emotions. It's also been nice to rest and let my body recoup after a gruelling working schedule,' she said.</p>

<p>While Lili admitted to struggling to 'stay sane' during lockdown, she is still appreciative of all that it has allowed her to do.</p>

<p>'It's been hard to stay sane during this time. I've gone through many, many emotions throughout this pandemic. But overall I've grown a lot, actually, and am very grateful to have had this time to myself. The last few years of my life have been chaotic. And so to have had a few months to process my radically changing world and emotions has been vital to my mental sanity.'</p>

<p>'I am always prepared to fight for the rights of other human beings': During this time in lockdown, Lili has fought for causes important to her while embracing her true self</p>

<p>In June, the actress came out as bisexual in an Instagram post showing her support for the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

<p>For Lili, coming out as bisexual was more about showing her support with the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<p>Mountain girl: Reinhart flashed some leg as she soaked up the sunshine </p>

<p>'The LGBTQ+ community always needs public support, and since I'm part of that community, I thought it might be time to come out as bisexual. It was sort of a nonchalant decision and I didn't expect the response that I got, but it was a good response.'</p>

<p>Lili has also protested racial inequality after the death of George Floyd sparked the recent national reckoning.</p>

<p>'I am always prepared to fight for the rights of other human beings. Black Lives Matter has been a strong movement, especially in the U.S., these last few months and I have been trying to contribute to that movement in a positive way,' she said.</p>

<p>This notion has also factored into her acting career, with the actress choosing to work on films that support inclusivity.</p>

<p>'It's also important for me to make sure the films that I produce and work on in the future are racially-diverse and don't include stereotypes that are harmful and add to a racist culture that already exists in film.'</p>
