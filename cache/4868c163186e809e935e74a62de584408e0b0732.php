<p>With a new business in the works, Lohan is clearly looking to secure her roots in Dubai, after having moved to the city in 2014.</p>

<p>'I'm in Dubai. I'm kind of in the Wall Street area of Dubai, it's like Downtown,' explained the Mean Girls actress.</p>

<p>'It's a city built on desert, I came here in 2008 when they had just finished building the Atlantis hotel, and there was none of this here. I've been living in the UAE for six years, but I go back to New York a lot.'</p>

<p>HarperCollins claim that Lohan breached a contract that she signed with them in March 2014, with a promise to turn in the title - rumored to be a tell-all biography - by May 2015, which never materialized.</p>

<p>In legal documents filed by the publishing house, they claim Lohan was given a revised date of March 2017 to get it finished, and that they even paid her an advance of $365k against future royalties, TMZ reports. </p>
