<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian cricket legend Shane Warne and media personality James Brayshaw have remembered fallen star Dean Jones' cheeky humour after his sudden death.</p>

<p>The cricketing world remains in shock after Jones died from a massive heart attack in his hotel lobby in Mumbai on Thursday aged 59. </p>

<p>Warne recalled the brutal sledge he copped from Jones after struggling to take wickets in the early days of his test career.</p>

<p>'In that first Test I was getting smacked around the park, Ravi Shastri skies one to deep cover and Deano takes the catch. He comes into the huddle and says, "Well done champ". He used to call everyone champ. He said, "You’ve got your first one, they can’t take that away from you",' Warne wrote in The Herald Sun.</p>

<p>Shane Warne has recalled Dean Jones' (pictured together) unique sense of humour after the cricket legend died from a heart attack</p>

<p>Jones hits a clean stroke for Australia during a One Day International in February 1990</p>

<p>'Then we went to Sri Lanka in 1992, and I was getting smacked all over the park again, and I got my second Test wicket. He came in the huddle and said, "Well done champ, you now average 435 runs per wicket, well done". Thanks for that, Deano.'</p>

<p>Warne wasn't the only one to recall Jones' sense of humour, with James Brayshaw remembering his brazen confidence in a match against South Australia.</p>

<p>The 53-year-old remembered Jones was in scintillating form with the bat and scored 324, leaving the fieldsman frustrated with his incredible innings. </p>

<p>'We'd had enough of looking at him,' Brayshaw said on Triple M's Rush Hour.</p>

<p>'I'm walking from third slip to first slip and he was on about 280 and I said to him, "Deano, why don't you do us all a favour and f**k off?"' </p>

<p>'He used to have this stupid high-pitched laugh. He'd go "Hahahaha, you're not going to get me out in a week!"'</p>

<p>The flashy batsman and 1980s icon was in India commentating on the IPL T20 tournament alongside a host of other retired superstars of the game.</p>

<p>Former Australian bowler Brett Lee was in the hotel lobby with Jones at the time of his heart attack and desperately tried to save him with CPR and a defibrillator.</p>

<p>Jones was rushed to hospital but couldn't be saved. </p>

<p>He had been staying at the hotel with Lee, West Indies legend Brian Lara and former England spinner Graeme Swann.</p>

<p>A minute's silence was held before Saturday's Trans-Tasman game between the Australian women's team and New Zealand in memory of Jones. </p>

<p>Jones leaves behind his daughter's Augusta and Phoebe - who he had with his wife Jane - and son Koby to his mistress Kerri-Anne Hamilton.</p>

<p>His daughter Phoebe said her family is 'broken' in an Instagram post mourning the loss of her father.</p>

<p>The tribute post was accompanied by a happy snap from her childhood.</p>

<p>'Our family is eternally grateful to Brett Lee for doing everything he could,' she said.</p>

<p>Phoebe thanked cricket fans across the world who put their bats out in honour of 'Deano'.</p>

<p>'We are overwhelmed with your outpouring of kind words, support and tributes,' she said.</p>

<p>'His legacy will live on in every life he touched.</p>

<p>'I just keep staring at my phone waiting for him to call and tell me this is just a bad dream.'</p>

<p>Phoebe Jones uploaded a tribute post to her father with a happy snap from her childhood (pictured)</p>

<p>His daughter Augusta shared her own heartfelt post asking: 'How will I do this without you?'</p>

<p>His other daughter, Augusta shared a series of pictures with her dad as a tribute.</p>

<p>'I cannot believe I am writing this. My heart is broken, My Dad. My Hero. The sweetest and most caring person you could ever meet,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'If only you could see now how many lives you touched. If only you could see now how loved you were.</p>

<p>'You held my hand through the toughest times this year, how will I do this without you?</p>

<p>'The heavens have opened their gates for another angel. Wait for me dad. Everything I do is for you. I love you Dad.'</p>

<p>Koby Dean Hamilton, 11, is Jones' son to Kerri-Anne Hamilton - the cricket star's well documented former mistress </p>

<p>Ms Hamilton told Sydney Morning Herald she was devastated with Jones' shock passing and that the father and son spoke as recently as two days before Jones' death.</p>

<p>In the wake of Jones' passing, Koby told Ms Hamilton: 'It's OK, Mum. I know my dad loved me.' </p>

<p>The former batsman took his son on a FaceTime tour of the studio he was working at.</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton said she was 'heartbroken' over Jones' death.</p>

<p>Despite only meeting Koby after he was two years old, Ms Hamilton said Jones always checked to make sure the pair were okay.</p>

<p>He would video call his son daily and the duo would discuss all things sport.</p>

<p>Ms Hamilton added Jones will always be her son's hero.  </p>
