<p>A car, which police say was stolen, is driven onto the curb on Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, before knocking a street sign over and shattering the glass front of a CoolKicks store, which had previously been raided during protests in May following the death of George Floyd</p>

<p>After breaking through the store front, the vehicle then reversed back out onto the street and then drove off.</p>

<p>Police have said that the vehicle used to smash into the sneaker store had been carjacked on Sunday night in the Venice area, according to ABC7.</p>

<p>The vehicle was then found after the crash abandoned only a few blocks away.</p>

<p>One suspect has been arrested by police and remains in custody while a witness claims another ran off into the neighbourhood after the crash.</p>

<p>It is believed that no merchandise was taken from the store last night after being broken into. </p>
