<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A loose and confident Victoria Azarenka overpowered Elise Mertens 6-1 6-0 on Wednesday to advance to the semi-finals of the U.S. Open where she will face a familiar foe in Serena Williams.</p>

<p>Azarenka, smiling and bobbing her head along to music being played during changeovers, spread the court with 21 winners to dominate 16th seed Mertens in their first career meeting.</p>

<p>She took the first set after the normally rock solid Belgian sent a forehand wide for her 13th unforced error of the frame.</p>

<p>Victoria Azarenka is through to the US Open semi-finals after cruising past Elise Mertens </p>

<p>The Belarusian crushed her Belgian opponent 6-1, 6-0 in a faultless display with 21 winners </p>

<p>Mertens struggled against Azarenka in an error-strewn performance at Flushing Meadows</p>

<p>And the 31-year-old Belarusian did not take her foot off the gas in the second, running Mertens around the court and sealing the win when her opponent dumped a backhand into the net.</p>

<p>Azarenka, who won her first title in four years at the Western &amp; Southern Open last month, said she is appreciating her time on the court more than ever.</p>

<p>'I don't think I have ever enjoyed tennis, to be quite honest,' she said.</p>

<p>'I felt that it was a job and something you were meant to do. Winning, you enjoy it. Losing, I was so upset and for a couple of days I couldn't function normally.</p>

<p>Azarenka says she is 'feeling the moment' after reaching her first Slam semi-final since 2013</p>

<p>'Now nothing bothers me. I can say I am feeling the moment.'</p>

<p>The win saw the two-time Grand Slam champion advance past the quarter-finals at a major for the first time since 2013 but a formidable foe stands in her way in the form of Williams, who defeated Azarenka in her two U.S. Open final appearances in 2012 and 2013.</p>

<p>Williams holds an 18-4 lead in their head-to-head matchups, winning their most recent match at Indian Wells last year.</p>

<p>She will take on six-time US Open champion Serena Williams in Thursday's showdown </p>

<p>'Can it get any better?' Azarenka said of Thursday's semi-final showdown with the American.</p>

<p>'It's an amazing opportunity to play against a champion, somebody who I respect a lot and is my friend.</p>

<p>'So I'm so excited for the opportunity and I hope people are excited too. I hope it will be fun, it will be fun for me.'</p>
