<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A U.S. Navy warship has transited the narrow and sensitive Taiwan Strait for the second time in two weeks.  </p>

<p>Taiwan's Defence Ministry confirmed the operation on Monday amid rising tensions between China and the United States.</p>

<p>The ministry said a U.S. destroyer, which it did not name, had sailed in a southerly direction through the strait and was continuing to sail south.</p>

<p>The ship was on an 'ordinary mission' and the situation was 'normal', the ministry added, without giving details.</p>

<p>The U.S. Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The U.S. guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin sailed through the strait on August 18, in what China's military called an 'extremely dangerous' move.</p>

<p>Both China and the United States have been stepping up their military activities in the region, both around Chinese-claimed Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea.</p>

<p>Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen warned last week of the risk of accidental conflict from the rise in military activities.</p>

<p>China claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.</p>

<p>The United States is Taiwan's main arms supplier and most important backer on the international stage. </p>

<p>The incident comes days after a U.S. warship sailed near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, challenging Beijing's claims on the resource-rich waterway and prompting a warning from the Chinese military.</p>

<p>The US Navy's Pacific Fleet said in a statement that the USS Mustin, a guided-missile destroyer, sailed on Thursday 'in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands to ensure critical shipping lanes in the area remain free and open'.</p>

<p>The Chinese military on Friday accused the US ship of entering 'China's territorial waters' near the islands 'without authorisation'.</p>

<p>The region near the disputed Paracel Islands has seen heightened tensions recently with both the US and China conducting military operations</p>

<p>Chinese forces tracked the warship and then warned it to leave, said military spokesman Li Huamin.</p>

<p>In recent years, China has aggressively pursued its territorial claims in the South China Sea, building small shoals and reefs into military bases with airstrips and port facilities.</p>

<p>Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Taiwan also have competing claims in the South China Sea, through which international trade worth trillions of dollars passes a year.</p>

<p>Tensions have risen this week in the area near the Paracel Islands - called Xisha by Beijing - where the Chinese military has been conducting exercises.</p>

<p>Beijing on Tuesday accused Washington of flying a U-2 spy plane into a no-fly zone to disrupt the drills - which included the ballistic missile launches.</p>

<p>The Pentagon then accused China of destabilising the region and using the military for 'unlawful maritime claims' in a statement criticising the exercises and the use of ballistic missiles in the drills.</p>

<p>The Chinese military on Friday said the US had 'repeatedly provoked trouble in the South China Sea', urging it to 'immediately stop such provocative actions'.</p>
