<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A group of passengers on an Atlas Air flight were forced into an emergency landing after the plane caught fire midair over Honolulu.</p>

<p>The heart-stopping incident on Saturday took place after a military chartered Boeing 767 took off from Hickman Air Force Base on a flight to Guam.</p>

<p>Cell phone footage taken by a passenger inside the plane shows a pitch-black cabin that is sporadically lit up by the raging inferno.</p>

<p>The flames appear just outside a cabin window as turbulence overtakes the aircraft.</p>

<p>A second video taken by a Honolulu resident shows the Atlas Air plane flying over the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport three miles away.</p>

<p>'Oh my god,' one person says, 'is it going to crash? Did you just see the fire come out of it?' </p>

<p>The pilot declared an emergency landing just minutes after takeoff and, fortunately, none of the 212 passengers on board were injured.</p>

<p>Local residents reported hearing a loud explosion around that time and said they saw flashes of light that may have been fire in the sky around 9pm.</p>

<p>'It was quite loud. I’m pretty sure I heard my neighbors down below talking about it,' Kevin Tynan, of Makiki, told KHON 2.</p>

<p>'You can hear a lot of people, it was pretty in tenses for a while there,' he added.</p>

<p>Air travel officials later confirmed that the plan experienced mechanical issues with one of its engines.</p>

<p> 'It was actually scary to watch because you’re scared is this plane going to explode? Is it going to go down?' questioned Rick Bartalini of Kakaako.</p>

<p>The flight, which had 212 passenger on board, took off from Hickman Air Force Base (pictured)</p>

<p>'I was nervous because when I first saw it, it was pretty close. I was like oh my gosh,' Tynan added.</p>

<p>Following the incident, Atlas Air released a statement announcing an inspection into the fire's cause.</p>

<p>'An Atlas Air passenger flight landed safely at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu following a mechanical issue with one engine. At Atlas, safety is always our top priority and we will be conducting a thorough inspection to determine the cause.' wrote Atlas Air.</p>

<p>The incident remains under investigation.</p>
