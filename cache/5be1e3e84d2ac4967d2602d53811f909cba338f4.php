<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kaitlyn Yozviak died on August 26 from cardiac arrest and severe anemia</p>

<p>A 12-year-old Georgia girl may have died as an indirect result of a severe lice infestation that may have gone on for years, investigators said.</p>

<p>Kaitlyn Yozviak died on August 26 from cardiac arrest with a secondary cause being severe anemia, WMAZ-TV reported. Her parents Mary Katherine 'Katie' Horton, 37, and Joey Yozviak, 38, have been charged with her murder.  </p>

<p>Georgia Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Ryan Hilton testified that, at the time of her death, Kaitlyn had 'the most severe' lice infestation that the GBI´s office had ever seen, and it may have lasted on and off for at least three years. </p>

<p>He said he believed repeated bites from the lice lowered her blood iron levels, which likely caused the anemia, and may have triggered the cardiac attack. </p>

<p>Wilkinson County Superior Court Judge Brenda Trammell agreed there was enough evidence for second-degree murder charges against her parents to go forward to a grand jury. The couple was also charged with second-degree child cruelty.</p>

<p>The new details on her death were discussed during a preliminary hearing Monday. </p>

<p>The GBI earlier said the girl suffered 'excessive physical pain due to medical negligence,' although the autopsy results are not yet complete.</p>

<p>Her mother also told investigators Kaitlyn had not bathed within the last week and a half before she died.</p>

<p>When agents got to the home in August, the inside was filthy and in disrepair with vermin covering the mattress, stuffed animals and other furniture in Kaitlyn´s room, Hilton said.</p>

<p>Neighbors told agents they had not seen Kaitlyn playing around the house for the last month and a half to two months before her death.</p>

<p>Georgia Division of Family and Children Services documents show that Kaitlyn´s two brothers were removed from Horton and Yozviak's home because of unsanitary conditions.</p>

<p>In 2008, DFCS opened another case around the time Kaitlyn was born, after the parents decided not to give her up for adoption.</p>

<p>The agency didn´t receive any reports on the family until 2018 where files show a call indicating the home was 'bug-infested, (with) excessive cats, and hazardous conditions.'</p>

<p>Kaitlyn was briefly placed with her aunt, and returned to her parents´ home six days later.</p>

<p>The agency did not hear from the family again until after she died. The last entry in the file is heavily redacted and concerns a conversation between GBI and child welfare authorities.</p>
