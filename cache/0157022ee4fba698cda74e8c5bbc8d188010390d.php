<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dr. Dre's legal team have labelled Nicole Young's request for $2 million a month spousal support as 'absurd'.</p>

<p>Amid the increasingly nasty divorce battle between the duo, who split over the summer after 24 years of marriage, Young had listed her monthly expenses amounting to over $2.5 million earlier this month.</p>

<p>Dre hit back explaining that he already foots the bill for everything Young, 50, needs and also slammed her lawyers for requesting $5 million in fees.</p>

<p>Dr. Dre's legal team has labeled Nicole Young's request for $2 million spousal support a month 'absurd' as the rapper claims he has been paying all her expenses</p>

<p>According to TMZ, the rapper, born Andre Romelle Young, says he is letting Young stay in his Malibu mansion worth between $20-25 million. </p>

<p>He says he has his security team bring Young meals prepared by his personal chef meals 3-5 times per week.</p>

<p>The producer claims he also pays for Young's credit card bills and notes his business manager pays her AmEx Centurion Black Card, and those bills range from $150,000 a month to $350,000 per month. </p>

<p>Dre says all her expenses have been paid apart from some 'unauthorized charges for [Nicole's] attorney's fees,'. </p>

<p>The Forgot About Dre hitmaker calls Young's lawyers 'opportunistic' and that they're exacerbating 'the wrath of an angry person'.</p>

<p>Taking care of things: Dre claims he's letting Young stay in his Malibu mansion and has his chef prepare her meals 3-5 times per week. He says he also pays her credit cards</p>

<p>He claimed he offered to pay her attorneys $350,000 through the end of the year but found out Young had already taken $400,000 out of his record company's business account. </p>

<p>According to TMZ, Dre says nevertheless, he's willing to pay Young's expenses. </p>

<p>Earlier this month Young listed her expenses to justify her request for almost $2 million.</p>

<p>$900,000 for entertainment</p>

<p>$135,000 for new clothes</p>

<p>$10,000 for housekeeping and laundry services </p>

<p>$60,000 for tuition and living expenses</p>

<p>$125,000 on charitable contributions</p>

<p>$100,000 for the mortgage</p>

<p>$20,000 for telephone, cell phone, e-mail</p>

<p>Plus additional individual expenses amounting to $2,530,000 </p>

<p>It included $900,000 for 'entertainment', $135,000 for new clothes each month and $60,000 on 'education'. She also requires $10,000 for housekeeping and laundry services.</p>

<p>She's also on the hook for a $100,000 per month mortgage, and she says she needs a head-scratching $20,000 each month to pay for her telephone, cell phone and email use. </p>

<p>She also lists $125,000 each month as charitable donations. </p>

<p>It comes after Dr. Dre's business associate Larry Chatman accused Young of stealing money from a business account on two occasions.</p>

<p>Record One studio co-founder Larry Chatman, according to TMZ, has had his legal team correspond with Young over two transactions involving the business account: one last month in the amount of $353,000, then another for $31,457.</p>

<p>Young's name was removed from the account before the latter withdrawal, and she had no legal access to the funds, according to Chatman's lawyers. Dr. Dre and his legal team have sent communications to Nicole and her team that the money be put back into the account immediately or they will sue her for the balance.</p>

<p>Young's lawyer Bryan Freedman said that the latest move from Dr. Dre's camp amounted to 'a clear attempt to smear Nicole's name,' telling the outlet she was authorized to the funds she withdrew amid the marital split.</p>

<p>'As people are well aware, banks do not give out money to people who are not authorized to receive it,' Freedman told the outlet. </p>

<p>The latest: Earlier this month Dre's business associate Larry Chatman accused Young of stealing money from a business account on two occasions </p>

<p>He previously told TMZ that Dr. Dre's complaints about the initial transaction amounted to a 'low-grade PR stunt' intended to distract from the details of the divorce.</p>

<p>'This is just a low-grade PR stunt by Andre and his team to try to change the fact that he was caught red-handed and sued for trying to cheat Nicole out of community property to which she is entitled,' he said. 'There is no question that Nicole had both the contractual and the legal right to have taken this action and Andre's team is well aware of this fact.</p>

<p> The former N.W.A. member and Young have been at odds over a prenuptial agreement, according to the outlet</p>

<p>'Any suggestion she did something untoward is preposterous and pathetic.'</p>

<p>Nicole was previously classified as a trustee and signatory on the account in question, according to the outlet. Record One lawyers previously said that Nicole had committed 'blatant and unjustifiable criminal embezzlement of corporate funds' with the cash withdrawals.   </p>

<p>Insiders with Dre's camp have told TMZ that Nicole's claims he's been emptying the account is false. </p>

<p>Split: Young filed for divorce from The Next Episode artist earlier this summer after 24 years of marriage </p>

<p>Young filed for divorce from The Next Episode artist earlier this summer after 24 years of marriage, as they share two children - son Truice Young, 23 and daughter Truly Young, 19.</p>

<p>The Been There, Done That artist and Young have been at odds over a prenuptial agreement, according to the outlet.</p>

<p>Nicole, who was previously wed to NBA player Sedale Threatt, said she initially signed one, but Dr. Dre later destroyed it during the better times in the marriage.</p>
