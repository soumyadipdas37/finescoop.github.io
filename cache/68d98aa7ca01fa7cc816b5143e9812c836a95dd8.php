<p>Officers claim the teenager was given the chance to shut down Friday's party before he was issued with the fine.</p>

<p>Assistant chief constable Steve Cooper from Nottinghamshire Police said: 'We need to all remember we are very much still in the middle of a global pandemic and we all need to take responsibility for our actions.</p>

<p>'This party was a clear example of a householder who deliberately flouted the rules without a care for anyone else and as a result we have used the full powers we have to deal with this.</p>

<p>'Under current rules we can issue fines to anyone hosting gatherings of more than 30 people which can result in fines of up to £10,000. </p>

<p>'And now we are on the eve of rules becoming even tighter so there can be gatherings of no more than six.'</p>

<p>Neighbours reported the house party to Nottinghamshire Police at around 10.20pm on Friday.</p>

<p>Amy English, council neighbourhood policing inspector for City Central, added: 'Residents have had fair warning that we won't tolerate people flouting the laws and regulations around the Coronavirus restrictions must be adhered to by everyone.</p>

<p>'In this case the resident also had the chance to shut the party down when they were first visited by our council colleagues.'</p>
