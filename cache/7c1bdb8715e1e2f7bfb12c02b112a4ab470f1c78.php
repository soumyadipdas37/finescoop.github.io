<p>The idyllic property belongs to a family who purchased it 23 years ago for its proximity to the water, but are now downsizing and relocating to the south coast.   </p>

<p>The owner, a businesswoman who lives there with her retired husband, said: 'We love being near water and this was perfect.'</p>

<p>She said that despite its proximity to the River Thames, the house had never flooded due to its higher elevation.</p>

<p>It also includes edited versions of letters sent to and from the author, alongside some of her early works and poems. </p>

<p>Estate agents Sothebys Realty say the property will attract a family moving out of London, locals who have always sought river frontage or returning expats.</p>

<p>The literary genius was born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775 and for much of her life, her father George served as the rector of the nearby parishes. </p>

<p>Mr Austen came from a wealthy and respected family of wool merchants but after many centuries, they fell into poverty and George and his sister were orphaned and taken in by relatives.</p>

<p>He later entered St John's College, Oxford on a fellowship where he is believed to have met his future wife Cassandra Leigh.</p>

<p>The Leighs were a prominent family and her father Thomas was rector at All Souls College, Oxford.</p>

<p>She grew up at the university with the gentry and she became engaged to George in 1763.  </p>

<p>Stoneleigh Abbey had been acquired by Sir Thomas Leigh, Lord Mayor of London, in 1558.</p>

<p>Charles I gave Leigh the barony after he offered hospitality when the gates of Coventry were closed to Charles during the Civil War.</p>

<p>It stayed in the Leigh family from 1561 to 1990 and they became the largest land-owners in Warwickshire.  </p>
