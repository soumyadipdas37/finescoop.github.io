<p>ISIS jihadists have overrun paradise islands where Bono and Daniel Craig holiday, torching luxury villas and imposing Sharia law</p>

<p>Luxurious hotels and beach-front villas on the island of Vamizi, Mozambique, have been razed to the ground by the Islamist terrorists</p>

<p>The residents were ordered to abandon their homes before A-list eco-retreats were torched, witnesses said</p>

<p>Today, along with three other neighbouring islands, militants calling themselves Islamic State Central Africa Province have commandeered the white sands.</p>

<p>It comes after IS last month captured and established Sharia law in the nearby strategic port town of Mocimboa da Praia on the mainland, in the gas-rich province of Cabo Delgado. </p>

<p>The assault is the latest in an intensifying three-year insurgency in the country's north which has killed at least 1,300 people and threatened plans worth billions to turn Mozambique into the 'Qatar of Africa.'  </p>

<p>Mocimboa da Praia lies less than 50 miles south of Afungi peninsula where a liquefied natural gas facility, one of Africa's biggest single investment projects, is located. </p>

<p>It is believed that ISIS may use their new islands to launch amphibious assaults to cut off these lucrative supply lines.</p>

<p>Energy companies have been forced to build new facilities to avoid contact with the insurgents and villages along the edge of the zone are often raided, The Times reports. </p>

<p>Britain is supporting the development of the gas field with a £1 billion loan. </p>

<p>Centrica, British Gas's parent company, has pledged to buy 2.6 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas from the Afungi peninsula for the next 20 years.</p>

<p>A resident of Mecungo island told AFP that the ISIS fighters arrived under cover of darkness and rounded up the villagers.</p>

<p>'They told us to run if we want to live. Everyone left the island,' the resident said. </p>

<p>The majority Muslim population of the northernmost Cabo Delgado province, which borders Tanzania, is also the location of one of the world's largest ruby mines. </p>

<p>Mozambique soldiers patrol the northern town of Mocimboa da Praia before it was taken over by the ISIS militants last month</p>

<p>The newfound naval prowess of the ISIS militants and their strategic bases on the coast has caused concern among security analysts. </p>

<p>The IS-affiliated group has the stated goal of establishing a caliphate in the region.</p>

<p>In addition it has threatened 'franchise' attacks in South Africa if it deploys troops to help its neighbour. </p>

<p>ISCAP has claimed several attacks since June 2019 via social media, often posting images of slain soldiers and caches of weapons. </p>
