<p>The three-time Ascot Gold Cup winner was beaten a short neck by Aidan O’Brien’s Anthony Van Dyck as the race turned into a 500metre burn-up.</p>

<p>The mile-and-a-half Prix Foy was run in a time eight-and-a-half seconds slower than the Grand Prix de Paris won by O’Brien’s Mogul. </p>

<p>Stradivarius was narrowly beaten by Anthony Van Dyck at the Prix Foy at Longchamp</p>

<p>Stradivarius is likely to face a stronger pace and more stamina-sapping conditions on October 4. </p>

<p>And Gosden confirmed the intention was still for the colt to join stablemate Enable in the Arc.</p>

<p>Gosden said: ‘It was a stroll in the park and then a sprint. He has run a very nice trial.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think Frankie (Dettori) wanted to go out in front. He wanted a feel of the track. I thought his last furlong was his best furlong and he ran out of real estate in the end.’</p>
