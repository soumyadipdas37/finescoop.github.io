<p>Going bush? I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! host Julia Morris (pictured) has confirmed the show will go ahead in 2021... and it could be filmed in NSW</p>

<p>'I've gotta say that would be my my dream come true [to film the show locally in NSW] this year with all the traveling,' she continued.</p>

<p>Julia said with the future of international and domestic travel up in the air, producers are yet to make a decision on the location.</p>

<p>'Are we even allowed to go up to our beloved Africa? You know, if there was any time when... somewhere needed our production dollars, it's now in South Africa.' </p>

<p>Revealed: Speaking to The Kyle and Jackie 'O' Show on Wednesday, Julia explained: 'Nothing has been confirmed yet, we have literally been waiting for September for the federal government to work out what we're allowed to do'. Pictured with co-host Chris Brown</p>

<p>'We're definitely doing the show for 2021. We just don't really know where yet. So it's wonderful to know that that set is a up our sleeve.' </p>

<p>The UK version of the show, which has been filmed in Australia for almost two decades, has also been forced to reconsider its location due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Back in May, ViacomCBS executive Beverley McGarvey confirmed the show would 'definitely be back next year' and that a potential change of format was on the cards.  </p>

<p>At the time, Ms McGarvey explained I'm A Celebrity... could 'absolutely' be filmed Down Under.  </p>

<p>'The jungle is kind of a character in the show, but we just don't know if that's possible or realistic, so we're just looking at a range of options,' she told news.com.au. </p>
