<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Harry Kane is likely to leave Tottenham at the end of this season if Jose Mourinho fails to steer Spurs to a trophy, claims Glenn Hoddle. </p>

<p>Daniel Levy targeted Mourinho has a serial winner to replace Mauricio Pochettino last season and the Portuguese is under pressure to deliver some silverware for the north London club. </p>

<p>In an interview with The Gary Newbon Sport Show on Punching.TV, former Tottenham and England boss Hoddle said: 'Harry Kane needs a bit of silverware at the end of this season if he's going to stay. </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho is under pressure to bring in silverware or risk losing his key players</p>

<p>'I think Gareth Bale's come to win trophies for Tottenham, I think Son is another one who wants to win something for Tottenham. </p>

<p>'There's a lot of players there who put in a lot of hard work building Tottenham up in the last four or five years, going to the Champions League final, but they haven't won anything, haven't got anything to show for the work that has been put in and its a make or break season for them.'</p>

<p>Kane is club captain and has progressed through the ranks to make it but has never ruled out eventually leaving with Manchester United among the clubs with a long-held interest in the England striker. </p>

<p>And Hoddle went on to back Mourinho's managerial ability to get the job done despite the criticism surrounding him before he lost the United job. </p>

<p>Glenn Hoddle believes that Tottenham need to win something this season to keep Harry Kane</p>

<p>Kane scored once and delivered four assists to Son Heing-min in the win over Southampton</p>

<p>The 62-year-old added: 'I hope he hasn't lost his mojo. Even people say, "at Manchester United he didn't do well, it wasn't for us, he didn't do well", he won two trophies! </p>

<p>'If he won the Europa League and FA Cup for Tottenham, they'd be holding him up and taking him around that lovely new stadium.'  </p>

<p>The Spurs legend also weighed in on Dele Alli's future, with the midfielder linked to an exit having been dropped by Mourinho for the Southampton clash.  </p>

<p>Alli is off form and has been linked with an exit but Hoddle thinks he needs to knuckle down </p>

<p>'Dele Alli would be the first to admit he's not playing at his very best', Hoddle said.  </p>

<p>'I think what Jose knows is that Dele Alli at his very best is a goalscoring machine and when they get him back to his best - and he will come through, he's only a young lad not hit his peak - he'll come through it without a doubt. </p>

<p>'I hope Alli doesn't down tools, he needs to knuckle down, improve his play and he'll be back in the team.'</p>
