<p>The CCTV footage was recorded near Coventry, West Midlands, as the suspect opened fire on Thursday night.</p>

<p>Police have now imposed a dispersal order and said that they are now ploughing 'significant' resources into its effort to catch the offenders behind the attack.</p>

<p>In the clip, a group of young men standing together on the pavement can be seen ducking for cover as the gunman opens fire from beyond the camera.</p>

<p>The assailant is then thought to have driven off at speed in a dark-coloured vehicle.  </p>

<p>Three people were injured after the gunman, who is thought to have had an accomplice driving a car, opened fire.</p>

<p>Two of the victims have been discharged from hospital but a third continues to receive medical treatment.     </p>

<p>Bystanders were forced to run for cover after a gunman struck in a triple shooting outside a Chinese takeaway in Coventry, West Midlands</p>

<p>A police spokesman said: 'The man that we thought was most seriously injured was less serious than first thought and has been discharged from hospital. One still remains in hospital in a stable condition.</p>

<p>'We are continuing to put significant resources into patrolling the area and trawling CCTV to apprehend the offenders. We also have a Dispersal Order in place in Far Gosford Street.' </p>

<p>Dispersal powers are granted under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 and mean officers can direct anyone to leave an area whose behaviour is likely to cause alarm, harassment or distress.</p>

<p>The road was initially closed while police forensically examined the scene and went door-to-door speaking to traders following the incident on Thursday night</p>

<p>Police also have the power to seize items that are used to cause distress, including bicycles.  </p>

<p>Speaking the day after the incident, Chief Inspector Paul Minor, of Coventry Police, said: 'We'll be stepping up patrols in the area over the coming days.</p>

<p>'This was outrageous violence on the streets of the city centre and we're doing everything we can to bring those responsible to justice.'</p>
