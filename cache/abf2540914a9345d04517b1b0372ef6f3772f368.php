<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A rampaging goat was caught on camera clambering into a police patrol car before chewing up paperwork and knocking an officer to the ground.</p>

<p>The body-cam footage was recorded by a police deputy in north-central Georgia last week. </p>

<p>The officer was serving civil papers at a house in the area when she spotted the goat inside her patrol car, according to the Douglas County Sheriff Department.</p>

<p>She eventually managed to get the animal to leave the vehicle but it head-butted her to the ground before scarpering. </p>

<p>The Douglas County Sheriff Department reported the deputy was not physically injured during the bizarre encounter. </p>

<p>A mischievous goat was caught on camera clambering into a police car before chewing up paperwork and knocking an officer to the ground in north-central Georgia last week</p>

<p>In the video, the deputy begins to walk toward her car before she sees the goat through the window eating paper.</p>

<p>She swings the passenger door open and attempts to scare it off by waving her arm around and saying: 'Get out, c'mon, get out, go.'</p>

<p>The deputy, who had left her driver's door open, then walks around to grab the goat who continues to keenly eat through the files.</p>

<p>She manages to snatch the rest of the paper from under the animal's hooves before eventually encouraging it to get out of the car.</p>

<p>But as she attempts to wrestle the last piece of paper from its mouth it head-butts her and knocks her to the ground.</p>

<p>She is able to get back to her feet and chuckles which is where the video ends.</p>

<p>The Douglas County Sheriff Department reported the deputy was not physically injured during the bizarre encounter.</p>

<p>The department later wrote a Facebook post about the incident that read: 'To explain what you are about to see, the deputy went to a residence to serve some civil papers.</p>

<p>'The deputy explained that due to the number of houses she visits daily, she routinely leaves her vehicle's door open because she has had to retreat on a number of occasions from vicious dogs. </p>

<p>'Never once did she expect or even consider what was about to happen this day! </p>

<p>'Even though she was knocked to the ground she was not physically harmed in the incident. At the end of the day we all got a little laugh out of it and we hope you do as well!' </p>
