<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has claimed Arsenal are unwilling or unable to meet their valuation of Houssem Aouar.</p>

<p>The French midfielder played a pivotal role in Lyon's run to the Champions League semi-finals last season and has attracted heavy interest from Mikel Arteta and the Gunners as a result.</p>

<p>But with the 22-year-old now one of the hottest properties in Europe, Lyon are said to be holding out for a fee within the region of £44million, which Aulas says the Gunners are unlikely to match before the close of the transfer window.</p>

<p>Lyon's president has claimed Arsenal are unwilling to meet their valuation of Houssem Aouar</p>

<p>Aulas (above) is said to be demanding around £44m for the French midfield star this summer</p>

<p>Asked by journalist Chris Wheatley if the Lyon star would make a move to north London before October 6, Aulas replied: 'No I don't think so, no offer yet.</p>

<p>'It seems that Arsenal don't want to, or can't invest the price for Houssem, who is our best player.'</p>

<p>Aulas' comments come a week after Lyon's sporting director Juninho admitted Arsenal technical director Edu had spoken to him about Aouar.</p>

<p>The former Brazil international publicly declared the Premier League side's interest in the midfielder and said the possibility of including Matteo Guendouzi in a swap was discussed by ultimately rejected.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta's Arsenal are heavily linked with him but Aulas believes he will not move there</p>

<p>'Houssem Aouar is really well liked by Arteta,' said Juninho. </p>

<p>'There were some discussions for Guendouzi, who is also a good player. He was brought up during the discussion.</p>

<p>'But we don't need his profile, we were very clear. If it is like that, we are not interested at all, we cut the conversation, that is where things ended.'</p>

<p>Arteta himself has refused to comment on constant speculation about his side's interest in Aouar and Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey.</p>

<p>Aulas' comments come after Lyon sporting director Juninho declared Arsenal's interest</p>

<p>But following the club's hard-fought 2-1 victory against West Ham, Arteta admitted he is still looking to add to his squad before the transfer window slams shut.</p>

<p>'Depending on what happens with some other players, we are open to discussions,' Arteta said.</p>

<p>'The market can surprise us. [Teams] can come for any of our players in different positions and we have to react, like it happened with Emi [Martinez]. So let's see what happens.'</p>

<p>Arteta is reportedly keen to add Aouar and Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey to his squad</p>
