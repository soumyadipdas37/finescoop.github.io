<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Joe Biden's granddaughter Naomi Biden has blasted President Trump after he took aim at her father Hunter and late uncle Beau during a trainwreck presidential debate Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old tweeted her contempt for the president as the two candidates went head to head for the first time in Cleveland, just 35 days before the election. </p>

<p>'I wouldn't have survived 5 minutes on that stage without slapping him across the face - and I don't think I'm alone in thinking that,' Naomi said of Trump. </p>

<p>'So tell me how someone Trump calls 'sleepy joe' and says is on uppers could wade through an hour and a half of this nonsense,' she added. </p>

<p>Naomi Biden (pictured far right with grandfather Joe Biden in 2018) blasted President Trump after he took aim at her father Hunter during Tuesday's debate</p>

<p>Naomi said she wouldn't have 'survived 5 minutes' without 'slapping [Trump] across the face' </p>

<p>During the trainwreck debate, Biden and Trump repeatedly shouted over each other and insulted each other</p>

<p>Her comments were in reference to the Trump campaign's earlier claims that Biden would use an earpiece and performance enhancing drugs during the debate.  </p>

<p>She also slammed Trump as the 'worst president in American history' and urged followers to vote him out of office in November. </p>

<p>During the 90-minute televised event, Biden and Trump repeatedly shouted over each other and insulted each other as moderator Chris Wallace lost control of the debate.</p>

<p>Things took a personal and nasty turn more than hour into the angry clash when Trump went after Biden's children.   </p>

<p>Trump brought up Hunter Biden's history with drugs as well as claims the 50-year-old investment advisor took $3.5million from the wealthy wife of the former Mayor of Moscow.</p>

<p>Last week, Naomi defended her father in a tweet thread, describing him as a man 'filled with love, integrity, and human struggles.' </p>

<p>Naomi also blasted Trump as the 'worst president in American history' in a series of tweets</p>

<p>Trump brought up a Senate Republican report that claimed Hunter got $3.5 million from the wealthy wife of the former Mayor of Moscow. Hunter Biden's lawyer has denied the characterization</p>

<p>'The pain he has endured would be enough to make a lesser man give up on life all together. But despite the best efforts of an cruel few to destroy a private man, he is sober, happy, and as at peace as ever today because as long his family needs him, he has not lost his purpose,' she said. </p>

<p>During the debate, Biden had brought up recent claims that Trump had referred to fallen troops as 'suckers' and 'losers', which the president again denied.</p>

<p>The former VP then made an impassioned pitch for his late son Beau's military service. He spent a year in Iraq serving in the National Guard.</p>

<p>'Speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military - the way you talk about them being losers and being, and just being suckers - my son was in Iraq and he spent a year there,' Biden said.</p>

<p>'He got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot. And the people left behind there were heroes,' said Biden.</p>

<p>'You talking about Hunter?' Trump asked, bringing his embattled younger son into the exchange.  </p>

<p>Naomi defended her father in a tweet thread last week, describing him as a man 'filled with love, integrity, and human struggles'</p>

<p>Biden answered he was speaking of Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015. </p>

<p>'I don't know Beau. I know Hunter,' Trump interrupted, then amped up his attacks.</p>

<p>'He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use. And he didn't have a job until you became vice president,' Trump said.</p>

<p>'That's not true. None of that is true,' Biden responded.</p>

<p>'He made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow, in various other places,' Trump said.</p>

<p>During Tuesday's debate, Biden had brought up recent claims that Trump had referred to fallen troops as 'suckers' and 'losers'. He made an impassioned pitch for his late son Beau's military service (pictured together in 2009). He spent a year in Iraq serving in the National Guard</p>

<p>Hunter Biden received an administrative discharge from the Navy in after failing a drug test for cocaine in 2013.</p>

<p>He was seeking to be commissioned as a reserve officer. He did not receive a dishonorable discharge, but an administrative one, according to press accounts at the time.</p>

<p>Biden responded: 'My son, like a lot of people we know at home, he had a drug problem.'</p>

<p>'He's fixed it. He's worked on it,' Biden said. 'And I'm proud of him.'</p>

<p>Earlier in the night, Trump took yet another shot at Hunter, saying: 'And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars.' </p>

<p>It was a reference to business Hunter Biden did with his firm Rosemont Seneca Partners, LLC.</p>

<p>Trump brought up a Senate Republican report that claimed Hunter got $3.5million from the wealthy wife of the former Mayor of Moscow. Hunter Biden's lawyer has denied the characterization.</p>

<p>'What did he do to deserve it?' Trump asked.</p>

<p>'My son did nothing wrong in Burisa,' said Biden – after Trump expanded his attack to Hunter Biden's lucrative seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.</p>
