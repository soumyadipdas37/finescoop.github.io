<p>Another wrote: '#Honour on ITV is utterly heartbreaking. It's beyond comprehension that someone was murdered by her own family for falling in love.' </p>

<p>The powerful ITV drama tells the powerful story of DCI Caroline Goode's (played by Keeley Hawes) passionate search to discover the fate of Banaz after she disappeared.</p>

<p>In tonight's concluding episode, Banaz's father Mahmod Mahmod and uncle Ari Mahmod were convicted of her murder after she fell in love with a man of her own choosing and who her family disapproved of - Kurdish immigrant Rahmat Sulemani (played by Moe Bar-El) - who committed suicide 10 years after the court verdict. </p>

<p>Viewers took to Twitter in their droves to 'thank God' the men responsible were brought to justice, with one tweeting: 'It's not often a drama reduces me to tears but this one has, what an absolutely heartbreaking and utterly shocking event that took place'</p>

<p>Audiences at home watched horrified as Banaz's tortured body was discovered in a suitcase buried in a Birmingham garden. Pictured, DCI Goode at the scene </p>

<p>When DCI Goode's team discovered Banaz's body, the detective admitted: 'I was praying to God we'd find her here, until I saw it.'</p>

<p>But forensic specialists revealed the horrifying news that they would struggle to remove Banaz's body from the suitcase, and wouldn't find any DNA.</p>

<p>'I'm not sure we'll be able to get her out, I think she'll just fall apart,' the officer confessed. </p>

<p>'I'd be surprised if we could get her [DNA] out of this mess, let alone anyone else's.' </p>

<p>DCI Goode later spoke with the translator who helped the police with their case, and asked: 'What kind of people think that anything in the world is more important than their own children's lives?' </p>

<p>In tonight's concluding episode, Banaz's father and uncle were convicted of her murder after she fell in love with a man of her own choosing and who her family disapproved of, Kurdish immigrant, Rahmat Sulemani (pictured, played by Moe Bar-El)</p>

<p>'People for whom life is worthless without honour,' he replied before a tense DCI Goode snapped: 'Are you defending them?'</p>

<p>'Not at all,' the translator shot back. 'But you must understand they protect the honour of the family name, because otherwise nobody will marry their children and their children will starve.'</p>

<p>'Not here, not in this country,' DCI Goode argued, to which the translator responded: 'Why do you think I bring my family here?</p>

<p>'The men in her family are all such idiots... look at what they've done to their own family, the waste. They are on every tongue in the country, their actions bring disgrace to the entire Kurdish community. They dishonour us all.'</p>

<p> When DCI Goode's (pictured) team discovered Banaz's body, the detective admitted: 'I was praying to God we'd find her here, until I saw it'</p>

<p>In yesterday's premiere, audiences at home saw one of the five killers - Mohammed Hama, who had been arrested - 'boast and laugh' about the murder when calling his friends, unaware his phone calls were being monitored by the police. </p>

<p>And this evening, he claimed that while he didn't kill Banaz, he would be 'greeted as a hero' in his own country for helping 'bring justice'.</p>

<p>'I did not kill her,' he told his lawyer. 'I went to Birmingham. I helped put her in the earth, we pulled up the stones, we dug the hole, I pulled up the suitcase, it broke the pipe and the water came, that's all.'</p>

<p>'In my own country I have done justice, that's the truth. In my own country, if ever I go home, they will greet me as a hero,' he added, before saying he would admit to his crimes.</p>

<p>The trial for Banaz's uncle and father saw the young girl's sister and boyfriend stand in the witness box, describing how they had both had death attempts or threats made against them by Banaz's family.</p>

<p>After hearing the violence and threats that Banaz's sister experienced as a child, the jury found both the uncle and father guilty of murder - much to the relief of anguished viewers.</p>

<p>One tweeted: '[Banaz] got the justice she deserved. It could've been prevented if those other police officers had listened to her #Honour.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Banaz actually gave the police a list of the men who killed her. Chilling on so many levels.'</p>

<p>'Poor Banaz. Horrendous. Glad there was some justice,' one added. </p>

<p>In yesterday's episode, the young girl's family members were arrested after Kurdish immigrant Rahmat reported the disappearance of his girlfriend, Banaz. </p>

<p>Banaz had left her husband the previous year due to alleged physical and sexual abuse, returning to live with her parents in the South London borough of Merton. In real life, her estranged husband was never charged with an offence related to Banaz. </p>

<p>She had subsequently started a relationship with Rahmat, who explained to the police that for a Kurdish woman to leave her husband brought shame on the community, and especially after then picking a 'love match'. </p>

<p>Other actors involved in the series include Waj Ali, Ahd, Rhianne Barreto, Michael Jibson and Robby Haynes. Honour was written by Vanity Fair's Gwyneth Hughes and directed by Mrs Wilson's Richard Laxton. Keeley has also served as an executive producer. </p>

<p>Talking about the ITV drama based on real-life events, Keeley said: 'It is a privilege to be working on Honour as Buddy Club's first ever project. </p>

<p>'In a time where honour killings are still rife, it is critical to shine a light on such an important subject. Banaz Mahmod's story, and DCI Goode's subsequent investigation, is certainly one that needs to be told and I am proud to be a part of it.'</p>

<p>Banaz Mahmod, 20, an Iraqi Kurdish from south London, was raped and killed in January 2006 on the orders of her father Mahmod Mahmod after she left her alleged abusive husband and fell in love with another man, Rahmat Sulemani, who her family did not approve of.</p>

<p>She was raped, tortured and strangled to death with a bootlace after she walked out of a marriage she had been forced to enter just three years earlier at 17.</p>

<p>Her body was put in a suitcase and taken to the Midlands before being buried in a make-shift grave in a back-garden in Handsworth, Birmingham. </p>

<p>In 2007, following a three-month trial at the Old Bailey, her father, Mahmod Mahmod, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her uncle, Ari Mahmod, was also found guilty over the killing and sentenced to 23 years.</p>

<p>Mohamad Hama also admitted murder and was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison. </p>

<p>Three years later, Banaz's cousins Omar Hussain and Mohamad Saleh Ali, who carried out the killing, were extradited from Iraq and given life sentences.</p>

<p>The young woman's nightmare when she was forced to enter a marriage to a Kurdish man, then aged 28, who she later told police was 'very strict'.  </p>

<p>She had met her husband-to-be only three times before her wedding day and, according to Banaz, her husband regularly physically and sexually abused her.</p>

<p>Her estranged husband was never charged with an offence related to Banaz. </p>

<p>From December 2005 to January 2006 Banaz told police five times that her family had wanted her dead and described the sexual violence she had allegedly been forced to endure at the hands of her abusive husband. </p>

<p>In a recorded interview with police prior to her death, Banaz told an officer that she was being followed by members of the Iraqi-Kurdish community.</p>

<p>Mr Sulemani never recovered from the death of his beloved girlfriend and committed suicide in 2016, after reportedly telling police there was 'no life' for him. </p>
