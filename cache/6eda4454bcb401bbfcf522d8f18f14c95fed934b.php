<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hugh Jackman's wife Deborra-lee Furness dismissed speculation her husband is 'gay' during her appearance on Anh's Brush with Fame on Tuesday. </p>

<p>And according to Hugh, 51, the source of these baseless rumours likely dates back to 2003, when he played openly gay singer-songwriter Peter Allen in The Boy from Oz on Broadway.</p>

<p>As part of the role, Hugh was required to kiss his male co-star Jarrod Emick on stage - a surprise to fans who were used to seeing Hugh in the role of macho Marvel character Wolverine.</p>

<p>Origins: How an on-stage kiss 17 years ago made Hugh Jackman the subject of false and hurtful gay rumours - as the actor's wife Deborra-lee Furness blasts the 'mean-spirited' speculation. Pictured: Hugh Jackman performing in The Boy from Oz </p>

<p>In 2018, Hugh told a US radio station he believes the on-stage kiss sparked the persistent whispers about his sexuality. </p>

<p>'Some dudes do get upset, some dudes say, 'Don't say I'm gay' [but] I am good,' he said, as reported by The Metro. </p>

<p>'I was literally just locking lips... I started to laugh so hard,' Hugh recalled of having to kiss his co-star on stage.</p>

<p>'I was literally just locking lips': As part of the role, Hugh was required to kiss his male co-star Jarrod Emick on stage - a surprise to fans who were used to seeing Hugh in the role of macho Marvel character Wolverine</p>

<p>'So I stay kissing him, because I thought, 'I'm just going to laugh. I'm going to stay here until it subsides', and it never subsided and the whole audience could see my body shaking, so they started.'</p>

<p>When The Boy From Oz finished it's tenure on Broadway and began showing in Australia in 2006, however, Hugh was no longer required to kiss his on-stage male lover - who was now being played by Australian actor Murray Bartlett. </p>

<p>'We just wanted to keep it very simple and very pure,' Bartlett told The Sydney Morning Herald of the decision to remove the kiss. </p>

<p>Stoic: 'Some dudes do get upset, some dudes say, 'Don't say I'm gay' [but] I am good,' he said, as reported by The Metro </p>

<p>In fact, the same-sex kiss was never part of the original musical when it was launched in Australia n 1998, and was only added into the script when the production began on Broadway in 2003. </p>

<p>On Tuesday's episode of Anh's Brush with Fame, Hugh's wife Deborra-Lee, 64, rolled her eyes when asked about the rumours her husband is 'gay'.  </p>

<p>'I see these magazines and they're so mean-spirited… I hope people realise it's all made up,' she said. </p>

<p>Speaking out: Deborra-Lee addressed long-running rumours husband Hugh is 'gay' during her appearance on Anh's Brush with Fame on Tuesday</p>

<p>She added: '[Hugh's] been gay for so many years, I was gay too when I did [the 1988 film] Shame. They were shocked when I got married. </p>

<p>'It's just wrong. It's like someone saying to Elton John, 'Oh he's straight'. I'm sure he'd be p**sed! </p>

<p>'And so what! What are we discussing here… Is he a vegetarian… Is he gay?' </p>

<p>Speculation: '[Hugh's] been gay for so many years, I was gay too when I did [the 1988 film] Shame. They were shocked when I got married,' she said </p>
