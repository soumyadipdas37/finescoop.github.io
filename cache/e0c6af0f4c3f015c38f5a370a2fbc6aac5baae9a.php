<p>The outing comes after Mel recently hit out at Keith Lemon as she branded men 'basic and limited' during a rant about her love life.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the presenter said she felt 'sorry' for British men as she let rip at the ITV2 star during an interview for her own Frank magazine.</p>

<p>'Sadly, in all realms of life, most men are pretty basic and disappointing,' she said.</p>

<p>Conversation: Mel recently hit out at Keith Lemon as she branded men 'basic and limited' during a rant about her love life</p>

<p>'I feel a bit sorry for British men who have adopted the limited vocabulary of the television character Keith Lemon when talking about and to women.</p>

<p>'I would be surprised, and indeed it would be a miracle, if any of these men are actually getting laid', the TV personality added.  </p>

<p>Mel has previously appeared on Celebrity Juice where comedian Leigh Francis takes on the persona of host Keith. </p>

<p>In light of her comments, Keith told The Sun he contacted the TV personality, who said she was merely referencing the persona he portrays on screen. </p>

<p>Keith, who is the alter ego of Leigh Francis, said: 'I reached out to her and asked why she didn’t like me. She said, "It’s not you, it’s your on-screen persona".</p>

<p>Not happy: In light of her comments, Keith said he contacted the TV personality, who said she was merely referencing the persona he portrays on screen</p>

<p>The star then noted some of his career achievements over the years as he defended himself.</p>

<p>He said: 'Well if anyone’s watching and you have a limited vocabulary, you can still win two Baftas and two NTAs. I don’t want to boast about all the things I’ve won.' </p>

<p>Elsewhere, Mel was previously married to Daniel Caltagirone between 2001 and 2009 and the couple share two sons Roman and Valentino.</p>

<p>Her second marriage to Jack Cockings ended in 2016 and she has since enjoyed romances with the likes of Jamie Theakston, Martin Kaymer, Olly Murs and Steve Coogan.</p>
