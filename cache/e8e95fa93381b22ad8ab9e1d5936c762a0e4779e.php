<p>The Australian label, which has been producing its sweat, urine and period absorbing underwear since 2013, first announced its swimwear on Kickstarter in 2017</p>

<p>Since then they have curated a $100 one piece suit and $40 bikini pant for women than can be mixed and matched with your choice of top (pictured), and an $89.50 racerback one piece for teenagers alongside a $38 pair of bottoms</p>

<p>While they originally created the costumes in a black colourway, on July 14 the brand introduced navy to its repertoire, giving ladies more options depending on how many days they were going to be in the sun.  </p>

<p>'Our swimwear works with a two-layer technology,' the website read.</p>

<p>'The outer layer is water resistant and the internal layer is moisture-wicking, absorbent and quick-drying, this means that as long as the swimwear fits snug to the body then the internal layer manages any flow from your body while the outer layer stops any ocean flow getting in.'</p>

<p>It's only recommended for those who are 'lightly' bleeding because the inner layer can only hold 10ml, or two tampons worth, but it provides a welcome option at the beginning or end of your period. </p>

<p>'What great timing for the summer ahead. We may not be able to travel but we can feel like we're having a vacation in these swimsuits,' said another</p>

<p>And customers are very excited to test it out Down Under now that the country is experiencing warmer weather.</p>

<p>'How is this even possible. It's so clever! I'd love to try these,' one woman said.</p>

<p>Modibodi founder, Kristy Chong, made headlines around the world when she was constantly irritated with her under-performing underpants and set about creating a product that would support women who suffer bladder weakness and breast milk leaks, as well as during their period.</p>

<p>The bikinis are beloved by all women, irrespective of whether they are on their period or not</p>

<p>'While I was overseas training for a marathon in 2011, my underwear wasn't protecting me against bladder weakness which I had following my second child, and I was missing underwear that looked good, was comfortable, and could protect me by replacing the panty liner,' Kristy told FEMAIL in 2013.</p>

<p>'I spoke to family and friends and found I wasn't alone in my frustrations with the options available.'</p>

<p>So Kristy developed a specially designed underwear option for women that liberates them from panty liners and leaks.</p>

<p>She spent the next two years consulting with over 100 textile engineers in Australia and the US, and 18 months performing extensive scientific tests to develop the most effective fabric technology.</p>

<p>In 2013, after teaming up with leading Australian lingerie designers and manufacturers, the final product was released - Modibodi underwear.</p>

<p>These days the label also sell 'odour and sweat-proof sports bras', 'leak-proof maternity singlets' and underwear in a range of materials and colours.</p>

<p>'I wanted to be able to put the power back into the hands of women every day of the month,' she said.</p>
