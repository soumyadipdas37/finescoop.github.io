<p>In her first brand partnership as a new mother, Jennifer has signed on to be the new face of Bubs Australia, which was founded by fellow Sydney mum, Kristy Carr.  </p>

<p>The Australian icon is officially the first-ever global face of Bubs. </p>

<p>'As a new mother it was a huge decision what brand to choose and trust when I was introducing solids to Frankie,' Jennifer explained.</p>

<p>'The Bubs ethos of healthy nutrition and well-being perfectly aligns with my own values': Jennifer initially discovered Bubs while researching the benefits of rice cereal</p>

<p>Jennifer expressed her desire to start a family in September 2018, following her departure from Myer after 12 years as the department store's ambassador.</p>

<p>Speaking at her final runway show for the retailer, she told the Herald Sun: 'I'd love to have a family, it's taking the time to look ahead. I want to have the time to be able to do that.'</p>

<p>Jennifer married property developer Jake in Bali, Indonesia in 2013, after eight years of dating.</p>

<p>The pair broke with tradition and gave their daughter both her mother's maiden name, Hawkins, and her father's surname, Wall.  </p>
