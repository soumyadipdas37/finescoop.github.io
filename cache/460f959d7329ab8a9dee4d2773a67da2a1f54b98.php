<p>Xabi Alonso has been singled out as a potential future boss of German giants Bayern Munich</p>

<p>Ex-midfielder Alonso applauds fans during his farewell match for Bayern in May 2017</p>

<p>And legendary Germany striker Rummenigge believes Alonso has the right personal qualities to one day take on the role of head coach at Bayern.</p>

<p>'He will be a coach who may be of interest to FC Bayern at some point in the future. I can imagine that,' Rummenigge told Bild.</p>

<p>'We are still friends today, he reports regularly.</p>

<p>'Xabi Alonso has this empathy that you need. Especially with today's generation of players to spin such a common thread with them.'</p>

<p>Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has backed Xabi Alonso to be a possible future Bayern Munich coach</p>

<p>Alonso collected three Bundesliga titles, plus a German Cup and Super Cup during his playing time with the Bavarians. </p>
