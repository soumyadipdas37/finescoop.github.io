<p>Brandi says Heather contacted her shortly after she revealed her own secret affair with Denise during a bombshell episode of RHOBH</p>

<p>Brandi has since given DailyMailTV all the juicy details of the affair, claiming Denise is 'sexually aggressive' and instigated the tryst by demanding to see her breasts before throwing her up against a bathroom wall in a restaurant and kissing her passionately.</p>

<p>She also revealed the pair had sex when Denise invited Brandi to visit her on set while filming a movie in northern California.</p>

<p>Brandi said: 'During this whole dramatic situation, during the reunion and whatnot, I get an Instagram DM from Heather Locklear who I literally grew up watching on TV and I was kind of starstruck.</p>

<p>'She said thank you with a bunch of hearts and prayers and I wrote back to her, I said, listen, you know, the truth always comes out no matter how long it takes and that I'm really sorry that you went through what you went through.</p>

<p>'Denise told me that she didn't know Heather, that they weren't friends at all. And now I'm finding out completely the opposite.</p>

<p>'And you know, Denise is now saying that she doesn't know me and we weren't friends at all. So I kind of see how she's operating these days.'</p>

<p>Brandi says her and Heather are texting back and forth and are meeting for lunch this week.</p>

<p>'I feel bad for her because I think that part of a lot of what Heather had to go through (in her marriage) was because of what Denise did,' she said.</p>

<p>'Not that her husband was not part of the problem, but when you have a girlfriend and you think that you're close, you don't think you have to worry about your husband with that person.'</p>

<p>Brandi says that in one message Heather sent, the Melrose Place star wrote: 'I tried to watch the reunion. I just felt sick, I guess about Denise's spirit, such a dark place. So I had to turn it off.'</p>

<p>Brandi, 47, says she asked Heather, 58, if she could show her messages on camera to the rest of the RHOBH cast.</p>

<p>But Heather wrote back: 'Probably best not to show it because I'll get a cease and desist, which she sent me years ago. LOL. I won't even say anything. I support you fully.'</p>

<p>Heather and Denise used to be close pals but their friendship broke apart in the late 2000s as their respective marriages collapsed.</p>

<p>The pair had a falling out in 2006 after Heather found out that Denise was dating her ex-husband, Richie Sambora.</p>

<p>While Denise and the Bon Jovi rocker ended their roller-coaster relationship for good in 2012, she told Redbook magazine at the time that she did not ruin their marriage.</p>

<p>'I was no longer friends with Heather months before Richie and I got together,' Denise said. 'I don’t want to say what caused the split, but she and I weren’t even speaking then.</p>

<p>'It wasn’t ever like we’d be shopping and go back to her house and I’d flirt with her husband. </p>

<p>'Yes, I got together with Heather’s soon-to-be ex-husband, but no, I didn’t have an affair with him.</p>

<p>'If Heather and I had been friends at that time, I would never have crossed that line. But we weren’t. </p>

<p>'The friendship was not salvageable, and in the beginning, Richie and I just talked as friends because we were dealing with similar situations. We never planned for anything to happen.'</p>

<p>She concluded: 'But in my heart, I know I did not break up their marriage. If either Richie or I had felt our marriages were fixable, we wouldn’t have crossed that line… I definitely fell in love with him. That would have been a big price to pay for just some rebound fling.'</p>
