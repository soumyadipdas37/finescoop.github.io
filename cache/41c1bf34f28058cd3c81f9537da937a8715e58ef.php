<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cristiano Ronaldo has played a starring role in a new promotional video for Nike - with a little help from his body double.</p>

<p>The Juventus forward, 35, whose boot deal with Nike is worth an eye-watering £15million, was on set in Turin to shoot an advertisement video to promote his sponsor's new footwear.</p>

<p>And there were some VIP guests in the building looking on from the sidelines with Marisa, the daughter of Ronaldo's super-agent Jorge Mendes, in attendance. She is reportedly his PR manager and has been responsible for all his social media activity since 2016.</p>

<p>Cristiano Ronaldo showed off his leaping abilities during a latest promotional video for Nike</p>

<p>Ronaldo filmed the shoot in Turin and was watched by Jorge Mendes' daughter Marisa</p>

<p>A member of the film crew was chatting to Ronaldo about some of his scenes for the ad</p>

<p>Ronaldo was captured showing off his extraordinary leaping abilities during the shoot as he jumped high above the ground to head the ball.</p>

<p>It wasn't just Ronaldo putting in the elbow grease though as his body double was substituted in to pick up several scenes.</p>

<p>Ronaldo was also pictured mucking around with a tennis ball with a member of the film crew.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old's driver was also watching on and was quick to whisk him away once his day's work had finished.</p>

<p>The Juventus ace looked to be enjoying himself as he mucked around with a tennis ball</p>

<p>Ronaldo has a £15m boot deal with Nike and helped promote their new footwear this week</p>

<p>A body double was brought in for 35-year-old Ronaldo and picked up some of his scenes</p>

<p>Despite his ageing years, Ronaldo is showing no signs of slowing down... even if he did call on a Doppelganger to fill in for him in some of his scenes.</p>

<p>Ronaldo was a key performer for Juventus last season as they won the Serie A title and it was business as usual for him on the opening game of their season last weekend as he scored in a 3-0 victory over Sampdoria.</p>

<p>Next up for Ronaldo and Andrea Pirlo's Juventus side is a tricky trip to Roma. Juventus will need the real Ronaldo to show up once again if they are to continue their perfect start to the season.</p>
