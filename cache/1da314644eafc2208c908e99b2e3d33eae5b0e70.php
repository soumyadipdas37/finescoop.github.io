<p>In a lengthy Instagram video, she said that her fuller face is simply down to weight gain.</p>

<p>'My face has changed a lot since The Bachelorette because I've gained a lot of weight because of Covid and a breakup,' she stated.</p>

<p>'When I was on Bachelorette I was severely underweight and I lost a lot of weight from stress and from working really hard and anxiety,' Angie continued. </p>

<p>'When I'm stressed and have anxiety I can't keep food down, I can't eat, I lose a lot of weight.' </p>

<p>The former Gogglebox star went on to explain that she'd been feeling depressed lately, largely due to her breakup with Carlin. </p>

<p>'Obviously, over the last few months I've probably more so been depressed and my body has decided that it wants to eat more and my weight generally goes to my face and my little wine gut.'</p>

<p>'I've gained a lot of weight': Back in July, Angie shut down speculation that her face has changed due to fillers and plastic surgery</p>

<p>She went on to say that it's not appropriate for anybody to comment on another person's weight or face, as there could be underlying issues behind a change in somebody's appearance.</p>

<p>'I've struggled with a severe eating disorder for most of my life, so I'm embracing the fact that I've gained a good maybe six to eight kilos since Bachelorette.'</p>

<p>She later added: 'I've been up and down a lot lately with family stuff and a breakup and covid and life.'</p>

<p>Angie also confirmed that she 'loves a bit of Botox and filler', but said that she's been getting it for the last five years and it has nothing to do with her plumper facial features.</p>
