<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Utes have never been more popular in Australia with new models of the workhorses evolving into comfortable, family-friendly rides equipped with the latest gadgets. </p>

<p>Formerly the domain of tradies and farmers, utes are now hugely popular with a wider market and now account for more than one in five new car sales in Australia. </p>

<p>Competition between manufacturers is also heating up with the top-selling Toyota Hilux being upgraded and new challengers such as the Isuzu D-Max taking on old favourites like Ford's Ranger. </p>

<p>Utes have never been more popular in Australia with new models of the workhorses evolving into comfortable, family-friendly rides equipped with the latest gadgets (pictured: the Toyota Hilux entertainment screen) </p>

<p>ISUZU D-MAX X-TERRAIN</p>

<p>The new D-Max has seen a huge leap forward in design with the impressive looking four-seater featuring leather, a nine-inch touchscreen, and smart key entry. </p>

<p>Along with these the $58,990 model, one of the cheapest among the competitors, also has wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. </p>

<p>Servicing is also great value at under $2,000 for five years and an extra year of warranty is also included in the purchase price taking the coverage to six years or 150,000km. </p>

<p>The $58,990 D-Max model, one of the cheapest among the competitors, also has wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (pictured) </p>

<p>Safety features include blind-spot warning, active cruise control, auto-braking, rear cross traffic alert and a centre front airbag - a roller cover also comes standard to keep the tray contents secure. </p>

<p>These features combined with the powerful 3.0 litre turbo diesel engine under the hood should see the new Isuzu giving the established players in the market a run for their money. </p>

<p>Down sides include the six-speed auto transmission, which has been known to jolt when switching from sixth to fifth, suspension which can feel a little unstable at lower city speeds, and less than snappy steering. </p>

<p>TOYOTA HILUX SR5</p>

<p>The Hilux is the top-selling ute in the country - a favourite for tradies focused on getting the job done, but the new model features some welcome luxuries. </p>

<p>The four-seater also has the Apple and Android connectivity but leather seats with electric adjustment will cost an extra as part of a $2,500 add-on pack. </p>

<p>Cost is around the $65,000 mark for the auto SR5 with servicing costing an $500 a year for the first three years and increasing after that. </p>

<p>While the SR5 has emergency braking, speed sign recognition, and active cruise control, it lacks rear cross traffic and blind spot alert. </p>

<p>The cabin is functional if unimpressive while the engine has been boosted to 150kW of power and 500Nm of torque. </p>

<p>The is also some road noise that leaks into the cabin, however, a major plus is the resale value with the model popular for second hand purchasers. </p>

<p>FORD RANGER XLT</p>

<p>The Ranger has been around the longest but consistently sells in high volumes with the new model featuring some futuristic touches. </p>

<p>FordPass allows the driver to use an app to unlock the car and start the engine while active noise-cancelling which emits frequencies through the speakers that minimise cabin noise. </p>

<p>The four-seater also has the best steering of the bunch, a powerful 3.2 litre engine that can be upgraded to a twin-turbo, and includes a 10-speed auto transmission that glides smoothly between gears. </p>

<p>There is no electric seat adjustment, leather trim or active cruise control but it does features stop-start functionality to save on petrol. </p>

<p>The price is around the $65,700 mark with upgraded 18-inch wheels and the 2.0 twin-turbo engine. </p>

<p>RAM 1500 EXPRESS</p>

<p>American based RAM is a new player in Australia, and while not edging out other best-sellers like the Mitsubishi Triton, it has found a niche with sales in Australia steadily rising. </p>

<p>The ute is bigger than the other 4x4s - owing to it's American muscle heritage - with a price tag to match at around $89,000. </p>

<p>The 2020 Express model features a Hemi V8 engine and a superior 4.5 tonne tow rating compared with others in the market. </p>

<p>Other features include 20-inch alloy wheels and an eight-speed torque converter automatic transmission for snappy driving despite it's hulking frame. </p>

<p>Gadgets include keyless entry, dual-zone climate control, Apple and Andriod connectivity, USB ports , and a six-speaker entertainment system. </p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages is the spacious four-seater cabin and huge tray suitable for tradies and recreational activities such as trailbiking or jetskiing. </p>

<p>The engine, the crown-jewel of the 1500, features cylinder deactivation which shuts off four of the eight cylinders when not in use to save petrol. </p>

<p>City driving is suprisingly smooth with the V8 barely ticking over while out on the open highway it grows to a deep roar with the accelerator down. </p>

<p>Safety features include active cruise control, front and side curtain airbags, traction control, hill-start assist, and rear parking sensors. </p>
