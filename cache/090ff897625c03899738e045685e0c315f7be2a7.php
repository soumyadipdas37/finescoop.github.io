<p>Kanye had previously spent some time in nearby Jamaica before flying over to Haiti.</p>

<p>The rapper landed at Hugo Chávez International Airport in Cap-Haïtien in the country's northern area, where he ran into tennis star Naomi Osaka, the Miami Herald reported.</p>

<p>He was met there by President Jovenel Moise, who gave him a tour of the island.</p>

<p>He tried to capture the action on his phone, before getting up to join the dancers. </p>

<p>Kanye was dressed casually for the get-together in a white graphic shirt and black track pants with thick beige stripes running down the legs.</p>

<p>Another video showed him freestyling a rap while surrounded by a crowd.</p>

<p>He appeared to have joined a group of drummers and flautists, though his bars couldn't be understood in the short clip.</p>

<p>He had his phone in front of him, possibly to read off existing lyrics. </p>

<p>In the spirit: Kanye West, 43, was seen dancing with locals and rapping with a drum line after making a surprise visit to Haiti on Friday</p>

<p>The Monster rapper didn't mention his reasons for visiting Haiti, but he did share twitter posts on Saturday indicating he was interested in the country because of its history of overthrowing French colonialists. </p>

<p>'Haiti is where our people started the first revolution that freed us from slavery,' he wrote in one tweet that included a paint of Haitians battling the French.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, he posted another tweet with a photo of his own showing a crowd of people gawking at him.</p>

<p>'WE ARE HERE TO COMPLETE THE REVOLUTION,' he wrote. 'WE ARE ARE BUILDING THE FUTURE.'</p>

<p>He was also expected to stop by the port of Labadee and Tortuga Island. </p>

<p>Kanye was only accompanied by his entourage on the trip.</p>

<p>Last week, sources told Us Weekly that Kim was 'deeply disappointed and sad' because of her husband's ongoing mental health issues.</p>

<p>'Being isolated and alone essentially in his head isn’t healthy for Kanye,' an insider said.</p>

<p>Letting loose: He tried to capture the action on his phone, before getting up to join the dancers</p>

<p>His turn: Another video showed him freestyling a rap while surrounded by a crowd. He seemed to have joined a group of drummers and flutes, though his bars couldn't be understood in the clip</p>

<p>They confirmed that the producer hadn't been adhering to the care plane that he and Kim agreed on, though she 'isn't surprised' by that development and partly blames it on the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>Although she was able to overlook his erratic tweets, it was 'the mood swings and the manic episodes [that] are extremely difficult for Kim to help Kanye cope with.'</p>

<p>Kanye had previously been staying isolated at his Wyoming ranch, and after taking a family vacation he's gone back to traveling on his own. </p>

<p>The couple share four children: North, seven, Saint, four, Chicago, two, and Psalm, 16 months.</p>
