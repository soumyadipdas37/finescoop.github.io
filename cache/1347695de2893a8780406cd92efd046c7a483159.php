<p>The 36-year-old has become Watford’s second summer addition following the free transfer capture of right back Jeremy Ngakia after he left West Ham.</p>

<p>Murray was a key figure in Brighton’s first two Premier League campaigns and their top scorer in both, hitting 12 and 13 goals and being the only Seagulls player to hit double figures.</p>

<p>Neal Maupay’s arrival at the Amex from Brentford last summer, though, saw Murray’s game time limited last season.</p>

<p>However, Murray is a proven performer at Championship level having netted 67 times in 143 games in the second tier for Crystal Palace, Reading and Brighton.</p>

<p>Murray’s move comes amid interest in Troy Deeney from West Brom while Tottenham are also keeping tabs on Watford’s talisman.</p>
