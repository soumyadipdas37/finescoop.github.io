<p>Night out: Michael Caine enjoyed a romantic meal out with his glamorous wife Shakira at The Ivy Chelsea Garden in London on Thursday night</p>

<p>Michael opted for a light blue unbuttoned shirt with dark trousers and a matching zip-up jacket for the meal.</p>

<p>While Shakira looked radiant as she opted for an oversized blue cotton shirt with black trousers and a navy patterned jacket. </p>

<p>Adding some finishing touches, the former actress opted for a sparkly clutch bag, heels and gold pendant earrings.</p>

<p>Shakira styled her brunette locks back into a chic hairdo and added a slick of make-up which enhanced her age-defying features. </p>

<p>Sweet: The Italian Job star, 87, cut a smart figure as he walked hand-in-hand with his former model spouse, 73, outside the upmarket eatery </p>

<p>The couple appeared in good spirits with Michael using a walking stick as they made their way home after enjoying a romantic meal out where they were stopped by a fan.</p>

<p>Former British Army solider Caine has been walking with the aid of a stick since a nasty fall on a patch of ice in 2018, leaving him with an ankle injury.</p>

<p>'Michael slipped and broke his ankle in his garden during the recent heavy snow,' his spokesperson told The Mirror at the time. 'He is in fine health and great spirits.'</p>

<p>Last year, the veteran British actor revealed how he met the love of his life after seeing her star in a coffee commercial.</p>

<p>Fans! The couple appeared in good spirits with Michael using a walking stick as they made their way home after enjoying a romantic meal out where they were stopped by a fan </p>

<p>'I was at home and this commercial came on, for Maxwell House coffee. And there was this beautiful Brazilian girl,' he told Andrew Denton's Interview.</p>

<p>'I said to my mate, "We're going to Brazil tomorrow - I have plenty of money, we're going to find her".'</p>

<p>Much to the actor's surprise, though, was the fact his dream woman was not on the other side of the world but instead a stone's throw away from where he was living.</p>

<p>'I got all excited and said let's go down to the tavern to have a drink and this other guy comes in. He said, "We made that commercial - she's not in Brazil, she's on the Fulham Road" which is about a mile away from me.'</p>

<p>Michael called his future bride 11 times before she agreed to go out with him.</p>

<p>Michael married Shakira in 1973 and they have one daughter together, Natasha, 47. He has another daughter Nikki, 63, from his previous marriage with actress Patricia Haines.  </p>
