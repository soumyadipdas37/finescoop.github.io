<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Juventus could turn back the clock as Andrea Pirlo is reportedly interested in bringing Alvaro Morata back to the club.</p>

<p>The new Juventus boss is very keen on signing a striker during the summer transfer window and has been heavily linked with Barcelona star Luis Suarez. </p>

<p>Mundo Deportivo are reporting that should Juventus fail in their pursuit of the Uruguayan however, they could turn their focus back to Morata.</p>

<p>Juventus are interested in signing striker Alvaro Morata should they fail to sign Luis Suarez </p>

<p>New Juventus coach Andrea Pirlo is very keen on signing a new striker during the summer</p>

<p>A move for Morata would reunite Morata and Pirlo who played together in the 2014-15 season</p>

<p>Morata had a highly successful two-year spell at the Bianconeri after he joined from Real Madrid for £15.8m in 2014.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old has good memories from his time at the club, where he scored 27 goals in 93 appearances.</p>

<p>He helped Juventus to two Serie A titles and helped them to the Champions League final, where they fell to a 3-1 defeat to Barcelona in 2015. </p>

<p>A move for Morata is not expected to be as simple or cheap than it would to sign Suarez</p>

<p>Should Juventus sign Morata, it would mean that Pirlo would reunite with the Spaniard who was part of the team during the Italian's final year as a player at the club. </p>

<p>Morata's contract at Atletico Madrid runs until 2023, so a move for the striker is not expected to be as simple or cheap in comparison to Suarez.</p>

<p>Since leaving Juventus, Morata has had a second stint at Real Madrid as well as  a two-year spell at Chelsea.</p>

<p>At Atletico, the Spaniard has scored 22 goals in 61 appearances for the club.</p>
