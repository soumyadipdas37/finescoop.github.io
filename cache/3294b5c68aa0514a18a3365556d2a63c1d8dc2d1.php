<p>'So North conned me in to go to this pet store, that was right near her school and she wants to see the tarantulas,' Kim tells Khloe.</p>

<p>'I go up to the lady and say listen, I'll pay you a $100 bucks just say they are mean to kids, not good pets, they bite everyone, say whatever you got to say, I'll pay you,' the mother of four explained.</p>

<p>'The woman is like, "They make great pets, do you want to hold it?" Pulling it out, showing her. I'm literally like,' as she makes an exacerbated facial expression.</p>

<p>Phobia: A flashback of a Kardashian holiday caught on KUWTK plays, where her mom Kris Jenner tells her there is a spider on her</p>

<p>In the clip, Kris told her to stop and tried to help her get the spider off as well as calm Kim down, who was hysterical at this point. </p>

<p>Back to the present day camera interview, Kim says: 'But North has brought up several times now that she wants a pet spider. And that is absolutely never going to happen. Like never, ever, ever, as long as she is living under my roof. Never going to happen.'</p>

<p>Khloe then suggested to Kim to 'just get over this fear of yours,' before Kim mentioned 'Just like whales for you.'</p>

<p>Khloe is terrified of whales, which is was also documented on the show after she couldn't get herself to go in the ocean because she was terrified. </p>

<p>No to pet spiders: Back to the present day camera interview, Kim says: 'But North has brought up several times now that she wants a pet spider. And that is absolutely never going to happen. Like never, ever, ever, as long as she is living under my roof. Never going to happen'</p>

<p>Khloe says: 'Oh stop it! Who the f<strong>k would even approach a big a</strong> whale. That's like sick,' as Kim says: 'That's like the same thing with tarantulas.'</p>

<p>Khloe noted that North 'knows that's your biggest fear like on the planet,' which left Kim speechless.</p>

<p>Directly talking to the camera, Khloe says: 'North has always had an obsession with spiders. We don't know why. It's so ironic because Kimberly is so afraid of them. North touches spiders, North catches spiders and I think she just wants to share her love of spiders with her mom. So I want to be supportive of North and plan something to help Kim conquer her fear of spiders.'</p>

North touches spiders, North catches spiders and I think she just wants to share her love of spiders with her mom. So I want to be supportive of North and plan something to help Kim conquer her fear of spiders'</p>

<p>Khloe then asked Kim what she plans on doing, to which Kim said: 'Maybe I'll be sitting there and looking at my phone and I'll be like "Oh My God did you hear the news? All these kids died from tarantula bites!"'</p>

<p>Adding: 'I'm just going to scare the s**t out of them' as Khloe says: 'That's not good.'</p>

<p>KUWTK season 19's next episode airs on Thursday on E!. </p>
