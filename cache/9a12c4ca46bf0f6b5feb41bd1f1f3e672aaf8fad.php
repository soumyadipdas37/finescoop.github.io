<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A world-renowned female powerlifer has received an apology from a Russian airline after they refused to let her board a flight without proving she was a woman.   </p>

<p>Anna Turaeva, 42, has told of the 'horror' she faced when she was subjected to intimate questions in front of other passengers on a scheduled flight.</p>

<p>The sportswoman has a string of records and medals representing her country.</p>

<p>She said she was initially barred from flying with Russian airline Utair from St Petersburg to her home city Krasnodar via Moscow, because the security staff believed her to be a man.</p>

<p>Anna Turaeva, 42, pictured with her dog, has spoken of her horror after she was stopped from boarding a plane until she could prove that she was a woman to security officials</p>

<p>'At the checkpoint they refused to let me pass through saying that it was written in my passport that I am a woman,' she posted.</p>

<p>'It was humiliating. 'I was reprimanded like a child in front of people in the queue.</p>

<p>'[I was asked] intimate questions. [They were] interested in who I am in my life - and in bed,' she recalled.</p>

<p>Anna told how she kept her cool and 'did not allow myself the slightest rudeness'.</p>

<p>She said: 'The whole queue was watching this anarchy, and I felt as helpless as possible in this situation.</p>

<p>'I was trying to prove that I am indeed a woman.'</p>

<p>The sportswoman has a string of records and medals representing her country, and is one of Russia's most famous powerlifters</p>

<p>Speaking since the incident, Anna has said that she is comfortable in her lifestyle, and doesn't feel like she needs to prove anything to anyone. 'I really love shops, hairdressing salons, manicure, and cosmetic procedures,' she said</p>

<p>Anna - who came out as lesbian years ago - said she quietly tried to explain to the airline representative that they were wrong to ask her to prove she was a woman.</p>

<p>'I did everything that depends on me for them to believe in my nature,' she said, not explaining how the matter was finally resolved.</p>

<p>'Then a miracle happened, I was allowed to board the plane.'</p>

<p>But she later hit out at the airline telling them: 'I have worked all my youth - with my blood and sweat for my country, not to be treated this way.'</p>

<p>Utair rapidly said they were sorry, telling her: 'We apologise for the negative emotions you experienced. Such service is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Anna - now a powerlifting coach - was an absolute six times world champion in bench press, and holds multiple trophies for powerlifting</p>

<p>Anna was initially barred from flying with Russian airline Utair (pictured, filed photo) from St Petersburg to her home city Krasnodar via Moscow, because the security staff believed her to be a man. They asked her questions when they saw that her passport said she was a woman</p>

<p>'We will definitely check the actions of the airport employees who worked on your flight, and we will sort out the situation.'</p>

<p>Anna - now a powerlifting coach - was an absolute six times world champion in bench press, and holds multiple trophies for powerlifting.</p>

<p>Amazingly, she was a 'sickly child' and was exempted from PE lessons until the age of 15.</p>

<p>'My father was a turner, he worked at a machine plant. He made iron - dumbbells, barbells and everything else - for my friends and me,' she said.</p>

<p>Anna (right) - who came out as lesbian years ago - said she quietly tried to explain to the airline representative that they were wrong to ask her to prove she was a woman. She has said that surprisingly, she was a sickly child, but worked hard to get to where she is today</p>

<p>Anna has since hit out at the airline for not allowing her to board. The airline quickly apologised over the incident, telling her: 'We apologise for the negative emotions you experienced. Such service is unacceptable'</p>

<p>'My mum always supported me, even when I didn't look like all the other girls.</p>

<p>'It was a miracle for her that I stayed alive at all, as from the age of six to 15 I saw nothing but hospitals.</p>

<p>'She was always in favour of me living, moving forward, setting some goals.'</p>

<p>She has said: 'I see myself this way and I am not going to change and look different.</p>

<p>'I really love shops, hairdressing salons, manicure, and cosmetic procedures.'</p>

<p>She has said: 'I see myself that way. I'm not going to prove anything to anyone. It's just my style, my lifestyle… I am so comfortable.'</p>

<p>Anna has said that her father was a turner and made iron dumbbells for her and her friends when she was younger, while her mother has 'always supported me, even when I don't look like all the other girls'</p>
