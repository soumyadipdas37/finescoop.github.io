<p>Cynthia admitted she feels 'horrible' that she wasn't able to support her daughter, and blames generational differences for her lack of communication at the time.</p>

<p>She explained: 'There was a shame of sharing some of this with me. And I feel horrible about that.</p>

<p>'I was raised differently, where you just have to be tough and not talk about your emotions. I didn't always understand the difference between normal biological teenage development and a real problem.'</p>

<p>Gaga hopes that the book can encourage 'resilience' in younger people suffering mental health problems and help develop an understanding, just as she has with her mother.</p>
