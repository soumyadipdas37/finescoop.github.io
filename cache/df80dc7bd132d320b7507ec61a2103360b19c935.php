<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Viewers tuned into last night's SoccerAid commented on the 'irony of John Terry taking a knee,' as the former Chelsea star joined teammates in a show of solidarity for the Black Lives Matter movement - despite being fined for racism in the past. </p>

<p>England captain Olly Murs and the rest of the Soccer Aid players took the knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement during the annual charity game at Old Trafford in Manchester on Sunday. </p>

<p>But it was the former Chelsea and England captain, John Terry, who caught the eye of viewers, as one commented 'the irony of John Terry taking a knee'.</p>

<p>In 2012, Terry, now a coach at Aston Villa, was fined £220,000 and banned for four games after calling Anton Ferdinand a 'f****** black c***,' during a match against Queen's Park Rangers in 2011.</p>

<p>A trial at Westminster Magistrates Court cleared Terry of racially abusing the defender.</p>

<p>American footballer Colin Kaepernick's national anthem kneeling protest staged in 2016 has since become synonymous with the movement.</p>

<p>Premier League teams took the knee before games after the season restarted following the coronavirus shutdown and had Black Lives Matters on team shirts. </p>

<p>The England team also took the knee before Nations League games against Iceland and Denmark and the teams took the knee before last month's Community Shield.</p>

<p>It is unclear what is going to happen this season. Premier League clubs are due to discuss Black Lives Matter tributes at their next shareholders meeting later this month.</p>

<p>Sky Sports pundit Alex Scott has urged English football to press on with support for the campaign..</p>

<p>The former Arsenal women's star said clubs, players and staff should continue their displays against discrimination. </p>

<p>'Basketball players in the play-offs are boycotting games. We just need to keep going. We need to keep it at the forefront of people's conversation. So any opportunity we can, we need to shine a light on it.'  </p>

<p>Viewers took to Twitter to claim it was 'ironic' that Chelsea icon John Terry had also took the knee, nearly eight years after accepting a four game ban and £220,000 fine from the FA for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The sportsman was found not guilty of the racially aggravated public order offence in July 2012, nine months after the incident during Chelsea's defeat against QPR at Loftus Road. </p>

<p>Awkward: Viewers took to Twitter to claim it was 'ironic' that Chelsea icon John had also took the knee due to his past, while others disagreed</p>

<p>Social media users wrote: 'I enjoyed watching John Terry, a player banned for 4 games and fined over £200k for racist remarks during a match, take the knee for BLM #SoccerAid.</p>

<p>'John Terry taking a knee “in support” of black lives matter [confused emoji]. </p>

<p>'I missed the kick off. Twitter says John Terry took the knee - after what he said to Anton Ferdinand? Say it ain’t so? #SoccerAid.' </p>

<p>Others disagreed: 'People banging on about John Terry taking the knee for BLM....if he didn’t do it people would be making comments, guy can’t win can he?'</p>

<p>'Keep seeing posts about John Terry taking the knee as being hypocritical. That's the same John Terry who was found 'Not Guilty' in a court of law. That's also the same John Terry who has friends and former teammates who are of different ethnic backgrounds. Give it a rest!'  </p>

<p>Controversy: Others slammed viewers who stopped watching the event and donating towards the cause when they realised female footballers were playing and stars took the knee</p>

<p>'As I stated in the criminal case, with the benefit of hindsight my language was clearly not an appropriate reaction to the situation for someone in my position.</p>

<p>'My response was below the level expected by Chelsea Football Club, and by me, and it will not happen again. Looking forward, I will continue to do my part in assisting the club to remove all types of discriminatory behaviour from football.</p>

<p>'I am extremely grateful for the consistent support of Chelsea FC, the fans and my family.' </p>
