<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Josie Bates shared the sad news on Wednesday that she had suffered a miscarriage.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old Bringing Up Bates star posted a somber photo of her and her husband Kelton Balka embracing while opening up about the loss.</p>

<p>The couple previously welcomed their 13-month-old daughter Willow in July 2019. </p>

<p>Sometimes you have to walk through experiences you never thought you would have to. This has been a very difficult time for our little family. Kelton and I were over the moon excited to be expecting a sweet baby in March, 2021! We were filled with anticipation as we began to dream of what it would be like as a family of four and for Willow to have a little playmate. We surprised our family and friends with the news at Willow¿s one year old birthday party! Already, my heart felt an unexplainable amount of excitement! Sadly, when I went for a recent ultrasound, we were heartbroken to hear our precious baby had gone to be with Jesus. Our hearts have been completely broken. I¿ve never experienced the type of pain and loss that I¿ve had these past weeks. There is an empty spot in our hearts and in our home. Even though we never got to see our baby face to face or hold its tiny hand, we know God has a purpose for its short life. In spite of our grieving, we have peace in knowing that our little baby is in heaven with Kelton¿s sweet mom. I added a charm to my necklace, next to Willow¿s, to help us never forget the memories of how this little one made us feel and how much love and joy it brought to our family. We are grateful for the love and prayers from so many during this time.</p>
