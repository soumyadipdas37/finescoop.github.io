<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Crystal Palace welcome Southampton to Selhurst Park in this afternoon's Premier League action as Danny Ings looks for another outstanding season for visitors.</p>

<p>The Saints forward will be the clear dangerman after scoring 22 league goals last season and should be a handful for Roy Hodgson's side, who are hoping to push the reset button after a terrible end to the 2019-20 campaign. </p>

<p>Palace lost seven games in a row during the restart before stopping the rot by drawing 1-1 with Tottenham in the finale, and the veteran manager will be confident that the only way is up as they start on zero points.   </p>

<p>Sportsmail's KIERAN JACKSON will provide live coverage of Palace vs Southampton including live score, lineups and build-up. </p>
