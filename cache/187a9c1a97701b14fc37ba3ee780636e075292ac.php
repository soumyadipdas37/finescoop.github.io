<p>Up to 10,000 UK jobs could be lost if the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk does not go ahead, businesses and trade unions have warned.</p>

<p>As many as a third of workers would be laid off at some firms in the nuclear industry supply chain, mostly in high-skilled construction and engineering roles, according to the Sizewell C Consortium.</p>

<p>Days ago Japanese group Hitachi pulled out of the Wylfa nuclear power plant on Anglesey, dealing another blow to the UK’s nuclear plans.</p>

<p>Sizewell C needs Government approval. </p>

<p>This is tricky because although it is being led by France’s EDF, Chinese state-backed nuclear group CGN owns a minority stake. </p>

<p>Tensions between London and Beijing have flared since the Government’s decision to exclude Huawei’s equipment from 5G networks.</p>
