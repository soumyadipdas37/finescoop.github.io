<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has urged his old club to sign Harry Kane.</p>

<p>Meulensteen, who was first-team coach at United between 2007 and 2013, feels that bringing in the Tottenham striker would help Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side to compete for the title.  </p>

<p>'What is vitally important is that United need to have a really good start to the season, so they don't lose any ground and they are in there and they can keep competing. That will grow the belief,' Meulensteen, who is currently Australia's assistant coach, told talkSPORT. </p>

<p>Ex-Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen wants his old club to sign Harry Kane</p>

<p>Meulensteen was first-team coach at United under Sir Alex Ferguson between 2007 and 2013</p>

<p>'I think with maybe another good signing, I keep saying they should bring in a really top, top striker. For instance, if they were able to get Kane – which I don't think they can – but if they could get Kane, I would say 'yes, they will compete for the title next year.'</p>

<p>United have already made one major signing, bringing in midfielder Donny Van de Beek from Ajax for £40million.</p>

<p>Meulensteen believes that if United brought in Kane then they could challenge for the title</p>

<p>Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho has also been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford as Solskjaer looks to strengthen his squad further.</p>

<p>Prising Kane away from Tottenham would certainly be difficult, with the forward's current contract running until the summer of 2024.</p>

<p>Kane scored 24 goals in 34 games for Tottenham last season and would certainly bolster United's chances of winning silverware if he was to join.</p>

<p>Solskjaer can already call upon the likes of Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood as attacking options, but Kane would provide them with an extra dimension. </p>
