<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sevilla's transfer chief Monchi is puzzled why a club like Manchester United don't have a sporting director as they continue to falter in the summer transfer window.</p>

<p>The Red Devils have endured an extremely frustrating summer so far, only signing Donny van de Beek for £40million from Ajax as they continue to stumble in their pursuit of Jadon Sancho - who Borussia Dortmund value at £108million.</p>

<p>United have come under heavy scrutiny for their lack of transfer activity, and are now desperately looking to bring in some new faces despite their priority target still being Sancho, having been linked with the likes of Edinson Cavani, Luka Jovic, Ousmane Dembele and Alex Telles.</p>

<p>Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is in charge of the club's transfers</p>

<p>United continue to stumble in their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>And the well-renowned Monchi cannot understand why United and other European clubs haven't appointed a sporting director - with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward still in charge of the Premier League side's transfer operations.</p>

<p>'This is my opinion - all clubs should have this position,' he told The Telegraph.</p>

<p>'What is the main function? To dedicate the time to everything that relates on a sports level. Where 60-70 per cent of the budget is allocated to the first team, if you don't have a specialist who deals with that, it is very difficult to understand.</p>

<p>'I do understand there are very successful clubs – Manchester United are probably one of the top five in the world, but they do not have that specific position – but I think that clubs more and more are aware that they really need this position and also we are the connection between the technical staff, the squad, the board, we know the ­market, we get lots of information through the different scouts.</p>

<p>Monchi admits he doesn't understand why United have not appointed a sporting director</p>

<p>'So, for me, I can't believe a club does not have this particular position. Logically, I have to believe in it because that's what I do. But I do think it's essential.'</p>

<p>In previous years, United have in fact looked at appointing a sporting director, with the likes of Monchi himself, Edwin van der Sar, Erik Stoffelshaus and Paul Mitchell having previously been linked with a move to Old Trafford.</p>

<p>However, nothing has come to fruition and Woodward continues to be the man tasked with looking to bring in fresh faces.</p>

<p>But their transfer activity has flattered to deceive in recent seasons, and once again this summer, while the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea have all strengthened considerably.  </p>

<p>The Red Devils have only signed Donny van de Beek so far in a £40million deal from Ajax</p>
