<p>Public Health England is asking the food industry to cut the calorie content of a large range of products by 2024.</p>

<p>Officials believe the rise in popularity of takeaways, deliveries and food on-the-go is one of the driving factors behind the nation's obesity crisis.</p>

<p>Portion sizes for fish and chips, pizzas and other takeaways could shrink by up to a fifth under fresh proposals to battle obesity</p>

<p>They want the fat, sugar and salt levels slashed in many fast foods, ready meals, crisps and sandwiches.</p>

<p>Ready meals could be capped at 570 calories and sandwiches at 580 calories. </p>

<p>Some bacon and egg sandwiches contain over 750 calories while a Big Mac meal of burger, fries and soft drink contains more than 1,000 calories. </p>

<p>Health bosses have suggested a 10 per cent calorie reduction in children's 'food bundles', ready meals, chips and garlic bread, and a 20 per cent calorie reduction in pizzas and pastry products.</p>

<p>But they stressed that portion sizes should not be reduced so far that it encourages people to buy two products instead of one. </p>

<p>Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist for PHE, said the guidelines aimed to help consumers make healthier choices. </p>

<p>She said: 'Eating food and drink that's higher in calories than people realise is one of the reasons why many of us are either overweight or obese.'</p>

<p>But Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, accused the Government of 'beginning to sound like a scratchy record'. </p>

<p>Public Health England is asking the food industry to cut the calorie content of a large range of products by 2024</p>

<p>He said 'bold action' to enforce calorie limits was vital, warning that voluntary reduction programmes had failed in the past.</p>

<p>John Maingay, of the British Heart Foundation, said the guidelines 'should be an absolute minimum'.</p>

<p>'The Government must also start to consider tougher action, such as fines or sanctions, if the food industry does not make the changes that are needed,' he said.</p>
