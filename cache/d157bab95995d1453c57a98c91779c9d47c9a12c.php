<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham outcast Danny Rose was reportedly not told that he would lose his squad number this summer.</p>

<p>This has all-but confirmed the end of Rose's career at Spurs after Jose Mourinho's side announced their squad numbers for the new campaign on Friday and did not include the England international. </p>

<p>Rose, who only has a year left on his current contract, was told that he is not part of Mourinho's plans for the 2020-21 season when he returned from his loan spell from Newcastle according to The Athletic.</p>

<p>Tottenham outcast Danny Rose was reportedly not told that he would lose his squad number</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho's side announced their squad numbers for the new campaign on Friday</p>

<p>But incredibly, the 30-year-old is thought to have known nothing about losing the No 3 shirt </p>

<p>But incredibly, the 30-year-old is thought to have known nothing about losing the No 3 shirt until receiving a phone call from somebody to say they had seen the news on television.</p>

<p>Rose has been training with Tottenham's under-23s players and has been advised to move to Serie A side Genoa by Mourinho.   </p>

<p>The Spurs boss said on Friday before their 1-0 home defeat to Everton: 'If Genoa gets Danny Rose, I think they get a good player.</p>

<p>'If they get a good player in the last year of his contract, I think they're in a privilege position to do a good deal for them. And if Danny Rose goes there, I wish him all the best.</p>

<p>Rose requested a meeting with Mourinho in Tottenham's Amazon 'All or Nothing' documentary</p>

<p>The outspoken star tells the Portuguese boss he is far from happy with his lack of playing time </p>

<p>'It's one of the things that was very clear you that you could learn from one of the Amazon bits is that Danny is the kind of guy who wants to play all the time.'</p>

<p>Amazon's crew filmed a heated row between Tottenham left back Rose and their manager Mourinho last season after he was dropped from the team, with the defender storming out of his office.  </p>

<p>Rose struggled for game time under the Portuguese boss following his arrival in November – starting just one Premier League game in a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool in January – and ended up joining Newcastle on loan shortly after. </p>

<p>The outspoken star has failed to nail down a regular spot in the first team in recent years and threatened to wind down the last 18 months of his contract and leave for nothing after Daniel Levy's failed attempts to sell him last summer. After Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino, he had hoped to turn over a new leaf. </p>

<p>Amazon's crew filmed the row inside Mourinho's office in episode five of the documentary </p>

<p>But the England international – who is one of the longest-serving players at the club having joined in 2007 – continued to be frustrated. Mourinho quickly took a liking to Spurs youngster Japhet Tanganga, who emerged as the first choice left back after an impressive run of form. </p>

<p>Rose had been picked to start in one of the biggest games of the season against the Reds, but left Mourinho unimpressed with his performance and was hauled off after 69 minutes. </p>

<p>In episode five of Tottenham's 'All or Nothing' documentary, Rose asked to speak with the head coach after being left out of the next handful of games and demanded to know what the 'problem' was. </p>

<p>Rose threatened to stay at home if he didn't get more minutes on the pitch, saying: 'Gaffer, I just want to know exactly what the problem is. </p>

<p>The left back eventually joined Newcastle United on loan in pursuit of more opportunities </p>

<p>When Mourinho asked what he means, the defender replied: 'You know exactly what I mean, how I'm being treated. I was very excited when you came as manager, but if you don't want me to play, I'd rather you just tell me now, and I'll stay at home, and I'll train at home.'</p>

<p>Mourinho explained to Rose that he picked him for the Liverpool game after impressing him in training but was left disappointed with his display – admitting Tanganga's consistency left him with no choice but to keep starting him. </p>

<p>'Let me try to be as open as I can with you, because I think you deserve that. When I arrived, you played some matches, you were on the bench some matches, I didn't select you in other matches.</p>

<p>'The week before Liverpool you were fantastic in training and that made me decide that in the most difficult game against the most difficult opponent, you play. </p>

<p>He stormed out of Mourinho's office and said it was 'unfair' to be left out of the team  </p>

<p>'I think you didn't play well. The next game against Middlesbrough Tanganga played so well, and is so strong defensively, and doesn't make any kind of mistakes because he's so fast and so powerful. I cannot say, you're going to be first choice, you're going to play every match. It depends on you.'</p>

<p>The 30-year-old admitted he wasn't good enough against Liverpool but insists he hadn't been given a run of games to improve and carve out some consistency. He then launches a stinging attack on his Spurs team-mates and claims they have been picked despite playing 's***'. </p>

<p>'Do you want me to be man of the match and give my best performance when I play one game and then I don't play again for three or four weeks?' he adds.</p>

<p>'I wasn't good against Liverpool, it wasn't my best game, but other people have been s*** in training, s*** in games, but are in the squad every game. It's not fair.'</p>

<p>When Mourinho replies 'it's your perspective', a furious Rose starts walking out of the room and demands to speak to Levy. </p>

<p>'It's facts. The whole changing room know it's facts. And I'm going to see Daniel as well, so when Daniel's in tell him I'm looking for him.'</p>

<p>As Rose leaves the office, Mourinho tells him: 'I think you are an honest guy', with the player responding: 'Yeah, well that's the problem.'</p>

<p>The Liverpool game now looks to be Rose's last appearance for the north London side. He started 12 times for Newcastle in all competitions as he helped the Magpies to a 13th-placed finish last season.</p>

<p>But the heated exchange in the documentary was not the first time Rose has butted heads with the club. In 2017 he claimed he was not being paid enough and criticised the club for not showing enough ambition and 'signing players you have to Google'. </p>

<p>Rose has never been afraid to speak his mind and has clashed with the club in the past </p>
