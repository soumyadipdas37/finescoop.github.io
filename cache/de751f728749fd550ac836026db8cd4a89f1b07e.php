<p>Amazon's top-rated Lumi Stick-On Night Lights are one kind of lights that can be placed anywhere in the house </p>

<p>With over 7,000 reviews and a near-perfect star rating, customers have been raving about the versatile night lights, impressed by their sleek design and the soft and glare-free lighting they produce.</p>

<p>Shoppers love them so much; they've crowned them the 'perfect night lights' and 'great for children and anyone at night as they light stairs, landings without having to switch on lights'.</p>

<p>'I bought this to go in my toilet as I use the bathroom in the night and don't want to wake others with the toilet light,' said one reviewer. 'Motion detection is really good and doesn't light up in the day time.</p>

<p>'I've had it since May (now September) and don't know how I've gone this long without it!! Batteries are still going strong too. It doesn't look ugly or bulky either, really nice product thank you.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'Used these on our landing as we have no plug sockets to plug in a night light. Very impressed with the brightness, sensor sensitivity and how well they stick on to a surface.</p>

<p>When ambient light becomes low, Lumi automatically emits light when motion is detected and turns off after 15 seconds</p>

<p>'Perfect to see where you're going if getting up during the night without being so bright that they wake the rest of the house up.'</p>

<p>The night lights from Eufy which can be mounted with screws, or stuck on using the adhesive back, automatically switch on when the room becomes dark enough, detecting movement up to 10 feet away and turn off after 15 seconds.</p>

<p>The £12.29 price point makes this Amazon buy a no-brainer. However, savvy shoppers looking to save should grab it now while they're on offer.</p>
