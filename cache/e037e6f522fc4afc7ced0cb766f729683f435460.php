<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A territorial magpie left puncture wounds in a four-year-old girl's face during an attack in Western Australia.</p>

<p>Evie Markey had blood pouring down her face after being set upon by the aggressive bird on Mandurah's western foreshore, 70km south of Perth.</p>

<p>Her mother Chantal Markey was putting her baby into a pram when the bird launched at her terrified daughter.</p>

<p>She said she first realised something was wrong when she heard her nine-year-old son Zac screaming out Evie's name.</p>

<p>Evie Markey, four, (pictured) had blood pouring down her face after being set on by a magpie in Mandurah's western foreshore, 70 kilometres south of Perth</p>

<p>When she turned around the bird was dive bombing the child.</p>

<p>Ms Markey said it was fortunate her daughter's injuries were only superficial.</p>

<p>'My first thought was "thank god it didn't get her eyes", because it was so close and she was bleeding a fair bit,' she told the Mandurah Mail.</p>

<p>'I just couldn't believe how aggressive this particular magpie was - it was lashing at her with its claws.'</p>

<p>The mother-of-four has warned parents to keep an eye out for aggressive magpies.</p>

<p>She witnessed the same bird attack another four people over the course of her time in the park.</p>

<p>One of its victims was a toddler.</p>

<p>'You could see the nest hanging over the car park and it was just going backwards and forwards getting people,' she said. </p>

<p>The mother-of-four wants the Mandurah City Council to install a sign warning locals about the magpie. </p>

<p>Magpie swooping season came early this year due to the unseasonably warm weather.</p>

<p>At least 280 attacks have been reported across Australia since mid June, according to the Magpie Alert website. </p>

<p>One of the more recent incidents involved a young boy who went viral after an aggressive magpie was filmed swooping him on Shellharbour Road in Wollongong.</p>

<p>His father Wayne Sherwood filmed the incident and posted it to Instagram with the caption: 'Australia is beautiful but our native birds are killers. They'll eat your kids alive. Beware.'</p>
