<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who was made to feel insecure about her vagina by a former sexual partner has launched a one woman crusade to photograph women's private parts to prove they are beautiful. </p>

<p>Ellie Eggwick, from Queensland's Sunshine Coast, felt so bad about herself that she inquired about labiaplasty. </p>

<p>It was only after a sensible doctor told her to do some research about her procedure that she discovered she was perfectly normal. </p>

<p>The episode inspired Ms Eggwick, 30, to photograph more than 500 vaginas for a coffee table book.    </p>

<p>'Something that is said in the bedroom with someone you are being affectionate with can affect you for the rest of your life,' she told Sunshine Coast Daily.  </p>

<p>Photographer Ellie Eggwick (pictured), from Queensland's Sunshine Coast, has launched a campaign to photograph 500 women's vaginas to prove they are unique and beautiful </p>

<p>Ms Eggwick (pictured taking photos for her campaign) said she almost underwent a labiaplasty at the age of 20 because a sexual partner made her feel insecure </p>

<p>The photographer (pictured at a shoot) said a plastic surgeon helped her come to terms with the appearance of her vagina. She hopes her campaign will do the same for other women</p>

<p>'It has definitely stuck with me and is the reason why I am doing this project.' </p>

<p>Ms Eggwick said her own insecurities began when she was a teenager. </p>

<p>'As I had never seen another vulva, I had no idea,' she wrote on her website. </p>

<p>'All the thoughts and nightmares of a usual teenage girl went running wild through my brain - is my vagina weird?' Am I normal?'</p>

<p>Ms Eggwick said her insecurities eventually prompted her to consider undergoing a labiaplasty, a form of surgery that reduces the outer folds of the female labia. </p>

<p>'After years of self hate with this area of my body, I eventually went to see a plastic surgeon. I was so nervous, I couldn't even explain what I wanted.  </p>

<p>Ms Eggwick (pictured taking photographs) said she wants women to understand that all vaginas are different and avoid undergoing surgery </p>

<p>The campaign entitled Comfortable In My Skin will be turned into a coffee table book </p>

<p>'He looks up at me and asked "Ellie, have you ever seen another Vulva?" I told him "I've seen a few but they don't look like mine," she explained.</p>

<p>The doctor told Ms Eggwick that all vaginas are different and inspired her to share this message with other women. </p>

<p>'What this man did at this moment saved me from cutting off half of my labia. He educated me. He used nice words to tell me that not all girls have the barbie vagina.</p>

<p>'I now want to do the same for all the women out there contemplating going through surgery due to a lack on knowledge of that area on their own body,' she said. </p>

<p>The photographer hopes her campaign will encourage girls to accept their bodies.   </p>

<p>'I don't want young girls going through what I went through thinking I wasn't normal downstairs,' Ms Eggwick explained. </p>
