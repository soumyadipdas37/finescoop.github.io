<p>They continued: 'From its narrative flow to the interludes, from Civil Rights speeches to its panoramic mix of everything from psychedelic rock to piano jazz, Kiwanuka is not only a complete work, but also one that is borne of the courage of its creator to build his own world and invite us in. </p>

<p>Three cheers: Alex Jones and Amol Rajan clapped for the winner and said he would be a great 'role model' for lots of young musicians </p>
