<p>California has reported the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country, and Los Angeles County has been hit hardest by the virus. </p>

<p>The county has reported a staggering 249,000 COVID infections - a third of the 746,000 clocked statewide. </p>

<p>As of Wednesday morning, 6,032 LA County residents have died from the disease. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The LA County Department of Public Health memo does not disclose whether there will be monetary fines for those who breach the new rules. </p>

<p>It's likely that other counties across the United States will impose similar bans on traditional Halloween rituals given the country is still struggling to contain the coronavirus outbreak. </p>

<p>However, LA officials still say that residents will be able to enjoy the annual holiday if they act safely. </p>

<p>Halloween movie nights at drive-in cinemas and Halloween themed meals at outdoor restaurants are still allowed under Los Angeles law. </p>

<p>The experts also suggest that online parties and 'car parades that comply with public health guidance' are two COVID-safe ways to bring joy to families looking for some light relief amid the pandemic. </p>
