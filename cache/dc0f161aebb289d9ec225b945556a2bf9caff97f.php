<p>The singer, bravely shared her secret mental health battle earlier this year and revealed that she has been on antidepressants for 20 years. </p>

<p>Talking in this week's Closer magazine, Suzanne admitted that she wants another baby with her fiancé Sam Greenfield but worries for her mental health. She shares son Corey with actor ex Darren Day. </p>

<p>She said: 'Paranoia was a big factor of my last bout of postnatal depression. It was extreme. I hated myself, too, and had such dark thoughts.</p>

<p>'I would like to have another baby but am really worried, as I don't want to have another horrible episode. I'm in a really good place and pregnancy does mess with hormones, I just want to get a little bit stronger, but I am thinking about it.'</p>

<p>Her family: In a new interview, the singer, 38, who found fame in Hear'Say in 2000, also revealed that she wants another baby but worries about postnatal depression (pictured with fiancé Sam Greenfield and sons Corey and Rafferty, now 15 and four, in 2017) </p>

<p>Postnatal depression is a form of the mental-health condition that affects more than one in 10 women in the UK and US within a year of giving birth. </p>

<p>Symptoms can include persistent sadness, lack of enjoyment, insomnia, struggling to bond with your baby, frightening thoughts or withdrawing from others.</p>

<p>Treatments can include self-help, such as talking to loved ones, resting when you can and making time to do things you enjoy. Therapy may also be prescribed. </p>

<p>In severe cases where other options have not helped, antidepressants may be recommended. Doctors will prescribe ones that are safe to take while breastfeeding. </p>

<p>Suzanne also revealed during the interview that she has been sober for nine months after 'self-medicating' with alcohol, which 'impacted' her family.</p>

<p>She recalled: 'I would self-medicate with alcohol after a hard day but then I would wake up the next day after a binge-drinking session and feel so low. I'd cancel weekend plans and have a duvet day. That did impact my family.'   </p>

<p>The star also shared that her depression 'impacted' her relationship with Sam as she tried to 'push him away' over the years as she has issues with trust.</p>

<p>Yet despite her battle, Suzanne sweetly revealed that they have 'stayed strong' and he 'hasn't gone anywhere'. </p>

<p>The star has credited her new vegan diet, going sober and running at helping her keep on track with her mental health and getting her through 'demons' that still pop up.   </p>

<p>Suzanne added that quitting booze has given her so much 'confidence' and it's the 'best thing I've ever done'.</p>

<p>Fame: The singer was just 18 when she found fame on Popstars The Rivals and formed the band Hear'Say with the likes of Myleene Klass and Kym Marsh (pictured in 2000)  </p>

<p>However, she admitted she struggled with being in the spotlight as it is so competitive and she struggles with rejection.   </p>

<p>Suzanne revealed that as much as she loves the entertainment industry, it is not good for her mental health and she is considering moving to the wellness sector.  </p>

<p>Postnatal depression is a form of the mental-health condition that affects more than one in 10 women in the UK and US within a year of giving birth.</p>

<p>As many men can be affected as women, research suggests.  </p>

<p>Many parents feel down, teary and anxious within the first two weeks of having a child, which is often called the 'baby blues'.</p>

<p>But if symptoms start later or last longer, they may be suffering from postnatal depression.</p>

<p>Postnatal depression is just as serious as others form of the mental-health disorder. </p>

<p>Symptoms include:</p>

<p>Sufferers should not wait for their symptoms to just go away.</p>

<p>Instead they should recognise that it is not their fault they are depressed and it does not make them a bad parent.</p>

<p>If you or your partner may be suffering, talk to your GP or health visitor.</p>

<p>Treatments can include self-help, such as talking to loved ones, resting when you can and making time to do things you enjoy. Therapy may also be prescribed. </p>

<p>In severe cases where other options have not helped, antidepressants may be recommended. Doctors will prescribe ones that are safe to take while breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Postnatal depression's cause is unclear, however, it is more common in those with a history of mental-health problems. </p>

<p>Lack of support from loved ones, a poor relationship with the partner and a life-changing event, such as bereavement, can also raise the risk. </p>
