<p>But on Wednesday, Roxy Jacenko looked unrecognisable in a new promotional photo for her online marketing classes. </p>

<p>The 40-year-old shared a photo to Instagram, flaunting a noticeably smoother visage and a plumper looking pout.</p>

<p>Is that you? Roxy Jacenko (pictured) looked almost unrecognisable in a new promotional photo for her online marketing classes</p>

<p>Alongside the image, Roxy promoted her new online course, Marketing Bootcamp, which is an 'insiders guide' to everything PR.  </p>

<p>'Eeeeekkk - my NEW course is now complete!!!' she captioned the post. </p>

<p>'The Marketing Bootcamp is the insider's guide to branding, marketing, PR and social media – Roxy style!' </p>

<p>New project: Alongside the image shared to Instagram, Roxy promoted her new online course, Marketing Bootcamp, which is an 'insiders guide' to everything PR</p>

<p>Roxy has made no secret of her cosmetic enhancements in the past, which include a nose job and breast enlargement and non-surgical procedures like Botox and filler. </p>

<p>Last year, Daily Mail Australia obtained several pictures from before her surgery overhaul.</p>

<p>The Sweaty Betty PR founder previously had dark hair and, in one snap, looks fresh-faced as she posed for a professional headshot. </p>

<p>The professional headshot dates back to the early 2000s and shows Roxy with long dark locks posing in a white singlet. </p>

<p>My, how you've changed! Roxy has made no secret of her cosmetic enhancements in the past, which include a nose job and breast enlargement and non-surgical procedures like Botox and filler</p>

<p>Back in June 2015, Roxy told Who magazine about her rhinoplasty: 'I was over the droopy end and bump on the top of my nose, so it made sense to get it tweaked.</p>

<p>'My nose is already looking one hundred times better and being able to breathe [properly] is a luxury.'</p>

<p>She also had a boob job at the age of 24 - the same year she launched her now-successful public relations business Sweaty Betty PR. </p>

<p>Roxy has also told Daily Mail Australia that she had her lips enlarged in 2017 - and still gets them done.</p>

<p>'Yes, I still have my lips done. But I've just learnt less is more!' Roxy said at the time.</p>

<p>Refreshingly honest: Roxy previously shared photos of her bandaged and bloody nose after undergoing rhinoplasty surgery in 2015</p>
