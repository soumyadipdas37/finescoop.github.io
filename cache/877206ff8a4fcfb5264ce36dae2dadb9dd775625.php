<p>Though the Pandemic Special will be the series' first ever hour-long episode, South Park has ventured beyond the confines of the typical half-hour comedy structure before.</p>

<p>In 2007, series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker aired an epic three-part episode titled Imaginationland, according to EW.</p>

<p>Although fans are beyond excited for new South Park content, Comedy Central has yet to unveil the official premiere date for season 24 of the beloved cartoon. </p>

<p>But with Stone and Parker seemingly back at work and whipping up content again amid the pandemic, season 24 is undoubtedly underway.</p>

<p>South Park, which first premiered on Comedy Central in 1997, was created by Stone and Parker following the success of a project titled The Spirit Of Christmas that became one of the internet's first-ever viral videos.</p>

<p>The show, infamously known for its vulgarity, follows four elementary-age boys, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick, and the outlandish events that take place in their hometown of South Park, Colorado.</p>
