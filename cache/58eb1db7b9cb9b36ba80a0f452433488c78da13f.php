<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She was at the centre of a doping scandal last year, after testing positive for the banned muscle-enhancing substance Ligandrol. </p>

<p>And while Australian swimmer Shayna Jack has always protested her innocence, a new preview for her appearance on Channel Seven reality series SAS Australia features an unintentional nod to the scandal.</p>

<p>As she prepares to appear on the military-based challenge show, a promotional press release from the network includes the quote: 'I do not take short cuts'.</p>

<p>'I do not take short cuts': A promo trailer for Shayna Jack's (pictured) appearance on SAS: Australia has created an unintentional nod to the scandal which shook the nation in 2019</p>

<p>Despite the 21-year-old's denial, the choice of wording rings close to home for the athlete, who has denied rumours she took the drug to enhance her sporting ability.</p>

<p>She first came under fire when she tested positive to Ligandrol in both her A and B samples in Cairns in July 2019, ahead of the FINA World Championships in South Korea.</p>

<p>She has regularly protested her innocence and denied knowingly taking the drug.</p>

<p>A long road: Shayna first came under fire when she tested positive to Ligandrol in both her A and B samples in Cairns in July, 2019, ahead of the FINA World Championships in South Korea</p>

<p>'It's something that is so far-fetched from what I'd ever think would happen to me,' Shayna told The Sunday Project last year.</p>

<p>In the interview with host Lisa Wilkinson, Shayna said she was told anything she came into contact with prior to the test could have contaminated her sample.</p>

<p>'There was a case in the past called the "kiss cocaine case" where someone had taken cocaine and then the partner, who was an athlete, kissed that person and they were contaminated because they had contact with something someone else had taken,' she added.</p>

<p>More recently, Shayna discussed with Stellar earlier this month the 'draining and horrible' process she went through during the scandal last year.</p>

<p>Fighting on: Shayna confirms she still dreams of being able to swim in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, saying she will always stand up for what is right and 'maintain my values and speak the truth'</p>

<p>She said she still dreams of being able to swim in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and will always stand up for what is right and 'speak the truth'.</p>

<p>'It has been a difficult and long process, but one thing has never changed for me from day one: I have never bought, possessed, been supplied with or used prohibited substances in any way,' she told the publication.</p>

<p>Shayna is provisionally suspended, and has been for approximately 15 months. Her case is currently pending and her hearing has not yet taken place, but the exact date will not be released to the public.</p>

<p>SAS Australia will see contestants having to endure sleep deprivation, interrogation and physical endurance in order to pass the Special Forces' entry requirements.</p>

<p>Disgraced ex-WAG Arabella Del Busso, publicist Roxy Jacenko, former Ironwoman Candice Warner and comedian Merrick Watts have all been confirmed for the show.</p>

<p>SAS Australia premieres this October on Channel Seven </p>

<p>Denial: Shayna says she 'has never bought, possessed, been supplied with or used prohibited substances in any way'</p>
