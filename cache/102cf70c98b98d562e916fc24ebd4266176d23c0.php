<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump indicated he thought Fox News Channel's Chris Wallace did a poor job as a debate moderator minutes after the first presidential debate concluded. </p>

<p>The president retweeted a tweet critical of Wallace written by The Blaze's CEO Tyler Cardon.  </p>

<p>'Regardless who you’re pulling for, I think we can all agree that Joe Rogan would do a much better job moderating this thing than Chris Wallace,' Cardon wrote. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump indicated that he was not pleased with 'Fox News Sunday' host Chris Wallace's moderating style, immediately retweeting a tweet critical of him </p>

<p>The tweet came from The Blaze CEO Tyler Cardon, who said that 'Joe Rogan would do a much better job' </p>

<p>'Fox News Sunday' host Chris Wallace moderated the first presidential debate Tuesday night in Cleveland, Ohio </p>

<p>Wallace was tasked with trying to keep Trump and Democrat Joe Biden in line with what the Commission on Presidential Debates had laid out, which had been agreed to by both presidential campaigns. </p>

<p>Early on, Wallace was often struggling to get questions out, tripped up by candidate interruptions.    </p>

<p>'If I may ask my question sir,' he told Trump near the top of the 90-minute face-off. 'Over the last four years you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never, in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.' </p>

<p>Trump shot back, 'Of course I have, I got rid of the individual mandate.'  </p>

<p>Wallace pointed out he hadn't asked his question yet. </p>

<p>'Excuse me, I got rid of the individual mandate,' Trump insisted.</p>

<p>Wallace interjected, 'That is not a comprehensive plan,' with Trump adding, 'It's absolutely a big thing.' </p>

<p>'You're debating him, not me,' Wallace told Trump. 'Let me ask my question.'  </p>

<p>But interruptions continued throughout the night, with mostly Trump, but also Biden, often cutting into the other candidates' answers. </p>

<p>'Your campaign agreed that both sides would get two minute answers uninterrupted,' Wallace said at one point, directing the comment at Trump. 'Why don't you observe what your campaign agreed to?'   </p>

<p>Wallace also noted, 'If you want to switch seats ... we can do that.'  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Joe Rogan - an MMA fighter and comedisan - floated the idea of hosting a long-form presidential debate during an episode of his podcast 'The Joe Rogan Experience.' </p>

<p>The presidential candidates have officially agreed to take part in three presidential debates, which will continue through the month of October.  </p>
