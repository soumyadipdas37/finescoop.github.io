<p>Kylie became a star by way of the reality show, which aired its pilot episode in October 2007 when she was only 10 years old.</p>

<p>Although there were rumors that she and her older half-sisters Kourtney and Kim Kardashian pushed for the show to end, the family has denied as much.</p>

<p>The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for the whole family who made the decision together.</p>

<p>Throwback to 2007: She also put up the post on the heels of an announcement that Keeping Up With The Kardashians is coming to an end</p>

<p>Their denial came in the wake of a source telling The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'</p>

<p>To hear this source tell it: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'</p>

<p>However the Sun also had a different insider claim that the Kardashian-Jenner family jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.</p>

<p>During its run Keeping Up With The Kardashians sprouted several spin-offs including Life Of Kylie which ran only one season in 2017. </p>
