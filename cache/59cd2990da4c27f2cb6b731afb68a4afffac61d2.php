<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A black lawyer has said she was mistaken for the defendant three times in a single day in court.</p>

<p>Alexandra Wilson, 25, from Essex, later declared on Twitter 'there must be something about my face that says ''not a barrister''.'</p>

<p>The criminal and family law barrister said the shocking incident 'upset' her and social media users blasted it as 'unacceptable'.</p>

<p>She tweeted: 'Today I was assumed to be a defendant 3 times and a journalist once (lol).</p>

<p>'There MUST be something about my face that says 'not a barrister' because I am literally wearing a black suit like everyone else.'</p>

<p>Ms Wilson, from London barristers 5 St Andrew's Hill and founder of Black Women in Law, added: 'I don't get it. Today it actually upset me a bit but... we move x.'</p>

<p>Alexandra Wilson (pictured), 25, from Essex, later declared on Twitter 'there must be something about my face that says ''not a barrister'''</p>

<p>Twitter users piled in with support for the lawyer, including the author The Secret Barrister, who wrote: 'I'm so sorry, Alex. Have you reported it?</p>

<p>'Sounds like what we're supposed to now call ''a training need'' for the staff in question. Completely unacceptable.'</p>

<p>Another social media user posted: 'Not only unacceptable in every way... but also 100 per cent wrong as you are literally exactly what a barrister looks like.'</p>

<p>One woman user commented: 'It's always depressing to read this and similar accounts.</p>

<p>'Were the people who mistook you for anything other than a barrister other professional court users, court staff, or members of the public, or would you rather not say?'</p>

<p>Professor Jo Delahunty added: 'I was gonna post a ''head in hands/despair'' shot but won't as that changes nothing.</p>

<p>'You shouldn't have to put up with situations that your white colleagues are ashamed of.</p>

<p>'We can only change that if we celebrate,as well as support, our black and BAME colleagues. You rock Ms Wilson.'</p>

<p>It comes a day after Ms Wilson spotted Amazon was selling caps with the slogan 'Black Lives Don't Matter' - marketed as 'elegant' and a 'nice present'.</p>

<p>She tweeted: 'This is not ok. <?php echo e('@'); ?>Amazon why is this racist hat being sold on your site? Are there no checks in place? This is honestly embarrassing.'</p>

<p>The online retail giant later removed the £12.96 caps, which were sold by a third party seller.</p>

<p>A description, written by the seller, said the items were 'high quality' with a 'unique and fashionable' design that made them a 'nice present for family and friends'.</p>

<p>Ms Wilson tweeted after the caps were removed: 'The largest online company sold caps telling us that 'Black Lives Don't Matter'.</p>

<p>'We spoke up and it's finally gone. The power of social media. Imagine if the big companies and celebrities who posted a black square on social media used their platform to let activists speak?</p>

<p>'Thank you to everyone who contacted Amazon directly. These small actions make a big difference. No one should ever have to see anything like this.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has approached 5 St Andrew's Hill for comment on the court incident on Wednesday.</p>
