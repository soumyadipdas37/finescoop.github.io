<p>A third of outlets, many family owned, could close after trade fell sharply, industry leaders warned yesterday.</p>

<p>Attention so far in deserted town and city centres has focused on the plight of sandwich chains, restaurants and retailers.</p>

<p>But there are growing concerns that the predicament of Britain’s dry cleaners – and many other sectors hit by the pandemic – have been overlooked.</p>

<p>Industry leaders said workers had left their suits hanging in wardrobes for months and instead been wearing casual clothes they can machine-wash themselves.</p>

<p>Businesses said trade has dropped to as little as 30 per cent of levels before the lockdown and, in some cases, well below that.</p>

<p>Dry cleaners had already faced waning demand over the past decade as more people wore casual clothes to work. </p>

<p>‘I would say 20 to 30 per cent of outlets will go,’ said David Stevens, chief executive of the Textile Services Association.</p>

<p>‘The independents will really struggle and when the furlough scheme ends, there will be real problems,’ he added.</p>

<p>There are no firm figures for the number of dry-cleaning businesses but estimates suggest there could be as many as 4,000.</p>

<p>David Lambert, founder of Laundry Republic, an online collection and delivery service, said: ‘Between 20 and 40 per cent of dry-cleaning businesses are not going to survive. Hundreds and hundreds of family outlets are likely to go. They have been hit really hard.</p>

<p>‘With people working from home, they are not wearing the type of clothes that typically need dry cleaning. That means the bread-and-butter business has evaporated.’</p>

<p>He said some firms had tried to innovate, for example by collecting clothes from self-isolating or busy customers, then returning them after cleaning. Others have offered discounts to key workers.</p>

<p>Mr Lambert added: ‘We have seen some improvement in the past couple of weeks, to about 40 to 50 per cent of normal levels. But if there is a dramatic increase in people working from home regularly, that will have a major impact on the market.’</p>

<p>Nilesh Patel, who owns Belmont Dry Cleaners in Beckenham and Dulwich, South-East London, said: ‘I have had to step back into my business unpaid to keep it afloat.’</p>

<p>He is part of a WhatsApp group of about 100 people in the industry, and none had reported any rent reduction from their landlord. He added: ‘I’d like to see the Government giving the sort of help it gave restaurants, with the discount scheme.’</p>
