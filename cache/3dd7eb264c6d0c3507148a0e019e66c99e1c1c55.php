<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The EC has reportedly rejected UK requests for vehicles produced in Britain using imported parts to avoid higher export tariffs </p>

<p>The European Union has rejected a request from the UK to consider car parts from Japan and Turkey as British when they are used in the production of vehicles in the country, according to reports today.</p>

<p>The decision would mean that some car makers in Britain would attract higher tariffs with or without a trade deal. </p>

<p>According to a letter to the car industry from Britain's chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost, seen by the BBC, the EC rejected the key request.</p>

<p>In a report issued on Wednesday, the BBC said it had also obtained a separate draft legal text in which the UK requested the manufacturing of goods such as electric cars and batteries - as well as electric bicycles - to be counted as British, even if the majority of components are imported.</p>

<p>Both documents reportedly refer to the need for UK manufacturers, even if a Brexit deal is reached, to ensure that goods exported from the UK are British-made and contain a certain amount of British parts, believed to be around 55 per cent.</p>

<p>An anticipated deal had been expected to allow any components sourced from EU countries to count as British, an idea known as 'cumulation'.</p>

<p>However the letter from Lord Frost reportedly states the EU has denied the request to extend cumulation to include other partners of the UK and EU, including Turkey and Japan.</p>

<p>This is likely to be a blow to a number of UK car makers, especially Japanese firms with large vehicle plants across the country using parts shipped into the country.</p>

<p>That includes Nissan, which has the largest single vehicle production plant in the UK located in Sunderland where the Qashqai, Juke and Leaf are built, as well as Toyota's Burnaston factory producing the Corolla family car and Honda in Swindon - though the latter is due to close in 2021. </p>

<p>According to the BBC, the letter said: 'The commission has made clear that it will not agree third-country cumulation in any circumstances, which we regret, but obviously cannot insist upon.</p>

<p>'I am sorry to say that so far they (EU negotiators) have neither been willing to discuss these nor share any proposed text with us.'</p>

<p>For cars produced in Britain to avoid higher tariffs, a minimum of 55% of their parts need to be British</p>

<p>David Leggett, automotive analyst at GlobalData, said the move would be a 'serious blow for manufacturers in Britain such as Nissan and Toyota who import significant volumes of parts from so-called 'third countries'.'</p>

<p>He added: 'Even in the event of a UK-EU free trade deal being struck, the problem lies in the determination of what is or is not eligible for free circulation between the UK and EU, qualifying as British (or local) content.</p>

<p>'Under the usual principles of bilateral free trade deals, mutual recognition and rules of origin mean that cars made in Britain need to meet around 55 per cent 'British' content to count as British and avoid tariffs, but crucially, EU-sourced parts would be included in that 'local content' calculation. </p>

<p>'The shipments to the EU of finished new cars meeting that 55 per cent threshold would therefore not attract tariffs under a free trade agreement (FTA).</p>

<p>'Many cars made in the UK and exported to the EU should be able to meet that threshold - but some may not, because of the application of rules of origin by the EU and this is where Nissan and Toyota could be especially vulnerable.'</p>

<p>He explained: 'Nissan could be exposed by the value of imports of parts from Japan for its Sunderland-made electric Leaf and a consequential lower level of local content. </p>

<p>'Similarly, Toyota's UK plant works closely with Turkish suppliers. </p>

<p>'These two manufacturers could find some of their exports fall below the 55 per cent local content threshold and therefore become liable to EU tariffs, even if a UK-EU trade deal is struck.</p>

<p>'Exports to Europe are vital for these two plants and attracting new tariffs of 10 per cent on shipments to the EU would seriously hamper their competitive position.'</p>

<p>An anticipated deal had been expected to allow any components sourced from EU countries to count as British, an idea known as 'cumulation'</p>

<p>The report comes just a day after the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders launched a new 'Safe Harbour Scheme', designed to help save jobs across the UK automotive industry, including its critical supply chain.</p>

<p>The scheme has been created to support companies struggling to ramp up production while battling the effects of the coronavirus crisis and ongoing market uncertainty.</p>

<p>Supported by the Automotive Council and government, it is said to provide a mechanism for automotive businesses to engage with their customers, lenders, creditors and other stakeholders to 'find ways to minimise the risk of insolvencies'.</p>

<p>The pandemic has so far resulted in at least 9,000 job losses across the sector as a whole, with an additional 5,000 in the UK supply chain, according to the trade body. </p>

<p>And it warned that this is 'just the tip of the iceberg' as ongoing restrictions for manufacturing and the threat of further lockdowns remain.</p>

<p>Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said on Tuesday: 'With the UK automotive sector badly hit by the coronavirus crisis, thousands of jobs already lost and barely weeks left until a fundamental change of trading conditions with our largest market, the EU, the pressures on automotive businesses are immense. </p>

<p>'Inevitably, these pressures are going to take their toll on businesses, so the Safe Harbour Scheme has been created to help any suppliers in trouble. </p>

<p>'It should provide valuable breathing space as the sector restarts and business and consumer confidence recovers. </p>

<p>'Ultimately, however, the industry must maintain its competitiveness to grow and for that we still look to the Government to deliver an ambitious trade deal with the EU.' </p>
