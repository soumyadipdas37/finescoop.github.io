<p>She added: 'I also turn 50 next year, so I’m expecting a joint birthday! In fact, as a present I think I should be able to press all the golden buzzers!'</p>

<p>Amanda and her co-judges - Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon - returned to screens this weekend for the first time since the pandemic put a stop to production on the current series.</p>

<p>The show resumes over September and October after a lengthy wait, with social distancing now in place and no studio audience.</p>

<p>The Kiss Me Kate actress said: 'Being a meter apart will be annoying because we’re a very emotive judging panel and we hug one another if an act has been particularly emotional and set one of us off crying.</p>

<p>'It’s going to feel very odd explaining to all our kids that they can’t come and hang out backstage.'</p>

<p>The semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. The final will then take place live in October.</p>

<p>As usual, Ant and Dec will host, and Ashley Banjo will replace Simon at the judges’ desk, after the head judge broke his back in LA three weeks ago during a bike accident.</p>
