<p>The prime minister was not shy either but looked a bit worried as he held a quokka while his daughter and zoo keepers watched on. </p>

<p>Following their cuddling with the animals, the pair took a tour around the zoo and stopped to chat with other families. </p>

<p>His visit comes after South Australia reopened its borders to New South Wales on Friday following low COVID-19 cases and community transmission. </p>

<p>He said Sydneysiders would be right behind him and head to South Australia providing a massive $800million boost to the economy. </p>

<p>Mr Morrison stressed once again that when other states reopen their borders or not they should explain to the people why. </p>

<p>'All I've simply asked is when states make those decisions that they do it efficiently, that they explain the reasons and they seek to administer it in a way that is done fairly,' he said.</p>

<p>'They are judgments that at the more micro level the states will make and so I leave them to make them.'</p>

<p>The trip also saw Mr Morrison visit the newly constructed shipyard for the navy's fleet of frigates, and speak at the SA Liberal Party's annual meeting. </p>

<p>Back in July, Mr Morrison was slammed for taking a break to spend time with his family but was instead spotted at an NRL game. </p>

<p>'I will not be joining them for that full-time. I will also not be standing aside from the tasks I have all day,' he said on Friday. </p>

<p>Australians vented their frustration as Mr Morrison's break came at the same time as COVID-19 cases were surging again in Victoria.</p>

<p>Others however said the prime minister deserved some time off for all the work he had put in.  </p>
