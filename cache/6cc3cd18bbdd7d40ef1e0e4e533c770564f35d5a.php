<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chloe Sims and Pete Wicks were secret lovers but fell out when things got messy, it has been claimed.</p>

<p>The TOWIE stars, who didn't speak for eight months after a row in January, are said to have struggled with putting a label on their feelings for each other. </p>

<p>A source told The Sun On Sunday: 'They crossed the line from friendship to romance and it got messy.</p>

<p>Not impressed: Chloe Sims and Pete Wicks are said to have become 'secret lovers' but fallen out when things got 'messy</p>

<p>'After a string of failed relationships on the show, the last thing Chloe wanted was another guy letting her down publicly, but Pete was never clear about his intentions.'</p>

<p>The source added that Chloe, 37, felt 'slighted' by Pete's behaviour and this has caused the tension in their long-term friendship. </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted a representative of Chloe and Pete for a comment.   </p>

<p>It had appeared as if the pair had started to patch things up in recent episodes of The Only Way Is Essex.</p>

<p>Complicated: A source claimed that Pete wasn't 'clear about his intentions' which made Chloe feel 'slighted'</p>

<p>They were first seen talking again after their eight-month long break when they bumped into each other in the park.</p>

<p>During this chat Chloe admitted that she had missed her pal, but added: 'You were a bit of an a***hole. Towards the end of our friendship I felt like you started dismissing my feelings.' </p>

<p>However despite things looking more positive, tensions appear to still be awry between Chloe and Pete during the upcoming Sunday night episode of the show, as they hash out their differences over drinks.</p>

<p>On the mend? It had appeared as if the two pals had patched things up after they spoke again at the park after eight months of radio silence in a recent TOWIE episode </p>

<p>Chloe reveals she feels 'confused' because Pete, 31, failed to contact her and reach out after they met up for a night out to try and begin fixing their relationship.</p>

<p>While meeting for a drinking Pete says to Chloe: 'Nice to see ya.'</p>

<p>Without conviction, Chloe replies: 'Yeah so nice', and Pete sarcastically tells her that she 'looks happy', as they sit opposite one another in a bar. </p>

<p>Chloe says: 'I'm happy', and Pete quips back: 'Try and tell your face you're having a good time. No? Not quite there yet.'</p>

<p>Revealing how she feels, Chloe says: 'I don't know what you want from me. One minute you're in the forest with Peggy with tears in your eyes saying how much you miss me and all this s**t. </p>

<p>Having it out: Although talking, Chloe did vent some of her frustrating at their meeting and accused Pete of 'dismissing her feelings' during the confrontation </p>

<p>'Then we have a really fun time and everything felt normal and you said yourself it felt like we hadn't been apart, and then nothing.'</p>

<p>Pete says: 'Well I don't know what you want me to say about it.' </p>

<p>Explaining how it affects her, she adds: 'I find it really confusing, one of the main reasons I stopped talking to you before was because I couldn't work you out.'</p>

<p>While Pete simply says: 'Ok.'</p>

<p>Clearly frustrated, Chloe says: 'That's what you do, you say okay and I'm still none the wiser in no man's land. It's annoying and I'm sick of it.' </p>

<p>Tension: It is thought that the upcoming TOWIE epsiodes will explore more about the pair's friendship</p>
