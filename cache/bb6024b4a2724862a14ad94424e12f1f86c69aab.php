<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool turned on the style to finish their pre-season in ruthless style with a nine-goal thriller against Neil Critchley's Blackpool.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp's side arranged the match against their former coach's side, to have a final run-out before the return of Premier League action.</p>

<p>And, despite going two goals down and having several big names missing due to international duty, the Reds surged into life to pull off a demolition comeback.</p>

<p>Harvey Elliott took his chance to impress for Liverpool by grabbing his first senior goal</p>

<p>The youngster was congratulated by veteran James Milner, who captained Liverpool at Anfield</p>

<p>Sepp Van den Berg put icing on the cake, scoring Liverpool's seventh and his first senior goal</p>

<p>An early Blackpool goal was gifted courtesy of youngster Billy Koumetio, whose error allowed CJ Hamilton to capitalise and score.</p>

<p>A penalty soon after was duly converted by Jerry Yates, before Liverpool quickly jolted into life with Klopp bellowing from the touchline. </p>

<p>Returning defender Joel Matip handed his side a boost after converting on the cusp of half time, before words of wisdom at the interval clearly resonated with the Liverpool players.</p>

<p>Returning defender Joel Matip got Liverpool off the mark on the brink of half-time, at 2-1</p>

<p>Takumi Minamino was bright throughout and his performance was rewarded with a goal</p>

<p>A deft flick from Brazilian Roberto Firmino saw him also get on the score-sheet at Anfield</p>

<p>Sadio Mane was also in the right place at  the right time to tap in from close range</p>

<p>The hosts would come out for the second period and go on to hit the back of the net six times, blowing away their opponents with superior fitness levels.</p>

<p>A frantic four-minute spell saw both Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino ripple the net from close range, before teenager Harvey Elliott slalomed through Blackpool bodies to fire a powerful and low effort and register his first senior goal.</p>

<p>Takumi Minamino, who looked bright and industrious throughout the contest, was rewarded with a goal of his own before substitute Divock Origi scored after being set up by local lad Curtis Jones.</p>

<p>Icing was placed on the cake with another teen breaking their senior scoring duck, with Dutch defender Sepp Van den Berg finding the back of the net from close range.</p>
