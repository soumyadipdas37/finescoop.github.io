<p>Sydney baker Walla Abu-Eid's vanilla slices flavoured with Lotus Biscoff, which have gone viral since the recipe was shared on Instagram on Monday</p>

<p>The gifted chef starts by lining the base of a baking tray with a layer of Arnott's lattice biscuits, available from leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.</p>

<p>To make the filling, Ms Abu-Eid adds 600ml of double cream to a bowl and sprinkles a packet of Cottee's instant vanilla pudding mix on top, then whisks for roughly one minute until the mixture is thick and fluffy.</p>

<p>Next, she heats a jar of Biscoff in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften the spread. Once cooled, she spoons it into the pudding mixture, folding together until smooth.</p>

<p>Finally, Ms Abu-Eid pours the vanilla mixture over the biscuit base and covers it with a second layer of biscuits before leaving it to set in the fridge for 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The slices can be topped with a dusting of icing sugar or a simple sugar glaze made from water and icing sugar, but this is optional. </p>

<p>Fans have branded Ms Abu-Eid a 'genius' with 'golden hands', capable of turning typically time-consuming desserts into quick and easy recipes suitable for bakers of all skill levels</p>

<p>Earlier in September, the 31-year-old revealed the recipe for her widely acclaimed Lotus Biscoff lasagne, a reinvention of the classic Italian dinner which has been shared by more than 60 global news outlets.</p>

<p>In a video filmed for Instagram TV, she whipped up the decadent, cheesecake-style creation with five ingredients: sugar, cream, vanilla extract, biscuits and Biscoff spread.</p>

<p>To make the filling, Ms Abu-Eid mixes a carton of thickened cream with a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of vanilla extract, whipping until 'soft peaks' form in the mixture.</p>

<p>It should be thick and slightly stiff without being over beaten, which causes the cream to curdle.</p>

<p>Next, she heats a jar of Biscoff spread in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften – and then gets down to assembling the dessert.</p>

<p>Ms Abu-Eid lines the base of a glass baking dish with Biscoff biscuits, then covers them with the sugar and cream mixture.</p>

<p>She drizzles some melted Biscoff spread over the cream, then repeats the process three times, ending with a layer of cream on top.</p>

<p>Scooping any remaining spread into a piping bag, she pipes thin lines onto the cream and runs through them with a skewer or toothpick, creating an ornate triangular pattern.</p>

<p>Fans have branded Ms Abu-Eid's sweet lasagne a 'work of art' and a 'culinary masterpiece' on social media</p>

<p>Finally, she crumbles leftover biscuits into fine crumbs and sprinkles them around the edge of the dish for decoration.</p>

<p>Fans have hailed Ms Abu-Eid's dessert lasagne a 'work of art' and a 'culinary masterpiece' on social media, where a video of the preparation has racked up over 85,000 views.</p>

<p>The gifted baker also makes the lasagne in the shape of a classic cheesecake for customers on her up-and-coming bakery page, Bake My Cake by Walla.</p>
