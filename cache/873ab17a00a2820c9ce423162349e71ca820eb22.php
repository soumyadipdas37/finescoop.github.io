<p>The marketing manager, 26, was forced to respond to rumours she's using the dating app after Woman's Day claimed her profile surfaced last week.</p>

<p>'I haven't seen the article but I'm definitely not on Tinder and have actually never had a profile on there,' she told The Wash.</p>

<p>'It must be a fake account': The Bachelor's Bella Varelis (pictured) denied she's using Tinder after a fan claimed they 'spotted her on the dating app' on Monday</p>

<p>'It must be a fake account,' she explained. </p>

<p>'I think I'll just be focusing on myself for a little while. I'm open to it if the right person comes along but I only just feel like this is the first week I've got my life back!'</p>

<p>On Monday, Woman's Day  claimed Bella had been spotted on dating app Tinder.  </p>

<p>A Tinder profile surfaced last week, with fans claiming they'd happily 'swipe right' to score a date with the marketing manager.</p>

<p>Looking for love... again: She said: 'I haven't seen the article but I'm definitely not on Tinder and have actually never had a profile on there'</p>

<p>It's unclear if the profile was real, as fake and catfish accounts often are created with photos of celebrity and reality TV stars. </p>
