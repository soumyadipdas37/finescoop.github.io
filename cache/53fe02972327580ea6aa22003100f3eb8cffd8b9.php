<p>'Not practical for me. It doesn't hold enough, costs too much and is way too big,' one person said.</p>

<p>'I'd need more storage for my storage! I'm looking at the gaps between the layers on this thinking it's such waisted space,' said another.</p>

<p>The company also offers storage containers for your artificial Christmas tree, which are on sale for $299 at the moment.</p>

<p>All orders qualify for free shipping Australia-wide because of the price and arrive within eight working days. </p>
