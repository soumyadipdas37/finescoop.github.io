<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Emmerdale actor John Bowe has revealed that he's broken his shoulder after falling off a ladder - just months after he contracted coronavirus.</p>

<p>The 70 year old, who is best known for playing Lawrence White in the ITV soap, revealed the news on Twitter.</p>

<p>John penned: 'I’ve had an accident. I’ve broken my shoulder but more intriguing is the ‘Star of David’ I’ve acquired on my forehead. </p>

<p>'I shall survive': Actor John Bowe has revealed over Twitter that he's broken his shoulder just months after nearly dying from coronavirus </p>

<p>'Fear not. I shall survive. 2020. What a year,' he added. </p>

<p>John's 'Star of David' refers to the star-shaped bruise the actor now has on his forehead.      </p>

<p>John joined Emmerdale in 2014 and left four years later when his alter ego Lawrence and his on-screen daughter Chrissie were killed in a dramatic car crash.</p>

<p>John also appeared in Coronation Street between 1999 and 2002 as businessman Duggie Greeman.</p>

<p>How things were: John is best known for playing Lawrence White in ITV soap Emmerdale</p>

<p>Coronation Street's Charlie Lawson responded to John's post on Twitter.</p>

<p>'Good Lord John! What have you done??' he enquired. </p>

<p>'Never work at the top of a ladder without assistance,' replied John. </p>

<p>John's shoulder breakage is not the first major health scare he has faced this year. Back in March, the soap star 'nearly died' after contracting coronavirus.</p>

<p>Trench humour: John managed to see the funny side of his injury as he joked about a 'Star of David' </p>

<p>Old friends: Coronation Street's Charlie Lawson was one of the first to respond to John's post</p>

<p>Tweeting at the time, he wrote: '#Coronavirus Sunday observations. I have nearly died twice in my life. Once just last week. </p>

<p>'The gauze between life and death is extremely thin and oh so easy to pass through. Certainly in one direction. Not sure about the other. As yet.'</p>

<p>He went on to plead with people to stop spending time outdoors in the hope of ending the crisis.</p>

<p>'Beware the fickleness, selfishness and stupidity of the masses. Come on UK. We’re better than this. Stand firm and strong behind our leaders who, together with us, are trying to find a way through this vicious clinging swamp. #StayHomeSaveLives”</p>

<p>Dramatic exit: John joined Emmerdale in 2014 and left four years later when his character Lawrence and on-screen daughter Chrissie were killed in a car crash</p>
