<p>Not only was Plate of Origin defeated in the ratings by Channel 10's The Masked Singer and Nine's The Block, even Anh's Brush with Fame on the ABC pulled in more viewers.</p>

<p>Former television executive Rob McKnight, who runs respected industry website TV Blackbox, told news.com.au: 'The show's dead.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'With stiff competition of The Block, Plate of Origin just isn't firing. When you get a drop-off like you did from night one to night two, that's an indication that the show's not strong enough for viewers to return.'</p>

<p>Former television executive Rob McKnight, who runs respected industry website TV Blackbox , told news.com.au: 'The show's dead'</p>

<p>McKnight believes that viewers enjoyed the most recent season of MasterChef so much that they're not interested in Plate of Origin, which has a 'confusing format'.</p>

<p>Despite Plate of Origin bombing, Seven has had a strong year with the success of both Big Brother and Farmer Wants a Wife.</p>

<p>The recent Farmer Wants a Wife finale pulled in a national audience of 1.472 million. A new season has now been commissioned and will air in 2021. </p>
