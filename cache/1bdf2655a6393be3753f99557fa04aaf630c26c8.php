<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Premier League and FA have made significant cuts to their annual funding of the Football Foundation, who invest over £100million each year in facilities and improving pitches for the grassroots and junior game.</p>

<p>Both bodies usually commit about £30million a year to the Foundation, with Government and local funding making up the rest of their budget, but the contribution from the elite has been slashed due to cost-cutting at both the Premier League and the FA caused by the impact of Covid-19.</p>

<p>It is hoped the cut will only be for one year and can be made up by the Government, as the Conservative Party’s general election manifesto contained a pledge to increase their funding by £550m over the next 10 years. The Football Foundation has been active during the pandemic, providing £10m in emergency relief funds to grassroots clubs to help ensure their facilities are Covid-secure.</p>

<p>Everton have been dragged into a dispute between Real Madrid and Argentine side Banfield over James Rodriguez due to an unpaid solidarity payment owed to his first club. </p>

<p>Banfield say Real told them that Rodriguez moved to Goodison Park on a free transfer, which would remove their right to a sell-on fee, whereas sources on Merseyside have confirmed that Everton paid around £13million for the Colombian, as previously reported by Sportsmail.</p>

<p>Real rather than Everton are liable to pass on a percentage of the fee to Banfield, who sold Rodriguez to Porto for £4.5m in 2010.</p>

<p>The Premier League have begun legal proceedings against their former Chinese TV rights partner Suning Holdings after agreeing a cut-price one-year deal with a replacement streaming service Tencent.</p>

<p>Top-flight clubs voted to terminate their existing three-year deal with Suning, worth £564million, earlier this month after the broadcaster withheld a payment of £160m that was due last April. </p>

<p>The new deal is only worth £17m up front to the Premier League which is less than 10 per cent of the value of the old contract. But it also includes revenue-sharing based on subscriptions in China and they have already received half of this season’s money from Suning, which will mitigate the clubs’ losses. </p>

<p>The Premier League are also confident of gaining compensation from Suning through legal action as they believe that deal was covered by contract protection insurance policy.</p>

<p>The enforcement of Covid-19 protocols appears to vary massively between the Premier League and the Football League. At some Premier League clubs the so-called Covid snoop squads have gone to the extreme lengths of timing how long players spend in showers after matches, whereas at the lower level breaches of protocol appear to be rife. </p>

<p>At least one Championship club regularly travelled to away matches in a single coach last season to save money rather than following EFL guidance that recommended three coaches be used to ensure the players and staff could maintain social distancing.</p>

<p>Chelsea striker Timo Werner is the latest big name to sign up to Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata’s Common Goal initiative, which sees players and managers commit to donating one per cent of their salaries to fund charitable projects across the world.</p>

<p>Werner’s involvement in the charity will be announced later today with the 24-year-old joining a stellar list of Common Goal members that includes Jurgen Klopp, Eric Cantona, Serge Gnabry and Kasper Schmeichel.</p>
