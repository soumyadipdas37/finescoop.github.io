<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian chemical weapons expert who was tragically killed in a bomb blast in the Solomon Islands has been remembered by heartbroken friends as a 'modern day MacGyver' who risked his life to save others.</p>

<p>Australian Trent Lee, 40, and Briton Luke Atkinson, 57, died when an explosion ripped through a residential street in Honiara, the nation's capital, between 7.30pm and 8pm on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr Lee was working as a bomb specialist for non-government organisation Norwegian People's Aid.</p>

<p>The organisation employed people to help remove undetonated explosives that had been littered across the Solomon Islands during World War II.</p>

<p>A close friend of the 40-year-old, Tony Bartlett, said he and his wife were now getting tattoos to remember their selfless mate.</p>

<p>Trent Lee, 40, from Newcastle was killed on Sunday night while removing World War II explosives from the Solomon Islands</p>

<p>Mr Lee had moved to the Solomon Islands 18 months ago with his partner and has been remembered as an extremely smart and selfless man</p>

<p>'He has got to be one of the smartest people in this world,' Mr Bartlett told the Sydney Morning Herald.</p>

<p>'This guy, he built his own cellular tower, his own generator. It's amazing what he could do for his community over there. He was a modern day MacGyver, there's nothing this man couldn't do.' </p>

<p>Mr Bartlett said his friend even legally changed his middle name to 'danger' while getting his drivers licence in the Solomon Islands.</p>

<p>He said in the weeks before his death Mr Lee had removed up to 90 explosives.</p>

<p>'He would have saved thousands of lives. That was Trent,' Mr Bartlett said.</p>

<p>Mr Lee, who was originally from Newcastle, moved to the Islands 18 months ago with his wife Kathryn to build an eco-lodge.</p>

<p>During his time there he also worked as a chief chemist for a gold mine and taught locals how to build water supply systems.</p>

<p>In his younger years Mr Lee had been a champion mountain bike rider and his skills in cave diving scored him a spot on an Australian $1 stamp in 2017.</p>

<p>On the night of the explosion, residents rushed to the scene to see both men seriously injured.</p>

<p>Mr Lee had been a champion mountain bike rider and cave diver before starting his work in the Solomon Islands</p>

<p>Investigators are seen at the crime scene on Sunday night after the two men were killed </p>

<p>Just a month before the fatal explosion, Mr Lee took to Facebook to talk about how dangerous his line of work was.</p>

<p>'Pretty much the most dangerous WW2 ammunition we find...it's cocked and ready to fire...one bump and it's all over,' he wrote on August 13. </p>

<p>Sunday evening's bomb blast could be heard up to five kilometres away.  </p>

<p>Local police sealed off the blast area and launched an investigation.</p>

<p>A police statement said officers of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team and Forensics Department were at the scene.</p>

<p>The two men were conducting a non-technical survey on the contamination of unexploded ordnances in the Solomons, the police media statement said. </p>

<p>The pair had been working to remove an explosive in Honiara when they were killed in the 'tragic accident' </p>

<p>Inspector Clifford Tunuki said police spent the night clearing the explosion site. </p>

<p>'Explosives ordinance disposal officers will have to render the scene safe before forensics and other investigators access the scene to find out what happened,' Inspector Tunuki told media. </p>

<p>NPA deputy secretary-general Per Nergaard confirmed in a statement that Mr Lee and Mr Atkinson had died in the blast.</p>

<p>Trent Lee posted about the dangers of working with live bombs just a month before the fatal explosion  (pictured, images from his Facebook page)</p>

<p>The Solomon Islands (pictured) are littered with unexploded material from World War II, according to NPA</p>

<p>'This is a tragic accident. So far, we know that there has been an explosion with fatal consequences,' he said.</p>

<p>'Our main priority now is to offer assistance to relatives and colleagues and to clarify what has happened.</p>

<p>'The safety and security of our staff is our highest priority.'</p>

<p>NPA secretary-general Henriette Killi Westhrin said the organisation was devastated by the loss of two good colleagues.</p>

<p>'Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to their families, relatives and staff.'</p>

<p>The NPA has 1850 deminers working in 19 countries worldwide.</p>

<p>The organisation has since put all work removing explosives on hold while the deaths are investigated.</p>

<p>Thousands of unexploded devices remain on the Solomon Islands. </p>
