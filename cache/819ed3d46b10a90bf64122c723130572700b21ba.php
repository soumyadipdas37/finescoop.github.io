<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A grandmother had denied killing her 11-month-old granddaughter who drowned in the bath after being left unsupervised for two minutes, a jury has been told. </p>

<p>Shirley Grenfell, 53, has gone on trial for manslaughter at Truro Crown Court, Cornwall, following the death of the toddler.</p>

<p>Chanelle Grenfell had been having a bath along with her older sister, who was then two and a half years old, on Boxing Day in 2017. </p>

<p>In a 999 call the girls' grandmother said: 'Both of my granddaughters were in having a bath. I was in the bedroom just getting dressed because I had just had a bath.</p>

<p>'I did not realise the 11-month-old was under the water.'</p>

<p>Grenfell, of Illogan, Cornwall, denies manslaughter by gross negligence and a second alternative count of cruelty to a child under 16.</p>

<p>Shirley Grenfell, 53, has gone on trial for manslaughter at Truro Crown Court (pictured), Cornwall, following the death of her 11-month-old granddaughter</p>

<p>Prosecutor Miss Jo Martin QC told the jury that the NHS advise is that babies and toddlers should be put into a bath filled with no more than two inches of water and that they should 'not be left alone for a moment'.</p>

<p>She said the bath at Grenfell's house had 14 cm of water in it at the time. </p>

<p>Miss Martin said that babies sitting in a bath can topple over and cannot right themselves and that can lead to them drowning.</p>

<p>The girls had stayed over on Christmas Day night at their grandmother's home because the little girls' parents had to go to the local hospital where their two-month -old son was in intensive care after being born premature.</p>

<p>The prosecutor said: 'She left them in the bath unattended, unsupervised for some time, at least two minutes, possibly more, while she went into her bedroom.</p>

<p>'While absent Chanelle drowned. Shirley Grenfell never meant for Chanelle to die but she had a duty of care and failed in that duty.' </p>

<p>Grenfell told police that she had emptied some of the water after her own bath before she put the two sisters in the bath to wash their hair.</p>

<p>She said she put Chanelle at the tap end of the bath and the water was 'up to their bellies' with some plastic toys for them to play with.</p>

<p>Grenfell told police that she went into her bedroom and put on her dressing gown before she heard the two and a half year old shout 'nanny'.</p>

<p>She went into the bathroom and said Chanelle was 'under the water on her back' and believed she was completely submerged.</p>

<p>She said she had bathed the girls before and on this occasion she was out of the bathroom for 'two to three minutes'.</p>

<p>She made a distraught call to 999 and told the call handler what had happened.</p>

<p>She said Chanelle was 'lifeless' and one of Grenfell's sons was giving her mouth to mouth resuscitation.</p>

<p>The baby was rushed to Treliske Hospital in Truro but was declared dead the next day. A post mortem concluded she died from drowning.</p>

<p>The jury was told that a pathologist noted that she inhaled water and that a seated baby in a bath would be unable to right herself once she toppled over in the bath.</p>

<p>Miss Martin told the court: 'What happened on Boxing Day was clearly a tragedy and people clearly make mistakes.'</p>

<p>She said the law requires people who have a duty of care not to neglect that duty.</p>

<p>Miss Martin said: 'Leaving an 11-month-old baby in a bath unsupervised gives rise to a serious and obvious risk of death.</p>

<p>'She was being negligent, not just negligent, but grossly negligent,' she said.</p>

<p>Mr Simon Laws, QC, defending, told the jury: 'Sadly tragedies and accidents happen.</p>

<p>'Very often someone is to blame. What happened was the last thing that anyone would possibly have wished, a very young child having lost her life in a way that was both tragic and completely unintended.</p>

<p>'The Crown Prosecution Service has decided the right response to that tragedy is to charge Shirley Grenfell with two criminal offences.</p>

<p>'She was not taking a risk, she was making a mistake.She is not blameless her, far from it, but we are saying she is not guilty of these two offences.'</p>

<p>Grenfell, who is a mother-of-four and has 12 grandchildren, denies the charges and her trial continues.</p>
