<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jadon Sancho 'will fit in like a duck to water' alongside the likes of Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes, his former youth coach believes.</p>

<p>Louis Lancaster oversaw the England international's development while at Watford, before seeing him move on to Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund.</p>

<p>United appear in desperate need of reinforcements after a chastening start to their Premier League campaign saw them soundly beaten by Crystal Palace at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>However, the powers that be at Old Trafford have so far refused to meet the £100m asking price set out by the Bundesliga outfit. </p>

<p>Jadon Sancho will fit in seamlessly at Manchester United, according to his former youth coach</p>

<p>The haglling aside, having followed the 20-year-old's career since leaving Herfordshire, Lancaster believed Sancho can give United the jolt they need to kickstart their campaign.</p>

<p>'If Jadon was to go to Manchester United I think it would be a great move for him,' Lancaster told the Manchester Evening News.</p>

<p>'He would be going to play for a manager that has trust, if you look at some managers they don't trust that talent.</p>

<p>'Jadon will probably go to Manchester United but it will also be great for the Premier League, and it would be great for him because the club are structurally set up for success.</p>

<p>Louis Lancaster has backed Sancho to work alongside Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes </p>

<p>'The club have got a tremendous amount of history, they have got a great coaching staff and they have got players who will trust him.</p>

<p>'I think with his personality he will just fit in with Pogba, Fernandes, he will just fit in like a duck to water.</p>

<p>'If he goes there they are not just getting a great footballer but they are getting a mature 20-year-old.'</p>

<p>Sancho returned to action with Borussia Dortmund at the weekend, setting up the third and final goal in the 3-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach in the league. </p>
