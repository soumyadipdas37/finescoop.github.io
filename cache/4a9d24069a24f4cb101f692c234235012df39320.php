<p>Britain's Got Talent EXCLUSIVE: Ashley Banjo was left speechless as X1X crew performed a death-defying dance during their semi-final performance in scenes set to air on Saturday</p>

<p>Amanda Holden was also left aghast as the dance crew formed human pyramids of varying sizes as one member jumped on their backs before doing a kick flip.</p>

<p>The impressive jumps led to a synchronised dance number that culminated in several flips into the air and on the tall trampoline they had set up.</p>

<p>But that wasn't all, as one dancer began revving up a motorbike, before another crew member did a flip and landed onto the back of the vehicle with apparent ease. </p>

<p>Wow! Ashley looked in amazement as they performed death-defying tricks remotely from India</p>

<p>Ashley could be heard laughing in amazement over the trick, before he stood up and watched with a delighted smile on his face as another dancer did a flip from the tall trampoline and into the group below. </p>

<p>X1X were required to perform from India, as travel restrictions and quarantine measures meant they could not make the journey to the UK for the live shows. </p>

<p>The live shows - which typically air over the course of a week in late May and early June - were postponed in March due to the coronavirus crisis, with only the pre-recorded auditions able to air as planned. </p>

<p>Going for it: X1X also formed human pyramids of varying sizes as one member jumped on their backs before doing a kick flip</p>

<p>Giving it their all: The impressive jumps led to a synchronised dance number that culminated in several flips into the air and on the tall trampoline they had set up</p>

<p>On Thursday, OfCom announced they will not investigate Diversity's Black Lives Matter-inspired routine from Britain's Got Talent on September 5, despite viewer complaints soaring to 24,500 by last count that morning.</p>

<p>The performance has now become the second-most complained about television moment of the decade, but a spokesperson for the government-approved regulatory body has confirmed to MailOnline no action will be taken.  </p>

<p>The representative said: 'We carefully considered a large number of complaints about this artistic routine, an area where freedom of expression is particularly important. </p>

<p>Death-defying: But that wasn't all, as one dancer began revving up a motorbike, before another crew member did a flip and landed onto the back of the vehicle with apparent ease</p>

<p>Delighted: Amanda Holden was also left amazed by the troupe's performance</p>

<p>'Diversity's performance referred to challenging and potentially controversial subjects, and in our view, its central message was a call for social cohesion and unity. </p>

<p>'Any depictions of violence by the performers were highly stylised and symbolic of recent global events, and there was no explicit reference to any particular political organisation – but rather a message that the lives of black people matter.'</p>

<p>Troupe leader Ashley reacted to the news on Instagram as he shared the statement and penned: 'Creativity is always a leap of faith. All I did what was what felt right and I’d do it 100 times over... Sending love to everyone that stood by us'. </p>

<p>Britain’s Got Talent continues tonight at 20:00 on ITV.</p>
