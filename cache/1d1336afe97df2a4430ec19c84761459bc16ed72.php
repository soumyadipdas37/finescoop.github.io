<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australia has been plunged back into winter as extreme cold temperatures and wild weather brings snow across the country's south-east.</p>

<p>Thunder storms, hail and heavy snowfall was seen across Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia on Friday due to a cold front sweeping directly up from Antarctica.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Meteorology said the unusually chilly conditions will 'feel more like mid July than late September' with temperatures dropping to 10 degrees less than average.</p>

<p>Snow was seen falling in Ballarat in Victoria's Central Highlands along with Lismore which is just 200m above sea level.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in South Australia, residents near the Flinders Ranges woke to find their backyards blanketed in snow in Hallett, Belalie North, Canowie and Peterborough. </p>

<p>Heavy snowfall was seen in Tarcowie in South Australia on Friday morning following a night of wild weather</p>

<p>Weatherzone meteorologist Joel Pippard told Daily Mail Australia the front from Antarctica was bringing the ice cold air that usually wouldn't be seen.</p>

<p>'The cold front's going to leave a mark, it's definitely a winter-like weekend,' he said.</p>

<p>'It's going to be quite cold for a couple of days, Melbourne and Sydney won't heat up until around Tuesday.'</p>

<p>Tasmania's Cradle Mountain was hit with around 10-20cm of heavy snowfall while around 7cm fell in Oberon in NSW's Central Tablelands and 3cm in Orange.</p>

<p>Some South Australians were surrounded by such thick snowfall that one man was seen skiing outside his home.</p>

<p>'South Australia typically gets snow once every two to three years and we've already had it snow once there this year so it's pretty unusual,' Mr Pippard said.</p>

<p>'It will continue snowing all day and night over the Alps in Victoria and NSW.'</p>

<p>The weather forecaster said Canberra was also likely to see some snowfall throughout the night and into Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Melbourne was forecasted to reach just 12 degrees - meaning it was the coldest day in Spring since 2002.</p>

<p>Adelaide was also set to reach a top of 13 degrees on Friday - the city's coldest spring day since 1997. </p>

<p>Melbourne and Sydney will also be battered with thunderstorms late of Friday. </p>
