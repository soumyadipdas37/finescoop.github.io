<p>The 24-year-old was at United’s Carrington training complex on Wednesday morning to say his farewells to teammates and staff ahead of leaving on an initial loan with view to making the move permanent for £24.5million.</p>

<p>The Brazilian was reluctant to leave United but, following the arrival of Donny van de Beek from Ajax, competition for midfield places has become even fiercer.</p>

<p>Manchester United midfielder Andreas Pereira is set to travel to Lazio to complete a loan move</p>

<p>Since breaking into United’s first team in 2015, he has managed 75 appearances, scoring four goals, and was keen to gain more regular game time which he hopes to achieve with Lazio.</p>

<p>United’s squad flew to Brighton this morning though a number of regular first teamers were left behind including goalkeeper David de Gea.</p>

<p>Fringe players Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo were also at Carrington on Wednesday as they await news of any prospective moves.</p>

<p>The Brazilian wants more first team action after falling out of favour with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</p>

<p>Smalling who had been working alone on a double session training programme has been training again with the United squad but the club has still to find agreement with Roma over a fee despite talk of a renewed bid.</p>

<p>Rojo has had tentative interest from Turkey and back in Argentina but is no closer to leaving.</p>
