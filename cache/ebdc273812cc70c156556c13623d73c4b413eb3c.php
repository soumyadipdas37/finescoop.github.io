<p>Lean on me: The 55-year-old was seen with a blonde female friend as they ran errands</p>

<p>They stopped at Saks Fifth Avenue to drop off a package. </p>

<p>Fans have been in an uproar after DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that Dorinda was fired from the show. </p>

<p>The star was informed in August the network's decision to give her the ax, just two days after her good friend Jon Giswold passed away. </p>

<p>A black-and-white situation: Blue leggings and white jazz shoes with no laces rounded out her fashion choices</p>

<p>Her pal copied her style: Her pal had on a black hat that matched her shirt, with a beige cardigan and a cross necklace. She added black leggings and Chanel flats</p>

<p>Dorinda tried to get ahead of the news and took to her Instagram account to inform fans early in the morning that she wouldn't be returning to the show next year.</p>

<p>'It's a big mistake,' a production source exclusively tells DailyMail.com 'We're all surprised as even though she had a tough season, she is a fan favorite who people are rooting for.'  </p>

<p>'Dorinda was the only housewife left who owns both her own apartment in New York City alongside a second home in the country,' the insider added. 'You watch, this is an error that they will regret.'  </p>

<p>Medley took to Instagram to tell her followers the sad news that she was exiting the RHONY franchise with a smiling photo of herself with a black sparkly fan.</p>

<p>'What a journey this has been. I have laughed and cried and tried to Make it Nice... But all things must come to an end,' she began in the caption. </p>

<p>Time to go: Dorinda shared a post on social media in August to tell her fans she was leaving the show and was surprisingly upbeat in her caption, thanking both Bravo and NBC </p>

<p>'This was a great outlet for me to heal when my late husband Richard passed away,' she reflected in the caption. Her husband Richard H Medley died at age 60 in November 2011.</p>

<p>Keeping things surprisingly upbeat, the reality star continued: 'I have met so many interesting people and learned so much about myself, about life and about women along the way.</p>

<p>'Thank you to Bravo and NBC for the incredible ride and to my cast mates for constant stimulation and entertainment. I wish you all health, happiness and success.'</p>

<p>The Massachusetts native ended her message with a little inside joke for her Housewives fans, writing: 'Clip!' </p>

<p>What RHONY will be like without Dorinda's unique spark and sass in season 13, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>'Think about it, there will be no more Clip!, no more Bluestone Manor and no more voice of reason,' the production insider mused. 'How will the show celebrate the holidays without Dorinda?' </p>

<p>Adding: 'What are we going to do, follow Luann's virtual cabaret show next season?'  </p>

<p>Support: Former RHONY star Bethenny Frankel took to Instagram on Tuesday to show Dorinda a little love and support</p>

<p>Her former co-star, Bethenny Frankel (who departed the show last season) took to Instagram to show some love for Dorinda.</p>

<p>The 49-year-old mogul shared an image of the pair wearing shimmering dresses from last year's RHONY reunion with Andy Cohen. </p>

<p>'Every woman in this world wears a little sparkle, some in their dress, and some in their eyes,' Bethenny wrote in the caption. 'Use each moment to make another's eyes sparkle and to warm a heart.'</p>

<p>'Don't let anyone or anything dull your sparkle. Don't let the insecurities of others dull your sparkle. You will be missed...let the next chapter begin. #RHONY'</p>

<p>Shake-up: Dorinda is seen here with cast mates Luann de Lesseps, Sonja Morgan, Ramona Singer and Leah McSweeney</p>

<p>Dorinda has her back: Leah McSweeney thanked Dorinda for being there for her </p>

<p>'It's pretty s****y that she was told the day after her close friend Jon died,' the production source told DailyMail.com. Adding that the production company Shed Media and Bravo 'could've waited a week.'  </p>

<p>Medley officially joined the show in 2015 for the show's seventh season. </p>

<p>This current season - season 12 - has been a rough one for Dorinda as she has been feuding with her co-stars and she has been criticized for her drinking.  </p>

<p>The star has said she has been more vulnerable than ever, and it has taken a toll on her. </p>

<p>Heartbroken: The star was axed just days after she lost her best friend Jon Giswold </p>
