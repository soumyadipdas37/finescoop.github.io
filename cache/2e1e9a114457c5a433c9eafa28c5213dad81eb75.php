<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has promised that £40million signing Donny van de Beek is an important member of his squad after he caught the eye in their 3-0 win over Brighton in the Carabao Cup.</p>

<p>The Dutchman started just his second game in all competitions against the Seagulls but he has struggled to find his way into the line-up in the Premier League since joining from Ajax last month.</p>

<p>He scored on his club debut against Crystal Palace in the season opener as he came off the bench during the 3-1 defeat, and was sent on in stoppage time in their 3-2 win over Brighton on Saturday.</p>

<p>Donny van de Beek was impressive for Manchester United in their 3-0 win over Brighton </p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said the Dutchman was 'vital' to the team after he started the cup tie </p>

<p>His lack of game time prompted angry comments from his agent, who said he 'didn't like it at all', but now Solskjaer has lavished praise on the 23-year-old after his display - which saw him start as an attacking midfielder before moving to left wing - and believes he is 'vital' to the team. </p>

<p>'He's got very high footballing intelligence and tactically he's gone through the Ajax system. Dutch football is tactical, he knows football, he's got his head screwed on.' </p>

<p>'He's a different type of left-sided player compared to Dan James and Marcus Rashford but coming inside and finding good pockets, why not? He can play loads of different positions, which sometimes is a strength for a player.'</p>

<p>He grabbed an assist against the Seagulls as he caught the eye in the No 10 role at the Amex </p>

<p>Solskjaer admitted he was pleased with Van de Beek's versatility and said he would get more opportunities to shine in the near future. </p>

<p>'I remember myself sometimes, right-wing, left-wing, centre forward, No 10,' he added. 'Donny is one the coach will always look to have in a squad.' </p>

<p>'We know how many games we're going to play and he's going to be vital. </p>

<p>'He's proved in every game he's been a part of that he's got high quality, he's such a clever mover, he plays the game simply but effectively, with high quality. He's knocking on the door.'</p>

<p>United cruised into the next round of the Carabao Cup as Paul Pogba wrapped up the victory </p>

<p>In United's second game against Brighton in the space of a few days, the Red Devils secured back-to-back victories after a dramatic 3-2 win on Saturday assisted by VAR after the final whistle. </p>

<p>On Wednesday it was more comfortable for Solskjaer's men as Scott McTominay opened the scoring before Juan Mata and Paul Pogba wrapped up a routine win.</p>

<p>The team face a huge game against Tottenham at Old Trafford this Sunday which should set the tone for the early race for the Champions League spots. </p>
