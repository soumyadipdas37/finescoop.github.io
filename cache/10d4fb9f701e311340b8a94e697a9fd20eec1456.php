<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Enrique has jumped to the defence of under-pressure Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old has received a considerable amount of criticism after making some high-profile errors for United.</p>

<p>However, he was in inspired form during Spain's 1-1 draw against Germany in the Nations League on Thursday as he made some impressive stops, including one to thwart Leroy Sane. </p>

<p>Luis Enrique has praised David de Gea after the goalkeeper impressed for Spain on Thursday</p>

<p>Enrique stressed that de Gea deserves more praise and said that Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is in a similar situation with regards to the intense scrutiny of his performances.</p>

<p>'He [De Gea] has played a lot of games like this in England,' Enrique said, as reported by Marca.</p>

<p>'We monitor him exhaustively, but he and Kepa are in the news if they make a mistake. They're used to it.</p>

<p>'With the game he's played we should be saying what a great goalkeeper we have.</p>

<p>'I'll encourage them to not fall apart and it's a position that I demand a lot from.</p>

<p>'But because the press give them such a hard time, I treat them more affectionately.</p>

<p>'They both know that their mistakes are more noticeable than those of other players, but they're used to it.'</p>

<p>Enrique said that some of the criticism the Manchester United goalkeeper gets is unwarranted </p>

<p>De Gea, who made some excellent stops, faces a battle to retain his place as United's No 1</p>

<p>De Gea faces a battle to retain his place as United's first-choice goalkeeper next season, with Dean Henderson back from his loan spell at Sheffield United.</p>

<p>The highly-regarded Henderson has signed a new contract at United but stressed that he won't be willing to be back-up to de Gea.</p>

<p>Spain are back in action on Sunday when they host Ukraine in another Nations League clash, and de Gea will be hoping to make a major impact again.</p>

<p>The attention will then turn to the intriguing goalkeeping situation at United, but de Gea demonstrated for Spain that he is still capable of producing impressive performances.</p>

<p>Former United defender Gary Neville believes de Gea will commence the season as United's first-choice shot-stopper.</p>

<p>Neville told Sky Sports: 'De Gea definitely starts as No.1 because there was a point where Ole could've dropped him towards the end of the season.</p>

<p>'However, he stuck with him at that point and we are only around four weeks later.'</p>
