<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Oscar-winning actor Sir Mark Rylance has said Johnny Depp's denial of abuse against his ex-wife is 'completely believable.'</p>

<p>Sir Mark told The Times that the accusations made by Amber Heard against Depp were not consistent with the Pirates of the Caribbean star's 'character.'</p>

<p>Depp, 57, is awaiting the High Court's judgment in a libel action against The Sun newspaper for an article which labelled him 'a wife beater.'</p>

<p>Heard, 34, who met Depp during filming of The Rum Diary in 2011, told the court that her former husband had subjected her to a campaign of abuse.</p>

<p>Depp denies the claims and says his ex-wife was violent towards him.</p>

<p>Sir Mark Rylance and Johnny Depp pose during a photocall to present the movie Waiting for the Barbarians during the 45th Deauville US Film Festival, on September 8, 2019 in Deauville, France</p>

<p>Sir Mark, 60, who is starring alongside Depp in new movie Waiting for the Barbarians, told The Times: 'My impression of him was a very loving, and very sensitive and very trustworthy person.'</p>

<p>He added that Depp was 'intensely, intensely, shy.'</p>

<p>'The accusations that were around at the time we were making the film were of physical violence,' Rylance told the paper.</p>

<p>'And he obviously denied this and I found his denial completely believable. It didn't seem to be part of his character at all.'</p>

<p>Rylance plays a magistrate in an unnamed colonial outpost seeking an easy retirement in the film adaptation of JM Coetzee's 1980 novel of the same name.</p>

<p>He begins to question where his loyalties truly lie with the arrival of the sinister Colonel Joll, played by Depp.</p>

<p>Amber Heard, 34, leaves the High Court in London, Britain July 28, 2020</p>

<p>Earlier this week Rylance told the Radio Times: 'With these stars, you read things, you hear things and I wasn't sure what it would be like, whether he would be vain, or shattered, or broken by the things that he's gone through. But it wasn't like that at all. </p>

<p>'I've never, ever heard him say a bad word about anyone. All his stories are loving and amusing.'</p>

<p>Depp, who gave days of vivid evidence at the High Court in July, is already suing Heard for $50 million in the US over a column that she wrote for the Washington Post in December 2018.</p>

<p>While the article did not mention Depp by name, Heard described herself as 'a public figure representing domestic abuse' – which his lawyers argue had the effect of falsely portraying him as violent.</p>
