<p>Pensioners Alun, 67, and Elaine Rees, 63, left viewers in hysterics last week after appearing on the show and telling off presenter Piers, 55, for speaking over co-host Susannah Reid. </p>

<p>'It’s going up on my bedroom wall,' she replied,'It is yeah.'</p>

<p>When quizzed on the huge reaction to their last interview, Elaine said: 'To be honest, I started at the top didn’t I so I didn’t want to give any more interviews because you can’t beat the best can you.' </p>

<p>Viewers quickly took to Twitter to praise the couple, with one writing: 'Alun and Elaine brightening up my morning again'.</p>

<p>'Made me smile inside and out! What lovely people', said another. </p>

<p>A third wrote: 'Alun and Elaine, I want them to be my nana and grandad #goodmorningbritain'. </p>

<p>The couple told last week on the show they were unaware that their TV had been leaving their neighbours with poor broadband connectivity every morning at 7am in Powys village of Aberhosan, Wales</p>

<p>The retired couple explained last week that their old £30 TV set, which is in their bedroom, was turned on every morning to watch Good Morning Britain. </p>

<p>Elaine, who loves to watch Piers Morgan in the morning because he 'makes her laugh', was crocheting a blanket throughout the interview and showed off another she had crocheted over the back of the sofa behind them. </p>

<p>The retired couple and GMB super fans explained last week that their old £30 TV set, which is in their bedroom, was turned on every morning to watch Good Morning Britain</p>

<p>She explained that, while retired farmer Alun is driving his tractor, she sits in the back and crochets. </p>

<p>Elaine added: 'We’ve got a camper van that we actually made up ourselves and I do sit in the passenger seat crocheting when Alun is driving the camper van.' </p>

<p>When Piers asked Elaine when he makes her cross, Elaine told him it was when he wouldn't let co-host Susanna talk, to which Susanna responded with a round of applause. </p>

<p>Piers said: 'By the way, pretty rich coming from you given Alun doesn't talk either. I haven't seen him get a word in.'  </p>
