<p>'For Comey, justice is bigger, truth is bigger than anything else, and the FBI is bigger than he is, and on the other side. </p>

<p>'Trump thinks the biggest thing in the world is himself, and doesn't think about anything past the end of his nose,' he said. </p>

<p>He told the paper: 'I think Americans need to put their phones down and they need to get educated. </p>

<p>'My optimism tells me that because of the last three-and-a-half years, we know a hell of a lot more about Trump than we did back in 2016. </p>
