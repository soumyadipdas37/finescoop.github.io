<p>The operator manager of the UK's oldest chat line, Datapro Services, told Air Mail that there was an influx in 'teachers, nurses and solicitors' who were interested in joining the company while their day jobs were on hold, or not paying as much. </p>

<p>Identified only as Gayle, 52, the expert explained there was also an increase in the number of lonely callers looking for some company when their face-to-face socialising dried up.  </p>

<p>'We've had a huge amount of women wanting to join to earn some extra cash,' she said in an interview with the online publication. 'Teachers, nurses, solicitors, you name it, they've all shown interest.' </p>

<p>She continued: 'A lot of girls feel like they're doing a public service by chatting to them [the lonely callers].'</p>

<p>The company has also had its fair share of lockdown mishaps with wives and children walking in halfway through a call. </p>

<p>Gayle explained that in order to be successful, a woman needs to be an 'actress' who can quickly adapt to the needs and desires of the person on the other end of the line. </p>

<p>She added: 'It’s all about the voice you choose. This is your chance to perform, so think about how you use it — the tone, the speed, the volume.' </p>

<p>It comes after research showed the number of people engaging in phone sex has soared since the start of lockdown, when couples found themselves spending weeks apart due to social distancing rules. </p>

<p>A survey revealed there has been an overall increase of 23 per cent compared to pre-lockdown levels. </p>

<p>The practice, which sees couple arouse each other using voice alone, has seen the biggest increase in popularity in Belfast and Sheffield, according to the research by Vivastreet. </p>

<p>One US-based chatline veteran said she anticipated phone sex remaining popular even once Covid-19 restrictions have ended because younger generations are more comfortable with their sexuality and are open to exploring. </p>

<p>Cidney Green, 30, who once earned $150,000 a year working as an operator, now offers courses to women who dream of becoming an operator themselves. </p>

<p>She added: 'The next generation are fluid in their sexuality, and they don’t have an attachment to how they do it. Phone sex is part of that movement.'</p>

<p>Other anecdotal reports suggest millennials feel 'safer' doing phone sex as opposed to video chats or sexting because there is less of a risk that the interaction will be saved and re-shared at a later date.  </p>
