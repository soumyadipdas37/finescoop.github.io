<p>The million milestone comes for The Trust at a time when the deepening jobs crisis is hitting young people the hardest. </p>

<p>The employability and enterprise courses offered by The Trust, which are run both in person and online, give young people the practical and financial support needed to stabilise their lives.</p>

<p>It comes as The Prince of Wales warned that as many as one million young people could  need 'urgent help' due to coronavirus.</p>

<p>He said our youth was confronting a 'uniquely challenging' time amid the uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In a rare intervention, Charles said the 'destructive hopelessness' of unemployment is facing Britain's youngsters once again.</p>

<p>Writing in The Sunday Telegraph yesterday,  he said the young are in particular need of measures to protect them from the worst effects of the crisis, adding that the country must not let optimism 'drown beneath a deluge' of economic predictions. </p>

<p>Reflecting on how he founded the Prince's Trust charity in 1976, with the severance pay he got from the Royal Navy, Charles added: 'I am old enough to remember other times when hope was scarce and pessimism seemed the only thing in abundant supply.</p>

<p>'In the mid-Seventies, when I left the Royal Navy, youth unemployment was one of the pressing issues of the time. It seemed to me that we should do something to try to make a difference, however small.'</p>

<p>The Prince's Trust, has just helped its millionth young person, with research from the Trust showing that 55 per cent of 16 to 25-year-olds are more worried about being unemployed than they were a year ago.</p>

<p>The Prince's Trust set up the Young People Relief Fund in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic to provide extra support to those hit by the economic fall-out. </p>
