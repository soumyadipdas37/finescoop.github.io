<p>Abs-olutely amazing: Katie Waissel showed off the results of her hard work during an energetic run in London on Wednesday</p>

<p>Katie further highlighted her toned figure and teamed the item of clothing with mint green gym leggings. </p>

<p>The singer styled her brunette locks into a relaxed bun and appeared to go makeup-free for her outdoor workout.</p>

<p>Katie appeared determined and focused as she performed a series of stretches while listening to music on her AirPods.</p>

<p>Just last month, the Celebrity Big Brother star told Closer  that she wants baby number two to have the same DNA as her son Hudson, two, who she shares with her fitness trainer ex Andy Speer. </p>

<p>Toned: The 34-year-old former X Factor star displayed her washboard abs in a tiny white crop top</p>

<p>She said: 'I would love to have another baby, but I would like them to be Hudson's full DNA. Andy and I have joked about it many times and I've said to just FedEx it over.' </p>

<p>Andy lives in America and Katie moved back to the UK after the split and she admitted it's taken time for herself and Andy to be amicable again.   </p>

<p>Katie overhauled her lifestyle after giving birth and dropped two stone after adopting an intense exercise plan and is at a healthy BMI for her weight.  </p>

<p>But she said her transformation has led cruel trolls to comment on her appearance. </p>

<p>She said: 'The amount of people who were commenting about my body, saying things like "you look too skinny, you look old, you look like a man, you've got no boobs", it was horrible.  </p>

<p>'But this is my body, I'm not surgically enhanced. I've not injected fat into my thighs or bum and boobs... but I'm so proud of my body - it grew my son and I'm proud of my four-inch long nipples because they breastfed my son for a year.' </p>

<p>Katie said she is ready to meet someone new after an unlucky time in her private life. </p>

<p>She has been married twice before, to model Brad Alphonso in 2012 and to comedian Brian Moote in 2015. </p>
