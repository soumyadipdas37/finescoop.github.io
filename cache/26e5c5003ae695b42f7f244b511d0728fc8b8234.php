<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A super organised mother has divided the internet after revealing her simple money-saving trick for her family trip away.</p>

<p>The thrifty mother, from New South Wales, said she wanted to surprise her three young sons with a mini weekend getaway so she decided to pre-package all their snacks to help her save time and money. </p>

<p>The goodie bags are filled a selection of yoghurt, chips, bananas, apple, yoghurt, rice crackers, sultanas, and more.</p>

<p>'We are surprising our boys with a weekend away so today I organised a bag each for each day we are away,' she wrote in a Facebook group. </p>

<p>'I love that I won't have to worry about packing food each morning or buying snacks every two minutes (my boys eat a lot).'</p>

<p>A super organised mother has revealed her simple money-saving trick for her family trip away. She decided to pre-package all their snacks to help her save time and money</p>

<p>Besides what's pictured in the snaps, the mother said she will also back an array of fruits and yoghurt, which is 'enough snacks for the whole day'.</p>

<p>'It's going to make my weekend so much easier and cheaper,' she said.</p>

<p>The mother also praised a fellow parent for sharing the idea on social media earlier this week after she was looking for ideas on how to save money on her family trip.</p>

<p>Dozens of mothers said it's a 'great idea', with many saying they do the same thing for their children when they go away on holiday.</p>

<p>'Yep this is what I always do, even did it for our trip overseas as I didn't know if the kids would eat foreign food and they always need snacks when out and about,' one mother said.</p>

<p>However, some weren't on board with the idea, saying the mother should 'enjoy' her family trip, while others suggested the the sandwich bags were a 'waste of plastic'.</p>

<p>'Great idea. Even better if you could do it without all the extra plastic bags,' one said. </p>

<p>She wanted to surprise her three young sons with a mini weekend getaway so she decided to pre-package all their snacks to help her save time and money</p>

<p>But many quickly pointed out the bags are easily reusable and recyclable.</p>

<p>'These giant snap bags are totally reusable and I think they fit the bill, use it every day on a holiday. What a cool mum,' one said, while another added: 'I have children trained to make sure they bring their bag back and I use it again and again.' </p>

<p>Other mothers who have made pre-packaged snacks for their kids shared humourous stories. </p>

<p>'I used to do this then find five bags under their beds on a weekend. God I love them,' one wrote.</p>

<p>And a second woman said as she laughed: 'I love the idea and I've tried it myself but my kids eat everything in their lunchbox/snack bag within like an hour. </p>

<p>'It doesn't matter how much I pack, they are "starving" because they know I've got the snack packs/lunchboxes with food. They don't rest until they have eaten it all and then whinge when there's nothing left and they are hungry.'</p>
