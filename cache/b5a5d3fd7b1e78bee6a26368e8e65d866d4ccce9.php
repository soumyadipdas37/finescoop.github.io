<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They met in 2018, but only went public with their romance on Thursday. </p>

<p>And, Charles Dance, 73, cosied up to Alessandra Masi, 53, on Saturday, at a promotional event for their new film The Book Of Vision, during the 77th Venice Film Festival.</p>

<p>The actor wrapped an arm around his Italian film producer girlfriend - who was the unit production manager on the movie - as the couple posed for loved-up snaps while on the beach in front of the Hotel Excelsior.  </p>

<p>Happy couple: Charles Dance, 73, cosied up to Alessandra Masi, 53, on Saturday, at a promotional event for their new film The Book Of Vision, during the 77th Venice Film Festival</p>

<p>Charles kept things casual in a grey short sleeved shirt which he left partially unbuttoned. </p>

<p>Alessandra meanwhile nailed boho chic in a scarf print red halterneck, with her blonde tresses left to hang loose in soft waves.</p>

<p>The couple met in 2018 when he acted in art movie The Book Of Vision, while Alessandra was the unit production manager for the film. </p>

<p>Since going public with their relationship, the pair have packed on the PDA with passionate kisses and hand-in-hand sunshine strolls.  </p>

<p>Cute! The actor wrapped an arm around his Italian film producer girlfriend - who was the unit production manager on the movie - as the couple posed for loved-up snaps</p>

<p>Perhaps significantly, Alessandra has been hired to work on his next film The Inn At The Edge of the World.</p>

<p>The movie is an adaptation of the Alice Thomas Ellis book about an unrelated group who answer an advert and go to a remote Scottish island to escape Christmas.</p>

<p>The Game Of Thrones actor will direct as well as star in that film, alongside Joanna Lumley and Freddie Fox.   </p>

<p>A friend of his confirmed that he had recently mentioned a 'new Italian girlfriend', although there was no response from his agents on Thursday.</p>

<p>Movie: The couple met in 2018 when he acted in art movie The Book Of Vision, which opened at the Venice film festival on Thursday (Charles pictured with the cast)</p>

<p>Alessandra, who comes from Bologna, has a degree in film from Bologna University and has been working in the movies for nearly three decades.</p>

<p>In an interview last year Dance – who plays Lord Mountbatten in The Crown – said the end of his marriage to Joanna Haythorn had been a matter of great sadness. </p>

<p>'I regret that the marriage ended; it was largely my fault. But sensibly, we're now the best of friends,' he said.  </p>

<p>He told another interviewer that he had not been 'the greatest husband in the world' to Jo, whom he met when he was 19. </p>

<p>Before their split was announced he was linked to actress Emilia Fox. Then came a relationship with actress Sophia Myles, 33 years his junior; they dated from 2003 to 2005.</p>

<p>Next he dated model Shambhala Marthe, 26 years his junior, whom he met in a fruit and veg market. </p>

<p>She was succeeded in his affections by painter Eleanor Boorman, by whom he had a daughter, Rose, when he was 65. Miss Boorman is 25 years his junior and they split in 2012 soon after the baby arrived.</p>

<p>He told an interviewer in 2019 that he likes 'beautiful women' and added: 'I like independence, I like strong women, women who survive and thrive in what is still a male-dominated world in most professions. I think that description fits my ex-wife and my former fiancee, Eleanor.'</p>
