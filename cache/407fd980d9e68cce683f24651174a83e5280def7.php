<p>A British tourist fell to his death after trying to climb from one window to another at a seven-storey hostel in Istanbul </p>

<p>Onlookers watched the topless Briton fall to his death on Hacimimi Mahallesi Karabas Street in the district of Beyoglu, on the European side of Istanbul. </p>

<p>He was seen clinging to one of the top-floor window sills while apparently trying to edge his way over to the next window. </p>

<p>While shifting his body weight to the adjacent window, he lost his balance and fell out of sight. </p>

<p>According to Turkish media, he died at the scene and police have since opened an investigation.  </p>

<p>Three people, two of them women, have reportedly been questioned by Turkish police after McDowall's death.  </p>
