<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The signing of an elite goalkeeper is a landmark moment in any manager's tenure at a major club. Frank Lampard needs the impending arrival of Edouard Mendy to be exactly that for his reign at Chelsea.</p>

<p>After another error from Kepa Arrizabalaga in Chelsea's 3-1 win over Brighton, Gary Neville warned that, for all Lampard's eye-catching spending this summer, a failure to sign a commanding No 1 could eventually be his downfall.</p>

<p>'A few years ago it was seen I was targeting (Loris) Karius,' Neville said in his Sky Sports analysis. 'Liverpool were being prevented from being a championship winning team from not having a goalkeeper. Lampard knows he will be sacked in the next two or three years if he doesn't win the league. He's got to be ruthless.'</p>

<p>Chelsea are expected to soon confirm the signing of goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Rennes</p>

<p>Kepa produced an unconvincing display in Chelsea's 3-1 victory at Brighton on Monday</p>

<p>Frank Lampard, the Chelsea manager, has had reservations over the £70m goalkeeper</p>

<p>Of course, Jurgen Klopp soon moved for Alisson and Liverpool have won the Champions League and the Premier League with the Brazilian between the sticks. At Manchester City, Pep Guardiola replaced Claudio Bravo with Ederson, accepting that the man who had served him so valiantly at Barcelona was unable to fully adapt to the Premier League.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old Mendy is expected to arrive at Stamford Bridge in a £25m deal and demote Kepa, a £72m signing on a seven-year contract back in 2018, to the bench.</p>

<p>But just how does he compare to Kepa? And is he as good as Alisson and Ederson and Liverpool and City - the two clubs Lampard is in hot pursuit of?</p>

<p>Mendy only joined Rennes last year, joining from Reims but he helped the club reach third in Ligue 1 last season. His stats across the course of that campaign, and one match so far this season, suggest he will be an upgrade to Kepa. </p>

<p>Mendy has played 34 times for Rennes in all competitions since joining in 2019 and in that same timespan up to now, Kepa has clocked 42 appearances. And depsite playing eight less games, Mendy has 12 clean sheets compared to Kepa's 10.</p>

<p>He also has a dramatically better goals conceded record - 32 goals have gone in against Mendy compared to 59 against Kepa.</p>

<p>Gary Neville said that, in the long term, Lampard's job could be at risk without a top keeper</p>

<p>Alisson's arrival at Liverpool propelled them to Champions League and Premier League glory</p>

<p>Ederson's arrival at Manchester City has proven hugely important in their push for silverware</p>

<p>Mendy's save percentage is higher - 69.8 per cent compared to 58.5 - and he has only conceded five goals from outside the box. Kepa comes in at 12 and counting - something Neville and Carragher alluded to on Sky Sports. In all Kepa's time in England, he has conceded 19 goals from long range.</p>

<p>The one notable aspect where Mendy trails Kepa is in pass completion. Of the 836 passes, he has a completion rate of 71.6 per cent. Kepa has made 1,190 passes with a completion rate of 76.7 per cent. This, of course, is also a reflection upon tactics at each side - Kepa is encouraged to play the ball out with his feet more than Mendy at Rennes.</p>

<p>And playing out from the back is something synonymous with Alisson and Ederson. The Liverpool No 1's passing accuracy is 84.8 per cent and Ederson is 84.4. </p>

<p>They both rise above Mendy in terms of clean sheets - Ederson has 18 and Alisson 15 compared to Mendy's 12. </p>

<p>Mendy is close to the duo on save percentage. He is only 0.1 per cent behind Ederson, who is on 69.9 per cent while Alisson is on 71.8.</p>

<p>But Mendy has conceded less than both Ederson and Alisson - his tally of 32 beats Alisson's 33 and Ederson's 37, albeit in less appearances than the Brazilian duo who are set to become his more immediate rivals.</p>

<p>So there is definite reason for optimism among Chelsea fans at the prospect of Mendy joining. The weakest part of Chelsea's squad is the goalkeeping area and at present, a Mendy-less Chelsea squad looks rather top-heavy. </p>

<p>For the balance of Lampard's side, he will be an astute addition. And his presence, combined with Thiago Silva's impending introduction to the heart of the defence, could add some much needed steel to Chelsea's team across the course of a season.</p>

<p>Chelsea have many reasons to look forward to Mendy's arrival - he'll add steel to their defence</p>
