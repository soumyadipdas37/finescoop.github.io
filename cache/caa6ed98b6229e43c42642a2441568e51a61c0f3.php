<p>Cunningham ended up hitting the ground hard and stayed down</p>

<p>Cunningham was seen lying face down on the turf at Heinz Field for nearly 10 minutes, as emergency medical staff removed his jersey and pads before strapping him to a backboard.    </p>

<p>He was eventually rolled over onto his back. As he was being taken off the field, Cunningham gave a 'thumbs up' to fans as he left. </p>

<p>'That's the soldier mentality in him. He gave it his all and he got twisted up. He put his thumb up to let us know he was good so we are going to get back and get better,' running back Javian Hawkins said to the Courier Journal. </p>

<p>Early indications are that Cunningham was expected to make a full recovery according to AL.com. </p>

<p>The Louisville Cardinals later tweeted in support of their player: 'He's a fighter. #3 with the thumbs up.'   </p>

<p>The head coach Scott Satterfield did not describe the exact nature of Cunningham's injury but noted that he was moving all of his limbs while on the ground. </p>

<p>'He stepped up on that play. They had some pass rushers there, and it looked like he got his feet caught up under a couple of their defenders. He got twisted a little bit,' Satterfield said.</p>

<p>'It looks like he's going to be fine,' he continued. 'I don't want to speculate. Obviously they are doing everything precautionary, but he was moving everything. </p>

<p>'The medical team takes every precaution. That's why they took him in to further evaluate him. I have not gotten an update on that, so anything else would be speculation. He did have feeling in his body and his extremities, so that's positive.'</p>
