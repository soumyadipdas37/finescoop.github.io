<p>'I went through the fitting process with Chad - he had a lot of changes,' she said. 'Thurgood Marshall was very dapper in his young days, so we dressed him really dapper. He was a lot of fun. But I understood from our fitting that he really did want to come together on this and understand the period, understand what his role was.'</p>

<p>Carter, who has also worked on films such as Selma, Dolemite Is My Name and the upcoming Coming 2 America, reflected on the day that she fitted the actor for with the ensemble he would wear as King T’Challa in the 2018 blockbuster.</p>

<p>'I had the pants suit in my office and it was dressed on a mannequin, and I thought, this thing doesn't look all that great, partly because the mannequin was weird,' Carter said. 'I called Chadwick in and I asked him to put the suit on - we needed to see if there were any problems or anything - and when he put on the suit and the helmet went on, it was like magic.</p>

<p>'I could see the power of these superheroes. I could see how they have an effect on people just because it's like they are a superhero.'</p>
