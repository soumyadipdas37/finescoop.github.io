<p>Stephanie Christacos, who helped organize the event, told WUSA 9 that their Great American Boat Parade was meant to create excitement around Trump's 2020 bid.</p>

<p>'It's all grassroots, I'm just a mom,' said Christacos. 'I love our country, and I want to be safe. And I believe that's President Donald Trump.'</p>

<p>The boat party, or the 'Trumptilla', began the journey from the Old Dominion Boat Club in Alexandria and then headed for the Memorial bridge.</p>

<p>The organizers, including Carole Berman, said the President has their unwavering support in spite of the anti-military statements her reportedly made about veterans or polls that label Biden the front runner.</p>

<p>'I've never been polled. I've never been polled. I've never been. I don't believe in the polls and I don't think most people do,' they said.</p>

<p>More importantly, Christakos said, people need to get out and vote for the November election.</p>

<p>'Everybody has to get out to vote. Get out to vote, do not sit home,' she added.</p>

<p> One participant, Art Barletta, told WUSA 9 that he voted for Republicans in 2016 and felt is was important to show support for the party. </p>

<p>He admitted, however, that Trump had not made good on all his promises.</p>

<p>'Campaign promises never come to reality all the time,' said Barletta, who added that he still believed Trump should get a second term.</p>

<p>'He needs to unite the country. He needs to get equality for everybody. He needs to get equality for everybody that's not been born yet,' said Barletta. </p>

<p>Hundreds of Trump supporters sailing through the waters were also spotted at Pennsylvania's Lake Erie.</p>

<p>'It just shows a lot of love for America's values and our love for our president and our support,' said Adam Stanzzyk, a person who attended on Sunday.</p>

<p>According to Your Erie, this particular event was organized by a 19-year-old student from Gannon University who wished to stay anonymous due to death threats.</p>

<p>One person visiting Lake Eria said the amount of boats sailing was shockig.</p>

<p>'Seventy five boats more boats have shown up and I think about 95% of them have Trump flags on them so that's pretty cool. Great show of support for our president. There really is a silent majority out here,' said Mark Webb.</p>

<p>Erie County Councilman Brian Shank, a local conservative politician, welcomed Trump supporters and others to the event.</p>

<p>Shank: 'Put a thing on Facebook and said hey we got a boat parade coming in we want to come out and show our support for the folks out on the water'</p>

<p>'So we got together a couple of friends. It's a beautiful day and is what freedom is all about.'</p>

<p>A small group of counter-protesters arrived to the event, resulting in a back and forth with Trump supporters. </p>

<p>Shank said that the difference in opinion is what makes the country great.</p>

<p>'That's what makes America great. We're allowed to have a difference of opinion.'</p>

<p>A Great American Boat Parade was also held near the Owensboro Riverfront of the Ohio River.</p>

<p>Those organizers said that in addition to supporting Trump, the event allowed Indiana and Kentucky boaters social time during the pandemic.  </p>
