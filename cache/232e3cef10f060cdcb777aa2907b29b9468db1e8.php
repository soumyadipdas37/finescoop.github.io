<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool have boosted ahead of their Premier League showdown with Arsenal as goalkeeper Alisson has passed a late fitness test. </p>

<p>However, marquee signing Thiago Alcantara misses out for the clash at Anfield - as the Reds look to continue their perfect start to the season against the Gunners, who also have a 100 per cent record in this campaign so far. </p>

<p>Both players were serious doubts before the match as they missed the Premier League champions' training sessions over the weekend, though they did took late fitness tests on Monday.</p>

<p>Alisson (middle) was vital in Liverpool's win over Chelsea last week, saving a crucial penalty</p>

<p>Both Alisson and Thiago were crucial in Liverpool's important 2-0 win over Chelsea last weekend. The former saved a second-half penalty from Jorginho to keep his first clean sheet of the new season. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Thiago outpassed every Blues player in the second period of the match at Stamford Bridge - even though he only played 45 minutes. </p>

<p>Klopp already had midfielders Jordan Henderson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ruled out of the Arsenal match, with the Liverpool captain injuring himself in the Chelsea match last weekend. </p>

<p>Thiago's Reds debut against Chelsea saw him make more passes than all of his opponents</p>

<p>But Joe Gomez has returned for Liverpool after missing the Chelsea game, meaning Fabinho returns to midfield alongside Gini Wijnaldum and Naby Keita.  </p>

<p>Ahead of Monday night's showdown on Merseyside, Liverpool and Arsenal are the only two teams out of the 'Big Six' to have not dropped league points this season. </p>

<p>The Reds have started their Premier League title defence with wins over Leeds United and Chelsea, while Arsenal have beaten London rivals Fulham and West Ham in the build-up to the Liverpool fixture. </p>

<p>The north Londoners have also won their last two matches against Liverpool - a 2-1 league victory at the Emirates Stadium in July before beating Klopp's side in the Community Shield on penalties last month. </p>

<p>Liverpool XI: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Keita, Mane, Salah, Firmino </p>

<p>Arsenal XI: Leno, Holding, David Luiz, Tierney, Bellerin, Elneny, Xhaka, Maitland-Niles, Willian, Lacazette, Aubameyang </p>
