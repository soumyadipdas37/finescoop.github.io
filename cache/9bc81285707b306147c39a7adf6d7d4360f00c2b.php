<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Andy Cohen doesn't think Kris Jenner would ever be interested in doing The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>Legions of fans asked for the reality king's thoughts after Jenner and her daughters announced the end of their E! hit Keeping Up With The Kardashians on Tuesday.</p>

<p>And while the Bravo icon said he'd love to see Kris in the mix, he told his SiriusXM show listeners he couldn't see why the millionaire momager would go from executive producer and head honcho to 'join a show that she has no control over.'</p>

<p>'I can't see her surrendering that power,' the 52-year-old father-of-one dished. </p>

<p>Who's the boss? Bravo king Andy Cohen said that while he'd love to see Kris Jenner join The Real Housewives he can't see her joining a show 'she has no control over'</p>

<p>Jenner has been one of Keeping Up With The Kardashians' executive producers since its debut in 2007.</p>

<p>Andy was wowed at the range of reactions, telling listeners: 'I got so many DMs and tweets saying Kris should join the Housewives she is good friends with Kyle [Richards], this should happen, make it happen.'</p>

<p>'Then I tweeted that I would be talking about it on the radio today and I got a whole bunch of tweets saying don't do it,' he went on. 'It's so interesting to me.'</p>

<p>Andy focused on the positives saying Kris would be a great addition because of her connections with longtime friend and castmember Kyle Richards, as well as Lisa Rinna. She also briefly appeared on the show during a charity gala on season 10.</p>

<p>'I think it would be a huge get too and by the way she is already connected with the cast,' Cohen said. 'She knows, she's good buddies with Kyle no joke, she knows everyone on the show. She is buddies with Rinna I think.'</p>

<p>Not that type: 'I can't see her surrendering that power,' the 52-year-old father-of-one dished. Kris and the family are seen at the 2019 Met Gala above</p>

<p>Connected: Andy focused on the positives saying Kris would be a great addition because of her connections with longtime friend and castmember Kyle Richards, as well as Lisa Rinna, together in a 2019 SKIMS ad above</p>

<p>Not realistic: 'I don't think she would do it,' he said. 'She is leaving a show for which she has total control over. Why would she leave and join a show that she has no control over?'</p>

<p>But Andy admitted it would be hard for Kris to give up the 'control' she has as an executive producer on KUWTK. </p>

<p>'I don't think she would do it,' he said. 'She is leaving a show for which she has total control over. Why would she leave and join a show that she has no control over?'</p>

<p>'She wouldn't be an executive producer of the show, she wouldn't have control over the edits so I think for someone who is used to having so much power over a show, I can't see her surrendering that power,' he continued. </p>

<p>'It would be a huge get, I really don't think she would do it…I don't think she would do it as a friend.'</p>

<p>But Kris may still be mulling over her options, according to insiders who spoke to People. </p>

<p>'Kris seems intrigued by the show and hasn't dismissed joining it,' they dished. </p>

<p>Ready for her spotlight? Kris may still be mulling over her options, according to insiders at People who said 'Kris seems intrigued by the show and hasn't dismissed joining it'</p>
