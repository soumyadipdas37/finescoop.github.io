<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A car dealer who sold death-trap second-hand vehicles tried to stop customers getting justice after he was sued, a Daily Mail investigation can reveal.</p>

<p>Ahmed Alwaheeb's firms sold cars riddled with faults – and which sometimes had government recall notices that required manufacturers to fix safety issues – but refused to refund customers.</p>

<p>However, when they took legal action, his Surrey firm tried to stop cases going to court by submitting fake documents, a judge was told. </p>

<p>Ahmed Alwaheeb's (pictured) firms sold cars riddled with faults – and which sometimes had government recall notices that required manufacturers to fix safety issues – but refused to refund customers</p>

<p>Representatives for Alwaheeb's company sent courts bogus papers supposedly signed by the buyer saying they had accepted a payout and would drop legal action.</p>

<p>But victims knew nothing about the documents and had not received a penny, despite being thousands of pounds out of pocket after being refused refunds.</p>

<p>A Mail investigation found that:</p>

<p>Customer Iain Ross, 39, said just a couple of hours after buying a Volvo XC70 from Alwaheeb's parent company, Crown Motor Direct, which trades as EMC Car Sales and Chobham Central Garage, the dashboard 'lit up like a Christmas tree' to show an array of faults.</p>

<p>When the furniture installer took it to a garage after returning to his home in Aberdeen, mechanics found it had serious defects, including a dangerous problem with the brakes. </p>

<p>Customer Iain Ross, 39, (pictured) said just a couple of hours after buying a Volvo XC70 from Alwaheeb's parent company, Crown Motor Direct, the dashboard 'lit up like a Christmas tree' to show an array of faults</p>

<p>After Crown Motor Direct refused compensation, Mr Ross began a civil claim at North Shields County Court against the firm and Alwaheeb.</p>

<p>But after becoming concerned about the lack of progress, he contacted the court and discovered a document had been submitted claiming the case had been settled to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>The 'notice of discontinuance' included an 'electronic signature' said to be Mr Ross's. </p>

<p>He told the court: 'The application to set aside the judgment is based on a fabricated email agreement that says I digitally signed an agreement to a £1,000 settlement when I paid £3,900 for the vehicle.</p>

<p>'It does not bear my signature and I have never seen this form before in my life.' It was 'declared a nullity' by a judge and Alwaheeb's firm was told to pay Mr Ross £7,524 plus interest, including £1,000 for emotional distress.</p>

<p>He said: 'These guys are just laughing at us.'</p>

<p>Another court hearing involving fraudulent documents between customer George Campbell Nicol, of Thurso, on Scotland's north coast, and Alwaheeb's company was held in November 2019 at Carlisle County Court. </p>

<p>After a notice of discontinuance was submitted with a hand-written signature, the judge ruled it had no resemblance to Mr Nicol's and had been forged.</p>

<p>Robyn Thompson, from Woking, Surrey, said she left her 'unusable' £3,300 VW Golf on her drive for three years as she sought a refund.</p>

<p>It had several faults, including with the brakes, and she was told by an independent garage it was unsafe to drive even after Alwaheeb's firm had 'fixed' it.</p>

<p>After appealing to the Motoring Ombudsman, the firm was ordered to pay a full refund, plus other costs, but it refused. </p>

<p>It only paid after being challenged by the Mail. </p>

<p>Robyn Thompson, (pictured) from Woking, Surrey, said she left her 'unusable' £3,300 VW Golf on her drive for three years as she sought a refund</p>

<p>One woman told how EMC Car Sales sold her a Jeep that, unknown to her, was subject to a government safety recall over a fault that could cause drivers to lose control and crash. </p>

<p>The customer, who was refused compensation by the firm, said it 'sold me a dangerous car'.</p>

<p>Alwaheeb accepted something 'dishonest' had happened in relation to 'fraudulent' court papers, but said they were submitted without his knowledge by a 'freelance legal professional' he claims to have hired – and plans to sue.</p>

<p>He added: 'I am shocked. He is a litigation expert, according to what he told me. We don't want any case to go to court. </p>

<p>'As long as you bring the car back within 30 days you can get a full refund.'</p>

<p>He said his firms were dismissed unfairly by the ombudsman, which he accused of delaying its rulings.</p>
