<p>Family day: Brigitte Nielsen appeared in high spirits as she headed out for a cycle ride with her husband Mattia Dessí, 41, and daughter Frida, two, on Sunday</p>

<p>The Danish beauty donned a baseball cap and partially wore a face mask. </p>

<p>Frida, meanwhile, looked sweet in a tie-dye tracksuit and beamed with happiness as the family stopped at a park. </p>

<p>Brigette looked a little tired after cycling with a special trailer attached at the back for Frida to sit in.  </p>

<p>Catching the eye: The actress, 57, cut a sporty figure in a vibrant pink top and black leggings</p>

<p>Brigitte was able to give birth to her daughter aged 54 thanks to her foresight to have her eggs frozen when she was 40.</p>

<p>'If you don’t want to use [donor] eggs, you have to preserve your own eggs at a reasonable age for there to be a possibility,' she explained to People shortly after welcoming little Frida.</p>

<p>She also spoke to The Guardian in February of last year about having a child in middle age.</p>

<p>'I was always like: I want to do it until there are no more embryos left,' said Nielsen. 'Somebody has to win the lottery.'  </p>

<p>Kick around: Frida, meanwhile, looked sweet in a tie-dye tracksuit and played with a football as the family stopped at a park</p>

<p>'You're on a lot of medication. It is very expensive. Hormones will do different things to different women... you always think you're going to get pregnant, but most of the time, the phone call comes and it's: I'm sorry.</p>

<p>'It is devastating,' she added. The partner you're with has to be onboard as much as you, unless you're a woman who wants to have a baby on your own. You have to stay realistic and, if you're older, the odds are against you.'</p>

<p>Brigitte and her husband have been married since 2006, but their relationship was first documented on Strange Love, her reality show with her former lover Flavor Flav of Public Enemy fame.</p>

<p>The reality star, who's currently on marriage number five, was famously wed to Sylvester Stallone from 1985–1987, and the two appeared together in Rocky IV and as the leads in the 1986 action thriller Cobra. </p>
