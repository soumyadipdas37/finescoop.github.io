<p>The airline relocated its head office at the weekend from Bowen Hills in Brisbane's inner north to South Brisbane, in the other side of the Story Bridge.</p>

<p>New owners Bain Capital, a US private equity firm, have been forced to keep retrenching staff as state border closures squeeze the domestic tourism industry.</p>

<p>Virgin chief executive Paul Scurrah, who remained in the role when the airline went into voluntary administration in April, has sent staff a note warning another 150 head office jobs were set to go, on top of the 250 positions made redundant in August.</p>

<p>A Virgin Australia spokeswoman confirmed Mr Scurrah had told staff state border closures were hurting the finances of the airline. </p>

<p>'We have informed our people of some minor structural changes which will position the business for the transition period that lies ahead of us,' she told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately this will result in around 150 roles being impacted in the corporate and head office workforce, and we will support all team members closely through this process.'</p>

<p>Virgin Australia told the Australian Securities Exchange on Monday it had relocated its head office to Grey Street in South Brisbane.</p>

<p>'We have also been required to review the number of head office team members currently stood up, with a view to make additional stand downs over the coming weeks,' the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>The retrenchments are set to affect corporate affairs staff who are not part of an enterprise bargaining agreement.</p>

<p>They will be eligible for JobKeeper wage subsidies, which are being reduced from $1,500 to $1,200 a fortnight for those working more than 20 hours a week.  </p>
