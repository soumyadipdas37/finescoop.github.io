<p>Since leaving the show, she has scooped her own reality show, The Mummy Diaries, with her partner Paul Knightley and their kids, Paul, five, and Rosie, two.  </p>

<p>Despite previous claims she would not return, The Sun report: 'Sam has been very vocal about her ­dislike for the show once she left, despite it making her...</p>

<p>Her friendship with Amy Childs - who is returning for the anniversary - was one of the central elements and won the hearts of many fans. </p>

<p>In 2011, Sam said of their now-defunct friendship: 'When she was in Celebrity Big Brother I gave her all the support in the world...</p>

<p>'I put her in my column and tweeted about her constantly. But when the last series of TOWIE started I didn't even get a text or a phone call. I feel very let down...</p>

<p>'TOWIE was a massive thing for both of us, and it would only take one phone call to show we're still friends. We're just not close any more and it's sad.' </p>
