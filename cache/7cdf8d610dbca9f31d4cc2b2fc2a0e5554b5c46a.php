<p>Jackie was one of the key creators and trainers on G.L.O.W., The Gorgeous Girls of Wrestling, 'a syndicated TV show from Las Vegas that ran for five years in the 1980s,' as stated by her official website.</p>

<p>She always had a deep love for fitness and for championing women in the competitive, televised athletic sphere.</p>

<p>Jackie, born Jacqueline Frances, ran away from home at the age of 15 and briefly worked as an aerialist in the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Baily's The Greatest Show on Earth.</p>

<p>As she grew older, she became 'the first woman to have a daily TV show on exercise and weight lifting in Washington, D.C,' which led to her opening her own all-female gym called Barbella's.</p>

<p>Jackie is also known for appearing in the popular Richard Simmons Silver Foxes exercise tapes, which provided low-impact exercise routines for senior citizens. </p>

<p>But Jackie's biggest passion was astrology, having written a famous book on the subject titled Star Power: An Astrological Guide to Supersuccess, which was published in 1989.</p>

<p>She studied astrology for 15-years under the supervision of a plethora of acclaimed astrologers, including the 'protegees of Evangeline Adams, the greatest astrologer of the Twentieth Century.' </p>

<p>Jackie's passion, eventually, led her to getting 'astrology accepted as an accredited course in many colleges and universities.'</p>

<p>Stallone also appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother in 2005, where she had an iconic run-in with former daughter-in-law Brigitte Nielsen. </p>

<p>Brigitte was married to Sylvester from 1985 until their divorce in 1987 and she had not seen Jackie face-to-face since then.</p>

<p>Jackie was the season's 'surprise ninth guest,' so when the Rocky IV star saw her former mother-in-law enter the house, her jaw totally dropped. </p>

<p>The moment made its way into reality TV history due to the dramatic nature of Jackie's entrance. She had on an extravagant fur coat and seemed to enjoy Brigitte's unfiltered shock. </p>
