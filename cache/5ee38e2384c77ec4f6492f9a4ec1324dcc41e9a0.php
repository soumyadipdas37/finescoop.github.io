<p>United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insisted that the centre half does have a future at the club</p>

<p>'This season was about him being a regular, going to Roma, showing and proving how good a centre-back he is.</p>

<p>'I wanted to give Harry (Maguire), Vic (Victor Lindelof), maybe Axel (Tuanzebe) a chance, so we found out that was the best for him to go to Roma, play for a year.</p>

<p>'Now he's coming back and Chris has shown this season that he will be valuable. I've been speaking to Chris throughout and been delighted with his season.'</p>

<p>Solskjaer is continuing to rebuild his Red Devils squad as he eyes improving on last season's third-placed finish in the Premier League.</p>
