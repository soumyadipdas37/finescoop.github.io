<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She's endured a year of ups, downs and breakups, and it seems like she may be airing some dirty laundry on her next album.</p>

<p>Miley Cyrus is hard at work on her seventh studio album, titled She Is Miley Cyrus, and The Sun reports that there are at least a few references to her failed marriage to ex-husband Liam Hemsworth therein. </p>

<p>The We Can't Stop songstress, 27, reportedly takes aim at Liam directly in a few tracks, including one called Win Some, Lose Some, in which she sings: 'Can’t count all the times that I faked it, thank God for the thoughts in my head.'</p>

<p>She's a man eater: Miley Cyrus seems like she may be airing some dirty laundry on her next album, according to some newly leaked lyrics; seen this month on The Tonight Show</p>

<p>The complete lyrics read: </p>

<p>'Last night was the nail in the coffin, Lord knows we were already dead. Look back and the memory’s haunted, can’t believe we did it again, yeah. Can’t count all the times that I faked it, thank God for the thoughts in my head.'</p>

<p>While it remains unconfirmed whether Win Some, Lose Some will in fact end up on the final cut of the new record, the references to her longtime on-off love are there, including in the chorus: </p>

<p>'You know me the best, but you hurt me the worst, my darling. I can’t pretend any more.'</p>

<p>The We Can't Stop songstress reportedly takes aim at ex Liam Hemsworth directly in a few tracks, including one in which she sings: 'Can’t count all the times that I faked it'; seen in 2019</p>

<p>Cyrus and her Last Song costar, who dated on and off since that film's shoot in 2009 and later wed in December 2018, subsequently split last August in a very public divorce.</p>

<p>In another potential song off the new album, WTF Do I Know, Miley reflects: 'Maybe getting married just to cause a distraction.' </p>

<p>Still other lyrics seem to be directed at the Australian actor, when she sings: </p>

<p>'You wanted an apology? Not from me. I had to leave you in your own misery. So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on? And I don’t even miss you.</p>

<p>While it remains unconfirmed whether Win Some, Lose Some will end up on the new record, the references to her longtime on-off love are there: 'You know me the best, but you hurt me the worst, my darling. I can’t pretend any more'; Miley this week seen on Instagram</p>

<p>'Thought that it'd be you until I die, but I let go,' she croons.</p>

<p>She Is Miley Cyrus, which Cosmopolitan said earlier this month will have 'heavy rock and roll vibe,' is to be released at a still-unspecified date by RCA Records. </p>

<p>And while the Adore You hitmaker is said to have begun working on the new album shortly before the release of her last one, 2017's Younger Now, it seems pretty evident that the new record has been informed by her starry breakup from Hemsworth last summer, not to mention her more recent splits from rebound Kaitlynn Carter and Cody Simpson.</p>

<p>Miley's latest album was originally intended to be released over a trilogy of extended plays, one of which, entitled She Is Coming, came out last year.</p>

<p>But between her divorce, vocal cord surgery and the COVID-19 pandemic, Cyrus decided to scrap those plans and go the traditional route of releasing the record in one go. </p>

<p>And while current hit Midnight Sky is the lead single off She Is Miley Cyrus, Miley's Smilers fanbase have yet to receive final word on when the rest of the record will drop. </p>

<p>Ex files: It seems evident that Miley's new record has been informed by her starry breakup from Hemsworth last summer, not to mention her more recent split from Cody Simpson...</p>

<p>...and rebound Kaitlynn Carter; seen together last September</p>
