<p>'I think I'll pass!' Olly Murs was left disappointed as Olivia Colman declined his offer to join the England football team for annual charity game Soccer Aid on Sunday</p>

<p>The funny sketch kicked off with the former X Factor star approaching manager Sam Allardyce, joined by fellow coach Wayne Rooney, for advice on who to recruit for the group.</p>

<p>Olly's description of the job clearly confused The Crown star Olivia, who believed she was signing up for an acting stint. </p>

<p>'Do you have a script you can send me? I can research the striker and it can grow originally! Do you have Dame Judi on board?', the thespian asked, before the musician said: 'Just Mark Wright!'</p>

<p>Failing to find potential teammates, former Big Brother presenter Rylan, 31, added salt to the wound as he asked: 'I haven't got to wear one of them football shirts do I?, before American singer Dolly, 74, admitted: 'Sorry Olly, I'm working 9 to 5!'</p>

<p>Olly's fellow The Voice coach will.i.am, 45, was enthusiastic for the wrong reasons as he suggested: 'Every time we score, I want to sing and change our outfits. Who else is playing that sings? Come on bro, most of the time you're just on Instagram!'</p>
