<p>In the second quarter of 2020, Snapchat had 238 million daily active users worldwide - up from 203 million in the same period last year. </p>

<p>Data from the nonpartisan group Democracy Works, which partnered with Snapchat on its voter drive, shows that 450,000 users registered to vote via the platform in 2018.</p>

<p>'Snapchat is the platform that can fill all the institutional gaps in reaching young people,' Mike Ward, Democracy Works' director of voter engagement told Bloomberg News in May. </p>

<p>'They are uniquely positioned to be the most powerful youth voter registration force in the country.' </p>

<p>That's especially true during the pandemic, Ward said, when the usual college voter drives haven't been able to take place. </p>

<p>'Snap's success on voter engagement is more important than ever, given that on-the-ground voter engagement can't be counted on in a pandemic environment.' </p>

<p>Other social media platforms are also ramping up efforts to get out the vote.</p>

<p>Earlier this summer, Facebook launched its Voter Information Center, offering news on local and national elections and info on absentee ballots and voting districts.</p>

<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in June that the company hopes to register 4 million people by Election Day.</p>

<p>And today Twitter announced the launch of a voting hub 'focused on helping people register, better understand the voting process during COVID-19 including early voting options, and feel informed about the choices on their ballot.'</p>

<p>According to the company, 90 percent of daily Twitter users say they plan to vote in the upcoming election, though more than half said they needed more information about candidates and the voting process itself.</p>

<p>In the US, the hub will appear at the top of user's Explore tab and include news in both English and Spanish from reputable news outlets or by Twitter's Curation team, as well as live streams of debates and other campaign events.</p>

<p>The hub will also run nonpartisan PSAs to encourage voter turnout and a tool that lists the candidates for Congress and governor in a user's state.</p>
