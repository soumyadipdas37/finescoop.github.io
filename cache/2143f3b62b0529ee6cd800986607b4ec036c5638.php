<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pfizer Inc said participants developed mild-to-moderate side effects in the New York-based drug company's experimental coronavirus vaccine late-stage trial.</p>

<p>Fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom data as of August 27, executives said on an investor conference call on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Because the study is randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled - the gold-standard of clinical trials - researchers do not know if the subject received the experimental jab or a placebo.</p>

<p>An independent data monitoring committee could recommend pausing the study at any time, but has not done so to date, the company said.  </p>

<p>However, no major safety issues - such as side effects resulting in hospitalization - have been reported unlike a participant in the Oxford University trial that was recently paused in the US</p>

<p>Pfizer Inc says participants have shown mild to moderate side effects from either its experiment coronavirus vaccine or a placebo with the fatigue being the most common sign.

<p>Over 12,000 study participants had received a second dose of the vaccine, Pfizer executives said on the conference call.</p>

<p>After the second dose, 36 percent of the age 18-to-64 group and 27 percent of the age 65-to-84 group reported fatigue.</p>

<p>The next most commonly reported symptoms were headache, muscle pain, chills and joint pain, respectively.</p>

<p>'[Researchers] would notify us if they had any safety concerns and have not done that to date,' Dr Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer's head of vaccine research, said on the call. </p>

<p>The company has enrolled more than 29,000 people in its 44,000-volunteer trial to test the experimental COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with German partner BioNTech.</p>

<p>Pfizer had said the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will consider issuing an emergency use authorization of a vaccine if it sees strong enough safety and efficacy data in a subset of the trial volunteers.</p>

<p>This means the FDA is only requiring data on 6,000 volunteers - 3,000 vaccinated and 3,000 given a placebo, the executives said.</p>

<p>Pfizer added it is continuously scrutinizing the safety and tolerability of the vaccine in its study. </p>

<p>'What we are doing in terms of releasing data is very unusual,' CEO Albert Bourla said, according to Bloomberg News.</p>

<p>'It is a must to release this data.' </p>

<p>The comments come after the COVID-19 vaccine trials of rival AstraZeneca Plc were put on hold worldwide last week after a severe side effect was reported in a volunteer in Britain.</p>

<p>The British participant was rushed to the hospital after suffering a serious reaction that triggered spinal cord inflammation. </p>

<p>AstraZeneca's trials resumed in the UK and Brazil on Monday following the green light from British regulators, but remain on hold in the US. </p>

<p>The vaccine candidate from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech uses part of the pathogen's genetic code called messenger RNA, or mRNa.</p>

<p>It trains the body to recognize the coronavirus, which will send out an immune response if a person becomes infected.</p>

<p>In July, the company released data from its early-stage trial, involving 45 people who received either a low, medium or high dose of the vaccine in two shots or a placebo.</p>

<p>Volunteers given either the low or medium dose generated not just antibodies against the virus but specifically neutralizing antibodies, meaning they stop the virus from infecting human cells.</p>

<p>Results showed the levels of neutralizing antibodies were between 1.8 and 2.8 times greater than those seen in recovered patients.</p>

<p>Pfizer Inc says it could have results from its late-stage coronavirus vaccine trial available as early as October and - if data shows the jab is safe and effective - it will submit an application for approval immediately.</p>
