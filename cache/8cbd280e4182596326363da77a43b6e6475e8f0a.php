<p>'Debates are on. It all feels fake,' Ocean wrote. 'The problem's that it's not.</p>

<p>'Donald is president and might not leave the White House even if he loses the race so some say,' he continued, referencing Trump's claims that he would only accept the outcome of the election if he were judged the winner. </p>
