<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>He has been very vocal about wanting to cross the border and see his family in Queensland. </p>

<p>And now Karl Stefanovic has hatched an elaborate plan to cross it, as QLD Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk continues to keep it closed. </p>

<p>In a segment on Today with Tasmanian senator, Jacqui Lambie and 2GB radio host Chris Smith, the 46-year-old explained that he was drawing inspiration from the classic Australian film Danny Deckchair. </p>

<p>Ready to fly! Karl Stefanovic revealed his radical plan to 'sail on over the border' into Queensland with helium balloons in a discussion with Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie (left) and 2GB radio host Chris Smith (right) on Thursday</p>

<p>In the 2003 film, the titular character ties helium balloons to his deckchair, which is let go and sent flying across the country. </p>

<p>The TV host, who hails from the Sunshine state and is based in Sydney, joked that he had a 'crack' at getting across the border which remains closed.</p>

<p>He then showed footage of his attempt, which turned out to be of David Blaine flying more than 7000 metres up into the sky using balloons.</p>

<p>The American Illusionist held a cluster of 52 helium-filled balloons in the Arizona desert, which took place on Wednesday in the US.</p>

<p>Inspired: The TV host, who hails from Queensland, told them he was drawing inspiration from the classic Australian film Danny Deckchair (pictured) and that he 'would sail on over the border'</p>

<p>Karl quipped that he would: 'Just sail on over the border. What do you think about that?'</p>

<p>'Just over Coolangatta, beautiful little head wind and off I went all the way up to Yorkeys Knob. Good morning, Mum,' he added.</p>

<p>The Today host asked his guests for their thoughts on his 'escape' plan.</p>

<p>Radio presenter Chris said: 'I hope it's Queensland police who'll have the balloons above them because if we send in the Victorian police they might shoot them down.' </p>

<p>Flying high! Karl joked that he had a 'crack' at getting across the border and showed footage, which turned out to be of American Illusionist David Blaine flying more than 7000 metres up into the sky holding a cluster of 52 helium-filled balloons in the Arizona desert</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jacqui joked that she needed an escape too, saying: 'I've had two weeks in parliament, mate. Beam me up, Scotty.'</p>

<p>Karl's hilarious plan comes after the Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced on Tuesday that they would not open to NSW in September.</p>

<p>Any person who has been in New South Wales is restricted from travelling to Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, and may be subject to quarantine if they enter South Australia, Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory.</p>
