<p>There have been six shootings in Western Sydney since August 26. Pictured: a police car at the scene of the shooting in St Johns Park on Tuesday night</p>

<p>The incident is the sixth shooting in Sydney's west and southwest since August 26, sparking fears of a bikie war breaking out across the city.</p>

<p>There were another two shootings in the city on Monday night, with Mark Shammo shot in the legs and torso on Garrong Road in Lakemba at about 8.15.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old was taken to hospital for surgery on non-life threatening injuries after taking shelter in a home, while four men fled from the scene in a white SUV.</p>

<p>'We are definitely of the belief that this was a targeted attack,' Acting Superintendent Dennis Donohue told 9News.</p>

<p>'It's of great concern to us that this man was attacked in the private residence with other innocent members of the public.'</p>

<p>Later that evening two children were among nine survivors in a drive-by shooting in a home on Tarlington Parade in Bonnyrigg at about 11.30pm.</p>

<p>NSW police said a person was seen fleeing in a white hatchback following the attack.</p>

<p>Inquiries are continuing and no arrests have been made for either shooting.</p>

<p>Former Comancheros bikie Fares Abounader died in a hail of bullets outside his home at Wall Avenue in Panania before midnight on Saturday night. </p>

<p>Despite the best efforts of his family, a neighbour and emergency services the 39-year-old was unable to be saved and died at the scene.</p>

<p>'The shooting was very calculated and very deliberate and quite brazen,' Detective Superintendent Robert Critchlow said on Sunday. </p>

<p>'Despite the fact that the victim is known to police it doesn't change the fact he was a family man. His wife and young child were home at the time. </p>

<p>'No-one deserves to be treated like this and murdered in such a callous fashion in front of his home.'</p>

<p>It is believed Mr Abounader was the victim of a targeted shooting as tensions continue to simmer between the Comancheros and Bandidos.</p>

<p>Mr Abounader was allegedly involved in the 2009 brawl at Sydney Airport, when Comancheros bikies clashed with their Hells Angels rivals.</p>

<p>Hells Angel member Anthony Zervas was killed and then-Comanchero boss Mick Hawi, who died in 2018, was charged with manslaughter.</p>

<p>Mr Abounader fled the scene after allegedly throwing a knife down a drain.</p>

<p>Lastly, Mohamed Saab was found with gunshot wounds to his shoulder, ribs and leg outside a home in Knoll Avenue in Turrella before 7am on August 26.</p>

<p>Neighbours swarmed the street as the 37-year-old father-of-two was hauled into an ambulance and taken to St George Hospital in a serious condition. </p>

<p>Many have been left shaken by the shooting of the well-known businessman who they say is a 'role model'.</p>

<p>Investigators are still piecing together what sparked the shooting, which they believe was targeted.</p>

<p>A dark sedan was spotted leaving the area moments after the attack.</p>

<p>'Some of the information that has come forward leads us to believe this was not a random incident,' Chief Inspector Chris Hill said.</p>

<p>As inquiries continue, anyone who was in the area or who has information has been urged to come forward to police.</p>
