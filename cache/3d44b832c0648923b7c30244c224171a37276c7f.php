<p>Myleene donned an eclectic collection of jewellery including large hoop earrings for a touch of glamour and styled her caramel tresses in voluminous waves. </p>

<p>The brunette beauty's latest appearance came after her recent social media run-in with a troll who claimed her boyfriend Simon Motson will cheat on her.   </p>

<p>Myleene recently posted a gallery of images with the PR executive, 45, to celebrate their five year anniversary as a couple.</p>

<p>However a troll wrote underneath: 'Not long before this one cheats on you. Dear oh dear, heading for the lawyers are we?'</p>

<p>In a pointed response, she fired back: 'He wishes! Cheating exes usually get a house, a car and a fat pay-off.' </p>

<p>It appeared to be a dig at her ex-husband Graham Quinn, who left her on her 34th birthday in 2012.  </p>

<p>The marriage breakdown came just six months after the couple's wedding, but they had been together for 11 years after meeting when Graham became the bodyguard for defunct pop group Hear'Say.</p>

<p>Myleene, who shares daughters, Ava, 13, and Hero, nine with Graham, was devastated to learn that he had secretly bought a bachelor pad for himself – meaning that he must have been planning his departure for some time.</p>

<p>The presenter is now in a happy relationship with Simon, who she began dating in 2015 after being introduced by two mutual friends. </p>

<p>The pair welcomed their first child together, son Apollo, 13 months, in August last year.</p>
