<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jude Bellingham has been using spare moments of his first Under-21 camp to study German in a bid to quickly integrate himself into the Borussia Dortmund team.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old became the age group’s youngest ever debutant during Friday night’s 6-0 rout of Kosovo, scoring the sixth during an impressive cameo from the bench.</p>

<p>Bellingham made the switch from Birmingham to the Bundesliga in a move worth £25million over the summer and is intent on giving himself the best chance to succeed, using a smartphone app to brush up on his German during downtime.</p>

<p>Jude Bellingham is dazzling for England but still finding the time to practice his German</p>

<p>Manager Aidy Boothroyd has spoken highly of the youngster’s attitude over the last few days, with team-mates staggered by his ability in training.</p>

<p>‘Some of the boys have been giving him a bit of banter asking him his age,’ Reiss Nelson said. ‘He’s about 6ft, has a great first touch, he can shoot off either foot. It’s really confusing to see a kid that young that can do so much.’</p>

<p>After making the move to Dortmund Bellingham is tipped to soon be the next big thing</p>

<p>Nelson spent the 2018-19 season on loan at Hoffenheim under Julian Nagelsmann, living in the sleepy town of Heidelberg with his family, and has been on hand for advice.</p>

<p>‘He’s asked me about the German,’ Nelson added. ‘I tried to learn but it was really difficult. I feel like he’ll pick it up really quickly. He’s a great lad as well and I can see his future going all the way to the top and all the way to the seniors. He’s so easy to play with.’</p>

<p>England U21 boss Aidy Boothroyd is highly impressed by the commitment of the teenager</p>

<p>Bellingham offers versatility in midfield and proved that on Friday night, starting a move on the halfway line for England’s fifth goal before scoring a sumptuous sixth himself, dropping his shoulder and curling into the far corner.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think he quite knows what he wants to be yet,’ Boothroyd said. ‘He can play on the half-turn, play forward. I know he can play wide. I’ve seen him play as a 7, 11 and a 10 at Birmingham before he went to Dortmund.</p>

<p>‘He can play a variety of positions. He’s just a really good footballer. He’s very stylish and efficient with his passing. He’s a good, genuine kid. We’re delighted to have him.’</p>
