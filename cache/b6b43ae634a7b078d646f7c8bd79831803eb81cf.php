<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wes Nelson has revealed he became a millionaire the age of just 21 following a series of reality TV appearances and canny investments with his earnings - and claims he'll never have to work again. </p>

<p>The 2018 Love Island finalist, now 22, recently also signed a record deal with EMI Records - a moment he described on Instagram as 'my biggest dream'.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, Wes said: 'I was a millionaire by the age of 21. And that's not being a show off or anything, but it's wise investments and understanding this life doesn't last forever.'</p>

<p>Jet set: Wes Nelson has revealed he became a millionaire the age of just 21 following a series of reality TV appearances and canny investments with his earnings</p>

<p>'I have a passive income and generational wealth, so my children, whenever they come about, they're not going to have to work again. I don't have to work again.' </p>

<p>Wes added that he used to listen to property podcasts in-between making club appearances, meaning he now owns 'a lot' of mortgage-free properties. </p>

<p>Only last month, Wes revealed he'd signed his first solo record deal, following his failing to win The X Factor: Celebrity last year. </p>

<p>Wes shared a gallery of snaps from the moment he signed his contract and described himself as 'the happiest man on the planet.'</p>

<p>How it all started: Wes first found fame as a  finalist on the 2018 series of Love Island, but has come a long way since then</p>

<p>He added: 'I've got a great team around me, this is just the start! The debut single is on the way.'</p>

<p>The reality failed to set the music world alight as a part of pop group No Love Lost last year, which was eliminated during the third live show.</p>

<p>Wes, who worked as a nuclear engineer before joining Love Island,  impressed with his rapping skills during the performances, and also taught himself to play the piano.</p>

<p>Wes dated Megan Barton-Hanson, 26, for six months after they got together on Love Island, and he split from latest girlfriend Arabella Chi, 29, earlier this summer after nine months of dating.</p>

<p>Superstar: Wes, pictured signing his EMI record deal, hopes to make it big as a pop star following his appearance on Celebrity X Factor last year</p>

<p>The pair were said to have 'grown apart' and had become more aware of their six-year age gap ahead of their split.</p>

<p>Wes moved out of the home he shared with the model so they didn't have to isolate together under lockdown rules. </p>

<p>He is now living with his friend and former Love Island 2018 co-star, Josh Denzel. </p>

<p>The news likely came as a shock to their fans, as just a week before they called it quits, the pair revealed that they were enjoying their time in lockdown together.</p>

<p>Speaking to OK! Online, Wes said: 'It's been alright. It's hard to get out at the moment, isn't it? We're just trying to do our piece of exercise a day.'</p>

<p>Living it up: Wes also revealed that he now owns 'a lot' of mortgage-free properties, meaning his children 'won't have to work' </p>
