<p>No deal: Denise Richards has left Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills and on Monday Bravo star Andy Cohen of Watch What Happens Live fame shared that the 49-year-old star's departure was a matter of a stalled negotiation</p>

<p>Sad Andy: 'I'm just sad we couldn't reach an agreement for next season,' the single father told PeopleTV's Reality Check which aired on Monday. 'I'm kind of living in that sadness'</p>

<p>According to Cohen, the former Playboy magazine cover girl was 'in talks' to return for another season when she decided not to return.</p>

<p>'We were negotiating a deal with her and we couldn't reach an agreement on the deal,' he explained. </p>

<p>That leaves the show with Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley and Teddy Mellencamp, among others.</p>

<p>Of that list, Kyle is the only original cast member. The show launched in 2010.</p>

<p>Kiss and tell: All seemed to be fine for a while but when part-time RHOBH member Brandi Glanville accused her of having a sexual relationship, Denise denied it then lashed out</p>

<p>Denise was a bit of a surprise as a new cast member when she joined in 2019 because she was the only one who had a real Hollywood career.</p>

<p>She had been in the blockbusters like 1997's Starship Troopers and 1999's The World Is Not Enough.</p>

<p>Denise had also experienced a high-profile marriage to Charlie Sheen from 2002 to 2006. </p>

<p>All seemed to be fine for a while but when part-time RHOBH member Brandi Glanville accused her of having a sexual relationship, Denise denied it then lashed out.</p>

<p>Still standing: Now that Denise has exited the show, that leaves Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne, Lisa Rinna and Teddy Mellencamp, among others</p>

<p>She did it: 'She's answering her truth,' said Cohen. 'She has a family and kids. Whatever happened or didn't happen, I would imagine that it's something that maybe she didn't really care to discuss on a television show'</p>

<p>The other cast members did not support her but rather turned on the Wild Things actress.  </p>

<p>'She's answering her truth,' said Cohen. 'She has a family and kids. Whatever happened or didn't happen, I would imagine that it's something that maybe she didn't really care to discuss on a television show.' </p>

<p>A source told People that Denise wants to spend time with her family.</p>

<p>She has been wed to Aaron Phypers for two years.</p>

<p>Richards has three daughters - Lola, 15, and Sam, 16, with ex-husband Charlie Sheen and adopted Eloise, aged nine.</p>

<p>'Denise is excited to be home from Spain with her husband and children. Filming [Glow And Darkness] in Spain has been wonderful as the only pot being stirred is their incredible Spanish food,' the source said.</p>

<p>Her true love: A source told People that Denise wants to spend time with her family. She has been wed to Aaron Phypers for two years</p>
