<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fewer white and Hispanic Americans are supporting Black Lives Matter while African American backing for the movement remains virtually unchanged, according to a new poll.</p>

<p>A majority of Americans - 55 per cent - express at least some support for the movement, which is down from 67 per cent in June, a new survey by Pew Research Center shows.</p>

<p>The number of American adults who say they strongly support the movement has also dropped from 38 per cent in June to 29 per cent.</p>

<p>The previous survey was taken in the days and weeks following the May 25 police-involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter supporters march to the George Washington Bridge in Globe Park, New York, on September 12. A new Pew Research Center poll finds that a drop in the number of Americans who back the movement</p>

<p>Pew’s latest findings were taken in the aftermath of the police shooting of 29-year-old black man Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Among African Americans, support for BLM remains strong. In June, 87 per cent of blacks said they backed the movement.</p>

<p>The latest survey puts the figure at 86 per cent.</p>

<p>Notably, the poll found a drop of African American adults who say they strongly support BLM. In June, 71 per cent said they strongly supported it, though now 62 per cent say the same.</p>

<p>Pew found that it is among whites and Hispanics that backing for BLM has wavered.</p>

<p>Among white adults, 60 per cent said they supported BLM back in June. That number has now dropped to less than half - 45 per cent.</p>

<p>In June, 77 per cent of Hispanic adults said they supported BLM. The latest findings show that number has slipped to 66 per cent today.</p>

<p>Among Asian Americans, backing for BLM has dropped slightly from 75 per cent to 69 per cent.</p>

<p>Support for BLM also brings down sharply along partisan lines. Just 19 per cent of Republicans said they somewhat supported the movement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 88 per cent of Democrats said the same.</p>

<p>Broken down into race, 88 per cent of white Democrats expressed at least some support for BLM while just 16 per cent of white Republicans say the same.</p>

<p>A little more than half - 51 per cent - of white Democrats said they strongly support BLM, while just 2 per cent of white Republicans said the same. </p>
