<p>A harrowing Triple Zero call made after ex-Comancheros bikie boss Mick Hawi (pictured) was shot outside of a Fitness First gym in south Sydney in February 2018 has been released </p>

<p>Ms Nicolaou was working at the front desk when she saw a man dressed in a black hoodie walk towards the ex-Comancheros chief's car before bullets were fired.  </p>

<p>'I need police and ambulance right away at Rockdale Fitness First. I just heard somebody come and shoot a person in the car,' Ms Nicolaou told the operator.</p>

<p>'There's glass everywhere... Somebody is giving CPR in the car right now,' she said.  </p>

<p>Ms Nicolaou began to cry and the emergency call operator tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>'Don't hang up on me okay? We've got police on the way and I'm getting an ambulance,' the operator said.</p>

<p>The receptionist continued to frantically describe what had happened.    </p>

<p>'I was at the reception, there was glass all around and I just ducked.   </p>

<p>Hawi was shot multiple times while sitting in his black Mercedes (pictured). The distressing call was made by receptionist Stephanie Nicolaou and detailed efforts to save him </p>

<p>'The person was shot in the car, the car is stationary right now, somebody is trying to perform CPR,' she told the operator. </p>

<p>Ms Nicolaou also described what the gunman was wearing and said they had fled the scene on foot.</p>

<p>'They were on foot, they were wearing a black hoodie... they just went out of the carpark, so where the cars drive in and out of.</p>

<p>'It looked like a male... I have no idea,' she explained. </p>

<p>The operator asked Ms Nicolaou to take 'a big deep breath' and directed her to approach the car and see if Hawi was responding to the CPR.</p>

<p>Ms Nicolaou told the emergency line operator Hawi was unconscious and another witness was performing CPR (NSW Police at the scene of the shooting in Rockdale pictured) </p>

<p>The receptionist could also be heard describing the shooter (CCTV of the shooting pictured) as wearing a black hoodie and fleeing the scene on foot </p>

<p>'Can you ask if the person is making any progress? … The victim is unconscious?,' the operator asked. </p>

<p>Ms Nicolaou confirmed that he was unconscious and the call ended with the operator assuring her emergency services were on the way.     </p>

<p>Hawi was rushed to hospital, where he later died. </p>

<p>A NSW Supreme Court jury on Thursday found two men not guilty of Hawi's murder after five days of deliberation following a three-and-a-half week trial. </p>

<p>Yusuf Guney Nazlioglu, 39, was accused of being the shooter while Jamal Eljaidi, 32, was said to be the getaway driver.    </p>

<p>The jury saw CCTV of the masked gunman, dressed in black from head to toe, leave the murder scene in a car driven by another man. </p>

<p>Photos taken by police and tendered to the court during the trial showed Hawi's luxury 4WD riddled with bullet holes and shell casings. </p>
