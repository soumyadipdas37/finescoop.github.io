<p>They say its a bugs life, but a collection of new photos sheds a new light on the secret life of an insect.</p>

<p>The images make them look more like aliens than insects.</p>

<p>Ondrej Pakan, from Myjava, Slovakia, captured the stunning series of microscopic insects following a downpour.</p>

<p>Secret life of a bug: Water droplets make this inset look twice the size</p>

<p>Ondrej Pakan, from Slovakia, captured the images using a special lense</p>

<p>Tiny droplets of water make the bugs take on an altogether different look - inflating them to a bigger size once they are covered in liquid.</p>

<p>In one eye catching photo an ant looks to be straining under the heavy weight of water droplets settling on his body.</p>

<p>Another shows a huge wasp about to take flight doused in water.</p>

<p>While one blue-eyed bug can be seen staring down the lens of Ondrej's camera - covered in dots of water.</p>

<p>Is that a wasp: The water droplets make the body of the wasp almost twice as big</p>

<p>An ant looks like it is struggling to cope under the weight of the water</p>

<p>The Slovakian photographer specialises in capturing the world's microscopic insects seconds after a downpour but also has to dodge the showers himself.</p>

<p>He said: 'I get soaked waiting for the rain to finish, but it all seems worth it when you get really great shots of the insects with drops on them.</p>

<p>This ladybird looks like it is carrying a huge visitor on its back but it is just a water droplet</p>

<p>The photos show up the tiny details of the insects which are impossible to see through the naked eye</p>

<p>'It's a challenge not letting your equipment get too wet in some of the more exotic locations.</p>

<p>'People seem to really like the colours and the way the water magnifies features of the insects.'</p>

<p>Ondrej used his trusty Canon 40D with a special lens to capture the amazing shots.</p>

<p>The minute detail of the small hairs on the body of the insect are shown in contrast to the bright colours of the creature</p>
