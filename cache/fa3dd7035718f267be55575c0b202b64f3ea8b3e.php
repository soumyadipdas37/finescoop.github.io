<p>Back to school! Jeff Lewis celebrated daughter Monroe returning to school with a cute Instagram photo on Thursday </p>

<p>The Flipping Out designer and his partner were in sporty duds as they lead their pups around.</p>

<p>Jeff was still wearing a brace around his neck, as he continued to recover from surgery for the spinal cord condition.</p>

<p>Lewis was likely happy to have a bit of time on his hands while Monroe went to school.</p>

<p>Hopefully this school year will be less dramatic than her last.</p>

<p>Poor Monroe was actually expelled from her Montessori preschool last fall after her father Jeff criticized the school on his Radio Andy Show Jeff Lewis Live.</p>

<p>Time together: While Monroe, three, went to learn Jeff, 50, took a walk around the neighborhood with his on-again boyfriend Scott Anderson and their two dogs</p>

<p>Schooled: Last school year poor Monroe was actually expelled from her Montessori preschool after her father Jeff criticized the school on his Radio Andy Show Jeff Lewis Live</p>

<p>Then at her next school, Jeff claimed that his daughter was bullied by another toddler who pushed her down on the playground.</p>

<p>All the while, the Bravo house flipper and ex Gage Edward are still locked in a custody battle over Monroe.</p>

<p>Lewis and Edward separated in January 2019. Lewis announced they had officially split in February.</p>

<p>Last month the reality personality revealed that Edward served him with court documents requesting legal support, equal shared custody of Monroe along with a request to change her legal name from Monroe Christine Lewis to Monroe Christine Edward Lewis.</p>

<p>Exes: the Bravo house flipper and ex Gage Edward are still locked in a custody battle over Monroe. Lewis and Edward split in February 2019</p>

<p>But Jeff told his listeners he doesn't think Gage can 'handle' 50/50 custody. </p>

<p>'The reason, in my opinion, he wants 50 percent custody is because he wants maximum child support. If that is the case, let's sit down. I'll be far more generous if we could just sit down and work it out,' he said. 'But I'm fighting for the best interest of my child.' </p>

<p>'Gage and I, I think we're coparenting fine together. I'm very careful, I never say anything negative about him [in front of Monroe]. I actually think he's a good dad. A really good dad!' he added. 'But I don't think he can handle any more than what he's got going on.'</p>

<p>'My child's with me 70 percent of the time. She's happy. She's well-adjusted,' he said.</p>

<p>Accusations: 'The reason, in my opinion, he wants 50 percent custody is because he wants maximum child support,' Lewis said of his ex </p>
