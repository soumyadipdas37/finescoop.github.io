<p>Ayesha Vardag wrote staff a lengthy 1,000-word dress code email advising women to dress 'formal' but said they could also be 'discreetly sexy' </p>

<p>She advised women to dress 'formal' but said they could also be 'discreetly sexy and colourful and flamboyant' and should aim for a 'Chanel/Dior/Armani look'.</p>

<p>Ms Vardag also noted they shouldn't wear anything 'homespun or homely' adding that 'cardigans are almost never ok'.  </p>

<p>According to the email, sent in July 2019, she said that women must wear 'elegant' shoes but doesn't say they need to be high-heeled. </p>

<p>There are also rules laid out for men, who are told to go for a 'Savile Row look' but stresses that woolly jumpers 'are a no-no'.</p>

<p>This is also the case for 'super-tight trousers or pointy toes' which are 'sternly frowned upon'.  </p>

<p>They are also advised to wear 'classic' shoes that are 'black' because, as the old adage goes, 'never wear brown in town'.</p>
