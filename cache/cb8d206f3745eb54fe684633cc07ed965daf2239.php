<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the comical moment a mother receives the shock of her life when she discovers she is having twin girls during an ultrasound.  </p>

<p>Chancè Hindir-Lane, 25, from Maryland, had been attending a routine ultrasound scan with her husband when she was told by her doctor that she was carrying not one but two babies.</p>

<p>Footage shows the expectant mother refuse to believe what she is hearing and even accuse the doctor of lying before saying: 'No, that's not true.'  </p>

<p>The soon-to-be mother cannot believe what she is hearing when her doctor tells her she is having twins </p>

<p>Chancè Hindir-Lane, 25, from Maryland, decided to share the comical footage on Instagram</p>

<p>During the clip, which was filmed last year but was shared on Ms Hinder-Lane's Instagram in July, the soon-to-be mother gasps as the doctor tells her: 'You have twins.'</p>

<p>Unable to absorb the bombshell announcement, Ms Hinder-Lane repeatedly replies: 'I'm sorry what?' </p>

<p>The doctor points out the two babies inside her uterus before the mother says: 'You're lying, you're joking. No that's not true. Aren't babies supposed to be in different things so that's obviously just one.'</p>

<p>The doctor goes on to tell the mother that the growing babies are in two different sacs in her uterus and explains: 'So here is your uterus and then there's a sac that's around this baby and a sac that's around this baby.'</p>

<p>As the information begins to sink in, Ms Hinder-Lane replies: 'So you mean like two of them? Oh my god. So you mean two right? At the same time? How do you even push them out at the same time?'</p>

<p>The doctor explains to the expectant mother that there are two babies growing inside her </p>

<p>The mother refuses to believe she is having two babies and even asks the doctor if she is lying</p>

<p>The doctor calmly explains: 'Well one baby comes out first and then the next baby comes out.'</p>

<p>Ms Hinder-Lane then goes on to reveal that her sister also has twins as the doctor excitedly shouts: 'Oh my god!' </p>

<p>The mother, whose twin girls Apphia Chanceline L'âne and Atarah Furaha L'âne are now 20-months-old, said: 'When we showed up to the appointment and they told me I'm having twins, I really thought it was a prank by my husband.</p>

<p>'My husband was just as shocked and extremely excited.</p>

<p>'We couldn't stop thinking about how unreal the whole situation was!'</p>

<p>She added: 'It has been a long ride, but we love being the twins parents!'</p>

<p>In July, the mother decided to share the comical footage with her followers on Instagram next to a message which read: 'Finding out there's two. ''I'm sorry WHAT?''  </p>

<p>Ms Hinder-Lane later took to her Instagram page to share the comical video with her followers</p>

<p>'A year ago today I had a 6-month-old and thought I was pregnant with another baby. I was finally starting to be ok with the idea of having two under two. </p>

<p>'In my head I was having another boy and I was pretty sure that was that.</p>

<p>'Me finding out I was having twins is still the funniest video I've ever seen. I'm not sure why I thought the doctor was lying to me.'</p>
