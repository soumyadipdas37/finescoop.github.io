<p>A basketball exhibition match was due to be staged between Newcastle Eagles and Sheffield Sharks in front of 800 fans at the Eagles Community Arena in Newcastle on Friday.</p>

<p>But with tighter social restrictions to curb a spike in coronavirus cases in Newcastle and six other North East regions coming into force on Friday, the government has now banned spectators from attending the pre-season friendly.</p>

<p>The Government's only indoor sport test event will now take place behind closed doors</p>

<p>Newcastle Eagles were set to host Sheffield Sharks in front of 800 spectators on Friday night</p>

<p>It means there are no longer any indoor events planned to test the safe return of fans, with the other government pilots all involving outdoor arenas in football, rugby union, cricket, horse racing and speeding.</p>

<p>Newcastle Eagles managing director Paul Blake said: ‘It is hugely disappointing that we’re unable to welcome back fans following all the work that has gone on behind the scenes in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>‘This time last week we were still confident that the game against Sheffield would go ahead in front of 800 people but the situation has changed significantly in the last few days.</p>

<p>‘We’ve been braced for this decision in the last 48 hours and the confirmation from the DCMS this morning means our hands are tied.</p>

<p>‘We fully support the move to safeguard public health but we also know that our loyal supporters have been looking forward to a return to the Eagles Community Arena for some time.’</p>

<p>The local lockdown in the North East means the exhibition game will now be without fans</p>
