<p>The suspect initially fled the scene but a 50-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.</p>

<p>Officers also found two women pedestrians who had been involved in a collision with a vehicle. One woman suffered serious injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening while the other woman received minor injuries.</p>

<p>A man left with potentially 'life-changing injuries' is among five people in hospital following a stabbing attack outside a pub in Plymouth last night</p>

<p>All five people were taken to Derriford Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Armed police initially carried out a search at a property in Breacon Park but found the suspect was not at the address, the force said.</p>

<p>Officers later stopped a man in a vehicle on the outskirts of Ide in Exeter, almost 40 miles away from the pub.</p>

<p>Superintendent Roy Linden said: 'As we carry out further enquiries into this incident, the public will see a police presence at several locations across Plymouth today, particularly in the Albert Road area of Stoke.</p>

<p>Officers rushed to the Stoke area of the city just after 10pm last night with reports of numerous casualties</p>

<p>'This will continue over the coming days, with our police community support officers continuing to provide a visible police presence to offer further reassurance.</p>

<p>'The victims are currently receiving treatment in hospital and their families have been informed.</p>

<p>'We would like to reassure the community that although clearly distressing, this was an isolated incident and is not being treated as terrorism-related. The suspect was known to some of the victims and we can confirm that we are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident.' </p>

<p>One resident told ITV: 'I live on Albert Road and drove home to find it closed but explained I lived here. </p>

<p>'I was told to go in and lock doors. Multiple police cars and emergency services including a helicopter and armed police.' </p>

<p>Another resident, Winston Churchslope, posted a video from the scene in the aftermath.</p>

<p>Speaking to camera, he said: 'Here on Albert Road looks like there has been quite a few stabbings.</p>

<p>'This is Albert Road in Plymouth and a few people have been stabbed and apparently one might be dead... </p>

<p>'Apparently the [suspect] is still on the run. He's stabbed people and run.</p>

<p>'This just doesn't happen in Plymouth.'</p>

<p>The suspect initially fled the scene but Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed they have since arrested a 50-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder.   </p>

<p>The residential road remains sealed off and witnesses have said that a police helicopter has been circling the scene </p>
