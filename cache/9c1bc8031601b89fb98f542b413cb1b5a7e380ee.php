<p>But now, Brittany Hockley is focusing on herself and enjoying a sunny getaway in Byron Bay. </p>

<p>The reality star, 32, took some time to answer some fan questions on Instagram on Monday, when one follower asked how she bought a house when she was just 22. </p>

<p>Back in paradise! The Bachelor's Britanny Hockley (pictured) took some time out of her Byron Bay vacation to explain how she bought a house at just 22 years old to a fan</p>

<p>'Firstly, it's okay if you don't have a house at 22. It's okay if you never have a house, it's fine!' she said.</p>

<p>'Literally no secret here. I worked really hard, got a big fat mortgage, continued to work really hard, sold my house and my big fat mortgage and then went travelling and then continued to work hard.'</p>

<p>In the caption, Brittany said she 'took a risk' when she invested in property for the first time. </p>

<p>'I just worked and saved from a really young age and got lucky with a great property. And no, I wasn't given a cent,' she said.   </p>

<p>'Also, having a house isn't indicative of success! Don't stress about this! What is right for one person may not be right for another!' </p>

<p>Wise words: Brittany said she was able to buy a house by working and saving from an early age while also getting lucky with a great property and taking a risk on investing</p>

<p>The reality star is currently staying in Byron Bay with her friends who run sustainable fashion brand Zulu and Zephyr. </p>

<p>She posted another Instagram story joking that she was dating Hollywood star Zac Efron, who has recently been living in Byron. </p>

<p>'Zac, honey! Are you coming to bed yet?' she said in the clip, joking that she had to turn down The Bachelorette because of the relationship. </p>

<p>Brittany has also been hanging out with fellow Bachelor star Laura Byrne, who is also enjoying a Byron getaway with her kids. </p>
