<p>The last episode of A Suitable Boy has divided viewers with Lata's (pictured) choice of husband - with critics saying they're 'disappointed' she picked the 'sweet, hardworking' prospect instead of her passionate lover</p>

<p>To the surprise of viewers (above) it is the 'hardworking and safe' Haresh who receives Lata's hand in marriage in the final episode - leaving some fans 'upset' that she didn't pick 'passionate' Kabir</p>

<p>One person wrote: 'That wasn't the one she was meant to be with! SO disappointed,' while another viewer said: 'Totally loved #ASuitableBoy. She chose a sweetie in the end, but my heart ached for Kabir.'</p>

<p>A third unimpressed viewer added: 'Just finished watching A Suitable Boy. I’m so upset. I wanted her to marry Kabir.'</p>

<p>However, a fourth wrote: 'Absolutely loved watching #ASuitableBoy. A wonderful series. Lata was right to choose the shoemaker, he will always put her first.'</p>

<p>Haresh (played by Bollywood star Namit Das), pictured, is a humble shoe factory foreman who is 'sweet' and always puts Lata first</p>

<p>But some viewers (above) were unimpressed with Lata's decision and felt that she should've picked Kabir as her husband</p>

<p>Many fans were overjoyed with the news and suggested Lata 'was right to pick the shoemaker since he will always put her first'</p>

<p>A fifth fan added: 'Lata chose to go with the hard working Haresh, leaving the dreamers behind. It was a happy ending, thoroughly enjoyed it #ASuitableBoy.'</p>

<p>A Suitable Boy, which runs to 1,349 pages, is one of the longest books in the English language, a sprawling and ambitious story set in post-colonial India as it discovers its true identity. </p>

<p>The story is set against the backdrop of rising tension between Hindus and Muslims as the repercussions of Partition in 1947, when British India was divided into two states, predominantly Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India, take hold.</p>

<p>The series has been adapted by acclaimed screenwriter Andrew Davies from Seth’s 600,000-word novel. Pictured: Kabir with Lata</p>

<p>After Lata tells her mother she won't accept an arranged marriage, viewers see the character searching for Mr Right.</p>

<p>In the final episode, she finally chases after Haresh following his confession that he won't be seeing her anymore since her older brother, who wanted a high society suitor to be picked, told him he was unwanted.</p>

<p>Running towards a parked train, we see Lata race to find Haresh before it departs.</p>

<p>Thankfully, she discovers him just in time and - to the disbelief of viewers - asks Haresh to marry her. He wastes no time in responding with a resounding 'yes'.</p>

<p>The final scenes show the couple getting hitched surrounded by their family members, with Kabir looking on from the sidelines.</p>
