<p>Digital minister Caroline Dinenage issued an appeal for evidence amid claims the boxes may encourage or lead to problem gambling among children.</p>

<p>Loot boxes, which can be purchased in many computer games, award players random virtual prizes which can be used to improve their playing experience. The chance element has raised concerns that the boxes could encourage gambling-like behaviour, particularly among young people.</p>

<p>The minister asked for evidence from players, parents, gambling charities and the industry itself. If the evidence confirms that loot boxes promote gambling, they could be included in a review of the Gambling Act. This could mean that the Gambling Commission would be able to intervene and take action.</p>

<p>In an article for MailOnline, Miss Dinenage said: ‘I am determined to ensure that we have enough evidence to understand the potential risk of loot boxes.</p>

<p>‘Do they promote gambling-like behaviour, potentially putting children on the slippery slope to addiction?’</p>

<p>This year a House of Lords committee demanded action on loot boxes. Its chairman, former BBC chief Lord Grade, told the Mail: ‘The Government must make loot boxes a gambling activity, because legally they are not captured by the Act. It’s teaching children to gamble, and kids love them.’</p>

<p>A report by the Commons culture select committee last year concluded that loot boxes were integral to the revenues of major games companies. MPs said loot boxes that can be bought with real-world money rather than credits and do not reveal their contents in advance should be considered games of chance played for money’s worth and regulated by the Gambling Act.The report highlighted a case in which one player of Electronic Arts’s FIFA series spent up to £1,000 a year on them.</p>

<p>The Conservatives promised action on loot boxes in their general election manifesto.</p>

<p>It said: ‘The Gambling Act is increasingly becoming an analogue law in a digital age. We will review it, with a particular focus on tackling issues around loot boxes and credit card misuse.’</p>

<p>However, the Government also recognises the important contribution computer games make to the British economy.</p>

<p>Video games are played by over half of the population and the sector is a key part of the UK’s creative industries. It contributed £2.6 billion to the economy in 2018, employed 27,000 people in 2019 and has grown more than 16 times faster than the wider UK economy since 2010.</p>

<p>The Government will also undertake further research into the wider impact of video games on behaviour.</p>

<p>Matt Zarb-Cousin, from the campaign group Clean Up Gambling, said: ‘Loot boxes have blurred the line between gaming and gambling. We need a wholesale redefinition of what gambling in the digital age actually is. The Gambling Commission will then be able to get to grips with this issue and protect children.’</p>

<p>Children are spending more and more time in front of screens... we need to consider how to protect gamers in a fast-changing space, writes CAROLINE DINENAGE</p>

<p>By Caroline Dinenage for the Daily Mail</p>

<p>Caroline Dinenage, Minister for Digital and Culture</p>

<p>Over half of the UK’s population are video gamers. This speaks volumes - there’s so much to celebrate about this valued industry which brings creativity, excitement and highly skilled jobs. It contributed £2.6 billion to the economy in 2018 and last year employed 27,000 people.</p>

<p>But video games and wider digital technology continue to cause huge change in society. Children are spending more and more time in front of screens. There are important discussions to be had about how we can help this innovative industry grow while protecting gamers in a fast-changing space.</p>

<p>Today is time to begin a frank national conversation about a small part of gaming which some people, especially parents, have serious concerns about. </p>

<p>Loot boxes are virtual containers within some video games that offer random rewards and can be earned through play or bought with real money. Items inside can include power-ups to improve your playing experience, or ‘skins’ - cosmetic changes to your character’s appearance. </p>

<p>As with a pack of football trading cards, you will always get something. But it could be just a common, low value item or it could be a rare sought-after one.</p>

<p>Some view them as straightforward micro-transactions which add to the enjoyment of a game. Others see similarities with the elements of chance in gambling, designed to keep people coming back for more.</p>

<p>I am determined to ensure that we have enough evidence to understand the potential risk of loot boxes causing people real harm. Do they push us to spend more money in video games? Do they promote gambling-like behaviour, potentially putting children on the slippery slope to addiction?</p>

<p>I want to hear directly from players and their parents about both the positive and negative experiences they’ve had with loot boxes. But I also want solid evidence on the impact they’re having, how many players use them and how often games include them. </p>

<p>I invite video games companies and researchers to come forward with their own data on how loot boxes influence the behaviour of gamers.</p>

<p>The government stands ready to take action should the evidence support taking a new approach towards loot boxes. The views and evidence we receive will provide a solid foundation for when we consider loot boxes alongside our upcoming review of the Gambling Act.</p>

<p>Of course developers need to make their games enjoyable and compelling for players. But children must be protected in this ever-changing digital world and we must put the right expectations on companies to design their products in safe ways.</p>
