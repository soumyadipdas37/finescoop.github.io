<p>University of Cambridge experts behind the device say it uses a form of 'artificial photosynthesis' - the process used by plants to convert sunlight into energy.</p>

<p>The device is based on an advanced 'photosheet' technology and converts sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and formic acid - a storable fuel.</p>

<p>This type of fuel can be either used directly in specially developed generators or by converting it into hydrogen, according to the Cambridge team. </p>

<p>The wireless device could be scaled up and used on energy 'farms' similar to solar farms, producing clean fuel using nothing but sunlight and water as its inputs.</p>

<p>A new device is able to take in sunlight, carbon dioxide and water to create a new carbon-neutral fuel without any outside source of electricity, its developers claim</p>

<p>Harvesting solar energy to convert carbon dioxide into fuel is a promising way to reduce carbon emissions and transition away from fossil fuels, experts claim.</p>

<p>However, it is challenging to produce these clean fuels without unwanted by-products that are costly and complicated to remove.</p>

<p>'It's been difficult to achieve artificial photosynthesis with a high degree of selectivity, so that you're converting as much of the sunlight as possible into the fuel you want, rather than be left with a lot of waste,' said first author Dr Qian Wang.  </p>

<p>Senior author, Professor Erwin Reisner, said storage of gaseous fuels and the separation of by-products can be a complicated process. </p>

<p>'We want to get to the point where we can cleanly produce a liquid fuel that can also be easily stored and transported,' Professor Reisner added.</p>

<p>In 2019, researchers from Reisner's group developed a solar reactor based on an 'artificial leaf' design, which also uses sunlight, carbon dioxide and water to produce a fuel, known as syngas. </p>

<p>The new technology looks and behaves quite similarly to the artificial leaf but works in a different way and produces formic acid.</p>

<p>While the artificial leaf used components from solar cells, the new device doesn't require these components and relies solely on photocatalysts embedded on a sheet to produce a so-called photocatalyst sheet. </p>

<p>The sheets are made up of semiconductor powders, which can be prepared in large quantities easily and cost-effectively.</p>

<p>In addition, this new technology is more robust and produces clean fuel that is easier to store and shows potential for producing fuel products at scale. </p>

<p>Dr Qian Wang (pictured) and her colleagues have developed a standalone device that converts sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into a carbon-neutral fuel, without requiring any additional components or electricity</p>

<p>The test unit is about three square inches in size, but the researchers say that it should be relatively straightforward to scale it up to several square feet. </p>

<p>In addition, the formic acid can be accumulated in solution, and be chemically converted into different types of fuel.</p>

<p>'We were surprised how well it worked in terms of its selectivity - it produced almost no by-products,' said Wang. 'Sometimes things don't work as well as you expected, but this was a rare case where it actually worked better.'</p>

<p>Thee device is easy to make and relatively stable, according to the study authors.  </p>

<p>The test unit is about three square inches in size, but the researchers say that it should be relatively straightforward to scale it up to several square feet</p>

<p>While this technology will be easier to scale up than the artificial leaf, the efficiencies still need to be improved before any commercial deployment can be considered. </p>

<p>The researchers are experimenting with a range of different catalysts to improve both stability and efficiency.</p>

<p>The current results were obtained in collaboration with the team of Professor Kazunari Domen from the University of Tokyo, a co-author of the study.</p>

<p>The researchers are now working to further optimise the system and improve efficiency and see if they can produce different solar fuels.</p>

<p>'We hope this technology will pave the way toward sustainable and practical solar fuel production,' said Reisner. </p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Nature Energy. </p>

<p>By keeping mosses in a container, such as those built by CityTrees, the conditions can be carefully controlled to ensure the plant is always thriving and therefore performing at optimum air filtration</p>

<p>CityTrees - also known as artificial trees - use living plants and different types of mosses to capture toxins and remove pollutants from the surrounding environment to produce clean air.</p>

<p>Mosses, despite being a more primitive lifeform than most trees and flowers, conduct photosynthesis. </p>

<p>This allows them to soak up carbon dioxide - a greenhouse gas - from the atmosphere and produce oxygen.  </p>

<p>They can also harbour friendly bacteria which further helps trap pollutants. </p>

<p>By keeping mosses in a container, such as those built by CityTrees, the conditions can be carefully controlled to ensure the plant is always thriving and therefore performing at optimum air filtration. </p>

<p>Each self-sustaining CityTree contains a water tank, irrigation systems and sensors to monitor plant growth and ensure they are healthy. The technology is powered by a combination of on-board solar panels and internal batteries. </p>

<p>Each CityTree which has the pollution-reduction benefits of 275 normal trees.</p>

<p>Similar structures have previously been employed in other cities — including Berlin and Hong Kong — along with temporary trials across London. </p>

<p>Plants also help soak up air pollutants directly. Studies have found that the worst offending air pollution for human health is PM2.5 or airborne fine particulate matter. </p>

<p>These particulates are dangerous because they can get deep into your lungs, or even pass into your bloodstream. </p>

<p>Particulates are found in higher concentrations in urban areas, particularly along main roads. </p>

<p>One study from researchers at Beijing Forestry University in 2017 found 'foliage acts as a bio-filter of air pollution and improves air quality due to the leaves’ rough texture and large contact area'. </p>

<p>But the issue with relying on regular trees and plants to filter the air and remove carbon dioxide and pollutants is that they themselves are highly dependent on the environment.</p>

<p>If they are not thriving due to disease, drought or vandalism, they will fail to clean the air effectively.   </p>

<p>Mosses, despite being a more primitive lifeform than most trees and flowers, conduct photosynthesis. This allows them to soak up carbon dioxide - a greenhouse gas - from the atmosphere and produce oxygen. Plants also directly soak up pollutants  </p>
