<p>The Uruguayan has less than a year remaining on his current contract at the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>Koeman is attempting to reshape Barcelona's squad off the back of a season without a trophy which led to the dismissal of his predecessor Quique Setien.</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa broke the club's transfer record by signing striker Rodrigo from Valencia in a £35million deal before securing defender Robin Koch for £11.5m from German side Freiburg.</p>

<p>De Paul has previously been linked with Juventus, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Napoli and Roma but a move failed to materialise and he recently extended his Udinese contract until 2024.</p>

<p>Barcelona's talisman has reaffirmed his desire to leave the club ahead of next season, with City currently the front runners for his signature.</p>

<p>City believe they can keep Guardiola on board for another three years by making the sensational signing, and Messi is also keen for his former boss to remain if he is to make the move to the Premier League. </p>

<p>The 23-year-old midfielder has been strongly linked with a move to the Red Devils this summer, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer plans to bolster his midfield options ahead of the 2020-21 season.</p>

<p>Tottenham and Barcelona are also believed to be keen on the Ajax star, who scored ten goals in 37 appearances for the Dutch Eredivisie side last season.</p>

<p>Everton, Leicester City and Aston Villa are among the clubs to have asked about the 22-year-old while Crystal Palace and Newcastle United are likely to be priced out despite their interest.</p>

<p>Edouard's representatives are due to hold talks over his future with Celtic ready to offer a new contract to convince him to stay for one more season as they bid for a 10th consecutive league title.</p>

<p>The Barcelona captain shocked the world of football on Tuesday by informing the Catalans of his desire to leave the Spanish giants this summer on a free transfer.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old has a clause in his contract which states he can leave on a free transfer at the end of each season should he want to, one which Barcelona claim expired on June 10. </p>

<p>The 27-year-old has been linked with an Atletico exit this transfer window, with FA Cup and Community Shield winners Arsenal believed to be at the front of the queue for the midfielder's signature.</p>

<p>The Gunners have already secured the services of Willian, on a free transfer from Chelsea, and are closing in on finalising a new deal to keep captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the club. </p>

<p>The 33-year-old iconic forward shocked the world of football last week by putting in a transfer request at the LaLiga giants after a 16-year career which has see him score over 600 goals and win 33 trophies. </p>

<p>The Catalans were planning on making a serious effort to try and keep their talisman at the Camp Nou as the first-team squad return to pre-season training next week.</p>

<p>The Inter Milan striker has been strongly linked with a move to the Camp Nou over the past few months and was widely considered to be the long-term successor to Luis Suarez in the centre forward spot.</p>

<p>Barcelona are having a mass exodus of first-team stars under new coach Ronald Koeman, who has reportedly told Suarez that he no longer has a future at the club - while Messi rocked the Catalans this week by handing in a transfer request. </p>

<p>Spurs paid £23m to sign the Ivory Coast international from Paris Saint-Germain in 2017.</p>

<p>But the 27-year-old had a frustrating first season in the Premier League with just eight appearances.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old Zambian scored twice for the Austrian side in their 2-2 draw with Jurgen Klopp's team in a friendly on Tuesday.</p>

<p>And now The Sun claim United have joined the Reds and several other big clubs in tracking him.</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed on Friday that Spurs had agreed a fee with the Midlands side for the 28-year-old's services following a breakthrough in talks.</p>

<p>But both clubs have now confirmed the full-back has signed a contract until 2024 and will wear the number two shirt.</p>

<p>Thiago has been at Bayern since 2013 and has enjoyed much success at the club, winning the Champions League, seven Bundesliga titles and four DFB-Pokals.</p>

<p>Bayern value Thiago at £29million, and Liverpool would certainly benefit from his creativity in midfield.</p>

<p>Watkins is Villa's top target in attack after scoring 26 goals in all competitions last season, with former Bees boss Dean Smith keen on a reunion.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old is believed to be valued at around £25million by Brentford after moving to a more central role last season, and has attracted interest from a host of other Premier League clubs including newly-promoted Fulham.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old is said to be Jurgen Klopp’s top transfer target this summer as he looks to reinforce his bench with Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah nailed-on starters.</p>

<p>Sarr has risen to the top of Liverpool's wishlist because of his ability to play on either the wing or through the middle - making him a more attractive proposition to Wolves star Adam Traore, according to the Sun.</p>
