<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leroy Sane admitted he felt 'a little sorry' to play a part in Bayern Munich's eight-goal thrashing of his former club Schalke.</p>

<p>Bayern's new £44million signing from Manchester City was on target as they opened their Bundesliga title defence in ominous fashion on Friday night.</p>

<p>But the winger said he had some sympathy for the club that nurtured him in the youth ranks before he made 57 first-team appearances between 2014 and 2016.</p>

<p>Leroy Sane scored his first goal for Bayern Munich as his old club Schalke were thrashed 8-0</p>

<p>The £44m summer signing broke clear to score Bayern's seventh goal at the Allianz Arena</p>

<p>'Of course, I was at Schalke for a long time,' Sane said. 'To get such a defeat at the start of the season and it goes so haywire is difficult.</p>

<p>'I'm of course a little sorry.'</p>

<p>Debutant Sane scored the seventh of Bayern's eight goals at the Allianz Arena after a Serge Gnabry hat-trick plus strikes from Leon Goretzka, Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller put the Treble winners in command.</p>

<p>England under-17 international Jamal Musiala became Bayern's youngest ever goalscorer, at 17 years and 205 days, by scoring the eighth.</p>

<p>It was an impressive debut for Bayern's principal summer signing as they started their season</p>

<p>Sane came through the youth ranks at Schalke before signing for Manchester City in 2016</p>

<p>'It felt very good to be on the pitch with the boys,' Sane added.</p>

<p>'It was a very good day. I feel completely at ease and knew that it would work out well with the team. Everyone was hungry.</p>

<p>'Everyone just wanted to attack and give full throttle.'</p>

<p>Bayern have now won 22 consecutive matches in all competitions, having achieved a Treble of Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League last season.</p>

<p>Hansi Flick's team are unbeaten in 31 games during this calendar year and last tasted defeat on December 7 last year.</p>
