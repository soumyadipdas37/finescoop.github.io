<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cameron Norrie booked himself a highly lucrative berth in the third round of the US Open on Wednesday night by achieving his best result at a Grand Slam.</p>

<p>The British No 3 is the kind of player who will properly notice the £123,000 prize money that accompanies making the last 32 at a Major, and he now has the chance to go even further.</p>

<p>World No 77 Norrie won a gruelling baseline battle on a deserted outside court when he ousted Argentina's Federico Coria 6-3 6-4 6-4.</p>

<p>Cameron Norrie achieved his best result at a Grand Slam by reaching the US Open third round</p>

<p>The British No 3 won a gruelling baseline battle against Argentina's Federico Coria 6-3 6-4 6-4</p>

<p>He now faces highly-rated Spanish prospect Alejandro Davidovitch Fokina, who at a ranking of 99 is nonetheless a relatively benign draw at this level of competition.</p>

<p>Norrie was once again showing the benefits of playing plenty of matches from July onwards and it was a highly impressive bounceback from the five sets it took to oust another Argentinian, Diego Schwartzman, in the first round.</p>

<p>Coria is the younger brother of one-time French Open finalist Guillermo, who reached No 3 in the world. </p>

<p>Coria was not in the class of Norrie and was eventually left behind, losing in straight sets</p>

<p>He is not in that class and Norrie was gradually able to carve him open using his left-handed angles.</p>

<p>Largely raised in New Zealand by British parents, Norrie is never more at home than on the hard courts of America, where he was a standout college player, and it showed.</p>

<p>It helped that he was able to save twelve out of 13 break points and he was able to fend off a determined fightback from Coria in the final set, who threw caution to the wind before being broken for 5-4 in the decider.</p>
