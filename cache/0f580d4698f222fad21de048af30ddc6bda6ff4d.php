<p>Slim: The 40-year-old stunned in a glittery gown from the Rene Ruiz Collection</p>

<p>Rebel has been on a health and fitness journey this year, losing at least 18kg (40lbs or 2.8 stone).</p>

<p>Last month, she highlighted her weight loss as she shared several photos to Instagram of her slimmer frame in a tight blue wrap dress.</p>

<p>The Bridesmaids star explained that she was inching closer and closer to her goal weight of 75kg.</p>

<p>'Thanks for all the love so far on my "Year of Health" journey,' she captioned the post.</p>

<p>'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself 'hmmmm...better not' and had a bottle of water instead.'</p>

<p>She added: '8kg to go until I hit my goal - hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'</p>

<p>Health: Last month, Rebel highlighted her weight loss as she shared several photos to Instagram of her slimmer frame in a tight blue wrap dress</p>

<p>The post comes after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.</p>

<p>'So for me 2020 is going to be called 'The Year of Health'. So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she told her Instagram followers.</p>

<p>'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'</p>
