<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dana White has hit out at Conor McGregor after the Irishman aired private messages between himself and the UFC chief in a series of tweets on Friday. </p>

<p>Former two-weight world champion McGregor took to social media to show his side of the story after UFC veteran Diego Sanchez, 38, called the 32-year-old out. </p>

<p>McGregor had plans to enjoy a 'season' this year, with the Notorious interested in fighting four times in 2020 following his win over Donald Cerrone at UFC 246 in January. </p>

<p>Dana White has hit out at Conor McGregor after the star shared private Instagram messages</p>

<p>McGregor ranted on Twitter about his decision to quit UFC, posting a number of screenshots</p>

<p>To Diego Sanchez... I seen your recent comments about your final bout and I am in! After you fought Pereira, I had requested for myself and you to compete in Dublin. This was back in February when I was working on opposition for my season, pre covid. Good luck this weekend! pic.twitter.com/Y0hf6Zr7XF</p>

<p>However, the coronavirus pandemic threw a major spanner in the works for McGregor and the UFC, with Dana White reluctant to allow his prized star to fight in front of no fans.</p>

<p>McGregor retired from mixed martial arts earlier this year, but published a series of screenshots of private Instagram messages between himself and White, which show the Notorious discussing options for future bouts. </p>

<p>'A fight late May in LA. Me and Diego in Dublin in August,' the messages read. 'Rematch end of the year. BOOM. Me and Diego in Dublin is a cracker.'</p>

<p>But White has not taken well to the Irishman's sharing of his private conversation to his 8.2m Twitter followers.</p>

<p>The Irishman had plans to complete a 'season', after beating Donald Cerrone in January</p>

<p>The messages showed that McGregor wanted a bout with UFC veteran Diego Sanchez</p>

<p>'I had people blowing me up left and right,' he said following UFC 253. 'I mean everybody here knows, I mean even the ladies, this is some man-code stuff but it's just something you don't do.</p>

<p>'It's just something that you don't do. It is one of the dirtiest things you can do.'</p>

<p>The messages showed White arguing that 'we should lose our promotor's licence' if he were to allow McGregor to fight Sanchez, an unranked veteran who would not stand a good chance of defeating the Irishman. </p>

<p>'Which, by the way, we were just talking about Diego Sanchez,' he continued.</p>

<p>White denied that fight and now McGregor has turned his attention to Manny Pacquiao </p>

<p>'And Diego Sanchez was in there in this private conversation that I was having with Conor McGregor.</p>

<p>'When you are the No2 or No3 ranked guy in the world, and you're telling me that you want to fight unranked 39-year-old Diego Sanchez in the main event of Los Angeles. Well...'</p>

<p>McGregor posted the screenshots in a bid to prove his efforts to arrange a UFC bout, but says that he has plans to return to boxing in a mega-fight with pound-for-pound star Manny Pacquiao.  </p>

<p>'Anyways boxing it is for now and I'm up for this! I hope no bottling takes place here,' he wrote on Instagram on Saturday.</p>

<p>'I'm already agreeing to these limited rules and holding back my full array of weapons. Let's get it going guys.</p>

<p>'Much love, the champ champ.'</p>
