<p>The tragedy comes the day after a 17-year-old boy drowned at an unpatrolled beach on the New South Wales mid north coast.</p>

<p>The teenager got into difficulties while swimming with his family at Diamond Beach near Hallidays Point, around 104km south of Port Macquarie, at 1pm on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Police pulled him from the water and started CPR, before paramedics arrived at the scene and took over but he was unable to be revived and died at the scene.</p>

<p>The tragedy happened at the same beach where a man, 38, drowned after getting caught in a rip earlier this year.</p>

<p>Around 248 people drowned in Australian waterways in 2019-20, according to the latest Royal Life Saving data released earlier this month.</p>
