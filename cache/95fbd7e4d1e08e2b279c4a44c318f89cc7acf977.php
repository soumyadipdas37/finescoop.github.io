<p>It caused a backlash from Gunners legends and fans alike, with Ian Wright telling Koscielny he should be 'ashamed' and Nigel Winterburn branding it 'disrespectful'.</p>

<p>But Koscielny has apologised for the stunt, telling French media: 'I had nine incredible years there, lots of memories with this club.</p>

<p>'I know that my announcement video at Bordeaux caused a bit of a stir, I want to apologise to the fans for that, I didn't expect it to affect them in the way that it did.'</p>

<p>The seven-second clip certainly caused a stir at the time, with Wright tweeting: 'This hurts. The level of disrespect… You should be ashamed for the way you've left the club after 9 years! Got what you wanted and still trying to have a dig… Hope it's worth it in the long run.'</p>

<p>Koscielny had spent nine years with Arsenal and was captain but agitated for his move away</p>

<p>He was unveiled as a Bordeaux player in more orthodox fashion a few days later </p>

<p>The 35-year-old has now apologised to Arsenal fans for any upset caused by the shirt stunt</p>

<p>Former Arsenal defender Winterburn said: 'Koscielny's departure from the club was disrespectful.</p>

<p>'As club captain and after being at the club for nine years, he should have known better.</p>

<p>'If he was revealing a Real Madrid or Barcelona shirt then I can understand but it's Bordeaux!</p>

<p>'As club captain you have a huge responsibility to your football club to lead by example in everything you do day to day, but particularly in what you do out on the pitch, and with social media, and the way things are now, everything is picked up on.'</p>

<p>Koscielny, 35, played regularly for Bordeaux prior to the early curtailment of the Ligue 1 season amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>This season he has twice captained the side in their early league games.</p>
