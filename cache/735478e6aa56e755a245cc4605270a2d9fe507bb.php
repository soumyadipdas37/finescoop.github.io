<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has confirmed that the Italian side are interested in signing Arsenal defender Sokratis. </p>

<p>The Greek centre-back has fallen down the pecking order at Arsenal and could leave as Arsenal look to generate more money for new signings.</p>

<p>If Sokratis was to join Napoli it could lead to Kalidou Koulibaly making the switch to Manchester City. </p>

<p>Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has confirmed the club's interest in signing Sokratis</p>

<p>As reported by Il Napoli Online, De Laurentiis said: 'We are working on signing Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Arsenal, we consider it an option.'</p>

<p>Speaking about the possibility of selling City target Koulibaly, he said: 'When there are important offers, we will sell.' </p>

<p>Sokratis has prior experience of Italian football having previously played for Genoa and AC Milan.</p>

<p>De Laurentiis admitted that Napoli are open to selling players in this window for the right price</p>

<p>If Sokratis was to join Napoli it could lead to Manchester City signing Kalidou Koulibaly</p>

<p>He has played 69 times for Arsenal since joining from Borussia Dortmund two years ago, but was used sparingly after last season restarted. </p>

<p>Arsenal have many centre-backs on their books, with another having joined this week in Gabriel Magalhaes.</p>

<p>City, meanwhile, are eager to secure a deal for Koulibaly, who could cost £72million.</p>

<p>Pep Guardiola's side have already brought in Nathan Ake from Bournemouth in this transfer window and Koulibaly could also make the switch to the Etihad Stadium.</p>
