<p>On Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kylie has been seen in the kitchen as she says, like her mom Kris Jenner, she loves making meals.</p>

<p>The mother to Stormi Webster does not seem to try too hard to cut calories, but she still has an enviable hourglass figure that she uses to promote her Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin companies.</p>

<p>Her shape could just be due to good genes or consistent workouts.</p>

<p>Her eating habits are in direct contrast with those of her sister Kim Kardashian who has been on the Atkins Diet, which limits carbs.</p>

<p>Kim, who will be 40 in October, has talked often about how hard it is to stay slender because she loves junk food like Kentucky Fried Chicken and In-N-Out as well as churros.</p>

<p>And sister Khloe, who was called the 'fat sister' has written an entire book on how to stay slim by cutting down on carbs.</p>
