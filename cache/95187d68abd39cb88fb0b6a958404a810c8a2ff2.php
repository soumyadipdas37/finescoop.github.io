<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>All sort of historical records have moved into view following a stunning 65 from American Matt Wolff that earned him a two-shot lead after an exciting third round at the 120th US Open.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old Californian, who turned professional on the same day 15 months ago as US PGA champion Collin Morikawa, is in position to become the youngest winner of a major since Tiger Woods claimed the Masters at Augusta in 1997.</p>

<p>He could also be first man to win the US Open on his debut since Francis Ouimet stepped out of his caddie’s clothes and shocked the Old World stars Harry Vardon and Ted Ray to claim the title in Boston in 1913. Spookily, that was also the last time the event was held in September.</p>

<p>Matt Wolff hit a stunning 65 to earn him a three-shot lead ahead of the US Open final round</p>

<p>The 21-year-old is on the verge of breaking a host of records if he can secure a major win</p>

<p>There’s more. If Wolff were to follow in the footsteps of 23-year-old Morikawa and win, it would be the first time since Bobby Jones and Gene Sarazen claimed the US Open and US PGA respectively in 1923 that two majors were won in the same year by players so young.</p>

<p>Naturally, there’s plenty that needs to go right in the final round today before the stats nerds have their day and the golf world shifts on its axis. Bryson DeChambeau struggled for most of the day but ended with a 70 and will start alongside Wolff in the final pairing at only two behind. It will be some slug-fest.</p>

<p>Sweet-swinging Louis Oosthuizen is like a golfer from another age, but he is only four behind after a 68, while Xander Schauffele (70), Harris English (72) and Hideki Matsuyama (70), three more players looking for their first major, are five back. Surprisingly, halfway leader Patrick Reed fell away badly with a 77.</p>

<p>Then there’s Rory McIlroy. The Northern Irishman has never received enough credit for his resilience and here was another classic example to continue the rollercoaster theme of his week.</p>

<p>Rory McIlroy showed resilience as he bounced back with a 68 to keep him in touch</p>

<p>After following his opening 67 with a 76, McIlroy bounced back into credit with a two under par 68 that left him six shots off the lead and pleased with his day’s work.</p>

<p>‘It was a really good round of golf,’ said the 31-year-old. ‘I executed my game plan well.</p>

<p>‘The idea was to hang on early over the difficult opening stretch and then make a score in the mid-dle. I feel like it’s put me right in it.’</p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine there will be a passage of play close to the majesty of Wolff’s incredible front nine completed in just 30 strokes.</p>

<p>‘Wow, that’s just amazing, I didn’t see anyone shooting close to that for the outward half,’ said an impressed McIlroy.</p>

<p>Last month, on his major championship debut, Wolff’s tied fourth place finish was overshadowed by the victory claimed by his friendly rival from their amateur days.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Wolff achieved a unique landmark, becoming the first man in major championship history to start his career with five scores in the 60s.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old could become the youngest player to win a major since Tiger Woods in 1997</p>

<p>Here Wolff, with his unique trigger motion to start his back-swing, responded to the temerity of the sequence being broken with a 74 on Friday with five birdies over the outward half.</p>

<p>The stats said he hit just two out of 14 fairways on the day, but that’s a travesty.</p>

<p>On at least a half-dozen he finished in the semi-rough, and his iron shots were quite magnificent. Adding to the sense of wonder, Wolff actually missed two putts inside 12ft on that front nine as well.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the back nine was more prosaic and there were a few nervous swings on the home stretch, but Wolff, who won his third event as a pro last year by holing a 25ft putt to defeat Morikawa, re-mains in position.</p>

<p>A good omen is the last four players aged 24 or younger who led the US Open after 54 holes — Ernie Els, Tiger, Rory, and Jordan Spieth — all went on to win.</p>

<p>There was a third amateur who turned pro on the same day as Wolff and Morikawa. Norwegian Viktor Hovland finished as the leading amateur at the US Open last year — as well as the Masters — and is tied 10th at Winged Foot following a 70.</p>

<p>Bryson DeChambeau struggled for most of the day but ended with a 70 and will contest Wolff</p>

<p>Are we on the cusp of welcoming a Big Three for the modern era?</p>

<p>Only three of the 13 Englishmen playing on Thursday made the halfway cut and none will begin the final round in the top 20.</p>

<p>Considering he’s playing his first event in America since March and is now 47 years old, Lee Westwood is turning in a commendable show.</p>

<p>He shot 72 to be on the same score as Paul Casey, who had a remarkable 69, recovering from being five over par after seven to post six birdies thereafter.</p>

<p>The par are tied 21st while Matt Wallace shot 73 and is tied 34th.</p>
