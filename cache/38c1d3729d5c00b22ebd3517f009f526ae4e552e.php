<p>In her latest YouTube video, Katie Price, 42, is seen taking her daughter Princess, 13, for a day at the spa, and comparing her broken feet to 'something out of the movie Saw'</p>

<p>'It's literally like from her heel down to there is like a massive scar like outside the skin,' was Princess' graphic explaination.</p>

<p>Painting a further picture, Katie admitted: 'It looks like something out of the movie Saw.'</p>

<p>Saw is a 2004 torture porn horror film in which a man has to slice off his own foot in order to escape a trap, set by a serial killer.</p>

<p>The film launched a super-successful franchise of movies that were released every Halloween for seven successive years, all with similar themes of civilians having to go through acts of violence - to themselves or to others - in order to survive a 'game'.</p>

<p>Katie, meanwhile, was seen enjoying a lunch date with her Love Island star boyfriend Carl Woods at Mayfair's swanky Novikov restaurant on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Katie is also getting around on a scooter. She is currently in the middle of a two year driving ban.</p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'Katie will be able to claim back a bit of independence. The scooter has been given a total make over by Robbie at Valetmagic...</p>

<p>They said: 'I can confirm that Katie has not returned to social media.  Katie's team posted the Instagram and this was not posted by Katie herself.</p>

<p>'It was  filmed prior to her hiatus.'  </p>
