<p>New man: Tiffany was snapped last month on a loved-up, sun-drenched jaunt in the South Of France with the mystery blond hunk</p>

<p>Coupled up: The hunk in question is 25-year-old footballer Cameron</p>

<p>Spotted: The pair were spotted out and about on Tuesday, shopping in London</p>

<p>Cosy: Tiffany, 26, held hands with the midfielder as they strolled along brandishing shopping bags</p>

<p>Tiff has been away in the countryside filming the new series of Made In Chelsea - set to return to screens next month.</p>

<p>It's not known whether Cameron will appear alongside her on the show - although show bosses are reportedly keen that he does.</p>

<p>The pair - who had just been to the gym together in West London - looked very loved up when they were on their French getaway together in August. </p>

<p>Multi-tasking: They put on an equally sporty display - Tiff in a black top and grey skinny gym shorts, a black leather jacket, shoulder purse and trainers added to the look</p>

<p>Hunky: Cameron plays for Dutch side Oostende and used to play on the youth side for Chelsea FC</p>

<p>Stroll: He wore a black and orange Tee. He added shorts and trainers to the look as he walked alongside Tiffany</p>

<p>They were pictured packing on the PDA as they hit the beach while staying at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in the South Of France.</p>

<p>Tiffany was on a tour around Europe, having already travelled to Italy with her friend and Amsterdam with her sister, Lucy Watson, 29.  </p>

<p>Tiffany returned to MIC earlier this year as a single girl following her split from her boyfriend, whose identity she kept largely secret on social media. She had a brief fling with Miles Nazaire.  </p>

<p>Discussing her return, Tiffany told OK! Magazine: 'I had a solid two years away from filming the show which actually has gone really quickly.  </p>

<p>'But I have always kept in contact with the producers of the show, chatted to them every couple of months.</p>

<p>Reunited: Tiff has been away in the countryside filming the new series of Made In Chelsea - set to return to screens next month. It's not known whether Cameron will appear alongside her on the show</p>

<p>Starring role? Show bosses are reportedly keen that Cameron crops up on MIC</p>

<p>Out and about: The pair - who had just been to the gym together in West London - looked very loved up when they were on their French getaway together in August</p>

<p>'And then I was in a serious relationship. And he was a private person. And when you're on Made In Chelsea it's not really fair unless you share your whole life. With that relationship I wasn't able to share that huge part of my life.'</p>

<p>Upon her reunion with the cast, she ruffled feathers with Zara McDermott - her ex Sam Thompson's girlfriend. </p>

<p>During the show's finale, Love Island star Zara, 23, expressed her frustration as she thought Tiff overstepped the mark by inviting Sam, 28, out for a drink with her dad Clive.</p>

<p>The former couple dated on and off for two and a half years before splitting for good in 2017. Tiff went on to have another long-term relationship but things ended at the start of this year.</p>

<p>CBB star Sam confessed he had shared a taxi with 'the love of his life' and told her she was 'the best thing to ever happen' to him, leaving an emotional Zara in floods of tears.</p>
