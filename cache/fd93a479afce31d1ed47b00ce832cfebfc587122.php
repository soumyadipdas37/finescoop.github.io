<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump said Thursday morning that Joe Biden does not have enough energy to run the country, climbing the Democratic nominee is taking the day off from the campaign trail because he needs to rest.</p>

<p>'Sleepy Joe Biden just closed down his campaign for the day (Again). Wants to rest!' Trump tweeted.</p>

<p>'He is a very LOW ENERGY INDIVIDUAL, and our Country cannot make it in these exciting, but complex and competitive times, with a Low Energy President !!!' he added.</p>

<p>Biden, 77, said Wednesday he is spending the day off the trail Thursday to begin more intense debate preparation.</p>

<p>'I started to prepare but I haven't gotten into it really heavily, we'll be beginning tomorrow,' Biden told reporters as he boarded a flight to North Carolina on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Trump said Thursday morning that he is at a disadvantage in the upcoming debates due to Biden's near-half century of experience in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>'I think I'm the one without experience,' Trump told coned to Fox News host Brian Kilmeade during a live call-in on his radio show. 'He's been doing this for 47 years plus.'</p>

<p>'He has a tremendous advantage if you think about it,' the president continued, then employed his critical nickname of his primary competitor. 'The guy with the advantage is sleepy Joe Biden.' </p>

<p>Donald Trump slammed 'sleepy Joe Biden' for taking a day break from the campaign trail, claiming 'our Country cannot make it... with a Low Energy President!!!'</p>

<p> Biden said Wednesday that he would be off the campaign trail on Thursday to begin more intense debate preparation ahead of the three presidential debates against Trump </p>

<p>Biden served as a U.S. Senator from Delaware for 36 years and immediately following served for eight years as Barack Obama's vice president.</p>

<p>Trump's first foray into public service was winning the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>The 74-year-old president and Biden will face-off in their first in-person matchup on Tuesday in Cleveland, Ohio where Fox News host Chris Wallace will host the first debate of the 2020 general election season.</p>

<p>The president has done several one-on-one interviews with the 'Fox News Sunday' host who is known for grilling his political interviewees.</p>

<p>Biden, however, has been invited several times to sit down with Wallace and has declined to do so – as he continues to dodge many live interview television requests.</p>

<p>Kilmeade suggested Trump could have an advantage in the first debate since he has become used to Wallace questioning style and is more familiar personally with the host.</p>

<p>Trump pushed back against this claim.</p>

<p>'Chris likes me because his world is all about ratings,' Trump insisted, adding that his interviews with Wallace draw large viewership.</p>

<p>'I would be willing to bet that he won't ask Biden tough questions,' he continued to Kilmeade, insulting his fellow Fox News host.</p>

<p>Trump insisted Thursday he is at a 'tremendous disadvantage' in the presidential debates because Biden has nearly a half-century of experience in public service</p>

<p>'But he'll be controlled by the radical left,' Trump said of Wallace.</p>

<p>Kilmeade defended his colleague: 'I can tell you for sure that he's not controlled by anyone.'</p>

<p>There are two other presidential debates before the election on November 3.</p>

<p>Trump and Biden will meet in Miami, Florida on the evening of Thursday, October 15, where C-SPAN's Steve Scully will moderate the town hall meeting format for the debate.</p>

<p>The third and final debate will be held in Nashville, Tennessee October 22 and will be hosted by NBC's Kirsten Welker.</p>
