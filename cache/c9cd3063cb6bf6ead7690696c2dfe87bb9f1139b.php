<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Junior MasterChef Australia is coming soon to Channel 10. </p>

<p>And in a new promo which aired on Monday night, eagle eyed fans spotted a familiar face among the budding culinary stars.</p>

<p>It was none other than 2018 MasterChef winner Sashi Cheliah’s 11-year-old son Ryan, who is set to compete on the hit cooking show. </p>

<p>Keeping it in the family: 2018 MasterChef winner Sashi Cheliah’s (right) 11-year-old son Ryan (left) is set to compete on Junior MasterChef </p>

<p>Fans may recognise him from his appearance on his dad's season of MasterChef during the family reunion. </p>

<p>Taking after his dad, Ryan revealed that he had cooked 'chicken that’s been marinated in Chinese/Malaysian flavours' for the judges. </p>

<p>Sashi's Adelaide based restaurant Gaja by Sashi is influenced by 'Indian, Singaporean and Malaysian classics'.  </p>

<p>While Sashi always had a passion for cooking, it wasn't until he migrated to Australia from Singapore with his wife, Rabicca and two sons, Ryan and Marcus, 13, that he really began to cook regularly.</p>

<p>A cut above: Taking after his dad, Ryan (pictured) revealed that he had cooked 'chicken that’s been marinated in Chinese/Malaysian flavours' for the judges</p>

<p>'When I moved to Australia, I missed eating home-cooked Malaysian and Singaporean kind of food, so I would make food like biryani and ayam masak merah,' he told The Star.</p>

<p>'Whatever I missed at home, I would try to cook at home.'   </p>

<p>And that passion has clearly rubbed off on Ryan, but time will tell if he can follow in his dad's footsteps and take home the top prize. </p>

<p>Junior MasterChef Australia first aired back in 2010.</p>

<p>It ran for two seasons before being axed, only for 10 to announce that the show would return in a revamped format for a third season later this year.  </p>

<p>Like father, like son: Ryan inherited his dad's passion for cooking, but time will tell if he can follow in Sashi's (pictured) footsteps and take home the crown </p>
