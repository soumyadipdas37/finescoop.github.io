<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The prime minister has revealed his favourite animal, and the curious reason behind it.</p>

<p>Scott Morrison made the confession after a weekend visit to the Adelaide Zoo.</p>

<p>'I am a big fan of koalas, I've got to say, I love koalas,' he told Adelaide radio 5AA on Thursday.</p>

<p>The prime minister has revealed his favourite animal, and the curious reason behind it. Scott Morrison's daughter Lily is pictured holding a quokka at Adelaide Zoo</p>

<p>'And I like it when they get the 'irrits' a bit, too. I find that quite funny.'</p>

<p>One of Mr Morrison's daughters joined him for the jaunt through the wildlife park.</p>

<p>'My daughter loves quokkas and she got to cuddle a quokka,' he said.</p>

<p>'She is still over the moon.'</p>

<p>The prime minister did not try his luck wrapping his arms around a cranky koala.</p>

<p>His government has launched a review into the endangered status of the native animal after koala populations were decimated by the Black Summer bushfires.</p>

<p>Scott Morrison loves koalas, but he also seemed quite keen on this wombat</p>

<p>But Mr Morrison's comments could raise eyebrows amongst his coalition colleagues in NSW.</p>

<p>The state's Liberal and National parties are at war over laws designed to protect koala habitats.</p>

<p>NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro recently threatened to blow up the coalition over the legislation before staging a humiliating backdown and falling into line.</p>
