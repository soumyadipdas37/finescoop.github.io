<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has revealed that the club are expecting to receive an offer for Thiago Alcantara 'in the next few days'.</p>

<p>Thiago has been heavily linked with a move to Liverpool, and Rummenigge admitted that the 29-year-old is seeking a fresh challenge as he enters the latter stages of his career.</p>

<p>Rummenigge told Welt Am Sonntag: 'We are expecting an offer from another club in the next few days.</p>

<p>Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says Bayern Munich are expecting an offer for Thiago Alcantara</p>

<p>Rummenigge says that Thiago wishes to 'try something new' in the latter stages of his career</p>

<p>'He told us that at the end of his career, he would like to try something new.'</p>

<p>Thiago has been at Bayern since 2013 and has enjoyed much success at the club, winning the Champions League, seven Bundesliga titles and four DFB-Pokals.</p>

<p>Bayern value Thiago at £29million, and Liverpool would certainly benefit from his creativity in midfield.</p>

<p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp would certainly welcome Thiago's creativity in his team</p>

<p>Liverpool have been rather quiet in the transfer market so far, with their only signing being left back Kostas Tsimikas, who joined from Olympiacos.</p>

<p>While Liverpool can call upon the likes of Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Naby Keita, Georginio Wijnaldum, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, James Milner and Curtis Jones as midfield options, the arrival of Thiago would provide Jurgen Klopp's side with an extremely useful option.</p>

<p>Thiago starred in Bayern's recent Champions League final success but the difficulty for Liverpool is that with the player out of contract next summer, they could negotiate a free transfer with him and his agent as early as January. </p>

<p>The former Barcelona midfielder is the kind of high quality that Klopp is targeting as he looks to successfully defend their Premier League crown in 2020-21. </p>

<p>Liverpool have also been linked with a move for Watford's £40million-rated winger Ismaila Sarr.  </p>

<p>Thiago was sensational in the run to the Champions League final but wants a fresh challenge</p>
