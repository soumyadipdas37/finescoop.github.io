<p>Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron defended a grand jury's decision to clear three officers of charges in Breonna Taylor's killing by saying that 'law is not meant to react to tragedy'. </p>

<p>Cameron discussed the outcome of his four-month investigation into Taylor's death on Wednesday, after the grand jury chose to indict just one of the officers, Brett Hankison, on three counts of wanton endangerment in connection with the police raid where the 26-year-old EMT was shot and killed on the night of March 13. </p>

<p>The first-degree charge, a Class D felony which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, relates to Hankinson shooting into the neighboring apartments during the incident, not Taylor's death.</p>

<p>Sgt Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, who were also present at the time of the fatal operation, were not charged.  </p>

<p>Cameron, who is the state's first black attorney general, said that the officers were not charged for Taylor's death because they acted in self-defense after her boyfriend fired at them.   </p>

<p>He said he understood why people were outraged by the incident, but said that had no bearing on the outcome of his investigation.  </p>

<p>'I certainly understand the pain that has been brought about by the tragic loss of Miss Taylor. I understand that as an attorney general ... I understand that as a black man,' Cameron said. </p>

<p>'This team, myself, and the representatives of the Attorney General's office have taken a lot of criticism and scrutiny. But that scrutiny in many ways was misplaced because there was not a day that people in this office didn't go to sleep thinking about this case.   </p>

<p>'Criminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief, but my heart breaks for the loss of Ms Taylor and I've said that repeatedly. My mother, if something was to happen to me, would find it very hard,' he added while appearing to choke up.  </p>

<p>At another point in his news conference Cameron cautioned against retaliation over the decision, which had already sparked unrest in downtown Louisville. </p>

<p>'If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice,' he said. 'Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice. It just becomes revenge.'</p>

<p>A person reacts after a decision in the criminal case against police officers involved in the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot dead by police in her apartment, in Louisville, Kentucky in March</p>

<p>People react in Kentucky following the grand jury's decision in the criminal case against police officers involved in the death of Breonna Taylor</p>

<p>What is the charge?</p>

<p>Charges of wanton endangerment are brought when a person is found to have recklessly engaged in conduct, without concern for human life, that puts a person at risk of death or serious injury. </p>

<p>'A person is guilty of wanton endangerment in the first degree when, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, he wantonly engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person,' state law says. </p>

<p>What is the penalty?</p>

<p>Wanton endangerment in Kentucky is a class D felony.</p>

<p>It can bring a sentence of up to five years in prison.</p>

<p>How are the charges related to the Breonna Taylor case?</p>

<p>The three counts of wanton endangerment were brought against Officer Brett Hankison after the bullets he fired inside Taylor's apartment traveled into a neighboring apartment. </p>

<p>Crime scene photos show the walls of Taylor's apartment riddled with bullet holes.  </p>

<p>Hankinson was fired by the Louisville Metro Police Department in June after officials said he violated policy by 'wantonly and blindly' firing his gun during the raid. </p>

<p>The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in the case. </p>

<p>Cameron gave a detailed account of the months-long investigation into the events leading up to deadly shooting, which he said had been pieced together by ballistics reports, 911 calls, and witness interviews, due to the lack of bodycam footage.  </p>

<p>The findings included: </p>

<p>Investigators believe Cosgrove was responsible for firing the bullet that took Taylor's life. Taylor was shot six times after officers barged into her apartment while acting on a search warrant for a drug investigation. </p>

<p>Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, opened fire when police burst in, hitting Mattingly. Walker was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, but prosecutors later dropped the charge.</p>

<p>Walker had told police he heard knocking but didn't know who was coming into the home and fired in self-defense. </p>

<p>Cameron said Cosgrove and Mattingly were not charged after investigators determined their actions were justified because Walker opened fire.</p>

<p>'According to Kentucky law, the use of force by (Officers Jonathan) Mattingly and (Myles) Cosgrove was justified to protect themselves,' he said. 'This justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges in Miss Breonna Taylor's death.'</p>

<p>The three officers did not take part in the obtaining of the warrant, he said. </p>

<p>The raid had been widely reported by the media as a 'no-knock' warrant however, further investigations later proved the cops had knocked before entering.  </p>

<p>Walker had also told investigators he did hear knocking, but maintained the cops had not identify themselves as police. </p>

<p>They knocked on Taylor's apartment door and announced their presence outside, which Cameron said was corroborated by a neighbor who witnessed the arrival.  </p>

<p>Getting no answer, Cameron said police officers 'breached the door' and gained entry into the apartment. </p>

<p>Mattingly entered first, and at the end of a corridor saw Taylor and with Walker who was pointing a gun.</p>

<p>Walker fired, injuring Mattingly in the thigh. Mattingly returned fire, and his colleagues began shooting soon after, Cameron said. Hankison fired 10 bullets, Cameron said.</p>

<p>Six bullets hit Taylor, though there is no 'conclusive' evidence that any came from Hankinson's gun, Cameron said. Bullets fired by Hankison traveled into a neighboring apartment. </p>

<p> The charges drew immediate sadness, frustration and anger among the community over the grand jury decision not to go further</p>

<p>Protesters began marching through the streets of Louisville, where Taylor was killed, after the announcement, shouting 'No justice, no peace' </p>

<p>Some members of the community were seen chanting as they reacted. While others sat quietly and cried</p>

<p>Just one hour before the decision was announced, the National Guard was deployed to downtown Louisville amid fears of unrest and protests </p>

<p>Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Taylor's family, called the grand jury's decision 'outrageous and offensive'</p>

<p>In the early morning hours of March 13, officers from LMPD executed a search warrant at 3003 Springfield Drive, apartment 4. This was Ms Breonna Taylor's residence. </p>

<p>The officers were advised by superiors to knock and announce their presence in serving this specific search warrant. Scope of the investigation did not include the attainment of the warrant by the LMPD criminal interdiction division. Federal law enforcement partners are conducting that investigation. </p>

<p>Sergeant Mattingly and detectives Cosgrove and Hankison had no known involvement in the proceeding investigation or obtainment of the search warrant. They were called in to duty as the extra personnel to effectuate the service of the search warrant. They only had information conveyed to them in their prior briefing. They knock and announced the presence at the apart.</p>

<p>Their statement are corroborated by an independent witness near to the proximity of apartment 4. In other words, the warrant was not served as a no-knock warrant. When the officers were unable to get anyone to answer, or open the door to apartment 4, the decision was made to breach the door. </p>

<p>After breaching the door, Sergeant Mattingly was the first and the only officer to enter the residence. Sergeant Mattingly identified two individuals, standing beside one another at the end of the hall. Male and a female. In his statement he says that the male was holding a gun. Arms extended. In a shooting stance. </p>

<p>Sergeant Mattingly saw the man's gun fire, heard a boom. Immediately knew he was shot as a result of feeling heat in his upper thigh. Kenneth walker fired the shot that hit sergeant Mattingly.</p>

<p>There is no evidence to support that sergeant Mattingly was hit by friendly fire from other officers. Mr Walker admitted that he fired one shot and was the first one to shoot. In addition to all the testimony, the ballistics report shows the round that struck sergeant Mattingly was fired from a .9-millimeter handgun. </p>

<p>The LMPD officers fired .40-caliber handguns. Sergeant Mattingly returned fire down the hallway. Mattingly fired six shots. Almost simultaneously, detective Cosgrove also in the doorway, shot 16 times. This all took place in a matter of seconds. In total, six bullets struck Ms Taylor. Medical evidence obtained by the team indicates that only one shot was fatal. Further medical evidence shows Ms Taylor would have died from the fatal shot within a few seconds to two minutes after being struck. </p>

<p>Detective Hankison fired his weapon ten times including from an outside sliding glass door and through a bedroom window. Some bullets traveled through apartment four and in to apartment three before some exited that apartment. </p>

<p>At the time, three residents of apartment three were at home. Including a male, pregnant female, and a child. There is no conclusive evidence that any bullets fired from detective Hankison's weapon struck Ms Taylor. </p>

<p>The ballistics analysis did not identify which of the three officers fired the fatal shot. After receiving that information, I asked the FBI Crime lab to conduct its own analysis to see if they reach the same results. </p>

<p>The FBI Ballistics analysis concluded the fatal shot was fired by Detective Cosgrove. Our officers looked at both reports to determine if there were major differences in the procedures used by each lab that would have led the FBI to identify who fired the fatal shot. Both law enforcement agencies used similar equipment and analysis. Each lab is highly respected for their work. </p>

<p>There was nothing our investigators could point to nor anything provided by the respective agencies that directly explains why one lab made the call while another did not. </p>

<p>I think it is worth repeating again that our investigation found Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker. Secondary to this justification, the KSP and the FBI ballistics analysis reached different conclusions creating a reasonable doubt in the evidence about who fired the fatal shot. </p>

<p>I certainly understand the public's desires for answers and many have questioned the length of the investigation. Simply put, we had to try every means necessary to determine who fired the fatal shot before the investigation could be completed. </p>

<p>With a thorough and complete knowledge of evidence collected in this case, lawyers of special prosecutions presented the findings of the independent investigation before a grand jury comprised of Jefferson County residents beginning on Monday and concluding today.</p>

<p>Along with the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, Taylor's case became a major touchstone for the nationwide protests that have gripped the nation since May - drawing attention to entrenched racism and demanding police reform. </p>

<p>Her image has been painted on streets, emblazoned on protest signs and silk-screened on T-shirts worn by celebrities.</p>

<p>The case exposed the wide gulf between public opinion on justice for those who kill black Americans, and the laws under which those officers are charged, which regularly favor working police and do not often result in steep criminal accusations.</p>

<p>Wednesday's announcement drew immediate sadness, frustration and anger that the grand jury did not go further.</p>

<p>The wanton endangerment charges each carry a sentence of up to five years. Protesters began marching through the streets of Louisville, where Taylor was killed, after the announcement, shouting 'No justice, no peace.' Some sat quietly and cried.</p>

<p>Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Taylor's family, called the grand jury's decision 'outrageous and offensive!'</p>

<p>'Justice has NOT been served,' tweeted Linda Sarsour of Until Freedom, a group that has pushed for charges in the case.</p>

<p>In the lead up to Wednesday's announcement, protesters have consistently pressured Cameron to act, and celebrities and pro athletes had joined them in calling on the attorney general to charge the police who shot Taylor. </p>

<p>Hankison had previously been placed on administrative reassignment, as were Mattingly, Cosgrove and the detective who sought the warrant, Joshua Jaynes. </p>

<p>At one point, demonstrators converged on Cameron's house and were charged with felonies for trying to intimidate the prosecutor. </p>

<p>The AG had previously refused to set a deadline for his decision on the investigation - which comes six months after Taylor's death.  </p>

<p>Earlier, as the verdict loomed, Kentucky State Police were out in force outside the historic museum, with squad cars and orange cones blocking the building as the verdict loomed. </p>

<p>Meanwhile in Louisville, officials had been bracing for more protests and possible unrest as the public nervously awaits the decision.  </p>

<p>In a midday press conference, Mayor Greg Fischer announced he will impose a 72-hour curfew in the city, from 9pm to 6.30am. </p>

<p>'No matter what Attorney General Cameron announces, I urge everyone to commit, once again, to a peaceful, lawful response,' the mayor told reporters. </p>

<p>While emphasizing he does not know the grand jury's finding, the mayor has declared a state of emergency in the city, and Louisville Metro Police Department has closed off much of downtown to vehicles. </p>

<p>A memorial to Breonna Taylor was set up in Jefferson Square Park in Louisville, as the city anxiously awaits the results of a grand jury inquiry into her death </p>

<p>Officials and local businesses in downtown Louisville braced for potential unrest on Tuesday, after Mayor Greg Fischer declared a state of emergency</p>

<p>Plywood covers the windows of downtown businesses as the city prepares for the grand jury findings in the case of Breonna Taylor</p>

<p>The mayor and police said they were trying to plan ahead of time to protect both demonstrators and the people who live and work there.</p>

<p>Courthouses, offices and restaurants were already boarded up on Tuesday in the mostly deserted blocks around the city's Jefferson Square Park, the site of regular demonstrations against police brutality that have spread across the nation.</p>

<p>Concrete barriers ringed the area, with a handful of checkpoints manned by police who would only allow people with essential business to drive downtown.</p>

<p>'Our goal with these steps is ensuring space and opportunity for potential protesters to gather and express their First Amendment rights,' Mayor Greg Fischer, a white Democrat, said in a statement. </p>

<p>'At the same time, we are preparing for any eventuality to keep everyone safe.' He emphasized he did not know when any decision might come.</p>

<p>Taylor, 26, was killed shortly after midnight on March 13 when three plainclothes officers used a battering ram to force their way in to her Louisville home with a so-called no knock warrant. </p>

<p>Fearing intruders, her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a gun. The three officers fired their guns, striking Taylor five times.</p>

<p>At least 10 bullets went into Taylor's apartment through a sliding glass door located in the living room and also through a bedroom window</p>

<p>Bullet holes and blood smeared on the walls could be seen in one evidence photo taken inside the apartment in the hours after Taylor was gunned down</p>

</ul>

<p>The city's main federal courthouse has also been closed all week in an order by Chief Judge Greg Stivers of the Western District of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Last week, the city of Louisville agreed to pay Taylor's family a record-breaking $12million in a wrongful death lawsuit that her mother Tamika Palmer filed against the city and its police department back in April.  </p>

<p>At a September 15 press conference announcing the settlement, Palmer repeated her plea for charges to be brought against the officers involved in her daughter's death. </p>

<p>'As significant as today is, it is only the beginning,' Palmer said. 'We must not lose focus on what the real job is, and with that being said, it's time to move forward with the criminal charges, because she deserves that and much more.' </p>

<p>In addition to the $12million, the settlement will also include a series of police reforms for Louisville. </p>

<p>Among the reforms is a requirement that police commanders must approve all search warrants before they are sent to a judge. </p>

<p>Mayor Greg Fischer stated that the settlement had nothing to do with Cameron's criminal investigation and said the city would be enacting reforms regardless of the outcome.  </p>

<p>'I'm deeply, deeply sorry for Breonna's death,' Fischer said. 'My administration is not waiting to move ahead with needed reforms to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again.' </p>

<p>As part of the settlement, the mayor said Louisville police officers will be offered housing credits to move to some of the poorest parts of the city in the hopes of improving community ties. </p>

<p>They will also be encouraged to regularly volunteer for community organizations and will face increased random testing for drug use. </p>

<p>Ben Crump, an attorney for Taylor's family, noted that the settlement was not only the largest ever paid by the city of Louisville, but also the largest ever for a black woman killed by police.  </p>

<p>'We won't let Breonna Taylor's life be swept under the rug,' Crump said. </p>

<p>The attorney also called for charges against the officers and urged people to 'say her name' - a phrase that has become a refrain for those outraged by the shooting but dejected by the lack of attention Black women have been getting.  </p>

<p>The lawsuit filed by Taylor's mother alleged that police used flawed information when they obtained the no-knock warrant to enter her apartment. </p>

<p>Police descended on her apartment after securing a court-approved warrant as part of a drug investigation involving her ex-boyfriend that allowed officers to enter her home without any warning. </p>

<p>Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, had been sleeping in bed when the officers served the warrant at around 1am.</p>

<p>Walker fired his gun when officers stormed into the apartment and has since said he thought he was defending against a home invasion.  </p>

<p>At the time, Walker told police that he could hear knocking on the night of the shooting but did not hear police announce themselves.  </p>

<p>Walker said he was 'scared to death' so he grabbed his gun and when the door was knocked down, he fired a shot that ended up striking an officer in the leg.    </p>

<p>Investigators said police were returning fire when they shot Taylor eight times. </p>

<p>No drugs were found at her home. </p>

<p>The city has already taken some reform measures, including passing a law named for Taylor that bans the use of the no-knock warrants. Police typically use them in drug cases over concern that evidence could be destroyed if they announce their arrival.</p>

<p>Fischer fired former police chief Steve Conrad in June and last week named Yvette Gentry, a former deputy chief, as the new interim police chief. Gentry would be the first Black woman to lead the force of about 1,200 sworn officers. </p>

<p>The department has also fired Officer Hankison, who is appealing the dismissal. </p>

<p>How the one Louisville police officer charged in the Breonna Taylor case could face five years in prison after being charged with wanton endangerment for firing into a neighbor's apartment</p>

<p>Officer Brett Hankison, who was fired in the aftermath of Taylor's shooting, was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment, Attorney General Daniel Cameron said at a news conference.</p>

<p>The charges stem from Hankison's bullets travelling into a neighboring apartment when he and two other officers opened fire.</p>

<p>They do not relate to the shooting death of Taylor. </p>

<p>Charges of wanton endangerment are brought when a person is found to have recklessly engaged in conduct, without concern for human life, that puts a person at risk of death or serious injury.</p>

<p>'A person is guilty of wanton endangerment in the first degree when, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, he wantonly engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person,' state law says. </p>

<p>Wanton endangerment in Kentucky is a class D felony and can bring up to five years in prison. </p>

<p>Hankison, who was indicted on three counts, could potentially face up to 15 years.</p>

<p>Before charges were brought, Hankison was fired from the city's police department on June 23. </p>

<p>Taylor's living room was left riddled with bullets after the March 13 shooting by police</p>

<p>The charges stem from Hankison's bullets travelling into a neighboring apartment when he and two other officers opened fire. Pictured above are the bullet holes found in Taylor's apartment </p>

<p>Crime scene photos from the investigation show a number of shell casings in and near the EMT's apartment after she was shot dead by police on March 13</p>

<p>A termination letter sent to him by interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said the white officer had violated procedures by showing 'extreme indifference to the value of human life' when he 'wantonly and blindly' shot 10 rounds of gunfire into Taylor's apartment. </p>

<p>He is the only officer to be fired and charged in relation to the Taylor case.</p>

<p>Hankison's two colleagues, Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, were not charged because the investigation found their actions were justified, the attorney general said. </p>

<p>Those two other officers were reassigned to administrative duties in the aftermath of the shooting. </p>

<p>In creating his account of Taylor's death, the attorney general said his investigators had no video footage from the shooting.</p>

<p>'Therefore, the sequence of events had to be pieced together through ballistics evidence, 911 calls, police radio traffic and interviews,' Cameron said.</p>

<p>Cop who was shot by Breonna Taylor's boyfriend emails colleagues to say 'the good guys are demonized, and the criminals are canonized' as Louisville braces for AG's decision on whether to charge him and other officers over her death</p>

<p>Sgt Jonathan Mattingly (pictured) who was wounded during the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in March told more than 1,000 officers that he's proof that city officials don no't care about them</p>

<p>An officer who was shot by Breonna Taylor's boyfriend when he entered her apartment in March, told his more than 1,000 colleagues in an email on Tuesday that 'the good guys are demonized, and the criminals are canonized' as Louisville braces for the attorney general's decision on whether to charge him and two other officers in connection to her death. </p>

<p>Sgt Jonathan Mattingly, who was one of three cops involved in the shooting, voiced his support for the officers and defended his actions the night Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, was killed. </p>

<p>Kentucky Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, said he will soon decide whether the charges will be brought against Mattingly and two other officers involved in the shooting.  </p>

<p>In the email, obtained by the Courier-Journal, Mattingly said that Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and top police officials had 'failed all of us in epic proportions'.</p>

<p>'Regardless of the outcome today or Wednesday, I know we did the legal, moral and ethical thing that night. It's sad how the good guys are demonized, and the criminals are canonized.</p>

<p>'I wish I were there with you leading the charge. I'll be praying for your safety. Remember you are just a pawn in the Mayors political game. I'm proof they do not care about you or your family, and you are replaceable.'</p>

<p>Referring to protesters, Mattingly, who was shot in the leg by Taylor's boyfriend the night police entered her apartment, explained to the officers that they 'DO NOT DESERVE to be in this position'.</p>

<p>'The position that allows thugs to get in your face and yell, curse and degrade you. Throw bricks bottles and urine on you and expect you to do nothing,' he added. </p>

<p>Mattingly claimed that the officers' 'civil rights mean nothing' to city officials, but 'the criminal has total autonomy'.</p>

<p>Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, told police he fired one round after Taylor's door was broken down and Mattingly entered. Walker said he did not know police were at the door.</p>

<p>Mattingly's attorney, Kent Wicker, said that Mattingly's email was 'expressing his support for (fellow officers) and their work during these difficult times'.</p>

<p>The email came the same day that Louisville officials prepared for more protests and possible unrest ahead of the attorney general's announcement.</p>

<p>The police killing of black man George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25 sparked outrage that has seen protests across the world denouncing police brutality, demanding change, and the end of systemic racism. </p>

<p>Floyd's death, unfortunately, is just one of a slew of police killings upon black men and women, including those who were unarmed and just going about their daily lives.  </p>

<p>In some cases body cameras were turned off, police departments have refused to share footage, and officers have yet to be criminally charged. </p>

<p>Below are some of the black men and women who have died by the hands of police in 2020: </p>

<p>Rayshard Brooks</p>

<p>27 years old, June 12, Atlanta, Georgia</p>

<p>Rayshard Brooks (pictured), 27, was killed by police in the parking lot of a Wendy's restaurant in Atlanta on Friday</p>

<p>Tony McDade</p>

<p>38 years old, May 27, Tallahassee Florida</p>

<p>Tony McDade, a black trans man, was shot dead in Florida just two days after the killing of George Floyd. </p>

<p>Though the details surrounding Tony McDade's (pictured) death are murky, he was killed on May 27, two days after George Floyd died under the knee of Derek Chauvin</p>

<p>According to the Tallahassee Police Department, McDade was in possession of a handgun and a bloody knife that was found at the scene. </p>

<p>But videos shared on social media by witnesses appear to tell another story.</p>

<p>According to Rolling Stone, one witness said on Facebook: 'They said "Stop moving, n****r," and then they shot him after he stopped moving.'</p>

<p>Witness, Clifford Butler, told WFSU: 'I never heard, "Get down, freeze, I’m an officer." I never heard nothing. I just heard gunshots.'</p>

<p>The identity of the officer who shot McDade has not been released due to Marsy's Law. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.  </p>

<p>The department later said that when the officer approached Johnson's car he exited his vehicle and his 'gun fell to the ground in plain view of the officer'.</p>

<p>Baltimore County Police say they recovered a gun from the scene and have body camera footage of the confrontation, which the department has declined to release. </p>
