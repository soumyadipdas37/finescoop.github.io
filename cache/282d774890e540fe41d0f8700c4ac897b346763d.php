<p>During the clip, the excited canine runs around the living room in circles before taking a momentary pause to stare at her new puppy playmate.</p>

<p>The dog then runs towards the puppy and affectionately nuzzles her nose against her new friend.</p>

<p>The two are now inseparable and live together with Ms Bailey, an occupational therapy student, and Bella, a cavalier king charles spaniel.</p>

<p>Ms Bailey: 'Luna grew up as the most well socialised puppy and always loved playing with smaller dogs, so we knew there would be no problems in her meeting our new puppy.</p>

<p>'In the video Luna is showing her over-the-top excitement towards meeting her new best friend.</p>

<p>'I was overcome with immense happiness and love at seeing them interact for the first time so positively.</p>

<p>'I also couldn't stop laughing, and seeing Douglas get more and more confident at approaching goofball Luna made me so proud.</p>
