<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nicola Sturgeon was branded 'petty' today for demanding  the words 'UK' and 'Britain' are dropped from the branding for a nationwide festival. </p>

<p>The Scottish Government has objected to the working title of 'UK Festival 2022' for the event - aimed at celebrating the best of Britain.</p>

<p>Initially announced by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2018, planning is well under way for the £120million celebration.</p>

<p>At the time, Mrs May said it would help to strengthen 'our precious Union' with events to take place across the four nations.</p>

<p>But it emerged yesterday that the plans have stalled after the SNP Government failed to approve the use of 'UK' and 'Britain' in branding for promotional materials.</p>

<p>Nicola Sturgeon's (pictured at Holyrood last week) Scottish Government has objected to the working title of 'UK Festival 2022' for the event - aimed at celebrating the best of Britain</p>

<p>The national festival planning is being overseen by Martin Green, who was head of ceremonies for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games (pictured)</p>

<p>Whitehall insiders say the cultural festival, which will celebrate achievements in fields including science, technology and engineering, will bring £12million to Scotland, with the creative contracts worth an additional £3million.</p>

<p>However, the contracts have been delayed due to the disagreement and sources say bids cannot be put out to tender until an agreement is reached.</p>

<p>A UK Government source said: 'The Scottish Government are causing unnecessary delays because they want to remove all references to Britain or the UK when we launch the next phase. </p>

<p>'It is incredibly petty and hugely frustrating. The creative sector is crying out for support right now.' </p>

<p>The wrangling comes amid a high-stakes battle over the future of the union, with polls showing the coronavirus crisis has boosted support for independence north of the border. </p>

<p>Ms Sturgeon says she has put aside the issue during the chaos, with planning for a fresh vote 'paused', but has faced accusations of trying to use the situation for political advantage. </p>

<p>A Panelbase poll earlier this month found that when undecided voters were excluded, 55 per cent favoured Scotland leaving the UK, with 45 per cent preferring to stay in the union</p>

<p>In the 2014 referendum - billed as a once-in-a-generation decision - Scots voted by a convincing margin of 55-45 per cent to stay in the UK. </p>

<p>But a Panelbase poll earlier this month found the mirror opposite.</p>

<p>When undecided voters were excluded, 55 per cent favoured Scotland leaving the UK, with 45 per cent preferring to stay in the union. </p>

<p>Overall, 51 per cent of those questioned said they support independence, 42 per cent said they would vote to stay in the UK and 7 per cent of voters were undecided.  </p>

<p>The traction for Ms Sturgeon's separatist cause has sparked growing alarm in Westminster.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak was dispatched to Scotland earlier this month to stress the scale of the financial support allocated by Westminster.</p>

<p>Figures published last week showed funding allocated to Scotland is much higher per person than that for England.</p>

<p>Spending on public services is equivalent to £14,829 per person there, some £1,633 per person higher than the UK average. </p>

<p>In another sign of the government's determination to strengthen the bonds of union, Mr Johnson spent his 'staycation' north of the border with fiancee Carrie Symonds and their baby Wilfred.</p>

<p>Event planning for the festival is being led by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport but it is understood ministers are taking a fournation approach with 'collaboration with devolved nations'. </p>

<p>Ten events are being planned, with at least one to be held in Scotland.</p>

<p>The Scottish Government said it had been 'engaging positively since very early in the process on this issue' and 'any suggestion to the contrary is unfounded'.</p>

<p>Nationalist politicians have urged Boris Johnson (pictured on a visit to a school last week) to drop the words 'UK' and 'Britain' from the branding for a nationwide festival</p>
