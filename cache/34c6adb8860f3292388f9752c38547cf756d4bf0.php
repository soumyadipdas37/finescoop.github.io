<p>A welcome addition to your bathroom shelf, the Garnier Micellar Water is a cult favourite skincare product. The solution cleanses skin and removes makeup using micelles (cleansing agents), which act like dirt magnets, lifting away makeup and impurities.</p>

<p>There's no need for a separate eye make-up remover as it will take off all your make-up, as well as dirt and pollution, in one easy step. Now is a great time to stock up on Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water as it's 41 per cent off on Amazon- making it a super affordable £2.95 for 400ml. Bargain. </p>

<p>The Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, 400ml is the number one bestseller in 'Face Make-up Removers' on Amazon</p>

<p>If you haven't tried a micellar cleansing water before then the Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water is a cheap, effective and popular place to start. </p>

<p>In fact, the Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water is the number one bestseller in 'Face Make-up Removers' on Amazon. More than 4,300 shoppers have rated the cleanser, and with a near-perfect score of 4.7 out of 5. This stuff is more than just hype. It works.</p>

<p>While not as nourishing as an oil-cleanser, the make-up removing Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water is a great time saver particularly when at the gym, on flights or when water isn't close to hand.  </p>

<p>Micelles capture impurities like a magnet and lift away dirt from the skin. No rinsing required. Simply soak a cotton pad with this cult favourite micellar water and it will cut through makeup - it's genius for removing waterproof mascara too. </p>

<p>The soothing fragrance free formula also leaves skin soft and lightly cleansed. It's also perfect to have to hand if you struggle to get a cat-eye right. If your liquid liner is uneven or you make a mistake, soak a cotton bud in micellar water and use it to tidy up your feline flick.</p>

<p>One happy shopper called this an 'essential skincare product', writing 'I have tried many brands of micellar water and toners and keep finding myself coming back to this one. The formula is easy to use, does not irritate my skin and does a nice job at removing my makeup including regular black mascara without having to rub or spend an excessive amount of time going over the area.'</p>

<p>The cleansing water is a one step way to remove make-up from the face, eyes and lip area</p>

<p>A second shopper raved: 'Really surprised at how good this actually is and have this on a repeat subscription. It cleanses better than any cleanser I know, even removing rapidly any waterproof mascara and and leaves a healthy, clean and fresh nice tone. Not much at all is required.'</p>

<p>'Always brilliant' wrote another 'Only thing I trust with taking my makeup off. Efficient and soft on the skin. I always buy these (two times a year) as most economical and lasts for ages.'</p>

<p>The 400ml bottle is enough for 200 uses so for just £2.95, it's an incredible bargain. Shoppers have even compared it to other more expensive brands, but without the premium price tag.</p>

<p>A third shopper commented: 'The best micellar water. I am a skincare junkie, I use the top brands, but I much prefer this micellar water to all the others I have tried. I have super sensitive skin and this is just perfect. It removes all traces of make up, especially mascara without pulling the eyes or skin.'</p>

<p>'Magic in a bottle' wrote another shopper in their five star review. 'This is like a miracle in a bottle. I actually love this stuff. Ideal for people with sensitive skin. Very gentle and leaves skin feeling so soft and refreshed. Great at taking make up off too (even stubborn make up). Best bit is the affordable price.'</p>
