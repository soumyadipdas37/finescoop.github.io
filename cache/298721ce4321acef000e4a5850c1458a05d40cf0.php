<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New Zealand's governing Labour party will introduce a new top tax rate if re-elected to help pay back mounting debt in the wake of COVID-19.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Finance Minister Grant Robertson announced a new top rate of 39 per cent tax for income earned over $180,000 as part of the party's long-awaited tax policy.</p>

<p>New Zealand's current top tax rate is 33 per cent for income earned over $70,000.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the policy would rake in around $500million a year</p>

<p>'What this policy it assures that we will not have harsh cuts to health and education and we can keep a lid on debt. That's something we need to give people certainty over,' she said.</p>

<p>The new tax comes as New Zealand, like many advanced economies, has racked up tens of billions of dollars of debt while insuring its economy against the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The proposed new tax bracket compares favourably to Australia, which levies high-earners at 45 per cent for each dollar earned above $180,000.</p>

<p>'This does put us at a lower tax rates than Australia,' Ms Ardern said.</p>

<p>'Keep in mind that this is about choosing an option that is best for New Zealand and our times ... we are affecting a small group at less than 2 per cent.'</p>

<p>The announcement will transform the country's election race, with Labour sky high in the polls for the October 17 vote, and hoping for a second term.</p>

<p>Opposition National wasted no time in attacking Labour for the move.</p>

<p>'This is just the beginning. Labour will eventually widen the net and come after middle income earners,' National's finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith said.</p>

<p>'National won't increase taxes and won't introduce any new taxes.'</p>

<p>Labour attempted to legislate for a capital gains tax during its first term but was knocked back by coalition partner New Zealand First.</p>

<p>The Greens, likely coalition partners for Labour after the October 17 poll, have announced a wealth tax which would hit the wealthiest six per cent of Kiwis.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether New Zealanders are turned by the tax promises, though Labour have offered a sweetener from their new tax grab.</p>

<p>Mr Robertson said if re-elected, a Labour government would not implement new new taxes or further increases to income tax during Labour's second term.</p>

<p>'The necessary borrowing for the COVID-19 response meant we could fund emergency measures like the wage subsidy, which protected 1.7 million jobs and gave businesses and workers confidence during lockdown,' he said.</p>

<p>'But we have to be careful about not running up more debt than necessary for our recovery.'</p>

<p>Mr Robertson said the new income tax would require someone earning $200,000 a year to pay an extra $23 a week.</p>
