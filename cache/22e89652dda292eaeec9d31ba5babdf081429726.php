<p>She said: 'When David Beckham played for LA Galaxy we went to a lot of games because one of my best friends is Victoria so we went to many games at the stadium all the time and that was a lot of fun...</p>

<p>'And now there's the LA Football Club which is the other team we have in Los Angeles and that stadium is beautiful...</p>

<p>'We went to watch Davids team Inter Miami play against LAFC. They have the most beautiful [stadium] - you feel like your watching a European team because we don't have that football culture in the United States. </p>

<p>'And that's the first time I've felt the same level of engagement from fans at the LAFC games. I go a lot to the games. I have so many favourite players, such as Messi, Ronaldo, David of course, Sergio Ramos. I like that he's from Andalucia.'</p>
