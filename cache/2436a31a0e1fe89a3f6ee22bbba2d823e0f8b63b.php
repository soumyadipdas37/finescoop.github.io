<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The three officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor fired 32 times after barging into her apartment, but only one shot was determined to be fatal, investigators found.</p>

<p>The Jefferson County grand jury on Wednesday announced the results of its inquiry into the death of 26-year-old EMT, who was killed in her apartment during a police raid on March 13.  </p>

<p>Louisville Officer Brett Hankison, who was fired in June, was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing into Taylor's neighbors' homes. </p>

<p>Sgt Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, who were also present during the deadly raid, were not indicted. </p>

<p>Louisville police have declared a state of emergency ahead of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's announcement about whether he will charge officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor (pictured)</p>

<p>In a press conference shortly after the grand jury's decision, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron gave a detailed account of the sequence of events, which he said was pieced together by ballistics reports, 911 calls, and witness interviews, due to the lack of bodycam footage.  </p>

<p>The investigation shed light into Taylor's final moments, revealing she was shot a total of six times while standing in the hallway of her home alongside boyfriend Kenneth Walker.</p>

<p>Earlier reports had said Taylor was sleeping in bed when officers barged in and opened fire. </p>

<p>It also confirmed cops did indeed knock after arriving at apartment 4 of 3003 Springfield Drive in the early hours of March 13. </p>

<p>According to investigators' findings, Taylor was shot a total of six times, but medical evidence indicated that only one shot was fatal. </p>

<p>'Further medical evidence shows Ms Taylor would have died from the fatal shot within a few seconds to two minutes after being struck,' Cameron said.   </p>

<p>Taylor's living room was left riddled with bullets after the March 13 shooting by police</p>

<p>The charges stem from Hankison's bullets travelling into a neighboring apartment when he and two other officers opened fire. Pictured above are the bullet holes found in Taylor's apartment </p>

<p>Crime scene photos from the investigation show a number of shell casings in and near the EMT's apartment after she was shot dead by police on March 13</p>

<p>Walker was determined to have fired the first round, striking Sgt Mattingly in the leg. </p>

<p>Mattingly was the only officer to enter the apartment, where he said he saw Walker holding a gun. </p>

<p>'In his statement [Mattingly] says that the male was holding a gun, arms extended, in a shooting stance,' Cameron said. </p>

<p>'Sergeant Mattingly saw the man's gun fire, heard a boom. Immediately knew he was shot as a result of feeling heat in his upper thigh.'</p>

<p>Cameron said there was no evidence to support that Sergeant Mattingly was hit by friendly fire from other officers. </p>

<p>Walker also previously admitted that he fired one shot and was the first to shoot. </p>

<p>'Sergeant Mattingly returned fire down the hallway. Mattingly fired six shots. Almost simultaneously, detective Cosgrove also in the doorway, shot 16 times. This all took place in a matter of seconds,' Cameron said.  'In total, six bullets struck Ms Taylor.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Detective Hankison, who was the only cop charged in the case, had fired his weapon ten times including from an outside sliding glass door and through a bedroom window. </p>

<p>Some bullets traveled through apartment 4 and into apartment 3 before some exited that apartment. </p>

<p>At the time, three residents of apartment 3  were at home including a male, a pregnant female, and a child, Cameron said.  </p>

<p>'There is no conclusive evidence that any bullets fired from detective Hankison's weapon struck Ms Taylor.' </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>ergeant Mattingly and detectives Cosgrove and Hankison had no known involvement in the obtainment of the search warrant executed on March 13.  </p>

<p>Mattingly was the first and the only officer to enter the residence, where he saw Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker open fire. </p>

<p>There is no evidence to support that sergeant Mattingly was hit by friendly fire from other officers.  </p>

<p>Mattingly returned fire with six shots. Almost simultaneously, detective Cosgrove also in the doorway, shot 16 times. </p>

<p>In total, six bullets struck Taylor, but only one was determined to be fatal.    </p>

<p>Detective Hankison fired his weapon ten times, firing bullets into apartment 4 and apartment 3.</p>

<p>At the time, three residents of apartment 3 were at home including a male, pregnant female, and a child. </p>

<p>There is no conclusive evidence that any bullets fired from detective Hankison's weapon struck Taylor. </p>

<p>The ballistics analysis did not identify which of the three officers fired the fatal shot. </p>

<p>The FBI investigation later concluded the fatal shot was fired by detective Cosgrove.  </p>

<p>Investigation found Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in the use of force after Walker opened fire.</p>
