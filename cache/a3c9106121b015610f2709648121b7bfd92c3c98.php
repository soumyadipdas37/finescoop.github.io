<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jock Zonfrillo may have accidentally revealed that Celebrity MasterChef is returning to Australian screens after more than 10 years. </p>

<p>The 44-year-old was speaking about Junior MasterChef on Fifi, Fev and Byron on Friday when he made the apparent slip up on live radio. </p>

<p>Radio host Brendan Fevola asked Jock: 'Byron's a great cook and he wants to know if there's going to be a senior MasterChef?'</p>

<p>Did MasterChef judge Jock Zonfrillo (pictured) accidentally reveal Channel 10's new show on live radio?</p>

<p>'You can apply for the Celebrity MasterChef!' Jock replied.</p>

<p>'He won't get in that one!' Brendan said, joking that Byron isn't famous enough.   </p>

<p>'You heard it here first, Fi and Fev, Jock just said I was a celebrity. So cop that!' Byron said.  </p>

<p>Remember this? Olympic swimmer Eamonn Sullivan (pictured) won Celebrity MasterChef in 2009, but the spin-off was not renewed for a second season </p>

<p>Celebrity MasterChef Australia previously aired for one season in 2009, recruiting names such as Rachael Finch, Michelle Bridges and George Negus. </p>

<p>Olympic swimmer Eamonn Sullivan won the series, which drew more than one million viewers each episode - but it was not brought back for a second season. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the MasterChef franchise in the UK has aired a celebrity spin-off every year from 2006 to 2020. </p>

<p>This year's season of MasterChef, known as 'Back to Win', owed much of its success to featuring high-achieving contestants from previous seasons.  </p>

<p>Celebrity MasterChef could also capitalise on familiar faces by bringing personalities from other Channel 10 shows like The Bachelor, Survivor, and Neighbours.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the third season of Junior MasterChef will air later this year. </p>

<p>Wow! In a Junior MasterChef preview, which aired on Monday night and was shared to the show's social media accounts, the budding chefs wowed the judges with incredible creations</p>
