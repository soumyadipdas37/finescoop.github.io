<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Anthony Joshua would notably vacate his WBO belt if that meant a fight with Tyson Fury was easier to facilitate, says his promoter Eddie Hearn. </p>

<p>AJ is currently next scheduled to face mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev later this year, but may then have to fight Oleksandr Usyk before an all-British clash with Fury can materialise. </p>

<p>The Gypsy King himself needs to defeat Deontay Wilder in their trilogy fight too, but with a two-fight 'financial agreement' already in place between Joshua and Fury, a mega all-British heavyweight bout could be on the horizon in 2021, whether all the belts are on the line or not. </p>

<p>Anthony Joshua could vacate a heavyweight belt to accelerate a fight with Tyson Fury</p>

<p>Currently a bout against Fury would be to crown the undisputed world heavyweight champion</p>

<p>Questioned on the dilemma of the WBO belt, Hearn told Boxing Social: 'There's been a lot of talk about "give up the belt," but the aim for Anthony Joshua is to be the undisputed heavyweight champion. </p>

<p>'Will a belt get in the way of him fighting Tyson Fury next? Probably not. Will he vacate a belt and fight Tyson Fury next? Yes, I believe he would if he had to, but would he rather maintain all the belts? One million percent.</p>

<p>'I know Tyson Fury has said, "I already had all the belts." I know, but you've never been undisputed. I hope that means something to people because it means a lot to Anthony Joshua if we get to a position where AJ is fighting Fury regardless of whether the WBO allows their title to be on the line.</p>

<p>Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn says AJ's priority is to keep hold of all his heavyweight belts </p>

<p>'It's almost like I want to go to Usyk and say, "Look, we're going to vacate the title, but can we vacate it the day after the fight?"'</p>

<p>Unbeaten Ukrainian Usyk will be the WBO mandatory challenger should he beat Dereck Chisora in their fight on October 31. </p>

<p>Though Joshua would take on Usyk, Hearn made it clear that the AJ-Fury matchup is the clash the boxing world wants to see.  </p>

<p>Oleksandr Usyk (left) will be WBO mandatory challenger should he defeat Dereck Chisora </p>

<p>Usyk is unbeaten but Hearn insists Joshua would have no problem fighting the Ukrainian </p>

<p>'Right now, the only way we can determine who the best heavyweight in the world is by AJ fighting Tyson Fury,' Hearn added. </p>

<p>'No one can dispute that. Whoever wins that fight will be number one. That's the fight that AJ wants. Would AJ fight Usyk? One million percent.</p>

<p>'If Fury got injured or if the talks broke down, or if for some reason that didn't get over the line, he will fight Oleksandr Usyk if he beats Chisora. But I know he wants to fight Tyson Fury.'</p>
