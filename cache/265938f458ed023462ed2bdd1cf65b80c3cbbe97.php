<p>If your skin has become extremely dry, cracked and irritated from hand washing, a hard-working hand cream could help</p>

<p>The little green pot may not be particularly chic, but it's chock-full of moisturising ingredients including a high concentration of glycerin that helps to draw in and trap moisture in the skin, which is necessary for it to heal.</p>

<p>O'Keeffe's Working Hands Hand Cream also contains allantoin, which is an effective multitasking ingredient that is a saviour for dry, itchy skin. Boasting several benefits including moisturising, soothing, exfoliating and skin-healing properties, this formula is a must-try.</p>

<p>Many shoppers have commented that it helps keep their hands nourished, as it soothes dry areas and helps to minimise irritation, so it's no surprise that the cream has racked up an impressive 9,300 five-star reviews.</p>

<p>'I bought this during lockdown as my hands were becoming extremely dry and painful from using so much hand sanitiser,' wrote one shopper. </p>

<p>'I'd tried using standard hand cream, but it'd cause my hands to throb with pain, and I'd need to wash it off after only a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>'It's worked wonders and my hands are now back to normal. I've used probably half of the tub, applying it whenever I felt like I needed to. I'd first apply small amounts to most dry areas (mainly between my knuckles) and then a bit more in my palm and rub my hands together. You don't need to use a lot of this for it to be effective.'</p>

<p>According to more than 9,300 shoppers, O'Keeffe's Working Hands Hand Cream is perfect for tackling dry and cracked hands that are in need of some serious TLC - and it costs just £5.65</p>

<p>'Best hand cream,' wrote another. 'Specially now with COVID-19 hands are dry from so much washing and using sanitiser, this cream saves my hands.'</p>

<p>A third shopper added: 'My hands get so dry so easily, but this is a miracle cream.'</p>

<p>Lightweight and readily-absorbed, O'Keeffe's Working Hands Hand Cream has an unscented and non-greasy formulation that works extra hard to keep your mitts in perfect condition – even hands that are prone to chapping and eczema. Plus, it makes an excellent foot cream for cracked heels, too.</p>

<p>It's recommended that you use the cream multiple times a day to keep your hands hydrated and protected from the elements. Apply and massage into hands whenever you need an instant moisture boost.</p>
