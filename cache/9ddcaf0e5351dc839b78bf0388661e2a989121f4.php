<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Queensland paedophile has pleaded guilty to forcing his step granddaughter to perform oral sex on him on two occasions.</p>

<p>The 60-year-old, who cannot be named, claimed he was drunk and suffering from alcoholism when he molested the 11-year-old over two days in the Easter school holidays last year.</p>

<p>The child had been staying at her grandparents' home in Redland Bay and told her grandmother what her 'Pop' had done to her the day after the second incident.</p>

<p>The grandmother contacted police and left a note at the home for her husband that read 'I know what you have done', Courier Mail reported.Â </p>

<p>Brisbane District Court heard the man had been pushed away by his neighbours after details of the assault became known and his house had been burned down.</p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to two counts of rape and six offences of indecent treatment of a child under 12 as a guardian.</p>

<p>Judge Vicki Loury QC sentenced him to four years jail for his 'appalling' actions, but ordered his release after 12 months.</p>

<p>'She was only 11 years of age. She was your granddaughter even if not a biological one,' she said.</p>

<p>'You should have been protecting her but instead you betrayed her trust in an appalling way. I accept you are remorseful for your conduct, but the damage has been done.'</p>

<p>The man will remain on probation for three years after his release.</p>
