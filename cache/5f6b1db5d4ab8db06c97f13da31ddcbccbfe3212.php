<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Daniel Andrews refused to accept ADF troops to man Victoria's catastrophic hotel quarantine operation despite repeated offers from the prime minister, explosive emails have revealed. </p>

<p>The premier previously denied turning down military help but emails from Prime Minister Scott Morrison's office show it was offered several times.</p>

<p>When the coronavirus quarantine policy was announced on 27 March, New South Wales accepted 360 troops and Queensland took 100 but Victoria refused any help, an inquiry heard on Tuesday.</p>

<p>An email (pictured) from the prime minister's office to the premier's office on June 24 shows the pair discussed the ADF support that was on offer. But Victoria declined to accept it</p>

<p>The Victorian premier (pictured) previously denied turning down military help but emails from the prime minister's office show it was offered several times</p>

<p>On April 8, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary Philip Gaetjens emailed his Victorian counterpart Chris Eccles to again offer ADF assistance.</p>

<p>Referencing how the ADF helped with security in NSW, Mr Gaetjens wrote: 'I am sure the Commonwealth would be willing to assist Victoria in a similar way if you wanted to reconsider your operating model'.</p>

<p>Mr Eccles replied: 'Thanks Phil' - but no request for help was made.</p>

<p>Instead, Victoria used private security guards who flouted social distancing rules, caught the virus in late May and helped spark the state's second wave which has killed more than 700 people.</p>

<p>It wasn't until June 24 that Victoria's emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp made a request for 850 defence personnel to replace private security.</p>

<p>An email from the prime minister's office to the premier's office on that day shows the pair discussed the support. </p>

<p>But the request was rescinded a day later after the Department of Justice and Community Safety took over the program.</p>

<p>A federal government submission to Victoria's hotel quarantine inquiry on Tuesday also shows that Mr Morrison wrote to the premier three times - on July 4, 6 and 11 - 'reaffirming the Commonwealth's willingness to provide ADF support if needed'. </p>

<p>The evidence contradicts Mr Andrews's claim in August that help was not offered.</p>

<p>'(It's) fundamentally incorrect to assert that there were hundreds of ADF staff on offer and somehow, someone said no,' Mr Andrews had told a parliamentary committee last month.</p>

<p>The premier declined to comment on inquiry's revelations on Tuesday. </p>

<p>He said he wasn't interested in 'having a debate with the prime minister'.</p>

<p>'The prime minister's representations to the inquiry - I'll leave that to the inquiry to make recommendations and findings about that,' he said.</p>

<p>About 99 per cent of Victoria's second COVID-19 wave, which has killed hundreds and led to the nation's toughest lockdown, can be traced to outbreaks at two hotels. </p>

<p>The decision to hire private security was made at a meeting chaired by Emergency Management Victoria Commissioner Andrew Crisp on March 27.</p>

<p>Recordings of the meeting were played to the inquiry on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'I suggest that at this stage we can manage this. The ADF will be just exactly what they are doing at the moment, helping us to plan for this particular operation,' Mr Crisp said in the recording.</p>

<p>'At this stage we don't see a need for boots on the ground, so to speak.'</p>

<p>He reiterated the decision in another meeting on March 28, following reports ADF personnel were patrolling quarantine hotels in NSW.</p>

<p>'I've said it before but I'll say it again, at this particular point in time we certainly don't see the need for ADF boots on the ground,' Mr Crisp said.</p>

<p>Returned travellers began arriving in Victoria the following day.</p>

<p>Mr Crisp told the inquiry it was Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton's preference to use private security guards and he wasn't opposed.</p>

<p>'I've worked with a lot of private security and my thinking was, well-trained, well-supervised private security in this type of role would have been sufficient and effective,' Mr Crisp said.</p>

<p>In his statement tendered to the inquiry, Mr Crisp said he was aware of 'challenges' with security staff as early as March 30.</p>

<p>During a meeting on April 4, he learnt there had been reports security guards were 'not following good social distancing practices and that a few breaches involving physical distancing and infection control practices'. </p>

<p>Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton, his deputy Annaliese van Diemen and their Department of Health and Human Services colleagues Jason Helps and Andrea Spiteri will give evidence when public hearings continue on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Last week the inquiry was shown shocking photos of quarantine guests walking freely to a convenience store from a Melbourne facility. </p>

<p>The images taken outside a Melbourne hotel were sent to Victoria Police Commander Tim Tully.</p>

<p>Quarantined guests were pictured strolling out of the hotel unchecked next to a street sign fittingly named 'Rona Walk'.</p>

<p>Commander Tully was sent one email by a former officer on April 15 reading: 'We have got the quarantined people out again this morning. One has tried to enter a convenience store on-site.'</p>
