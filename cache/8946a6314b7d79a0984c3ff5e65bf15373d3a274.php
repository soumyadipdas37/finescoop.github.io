<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>ITV is set to tumble out of the index of Britain's top 100 companies tomorrow, just as it celebrates its 65th birthday. </p>

<p>The broadcaster has seen an unprecedented slump in advertising during the pandemic, pushing its shares down by 60 per cent this year. </p>

<p>Slump: The pandemic has disrupted programmes like I'm A Celebrity, presented by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly</p>

<p>Its market value is now just £2.4billion, meaning it will probably slip out of the FTSE 100 tomorrow when a decision is made. </p>

<p>The pandemic has disrupted programmes like I'm A Celebrity, presented by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, which this year will be filmed in Gwrych Castle in Wales instead of the Australian jungle. </p>

<p>Love Island has also been hit. </p>

<p>Relegation to the FTSE 250 will mean several funds which can only invest in FTSE 100 companies will be forced to sell their shares. </p>

<p>Budget retailer B&amp;M, which has done well in the pandemic, looks set to replace ITV on the FTSE 100. </p>
