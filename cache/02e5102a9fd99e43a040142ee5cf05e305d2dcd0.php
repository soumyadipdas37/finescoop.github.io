<p>Halle  was diagnosed with diabetes after she fell dramatically ill while on the set of US series Living Dolls back in 1989.</p>

<p>After passing out one day, she woke up in hospital to discover she had been in a coma for a week with doctors saying her condition had passed beyond the stage where a diet change or new exercise regime would stop it progressing.</p>

<p>She told the Daily Mail in 2005: 'Diabetes caught me completely off guard. None of my family had suffered from the illness and although I was slightly overweight in school, I thought I was pretty healthy. </p>

<p>Worrying: The star explained that she didn't experience any pain and was suddenly left unable to breathe on set</p>

<p>'I fell ill - dramatically - when I was on the TV show, Living Dolls, in 1989. I felt I needed energy but I didn't even have a minute to pop out and get a chocolate bar. I didn't really know what was wrong. </p>

<p>'I thought I could tough it out, but I couldn't have been more wrong. One day, I simply passed out, and I didn't wake up for seven days, which is obviously very serious.'</p>

<p>She added: 'They told me I might lose my eyesight, or I could lose my legs. I was scared to death, I thought I was going to die.' </p>

<p>Halle has credited the Keto diet for helping her manage her diabetes and is believed to test her her blood sugar levels with a pinprick a couple of times a day.</p>

<p>She wrote: 'The keto lifestyle offers so many benefits such as weight loss, (moms that's how we get rid of our baby bellies), appetite control, more energy and better mental performance. </p>

<p>'If you're like me, you can possibly reverse type 2 diabetes, you'll experience better physical endurance, better skin and also less acne if that's an issue.'</p>

<p>Making history: Elsewhere during the interview, the star branded her historic Oscar win as 'one of my biggest heartbreaks' as she remains the only black actress to score the top accolade (pictured in 2002) </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Halle also spoke to Women's Health about her Keto diet, she said: 'After being diagnosed with diabetes at 22, I adopted what I now know was basically a keto diet. </p>

<p>'My doctors told me I'd have to keep an eye on how I ate to stay healthy, and I took it to heart. I wanted to get off of insulin, so I decided to say goodbye to processed carbs and sugar like baked goods and white bread—and it has seriously paid off.</p>

<p>'For more than 15 years, eating this way has helped me manage my diabetes—but it's also given me a ton of energy and helped me maintain my weight and stay in shape.'</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high.</p>

<p>It can cause symptoms like excessive thirst, needing to pee a lot and tiredness. It can also increase your risk of getting serious problems with your eyes, heart and nerves.</p>

<p>It's a lifelong condition that can affect your everyday life. You may need to change your diet, take medicines and have regular check-ups.</p>

<p>It's caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin. It's often linked to being overweight or inactive, or having a family history of type 2 diabetes.  </p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes can cause health problems such as heart disease and stroke, loss of feeling and pain (nerve damage) – causing problems with sex, foot problems – like sores and infection, vision loss and blindness, miscarriage and stillbirth as well as problems with your kidneys</p>

<p> A healthy diet and keeping active will help you manage your blood sugar level. It will also help you to control your weight and generally feel better</p>
