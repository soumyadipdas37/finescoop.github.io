<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are giving a trial to former Borussia Dortmund winger Reda Khadra.</p>

<p>However, the 19-year-old was left frustrated on Thursday when United's request for international clearance failed to come through in time for the Germany U18 international to play against Doncaster Rovers.</p>

<p>Khadra was left to look on from the stands forlornly as United's U23s went down 5-0 at Doncaster's Keepmoat Stadium.</p>

<p>Manchester United have taken on ex-Borussia Dortmund winger Reda Khadra on trial this week</p>

<p>But Khadra could not represent the club in an under-23 friendly on Thursday at Doncaster</p>

<p>There are no more friendlies for Khadra to figure in with United's youngsters due to play Salford City next in the EFL Trophy on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The German right winger, who is a free agent after leaving Dortmund earlier this summer, will be allowed to continue training as United staff take a closer look.</p>

<p>He played 69 youth team matches for Dortmund in total, scoring two goals and providing 11 assists and scored in a UEFA Youth League clash against Derby County earlier this year.</p>

<p>Khadra has also had a spell training at Stoke City this summer.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old's international clearance was not approved in time for the Doncaster game</p>
