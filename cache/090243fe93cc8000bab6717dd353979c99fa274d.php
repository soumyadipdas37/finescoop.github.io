<p>While watching a news segment about the introduction of the government's 'rule of six', son Louis complained that young people shouldn't be blamed for the current rise in cases.</p>

<p>His sister added that it should be the 'small group of people' most at risk who should be isolating at home, which also sparked backlash from fans on social media.</p>

<p>Controversy: Gogglebox has sparked complaints to media watchdog Ofcom after the Michael family bemoaned the blame being placed on young people during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>

<p>Gogglebox returned for its new series on Friday after a summer break, with the Michaels' discussion quickly turning to the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>Louis complained: 'As long as they're not going clubbing and picking up 18/19 year olds and taking them back to halls, things will be fine.</p>

<p>'It seems crazy that they were putting out all of these schemes like Eat Out To Help Out and trying basically to get everyone back to normal, and now they're blaming young people.'</p>

<p>Drama: The family claimed that young people shouldn't be blamed for the rise in cases, and those most at risk should just 'stay at home'</p>

<p>His sister Alex agreed, adding: 'It just seems backwards to me because if there’s small group of people who are at risk of dying, then it should be them self-isolating - not the large group of young people. </p>

<p>'And also it should be their choice because if they’re aware of the risks and the statistics then it should be their choice whether they isolate or not. But to make everyone else put their lives on hold, it’s ridiculous.'</p>

<p>Viewers didn't seem to agree, with some taking to Twitter to claim it wouldn't be possible for many people to stay at home as they would be unable to work.</p>

<p>One wrote: 'Seriously not impressed with the views of the Michael family on #Gogglebox - typically so selfish of that generation. #COVID19 possibly even #COVIDIOTS.' [sic]</p>

<p>Seriously? Viewers didn't seem to agree, with some taking to Twitter to claim it wouldn't be possible for many people to stay at home as they would be unable to work</p>

<p>A second added: 'The Michael family. So bloody selfish and ignorant. I'll just give up working and hide in a box. Happy now?'</p>

<p>'They should ban them from talking about corona on gogglebox cus the michaels family saying why should people put their lives on hold to protect a few vulnerable people and that Essex kid who said ''keep old people in'' are angering me to no end,' a third tweeted. </p>

<p>Ofcom have now told The Sun they have received complaints regarding The Michael's comments, with some branding them 'insensitive' and 'derogatory'.</p>

<p>It comes as COVID-19 cases have seen a significant rise in recent weeks, leading to concerns the stricter lockdown measures could be introduced.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Gogglebox and Ofcom for further comment. </p>

<p>Gogglebox airs on Friday at 9pm on Channel 4. </p>

<p>Concerns: It comes as the family watched a BBC news segment about the introduction of the government's new 'rule of six'</p>
