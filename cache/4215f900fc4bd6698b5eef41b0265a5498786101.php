<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A kebab shop owner in Sydney's LGBTI heartland has been driven off social media over a homophobic meme. </p>

<p>Ziftekhar Hasan's business, Yilmaz Grill &amp; Bakehouse in Waterloo in Sydney's south has been the target of increasing backlash from neighbours after the offensive post was shared to the shop's Facebook page. </p>

<p>The page was then inundated with so many negative comments and reviews, even after Mr Hasan issued a grovelling apology, that he was forced to close the account. </p>

<p>Mr Hasan (pictured) said he has been seeing increasing backlash from locals after the post </p>

<p>'It came to my attention that an eatery in our building was posting ant-gay memes. I will not be buying from there again ... I urge the gays of the village to boycott this business,' one neighbour wrote. </p>

<p>Mr Hasan defended the meme which Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish due to its offensive content. </p>

<p>'It's not about me being homophobic it's just me sharing a meme that I've seen online,' Mr Hasan told A Current Affair outside his shop. </p>

<p>One of the shop's neighbours urged other locals to avoid the business </p>

<p>The business (pictured) in Waterloo in Sydney's south regularly hosts $15 all-you-can-eat nights </p>

<p>Locals, however, didn't seem to be buying the change of heart with one woman throwing eggs at Mr Hasan from her balcony across the street. </p>

<p>'You're a homophobe… Shut your business down now,' the woman then yells. </p>

<p>Shutting his shop down would certainly hurt Mr Hasan's back pocket - with the successful business earning him enough to buy a lime green Lamborghini worth more than $200,000. </p>

<p>The car, emblazoned with the store's logo, is one of a number of expensive vehicles regularly parked outside Mr Hasan's shop on $15 all you can eat nights he puts on for his mates. </p>

<p>Another neighbor said Mr Hasan deserved the backlash he was getting for promoting hate. </p>

<p>'It's kind of silly especially knowing the demographics of this place which is pretty gay friendly,' the local said. </p>

<p>Mr Hasan said his post was prompted after a mate of his was sexually assaulted by a gay person in 2014. </p>

<p>However, he also later brushed off the meme as 'just a joke' and said they were not his 'genuine' views when interviewed by ACA. </p>

<p>Mr Hasan's said the community should celebrate its similarities rather than differences and he hopes to repair his standing with the locals in his suburb and wider LGBTI community. </p>
