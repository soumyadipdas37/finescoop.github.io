<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling made a light-hearted joke in the first show of the season with a new-look line-up.</p>

<p>Sky Sports last month caused controversy after sacking long-serving regulars Matt Le Tissier, Charlie Nicholas and Phil Thompson in a bid to revamp the weekend programme.</p>

<p>The major shake-up of their punditry team for the coming season will initially see regular host Stelling joined by the likes of Paul Merson, Sue Smith, Clinton Morrison, Alan McInally and Glen Johnson. </p>

<p>But as revealed by Sportsmail earlier this month, Sky Sports will use the early weeks of the new season - starting from Saturday - as auditions for potential replacement pundits for the sacked trio before deciding on a regular panel.</p>

<p>However, in the first programme of the season, Stelling could only muster a joke to refer to the events of the last few weeks, opening the show by saying: 'The football league is back, Soccer Saturday is back, I'm back, Merse is back, but not everyone is back... the crowds are not back.'</p>

<p>Stelling has been joined on Saturday by former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood as a guest along with Merson, while Tony Pulis joined Glen Johnson and Clinton Morrison in 'The Circle', while Sue Smith was also part of the first programme of the new season. </p>

<p>Stelling will also be joined by some other guest stars along with Sherwood over the course of the season, including Wycombe striker Adebayo Akinfenwa, Robbie Fowler and Joleon Lescott.</p>

<p>The regular presenter however was left devastated by the sackings of his close friends Le Tissier, Nicholas and Thompson, and had even considered leaving the show himself as a result, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail. </p>

<p>Stelling's contract is understood to contain a lengthy notice period so he may start the season presenting the show unless he reaches an agreement with Sky Sports.</p>

<p>Charismatic Wycombe Wanderers star Adebayo Akinfenwa is also set to come on as a guest</p>

<p>The outspoken Tim Sherwood will also soon be joining the popular weekend show panel</p>

<p>But he was left stunned when told of Sky's decision to axe the his 'best mates', a decision which came out of the blue as they all had one year left on their contracts.</p>

<p>Le Tissier, Thompson and Nicholas were the second regular punditry team with whom Stelling had worked after the original line-up of George Best, Rodney Marsh and Clive Allen was dismantled by Sky.</p>

<p>Merson is the sole survivor and has been retained by Sky to work on Soccer Saturday, but his long-term position is unclear.</p>

<p>The long-serving Chris Kamara may also be deployed in the studio rather than at matches.</p>

<p>But even the normally cheery figure of Kamara could not hide the 'gutting' feeling he felt after hearing the news of the Soccer Saturday sackings in an exclusive Sportsmail interview.</p>

<p> Stelling admitted he nearly walked away from the show after his 'best mates' were sacked</p>

<p>Sky Sports' decision caused further uproar after it led to a torrent of vile comments on social media after pundit and former Arsenal women's star Alex Scott was earmarked as a successor.</p>

<p>New Sportsmail columnist Micah Richards also revealed that he found himself being blamed for the trio's removal even when he was not going to appear on the show. </p>

<p>The broadcaster has confirmed that while Scott will also not be joining the programme, ex-Doncaster Belles star Smith is in their line-up, joining female presenters such as Bianca Westwood.  </p>

<p>And in a recent interview, Stelling admitted it will be difficult for women to appear on the show due to the sickening abuse they receive.</p>

<p>When Stelling was asked by the Guardian whether women would struggle on the show he said: 'Oh God, yes. The response on social media is horrendous. Whether it be Sue Smith or Alex Scott the criticism is horrendous and totally unjustified. </p>

<p>Former Arsenal and England player Alex Scott has received abuse as a pundit on television</p>

<p>'When we had Soccer Specials, some of the women who'd come in had been very reluctant. </p>

<p>'They knew what the response would be, regardless of how good they were. There's this blinkered idea – 'It's a woman, what can she know about football?'  </p>

<p>'Twenty years ago I was also sceptical. But my view has changed and obviously we've had very good reporters like Michelle Owen, Bianca Westwood and Jacqui Oatley. They're really experienced.' </p>

<p>Sky however are conscious of the need for greater diversity in what has often been an all-white, middle-aged line-up. </p>
