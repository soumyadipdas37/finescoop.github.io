<p>The median price for apartments bought under the scheme was $475,000, which was much higher than the mid-point price of $385,000 for houses.</p>

<p>The scheme is available for individuals earning up to $125,000 with another 10,000 places available since July 1.</p>

<p>Couples aged 25 to 34 and earning $90,000 to $125,000 were the most prominent, with a $200,000 threshold for those in a relationship.</p>

<p>The First Home Loan Deposit Scheme was one of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's key 2019 election promises, which Labor backed. </p>

<p>Instead of having to stump up for a 20 per cent deposit, first-home buyers only had to fund a five per cent deposit with taxpayers underwriting the rest.</p>

<p>Teachers were the most likely to benefit followed by nurses and child carers. </p>
