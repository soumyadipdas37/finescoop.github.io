<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>In a legal filing last month, Britney Spears stated she wants 'a qualified corporate fiduciary' to serve as executor of her estate in place of her father Jamie.</p>

<p>And this week, the pop star submitted fresh court documents via her attorney requesting that Bessemer Trust Company, N.A. be appointed to the role, ET reported Wednesday.</p>

<p>It's her second attempt in two weeks to remove her father from having control over her finances. </p>

<p>Ongoing battle: For the second time in two weeks, Britney Spears has filed legal documents seeking to remove her father Jamie as sole conservator of her estate, ET reported Wednesday</p>

<p>As in the previous filing in August, the new documents stress that the 38-year-old is 'strongly opposed' to her dad  continuing as the sole conservator of her estate. </p>

<p>Jamie, 68, has been in control of his famous daughter's affairs since her very public breakdown in 2008. </p>

<p>The legal move in which a judge agreed to make Britney the subject of a conservatorship gave her father control over her estate and finances as well as the authority to make decisions on her behalf regarding her welfare.</p>

<p>In the new court documents, it's claimed that the conservatorship is 'voluntary' and that Britney 'wishes to exercise her right to nominate a conservator of the estate under Probate Code section 1810.' </p>

<p>The documents filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court go on to say that the hitmaker doesn't have a developmental disability and she is not a patient of, nor on leave of absence from, a state mental health institution.</p>

<p>Supervised: Britney, pictured in 2018, was made the subject of a conservatorship in 2008 following her high profile breakdown. The legal move gave her father control over her estate and finances as well as the authority to make decisions on her behalf regarding her welfare</p>

<p> 'Treats her like a child': As in the previous filing in August, the new documents stress that the 38-year-old is 'strongly opposed' to her dad continuing as the sole conservator of her estate</p>

<p>New request: The latest filing seeks to have the court appoint the Bessemer Trust Company, N.A., a qualified corporate fiduciary, to take control and manage her finances</p>

<p>On August 19, following a status conference at a courthouse in downtown LA, the terms of Britney's conservatorship were left unchanged and are set to remain in place until at least February 2021.</p>

<p>This comes despite her request that her temporary care manager Jodi Montgomery, who took over temporarily last year when her dad became ill, be allowed to continue permanently in that role.</p>

<p>However, since the conservatorship was established due to a court finding that the singer was incapable of making important decisions due to mental illness, nothing can be changed until a judge accepts that this is no longer the case. </p>

<p>A source told People last week that the reason Britney is so desperate to remove her dad from sole control is because he 'treats her like a child,'</p>

<p>The source added: 'Britney wants someone who is respectful and considerate to be in charge of her conservatorship. Someone from the outside who is not her family. Someone who will treat her like an adult and listen to her. She will never have this relationship with Jamie.' </p>

<p>Legal win: Following a status conference August 19, Britney's conservatorship was left unchanged and her dad, pictured  208, is set to remain in charge until at least February 2021</p>

<p>Insight: Britney's childhood friend and brief first husband Jason Alexander said outside court last month her life is fully supervised. 'It's not like she can just go do what she wants,' he said</p>

<p>Britney's childhood friend and brief first husband Jason Alexander joined members of the #FreeBritney movement outside the courthouse on August 19 and claimed to have insight into her life. </p>

<p>Jason, who wed Britney in Las Vegas in January 2004 only for the marriage to be annulled 55 hours later, said she is ready for the conservatorship 'to be over with'.</p>

<p>'It's holding her back,' he said. 'It's really sad because it's affecting her relationship with her kids and people like me and her friends that she'd like to hang out with but she can't.' </p>

<p>Jason added: 'She does get to do things, you know go to a vacation for a week, but it's all supervised. It's not like she can just go do what she wants.' </p>

<p>Sibling support: It was recently revealed that Britney's sister Jamie Lynn, 29, was made a trustee of the star's trust in 2018. The SJB Trust was established in 2004 to protect the hitmaker's fortune and during her lifetime, she is the sole beneficiary of the trust </p>

<p>Kids: Jamie Lynn's role is to ensure that in the event of Britney's death, her fortune is transferred to a trust benefiting sons Sean Preston, 14, and Jayden James, 13 (pictured in 2013)</p>

<p>It was also recently revealed that Britney's sister Jamie Lynn, 29, was made a trustee of her older sister's trust in 2018.</p>

<p>The SJB Trust was established in 2004 to protect the hitmaker's fortune and during her lifetime, she is the sole beneficiary of the trust.</p>

<p>Jamie Lynn's role is to ensure that in the event of Britney's death, that fortune is transferred to a trust benefiting her children.</p>

<p>Britney has two sons - Sean Preston, 14, and Jayden James, 13 - whom she shares with her ex-husband Kevin Federline. The boys primarily reside with their father.</p>

<p>Last year, Kevin accused his former father-in-law Jamie of laying hands on Sean during an altercation at home.</p>

<p>Police investigated the allegations involving child abuse and found 'insufficient proof' to make any charges. </p>

<p>However, Kevin did obtain a restraining order which prohibits Jamie from coming near Sean or his brother Jayden for three years. </p>

<p>Kevin and Britney married in September 2004 and the singer filed for divorce two years later, in November 2006. </p>

<p>Couple: Britney has been living quietly at her mansion in Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles, with boyfriend Sam Asghari, and shares regular photos and updates with fans via Instagram</p>
