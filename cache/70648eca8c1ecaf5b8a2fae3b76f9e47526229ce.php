<p>England are scheduled to take on New Zealand in a friendly at Wembley on November 12</p>

<p>The FA had hoped to have supporters back at Wembley in time for the friendly against Wales on October 8 but the rising Covid numbers in the UK have put plans to allow partial crowds back into stadiums in jeopardy.</p>

<p>England have played New Zealand twice previously, with both matches coming during a 1991 summer tour.</p>

<p>Under Graham Taylor, the visitors won 1-0 on June 3 in Auckland, courtesy of Gary Lineker’s late goal before a 2-0 win five days later in Wellington thanks to strikes from Stuart Pearce and David Hirst.</p>

<p>The game is scheduled to be played behind-closed-doors due to government restrictions</p>
