<p>The 41-year-old reality TV superstar wore a flowing camouflage top and a pair of simple black leggings for her outing.</p>

<p>Off she goes: Kourtney Kardashian was glimpsed Thursday running an errand in Los Angeles with her five-year-old son Reign</p>

<p>Kourtney shares Reign along with her two older children Mason, 10, and Penelope, eight, with her smoldering ex Scott Disick.</p>

<p>Her outing comes in the wake of news that Keeping Up With The Kardashians was coming to an end on E! after more than a decade. </p>

<p>Keeping Up With The Kardashians soldiered on for 18 seasons after it first started in 2007 and made superstars out of Kourtney and all five of her siblings.</p>

<p>Early last week a Page Six report alleged Kourtney's little sister Khloe, as well as Scott, were against the cancellation of the show.</p>

<p>Stepping out: The 41-year-old reality TV superstar wore a flowing camouflage top and a pair of simple black leggings for her outing</p>

<p>By way of explaining their opposition to the cancellation the insider said: 'Some of them needed the money more than others.'</p>

<p>Scott shares three children with Kris' eldest daughter Kourtney Kardashian - sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, and daughter Penelope, eight. </p>

<p>Although there were rumors that Kourtney and Kim Kardashian, as well as Kylie Jenner, pushed for the show to end, the family has denied as much.</p>

<p>The family told the MailOnline that the cancellation was equally 'emotional' for the whole family who made the decision together.</p>

<p>On the move: Sweeping her hair back into a ponytail she made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Their denial came in the wake of a source telling The Sun: 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements - she doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.'</p>

<p>To hear this source tell it: 'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on - he's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'</p>

<p>However the Sun also had a different insider claim that the Kardashian-Jenner family jointly discussed the matter and decided to end the show.</p>
