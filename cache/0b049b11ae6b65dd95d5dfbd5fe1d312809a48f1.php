<p>Shea spoke on CNN on Tuesday where he said police response times are down and he slammed the movement to defund the police.</p>

<p>He said police response times are down because officers have been pulled off normal duty to help in protests across the city. </p>

<p>'You have the whole defunding movement which literally Jim – thousands of cops off the street…I think it’s cheap theater, I think it's politics, what we need is people to stand up and say good job, thank you,' he said.</p>

<p>'The cops are out there. They were up on the Upper West Side last night taking drug dealers off the streets, the cops are out there,' he added.</p>

<p>The movement to defund police departments gained traction with a string of police killings this year including that of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky. </p>

<p>The uptick in crime has forced the NYPD to increase weekend patrols and shift officers to areas seeing a rise in shootings.</p>

<p>Police efforts to combat the surge in violence include collecting timely intelligence about crime conditions, short and long-term investigations to root out persistent drivers of violence, and grassroot engagement through Neighborhood Policing to solve problems at a local level.</p>
