<p>They're back: Ryan Reynolds, Nicolas Cage and Emma Stone are back with an update in The Croods 2: A New Age, out just in time for Thanksgiving this year</p>

<p>The trailer picks up with the Croods facing 'another glorious morning'  as they continue their search for their perfect home, something that proved somewhat elusive in the first flick.   </p>

<p>Soon, they come upon an illuminated compound of sorts, one which makes their jaws drop with all of its fancy accoutrements: like light, and gardening.</p>

<p>The Croods then meet Hope and Phil Betterman, played by Mann and Dinklage, who face off against the titular family with all manner of evolved life hacks... like actual clothing, jewelry and flip-flops. </p>

<p>In the new sequel: The 'world's first family' meets their match in The Bettermans, a more upright clan that seemingly has evolution on their side</p>

<p>Nice to meet you: Hope and Phil Betterman are played by Leslie Mann and Peter Dinklage, who face off against the titular family with all manner of evolved life hacks like clothing, jewelry...</p>

<p>...and even flip-flops</p>

<p>The meeting proves successful in some aspects, like when each family's eldest daughters mesh and become fast and shrill friends.</p>

<p>But things get competitive as well, as Hope wonders, 'I don't know if cave people belong in a modern world...'</p>

<p>Catherine Keener, Clark Duke and Cloris Leachman are also returning for this second foray, the latter as the hilarious Gran.</p>

<p>Woah: The titular family come upon an illuminated compound of sorts, one which makes their jaws drop</p>

<p>The Betterman farm compound wows with all of its fancy accoutrements: Like light, and gardening</p>

<p>Comic gem: Catherine Keener, Clark Duke and Cloris Leachman are also returning for this second foray, the latter as the hilarious Gran</p>

<p>The original Croods movie enjoyed a healthy 71 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, and went on to be nominated for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year in 2014.</p>

<p>It lost the trophy to Disney's megahit musical Frozen. </p>

<p>And curiously, the new film seems inspired by that film, as The Croods 2 sees the daughters from each family form a special and sisterly bond, as they venture out of the Bettermans' farm compound, coming across dangerous predators in the process.</p>

<p>The Croods 2: A New Age comes out on November 25th. </p>
