<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds United have asked about Toulouse midfielder Manu Kone after missing out on Chelsea's Conor Gallagher, who joined West Brom. </p>

<p>Kone, 19, is an athletic France U19 international who also has interest from AC Milan. </p>

<p>Leeds' priority remains to add another winger while a move for Udinese's Rodrigo de Paul is on hold.</p>

<p>Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa has defended his decision to make goalkeeper Kiko Casilla Leeds' captain for Wednesday night's Carabao Cup defeat to Hull.</p>

<p>Casilla was banned for eight matches in February and fined £60,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing Charlton forward Jonathan Leko and Leeds fans have expressed their concerns over the decision on social media.</p>

<p>'I interpreted the feeling of his team-mates,' said Bielsa after Spaniard Casilla skippered the side in the absence of the injured Liam Cooper.</p>

<p>'His team-mates think he deserved to be the captain and we have to listen to those messages.'</p>

<p>Bielsa added: 'The players see in their captain someone they feel can represent them. I respect the opinions of any person. After that opinions can be argued.</p>

<p>'Surely those who judge Kiko ignore a lot of the things his team-mates see in him?'</p>

<p>Bielsa said that he could not ignore his players' request because a section of fans did not agree with it.</p>
