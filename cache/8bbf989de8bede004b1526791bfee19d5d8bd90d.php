<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lloyds Bank has been given a slap on the wrist for forcing small businesses who were desperate for an emergency coronavirus loan to open an account with them.</p>

<p>The high street lender was rebuked by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for 'bundling' – making 30,000 customers open a fee-paying account when all they wanted was a Government-backed Bounce Back loan.</p>

<p>Lloyds will now have to write to these customers, telling them that they can switch their account to a new provider while keeping the loan or offering them a fee-free account to service the loan.</p>

<p>Lloyds was rebuked by the Competition and Markets Authority for 'bundling' - making 30,000 customers open a fee-paying account when all they wanted was a Bounce Back loan</p>

<p>The ruling is a setback for chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio as his tenure comes to an end. The Portuguese 56-year-old is leaving next year after a decade in charge in which he has been paid £56million.</p>

<p>Adam Land, senior director at the CMA, said: 'By forcing businesses to open current accounts as a pre-condition to access this [Bounce Back] scheme, Lloyds breached the CMA undertakings it signed, reduced choice and put their customers at risk of being unnecessarily charged.'</p>

<p>After the Government launched its Bounce Back loans in May, more than 1.4m businesses applied for cash to help them make ends meet.</p>

<p>The loans charged low interest and are 100 per cent guaranteed by the Government, meaning the banks cannot lose out.</p>

<p>Thousands of firms which applied were run by owners without a formal business account, who had previously run their business through a Lloyds personal account.</p>

<p>This is not strictly allowed under the terms and conditions of a personal account but, since many firms were under pressure, most banks turned a blind eye.</p>

<p>However, Lloyds had no way to make a business loan to a personal account holder. So, to get money swiftly out of the door to desperate businesses, it forced them to open a business account.</p>

<p>Though Lloyds did not charge for this business account for 12 months, any customer who kept it for longer than that would have ended up paying £7 a month.</p>

<p>The bank was aware that this may have breached the CMA's rules, and referred itself immediately to the watchdog.</p>

<p>Lloyds said: 'Any other solution would have created unnecessary delays at a critical time. All business current accounts benefit from 12 months free banking.</p>

<p>'We proactively informed the CMA of our approach and are now writing to customers to reiterate that they can transfer their account to a free loan servicing account'</p>

<p>Since May, Lloyds has handed out more than 250,000 Bounce Back loans, worth more than £7.5billion. The entire scheme has so far lent £35.5billion to 1.2m small businesses.</p>
