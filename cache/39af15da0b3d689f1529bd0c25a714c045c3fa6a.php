<p>'I was shocked to see how many women have also suffered from endometriosis, and how many questions women have about painful periods...</p>

<p>She revealed she has no plans for surgery at the moment and is currently going down the holisitic route in a bid to treat her condition. </p>

<p>She said: 'I want to try to see if I can figure some things out for myself, but we’ll see. It’s a journey...</p>

<p>'Every month is different because I try different things every month...</p>

<p>'But I’ll definitely keep everybody posted on what works for me, and eventually having to get the surgery because it really depends. Everyone’s different.'</p>

<p>She advised women to get their egg count checked and to make sure that painful periods aren't affecting either their ovaries or eggs.</p>

<p>'That to me just feels awful,' she said. </p>

<p>Culpo also shared that she's been 'loving' celery juice in the morning, enjoying home workouts and trying to carve out time for regular meditation.</p>

<p>She's been dating pro football player Christian McCaffrey, 24, for about a year.</p>
