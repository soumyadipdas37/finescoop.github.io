<p>Villa manager Dean Smith has made an inquiry for Brewster, who massively impressed on loan with Swansea last season in the Championship.</p>

<p>According to the Sun, Villa have the funds to win the race for the £20m-rated front man, with a host of other topflight sides sniffing around the England Under-21 international.</p>

<p>Aston Villa want to sign Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster as their striker search continues</p>

<p>Villa manager Dean Smith has made an inquiry for Brewster, who would cost them £20m</p>

<p>Burnley, Brighton, Crystal Palace and Fulham are all among the reported interested parties to have contacted Brewster's representatives in addition to Villa and Newcastle.</p>

<p>However, the Villians are now favourites to land the U17 World Cup winner after missing out on Callum Wilson, who signed for Newcastle.</p>

<p>Smith has also expressed an interest in re-uniting with his former striker Ollie Watkins after managing him at Brentford.</p>

<p>Both pursuits into former Villa talisman Tammy Abraham and Celtic's Odsonne Edouard have gone cold.</p>

<p>The Liverpool youngster made a great impression last season on loan with Swansea City</p>

<p>Liverpool are reportedly willing to let Brewster leave for around £20million, a fee that Villa would be willing to pay in order to compete with their Premier League rivals next season.</p>

<p>Although Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is a huge fan of Brewster and despite his goalscoring antics during pre-season following his clinical loan spell with the Swans, he may let him go in order to open up funds for a more experienced forward.</p>

<p>Klopp wanted to trade Divock Origi instead, but there has been far less interest in the Belgian.</p>

<p>Brewster has made it clear that he wishes to stay at Anfield and fight for his place with the Premier League champions.</p>

<p>Brewster has said he wants to stay at Anfield but Klopp might have to reluctantly sell him</p>

<p>He told The Beautiful Game podcast: 'Ultimately, I want to be at Liverpool next season. I want to be fighting for a spot to play.</p>

<p>'Who is not going to want to play at the home of the champions? I don't really want to go on loan, but if that's the best thing for me to do, to go away and get more game time, then that's what I'm going to do.</p>

<p>'Realistically, I want to play for Liverpool.</p>

<p>'I want to be the striker, you know? I'll go to [the Reds' pre-season training camp], work hard and then whatever the boss says to do, I will accept, whether that's to stay or whether that's to go back on loan.'</p>
