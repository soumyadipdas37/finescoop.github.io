<p>Just the two of us: Tommy Fury enjoyed a brief break away from his partner Molly-Mae Hague as he tucked into some ice cream alongside his father John in Hale Cheshire on Sunday</p>

<p>Opting for a sporty display when it came to his footwear, the sportsman rounded things off with box-fresh trainers and a plain watch.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, his love Molly-Mae, also 21, revealed she's been forced to avoid her Twitter account after getting trolled over her £8,000 social media giveaway.</p>

<p>Out and about: The boxer, 21, cut a casual figure as he sported a form-fitting black T-shirt, teamed with a pair of white shorts</p>

<p>However, she soon found herself to be the target of relentless trolling on Twitter, after several men complained that the competition post, which has been liked and shared more than 1 million times, was clogging up their feeds.</p>

<p>As the complaints ramped up on the micro-blogging site, the influencer clapped back, wryly tweeting: '£10 to any boy that’s not tweeted ‘£10 to any girl thats not entered Molly-Mae’s giveaway’..... terms and conditions apply x.' </p>

<p>However, on Saturday, Molly-Mae admitted she'd all but given up on the platform, in a video shared with her fans on her Instagram Stories.</p>

<p>She said: 'I've been kind of trying to not look at Twitter too much just because even though it's meant to be a lovely thing and something we can all enjoy together people still have their mad opinions on it always.</p>

<p>Clapping back: As the complaints about her giveaway clogging up Instagram feeds, the reality star and influencer clapped back with a wry tweet</p>

<p>'I'm one of those people that do tend to read things and I do tend to let it get to me.</p>

<p>'But I just made this giveaway for something for us all to enjoy together, a way that we can celebrate having a million subscribers together and also a way for me to give back was the main thing.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't have any of this stuff without you guys, I wouldn't be able to do any of the things I do.</p>

<p>'Like even be where I am now in Milan, that wouldn't be happening without you guys, so it's just a way I can give back and say thank you, really.'</p>
