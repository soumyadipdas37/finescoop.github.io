<p>In the past week, not one high street bank has offered mortgages for those with a 10 per cent deposit according to The Times. </p>

<p>Brokers have also warned that deals for those with a 15 per cent deposit are also disappearing as more than 300 of them have been pulled since January.  </p>

<p>First-time buyers are being asked to save at least 20 per cent for a deposit on a house as mortgage deals for those with a 10 per cent deposit disappear </p>

<p>For those with smaller deposits there are only a small number of these deals available.</p>

<p>According to Moneyfacts, there are only 44 deals left for those with a 10 per cent deposit, but most have restrictive criteria.   </p>

<p>David Hollingworth from the mortgage broker London &amp; Country said that its already a 'big ask to require a first-time buyer who has scrimped and saved to come up with a bigger deposit'.  </p>

<p>This comes after Rishi Sunak's stamp duty holiday, which can save buyers up to £15,000.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak's stamp duty holiday could save buyers up to £15,000, but first-time buyers are being asked to save at least 20 per cent for a mortgage </p>

<p>The Chancellor said he would immediately raise the threshold on stamp duty to £500,000 until March 31 2021.  </p>

<p>The measure, which temporarily increases the 'nil rate' band of stamp duty from £125,000 to £500,000, will reduce the average stamp duty bill for a main home from £4,500 to zero.    </p>

<p>The Chancellor's crucial coronavirus recovery package includes a six-month 'holiday' from paying the charge on most homes to kickstart the market.</p>

<p>However, economists voiced alarm at the idea that the move could be announced to the House of Commons, but not implemented until the Autumn. </p>

<p>Fears were raised that purchases would grind to a halt as people would simply wait in order save thousands of pounds. </p>

<p>But UK house prices hit a record high following a post-lockdown boom, with the average home now worth £245,747.</p>

<p>A newly-released report by Halifax said property prices were 5.2% higher than the same month a year earlier and property values were up by 1.6% month on month.</p>

<p>But with household incomes under pressure and job loss announcements mounting, the report said it is 'highly unlikely' that current levels of house price growth will be sustained.</p>
