<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Boris Johnson’s plan to reform social care has been delayed again, leaving families continuing to face sky-high bills for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Insiders say no details will be released until Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Autumn Statement in late November – or even later.</p>

<p>It is understood that Downing Street has gone back to square one after cooling on the idea of a cap on the costs of care.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister is now looking at a new plan based on the pensions system, with people getting basic care for free but with the ability to pay more for better care.</p>

<p>Families continue to face sky-high bills for the foreseeable future. Under England’s broken social care system, people pay the full cost of their care until their assets – including the value of their home – fall to below £23,250</p>

<p>Under the scheme, championed by Theresa May’s former deputy Damian Green, the elderly would pay more via their savings or housing wealth if they wanted larger rooms in a care home, more appetising meals or more frequent trips.</p>

<p>Earlier this week Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked by MPs when the plan for social care would be published – and he refused to give an answer.</p>

<p>Last night charities said the further delay was ‘gut-wrenching’ for families.</p>

<p>Under England’s broken social care system, people pay the full cost of their care until their assets – including the value of their home – fall to below £23,250.</p>

<p>It leaves many parents unable to pass on much of an inheritance to their children.</p>

<p>It had been thought that No 10 was close to announcing a version of economist Andrew Dilnot’s care cap, which would see everyone paying a maximum of £40,000 towards their care, with the state stepping in to pay the rest. </p>

<p>But senior figures are believed to be cooling on this idea, partly because it would not guarantee that people would not have to sell their homes to pay for care. </p>

<p>This is because the Dilnot scheme sees people having to pay ‘hotel’ costs for bed and board of up to £10,000 a year.</p>

<p>And the £40,000 cap would not be a significant help to people in some northern areas where house prices are much lower.</p>

<p>Downing Street is now looking at other models, including one promoted by Mr Green for a system based on pensions.</p>

<p>Everyone would get a guaranteed basic level of social care for free, just as they get a state pension. But they would have to pay more if they wanted better care, in the same way as people can take out private pensions.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson is now looking at a new plan - with people getting basic care for free but with the ability to pay more for better care</p>

<p>The system could see them having the option of paying a lump sum of £10,000 or £20,000 on retirement for the promise of better care should they need it. </p>

<p>The Daily Mail has campaigned to end the injustice of families of patients with dementia and other illnesses having to spend billions on care.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson claimed when he entered No 10 in July last year that he already had a plan to end the social care crisis ‘once and for all’. </p>

<p>But in the many months since he made that confident announcement, no information has been forthcoming.</p>

<p>Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘Social care was in desperate need of refinancing and reform before the pandemic and six months later the red warning lights are now flashing brighter than ever.</p>

<p>‘Given everything else going on, a further delay is not surprising but it is gut-wrenching.’ </p>
