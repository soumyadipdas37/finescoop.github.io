<p>Chyna added: 'He would come down to mine in Essex quite a lot and it got to the point where he was constantly coming to see me. It was just too much for me.</p>

<p>'It was more on his part than mine. So I just told him a few times saying, "let's keep it cool, let's take it easy, take it slow". He did say at one point he wanted to marry me and I thought "wow"... It was too much for such little time.'</p>
