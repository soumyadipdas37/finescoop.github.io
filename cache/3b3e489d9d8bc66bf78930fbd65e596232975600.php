<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Everton could be set to allow Alex Iwobi and Moise Kean leave the club - just 12 months after signing the pair for a mammoth £62.5million.</p>

<p>The Toffees have splashed the cash this summer in an attempt to revamp Carlo Ancelotti's squad, with Allan, Abdoulaye Doucoure and James Rodriguez all coming on board.</p>

<p>The Premier League club now need to recoup some of their summer outlay, and according to the Mirror, they are willing to listen to offers for a number of first-team squad members.</p>

<p>Alex Iwobi could be set to leave Everton just 12 months after arriving at Goodison Park</p>

<p>Moise Kean was also brought in as part of a big spending spree last summer but could move on</p>

<p>That includes Alex Iwobi, who signed from Arsenal for £35million just 12 months ago, and Moise Kean, who has already been linked with a return to Juventus after struggling in his first season on Merseyside following a £27.5million move.</p>

<p>Others could be offloaded, too, with the likes of Gylfi Siggurdsson and Theo Walcott not definitively in Ancelotti's plans this season. </p>

<p>Iwobi's first season at Everton fizzled out after a promising start, the winger failing to add to his goalscoring tally after scoring twice in his first three competitive appearances.</p>

<p>Likewise, Italian striker Kean had trouble in front of goal, scoring just twice in his first season in England.  </p>

<p>Carlo Ancelotti has revamped his side, with the likes of James Rodriguez coming on board </p>
