<p>'Your nipples go under your arms as you get older!' Patti Newton (pictured), 75, had the cast and crew in hysterics on Sunday, when she as stripped down for a photo shoot on The All New Monty: Guys and Gals</p>

<p>Holding her own music album, she said with a laugh: 'As you get older, your nipples go under your arms!' </p>

<p>Patti, who is married to TV and musical theatre legend Bert Newton, remarked after the shoot, that despite her nerves, it ended up being 'fabulous'.  </p>

<p>'I was a bit worried about it, a bit nervous, because I kept thinking it's sort of a little confronting. But in actual fact it was fabulous!' </p>

<p>Comedian Fiona O'Loughlin also brought the laughs during her shoot where she sat at a table and held onto large punch jugs.</p>

<p>'I was expecting little milk jugs, by my jugs are huge!' the 57-year-old said.</p>

<p>She added: 'I'm kind of having an out of body experience. It's like I'm not here.'   </p>

<p>Russell Crowe's ex-wife Danielle Spencer, 51, posed behind two owls, but before that, she expressed how difficult she finds photo shoots.</p>

<p>'I can't do the megawatt smile': Russell Crowe's ex-wife Danielle Spencer (pictured), 51, posed behind two owls, but before that, she expressed how difficult she finds photo shoots </p>

<p>'I sort of find photo shoots a bit difficult anyway, to be completely relaxed in them, because I can't do the megawatt smile and keep it held and look like it's real.</p>

<p>'People look at it as me being unfriendly, stuck up or standoffish, or cold. It's not. It's just me being not that great at having my photograph taken,' the singer said.  </p>

<p>Former beauty pageant queen Erin Holland cradled two adorable puppies, and later said how they made a nice distraction from the task at hand.</p>

<p>'I definitely don't feel good naked,' the 31-year-old revealed. 'I'm quite flat-chested and I definitely feel less feminine,'  </p>

<p>Radio star Ash Pollard concealed her chest with two milkshakes in glasses, and described the whole experience as 'fun'.   </p>

<p>'I fancy myself a lot, looking at that. How liberating,' the 34-year-old quipped.  </p>

<p>Olympic swimming champion Leisel Jones had no qualms in stripping down, after years of competitive sport.</p>

<p>'I'm pretty comfortable getting my kit off. I'll probably frighten the crew more than anything,' the 35-year-old joked, before holding onto two coconuts. </p>

<p>Home and Away star Sam Frost did two shoots, one with Ash and holding onto fake flowers, and the other by herself, and clutching onto two large balloons.</p>

<p>'I feel uncomfortable wearing a bikini at the beach with my friends, so for me this is really outside of my comfort zone,' the 31-year-old confessed.</p>

<p>'I can be extremely self-conscious and insecure. I think it's something a lot of women battle with. It's something that I want to change,' she continued. </p>

<p>The ladies had signed onto the show for a good cause, to raise awareness for men's and women's cancers, and to encourage women to get their breasts checked.  </p>
