<p>Dan Norris, of Leggett Prestige estate agents in France, described the villa as 'perfect'.</p>

<p>Norris said: 'It is actually stunning, there is no other word for it. It's in the so-called Golden Triangle between Nice and Monaco and looks out over one of the most perfect bays in France'</p>

<p>It looks out towards the iconic Villa Nellcôte, the house rented by Rolling Stones lead guitarist Keith Richards, during the early 1970s, where he wrote and the band recorded part of their seminal album, Exile on Main St</p>

<p>He said: 'It is actually stunning, there is no other word for it. It's in the so-called Golden Triangle between Nice and Monaco and looks out over one of the most perfect bays in France.</p>

<p>'The owners fell in love with it and felt they had to have it. Now they are a little older they want to reduce their responsibilities and downsize their commitments.'</p>

<p>Mr Norris believes that despite its grandeur, the villa has a 'warm and homely feel' and would suit a family who wanted a spacious property close to the beach and with its own pool.</p>

<p>He said: 'However, it could equally work for someone who was commercially minded and wanted to rent it out.'</p>
