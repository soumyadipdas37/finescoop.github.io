<p>Speaking on the The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday, the two friends admitted they were actually quite restrained compared to other middle-aged women.</p>

<p>'They monitor you here. You're only allowed a bottle a night,' Sophie, 40, said. </p>

<p>The admission prompted Jackie, 45, to laugh out loud, seemingly confirming that she is facing a similar restriction. </p>

<p>'That's it!' Sophie added, leaving Kyle in shock. </p>

<p>Kyle then joked that the two women would be 'fermenting fruit' in the bathroom in order to make alcohol.</p>

<p>The radio host previously admitted that she was going to have to isolate for a full month, in Melbourne and when she gets home to Sydney.</p>

<p>'My life is f**ked... I can't get out of Melbourne. I am going to be stuck here for the rest of my life,' she said on her KIIS FM show last week. </p>

<p>Quarantine hell: The radio host previously admitted that she was going to have to isolate for a full month, in Melbourne and when she gets home to Sydney</p>

<p>'I have to do 14 days quarantine in my room here and then another 14 days when I get to Sydney.'</p>

<p>Jackie explained that she understood why she had to quarantine in Melbourne, after there was a COVID-19 outbreak on set of The Masked Singer.</p>

<p>But she slammed the need to quarantine again in Sydney, described it as 'odd'.</p>

<p>Trying month: Following her 14-day isolation in Melbourne, she will have to isolate in Sydney for another two weeks. Pictured with her radio co-host Kyle Sandilands (left)</p>

<p>'I don't mind doing the quarantine, but it seems odd to do the double quarantine,' she said.</p>

<p>'Because at the end of this quarantine I will be tested and if I'm negative then I definitely won't have it.'</p>

<p>The NSW government requires the majority of people entering the state from Victoria to isolate for 14 days or comply with their permit conditions.</p>
