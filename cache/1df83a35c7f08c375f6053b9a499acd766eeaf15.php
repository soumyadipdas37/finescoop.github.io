<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Outspoken AFL great Sam Newman has hit out at the decision to crown a painting of Indigenous icon and legend of the game Adam Goodes as the winner of the Archibald Prize.</p>

<p>The portrait - which won its artist Vincent Namatjira the $100,000 prize at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney on Friday - depicts Goodes pointing to his skin and doing his famous spear celebration.</p>

<p>AFL legend Nicky Winmar first did it in front of racist fans in 1993, while Goodes quit the league in 2015 following racial vilification from opposing fans.</p>

<p>Newman has vocally defended criticism of Goodes - last year claiming the booing directed towards him was not racist - and on Saturday night mocked the move to recognise the portrait of the Sydney Swans legend.</p>

<p>The ex-Footy Show presenter and Geelong icon interpreted entertainment reporter Peter Ford's saying 'Wow' in reference to the announcement as meaning 'Why Oh Why'.</p>

<p>Artist Vincent Namatjira's Archibald Prize winning portrait of former AFL footballer Adam Goodes. Outspoken AFL legend Sam Newman said 'Why Oh Why' as he responded to the award in a mocking social media post</p>

<p>Newman, 74, interpreted entertainment reporter Peter Ford's post saying 'Wow' as meaning 'Why Oh Why'</p>

<p>'An acronym, obviously "Why Oh Why",' Newman wrote.</p>

<p>Namatjira's work was up against portraits of refugee Behrouz Boochani, Indigenous author Bruce Pascoe and actor Magda Szubanski among the contenders.</p>

<p>The painting also featured himself and Adam Goodes holding hands as well as himself holding an Aboriginal flag on the right. </p>

<p>Last year, Newman was 'banned' from watching the new Adam Goodes documentary after he labelled it 'grovelling' and fake news. </p>

<p>The Final Quarter explored the champion Sydney Swans player's final years in the AFL and the persistent booing he received.   </p>

<p>'Criticising someone from another race - doesn't make you a racist,' Newman wrote on Twitter at the time.</p>

<p>The career of Adam Goodes - pictured with wife Natalie Croker - and the persistent booing he received was documented in the documentary The Final Quarter</p>

<p>Newman pictured in 2010. Last year, he claimed the booing directed towards Goodes was not racist</p>

<p>'The groveling doco by Sharks**t Productions ''The Final Quarter'', should be ''The Last Straw''. Adam Goodes initially was booed for taunting Carlton fans. Racist? So be it. #racism #fakenews.'</p>

<p>Goodes was the subject of repeated jeers after he called out a 13-year-old girl who labelled him an 'ape' from the stands during a 2013 match.</p>

<p>They continued for years and intensified when he performed an Indigenous dance during a game in 2015. </p>

<p>Newman publicly called out Goodes on The Footy Show back in 2015 saying he was booed for his miming of throwing a spear in the direction of the Carlton cheer squad, not because of his race.</p>

<p>At the time of the booing the AFL Players' Association released a statement, calling for an immediate end to the attacks on Goodes </p>

<p>'From one Australian to another Australian - I'm an Australian, so is Adam Goodes - Adam you're not important as you think you are and you take yourself far too seriously,' Newman said on Channel Nine's Footy Show.</p>

<p>'If you're going to provoke people by the gesture of spear-throwing at a crowd, you better not be surprised if you get what you wish for and that's a reaction.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately you're not well-enough equipped to deal with fracas and the saga that you've caused.</p>

<p>'You're just not capable of dealing with it, hence the fact you've gone into hiding, you're not playing anymore.</p>

<p>Newman publicly called out Goodes on The Footy Show back in 2015 saying he was booed for his miming of throwing a spear in the direction of the Carlton cheer squad, not because of his race</p>

<p>'It is on you as an Australian of the Year to unite and placate people, not to divide and be a provocateur.</p>

<p>'How about the condescending nature of people who say if you're an AFL fan and you go to the football and you boo Adam Goodes you're a racist. How gratuitously stupid is that?</p>

<p>'I would suggest the people boo Adam Goodes because he has turned their game into a political forum and people go to the football to get away from everything as a release, as an outlet and they don't want to have to put up with a political statement.'</p>

<p>Goodes, a dual Brownlow Medallist and genuine legend of the AFL, played 372 games for the Swans and booted 464 goals before his 2015 retirement.   </p>
