<p>New romance? Alex and Sam - who plays Ken Barlow's grandson Adam in the ITV soap - enjoyed a meal in Soho and were seen chatting affectionately, according to The Sun</p>

<p>'Strictly made Alex a household name so she's instantly recognisable, and Sam is a big name on Corrie so they probably knew they'd be spotted out together but didn't seem to mind at all.</p>

<p>'They laughed and flirted with each other and had a great time before heading off looking very cosy. They're clearly both happy.' </p>

<p>Sam first appeared in Corrie in 2004 for a four-year stint as Adam and then returned to the role in 2016, becoming a favourite due to his good looks.</p>

<p>Representatives for Alex and Sam have been contacted by MailOnline for comment.  </p>

<p>Ex-footballer Alex revealed in an interview with Hello! Magazine in November 2019 that she was single and 'very happy'.</p>

<p>It comes as Alex has been targeted by 'awful trolls' on social media after she was tipped to be in the running to replace Sue Barker on A Question Of Sport. </p>

<p>She was rumoured to have secured the gig on Wednesday after the after Sue, 64, was axed as host after 24 years.</p>

<p>Now Alex, who is of Irish and Jamaican descent, has received thousands of racist comments online.  </p>

<p>Much of the abuse suggested Alex is only in pole position for the job because of the colour of her skin.</p>

<p>One told her: 'Wow, I see you got the job Sue Barker has done so well for so many years. It's obviously because of your presenting skills. Nothing else. Nothing PC. Nothing about having token black people on the BBC. You must be very proud.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'She will fail...black and no charm.' </p>

<p>A source called the comments 'disgusting', as reports suggest the star has been contacted by a troll hunting firm, Defuse Global, having been bombarded with messages.</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted a representative for Alex and the BBC for a comment. </p>

<p>While her A Question of Sport gig has yet to be confirmed, the east London native has revealed to Hello! that she's choosing to focus on the majority of positive comments she receives for her punditry on the BBC and Sky since she retired from playing sports.  </p>

<p>Speaking of her career transition, Scott said: 'At first, I thought no one liked me on TV as there was a whole lot of negativity online, but I've got to a place now where those sorts of comments are only like 10 to 20 per cent and I have a whole audience that does love me and is behind me.</p>

<p>'I don't want to let that small percentage stop me or get me down when I've worked so hard to be where I am.'</p>

<p>Scott said she used to go to recording studios after training to get experience, and did a degree in sports writing and broadcasting, adding: 'I prepare extensively for every show and love what I do.'  </p>

<p>Insisting that it is 'OK to be more than one thing', she said: 'I can put on a dress but also the next day put on my football boots, and that should be celebrated.</p>

<p>'I'm so proud of my career but, as Strictly showed, there can be so many parts to a person, and I'm no different. I love fashion and music and I love going to my mum's in east London for a roast dinner.'  </p>

<p>Alex has previously played for England and Arsenal before becoming a successful TV presenter.  </p>
