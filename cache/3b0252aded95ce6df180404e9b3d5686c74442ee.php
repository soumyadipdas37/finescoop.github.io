<p>Bella teased the video for her new single the night before on Instagram, writing: 'STUPID F***ING B**** just about to drop this on my ONLY fans !!! Link in bio BE THE FIRST TO HEAR AND SEE' </p>

<p>She launched her OnlyFans last month, charging $20 a month, $51 for a three-month subscription or $102 for six months.  </p>

<p>The Assassination Nation actress was reportedly the first content creator on the platform to earn $1million in their first 24 hours, after briefly crashing the site.  </p>

<p>She told the Los Angeles Times that she made $2million in the first week, and she's 'putting the earnings into her production company and toward charity.'   </p>

<p>Business minded: She launched her OnlyFans last month, charging $20 a month, $51 for a three-month subscription or $102 for six months</p>

<p>Although the site is mostly for adult entertainers to monetize their work, Thorne tweeted: 'Also nooooo I’m not doing nudity!!!'</p>

<p>But she quickly stirred up controversy, when she charged $200 for nude photos, which weren't actually nude, prompting many users to complain and request refunds.</p>

<p>The site subsequently implemented some unwelcome changes, like capping payments at $50 for pay-per-view posts, as well as a hold that would require some international users to wait 30 days for their payout.</p>

<p>Many sex workers who rely on the platform for their livelihood blamed Bella for making their jobs more difficult.</p>

<p>She later apologized on Twitter, writing: 'I wanted to bring attention to the site, the more people on the site the more likely of a chance to normalize the stigmas, And in trying to do this I hurt you. </p>
