<p>But Tuchel confirmed he was in the dark over Neymar’s injury at Reims' Stade Auguste-Delaune and will be looking for an update on the 28-year-old's condition.</p>

<p>‘I thought it was a hit, but maybe not. I don't know yet, I need to speak with the doctors,’ Tuchel told reporters after the match. </p>

<p>Tuchel praised Neymar’s performance and said: ‘He did too much defensively in the first half. I wanted him to play like a 10, but he played as an eight.</p>

<p>Tuchel was full or praise for Neymar following his performance in the Ligue One encounter</p>

<p>‘That didn't stop him from having a great game. In general, we had a good first half. We created a lot of chances, but we missed too many.</p>

<p>‘We have to kill the game after 20 minutes. It must be three or 4-0. I'm not happy with the second half. It was not serious enough, aggressive and intense.'</p>

<p>The result lifted PSG to seventh place on nine points from five Ligue 1 games, four behind leaders Rennes, while Reims stayed in 19th place on one point.</p>
