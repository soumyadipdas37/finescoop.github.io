<p>There have been suggestions that the French champions were prepared to bid £30million for Guendouzi with Arsenal keen to raise funds to bring in summer targets Thomas Partey and Houssem Aouar.</p>

<p>But when asked about a move for Guendouzi in the wake of PSG's 1-0 loss at newly-promoted Lens on Thursday night, Tuchel said: 'No, that will not happen.'</p>

<p>Guendouzi has been out of favour with Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta following a clash with Brighton's Neal Maupay following their defeat at the Amex Stadium in June.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old French midfielder was accused of taunting his opponents over their wages. Though he escaped FA punishment for the fracas, he didn't play again for the remainder of Arsenal's season.</p>

<p>He was also left out of the FA Cup holders' victory over Liverpool in the FA Community Shield at Wembley.</p>

<p>French midfielder Guendouzi fell out of favour with Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta last season </p>

<p>That led to reports PSG were poised to bid £30m for Guendouzi, who joined Arsenal back in 2018.</p>

<p>The money would help finance moves for Atletico Madrid midfielder Partey and Lyon's Aouar, but Tuchel appears to have ruled out an offer.</p>

<p>He was speaking after a lacklustre showing from PSG in their opening Ligue 1 fixture against newly-promoted Lens.</p>

<p>Depleted Paris Saint-Germain suffered a shock defeat in their opening Ligue 1 game</p>

<p>The Champions League finalists were without a number of their star players after Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Mauro Icardi, Angel Di Maria and Keylor Navas all tested positive for coronavirus.</p>

<p>A side packed with youngsters could only muster one shot on target as their title defence started with little more than a whimper.</p>

<p>Tuchel did confirm that PSG want to sign the Roma captain Alessandro Florenzi to replace Thomas Meunier, the right-back who has joined Borussia Dortmund.</p>

<p>'I hope that will be resolved. I am very optimistic for him,' Tuchel said.</p>
