<p>Tisha posted to the Mums Who Build, Renovate and Decorate Facebook group and said she was 'sick' of her 'ugly bins' always being on show.</p>

<p>She removed the original doors and shelf from the cabinet and made one single door that tilts downwards to expose the two bins inside. </p>

<p>A mum has shared images of how she transformed a second-hand $40 television cabinet from Facebook marketplace into the perfect storage space for her bins (pictured)</p>

<p>'[I] was sick of my ugly bins, so revamped a $40 TV cabinet from marketplace!' Tisha said online.</p>

<p>'Not a professional job and making a drawer at the bottom was challenging, so made plenty of mistakes but I absolutely love it and am so proud of myself!'</p>

<p>To change the colour of the wood, she used a charcoal chalk paint then a polyurethane clear varnish on top. </p>

<p>BEFORE: '[I] was sick of my ugly bins, so revamped a $40 TV cabinet from marketplace!' Tisha said online (original cabinet pictured) </p>

<p>She removed the doors and shelf from the cabinet and instead made one single door that tilts downwards to expose the bins inside</p>

<p>'This is awesome, looks so good, love the idea! Great handy work too!' one woman said in the comments.</p>

<p>'Simply genius!' another said, a third added: 'Love this!! Make me one please.'</p>

<p>'All of a sudden, I'm scouring marketplace for a tv cabinet! Thanks for the inspiration!' another said.</p>

<p>One mum also asked how the bins are removed if needing to be cleaned, to which Tisha replied: 'They actually come out through top fairly easily when I angle correctly, and the back I made a swing door so I can completely pull everything out and clean!'</p>

<p>AFTER: The cabinet is wide enough to fit two bins and the exterior looks far more stylish than it originally was</p>

<p>Tisha also made a fully functioning drawer at the bottom of the cabinet and added seashell-like handles to the outside</p>
