<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds could be set for a late transfer window swoop for AZ Almkaar captain Teun Koopmeiners.</p>

<p>Manger Marcelo Bielsa is looking to boost his midfield options after an injury to Pablo Hernandez, who was withdrawn from the starting line-up ahead of last week's Premier League win over Fulham with a groin strain.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old Spaniard is expected to be out for two weeks and the newly-promoted side are plotting a move for Koopmeiners, according to a report in the Telegraph.</p>

<p> AZ Almkaar midfielder Teun Koopmeiners is reportedly a transfer target for Leeds United</p>

<p>Koopmeiners, who was linked with Everton earlier in the summer, could fit the bill for Bielsa as he can also slot in at central defence when required with a fee that could edge above £10million.</p>

<p>The Dutch youth international has been capped by his country from U17 through to U21 level. </p>

<p>He would need to compete with England's Kalvin Phillips, Mateusz Klich and Hernandez on his return, but could be a solid squad option. </p>

<p>Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa wants to boost his midfield options and may turn to Koopmeiners</p>

<p> AZ Almkaar captain Koopmeiners is a regular for the Holland U21 international team</p>

<p>Italian Serie A side AC Milan have also showed interest in the player but Bielsa is reportedly looking to make Koopmeiners his fifth major signing of the summer following the club's promotion to the top flight.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Leeds confirmed the signing of Diego Llorente from Real Sociedad, the 27-year-old defender joining on a four-year deal worth up to £20million.</p>

<p>Bielsa has also added winger Helder Costa and defender Robin Koch to his side but looks keen to strengthen further before the transfer deadline shuts. </p>
