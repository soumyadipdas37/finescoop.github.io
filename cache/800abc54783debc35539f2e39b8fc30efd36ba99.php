<p>The 26-year-old man, from Queensland, began to message the 15-year-old girl on Instagram in May 2019 and told her she was 'beautiful' and 'could get anyone', Gladstone Magistrate's Court heard.</p>

<p>He then asked if she had Snapchat and told her he hated messaging on Instagram, where conversations can be recorded, the Gladstone Observer reported. </p>

<p>The man began to message the teenager on social media app Instagram in May 2019 and told her she was 'beautiful' and 'could get anyone', the court heard (stock image)</p>

<p>The man told the girl he really liked her in July 2019 and asked when she would be 'legal'.</p>

<p>The court heard how the teenager reported the man's behaviour to a school counsellor, who told police.</p>

<p>However, the man continued to message the teenager and requested to suck on her 'mint t****es' and 'eat her p***y'.</p>

<p>He offered her $100 to send him naked photographs and $5,000 to have sex with him.</p>

<p>Officers attended his home in May 2020 and he was arrested.</p>

<p>The man pleaded to grooming a child under 16 with intent to procure engagement in a sexual act on Wednesday. </p>

<p>The court heard the teenager reported the man's behaviour to a school counsellor, who told police (stock image)</p>

<p>Magistrate Ross Woodford said the man has a four-page long criminal history but he was unlikely to re-offend. </p>

<p>He sentenced the man to nine months in prison - which was suspended for 18 months. </p>

<p>'You are a low risk of re-offending due to the fact you have no like offences or sexual offences and your history is very limited,' Magistrate Woodford told the court.</p>

<p>'There was no intention to meet up with the child while the texting was going on and it appears to be an isolated incident.' </p>
