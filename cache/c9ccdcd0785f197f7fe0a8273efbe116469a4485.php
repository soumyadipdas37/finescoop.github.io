<p>Alessandra has been quarantining for much of the pandemic with her two children, Anja, 12, and Noah, eight, whom she shares with her former fiancé Jamie Mazur. </p>

<p>In 2018, it was revealed that she had split from Jamie following a decade-long engagement. </p>

<p>'They [have] been trying to keep their split on the down low,' an insider told Us Weekly at the time.</p>

<p>'But Alessandra has been out and about ready to mingle and hasn't been taking Jamie to anything.' </p>

<p>'If I have been engaged to him for eight years, then it's not my priority,' Alessandra admitted to Cosmopolitan UK in 2016. 'I have a lot of things going on, and I haven't got married because I'm so busy. I'll think about that when I have time off.'  </p>

<p>More recently, she has been spending time with her Italian businessman beau, Nicolo Oddi, whom she's dated since 2018.</p>

<p>Last month, she and Jamie left California for a vacation with her two children to the crystal clear waters of the Maldives, where they celebrated Ana's 12th birthday.</p>
