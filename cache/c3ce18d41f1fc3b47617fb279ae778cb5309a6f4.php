<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ant McPartlin has closed his £20m TV business after finalising his divorce settlement with ex-wife Lisa Armstrong.</p>

<p>The TV presenter, 44, did have company Teecourt Limited which was used to pay his share of earnings for his television commitments with on-screen partner Dec.</p>

<p>However new documents filed with Companies House show that Ant has now had it struck from the register.  </p>

<p>Shut down: Ant McPartlin has closed his £20m TV business Teecourt Limited (pictured left with TV parter Declan Donnelly)</p>

<p>Records previously showed that Teecourt Limited retained earnings of £20 million, including £9 million in cash and £11 million in investments.  </p>

<p>The closing paper work is also thought to show that any remaining cash and assets have been stripped from the company.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Ant to ask for a comment.  </p>

<p>It comes after Ant and Lisa were granted a decree absolute in April 2020, which formally ended their 12-year marriage and 23-year relationship.</p>

<p>Moving on: The end of the business comes after Ant divorced his ex-wife Lisa Armstrong (pictured together in May 2017)</p>

<p>It was reported that TV host Ant handed over £31 million to Lisa in their settlement, including their £5million home in West London, after an 'eight-hour negotiation'.</p>

<p>The beauty expert was said to have been the 'peacemaker' during a the lengthy discussions about her divorce from the TV star, claimed The Sun. </p>

<p>The publication first alleged the TV veteran offered up more than half of his estimated £50m fortune, but was 'delighted' that the case has come to an end as he can 'move on', two years after announcing their split.</p>

<p>However, as the news broke, the former Deuce musician took to Twitter to deny the reports, posting: 'Nope a load of nonsense AGAIN....' </p>

<p>Since splitting from his ex-wife in 2018, Ant has splashed £6m on a seven-bedroom mansion complete with vaulted roof and media room for him and girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett in West London.</p>

<p>Teecourt Limited made £3m in the year to June 2018, reports The Sun. This time period covers the first part of his presenting break after his drink-drive arrest. </p>

<p>Despite having some time off in this period, Ant and Dec were recently reported to have cashed in at least £15,124 a day last year after making an epic return to the small screen together.</p>

<p>According to records, the hefty sum was paid into just one of their firms, Hurley Promotions Ltd, with the company's profits increasing from £4.5 million to £5.5 million between 2018 and 2019.  </p>

<p>The iconic hosting duo joined forces at the Britain's Got Talent auditions for the first time in January 2019 following nearly a year off from working on TV together. </p>

<p>Ant's personal issues saw him sit out the last few episodes of BGT, as well as Ant &amp; Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, in spring 2018.</p>

<p>Cashing in: It comes following reports Ant and Dec cashed in at least £15,124 a day last year after making an epic return to the small screen together </p>

<p>As Geordie presenter Dec was forced to front the latter episodes of their famous shows alone, as well as I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! with Holly Willoughby, he made £5,289,051 from June 2018 to June 2019.</p>

<p>According to The Sun, more than £4 million came through his company Deecourt Limited, while the remaining profit was paid into firms he co-owns with Ant.    </p>

<p>Ant first sought rehab treatment in June 2017 after becoming addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol following a botched knee surgery in 2015. </p>

<p>He entered rehab for a second time in March 2018 after he was involved in a three-car collision in Richmond and was discovered to be over the limit behind the wheel.</p>

<p>The TV veteran pleaded guilty to drink-driving the following month and he received a record-breaking £86,000 fine, as well as a 20-month ban from driving.   </p>

<p>Ant and Dec, who have been presenting together since 1994, are estimated to be worth a whopping £62 million. </p>
