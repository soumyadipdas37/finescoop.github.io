<p>Rittenhouse, 17, is accused of shooting dead two protesters and injuring another during civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin on August 25. </p>

<p>The teen's attorneys say he acted in self-defense and have portrayed him as a courageous patriot who was exercising his right to bear arms during riots over the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake. </p>

<p>Organizers of the new fundraiser on GiveSendGo - billed as the '#1 Free Christian Crowdfunding Site' - agree, stating on the page: ' Kyle is being unfairly charged with murder by a District Attorney who seems determined only to capitalize on the political angle of the situation.</p>

<p>'Kyle and his family will undoubtedly need money to pay for the legal fees. Let's give back to someone who bravely tried to defend his community.'</p>

<p>As of Tuesday morning, more than 12,330 people have donated to the fund, with the current amount of money raised totaling $524,190.  </p>

<p>Hundreds of supporters have also left comments on the GiveSendGo page, including one who wrote: 'God is on your side. Thanks for being a patriot and defending the American way of life from those who want to destroy it.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'May God protect you and watch over you all the days of your life. You are an American hero.'</p>

<p>The GiveSendGo page is one of several fundraisers that have been set up to support Rittenhouse. </p>

<p>A #FightBack fundraiser has raised $2.1 million for Rittenhouse. </p>

<p>A description on that fundraiser states: 'We stand ready to protect and defend the constitutional rights, livelihoods and property of people and businesses that are being targeted and destroyed. We stand for the forgotten American - those who are silenced and intimidated.'</p>

<p>Rittenhouse's bail has been set at $2million, but it is unclear whether the money will go toward funding his release from jail. </p>

<p>He is currently being held in an Illinois prison, and is next set to appear in court on October 9. </p>

<p>Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the killing of two protesters: Joseph Rosenbaum (left) and Anthony Huber (right)</p>

<p>On August 25, Rittenhouse traveled from his home in Antioch, Illinois to Kenosha, Wisconsin to 'protect the streets' amid civil unrest sparked over the police shooting of Jacob Blake.  </p>

<p>Cellphone videos from the night show chaotic scenes.  </p>

<p>According to prosecutors and court documents, Rittenhouse shot and killed 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum after Rosenbaum threw a plastic bag at Rittenhouse, missing him, and tried to wrestle his rifle away.</p>

<p>Video shows that Rittenhouse subsequently tripped in the street. Anthony Huber, 26, hit him with a skateboard and tried to take his rifle away. Rittenhouse opened fire, killing Huber and wounding bystander Gaige Grosskreutz, who was holding a handgun at the time.</p>

<p>Rittenhouse returned to his Illinois home and turned himself in soon after.</p>

<p>Rittenhouse then shot and injured Gaige Grosskreutz, who was holding a handgun at the time, as he approached the teenager</p>

<p>The incident came at the tail-end of a tumultuous summer that commenced with the  Memorial Day death of unarmed black man George Floyd at the hands of police.  </p>

<p>Floyd's death sparked nationwide protests with demonstrators calling for an end to systemic racism. At times, tensions have boiled over, with riots, looting and arson occurring in numerous cities across the US. </p>

<p>Standoffs between police and protesters, as well as activists from rival groups, have often exploded into violence. Police officers, protesters and bystanders have been killed. </p>

<p>The turbulence has continued into the fall, with Antifa gunman Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, shot and killed by US Marshals in Washington state on September 5. </p>

<p>Reinhoel had been charged with the murder of right-wing activist Aaron 'Jay' Danielson, 39, during a protest in downtown Portland on August 29.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a demonstration by right-wing group Proud Boys took place in Portland last weekend, with many waving placards calling for the release of Rittenhouse. </p>

<p>Last week,  Rittenhouse participated in the hearing at the Lake County Circuit Court in Illinois via video link from the detention facility where he is being held. </p>

<p>There are calls for him to be extradited from Illinois to Kenosha, Wisconsin. </p>

<p>Rittenhouse's lawyers asked for a month to prepare arguments challenging extradition that he said involve 'issues of some complexity, frankly that have not arisen in the country for some time'. </p>

<p>The judge, Paul Novak, gave 14 days for the defense to review papers and file pleadings ahead of an October 9 hearing.  </p>

<p>The teen's attorneys have described Rittenhouse not as a vigilante, but as a model citizen who was cleaning graffiti from a vandalized high school before he received word from a business owner seeking help to protect what was left of his property after rioters burned two of his other buildings. </p>
