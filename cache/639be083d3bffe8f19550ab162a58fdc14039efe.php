<p>Lesandro ‘Junior’ Guzman-Feliz was chased though the Bronx and butchered with machetes by a Dominican street gang who mistook him for someone else in a notorious 2018 killing.</p>

<p>But speaking on a Columbia University panel, Krug dismissed Guzman-Feliz, a member of the NYPD’s Explorers youth program, as a ‘collaborator’ who worked against his own community and was targeted because ‘snitches get stitches’. </p>

<p>Speaking on a Columbia University panel, Jessica Krug dismissed Guzman-Feliz, a member of the NYPD’s Explorers youth program, as a ‘collaborator’ who worked against his own community and was targeted because ‘snitches get stitches’</p>

<p>Lesandro (Junior) Guzman-Feliz was chased though the Bronx and butchered with machetes by a Dominican street gang who mistook him for someone else in a notorious 2018 killing</p>

<p>‘It’s so much more difficult to understand what kind of freedom we could achieve by being willing to confront those who are working against the interests of the community,’ she said, going unchallenged as she appeared to endorse the grisly murder. </p>

<p>Krug, 38 – a white, Jewish woman from Kansas City, Missouri - admitted last week that she had pretended to be black for decades while becoming a prominent opponent of systemic racism and a professor of African Studies at George Washington University. </p>

<p>‘How many people are familiar with Lesandro Guzman-Feliz, a 15-year-old boy who was murdered in the Bronx last year,’ she says in a 2019 video clip revealed by DailyMail.com. </p>

<p>‘So if you’re in New York you probably heard a lot about this. And the narrative around it is that he was an innocent kid who was mistaken for a bad kid. He was the kid who was hacked apart with machetes in front of a bodega in the Bronx,’ she says. </p>

<p>‘The idea is that he was mistaken for someone else by Trinitarios, right, who come out of Rikers [Island jail] as most of the radical politics of New York City has done for many, many years. </p>

<p>‘But the part of the story that gets emphasized in different ways is that he was an Explorer, right, which is a program that the NYPD has to bring youth in to eventually work for them.’ </p>

<p>Lesandro ‘Junior’ Guzman-Feliz's murder outside a bodega in NYC was caught on camera</p>

<p>Five men were found guilty of Lesandro ‘Junior’ Guzman-Feliz's murder and handed life sentences</p>

<p>Krug compared the frenzied attack to ‘necklacing’, the gruesome execution method used to punish black police informants in Apartheid-era South African where a rubber tire filled with fuel would be placed round someone’s neck or chest and set ablaze. </p>

<p>‘When I think about this politics of silence that I’m talking about in the archives and about how silence can be a really radical presence historically, I think it’s a radical presence today when people talk about snitches get stitches or when we think about a history of anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa and necklacing,’ she goes on.</p>

<p>‘That kind of violence against people who are collaborating or working against their communities we have to consider a radical moment in 2018 in which people are using machetes to hack apart a 15-year-old boy who’s working with the police. </p>

<p>‘The way the story about his innocence and the inherent violence about the people who hacked him apart become the narrative we tell, about how the loss of innocence is the story we mourn, and it’s so much more difficult to understand what kind of freedom could we achieve by being willing to confront those within the community who are working against the interests of the community as a whole at the end of a machete.’ </p>

<p>The clip revealed by DailyMail.com ends before anyone has had a chance to ask questions but as she wraps her remarks Krug receives an enthusiastic round of applause. </p>

<p>She was listed as a speaker at an April 2019 event hosted by the college’s Black Studies Department to discuss ‘social solidarity and activism now taking shape across the African diaspora’. </p>

<p>Guzman-Feliz, who was of Dominican descent, tried to take refuge inside a bodega when knife-wielding thugs mistook him for a rival gang member and chased him on June 20, 2018. </p>

<p>Theslain boy’s mom Leandra Feliz told a judge: ‘There were two deaths: Junior and I, who was left dead inside.’ She is pictured above with her son</p>

<p>Security camera footage later went viral revealing the sickening moment the teenager, who dreamt of becoming an NYPD detective, was dragged out of the store and fatally attacked. </p>

<p>A year later, five men were found guilty of his murder and handed life sentences after the slain boy’s mom Leandra Feliz told a judge: ‘There were two deaths: Junior and I, who was left dead inside.’ </p>

<p>DailyMail.com revealed last week how Krug – a self-styled 'unrepentant and unreformed child of the hood' – grew up in a middle class, white family and attended private school before breaking off contact with her relations after entering academia. </p>

<p>A family source revealed that the identity politics stalwart even skipped her mother Sherry’s funeral in 2013, perhaps because relatives would rumble her attempts to pass herself off as a black woman and radical opponent of the white patriarchy. </p>

<p>Despite assuming various black and Hispanic identities over the years, Krug revealed in a Medium blog post last Thursday that she had been deceiving her friends and colleagues for decades. </p>

<p>In a lengthy confession titled 'The Truth, and the Anti-Black Violence of My Lies', she wrote: 'For the better part of my adult life, every move I've made, every relationship I've formed, has been rooted in the napalm toxic soil of lies. </p>

<p>'To an escalating degree over my adult life, I have eschewed my lived experience as a white Jewish child in suburban Kansas City under various assumed identities within a Blackness that I had no right to claim: first North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness.’ </p>

<p>After Krug’s mea culpa made global headlines, some fellow academics cast doubt on her honesty, saying she only came clean because Hispanic scholars were about to out her. </p>

<p>George Washington University has said Krug will not be teaching in the Fall however her outraged colleagues are pushing for her time at the DC-based school to be put to a permanent end. </p>

<p>'She has betrayed the trust of countless current and former students, fellow scholars of Africana Studies, colleagues in our department and throughout the historical discipline, as well as community activists in New York City and beyond,' the university's history department said in a statement. </p>

<p>'The discipline of history is concerned with truth telling about the past. With her conduct, Dr. Krug has raised questions about the veracity of her own research and teaching.'</p>
