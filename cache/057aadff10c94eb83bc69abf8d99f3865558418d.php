<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England wheeled out the big guns on Monday when handed their first opportunity this season to unite the red and white ball squads for six matches against Australia.</p>

<p>Only Ben Stokes, on compassionate leave, and Jason Roy through injury were ruled out when the selectors met for one last time in this unique summer to pick their 'strongest possible side' for Twenty20 and 50-over series against the old enemy.</p>

<p>Those selections said much about England's thinking ahead of the first of two Twenty20 World Cups that is now scheduled to take place in India next year.</p>

<p>England wheeled out the big guns as they name their 'strongest possible squad' for Australia</p>

<p>Only Ben Stokes (pictured), on compassionate leave, and Jason Roy (injury) were ruled out</p>

<p>Jofra Archer will make his first white-ball appearances for England since the dramatic conclusion of the World Cup last year when he attempts to put a largely disappointing red-ball summer behind him in both formats against the Aussies.</p>

<p>He is joined in both squads by Mark Wood, unlucky to make only one Test appearance against West Indies this season, as England prepare to throw pace and power at Australia at the Ageas Bowl and then Emirates Old Trafford.</p>

<p>But Joe Root is running out of time to force his way back into contention for that Twenty20 World Cup a year in October. Not even a productive return to Yorkshire over the Bank Holiday weekend was enough to earn him a short-form place.</p>

<p>David Willey was hugely unfortunate to be left out of both squads, particularly in 50-over cricket where he returned in July to become player of the series against Ireland after the agony of his last-gasp omission from the World Cup last year.</p>

<p>Dawid Malan has included in the Twenty20 squad but is competing for one starting place</p>

<p>Tom Banton, 21, is clearly a huge prospect, as he showed with 71 against Pakistan</p>

<p>The one certainty is that competition for white-ball places is stronger than ever and there will be an extra incentive for two batsmen in particular tonight in what is expected to be an unchanged England team for their final T20 match against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Tom Banton and Dawid Malan are both included in the Twenty20 squad but, even in the absence of Stokes and Roy, seem to be competing for one starting place against Australia when they face Pakistan at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>Jos Buttler is expected to return at the top of the order, probably alongside Jonny Bairstow, which means Malan could again be the odd man out on Friday even though he could not do too much more than make seven 50s in his 12 Twenty20 appearances to date.</p>

<p>'Everything we do is try to build such strength in depth we have a range of options in all different positions,' said national selector Ed Smith. 'That's what we've got at the top of the order in white-ball cricket. There are so many good players the question is fitting them all in, but as headaches go you'd rather have that than the other type.'</p>

<p>Banton, at 21, is clearly a huge prospect, as he showed with 71 in the abandoned first international against Pakistan. His potential will probably give him the edge over 32-year-old Malan, who seems to have to do more than most to prove he belongs.</p>

<p>'I'm excited about the performances of both,' insisted Smith. 'Tom Banton has got an incredibly high ceiling and we're now starting to see what he's capable of. What Dawid has done is take his opportunity extremely well whenever he's been given one. It reminds me of the situation a few years ago when Jonny Bairstow had to wait a long time for his chance in one-day cricket. That's a really good model to follow.'</p>

<p>At least both feature in the short-form squad - unlike the England Test captain who was in the Twenty20 runs again for Yorkshire on Monday and could not make his determination to play in all formats clearer.</p>

<p>'I don't think any door is closed to Joe Root,' said Smith. 'He's a brilliant cricketer and an outstanding man but he's also England's Test captain and at the moment we are setting up in a particular way as an XI in T20 cricket and Joe's not in that. That could easily change but he's played a lot and we felt it's not right to have him in the squad when he's not likely to start.'</p>

<p>Willey might not have an international future at all beyond the last game against Pakistan when he seems certain to be left stewing on the Old Trafford bench.</p>

<p>David Willey was said to be 'not happy' with his exclusion, with England preferring Sam Curran</p>

<p>Willey was said to be 'not happy' with his exclusion, with England preferring Sam Curran as an all-round left-arm package.</p>

<p>Smith confirmed that when he said he had an 'honest and open' conversation with Willey on Monday. 'Everything David achieved against Ireland has been noted but in this instance we are giving opportunities to other people,' said Smith. 'It was a tough decision. I've had a number of difficult conversations with David. He's disappointed but what you always get with him is a dignified man who will make his position clear.'</p>

<p>Now it is down to the all-powerful Morgan to decide who makes the final XI against Australia after he has tried to wrap up another series win against Pakistan on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>'After a very demanding summer we still want to field our strongest XI against Australia and it's a wonderful opportunity to finish on a really strong note after all the hard work behind the scenes,' added Smith.</p>

<p>There is a huge incentive for Banton and Malan in particular to end the Pakistan series on a strong note on Tuesday night - to try and make sure they face Australia.</p>
