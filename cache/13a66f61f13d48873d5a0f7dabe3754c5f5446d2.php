<p>Captioning the gif to her Instagram, she penned: '#spinning into Tuesday #halo dress.'    </p>

<p>Her stylish post comes after she spoke about the BGT's Black Lives Matter controversy on Monday's episode of Good Morning Britain with Piers Morgan. </p>

<p>Wow: In keeping with her minimal look, the TV star opted for heeled nude sandals and simple studs ahead of her Heart Radio show</p>

<p>She said: 'It is extraordinary. I think the number of negative complaints means this conversation is right and fundamental and should continue to happen. </p>

<p>'What hasn’t really been highlighted is the fact that we were inundated with overwhelming positive response, hundreds of thousands of them.</p>

<p>'As BGT family, and Diversity is very much part of that family, and Ashley is doing a phenomenal job on BGT, we stand by him and stand by that performance 100 per cent.'</p>

<p>The star added of Ashley Banjo: 'He sends out positive vibes to both the haters and the lovers of the piece that they did. He is saddened by negativity.'</p>

<p>Beauty: She accentuated her glowing complexion with a dash of highlighter over her cheekbones and a touch of mascara over her fluttery eyelashes</p>

<p>Ofcom complaints have soared to 21,673 following the performance, which featured a portrayal of a policeman kneeling on Ashley Banjo's neck. </p>

<p>On the show Piers reiterated his support for the routine saying: 'If you can't handle that without feeling the need to never watch BGT again or to complain to Ofcom, there's something wrong with you. </p>

<p>'You, you're the problem! You're part of the problem.'</p>

<p>He added: 'By the way, if you don't like me saying this, then don't watch us either. Don't watch Good Morning Britain. Because I agree with Ashley Banjo and Diversity. And if you can't handle it Britain, wake up.' </p>
