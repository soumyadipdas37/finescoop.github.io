<p>Online court records show Emrik's stepmother, 27-year-old Monique Osuna, has been charged with murder, and the child’s father, Erik Osuna-Gutierrez, 29, has been charged with felony injury to a child, infliction of great bodily harm and destruction of evidence. </p>

<p>Monique Osuna, 27, (left), has been charged with murder in the beating death of her nine-year-old stepson. The boy's father, Erik Osuna-Gutierrez, 29 (right), has been charged with felony injury to a child, infliction of great bodily harm and destruction of evidence</p>

<p>Emrik Osuna, nine, was found not breathing and without a heartbeat at his family's home in Idaho on Tuesday night  </p>

<p>Neither of them have had the opportunity to enter a plea, and court records show the Ada County Public Defender’s office has been assigned to handle their cases. </p>

<p>During a hearing on Thursday, a prosecutor detailed what she described as months of 'horrific' torture that Emrik had endured at the hands of his stepmother, reported KTVB.</p>

<p>'Due to COVID, she's been working from home and since [Emrik] was not in school, she essentially had access to him all day long,' Tamara Kelly said in court.</p>

<p>Osuna reportedly has admitted to police that she had kicked her stepson in the groin and beat him with various objects, among them a frying pan, a wooden spoon, a backscratcher and a belt, which she later swapped for a dog leash because it was heavier. </p>

<p>The married mother-of-four also allegedly tortured Emrik by locking him in a closet at night, feeding him nothing but rice and water for weeks, and subjecting him to strenuous physical exercise as punishment, including protracted wall sits and jumping jacks. </p>

<p>Police and paramedics were called to the Osunas' home in Meridian nearly five hours after Osuna-Gutierrez texted his wife that Emrik needed to go to the hospital  </p>

<p>Osuna allegedly admitted to kicking her stepson in the groin and beating Emrik with a pan, a wooden spoon, a belt and a dog leash. The torture took place while she worked from home</p>

<p>At the time of his death, Emrik was covered in bruises and vomit, and was severely dehydrated and malnourished </p>

<p>According to the prosecutor, Osuna only allowed Emrik to stop exercising when she took a break from work. </p>

<p>The boy's father allegedly was aware of the abuse but failed to stop it.  </p>

<p>later switching from the belt to a dog leash because the leash was "heavier."</p>

<p>"In combination with this physical abuse, this defendant admitted to what is essentially torture of E.O. by locking him in a small closet at night to sleep, withholding food, making him do physical strenuous punishments while she was working," Kelly said.</p>

<p>Kelly said Emrik was forced to do jumping jacks and wall sits for long periods of time, only allowed to stop for a moment when his stepmother took a break from her work.</p>

<p>Emrik's father, Erik Osuna, knew that his wife was abusing the 9-year-old, but did nothing to stop her, Kelly said.</p>

<p>The prosecutor also said there is evidence that the couple waiting more than four hours to seek help for Emrik as he lay dying at home. </p>

<p>Emrik lived with his four step-siblings, ages nine, four and four months (pictured above with his brothers) </p>

<p>Osuna-Gutierrez (left and right) allegedly was aware of the abuse targeting his son but failed to stop it  </p>

<p>At around 5pm on Tuesday, Erik texted his wife, telling her that they needed to take his son to the hospital, and that he was scared. </p>

<p>But it was not until just before 9.40pm that evening that the Meridian Police Department received a 911 call reporting that a child was not breathing. </p>

<p>Emergency responders arrived at the Rushmore Apartments in the 1000 block of W. Broadway Avenue and found Emrik with no heartbeat. </p>

<p>'Officers observed that the victim showed signs of abuse,' according to a police press release. </p>

<p>EMS crews performed CPR on the nine-year-old before transporting him to St Luke's Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.  </p>

<p>Kelly said in court that an examination revealed that Emrik was severely dehydrated and malnourished, and had numerous injuries all over his body. </p>

<p>Osuna allegedly locked Emrik in a closet at night, fed him nothing but rice and water and subjected him to strenuous physical exercise</p>

<p>A prosecutor said Osuna-Gutierrez is a flight risk because he is in the US illegally </p>

<p>'Some of the bruises were extremely large and essentially covered the back of his body,' she said. </p>

<p>The couple's three other children, ages nine, four and four months, were placed into protective custody with Idaho Health and Welfare.</p>

<p>The prosecutor asked the judge to keep both parents in jail and away from their surviving children, and argued that Erik Osuna is a flight risk because he is an undocumented immigrant with few ties to Idaho.</p>

<p>The judge ordered the couple held on $2million bond each and barred them from having contact with their children. The parents are due back in court for a preliminary hearing on September 17.    </p>
