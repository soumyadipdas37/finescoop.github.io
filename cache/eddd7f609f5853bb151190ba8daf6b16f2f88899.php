<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bear hilariously faced off against a team of plastic ducks after breaking into a newly-built koi pond for a quick swim.</p>

<p>Footage captured in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, shows a large bear wander over to the pond before slowly submerging into the water.</p>

<p>The pond's owner, who filmed the footage, is heard telling the bear to 'get out of there!'</p>

<p>A black bear enters a newly-built koi pond in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, for a quick dip in the water</p>

<p>The bear slowly paddles its way around the pond, munching on the plant matter and vegetation floating on the surface of the water</p>

<p>After entering the water, the bear slowly paddles around the pond, chewing on some of the floating plants and vegetation.</p>

<p>The bear seemed carefree until it came across a collection of yellow plastic ducks and two life-like fake duck floating on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The deep water forces the bear to stand on its hind legs as it approaches one of the yellow ducks. </p>

<p>The duck receives a curious paw swipe from the bear before it tries to chew on the fake bird.</p>

<p>It doesn't take long for the bear to notice one of the bright yellow plastic ducks floating on the water. The duck receives a curious paw swipe from the bear before it tries to chew on the fake bird</p>

<p>Then the bear notices a life-like plastic duck also floating on the water and it wanders over for a closer inspection. It gets its foot caught in fishing wire under the duck giving the impression the duck had charged at the bear</p>

<p>The pond's owner is heard saying: 'It's killing my duck, my plastic duck!'</p>

<p>This is followed by the bear 'attacking' one of the life-like ducks after getting its leg caught on some fishing string below the duck - making it seem like the animal had charged the bear.</p>

<p>After pawing and chewing the duck to make sure it was no longer a threat, the bear slowly paddles off again to eat more of the plant matter.</p>

<p>The footage was originally filmed on July 24 but recently re-emerged on social media.</p>

<p>The black bear quickly leaps backwards through the water and tries to grab the duck in its powerful jaws to eliminate the 'threat'</p>

<p>After a tentative paw and a good chew, the bear realises that the duck is nothing more than another fake and begins swimming off to munch on more vegetation</p>

<p>Speaking about the bear's antics, the pond owner said: 'We just finished building our koi pond In June and we've seen a few bears walk around it but never went in before.</p>

<p>'It was over 90° f that day on to of the mountain so the koi pond was a perfect place for the bear to cool off. </p>

<p>'The bear didn't bother any of our fish, crayfish, or frogs. It did leave a few small puncture holes in the pond liner but they were an easy fix.'</p>

<p>Only black bears are found in Pennsylvania and it is believed that around 20,000 of the animals currently call the state home.</p>
