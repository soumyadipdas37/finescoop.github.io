<p>The My Happiness rockers didn't however rule out attending the final from the stand.</p>

<p>'Might see some of you at the Gabba Oct 24 but we will just have a beer and a pie in hand not guitars. Love Yez, PF'.</p>

<p>Back In May, the Aussie rockers fueled speculation they would reunite after 350,000 viewers streamed the band's 'one night only' show.</p>

<p>Reunion? Powderfinger have sparked even more rumours they are set to reunite after pulling in 350,000 streams for their 'one night only' charity concert in May</p>

<p>The rockers, including frontman Bernard Fanning join bandmates Darren Middleton, Jon Coghill, John Collins and Ian Haug, had reunited for the first time since splitting in 2010, to take part in an online streaming event to help Australia's struggling music industry during the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>The event raised more than $427,000 and was donated to Support Act along with Beyond Blue, who support those with mental health struggles.</p>

<p>Following the concert, frontman Bernard, 50, told the Daily Telegraph he was pleased they still had their unique sound. </p>

<p>Rumours: The band's recent success has sparked speculation they will go on a reunion tour</p>

<p>'One thing I will say about it is there is no one making music that sounds like us at the moment so hopefully the concert creates a point of difference and can contribute to the re-emergence of people playing instruments,' he told the paper.  </p>

<p>'I see that at my own shows, younger people in the audience requesting Powderfinger songs,' he said.   </p>

<p>'An interesting part of this (live performance) is that it opens it up to a whole lot of new people.' </p>

<p>Powderfinger split in November 2010, after playing their final show in Brisbane.  </p>
