<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sydney is set to swelter on Thursday when temperatures are expected to soar to 29C.</p>

<p>However forecasters have warned that the unseasonably warm weather will be followed by wild winds and dust storms </p>

<p>A cold front moving across the southern part of the country from South Australia is being prefaced with strong, northerly winds.  </p>

<p>'Last time we had these winds they picked up a lot of dust in South Australia, which was then transported to NSW,' Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Helen Kirkup told Daily Mail Australia.  </p>

<p>'It will likely happen again this time around but winds have changed directions, so different parts of the state may be covered with dust.'</p>

<p>Australia's east coast is set to warm up as spring sets in - but some parts of the area will be hammered with wild winds and dust storms. Pictured: Sunbathers at Bondi Beach on August 30</p>

<p>Sydney is set to swelter in 29C on Thursday, which is 9C above average. Pictured: Graph of weather in Australia on Thursday</p>

<p>She said it was unlikely that the dust would be able to cross the Great Dividing Ranges.</p>

<p>Ms Kirkup said that the west and south-west part of the state will have this week's warmest day on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The north and east will have it's warmest day tomorrow before a cooler change comes through with a second cold front.</p>

<p>The north-east part of New South Wales may not see this cold front until early on Sunday. </p>

<p>There is a severe wind warning in place for parts of the Illawarra, Snowy Mountains, ACT, Southern Tablelands, Gosford and South West Slopes.</p>

<p>Towns that may be impacted include Goulburn, Cooma, Yass, Cabramurra, Selwyn and Adaminaby. </p>

<p>Winds with an average of 60km/h to 70km/h with peak gusts in excess of 90km/h are expected to brew on Wednesday.</p>

<p>However Alpine areas higher than 1,900m could see peak gusts of more that 120km/h due to the cold front. </p>

<p>Ms Kirkup said Canberra itself is unlikely to be impact but the ranges above of it will be.           </p>

<p>'The northerly wind will be the issue,' she said.</p>

<p>'It is possible when the winds turn southerly, we may see a few thunderstorms but that will only be in the southern regions and South West Slopes.'</p>

<p>In Western Australia, Perth will experience rain on Wednesday that should have cleared by early evening. </p>

<p>The city should expect dry conditions until Sunday when heavy rain is expected. </p>

<p>Adelaide will see clear skies on Wednesday before rain will cover the city until Sunday, when it will be sunny.</p>

<p>States such as Victoria and Tasmania will experience cooler weather due to the two cold fronts </p>

<p>The brutal winds in South Australia will be pushed across to Melbourne on Wednesday but the weather is expected to settle by Friday. </p>

<p>Hobart will also have a windy Wednesday before a possible shower on Friday.</p>

<p>Canberra will see temperatures of just 10C on Saturday morning but, will see average temperatures of 17C and 20C the rest of the week.</p>

<p>Temperatures will reach mid-30s in Darwin during the day and Brisbane should avoid the windy weather set to batter most of the east coast.   </p>
