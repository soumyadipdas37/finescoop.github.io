<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A children's doll company has copped even more backlash after a mother spotted a tiny penis on one of its popular toys.   </p>

<p>Bianca Stone, from Queensland, bought the L.O.L Surprise! doll from a local Coles for her daughter on Monday only to discover X-rated private parts. </p>

<p>'It was certainly a big (little) surprise when my five-year-old unwrapped her new L.O.L doll to find he was anatomically correct,' she told 7News.</p>

<p>Ms Stone took a photo of the seemingly innocent doll wearing a t-shirt and pants, but after taking the toy's clothes off a small penis could be seen.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted MGA Entertainment for comment.</p>

<p>The X-rated surprise comes a month after Big W removed a series of L.O.L surprise dolls from their shelves in response to a series of complaints after a mother exposed the toys' 'hidden feature' online. </p>

<p>Kate Worsfold, from Brisbane, went viral in August after uploading a Facebook video demonstrating how the popular toys changed into lingerie and bondage clothing when dunked in cold water.  </p>

<p>The brand, made by American company MGA Entertainment, is sold at toy stores across Australia, including Target, Kmart, and Big W. </p>

<p>Big W, owned by Woolworths group, told Daily Mail Australia that one range would be stripped after customers expressed concern. </p>

<p>Brisbane mum Kate Worsfold (pictured) went viral in August after sharing a video on Facebook urging parents to avoid LOL Surprise Dolls after discovering  hidden 'sexualised' outfits on her daughter's toys</p>

<p>'We have listened to our customers' concerns and have made the decision to remove the range of LOL Surprise #hairvibes dolls from our shelves,' a Big W spokesperson said. </p>

<p>'We continue to work closely with our supplier to ensure that future ranges of LOL Surprise at BIG W are consistent with our customer's feedback.'</p>

<p>The line, marketed for children aged six and up, features little girl figurines that are stylised to look like adults. </p>

<p>Disturbing sexualised outfits appear on dolls bodies once dipped into icy water, including shackles around the wrists, nipple coverings, skimpy underwear, tattoos, suspenders, long black boots and body nets.  </p>

<p>One doll when chilled had the word 'caution' scrawled over her private parts. </p>

<p>While Ms Worsfold welcomed Big W's change, she said removing only one range of the dolls was not 'good enough'.  </p>

<p>L.O.L. Surprise dolls are figurines of little girls made by US company MGA Entertainment and sold in Kmart, Big W and Target stores across Australia</p>

<p>Some dolls' secret outfits include body nets, tattoos, nipple coverings, long black boots and suspenders</p>

<p>'As far as I'm concerned you don't just pull one weed out, you pull them all out, one does not make a difference,' she told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'It is like they are pulling just one range to keep customers quiet. It falls under their accountability. Silence is consent.'  </p>

<p>Louise Newman, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, said the dolls fall into a longstanding culture in marketing practices of sexualising young children. </p>

<p>However, she said campaigns have alarmingly shifted towards hiding messaging compared to past advertisements which were more transparent in their goals to sell adult products to children. </p>

<p>'There is a lot of concern about what is being marketed to children and how it models adult sexualisation,' she said.  </p>

<p>'There is a subliminal message that being sexy and flirty when they are young is appropriate. Children need to be learning about sexual behaviour in the context of growing up.' </p>

<p>She said the practice is dangerous as it can de-sensitive children to adult sexuality, potentially making them more vulnerable to predators. </p>

<p>'One thing predators will count on is kids being vulnerable,' she said.</p>

<p>'This sort of marketing is a part of a culture of breeding that it is okay for children to be exposed to these messages, and people are not on the lookout for it like they should be.</p>

<p>'If kids are getting a message that it is okay to do sex things, some people will take advantage of that.</p>

<p>'There needs to be more control over what is marketed to children and a push to avoid sexualised advertising. Children do not need this. It does not need to be there.' </p>

<p>The #hairvibes range (pictured) is marketed for children aged six and up, and sold at Myers, Target, and Kmart</p>

<p>Parents from across the world have been flocking to online forums to share photos of the hidden outfits they have discovered on their daughters' dolls</p>
