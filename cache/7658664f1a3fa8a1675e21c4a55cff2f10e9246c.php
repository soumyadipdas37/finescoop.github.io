<p>'We were living on separate sides of the country even though we were physically far apart, we were emotionally quite distant as well. </p>

<p>'And this time period, I'm extremely lucky that it has brought us physically close together because now we're living in the same house but also emotionally, and I finally understand that this person is somebody who I can trust with my life and I will have my security and protection at the front point of their heart no matter what.'</p>
