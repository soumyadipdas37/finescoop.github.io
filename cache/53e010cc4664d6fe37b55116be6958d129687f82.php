<p>Moving? Avengers: Endgame action star Zoe Saldana attended an open house with her parents Aridio and Asalia where they toured a $2.5M house in Los Angeles on Thursday</p>

<p>Lovely: The half-Dominican, half-Puerto Rican 42-year-old wore a striped black midi-skirt with a white long-sleeve top, tan sandals, and a brown face mask to protect herself and others from the coronavirus</p>

<p>It's unclear if Saldana - who loves the Malibu lifestyle - was interested in living there herself or if she was just there for her folks.</p>

<p>The two-story home features six bedrooms and five bathrooms, which could easily fit the Quibi Princess Bride guest star and her family-of-five.</p>

<p>There's a beautiful breakfast nook featuring a small office space and shelves leading directly to the kitchen.</p>

<p>A halo light hangs above the living room surrounded by windows and dark hardwood floors.  </p>
