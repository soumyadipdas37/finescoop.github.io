<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>His sisters live in palatial piles, but it appears James Middleton is looking for somewhere decidedly more low-key for his martial home with fiancée Alizée Thevenet.</p>

<p>The couple, who have had to postpone their wedding twice this year due to Covid-19, were spotted today viewing a one-bedroom home in south-west London - just a stone's throw from the home Pippa Middleton, 37, shares with her husband and son. </p>

<p>The property boasts its own terrace and three garages - a rarity for central London - but is otherwise far more modest than one might expect, with a quick glance at the photos revealing a tired-looking exterior and a terrace in need of some TLC.</p>

<p>However its enviable location means even this unpretentious starter home comes at an eye-watering listing price of £895,000.</p>

<p>Posting a series of holiday pictures from a couple's getaway in Sicily, he wrote: 'It’s a year since I asked Alizée to marry me… what a year it’s been! Two homes, lockdown, two attempts at a wedding, a litter of puppies, launching of new company <?php echo e('@'); ?>ella.co, a beard shave, and much more.'</p>
