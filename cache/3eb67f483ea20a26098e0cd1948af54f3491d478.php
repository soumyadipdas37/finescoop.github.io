<p>As reported by MailOnline, United have been offered the chance to sign the 22-year-old Serbia international from the Spanish champions.</p>

<p>Zidane is said to be open to a loan move with United reportedly leading the chase to sign the player, although Italian clubs Inter, AC Milan and Roma are also in the hunt. </p>

<p>Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign Luka Jovic on loan from Real Madrid</p>

<p>Serbia international Jovic has struggled to nail down a first-team place at Real Madrid</p>

<p>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is said to looking to bring in a new striker</p>

<p>Asked about Jovic in his press conference ahead of Wednesday's La Liga match with Real Valladolid, Zidane said: 'You have to take everything into account. Until the fifth [of October], the market is open.</p>

<p>'We will see. The players are fine and that's what interests me.'</p>

<p>The forward joined Madrid from Eintracht Frankfurt for £55m last year but has managed just two goals in 28 appearances and has been hampered by niggling injuries. </p>

<p>The striker started only four La Liga games last season and netted just twice, a far cry from his prolific final year in the Bundesliga.</p>

<p>Zinedine Zidane wouldn't deny Jovic's Real Madrid exit before the transfer window closes</p>

<p>He netted a devastating 27 goals for Frankfurt that season, including 10 in their run to the semi-finals of the Europa League, where they were beaten by Chelsea. </p>

<p>Tottenham also discussed the possibility of signing Jovic during negotiations to sign Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon, but ultimately opted against it.</p>

<p>United's main forward target remains Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho but, with finances restricted, they are exploring other options in case they fail to prise the winger away from Germany.</p>

<p>Inter Milan's Ivan Perisic is an option on loan while they have also been offered former Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani, who is a free agent.</p>
