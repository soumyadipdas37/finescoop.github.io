<p>In honor of September being National Suicide Prevention Month, the brunette beauty Instagrammed a baby photo of herself shot by legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz with a poignant caption. </p>

<p>I have low days, and in my lowest of lows, limbs heavy from exhaustion, I have questioned if I have the energy to keep pushing another day. Truly a horrifying sentiment to have swimming in your head. But then I try to remember, I do it for her. I do it because she needs a voice, a champion, a Big Kid; To tell her it’s ok, that she is safe that she is protected. If you look in the mirror and feel like what stares back is not worthy of love and care, if you can’t trust your own intrinsic value as a human being, do it for them. Do it for them until one day, one alarmingly beautiful day, you can do it for yourself. baby Buu shot by Annie #nationalsuicidepreventionmonth</p>
