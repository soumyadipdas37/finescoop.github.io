<p>'I am completely convinced that there was nothing random about it. She is the daughter I should have...I was on a mission to connect with somebody, and Daisy and I got to meet each other this way at this time. We are so compatible,' she said.</p>

<p>At that time Meg had been separated for six years from ex husband Dennis Quaid, 66, though they were still co-parenting biological son, actor Jack Quaid, 28. </p>

<p>Recently on the relationship front Meg was linked to singer John Mellencamp, 68. The two first started seeing each other in 2011 before calling it quits just three years later in 2014. </p>

<p>A close source to Mellencamp told People that there were definitely some issues which is why Meg called off the engagement.</p>

<p> 'John and Meg have had a volatile relationship from the beginning. They love each other, but there are disagreements which can become issues' the source said. </p>
