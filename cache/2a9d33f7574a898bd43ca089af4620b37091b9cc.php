<p>Brody Roberts was taking his Jeep down a remote logging track in the Mona Mona area when he stumbled across hundreds of revellers packing the secluded area. </p>

<p>'Holy ****!' Roberts said as he tried to navigate around vans, cars and 'half-naked hippies'. </p>

<p>Vehicles and people flanked the road for hundreds of metres as Roberts and his companions speculated a bush party was probably on the night before. </p>

<p>Queensland man Brody Roberts was stunned when he came across the aftermath of an illegal bush rave (pictured) while going off-road west of Cairns last weekend</p>

<p>'It was disgusting. There was rubbish and toilet paper and people sleeping and cars everywhere,' he told the Cairns Post.</p>

<p>He said his group would have passed at least 100 people and it was only 8am. </p>

<p>The 4WD enthusiast said the lack of respect shown for the Kuranda National Park was shocking. </p>

<p>'Every track we drove down there was cars everywhere and bottles of beer and food packets,' he said.</p>

<p>'This is what gets places locked down and us not being able to go there. We were not impressed with that.'</p>

<p>Police were called to the scene and dispersed about 300 people before seizing PA gear, no arrests were made. </p>

<p>Outdoor event promoter Jacob McMillan told Daily Mail Australia he was disappointed to see illegal 'bush doofs' going ahead. </p>

<p>'It's hard to be really critical of these illegal events, as I appreciate that our culture stemmed from the underground,' he said.</p>

<p>'But during COVID times the recent media presence is really damaging for legitimate event promoters that have been working hard over the years to gain council and community acceptance.' </p>
