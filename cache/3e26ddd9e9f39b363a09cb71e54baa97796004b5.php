<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kim Kardashian is marking the one-year anniversary of Skims by enlisted several A-list pals, and a handful of her customers, to show off the brand's most popular designs in a star-studded campaign. </p>

<p>The 39-year-old marked the milestone occasion by posing up for a striking shoot that sees her showing off her iconic curves in a nude shapewear design, while lounging in a room that is filled with pieces from the brand's many collections. </p>

<p>Indeed, in an homage to all that the brand has achieved in the last 12 months, each of the individual shoots that make up the complete campaign see Kim's chosen models posing alongside decorations or items that represent a piece of the label's history, be it a previous campaign, or an old design.  </p>

<p>Milestone: Kim Kardashian has marked the one-year anniversary of her shapewear brand Skims by showing off her famous curves in a stunning new campaign - alongside several celebrity pals, and a handful of customers </p>

<p>Gal pals: Kim also enlisted longtime friend La La Anthony 39, to model for the campaign, which pays tribute to all that Skims has achieved over the past year, by featuring different campaigns, products, and designs in the shoots - even Skims Barbies</p>

<p>Stunner: Bruce Willis' daughter Rumer, 32, also makes an appearance in the campaign, modeling a Skims two-piece set while showing off long brunette curls </p>

<p>Sister sister: Lisa Rinna's model daughters Amelia Gray and Delilah Belle Hamlin look like twins in their shoot, which sees them both modeling short black wigs while posing alongside mannequins with the same blunt hairstyle </p>

<p>Rising star: Kourtney Kardashian's TikTok star pal Addison Rae also poses in the campaign, modeling in a room that has been decorated floor to ceiling in Skims images - and also features Kim's iconic selfie book, an apt addition for the social media star</p>

<p>And in order to best showcase the brand's ethos - that 'Skims is for everybody' - Kim made sure to call upon a diverse group of models to pose in her designs, enlisting both celebrity friends, and consumers, for the special shoot. </p>

<p>As well as the reality star, the campaign also features the likes of Lisa Rinna's model daughters, Delilah Belle and Amelia Gray Hamlin, TV star La La Anthony, Bruce Willis' daughter Rumer, actress Jodie Turner Smith - who is married to Joshua Jackson - model Yovanna Ventura, Sports Illustrated Swimsuit star Precious Lee, and Kourtney Kardashian's TikTok star pal Addison Rae. </p>

<p>However, the campaign also features eight Skims customers, who were invited to step into the spotlight for the groundbreaking shoot - which is the first of its kind for the brand, and was inspired, Kim explained in a statement, by the many fans who have taken to social media to share images of themselves proudly rocking her designs. </p>

<p>'It’s wild to think that it's already been one year since we launched Skims,' the mother-of-four said. </p>

<p>'I’m eternally grateful for the love and support that our customers have shown both me and the brand. I’ve loved seeing everyone’s photos in Skims and reading the comments on social media, and I wanted to use this time, the campaign, and customer gifting to really say thank you. </p>

<p>'The customers are our inspiration for developing new ideas and collections and there is so much more to come. I can’t wait to share it all and continue to grow our amazing community.'  </p>

<p>Stunner: Actress Jodie Turner Smith, who gave birth to her first child with Joshua Jackson just four months ago, lay on the floor in a room surrounded by mirrors to showcase her Skims two-piece set</p>

<p>Vroom vroom! Precious Lee - who was the first black plus-size model to appear in the pages of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, posed atop a convertible that had been covered in Skims imagery for her shoot </p>

<p>Work it: Model Yovanna Ventura posed up against a gilded vanity while wearing a nude bra and panties set. Multiple Skims polaroids were stuck up on the wall behind her in homage to the brand's first year in business </p>

<p>In a Barbie world: La La appears in multiple shots, including one that shows her lying on a sofa while surrounded by specially-made Skims dolls that are all wearing designs from the brand</p>

<p>To celebrate just how far Skims has come over the last 12 months, each model was set up in a special set for their shoot - masterminded by Italian photographer Vanessa Beecroft - with each person given a unique setting that pays tribute to the brand's first year in business. </p>

<p>For example, teenage social media sensation Addison, 19 - who has sky-rocketed to fame over the past few months thanks both to her impressive TikTok following and her close friendship with Kim's sister Kourtney, 41 - is seen modeling a black bra and boybriefs while standing atop a bed that has been covered in sheets printed with Skims imagery. </p>

<p>Photos from the brand's previous campaigns also cover the walls and the ceiling of the room in tribute to Skims' beginnings. In a nod to the teen's online stardom, a copy of Kim's iconic selfie book can be seen propped up on the bedside table.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile La La, 39, who is a longtime friend of Kim's, is seen posing in another bedroom-style set-up that has been decorated with gilt furniture, and dozens of Skims-branded Barbie dolls. The toys, which have been made in a variety of shapes, sizes, and skin tones, are all modeling tiny versions of Skims' most iconic shapewear designs, and have been scattered in the room around the TV star. </p>

<p>Rumer, 32, was also posed in a bedroom setting, however in addition to several Skims posters seen covering the walls, there is also a cardboard cut-out of Kim modeling her own designs propped up in the background while Rumer lounges on the mattress, with a brown phone positioned in front of her.  </p>

<p>In another tribute to Skims' focus on diversity and inclusion, each of the women is seen wearing different designs in a wide variety of shades, demonstrating the brand's extensive selection. </p>

<p>Name in lights: Several of the campaign images also appear on billboards in New York - where Addison's ad is located (left) - and Los Angeles - where one of Kim's shots can be seen on the side of a building (right)</p>

<p>Special: Kim encouraged her fans to share images of the billboards - like Jodie's ad in LA - as they spot them, calling for followers on social media to celebrate the campaign with their own photos </p>

<p>Rumer, for example, dons a bralette and high-waisted briefs in a nude shade; model siblings Delilah Belle, 22, and Amelia Gray, 19, are both posed up in similar ensembles, however one models a pair of briefs, while the other can be seen striking a confident pose in a pair of below-the-knee leggings. </p>

<p>Delilah and Amelia look near identical in their campaign image thanks to the matching black wigs they are both seen modeling in the shot - which shows them standing among a collection of mannequins, all of which are wearing the same blunt hairstyle, as well as Skims shapewear. </p>

<p>33-year-old actress Jodie - who gave birth to her first child with husband Joshua Jackson just four months ago - shows off her two-piece Skims set from every angle while lying on the floor against a mirrored backdrop that reflects her enviable figure multiple times over. </p>

<p>Also posed up with a mirror is model Yovanna Ventura, a 24-year-old who boasts a staggering 5.3 million followers on Instagram. Unlike Jodie however, the social media star is seen leaning against a gilded vanity, showcasing the back of her Skims outfit in a mirror placed behind her - before turning around for a rather cheeky shot to reveal her thong design. </p>

<p>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit star Precious, 29, who was the first black plus-size model to pose in the magazine, proves she has a need for speed in her unique shoot, in which she flaunts her curves while perched atop a convertible that has been covered in Skims imagery - with a focus on the derriere.  </p>

<p>As well as the thrill of posing in the milestone campaign, many of the women will get to see their shoots blown up on billboards in a variety of locations across New York and Los Angeles, with three posted in the Big Apple, while six have been put up in Kim's hometown. </p>

<p>Breaking barriers: Kim also gave several customers the chance to star in her campaign, calling on the likes of LA resident Madison Chertow to make their modeling debut after being inspired by all the fans who shared images of themselves in Skims</p>

<p>Making moves: Fitness trainer Brandi Yvonne is another Skims fans who got the chance to star in the anniversary campaign, which Kim says is a celebration of just how much her customers have inspired her throughout the year </p>

<p>Something for everyone: The reality star enlisted a diverse cast of celebrities and customers - like Myleeza, a long-time Kardashian fan whose shoot has been posted on a billboard over Sunset Boulevard </p>

<p>Tribute: Kim shouted out one of her longtime fans and customers, Myleeza, who not only appears in the campaign, but also features on her own billboard over Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles </p>

<p>Overjoyed: Myleeza couldn't contain her excitement at seeing the billboard for the first time, joking that she had struggled to keep the news under wraps for so long </p>

<p>Emotional: The pair also exchanged sweet messages on Twitter, with Myleeza thanking Kim for helping her to 'love herself' - explaining that even after losing 100lbs, she has struggled with body confidence </p>

<p>And while the campaign's A-list participants might be used to seeing their name and face in lights, for those customers featured on the billboards, it has been a dream come true - particularly for long-time Kardashian fan Myleeza, who couldn't contain her joy at seeing her ad in person for the first time. </p>

<p>'I've been sitting on this news for a whole week about to explode!' she wrote while sharing images of her billboard on social media. 'But guess who's on a billboard for Skims on Sunset Blvd in Los Angeles?! Yep! That's me!' </p>

<p>Myleeza's billboard and shoot was also incredibly meaningful for Kim, who took to Twitter to praise the newest Skims model for her unwavering dedication as a fan. </p>

<p>'This Skims campaign is so special to me because I get to celebrate the people that have had my back forever!' she wrote. 'I had to make sure my girl <?php echo e('@'); ?>MyleezaKardash was front and center! My biggest fan from day 1, I had to see her on a huge billboard.' </p>

<p>The duo also shared a sweet exchange on the social media platform, with Myleeza thanking Kim for featuring her in the shoot, explaining that it helped her to 'love herself' all the more, after she struggled with body confidence issues following a 100lb weight loss. </p>

<p>'Thank you so much Kim Kardashian and Skims,' she wrote. 'Even after losing close to 100lbs, I still felt self conscious about [my] body, but this moment made me love myself even more! I love you forever.' </p>

<p>As well as celebrating her close connection to her customers by featuring eight of them in her shoot, Kim also sent special anniversary gifts to 100 hand-picked fans, who received Skims shapewear designs, special anniversary merchandise - including a unique Skims-branded Barbie doll which featured in the campaign. </p>
