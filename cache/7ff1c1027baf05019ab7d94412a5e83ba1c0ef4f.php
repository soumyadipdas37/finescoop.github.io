<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>London City Airport has announced it is cutting up to 239 jobs as part of 'crucial restructuring plans'.</p>

<p>Chief executive Robert Sinclair said: 'It is with huge regret that we are announcing this restructuring programme today and our thoughts are with all of our highly valued staff and their families.Â </p>

<p>'The aviation sector is in the throes of the biggest downturn it has ever experienced as a result of the pandemic. We have held off looking at job losses for as long as possible, but sadly we are not immune from the devastating impact of this virus.</p>

<p>'Our focus in the coming weeks is to help all staff through this exceptionally difficult period. We are committed to playing our part in rebuilding a stronger local and national economy once the worst of the downturn passes and believe that the difficult decisions we are taking now will enable the airport to bounce back in a better shape when growth returns.'</p>
