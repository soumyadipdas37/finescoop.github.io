<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ferries between Dover and Calais have been suspended due to a strike by staff at the French port.</p>

<p>The 24-hour closure of the Port of Calais began at 8am on Thursday.</p>

<p>Ferry operators DFDS and P&amp;O Ferries normally run a total of up to 50 sailings per day between Dover and Calais.</p>

<p>A 24-hour closure of the Port of Calais is in place due to industrial action by dock workers sparking warnings of widespread disruption to travelers and the road network of Kent</p>

<p>DFDS has switched one of its Calais ships to the Dover-Dunkirk route to provide extra capacity.</p>

<p>Freight vehicles and passengers due to travel between Dover and Calais with DFDS on Thursday are being shipped on the next available Dover-Dunkirk sailing instead.</p>

<p>The Port of Dover said in a statement: 'We will continue to monitor the situation closely in liaison with our ferry partners and the Port of Calais.</p>

<p>'Please note that there may be delays to services when the Port of Calais reopens and services resume to normal.'</p>

<p>A representative from P&amp;O Ferries, who do not operate an alternative crossing to Dunkirk, said all their crossings to Calais had been suspended due to the industrial action.</p>

<p>They are advising customers that if they wish to postpone their trip, they can do so by amending their booking online.</p>

<p>The spokesman added that they are 'currently transferring our tourist passengers to other operators where possible'.</p>

<p>It is understood Kent Police Officers are preparing to install Operation Stack - where parts of the M20 are used to queue lorries travelling towards the continent, to avoid causing gridlock across Kent's road network.</p>

<p>It is only introduced as an emergency measure after consultation with other agencies and implemented following a thorough assessment of issues, including safety concerns and disruption on the road network. </p>

<p>Kent Highway Services said: 'The Dover Traffic Access Protocol (TAP) scheme on the A20 at Aycliffe has been implemented due to heavy freight volumes.</p>

<p>'This is to prevent Portbound traffic from disrupting the local road network and the A20 through Dover town.'</p>

<p>The Port of Dover is open and tourist traffic bound for Dover is advised to use the M2/A2 route. </p>
