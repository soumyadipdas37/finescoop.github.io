<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A construction worker died after eating too much licorice which caused his heart to stop, doctors say. </p>

<p>The Massachusetts man died aged 54 after eating a bag and a half of licorice every day for several weeks, throwing his nutrients out of balance. </p>

<p>'Even a small amount of licorice you eat can increase your blood pressure a little bit,' said Dr Neel Butala, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who described the case in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>

<p>Eating as little as two ounces of black licorice a day for two weeks could cause a heart rhythm problem, especially for people over 40, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns. </p>

<p>Black licorice is made with extract from root of the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant that gives the candy its sweetness.</p>

<p>The root contains a compound called glycyrrhizin.</p>

<p>Glycyrrhizic acid keeps the body from properly absorbing potassium, so when you consume too much glycyrrhizin, potassium levels may drop below normal levels.</p>

<p>The balance between potassium and sodium levels is key to healthy heart functioning.</p>

<p>When potassium levels are too low, sodium levels are correspondingly too high.</p>

<p>The imbalance can result in high blood pressure and upset the heart’s rhythm.</p>

<p>Abnormal heart rhythms greatly increase the risk of heart attack.</p>

<p>The problem is glycyrrhizic acid, found in black licorice and in many other foods and dietary supplements containing licorice root extract. </p>

<p>The chemical substance can cause dangerously low potassium and imbalances in other minerals called electrolytes.</p>

<p>'It´s more than licorice sticks. It could be jelly beans, licorice teas, a lot of things over the counter,' said cardiologist Dr Robert Eckel of the University of Colorado. </p>

<p>'Even some beers, like Belgian beers, have this compound in it,' as do some chewing tobaccos, said Dr Eckel, a former American Heart Association president. </p>

<p>The death was clearly an extreme case. The man had switched from red, fruit-flavored twists to the black licorice version of the candy a few weeks before his death last year. </p>

<p>He collapsed while having lunch at a fast-food restaurant. Emergency responders revived him with CPR but he died the next day. </p>

<p>Doctors found he had dangerously low potassium, which led to heart rhythm and other problems.  </p>

<p>The FDA permits up to 3.1 per cent of a food's content to have glycyrrhizic acid, but many candies and other licorice products don't reveal how much of it is contained per ounce, Butala said. </p>

<p>Doctors have reported the case to the FDA in hope of raising attention to the risk.</p>

<p>In a similar case reported last year, an elderly man spent two weeks in hospital after drinking liquorice tea caused his blood pressure to spike to dangerous levels (stock photo) </p>

<p>Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for the Hershey Company, which makes the popular Twizzlers licorice twists, said that 'all of our products are safe to eat and formulated in full compliance with FDA regulations.' </p>

<p>Beckman's statement added that all foods, including candy, 'should be enjoyed in moderation.'</p>

<p>In a similar case reported last year, an 84-year-old man spent two weeks in hospital after drinking home-made licorice tea twice a day for the previous fortnight.    </p>

<p>He went to the emergency department at McGill University in Montreal because of his concerns his blood pressure readings were so high.</p>

<p>The man also complained of headaches, light sensitivity, chest pain and fatigue - all of which can be symptoms of a hypertensive crisis. </p>

<p>But he did not realise that his favourite brew was to blame, according to medics who wrote up the case in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. </p>

<p>His initial symptoms resolved after just 24 hours in hospital. However, his shortness of breath stayed with him for several days. </p>
