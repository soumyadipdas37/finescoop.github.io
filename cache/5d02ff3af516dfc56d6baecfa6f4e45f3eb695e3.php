<p>As her son napped, Mrs Hinch, real name Sophie Hinchcllife, headed into the loft to get out her autumn wreath she handmade last year.</p>

<p>Delighted the batteries still worked, she excitedly told her followers on her Instagram story: 'I made this - felt like I was on art attack.'</p>

<p>Hanging the wreath on the back of her front door, Sophie shared: 'I've just put my wreath on guys, I love it. I can't believe it survived in the loft for a year. And I made it, so it wasn't exactly the sturdiest of things, but I love it. Absolutely love it.'</p>

<p>The golden hues, dark berries and mini pumpkins of this wreath available from Amazon certainly say autumn. The wreath, which costs an affordable £9.55, is growing in popularity and has earned the top spot in Amazon's Wreaths &amp; Garlands category.</p>

<p>We also love this autumnal wreath brimming with vibrant berries from Etsy. The seller Blossomloops also creates more simplistic door wreaths featuring a large cabbage rose and foliage in gorgeous muted hues.</p>

<p>For the craft lovers who want to pick their own seasonal foliage, you can pick up a make-your-own wreath at Hobbycraft.</p>

<p>She added pines cones from her recent trip to Dorset along the garland using a glue gun before entwining a string of fairy lights for an atmospheric finish.</p>

<p>And she isn't the only celebrity who has jumped on the trend of seasonal home decor. Stacey Solomon, Laura Whitmore and Zoe Sugg have all be known to showcase their eye-catching door displays come autumn.</p>
