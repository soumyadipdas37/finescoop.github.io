<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Starbucks customer has been caught erupting into a furious foul-mouthed rant after a server 'spilled coffee on him'.</p>

<p>The driver got out of his car at a drive-thru in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, before repeatedly calling a female staffer a 'sl*t'.</p>

<p>Footage of the verbal attack was posted to social media on Wednesday with viewers slamming the man's response to allegedly having coffee spilled on him.</p>

<p>The clip, which is a minute-and-a-half long, was taken by the driver's passenger and showed him ranting at a Starbucks worker while standing outside of his car.</p>

<p>The driver (pictured left) got out of his car at a drive-thru in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, before repeatedly calling a female staffer a 'sl*t'</p>

<p>The worker calmly leaned against the drive-thru's window frame as he listened to the customer's vicious tirade of foul-language and insults. </p>

<p>The customer shouts: 'I bought a coffee. She was holding it from the top. She splashed the lid. You daft motherf***er.'</p>

<p>The worker quickly interrupted him with 'there's no need to swear' but it did little to stem the angry customer's rant.</p>

<p>The man added: 'She splashed the lid and it's burnt my hand. Do you understand.;</p>

<p>The worker calmly leaned against the drive-thru's window frame as he listened to the customer's vicious tirade of foul-language and insults</p>

<p>The worker continued to explain that he would 'sort it', but the customer was not appeased.</p>

<p>'You understand you daft motherf*<strong>er. It burned my hand,' he said. 'That's not no hire car that's cash paid. Tell that s</strong>t it's cash paid.'</p>

<p>The worker said: 'Alright but no swearing. We'll sort this out.'</p>

<p>The customer shouted louder, saying: 'You've burned my f<strong><em>ing hand. You understand. You're telling me it's my f</em></strong>ing fault. You're serving me. You've handed the coffee out. You've burned my f<strong><em>ing hand. Are you f</em></strong>ing listening.'</p>

<p>The employee said: 'I haven't burned your hand. I'm just trying to sort it out but then you're calling me a fat f**k.'</p>

<p>The female staff member - thought to be the object of his fury - then appeared at the window and shouted something inaudible at the man</p>

<p>Pointing to his car the man said: 'Too right we're going to sort this out. Look at what she's done. You're going to pay for that as well. It's not a hire car it's cash paid.'  </p>

<p>The female staff member - thought to be the object of his fury - then appeared at the window and shouted something inaudible at the man. </p>

<p>The driver continued to call her a 'sl**' before getting into his car and slamming the door. </p>

<p>The woman tried to argue back and he said: 'Come here you little sl**.' </p>

<p>The manager then told the man to drive 'around the front' of the shop where they could solve the issue out of the way of other customers. </p>

<p>The clip, which is a minute-and-a-half long, was taken by the driver's passenger and showed him ranting at a Starbucks worker</p>

<p>He said: 'This is a f***ing hundred grand motor. Are you going to pay me. I'm going around front.' </p>

<p>The explosive scene was shared on Facebook yesterday by user Sian Banham who called the man's actions 'vile.' </p>

<p>Her thoughts were echoed by hundreds of other people. Julie Kearney wrote: 'Pure d***, accidents happen.' </p>

<p>'Should have jumped the counter and nutted him.' Donna Morgan added: 'The first time he swore and called her slag those windows would have been closed. </p>

<p>'He was so aggressive I actually would have called the police.</p>
