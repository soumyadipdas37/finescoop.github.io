<p>The 22-year old saw a move to Liverpool fall through earlier this summer and had interest from Crystal Palace and Leicester but is now expected to sign for Steve Bruce at Newcastle in a deal that will rise with add-ons.</p>

<p>Newcastle have put a deal in place for Brazilian Rogerio at Sassuolo but Bruce has been looking to add a stronger British contingent to his squad.</p>

<p>Newcastle United have had a £13.5million bid accepted for Norwich City left back Jamal Lewis</p>

<p>Sassuolo defender Rogerio was on the verge of joining but the club have opted to change tack</p>

<p>A fee of £12.5m was touted for the highly-rated left back, but Bruce has now changed tack in a bid to freshen up his squad before the new Premier League campaign. </p>

<p>It is now firmly in Lewis' hands whether he becomes Newcastle's first signing for a fee in the current window.</p>

<p>The emphasis on British recruitment has also seen the club express interest in free agent Ryan Fraser and Bournemouth frontman Callum Wilson.</p>

<p>Fraser, who played alongside Wilson on the south coast before leaving as a free agent earlier this year, reportedly jetted up to Newcastle as the deal edges closer to completion. </p>

<p>Newcastle fear Aston Villa will beat them to the signing of Bournemouth ace Callum Wilson</p>

<p>Newcastle boss Steve Bruce is looking to strengthen his defence during the summer window</p>

<p>Newcastle are also interested in a season-long-loan deal for Arsenal's Rob Holding (left)</p>

<p>The club are fearful that Aston Villa will beat them to the signing of Wilson, however. Sportsmail understands Bournemouth turned down an offer of £15m from the Midlands outfit, a bid that featured the full fee up front and did not include an add-ons.   </p>

<p>Bruce has already signed Republic of Ireland international Jeff Hendrick on a free transfer from Burnley last month, and goalkeeper Mark Gillespie on a free from Motherwell. </p>

<p>He is also looking to strengthen his back-line with a move for Arsenal centre half Rob Holding. </p>

<p>Newcastle are currently exploring the possibility of taking Holding on loan from the Emirates.</p>
