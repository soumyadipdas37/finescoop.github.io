<p>One of the NSW government's proposed rules will be for beachgoers to maintain a 'towel length' of distance among themselves.</p>

<p>Under the plan, markings will also be placed throughout parks and public spaces to remind people of social distancing policies.</p>

<p>Lifeguards would set up several sets of flags across long stretches of beach - subject to weather conditions - to encourage beachgoers to distance.</p>

<p>'We know how much our community loves fresh air, beaches and parklands, but we will all need to do that a bit differently this summer,' Premier Gladys Berejiklian said</p>

<p>Venues will also be encouraged to embrace alfresco dining to promote social distancing and avoid placing too many people in confined spaces.</p>

<p>The proposals are part of a five-point plan to ensure the safety of Sydneysiders this summer.    </p>

<p>'We know how much our community loves fresh air, beaches and parklands, but we will all need to do that a bit differently this summer,' Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.</p>

<p>In addition to the five-point plan, Ms Berejiklian is hoping to launch arts and cultural events outdoors to aid in contact tracing.</p>

<p>'Whatever you're into there'll be something for you to do this summer,' Planning Minister Rob Stokes said.</p>

<p>Mr Stokes said he hoped people would stray from the standard Aussie tradition of crowding at the beach this summer and begin exploring lesser known parts of Sydney.</p>

<p>Under the plan, markings will also be placed throughout parks and public spaces to remind people of social distancing policies</p>

<p>Venues will also be encouraged to embrace alfresco dining, again to promote social distancing and avoid placing too many people in confined spaces</p>

<p>Bondi Beach appeared crowded again on September 3 as the weather warmed up</p>

<p>'We have huge amounts of open space, but often we don't even know exactly where it is in a local community,' Mr Stokes said.</p>

<p>'So we're going to shine a spotlight on all the forgotten bits of parkland right across this beautiful city.' </p>

<p>QR sign in codes would still be required when dining out, and could even be extended to taxi trips in the coming weeks, Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant revealed on Sunday.</p>

<p>Sitting in the front seat of a ride-share service is already discouraged to avoid any close contact.  </p>

<p>It comes as the state recorded just one new locally acquired COVID-19 case.</p>

<p>The case is a household contact of a previously known case linked to Concord Hospital, and was already in quarantine prior to testing positive.   </p>

<p>Back in April, crowds were criticised for gathering and doing the coastal walk in Manly despite social distancing rules</p>

<p>Life guards would set up several sets of flags across long stretches of beach - subject to weather conditions - to encourage beachgoers to distance themselves</p>
