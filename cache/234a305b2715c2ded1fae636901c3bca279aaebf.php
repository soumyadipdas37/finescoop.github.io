<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bird expert has revealed that magpies are 'highly intelligent' creatures that aren't aggressive and only swoop people who have 'done something' to them.</p>

<p>Melbourne-based wildlife ecologist Gráinne Cleary appeared on the Today Show to defend Australia's most despised bird as swooping season begins on the east coast.</p>

<p>Dr Cleary said the native birds - known for dive bombing anyone that comes near their chicks during nesting season - were simply misunderstood.  </p>

<p>Dr Cleary (pictured) explained that magpies are highly intelligent and have morals which means they understand the difference between 'right or wrong'</p>

<p>Ms Cleary has published books about birds and works with the public on conservation strategies for wildlife living in the suburbs.  </p>

<p>Today host Karl Stefanovic asked why she adored magpies when they are 'without a shadow of a doubt the most hated bird in the universe?' </p>

<p>The bird-lover defended the creatures and pleaded with the host to give them a break.</p>

<p>'If they are going to swoop you it is usually because you have done something. And usually you have to look into yourself and say what have I done to upset the magpie,' she said.   </p>

<p>The ecologist said magpies were naturally very suspicious birds and suggested making friends with them to stop them from swooping.</p>

<p>'What you have to do is go "How are you? It is just myself going for my walk. I mean you no harm",' she explained.</p>

<p>'The magpie will respect you back. Talk to them. They will talk back. Talk to them. They will talk back to you. I am not crazy.'</p>

<p>Ms Cleary said if magpies swoop you it is usually because you have done something wrong and 'you have to look into yourself and say what have I done to upset the magpie.' Pictured: cyclist being swooped by a magpie</p>

<p>Stefanovic asked how you could have a relationship with a bird that 'comes out of the blue' and dive bombs you. </p>

<p>Ms Cleary said magpies were similar to humans and live in a very structured society with 'right and wrong things to do'.</p>

<p>'When we see a magpie sweeping we know that is the dominant male.</p>

<p>'All he's doing during the five, six weeks is just protecting his nest and protecting his missus who is sitting on the eggs.' </p>

<p>The black and white birds are known to be so smart they can recognise the same people walking past.</p>

<p>Stefanovic asked if they could still do that while people wear masks due to the coronavirus restrictions. </p>

<p>Dr Cleary said the birds probably figure out people have a face covering on because they also take cues from the way people walk, their hair colour or the dog people have with them.</p>

<p>Ms Cleary explained that the dominant male magpie swoops to protect his female partner who sits on the eggs for five to six weeks</p>
