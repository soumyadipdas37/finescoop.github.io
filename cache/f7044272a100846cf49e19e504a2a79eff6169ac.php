<p>New look: Adam Woodyatt, 52, displayed the results of his recent weight loss as he showed off his slimm-down frame while stepping out of his BMW this week</p>

<p>Adam, who plays Ian Beale on the soap, also sported a pair of trainers and looked in good spirits as he relaxed next to his swanky car.</p>

<p>Adam's BMW is thought to be an 8 Series Coupe and would have set him back more than £70,000.  </p>

<p>The soap star has been keeping a relatively low profile since the news of his split emerged last week. </p>

<p>It comes after Adam admitted to being fat-shamed by EastEnders fans who saw him in person. </p>

<p>Transformation: Adam looked noticeably different following his recent weight loss (pictured right in April 2014)</p>

<p>Recalling one particularly hurtful experience, he told The Sun: 'One of the best examples of somebody being rude is when we were at the BBC Good Food show.</p>

<p>'This woman looks at me and says, "You’re fatter than you are on telly".</p>

<p>The outing comes after Adam recently split from his wife Beverley Sharp after 22 years of marriage. </p>

<p>The couple separated in August of last year but it is thought that they have only now started telling friends about their decision.</p>

<p>Laid back: The TV star cut a casual figure for the outing, sporting a teal polo shirt along with a pair of blue jeans as he went for a stroll in Hertfordshire</p>

<p>A friend told The Sun that Beverley was 'very upset' at the split but added that it's a 'straightforward separation'.</p>

<p>They said: 'Nobody plans for these things and divorce is a difficult thing to get your head around but they have dealt with it quietly for several months and are now telling friends so it's less of a secret.</p>

<p>'They still get on well, and are keen to make sure they stay that way for the sake of their children – even though they are now grown up.' </p>

<p>Adam and Beverley have been married since 1998 and have two children - Jessica, 27, and Samuel, 23.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the actor said: 'Beverley and Adam separated in August last year and we ask that the family's privacy is respected.' </p>

<p>Wow: EastEnders fans were left in shock last month, after the star, who plays Ian Beale on the hit soap showed off his weight loss in a spoiler clip for an EastEnders spin-off show </p>

<p>MailOnline has also contacted Adam's representative for a comment.</p>

<p>It comes after reports that Adam was being 'written out' of EastEnders after playing Ian Beale for 35 years as he is taking an 'extended break' from the soap.</p>

<p>Adam was said to be having a prolonged 'holiday' with his part being 'written out' of upcoming episodes, just as the show returns to air.</p>

<p>The long-time character will be off screen for around 10 weeks due to an 'explosive plot twist', a BBC source has claimed, according to the Daily Star.</p>

<p>Another source added: 'Writers are staying tight-lipped about what happens, so it's not known yet what the future will hold for the character.'</p>
