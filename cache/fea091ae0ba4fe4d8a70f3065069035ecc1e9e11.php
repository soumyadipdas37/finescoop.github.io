<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Novak Djokovic, who has been disqualified from the US Open for hitting a ball at a line judge which struck her in the throat, has previously shown little concern over his petulant behaviour after incidents in which he could have caused injury to officials and spectators.</p>

<p>Four years ago Djokovic hit the ball into the crowd at the ATP Finals - months after he came close to hitting an official with his racket. </p>

<p>He then responded angrily to a reporter who called him out for his conduct - and after his latest indiscretion resulted in the line judge being hurt, the video of his reaction in 2016 has come back to haunt the World No 1. </p>

<p>A clip from 2016 has emerged showing Novak Djokovic brushing off concerns over his conduct</p>

<p>OOOH THIS IS SWEET pic.twitter.com/6NbpD4bful</p>

<p>He was disqualified from the US Open on Sunday after inadvertently hitting a line judge </p>

<p>The four-year-old clip starts with the journalist mentioning an incident at the French Open in the same year, where Djokovic flung his racket backwards and nearly hit a line judge. </p>

<p>He was then quizzed whether he was concerned about his dangerous behaviour after his three-set win over Dominic Thiem in London, with a reporter asking: 'Does it concern you one day that will cost you dearly? If it hit someone today, is that something you've got to address.'</p>

<p>Djokovic laughed and said: 'You guys are unbelievable. You're always picking these kind of things.'</p>

<p>When told that he 'keeps doing these things', he hit back: 'I keep doing these things? Why don't I get suspended then?'</p>

<p>Djokovic previously said his behaviour was 'not an issue' after showing frustrations on court </p>

<p>REPORTER: Back to the end of the first set, we saw you similarly venting your frustration at Roland Garros, throwing your racket. Does it concern you one day that will cost you dearly? If it hit someone today?</p>

<p>DJOKOVIC: You guys are unbelievable.</p>

<p>REPORTER: Why is it unbelievable?</p>

<p>DJOKOVIC: Because you’re always picking these kind of things.</p>

<p>REPORTER: If you keep doing these things </p>

<p>DJOKOVIC: I keep doing these things? Why don’t you get suspended then?</p>

<p>REPORTER: You were close, weren’t you?</p>

<p>DJOKOVIC: I’m close? I’m still not suspended, so if I’m not close, I’m not close.</p>

<p>REPORTER: If that ball had hit a spectator, it could have been serious.</p>

<p>NOVAK DJOKOVIC: It could have been, yes. It could have snowed in O2 Arena, as well, but it didn’t.</p>

<p>REPORTER: You’re not concerned about your mindset?</p>

<p>DJOKOVIC: I’m the only player that shows his frustration on the court? That’s what you are saying?</p>

<p>REPORTER: You’re one of the top-ranked players in the world.</p>

<p>DJOKOVIC: So?</p>

<p>REPORTER: You are showing this frustration. I’m asking you, do you think it’s an issue for you?</p>

<p>DJOKOVIC: It is not an issue for me. It’s not the first time I did it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The journalist then reminded him a spectator could have been seriously hurt if the ball had struck someone, to which he replied: 'It could have been, yes. It could have snowed in O2 arena, as well, but it didn't.'</p>

<p>He then claimed he has no fears over his frustrations and insisted he is not the only player who behaves in the same way. </p>

<p>'I'm the only player that shows his frustration on the court? That's what you are saying? It is not an issue for me. It's not the first time I did it.' </p>

<p>On Sunday, Djokovic's temper got the better of him again, and this time his angry reaction resulted in him causing an injury to a line judge. </p>

<p>Frustrated after having his serve broken by Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta, Djokovic hit the ball backwards without looking, inadvertently striking the throat of the female official, who keeled over on court and clutched at her throat in pain. </p>

<p>After a 10-minute deliberation between Referee Soeren Friemel and umpire Aurelie Tourte, Djokovic was defaulted from the tournament. </p>

<p>Afterwards Djokovic was apologetic but defended himself as he pleaded for leniency. </p>

<p>The line judge keeled over after being struck in the throat after Djokovic hit a ball towards her </p>

<p>He pleaded his innocence with officials after the incident but they were left with little choice </p>

<p>'She doesn't have to go to the hospital for this,' he said. 'You're going to choose a default in this situation? My career, Grand Slam, centre stage?'</p>

<p>Later he issued a full apology to the female official, who is yet to be named, saying he was 'extremely sorry to have caused her such stress' and vowed to work on his 'growth as a human being'.</p>

<p>'This whole situation has left me really sad and empty,' he said in his post. 'I checked on the lines person and the tournament told me that thank God she is feeling OK. I'm extremely sorry to have caused her such stress. </p>

<p>He has vowed to work on his 'growth as a player and human being' after his disqualification </p>

<p>'So unintended. So wrong. I'm not disclosing her name to respect her privacy. As for the disqualification, I need to go back within and work on my disappointment and turn this all into a lesson for my growth and evolution as a player and human being. </p>

<p>'I apologise to the tournament and everyone associated for my behavior. I'm very grateful to my team and family for being my rock support, and my fans for always being there with me. Thank you and I'm so sorry.'</p>

<p>The incident has drawn criticism from a number of tennis stars. Former British No 1 Greg Rusedski told Amazon Prime: 'It's a very difficult situation but he should have come into press, taken responsibility and apologised for the situation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, fiery star Nick Kyrgios, who has a history of bad temper on court, ran a poll on his Twitter account as he asked his followers: 'Swap me for jokers (Djokovic) incident. "Accidentally hitting the ball kid in the throat" how many years would I be banned for?'</p>
