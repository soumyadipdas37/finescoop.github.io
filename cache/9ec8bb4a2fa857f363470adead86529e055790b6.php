<p>Tottenham are interested in signing £25m-rated Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguilon</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho is set to rival former club Manchester United who are also in for the Spaniard</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands discussions regarding the full-back's possible departure will intensify this week - but sources close to Reguilon say the two Premier League clubs are leading the chase.</p>
