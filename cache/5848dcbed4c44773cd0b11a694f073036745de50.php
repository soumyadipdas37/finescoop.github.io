<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Scientists have grown a liver in the lymph nodes of a pig and hope it could allow humans to grow their own replacement organs in future. </p>

<p>Livers have the ability to naturally regenerate, and a sliver of the filtration organ – if transplanted – can grow to full-size and become fully-functioning. </p>

<p>It is believed the lymph nodes provide a sanctuary for healthy liver cells, allowing them to slowly multiply and blossom into an 'auxiliary organ'.  </p>

<p>Trials in pigs shows that when the main organ was beleaguered with disease and began failing, the animal remained healthy because the auxiliary organ took over. </p>

<p>Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh gave six pigs liver failure by diverting blood supply and removing a chunk of tissue. They also took hepatocytes — the chief functional cells of the liver — and implanted them in the lymph nodes of the animals.

<p>Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh gave six pigs liver failure by diverting blood supply and removing a chunk of tissue.</p>

<p>They also took hepatocytes — the chief functional cells of the liver — from the animals and implanted them in their lymph nodes.</p>

<p>'It's all about location, location, location,' said senior author Dr Eric Lagasse.</p>

<p>'If hepatocytes get in the right spot and there is a need for liver functions, they will form an ectopic liver in the lymph node.' </p>

<p>Normally, the liver can regenerate and repair itself but significant damage can overwhelm this protective mechanism. </p>

<p>Previously, a smaller version of the experiment was also successful in mice, but it has taken a decade to sale it up to a larger animal to see if it offers hope for humans. More recent research proved healthy liver tissue can grow in the lymph nodes of pigs with a genetic liver defect (stock)</p>

<p>Many kinds of cancer cells often spread first to lymph nodes before traveling to distant organs through the bloodstream. </p>

<p>A study, published in Nature, found melanoma cells that pass through the lymph nodes pick up a protective coating, allowing them to survive high levels of oxidative stress in the blood and go on to form distant tumors.</p>

<p>Most cancer deaths happen after cancer spreads to other parts of the body through a process known as metastasis.</p>

<p>This occurs when cancer cells from the primary tumor spread through blood vessels or migrate through lymphatic vessels before entering the blood. </p>

<p>Assessments of the pigs revealed they remained healthy despite their main liver becoming increasingly poor. </p>

<p>Despite this, the pigs themselves showed improved liver function as the secondary organ took over the bulk of responsibilities. </p>

<p>Analysis of the lymph nodes revealed the implanted hepatocytes had grown and also formed a network of bile ducts and vasculature.  </p>

<p>The auxiliary livers grew bigger when the damaged tissue in the animals' native liver was more severe, but never grew out of control.</p>

<p>The researchers believe the animals' bodies maintain a constant liver mass, keeping in check cell growth to avoid runaway growth. </p>

<p>Previously, a smaller version of the experiment was also successful in mice, but it has taken a decade to scale it up to a larger animal to see if it offers hope for humans. </p>

<p>More recent research proved healthy liver tissue can grow in the lymph nodes of pigs with a genetic liver defect. </p>

<p>With the latest findings being so promising, the academics hope it could offer potential avenues for human medicine to treat liver damage from any cause, from hepatitis to alcoholism. </p>

<p>The findings are available in the journal Liver Transplantation.  </p>
