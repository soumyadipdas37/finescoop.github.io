<p>As reported by La Gazzetta Dello Sport, Balotelli is poised to join Genoa on a one-year deal with the option of an additional year.</p>

<p>Balotelli's latest move is set to bring his frustrating spell at Brescia to an end.</p>

<p>Mario Balotelli is set to bring his frustrating spell at Brescia to an end by signing for Genoa</p>

<p>Last year Balotelli joined Brescia on a three-year deal but the move certainly didn't go to plan, with Brescia being relegated to Serie B and the striker scoring just five goals in 19 Serie A appearances.</p>

<p>Balotelli didn't play for Brescia after March 9 last season, with the club hugely frustrated when he turned up for training eight kilos overweight.</p>

<p>Balotelli turned up for training overweight and was then rejected from the training ground</p>

<p>Subsequently Balotelli was refused entry into Brescia's training ground once lockdown restrictions in Italy were eased.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old has had a hugely eventful career that has encompassed him playing for a wide range of clubs, including Inter Milan, Manchester City, AC Milan, Liverpool, Nice and Marseille.  </p>

<p>Although he was previously linked with a move to Romanian side Cluj, it appears that Balotelli will be remaining in Italy, and he will hope that his latest spell in Serie A will be considerably more successful than the previous one.  </p>
