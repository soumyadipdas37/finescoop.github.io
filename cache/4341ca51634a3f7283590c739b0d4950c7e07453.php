<p>Cameron Daddo (pictured in 2020) and Alison Brahe have revealed the REAL reason they returned to Australia in 2017 after 25 years chasing the Hollywood dream in Los Angeles</p>

<p>Cameron and Alison, who marred in 1991, share three children: daughters Lotus, 24, and Bodhi Faith, 14, and son River, 20. </p>

<p>The couple had moved to Los Angeles in 1992, where Cameron landed small roles in shows such as Models Inc., The Mentalist and NCIS.</p>

<p>However, while a stable Hollywood career was always Cameron's end goal, he realised his desire to be around family was more strong.</p>

<p>'Over the years, we'd had our moments [of wanting to come home],' Cameron said, adding that they missed out on the joy of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, but experienced the devastation surrounding the 9/11 terrorist attack on The World Trade Centre in 2001. </p>

<p>'What we didn't have were our parents and my siblings and their families. We wanted our kids to know them – and particularly our parents in their later years. So it just felt like the right time to come home,' Cameron said of the family's reason for relocating.</p>

<p>Cameron is the eldest of five siblings, with brothers Andrew and Lochie Daddo both prominent Australian actors and presenters.</p>

<p>New lease: Cameron said that embracing change has made him a kinder person and filled him with gratitude</p>

<p>'Three years ago on this day, we'd recovered from saying goodbye to our family and friends in the USA,' Cameron wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>'We'd had an eventful stop-gap in Fiji that included hospital drips, tsunami warnings and food poisoning. We'd picked up Dobby [their dog] from quarantine, loaded the car and trailer and set off on our new life in Oz.' </p>

<p>He added that embracing change has made him a kinder person and filled him with gratitude.    </p>
