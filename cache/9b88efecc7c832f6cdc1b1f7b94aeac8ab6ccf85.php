<p>The media personality was quizzed by fans about her plans to have a baby during an Instagram Q&amp;A, where she told her followers she has always seen herself as a young mum.</p>

<p>When asked when they will try for a baby, Molly-Mae, who has been dating Tommy for one year, said: 'Probably not ages, like, I've always wanted to have a baby slightly younger anyway, so not going to be super, super old or not going to be super, super young.' </p>

<p>The blonde also answered the question: 'If you could meet Tommy again without the fame, would you?' </p>

<p>She replied: 'Well this is the nice thing about how we met, we met on Love Island and I didn't know who he was, he didn't know who I was. It was a really natural and nice way of meeting.' </p>

<p>On how she deals with trolls, the TV star, who claimed she was left fearing for her life during a terrifying boat trip, responded: 'I've learnt to not let anything get to me because in this industry you just can't. It'll break you down.</p>

<p>'So as long as my family's happy and I'm happy and Tommy's happy, then that's all that really matters to me.</p>

<p>'You just become used to it which is disgusting really, but I'm literally a size 8 so if I'm fat and lardy... then you cannot pay any notice to it and I'm quite good at it now.'</p>
