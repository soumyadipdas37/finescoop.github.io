<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When Sunrise presenter Melissa Doyle became the latest casualty of axe-swinging at Channel Seven, both the star and network executives issued statements praising one another. </p>

<p>But things weren't so rosy for other well-known faces caught up in the network's recent cuts.</p>

<p>Doyle's one-time buddy on the Sunrise couch, presenter Simon Reeve, is suing Seven in the Federal Court after he was boned in June.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Reeve, 59 - the sports presenter on Weekend Sunrise and host of Million Dollar Minute and It's Academic - filed a statement of claim late last week. </p>

<p>Simon Reeve worked for Channel Seven for 20 years when he was axed earlier this year - and is now suing in the Federal Court. Above, in the Sunrise studio with Angela Cox and Sally Bowrey</p>

<p>Reeve (above with Larry Emdur and Monique Wright) has been the sports presenter on Weekend Sunrise for about a decade but hasn't appeared on screen since March</p>

<p>Reeve mostly recently hosted It's Academic, Million Dollar Minute and the sport on Weekend Sunrise</p>

<p>Reeve, known as one of the network's 'nice guys', had been with Seven for two decades in one role or another when he was shown the door - as the economic downturn ravages Australian TV businesses.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands the presenter's lawsuit is about entitlements he believes should have been paid out when he was let go. </p>

<p>At the heart of the legal dispute is whether he was an employee of Seven - as Reeve argues he was - or an independent contractor at the time.</p>

<p>Seven will be defending the case and is expected to argue Reeve had 'changed his tune' on being a contractor after being axed. </p>

<p>No dollar figure has been placed on the lawsuit.  </p>

<p>It sets the stage for what could be the highest-profile court stoush Seven has faced since the network and former CEO Tim Worner's executive assistant Amber Harrison sued one another in 2017.</p>

<p>Both Seven and Reeve's lawyers declined to comment, with a court date yet to be set. </p>

<p>It has been a year of bloodshed in the TV industry with big names shown the door at both Seven and Network 10.</p>

<p>By far the biggest departure so far is Doyle's. She issued a statement upon her departure where she singled out Seven chairman Kerry Stokes for his support.</p>

<p>Reeve regularly worked on Sunrise and was a regular presence when Mel and Kochie were on the couch. Above, the trio together in 2013 - with Kochie the only survivor</p>

<p>Reeve has been on and off Channel Seven for the past 40 years. Above, he poses with longtime colleagues Doyle and Kylie Gillies at a Seven Christmas party in 2007</p>

<p>Reeve, far right, was a long term contributor to Weekend Sunrise but is understood to be living on the Gold Coast</p>

<p>'For 25 years, I have called Channel 7 home,' she said. 'I've had the privilege to share stories that mattered, meet incredible people and be there for significant moments in history. </p>

<p>Melissa Doyle and Seven executives exchanged gushing statements when she left the building</p>

<p>'I am incredibly proud of the work I have done and appreciative of the trust and warmth our viewers have shown me. </p>

<p>'I want to thank the consummate professionals I have worked with along the way, in particular our chairman Kerry Stokes for his constant support. </p>

<p>'I leave Seven with a great deal of pride, satisfaction and gratitude.' </p>

<p>Seven CEO James Warburton thanked the former Sunrise host for 'everything she's done for the Seven Network.'</p>

<p>'Melissa has deserved every success that's come her way'.</p>

<p>There was no such song and dance for Reeve - who started his career at Seven in Western Australia in 1979. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ten has axed state-based bulletins in Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth, and legendary weatherman Tim Bailey - who worked there for 29 years.  </p>
