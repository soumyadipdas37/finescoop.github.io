<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A furious cyclist who claimed he was almost run off the road has been charged by police.  </p>

<p>The rider was cycling along a narrow road in Macmasters Beach, on the NSW Central Coast, on August 9 when he was overtaken by a Toyota driver. </p>

<p>Footage captured on the bicycle's rear-facing camera showed the Toyota swerving out from behind the cyclist and narrowly passing on his right.   </p>

<p>'Took this to NSW Police and I ended up getting booked for not riding as near to left of the road as possible,' the cyclist explained.   </p>

<p>A cyclist claimed he was almost run off the road by a Toyota driver on the NSW Central Coast (pictured). He showed the footage to police but was charged for not riding closer to the left</p>

<p>The rider said he was unable to drive any further to the left as it was unsafe. </p>

<p>'Descending down an unguttered road with blind driveways at 50km/h, and I was as close to the left of the road that was safe in the circumstances,' he said. </p>

<p>Who was in the wrong?</p>

<p>Who was in the wrong?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>'It seems NSW Police intend on keeping roads as perilous as possible for cyclists.' </p>

<p>The video showed both the bike and car driving down a hill on the suburban road surrounded by homes and trees. </p>

<p>Two red lines were also overlaid on the video image and appeared to show the Toyota driving within a metre distance of the cyclist when overtaking.   </p>

<p>The Toyota driver did not cross over the road's double unbroken lines and remained within the left lane to pass the cyclist.  </p>

<p>Viewers were quick to defend the rider and called for the cyclist to dispute his fine.   </p>

<p>'A clear case of police going on the attack of a cyclist. Wet conditions, fast downhill probably on the speed limit.  </p>

<p>'Riding in the gutter is not practicable at all,' one user said. </p>

<p>The cyclist claimed is was unsafe for him to ride further to he left as there were hidden driveways and no gutters on the suburban street in Macmasters Beach (pictured) </p>

<p>'The vehicle is the danger, not you as a cyclist.  </p>

<p>'I'd be disputing that in court,' another commenter wrote.    </p>

<p>Other commenters told the cyclist he needed to 'move left'. </p>

<p>'What the cops said is what my very thoughts were. Move over a little bit, you're like out in the middle of the road,' one user said.     </p>

<p>Transport for NSW have stated 'drivers must give bicycle riders at least a metre of space'. </p>

<p>'Drivers passing a bicycle rider must allow a distance of at least one metre when the speed limit is 60km/h or less,' the road rules website read. </p>

<p>'Both single lane and multi-lane overtaking involves risk and requires extreme care. If you have any doubts, don't overtake and wait until it is safer.' </p>

<p>NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia the fine was worth $116.   </p>

<p>Viewers condemned the impatient driver and urged the cyclist to dispute his charge</p>
