<p>This isn't the first time that a devastated Lisa has opened up about her loss on social media.  </p>

<p>'Jaimi, as dad and I lovingly held you when you took your first breath, we lovingly held you as you took your last. Goodnight sweet girl... we hope you have a nice long sleep.'  </p>

<p>Morgan said that Jaimi saw the beauty in everyone and everything, and described her as the 'most sentimental person' she has ever known.</p>

<p>'I will always remember her taking the time to stop and take a photo of a pretty flower, an interesting door, or her feet standing next to crunchy leaves that had fallen from the trees,' she wrote in a heartbreaking Instagram post, alongside a recent photo of the pair together.  </p>

<p>'I promise to always appreciate these things as she did,' Morgan continued. </p>

<p>Support: Morgan (left) and her mother, Lisa Curry (right), were seen embracing each other at the conclusion of the heartbreaking funeral service</p>

<p>Jaimi died at Sunshine Coast University Hospital on September 14 surrounded by her family, after a long battle with an eating disorder and alcoholism. </p>

<p>She was buried at a 100-person funeral on the Sunshine Coast last Saturday, which was attended by her parents, sporting greats Lisa Curry and Grant Kenny, and her younger brother, model Jett Kenny.</p>

<p>Lisa's husband, Mark Andrew Tabone, was also seen comforting his distraught wife as Jaimi's white coffin, covered in pink and orange dahlias and baby's breath, was carried out of the chapel and placed in the back of a hearse. </p>

<p>Morgan, who is pregnant, attended the church ceremony with her husband, Ryan Gruell, and their two-year-old son, Flynn.</p>

<p>Prior to her death, Jaimi had expressed her desire to one day have a family of her own, and absolutely doted on the children in her family.</p>

<p>After her parents' marriage deteriorated, Ironman Grant went on to have a daughter named Trixie Belle with radio presenter Fifi Box.</p>

<p>Trixie was the centre of Jaimi's universe, and the nanny even moved down to Melbourne to live closer to the child and her mother.</p>

<p>'Jaimi absolutely adored children and was especially close to Trixie,' a family friend told Sunshine Coast Daily, adding that her younger half-sister and nephew gave her 'a whole new lease on life'.</p>

<p>But her struggles with mental health brought her back to the Sunshine Coast and her parents shortly after making the move south.</p>

<p>She worked closely with the End ED clinic, which specialises in eating disorder treatment and recovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jaimi met and fell in love with local business owner Lachy Crossley on the Sunshine Coast.</p>

<p>His mother Gail said 'they had plans to be together forever... They were certainly in love'.</p>

<p>'You could just see the love in their eyes that they had for each other. People described them as a modern-day Romeo and Juliet,' she added.</p>

<p>But in 2017, Lachy died in circumstances 'too heartbreaking' for the family to discuss.</p>

<p>At the time, the couple had recently moved in together and were discussing their future. They both loved each other and loved children even more.</p>

<p>Private battle: Jaimi had long battled an eating disorder, with her family supporting her through years of treatment at a private clinic. Jaimi (left) is pictured with her family at her sister Morgan's 2016 wedding</p>

<p>The tragedy plunged Jaimi further into a depression and she spent the subsequent years in and out of hospital and the eating disorder clinic.</p>

<p>Her medical team tried everything, including blood transfusions, to extend her life.</p>

<p>The Curry-Kenny clan have repeatedly thanked her medical team for their hard work in maintaining Jaimi's quality of life. </p>

<p>'You were there whenever I needed you': Jaimi's younger brother, Jett (left), penned his own sombre tribute on Sunday following the funeral, reflecting on the good times the close family had with his 'biggest sister'</p>

<p>Jaimi's younger brother, Jett, penned his own sombre tribute on Sunday, reflecting on the good times the close family had with his 'biggest sister'.</p>

<p>'You were there whenever I needed you, you taught me how to cook gourmet food like roast potatoes, chicken and salad, and tacos - the essentials in our household,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'You gave me a slight insight into fashion by dressing me in up in dresses and putting makeup on me when I was young. You'd sit behind me while I ate dinner and would pick at anything pimple looking on my back - even if it was just a mole.</p>

<p>'You were my second mother, you were my biggest sister, you were my friend, and you were a fighter until the very end.' </p>
