<p>A female administrative assistant at a New York investment bank has filed a lawsuit claiming she was fired after she complained about walking in on her boss masturbating in a conference room.</p>

<p>Logan Williams claims she caught Chuck Hinckley, one of the managing directors at Marathon Capital, masturbating in a conference room at the firm's New York City offices on July 23. </p>

<p>The alleged incident was detailed in a sexual harassment and hostile work environment lawsuit filed on her behalf in Manhattan Federal Court on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Williams claims she was repeatedly subjected to discriminatory and sexist behavior from Hinckley after joining the firm.  </p>

<p>In the lawsuit, Williams claims she complained several times to the company's CEO Ted Brandt about working under Hinckley prior to the masturbation incident. </p>

<p>According to the complaint, Williams walked into a conference room that Hinckley had overtaken as his own office when she found him allegedly masturbating.  </p>

<p>'Specifically, Ms Williams walked in and observed an extremely surprised look on Mr Hinkley's face. She looked down and saw Mr Hinckley desperately trying to push his penis back into his pants with his left hand,' the complaint says.  </p>

<p>According to the complaint, Williams walked into a conference room that Hinckley had overtaken as his own office when she found him allegedly masturbating. The lawsuit includes screenshots of various text messages she sent to her colleagues describing the incident</p>

<p>In the lawsuit, Williams claims she complained several times to the company's CEO Ted Brandt about working under Hinckley prior to the masturbation incident. Williams sent the above texts to Brandt following the incident and just weeks before she was fired </p>

<p>'He was simultaneously moving his computer mouse with his right hand, apparently in an effort to close whatever was open (probably pornography) on his screen.'</p>

<p>Williams said she 'mortified' by the incident and quickly left the room.  </p>

<p>The lawsuit includes screenshots of various text messages she sent to her colleagues describing the incident.</p>

<p>One text read: 'I just walked into the office to chuck jerking off alone. Like wtf. I hate working here.'</p>

<p>Another read: 'I wasn't trying to surprise him at all I actually told him that I was going to stop by the office to puck up my stuff and show him a presentation. So he knew I was going to stop by at some point.'</p>

<p>Williams said she reported the incident the following day, according to the lawsuit. </p>

<p>She claims the company subsequently tried to silence her over the next three weeks by banning her from speaking about the incident with anyone while an investigation was carried out. </p>

<p>Williams claims in the lawsuit that she got a threatening call from a private phone number on August 22 in which someone posing as an NYPD officer told her to remain quiet or 'something very bad will happen to you'.  </p>

<p>Williams claims she caught Chuck Hinckley, one of the managing directors at Marathon Capital, masturbating in a conference room at the firm's New York City offices (pictured above) on July 23</p>

<p>She subsequently sent several text messages to the CEO that went unanswered.    </p>

<p>'Ted, the New York office is not Chuck's sexual playground!' one text read. 'It's a total disregard for me - which is how this guy has always treated me. </p>

<p>'I'm very upset about it and I can't talk about it with anyone and so I feel very isolated and silenced. I need a female mentor in this industry. </p>

<p>'Ted, he can't even keep his wiener out of his hands from 9 to 5. Is it so much to ask?' </p>

<p>Williams was fired on August 24. </p>

<p>The company said various text messages and communications with other employees violated the order about not talking to anyone while the investigation was underway. </p>

<p>Williams is being represented by Wigdor LLP.</p>

<p>The firm's partner Michael J. Willemin said: 'As alleged in the complaint, a hostile and discriminatory environment was fostered at Marathon, a company run entirely by men, because of its leaders' willingness to look the other way and put profits over a safe work environment. </p>

<p>'No women should ever be subjected to the outrageous conduct Ms Williams endured, and we look forward to vindicating her rights in federal court.' </p>
