<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fashion giant H&amp;M is closing 250 of its stores globally next year as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to accelerate a major switch to online shopping. </p>

<p>H&amp;M, which is the world’s second biggest clothing retailer, said that around a quarter of its 5,000 stores are able to renegotiate or exit contracts next year, allowing it to shut around five per cent of its shops for good.</p>

<p>The locations of the shop closures, how many jobs will be axed and whether or not any UK stores will be affected, remains unclear. </p>

<p>The update came as the Swedish company said it had seen trading continue to recover in September, but sales remained 5 per cent lower than at the same point a year ago.</p>

<p>Shutting shops: Fashion giant H&amp;M is closing 250 of its stores globally next year</p>

<p>H&amp;M's total sales fell by 16 per cent to £4.4billion for the quarter to August.</p>

<p>Around 900 H&amp;M stores were closed to customers at the start of the period amid global lockdown restrictions.</p>

<p>By the end of the last quarter, around 200 H&amp;M stores around the world remained shut, the group said today.</p>

<p>The retailer also reported that its pre-tax profits fell to £210million for the nine months to 31 August, beating analyst expectations.</p>

<p>H&amp;M said it had taken 'rapid and decisive action' to manage the impact of the virus, addressing this with changes to purchasing, investments, rents, staffing and financing.</p>

<p>The company said it was stepping up its transformation plans with increased digital investment after seeing shopper demand rise across its websites.</p>

<p>Helena Helmersson, chief executive of H&amp;M, said: 'Although the challenges are far from over, we believe that the worst is behind us and we are well placed to come out of the crisis stronger.</p>

<p>'Demand for good-value, sustainable products is expected to grow in the wake of the pandemic and our customer offering is well positioned for this.</p>

<p>'We are now accelerating our transformation work so that we continue to add value for our customers.'</p>

<p>On its UK website, H&amp;M says higher demand from shoppers meant its deliveries were taking longer than normal to arrive at people's homes, with an estimated wait time of between six to eight days.</p>
