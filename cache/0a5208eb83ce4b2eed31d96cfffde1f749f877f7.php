<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian social media manager has discovered Kmart sells a lookalike pair of $807 designer sneakers for just $10 - and is encouraging fashionistas to stock up now while they can.</p>

<p>Jasmine, who lives in Sydney, shared a video of herself in the retailer on TikTok, holding up a pair of white shoes that look identical to Givenchy's popular elastic sneakers.</p>

<p>'Oh my god guys, we found Givenchy shoes at Kmart,' she said in the footage.</p>

<p>Scroll down for video </p>

<p>Jasmine, who lives in Sydney, shared a video of herself in the retailer on TikTok , holding up a pair of white shoes that look identical to Givenchy's popular elastic sneakers</p>

<p>She even suggested scrawling Givenchy on the black elastic 'bar' over the shoes with liquid paper, to make them look even more similar</p>

<p>'They are literally $10. Get 20 more of them. We're going to supply the area with Givenchy shoes from Kmart.</p>

<p>'So everyone in the Bankstown, Greenacre, Merrylands area, stop saving up all of those Centrelink fortnightly payments for real Givenchy shoes and get the Kmart ones for $10.'</p>

<p>She even suggested scrawling Givenchy on the black elastic 'bar' over the shoes with liquid paper, to make them look even more similar.  </p>

<p>Her followers were startled by the likeness and some of them openly wanted to purchase the mock designer kicks.</p>

<p>'So everyone in the Bankstown, Greenacre, Merrylands area, stop saving up all of those Centrelink fortnightly payments for real Givenchy shoes and get the Kmart ones for $10,' she said</p>

<p>'I genuinely like these. Kmart should be paying you for this advertisement,' one woman wrote beneath the video.</p>

<p>'You had me laughing at the liquid paper. I bet people will actually do this,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'My sister noticed this too. Are there any Gucci shoes in there?'</p>

<p>The website Forward has the Givenchy sneakers advertised for $807.65 and they come in European sizes 39 to 45.</p>

<p>'I genuinely like these. Kmart should be paying you for this advertisement,' one woman wrote beneath the video (Jasmine pictured)</p>

<p>They are made in Portugal and feature a leather upper with a rubber sole.</p>

<p>In comparison Kmart's elastic band sneakers for adults are $10 and made with a synthetic upper, inner and lining.</p>

<p>They are a slip on design so you don't need to tie them up every time you wear them. </p>
