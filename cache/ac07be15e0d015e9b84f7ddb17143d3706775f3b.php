<p>A study of 2,300 heart attack survivors in the US found those who displayed hostile character traits - including sarcasm, cynicism, resentment, impatience or irritability - were at much greater risk of dying of a second attack within the next two years.</p>

<p>Researchers believe this may be because the emotional state of being consistently negative puts a strain on their health.</p>

<p>Those who are hostile to others are also less likely to look after their own wellbeing - and more likely to smoke, drink and have poor lifestyle and diet.</p>

<p>A study of 2,300 heart attack survivors in the US found those who displayed hostile character traits - including sarcasm, cynicism, resentment, impatience or irritability - were at much greater risk of dying of a second attack within the next two years</p>

<p>The researchers, from the University of Tennessee in the US, tracked 2,321 heart attack survivors.</p>

<p>Hostility was measured at the beginning of the study using a personality test and the patients were then followed for 24 months.</p>

<p>Figures suggest there are 200,000 hospital visits because of heart attacks in the UK each year, while there are around 800,000 annually in the US.</p>

<p>A heart attack, known medically as a myocardial infarction, occurs when the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked. </p>

<p>Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and feeling weak and anxious.</p>

<p>Heart attacks are commonly caused by coronary heart disease, which can be brought on by smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes.</p>

<p>Treatment is usually medication to dissolve blots clots or surgery to remove the blockage.</p>

<p>Reduce your risk by not smoking, exercising regularly and drinking in moderation.</p>

<p>Heart attacks are different to a cardiac arrest, which occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, usually due to a problem with electrical signals in the organ. </p>

<p>At the end of the two years the participants' survival rates were compared to their personality scores, and hostility could be accurately used to predict someone's chance of dying of a repeat heart attack.</p>

<p>The researchers, writing in the European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing, said someone's character could impact the heart;through both behavioural and psychological mechanisms'.</p>

<p>'Hostile individuals have increased clotting times, higher adrenaline levels, above normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and increased cardiac reactivity,' they said.</p>

<p>'These known inflammatory factors may initiate cardiac events and increase poor clinical outcomes.' Previous research has found that being optimistic has a direct impact on cardiovascular health - reducing stress hormones, pulse rate and blood pressure.</p>

<p>And people with a positive outlook eat better, do more exercise and are less likely to drink.</p>

<p>Those with a sunny disposition are also less likely to smoke - and if they already smoke they are better at quitting.</p>

<p>Scientists also believe someone's general mood alters the levels of harmful and beneficial hormones in their body.</p>

<p>Being optimistic, for example, reduces stress and anxiety hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which can place a burden on the heart and raise blood pressure.</p>

<p>Study author Tracey Vitori of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said: 'Hostility is a personality trait that includes being sarcastic, cynical, resentful, impatient or irritable.</p>

<p>'It's not just a one-off occurrence but characterises how a person interacts with people.</p>

<p>'We know that taking control of lifestyle habits improves the outlook for heart attack patients and our study suggests that improving hostile behaviours could also be a positive move.' </p>
