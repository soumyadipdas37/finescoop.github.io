<p>Can you spot the SAS soldiers in this photo? Their winter camouflage includes face masks and white speckled clothing and equipment </p>

<p>The outfit makes it possible for them to move almost invisibly through mountains and forests in snowy conditions. </p>

<p>Members of the Mountain Troops  are among the best climbers in the world and have trained in various climbing schools across Europe and many go on climbing expeditions up some of the world's highest mountains, including Everest. </p>

<p>Mountain Troops use a range of equipment in their role, including climbing shoes with sticky rubber soles, climbing harnesses, carabiners for hooking onto climbing rope lines and nuts - metal wedges that fit into cracks, used to secure climbing lines.  </p>

<p>Their skills have been required throughout history until recently where their training in high-altitude warfare was used in the mountain ranges of Afghanistan. </p>

<p>They were used during the 1982 Falklands conflict and during the cold war, they were used in Norway to guard Nato's northern flanks against an expected Soviet push. </p>
