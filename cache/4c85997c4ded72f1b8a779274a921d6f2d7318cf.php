<p>West Ham are making a £20million move for Fiorentina centre back Nikola Milenkovic (right)</p>

<p>Milenkovic is 6'5" tall and technically good with the versatility to be able to play at right-back</p>

<p>He has been tracked by some of Europe’s top sides, including Manchester United and the offer may yet fall short of Fiorentina’s valuation.</p>

<p>David Moyes has made strengthening his defence a priority of this transfer window and is also discussing a move for Slavia Prague right back Vladimir Coufal.</p>

<p>Moyes needs cover in that position after Ryan Fredericks picked up a hamstring injury in the 4-0 win over Wolves on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>David Moyes is also discussing a possible move for Slavia Prague right back Vladimir Coufal</p>

<p>Coufal, 28, is a Czech Republic international and former teammate of West Ham's Tomas Soucek. </p>

<p>He was part of the Czech side that beat England 2-1 last October in the European Championship qualifiers, though struggled against the pace of Raheem Sterling.</p>

<p>Bruges' goalscoring midfielder Hans Vanaken is also among players Moyes is keen on. </p>
