<p>Addison, who served as the national Bandidos president for two decades, has also brought his sons to the Mongols.</p>

<p>The reason for his departure his unclear.</p>

<p>Around ten former Bandidos have ditched their former patches to join the Mongols over recent months.</p>

<p>The club now has more than 100 members since Mitchell took over the reigns. </p>

<p>Mitchell pleaded guilty to possessing ice, cocaine and a baton after police searched his car and Docklands apartment in September 2015.</p>

<p>Police found snaplock bags containing 331.8 grams of methamphetamine and 168.2 grams of cocaine inside Mitchell's car.</p>

<p>They also found a baton in the driver's door of the former bikie's car.</p>

<p>In passing sentence, a Judge Hicks said: 'You have a reasonably lengthy criminal history.</p>

<p>'I accept by your pleas of guilty that you have some remorse for your actions.'</p>

<p>Mitchell had 21 surgeries to save his life, and a further nine to deal with complications, the court heard</p>

<p>Mitchell had 21 surgeries to save his life, and a further nine to deal with complications, the court heard.</p>

<p>While he recovered, the shooting effectively ended Mitchell's career as a personal trainer and a 'fitness fanatic' who had previously been a kickboxing champion.</p>

<p>The ex-Bandido also survived being shot in the arm in March 2013 after more than 30 rounds were fired at a Melton bikie clubhouse. </p>
