<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New laws will give undercover spies legal protection to commit crimes as the UK's head of counter-terrorism warned children as young as 13 are plotting attacks.  </p>

<p>Under new laws expected to be unveiled this week, organisations such as MI5 will be able to authorise agents to carry out 'necessary and proportionate' offences.</p>

<p>According to The Telegraph it follows a long battle over the Security Service guidelines and how legal it is to allow agents to break the law. </p>

<p>UK's head of counter-terrorism policing Neil Basu (pictured) warned teenagers as young as 13 are starting to talk about committing terror attacks</p>

<p>Last year, the policy was ruled as lawful under the Security Service Act, but members at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal were split on the decision.</p>

<p>The Government now want to make sure the Security Service has the protection it needs for undercover missions.  </p>

<p>The law is expected to create a legal framework to authorise crime by agents, including those from the MI5, working on covert missions. </p>

<p>It will not limit the types of crimes an operative can commit, but it is not known how far the protection will cover.  </p>

<p>This comes as the UK's head of counter-terrorism policing warned teenagers as young as 13 are starting to talk about committing terror attacks.  </p>

<p>Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu was telling MPs about the terror threat the country faces.</p>

<p>This was particularly describing a 'dramatic' rise in the number of right-wing cases he said when speaking to the Commons Home Affairs Committee on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr Basu said: 'What I am seeing, particularly in the right-wing terrorism space - and this is anecdotal so it is not academic - but is an increase in lots of young people being attracted to this.</p>

<p>'We are seeing people as young as 13 starting to talk about committing terrorist attacks.' </p>

<p>He said social media has been a strong influence, particularly during the coronavirus lockdown when there was 'no other form of distraction or protective factor'. </p>

<p>Mr Basu said counter-terror police and MI5 had more than 800 terror investigations under way. </p>

<p>He predicted a 30% rise in the threat since 2017 is 'still there' and 'sustained at that very high level'.   </p>

<p>Most terrorists are 30 or younger and male, he said, but added: 'What has been disturbing is the number that are becoming much younger.</p>

<p>'It's still small, if I showed you the figures you would go 'well that's not much'. But the worrying thing is the trajectory is downwards in age terms.'</p>

<p>Mr Basu told the committee the casework for right-wing terrorism had risen from 6% in 2016 to 10%, while the majority continues to be Islamist.</p>

<p>Last year he characterised it as the fastest growing terror threat.</p>

<p>The law is expected to create a legal framework to authorise crime by agents, including those from the MI5, working on covert missions</p>

<p>Police and security services have started to look more at the right-wing threat, he said, adding: 'A near doubling of that threat since 2016 does worry me.'</p>

<p>In June, 19% of the 243 terrorist prisoners in Great Britain were categorised as holding far right-wing ideologies, a rise of four percentage points in a year, according to Home Office figures.</p>

<p>The proportion of prisoners holding right-wing ideologies has risen 'steadily' over the last three years, up from 33 to a record of 45 in the latest year, after just six were recorded in 2013. </p>

<p>He expressed his concerns about the rise in extremism generally.</p>

<p>Mr Basu said: 'My biggest concern at the moment is where extremism affects malleable, vulnerable people, of all kinds, age groups and societal backgrounds.</p>

<p>'The amplification of extremism and its ability to incite a vulnerable section of the population towards terrorism is probably my greatest single fear.'</p>

<p>He said Covid-19 had 'amplified the problem'.</p>
