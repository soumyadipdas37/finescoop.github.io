<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This driver in India took the perils of parallel parking to new heights after expertly maneuvering a people-carrier in between two sheer drops.</p>

<p>PJ Biju, a bus driver from Kerala, India, had collected a friend's white Toyota Innova ahead of planned works on the car's paint and was attempting to park it near his house when his wife recorded his astonishing parallel park.</p>

<p>In the video shared on Twitter on Sunday, PJ is seen driving up to a parking space, behind two metal railings, with sheer drops either side of the concrete spot.</p>

<p>Bus driver PJ Biju expertly manoeures a white Toyota Innova people-carrier into a perilous parking space behind two metal railings and between sharp drops in Kerala, India</p>

<p>The manoeuvre would have been a challenge for even the most experienced of drivers, but PJ, who is used to driving buses that are 12.5m long, made it look easy.</p>

<p>In the footage, the people-carrier pulls up alongside the less-than-inviting space and casually reverses back into it - leaving the rear wheels of the vehicle only inches from the sheer drop.</p>

<p>After only a couple of minor adjustments, PJ successfully parks the people-carrier and gets out to inspect his work.</p>

<p>Speaking to Manorama News PJ said: 'I have been driving buses, especially on the Ernakulam - Kannur route for many years. And those vehicles are 12 and a half metres long. </p>

<p>PJ (pictured) works as a bus driver and is used to parking vehicles that are 12.5m long and said because of this, parking other smaller motors isn't a problem</p>

<p>'So the Innova's length has never been much of a problem for me. Be it any car, you have a mental picture of the size of the vehicle. It's all about that understanding and confidence.' </p>

<p>A second video posted on social media showed PJ get back into the vehicle and expertly manoeuvre out of the space again. </p>

<p>Collectively, the two videos have received over 50,000 likes on Twitter since being posted. </p>

<p>PJ said he had been unaware that his wife had even recorded his parking attempt and only found out when people started leaving likes on the video.</p>

<p>When asked about the response his parking technique has received on social media, PJ said: 'I am just awestruck by this. I had no clue this would happen.'</p>

<p>PJ smoothly reverses the people-carrier backwards into the space until the rear wheels are only inches from the drop, before making a couple of minor adjustments to complete his parallel park</p>
