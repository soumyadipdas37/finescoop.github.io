<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A man who survived a knife rampage in Birmingham has today been pictured - as a suspect was remanded in custody accused of murder and attempting to kill seven others.</p>

<p>Zephaniah McLeod, 27, is accused of killing Jacob Billington, 23, during a two-hour spree of stabbings which left several injured in the early hours of Sunday. </p>

<p>Mr Billington, of Liverpool, died as a result of a knife wound to the neck after being attacked on a night out while visiting a school friend studying in the city. </p>

<p>Teacher Rhys Cummings, 24, was among those injured in the attack alongside his friend Shane Rowley. The pair had been out in the city centre during the rampage.</p>

<p>Mr Cummings' mother Hazel today said her son is 'doing OK' after his ordeal, explaining his recovery is likely to be 'a long process'.</p>

<p>Teacher Rhys Cummings (pictured), 24, was among the victims of the attack alongside his friend Shane Rowley. The pair had been out in Birmingham city centre ahead of the rampage</p>

<p>She added: 'It is not something you get over quickly.</p>

<p>'The police have been very good and very supportive. We would like to thank them for all they are doing.'      </p>

<p>Mr Billington's friend and bandmate Michael Callaghan, 23, was seriously injured in the violent attack on Irving Street and remains in a critical condition in hospital.</p>

<p>McLeod is also accused of attempting to murder Dimitar Bachvarov, Migle Dolobauskaite, Thomas Glassey and Ryan Bowers. </p>

<p>A 22-year-old woman attacked in Hurst Street is critical but stable and another man, 30, remains in a serious condition in hospital. Four others have been discharged.</p>

<p>Today, McLeod appeared before Birmingham Magistrates Court via videolink for a brief five minute hearing during which he was not required to enter a plea.</p>

<p>He was wearing a grey t-shirt and repeatedly rubbed his eyes, face and forehead but otherwise remained emotionless as the case was outlined against him. </p>

<p>Zephaniah McLeod, 27, spoke to confirm his personal details during a five-minute appearance before two magistrates today. The defendant, who appeared from Birmingham's Perry Barry custody block, was remanded to appear by videolink at the city's Crown Court tomorrow</p>

<p>The force declared a major incident after Jacob Billington (pictured) was killed and seven others were stabbed during a rampage on Sunday spanning 90 minutes </p>

<p>Police had issued CCTV images of a man wanted in connection with a series of stabbings</p>

<p>He spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth, with the court unable to hear his responses at first, before he was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>McLeod, of Nately Grove in the Selly Oak area of Birmingham, will next appear at the city's Crown Court tomorrow.</p>

<p>Daniel Devine, prosecuting, said: 'I wish to prosecute remotely and I make that application in the interest of justice.</p>

<p>'I invite any prisoners to also be allowed to appear over link. There's nothing for me to announce but custody time limits will be set until March.'    </p>

<p>Chair of the Magistrates David Warner: 'We have no problem with that application is granted. </p>

<p>'You will be remanded in custody and appear over video link at Birmingham Crown Court tomorrow. </p>

<p>West Midlands Police arrested a man at a house in Selly Oak, Birmingham in a dramatic dawn raid earlier this week</p>

<p>Forensic officers cross a cordon on Hurst Walk, off Hurst Street, and near to the Arcadia Centre, where part of the attack took place</p>

<p>'You can go with the officers now, please. This court expresses its sympathy with all those affected by these tragic events.'</p>

<p>Mr Billington was attacked in Irving Street at 1.52am, nearly 90 minutes after police were called to the first of four attacks a mile away at Constitution Hill.</p>

<p>His family have since paid tribute to a 'special person' who 'lit up every room' with his energy and humour. </p>

<p>They said: 'Jacob was the light of our life and we have been devastated by his loss. He was a funny, caring and wonderful person who was loved by every single person he met.</p>

<p>'He lit up every room with his boundless energy and witty humour and the loss of such a special person will be felt by all who knew him for years to come.'</p>

<p>Police had arrested McLeod in his pyjamas at 4am on Monday - 24 hours after a knifeman struck in the city centre.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, West Midlands Police said another 22-year-old woman, attacked on Hurst Street in the city's Gay Village, remains in a critical but stable condition.</p>

<p>Birmingham Police Commander, Chief Superintendent Steve Graham said: 'Our thoughts and sympathies remain with Jacob Billington's family and friends, plus the other victims of this senseless attack who we wish a speedy recovery.</p>

<p>'We are determined to get justice for Jacob and everyone else who has been impacted by these terrible acts.'</p>
