<p>Over and out: Lisa Armstrong was taking the final steps in her split from Ant McPartlin on Friday as her belongings were removed from their former marital home</p>

<p>Lisa split from Ant in 2018 after 12 years of marriage, and is now reported to be dating James Green. Lisa and Ant, who is now dating Anne-Marie Corbett, finalised their £62million divorce back in April after their split in January 2018. </p>

<p>Lisa, who received £31million in her divorce settlement from Ant, was clearing out the home of all beloved posessions, including her gym equipment. </p>

<p>Last week, in another stage of her moving process, she the goods in boxes marked 'help yourself' and put them outside her west London property as she prepares to move out of the marital home she formerly shared with her ex.</p>

<p>The items were easily identifiable as Ant's because they included his Newcastle United shirts and a 'Team Ant' foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway. There was also Ant's old dressing gown and a pile of board games. </p>

<p>Powerful: Removals men were seen taking a plethora of items out of the house, including artwork, a sofa and a Power Plate Pro5 Vibration Plate, costing £1,195</p>

<p>All over: Lisa and Ant finalised their divorce back in April after their split in January 2018 following the presenter's highly documented battle with painkillers and alcohol</p>

<p>'Help yourself': Last week, the make-up artist, who has resumed work on Strictly Come Dancing and just released a cosmetics line, made a bold statement as she left her famous ex-husband's unwanted possessions on the pavement for passers-by to take</p>

<p>No longer needed was Piers Morgan's book The Insider and Lisa threw in her own Craig Revel Horwood's Tales from the Dance Floor. </p>

<p>She was also throwing out a bowl used by their beloved Labrador, Hurley, as well as a Banksy artwork calendar and a Jamie Oliver book. </p>

<p>A source told The Sun Lisa is leaving her West London house and wanted a 'big clear out.' They added: 'Ant had already sifted through what he wanted to keep and had gophers collect them in recent weeks. </p>

<p>New me! Last week, Lisa showed off her blonder locks as she headed back to work ahead of Strictly Come Dancing</p>

<p>Bedding: The removals men got to work on moving the items </p>

<p>'What was left is being offered for free. His bathrobe has been taken. Footie memorabilia has also been given away. But it was the end for his Newcastle shirts.'    </p>

<p>Last week, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said he did not agree with Lisa's decision to throw out these possessions, even though she is divorced.</p>

<p>He was particularly astonished to see she had thrown out his book.</p>

<p>Piers told co-host Susanna Reid and the audience: 'Ant McPartlin’s ex Lisa Armstrong – who is a wonderful makeup artist, she does my makeup on Life Stories.</p>

<p>Load me up! The maneuvered a bed into one of the vast moving trucks</p>

<p>Clothing: There were also garment boxes </p>

<p>'And I thought we were friends. I really did. I was quite friendly with Ant. Apparently this is stuff that Ant himself didn’t want back.</p>

<p>'These are the unwanted items that neither of them ever wanted to see again. There were things you’d expect, like Craig Revel Horwood’s Tales From the Dancefloor. Wholly understandable.</p>

<p>'His Newcastle shirt. I wouldn’t want to keep them either. A Team Ant foam hand from Saturday Night Takeaway. Again, why would you want that?</p>

<p>Looking good: Ant and Anne-Marie are now an item</p>
