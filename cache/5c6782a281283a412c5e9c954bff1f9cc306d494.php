<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A coronavirus conspiracy leader has been dramatically arrested a day before anti-lockdown protests his group promoted were to hit Melbourne's streets.</p>

<p>James Bartolo was detained at his Melbourne home on Friday morning after four policemen knocked down his door when he refused to open it. </p>

<p>The former bodybuilder was handcuffed on his lounge room floor in a struggle seconds after police broke inside.</p>

<p>He is expected to be the fifth protest organiser charged with incitement after a series of posts and videos on Thursday night.</p>

<p>Former bodybuilder James Bartolo is a key figure in conspiracy theory circles, holding talks on many subjects and organising followers. He has been arrested for incitement</p>

<p>Bartolo filmed the two detectives and two uniformed officers from his balcony as they arrived at his unit with a search warrant.</p>

<p>He told them they didn't have authorisation to be on the property, despite the warrant stating they could enter by force if necessary.</p>

<p>'You are illegally trespassing and you will be charged. If you break anything you will be prosecuted,' he shouted at the officers.</p>

<p>However, the lead detective was in no mood to entertain Bartolo's bizarre pseudo-legal beliefs that police don't have power over him.</p>

<p>'Open the door or I'll force it, I'm not playing a game,' he called out.</p>

<p>'You've had all the opportunity in the world, James, are you going to come open the door, yes or no?'</p>

<p>Bartolo filmed the two detectives and two uniformed officers from his balcony as they arrived at his unit with a search warrant, and bashed down hs door when he wouldn't open it</p>

<p>Bartolo ran downstairs as the banging at the door got louder, arriving just as police swarmed into his unit. He was then arrested in a struggle on his lounge room floor</p>

<p>Bartolo protested that he was on the toilet when the officers knocked on his door, and demanded they tell him what was going on.</p>

<p>He still refused as they tried to explain he was suspected of incitement, which he denied, saying he told people not to go to the protest.</p>

<p>'Leave my s<strong>t, don't break my stuff you f</strong>king r****ds,' he yelled as police began to break down his door with a battering ram.</p>

<p>Bartolo ran downstairs as the banging at the door got louder, arriving just as police swarmed into his unit.</p>

<p>Officers yelled at him to get on the ground and put his hands behind his back as they grabbed and handcuffed him. </p>

<p>Bartolo runs the Conscious Truth Network group on Facebook which is a hub for a long list of conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Planned 'Freedom Day' protests on Saturday are regularly discussed and promoted by Bartolo and his disciples on the group page.</p>
