<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britney Spears showered love on both her sons this weekend as she marked their birthdays - which are just two days apart.</p>

<p>While her firstborn son Jayden turns 14 this Saturday, her younger boy Sean Preston will be celebrating his 13th birthday on Monday.</p>

<p>The pop star, who shares both her children with her ex-husband Kevin Federline, wrote: 'My two lil men’s birthdays are this week !!!!!! You guys are getting older and so big and are waaay cooler than me !!!!! </p>

<p>'love you both to the moon and back': Britney Spears showered love on both her sons this Saturday on Instagram to mark their birthdays, posting a picture by Karen Cantuq</p>

<p>'I love you both to the moon and back ….. and I hope all of your bday wishes come true and more !!!!!'</p>

<p>Britney's message accompanied a picture by Canadian artist Karen Cantuq of a red night sky with flowers sticking out of a cloud near a full moon.</p>

<p>Kevin, who split from Britney in 2007, currently have an arrangement that gives him 70 per cent custody of the children and her the remaining 30.</p>

<p>Jayden went live on Instagram in early March and talked a great deal about his family, including claiming that his mother may leave the music industry.</p>

<p>The video was soon removed and Kevin's lawyer Mark Vincent Kaplan told the media: 'This is what happens when a 13-year-old acts like they’re 13 years old. Kevin is handling the situation as you would expect from any responsible parent,' according to People.</p>

<p>The way they were: While her firstborn son Jayden turns 14 this Saturday her younger boy Sean will be celebrating his 13th birthday on Monday; she is pictured with them in 2013</p>

<p>Her birthday wish comes after her father Jamie Spears accused her lawyer of 'grandstanding' by trying to unseal parts of her ongoing conservatorship case.</p>

<p>The 68-year-old says it's too soon for Britney to be making decisions about the future of her conservatorship and only the court can decide if she has the capacity to understand the consequences of making certain information public.</p>

<p>In court documents seen by TMZ Jamie accuses Britney's lawyer of making a show of trying to unseal the court documents at a time when the #FreeBritney movement is getting a lot of media attention.</p>

<p>Legal battle: Jamie Spears is accusing daughter Britney's lawyer of 'grandstanding' by trying to unseal parts of her ongoing conservatorship case. The 68-year-old says it's too soon for Britney to be making decisions about the future of her conservatorship</p>

<p>Protecting her? Jamie reportedly wants Britney's medical records to remain sealed as he's concerned about the affect it could have on her if made public</p>

<p>Jamie says that before Britney can waive her right to privacy, it needs to be determined by the court that the singer has 'the capacity to understand the consequences of her waiver.'</p>

<p>Jamie reportedly wants Britney's medical records to remain sealed as he's concerned about the affect it could have on her if made public. He also reportedly wants to protect her two sons from the possible detrimental effects of the sensitive information going public.  </p>

<p>He also responded to Britney's lawyer's claim that she wants more 'personal autonomy' in her life. </p>

<p>Jamie responded that the conservatorship is voluntary and Britney can file to terminate at any time but hasn't at any point. </p>

<p>Taking action: An attorney for Britney filed court documents in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her conservatorship case</p>

<p>Britney's lawyer has also stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke',</p>

<p>Earlier this month the singer's attorney filed court documents on her behalf in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her legal case and stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke', TMZ reported on Thursday. </p>

<p>The viral movement is popular among Britney's fans who believe that the pop star is being held 'hostage' and controlled by her caretakers.</p>

<p>Spears' lawyer filed documents to oppose Britney's dad Jamie's motion to seal parts of his daughters conservatorship case, according to TMZ. </p>

<p>'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote. </p>

<p>The outlet added that the Toxic singer said that there were 'no medical issues or sensitive issues with her children to protect' and thus no reason to keep it hidden from the public eye. </p>

<p>Britney shares sons Sean Preston, 14 and Jayden James, 13 with ex Kevin Federline.</p>

<p>Jamie responded to Britney's lawyer that the conservatorship is voluntary and Britney can file to terminate at any time but hasn't at any point. (Jamie pictured in 2008 when the conservatorship was put in place)</p>

<p>The legal filing also included the icon's stance on the Free Britney movement, popular among her fans. </p>

<p>Many fans have been using online petitions, social media posts and even some in-person protests to call for the Womanizer crooner to be released from her conservatorship.</p>

<p>'[Britney] welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans,' her lawyer penned on her behalf. </p>

<p>Spears' dad Jamie, who has been in control of the conservatorship since its inception, has previously tried to shut down the controversial movement as illegitimate. </p>

<p>The court document stated of Free Britney: 'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a 'joke' as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public.' </p>

<p>That line seemed to be in direct response to an interview that Britney's dad gave last month in an effort to curtail the movement.</p>

<p>'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a 'joke' as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public,' Britney's lawyer said in court documents</p>

<p>'All these conspiracy theorists don't know anything,' Jamie told PageSix.</p>

<p>Adding: 'The world don't have a clue. It's up to the court of California to decide what's best for my daughter. It's no one else's business.'  </p>

<p>Earlier this summer the Free Britney frenzy reached a fever pitch when a legion of her fans became convinced that her social media videos were old and being shared by her team to try to 'fake' that she is okay.</p>

<p>That prompted Spears to share a sort of proof-of-life post - a date stamped photo  - to assuage the concerned fans and show she isn't locked up and still has access to her phone. </p>

<p>'Just so you guys know these aren't old ... check the date at the top of the 2nd pic!!!!' she wrote in the caption at the time.  </p>

<p>'The fact you need to post the date to prove she's real looks really suspicious...we all know someone's running the account,' wrote one person who wasn't placated by the attempt. </p>

<p>This latest court filing is part of Britney's ongoing effort to have her father's legal control over career, finances and estate lifted or loosened.</p>

<p>Last month, her lawyers submitted paper work stating she was 'strongly opposed' to her father having control of her estate and finances, according to TMZ.</p>

<p>The why: A principal motivation for the changes Britney is seeking appears to be her desire to no longer continue performing; she has not performed live since October 2018 (Pictured on tour in August 2018)</p>

<p>Instead the singer wishes for her temporary conservator Jodi Montgomery to take on the role permanently. </p>

<p>Jamie was appointed as his daughter's conservator in 2008 following her very public breakdown. However, last year, he stepped aside from the role due to ongoing health issues.</p>

<p>A principal motivation for the changes Britney is seeking appears to be her desire to no longer continue performing.</p>

<p>She has not performed live since October 2018 when she wrapped up the final legs of her Piece of Me Tour after concluding her Las Vegas residency on December 31, 2017.</p>

<p>Since then, she has been living mainly at her mansion in Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles, with her boyfriend Sam Asghari. </p>
