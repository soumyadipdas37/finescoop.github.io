<p>The 40th anniversary edition of the Game &amp; Watch will go on sale November 13 and cost $49</p>

<p>The original Game &amp; Watch was first introduced in 1980, pictured, and produced until 1991</p>

<p>It resulted in a series of 59 black &amp; white games until the Nintendo Game Boy took over. </p>

<p>The new Game &amp; Watch, however, will look very similar to the original and its style is based on the 1980s version, only this time it will have a color LCD screen along with a rechargeable battery and USB connection. </p>

<p>It will be capable of playing three games, Super Mario Bros. Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels and Ball.  </p>

<p>Donkey Kong was an extremely popular version of the device in 1982</p>

<p>After the success of the device in the early 1980s, Nintendo went on to release the popular Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985 and Game Boy in 1989. </p>
