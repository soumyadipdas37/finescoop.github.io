<p>After 32 viewers challenged the claims, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said Quorn's owner Marlow Foods did not make clear what food the pot was being measured against.</p>

<p>Quorn, which makes meat replacement products, put out the TV advert in April. It sees a woman eating Quorn's Thai Style Wonder Grains. </p>

<p>She says 'I care about climate change' and the pot is a 'step in the right direction' because it helps her reduce her carbon footprint.</p>

<p>Marlow Foods said the rice pot was certified by the Carbon Trust, which helps businesses to become more sustainable.</p>

<p>The food firm also said it had signed up to a carbon protocol, with a commitment to continue cutting the product's emissions.</p>

<p>It added that Quorn Pieces, a key ingredient, had a lower carbon footprint than chicken.</p>

<p>However, because the advert did not make clear the basis of the firm's claims, the ASA concluded its message was likely to mislead consumers.</p>

<p>In its ruling, the watchdog told Marlow Foods to ensure its environmental claims were made clear and did not 'mislead by omitting material information from their ads'. </p>
