<p>West Ham manager David Moyes is adamant his side should have been awarded a penalty</p>

<p>Speaking after the game, Moyes told Sky Sports: 'Yeah I think we should have had a penalty. They're saying something to do with his sleeve, it hits the boy's arm. Even with the old rules we'd still be saying it's a penalty but we don't know the rules really.'</p>

<p>West Ham fell behind to a goal from Alexandre Lacazette but managed to pull level when Michail Antonio scored just before half time.</p>
