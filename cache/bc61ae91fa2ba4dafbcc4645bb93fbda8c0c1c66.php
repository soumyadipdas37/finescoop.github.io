<p>A Post Office Travel Money report reveals 22 out of 24 surveyed cities (all on the quarantine exemption list) are cheaper than they were in March</p>

<p>TOP-OF-THE-LIST LITHUANIA</p>

<p>Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, is this year’s cheapest European city break. Crucially, this doesn’t stop it being a spectacular destination with gothic buildings, imposing churches and castles.</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHT: The 16th century Church of St Anne — best of all it’s free (govilnius.lt).</p>

<p>With three cities on this list, Poland is the best European country for a well-priced city break.</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHT: 18th-century Lazienki Palace (lazienki-krolewskie.pl/en).</p>

<p>GETTING THERE: Ryanair (ryanair.com) London to Warsaw from £34 return.</p>

<p>TRAMTASTIC LISBON</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHT: Jeronimos Monastery, built in 1495 (lisbon.net/jeronimos-monastery).</p>

<p>UNDER THE RADAR</p>

<p>Bratislava, the Slovakian capital has medieval charm as well as Soviet intrigue in its eastern quarter </p>

<p>Bratislava is often overlooked as nearby Vienna gets the plaudits. But the Slovakian capital has all the medieval charm of its neighbour, as well as Soviet intrigue in its eastern quarter. Outside the city, visit the fairy tale Koliba Forest or Devin Castle.</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHT: The UFO restaurant for a quirky meal and the best views of the Danube (u-f-o.sk).</p>

<p>GETTING THERE: Wizz Air London to Bratislava from £42 return.</p>

<p>QUIRKY ESTONIA</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHT: Visit the National Gardens and see the Acropolis (discovergreece.com).</p>

<p>GETTING THERE: EasyJet London to Athens from £61 return.</p>

<p>IRISH CHARMS</p>

<p>FESTIVAL OF FUN</p>

<p>No fringe this year, but there’s still a lot on offer in the Scottish capital</p>

<p>No fringe this year, but there’s still a lot on offer in the Scottish capital, whether it’s the grand Edinburgh Castle, the views from Arthur’s Seat, a saunter down the Royal Mile or just dipping into Leith’s bars and restaurants.</p>

<p>Edinburgh lays claim to being the UK’s most spectacular city, with Georgian architecture to make even Prince Charles swoon.</p>

<p>Best of all, due to its relatively small size, traversing this city on foot is a breeze. And if you get tired, jump on the tram.</p>

<p>HIGHLIGHT: Build up your appetite with a walk up to Arthur’s Seat — then take your pick from fine dining to cheap eats, Edinburgh is said to have more restaurants per head than any other UK city.</p>

<p>GETTING THERE: EasyJet London to Edinburgh from £48 return.</p>

<p>EASY ON THE EYE</p>

<p>The Ljubljanica River, which runs through the pretty Slovenian capital, is lined with charming cafes, and Ljubljana itself is surrounded by dramatic mountains and overlooked by a magnificent castle. Easy on the eye and with a population of just 300,000, it’s a real pleasure to explore the city’s art galleries and museums.</p>

<p>For something quirky, the Museum of Illusions has mind-bending exhibitions.</p>
