<p>Stunning: Emily Ratajkowski continued to prove she is her own best advertisement when it comes to promoting her fashion line</p>

<p>To her 26.8 million followers' delight, the beauty posed up a storm in a crouched position and flashed plenty of her sun-kissed skin.   </p>

<p>She matched her head-turning $85 bikini top, which featured a classic triangle top with ruched detailing, with a pair of matching low-rise bottoms, at the same price. </p>

<p>The garments both appeared to have a slight sheen, as they glistened against her lithe figure and long legs.  </p>

<p>She said she drank copious amounts of red wine during the shoot, and she noted that she was 'very, very drunk' by the end of the night. She was 20 at the time. </p>

<p> Coming foward: Earlier this month, she accused photographer Jonathan Leder of sexual assault during a nude shoot at his home in the Catskills in 2012</p>

<p>Later, she opened up on Instagram to her followers  about being  'so nervous' she couldn't sleep the night before it was published </p>

<p>'I was cold, shivering, and huddled under a blanket,' she wrote. 'Jonathan and I were on his couch, and the rough texture of his jeans rubbed against my bare legs.'</p>

<p>Ratajkowski described how Leder began asking her about her 'boyfriends,' and she said she 'remembers talking a lot' about her dating history and the men she loved, while 'absentmindedly rubbing [her] feet against one another and against his for warmth.'</p>

<p>'He told me he liked "that foot thing you’re doing," and I remember this moment more clearly than anything else,' she said. 'I hate that Jonathan commented on something I’ve done throughout my life to comfort myself. I hate that sometimes, even now, when I rub my feet together because I’m cold or afraid or exhausted, I think of Jonathan.</p>

<p>At odds: Leder vehemently denied her claims and has all but disappeared from social media, but Heather Tynan, the editorial director of his company, Imperial Publishing, released a statement attacking the model and accusing her of trying to drum up press for herself with the story</p>

<p> 'Most of what came next was a blur except for the feeling,' Ratajkowski continued. 'I don’t remember kissing, but I do remember his fingers suddenly being inside of me. Harder and harder and pushing and pushing like no one had touched me before or has touched me since.</p>

<p>'I could feel the shape of myself and my ridges, and it really, really hurt. I brought my hand instinctively to his wrist and pulled his fingers out of me with force. I didn’t say a word. He stood up abruptly and scurried silently into the darkness up the stairs.'</p>
