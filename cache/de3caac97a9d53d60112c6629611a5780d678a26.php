<p>After part of the song played, Tony hilariously called Karl a 'stupid little man.'</p>

<p>'You stupid little man, if you honestly think I'm going to come on and be all grumpy and morose, you're wrong Karl, you're wrong!' Tony said.</p>

<p>He added: 'I'm thrilled to the back teeth Brisbane has stolen the biggest sporting event in Australia, I couldn't be happier... I know the AFL-loving fans in Queensland will get behind it.'</p>

<p>'They'll embrace everything that is special with the AFL... it's not like we have nothing to do. It's bin night tonight,' Tony added, making Karl laugh even harder.  </p>

<p>'I liked it!' Karl then joked about being called a 'stupid little man,' saying he's never been called that before</p>

<p>'I've never been called that before, but I liked it,' he said, before joking that he's been 'called worse' over the years.  </p>

<p>Remember that? Tony is a Melbourne-based sports reporter for the Today show, who made headlines in 2016 for trying to give WAG Rebecca Judd a kiss on the cheek</p>

<p>The incident with Rebecca occurred on Nine News Melbourne in August 2016, when Tony attempted to give the AFL WAG a peck on the cheek before she went on maternity leave.</p>

<p>'Good luck, Bec!' he said, before leaning in. At that moment, the WAG instinctively pulled away and yelped, before bursting into fits of giggles.</p>

<p>Realising he had just been rejected on camera, Tony crossed his arms and grumbled, 'OK, good, this is going well,' as his face turned red.</p>

<p>Awkward! The WAG instinctively pulled away and yelped, before bursting into fits of giggles. Tony was rejected on camera</p>
