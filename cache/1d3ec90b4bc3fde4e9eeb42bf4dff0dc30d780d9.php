<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Google announced today that its annual hardware event will take place September 30 at 11am PT.</p>

<p>'Launch Night In,' a virtual event which will be livestreamed to the public, is expected to include details about several new products, including two new Pixel phones, a smart speaker and the successor to Google Chromecast.</p>

<p>In a blog post in August, Google teased it would be sharing info on new devices as well as its approach to 5G ‘in the coming months.’</p>

<p>‘This fall, we’ll have two more devices to talk about: The Pixel 4a (5G), starting at $499, and Pixel 5, both with 5G2 to make streaming videos, downloading content and playing games on Stadia or other platforms faster and smoother than ever,’</p>

<p>Both phones will be available in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Australia.</p>

<p>Google's annual hardware event will be held online September 30, when details about two new Pixel phones, a smart speaker, and the successor to Chromecast are expected to be shared</p>

<p>Google unveiled details about the highly anticipated Pixel 4a smartphone in August, after months of pandemic-related delays.</p>

<p>Its new streaming device, known internally as ‘Sabrina,’ likely will be powered by Android TV, Mashable reports.</p>

<p>Unlike its predecessors, which operate via smartphone, it’s expected to have a physical remote.</p>

<p>According to leaked images, the Pixel 5 will have a single selfie camera in the top left corner of its front display, with a rectangular camera bump with three sensors and a flash on the back.</p>

<p>Google unveiled the much anticipated Pixel 4a in August after months of coronavirus-related delays. At the September 30 event, it will reveal details on the 5G-powered Pixel 5 and 4a smartphones</p>

<p> Both the Pixel 5 and the 4a are expected to be powered by the Snapdragon 765 and offer 5G network connectivity as standard.</p>

<p>The 5.8-inch Pixel 5 will be carved out of aluminum, according to reports, while the 6.1-inch Pixel 4a will have a plastic build.</p>

<p>The rumored new smart speaker will likely be an update to the Google Home, Android Authority reports, revamped with Nest branding. </p>

<p>Last week, the latest Google Nest Thermostat, featuring Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios, got the FCC’s blessing. </p>

<p>'Sabrina' went before the FCC for regulatory approval in August, and the 5G-powered Pixel 4a and Pixel 5 were submitted to the agency earlier this month.</p>

<p>It was a big day of announcements for the online giant: Google also shared that it plans to operate entirely on carbon-free energy by the year 2030.</p>

<p>The company revealed that it has purchased enough carbon credits to virtually cancel out all the carbon dioxide emissions it’s produced since its founding in 1998.</p>

<p>“The science is clear: The world must act now if we’re going to avert the worst consequences of climate change,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post. “We are committed to doing our part.”</p>

<p>While Google has been carbon neutral since 2007, that only means it’s offset its carbon footprint by investing in renewable energy.</p>

<p>In 2018 alone, Google released 4.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, The Verge reported, equal to about a million automobiles. </p>
