<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She's the self-proclaimed love coach who briefly appeared on Matty 'J' Johnson's season of The Bachelor.</p>

<p>And now Belinda 'Love' Rygier is eyeing a return to the spotlight as a relationship expert on the next season of Married At First Sight.'</p>

<p>The 37-year-old put her hand up for the gig after Dr Trisha Stratford announced her departure from the series on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Pick me! Former Bachelor star Belinda Rygier has put herself forward to replace relationship expert Dr Trisha Stratford on Married At First Sight</p>

<p>Commenting on Trisha's retirement post, Belinda wrote: 'Good luck Trisha, what a journey you've been on!'</p>

<p>She added: 'Not to be insensitive, if you are looking for someone to step in I'm available.'</p>

<p>Back in 2018, Belinda revealed that she had considered applying for MAFS as a bride, but had changed her mind after seeing Davina Rankin's cheating scandal with Dean Wells.</p>

<p>Commenting on Trisha's retirement post, Belinda wrote: 'Good luck Trisha, what a journey you've been on! Not to be insensitive, if you are looking for someone to step in I'm available'</p>

<p>In a blog post at the time, she wrote: 'After failing to find love on The Bachelor I considered applying for Married At First Sight myself as they do background and compatibility checks [and] someone is potentially going on there for love and I wouldn't have to get the whole hey wanna "netflix n chill" conversation. </p>

<p>'I totally understand that Davina is there for herself, she deserves love, we all do, but there is self-love and there is sheer lack of compassion, self-awareness and being mindful of other people's feelings, and that is where I draw the line,' she added. </p>

<p>Belinda recently hosted her own dating show on YouTube called Going Live For Love.</p>
