<p>In an interview with The Courier Mail on Monday, the 35-year-old former Olympic swimmer said she isn't nervous about baring her bits on TV. </p>

<p>'I'm actually really excited about stripping off. I'm not very backwards in coming forwards about that sort of stuff. It's not really a real issue for me,' she confessed.</p>

<p>The naked truth: She's set to strip off on Channel Seven's upcoming The All New Monty: Guys &amp; Gals, and Leisel Jones said she's 'actually really excited' about it</p>

<p>'I just remind myself every day, "No one cares what I look like, and if they do, that's their stuff, it's not mine." I don't need to worry about what other people's opinions are.</p>

<p>'As long as I'm living a good life, keeping my health up and doing the right thing by other people, then I can't complain.'</p>

<p>It's a refreshing outlook from the former athlete, after she previously admitted to suffering from body image issues.</p>

<p>Taking it all off: In an interview with The Courier Mail on Monday, the 35-year-old former Olympic swimmer said she isn't nervous about baring her bits on TV</p>

<p>In an interview with triple j in March 2016, the former breaststroke champion confessed she was convinced she was fat, even while swimming in the Olympics.</p>

<p>She revealed she even went on a 'soup diet' in the lead up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.</p>

<p>'I did a soup diet and didn't eat anything else other than soup and a bit of cereal,' she confessed. </p>

<p>Shocking: In an interview with triple j in March 2016, the former breaststroke champion confessed she was convinced she was fat, even while swimming in the Olympics. Pictured at the London Olympics in July in 2012</p>

<p>'That was certainly very silly. I was so desperate to drop weight I took it too far and became really obsessed about eating. You're trying to fuel an elite athlete and certainly living on soup isn't enough.'</p>

<p>Leisel said it wasn't until after she retired from swimming that she started to realise just how unhealthy her relationship with her body was.</p>

<p>'We weren't there to look amazing. They didn't hand out gold medals just because you look more of an athlete than someone else. I received gold medals and won gold medals because I was the best athlete there was,' she reflected.  </p>

<p>'I'm actually really excited about stripping off. I'm not very backwards in coming forwards about that sort of stuff. It's not really a real issue for me,' she confessed</p>
