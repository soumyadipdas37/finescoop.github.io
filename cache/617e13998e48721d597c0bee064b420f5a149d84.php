<p>Good American: Khloe Kardashian, 36, was back on the set for Good American on Saturday. The curvacious brunette teased a new athleisure set for her line as she posed in a stylish white outfit with an exaggerated braid </p>

<p>Standing against a white wall Khloe debuted an all white set that highlighted her killer curves. </p>

<p>She showed off her tiny waist in a white sports bra that delicately crossed in the front for added support and stylish detail. </p>

<p>The lace front detail of her leggings also made for an elevated athletic look, as if the set could be worn from day to night. </p>

<p>Responding to an inquiry from a fan about the set, Khloe confirmed that the set was from an upcoming GA collection and 'they haven't launched yet.' </p>

<p>Khloe and the rest of her stylish sisters practically live in athleisure looks, turning bike shorts into a fashion statement with a pair of heels and even rocking sweatpants to clubs. </p>

<p>Khloe's brown hair was slicked back with an exaggeratedly long braid as she rocked a pair of signature oversized hoops and a smokey eye for her day on set. </p>

<p>KUWTK: Two days after the premiere of KUWTK Season 19, Khloe was back on set for Good American with her glam squad </p>

<p>By her side was her trusty glam team, hairstylist Andrew Fitzsimmons and makeup artist Ash Holm who she held close. </p>

<p>She completed her look with a cropped white down jacket and captioned the image 'Get off my bacckkk' if you know then you know.'</p>

<p>The caption is a reference to a viral clip from the show Bigg Boss which has been circulating the internet recently.</p>

<p>Akin to the Indian version of reality show Big Brother, character Pooja has become a sort of meme of herself with outlandish behavior, most of her statements have become part of the expanding internet vernacular. </p>

<p>Sapphire: Khloe's scent for sister Kim's KKW Beauty line features a sapphire. The reality tv star turned designer revealed she wanted a beachy scent</p>

<p>While on set for her Good American shoot, Khloe took to her makeup artist's Instastory to promote the launch of the KKW fragrance line that features her and sister Kourtney. </p>

<p>The KKW Fragrance Diamonds that dropped one day ago - Friday September 18 - features a Sapphire fragrance to represent Khloe. </p>

<p>She shared that she wanted her fragrance to transport its users to the beach. </p>

<p>'When I think of what's most alluring to me, I always think of the peaceful ocean and warm sand, so you really see that come to life in my sapphire fragrance. One spritz and I'm on the beach' she said.  </p>

<p>Prank master: Khloe and Scott were back at it with new Kris Jenner pranks in episode one of the season 19 KUWTK premiere</p>

<p>After a nearly six month hiatus the new season of KUWTK premiered Thursday. </p>

<p>Troublemaking pair Khloe and Scott Disick capped off episode one in typical form - with new Kris Jenner pranks.</p>

<p>With an elaborate scheme that has been brewing since the past season, Khloe dresses up like her mother Kris and takes fake embarrassing paparazzi photos, even climbing into a dumpster at one point.  </p>

<p>The mother to True, two, Khloe's humor has been a real point of light for many fans of the show who have since grown bored with the same overdone menial drama and salad shaking.  </p>

<p>Fan love: Upon the news that KUWTK would end after season 20, Khloe took to Twitter to thank her fans</p>

<p>Upon the news that KUWTK would end after season 20, Khloe took to Twitter to thank her fans.</p>

<p>'I love you guys so much!!! Thank you for everything!!! The emotions are overflowing today. change is tough but sometimes needed. I can't express how much I love and appreciate you guys', she told her 28.4M followers. </p>

<p>Though many look at the show's end as the closing of an era, Khloe and her family have made themselves a household name, all having their hands in a lot of businesses. </p>

<p>Despite it being a point of nostalgia for the family - as the show was the family's jumping off point for success - all members of the KarJenner clan have now made a name for themselves in other ways. </p>

<p>The final season of KUWTK will air in 2021 on E!.</p>

<p>Beach: Khloe's love for the beach is evident as she channeled the feeling of warm sand and the peaceful ocean into her Sapphire fragrance for KKW Beauty. The scent launched Friday; pictured on Labor Day Weekend </p>
