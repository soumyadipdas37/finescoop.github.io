<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A female prison guard penned secret love letters to a high risk inmate describing how she was falling for him and would smuggle in contraband if she knew how.</p>

<p>Ruby Talaisaina Burgess, 33, from Miller, pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in an intimate relationship with an inmate at Blacktown Local Court on Monday. </p>

<p>The court heard Burgess formed a relationship with John Hytongue, 37, in December last year while she was employed at Parklea Correctional Centre, in Sydney's north west.  </p>

<p>Ruby Talaisaina Burgess (pictured), 33, from Miller, had an three-month intimate relationship with John Hytongue, 37, at Parklea Jail from December 2019 until February this year</p>

<p>Three months later, Corrective Services Investigators raided Hytongue's cell and discovered a letter intended for Burgess after being tipped off about the affair.  </p>

<p>A subsequent scan of CCTV footage uncovered private encounters the pair had inside the prison, while a second search on Burgess' car unearthed more letters detailing their relationship.  </p>

<p>She has been placed on a Conditional Release Order with conviction and a good behaviour bond for 12 months. </p>

<p>In notes found on Burgess, she confronted Hytongue over his motive for their relationship after he asked the correctional officer to sneak cigarettes into the jail.  </p>

<p>'So in other word (sic), you were using me?' Burgess wrote, the Daily Telegraph reports. </p>

<p>'As much as I want to, I wouldn’t know how.'</p>

<p>He replied: 'If your [sic] feeling used, your [sic] wrong. Please don’t think that. I’m a, well use [sic] to be, a heavy smoker. I couldn’t help to (sic) cross my mind XOXO. Refill your panties'.  </p>

<p>Burgess pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in an relationship with an inmate on Monday and was placed on a Conditional Release Order with conviction and a good behaviour bond for 12 months. She is pictured at a previous hearing</p>

<p>Security footage showed Burgess and Hytongue spending just over a minute alone in a store room without surveillance, and the guard speaking to the maximum-security prisoner through his cell. </p>

<p>Burgess told the court she regretted her behaviour and was experiencing low-self esteem at the time after coming out of an unhealthy relationship.  </p>

<p>In response to the defence's argument, Magistrate Fiona McCarron accepted their was no evidence the relationship had been sexual. </p>

<p>The prosecution said Burgess's actions, irrespective of the extent of the relationship, placed other security officers and prisoners at risk.  </p>
