<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A review of Parliament's art collection should not be 'overwhelmed by wokeism', Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has said.</p>

<p>Former prime ministers including William Gladstone, Robert Peel and Lord Liverpool could soon be accompanied by plaques detailing their links to slavery after a review was prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement. </p>

<p>More than 230 works of art in the Parliamentary art collection have been found to have links to the transatlantic slave trade, while 189 of the pieces listed in the study by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art depict 24 people who had ties to the slave trade. Forty pieces depict 14 people who were abolitionists.</p>

<p>Among those listed as having 'financial or family interests in the slave trade' are prime ministers Robert Peel, who served two terms between 1834-35 and 1841-1846, Lord Liverpool, who served from 1812-1827, and William Gladstone, who served as prime minister for 12 years over four terms between 1868 and 1894.</p>

<p>Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art that a review of Parliament's art collection should not be 'overwhelmed by wokeism', and they should 'take pride in the history' displayed through the art</p>

<p>Conservative MP Richard Holden (pictured above in the House of Commons) also questioned whether the parliamentary authorities were 'bending the knee' to a 'woke political agenda'</p>

<p>The inclusion of all three in the Parliamentary review is likely to stir debate, though, as Peel, the son of a cotton trader, campaigned for the abolition of slavery, while both Lord Liverpool and Gladstone's views evolved over time.  </p>

<p>The art linked to slavery makes up 2.4 per cent of the Parliamentary collection which features more than 9,500 works in total.</p>

<p>On Thursday Conservative MP Joy Morrissey urged the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art not to 'edit, rewrite and impose woke contemporary interpretations of history' on the works of art, many of which date back to the 1840s when the newly rebuilt Palace of Westminster was opened.</p>

<p>The committee, established in 1954, is a cross-party group of MPs, appointed by the Commons Speaker, to advise on the use and management of the Parliamentary Art Collection.</p>

<p>Conservative MP Richard Holden later said the parliamentary authorities were 'bending the knee' to a 'woke political agenda', an apparent reference to the symbol of protest adopted by American sports stars against racism in the US.</p>

<p>The artwork linked to slavery features former MPs Sir Robert Peel (left) and William Beckford (right) among many others. The first Sir Robert Peel opposed abolition because he saw it as a threat to his fortune in the cotton industry trade. His son (the one pictured, left) was a prime minister of the same name and founded the Metropolitan Police</p>

<p>Portraits of former MPs Henry Dundas (left), who was instrumental in deferring the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade until 1807, and William Ewart Gladstone (right), whose family had plantations in the Caribbean, feature in the art collection</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel MP: The first Sir Robert Peel opposed abolition because he saw it as a threat to his fortune in the cotton industry trade. His son was a prime minister of the same name and founded the Metropolitan Police.</p>

<p>William Ewart Gladstone MP: Liberal politician spoke out against abolition in Parliament because his family had slaves on plantations in the Caribbean</p>

<p>John Gladstone MP (father): Businessman was one of the largest slave owners in the British West Indies and had huge estates in Jamaica and British Guyana</p>

<p>Thomas Gladstone MP (brother): The Tory MP regularly provided his father with intelligence about the political manoeuvrings of abolitionists in Parliament</p>

<p>Henry Dundas MP: The home secretary and war secretary was instrumental in deferring the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade until 1807</p>

<p>William Beckford MP: Owned property in Jamaica including 22,000 acres of sugar plantations and about 3,000 slaves, and formed a powerful pro-slavery lobby</p>

<p>Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood: The merchant and his brothers imported slaves from west Africa to work on their plantations in Barbados</p>

<p>George Stevens Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford: The Whig politician owned 159 slaves in Jamaica but failed in a bid for compensation after slavery was abolished</p>

<p>Edward Ellice MP: The co-owner of eight sugar estates in the West Indies received £35,000 in compensation when his 300 slaves were freed</p>

<p>Henry Goulburn MP: Managed estates in Jamaica through agents because he could not visit due to ill health, and owned 277 slaves at the time of abolition</p>

<p>William Alexander Mackinnon MP: The Tory MP was involved in the in slave trade in Antigua where he is thought to have owned more than 200 slaves</p>

<p>Mr Holden said: 'We all want to see the very best of Britain showcased in this Parliament and the context of historical pieces.</p>

<p>'However, does (Mr Rees-Mogg) agree with me that at this time of the global coronavirus pandemic, Parliament can do better than following a panicked Labour-led Durham County Council in bending the knee to a woke political agenda?'</p>

<p>Responding during business questions, Mr Rees-Mogg quoted William Shakespeare's Richard II and told the Commons: 'No, we should most certainly not be overwhelmed by wokeism.' </p>

<p>He added: 'We should take such pride in the history that is displayed through the art in this House.</p>

<p>'It may be a slightly Whiggish view of history, but you go into committee room 10 and there is Alfred the Great defeating the Danes - starting our great island story.</p>

<p>'As you walk from here (the Commons) to the House of Lords, you see on the walls the whole process of the Civil War.</p>

<p>'It is something that we should be proud of, for we are a great nation, a successful nation, one of the greatest nations this world has ever seen.</p>

<p>'And we have done so much good not just at home but abroad, and we should be proud of that and we should recognise that how we have recorded our history, how forefathers have done, is something that we should not dispose of.'</p>

<p>The Oxford English Dictionary website defines the term woke as someone who is 'alert to injustice in society, especially racism' and has gained prominence in recent years, partly due to the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

<p>The committee said its list of artworks under review relates to the transatlantic slave trade, including works depicting both people who had financial or family interests in the transatlantic slave trade and slavery, as well as artwork featuring abolitionists.</p>

<p>A spokesman said: 'The list has been developed through crosschecking pieces in the collection with rigorous academic research which has identified people known to have been involved in the transatlantic slave trade.</p>

<p>'The list is not comprehensive and the documents will be updated as research continues. Data and resources on the representation of ethnic diversity in the Parliamentary Art Collection has also been gathered.'</p>

<p>The committee also said it is trying to broaden the diversity and inclusion of its collection in line with how museums, art galleries and other large collections have responded to the demonstrations in recent months.</p>

<p>The British became involved in the transatlantic slave trade in 1562, and the country was the world's biggest slave-trading nation by the 1730s.</p>

<p>The abolition movement helped lead to the end of the trade in 1807 and then the use of enslaved labour in British colonies in 1833.</p>

<p>However, many British people including politicians continued to have direct financial gain from the trading and use of enslaved labour in the West Indies, America, India and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The committee has said the intention of the Parliamentary art collection is 'not to venerate people who have supported and committed acts of atrocity, but to truthfully reflect the history of Parliament, our democracy and the people who played a part in it'.</p>

<p>The Black Lives Matter movement was sparked by the killing of black man George Floyd in the US after he was arrested by police and an officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Protesters in Bristol tore down a statue of Edward Colston on June 7, on the same day a memorial to Winston Churchill in London was defaced with the words 'was a racist' written on a plinth underneath.</p>

<p>It prompted a wave of statues being targeted with graffiti or being attacked during protests, culminating in some statues, including ones of Nelson Mandela and Churchill, being covered up to be protected from vandals.</p>

<p>The Topple the Racists campaign launched a comprehensive list of statues it wanted to see removed as it believed the names behind the monuments held racist beliefs.</p>

<p>It led to Oriel College at Oxford University voting to remove a statue of Cecil Rhodes, a colonialist politician in southern Africa in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in June: 'We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations.</p>

<p>'They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.'</p>
