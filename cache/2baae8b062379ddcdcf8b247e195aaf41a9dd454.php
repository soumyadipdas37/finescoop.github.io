<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>For all its frustrations and difficulties, lockdown had some silver linings. </p>

<p>Simply being able to avoid crammed commutes was the biggest for many, while for others it was the opportunity to try new hobbies: watercolour painting, gardening or learning a language, perhaps.</p>

<p>Now restrictions have eased, we can take these skills on holiday — or even acquire new ones while we’re away. Here’s our pick of some of the most tempting breaks...</p>

<p>GREEK CANVAS</p>

<p>Something new: Learn to paint on Greece’s beautiful Pelion peninsula, known for its fragrant wildflowers and rambling olive groves</p>

<p>Newly inspired artists might consider a seven-night course offered by the Greek artist Maggie Niagassas, who specialises in botanical subjects. You’ll be based on Greece’s beautiful Pelion peninsula, known for its fragrant wildflowers and rambling olive groves — which you’ll explore on guided walks designed to feed your imagination.</p>

<p>Daily classes at your accommodation — the Lagou Raxi Country Hotel in Lafkos — provide ample opportunity to improve your painting and drawing techniques.</p>

<p>HONEY, I’M ON HOLIDAY!</p>

<p>Learn about various aspects of beekeeping, including how to handle the insects and set up your own hive in Carmarthenshire</p>

<p>Bees and bubbles may sound like an unusual combination, but that’s exactly what’s in store if you sign up for this beekeeping course in Carmarthenshire, which is based at a vineyard famous for its sparkling wine.</p>

<p>You’ll learn about various aspects of beekeeping, from how to handle the insects and set up your own hive to various blunders to avoid.</p>

<p>FINNISH FISHING</p>

<p>Fly fishing requires fortitude and patience — and, let’s face it, we’ve had plenty of time to work on both. Those who have taken up the sport during lockdown can learn more on a fly fishing course in Finland with Wild Taiga, in the thickly forested borderlands near Russia.</p>

<p>There are several courses, but our favourite is in Kuhmo, known as the ‘town of one hundred rapids’ because of the fish-filled river that thunders through it. An experienced guide is on hand for tuition, and local saunas beckon after a long day on the river.</p>

<p>The Caribbean is home to some of the world’s rarest birds, including the purple-throated carib (pictured) and sisserou parrot</p>

<p>Sales of bird boxes have gone through the roof — which is hardly surprising, given that even our most common feathered friends have gained a whole new appeal when the only view we have is that of the garden.</p>

<p>If self-isolation made you a birder, how about a Caribbean birdwatching adventure, taking in Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica and St Lucia?</p>

<p>The islands are home to some of the world’s rarest birds, including the Lesser Antillean flycatcher, purple-throated carib and sisserou parrot. The last of these can be found only in Dominica, and even appears on the country’s flag.</p>
