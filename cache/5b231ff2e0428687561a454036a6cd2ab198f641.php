<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will speak to Mason Greenwood about his private life after the Manchester United striker landed himself in trouble for the second time in a week.</p>

<p>Greenwood, 18, was seen inhaling nitrous oxide — known as hippy crack — in a video filmed in a Manchester apartment several weeks ago.</p>

<p>Greenwood issued a statement through United on Saturday after the film emerged on social media of him inhaling from a balloon in the company of a female friend.</p>

<p>Mason Greenwood heads into the new season following a couple of off-field incidents</p>

<p>The striker was sent home by England boss Gareth Southgate (right) after inviting two women back to his hotel while in the company of international team-mate Phil Foden</p>

<p>He said: ‘I have now been made aware of the health risks associated with this practice — and accept that even trying it, as shown in these historical pictures, was poor judgment on my part.</p>

<p>I strongly urge others not to follow my example.’ Last week, Greenwood and England team-mate Phil Foden were sent home in disgrace by manager Gareth Southgate for inviting two women into the team hotel after making their senior international debuts in Iceland.</p>

<p>And a concerned Solskjaer will speak to him about his off-the-field behaviour. While the United boss is committed to supporting Greenwood through the first controversies of his fledgling career, the player is expected to be reminded of his responsibilities and told to steer clear of trouble.</p>

<p>Greenwood had to train alone on Friday while undergoing a Covid risk assessment. He should return to full training, but it is unclear if he will be picked for Saturday’s Premier League opener at home to Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is now keen to speak to the 18-year-old about his behaviour</p>
