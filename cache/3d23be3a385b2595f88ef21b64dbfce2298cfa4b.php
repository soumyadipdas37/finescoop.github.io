<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Another elite Sydney private school has been caught up in a muck-up day 'scavenger hunt' scandal.  </p>

<p>Girls from Monte Sant' Angelo Mercy College in North Sydney filmed themselves drinking vodka out of a shoe, kissing strangers, licking car tires and jumping into a World War I memorial fountain, as part of their a graduation 'scavenger hunt'.</p>

<p>The videos were uploaded to the social media platform TikTok under the hashtags 'scavhunt' and 'classof2020'. </p>

<p>It comes just days after Shore School for boys and Pymble Ladies' College went into damage control after documents detailing their muck-up day scavenger hunt was leaked. </p>

<p>A document obtained by 7News outlines how participants from the $23,640 a year Catholic school can receive points for completing embarrassing dares.</p>

<p>'Doing a poo' in a public pool, drinking 'seven shots' of alcohol in seven minutes and wetting yourself in a supermarket aisle is worth 200 points, under the scavenger hunt's rules.</p>

<p>While anyone who gets a tattoo with their ex-partner's name receives 800 points. </p>

<p>Other challenges also included 'catching an ibis' and 'seducing a classmate's dad'.</p>

<p>It is not known whether the more extreme challenges were actually carried out by any students. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for Monte Sant' Angelo Mercy College said they're investigating the matter and take 'this sort of behaviour very seriously'. </p>

<p>Although the dares have caused controversy, they pale in comparison to the challenges uncovered in the Shore School's 'Triwizard Shorenament' manifesto. </p>

<p>Some of the scavenger hunt tasks laid out for school leavers included hitting stranger's genitals, spitting on homeless people and kissing underage girls.  </p>

<p>Pymble Ladies' College, also on Sydney's North Shore, made headlines this week with its list of muck-up day challenges.</p>

<p>Like the aforementioned schools, the leaked document appeared to encourage the girls to perform varying levels of sex acts and embarrassing dares to score points for their team. </p>

<p>Students from elite private boys' school Shore, in Sydney's lower north shore, also attempted to complete a controversial challenge named the 'Triwizard Shorenament' (pictured)</p>

<p>The school is among the top ranked in New South Wales and regularly features impressive Year 12 results</p>

<p>The list included 'eat someone else's vomit', 'get arrested' and 'have sex in a public bathroom.'</p>

<p>Other challenges involved 'streaking across the Pacific Highway' and 'blindfold boyfriend guess whose t*** are who for everyone in the team'.</p>

<p>The unladylike list also asked students to 'order a stripper and enjoy his/her presence', 'get with someone's brother' and 'go into a brothel and ask for a job'. </p>

<p>The 'God tier' level of challenges included 'ring parent and explain in depth how you lost your virginity' and 'meet up with someone' from LGBTQ dating app Grindr.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from Pymble Ladies' College said muck-up day activities were against school policy and students had been warned of the consequences.</p>

<p>'We are horrified and disappointed that any student would have their name associated with what was apparently a competitive list between students at a number of schools,' the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The 'Scavenger Hunt' required girls to divide into teams and perform a variety of sexual and illegal acts in order to score points (Pymble Ladies' College pictured)</p>
