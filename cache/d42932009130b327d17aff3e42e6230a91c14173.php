<p>Katherine is featured in a variety of hilarious and embarrassing situations, including confrontations at the school gates and discussing sex with her boyfriend in front of a delivery driver.</p>

<p>Another hilarious scene in the comedy sees Katherine visit a fertility doctor who questions why she would need to use a sperm donor to which she responds 'all of my family are dead... to me'.</p>

<p>She is then loudly offended when the doctor suggests she use a young man's profile to help with her 'geriatric pregnancy'.</p>

<p>Further into the drama, Katherine is also seen struggling to come to terms with her failed musician ex's new girlfriend insisting on being part of Olive's life.</p>

<p>Not one for being conventional, Katherine also spends time taking her daughter on nights out and to the pub as she tries to raise her as best she can.</p>

<p>The drama was also praised for its comedic scenes, with some viewers admitting the already wanted a season two to occur (pictured)</p>

<p>The sitcom is loosely based on the comedian's own life as a mother-of-one who raised her daughter Violet, 11, in London, when they moved to the UK from Canada.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Radio Times about the new show in August, Katherine said: 'I've never written a sitcom so that makes it very different (from my previous Netflix specials).</p>

<p>'It was a challenge, because I'm not a screenwriter who's experienced, I don't know the rules, I'm learning the rules.</p>

<p>'The Duchess is super authentic I think to my personality, to my stage persona, because it's a disruptive mum who's a bad person but a good mum.</p>

<p>'She's fashionable, she loves being a mother she's not sad about it — it's me, yes. The rest is fiction, but it is a heightened version of me, and I'm really lucky because they're just letting me go and write the real thing that I would have wanted to.</p>
