<p>Katie Holmes' new boytoy has been branded a 'cheater' who was engaged to be married and callously dumped his fiancée Rachel Emmons (pictured announcing their engagement last year) by text after pictures emerged of him canoodling with Holmes outside a New York restaurant, DailyMail.com can reveal</p>

<p>According to a friend who asked not to be named: 'Up to this press coming out Rachel had no idea what was going on. He is a cheater, and this isn't a ''happy ending'' story' </p>

<p>DailyMail.com published exclusive images of Holmes getting handsy with her new squeeze restaurateur, chef and aspiring actor, Emilio Vitolo Jr (pictured together on Tuesday). Now DailyMail.com can reveal that for Emmon, they were further painful proof of the relationship that first came to public attention last week and the devastating end of her engagement</p>

<p>Rumors that Holmes, who at 41 is almost ten years Vitolo's senior, and the chef were romantically involved were first sparked when the pair were spotted outside the restaurant Peasant in New York last week.</p>

<p>But, according to the friend, Emmons believed that she was getting married to Vitolo until his romance with Holmes ended that.</p>

<p>The friend said, 'They had concrete wedding plans in the works…now she is just left with bad press and forced to move home.'</p>

<p>DailyMail.com understands that Vitolo texted Emmons the day the pictures were published, perhaps aware that his relationship with Holmes was about to be blown wide open.</p>

<p>Vitolo's father is the owner of celebrity favorite Emilio's Ballato in New York's Nolita district. He works as a chef there alongside his brother Antony, 29, and has often been pictured with the restaurant's famous frequenters.</p>

<p>In other posts she happily pictures bridal gowns and the couple introduce their puppy Frank (pictured). Last August Emmons posted: 'You are my favorite part of life and I will love you forever'</p>

<p>Emmons, a designer who founded Anna Rachel Studio, had been dating Vitolo for more than two years and the couple announced their engagement unofficially via Instagram last year</p>

<p>Among them are Barack and Malia Obama, Danny DeVito, friend Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, Bella Hadid and David Schwimmer.</p>

<p>His social media is a catalogue of photographs of him with famous faces.</p>

<p>In stark contrast Emmons' Instagram was, until recently, a far more personal affair filled with sweet pictures of her and Vitolo together and protestations of love.</p>

<p>In fact, there is nothing in any of the many posts to suggest any hint of trouble in the romance with the last picture of the apparently happy couple appearing on July 27.</p>

<p>According to the friend who reached out to DailyMail.com on Emmons’ behalf and on condition of anonymity the fall-out of the revelation that Holmes and Vitolo Jr are together has left Emmons 'traumatized' as her world has been pulled out from under her.</p>

<p>DailyMail.com reached out to Emmons who declined to comment.</p>
