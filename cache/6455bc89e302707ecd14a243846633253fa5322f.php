<p>King was found laying naked in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, after being shot in the chest</p>

<p>The harrowing incident began unfolding at around 1pm near 18th and Forster streets in the usually quiet Allison Hill section of Harrisburg, where residents were shocked to see a naked teen running down the street, with an armed man in an orange shirt pursuing him on foot.</p>

<p>Witnesses reported that the suspect, later identified as Duarte, fired several shots at King, who was heard crying for help.</p>

<p>King told a witness he had been raped by a man who was now trying to kill him</p>

<p>Tracy Burton, who called 911 to report the shooting, said she heard King repeatedly yelling, 'help me,' which was followed by the sound of gunfire, reported The Morning Call.</p>

<p>King was found laying on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest. He was rushed to a hospital, where he died of his injuries.</p>

<p>Duarte fled the scene but was captured by responding officers two blocks away after a brief chase.</p>

<p>He reportedly told investigators he thought King was 18 years old.</p>

<p>Sergeant Kyle Gautsch, with the Harrisburg Police Department, said Duarte and King knew each other.</p>

<p>'Our understanding, this wasn't just a happenstance incident where he was pulled off the street. We are under the impression and understanding that they did know each other. They were acquaintances,' Gautsch said during a press conference.</p>

<p>When police went to search Duarte's apartment on North 17th Street, they reportedly found a note written by King that read, 'If you're reading this I'm dead,' according to PennLive.com.</p>

<p>Police also found a pair of sandals, which they said were placed by the back door as if someone had run out of them.</p>

<p>King's family held a memorial in his honor just hours after his killing on Saturday </p>

<p>Duarte had no legal right to own a firearm because he is a register sex offender in the Megan's Law database stemming from his 2012 conviction on charges of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a child, aggravated indecent assault of a child, aggravated indecent assault without consent, indecent assault of a person less than 13, unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of minors.</p>

<p>Duarte has a prior criminal record that includes two sexual assault cases involving children</p>

<p>In that case, Duarte was found guilty of repeatedly sexually assaulting a girl under the age of nine.</p>

<p>He was released from prison in May 2018 after serving six years.</p>

<p>Duarte's criminal record also includes prior charges related to a 2007 sexual assault of a seven-year-old boy.</p>

<p>Duarte was sentenced to six to 23 months of confinement and probation after pleading no contest to multiple counts.</p>

<p>He is due back in court on September 28. If convicted as charged in connection to King's killing, he could face life in prison.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the victim's family held a memorial in his honor on Saturday, remembering King as smart and sweet, with a loud laugh, reported ABC27.</p>

<p>'We all loved Ky Ky we love him a lot,' his older sister Nyairrea Jones said. 'My little brother. Everything about him. I miss it all.'</p>
