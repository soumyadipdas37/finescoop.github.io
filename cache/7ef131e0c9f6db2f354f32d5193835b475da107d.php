<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Earlier this week, Boris Johnson was pictured with a hunky personal trainer as it was revealed the Prime Minster enlisted the help of Harry Jameson to help shed the pounds.</p>

<p>Johnson, 56,  was snapped running near Westminster in central London on Wednesday with the trainer to the stars.</p>

<p>And the sight of a Prime Minster running with a famous fitness expert will be a familiar to some, who may recall David Cameron, 53,  signing up to the services of Matt Roberts during his 2010 - 2016 premiership. </p>

<p>Now Matt, whose clients include Mel C,  Amanda Holden, Tom Ford and John Galliano revealed what it's really like to train a Prime Minster, telling the Telegraph that sessions were built around the former Tory leader's exhaustion and stress.   </p>

<p>David Cameron's former personal trainer Matt Roberts has revealed what it is like to work out with the leader of the country (They are pictured in 2011 running in St James Park together)</p>

<p>His comments come after Boris Johnson, 56, was snapped running near Westminster in central London on Wednesday with the trainer to the stars Harry Jameson</p>

<p>He said: 'Any Prime Minister has to deal with extremely long days, which start very early, and there's never a let up. </p>

<p>'What you don't want to do is make them more exhausted. It's a case of damage limitation.'</p>

<p>Matt added that part of his training is focusing on getting to grips with an individual.</p>

<p>'If someone's trying to survive political power, my focus is on making sure that person is looked after and kept phenomenally well and healthy,' he explained.</p>

<p>Matt, whose clients include Mel C, Amanda Holden, Tom Ford and John Galliano revealed Cameron was 'just a body, not a celebrity' adding that they planned his sessions around the former Tory leader's exhaustion and stress. They are pictured together in 2012 in London</p>

<p>Cameron also played tennis as a way to 'unwind and feel healthy and well again' after a day of campaigning. </p>

<p>The personal trainer added that Cameron played particularly well shortly after the 2015 general election when he won 330 Conservative seats after previously relying on the Liberal Democrats to prop up the government in the coalition. </p>

<p>Despite saying he treated the ex-MP no differently to any other client, Matt did reveal Cameron's security team would run with them. </p>

<p>He said there are 'protocols' which clients like Cameron or Johnson face when exercising outside and said trainers who work with politicians are 'briefed'.</p>

<p>Despite saying he treated the ex-MP no differently to any other client, Matt did reveal Cameron's security team would run with them. Cameron is pictured here running in December 2010 in Horse Guards Parade</p>

<p>He added that security teams are 'great fun' but 'very vigilant.'  </p>

<p>Matt said the team usually enjoyed the chance to work out alongside the job because they were often required to be extremely fit in their own role.   </p>

<p>Johnson's trainer, who describes himself as an 'elite performance coach', has been revealed as the son of Doctor Who actress Louise Jameson, who played the character of Leela in the BBC show, companion to Tom Baker's Doctor. </p>

<p>On his website, he says he works on physical and nutritional health and mental wellbeing 'through mindfulness, meditation and stress management, as well as leadership and goal setting for senior teams'.  </p>

<p>Johnson's personal trainer is the son of Doctor Who actress Louise Jameson, who played the character of Leela (right) in the BBC show, companion to Tom Baker's Doctor. She also played Rosa di Marco on EastEnders for more than 200 episodes</p>

<p>It is unclear what programme the Prime Minister will follow with Mr Jameson, though the trainer touts a four week 'body blitz' for men. </p>

<p>Week one -  push ups, mountain climbers, jumping squats and clap crunches. </p>

<p>Exercise non-stop for 30 seconds with a minutes rest between each exercise. </p>

<p>Perform each exercise three times </p>

<p>Week two -  superman press ups, mountain climbers, jumping squats and bicycle crunches.</p>

<p>Week three -  dumbbell burpees, squat push-press, reverse lunges while holding dumbbells and Russian twists.</p>

<p>Week four -  burpee press ups, squat curl and press, dumbbell swing and crunch press.</p>

<p>His website reads: 'No gym needed. No excuses. Invest in a workout mat, two dumb bells and train from anywhere, at any time. </p>

<p>'Each week will be more challenging than the last, recruiting new muscle groups to ensure you get that full body tone. </p>

<p>'Follow this program for the next four weeks to see the maximal effect and for best results train 5 times a week. Finally, eat a solid diet and get at least 8 hours of sleep every night.' </p>

<p>If Mr Johnson follows the plan, he would have to do push ups, mountain climbers, jumping squats and clap crunches in week one.</p>

<p> He would have to do each exercise non-stop for 30 seconds with a minutes rest in between before doing the exercises three times each. </p>

<p>In week two, he'd have to do superman press ups, mountain climbers, jumping squats and bicycle crunches. </p>

<p>Week three would include dumbbell burpees, squat push-press, reverse lunges while holding dumbbells and Russian twists. </p>

<p>Finally, week four includes burpee press ups, squat curl and press, dumbbell swing and crunch press.</p>

<p>It is unclear if Mr Johnson is following the intensive plan, though a Number 10 source confirmed he had hired Mr Jameson.</p>

<p>They told the Evening Standard: 'Yes, he has engaged a personal trainer. I can confirm it is Harry Jameson. It's because he is really serious about getting fit, as anyone who has seen him over the past couple of months knows. Boris is raring to go.'</p>

<p>It comes as the prime minister insisted he was fighting fit after Dominic Cummings' father-in-law suggested he was planning to quit within six months after struggling to recover from the virus.</p>
