<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An engineer who helped develop Sir Richard Dyson's electric car has won a religious discrimination and unfair dismissal claim against the company after her manager told her 'I don't like Muslims'.</p>

<p>Zeinab Alipourbabaie, 39, told an employment tribunal that senior technical project manager Kamaljit Chana also said: 'Muslims are violent' and 'Pakistani men are grooming our girls.'</p>

<p>Ms Alipourbabaie worked at Dydon in Wiltshire for four years but resigned in 2018 after months of harassment and discrimination by Mr Chana, according to the Times. </p>

<p>Zeinab Alipourbabaie (left) told a tribunal that senior technical project manager Kamaljit Chana (right) also said: 'Muslims are violent' and 'Pakistani men are grooming our girls.'</p>

<p>Mr Chana, who is Sikh and also a Conservative councillor in Harrow, northwest London, denied making the comments but a tribunal found Ms Aliporbabaie's account of the one-to-one meeting 'compelling and persuasive'.</p>

<p> In the tribunal's judgement, it said: 'He asked if she was a Muslim and she replied that she came from a Muslim family [...] he said 'that he did not like Muslims'.'</p>

<p>The judgement went on to describe how Mr Chana also talked about 9/11 and that Pakistani men 'are grooming our girls'.</p>

<p>The court also heard Mr Chana excluded Ms Alipourbabaei from meetings and emails and advised against promoting her. </p>

<p>The court found that Iranian national Ms Alipourbabaie's resignation amounted to constructive unfair dismissal.</p>

<p>Mr Chana was handed a final written warning but kept his job at Dyson after an internal investigation also found he had bullied and harassed Ms Alipourbabaie.</p>

<p>Dyson told the Times: 'It said: 'These allegations were investigated fully and disciplinary action was taken against Kamaljit Chana who was found to have acted inappropriately.</p>

<p>British billionaire Sir James Dyson said his electric car was cancelled for being ‘too risky’</p>

<p>'We have since launched mandatory 'respect' training for all our people.' </p>

<p>Earlier this year, British billionaire Sir James Dyson said his company’s electric car was cancelled for being ‘too risky’.</p>

<p>The aborted ‘N526’ Dyson electric car, which Dyson piled £500 million of his own money into before pulling the plug, was a 16-foot-long seven-seater, electric SUV.</p>

<p>The 2.6 tonne-vehicle featured an aluminium body, quiet-running tyres and quick-charging battery cells that would have provided enough power to drive 600 miles on a single charge.</p>
