<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Glover is now a father three times over.</p>

<p>The Atlanta star revealed in a British GQ interview published Tuesday that he and his girlfriend Michelle White had welcomed their third child months ago amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>New baby: Donald Glover, 37, revealed that he welcomed his third child amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic while interview Michaela Coel for British GQ; shown in November 2019</p>

<p>'I had [a kid] during the coronavirus,' Glover admitted. </p>

<p>'It was nuts. I was in the hospital bed. My son had just been born, like, an hour before, and I was watching the George Floyd video.'</p>

<p>Though the Community star didn't specify when he son was born, Floyd was killed by a white police officer on May 25, so his son may have arrived in late May or June.</p>

<p>'It was such a weird moment. It was such an intense, weird moment, because I’m watching that video and it’s, like, eight minutes long, so you’re sitting there and I had just had this amazing, joyful, expanding moment, plus my dad had passed away recently, so [my son] was named after my father.'</p>

<p>Glover had also been named after his father, Donald McKinley Glover Sr., who died in 2018.</p>

<p>Strange pairing: Glover said he watched the video of George Floyd being killed by a white police officer shortly after his girlfriend Michelle White gave birth; shown in October 2019</p>

<p>Growing family: Glover shares his three kids with his partner Michelle. The two welcomed their first son Legend, three, in 2016, followed by Drake, two, in 2018; shown in May 2018</p>

<p>'I don’t even know what, really, the word is to describe it,' the stand-up comedian continued. 'It was just expanding: the empathy and compassion and the terror and the joy of it.'</p>

<p>He complimented her for the latter series, which aired on HBO in June and July. </p>

<p>'I guess the biggest compliment I can give [the show] is this: it made me feel super inspired. And [before], I was not feeling very inspired. It really broke me out of feeling that everything’s the same. Your show is such a good feeling, and flavor,' he said.</p>

<p>Last year, Glover voiced Simba in the mostly computer-generated remake of The Lion King, which also starred Beyoncé.</p>

<p>Earlier that year, he starred in the musical Guava Island opposite Rihanna, which was directed by his regular Atlanta collaborator Hiro Murai.</p>
