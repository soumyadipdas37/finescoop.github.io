<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The brave father who was injured while protecting his three young children when a gunman opened fire at a New York City car dealership has raised more than $270,000 in donations and his children could receive free therapy.</p>

<p>Last week, Anthony Jefferson took a bullet in the thigh when he dove atop his children to shield them from gunfire that broke out at On The Road Automotive in the Bronx.</p>

<p>He was at the dealership that evening shopping for a vehicle to surprise his wife, Danica Jefferson, for her birthday. </p>

<p>Jefferson has since lost two jobs over his injuries and all three children are 'traumatized' from the horrific event, but thousands of Good Samaritans have helped in a big way.</p>

<p>In just three days, a GoFundMe created to help cover mounting medical bills and enroll the children in therapy has skyrocketed from $8,400 to $277,855 in donations.</p>

<p>A GoFundMe for the Jefferson family has raised more than $277,000 in under a week after news spread of Anthony's heroic efforts</p>

<p>Terrifying video captured the moment Anthony Jefferson (pictured) was shot in the leg as he shielded his three young children from a gunman who opened fire at a car dealership in the Bronx on Monday</p>

<p>Donations continued to roll in by the minute on Monday morning with $50 and $100 donations. </p>

<p>The largest donation came Sunday from an anonymous altruist who gave $25,000 to the Jefferson family. Other big gifts included a handful of $2,000 and $1,000 contributions.</p>

<p>Around 8,100 kindhearted people have donated and many left encouraging messages.</p>

<p>'This is every parents worst nightmare and ultimate sacrifice. This man has brought honor to his family and courage to my heart,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'My dearest wish is that his children recover from this traumatizing experience and that the fear in their hearts is replaced with the same courageous spirit of their father. It is my honor to provide what little I have for such a courageous hero and his noble actions.' </p>

<p>Last week, Danica told TMZ that Anthony cannot walk at the moment because of his sustained injuries from the shooting.</p>

<p>The dad and his children were sitting on a couch inside the used car shop when a man in a black hoodie (circled) ran up and began firing through an open glass door</p>

<p>Subsequently, he's been fired from his jobs as head painter for a maintenance company and as a construction worker in the city.</p>

<p>And although he's begun recovery, Danica said Anthony will need to undergo surgery soon because the bullet is still lodged inside his leg.</p>

<p>She added at the time that their children, aged six, five, and two, have become distressed over the ordeal.</p>

<p>She said that the small children are hesitant to go outside the home, cry in their sleep and the two-year-old has asked: 'Why did the man shoot my daddy?' </p>

<p>A photo shared to a GoFundMe showed where a bullet struck one of Anthony's shoes on Monday</p>

<p>Now, a therapist has offered to work with Jefferson's three children through free counseling.  </p>

<p>Dr. Raha Didevar of Big HeArts Interventions told TMZ that she would be willing to work with the children in therapy once a week pro bono. </p>

<p>The sessions, done over Zoom video conferencing, could last up to a year or more. TMZ reports that all the Jefferson's have to do is reach out.</p>

<p>Terrifying video captured the entire incident that took place at around 7.20pm last Monday in the Eastchester neighborhood. </p>

<p>Video obtained by DailyMail.com showed the 39-year-old dad and his children sitting on a couch inside the used car shop when a man in a black hoodie ran up and began firing through an open glass door. </p>

<p>The dad immediately scooped up his kids and dove to the floor, attempting to block them from a barrage of bullets with his body.  </p>

<p>Seconds later a door shattered, sending a shards of glass flying around the showroom as the family crawled to safety. </p>

<p>Anthony was struck in the thigh by one of the bullets, police sources told DailyMail.com. </p>

<p>He was transported to Jacobi Medical Center and is said to be in stable condition. </p>

<p>Several other customers were seen milling around the dealership when the gunshots rang out, sending them running for cover.  </p>

<p>Police said they're searching for two suspects, one of whom carjacked a vehicle immediately after the shooting. </p>

<p>The first round of gunfire shattered a door in the dealership, sending customers running</p>

<p>Seconds later another door shattered as Anthony tried to block his kids from bullets</p>

<p>The car, a four-door green sedan, was stopped at a red light just outside when the perpetrator approached, opened the door and pointed a gun at the 49-year-old driver, ordering him to get out.   </p>

<p>Investigators believe the shooting is gang-related. </p>

<p>Sources told the New York Daily News that a gang member was doing business in the dealership when their rival opened fire.  </p>

<p>The sources said investigators have not determined whether the father-of-three was targeted.</p>
