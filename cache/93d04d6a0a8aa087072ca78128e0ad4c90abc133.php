<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Eat Out to Help Out scheme was vastly popular with millions of households making the most of discounted breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout August.</p>

<p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced the scheme as a way of enticing consumers back out after months of staying in due to lockdown.</p>

<p>It gave diners eating in a 50 per cent discount on food or non-alcoholic drinks to eat or drink in, up to a maximum of £10 discount per diner, making meals out massively reduced.</p>

<p>However, despite the scheme coming to an end, there are still many ways customers can get reduced dinner out, with various discounts and vouchers available.</p>

<p>Many restaurants are continuing to discount their food and soft drinks throughout September</p>

<p>A large number of restaurants have also decided to continue with the same scheme, albeit without Government help, throughout September to continue encouraging customers to have a meal out. </p>

<p>This is Money has pulled together the best deals available to diners as well as a comprehensive list of restaurants that are continuing with an Eat Out to Help Out scheme.</p>

<p>For those who have bought any insurance through Compare the Market, they will be valid for Meerkat Meals for a whole year from the date of purchase.</p>

<p>With Meerkat Meals, customers can get two for one meals at over 1,000 restaurants across the UK including Prezzo, Pizza Hut and local, independent diners.</p>

<p>Customers can download the Meerkat app which will help you find participating diners nearby.  </p>

<p>The Gourmet Society, meanwhile, offers 25 per cent off the total bill, including drinks, for cardholders at over 6,000 restaurants across the UK.</p>

<p>This includes Bella Italia, Pizza Express, Chiquito, Zizzi, Café Rogue and a host of others.</p>

<p>Members usually pay £34.99 for an annual membership but there is an introductory offer currently available where new customers can pay just £1 for 60 days of offers.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak created the Eat Out to Help Out scheme to help restaurants back on their feet</p>

<p>Tastecard is another popular discount scheme with cardholders able to get 50 per cent off their food or 2 for 1 on main meals at thousands of restaurants across the UK.</p>

<p>New members can try a Tastecard for free for 30 days and then either pay £4.99 for a monthly membership or £34.99 for an annual one.</p>

<p>There are also apps that can help, including Vouchercloud that offers voucher codes for clothing, attractions and dining out. It is always worth checking the app before heading out to dinner to see if you can find a voucher for money off. </p>

<p>For example, at the moment, it is currently offering 50 per cent off mains at the chain restaurant, Browns.</p>

<p>Diners with an American Express credit card can save money thanks to its 'Shop Small' campaign which has been running since late June.</p>

<p>Meg Ellis, commercial director at Honest Burgers, who took part in the scheme, said: 'We've been really encouraged by the shift in energy in our sector as a result of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.</p>

<p>'We've been able to bring more people back into work as a result of the scheme, which they have really enjoyed, and for some of our friends operating independently in the sector this has been the opportunity to confidently re-open for the first time.</p>

<p>'Seeing the vitality coming back into their restaurants has been a joy to witness.' </p>
