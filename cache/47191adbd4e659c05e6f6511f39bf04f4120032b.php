<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A furniture removalist has been jailed for four-and-a-half years for moving a getaway car used in the daylight execution of former bikie kingpin Mick Hawi. </p>

<p>But in a quirk of fate, the friend that Ahmad Doudar, 40, accepted had shot Hawi dead as part of his guilty plea - Yusuf Nazlioglu - has been found not guilty of murder.</p>

<p>Father-of-one Doudar was sentenced on Thursday after admitting to being an accessory after the fact to Hawi's murder.</p>

<p>Hawi was climbing into his Mercedes AMG 4WD outside Fitness First Rockdale on February 15, 2018 when he was shot several times in the head and torso. </p>

<p>A jury found Yusuf Nazlioglu (left, shirtless) not guilty of Hawi's murder a week ago. Ahmad Doudar (right) pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to Hawi's murder</p>

<p>This is the moment an man with his face covered by a balaclava shot Hawi dead in a brazen daylight attack outside Fitness First Rockdale more than two years ago</p>

<p>The brazen executioners, face obscured by balaclavas, escaped while Hawi died of a brain injury in hospital. </p>

<p>Doudar's role in the crime involved him picking up a hidden silver Aurion with a tow truck and intending to dispose of it, alongside others, the court heard. </p>

<p>Justice Robert Allan Hulme said on sentencing today: '(Mr Doudar) intended to assist in disposing of the vehicle in order to assist' in the murder.</p>

<p>A week ago, accused shooter Nazlioglu, 39, and alleged getaway driver Jamal El-Jaidi, 32, were both found not guilty of murder by a jury, following a week of deliberations. </p>

<p>Doudar was not called to give evidence at their trial. </p>

<p>In handing down his sentence today, Justice Robert Allan Hulme said Doudar's plea of guilty and the facts he had agreed to indicated he knew 'the brazen and brutal executioner.'</p>

<p>'The murder itself was horrifying. It was a dangerous and violent public execution. Mr Doudar knew this.' </p>

<p>Hawi's wife Carolina Gonzalez gave a 'very moving account' of the grief she and her family have suffered during Doudar's sentencing</p>

<p>The judge said murders like this 'do not happen by chance... they require the involvement of multiple people.'  </p>

<p>Doudar's motive remains unknown. 'For all I know, Mr Doudar may have been motivated by one or more other purposes,' the judge said.</p>

<p>Hawi's wife, Carolina Gonzalez, sister Zeinab and parents Ahmad and Nahdi read statements at a sentencing hearing.</p>

<p>They gave 'very moving accounts of the loss and grief that has resulted from the taking of their loved one in the most horrendous of circumstances.'</p>

<p>Doudar was jailed with a non parole period of three years and four months.  With time served, he will be eligible for parole at the end of 2021. </p>
