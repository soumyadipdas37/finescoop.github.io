<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A leading disease expert has called for Daniel Andrews to 'ring-fence' coronavirus hotspots in Melbourne in a bid to end the city's crippling lockdown. </p>

<p>Epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws said the strategy of ring-fencing COVID-19 concentrated areas would allow other parts of Victoria to safely ease restrictions. </p>

<p>Ring-fencing involves locking down communities in high-infection areas and having them unable to leave patrolled checkpoints without special exemptions.</p>

<p>The method was effective in containing coronavirus in China and during the SARS outbreak of 2003. </p>

<p>Melbourne is four weeks into strict stage four restrictions, with stage three stay-at-home orders implemented in regional Victoria.</p>

<p>Professor McLaws (pictured) believes a ring-fencing strategy is the safest way to ease restrictions through Victoria</p>

<p>'In order to get some compassion back, I would be thinking about identifying where are some of the hotspots within the metropolitan area, and have that ring-fenced and then ease up elsewhere,' Professor McLaws told ABC.</p>

<p>'But if you're going to do that, you can't have ring-fence lite. You can't have a lockdown in a hotspot, but let people leave for work.'</p>

<p>Professor McLaws previously suggested using a ring-fencing strategy in Victoria in June before the first stay-at-home orders were introduced in the state. </p>

<p>Her analysis of data groups infection numbers to find a 'red zone', where more than 100 new cases are discovered over 14 days, making the outbreak difficult to control. </p>

<p>Professor McLaws said Victoria is still experiencing too many cases to substantially ease restrictions.</p>

<p>'If you start loosening up restrictions, and I understand it's so hard, you'll never get out of this red zone and you'll have a hard border put up around you for a very long time,' she said.</p>

<p>She recommended using a 'traffic light' system to identify coronavirus risk areas using red, amber and green levels to ease into life after the pandemic.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews is under increasing pressure to reveal an exit strategy for Victoria's tough lockdown.</p>

<p>'It is still a bit too early for us to be able to map out an absolutely definitive plan,' he said.</p>

<p>'But it will not be much longer before we have more detail, we will have more to say in more detail and with the certainty that I think every Victorian is absolutely entitled to.' </p>

<p>The restrictions are dragging down the national economy and Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has warned the fallout will only get worse.</p>

<p>But with Victoria still recording very numbers of new coronavirus infections each day, the premier is in no rush to outline his plans.</p>

<p>The Morrison government is becoming increasingly animated in its criticisms but with federal parliament returning on Monday, it can expect to cop more uncomfortable questions itself about its mishandling of deadly outbreaks in aged care.</p>

<p>New polling suggests people may have cooled on the federal government over its stewardship of nursing homes and overwhelmingly side with the premiers in a federal-state tussle over internal borders.</p>

<p>Shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the government was focused on blaming state counterparts instead of getting people back to work.</p>

<p>'It is no surprise Australians are tiring of a prime minister who chases headlines and not jobs,' he told reporters in Canberra.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded its deadliest day of the pandemic on Monday with 41 deaths and 73 new cases of coronavirus.</p>

<p>The figures bring the state's death toll from the virus to 565 and the national total to 652. </p>

<p>Melbourne's stage four restrictions are due to end in two weeks.</p>

<p>'It's hard to see that happening,' Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth told Nine on Monday.</p>

<p>'I think the numbers need to be a lot less than they are now.' </p>
