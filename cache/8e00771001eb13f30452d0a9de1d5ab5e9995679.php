<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jordan Henderson has again underlined why he is regarded as such a great leader at Liverpool with thoughtful gift and letter to Dejan Lovren. </p>

<p>Lovren left the Reds in July as he joined Zenit St Petersburg having helped play a part in Jurgen Klopp's side win the Premier League and Champions League the year before. </p>

<p>The Croatian posted images revealing Henderson's touching gesture, aimed at ensuring his former team-mate feels proud of he achieved at Anfield and remembered by all those who remain. </p>

<p>Jordan Henderson sent this replica Premier League trophy to former team-mate Dejan Lovren </p>

<p>The names and numbers of every member of the title winning squad are engraved on it</p>

<p>Henderson sent a replica Premier League trophy with the name of every player in the squad engraved but it was his letter that added a personal touch. </p>

<p>He wrote: 'Dej, it is impossible to think about Liverpool without you being here with us and to be honest it hasn't really sunk in yet you're not coming back. </p>

<p>'You have been such a massive figure in our team and one of the biggest influences in helping drive us to the point we are at now, winners and champions. </p>

<p>Clearly the gesture meant a lot to Lovren, who has since moved to Zenit St Petersburg</p>

<p>'I hope you realise that in the game you are rightly considered one of the best in the world at what you do. For us and Croatia you instilled a mentality within the dressing room of always keep fighting. </p>

<p>'Even in times where it was tough for you, you were still there for everyone else. I will never forget the support you gave me and the difference you made in helping lead this team. You were always a 'captain' yourself, without ever needing an armband, we all look up to you.</p>

<p>'Off the pitch, you were one of the biggest characters I shared a dressing room with. Every player - no matter where in the world they came from or their circumstances, could connect with you. It is an unbelievable human quality. </p>

<p>'I miss you already, even though I keep expecting you to bowl back into Melwood and be in the middle of banter and discussions. I hope you realise how much we all appreciate what you gave for this club and us as a team. I can't thank you enough and I am always available if you or your amazing family need anything. </p>

<p>'Good luck for the future but know you still have brothers in Liverpool if you ever need us. YNWA. Hendo.' </p>
