<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Treasury Minister has given banks the all-clear to turn down borrowers who took loan repayment 'holidays' during lockdown. </p>

<p>In a letter seen by the MoS, John Glen has said a payment holiday may impact a lender's 'willingness to provide credit' – even though Ministers previously promised that borrowers would not be affected. </p>

<p>More than three million people – many of whom are being paid by the Government's furlough scheme – used payment holidays having been assured it would not affect their creditworthiness. Business secretary Alok Sharma said in March that 'it shouldn't affect your credit score'. </p>

<p>In the red: More than three million people used payment holidays having been assured it would not affect their creditworthiness</p>

<p>But the MoS has revealed that customers are now being turned down for mortgages because they took a payment break. The City watchdog has allowed banks to inspect account data to work out if someone took a holiday on repayments. </p>

<p>In a letter to Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, Glen said: 'When considering whether or not to accept new loan or credit applications, lenders will look at a range of factors beyond a borrower's credit file. This could include asking the customer whether they have taken out a payment holiday as well as assessing income, expenditure and future ability to make repayments.' McDonagh, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said: 'Yet again the Government is backing up the banks in bad behaviour. </p>

<p>'People were clearly misled by the Government and the banks that if they requested a payment holiday it would have no impact on their future ability to borrow. </p>

<p>'They've used a sleight of words – they've said it won't affect your credit scoring, but it can still be taken into account.' </p>

<p>Film editor Dave Wilson, 44, said he was unable to move his Santander mortgage to a new property because he took a payment holiday. He is trying to move to a new house to make room for his third child with wife Jane. </p>

<p>He said: 'When the Government said we could take a penalty-free holiday, I thought it wouldn't be a bad thing to do. Our biggest bugbear is that we were not told at the time that it would have an effect on our ability to remortgage.' </p>

<p>A Santander spokesman said it is reviewing Mr Wilson's case. It said a payment holiday should not impact a customer's request to port a mortgage to a new property.</p>
