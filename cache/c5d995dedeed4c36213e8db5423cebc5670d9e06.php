<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>With anywhere between 65% and 70% of movie theaters now open in North America, Warner Bros. debuted the highly-anticipated Tenet to rather underwhelming results.</p>

<p>Tenet, the latest from writer-director Christopher Nolan, debuted with $20.2 million at the domestic box office, according to Variety. </p>

<p>The thriller opened in several international markets before its domestic debut, as it nears $150 million worldwide.</p>

<p>Box office: With anywhere between 65% and 70% of movie theaters now open in North America, Warner Bros. debuted the highly-anticipated Tenet to rather underwhelming results</p>

<p>Tenet was initially slated to open in theaters back in July, but it was pushed into August and then this weekend over the Labor Day holiday.</p>

<p>The film, which stars John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, earned $20.2 million from 2,810 theaters, earning a solid $7,188 per-screen average.</p>

<p>However, since several major theatrical markets are still closed, such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, that likely cost the film untold millions from its opening weekend gross.</p>

<p>Tenet stars: The film, which stars John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, earned $20.2 million from 2,810 theaters, earning a solid $7,188 per-screen average</p>

<p>Tenet added an additional $78.3 million from foreign markets this weekend, bringing its global box office tally to $146.2 million. </p>

<p>Tenet was the first major studio blockbuster to open nationwide, after theaters across the country were shuttered in mid-March due to COVID-19. </p>

<p>While on the surface the debut seems like a solid one for Warner Bros., those numbers also include an entire week of sneak peek screenings in several theaters across the country. </p>

<p>Foreign markets: Tenet added an additional $78.3 million from foreign markets this weekend, bringing its global box office tally to $146.2 million</p>

<p>Warner Bros. revealed in a note to press members that the studio was, 'very pleased' with the opening weekend, indicating that Tenet's roll-out will be more of a 'marathon,' as opposed to a typical release that is heavily front-loaded with emphasis on the film's opening weekend.</p>

<p>'There is literally no context in which to compare the results of a film opening during a pandemic with any other circumstance,' the studio said in their note.</p>

<p>'We are in unprecedented territory, so any comparisons to the pre-COVID world would be inequitable and baseless,' the note added.  </p>

<p>Marathon: Warner Bros. revealed in a note to press members that the studio was, 'very pleased' with the opening weekend, indicating that Tenet's roll-out will be more of a 'marathon,' as opposed to a typical release that is heavily front-loaded with emphasis on the film's opening weekend</p>

<p>With the film boasting a massive $200 million production budget, with several millions also spent to promote the film, the studio may indeed need a marathon to turn a profit on Tenet. </p>

<p>Box office analyst David A. Gross of FranchiseRe called Tenet's debut a 'fair opening' since there are still a 'significant number of key U.S. states and cities still closed.'</p>

<p>While several cities like Los Angeles have been relying on drive-in theaters to release films in a social-distancing environment, Warner Bros. issued strict guidelines that Tenet can only play in drive-in theaters in markets where indoor theaters are open.</p>

<p>Big budget: With the film boasting a massive $200 million production budget, with several millions also spent to promote the film, the studio may indeed need a marathon to turn a profit on Tenet</p>

<p>Disney/Fox's The New Mutants dropped nearly 60% to second place, earning $2.8 million from 2,754 theaters for a $1,042 per-screen average, bringing its domestic total to $11.6 million.</p>

<p>Unhinged dropped to third place with $1.7 million from 2,402 theaters for a paltry $695 per-screen average, bringing its domestic total to $11.3 million.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to next weekend, the only film opening in wide release is Sony's The Broken Heart's Gallery, in theaters September 11, with others like Rent-A-Pal and Find Your Voice opening in limited release. </p>
