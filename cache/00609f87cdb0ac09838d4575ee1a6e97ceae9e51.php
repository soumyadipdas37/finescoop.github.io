<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> Significant inroads have been made in the investigation into the murder of teenager who went missing on her way home from a nightclub 21 years ago, a detective has said.</p>

<p>The naked body of Victoria Hall, 17, was found in a ditch on September 24 1999, five days after she was last seen alive in Felixstowe. </p>

<p>Suffolk Police reopened its investigation last year after receiving fresh witness information. </p>

<p>Officers have taken 90 calls or messages from members of the public following the renewed appeal, the force said, creating new lines of inquiry.</p>

<p>Victoria Hall, 17, went missing after a night out with her friend in Felixstowe, 21 years ago</p>

<p>The 3,000 exhibits within the investigation have been reviewed, with the investigation supported by experts from the National Crime Agency.</p>

<p>Detective Chief Superintendent Eamonn Bridger said: 'Despite the passage of 21 years since Victoria was so cruelly torn away from her family, we remain positive and determined to find a breakthrough in this case and to deliver justice for them.</p>

<p>'When the reinvestigation into the abduction and murder of Victoria was launched last year, a dedicated Operation Avon team was set up to pursue new lines of inquiry and to identify fresh opportunities from the original investigation.</p>

<p>'The work undertaken so far has been vast and the team - with the assistance of numerous other colleagues - have made significant inroads.</p>

<p>'There is still much to do and we remain fully committed to completing this.</p>

<p>'Officers have remained in contact with Victoria's family throughout this process, providing them with continued support and keeping them updated as to the progress of the investigation.' </p>

<p>Victoria, from Trimley, St Mary, left home on the evening of September 18, 1999 for a night out with a friend at the Bandbox nightclub in Felixstowe.</p>

<p>They left the club at around 1am the following morning and parted at around 2.20am, yards from her home.</p>

<p>This was the last time she was seen alive.</p>

<p>Police have reissued images of the dress, jacket, shoes and a wooden hair slide that Victoria was wearing the last time she was seen</p>

<p>Her parents awoke in the morning to discover their daughter had not returned home and a missing person inquiry was launched.</p>

<p>Her body was found five days later in Creeting St Peter, around 25 miles from where she was last seen.</p>

<p>None of her clothing or possessions have been found.</p>

<p>Police said the movements of more than 70 people on the night in question have already been assessed in great detail, by reviewing more than 9,000 statements, documents, messages and reports from the original investigation.</p>

<p>Officers are also continuing to work through more than 1,200 links to people and vehicles.</p>

<p>They are making a specific appeal to hear from anyone who was either walking or driving in Trimley St Mary between 2am and 4am on Sunday September 19 1999.</p>

<p>Officers want any such people to make contact and provide their details, as this information will help to fill any gaps and assist the inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr Bridger said: 'We still believe there are people out there who will know something very significant about this case, but have still as yet not told us.</p>

<p>'It is never too late to come forward and we are ready to take their call.</p>

<p>'We know allegiances can change over the years and someone who may have been compelled to keep a secret to protect another person may no longer feel the same obligation.</p>

<p>'Any information we are given will be treated with the utmost confidence.</p>

<p>'Please help us to solve this shocking crime and provide Victoria's family the answers they deserve.'</p>

<p>The teenager's naked body was found in a ditch and none of her possessions have been found</p>

<p>Police have reissued images of the dress, jacket, shoes and a wooden hair slide that Victoria was wearing the last time she was seen.</p>

<p>Also as part of last year's appeal, CCTV footage was released of individuals at the field in Creeting St Peter where Victoria's body was found, which was captured during the month following her death.</p>

<p>A number of the calls received into the inquiry team related to this footage and the information provided has been taken into consideration as part of the ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>Anyone with information should contact the Major Investigation Team calling 101 and quoting Operation Avon.</p>
