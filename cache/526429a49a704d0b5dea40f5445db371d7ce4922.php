<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Being a contestant on The Bachelor may may seem like a fairytale - but producers and former contestants say otherwise.</p>

<p>Multiple sources have told Daily Mail Australia that the Channel 10 dating show isn't half as glamorous as it appears on TV.</p>

<p>One insider said that this year's season was 'a f**king punish' for the production team at Warner Bros. because the cast wasn't up to scratch.</p>

<p>Being a contestant on The Bachelor may may seem like a fairytale. But if production insiders claims are anything to go by, it's anything but glamorous Pictured: Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert </p>

<p>'Producers couldn't stand most of the girls,' the source said.</p>

<p>They added: 'They just wanted to be on the show to become famous. Some were fame hungry, some had dreams to become actors and others were there for clout.'</p>

<p>According to the source, producers worked overtime to convince Locky Gilbert to keep the few entertaining and engaging women in the mansion. </p>

<p>Not impressed: Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia a TV insider has claimed this year's series was 'the worst cast season,' and Warner Brother's producers were not happy</p>

<p>They were banking on Areeba Emmanuel being the main villain, but after she was sent home they tried to groom Juliette Herrera to be the 'house b**ch'.</p>

<p>'They wanted [Juliette] to be the new villain but she was too nice! Instead of being bossy, she was the one getting pushed around,' the insider said. </p>

<p>Another source alleged that many of the producers started to 'hate their jobs' after hearing rumours that Locky already knew contestant Bella Varelis before the show. </p>

<p>The crew apparently felt this made the competition unfair, although both Locky and Bella have denied having any sort of pre-existing relationship. </p>

<p>Producers 'control everything'</p>

<p>Nadine Kodsi, who was eliminated at the first rose ceremony, previously told Daily Mail Australia the show was 'rigged' and that Locky was just a 'puppet' being controlled by the producers.</p>

<p>She also alleged that he received instructions via an earpiece; however, this is not uncommon for reality shows like The Bachelor. </p>

<p>Many contestants are recruited via social media instead of applying </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands that online applications are only one part of the casting process, and that social media and 'street' casting are also widely used. </p>

<p>Contestants are scouted at restaurants, nightclubs and bars, with Coogee Pavilion in Sydney being considered a 'hotspot' for talent scouts.</p>

<p>The women are usually approached by casting producers, before agreeing to meet for coffee. It's not until later that the formal auditions and background checks begin.</p>

<p>Others are simply messaged via social media, with contestant Kristina Abramoff saying: 'I was approached by Instagram DM to come to the audition.'</p>

<p>Hectic filming schedules</p>

<p>The first cocktail party is filmed over several nights for as long as 12 hours at a time. </p>

<p>Some of the women end up getting drunk simply out of boredom and find themselves saying things they regret on camera.</p>

<p>One contestant, rumoured to be Zoe-Clare McDonald, actually passed out before the rose ceremony was filmed.</p>

<p>Secret hiding places in the mansion</p>

<p>Carlin Sterritt, who appeared on last year's season of The Bachelorette, recently said there were a few places in the mansion that were hidden from cameras.</p>

<p>'There's the orchard, the secret place you can go to for chats and stuff... Angie and I kissed [there] at so many cocktail parties,' he said. 'But obviously they didn't show it.'</p>

<p>He claimed that Locky would most likely be doing the same.</p>

<p>'If you're wondering, yes, Locky is macking on with many girls at the cocktail parties. It's happening. 100 per cent,' he said.</p>

<p>Social media ban </p>

<p>The contestants on The Bachelor are not allowed to use Instagram, Facebook or Twitter until they have been sent home.</p>

<p>Their social media activity is then carefully monitored by Channel 10 and Warner Bros. until their elimination has aired on television.</p>

<p>If the women share unsanctioned content, they face potential legal consequences.</p>
