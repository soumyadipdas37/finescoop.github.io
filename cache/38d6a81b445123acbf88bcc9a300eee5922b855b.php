<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One of Scotland's top performing state schools has been urged to change its name - after its founder was linked to the slave trade.</p>

<p>Nearly 600 people have signed a petition calling for James Gillespie's High School in Edinburgh to be renamed.</p>

<p>Born in 1726, Gillespie was a wealthy tobacco merchant in 18th-century Edinburgh and was one of the richest men in the Capital.</p>

<p>When he died, he left some of his fortune with a request for a school for underprivileged children to be built.</p>

<p>Nearly 600 people have signed a petition calling for James Gillespie's High School in Edinburgh to be renamed because of its founder's links to the slave trade</p>

<p>The high school, founded in 1803, has been attended by comedian Ronnie Corbett and novelist Dame Muriel Spark.</p>

<p>But now there are calls for the school to be renamed because Gillespie, who died in 1797, made his money in the slave trade.</p>

<p>A petition read: 'For those who don't know, James Gillespie became one of the richest men in Edinburgh by selling Virginia tobacco and snuff - products of slave labour.</p>

<p>'This makes him a direct contributor and benefactor of the slave trade. It is possible that Gillespie may have owned slaves himself.</p>

<p>'It is time that we change the name of our school to something that truly values the diversity that exists within it.</p>

<p>'This is not an attempt to cover up our history, rather a way of saying that we don't believe that this man is someone who should be celebrated anymore.</p>

<p>'Education on our school's history should part of our curriculum, but a man who made his wealth at the expense of others' lives is not something we should be proud of.</p>

<p>'Our main building is named after Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai - an activist and truly inspiring woman, who's defiance and bravery represent our school values far better than Gillespie.'</p>

<p>Now there are calls for the school to be renamed because Gillespie (pictured is a bust of Gillespie), who died in 1797, made his money in the slave trade</p>

<p>The school said on its website: 'We acknowledge the connections to the North Virginia slave-owning tobacco plantations which this trade had.</p>

<p>'We teach children about chattel slavery and about modern slavery.</p>

<p>'We are currently updating our curriculum to take more account of this history and of the Black Lives Matter movement.' </p>

<p>A City of Edinburgh Council spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the petition and all our schools are committed to addressing racism and inequality in all its forms.</p>

<p>'Edinburgh has historical features such as street names and architecture which relate to the city's involvement in the slave trade. </p>

<p>'Our schools have a vital role in tackling racism through strong anti-racist leadership and teaching. </p>

<p>'It's important that we all critically examine the historical evidence around us, ensuring that black history and its role in our city are a core part of a decolonised and inclusive curriculum. </p>

<p>'By doing this we will understand the wrongs of the past and dismantle their harmful and persistent legacy in present day racism and structural inequalities.' </p>

<p>James Gillespie was a snuff and tobacco merchant in Edinburgh during the 18th century who became one of the richest people in the city.</p>

<p>He accumulated his wealth while running a family shop with his brother John.</p>

<p>Gillespie has come under scrutiny in recent weeks over his links to the slave trade.</p>

<p>The merchant made his money through the snuff and tobacco trade which were products of slave labour.</p>

<p>Gillespie is credited with having coined the phrase 'waste not, want not' and allowed the staff at his snuff mill to live in his Georgian mansion.</p>

<p>The location of his shop is still marked to this day by a stone tablet on the Royal Mile.</p>

<p>When he died, Gillespie left a sum of money so that a free boy's school could be set up to provide an education for the underprivileged. </p>

<p>Gillespie also left money behind for the construction of a hospital which was demolished in 1975. </p>
