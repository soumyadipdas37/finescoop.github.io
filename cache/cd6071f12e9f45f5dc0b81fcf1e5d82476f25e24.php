<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thank goodness Esther McVey isn't the paranoid type, prone to worrying about her popularity. </p>

<p>The Tory MP got married last Saturday, but when she first realised she was going to have to cull her wedding guest list, to comply with Covid rules, she worried about how to break the news to her friends.</p>

<p>She needn't have. </p>

<p>She tells me — from her honeymoon, no less! — that even before she had summoned up the courage to tell most of her guests that their services (and hats) would no longer be required, there was a stampede as guests contacted her.</p>

<p>The Tory MP (pictured) got married last Saturday, but when she first realised she was going to have to cull her wedding guest list, to comply with Covid rules, she worried about how to break the news to her friends</p>

<p>'They actually came forward and said "Esther, if we don't make the cut we totally understand because these are unprecedented times".'</p>

<p>How thoughtful. </p>

<p>Perhaps they saw an opportunity in not having to fork out for a new outfit and a babysitter and some John Lewis vouchers? </p>

<p>She pauses for a moment. 'Or it could have been that they'd seen my video and knew they were for the chop.'</p>

<p>Ah yes! Her video. </p>

<p>In it, Esther — who had been planning her (big) wedding with military precision — addressed a very modern dilemma: How does a bride decimate that guestlist when the law demands it?</p>

<p>She and her groom, fellow MP Philip Davies, were living the logistical nightmare themselves.</p>

<p>They had been planning quite a bash — 130 guests, big dress, gospel choir, honeymoon in France — before Covid scuppered everything.</p>

<p>Rather touchingly (and surprisingly, given that she admits she spent 30 years being rather 'meh' about the idea of getting married at all), she had consulted Debrett's, the society etiquette guide, for expert wedding planning advice. </p>

<p>She'd sent the 'save the date' alerts out in January, as Debrett's decrees, and had the embossed invites sorted. </p>

<p>Then came Covid and, alas, Debrett's doesn't have a section on how to politely uninvite the majority of your wedding guests, so they were on their own.</p>

<p>How does a bride decimate that guestlist when the law demands it? She and her groom, fellow MP Philip Davies, were living the logistical nightmare themselves</p>

<p>Determined not to cancel the wedding, but simply to adapt to the circumstances, Esther (who used to be a TV presenter, and famously shared the breakfast telly sofa with Eamonn Holmes) made a series of short videos, examining her options.</p>

<p>Should they canvass their guests, asking what presents they were planning to buy, she asked, rather horrifying some of her Twitter followers, but making others laugh.</p>

<p>Should they make them fill in a questionnaire? Perhaps the fairest option was to make it random. </p>

<p>She duly printed up a dartboard cover, with the faces of all her guests on it, and filmed herself throwing darts, wearing a mask over her eyes.</p>

<p>'It was quite tongue-in-cheek,' she points out, lest we think she was serious. 'It was a bit of fun, but there was a serious point to it all too. </p>

<p>'Like so many couples we were having those conversations. Do we need a photographer? Can we afford not to have an organist? </p>

<p>'At one point we did think, worst-case scenario there is only going to be us and the Bishop there, with us taking selfies.'</p>

<p>The funniest part of all is that there was one guest who perhaps didn't expect to be on that dartboard at all. He certainly wasn't scrabbling to say 'no, no, I'll forgo the vol-au-vents'.</p>

<p>Step forward Esther's boss — the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. </p>

<p>Yes, while everyone else was clamouring to say they wouldn't be offended at being uninvited, bold Boris was still assuring her that he'd be there, come whatever.</p>

<p>'I had to tell him, in this instance, Boris, you can't come.'</p>

<p>Let's just clarify here. You culled the Prime Minister from your wedding guest list? </p>

<p>'So, yes, he was on the big list and then he didn't make the final cut. He took that in good humour. </p>

<p>'But it's OK because we will go and have a drink with him and Carrie at some point after all this.'</p>

<p>Out of interest, was he on the list in the first place because he was a friend, or because he was your boss?</p>

<p>There is a bit of a pause as she considers how not to answer this one (to be fair it is tricky for her because Boris fired her from her Cabinet post in February after he was on the 'big list', but before the cull). </p>

<p>'Because we wanted him to be there. He is, let's be honest, a bon vivant.'</p>

<p>'I had to tell him, in this instance, Boris, you can't come.' Let's just clarify here. You culled the Prime Minister (pictured) from your wedding guest list?</p>

<p>Well, it sounds as if Boris missed a treat. The wedding went ahead, with the ceremony taking place in the chapel of St Mary Undercroft, at the House of Commons, and the reception was held in the Churchill Room. </p>

<p>And a very Carry On Covid wedding it was, too. The sun shone, the bride looked radiant, and the guests, she says, matched their masks to their finery.</p>

<p>Seriously? 'Oh yes. Most people made such an effort to match the colours. My mates-of-honour — I refuse to call them maids — had navy blue masks. </p>

<p>My Dad had been debating whether to wear his Liverpool FC one, or match his to his suit... It was quite strange to look down and see all your wedding guests wearing masks.'</p>

<p>Strange, and sweet, and a little bit sad. Very 2020, as it happens. There was a blitz mentality feel to some of the wedding planning.</p>

<p> The big traditional dress Esther had planned was quietly ditched ('it didn't feel right when we had to pare down the wedding') and replaced with a more understated dress with a matching jacket on top. </p>

<p>Lovely, actually, 'and my dressmaker made me a pair of trousers, too, so I can wear the jacket again'. Very make-do-and-mend.</p>

<p>The organist — bless his versatility — leapt into the gospel choir void and agreed to play Oh Happy Day on the organ. How did that work? </p>

<p>'Surprisingly well. He did All You Need Is Love, too,' she says. The honeymoon is very 2020, too. </p>

<p>They were supposed to go to the South of France, 'but BA cancelled the flights and ruined that', but they are having a nice time walking in the Cotswolds, and then they are moving on to a more exotic location. Yes, North Wales.</p>

<p>'We will have a huge party eventually, so I'm looking on the bright side. I can have two marvellous days.'</p>

<p>After hearing all about Esther's Covid wedding, and the planning thereof, I am in awe. </p>

<p>Say what you like about her track record as a politician (and plenty do), but you have to hand it to her for holding it together as her wedding plans disintegrated.</p>

<p>For pretty much everything that could go wrong for this particular set of nuptials, did. </p>

<p>'Ironic, isn't it,' she agrees. 'I wait till I'm 52 to get married. I could have picked any one of the other 30-odd years, and I pick this one!'</p>

<p>It turns out the culled guest list was only the start of the problems. On the night before the wedding, Esther got a call from the photographer saying he had Covid symptoms and had to bail out. </p>

<p>'It was 8pm on Thursday night. You can imagine. I had to get in touch with all my friends asking if anyone know anyone who has ever taken a photograph before? </p>

<p>Esther's quite candid about the fact that she never really wanted to get married before she met Philip (pictured), who is divorced with teenage sons</p>

<p>'A chap called Ash, friend of a friend, saved the day.'</p>

<p>Then there was the hair trauma. Now, you have to be aware that it's widely accepted that Esther has the best hair in Westminster. </p>

<p>She consistently looks like she's just stepped out of a salon. At one point her hair even had its own Twitter account.</p>

<p>The problem with her wedding day hair plans? Her hairdresser Mark Power is based in Cheshire, and having him come down especially would mean inviting him to the wedding.</p>

<p>'He said he wanted to do it anyway as a wedding present. Unfortunately on the day the trains were cancelled and he was stranded in Macclesfield, but he's ex-military and if anyone was going to be unfazed by that it's him. </p>

<p>'He ended up driving down and saving the day.' There is so much to process here. Your hairdresser is ex-military? 'Yes he served in Iraq and retrained as a hairdresser.'</p>

<p>Hurrah all round for determination, team-work and thinking on your feet then. In fact, it sounds as if Boris is missing a trick and should put Team Esther (Wedding Division) in charge of test-and-trace.</p>

<p>On a more serious note, her own experience highlights what an omnishambles the business of arranging a wedding now is.</p>

<p>She confesses that even she, a sitting MP, was confused about how many people were actually allowed at her wedding. </p>

<p>It was 20 attendees for the service (including bride and groom), but did that apply to the reception, too? </p>

<p>She had to seek clarification, she says. Where? </p>

<p>'On the Government website, and at the Commons, too. Because the wedding was happening within the Commons there were specific rules about that.' </p>

<p>Even in the week since she tied the knot, the rules have changed again — with 30 guests now reduced to 15 — making things even more difficult for couples.</p>

<p>She's rather glad she did.</p>

<p>'It wasn't the day I planned, but it was very special. There was something very intimate about it, but mostly there's just a sense of relief now that it done.'</p>

<p>Esther's quite candid about the fact that she never really wanted to get married before she met Philip, who is divorced with teenage sons. </p>

<p>They met in 2011 and bonded over Brexit (they are both arch-Brexiteers).</p>

<p>Some women who come to marriage later in life express regret that they didn't meet their husband early. Not Esther. She simply never wanted to be married before. </p>

<p>'No, I think it's the right time. I have been fortunate. I have done great things. I don't think I wanted to... well, the phrase is 'settle down', isn't it? </p>

<p>'But it doesn't fit well with me. I don't think I have settled down. Maybe that's the key. I have found someone I don't have to settle down with, someone who allows me to be me. </p>

<p>'One of the great things about marrying at this age is that we are very independent. </p>

<p>'Later in life, you have your own passions, hobbies, interests, your own life really. He accepts me for me, as I do for him.'</p>

<p>She agrees that the fact they are both MPs is helpful. Other spouses 'probably wouldn't be as understanding when they find out you will not be home until after voting, which means 11pm. </p>

<p>'It's a complicated timetable for someone who is not involved, and it does put stresses on other people's relationships, but we understand it.'</p>

<p>That children are not on the agenda, as they would be in most marriages, also makes for a 'very different relationship because that isn't part of the drive'. </p>

<p>She doesn't exactly say she never wanted children, but admits 'you can't have everything in life and obviously I've prioritised different things'.</p>

<p>She does have two step-sons now though: Philip's sons are 17 and 15. Was it daunting to come into their lives? </p>

<p>'The important thing is that they know I am Philip's wife, but their Mum, who they adore, is always going to be their Mum. </p>

<p>'I think the best thing for me was probably going to a football match with them, early doors. I was getting to know them in their space.'</p>

<p>Today, she jests that she agreed to marry Philip because he 'wore her down', but after consideration she agrees that it was more a case that she couldn't see why not to marry him.</p>

<p>'I was feeling I'd gone past the point of getting married, past the point of really caring whether I did or didn't, but then the question brought it back into focus. </p>

<p>'All sorts of things went through my mind — I don't need to get married. Why fix it if it's not broken... all those things, but then I thought, actually, this is really important to Philip and if it's really important to him, then it should be important to me.'</p>

<p>This isn't the most romantic explanation in the world of why you would want to get married, but then she's not the romantic one in the relationship, she declares.</p>

<p>'He's the more romantic of the two of us, so he will book things like holidays and meals out. My head will be under the bonnet of the car and he will be booking the restaurant.'</p>

<p>Which of the newly-weds will be putting the bins out, when the honeymoon is over? 'Neither of us cares who does that, but if it's raining he will. His hair needs less attention than mine.'</p>
