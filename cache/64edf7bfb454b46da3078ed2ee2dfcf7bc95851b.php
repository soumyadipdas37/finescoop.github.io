<p>She told new! magazine: 'I've had a FaceTime date. It's quite scary because you think we're just gonna sit face to dace and say, "Hello, how are you?"</p>

<p>'It's kind of awkward, so it's good to do a creative activity like paint a picture together, which is what we did. It's cool because you see how much effort they've put in.</p>

<p>'So if they get their paints and canvas ready, you're like, "Ah, he wants to impress me."' </p>

<p>'I got Sharon Stoned on Tinder. No one believed it was me,' she told The Sun. 'People were messaging me going, "There’s a fake of you on Tinder. But don’t worry, we’ve reported it and we’ve cancelled it". I was like, "No, it really is me".</p>

<p>'I didn’t get any dates and most of the people getting in touch were a bit catfishy, which was weird.' </p>

<p>Despite resorting to the convoluted world of dating apps in a bid to find her Mr. Right, Jorgie insists she has no issue with being single. </p>
