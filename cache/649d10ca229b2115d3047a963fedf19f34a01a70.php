<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tiny black dots commonly found on ceilings, walls and kitchen tiles have been confirmed to be spider droppings.</p>

<p>One baffled woman turned to a Facebook cleaning group for answers after seeing the dark specks in her home.  </p>

<p>The most popular response from group members - that the spots was the correct one, an expert from the University of Sydney revealed. </p>

<p>A baffled woman took to Facebook with an image of black dots in her home asking if anyone knew what they were </p>

<p>The majority of answers said the dots were spider poo, and are more common in warmer months - which means bad news for Australians enjoying spring.  </p>

<p>Dieter Hochuli, an ecologist and professor at the University of Sydney, confirmed the spider theory was true. </p>

<p>'Spider and fly droppings look similar – and those small blobs are liquid nitrogen-rich poo,' he told news.com.au. </p>

<p>Spiders produce thick, liquid droppings which come in shades of white, gray, brown, or black. </p>

<p>Professor Hochuli said there was nothing to worry about as they were quite common at this time of year. </p>

<p>'There is no public health risk about them. We live surrounded by hundreds of spiders in our day-to-day lives.'  </p>

<p>Dieter Hochuli, an ecologist and professor, said the droppings were not an issue </p>

<p>Social media users also chimed in with ways to remove them.</p>

<p>'It happens a lot this time of year, spiders pooing everywhere, Dettox spray is good for it,' one wrote.  </p>

<p>Others recommended wiping the droppings as soon as they're spotted as that makes them easier to remove, and if left for too long could leave a yellow stain.</p>

<p>Even if not cleaned off immediately, the droppings can still be removed with water and a stiff brush, or bleach, depending on the surface.</p>
