<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Never mind about orienteering or tying knots – the Scouts’ latest badge is for spotting fake news.</p>

<p>Its introduction comes as the organisation modernises itself for ‘life in 2020’.</p>

<p>Youngsters who can identify online dangers such as ‘bogus bulletins’ and celebrity-sponsored product endorsements will earn themselves the organisation’s revamped Digital Citizen Badge.</p>

<p>The badge has been designed to teach Scouts how to manage cyber bullying, protect their personal data and improve their CVs.</p>

<p>The Scouts’ latest Digital Citizen Badge (pictured) is awarded for spotting fake news </p>

<p>Scouts learning how to spot fake news are shown examples of stories that have been widely shared but are not true, including a photo-shopped image of a shark swimming down a motorway in Texas after a hurricane, which was seen by at least 14million.</p>

<p>They will be given three top tips for spotting fake news: look at the source, ask questions and evaluate the evidence.</p>

<p>Celebrities and social media sites will also be under the spotlight. </p>

<p>The advice to scouts tells them to question: ‘Does that source have any vested interests? Are they making money from it? Are they selling something? Why are they making this claim?’ </p>

<p>Older scouts will be asked to create a digital version of the Scout Law and debate issues which polarise opinion online.</p>

<p>Its introduction comes as the organisation modernises itself for ‘life in 2020’</p>

<p>An Ofcom study last year found that more than half of 12 to 15-year olds said that they felt it is difficult to work out whether news on social media is accurate or not.</p>

<p>There are 638,000 scouts in the UK, more than a quarter of whom are female. </p>

<p>Scout volunteers contribute more than 30 million hours of work each year to their local communities.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the organisation told the Telegraph: ‘Society has changed since 1907 when we started. We need to equip young people to live an active, positive life in 2020.’ </p>

<p>Chief Scout, TV adventurer Bear Grylls, said: ‘I am known for being able to survive in the wild but it’s just as important that young people today have their wits about them when online.</p>

<p>‘Taking part in this badge will help Scouts of all ages make good online decisions. Scouting is all about helping young people develop skills for life and this badge a really good example of our approach to youth work.’ </p>
