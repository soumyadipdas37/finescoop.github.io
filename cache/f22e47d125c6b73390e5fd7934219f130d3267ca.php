<p>'Stayed away': Areeba Emmanuel has spoken about racism and diversity in The Bachelor mansion, after she was given the boot by Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert this week. The 25-year-old, who is the first Pakistani woman to star on the reality series, claimed that some of her fellow co-stars 'stayed away' from her during her time on the Channel Ten dating show </p>

<p>'Actions speak louder than words. It doesn’t always have to be said, and it wasn’t said,' Areeba told the publication. </p>

<p>'There was no "I don’t like you because of the colour of your hair or the colour of your skin". They’re not trying to be … but they really stayed away from me after that first night.' </p>

<p>Areeba was referring to her clash with redhead Zoe-Clare McDonald, who claimed she was being discriminated against for the colour of her hair.   </p>

<p>'There was no "I don’t like you because of the colour of your hair or the colour of your skin". They’re not trying to be … but they really stayed away from me after that first night.' Areeba was referring to her clash with redhead Zoe-Clare McDonald, who claimed she was being discriminated against for the colour of her hair </p>

<p>During The Bachelor premiere, which aired on August 12, Zoe-Clare had a meltdown after Areeba interrupted her chat with Locky Gilbert.</p>

<p>Zoe-Clare claimed she was being 'oppressed' because of her hair colour.</p>

<p>'I'm the only redhead in the whole entire house... The only colours are blonde or brunette, and then there's me. I think that's exactly why Areeba is targeting me. It's the red hair. It's just... it's not appropriate,' she said.</p>

<p>Her rant left viewers baffled as nobody had mentioned the colour of her hair during the show.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Areeba said she no hard feelings towards the women, saying that she has a 'strong personality'. </p>

<p>'They never really treated me bad. I was treated how I expected, really,' she added. </p>

<p>'My personality is very strong and not many people like that so they just stay away because maybe they’re scared.' </p>

<p>Fuming: On Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor, Locky felt the wrath of Areeba after he sent the feisty reality star packing</p>

<p>After being eliminated along with four other contestants, Areeba fumed that this year's Bachelor clearly had a penchant for 'basic girls'.</p>

<p>'This is definitely the first time I have ever been rejected by a guy. I don't care because he obviously likes basic girls, and that's not me. I ain't basic,' she pouted.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel Ten. </p>
