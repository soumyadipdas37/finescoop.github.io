<p>Robert Dennett, 45, and Kamron Wootton, 35, were sentenced to 24 months' probation, during which time they are banned from hunting, over the murky scam where they pretended a huge catch came from Lake Powell in order to take home the $2,500 winnings. </p>

<p>The net closed in on the two fishing enthusiasts when contest officials spotted some key differences between their fish and the usual fish caught in the lake. </p>

<p>Judges drafted in forensic experts to examine the suspect fish, who proved the winning catch was indeed a fraud.   </p>

<p>The suspect fish. Two fishermen have been convicted of felonies for cheating in a Utah fishing contest, after forensic analysis of the winning fish proved it came from another lake</p>

<p>Dennett and Wootton participated in the two-day largemouth bass fishing tournament on Lake Powell in Southern Utah in October 2018.</p>

<p>The contest, which draws competitive anglers to the waters teeming with bass, catfish and walleye each year, had pulled in around 25 teams all vying to take home the $2,500 prize money. </p>

<p>The prize is awarded to the team that catches the five fish with the highest total weight.</p>

<p>By the end of day one, the cheaters were in second place and had so far earned the prize of the biggest single fish. </p>

<p>But the contest officials thought it seemed 'fishy' because the bass didn't look the same as the other fish it was pitted against, Lt. Paul Washburn, a spokesman for the Utah wildlife division told the New York Times.  </p>

<p>'One, they were shaped differently, indicating that they probably have a different diet,' he said. </p>

<p>'And then also they had some markers of stress,' such as red fins. </p>

<p>The officials called a biologist and the wildlife resources division to report their suspicions and an investigator questioned the two men on day two of the contest. </p>

<p>'Neither one of them were very inclined to talk to our investigator,' Washburn told the Times. </p>

<p>'One of them started to kind of acknowledge that yeah, the fish maybe hadn't come from Lake Powell. </p>

<p>A normal fish caught at Lake Powell. Robert Dennett, 45, and Kamron Wootton, 35, were sentenced to 24 months' probation over the murky scam where they pretended a huge catch came from Lake Powell in order to take home the $2,500 winnings</p>

<p>'Then he very quickly asked for an attorney, and the other individual didn't want to say anything.' </p>

<p>The two men had also taken home first, second or third place at eight other bass fishing tournaments earlier in 2018. </p>

<p>The bass was forensically tested at a University of Utah lab to determine where it had originated from and, in May 2019, researchers revealed it was not possible for it to have come from Lake Powell.</p>

<p>Investigators later determined the fish was taken by the culprits from Quail Creek Reservoir, about 180 miles west of the lake. </p>

<p>Under Utah law, it is illegal to transport live fish to other areas of the state without proper certifications and can be a class A misdemeanor.  </p>

<p>In March, Dennett and Wootton were charged with the third-degree felony of tampering to influence a contest, the Class A misdemeanor of unlawful release of wildlife and Class B misdemeanor of captivity of protected wildlife.</p>

<p>The two men pleaded guilty in August to all three counts.</p>

<p>They were sentenced to 24 months' probation, banned from fishing for 24 months and ordered to complete 48 hours of community service.</p>

<p>They were also ordered to pay a $500 plea in abeyance fee and $2,500 in restitution to the wildlife division's Help Stop Poaching Fund.   </p>

<p>Their conviction marks the first time in Utah's history that someone has been prosecuted for cheating in a fishing tournament.</p>
