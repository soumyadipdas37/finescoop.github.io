<p>Ouch! Jenni Falconer put on a brave face as she wore her fracture walker boot while leaving Global Radio studios on Thursday after her Smooth FM show</p>

<p>Jenni highlighted her slender physique in the stunning floral wrap dress that tied at her waist. </p>

<p>Her arm candy consisted of a large red leather tote bag that draped over her arm. </p>

<p>The Scottish presenter protected her face with a pair of chic tortoiseshell frames, and she highlighted her natural beauty with a radiant make-up look. </p>

<p>Jenni wore comfortable white trainers, a sensible choice given that she is required to wear the walker boot to allow her injury to heal. </p>

<p>Unfazed: The radio host, 44, didn't let her foot injury get in the way of her stylish ensemble as she made her way through central London</p>

<p>On Monday, the broadcaster revealed to MailOnline that her injury has now forced her to abandon plans to take part in the virtual London Marathon.</p>

<p>She said: 'A few weeks ago I sustained a stress fracture on my 3rd metatarsal. Frustratingly it’s very hard to spot on an X-ray and so it took quite a while to diagnose.</p>

<p>'Anyway, it happened six weeks ago and thankfully it is repairing well so I have to wear a support boot whilst I’m walking around to limit further damage until it fully mends.</p>

<p>'It was a consequence of excessive running in lockdown whilst preparing for the virtual London marathon. </p>

<p>'Sadly it means I can no longer run on October 4th but should be back running home from work in a month!'</p>

<p>Away from radio, it was recently announced that the health conscious star is the face and voice of newly launched fitness app Start 2 Run.</p>

<p>The app is ideal for people who need help getting started running as well as people who want to up their running mileage or aim for a particular running distance goal.</p>

<p>Users will have Jenni with them for all their training sessions, encouraging and motivating, as well as providing tips and pointers. </p>
