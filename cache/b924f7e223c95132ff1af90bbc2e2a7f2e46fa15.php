<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kanye West has shared shocking footage of himself urinating on a Grammy Award as he 'goes into battle' against labels Universal and Sony to try and retrieve the rights to his own music.</p>

<p>The rapper, 43, posted the vision to his Twitter feed on Wednesday afternoon, which showed one of his 21 Grammys placed inside of a toilet bowl. </p>

<p>'Trust me... I WON'T STOP,' West captioned the clip, which referred to his current bid to gain ownership of his masters - otherwise known as the copyright to his original songs. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, West started attacking the structure of the music industry, declaring that musicians actually had little to no power because record labels owned all of their work. </p>

<p>He took aim at his labels Universal and Sony and vowed not to release any new music until he was freed from his contracts with them. </p>

<p>Kanye West has shared shocking footage of himself urinating on a Grammy Award as he 'goes into battle' against labels Universal and Sony to retrieve the rights to his own music</p>

<p>Kanye West is continuing his feud with music labels Universal and Sony, claiming he will not release new songs until he is released from his contracts with them. The rapper went on a Twitter rant Wednesday morning, posting dozens of tweets in the space of three hours </p>

<p>On Tuesday, West claimed that black musicians had little to no power in the industry. </p>

<p>The Gold Digger rapper also savaged the strict contracts that black NBA players were under, and stated: 'The music industry and the NBA are modern day slave ships I'm the new Moses'.</p>

<p>Taking to Twitter again on Wednesday morning, West repeated the same sentiment, stating: 'There is no NBA or music industry without black people... fair contracts matter... ownership matters'. </p>

<p>He vowed to buy his own masters and declared that his upcoming fight with the labels was going to 'change the music industry for good'.  </p>

<p>West also shared the screenshots of a private contract he signed with Universal back in 2011, just minutes after he tweeted: 'I feel so humbled and blessed that God has put me in a strong enough position to do this ... Everyone keep praying.. It's working... I am on my knees this morning.' </p>

<p>He then appeared to address black artists directly, and claimed that there needed to be an overhaul in the business. </p>

<p>'We've gotten comfortable with not having what we deserve ... they [record labels] allow us to have a little money from touring, get some gold chains, some alcohol, some girls and fake numbers that feed our egos ... but we don't own our masters,' he wrote. </p>

<p>He also accused the media of 'trying to kill' black heroes, including Michael Jackson. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>During his morning Twitter rant, West also stated that he was too powerful to be 'muted or cancelled' and declared that he was rich enough to buy his masters from Universal and Sony. </p>

<p>'Universal won't tell me what my masters cost because they know I can afford to buy them,' he taunted in a tweet shared shortly after 9am. </p>

<p>West has a reported net worth of $1.3 billion. The cost of his masters is likely to be upwards of $300 million. </p>

<p>Back in 2018, Scooter Braun bought Big Machine Label Group for that price, acquiring almost all of Taylor Swift's masters in the process. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, West went on to share a number of Biblical verses, before writing: 'I KNOW MY LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST WILL MAKE FOOLS OF AND PUNISH ALL WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN UNFAIR CONTRACTS'. </p>

<p>He added: 'I will do everything in my legal power and use my voice until all artist contracts are changed, starting with getting my masters for my children. I will not stop, I promise you. I am petty and very personal.'</p>

<p>He also riffed on the Black Lives Matter movement, by tweeting: 'BLACK MASTERS MATTER'.  </p>

<p>Kanye West revealed the giant wall he is constructing around his Los Angeles mansion as he continued his Twitter feud with music label Universal on Tuesday night</p>
