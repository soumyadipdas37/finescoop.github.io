<p>New kid on the block: Married At First Sight star Martha Kalifatidis (pictured) stepped in to host The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Thursday after host Jackie 'O' Henderson called in sick </p>

<p>Martha, 30, was one of the breakout stars from Married At First Sight's sixth season in 2019, and is still dating her 'husband' Michael Brunelli.</p>

<p>When the show began broadcasting at 6am, Kyle addressed Jackie's absence and introduced Martha to listeners.</p>

<p>'Jackie is not here today, so Martha has come in,' he said.</p>

<p>'Jackie did an all nighter yesterday, she did this show then the puppet show [Masked Singer]. She's crashed.' </p>

<p>'She's crashed': Jackie (pictured) had taken the day off due to exhaustion, having pulled an all-nighter on Tuesday filming the finale of The Masked Singer followed by her KIIS FM breakfast show the next morning</p>

<p>Last-minute addition: Martha (right, with Kyle Sandilands) was an eleventh-hour replacement after usual fill-in host Beau Ryan was unavailable</p>

<p>Jackie is due to return to work on Friday. </p>

<p>Kyle joked he would 'be nice' to Martha, saying: 'You're going to hold our hand, we're going to hold your hand, and we're going to get through this show.'</p>

<p>The reality star said she had been called by one of KIIS FM's producers at 5:30am, just half an hour before the show was due to go live. </p>

<p>She'll be back soon! Jackie is due to return to work on Friday after resting up</p>

<p>Former NRL player Beau Ryan is the usual fill-in host when Kyle or Jackie take a day off.</p>

<p>While there was no reason given for his absence, he was most likely not able to do the show because he's filming The Amazing Race for Channel 10. </p>

<p>The Kyle and Jackie O Show airs weekdays from 6am on KIIS 106.5 in Sydney</p>
