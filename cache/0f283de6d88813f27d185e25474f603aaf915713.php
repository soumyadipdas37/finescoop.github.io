<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A sadistic rapist who strangled a man after tricking him into digging his own grave has finally been jailed more than 20 years later.</p>

<p>Graham Thomas Sales, 56, admitted to murdering Ronald Richard Penn, 61, in October 1995 more than 20 years after the case went cold.</p>

<p>He also confessed to convincing his brother Ross Sales to gun down his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Forgacs, 24, with a shotgun in a courthouse weeks later.</p>

<p>Sales is already serving decades in prison for raping and torturing six women and four children between 1988 and 2014.</p>

<p>NSW Supreme Court Justice Peter Garling added another eight years to his sentence on Tuesday for killing Mr Penn and soliciting the young woman's murder.</p>

<p>He will not be eligible for parole until 2052 when he will be 81 years old and his sentence will not expire until six years later.</p>

<p>Graham Thomas Sales, 56, was jailed for killing Ronald Penn, 61,  and soliciting the murder of his girlfriend 25 years ago</p>

<p>Mr Penn's death had remained a mystery and his body is yet to been found.   </p>

<p>His white Mazda van was found burnt-out in bushland in Berkeley Vale on October 27 - three days after his last confirmed sighting at Downing Centre Court where he faced a traffic offence.</p>

<p>Three men including two described as Aboriginal and one white were seen near the vicinity of Mr Penn’s van shortly after it was set alight about 10pm, and were later seen leaving in a red Ford laser, hatchback, or similar vehicle. </p>

<p>The missing man only had a few clothes and personal belongings with him when he vanished.</p>

<p>His bank accounts also lay dormant and his driving licence was never renewed, investigators said in 2015.</p>

<p>Sales said he murdered the former railway worker - who had loosely become his driver because he did not have a licence - in The Entrance North between October 23 and October 28.  </p>

<p>Ronald Penn, 61, (pictured) has never been found after vanishing from the Central Coast in October 1995</p>

<p>He's already serving a 31-year minimum term at Lithgow prison for his long history of horrifying and sadistic abuse against traumatised women and children during the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<p>Sales was found guilty of 21 offences including raping women with household objects, forcing them to eat their dinner off the floor and hogtying them and putting them face down in the bath. </p>

<p>In 2018, he was given another four years after after pleading guilty to six counts of sexual and aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, common assault and two counts of threatening the officer in charge during a fiery outburst in the witness box. </p>

<p>Days before Mr Penn vanished, he was pulled over in his Mazda car seated alongside Sales his brother Ross Sales in Charlestown, near Newcastle, according to police records. </p>

<p>Strike Force Rankmore detectives take cadaver dogs to a bushland area where Ronald Penn's burnt out vehicle was found during a search in 2014</p>

<p>Police alleged at the time they were following Ms Forgacs who had finally summoned the courage to flee his violence and had escaped to a refuge.</p>

<p>Police believe Sales tracked her down there a few days later and unsuccessfully tried to abduct her.</p>

<p>An interim apprehended violence order was taken against him, and Ms Forgacs was being transferred by car to another refuge in the Hunter Valley when the three men were pulled over near New Castle, following close behind. </p>

<p>Police charged Sales with breaching the interim apprehended violence order and a court date was set for November 21, 1995.  </p>

<p>Police believed Mr Penn was murdered before his car was found, and dumped at an unknown location and alleged the motive was to prevent him being subpoenaed and have to give evidence during the AVO proceedings. </p>

<p>Ross Sales was charged with shooting Ms Forgacs but got off on the grounds of mental illness in 1996. </p>

<p>Police began re-examining crime scenes related to Mr Penn's disappearance in 2014, but did not have a breakthrough until Strike Force Rankmore detectives finally managed to get Ross Sales, then 43, to confess to his involvement in both crimes.</p>

<p>He was charged and later convicted of being an accessory after the fact to Mr Penn’s death.</p>
