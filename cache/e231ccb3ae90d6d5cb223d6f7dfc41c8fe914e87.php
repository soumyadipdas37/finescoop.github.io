<p>'If you know my son you've probably heard him say, 'do you know my dad is Dean Jones?' Proud is an understatement! He adores him and will no doubt live his life with a bat and ball his hand,' Ms Hamilton wrote on Sunday.</p>

<p>She also shared a heartbreaking photo of Koby kissing a golf ball with Deano 324 written on it.</p>

<p>'When I open my eyes will I see you again? #ripdad,' the photo was captioned. </p>

<p>'It's an awful time for his wife and his other kids. I'm not trying to step out of line. I want to speak to you for Koby,' she said.</p>

<p>'I don't want Koby to go to school and for kids to say, ''we didn't see you''. How do we know you were his son. He deserves acknowledgement.'</p>

<p>In the wake of Jones' passing, Koby told Ms Hamilton: 'It's OK, Mum. I know my dad loved me.' </p>

<p>Ms Hamilton said the father and son spoke as recently as two days before Jones' death. </p>

<p>He would video call his son daily and the duo would discuss all things sport. </p>

<p>Ms Hamilton added Jones will always be her son's hero. </p>

<p>Ms Hamilton initially shared her tale on A Current Affair in 2010 and Jones confirmed the child was his.</p>

<p>After a preview for Ms Hamilton's interview with A Current Affair in 2010 referenced a romance with a mystery 'retired cricketer', Jones came out to set the record straight.</p>

<p>'I can confirm that I am the retired cricketer referred to in the A Current Affair preview last night (Friday),' he said in a statement.</p>

<p>'Following an on-and-off relationship with a women (sic), a child was conceived and subsequently delivered. I can also confirm I have supported the mother and child more generously than was agreed.</p>

<p>'At no stage have I not met my obligations.</p>

<p>'My immediate aim is to seek the forgiveness and understanding of family.' </p>
