<p>Beginning at the end of June, she starred on the six-part Facebook Watch docuseries Unfiltered: Paris Jackson &amp; Gabriel Glenn, which detailed her musical career in the wake of her father's death in 2009, as well as her relationship with Gabriel, with whom she collaborates in the duo The Soundflowers.</p>

<p>The two released their first self-titled EP in June, consisting of five songs.</p>

<p>It's over: Her outing followed reports earlier that she had split from her boyfriend Gabriel Glenn, though the breakup was described as 'amicable,' according to TMZ; seen in 2018</p>

<p>During the documentary series, Paris also delved into her sexuality and admitted that she had 'dated more women than men.'</p>

<p>However, she resisted the term bisexual, which she didn't fully encompassed her attractions.</p>

<p>'I've dated more than just men and women; I've dated a man that had a vagina,' she explained.</p>

<p>Since her breakup, Paris has regularly been spotted heading into a studio to record new music, though it's not clear if she's working with The Soundflowers or on solo material.</p>

<p>Early this month, she posted two photos of herself on a studio floor as she played guitar with the rocker. </p>

<p>'thank you for the most incredible and unforgettable experience,' she captioned the photos of their collaboration.</p>

<p>'It was an absolute honour to create with you guys, especially on a project so vulnerable and raw and close to my heart. I poured my soul into these songs when I wrote them, and you guys took it to a level I could have never even imagined,' she said, while also tagging band members and producers Robert McDowell, Jamie Martens and Dan Hannon.</p>

<p> 'The kindness, thoughtfulness, and love you guys exhibited is beyond my ability to describe. Not to mention it’s rare and a total privilege for an amateur musician to be able to say she got to work with her heroes on her first album. I am eternally grateful,' she concluded.</p>

<p>So far, Paris hasn't revealed when her fans will get a chance to hear her new tracks. </p>
