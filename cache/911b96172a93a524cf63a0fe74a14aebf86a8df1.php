<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian tennis star Ash Barty has made the 'difficult' decision to pull out of the French Open grand slam due to ongoing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The women's world number one will not defend her crown at Roland Garros after she also opted to miss the US Open currently being played in New York without crowds.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old Australian said the main reasons for her decision where the health risks associated with COVID-19 and her interrupted preparation. </p>

<p>The Queenslander has been unable to work with her coach recently because of domestic state border closures in Australia. </p>

<p>Ash Barty (pictured after winning the 2019 French Open) will not defend grand slam crown</p>

<p>'Last year´s French Open was the most special tournament of my career so this is not a decision I have made lightly,' Barty announced on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'I wish the players and the French Federation all the best for a successful tournament.'</p>

<p>The delayed grand slam starts at Roland Garros on September 27. </p>

<p>Barty will turn her attention to on a long pre-season and southern hemisphere summer. </p>

<p>Australia closed its borders in March with international travel still heavily restricted after the federal government recently extended its overseas travel ban until at least December.  </p>

<p>Ash Barty (pictured with partner Garry Kissick) also recently pulled out of the US Open</p>

<p>Australian Open organisers remain confident the season-opening grand slam will go ahead as scheduled in January.</p>

<p>'I now look forward to a long preseason and the summer in Australia. It has been a challenging year for everyone and although I am disappointed on a tennis front, the health and well-being of my family and my team will always be my priority,' Barty added.</p>

<p>Barty hasn't played a competitive match since February, shortly after her shock semi-final loss to Sofia Kenin at the Australian Open in January.</p>
