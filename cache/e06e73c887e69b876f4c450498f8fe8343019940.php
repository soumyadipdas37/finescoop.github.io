<p>A Victorian woman in her 20s, who tried to travel through Adelaide Airport to Alice Springs without correct permission, tested positive in hotel quarantine late on Friday.</p>

<p>She had arrived from Melbourne on a Jetstar flight on Thursday along with four of her cousins.</p>

<p>Wastewater testing in South Australia has picked up evidence of coronavirus at two treatment plants, as the state records a new case for the first time in 12 days</p>

<p>A patient is tested at a COVID-19 mobile testing site at Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in Adelaide</p>

<p>'We were not expecting this person to be coming into South Australia,' Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier told reporters on Saturday.</p>

<p>'In fact, our normal procedure would have been to book a flight and send her back to Victoria but given she had four young people with her, we elected to put her in a medi-hotel.'</p>

<p>The woman had no virus symptoms and further testing was being done to determine if it was an old infection, Professor Spurrier said.</p>

<p>She also said the woman likely had no close contacts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one of the positive sewerage tests came from a treatment plant at Bolivar, which has a catchment of 700,000 properties, including Adelaide's CBD where virus patients have been kept in hotels.</p>

<p>The other positive test came from Angaston in the Barossa Valley, covering about 2000 properties.</p>

<p>People wait outside the Tanunda War Memorial Hospital, a dedicated COVID-19 testing clinic to deal with the expected uptick in cases in the Barossa Valley</p>

<p>Prof Spurrier said the results did not necessarily point to community transmission and further wastewater testing will be carried in days to come.</p>

<p>'We can't trace that back and say there is definitely people in these areas with COVID-19,' she said.</p>

<p>'It doesn't mean we have an infectious case out there but we certainly couldn't rule that out.'</p>

<p>The virus was excreted in faeces for a 'prolonged period' after someone tested positive, she said.</p>

<p>South Australia was cleared of active cases on Wednesday.</p>
