<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New Liverpool signing Thiago Alcantara made more passes than every Chelsea player on his Premier League debut - despite only playing 45 minutes. </p>

<p>The Spanish midfielder was a half-time substitute for injured captain Jordan Henderson and was on the pitch as two Sadio Mane goals gave Jurgen Klopp's side the win over the 10-man Blues. </p>

<p>The 29-year-old is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world and specialises in progressing the ball from deep with accurate and simple passes. </p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara made more passes than any Chelsea star even though he played 45 minutes</p>

<p>And according to Opta, Thiago made 75 passes in the second-half, which not only outpassed Chelsea's players but is also the most passes by a player who played 45 minutes or fewer since passing data was recorded.</p>

<p>Thiago joined the Premier League champions earlier this week and reportedly only had one training session before the Stamford Bridge showdown. </p>

<p>The Spaniard moved from European champions Bayern Munich for a £25million fee having won the last seven Bundesliga titles with the German giants and played in the last month's Champions League final win over Paris Saint-Germain.  </p>

<p>The Spanish midfielder made his Liverpool debut in the Reds' 2-0 win over Chelsea on Sunday</p>

<p>The midfielder broke the Premier League record for the most passes by a substitute</p>

<p>Thiago started the Chelsea match on the substitutes' bench but was forced onto the field after Henderson felt a 'tight thigh' during the opening period.  </p>

<p>The midfielder's debut  was aided by Andreas Christensen's red card just before half-time with the Blues defender pulling down Sadio Mane when played through on goal by Henderson. </p>

<p>The Danish defender was initially showed a yellow card by Paul Tierney but the decision was reversed after a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) check. </p>

<p>Mane then gave Klopp's side the lead just after half-time with a superb header from Roberto Firmino's cross. </p>

<p>The Liverpool winger then doubled the advantage after he picked up on Kepa Arrizabalaga's slack pass to tap into an empty net. </p>
