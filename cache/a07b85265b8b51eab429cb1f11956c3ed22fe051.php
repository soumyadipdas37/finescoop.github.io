<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A suspect has been taken into custody for allegedly sending a package containing the poison ricin to Donald Trump. </p>

<p>The package addressed to the president was intercepted by law enforcement earlier this week.</p>

<p>All packages addressed to the White House are sorted and screened at a secure offsite facility prior to delivery. </p>

<p>Two law enforcement sources told CNN that two tests were done to confirm the presence of ricin.</p>

<p>The envelope to the White House was caught at the final offsite processing facility where mail is screened before being sent to the White House mail room. </p>

<p>Investigators believe that it was sent from Canada, a law enforcement official told the New York Times. </p>

<p>The Secret Service has intercepted a package addressed to Trump containing deadly ricin</p>

<p>Ricin is a highly potent toxin derived from castor beans, and is extremely lethal if inhaled or injected, but less so if ingested. Inhaling a dose the size of a few grains of salt can be lethal to adults. </p>

<p>'The F.B.I. and our U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Postal Inspection Service partners are investigating a suspicious letter received at a U.S. government mail facility,' the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement to the Times. 'At this time, there is no known threat to public safety.' </p>

<p>Deadly ricin has previously been used to target American politicians through the mail.</p>

<p>In 2014, actress Shannon Richardson, who appeared on The Walking Dead, was convicted of sending envelopes containing ricin addressed to then President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p>

<p>She was sentenced to 18 years in prison. </p>

<p>All packages addressed to the White House are sorted and screened at a secure offsite facility prior to delivery</p>

<p>Ricin was also featured in a multi-season plot arc in the television series Breaking Bad, which inspired several real-life criminal schemes involving the poison.</p>

<p>In 2014, Georgetown University student Daniel Milzman pleaded guilty to a federal charge after a bag of ricin was found in his dorm room. </p>

<p>Prosecutors say he had planned to use it on another student he had formerly been in a relationship with. He was sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison. </p>
