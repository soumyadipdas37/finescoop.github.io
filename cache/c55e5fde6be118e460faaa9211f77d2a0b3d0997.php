<p>Gus, a one-year-old golden retriever from Orlando, Florida, sits waiting for a head scratch with a black expression on his face</p>

<p>The video shows Gus grinning from ear to ear as Shelby uses an extendable back scratcher from Amazon to gently massage his head. </p>

<p>The handheld device has a claw shaped 'hand' which Shelby uses to scratch the top of Gus' head.</p>

<p>Hilariously, as soon as his Shelby stops, Gus returns to a rather blank expression. </p>

<p>But he resumes his broad smile as soon as she starts scratching his head again.    </p>

<p>Gus is already a popular online personality with a following of over 12,500 on his Instagram account. </p>

<p>He grins broadly from ear to ear as soon as his owner Shelby begins to scratch the top of his head using an extendable back scratcher from Amazon</p>

<p>Apart from head scratches, the adorable pup also enjoys dock diving, swimming and a good game of fetch.</p>

<p>He is always keen to eat lots of snacks and is very fond of a good head scrub, too.  </p>

<p>Gus' owner Shelby said: 'I have had Gus since he was 8 weeks old.</p>

<p>'It's been so surreal watching this video go viral and seeing all the comments and shares. </p>

<p>'I absolutely love seeing how a short 25-second clip that I filmed on a whim, has brought so much joy to so many people.'</p>
