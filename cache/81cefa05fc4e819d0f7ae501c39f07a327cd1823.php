<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A drug arrest is now made in Australia every three and a half minutes, as surging supply of narcotics pushes the value of the illicit trade to a record $3.5billion per year.</p>

<p>About 26.6 tonnes of illicit substances were seized by police between 2018 and 2019, according to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission's Illicit Drug Data report released on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Figures showed that ice is by far the most consumed illegal drug across the nation, followed by MDMA, cocaine and heroin, with a police seizure every five minutes nationwide.</p>

<p>The report found that the weight of seized amphetamine-type substances (ATS) was more than double that of cannabis, heroin and cocaine combined, and the ACIC estimates that 11.5 tonnes of ice is consumed in Australia annually.</p>

<p>That compared to 4.6 tonnes of cocaine and 941,000 kilograms of heroin. </p>

<p>There were 136,242 arrests for drugs in 2018-19, with 102,352 or 75 per cent of them being men.  </p>

<p>In 2018–19 new records were set. These include: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>5.1 tonnes of amphetamines at the Australian border.</p></li>
<li><p>5,378 national cocaine seizures. </p></li>
<li><p>5,016 national cocaine arrests 1,029 national hallucinogen arrests.</p></li>
<li><p>1,363 anaesthetic detections at the Australian border.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>ACIC chief executive officer Michael Phelan said the market for anesthetics, such as the tranquiliser ketamine and the depressant GHB, were also on the rise.</p>

<p>He added: 'The number of detections of anaesthetics at the Australian border increased 1,934 per cent over the last decade.' </p>

<p>New South Wales residents remain the largest consumers of all drugs, particularly cocaine which accounted for 67 per cent of arrests and more than half the national total. </p>

<p>According to the report, one of the reasons for the surge in drug-related activity is a result of the online market.</p>

<p>It said darknet markets are appealing to buyers because they can undertake transactions remotely and remain anonymous.</p>

<p>The online market also provides a greater variety of stock and the ability to adjust pricing.</p>

<p>The weight of illicit drugs seized nationally increased 241 per cent and the number of national drug-related arrests increased 80 per cent with 153,377 arrests from 2018 to 2019. </p>

<p>Police charged four men following an investigation into an alleged criminal syndicate involved in the supply of cocaine, methylamphetamine and prohibited weapons across Sydney in May</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the number of national illicit drug seizures increased by 77 per cent.  </p>

<p>'These upward trends in national seizures and arrests highlight the continued vigilance of law enforcement in reducing the supply of all illicit drugs,' Mr Phelan said. </p>

<p>'They also highlight why illicit drugs continue to be a concern for law enforcement and the wider community, and the ongoing need to reduce demand.'  </p>
