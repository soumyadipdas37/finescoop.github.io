<p>The UK postal service has faced resistance over plans to deliver fewer letters and refocus its energy on its parcel delivery service - which has boomed during lockdown.</p>

<p>There's still a demand for an affordable next-day letters service from businesses Monday to Friday, executives discovered after thousands of customer surveys and staff meetings. </p>

<p>But the Saturday service is not considered a 'core offering' and could be scrapped amid plans to expand on profits made during a boost to parcel delivery amid coronavirus.</p>

<p>Royal Mail has faced resistance over plans to deliver fewer letters and refocus its energy on its parcel delivery service - which has boomed during lockdown. Pictured, a postman in Manchester on April 8</p>

<p>Its delivery vans took 177m more parcels to front doors as the lockdown sparked a boom in online shopping.</p>

<p>Shares soared by 25 per cent, or 43.7p, to 218.3p as the dramatic increase in parcel deliveries pushed up revenues by £139million. </p>

<p>The postal service has seen a 1.1billion drop in demand for letters year-on-year in the five months to the end of August. </p>

<p>During an annual shareholders meeting yesterday a seven-day parcel delivery service was discussed.</p>

<p>'This does not mean following other countries such as New Zealand or Italy that have reduced letters delivery to three days a week in some areas,' Keith Williams, interim executive chairman at Royal Mail, said in a letter to staff seen by The Guardian.</p>

<p>'We will keep delivering letters to every part of the UK, for one price. And we would like to deliver the items that customers want more often, not less.' </p>

<p>As a universal service Royal Mail has to deliver to every address in the UK, six days a week, at a standard price.</p>

<p>Ofcom, the service's regulator, is currently conducting a review into what customers need from the Royal Mail. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a planned shakeup of the service could see 2,000 managers axed to cut £130million from its annual wage bill.</p>

<p>It plans to get rid of 'old, outdated ways of working' and replace them with automatic clocking in and out for postal workers instead of handwritten sign-in sheets.</p>

<p>It also plans to get rid of old sorting machines.   </p>

<p>Warning of a 'material loss' this year, Royal Mail said that the unit 'will not become profitable without substantial business change'.</p>

<p>But it is struggling to secure the backing of its two unions – the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents frontline postal staff, and Unite, which represents management.</p>

<p>Royal Mail is in dispute with the CWU which has threatened a national strike over changes to working conditions.</p>

<p>This has plunged the group into crisis and contributed to the departure former chief executive Rico Back, who was ousted this year with a £1million pay-off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Unite is battling plans to lay off around 2,000 of its 9,700 management staff. Royal Mail insisted the discussions with unions have made 'good progress', but a full agreement has still not been reached.</p>

<p>In a statement before its annual meeting with shareholders it said: 'Too many parcels are sorted by hand and we are failing to adapt our business to fundamentally lower letter volumes and holding on to outdated working practices and a delivery structure that no longer meets customer needs.' </p>
