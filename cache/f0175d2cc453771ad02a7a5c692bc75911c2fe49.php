<p>The sleepover will have fans speculating that Maura and Chris are more than just friends, which they have denied in the past. </p>

<p>Maura recently told The Sun's Fabulous magazine that she has not had sex for six months due to the coronavirus lockdown. </p>

<p>She said: 'I 100 per cent feel the sexiest of my life. I'm getting sexy for my new man! Now I definitely feel like I'm ready to be with somebody.</p>

<p>'I'm 100 per cent single and ready to mingle. God help the next man I meet. I'm not sure he'll be able to put up with me!'</p>

<p>Chris previously addressed the rumours about him and Maura on Vicky Pattison's The Secret To podcast.  </p>

<p>The Geordie Shore star asked him if there was any truth to the fan theories that they were together but he bluntly replied: 'No, no, we're not.'   </p>

<p>But Vicky didn't back down, telling him that the pair would make the 'best couple'. He replied: 'Yeah, potentially. We've never really thought about it like that, we're just super close mates.</p>

<p>'We like each other and the thing is, it's never been something that's crossed our minds and it wouldn't happen for the fact that we don't want to ruin our friendship.</p>

<p>'We don't see each other that way. We're platonic, as they say, platonic friends.'  </p>

<p>Maura had previously been dating Curtis Pritchard, who she split from in March, while Chris was most recently in a relationship with Harley Brash.</p>
