<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The ex-mistress of Spain's scandal hit former King Juan Carlos I has opened up about their tumultuous relationship and admitted she avoided his children because meeting them made her 'uncomfortable'. </p>

<p>Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, 56, who lives in London, had an affair with the 82-year-old royal between 2004 and 2009. </p>

<p>Juan Carlos, who is married to Queen Sofia, 81, left his homeland in August after it was claimed he allegedly received millions of euros from Saudi Arabia's late King Abdullah.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Swiss prosecutors are examining a £59 million (€65 million) payment Juan Carlos made to Sayn-Wittgenstein in 2012 under suspicion of money laundering. </p>

<p>Speaking to French magazine Paris Match, Corinna denied all allegations of wrongdoing and opened up about her affair with Juan Carlos. </p>

<p>Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, 56, who resides in London, had an affair with Juan Carlos I from 2004 to 2009. She told French Magazine Paris Match she tried to avoid meeting his children because it made her uncomfortable. Picture: The former couple with architect Manfred Osterwald in Stuttgart in 2006</p>

<p>The Danish-born businesswoman recalled meeting her lover's son Felipe VI - then heir to the throne - and his wife Letizia in 2007.</p>

<p>She said the future king was 'embarrassed' by the encounter, but his wife was 'charming'.</p>

<p>'I met Felipe in 2007 at an award ceremony for the Spanish sport charity Laureus, which I'm involved in,' she said.  </p>

<p>'Felipe looked embarrassed but Letizia was absolutely charming. I was with my son, who was then five-years-old and when he arrived, the King [Juan Carlos I] took him in his arms. He was not trying to hide anything.' </p>

<p>Corinna claimed to have met the then heir to the Spanish throne and his wife in 2007 at a charity event (pictured: Felipe VI and Letizia at Zarzuela Palace in February 2020)</p>

<p>She also recounted meeting Felipe's sister, Infanta Christina, and her husband Inaki Urdangari, as well as his other sister Infanta Elena. </p>

<p>'I never looked to socialise with them, it made me uncomfortable,' Corinna admitted. 'I avoided contact with them as much as possible.'</p>

<p>Corinna said Juan Carlos's children knew their parents were living separate lives and slept in separate beds, each occupying different apartments at Zarzuela Palace. </p>

<p>She claimed her affair with Juan Carlos evolved into 'close friendship' following the end of their romantic involvement in 2009.    </p>

<p>Corinna's relationship with the then King of Spain was catapulted into the limelight in 2012 after he broke his hip during a safari trip to Botswana, on which she had accompanied him. </p>

<p>Remembering their ill-fated hunting holiday to Botswana eight years ago, Corinna told the BBC back in August: 'I wasn't keen on going on this trip... I felt that King Juan Carlos was trying to get me to come back to him, and I didn't want to give a false impression. I almost had premonitions about this trip.' </p>

<p>She concluded that the media circus which followed was masterminded by the royal establishment, who wanted to 'speed up an abdication' and have her out of the picture.</p>

<p>'From the moment I came back from that trip I was under full-blown surveillance,' Corinna told the BBC. 'This was the beginning of a campaign to paint me as this Wallis Simpson, Lady Macbeth, evil character who'd led this wonderful man astray on this trip during a big economic crisis.'</p>

<p>She alleged that the Centro Internacional de Inteligencia (CNI), Spanish intelligence, began harassing her.</p>

<p>First, she claimed, her Monaco apartment was ransacked and then on a business trip to Brazil she believes she was tailed.</p>

<p>Corinna said an anonymous threat was made about there being 'many tunnels between Monaco and Nice' - a reference to Princess Diana's fatal car crash.</p>

<p>Furthermore, she claimed a book about the British royal's death was left in the living room of her Swiss apartment.</p>

<p>After the Botswana trip, she claimed Juan Carlos 'gifted' her €65 million (£59 million) out of guilt for the 'intense pressure' she came under and as an expression of his love.</p>

<p>That colossal transfer of funds is now the subject of a Swiss inquiry. </p>

<p>The former king, who abdicated in 2014, is under investigation by Spain's supreme court over corruption allegations which centre on a $100million payment by the late king of Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>At the start of this month, Juan Carlos announced he was leaving Spain and it has recently emerged that he is staying in Abu Dhabi.</p>
