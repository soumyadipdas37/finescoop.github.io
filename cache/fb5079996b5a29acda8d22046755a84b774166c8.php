<p>Low-key glamour: Keeping things casual, the 41-year-old presenter kept things casual in a boxy white blouse and skinny jeans as she nipped out to pick up some lunch</p>

<p>Finishing touches: The mother-of-one accessorised with a delicate crucifix necklace, a Chanel handbag and studded black sandals</p>

<p>She confessed: 'I generally follow the motto of eating like a king, then a prince, then a pauper, as the day goes on, and I need a good breakfast.' </p>

<p>Christine revealed that she has also been following Joe Wicks aka The Body Coach's recipes during the coronavirus pandemic, and has no doubt kept fit running around after her daughter Patricia, 12 months, who she shares with husband Frank.  </p>

<p>Under cover: Christine made sure she kept her face mask to hand on the outing </p>

<p>Brunette beauty: Christine wore her glossy raven locks swept back into a bun, with her sunglasses perched on top </p>

<p>The Chelsea coach has been married to Christine since 2015, and he recently told The High Performance Podcast that she offers him sensible advice about how to manage his team.</p>

<p>Frank - who also starred for Chelsea before he turned to coaching - said: 'She definitely coaches me. And I do throw a lot of things off Christine.</p>

<p>'She's not picking what fullback we're going to play that weekend, but at the same time, if I have certain issues which are life issues, and actually football issues sometimes, I can definitely go home [and ask].</p>

<p>'It's a different view, a different opinion.'</p>

<p>Yum: Christine seemed in good spirits as she popped into burger joint Five Guys for lunch, bringing the food back home with her</p>

<p>Treat yourself: Although takeaways are a rare treat for the star, she recently told The Telegraph that her eating habits start to slip throughout the day</p>

<p>Frank admits he values Christine's outlook on some of the situations he faces on a day-to-day basis, and the former England star is happy to approach his wife for tips.</p>

<p>He said: 'Sometimes, I go, "Christine, what do you think about this problem? I've got a player here and he didn't turn up for training yesterday. But we still probably need him on the weekend, what do you think?"</p>

<p>'And she goes, "Does he have a girlfriend, a wife? Is there a problem? Have you spoken to them? Maybe you should speak to them." And I'm like, "yeah". I'm very fortunate to have someone to bounce things off of at home.'</p>

<p>Cute couple: After spending lockdown together, the couple have recently been resuming work, with Christine presenting daytime shows and Frank rebuilding the Chelsea squad</p>
