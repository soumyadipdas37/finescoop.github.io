<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris Hilton insists that until a recent trip to Greece with her boyfriend Carter Reum, she hadn't taken a vacation since she was 15 years old — but countless photos of her in swimsuits taken over the last two and a half decades tell a different story.</p>

<p>In her new YouTube documentary, This is Paris, the 39-year-old star said: 'My last vacation was probably when I was 15. With my family. It's just been nonstop work.'</p>

<p>But Paris has spent decades in the spotlight — and in front of cameras, which have captured her enjoying the beach in Hawaii, Spain, the UK, Indonesia, Italy and Mexico.</p>

<p>Bending the truth? Paris Hilton said in her new documentary that her 'last vacation was probably when I was 15,' but she has been pictured at the beach quite a lot over the years — including in Hawaii in 2010 (pictured) </p>

<p>2001 and 2002: In 2001, the socialite was pictured partying in Cannes (left), and she celebrated her 21st birthday with a party in London in 2002 (right)</p>

<p>2003: Though she may have been paid to take a few international trips, like this one to the Carling Reading Festival, her claims that she hasn't vacationed in decades have raised some eyebrows</p>

<p>2004: Paris is pictured in a Louis Vuitton bikini in Miami 16 years ago. She was there with her dogs and her then-boyfriend Simon Rex</p>

<p>2005 and 2006: In 2005, Paris spent Christmas in Hawaii, where she cooled off in the ocean (left), while 2006's Christmas trip was to Sydney, Australia (right)</p>

<p>2007 and 2008: Paris has spent lots of Christmases in Hawaii, including in 2007 (left), while she and a friend strolled Bondi Beach in Australia in 2008 (right)</p>

<p>2009: Paris donned a blue bikini in Maui with her then-boyfriend Doug Reinhardt</p>

<p>In her documentary, Paris is shown taking a trip to Mykonos with Carter, where she enjoys luxury accommodations, a beautiful pool, and boat rides at sunset.</p>

<p>She says that it was her first vacation since she was a teenager, but she 'felt like I needed to do this for myself or I'm going to lose it.'</p>

<p>Viewers, though, were quick to insist that Paris' claims don't add up.</p>

<p>'You nearly had me feeling sorry for Paris Hilton (even after she spilled $100 bills all over the subway or whatever) until she said she hadn’t been on a “real vacation” since she was 15 lol ok sure,' wrote one Twitter user. </p>

<p>DailyMail.com commenters had similar feelings, with one writing: 'ALL she does is vacation.'</p>

<p>'You don't need one when your life is one big one!!!' said another, while one more wrote that 'her life is a holiday.'</p>

<p>'Give me a break.....Permanent holiday if you ask me,' wrote yet another. </p>

<p>In doubt: Twitters users and DailyMail.com commenters argued that all Paris does is vacation</p>

<p>'We have seen [her on] hundreds of vacations. She got proposed to skiing on a mountain. Next,' one more commenter pointed out. </p>

<p>'I like Paris, but she must have a different idea of work and vacations than I do, because I'm pretty sure I see pictures of her several times a year on yachts, at beaches, skiing, on an island...' wrote another.</p>

<p>Paris' definition of 'vacation' does seem to be quite a bit different from most people's. </p>

<p>Over the course of her career, she has been all over the world — in fact, she says, she travels 250 days a year — and in many of her stops, she takes time to unwind in the beach or by the pool.</p>

<p>Countless photos show her in bikinis and one-pieces in dozens of glamorous locations. </p>

<p>Others show her partying in nightclubs around the world, enjoying music festivals, and soaking up the sun from boats and yachts.</p>

<p>2011: Though Paris insists she hasn't vacationed, it would be hard to argue she was working when she rode jetskis in Hawaii with her friend DJ Afrojacks in November 2011</p>

<p>2012 and 2013: Paris and then-boyfriend River Viiperi went swimming at the Fontainebleau in Miami in 2012 (left); the next year, they swam on the Spanish isle of Formentera</p>

<p>2014: Paris was back on Formentera island in 2014. She also shared photos of herself on a boat enjoying a mud bath on the trip</p>

<p>2015 and 2016: Paris didn't appear to be working on the beach in Bali, Indonesia in 2015 (left), nor did her time in Formentera with friends in 2016 seem like a job</p>

<p>2017: Paris splashed around in the sea on the Almalfi Coast in Italy in 2017</p>

<p>2018: Even her engagement to ex Chris Zylka was cemented on a vacation to Aspen in 2018</p>

<p>2019: She and her boyfriend Carter Reum took a holiday to Mykonos last year, which she said was her first vacation since age 15</p>

<p>2020: As recently as this month, she and Carter enjoyed time by the pool in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</p>

<p>But because Paris may have traveled to several of these locales for work engagements, the heiress doesn't appear to consider her downtime there as 'vacation' time.</p>

<p>In addition to enjoying sun, sand, and water in Miami, Sydney, and Bali, Paris has also been photographed skiing quite a few times over the years.</p>

<p>She had been frequently seen on the slopes in Aspen, Colorado, and her ex Chris Zylka even proposed to her on a ski trip there in 2018.</p>

<p>In August, she was photographed on a boat with Carter in Traverse City, Michigan, and she wrote on Instagram: '#LakeLife is beautiful.'</p>

<p>And as recently as this month, she and Carter enjoyed time by the pool in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.</p>
