<p>A disability support worker grabbed her neighbour through a gate and pulled 'hair from her skull' following an early morning noise complaint.</p>

<p>Kerry-Jane Dent, 47, pleaded guilty to trespass and assault occasioning bodily harm in company after the incident at Logan Village, south of Brisbane, on March 8.</p>

<p>Police were called to Dent's property at about 2.30am following reports a man and a woman had been shouting, Quest Newspapers reported.</p>

<p>The Beenleigh Magistrates Court heard the mother-of-four was 'grossly intoxicated' and 'barely able to converse'. </p>

<p>She told police: 'That w***e next door made the complaint, I'm going to smash her'.   </p>

<p>At about 4am, the victim woke to noise out the front of her home and when she went to investigate the disruption she found Dent and another person. </p>

<p>The woman walked to her front gate and told Dent and her companion to leave the premises. </p>

<p>She was standing about one-metre from the gate when Dent reached through and pulled the victim into it. </p>

<p>Dent then pushed her neighbour to the ground and pulled strands of hair from the victim's skull.  </p>

<p>Dent's daughter arrived at the scene and pleaded with her mum to go home, while the victim's son came out of the home and tried to break up the scuffle.</p>

<p>He pushed Dent away from the barrier and the 47-year-old fell backwards. </p>

<p>Dent grabbed her neighbour through a gate and pulled 'hair from her skull' following an early morning noise complaint</p>

<p>The person who attended the property with Dent was 'screaming profanities' and shook the gate 'violently'. </p>

<p>The pair were eventually moved on by Dent's daughter. </p>

<p>On Monday, the court heard there had been long-established tension between Dent and one of her neighbours.  </p>

<p>Dent had no criminal history and lost her job following the incident. </p>

<p>Defence lawyer Katherine Hanson told the court the clash left both parties 'battered and bruised' as there was 'summary justice'.   </p>

<p>Ms Hanson said her client held a family gathering preceding the incident and 'would not have acted as she did' if she had not consumed alcohol.  </p>

<p>Dent has not had alcohol since, Ms Hanson said.   </p>

<p>The incident was labelled 'very ugly' by Magistrate Clare Kelly, who said the scuffle would have cause significant distress for the children who became involved.   </p>

<p>Dent, who now lives at Redbank Plains, was placed on a nine-month probation order and no convictions were recorded.</p>

<p>The person who was with her on the night was fined for trespassing.</p>
