<p>But the 32-year-old country singer shared on Monday that even though she works out every day to look her best, she really doesn't like hitting the gym.</p>

<p>'Gonna be honest... I hate working out. I dread it. I’m one of those girls that watches the clock and counts down to the last second when I can be done,' said the beauty who has been married to former American football wide receiver Eric Decker since 2013. </p>

<p>She does it to stay healthy: Jessie James Decker has one of the most toned bodies on Instagram. But the 32-year-old country singer shared on Monday that even though she works out every day to look her best, she really doesn't like hitting the gym</p>

<p>'I wish I enjoyed it. I wish I was a big workout junkie but the truth is I just don’t!'</p>

<p>The mother of three then added: 'I do know that in order to achieve a strong body that I want to have and maintain I MUST put the hard work into it.'</p>

<p>And people come to her for advice often: 'Everyone asks me all the time what kind of work out I do and what I eat. As far as work outs I’ll be real, I hate running so I don’t do much of that.'</p>

<p>Decker then said: 'I do enjoy lifting weights and quick circuit training. I love the stairmaster, I love nice long walks (lunges are key, I do 100 at a time). I work out a few times a week and usually no more than 40 minutes time.'</p>

<p>Her truth: 'I wish I enjoyed it. I wish I was a big workout junkie but the truth is I just don’t!' she said to her followers</p>

<p>'But the biggest factor is watching what I EAT and making sure whatever I’m putting in my body is going to make me feel strong and energized.'</p>

<p>The author then shared: 'I’m really excited to share that in my cookbook <?php echo e('@'); ?>justfeedme I have an ENTIRE chapter on what I eat in a day and recipes to share with you on what it is I eat on a daily basis to maintain. </p>

<p>'It’s high protein low carbs and these recipes are absolutely delicious that you won’t even feel like you’re watching your fitness!!!'</p>

<p>Looking fab for the camera: She also shared several behind the scenes shots from her latest photo shoot</p>

<p>She said she was 'proud' of this chapter in particular because it’s something her fans have been asking her to share for a long time.</p>

<p>Jessie also noted she was in a Kittenish bikini. She founded her clothing line Kittenish in 2018.  </p>

<p>Jessie is hunkering down with her hunky husband Eric Decker, an ex-NFL player who has been in the Denver Broncos, New York Jets and Tennessee Titans.</p>

<p>They are joined in lockdown by their three children - six-year-old Vivienne, four-year-old Eric Jr. and two-year-old Forrest.</p>

<p>In June Jessie revealed little Forrest suffered bug bite, which developed a boil that had to be removed at the hospital.</p>

<p>She explained that the bite 'turned into a staph which turned into a boil! It was like a golf ball it was so hard and he was in so much pain.'</p>

<p>The mother-of-three wrote: 'He got a very high fever and we had to take him to the emergency room late night. Obviously with covid only I could I go in with him. They had to sedate him and cut it open and get it all out.'</p>

<p>Glowing: Here the siren was seen in a bikini from her Kittenish line while at home by her pool</p>

<p>Look of love: The crooner  is hunkering down with her hunky husband Eric Decker, an ex-NFL player who has been in the Denver Broncos, New York Jets and Tennessee Titans</p>

<p>She added: 'He handled it like a champ but it was so sad to see him in so much pain! I could not believe this happened. It was such a freak thing. He got in an antiobiotic and that helped big time.'</p>

<p>Jessie and Eric married in June 2013 at the St. Francis Of Assisi Church in the Colorado town of Castle Rock.</p>

<p>The family currently live in Nashville, Tennessee, the capital of the country music industry that made Jessie a star.</p>

<p>They relocated to a house in Music City last year that Jessie told People was her 'forever home,' gushing that it 'checks off every item on the wish list.</p>
