<p>'Much-loved husband and father' Kenneth Hawker, 68, collapsed after he was involved in what police describe as a 'serious altercation' with a car driver.</p>

<p>The man, in his 50s, was arrested at the scene and released under investigation after the incident in Middle Market Road, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.</p>

<p>Mrs Hawker said in a statement: 'Time was irrelevant because of the Covid-lockdown.</p>

<p>'But sometime around lunch-time we decided to go out for our daily exercise and some shopping.</p>

<p>'There was a car parked on the pavement with the passenger door open.</p>

<p>'We walked through the gap and were just passed when a woman said, "It would've taken two seconds to walk around".</p>
