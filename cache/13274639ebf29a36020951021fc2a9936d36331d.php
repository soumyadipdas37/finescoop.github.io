<p>Olivia's revelation left Nicole Bass and Clelia Theodorou in shock with the former Love Islander having to tell them to not cry and struggling not to give them a hug, which she couldn't do due to social distancing rules.</p>

<p>Before walking away, Olivia said: 'The last year has been amazing, so many highs and some of the best times of life. Some people are going to miss me, and some not so much. </p>

<p>And while sitting around the pool with the girls, Olivia explained that things with Brad were 'really good' with them wanting to move house and plan their wedding.</p>

<p>However she added: 'We need to prioritise our time, I can't choose house while I'm down in Essex all the time running around sometimes behaving like a bit of an idiot... </p>

<p>'I've got my fiancé in Manchester and should be by his side really, not drinking in pub gardens arguing with little girls.</p>

<p>'It's a real dilemma in my mind, I ned to work out what my priorities are and if they're in the right place... I need to think, I feel like I'm here there and everywhere and right now nobody's winning.'</p>

<p>Reaction: TOWIE has received 176 Ofcom complaints after Sunday's episode which included a heated row between Olivia Attwood, 29, Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 25, and 19-year-old Chloe Brockett (pictured)</p>

<p>Accusations: Several fans took to Twitter to say they were feeling 'uncomfortable' during the scene and accused Olivia (pictured) of bullying her younger castmate</p>

<p>Olivia's comment of 'drinking in pub gardens arguing with little girls' was in reference to her recent argument with Chloe Brockett.  </p>

<p>On Sunday's show the two beauties ended up arguing when they waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex, Jack McDermott. </p>

<p>When Chloe asked Olivia why she called her a 'poisonous little creature', the former Love Island star replied: 'I thought you was vile and poisonous. You went at Clelia last year like a Jack Russell. </p>

<p>'I do feel a bit sorry for you, you haven't got any friends your own age, you're hanging around girls a lot older than you and you're angry. I don't know why you're so angry but you are.</p>

<p>Having their say: The row first occurred when the group waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex boyfriend, Jack McDermott</p>

<p>'The thing is I thought the other day "maybe was what I said a little bit too harsh" but the way you've conducted yourself, I'm bang on.'</p>

<p>Chloe told her: 'All I'm saying is, when you called me a 'poisonous little creature', you don't know me'.</p>

<p>TOWIE has since received 176 Ofcom complaints after viewers said they were left feeling 'uncomfortable' during the episode. </p>

<p>Olivia Attwood, alongside castmates Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 25, were all accused of bullying 19-year-old Chloe. </p>
