<p>Felipe Massa attempted to outrun a peregrine falcon in a Formula E car in Saudi Arabia</p>

<p>Former F1 driver Massa has switched to the electric Formula E series for the coming season</p>

<p>The peregrine falcon is capable of speeds of up to 217mph while diving for prey</p>

<p>In the race, Massa drove the electric racing car through the desert with a lure attached, attempting to evade the claws of the falcon. </p>

<p>It is the second time an FE car has raced a notoriously quick predator - last year, reigning champion Jean-Eric Vergne took on a cheetah in South Africa, and narrowly won.</p>

<p>Fans demanded a rematch against a different creature, and after social media feedback, the peregrine falcon was chosen to compete against the former Ferrari racer. </p>

<p>Massa managed to shake off the bird and complete the course with the lure unscathed</p>

<p>However man once again triumphed, as Massa managed to shake off the bird, and complete the course with the lure unscathed. </p>

<p>The Brazilian, who will race for the Leonardo Di Caprio-owned Venturi team in FE this season, said: 'It was an incredible experience for me to race against the fastest member of the animal kingdom - it's not something I will forget in a hurry.'</p>

<p>The 2018-19 FE season starts on Saturday December 15 with the Ad Diriyah ePrix n Saudi Arabia, with Massa involved for the first time after ending his F1 career with Williams.</p>

<p>He said: 'I'm looking forward to returning to Ad Diriyah and to start racing. It'll be my first race in Formula E and I'm eager to get behind the wheel again. I've missed racing and this series has shown to be one of the most competitive out there.' </p>
