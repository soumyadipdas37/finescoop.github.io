<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Georges St-Pierre does not consider Conor McGregor among the greatest MMA fighters of all time. </p>

<p>The Canadian, who is regularly chosen by fans as their pick as the best to have competed in the sport, overlooked the now retired former two-weight champion. </p>

<p>He believes Royce Gracie to be the most influential and explained to TMZ: 'Royce Gracie is the one that really changed the sport.</p>

<p>Georges St-Pierre does not consider Conor McGregor among the greatest of all time </p>

<p>'[He] changed the entire belief system of what a real fight is.'</p>

<p>The Brazilian is in the UFC Hall of Fame and was one of the company's earliest stars, popularising the style of jiu-jitsu his family have exported worldwide as an elite fighting discipline. </p>

<p>GSP then added: 'Jon Jones is there, Jon Jones I believe right now is the best guy. There's also Khabib that could be there, there's a lot of guys.</p>

<p>'But we should never forget about the guys who were there before us.</p>

<p>'They paved the way for us.'</p>

<p>The Irishman thinks he is either No 1 or second behind Anderson Silva as the greatest</p>

<p>GSP thinks Gracie changed the way most people perceived what fighting can be </p>

<p>Jones and Khabib are ranked first and second respectively in the UFC's current pound-for-pound list. </p>

<p>Jones has lost only once, from a disqualification, while Khabib remains undefeated inside the octagon. </p>

<p>Earlier this year McGregor offered his verdict on the best of all time, ranking Anderson Silva as No 1, himself No 2 and GSP in third.   </p>

<p>McGregor announced his third retirement earlier this summer having made his comeback in a win over Donald Cerrone in January. </p>

<p>Khabib Nurmagomedov (pictured) and Jon Jones are among the modern greats for GSP</p>

<p>The Irishman was recently accused of showing off his manhood and then assaulting a young married woman in a bar toilet following a heavy drinking session in the Port of Calvi, on the French island of Corsica on September 6. </p>

<p>French police raided McGregor's £3million yacht and took the UFC star away after claims he 'exhibited his private parts' to the alleged victim as she entered a bar toilet. </p>

<p>McGregor has strongly denied the recent allegations, and Emmanuelle Ramon, his lawyer, said his client 'vigorously denied any wrongdoing'.</p>
