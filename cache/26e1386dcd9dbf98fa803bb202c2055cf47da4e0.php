<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain's first 'full-scale' trial of rental e-scooters has been launched today in Milton Keynes.</p>

<p>Locals and visitors will have access to 500 of Lime's motorised vehicles to use on the road after the Government legalised e-scooter hire services last month.</p>

<p>Users will pay £1 via a smartphone app to unlock the machines and 20p a minute after, meaning half an hour would result in an £7 outlay. </p>

<p>They can also only be used on designated routes and not on any roads with speed limits higher than 30mph. </p>

<p>Swarm of e-scooters: The UK's first 'full-scale' trial of rental e-scooters has been launched today in Milton Keynes with 500 of the motorised vehicles available to hire across the town</p>

<p>The 500 Lime scooters will be available alongside 100 Spin e-scooters that have been on the streets of Milton Keynes for residents to use since Saturday.</p>

<p>Lime's e-scooters can be ridden at speeds of up to 14.8mph, though users will need to be over the age of 18 and hold at least a provisional driving licence.</p>

<p>Helmets are not a requirement, though are recommended as part of the pilot launched in partnership with Milton Keynes Council. </p>

<p>And to help new riders get to grips with the e-scooters, the provider is launching a series of 'first ride academies', which aim to teach users how to scoot and park safely and responsibly. </p>

<p>Riders will only be able to use them on minor roads and the Buckinghamshire town's designated 'Redways'.</p>

<p>These red-painted routes are a network of shared-use paths for cyclists and cover over 200 miles of the area.</p>

<p>Riders cannot take them onto the town's 'grid roads', which have higher speed limits. Private e-scooters are not part of the trial. </p>

<p>The Government fast-tracked the new legislation to allow e-scooter trials on British roads in July, with ministers believing they could be the ideal environmentally-friendly and Covid-safe way for people to travel to work following the pandemic.</p>

<p>The trials are being held for 12 months to assess whether the devices reduce traffic and what impact they have on the safety of users and those around them. </p>

<p>The Lime e-scooters can be ridden around Milton Keynes at speeds of up to 14.8mph, though users will need to be over the age of 18 and hold at least a provisional driving licence</p>

<p>As part of the Milton Keynes trial, commuters who are returning to work for the first time in September will be offered a free e-scooter ride to test the scheme. </p>

<p>Key workers will receive unlimited free e-scooter and e-bike rides. </p>

<p>Boosting their eco credentials, the Lime e-scooters - as well as its e-bikes - are powered with 100 per cent renewable energy through the San Fransisco transport firm's partnership with Octopus Energy. </p>

<p>Today's launch is the second trial of the rental vehicles, with a smaller scheme of 50 Ginger e-scooters launched in Middlesbrough last month. </p>

<p>The trial hit headlines just days after going live when two teenagers were caught by police the rented e-scooters on the A19 - a dual carriageway with a speed limit of 70mph - and were slammed by the Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen for their 'sheer stupidity'.</p>

<p>Despite this, the scheme has been extended to the Redcar and Hartlepool areas and as many as 50 cities or regions are ready to test rental schemes. </p>

<p>Riders will only be able to use them on minor roads and the Buckinghamshire town's designated 'Redways'. These red-painted routes are a network of shared-use paths for cyclists and cover over 200 miles of the area. Riders cannot take them onto the town's 'grid roads', which have higher speed limits</p>

<p>They will have the same rules as the Milton Keynes trial, though legislation allows users as young as 16 to rent the e-scooters, as long as they have a provisional car, motorcycle or moped licence.</p>

<p>A scheme across the capital has been delayed to the end of autumn due to negotiations between hire firms and different London boroughs, British company Beryl will start hiring 100 e-scooters in Norwich in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Kettering, Liverpool, Northampton, Oxford, Peterborough and Southampton authorities have also expressed intentions to launch schemes.</p>

<p>Announcing the first full-scale scheme, Florence Milner, Lime's general manager in the UK and Ireland, said: 'We're incredibly excited to bring our service to Milton Keynes, making it the first and only e-scooter and e-bike service in the UK. </p>

<p>'Every day, millions of journeys are taken by cars that could be replaced by e-scooters. </p>

<p>'With traffic inching closer to pre-lockdown levels every week, we're proud that Milton Keynes is leading by example, and excited to show the rest of the UK that there is a necessary place for e-scooters on our roads.'</p>

<p>The company has predicted its e-scooter service in the UK will save 3.65 million car trips and 970.9 metric tons of CO2 annually - the annual energy consumption of 112 households, and 10,000 car journeys avoided per day.</p>

<p>Over the next five years, this figure is expected to rise to nearly 11 million car trips, reducing CO2 emissions by almost 3,000 tons annually.  </p>

<p>As well as the 500 Lime e-scooters, residents in Milton Keynes will also have access to 300 Spin versions by mid-September</p>

<p>Spin is the micromobility unit of Ford Motor Company. There is no unlocking fee to use its e-scooters and they will cost 25p per minute</p>

<p>Cllr Peter Marland, leader of Milton Keynes Council, said: 'At a time when residents are in need of safe, environmentally friendly and socially-distant means of transport, we're thrilled to be the first UK city to provide this type of large-scale e-scooter trial. </p>

<p>'We're pleased to continue working with Lime and are looking forward to seeing the people of Milton Keynes take advantage of the on-street e-scooter service. </p>

<p>YouTube star Emily Hartridge, 35, became the first person in the UK to be killed while riding an e-scooter in Battersea, south London, in July last year</p>

<p>'This will provide an important new travel option to residents and visitors to Milton Keynes and we look forward to working with Lime to study the results from the trial.' </p>

<p>Spin, which is the micromobility unit of Ford Motor Company, says it will increase its availability from 100 to 300 -e-scooters in Milton Keynes by mid-September.</p>

<p>There is no unlocking fee to use them like the £1 charge for the Lime scooters, but they will cost 25p per minute - 5p more than its rival.</p>

<p>Users will also only be allowed to ride them on the town’s redways, which provide the local community with convenient connectivity across the town. </p>

<p>Critics have slammed the introduction of e-scooter schemes following the death of YouTube star Emily Hartridge, 35, who became the first person to be killed in the UK while riding one.</p>

<p>Ms Hartridge was struck by a lorry in Battersea, south London, on July 12 last year.</p>

<p>Lawyer Nick Freeman, better know as Mr Loophole for his string of road-traffic-offence acquittals for celebrity clients such as David Beckham, has also voiced his concerns about e-scooter schemes.</p>

<p>He has queried how rules will be enforced and how law-breaking riders will be identified and reprimanded due to the vehicles not displaying number plates like cars and motorbikes.</p>
