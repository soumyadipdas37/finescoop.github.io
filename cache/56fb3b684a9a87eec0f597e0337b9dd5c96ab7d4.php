<p>'The $1.50 Kmart ice cube tray makes cute handles too - I just placed a chrome knob in the ice cube tray then poured resin around it, let it set and then spray painted it!' she said.</p>

<p>Teleasha shared images of the result to a popular Facebook group dedicated to home décor hacks where she revealed how she made the handles</p>

<p>The creative home project is quite easy to do after purchasing the required materials - the ice cube tray, resin and $2.19 fingerpost knobs from Bunnings Warehouse.</p>

<p>Teleasha estimated the cost per handle to be around $3 each, which is very cheap compared to alternative store-bought handles.</p>

<p>Once the resin is left to dry, they remove easily from the silicone trays and can be spray painted. </p>

<p>Teleasha painted the handles gold to match her blush pink decor and white walls, but the handles are rather small. </p>
