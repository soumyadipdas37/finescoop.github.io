<p>A pair of dinosaurs were sleeping in burrows some 125 million years ago when a nearby volcano erupted, sending lava down the valley and trapping them in and underground grave</p>

<p>The fossils were uncovered by farmers working in Liaoning province in northeastern China.</p>

<p>‘It is tentatively hypothesized that both Changmiania liaoningensis specimens were suddenly entrapped in a collapsed underground burrow while they were resting, which would explain their perfect lifelike postures and the complete absence of weathering and scavenging traces,’ reads the study in PeerJ.</p>

<p>Researchers found the two were laying on the ground with their eyes closed, as if they died in their sleep.</p>

<p>Markings on their hip bones suggest they burrowed, leading experts to believe they were sleeping underground when the eruption occurred.</p>

<p>The dinosaurs are believed to have died from asphyxiation, toxins and infections, due to the posture of the skeletons</p>

<p>The dinosaurs were about three feet in length when alive and each had long, flexible tails, along with the ability to walk upright on its hind legs. </p>

<p>The creatures also had had shovel-shaped snouts, which would have helped with digging swiftly and efficiently.</p>

<p>The neck and forearm were short but strong, and its shoulder blades resembled those of modern burrowing animals.</p>

<p>The team note also that the tails of the dinosaurs had been stretched out due to stiffness.</p>

<p>The area is also covered with debris from an ancient volcanic eruption, along with fossils of other creatures that got in its way.</p>
