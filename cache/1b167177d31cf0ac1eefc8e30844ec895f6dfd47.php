<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The latest gadget for anyone wanting to be a James Bond villain could hit the waves in the shape of a £52 million hyper yacht complete with a free £4 million Bugatti Chiron supercar.</p>

<p>The ultimate high prestige Xenos super boat is expected to attract the mega rich who will head to glittering ports such as Monaco and St Tropez.</p>

<p>Although still on the drawing board the yacht is reminiscent of the vessel used by the Bond villain and Spectre operative Emilio Largo in 1965's Thunderball.</p>

<p>The team at Lazzarini Design Studio hope to create the £52 million Xenos super yacht </p>

<p>Owners of the £52 million super yacht will also receive a free Bugatti Chiron worth £4 million</p>

<p>It is planned to house the Bugatti in an on-deck garage so owners can simply drive into the harbour</p>

<p>Lazzarini Design Studio is the team behind the fantasy boat which they claim will have a top speed of 15,000 horsepower allowing it to reach a top speed of more than 100mph.</p>

<p>It is planned to build the 130-foot vessel from aluminium and carbon to add to the sleekness and lightness of the boat.</p>

<p>According to the Lazzarini team it has been 'designed for comfortable high speed cruises.'</p>

<p>The sleek black and chrome yacht is set to have auto-tinting windows, roof mounted solar panels and also be available as an electric powered model.</p>

<p>It is expected that, if it ever leaves the drawing board, that the Xenos will easily cope with rough waters thanks to its ability to swap between a conventional hull and hydrofoils.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the £52 million yacht will be able to operate with a conventional hull or on hydrofoils reaching 90 knots</p>

<p>Jet skis are also included aboard the luxury boat which is sure to attract the mega rich</p>

<p>The Xenos is still on the drawing board but the Lazzarini design team aim to make it the peak of luxury</p>

<p>The Xenos will have sleek lines and it is planned to make it from aluminium and carbon</p>

<p>And with the designers claiming that Xenos, which means different in Ancient Greek, will reach speeds of 90 knots it will make it the fastest 130-foot long yacht in the world. </p>

<p> Not content with simply providing the ultimate luxury on the waves Lazzarini also plan to add a free Bugatti Chiron to the package.</p>

<p>This pièce de résistance is sure to be a major selling point as there are only 500 of the supercars in the world.</p>

<p>With only 500 Bugatti Chirons in the world the lure of one of the supercars for free with the yacht will be a big selling point</p>

<p>The car will be stored in an on-deck garage with a folding ramp to allow owners to drive straight off the yacht into the harbour.</p>

<p>The Bugatti Chiron last year became the first car in the world to go over 300mph.</p>

<p>Last year Bugatti test driver  Andy Wallacereached a speed of 490.48km/h (304.77mph) at the Volkswagen testing circuit at Ehra-Lessien, in Germany.</p>

<p>Designers at Lazzarini said: 'The Hyper car is nicely included in the price of the Xenos - the world's first Hyper yacht.'</p>
