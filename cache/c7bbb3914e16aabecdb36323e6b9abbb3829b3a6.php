<p>Catching up: Scottish television presenter Gail Porter appeared in good spirits on Friday as she joined pals for an afternoon in London's Soho</p>

<p>Gail complemented her afternoon attire with a pair of denim cut-off shorts, rainbow-detailed tube socks and Nike high-tops. </p>

<p>The Fully Booked host accessorised her casual look with several necklaces, rings and a pair of aviator-style shades.  </p>

<p>In June, an emotional Gail branded late Prodigy star Keith Flint the love of her life.</p>

<p>The TV star dated Keith between 1999 and 2000. He who was found dead aged 49, at his home on March 4, 2019.</p>

<p>All smiles: The TV star pulled several animated expressions as she chatted to her friends while sitting at a table outside</p>

<p>Gail discussed the romance with Louis Theroux, 50, for his BBC Sounds podcast Grounded and reflected: 'Keith was the love of my life, I absolutely loved him, I miss him.'</p>

<p>She continued to open up about Keith and shared: 'I was single and we went out and we did not stop laughing for the entire evening and then practically that was us together, almost for two years.</p>

<p>'The good thing was, he didn't really talk about work, I didn't really talk about work, we would just go and do fun things.</p>

<p>Gail added: 'I was actually doing a programme called Wish You Were Here ... I got asked to go to the Maldives ... me and Keith went and he had a few issues with a few things.'</p>

<p>Asked by Louis if he suffered with poor mental health, Gail continued: 'He had a few wobbles but by the end of it, he was swimming every day, we were going to the gym and both of us, our mental health was just so fantastic.</p>

<p>'Of course everyone is going to be extremely happy if you're in the Maldives, we were so lucky and then when we got back I said, "Right, I'm going to go back to work and you go back to work".</p>

<p>'He just didn't get his mind back into things properly. And he was going that way and I was like, we need to keep our minds positive and it just didn't work that way.  </p>

<p>'He was on a downer, I was trying to work my hardest, so it was a shame.' </p>

<p>Friends: Gail spoke to Louis Theroux for his Grounded With Louis Theroux podcast</p>

<p>Acknowledging they both had their issues, she said: 'I always thought there was going to be that moment when we are going to have bad times at different times and it kind of worked that way unfortunately.' </p>

<p>In May, Gail revealed she 'never expected' the news of her ex-boyfriend's death, admitting that she was gobsmacked when she learned he had died. </p>

<p>Keith was found dead in his home in Essex, with toxicology reports finding that the star had cocaine, alcohol and codeine in his system.</p>

<p>Following an inquest into his death, a coroner recorded an open verdict after ruling that there was insufficient evidence to rule he took his own life or that it was an accident.</p>
