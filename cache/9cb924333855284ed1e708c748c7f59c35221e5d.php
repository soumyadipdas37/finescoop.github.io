<p>If you want to blitz your love handles, try standing leg lifts, says celebrity personal trainer Nadya Fairweather (u-shape.co.uk).</p>

<p>Stand on your left foot, lift your right leg out to the side and slightly behind you so that you use your glutes not your hip flexors. Lift it to your highest point and then pulse — tiny little movements up and down for 20.</p>

<p>Hang on to something if needed and make sure your body is tilted so you are not fully vertical. The more you tilt, the more your obliques have to work. Try three to five sets on each side.</p>

<p>WHAT TO EAT</p>

<p>According to nutritionist Shona Wilkinson (shonawilkinson.com), love handles are made up of visceral fat that causes your belly to expand around your mid-section. To reduce them, you should eat whole foods.</p>

<p>If your love handles have developed during the menopause, add flaxseeds to salads, soups and smoothies. These have ALA (alpha linolenic acid) which helps to balance hormones.</p>

<p>Pears contain pectin which binds with fat and reduces the amount you absorb. Try eating a pear half an hour before a large meal. And black beans are a great high-fibre food, too, as they stay in your digestive tract for longer which can reduce your appetite.</p>
