<p>In a teaser for the second half of Love After Lockup's explosive third season, Shawn, 45, from Las Vegas, Nevada, admits that Destinie, 28, has been dodging his calls, right before she is supposed to appear in court. </p>

<p>Oh no: Shawn, 45, from Las Vegas, Nevada, admits that Destinie, 28, might not show up for court in a teaser for the second half of Love After Lockup's third season</p>

<p>Trouble: Shawn was warned by the bondsman that Destinie had failed to appear in court and was a flight risk, but he was so blinded by love that he ignored the red flags</p>

<p>Shawn was warned by the bondsman that Destinie had once failed to appear in court and was a flight risk, but he was so blinded by love that he paid $5,000 out of his own pocket to put towards her $50,000 bond.  </p>

<p>They have both lied to each other throughout their relationship, but Shawn has been adamant that he wants to marry her. However, Destinie has been irrationally jealous of his cordial relationship with Shawn's ex, who is the mother of his six kids. </p>

<p>In the mid-season finale, Shawn insisted he was done with the show after his ladylove repeatedly hit him, however it now looks as though he may be headed for heartbreak and financial disaster — all at the hands of the felon he met online.   </p>

<p>Of course, they're not the only couple facing major issues this season. Dylan, 30, from Chicago, Illinois, has just been reunited with his girlfriend Heather, but things are so awful between them that he actually wishes he was still behind bars. </p>

<p>Stress: The father-of-six is at risk to lose the $50,000 parole bond he'd posted for her release</p>

<p>'Every moment out of prison has been an absolute nightmare,' says the felon, who has been arrested a whopping 34 times.  </p>

<p>Dylan and Heather had only known each other for two weeks when he went to jail. They had never even had sex, but she faithfully stuck by his side for his entire sentence and visited him every weekend for five years.   </p>

<p>After just a few weeks together, she had revealed that she had gotten his name tattooed on her body in three different areas, which he found to be 'borderline obsessive.'</p>

<p>He admitted that he was worried about what their relationship would be like now that he was out of prison, and it looks like he has reasons to be concerned. </p>

<p>Yikes: Dylan, 30, from Chicago, Illinois, has just been reunited with his girlfriend Heather, but he admits he would rather be behind bars than with her </p>

<p>Coming on too strong? Dylan has claimed that Heather is 'borderline obsessed,' and she can't keep her hands off of him now that he is out of prison </p>

<p>Problems: Footage from the second half of the season shows Heather screaming at Dylan in the car as he insists he has done nothing wrong </p>

<p>Dangerous: Heather drives down a one-way street during the argument as he yells at her to slow down. When she finally stops, he jumps out of the car</p>

<p>In the teaser, he is arguing with Heather in the car, insisting that he hasn't done anything wrong. </p>

<p>'F**k you, get out!' she screams.  </p>

<p>Heather rips the camera off the windshield and drives down a one-way street as he yells at her to slow down. When she finally stops, he jumps out of the car, and she screams more obscenities at him. </p>

<p>It also seems like Scott is in for a rude awakening. The 51-year-old had moved from upstate New York to Mississippi to be with Lindsey, the 27-year-old cheerleader turned felon that he had met on a prison-dating website.</p>

<p>Moving fast: Scott, 51, from upstate New York, has moved to Mississippi to be with his felon girlfriend Lindsey, but she might be a gold digger </p>

<p>Ready to bolt? In the new clip, a friend can be seen asking a distraught Lindsey about Scott's finances</p>

<p>Red flag: 'It's always about the money with Lindsey,' the woman says of the felo. 'If you can't provide it, she will find someone that'</p>

<p>Scott had sent her thousands of dollars over the past few years, and he even bought a home and decorated it to her specifications. </p>

<p>Lindsey has admitted that her previous boyfriends had been rich, and all signs point to her being a gold digger. </p>

<p>In the new clip, a friend can be seen asking a distraught Lindsey about Scott's finances. </p>

<p>'He doesn't really have that much money, right?' the person says. </p>

<p>'It's always about the money with Lindsey,' the woman explains in her testimonial. 'If you can't provide it, she will find someone that.' </p>

<p>Can't help it: Tyrice, who is nearly 50, was immediately smitten with his much-younger love Chandra</p>

<p>Stole his heart: The Chicago-native was fed up with women playing games when he met the 28-year-old on a website for prison pen pals</p>

<p>Valid: Tyrice's three children are worried that Chandra is using him for his money</p>

<p>When a producer asks Lindsey if she has any skeletons in her closet, she plays coy.    </p>

<p>'Oh, I can't tell you that or it wouldn't be skeletons in the closet any more would they?' she says. </p>

<p>Scott and Lindsey aren't the only couple on the show with a massive age difference. Tyrice, who is nearly 50, was immediately smitten with his much-younger love Chandra. </p>

<p>The Chicago-native was fed up with women playing games when he met the 28-year-old on a website for prison pen pals. He wants to settle down with Chandra, but it's unclear if she is on the same page. </p>

<p>And while Tyrice's three adult children are happy he has found love, they don't trust the convict he fell for online. </p>

<p>Devoted: John, who is from Cresco, Iowa, was love-struck when he connected with his convict girlfriend Kristianna online</p>

<p>Worried: John is stunned to learn his girlfriend Kristianna has left the halfway house where she was staying following her release from prison</p>

<p>Concerns: John wants to find Kristianna before it's too late. 'I'm a convict. I couldn't go back to prison,' he admits</p>

<p>'How much money have you spent on her?' his daughter asks in the clip.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jessica's father is putting her convict husband Maurice to the test. Jessica was immediately smitten with Maurice when she came across his profile on the dating site Plenty of Fish, but she didn't realize he was in prison.  </p>

<p>They had only been dating for three months when he got down on one knee and proposed in prison — without a ring. After saying yes, she bought her own ring for just $2. </p>

<p>While they already said 'I do' in a prison ceremony, Jessica wants to have a more elaborate wedding, but her family isn't thrilled about the union. </p>

<p>In the trailer, her father gives Maurice $1,000 as a loan, explaining in his testimonial that 'this is a test' — and it's one his son-in-law might not pass. </p>

<p>Will he pass? Jessica's father is putting her convict husband Maurice to the test by loaning him him $1,000 </p>

<p>Temptation: 'I could take this to the casino real quick and go flip this,' Maurice boasts privately, after telling his father-in-law he wouldn't let him down</p>

<p>Cheater? Shavel appears to be going out with other women behind Quaylon's back, despite his claims that he is ready to start the next chapter of his life with her</p>

<p>Hitting back: 'You need to own up and be a man like you said you was in jail and let me know what's up,' she tells him</p>

<p>'I could take this to the casino real quick and go flip this,' Maurice boasts privately, after telling his father-in-law he wouldn't let him down.  </p>

<p>The clip also reveals the moment John learns his girlfriend Kristianna has left the halfway house where she was staying following her release from prison. </p>

<p>'She relapsed,' he says with despair, but that doesn't stop him from trying to go find her before it's too late. </p>

<p>'I'm a convict. I couldn't go back to prison,' he admits. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Shavel appears to be going out with other women behind Quaylon's back, despite his claims that he is ready to start the next chapter of his life with her and her five-year-old daughter.  </p>

<p>'You need to own up and be a man like you said you was in jail and let me know what's up,' she tells him in the trailer. </p>
