<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There is an exhaustive list of new rules football fans in Scotland must abide by this weekend as crowds return. </p>

<p>Aberdeen's clash with Kilmarnock and Celtic's trip to Ross County will be played in front of 300 home fans after the Scottish Government approved the two top-flight matches as pilot events. </p>

<p>Fans will have to restrain their instincts to shout, cheer and sing and have been told they must remain passive observers in the stands. </p>

<p>There will be 300 fans watching Celtic's trip to Ross County as one of two pilot games </p>

<p>The test events are going ahead despite the fact that there is a crackdown on gatherings in England with social gatherings above six people banned from September 14.  </p>

<p>Aberdeen published a 'Supporters Code of Conduct' document so those in attendance will know what to expect at Saturday's 3:00pm kick off. </p>

<p>Fans will only be allowed into the ground if their temperature is below 37.7 and have an allocated time slot to arrive. </p>

<p>They have been told not to use their hands on the turnstiles when entering and to keep a distance of two metres of or at all times from others. </p>

<p>During the game, fans have to stay seated and have been instructed no to stand at any point, which could be a struggle, particularly if the game is an entertaining one. </p>

<p>Fans must remain seated at all times and are not allowed to shout, sing or chant </p>

<p>If the ball is booted into the crowd, it must be given straight back to a ball boy rather than thrown onto the pitch. </p>

<p>The ball boy then has to sanitise it before it can be used in play again.   </p>

<p>At full time, fans have to stay in their seats and await instructions so the exit can be staggered and avoid crowding. </p>

<p>Autographs are well out of the question and supporters have been firmly told not to approach any of the staff or players at the game.  </p>

<p>The lucky few to be allowed inside Pittodrie must adhere to the rules published by the club</p>

<p>The matches will be the first Scottish Premier League fixtures to be played in front of supporters since the coronavirus pandemic halted the 2019-20 season back in March. </p>

<p>Scotland's Sport Minister, Joe FitzPatrick, said: 'A lot of work has gone on behind the scenes in recent months to create the protocols and testing regimes to allow top-level professional sport in Scotland to resume, and this arrangement follows extensive discussions with the Scottish FA, SPFL and clubs about public safety – particularly in relation to physical distancing and hygiene measures.</p>

<p>'The football authorities and the clubs involved have also been able to review and learn from the pilot event staged by Scottish Rugby on 28 August and we are confident there will be strict protocols in place at these two initial pilot football events. We are keeping all pilot events under close review.'</p>
