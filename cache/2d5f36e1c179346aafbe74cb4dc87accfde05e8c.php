<p>Police alleged Zraika and his distant relative Abraham Zreika's actions lit the fire after Zrieka used a cigarette lighter to light the fireworks that triggered grassfires.</p>

<p>Zraika's lawyer told the court his client was the main breadwinner in his household, Parramatta Advertiser reported.  </p>

<p>'He doesn't need the book thrown at him. He's an offender that's before the court has learned a lesson,' he said. </p>

<p>'Unfortunately it's a young man of our community that didn't take heed of what was going on.' </p>

<p>The prosecution pushed for a conviction as Zraika's actions happened when the country was gripped by devastating fires. </p>

<p>The magistrate thanked the RFS for their actions.</p>

<p>Zraika made headlines earlier this year for laughing outside of court and filming reporters</p>

<p>'The air was filled with smoke, there was a large loss of property, huge areas burnt out, and deaths,' Magistrate Tim Keady told the court, Nine News reported. </p>

<p>'Throwing fireworks into a park was bound to cause a problem. It would have been obvious.'</p>

<p>He told Zraika he was old enough to function as an adult and convicted him, and fined him $500.</p>

<p>Zraika's co-accused was fined $1,500 and convicted of negligently handling explosives to cause property damage, having a knife in a public place, and not disclosing his identity. </p>
