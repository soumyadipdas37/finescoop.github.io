<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Facebook's market value was under attack from its own employees on Wednesday as they dumped millions of shares they held in the company.</p>

<p>The social networking giant ended the day down 3.79 percent after 99million shares changed hands.</p>

<p>Company stock fell 83 cents to close at $21.11 Wednesday.The stock is down 44 percent from its IPO price of $38.</p>

<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he will not sell his stocks this year</p>

<p>Wednesday was the first time employees, who hold 234million shares, could sell their Facebook stock.</p>

<p>A lockup period, which required them to hold onto their shares after the company's initial public offering, expired on Monday.</p>

<p>However, markets were closed on Monday and Tuesday as a result of Superstorm Sandy, so employees had to wait until Wednesday.</p>

<p>On average, 50million shares of Facebook stock are traded every day. Trading volume skyrocketed on Wednesday to more than 9illion.</p>

<p>The company's IPO in May was valued at $38 a share. The price was $21.11 by the end of trading on Monday.</p>

<p>Nasdaq graph shows Facebook shares ended the day at just over $21</p>

<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not selling. He has already said that he won't be selling stock until at least next September.</p>

<p>In all, 234 million additional shares and stock options held by employees as of October 15 became eligible to flood the market.</p>

<p>Lock-ups are common after initial public stock offerings and are designed to prevent a stock from experiencing the kind of volatility that might occur if too many shareholders decide to sell at once.</p>

<p>Facebook saw its biggest one-day gain last Wednesday after posting strong third-quarter results.</p>

<p>The day before, Facebook detailed for the first time how much money it makes from mobile ads. Mobile had been a concern since before the Menlo Park, California, company's IPO.</p>

<p>Facebook's stock hasn't done well since its IPO in May amid concerns about its ability to keep growing revenue. But the next lock-up expiration comes on November 14, when 777 million shares and stock options will become eligible to be sold. Â </p>
