<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tiffany Trump enjoyed a night out with friends in the Big Apple on Tuesday, but, just like Cinderella, she made it home before midnight. </p>

<p>The 26-year-old law school graduate stepped out of her New York City apartment flanked by her Secret Service detail around 7:30 p.m. She and her three-vehicle convoy then headed to the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South.</p>

<p>Four hours later, Tiffany was seen leaving the luxury hotel with a few of her friends, and all of them wore protective face masks as they made their way outside. </p>

<p>Living it up: Tiffany Trump, 26, was seen out in New York City on Tuesday evening </p>

<p>Outfit of the day: Tiffany donned a black motorcycle jacket, frayed black jeans  with red and white stripes down the sides, and a pair of white patterned loafer slides </p>

<p>Tiffany looked like the quintessential 20-something New Yorker in her black motorcycle jacket and frayed black jeans featuring a pair of red and white stripes down each leg.</p>

<p>She had a teal scarf tied to her black quilted handbag, which she carried in the crook of her arm. Her wrists were covered in bracelets, and she topped off her look with a pair of white patterned loafer slides.    </p>

<p>Her friends were less bundled up, however, with one wearing a black halter dress on the cool summer night. </p>

<p>Tiffany's long blonde hair was styled in loose waves, and while half of her face was covered by her mask, she was sporting smokey eye makeup. </p>

<p>Night out: The first daughter stepped out of her New York City apartment flanked by her Secret Service detail around 7:30 p.m. and headed to the Ritz-Carleton hotel (pictured) </p>

<p>Fun times: Tiffany was seen leaving the hotel with friends four hours after she got there</p>

<p>Safety first: The law school graduate donned a cheerful pink face mask as she walked through the hotel </p>

<p>Say cheese! Before stepping out the doors, she stopped to take a picture of one of her friends </p>

<p>Unlike her older sister Ivanka, who has a tendency to match her protective face masks to her outfit, Tiffany wore a cheerful pink one. </p>

<p>While the president has had a wavering stance on masks, both his daughters have been seen faithfully wearing them whenever they are in public.   </p>

<p>Before Tiffany stepped out the building's double doors, she snapped a photo of a friend who was posing in front of a black SUV — which was likely one of the first daughter's Secret Service vehicles. </p>

<p>When she joined her friends outside, she removed her mask to take a phone call. She appeared to be talking on speakerphone as she held her cellphone up to her mouth with a smile on her face. </p>

<p>Strike a pose: The friend was posing in front of a black SUV, which was likely one of Tiffany's Secret Service vehicles </p>

<p>Having fun: Tiffany seemed to be smiling behind her mask as she took the photo </p>

<p>Saying goodbye: The president's youngest daughter was also seen giving one of her friends a hug while wearing her mask </p>

<p>Off they go: Tiffany's friend donned a black halter dress, and she led the way as they left the luxury hotel </p>

<p>Tiffany finally left around 11:30 p.m. with two of her friends in tow. After dropping them off, she went straight home. </p>

<p>Her long-time boyfriend Michael Boulos, 23, didn't appear to be with her at all on Tuesday night, and it's unclear if he is even in the country.</p>

<p>The couple was seen out and about in the city earlier this month, with Michael later meeting up with Tiffany's mother Marla Maples outside what appeared to be his apartment building. </p>

<p>It's unclear if he has always had an apartment in the city or procured one after he started dating the president's daughter. </p>

<p>Getting ready: Tiffany ran her fingers through her long blonde hair as she made her way outside </p>

<p>Accessories: Tiffany had bracelets dangling from each of her wrists </p>

<p>Missing the Big Apple? Tiffany seems to be living in New York following her graduation from Georgetown Law in the spring </p>

<p>Tiffany and Michael have had a long-distance relationship for the past three years as she attended law school at Georgetown University.  </p>

<p>Michael, who grew up in Nigeria, is believed to be based in London, and Tiffany frequently visited him across the pond when she had breaks from school. </p>

<p>For the most part, Tiffany has kept her private life private throughout her father's presidency, and while she mentioned job-hunting in her speech at the Republican National Convention, she has yet to reveal where she plans on living or working now that she is done with school. </p>

<p>She traveled to Houston last Saturday to join Vice President Mike Pence's nephew John Pence at a Trump campaign fundraiser. It cost guests $2,800 for a roundtable, $1,500 for a photo op, and $500 for the reception, depending on what they wanted to do. </p>

<p>Missing someone: Tiffany's long-distance boyfriend Michael Boulos didn't appear to be with her on her night out </p>

<p>Still talking: Tiffany and her friends stood outside the hotel for a bit before finally parting </p>

<p>Ring, ring! Tiffany appeared to have gotten a phone call why she was outside </p>

<p>Unveiled: Tiffany pulled down her mask while she was outside to take the phone call </p>

<p>Good spirits: The first daughter had a smile on her face as she held the phone up to her mouth </p>

<p>Tiffany got her makeup done by makeup artist Sheila Ybarra, who shared an airbrushed photo of herself with the first daughter. </p>

<p>The former student was dressed in a cozy bathrobe, but her eyeliner, foundation, and lipstick were all perfectly applied. The makeup artist couldn't help but gush about Tiffany in her caption. </p>

<p>'What a pleasure it was to do makeup on Tiffany Trump <?php echo e('@'); ?>tiffanytrump today. She’s smart, down to earth, witty, stunning, has a big personality and an even bigger heart! This woman is a SWEETHEART,' she wrote. 'Ohhhh and she has PERFECT SKIN.' </p>

<p>It's possible Tiffany is waiting until after the presidential election on November 13 to start the next chapter in her life — and she certainly has plenty of options.   </p>

<p>Saying hello: Tiffany appeared to be on speakerphone as she held the phone to her mouth and not her ear </p>

<p>Waiting game: Tiffany stood next to a black vehicle that was parked outside the hotel </p>

<p>Back in the Big Apple: Tiffany has been spotted out in New York City a number of times since she spoke at the Republican National Convention in late August </p>

<p>Mystery: Tiffany has yet to disclose whether she plans on taking the bar exam or what she plans on doing post-graduation </p>

<p>She can stay in New York with her mother and older half-brothers Don Jr. and Eric or live in D.C., where she will be close to her father, stepmother Melania, half-brother Barron, and half-sister Ivanka.    </p>

<p>Tiffany would likely be welcome to join the family business as all three of her older siblings have done, with Ivanka later leaving the Trump Organization to work as a White House senior adviser.  </p>

<p>Her father, President Donald Trump, who was impeached in late 2019, joked at the time of her law school graduation that a lawyer in the family is 'just what I need.'  </p>

<p>Tiffany has yet to disclose whether she plans on taking the bar exam, but her appearance in Houston and her speech at the RNC suggest that she may take on a more prominent role in her father's presidential campaign. </p>

<p>Protected: Tiffany's Secret Service detail appeared to be parked in front of the hotel as they awaited her to come out </p>

<p>Helping dad: Tiffany traveled to Houston last Saturday to join Vice President Mike Pence's nephew John Pence (left) at a Trump campaign fundraiser</p>

<p>All smiles: Tiffany got her makeup done by makeup artist Sheila Ybarra, who shared an airbrushed photo of herself with the first daughter</p>

<p>Fan club: The makeup artist couldn't help but gush about Tiffany in her caption</p>

<p>Looking back: Tiffany is pictured with her mother Marla Maples (far left) and boyfriend Michael (far right) last month  </p>

<p>President Trump's youngest daughter gave a well-received speech four years ago at the convention in Cleveland, Ohio, where she talked about her father in personal terms, showing a different side to the GOP nominee.  </p>

<p>But this time around, she took a cue from her father and older siblings and railed against the media, the tech giants, and the education system, suggesting they keep the American people 'mentally enslaved.'</p>

<p>'People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants,' the Georgetown Law graduate said.</p>

<p>Likely speaking from experience, she said that in the academic arena, students with opposing viewpoints are 'too afraid to speak,' while the system promotes 'groupthink.'  </p>
