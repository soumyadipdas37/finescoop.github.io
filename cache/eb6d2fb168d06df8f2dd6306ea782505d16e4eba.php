<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Q: I've developed melasma in lockdown, can any face creams minimise discolouration or should I see a professional?</p>

<p>A: Melasma, a pigmentation disorder where dark patches appear on the skin, needs intense but never aggressive treatment.</p>

<p>Dermatologist Dr Emma Craythorne has seen discolouration fade significantly with oral tranexamic acid tablets, so you may want to see a GP soon.</p>

<p>An anonymous reader told British beauty expert Inge Van Lotringen they developed melasma during lockdown and asked if there are any creams they can use to minimise disclouration (file photo)</p>

<p>But topical tranexamic acid (which slows the formation of pigment and redness) can work too: 'A 2-3 per cent concent-ration seems best,' says Craythorne, who says it must be combined with a daily SPF50. </p>

<p>'Skinceuticals Discolouration Defense Serum, £85, teamed with its Advanced Brightening SPF50 Sunscreen, £45 (both skinceuticals.co.uk), delivers the goods.</p>

<p>Some other cosmetically available pigment-blocking ingredients get an even bigger thumbs-up: 'Niacinamide (minimum 4 per cent) and azelaic acid [go for 10 per cent, the highest level in cosmetics] are my preferences,' says Craythorne.</p>

<p>Find both in dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting's Flawless Brightly Serum, £44 (drsambunting.com).</p>

<p>Top with daily SPF50 so as not to stimulate more melanin. </p>

<p>A gentle formula with iron oxide pigments offers better protection, say Craythorne and Bunting: try Exuviance Sheer Daily Protection SPF50, £42 (mortarandmilk.com).</p>
