<p>What a difference: Vicky Pattison took to Instagram on Thursday to share a before and after picture of herself from when she used to 'obsessively' exercise in pursuit of the 'perfect' body</p>

<p>In the left hand side of the picture, Vicky sported a very trim physique, with a slender waist and legs, while she stared sadly at the camera.</p>

<p>In contrast, the right hand side Vicky had a significantly fuller figure , with the star flashing a broad smile at the camera while holding a dumbbell aloft.</p>

<p>Captioning the image, Vicky discussed how she wished she could speak to her younger self and tell her that she's not defined by how she looked or a 'number on a scale.'</p>

<p>She said: 'My heart breaks when I look at this. I wish I could give the girl on the left a hug. I wish I could tell her that things get better. That her self worth is not defined by a number on a scale. </p>

<p>'That being thin doesn’t mean you’re healthy. And having a thigh gap wont make you happy. </p>

<p>'I wish I could tell her that women aren’t meant to be perfect- we’re all meant to be perfectly imperfect! Our beauty lies in our uniqueness! </p>

<p>'We’re not all meant to look the same or even want to look the same- so stop striving to look like everyone you see in the magazines or Instagram &amp; start embracing who YOU are!'</p>

<p>Delivering an empowering message to women, she continued: 'Women are meant to be curvy, or maybe slim, we’re meant to have big boobs or little ones! </p>

<p>Reaching out: Captioning the image, Vicky discussed how she wished she could speak to her younger self and tell her that she's not defined by how she looked or a 'number on a scale'</p>

<p>'We’re meant to have lumps, bumps &amp; cellulite too! We’re meant to laugh, to love, to enjoy a g&amp;t or nail a cheeseburger every so often, we are meant to travel, fall in love, have families &amp; make friends.. We are meant to do exactly what sets our soul on fire!</p>

<p>'We are meant to be whoever we want to be &amp; do whatever makes us happy.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'We are not put on this earth to exercise obsessively, cry over a number on a scale, deprive ourselves &amp; count how many blueberries we put on our porridge.</p>

<p>'Because quite frankly that is some boring &amp; basic bulls**t.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Inspiring: Delivering an empowering message to women, she continued: 'Women are meant to be curvy, or maybe slim, we’re meant to have big boobs or little ones!'</p>

<p>The TV personality went on to share how she's changed within herself and is no longer punishing herself for 'enjoying life'. </p>

<p>She went on: 'I finally have balance in my life &amp; a healthy relationship with exercise &amp; food. I no longer punish myself for enjoying life &amp; I’m not fighting to desperately change my shape.</p>

<p>'Instead I train because I love it. Because it makes me feel empowered, strong &amp; capable. &amp; because it is good for my mental health. </p>

<p>'I eat right 80% of the time because I function better when I do. And I ate cheese and haribos the other 20% of the time because B***H THEY TASTE GOOD.'</p>

<p>Message: 'I wish I could tell her that women aren’t meant to be perfect- we’re all meant to be perfectly imperfect! Our beauty lies in our uniqueness!'</p>

<p>She concluded: 'I’m much happier being the girl on the right, &amp; it’s written all over my face. </p>

<p>'I Hope this brings some comfort to any ladies out there who may be struggling. Please be kind to yourselves &amp; never forget, you’re beautiful exactly as you are!'</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Vicky told how she's learned to embrace her curves once more after getting back to a 'healthy size 12 to 14' after emerging from a dark period of her life which saw the death of her BFF Paul Burns and heartbreak at the hands of her cheating ex John Noble.</p>

<p>Back to her best: Earlier this year, Vicky told how she's learned to embrace her curves once more after getting back to a 'healthy size 12 to 14' after emerging from a dark period of her life</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, Vicky slammed Kate Moss' famous mantra 'nothing tastes as good as skinny feels' as she insists 'the best feeling is being healthy'.</p>

<p>She said of Kate: 'She’s clearly never had a profiterole tower from Marks &amp; Spencer or a Pepperoni Passion from Domino’s! The best feeling is being healthy and for some reason, I mistook what ‘health’ was. I thought it was a number on the scales or fitting into a size eight.' </p>

<p>She went on to say that healthiness for her is no longer a number on a scale or 'fitting into a size eight.'</p>

<p>Instead, Vicky has learned to love the simple things in life including waking up ahead of her alarm or dancing in the street.'</p>

<p>Happy: Amid the tough months she's endured, Vicky, who is loved up with Ercan Ramandan, adopted a healthier lifestyle, which includes a life coach, therapy sessions and eating well once more</p>
