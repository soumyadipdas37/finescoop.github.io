<p>Interview: The 22-year-old Stranger Things star released her first album Blush in August, revealing new details about having dyslexia in a new interview with NPR </p>

<p>The daughter of actors Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman admitted she did get 'kicked out of school for not being able to read when I was a kid.'</p>

<p>'I went to a special school for kids with learning disabilities. And it took me a long time to learn how to read, and I still am limited,' she admitted.</p>

<p>'But the wonderful thing about today's world is that there are so many options. There's something about having had a limitation in regards to my ability to produce and take in stories that made me even more determined to love them and understand them and grow in them,' she added.</p>

<p>Kicked out: The daughter of actors Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman admitted she did get 'kicked out of school for not being able to read when I was a kid.</p>

<p>The actress and singer also said that, 'it was deeply difficult, you know, to be in the slow class.'</p>

<p>'Every grade that went by, you get dropped down into a lower and lower reading group,' she added.</p>

<p>Hawke also said that other kids would find out about being in the lower classes and there was 'bullying, 'but my parents did a wonderful job of encouraging me to be creative.'</p>

<p>Deeply difficult: The actress and singer also said that, 'it was deeply difficult, you know, to be in the slow class'</p>

<p>She added that her father Ethan Hawke directed the music video for her song Coverage, which was made at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>'COVID had just really hit. So I made - I did these live videos with my family,' she began.</p>

<p>'But people call it a music video, I think, because, like, my dad is such a special filmmaker that even with, like, an iPhone and 10 minutes to prepare and me being, like, everyone we're going to play the song in the barn; like, Dad, will you make a video? - his brain turns on and he goes, OK,' Hawke added of her father.</p>

<p>Family: She added that her father Ethan Hawke directed the music video for her song Coverage, which was made at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic</p>

<p>Videos: 'COVID had just really hit. So I made - I did these live videos with my family,' she began</p>

<p>She added that the title of her album Blush came from a lyric in the song Coverage, which she added is the only song on the album about acting.</p>

<p>'But where the title really comes from for me is about this idea of embarrassment. Most people wouldn't describe me as a particularly shameful or shy person. But I actually walk through my life feeling tremendously embarrassed most of the time - that I talked too loud at a party or said something stupid or, you know, whatever it is,' she shared.</p>

<p>'So that's part of what it means. And the other part of what it means is that blush is simultaneously a revealing thing. Like, when you blush, you're revealing something about yourself, something personal. And it's also a mask, like if you put on blush or makeup. It's a mask. It hides your face, your feelings,' Hawke continued.</p>

<p>Album title: She added that the title of her album Blush came from a lyric in the song Coverage, which she added is the only song on the album about acting</p>
