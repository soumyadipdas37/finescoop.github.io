<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman has shed a whopping 105lbs in less than a year and met the love of her life after being told she would need her knees replaced at age 40 because her weight was causing them to buckle. </p>

<p>Elizabeth Hittinger, a 28-year-old medical assistant from Allentown, Pennsylvania, had been overweight her entire life. Weighing 259lbs and wearing a size 18, she was stuck in a spiral of depression because she was unhappy about how she looked.</p>

<p>'I tried so much to lose weight the usual ways. I dieted and went to the gym constantly,' she said. 'I had no confidence about how I looked or my weight and in 2019, I had a lot of wake up calls with my health.' </p>

<p>Then and wow! Elizabeth Hittinger, 28, from Allentown, Pennsylvania, has gone from 259lbs (left) to 154lbs (right) after having weight loss surgery in November 2019 </p>

<p>Old life: The mother-of-one, pictured with her nine-year-old daughter Madalynne, struggled with weigh-related health issues before she lost 105lbs </p>

<p>Elizabeth was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that affects how the ovaries work. She also suffered from knee pain, which was directly linked to her weight. </p>

<p>'My orthopedic doctor told me that I would probably need a knee replacement in my 40s if I did not get my weight into check,' she said. 'My depression was out of control because I was just not happy with how I looked.</p>

<p>'Having so many health issues, I knew it was time to change.'</p>

<p>It wasn't just her physical and mental health that took a hit as a result of her weight. Elizabeth's weight was also starting to impact on the things she could do with her nine-year-old daughter, Madalynne. </p>

<p>While on a trip to a theme park, she couldn't fit into one of the ride's seats. </p>

<p>Hard to handle: Elizabeth was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that affects the ovaries, and had knee pain that was linked to her weight</p>

<p>Nightmare: Elizabeth was told she would need her knees replaced in her 40s because her weight was causing them to buckle</p>

<p>Had enough: 'Having so many health issues, I knew it was time to change,' she said</p>

<p>'This made me feel embarrassed and ashamed I let myself get that large,' she recalled. 'I got off and then walked around the park letting my daughter go on the rides she could.'</p>

<p>This was the final straw for Elizabeth, and in July 2019 she made the brave decision to see a weight specialist to explore the possibility of weight loss surgery. </p>

<p>'Planning for surgery came with a lot of hurdles, including three months of nutrition visits, doctor appointments, and I had to meet with a therapist to make sure I was ready, but I powered through all of them,' she said.  </p>

<p>After months of preparation and medical and psychological assessments, Elizabeth underwent gastric sleeve surgery on November 1, 2019. </p>

<p>Making changes: Elizabeth underwent gastric sleeve surgery on November 1, 2019</p>

<p>Incredible: The mom lost 50lbs in the first two months. Eleven months post-op, she weighs 154lbs and wears a size 6</p>

<p>Finding love: The single mom also met the love of her life, Peter, 29, on Bumble three months after her surgery</p>

<p>'The recovery wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I was sore but it was more adjusting to not eating that was the most difficult,' she said. 'I quickly lost weight. I lost 50lbs in the first two months.' </p>

<p>Eleven months post-op, Elizabeth is at her healthiest — and the number on the scale has never been lower. She now weighs 154lbs and wears a size 6.   </p>

<p>'My knee pains are gone. I can go to the gym and run and actually enjoy it,' she said. 'I can wear a bathing suit and feel sexy and confident in it. I now have the energy to keep up with my nine-year-old daughter's activities and am healthier to be around longer for her.'    </p>

<p>The confidence Elizabeth has gained thanks to her transformation enabled her to re-enter the dating scene after a year and a half. Just three months after undergoing surgery, she met the love of her life, Peter, 29, on Bumble and they've been together ever since. </p>

<p>All smiles: The happy couple has been together ever since they started dating </p>

<p>New life: Elizabeth is now able to take part in activities that she was never able to do before because of her weight </p>

<p>Happy: Elizabeth said she no longer has health issues, and she has never felt more confident </p>

<p>'It is absolutely amazing to love myself and be able to feel loved by him,' she said. 'I finally had the confidence to put myself out there again. I was so excited. Peter was my first date after I had surgery and I was so ready for it.</p>

<p>'I no longer have any health issues. I love myself, but the biggest benefit is having my daughter have a happy and healthy mom,' she added. </p>

<p>Before her incredible weight loss, Elizabeth rarely exercised and would seek comfort in junk food like pasta whenever she was down. She'd average 2,500 calories a day.</p>

<p>Now, she has an egg for breakfast, and a small portion of lean meat and vegetables for lunch and dinner, with cheese as a snack, totaling around 700 calories. She also exercises twice a week.</p>

<p>'People are shocked with how much weight I've lost. They always say they can't believe how good I look,' Elizabeth said. </p>

<p>'Look into all of your options when it comes to weight loss,' she advised. 'Meet with a weight management doctor and do the option best for you.'</p>
