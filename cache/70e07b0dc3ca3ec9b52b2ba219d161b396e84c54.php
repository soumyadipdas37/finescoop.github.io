<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Companies are now seeking specialist bosses to manage the armies of eployees who work solely from home amid the coronavirus lockdown. </p>

<p>Although working remotely seemed to be a temporary solution during the pandemic, jobs website Adzuna suggests it could be here to stay with vacancies for positions including 'head of remote' and 'director of home working'. </p>

<p>And this new demand for remote managers is expected to increase as more companies opt for hiring remote staff, according to Adzuna. </p>

<p>Companies are hiring 'head of remote' to manage staff working from home</p>

<p>Data shows that vacancies for remote roles have risen by 147 per cent since last year, with 47,300 job ads being for a remote position.  </p>

<p>The IT sector is among the first ones  with 15,400 remote jobs on offer at present, and an average salary of £51,300, followed by the customer services sector with adverts for remote workers accounting for 32.7 per cent of roles offered, with an average salary of £20,500, according to the Times. </p>

<p>With Boris Johnson urging people to work from home when possible, Andrew Hunter, the co-founder of Adzuna, said that 'remote working is 'here to stay'. </p>

<p>Data shows that vacancies for remote roles have risen by 147 per cent since last year</p>

<p>He added: 'Remote working is here to stay, but remote job opportunities have a way to go to catch-up.</p>

<p>'Nine out of 10 job openings fail to specify if a role is remote and may be missing out on applications from cautious jobseekers nervous about returning to the office.</p>

<p>'IT is leading the charge, accounting for a third of overall remote job opportunities, helped by a sector full of early-adopters and technical pioneers, but blue-collar job hunters have far fewer remote opportunities to choose from.</p>

<p>'There is an inequality issue here and we must question whether enough is being done to protect lower-skilled, lower-paid workers forced to put themselves at risk to find work.'</p>
