<p>Hit single: South Korean boy band group BTS, including Jungkook, electrified viewers as they performed their new hit single Dynamite on Wednesday during the America's Got Talent results show</p>

<p>They danced around a drive-in, gas station, and amusement park to the wild cheering of AGT fans, who were watching live and streamed from a stack of TV screens on set.</p>

<p>Viewers also enjoyed a visit by a former AGT star who brought some big names to his act.</p>

<p>Scottish mentalist Colin Cloud, 33, who'd appeared on AGT season 12, had earlier asked the audience to bring pendulums of some kind to the show, and hold them aloft.</p>

<p>He tasked the judges with writing down a random word that popped into their heads, and waited until everyone's pendulums stopped swaying.</p>

<p>English language: They performed Dynamite, which is the band's first tune to be sung completely in English</p>

<p>Number one: Dynamite debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart</p>

<p>Boy band: The seven-member group performed it on a variety of sets at Universal Studios Hollywood, where AGT is filmed, as a sign blaring 'Dynamite' glowed brightly behind them</p>

<p>Colin then guessed correctly that Heidi Klum's word had been 'yo-yo,' Howie Mandel's was 'Paris,' and Sofia Vergara's was 'Happy,' from the 2013 Pharrell Williams song.</p>

<p>He then showed a pre-taped video in which  AGT winners magician Shin Lim, 28, ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer, 15, and singer Kodi Lee, 24, parroted those answers.</p>

<p>The show's last semifinals episode of season 15 saw AGT's remaining 11 acts whittled down to five, all of them hoping for a shot at the $1 million grand prize.</p>

<p>The mentalist: Scottish mentalist Colin Cloud, 33, who'd appeared on AGT season 12, had earlier asked the audience to bring pendulums of some kind to the show, and hold them aloft</p>

<p>Pendulum swing: Heidi Klum swung a pendulum as the mentalist went to work</p>

<p>New judge: Sofia Vergara and her fellow judges were tasked with writing down a random word that popped into their heads</p>

<p>Good guess: Colin then guessed correctly that Heidi's word had been 'yo-yo,' Howie Mandel's was 'Paris,' and Sofia's was 'Happy,' from the 2013 Pharrell Williams song</p>

<p>The first person voted through was Cristina Rae, a singer from Nashville who'd survived homelessness to move the judges with her cover of Cynthia Erivo's Jump.</p>

<p>'We will end this journey together,' said Heidi, 47, who'd given Cristina her Golden Buzzer during auditions. 'I am so excited for you. You are a huge inspiration to so many people.'</p>

<p>Cristina was followed by Daneliya Tuleshova, a 14-year-old vocalist from Kazhakstan, who had given a brassy, mature performance of Jessie J.'s Who You Are.</p>
