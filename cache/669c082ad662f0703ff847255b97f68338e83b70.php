<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two teenagers who terrorised a town centre have been told to stay in their homes at night after spitting and swearing at police following a vodka-fuelled rampage.</p>

<p>Charlie Beaumont, then 18, and Jamie Leigh Perkins, then 19, have brought chaos to Stockport in Greater Manchester and already have lengthy criminal records.</p>

<p>Perkins has 30 offences on her record including assault and unlawful wounding, while Beaumont has 11 convictions for public order matters and assaults on police. </p>

<p>During the latest violence, Beaumont assaulted a police officer and screamed: 'you fat c**t, you're a sl*g, I'm going to headbutt you' while Perkins tried to bite them. </p>

<p>Beamount, now 19, of Cheadle Hulme, and Perkins, now 20, of Offerton, would hang around with other troublemakers and cause trouble outside shops and businesses.</p>

<p>Jamie Leigh Perkins (left) and Charlie Beaumont (right) have brought chaos to Stockport in Greater Manchester. The duo are pictured outside Stockport Magistrates' Court yesterday</p>

<p>Both had already been issued with criminal behaviour orders (CBO) barring them from their regular haunts and from associating with each other. </p>

<p>At Stockport Magistrates' Court yesterday, Beamount and Perkins admitted assaulting police, breaching a CBO and being drunk and disorderly.</p>

<p>However they were spared prison after their lawyer said both had found themselves a job and stayed out of trouble since the incident in September last year.</p>

<p>They will each have to abide by eight-week curfews which ban them from going out after dark. </p>

<p>Both were also given three months in prison suspended for a year and were further ordered to pay a total of £400 damages to two of the officers involved in the arrest.</p>

<p>Sentencing, magistrate Neil Brettell told the duo: 'Spitting at a police officer is absolutely disgusting and nobody should be put in that position. </p>

<p>'But in the intervening period you do appear to have proved yourselves, behaved like normal human beings and have grown up. Provided you behave and show a bit of maturity then you won't hear anything from us again.</p>

<p>'However you both have got to continue living your life to the high standards you have now set yourselves and prove that you wish to become part of the human race again and not be from a subculture who go round dragging their knuckles over the pavement.</p>

<p>'You must not behave like the disgusting humans you were previously. You should have a bright future ahead of you and life is surely much better when you don't have to come to court and listen to people moaning at you. But the court will no longer babysit you. You're supposed to be adults and need to behave like adults.'</p>

<p>Earlier, Catherine Allen, prosecuting, said: 'Both of the defendants were subject to a criminal behaviour order and should not associate with each other in a public place - but they were associating with each other on this day and were drunk.</p>

<p>At Stockport Magistrates' Court yesterday, Beamount (left) and Perkins (right) admitted assaulting police, breaching a CBO and being drunk and disorderly</p>

<p>'Both were shouting loudly and waving arms around. Beaumont was crying, shouting and swearing and smelt of alcohol and was very drunk. </p>

<p>'The police officer said she tried to speak but she wouldn't engage and Beaumont then started to grab onto Perkins and they ended up rolling around in the bush. The officers separated them and Beaumont was placed in handcuffs.</p>

<p>'Whilst she was in the police van they learnt she was subject to a criminal behaviour order and several residents approached the officers telling them the females had been causing problems.</p>

<p>'Beaumont then started to lash out and began banging her head on the side of the police van and shouting. She was arrested but whilst waiting to be placed into custody she said: 'you fat c**t, you're a sl*g, I'm going to headbutt you.'</p>

<p>'She then spat towards one officer and then at another. Perkins then said to one of the officers: 'I'm going to kill myself,' and started banging her head against a wall. </p>

<p>Beaumont (left and right) has 11 convictions for public order matters and assaults on police</p>

<p>'She grabbed hold of his vest and body-worn camera and he had no choice but to take her to the ground.</p>

<p>'She was screaming and swearing and making threats and attempted to bite officers so he's had to hold her head on the side of the pavement to prevent her from biting. </p>

<p>'At that point, she spat at this officer and he was forced to restrain her on the floor and she continued to spit on the floor. She was shouting and was then arrested.'</p>

<p>Perkins had 30 offences on her record including assault and unlawful wounding plus previous breaches of the CBO when she was caught loitering outside an Aldi store.</p>

<p>Beaumont had 11 convictions for public order matters and assaults on police and breach of her CBO. Both were usually dealt with by youth rehabilitation or supervision orders.</p>

<p>Beaumont's convictions were usually dealt with by youth rehabilitation or supervision orders</p>

<p>In mitigation for the girls, defence lawyer Lisa Morton said: 'They were young women who had considerable problems in their early to late teens but it seems that things are now going in the right direction.</p>

<p>'At the time Charlie was in a state of distress and was intoxicated and she actually started asking for police to arrest her.</p>

<p>'At that point, Jamie Leigh appears and becomes involved in the situation to an extent it deteriorates and both girls are very drunk and quite distressed for reasons simply because they are very drunk.</p>

<p>'When Charlie is first being arrested Jamie Leigh tried to intervene and becomes quite hysterical. </p>

<p>'She was head butting a brick wall and has quite considerable injuries and bruises all over her head, face, arms and legs and scratches around her neck. I think it gives something of an idea to the level of distress at the time.</p>

<p>During the latest violence, Beaumont (left and right) assaulted a police officer and screamed: 'you fat c**t, you're a sl*g, I'm going to headbutt you'</p>

<p>'Both had ended up at as party at a mutual associate but Charlie says she wasn't really aware of Jamie Leigh's presence. Both say they consumed some vodka at this party and suddenly feel very intoxicated.</p>

<p>'Jamie Leigh says she feels her drink may have been spiked at the party as the level of intoxication seems to be disproportionate with what they recall drinking.</p>

<p>'There's clearly been an issue for both these young ladies for quite a number of years and with a group of young people congregating in Stockport town centre getting drunk and causing anti-social behaviour. But both these young women have now simply grown up.</p>

<p>'Charlie has got herself a full-time job and accommodation and passed her driving test. She is very positive about wanting to stay away from this kind of behaviour and is remorseful towards the officers. Jamie Leigh is now working at McDonald's and has been knuckling down.</p>

<p>'She tells me one of her passions is football and she has attained a position as a sports coach on a weekly basis. She has tried to turn her back on this and is trying to mature. Both of these girls have made some progress since this incident.' </p>
