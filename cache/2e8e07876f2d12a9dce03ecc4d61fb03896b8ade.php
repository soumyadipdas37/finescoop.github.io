<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Designer Christian Siriano closed out a scaled back New York Fashion Week on Thursday with a splash.</p>

<p>To be more accurate, it was Canadian model Coco Rocha who made the splash at his behest as he hosted a runway show in the grounds of his Connecticut estate complete with wooden runways over his swimming pool.</p>

<p>As the finale to the socially-distanced event which featured catwalk models in masks, Rocha, who's pregnant with her third child, waded into the water in her elaborate red gown and matching wide-brimmed hat.</p>

<p>No stopping her: Rocha didn't blink as she got deeper into the water trailing her elaborate red gown behind her</p>

<p>She's in:  Soon only her head with its wide-brimmed red hat popped up above the pool coping as the material from her dress floated out around her</p>

<p>Before getting wet, Rocha, 32, had looked stunning in the designer's long-sleeve dress that had a dramatic high-low ruffled hemline.</p>

<p>The outfit was paired with matching color hat and heels as well as a cloth face mask in the same shade of red.</p>

<p>After her dip, the dark-haired beauty had to be helped from the pool by an assistant due to the weight of the water-logged gown.</p>
