<p>A talented artist wowed people online by posting their incredible paint creations on TikTok. In one video, the user - <?php echo e('@'); ?>wlj8886 - was seen producing a stunning painting of an owl</p>

<p>She used beads to spread splodges of brown and white paint across a black background. Once finished, she had depicted two stunning wings</p>

<p>In both, she first squirts different colours onto paper before using a string of metal beads to drag the paint across the page. </p>

<p>To create the owl, the artist starts off with little puddles of white and brown paint on a black piece of paper. </p>

<p>They are arranged in a pattern so that she can use her string of beads to spread the paint out into the basic shape of the owl, which is depicted with white-tipped feathers.</p>

<p>Once that is done, the craftswoman smudges the centre of the creation to make space for what will become the owl's face. </p>

<p>She also creates further dabs of brown and white paint beneath the bird and uses the beads to depict the animal's tail feathers.</p>

<p>She then shifts back to create the owl's eyes using a splodge of bright yellow paint. </p>

<p>The artist then created two circular eyes and used a splodge of yellow paint to depict the bird's beak</p>

<p>In another video, the artist painted a butterfly. She started off by laying her metal beads on a blank page and then traced around them with black paint before filling the space with pink, blue and yellow paint</p>

<p>With the butterfly, wlj8886 first lays the beads on the paper so that they form the basic shape of one of the insect's wings. </p>

<p>She then paints the colour black around them and fills the space in the middle with pink, blue and yellow paint. </p>

<p>She then runs the beads through the paint to create a beautiful deeply-coloured wing. </p>

<p>Wlj886 then used her beads to drag the colours into each other, making a a clearly defined wing</p>

<p>The artist then repeats the process with the other three wings and finishes off by creating the butterfly's body in the centre of its wings. </p>

<p>Other TikTok users were amazed by the 'amazing' videos. </p>

<p>One said: 'Looks so cool and realistic.' </p>

<p>Another added: 'Speechless! So amazing.' </p>

<p>The finished painting depicted a stunning butterfly with swirling, multi-coloured wings</p>
