<p>Queen Letizia of Spain (pictured with her husband King Felipe) has once again proved that you don't need designer clothes to look like fashion royalty after stepping out in a recycled £70 tweed dress from Zara today</p>

<p>The mother-of-two (pictured), 47, wore the stylish checked number at an event to mark the nation's Cooperative's Day at Madrid's Palacio de Viana, alongside her husband King Felipe</p>

<p>Letizia showed off her sartorial prowess in the patterned navy dress with a billowing skirt and an asymmetrical neckline. </p>

<p>The fitted frock - which was part of Zara's 2019 collection - was nipped in at the waist with a thin black belt, which showcased the royal's slender figure.</p>

<p>Her navy slingback heels complemented the casual style of its frayed hem and she accessorised with a simple pair of silver hoop earrings.</p>

<p>The Spanish royal wore her sleek dark hair down and kept her make-up to a tasteful smokey eye and slick of lip gross. </p>

<p>Letizia previously wore the dress in July 2019 when meeting with the International Congress of the International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR). </p>

<p>Looking equally sophisticated today, King Felipe sported a navy suit with a white shirt while standing alongside his wife. </p>

<p>Every September 8 in Spain, Cooperator's Day honors professionals who work for sustainable development and the fight against poverty together with the most vulnerable populations on the planet. </p>

<p>Letizia and Felipe have continued to put on a united front amid the ongoing scandal surrounding former King Juan Carlos. </p>

<p>In August, they visited Ibiza and paid a visit to the Monographic Museum and Necropolis of 'Puig des Molins', said to be the home of the goddess Tanit and the best preserved necropolis in the Mediterranean.  </p>

<p>Their trip coincided with the Spanish royal palace confirming the 82-year-old ex-king is residing in the United Arab Emirates, having left his homeland earlier this month after it emerged his finances are under investigation in a major corruption probe. </p>

<p>Juan Carlos is believed to be staying with his 'most faithful friend for the past 40 years', 70-year-old Mallorcan interior designer Marta Gaya, in a £10,000-a-night presidential suite at the Emirates Palace Hotel. </p>

<p>In a surprise move, Juan Carlos announced on August 3 that he was leaving Spain to prevent his personal affairs from undermining his son King Felipe VI's reign, but did not say where he would be going.  </p>

<p>King Juan Carlos has denied any wrongdoing and claims he is available should prosecutors need to interview him. </p>
