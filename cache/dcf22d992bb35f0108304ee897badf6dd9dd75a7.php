<p>Every telly addict plays this game: pick the five funniest episodes of Frasier. Or, name the dozen worst contestants from the I'm A Celebrity jungle. </p>

<p>Even Sir David Attenborough enjoys the challenge. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, shortly before lockdown began, I was fortunate enough to spend an afternoon chatting with him and we got on to the topic of his favourite episodes from a TV career spanning 70 years.</p>

<p>He's most proud, he says, of 1979's ground-breaking Life On Earth. </p>

<p>Sir David was delighted at the memory. He was 37 when he travelled across the Northern Territory, with temperatures in the high 40s and the nearest town days away</p>

<p>Among the archive series I cherish most is his Australian adventure, Quest Under Capricorn from 1963, in which he met some of the last Aboriginal nomads.</p>

<p>Sir David was delighted at the memory. He was 37 when he travelled across the Northern Territory, with temperatures in the high 40s and the nearest town days away.</p>

<p>A tribal elder named Magani befriended him. 'He talked a lot of Pidgin English, which I picked up so I was able to talk to him,' Sir David told me. </p>

<p>And to prove he hadn't forgotten, the world's greatest living broadcaster broke into Pidgin, speaking it fluently. 'He no trouble,' he chuckled.</p>

<p>Quest Under Capricorn, filmed in gorgeous Sixties cine colours, is available on iPlayer. </p>

<p>For a selection of his more recent best moments, the Bank Holiday gave us Planet Earth: A Celebration (BBC1)</p>

<p>Drawing on Planet Earth II from 2016 and 2018's Blue Planet II, and featuring a new soundtrack by movies composer Hans Zimmer, the compilation included unforgettable sequences — such as the packs of racer snakes chasing newly hatched marine iguanas across the sands in the Galapagos.</p>

<p>I've watched that a dozen times and it never fails to make my heart pound as I will the babies to reach the safety of the rocks. </p>

<p>But I can't help puzzling over the adult iguanas. Why don't they lay their eggs closer to the rocks?</p>

<p>Why don't they stand guard as their offspring emerge? </p>

<p>Birds protect their chicks, before and after hatching— why haven't sea-going reptiles evolved to be as smart?</p>

<p>For sheer brains, you can't beat the octopus. It doesn't just fool its predator, the pyjama shark — it leaves the big fish looking stupid.</p>

<p>When the shark is on the hunt, the octopus gathers up seashells with its eight tentacles and wraps itself in armour like an armadillo.</p>

<p>Then it squirts ink in the shark's face and escapes. Watching this clip without the background music might be interesting — I reckon we'd hear the sound of an octopus laughing.</p>

<p>All that was missing from Michael Mosley's new series, The Diagnosis Detectives (BBC2), was the sneering laughter of Hugh Laurie as Dr Gregory House. </p>

<p>Terminally sardonic, House was the star of a U.S. medical drama that ran for eight years, during which he diagnosed some of the rarest and most improbable diseases found in any textbook.</p>

<p>All that was missing from Michael Mosley's new series, The Diagnosis Detectives (BBC2), was the sneering laughter of Hugh Laurie as Dr Gregory House</p>

<p>The 12 consultants and specialists who comprise Dr Mosley's team are less sarcastic but equally able to identify unlikely ailments. </p>

<p>The first episode saw them investigating Paul, 75, whose face was so badly swollen he could barely open his eyes.</p>

<p>Their first guesses were uninspired. 'An allergy to washing powder?' suggested one. 'Has he started using a different shampoo?' wondered another.</p>

<p>But they soon got into the spirit of the investigation, testing for an auto-immune reaction triggered by sunlight. </p>

<p>Lung cancer was another possibility.</p>

<p>Then the docs got really carried away. 'Leprosy!' declared one. It wasn't, but Dr House would salute the sentiment.</p>

<p>This series promises to be great fun for hypochondriacs.</p>
