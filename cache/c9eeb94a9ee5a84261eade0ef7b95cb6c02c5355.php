<p>Hey there: The BBC news host, 45, greeted the duo, with whom she shares the same management company, fondly from an acceptable social distance outside the hotel</p>

<p>The presenter hosted webinars for the banking giant weeks after she was rebuked for fronting a paid corporate video for car maker Aston Martin.</p>

<p>It has now emerged she could be stopped from speaking about NatWest live on air after bosses rapped her for a 'conflict of interest' which, 'will be kept in mind for future editorial decisions'.</p>

<p>Last month, Jamie spoke about 'nerve-wracking' presenting experience on Sky One's A League of Their Own alongside Freddie and Andy Murray.</p>

<p>Here come the boys: Sky Sports pundit Jamie, 47, looked stylish in a varsity style bomber jacket while he packed up his car ahead of Freddie leaving the hotel</p>

<p>The sports columnist explained to Christine Lampard: 'You make it look easy. I must admit there were a few mistakes. I had to go back and do a lot of links. It was fun... </p>

<p>'It was nerve wracking I must admit. When you've got to present and keep people in check... I enjoyed being the boss for a bit.' </p>

<p>Shortly before his appearance, Jamie enjoyed a lively chat with Lorraine's stand-in presenter Christine Lampard as they discussed his new ventures last month.</p>

<p>Jamie and the host, 41, were left giggling as they recalled the moment he sang at her wedding with her husband and his cousin Frank, 42, in December 2015.</p>

<p>Hosting: Last month, Jamie spoke about 'nerve-wracking' presenting experience on Sky One's A League of Their Own alongside Freddie and Andy Murray</p>

<p>'You got up and did some singing at my wedding!', the amused broadcaster said, with the former footballer proudly confirming: 'Yeah I did! I had a few too many drinks that night, I think we all did.'</p>

<p>The sportsman cringed as he discussed belting lyrics in front of musician Ed Sheeran, stating: 'Especially as Ed was there, it wasn't a great idea to be singing in front of him! He didn't sign me up, I'll put it that way.'</p>

<p>Jamie also shut down rumours he's set to follow in his father Harry's footsteps by appearing on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</p>

<p>'Leave it out Christine. No way!', the media personality declared, just under two years after his dad, 73, was crowned King of the Jungle. </p>
