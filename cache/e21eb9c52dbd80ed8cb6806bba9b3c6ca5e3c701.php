<p>Responding to a fan, she wrote: 'I went from a Dress Size 14/16 to a 10/12. I'm curvy so I notice weight loss more in my clothes than on a scale.</p>

<p>She told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.</p>

<p>'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'</p>
