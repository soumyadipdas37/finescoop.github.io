<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Anxiety over the COVID-19 pandemic could spark a rise in suicides at remote Aboriginal communities, a minister fears. </p>

<p>Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt has voiced his concern about the impact of coronavirus on Indigenous Australians and their communities. </p>

<p>'I do worry that we will see an increase (in suicides) because there are many multiple factors that will impact on individuals,' Mr Wyatt told The West Australian.  </p>

<p>Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt (pictured) has warned that anxiety surrounding the coronavirus could lead to a spike in suicides in remote Indigenous communities</p>

<p>Mr Wyatt hoped a recent focus on community engagement and family relationships had a positive impact on Aboriginal communities (children playing basketball in the Northern Territory's remote Arnhem Land pictured) </p>

<p>The minister warned uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and how long it could take Australia to recover could directly impact the suicide rate.     </p>

<p>'The world has changed as we all knew it,' he explained. </p>

<p>Suicide is the fifth leading cause of death for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  </p>

<p>Australia recorded 3,046 suicide deaths in 2018 and 169 of these were Indigenous people.   </p>

<p>Mr Wyatt said he feared an increase in suicides but hoped that recent community engagement had been beneficial to Indigenous people's mental health.   </p>

<p>'Families have been spending more time together during COVID, children spending more time with fathers and mothers, so hopefully that will have a positive impact,' he said.   </p>

<p>Western Australian State Coroner Ros Fogliani delivered an 'urgent' call for action on Indigenous suicide rates last year. </p>

<p>She investigated the deaths of 13 Indigenous people in the Kimberley region in Western Australia, including five children aged 10 to 13, in less than four years. </p>

<p>Australia recorded 3,046 suicide deaths in 2018 and 169 of these were Indigenous people (a child at the Alice Springs Women's Shelter in the Northern Territory pictured)  </p>

<p>Ms Fogliani said prevention services were not working and labelled the situation 'dire'.</p>

<p>There have been at least another six suicides in the Kimberley since Ms Fogliani's report, leading to criticism of the state government for not acting fast enough.    </p>

<p>Mr Wyatt, the member for Hasluck in Perth’s east, said he was focused on addressing these issues in his Voice to Parliament.</p>

<p>He hoped to finalise the Voice to Parliament, which advocates for Indigenous issues in policy making, by the end of the year. </p>

<p>It is understood Mr Wyatt's Voice Co-Design Senior Advisory Group has already delivered a plan. </p>

<p>It recommends choosing 11 to 20 Aboriginal representatives from across the country to advise the government on key Indigenous policies.</p>

<p>Mr Wyatt has also said he is looking for a tourism strategy that will secure more Indigenous jobs, as well as get tourism businesses ready for a widespread opening. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Wyatt for comment.  </p>
