<p>One of his last major public appearances was when he collected his CBE for services to photography from the Duke of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace in October last year. </p>

<p>After receiving his honour last October Terry, who had been suffering from prostate cancer and was in a wheelchair, said the award 'surpasses anything I've had happen to me in my life'.  </p>

<p>The British photographer was born on 30 July 1938 in Heston, West London, and originally aspired to be a jazz drummer due to his love of music. </p>

<p>He tried to get a job as a steward at an airline, thinking this would let him travel to New York to play in the jazz clubs, but there were no positions available. </p>

<p>Another of Terry's photographs shows American actor Paul Newman and Lee Marvin in Stuart Rosenberg's 1972 comedy western 'Pocket Money', Tuscon, Arizona</p>

<p>Terry, who was awarded a CBE last year, also captured English singer, musician and actor David Bowie for a magazine in Los Angeles, circa 1974</p>

<p>Instead he managed to get a job in photography and took a shot that would change his life.</p>

<p>He said: 'Part of my work was to take photographs of people arriving and departing at the terminals. I happened upon a very well-dressed bowler-hatted man, taking a quick nap in the departures area, and he was surrounded by African chieftains, fully clad in their regalia. </p>

<p>'Soon after, I was approached by an editor who told me that they wanted to show the photo to his paper. </p>

<p>'The man napping turned out to be then Home Secretary Rab Butler. </p>

<p>Over a sixty year career, Terry captured the cultural landscape with photographs (pictured,American singer and actor Frank Sinatra on set during the making of 'The Lady In Cement' in Miami, 1968)</p>

<p>'The paper ran my photo and I was off and running. I was offered a job at the Daily Sketch where I worked for several years before going out on my own.'</p>

<p>Following that success he went on to document what became known as the Swinging Sixties, taking pictures of The Beatles and Rolling Stones. </p>

<p>His images have burst out from iconic albums, movie posters and magazine covers and by 1965 he was being sought out for work by the biggest magazines and newspapers in the world.</p>

<p>The Royal Photographic Society said he had grasped that the youth culture of the 1960s was a key moment in time globally and he began to record the new faces in film, fashion and music who would go on to become megastars.</p>

<p>Mr O'Neill's images have burst out from iconic albums, movie posters and magazine covers and by 1965 he was being sought out for work by the biggest magazines and newspapers in the world</p>

<p>His work which captures the Swinging Sixties includes The Beatles and The Rolling Stones when they were still struggling young bands along with David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton and Chuck Berry.</p>

<p>In the 1970s he became well-known for his pictures of Elton John, who was a rising star at the time.</p>

<p>Film stars such as Sir Michael Caine and Raquel Welch remained lifelong friends.</p>

<p>The Queen and former South African president Nelson Mandela have posed for portraits from Mr O'Neill and striking images of former prime minister Sir Winston Churchill are also among his archive.</p>

<p>Footballers Bobby Moore, Franz Beckenbauer, Pele, George Best, manager Brian Clough, boxer Muhammad Ali and Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan are among the sporting greats whom he has captured.</p>

<p>Mr O'Neill's work reads like a who's who in music, film, and celebrity which helped to visually define the 1960s ranging from Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Terence Stamp, Jean Shrimpton, Tom Jones, and Frank Sinatra through to singers Bruce Springsteen, Amy Winehouse and U2 in recent decades.</p>

<p>Iconic Images also point out that Mr O'Neill was also one of the first photographers to work with a new franchise starring actor Sean Connery as James Bond.</p>

<p>Mr O'Neill went on to work on several Bond films throughout the decades, including several with Sir Roger Moore. </p>
