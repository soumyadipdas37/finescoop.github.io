<p>Delphine Boël, 52, is the child of the former Belgian King Albert II.</p>

<p>The ex-royal admitted he was her father in January of this year after he had fought the paternity claim for over a decade.</p>

<p>The mother of artist Delphine, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, claims that she had an affair with Albert, 86, before he became king.</p>

<p>Rumours of a royal scandal and media gossip in Belgium first sprang up in 1999 due to claims of an illegitimate child in an unauthorised biography about Albert's wife, Queen Paola.</p>

<p>The love child of the abdicated Belgian king, Albert II, who is asking the courts to grant her the same rights as his other children</p>

<p>The BBC alleges that Ms Boël initially alleged on record that King Albert was her biological father in 2005 during an interview. </p>

<p>She waited until 2013 when he abdicated from the throne, and lost immunity from prosecution, before she began court proceedings.</p>

<p>Ms Boël's lawyer, Marc Uyttendaele, said on Thursday, says the BBC, that she is seeking the same rights as Albert's three other children - Philippe, now King of Belgium, Prince Laurent and Princess Astrid.</p>

<p>Mr Uyttendaele told the broadcaster: 'Delphine's position isn't that she wants or doesn't want to be princess.</p>

<p>'She doesn't want to be a cut-price child, she wants to have exactly the same privileges, titles and capacities as her brothers and her sister.'</p>

<p>He was born in 1934 as the second in line to the throne</p>

<p>In 1959 he married the Italian Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria</p>

<p>He ascended to the throne in 1993 after the death of his brother King Baudouin</p>

<p>He served as monarch of Belgium for two decades before he abdicated in 2013</p>

<p>During Belgium's political stalemate in 2010-11 he stepped in with a constitutional role</p>

<p>It has been suggested that if the court rules in her favour that Miss Boël's children will be eligible for a royal title.</p>

<p>But Albert's legal team claim that Miss Boël can only be given the title princess by royal decree and not by a court.</p>

<p>Baroness Longchamps says that her affair, with the then Prince Albert of Liege, started in 11966 and ran until 1984.</p>

<p>She adds that he was a regular presence during the early years of Miss Boël.</p>

<p>Albert only came to the Belgium throne following the unexpected death of his brother King Baudouin in 1993 aged 62.</p>

<p>He remained in this position until he cited ill health in July 2013 and abdicated from the throne in favour of his son Philippe.</p>

<p>Court orders demanding that Albert take DNA tests to determine if Miss Boël was his child were refused until he was faced with fines of €5,000 (£4,600) a day while he resisted.</p>

<p>The former king eventually admitted that Miss Boël was his child in January after learning the results of DNA tests.</p>

<p>Albert's acceptance of the DNA tests said Mr Uyttendaele, at the time, was a 'relief' for Miss Boël.</p>

<p>He told RTL television that: 'Her life has been a long nightmare because of this quest for identity.'</p>

<p>The King of Belgium is a constitutional monarch who largely plays a ceremonial role in affairs.</p>
