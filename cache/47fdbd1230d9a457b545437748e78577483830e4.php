<p>A Texas father's drunken food craving has landed him behind bars after police say he let his 13-year-old stepdaughter drive him to get ice cream. </p>

<p>Javier Martinez-Aguilar, 42, from Lubbock, was indicted on Tuesday on felony charges of endangering a child and criminal negligence stemming from his alcohol-fueled father-daughter outing earlier this month.</p>

<p>According to police, on September 9, an officer pulled over an SUV in the 2500 block of Avenue Q after it failed to yield the right of way to a patrol vehicle, nearly causing a crash, reported EverythingLubbock.com.</p>

<p>The responding officer approached the vehicle and found a 13-year-old girl behind the wheel, with her purportedly worse-for-wear stepfather in the passenger seat.</p>

<p>Police pulled over Martinez-Aguilar's SUV operated by the child on Avenue Q in Lubbock after the girl failed to yield the right of way to a patrol car </p>

<p>When asked what she was doing, the teen allegedly replied that 'she was driving her stepfather to get ice cream because he was drunk,' an arrest report stated.</p>

<p>Police said that Martinez-Aguilar was so inebriated that he had a difficult time taking his driver's license out of his wallet.</p>

<p>The stepfather with the sweet tooth was booked into the county jail but was later released on bond.</p>

<p>Police let his stepdaughter go and she was taken home by her older sister.</p>
