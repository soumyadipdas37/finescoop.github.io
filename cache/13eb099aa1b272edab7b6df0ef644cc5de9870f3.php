<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gavin Rossdale seems to have a new love interest. On Sunday the Bush singer was seen with his arm around a young blonde beauty, who resembles Heidi Klum, while on the shore in Malibu.</p>

<p>This comes a week after the 54-year-old British star shared on Instagram that he 'found my love on the beach.' </p>

<p>The musician has been dating different women on and off ever since he divorced former No Doubt front woman Gwen Stefani - with whom he shares three sons: Kingston, 14, Zuma, 12, and Apollo, six - in 2016.</p>

<p>Cute lady friend: Gavin Rossdale seems to have a new love interest in his life. On Sunday the Bush singer was seen with his arm around a young blonde beauty who resembles Heidi Klum</p>

<p>The Swallowed singer was seen in a white T-shirt that displayed his tattoos as he put one hand behind the beauty as the other hand held his Pomeranian.</p>

<p>The star - who also has daughter Daisy Lowe, 31, with ex Pearl Lowe - added blue shorts with red and yellow stripes. His hair was worn down in wet curls.</p>

<p>His lady love had on a white crop top to show off her flat tummy and added short bicycle shorts with a design on the side.</p>

<p>Her hair was worn down showing off her blonde highlights and bangs. A tattoo could be seen on the inside of her ankle.  </p>

<p>Casual on the shore: The Swallowed singer was seen in a white T-shirt that displayed his tattoos as he put one hand behind the beauty as the other hand held onto his Pomeranian. The star - who also has daughter Daisy Lowe, 31, with ex Pearl Lowe - added blue shorts with red and yellow stripes</p>

<p>The pair seemed to be close as they stopped by the rocks to have a chat and were also seen sitting close to one another while on the sand.</p>

<p>Last week Rossdale took to Instagram and shared a photo of himself posing on some rocks on a beach in scenic Malibu. </p>

<p>'i found my love on the beach -i found my love in the sand,' he wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>With the Pacific Ocean water crashing into the shore, he wore a pair of military green pants with a black sleeveless t-shirt and his hair slicked back off his face. </p>

<p>Catching up in Malibu! The pair seemed to be close as they stopped by the rocks to have a chat as Gavin held a dog collar</p>

<p>His last few girlfriends since splitting from Gwen - who now dates Voice co-star Blake Shelton - are Natalie Golba (2019) and Sophia Thomalla (2017 - 2018). </p>

<p>In July Gavin told People magazine that he was exhausted by love.</p>

<p>'I keep getting screwed up and screwed over in all these relationships,' said the singer. 'I'm not very good at them, I guess. I had a divorce, I had a long-term girlfriend — that went to s*** — and I don't have a girlfriend now, even though everyone seems to think I do. You get burned by that stuff.'</p>

<p>Two months ago he said this: In July Gavin told People magazine that he was exhausted by love. 'I keep getting screwed up and screwed over in all these relationships,' said the singer. 'I'm not very good at them, I guess. I had a divorce, I had a long-term girlfriend — that went to s*** — and I don't have a girlfriend now, even though everyone seems to think I do</p>

<p>It's also hard to make room in his schedule for love, he said: 'One has to find time, but I have my boys now so there's absolutely no personal time. That's the end of personal time. Take that personal time and throw it out the window.' </p>

<p>And the crooner added that he is 'really concentrating on being a single dad.' </p>

<p>The balance is not easy to pin down: 'I don't know, it may be too difficult to combine being a devastating single dad with the attention required for a beautiful girl,' he joked. 'So I don't know. I'm trying to find my feet on that one. It's unresolved.'</p>

<p>Morning stroll: The London native posted a photo of himself in Malibu on Thursday</p>

<p>He lives in Los Angeles and Gwen has been staying at Shelton's ranch in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>The kids go back and forth. </p>

<p>'We've been making a lot of ice cream,' Rossdale told the site. 'This morning I was playing some PS4 nonsense. I was getting heavily told off for not using controls correctly, but it's good fun. It's important how we hang out and spend time together.' </p>

<p>Bush found immediate success, especially in the US, with the release of their debut album Sixteen Stone in 1994, during the grunge music heyday. It went 6X platinum behind such hits as Machinehead, Glycerine, Comedown and the aforementioned Everything's Zen. </p>
