<p>Sacrifice: Irena Srbinovska is the odds-on favourite to win The Bachelor, but she risked losing her place in the competition earlier this year when production went into lockdown</p>

<p>Filming of The Bachelor was suspended in March due to the escalating pandemic, and the 'Love in Lockdown' episodes were filmed while the remaining women were self-isolating at home.</p>

<p>Irena, who works as an anaesthetic and recovery nurse, previously told New Idea she was 'torn' over her decision to continue with the show when her skills were needed. </p>

<p>'My heart was torn - a part of me was selfishly devastated that the show was stopping, but then the other half of me was so eager to get back home and fight COVID,' she told the magazine last month. </p>

<p>But a source close to Irena has since told Daily Mail Australia that her decision to put on scrubs again carried a significant risk.</p>

<p>'It was a tough decision for her to make, but she felt guilty sitting around at home for a TV show when her co-workers were so busy.'</p>

<p>The source added that Irena said goodbye to Locky before returning to work, but their emotional farewell wasn't aired on television. </p>

<p>'Locky knew how important it was for Irena to go back to work, but he was also worried that she might not return to the show,' they said.</p>

<p>'What people don't know is that Irena actually cut her annual leave short to resume working at the hospital - she's very dedicated.'</p>

<p>Irena's difficult decision to return to work has not once been mentioned during The Bachelor's 'Love in Lockdown' episodes. </p>
