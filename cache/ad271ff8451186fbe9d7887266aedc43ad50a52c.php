<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Â£30billion takeover of Arm by US rival Nvidia will 'destroy' its business model, the company's founder has warned.</p>

<p>Hermann Hauser, who co-founded the British tech business in 1999, said the firm's neutrality would be put at risk and its sales could be restricted if Nvidia is allowed to buy it.</p>

<p>Nvidia, a San Francisco-based chip-maker, announced yesterday that it had agreed to buy Arm from its current owner Softbank.</p>

<p>Hermann Hauser, who co-founded Arm in 1999, said the firm's neutrality would be put at risk and its sales could be restricted if Nvidia is allowed to buy it</p>

<p>While Arm's 3,000 UK workers are worrying about jobs, Hauser claims that the takeover will ruin the firm's business entirely.</p>

<p>He describes the company as the 'Switzerland' of chip-makers, in that it designs neutral products that customers can customise to their needs.</p>

<p>But many of Arm's customers are competitors of Nvidia, and Hauser thinks this will present a conflict of interest.</p>

<p>He said: 'There's a monopolies problem, and that's bad enough.'</p>

<p>But he also thinks that the sale of Arm to a US firm could pose politically motivated problems.</p>

<p>He called it an issue of 'economic sovereignty' for the UK, and said: 'The decision over whether Arm are allowed to export will be made in the White House and not Downing Street.'</p>

<p>Daniel Zeichner, Labour MP for Cambridge where Arm is based, said: 'We have got potentially huge leverage [in the tech industry] and we are letting it slip from our grasp.'</p>
