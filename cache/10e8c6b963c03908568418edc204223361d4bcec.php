<p>A third of mobile phone owners are being hit by a loyalty penalty which can cost them over £400 a year. The problem relates to the way smartphone and usage bundles are sold (street view of a Vodafone store in Melbourne, Australia, April 7, 2018)</p>

<p>Telecoms regulator Ofcom last year won voluntary commitments from most mobile sellers to reduce prices for out-of-contract customers. These came into effect in February. </p>

<p>But Which? said providers have taken different approaches to applying these commitments. </p>

<p>It found a third of customers whose contracts had ended in the last two months are effectively overpaying on their bill. </p>

<p>The worst affected were Three customers, where around four in ten of those whose contracts ended in the last six months said they saw no price drop.</p>

<p>Based on current contract costs, Which? said a Three customer with a Samsung S20 5G phone could end up overpaying by £37 a month – £444 a year – once the contract term is up. </p>

<p>Two in five EE customers saw no drop in price when the initial contract and bundle came to an end. For Vodafone, it was three in ten. </p>

<p>EE and Vodafone offer small discounts to customers when contracts end, but they only take effect after three months. </p>

<p>Which? said an EE customer with a Samsung S20 5G phone could end up overpaying by £26.20 a month – equivalent to £314 a year. </p>

<p>Which? calculated that phone companies make around £182million a year from customers continuing to pay for a handset they already own (stock) </p>

<p>A Vodafone customer with an iPhone 11 could pay £32 extra a month – or £384 a year. </p>

<p>Which? head of home products and services, Natalie Hitchins, said: 'If you think you might be out of contract or overpaying, check your phone bills to see if you can save money with a SIM-only deal or with an upgrade to a new phone.' </p>

<p>Three said it sends all customers a notification at the end of their contract which shows their options and the corresponding prices. </p>

<p>EE said the Which? allegations were 'entirely wrong' and that it contacts customers before and after the end of their contract to inform them of their options. </p>

<p>Vodafone declined to comment. </p>

<p>Ofcom insisted the commitments it won from mobile networks have cut bills for millions. </p>

<p>But it admitted its powers are limited and criticised Three for not doing more.</p>
