<p>Return! Jorgie Porter is returning to Hollyoaks for part of a plot surrounding her on-screen family, the McQueens, as the soap turns 25</p>

<p>'And the anticipation of coming back has taken so long because of lockdown, but coming back felt just like home and as if I haven't even been away for five minutes.' </p>

<p>Despite her nerves, Jorgie admitted she has been able to get back into her character 'as if she's never left'.</p>

<p>She added: 'Everyone's still the same and they're all amazing and inviting. I've been on set a few times now and I've had the best time and Theresa has literally jumped right back into my body and my mind as if she's never left.' </p>

<p>Theresa left the village in March 2016 for a new life in Spain with her daughters, Kathleen-Angel and Myra-Pocahontas.</p>

<p>Last seen: She quit the soap in 2016 when her character flocked to Spain with her children</p>

<p>Comeback: The 32-year-old actress will reprise her role as Theresa McQueen on the Channel 4 soap later this autumn and admitted she's 'a bit nervous' about it</p>

<p>Jorgie previously admitted she would love to see Theresa return to Hollyoaks as a 'grandma with 20 kids'.</p>

<p>Speaking in 2018, she told BANG Showbiz: 'I obviously love Hollyoaks, I'd never say never about returning in the future but I enjoy doing certain other things at the minute.</p>

<p>'I just like to experience other things. Because once you're in a soap, you're there. You're in a bubble.</p>

<p>'So as much as I love it, I like to space out a little bit. I'd love to go back one day, maybe as a grandma with 20 kids.'</p>

<p>She said: 'I was excited, but obviously a bit nervous. What if Theresa has gone out of my body and my mind?'</p>

<p>Back for more: She first appeared on Hollyoaks in 2008 and remained on the soap for the best part of a decade</p>

<p>Since departing, Jorgie has competed on Dancing On Ice and I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</p>

<p>She looked for love on Celebs Go Dating and acted in the remake of Are You Being Served?</p>

<p>She first appeared on Hollyoaks in 2008 and remained on the soap for the best part of a decade.</p>
