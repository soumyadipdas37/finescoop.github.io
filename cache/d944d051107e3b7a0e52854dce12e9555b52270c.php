<p>Maisie is just days away from beginning training for Strictly's new series, which will begin in October after being shortened due to the COVID-19 crisis, but is yet to even meet her professional dance partner.</p>

<p>Good Morning Britain presenter Ranvir Singh revealed that the contestants haven't prepared for the show yet earlier this month, leaving 2013 contestant Susanna Reid shocked.</p>

<p>She said: 'It's all happening a bit later. We can't - we've not met our partner yet. I am eating fewer Pringles if that counts towards training, but that's as far as it got.'</p>

<p>It was recently claimed that the male professional dancers are in fierce competition to be partnered up with Maisie.</p>

<p>It's nearly time! Maisie is set to begin for the new series of Strictly in the coming weeks, and the male pros are all reportedly keen to be paired with her due to her experience in the ballroom</p>

<p>Maisie, who stars as Tiffany Butcher on the hit BBC soap, won Strictly's Children In Need special alongside Kevin Clifton last year – making her a favourite to win.</p>

<p>It's also been reported she's been the number one choice for the male pros, given her prior experience in the ballroom.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'All the male pros really want to partner with her, not just because she’s young and fit, but she’s also proven herself to be a brilliant dancer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the auburn-haired beauty also reportedly turned down a record deal – which promised to make her 'the next Kylie Minogue' – so that she could take part on Strictly this year.</p>

<p>Winner: Maisie won Strictly's Children In Need special alongside former Kevin Clifton last year – already making her a favourite to win</p>

<p>She is said to have been told by BBC bosses that the singing career would need to be put on hold if she wanted to remain on EastEnders and take part in Strictly.</p>

<p>An insider added to the publication: 'Maisie wants to crack the music industry and several labels think she is really marketable. One told her she could be the next Kylie, with her girl-next-door looks and down-to-earth personality.</p>

<p>'But she was told she could not take a record deal and continue on EastEnders and Strictly due to the BBC’s commercial rules.'</p>
