<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Zac Efron has been cast in the upcoming remake of Firestarter from Universal Pictures and the horror experts at Blumhouse.</p>

<p>Drew Barrymore, 45, led the 1984 original shortly after she shot to fame from appearing in Steven Spielberg's E.T. </p>

<p>The film will follow a young girl who discovers she has pyrokinetic powers, or the ability to start fires, as well as the ability to see into the future.  </p>

<p>New role: Zac Efron, 32, has been cast in an undisclosed role in the upcoming remake of Stephen King's Firestarter, which was adapted in 1984 with Drew Barrymore starring; shown in May 2019</p>

<p>After she's kidnapped by a shady government organization seeking to weaponize her powers, her father, who developed telekinetic abilities as the result of a government experiment, tries to rescue her. </p>

<p>Efron's role in the film hasn't been announced, but he may be playing the young girl's father, or taking a darker turn to play one of the men hunting them down.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old High School Musical star recently moved toward darker fare when he played the serial killer Ted Bundy in the 2019 Netflix film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil And Vile.</p>

<p>The science fiction–horror film will be directed by Keith Thomas, who previously helmed the critically acclaimed demonic possession movie The Vigil.</p>

<p>Scott Teems, who scripted the upcoming Halloween Kills, will be writing the screenplay and executive producing. </p>

<p>Transition: The High School Musical star moved toward darker fare when he played the serial killer Ted Bundy in the 2019 Netflix film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil And Vile</p>

<p>Rehas: The original earned $17 million against a $12 million budget, but was panned by critics for being too similar to King's Carrie</p>

<p>Bad guys: Martin Sheen starred as a government agent trying to track Barrymore's pyrokinetic character down, while George C. Scott played an assassin</p>

<p>In addition to starring Barrymore, the 1984 original featured David Keith as her father, a young Heather Locklear as her mother.</p>

<p>Martin Sheen played a government official in charge of a secretive agency, while George C. Scott appeared as the assassin John Rainbird who was sent by him to kidnap the girl and her father.</p>

<p>The original film earned $17 million against a $12 million budget, but it was lambasted by critics, who complained that it was too much like another Stephen King adaptation, Carrie, and that Barrymore's character was underwritten.</p>
