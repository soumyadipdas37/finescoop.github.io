<p>He was given a 12-month community order and told to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £300 in costs and a £90 victim surcharge.</p>

<p>RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben said: 'In broad daylight and with people all around, this poor dog was beaten by his owner - who clearly had no regard for his legal responsibilities towards his animal.</p>

<p>'Fortunately, the dash-cam footage helped us to identify this individual and ensure we could take action.</p>

<p>'Clearly, this is no way to treat an animal - and thankfully, the vast majority of people across South Wales and beyond will be shocked by this footage, and the beating this poor cocker spaniel was subjected to.'</p>
