<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gary Lineker has been finally knocked off the top spot of the BBC's highest earning stars after being handed a £400,000 pay cut - with Zoe Ball now the corporation's best-paid big name.</p>

<p>The corporation's accounts were released at midday and showed the Match of the Day star, 59, had earned £1.75million last year, with Ball, 49, on £1.36 million.</p>

<p>But less than a minute later the BBC announced Lineker had signed a new five-year contract which involved a 23% pay reduction.</p>

<p>It means his pay will go to around £1.35 million, below Radio 2 host Ball's salary.</p>

<p>Lineker - who is often criticised for comments on Twitter - has also pledged to post more carefully on social media.</p>

<p>The choreographed pay cut saw him gloat online almost immediately, tweeting 'Oh dear. Thoughts are with the haters at this difficult time.'</p>

<p>Radio 2 DJ Zoe Ball will now overtake Gary Lineker as the BBC's highest paid stars </p>

<p>In the BBC's statement he was more restrained and added: 'I love working with the BBC, and am very proud to continue to be a part of their outstanding football team.</p>

<p>'I'm looking forward to the next five years - with a European Championship and World Cup on the horizon, it's exciting times for me and the team.'</p>

<p>Ball, 49, has become the highest paid female star at the BBC for her radio role - as the broadcaster revealed its staff bill has rocketed to £1.5billion. </p>

<p>Pay packets made through BBC Studios, the broadcaster's commercial arm and responsible for the likes of Strictly Come Dancing, Antiques Roadshow and Doctor Who, are not disclosed.</p>

<p>Graham Norton takes about £725,000 for his Radio 2 show and some TV work, but not his chat show.</p>

<p>Radio 2 DJ Steve Wright is on about £475,000.</p>

<p>Newsreader and election night presenter Huw Edwards is on more than £465,000.</p>

<p>Fiona Bruce takes home over £450,000 for her work on Question Time.</p>

<p>BBC Radio London's Vanessa Feltz is on about £405,000.</p>

<p>Desert Island Discs host Lauren Laverne makes the top 10 for the first time, with more than £395,000.</p>

<p>Broadcaster Stephen Nolan is on over £390,000 for his radio work, including 5 Live.</p>

<p>Match Of The Day's Alan Shearer is on the same figure.</p>

<p>Graham Norton and Steve Wright came in 3rd and 4th place in the BBC pay list today</p>

<p>Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce were in 5th and 6th in the new rich list published today</p>

<p>Laverne took over from Kirsty Young on the Radio 4 programme, while Bruce followed in the footsteps of David Dimbleby.</p>

<p>The BBC previously opposed the publication of salaries as a 'poacher's charter', but then-boss Lord Hall later said he welcomed the 'transparency'.</p>

<p>The salaries are being published amid questions about how the BBC will be funded in future.</p>

<p>The licence fee model is guaranteed until December 31 2027, the end of the current charter.</p>

<p>Decriminalisation of licence fee evasion could also be on the cards - but the BBC has warned that switching to a civil system would cost the broadcaster more than £200 million a year.</p>

<p>The BBC began means-testing the free TV licence for over-75s in August, having previously delayed its introduction because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>BBC director-general Tim Davie said Lineker has signed a new five-year contract with the BBC, but that he will take a 23% pay cut.</p>

<p>'And he has done so at a saving of nearly a quarter over his last contract,' he said.</p>

<p>'We are hugely honoured to have a broadcaster of such brilliance at the BBC.</p>

<p>'And this is a great example of giving audiences both the best talent and the best value.'</p>

<p>It came as it emerged last night that the BBC had given pay rises to more than 700 female employees since the start of its equal pay scandal.</p>

<p>A Freedom of Information request revealed that at least 84 women were given pay increases through formal processes between July 2017 and March 2020.</p>

<p>During the same period, 608 women received a pay revision or increase through an informal pay enquiry.</p>

<p>The pay revelations are set to reignite fury over the BBC's decision to strip almost 4million over-75s of their free TV licences.</p>

<p>The BBC has insisted it cannot afford the concession for all pensioners and says only around 900,000 who receive Pension Credit would continue to get it.</p>

<p>Last night pensioners' groups demanded the corporation slash star pay if they are to expect over-75s to pay for their licences.</p>

<p>Dennis Reed, of pensioners' campaign group Silver Voices, said: 'This increase shows a warped sense of priorities by the BBC in a time of difficulty.</p>

<p>'I would like to see them giving equal priority to poorer pensioners who struggle to pay their licence fee.' </p>

<p>Tim Davie, the BBC's new director-general, has vowed to slash the number of people employed by the corporation.</p>

<p>He is also clamping down on presenters' use of social media.</p>

<p>Davie added: 'Gary knows that he has responsibilities to the BBC in terms of his use of social media.'</p>
