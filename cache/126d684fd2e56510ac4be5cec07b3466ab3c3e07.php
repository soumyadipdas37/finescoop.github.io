<p>The nearly two-hour film has been viewed just under 11.5 million times in the two weeks since its debut.</p>

<p>Originally premiering in April at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, the doc is notable in that it shows an untold part of Paris's upbringing.</p>

<p>In the film, Hilton discloses that she suffered traumatic abuse at the hands of employees at a strict boarding school where she spent part of her childhood. </p>

<p>The star told Drew Barrymore this past Monday during the latter's new talk show that she now has 'trust issues' after her parents allowed her to be taken to a boarding school for troubled teens where she was beaten and put in solitary confinement. </p>

<p>Thousand-watt smile: Paris smiled and waved to the cameras as she made her way from her ride into the restaurant</p>

<p>In the movie, Paris shared that at age 16 while living in New York City two men took her out of her bedroom in the middle of the night as her parents cried. </p>

<p>The fragrance mogul said she was beaten, drugged and placed in solitary confinement without a blanket or food.</p>

<p>'All it did was give me trust issues, PTSD. I didn’t deserve to go there,' said the CEO.</p>

<p>'My mom and dad were just very strict and sheltered when I lived in LA,' shared the friend of Kim Kardashian. 'I wasn’t allowed to go on dates, couldn’t wear makeup, couldn’t go to a school dance. They just didn’t want me to grow up.' </p>
