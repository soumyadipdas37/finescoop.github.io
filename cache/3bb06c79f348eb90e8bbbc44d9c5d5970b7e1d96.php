<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A young woman has been left to raise her unborn triplets alone after her husband made a sudden 'snap decision' and ended his life. </p>

<p>Parents-to-be Matt and Ashleigh Conwell, from Brisbane, had been tightly budgeting to care for their three unborn babies after they both lost their jobs due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>But the 29-year-old's dreams of a happy family were dashed when her 'beloved soulmate' was hit and killed by a 4WD on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Queensland Police confirmed it was a self-harm incident, with Senior Sergeant Tom Nelson saying it had been 'very sad', the Courier Mail reported.</p>

<p>Parents-to-be Matt and Ashleigh Conwell, from Brisbane , had been tightly budgeting to care for their three unborn babies after they both lost their jobs due to COVID-19  </p>

<p>Queensland Police confirmed it was a self-harm incident, with Senior Sergeant Tom Nelson saying it had been 'very sad'</p>

<p>Ms Conwell's sister, Emily Fallon, said her brother-in-law was 'genuine and caring' but had been struggling after losing his job.</p>

<p>'It was a snap decision, a moment of clouded judgement, and totally out of character,' Ms Fallon said. </p>

<p>'This year's been tough for everyone, even the strongest people you thought could get through it, and while there were some struggles and stresses there, it just shows suicide doesn't discriminate.' </p>

<p>Ms Conwell's entire family has rallied around her with love and support to show she is not alone in raising her children.</p>

<p>'There is a tribe behind her, and there is going to be a village that raises these babies,' Ms Fallon said. </p>

<p>Ms Conwell's best friend Alex Nesevski said what happened to Mr Conwell was 'never in the plan'.</p>

<p>She told Daily Mail Australia all the couple ever wanted was to start a family.  </p>

<p>A Go Fund Me page has been inundated with friends and family offering financial and emotional support to Ms Conwell (pictured with her husband)</p>

<p>Matt Conwell (pictured) died 'under sudden and tragic circumstances' on Wednesday</p>

<p>'They found out in early June that they were going to become a mum and dad, but during the second visit to the doctor that they found out it was three,' Mrs Nesevski said.</p>

<p>'No one believed them when they said it was triplets - the family thought they were joking around. You don't think you'll end up with three in your first pregnancy.'</p>

<p>Despite the financial hurdles, the couple were 'overjoyed' at the news and started planning their new lives as a family-of-five before the tragedy.</p>

<p>Mrs Nesevski said the shocking loss of her husband 'tore Ashleigh apart'. </p>

<p>'Losing Matt has placed an almost overwhelming burden on her, and she's the strongest person I know.'</p>

<p>'She keeps saying "I'm going to be strong for our babies".'</p>

<p>Mrs Conwell, whose late husband was a talented cricket coach, also joked that she is 'growing a mini cricket team in her belly'.</p>

<p>The expectant mother was one of the first on the scene of the accident, where she broke down</p>

<p>She has vowed to raise the children knowing who their father is and says she will instil his strong morals into them as they grow.</p>

<p>Mrs Nesevski said the costs of pregnancy, delivery and caring for triplets that would be 'challenging for any couple' are especially difficult for a single mum. </p>

<p>'They were already stretching every dollar and budgeting tightly for the arrival of their unexpected but so very wanted family ... the financial hardship she now finds herself in is significant,' she said.  </p>

<p>'She has to see a specialist every two weeks because carrying three babies is a huge physical strain - growing bones and brains.'</p>

<p>To help with the enormous costs, Mrs Conwell agreed to let her friend set up a Go Fund Me page to help with finances.</p>

<p>'Ashleigh isn't the sort of person who would ask for help, and money can never replace the loss of her husband, but she knows she needs support.'</p>

<p>The page has been inundated with friends and family offering financial and emotional support to the mother-to-be. </p>

<p>The couple (pictured) met in 2008 when Mr Conwell saw his future wife pictured on the cover of a local newspaper after she attended a fundraising event for leukaemia</p>

<p>'Sending you a million hugs from the other side of the world. Stay strong and know that we are here thinking of you always,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'As a new mother of twins and a wife of a police officer, this is my greatest fear. I hope you find the love and support you and the babies will need. My heart breaks for you, and I pray you deliver three healthy babies,' another shared. </p>

<p>Upon seeing her face and reading her name, the then 20-year-old contacted her on MySpace.</p>

<p>After weeks of messaging each other, 17-year-old Ashleigh agreed to meet at Cleveland Harbour in Brisbane's west.</p>

<p>Mrs Nesevski said she was hesitant to meet up with the stranger at first, but 'the date went extremely well,' she laughed.</p>

<p>Their 2017 wedding featured a copy of the news story that brought them together.</p>

<p>Phone Lifeline on 13 11 14 for suicide support and information.</p>
