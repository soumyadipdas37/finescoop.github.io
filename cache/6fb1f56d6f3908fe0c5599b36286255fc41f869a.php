<p>Marlon is due in London in Thursday ahead of finalising terms.</p>

<p>Fulham are set to complete the £13.7million signing of Brazilian centre back Marlon Santos</p>

<p>Scott Parker is looking to bolster his defence after shipping goals against Arsenal and Leeds</p>

<p>Sassuolo kept five clean sheets in the 23 league games played by the defender last season with the club finishing eighth in Serie A. </p>

<p>Fulham have suffered two defeats in their opening two Premier League fixtures and Scott Parker is looking to strengthen his squad before the end of the window.</p>

<p>Marlon would help bolster the Cottagers defence after they conceded seven goals across the two opening league games, with Arsenal scoring three before Leeds put four past them. </p>

<p>Sassuolo kept five clean sheets in the 23 league games Marlon played in the 2019-2020 season</p>

<p>Fulham still want another defender and remain in talks over a deal for Red Bull Leipzig winger Ademola Lookman.</p>

<p>The winger has failed to become a regular at the Bundesliga side after completing a £16.5m transfer last summer.</p>

<p>Benfica midfielder Florentino Luis is also still on their radar though Southampton have also been offered the chance to sign the 21-year old on loan with view to a permanent £30m deal. </p>
