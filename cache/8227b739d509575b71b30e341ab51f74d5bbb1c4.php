<p>EXCLUSIVE: Anna Vakili has discussed her one-year relationship with her mystery boyfriend for the first time</p>

<p>Curvaceous bombshell Anna first rose to prominence during her stint on Love Island, where she embarked on ill-fated flings with Sherif Lanre, Ovie Soko and Jordan Hames. </p>

<p>Shortly after leaving the Mallorcan villa last summer, the media personality embarked on a new relationship, but has kept mum on her partner's identity ever since.  </p>

<p>'He's a private person who doesn't have Instagram', the TV star, who has teased her beau in her cheeky Instagram captions, told us.</p>

<p>She also admitted that while they're going strong, tying the knot and starting a family are not priorities for the pair. </p>

<p>'F**k society's stereotypical standards!' The Love Island star, 30, admitted the 'serious' couple are 'not ready' to get married or have kids just yet (pictured on his arm last month)</p>

<p>Anna explained: 'I think I feel pressured to get married and have kids because of my age. I do want to marry him in the future. Coming from a Middle Eastern background, being married and having kids by 30 is very much pushed onto us. </p>

<p>'I don't care as I'm not going to give in to the pressure, I'm not ready to get married or have kids, I'm having too much fun. F**k society's stereotypical standards!'</p>

<p>Despite not wanting to be in the public eye, her cheeky man interrupted her interview to joke: ' I consider our relationship to be very serious, but if I go public, I'd have 300-400 girls messaging me as I'm so handsome. </p>

<p>'I don't want to create this drama, I want to preserve the love. I believe the Instagram lifestyle is for fashion mostly, it's not for me.' </p>

<p>Elsewhere in the discussion, the influencer reflected on her experience on the ITV2 dating series and how it has produced a wide range of opportunities for her. </p>

<p>The Twickenham native said: 'I wish I didn't take it so seriously, I dealt with things in the villa like I would outside. If I could turn back time, I would have taken things more lightly. </p>

<p>'It's so surreal, I watched it for years and I'm grateful to have had that opportunity. It's paved the way for us to have our own collection together, it's like a dream come true.</p>

<p>'Success isn't all about the money, it's about being able to do things with my sister that I couldn't do before, creating things, and being content and comfortable.' </p>

<p>During the start of lockdown, Anna returned to work as a pharmacist to help out during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>On whether her comeback was a long-term plan, she said: 'I dip in and out of it. When Covid was at its peak, I went in on a consistent basis.</p>

<p>'As people we're coming back to work, I didn't feel like I was needed as much so I decided to put my focus on the collection. I'm still going to pop in and out of being a pharmacist as I studied for it for so long, so if I ever need it, I can always go back.'</p>

<p>The Instagram model has teamed up with her sidekick Mandi to launch their inclusive collaboration with Peachland, available from Wednesday.</p>

<p>Revealing the driving force behind their fashion edit, Anna said: 'We want the collection to embrace all women of all sizes. It's very inclusive. </p>

<p>'As Mandi and I are really tall and have really big boobs, it's really difficult to wear clothes from other brands as they have capped cup sizes. We want to give off powerful energy from or collection.'</p>

<p>The FIYAR collection with Peachland is available now and features 100 pieces, available in sizes 6-16 and priced from £10-£40.   </p>
