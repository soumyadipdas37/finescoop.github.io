<p>Jamie Carragher has blasted a decision to award Newcastle a late penalty against Tottenham</p>

<p>The visitors were handed a late spot kick after the ball struck the arm of Eric Dier on Sunday</p>

<p>New signing Callum Wilson stepped up and made no mistake in dispatching the spot kick beyond Hugo Lloris to snatch a point at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. </p>

<p>The 2020-21 campaign has seen a handful of controversial decisions relating to penalties awarded for handball, with Manchester United's Victor Lindelof and Crystal Palace's Joel Ward already harshly punished this season.</p>

<p>And Carragher has vented his fury with the interpretation of the rule, exclaiming that the rule as it is currently followed is 'ruining football'.</p>

<p>After consulting VAR, referee Peter Bankes awarded the Magpies a controversial penalty</p>

<p>Carragher slammed the decision while on commentary, calling for drastic changes to be made</p>

<p>'It’s an absolute disgrace. An absolute joke,' the Liverpool legend fumed over Sky Sports commentary. </p>

<p>'Newcastle fans will be ecstatic, I can understand that. But everyone else in this country will say exactly what I am saying and what I am thinking. </p>

<p>'Eric Dier jumps for the ball, has no control of where his arms are going, there is a header half a yard away from him, hits him on the back of the arm, has no idea what is going on.'</p>

<p>Carragher made a direct plea to football's governing bodies to immediately change the way the law is interpreted, so as to stop controversial decisions being made. </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho was angered by the decision, storming into the tunnel before full time</p>

<p>Mourinho's assistant, Joao Sacramento, was given a red card for complaining to the referee</p>

<p>'This is a joke. Whether it’s the Premier League, the FA, FIFA, [Pierluigi] Collina, whoever’s involved in this – stop it, because you are ruining football for everybody. Absolute joke.'</p>

<p>Spurs boss Jose Mourinho stormed off down the tunnel before the spot kick was even struck, with the Portuguese tactician angered by the late decision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is believed that Joao Sacramento, Mourinho's No 2, was given a red card by Bankes as a result of remonstrating with the referee's decision at full time.</p>

<p>The result means that Spurs have picked up four points from a possible nine so far this season, and take on Mourinho's former club, Manchester United, next.  </p>
