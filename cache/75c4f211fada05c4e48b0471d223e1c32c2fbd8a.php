<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jill Biden kept her mask on even when she went to kiss her husband after the presidential debate last night - while Melania Trump was bare-faced for her end-of-the-night appearance.   </p>

<p>The Democratic nominee's wife wore her dark green face covering when she took the stage at the end of the evening, complying with the coronavirus rules for the few dozen audience members allowed to attend in person. </p>

<p>First lady Melania Trump and the president's children Eric, Donald Jr, Tiffany and Ivanka were wearing masks when they arrived at the Cleveland debate venue, but were later pictured watching the contest with their faces bare.</p>

<p>Melania kept her mask off at the end despite being a more consistent advocate of mask-wearing than the president - who last night mocked Joe Biden for wearing 'the biggest mask I've ever seen'.  </p>

<p>Mask and no mask: Jill Biden kept her face covering on when she embraced her husband - while Melania was bare-faced when she took the stage </p>

<p>Jill Biden kept her mask on when she took the stage to kiss her husband Joe at the end of the presidential debate in Cleveland last night </p>

<p>Melania Trump had discarded her mask by the time she joined her husband Donald on stage following a rancorous first debate of the 2020 campaign </p>

<p>Members of the Trump family including (from left) Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany and Donald Jr took their masks off during the debate in Cleveland on Tuesday night </p>

<p>The Trump family had posed in their masks when they arrived for the debate, but several of them were bare-faced before the contest began. </p>

<p>At one stage, Melania still had her mask on while Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany and Donald Jr had taken theirs off, but the first lady subsequently took hers off too. </p>

<p>According to NBC News, a Cleveland Clinic doctor in a white lab coat approached guests of the Trump family to ask them to put on masks.  </p>

<p>But the effort apparently did not succeed, and the doctor did not approach the president's family themselves. </p>

<p>One debate hall staffer told the doctor 'that's all you can do' as the medic walked away. </p>

<p>Most in the crowd did abide by the social distancing and mask-wearing rules, with at least one audience member even wearing a bright red 'MAGA' face mask. </p>

<p>Some in Trump’s section tried to greet the first lady with a standing ovation as she walked in, but with the sparse crowd it did not come together. </p>

<p>Donald Trump pulled a mask out of his suit pocket during the debate with Biden, saying that 'I put a mask on when I think I need it'. </p>

<p>However, he took a swipe at Biden for wearing 'the biggest mask I've ever seen' even if his audience was '200 feet away'. </p>

<p>Trump previously mocked Biden after the former vice president wore a mask at a Memorial Day event in May.  </p>

<p>The president retweeted a post by Fox News analyst Brit Hume which made fun of how Biden looked and said 'this might help explain why Trump doesn't like to wear a mask in public'.  </p>

<p>Asked about the tweet, Trump said it was 'very unusual' to wear a mask outside and accused a reporter of trying to be 'politically correct' by wearing one himself.  </p>

<p>Biden called Trump a 'fool' in response, saying in an interview that 'this macho stuff' was costing lives. </p>

<p>The Trump party - from left, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Lara Trump, Tiffany Trump and Ivanka Trump - were wearing masks when they arrived at the debate </p>

<p>...but Eric Trump (left) and Ivanka Trump (right) had taken their masks off before Donald Trump and Joe Biden began sparring </p>

<p>At one stage, Melania still had her mask on while Eric, Ivanka, Tiffany and Donald Jr had taken theirs off </p>

<p>But Melania took her mask off and did not put it back on when she went on stage later in the evening </p>

<p>Donald Trump pulled a mask out of his suit pocket, saying he wears one when needed - but mocked Joe Biden for wearing 'the biggest mask I've ever seen</p>

<p>Trump previously said he 'did not want to give the press the pleasure' of seeing him with a mask, while saying he had worn one away from the cameras. </p>

<p>The president finally changed his tone in July, saying it was 'patriotic' to wear a mask. </p>

<p>Melania Trump, by contrast, had let Americans see her in a face mask as long ago as April while urging people to take the health regulations 'seriously'. </p>

<p>'As the CDC studies the spread of Covid-19, they recommend people wear cloth face coverings in public settings when social distancing can be hard to do,' Melania said on April 9.</p>

<p>A nearly identical message from Melania was shared on the official White House YouTube channel the same day. </p>

<p>Only days earlier, Donald Trump had said he could not see himself greeting 'presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens' while wearing a mask. </p>

<p>The president's daughter Ivanka Trump also urged people to follow CDC guidance on April 13, sharing a photo of herself and her daughter Arabella wearing home-made face coverings. </p>

<p>Ivanka was seen wearing a mask in public as long ago as May, and her use of face coverings has exposed her to criticism from Trump supporters. </p>

<p>Joe Biden has made numerous appeals for Americans to wear a mask during the pandemic, sharing footage of himself putting on a face covering. </p>

<p>Joe and Jill Biden wave to the audience after the first debate, which was described as a 'hot mess' with moderator Chris Wallace struggling to maintain order </p>

<p>Melania Trump took her socially-distanced seat alongside her stepdaughter Ivanka Trump, who had taken her mask off </p>

<p>Melania wore a $3,340 figure-flattering pinstripe suit from one of her favorite designers, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, while Jill wore a green silk dress with fringing detail on the front</p>

<p>Jill, 69, wore a mask with dark green cloth design from Athleta last night, almost exactly the same shade as her fringed frock.</p>

<p>The former second lady wore a green silk dress with fringing detail on the front, a design she was previously seen wearing at a fundraising event in 2017. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Melania, 50, wore a $3,340 figure-flattering pinstripe suit from one of her favorite designers, Dolce &amp; Gabbana. </p>

<p>The first lady opted for a disposable white face covering to match the white button-up that she wore under her suit.  </p>

<p>Ivanka wore a mask with a floral design but took it off as she took her seat next to Melania, while there was no sign of the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner. </p>

<p>The president's family boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland as they headed to Ohio for the debate. </p>

<p>Trump's sons Eric Jr and Donald, their respective partners, and the president's son Tiffany were also in the traveling party. </p>

<p>The Trump party also included White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and supportive congressman Jim Jordan. </p>

<p>Organizers said there were about 80 people in the audience, including campaign staff, hosts, health and security officials and journalists. </p>

<p>All the guests were tested for coronavirus before the debate, and seats were set with programs and antibacterial wipes. </p>
