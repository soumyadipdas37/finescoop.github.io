<p>Jesus said: 'Ruben is having a send off, not only for what the team has accomplished, but for he game [2-0 win over Moreirense] he's played, too. </p>

<p>'He was the captain, scored a goal so everything was brilliant. His future looks brilliant too, we all believe that. </p>

<p>'My biggest wish was to leave in the right moment, and I think we, all the people I work with, the people at home that support me, we managed that,' Dias said. </p>

<p>'I have always wanted to leave with a smile on my face, I have been here at Benfica for a long time. All in all, I just want you to know, you know it already, that I am leaving happy and you should be happy for me too, that I am keeping working on my dream. </p>

<p>'I have always – even though I love this club – wanted this moment to come and I am conquering that. I'll take you all in my heart. </p>

<p>'My biggest wish is that you guys smash it and become champions. I was already in that mood and it's also hard to leave because of that. Have great success and the coach is here to do that, guide us to the top so I just hope you win and smash it all.'</p>
