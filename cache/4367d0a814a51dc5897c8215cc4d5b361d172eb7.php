<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the amusing moment a woman struggles to unlock the door without noticing that the other section is missing glass.</p>

<p>Marichu Gaston had just finished indoor table tennis at a building in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during a day off. </p>

<p>She holds the key to the building entrance and uses it to unlock the door when the group are about to leave.  </p>

<p>Marichu Gaston was trying to open at a building in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but didn't realise the door next to it was missing a glass panel </p>

<p>She appears fixated on the door, and turns the key several times before finally managing to pull it open. </p>

<p>As soon as the glass door is unlocked one of her friends steps through the adjoining door which she hasn't realised is missing a glass panel.</p>

<p>When Ms Gaston realises her mistake the group erupt into laughter, and everyone steps through the other door. </p>

<p>As soon as the glass door is unlocked one of her friends steps through the adjoining door which she hasn't realised has been open the whole time </p>

<p>She closes the door to the main entrance and follows the crowd through the missing panel.      </p>

<p>One of the women in the video said: 'She actually doesn't have any clue that the door is broken but we just let her do it and see her innocent reaction.'</p>

<p>The video was taken in a building on Jalan Damansara, a major road in Kuala Lumpur, and one of the oldest in the city. </p>

<p>The hilarious moment happened on August 16. </p>

<p>She appears fixated on the door, and turns the key several times before finally managing to pull it open while the group watch </p>

<p>When Ms Gaston realises her the other door was open all along the group erupt into laughter, and everyone steps through the missing panel </p>
