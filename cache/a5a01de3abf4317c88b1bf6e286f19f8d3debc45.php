<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>After a long summer wearing sandals, chances are your feet need some serious TLC. Amazon shoppers claim to have found the best way to get soft, smooth, callus-free feet - and it's currently marked down.</p>

<p>Enter the Plantifique Natural Superfoods Foot Peel Mask. Now £9.99 (that's 33 per cent off), the foot exfoliator's impressive formulation includes milk and plant extracts including sweet peach and papaya, that dissolves dead skin until it literally sheds off your feet.</p>

<p>In short, this foot peel is simply a pair of socks drenched in exfoliating acids that help slough away and remove hard dead skin for baby-smooth soles. It's genius.</p>

<p>Chemical and enzyme foot peels, such as the Plantifique Natural Superfoods Foot Peel Mask, are a must-have for baby-soft feet</p>

<p>With over 1,000 perfect five-star reviews and an impressive rating of 4.3 out of 5, this beauty product is much more than a gimmick.</p>

<p>Among the rave reviews, buyers say that the whole process is low-effort and extremely effective. One reviewer dubbed the foot peel 'fantastically gross'.</p>

<p>'This product is INCREDIBLE!' one reviewer wrote. 'It smells great and super easy to use. Within five days, my feet have started peeling.</p>

<p>'Currently, on day seven and the temptation to peel it myself is unreal! The skin underneath is so smooth and moisturised! 100 per cent will be buying again!'</p>

<p>'OMG, this really works,' another weighed in. 'Left socks on for 90 mins and by day two my feet started to peel. On day five now and getting larger pieces of skin come off, very satisfying.</p>

<p>'It says not to pick and peel the skin, but it's so hard to resist the temptation!'</p>

<p>For best results using the Plantifique Natural Superfoods Foot Peel Mask, soak your feet daily for 10 to 20 minutes after the application </p>

<p>'Cannot rave about this enough!' wrote one five-star reviewer. 'Absolutely without a doubt better than any pedicure out there. My feet are as soft as my one-year-old's.'</p>

<p>But be warned: while it's a painless and effective treatment, it's also gross, and you will want to steer clear of sandals during the process, which can take up to two weeks depending on the state of your soles.</p>

<p>The set from Plantifique, which comes with two pairs of masks and usually costs £14.95, is currently reduced to an affordable £9.99.</p>

<p>And if you're repulsed by the idea of a peel, don't knock it until you've seen the impressive before and after photos on Amazon.</p>
