<p>EastEnders returned to screens on Monday, September 7 after it was forced off air when production was suspended during the coronavirus crisis.. </p>

<p>Last month, executive producer Jon Sen revealed bosses had to 'cheat' the social distancing rules with protective screens and have even drafted in the help of stars' real-life partners as body doubles for intimate scenes. </p>

<p>Jon explained that like many other soaps they've used clever camera methods to hide the two metre distance between cast members.  </p>

<p>But he also revealed that they've used perspex screens between stars to continue filming passionate kiss scenes, and have even used some of the cast's real-life partners as body doubles.</p>

<p>Camera trickery: As they said goodbye, the railing hid their faces as they moved in for a farewell kiss</p>

<p>He said: 'When we came back we had to devise methods where we could cheat the distance, it's very odd shooting like this, never before in TV history have we made drama in this way, certainly we were forced to work with this 2 metre rule.  </p>

<p>'I, alongside a few of our core directors, got together and we tested and tested and worked about what methods we could employ to achieve distances. </p>

<p>'It was like learning skills from the very beginning, obviously you've seen the perspex screens we've used, which is really good as it gives an intimacy to a performance that wouldn't be possible otherwise. </p>

<p>'We use plate shots which are very basic CGI shots which are two people in the final scene that look like they are sitting at the same table, but actually they've been filmed in complete isolation from another, when you're actually filming you'll be talking to space actually.  </p>

<p>'We hit on the idea of supporting artists from the same household, we have artists who are students, or husband and wife who would be walking down Bridge Street and of course they can get closer than the two metres. Or they can be kissing in the street, it really adds to the sense of life.</p>

<p>'We've also used real-life partners as well, when there are moments or intimacy or kissing, and we have to choose our moments carefully because takes much more time to film like this but for those really crucial moments when characters kiss we've invited real-life partners of actors onto the set to achieve those kind of moments.'</p>
