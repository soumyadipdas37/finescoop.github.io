<p>And Kendall Jenner, 24, made an uncharacteristically low-key arrival in a crop top and tracksuit bottoms at Milan Fashion Week on Friday.</p>

<p>Joining the beauty was her pal Hailey Bieber, 23, who also opted for a casual look in an oversized black jacket and trainers.</p>

<p>Relaxed: Kendall Jenner, 24, made an uncharacteristically low-key arrival in a crop top and tracksuit bottoms at Milan Fashion Week on Friday</p>

<p>Kendall ensured she was comfortable for her journey in loose fitting bottoms and added another layer by donning a checked shirt.</p>

<p>The brunette beauty wore her locks down and let them bounce over her shoulders as she exited the airport.</p>

<p>Not forgetting her accessories, Kendall toted a large Louis Vuitton holdall and added some cool shades.</p>

<p>Hayley also cut a fashionable figure in a large black coat which she paired with a simple t-shirt and baseball cap.</p>

<p>Arrivals: The brunette beauty and her model pal Hailey Bieber both donned face masks as they stepped out in Milan</p>

<p>She tied her blonde locks back into a ponytail and added a selection of stylish rings and necklaces to complete her look.</p>

<p>Both of the models made sure to stay safe and follow travel regulations during the coronavirus pandemic by wearing face coverings as they arrived in Milan. </p>

<p>Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Already several well-known models have been seen in the city, with Irina Shayk and Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski walking in Hugo Boss' show on Friday.</p>

<p>Off she goes: Kendall added a layer to her look by donning a checked shirt and also wore comfortable white trainers for the journey</p>

<p>Kendall's trip comes after her sister Kylie was left unimpressed by a snap shared by their eldest sister Kim Kardashian. </p>

<p>'Delete this immediately,' Kylie, 23, instructed Kim, 39, in the comments section of the photo, which was taken circa 2009 and posted Friday. </p>

<p>In response, Kim hilariously referenced P Diddy's penchant for shamelessly cropping out celebrities from his photos.  </p>

<p>'Should I Diddy crop you out?' Kim asked. </p>

<p>'Absolutely,' Kylie replied back.  </p>

<p>Throwback: Kendall's trip comes after her sister Kim Kardashian shared an epic throwback </p>

<p>Fine by me! Kylie approved a 'Diddy crop' of the photo, allowing her sister to shamelessly remove her from the image </p>

<p>Fans flooded the comments section, remarking on just how different everyone looked in the flashback photo than they appear nowadays. </p>

<p>The women did all look dramatically different, whether it be because of their young age at the time the snap was taken or because of their hair color.  </p>

<p>The photo appeared to have been taken at a restaurant, where Kim and Khloe sat at the table while their younger sisters posed beside them. </p>

<p>Model in the making: A young Kendall wore braces in the throwback Kim posted </p>

<p>Pre-teen Kylie rocked a side-swept bang and allowed her freckles to shine through with hardly a touch of makeup on her face.</p>

<p>Kim still looked glam as she sat at the center of the table, with her honey-hued locks perfectly sleeked to the side.  </p>

<p>Kendall flashed a sweet smile as she posed in the back, years before becoming a superstar in the world of modeling.</p>
