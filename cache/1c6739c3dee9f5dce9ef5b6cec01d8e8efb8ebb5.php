<p>'You were there whenever I needed you, you taught me how to cook gourmet food like roast potatoes, chicken and salad, and tacos - the essentials in our household,' he wrote.  </p>

<p>'You gave me a slight insight into fashion by dressing me in up in dresses and putting makeup on me when I was young. You'd sit behind me while I ate dinner and would pick at anything pimple looking on my back - even if it was just a mole,' he added.</p>

<p>'You were my second mother, you were my biggest sister, you were my friend, and you were a fighter until the very end,' he continued. </p>
