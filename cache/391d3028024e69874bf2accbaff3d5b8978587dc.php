<p>Baby boy: Chrissy Teigen took to Instagram to share an ultrasound image of her 'sweet strong boy' with her 31.3million followers on Thursday</p>

<p>'Today I had to postpone the cookbook indefinitely and send <?php echo e('@'); ?>AdeenaSussman alllll the way back to Tel Aviv,' began Teigen in a series of Twitter posts.</p>

<p>Sussman is a renown author and recipe developer who played an integral part in the production of Chrissy's first two cookbooks, Cravings and Cravings: Hungry for More. </p>

<p>Cravings hit shelves in 2016 and proved to be smash hit among food lovers, which prompted the release of Cravings: Hungry for More in the fall 2018.</p>

<p>Chrissy added that, along with hitting pause of her cookbook, she has had to shut down filming on her popular Quibi series Chrissy’s Court. </p>

<p>'Baby cannot do it. I am devastated,' she concluded, referencing to her impending baby boy. </p>

<p>A pregnancy defined as 'high-risk' requires more caution than a standard pregnancy due to the varying 'health conditions and circumstances' at play, according to Baby Center.</p>

<p>Those, like Teigen, who are dealing with a high-risk pregnancy are encouraged to get lots of rest and, if possible, significantly reduce their stress/workload.</p>

<p>Shortly after unveiling the postponement of her book and Quibi series, Chrissy returned to Twitter to thank her publishing team Clarkson Potter for their patience.</p>

<p>'I don't have to say this as they've already established they are sticking with me through all these tough times, but I would like to call out Clarkson Potter as the best publishing team ever.</p>

<p>'They've kindly dealt with every bout of depression, postpartum, book delays, everything.'</p>

<p>She noted that Clarkson Potter 'were always the first to tell [her] to take care of [her]self, when so many others would say "ok f**k you're out".</p>

<p>'I love them. love you <?php echo e('@'); ?>francis_lam so much,' Teigen concluded.</p>
