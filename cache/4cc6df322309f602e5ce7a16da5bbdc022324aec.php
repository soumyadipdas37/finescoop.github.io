<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former Bachelorette star has been charged with possessing cocaine after recently landing a role as a drug dealer in an Australian film. </p>

<p>Jess Glasgow, a former councillor for Noosa in the Sunshine Coast faced the Noosa Magistrates Court on Tuesday after he was allegedly caught with the drug in July.</p>

<p>The 37-year-old was due to appear in court on September 1 but failed to show up and instead submitted a medical certificate.</p>

<p>Last week, Glasgow said the charges were a result of a 'miscommunication'.</p>

<p>Former Bachelorette contestant Jess Glasgow (pictured) has been charged with possessing cocaine</p>

<p>The former reality star was pulled over by police on July 18 and taken to Noosa Police Station for a breath test,  The Courier Mail reported.</p>

<p>He was then allegedly found with cocaine and charged with possessing a dangerous drug. </p>

<p>Glasgow's lawyer Patrick Meehan on Tuesday asked for the substance to be tested.  </p>

<p>'The charge in my submission a minor possession charge … I'd ask for a lengthy adjournment,' he said.</p>

<p>'The defendant doesn't know what the drug is, so we are asking for the drug to be analysed.'</p>

<p>Magistrate Chris Callaghan said the drug had been identified as cocaine and accepted the adjournment request.</p>

<p>The 37-year-old had been pulled over for a breath test before the drugs were allegedly found</p>

<p>Glasgow was booted from last year's Bachelorette after making inappropriate comments to Angie Kent</p>

<p>'You just need a shop front certificate, you don't need to know the quantity or the purity you just need to know the identity of the drug,' he said.  </p>

<p>Glasgow recently revealed he had been casted in a movie about the Gold Coast's drug underbelly - and that he would play a real estate agent and dealer.</p>

<p>He was booted from The Bachelorette after making inappropriate comments towards Angie Kent and several female producers last year. </p>

<p>In October 2019, the mayor of Noosa, Tony Wellington, said in a statement: 'With his appearance on the reality TV show The Bachelorette, Councillor Jess Glasgow has revealed behaviour that is totally inappropriate for a Noosa councillor, indeed for any individual.' </p>

<p>Mr Wellington went on to say that Jess brought the council's name into 'disrepute' and 'undermined' its the good reputation. </p>

<p>During one episode on the season filmed last year the contestants were taking part in a farmyard themed photoshoot.</p>

<p>Glasgow was dressed as the backside of a horse when he 'joked' that Angie was going to 'ride' him.</p>

<p>He later positioned his head close to Angie's bottom and proceeded to poke his tongue out and make rude sexual gestures.</p>

<p>In another cringeworthy moment, he brazenly told her: 'Don't mind me if I get some wandering fingers, alright?'</p>

<p>A furios Kent eventually found out and sent him home.  </p>

<p>Glasgow will face court again on October 27. </p>
