<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England stars Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden face being kicked out of the squad after they were filmed bringing girls into the team hotel in Iceland - breaking strict coronavirus quarantine rules. </p>

<p>The young Three Lions pair will not travel with their team-mates to Denmark today after footage emerged of the pair bringing girls back to the hotel.</p>

<p>The images, published by Icelandic outlet DV days after the pair made their senior international debuts in a win over Iceland on Saturday, appear to show Foden, 20, and Greenwood, 18, disregarding strict protocols put in place to ensure Covid safety among the players. </p>

<p>England's squad was given an exemption from Iceland's quarantine rules, which mean all foreign travellers have to quarantine for 14 days - regardless of how long their stay in the country is.</p>

<p>Instead, Gareth Southgate's men were banned from meeting anyone outside of their bubble and were only allowed to go to their training facilities and the match while in the country. </p>

<p>A Snapchat clip released by DV appears to show England youngsters Phil Foden (pictured) and Mason Greenwood in a hotel room with female company</p>

<p>Foden, above with Man City boss Pep Guardiola, has a two-year-old son and a girlfriend </p>

<p>Iceland has strict rules on quarantines for incoming travellers.</p>

<p>As of August 19, all travellers from risk areas to Iceland that enter the country are obligated to go into a 14 day quarantine.</p>

<p>This is regardless of duration of the intended stay in Iceland or purpose of the visit. </p>

<p>It can be shortened by undergoing  testing for COVID-19 on arrival and again on day five of the quarantine.</p>

<p>But the England team struck up a deal with Icelandic authorities so the team could play their Nations League clash with Iceland on Saturday.</p>

<p>As part of the rules, the England team were told to isolate in the hotel, only leaving to go to training and matches.</p>

<p>The pair's conduct in bringing girls back has also contravened the FA's behavioural rules for players whilst on international duty.</p>

<p>In the short clip, Foden and Greenwood appear to be wearing their new England training wear and the players are now in hot water with management.</p>

<p>In an interview with DV, one of the girls in the Snapchat video allegedly filmed in the hotel room said: 'We had no idea about these [Covid-19] rules, they never said we could not take pictures.'</p>

<p>Another girl claimed to have notified the England stars that the pictures were in circulation with a Snapchat message, but 'they have not opened it'.</p>

<p>She also claimed to have been talking 'with one of the boys for a few days'.</p>

<p>She said: 'The only thing I can say is that I had been talking to one of them for a few days. I'm not going to say where.'</p>

<p>Foden has a two-year-old son and a long-term girlfriend, while United star Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend back in May. </p>

<p>Manchester City midfielder Foden started for Gareth Southgate's side against Iceland on Saturday night, making his senior international debut.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Greenwood, who starred for Manchester United at the end of the recent Premier League season, came off the bench to achieve the same accolade. </p>

<p>United's Mason Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend Harriet Robson back in May</p>

<p>City star Foden regularly posts pictures with his young son, who turned one back in January</p>

<p>Greenwood, pictured in training on Sunday, will head back to Manchester United on Monday</p>

<p>Foden was all smiles on Sunday but is now leaving the camp under a dark cloud this week</p>

<p>England's senior stars trained on Monday morning, but Foden and Greenwood were absent</p>

<p>The likes of James Ward-Prowse (centre) and Jack Grealish (left) were in high spirits on Monday</p>

<p>While the pair would have been looking ahead to England's next fixture against Denmark in Copenhagen on Tuesday night, they will now leave Iceland and return home.</p>

<p>The pair were both absent from England training on Monday and it was then confirmed that they would leave the camp and travel home before the team's second and final match.</p>

<p>England boss Gareth Southgate is set to face the media for a press conference on Monday afternoon, where he is likely to field questions about Foden and Greenwood's behaviour. </p>
