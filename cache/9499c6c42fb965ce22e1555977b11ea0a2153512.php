<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A father was outraged after he was told off by an angry woman for using a shopping centre parents' room to change his daughter's nappy.</p>

<p>Josh Anderson was at a Westfield in Auckland, New Zealand, when he used the shared bathroom with his five-month old daughter, Vienna.</p>

<p>After feeding Vienna, changing her nappy and using the toilet himself, Mr Anderson walked out of the parents' room only to be confronted by a furious woman.</p>

<p>Josh Anderson (pictured with wife, Kori) was at a Westfield shopping centre in Auckland when he decided to use the bathroom with his five-month old daughter, Vienna</p>

<p>'He came out of the cubicle with my daughter and the lady waiting with her son straight away said, "You're not allowed to use this facility because it's for women only. Can you not see the sign? You have no right",' Mr Anderson's wife, Kori, told the NZ Herald. </p>

<p>Ms Anderson said she was 'absolutely livid' over her husband's treatment and the fact the woman referenced the image on the door of a child and adult wearing skirts.</p>

<p>The woman claimed this meant the bathroom was only allowed for women despite it being called a 'parent-child toilet'.</p>

<p>She told Mr Anderson he should only be using the male bathroom as 'that's what all the men are supposed to do'.</p>

<p>Following the confrontation, Mr Anderson asked a cleaner if what he did was allowed and the cleaner said: 'Of course, all parents are welcome to use it, mums and dads'. </p>

<p>Ms Anderson took to Facebook saying the woman needed to learn some 'common decency and gender diversity'. </p>

<p>'Josh just got absolutely ripped into by a mum for using the parents room in Westfield Manukau as he took our five-month-old daughter in for a nappy change, a bottle and to use the bathroom,' she wrote.</p>

<p>After feeding Vienna, changing her diaper and using the toilet himself, Mr Anderson walked out of the parent's room only to be confronted by an angry woman</p>

<p>Ms Anderson said she was 'absolutely livid' over her husband's treatment after the woman referenced the image on the door of a child and adult wearing skirts</p>

<p>'It’s called a PARENTS room for a reason.</p>

<p>'Apparently the Mum’s reasoning was that even though the sign said "parent-child room" the symbol was of a person in a dress.'</p>

<p>Mr Anderson told Seven Sharp: 'I’m a dad and have every right to use these rest rooms, it does say parents and child.</p>

<p>'I know the picture doesn't show a man, but I'm just looking after my daughter for the day, I can't take her to the men's room and leave her pram out.' </p>

<p>Westfield confirmed the parents' rooms are for all parents, guardians or caregivers.</p>
