<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A young woman passionately kissed her own father live on breakfast radio on Friday.</p>

<p>The shocking moment happened on Australia's Kyle and Jackie O Show as part of a challenge called Boyfriend or Daddy.</p>

<p>The segment involves a woman coming into the studio with a male companion, then hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson have to guess whether it's her boyfriend or her father.</p>

<p>Pass the bucket! This is the horrifying moment a woman, 26, makes out with her own father, 49, live on breakfast radio - leaving the hosts completely shocked </p>

<p>If the 'couple' are able to trick the hosts, they take home a $1,000 prize.</p>

<p>Explaining the segment, Jackie said that she and Kyle make their judgements based on 'body language and how uncomfortable [they] might be with certain questions'.</p>

<p>It's usually fairly easy for them to tell whether the pair are lovers or related, but Friday's guests went the extra mile to convince they were dating.</p>

<p>They shared a quick kiss as they entered the radio studio, but Jackie said this didn't mean anything because her father also gives her a peck on the lips occasionally.</p>

<p>The Kyle and Jackie O Show's newsreader, Brooklyn Ross, also noted that the pair had been holding hands  minutes earlier outside in the green room. </p>

<p>The older man introduced himself as 49-year-old named Nick, and the woman said she was a 26-year-old named Stacy.</p>

<p>The radio hosts asked the 'couple' what their favourite sexual position was. Despite the uncomfortable nature of the question, they didn't miss a beat.</p>

<p>'I like underneath, absolutely' said Nick, as Stacy nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>The sexually charged questions continued, as Kyle asked Nick if he enjoyed oral sex with his 'younger girlfriend'.</p>

<p>Stacy said she 'taught him a lot' about the subject, prompting Kyle to say: 'Okay, this is going to be really weird if it ends up being the father.'</p>

<p>Kyle hastened to add: 'But her job is try and win the money - don't forget. So you can't believe anything she says.'</p>

<p>As they reached the end of the segment, Jackie said she was torn and couldn't tell if the pair were a couple or father and daughter.</p>

<p>She added that she was slightly in favour of them being related because of their family resemblance.</p>

<p>'There's only one way to decide this,' Jackie said. 'Would you guys be willing to give each other just a little kiss on the lips?</p>

<p>'Because if it's your dad, I wouldn't want to be encouraging a pash or anything...'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't mind!' interrupted Kyle, prompting the guests to share a lingering kiss live on air.</p>

<p>'They are fully kissing! It's a make out,' said Kyle in disbelief, before Brooklyn added: 'It has to be a boyfriend after seeing that... I'm disturbed.'</p>

<p>'It has to be the boyfriend,' said Jackie.</p>

<p>'It can't be the father. No one kisses their father like that... unless you live in the mountains and don't have any neighbours,' Kyle replied. </p>

<p>But it turns out Kyle, Jackie and Brooklyn were wrong.</p>

<p>'The things we do for money. This is actually my father!' Stacy revealed, as the entire studio burst into horrified laughter.</p>

<p>'My boyfriend's going to be mortified!'</p>

<p>The hosts were shell-shocked, with Jackie yelling: 'No! That didn't just happen!'</p>

<p>In-studio footage of the father and daughter kissing was broadcast on The Kyle and Jackie O Show's Instagram account, but has since been deleted.</p>
