<p>Ensemble: Sinead, who also goes by the name of Shuhada Sadaqat since converting to Islam, paired her shirt with black faux-leather trousers and heavy-duty boots</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Sinead appeared on The Ryan Tubridy Show on RTÉ Radio 1 and detailed her decision to train to be a healthcare assistant.</p>

<p>Of her reasoning, she explained: 'That's something that I wanted to do for years, it's not because of the Covid thing, it's not that I'm rushing to the frontline.</p>

<p>'The area that I want to work in ultimately is palliative care. The 28th of September, that's it, head down, it's just one year...that's how I'm making use of the time</p>

<p>'I had a whole year of shows booked...that's how I'm making use of the fact that I'm unemployed for the year.'</p>

<p>Sinead added that being a healthcare assistant was something she's wanted to 'do since [she] was a child' as she expressed her interest in going into palliative care.</p>

<p>'A huge impetus for me was one of my best friends in the world actually died about five years ago. </p>

<p>'He asked me one night would I sleep in the bed with him when he found out he was dying and I told him I would but in the end, I was too frightened and I didn't. </p>

<p>'I felt from then I would never leave a person alone and I let my friend down very badly. I didn't get into the bed with him because I was so frightened...of death and dying and of him dying.'  </p>

<p>New venture: On Wednesday, Sinead revealed she was going to train to be a healthcare assistant as it was something she's wanted to 'do since [she] was a child'</p>

<p>Sinead's outing comes after she opened up on her mental illness, insisting she 'wouldn't be here' if she didn't publicly reach out. </p>

<p>The Dublin-born star sparked widespread concern back in August 2017 when she released a teary-eyed 12-minute video on her Facebook page in which she stated that she had wanted to kill herself for two years. </p>

<p>A subsequent post on the page reassured fans the then 50-year-old was not suicidal, but the singer has made it known that she has been in the past. </p>

<p>'There was s*** going on in my life': Sinead's outing comes after she opened up on her mental illness, insisting she 'wouldn't be here' if she didn't publicly reach out</p>

<p>Speaking on Irish broadcaster RTE's Tommy Tiernan show last year, the Nothing Compares 2 U songstress shared: 'I was really seriously in danger of dying.'</p>

<p>Sinéad told the comic that a combination of factors left her feeling 'a bit mental', not specifying on whether she was talking about the 2017 video. </p>

<p>'There was s*** going on in my life that drove me a bit mental in the midst of which I had a radical hysterectomy which would drive anyone mental,' she said.</p>

<p>Sinead added: 'I can laugh about that now, but at the time it was terrible. I don't enjoy suffering and it is not like I am one of these artists who feels like I can't get creative unless I am suffering. </p>

<p>'In fact I am the opposite and it is over, thanks be to God. And the great thing about going mental is that you get sane again. So it is over. There is no point looking back or behind, if you get well you just keep looking forward.</p>

<p>'If I hadn't done the reaching out that I did do I wouldn't be sitting here, talking now, I really wouldn't.'  </p>
