<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy will take a hardline stance with rival clubs interested in Dele Alli ahead of the transfer deadline.</p>

<p>The England midfielder has been left out of the previous two matchday squads for Jose Mourinho, plunging his future into uncertainty.</p>

<p>Paris Saint Germain have a concrete interest in Alli, while Inter Milan boss Antonio Conte is a long-term admirer.</p>

<p>Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy will take a hardline stance over selling Dele Alli</p>

<p>Alli has been left out of the last two matchday squads by Spurs boss Jose Mourinho </p>

<p>But despite Alli appearing to lose his position as a first-team regular, Levy - who is a notoriously tough negotiator - will not let a player he valued at £100million only last season leave cheaply.</p>

<p>However, the likelihood of any club reaching that sort of fee in the current Covid-hit market appears to be relatively small.</p>

<p>That means the most likely scenario of Alli leaving this summer is on a season-long loan and to an overseas club given Levy's reluctance to sell to a domestic rival.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gareth Bale could return quicker than expected from injury, according to manager Mourinho.</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed last week how Bale was at around four weeks away from full fitness due to a pre-existing knee problem and would be put on an intense fitness programme to get him up to speed.</p>

<p>New signing Gareth Bale could return quicker than expected from injury, says Mourinho</p>

<p>The Tottenham manager is hopeful the Welshman can return to action inside four weeks</p>

<p>But Mourinho is hopeful he may return sooner, saying: 'He is so happy to be with a club of his heart. He is so happy to play for us.</p>

<p>'When a player has this motivation, many, many times you can shorten the period of recovering and shorten the period of getting fit and ready to play.</p>

<p>'We want to help him, so when he's available to train with the team, we're more than happy to have him and help him back to a level that made him one of the best players in the world.'</p>
