<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Scottish engineer is facing up to 30 years in a US jail after pleading guilty to trying to smuggle £400,000 worth of power generating equipment to Iran.</p>

<p>Colin Fisher, 45, was arrested as he flew from his home in Dubai to Florida to seal the deal to illegally transport the engine.</p>

<p>The US has a trade embargo imposed on Iran to prevent the sale of technology to the 'rogue state'.</p>

<p>The father-of-three, who is originally from Dundee, was arrested by FBI agents in August as he flew into Pensacola, Florida.</p>

<p>Colin Fisher (pictured), 45, was arrested as he flew from his home in Dubai to Florida to seal the deal to illegally transport the engine</p>

<p>He has now admitted working for the past three years to set up a deal to transport a gas turbine engine – which would have been used in an Iranian oil field – in contravention of an embargo aimed at preventing terrorism.</p>

<p>Fisher faces up to 20 years imprisonment for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and up to 10 years imprisonment for attempted smuggling.</p>

<p>Court documents revealed that Fisher, who serviced and maintained gas turbine engines while based in Dubai, had used code words to talk about the deal with his co-conspirators.</p>

<p>He had also produced false invoices to disguise the transportation of the turbine engine.</p>

<p>The father-of-three (pictured), who is originally from Dundee, was arrested by FBI agents in August as he flew into Pensacola, Florida</p>

<p>Fisher (pictured) made several trips to Florida to set up the export of the engine and was arrested as he arrived to help in loading it into a container for export</p>

<p>Federal agents were able to seize the engine before it was transported to a company in Dubai who were known to supply parts used in oil fields in Iran.</p>

<p>Fisher faces up to 20 years imprisonment for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act</p>

<p>US Attorney Lawerence Keefe said: 'Exporting technology to Iran is prohibited for a very good reason, yet this defendant chose to put his own self-interest above global and national security.</p>

<p>'This case should send a clear signal that the United States cannot and will not look the other way when persons endanger the safety of our nation and its people. We will enforce these laws, which are vital to our national security, against those both within the United States and abroad.</p>

<p>Fisher was charged was violating the International Economic Powers Act which is aimed at preventing Iran from developing weapons that could be used in terrorism. He pleaded guilty last week.</p>

<p>His wife Nichola runs a children's party business in Dubai where she lives with their three children.</p>
