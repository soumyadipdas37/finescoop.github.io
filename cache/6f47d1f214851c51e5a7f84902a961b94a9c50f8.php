<p>'My stomach tattoo is very sentimental. When my brother died, I was pregnant with my firstborn. So after he was born I got a tribute on my stomach,' she explained.</p>

<p>She confessed people will often ask her about the intricate tattoo, even though she tries to 'hide' it. </p>

<p>The tattoo features a geometric design, with her brother's name scrawled in the middle, above the words 'forever young'.</p>

<p>Stacey explained that she's self-conscious about the tattoo because it's so deeply personal, and admitted she tries to keep it covered up.</p>

<p>'I may or may not post a close-up one day, but it's very sentimental to me. Even with bikinis, I'll wear a one-piece or put a sarong over it,' she added. </p>

<p>Stacey is a single mum to two young sons, Kosta, five, and Kruz, three.  </p>
