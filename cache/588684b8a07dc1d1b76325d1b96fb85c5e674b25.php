<p>Back with a bang: Maz, who will be covering for Ash Pollard during her maternity leave, commenced her eagerly anticipated return to airwaves on Monday morning</p>

<p>It was late 2015 when Maz and her former radio co-host Dan Debuf were replaced by Rove McManus and Sam Frost. </p>

<p>A year later she explained she was on an airplane when her then co-star Dan texted her a link to a news article, revealing Rove McManus they were dumped from the show.</p>

<p>'So I got off the plane and I turned on my phone and Dan had sent me a text and I think the text said: "LOL" and it was a link to a newspaper article about how Rove McManus was taking over the Sydney breakfast show,' Maz told Game Changers: Radio podcast.</p>

<p>'I found out by text!' It was late 2015 when Maz and her former radio co-host Dan Debuf were replaced by Rove McManus and Sam Frost</p>

<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia about her shock demotion at the time, Maz said: 'Of course I was disappointed, but it wasn't my decision.'</p>

<p>'It had nothing to do with how awesome our radio show is and was about the direction the company is going in, and I can't take that personally,' she said.</p>

<p>It didn't take long before Rove &amp; Sam suffered a massive decline in ratings, prompting 2DayFM to cancel their show in 2017.</p>
