<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Royal Navy's flagship aircraft carrier will set out on its first operational mission with more US than British warplanes on board, under plans being examined by defence chiefs.</p>

<p>HMS Queen Elizabeth could deploy with as many as 20 US F-35 jets and just 16 UK F-35s under one scenario, defence sources told the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence is expected to rely on US jets to fill a gap in numbers because it has been too slow to buy its own F-35s.</p>

<p>The final numbers for how many F-35s will deploy with the £3.2billion carrier next year have not yet been decided, but there will be a maximum of 36 on-board.</p>

<p>A defence source said: 'US Marine Corps jets will make up the numbers – around 20.' </p>

<p>HMS Queen Elizabeth (pictured) could deploy with as many as 20 US F-35 jets and just 16 UK F-35s under one scenario, defence sources told the Daily Mail</p>

<p>'Plans for the carrier to deploy with some US jets are longstanding, but it was not clear how many the UK would be relying on.</p>

<p>It comes as a major defence review takes place, with discussions on whether the UK should buy only half its target of 138 F-35s.</p>

<p>The UK has so far agreed to buy 48 by the end of 2025 for £9.1billion. But there are concerns that the Government is preparing to buy as few as 70 in to total.</p>

<p>Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence select committee, said the carrier must not be turned into a 'multi-national' ship and the MoD had to order more jets. </p>

<p>He said: 'Are we setting a precedent which is then an excuse for Number 10 to cut numbers? We need an independent carrier strike capability – that is paramount.'</p>

<p>An MoD spokesman said: 'British jets will always lead UK carrier deployments. Training with our US allies speeds up our ability to deploy operationally.'</p>

<p>The aircraft carrier is expected to set sail on its first deployment in May next year.</p>

<p>Yesterday departure of the ship from Portsmouth on training exercises was delayed for a second day in a row after sailors tested positive for Covid-19. It is due to sail today.</p>

<p>A MoD spokesman said 'fewer than ten' of the 1,000-strong crew had tested positive and had gone ashore. </p>

<p>Those who had contact with them will isolate on board. In April the ship had to delay sailing after two sailors tested positive.</p>
