<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Apple has unveiled its iPad Air and alongside a new Apple Watch, the Series 6, and the iPad 8th Generation at its virtual 'Time Flies' event. </p>

<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced at the end of talk that it would be launching iOS 14 tomorrow. </p>

<p>The all new iPad Air has a tiny fingerprint sensor for TouchID built into the power button and is powered by a brand new chip, called A14.  </p>

<p>It also has a 12MP rear camera, a 10.9" liquid retina display and LTE mobile internet that is 60 per cent quicker than its predecessor. </p>

<p>The brand new iPad Air will be available next month and is set to retail for $599 in the US. </p>

<p>In line with expectations, Apple did not mention a new iPhone, which is expected to be announced in October due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pandmeic. </p>

<p>Apple announced its new range of iPad Air tablets, in five different colours, including rose gold (middle)</p>

<p>The firm's annual showcase was thrown into disarray following the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic</p>

<p>Apple also unveiled the 8th Generation iPad which comes with the A12 bionic chip. </p>

<p>The tech giant claims the 8th Generation iPad is 40 per cent faster than its predecessor and twice as fast as the top selling Windows tablet. </p>

<p>iPad 8th Generation will start at $299 for education users and is available to order today, with availability on Friday. </p>

<p>Apple previously updated its iPad Pro, and is now bringing higher specifications to the rest of its range of tablets.</p>

<p>Alongside the new hardware, Apple is also rolling out iOS 14 for the tablet which uses the device's computing power and pencil capability to detect handwritten text.  </p>

<p>As well as the tablet upgrades, Apple announced a range of new Apple Watches.  </p>

<p>Series 6 Watch ($399) Apple Watch SE ($279) are available to order today with availability on Friday.  </p>

<p>The firm's annual showcase was thrown into disarray following the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Instead of its usual in-person extravaganza, tech fanatics were invited to attend a virtual event streamed from Apple Park in Cupertino, California from 10am Pacific time (18:00 BST) today. </p>

<p>Shortly after launching, the stream had more than one million concurrent viewers.  </p>

<p>This is the time of year Apple usually confirms new iPhones - it was September 12 last year - but the firm said new iPhones won't be available until next month, fuelling speculation that it could hold a separate standalone event in October. </p>

<p>While there is no iPhone reveal, the new Apple Watch is decked out with a host of upgrades, including the ability to track blood oxygen levels</p>

<p>Apple is investing in the construction of two of the world’s largest onshore wind turbines, as part of its effort to become '100 per cent carbon neutral' by 2030.</p>

<p>The 650-foot turbines, located near the Danish town of Esbjerg, are expected to produce 62 gigawatt hours each year — enough to power almost 20,000 homes.</p>

<p>The electricity produced at Esbjerg will be used to power Apple’s 500,000-square-foot data center in Viborg, with all surplus energy going into the Danish grid.</p>

<p>It will also act as a test site for powerful offshore wind turbines, the company said. </p>

<p>Apple did not say how much it was investing in the project, which is being developed in partnership with European Energy.</p>

<p>While there is no iPhone reveal, the Apple Watch is decked out with a host of upgrades, including the ability to track blood oxygen levels. </p>

<p>An in-built blood oxygen level sensor shines red and IR light onto the wrist and measures what is reflected back.</p>

<p>Algorithms detect how much oxygen is present in the blood in just 15 seconds and Apple hopes this facility will provide key information for a range of scientific studies. </p>

<p>S6 is up to 30 per cent faster than the previous generation due to a chip adapted from the A13 bionic chip from the iPhone 11. </p>

<p>The Apple Watch also comes with improved 'always-on' display and altimeter. </p>

<p>S6 will also be available in blue aluminium, classic gold, grey/black and, for the first time, Product(RED). </p>

<p>Apple also made a big deal of its no 'solo' strap, a band of continuous silicone without a clasp or button.</p>

<p>Apple has also created dozens of new faces ranging from stripes to a tachymeter.</p>

<p>While it has added one marquee new feature and a host of new faces, bands and gimmicks, Apple is also taking a leaf out of the iPhone playbook and is creating an Apple Watch SE which uses the S5 chip and is a simplified version of the gadget. </p>

<p>Apple kept quiet before the event and there was no mention of an iPhone in the run up to 'Time Flies'. </p>

<p>Rumours were abound that it would be delayed due to supply chain issues brought about by the global pandemic. </p>

<p>Production delays in China, travel restrictions worldwide and related issues linked to measures designed to slow the spread of coronavirus are behind the delay. </p>

<p>With details of the new iPhone models likely delayed until next month, Apple is expected to spend today's event focusing on a range of other products. </p>
