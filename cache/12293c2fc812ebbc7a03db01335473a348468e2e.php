<p>While 2018 champion, Stacey Dooley, who was a guest on the podcast, also shared her high hopes for Jamie. </p>

<p>Discussing his return to Strictly as a contestant, he was forced to quit the 2019 series after suffering a foot injury, Spencer said: 'It is great news, I think you've got a really good chance. I put an outside bet on you as well.'</p>

<p>Confident: Stacey Dooley, 33, who won the 2018 series with now boyfriend Kevin Clifton, also backed Jamie for the prize (pictured after their win) </p>

<p>With Spencer explaining: 'No, no, no I put a bet on you to win it, I basically persuaded them that you're likely to break your foot again, that you almost certainly won't win and I'm feeling really generous, here's the cash.'</p>

<p>Sharing his confidence, Jamie said: 'What's going to happen with Strictly, right, is without a doubt, I am going to go on it and win it. I'm going to win it without a doubt!'</p>

<p>Spencer commented that it is a 'good way to think', with Jamie hitting back with: 'It's not a good way to think, I just know.</p>

<p>'I've got rhythm, instant talent, I told you, I still hold the record for the javelin throw.' </p>

<p>'Instant talent': Jamie also listed his skills, sharing that he has 'rhythm' and 'instant talent' with the star still impressively holding a javelin record at his school</p>

<p>She said: 'I'm a big fan of his, we met last year, I was certain he was going to win Strictly then he did his leg in and anyway, maybe this is your year!'</p>

<p>Stacey also offered some advice to Jamie and admitted that she wasn't the best dancer by 'any stretch of the imagination' but got 'less rubbish' as the weeks went on.</p>

<p>Jamie joins the likes of Caroline Quentin, Maisie Smith and Ranvir Singh - to name a few - on the dance floor. </p>

<p>It comes after it was revealed that Strictly Come Dancing will operate with a socially-distanced live studio audience when the series kicks off next month. </p>

<p>The BBC One show confirmed it will return with an eighteenth consecutive series in September, and has since outlined the safety measures put in place to ensure it continues to be aired in front of its traditional live studio audience.  </p>

<p>Producers have revealed that family bubbles of four will be allowed to watch the show while it is filmed at Hertfordshire's Elstree Studios, while face masks and social distancing will be compulsory for all members of the public. </p>

<p>Alleviating logistical concerns regarding the production of the show, a tweet posted on Monday read: 'To make the most if limited space we’ll have in the studio this year because of our social distancing measures, for the first time ever tickets will be allocated to groups of four, allowing you to come along as a family bubble / household group.</p>

<p>'We’ll be able to seat family groups of up to four people from the same household / social bubble at cabaret tables and in balcony seating. Cabaret tables and balcony seats will be allocated randomly, in advance of your arrival at the studio.' </p>

<p>While the show attempts to move on following the coronavirus pandemic, it's understood that its annual Blackpool special - a favourite among fans - will not go ahead for the first time in its history.</p>

<p>A BBC spokesperson told MailOnline that the series will not 'physically' travel to the famous Tower Ballroom this November, but promised to celebrate the 'iconic' venue from the studio. </p>

<p>In a statement they said; 'Blackpool is a milestone moment in every series of Strictly that our audience, our celebs and professional dancers look forward to. </p>

<p>Green light: It comes after it was revealed that Strictly Come Dancing will operate with a socially-distanced live studio audience when the series kicks off next month</p>

<p>'Whilst we'll be unable to physically go to Blackpool this series, we'll still be celebrating this iconic venue and bringing it to life from our studio in Elstree.'</p>

<p>Filming for the new series is reportedly scheduled to begin in September, with the professional dancers' group routines to be pre-recorded after they completed two weeks in isolation.</p>

<p>However the set was recently evacuated and given a 'deep clean' after a crew member tested positive for COVID-19. </p>

<p>A source later told MailOnline: 'The crew member is no longer on the production and has had a negative NHS test result.</p>

<p>'Procedures were followed and stringent protocols have been put in place just in case, but recording isn't due to happen until later this week so there is minimal impact.'</p>
