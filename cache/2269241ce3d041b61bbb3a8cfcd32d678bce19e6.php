<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Robert Pattinson has admitted he 'weirdly' enjoys the idea that he could possibly 'mess up' his portrayal of The Batman.</p>

<p>The actor, who recently returned to set for the superhero film after contracting coronavirus, admitted he likes being held responsible if something goes wrong - a feeling he experienced while filming Twilight.</p>

<p>Screen star Robert, 34, said in a new interview: 'There's a slightly different feeling when you know loads and loads of people are going to watch something you're working on.</p>

<p>'It's weird': Robert Pattinson admitted on Monday he 'weirdly' enjoys the idea that he could possibly 'mess up' his portrayal of The Batman (pictured in 2019) </p>

<p>'I weirdly enjoyed it during Twilight the idea that you can mess it up. I guess I felt confident. I wanted to be on the big stage.'</p>

<p>The thespian went on to discuss why the upcoming reboot is 'not an origin tale', telling Total Film magazine: 'For me, what's really important about this iteration is that you know a lot of the other stories are about how he had to master his fear and master himself in order to become Batman.</p>

<p>'I think this interpretation is incredible. I hope what's different about what we're doing is try and do it in exactly that sort of manner and then of course the other things that are from the earlier history of the context of him being the world's greatest detective and how we got there.'</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Robert made a comeback to The Batman set after he tested positive for coronavirus and halted production for two weeks. </p>

<p>An insider told MailOnline: 'Today is the first day the main production unit has returned to filming and there seem to be no other hiccups at the moment.' </p>

<p>A Warner Bros. Pictures spokesperson also confirmed: 'Following a hiatus for COVID 19 quarantine precautions, filming has now resumed on The Batman in the U.K.' </p>

<p>The source added that a significant part of the film was scheduled to be shot in Liverpool, but due to the pandemic, the shoot was cancelled and re-arranged several times, shifting the completion date for the project back even further.  </p>

<p>'I felt confident I guess': The London native admitted he likes being held responsible if something goes wrong - a feeling he experienced while filming Twilight (pictured in 2009)</p>

<p>American filmmaker Matt Reeves, who is directing the movie, revealed Liverpool will play an important role in The Batman at DC FanDome, a virtual convention held by DC Comics and Warner Bros.</p>

<p>During an interview, the film executive confirmed the English city would be the backbone for Gotham City as they shoot the remaining 75 per cent of the film.</p>

<p>The source also revealed that other films including Fantastic Beasts 3 had been affected by positive Covid-19 results, but none affecting the principle stars.</p>

<p>Other productions have had some smaller Covid alerts amongst crew or third party staff; no more so than Fantastic Beasts 3 whose dialect coach was confirmed positive on September 10. </p>

<p>'Fortunately the systems in place on that production meant the unit could continue to work without a hiatus,' the source added.</p>

<p>Matt still has three months of filming to complete with the eagerly anticipated film due to be released to theatres in October 2021.</p>
