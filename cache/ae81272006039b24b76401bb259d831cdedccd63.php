<p>But there is a reason behind why the pop-rock band, who hail from Sydney, purposely morph the way they speak overseas.</p>

<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday, Luke's older brother Jack Hemmings revealed the mystery surrounding his famous sibling's unusual accent.</p>

<p>'We definitely give it to him a little bit... it's more noticeable when we're with him over here in Australia,' Jack said of mocking his brother's American twang.  </p>

<p>'I think depending on where he is, if he's here or he's back home [in the States], he has to sort of morph his accent so he can be understood,' Jack explained.</p>

<p>He added: 'I know when I'm visiting him over there, It's hard to get your point across every now and then, or when you're trying to order. He sort of has to be a hybrid depending on where he is.'  </p>

<p>In 2018, 5SOS singer Michael Clifford spoke about his newfound American accent during an appearance on KIIS FM's Kyle And Jackie O show. </p>

<p>'I think all of us kind of have to chameleon a little bit into other accents,' he explained on behalf of the band.</p>

<p>'People in other countries just don't understand Australians and that's a fact.'</p>

<p>He added: 'If anyone from Australia has travelled overseas, no one knows what the f**k we're talking about, so you have to change your accent and you have to adapt.' </p>
