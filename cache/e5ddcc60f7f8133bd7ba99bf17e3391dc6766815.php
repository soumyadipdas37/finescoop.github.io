<p>The dermatologically tested Lacura Beauty foundation from Aldi Australia (pictured) has caught the attention of shoppers after a woman shared photos on social media </p>

<p>Customer Hete was so pleasantly surprised with the product she said it's the 'best low-cost foundation' she's ever tried</p>

<p>'I have to say it is one of the best or the best low-cost foundation I have ever tried. It was easy to apply, not greasy and I had pretty good coverage,' Hete said on Facebook.</p>

<p>'I use the $60+ high end type of foundations but this Aldi one is pretty good.</p>

<p>'I recommend it, my shade is medium beige the lighter version,' she said.</p>

<p>According to the product description, the foundation hides imperfections while keeping the skin hydrated and is best to apply with a brush or sponge. </p>

<p>But there were mixed responses from other customers online who said the budget Aldi foundation is quite difficult to apply onto the skin. </p>

<p>'I've tried it, found it really thick and hard to apply. My sister loves it though,' one shopper said.</p>

<p>'It turned a yellow undertone on my face and started to run after an hour - wasn't so impressed,' another said.</p>

<p>A third added: 'I find it a bit thick, but mix a little with my moisturiser and it's fine.'</p>

<p>But there were mixed responses from other customers online who said the budget Aldi foundation doesn't compare to good quality expensive alternatives</p>

<p>Whereas others said they will purchase the beauty buy again as they were happy with the long-lasting coverage it provides. </p>

<p>'I've been using it for years. Great coverage and lasts all day,' one woman said.</p>

<p>'I love it and the primer is amazing too,' a second said, another added: 'No complaints, all good!'</p>

<p>For the cheap price of $4.99, the foundation is worth trying and is available at Aldi store locations.</p>
