<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Are you looking for the best laptop for gaming, video and photo editing, or for streaming movies and TV shows? If so, you might want to consider HONOR's latest offering.</p>

<p>Whether it's for professional use or for leisure, the high performance MagicBook Pro offers fast processing, impressive battery life, immersive audio and visual quality for a wide range of tasks and lifestyles.</p>

<p>The laptop is currently reduced from £1,019.97 down to £849.99. The brand is also treating its customers to a free HONOR MagicWatch 2 or HONOR Magic Buds and HONOR Router 3 with the purchase of the laptop.</p>

<p>The high performance MagicBook Pro offers fast processing, impressive battery life, immersive audio and visual quality for a wide range of tasks and lifestyles </p>

<p>The sleek MagicBook Pro boasts a lightweight and durable aluminium design, weighing just 1.7kg and 16.1 mm thick at its thickest point. It is available in a smart Space Grey colour.</p>

<p>There are multiple ports, including: one 3.5mm headphone jack and two USB 3.2 Gen 1 port on the right, plus one USB 3.2 Gen 1 port, one USB-C port and an HDMI port on the left.</p>

<p>Its narrow 4.8mm bezel is all thanks to the concealed display controller board. The webcam has also been moved from above the screen to under a key. While I'm not a fan of the unflattering camera angle (double chin alert) it does offer better security and means it is only visible when you need it.</p>

<p>Speaking of security, the laptop also features a finger print power button, meaning the only person getting access to your laptop is you.</p>

<p>The 2020 MagicBook Pro features a 6.1 inch HONOR FullView display with a 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, making it aesthetically beautiful. The laptop's aspect ratio is 16:9 aspect ratio and resolution is 1920 x 1080.</p>

<p>It features 100 per cent sRGB, offering HONOR's best colour display yet. The truest to life colours and flicker-free technology are designed to help creative workflow, meaning it is the perfect device for productivity, as well as editing photos and videos. The flicker-free display also helps to reduce blue light in darker environment, meaning less eye strain and fatigue.</p>

<p>Virtual surround speakers are perfect for using streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, as well as watching YouTube videos and playing online games. The laptop offers a truly immersive experience and decent sound quality.</p>

<p>The MagicBook Pro has up to 11 hours all-day battery life, and a super fast charge offering 50 per cent charge in the first 30 minutes. I could also play online games in their highest resolution for at least a few hours without having the laptop on charge. </p>

<p>The sleek MagicBook Pro boasts a lightweight and durable aluminium design, weighing just 1.7kg and 16.1 mm thick at its thickest point</p>

<p>Dual fan and dual heat pipes offer sustained performance and efficient thermal management, keeping the laptop cool even when you're streaming a high resolution game, movie or powerful software.</p>

<p>The new MagicBook Pro comes equipped with the all-new AMD Ryzen™ 5 4600H Processor to help improve battery life, as well as an ultra-fast 512GB SSD storage drive and up to 16gb DDR4 dual-channel RAM for faster gaming performance. </p>

<p>Windows 10 is pre-installed, along with a one month trial of Office 365. It is a shame HONOR didn't pre-install Microsoft Office like they did with the MagicBook 14, especially when this is being described as a laptop 'for professionals'. </p>

<p>Overall, HONOR has gone above and beyond with the 2020 MagicBook Pro and I am thoroughly impressed with its gaming, streaming performance. The narrow bezel and large screen is also absolutely fantastic. The attractive sleek design and bright screen is also a big pro.</p>

<p>I would have preferred a larger hard drive, purely to be able to store more games and large video files, so I will have to continue storing my video edits on an external hard drive.</p>

<p>In terms of value for money, I think the MagicBook Pro offers a great deal of premium features at a lower price point, making it accessible for young professionals and students.</p>
