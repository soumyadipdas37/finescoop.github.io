<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Frank Lampard has revealed the importance of crunching the phones when it comes to sealing the biggest transfer deals.</p>

<p>Chelsea have shelled out more than £200million overhauling their squad this summer, and every high-profile new recruit has cited Lampard's personal touch as pivotal to their signature.</p>

<p>The Blues beat Liverpool to the punch to lure prolific Germany striker Timo Werner to Stamford Bridge for £53million, while Ajax's Hakim Ziyech and Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz were further big-name arrivals.</p>

<p>Brazil stalwart Thiago Silva, England full-back Ben Chilwell and highly-rated France Under-21 defender Malang Sarr have also come through the west London doors.</p>

<p>While the players have admitted Lampard's influence, the Chelsea boss himself has now admitted his part in pushing those deals over the line.</p>

<p>'You understand when it is the competition with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City that you need to state your best case to the player,' said Lampard.</p>

<p>'I think having been that player at one point, the idea as a manager is to try and sell the club and how I want to move forward.</p>

<p>Timo Werner turned down interest from other big European clubs to join Chelsea this summer</p>

<p>'Petr (Cech) in his role does the same and I do that to the best of my ability when I speak to players.</p>

<p>'With a player like Timo (Werner), we were very, very keen to bring him in. He needs to feel that from us, I loved everything he said to me in those kinds of conversations. And the same with all those kinds of players that I have spoken to.</p>

<p>'I think that the manager-player conversation is really important because our relationship needs to be good and positive going forward.</p>

<p>'All you can do is do your best as a club because you know the competition is doing their best, so I think we can be happy that we have brought in players of their level. That is just how we tried to work.'</p>

<p>Kai Havertz has also joined Chelsea as part of the spree which may see youngsters frozen out</p>

<p>Werner and Havertz should feature in Chelsea's Premier League opener at Brighton on Monday night, but Ziyech is out with knee trouble and Chilwell sidelined with the after-effects of a heel complaint.</p>

<p>Silva only started training at the weekend so the Amex Stadium trip comes too soon for the ex-Paris St Germain defender, but Christian Pulisic and Cesar Azpilicueta could feature on the south coast.</p>

<p>Chelsea's new-look squad will require time to adjust and for the new recruits to bed into Premier League life.</p>

<p>Time has been in short supply across a staccato pre-season thanks to the continued coronavirus influence, with Lampard well aware his new faces will all settle at a different pace.</p>

<p>Chelsea have agreed a deal worth up to £25million with Rennes for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy</p>

<p>'I am pleased and now it is stage two; it is about getting them settled and playing to the best of their abilities,' said Lampard.</p>

<p>'We need to give them all a bit of time, the players that are coming in to hit the ground running.</p>

<p>'We will do our best to have the environment to have the group working well to help individuals in that.'</p>
