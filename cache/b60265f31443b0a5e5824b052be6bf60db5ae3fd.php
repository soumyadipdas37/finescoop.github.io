<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A three-year-old collapsed and died at the home he shared with his twin after being found 'malnourished', an inquest heard.</p>

<p>Police are investigating Taiwo Abubakar's death after he was found dead by health workers.</p>

<p>Taiwo had been born in Nigeria but had been living at an address for asylum seekers in Cathays, Cardiff, before his death.</p>

<p>He was last seen three weeks before he died by a family friend who reported their concerns to police.</p>

<p>Coroner's officer Lauren Howitt said: 'He was found deceased at his home address. He appeared malnourished.'</p>

<p>A South Wales Police investigation was launched into Taiwo's death and inquiries are ongoing.</p>

<p>Taiwo was found at the home in Cathays, Cardiff, on June 29 this year.</p>

<p>Pathologist Dr Stephen Leadbeater gave no provisional cause of death to the inquest in Pontypridd, South Wales.</p>

<p>Senior coroner Graeme Hughes said: 'Due to the fact there is an ongoing South Wales Police investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death, there is sufficient reason to suspect the death may be unnatural.'</p>

<p>Mr Hughes adjourned the inquest until the police investigation and post mortem findings are concluded.</p>

<p>Three-year-old Taiwo Abubakar collapsed and died at home he shared with his twin in Cardiff after being found 'malnourished' sparking a police investigation into the circumstances</p>

<p>At the time of his death, police said they were called to the property at 5.40pm.</p>

<p>It is understood a woman and another young child were taken to hospital following the call.</p>

<p>The family were believed to have been housed by Clearsprings Ready Homes on behalf of the Home Office's asylum support system.</p>

<p>The Home Office said it was working with its accommodation providers and other authorities to support them in the investigation.</p>

<p>It is understood that Taiwo suffered a disability and was under the care of a UK children's hospital.</p>

<p>South Wales Police said: 'We can confirm the sudden and unexplained death of a young child at a house in Cardiff.</p>

<p>'Officers were called to the property in Cathays at 5.40pm on Monday, June 29.</p>

<p>'Cause of death has not been confirmed and enquiries are ongoing.'</p>

<p>The Home Office said in a statement: 'We are aware of an incident in which a young child sadly died.</p>

<p>'Our thoughts are with their family and we are working with the local authorities and our providers to ensure they have as much support as possible.</p>

<p>'It would be inappropriate to comment while an investigation is ongoing and before all of the facts have been established.'</p>

<p>A spokesman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said it was 'co-operating with the investigation' but could not comment further 'at this time'.</p>
