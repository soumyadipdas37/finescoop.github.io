<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Alexander Povetkin will seek a mandatory fight with Tyson Fury and it could be in 81,000-capacity Luzhniki Stadium, if he wins the rematch with Dillian Whyte. </p>

<p>The Russian produced a stunning upset KO of Whyte in their first bout and is now preparing for their rematch on November 21. </p>

<p>If he wins, then he will be pushing the WBC for his mandatory title shot at Fury, who still has to face Deontay Wilder in a trilogy bout and has agreed to take on Anthony Joshua twice next year. </p>

<p>Alexander Povetkin will be seeking a fight with Tyson Fury if he beats Dillian Whyte again</p>

<p>Povetkin's promoter Andrey Ryabinskiy when asked if he will seek the shot at Fury, told Sky Sports: 'We will work in this direction.</p>

<p>'The fight for the world title is a big event in the career of any fighter, and with every reason for this, of course we will seek a mandatory defence from the WBC.</p>

<p>He added that the gigantic Luzhniki stadium is a 'possible location', should Fury honour the challenge rather than look past Povetkin and fight AJ, risking being stripped. </p>

<p>Fury (right) still has to face Deontay Wilder in their trilogy fight but it is yet to be arranged</p>

<p>'If such a fight takes place, it will really become an event in the boxing world, no matter where it takes place: in Russia or in any other country in the world </p>

<p>'You know, Sasha [Povetkin] has a very simple answer to this (fighting Fury).</p>

<p>''Champion, you say? Hadn't lost yet? Does everyone consider him the strongest in the division? Then, of course, I want to box with him!'''</p>

<p>Povetkin stunned Dillian Whyte having been knocked down twice himself to win last month</p>

<p>Povektin, 41, had been knocked down twice and was being outboxed by Whyte when he delivered a picture perfect uppercut to end their first fight. </p>

<p>Whyte had been in line for a title shot for 1000 days and no doubt 'Bodysnatcher' will also be pushing hard for his mandatory shot at Fury if he exacts revenge in November.</p>

<p>Fury may have to wait for his trilogy with Wilder as Frank Warren wants to have it in front of fans rather than miss out on the gate money, causing an organisational headache during the coronavirus crisis with no fans allowed in British or American arenas.  </p>
