<p>A curious mouse in Canada was caught chopping on cannabis leaves before being found passed out on its back 'high'</p>

<p>Colin Sullivan, from New Brunswick, Canada where cannabis is legal, said he found the rodent pinching leaves from his plants for two days in a row last week</p>

<p>Photos captured shortly after show the rodent lying in the middle of a heap of leaves, completely comatose.</p>

<p>Colin decided to put the animal in a cage where he started him on a '12 step programme' to keep it away from the plants long enough to get it back on its feet.</p>

<p>Six days later the mouse was released back into the wild.</p>

<p>Colin posted about the discovery on Facebook last Tuesday, writing: 'For two days in a row I've caught this little pothead taking leaves off of my plant and eating them until he passes out.</p>

<p>'He's missing an ear so it may be self medication for his PTSD but I still think it's time for an intervention.</p>

<p>'He's been weaned to one medium leaf per day and seems to be adjusting well.</p>

<p>'One day at a time my friend, one day at a time.'</p>

<p>'After a long and desperate battle with addiction this little mouse has grinded up his struggle, picked out the seeds and stems and is ready to roll out.</p>

<p>'Weed all benefit from joining together to help the smoke clear in any addict's life.</p>

<p>'He did his very cannibest and was awarded his first Twelve Step chip.</p>
