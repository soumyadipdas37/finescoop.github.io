<p>This photo of a whitetip shark surrounded by smaller zebra fish was taken in the Red Sea by Martina Andres. She said: 'As a diver, you will never forget your first big shark. I felt eternally grateful to encounter this beautiful oceanic whitetip shark in the Red Sea. As we neared the very last minutes of our dive, she and her 'entourage' slowly circled our group, peacefully looking at every single one of us, before they took off into the blue again'. The image received an honourable mention</p>

The funniest thing about this dive was that it took me ages to realize there was a porcupinefish inside the barrel sponge! I had my eyes glued on the sponge, looking for hairy squat lobsters, and only after a while did I see this camouflaged guy moving away from my camera with a smile on his face!'</p>
