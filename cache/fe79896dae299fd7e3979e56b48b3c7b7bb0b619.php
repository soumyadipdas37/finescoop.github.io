<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Filming for the Australian version of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! usually takes place in South Africa in early January, but that's all set to change in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>It appears the hit reality series will be filmed in Murwillumbah, in northern New South Wales, at a campsite normally used for the UK series.</p>

<p>According to TV Tonight, with production unable to travel overseas due to coronavirus travel restrictions, the 2021 series will be filmed in Australia.</p>

<p>Changing locations: I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! is tipped to be filmed in NSW at the same location where the UK series is shot. Pictured, hosts Julia Morris and Chris Brown</p>

<p>The campsite is less than an hour from the Gold Coast, off Dungay Creek Road, north of Murwillumbah.</p>

<p>The UK version of the show, which has been filmed in Australia for almost two decades, has also been forced to reconsider its location due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Back in May, ViacomCBS executive Beverley McGarvey confirmed the show would 'definitely be back next year' and that a potential change of format was on the cards. </p>

<p>At the time, Ms McGarvey explained I'm A Celebrity... could 'absolutely' be filmed Down Under.  </p>

<p>'The jungle is kind of a character in the show, but we just don't know if that's possible or realistic, so we're just looking at a range of options,' she told news.com.au</p>

<p>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! is just one of the many television shows to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
