<p>At the other end of the table, Southend Pier, the world's longest pleasure pier, earned what Which? described as a 'respectable customer score of 63 per cent'.</p>

<p>It added that although it features at the bottom of the list, it scored four stars for accessibility and lack of crowds.</p>

<p>Visitors praised the walk along the pier as a way to blow away the cobwebs and liked the option of taking a train from one end to the other to enjoy the views.</p>

<p>However, it scored just one star for entertainment and engagement, facilities, and food and drink.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the table is Southend Pier, pictured. It scored just one star for entertainment and engagement, facilities, and food and drink</p>

<p>Some visitors complained to Which? that the pier was 'run down' and 'not the most exciting place in the world'.</p>

<p>Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: 'With so many of us holidaying in the UK this year, we're all looking for new places to explore and these results provide plenty of inspiration, with some excellent lesser-known attractions alongside the favourites we already know and love.</p>

<p>'Our findings show that visitors value learning something new from the historical attractions they visit while providing value for money is another common feature of those near the top of the table.</p>

<p>'What's clear though is that whatever your budget, whether you're looking for a stroll down a pier or a saunter through a palace, the UK is blessed with fantastic locations for great days out.'</p>
