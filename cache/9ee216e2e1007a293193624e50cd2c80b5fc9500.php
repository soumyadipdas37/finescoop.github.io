<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ronald Koeman’s first day at the office ended with high-fives all round. </p>

<p>Has the new Barcelona manager really put out all those fires in just ninety minutes of football? </p>

<p>Sportsmail looks at the club legend’s dream debut.</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman watched his Barcelona team thrash Villarreal in his first game in charge </p>

<p>When Quique Setien took over last January a change in style and formation was expected but Barcelona fans never really saw it. </p>

<p>Under Koeman the shift from 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1 was clear. Against Villarreal it worked brilliantly. </p>

<p>Lionel Messi’s starting position in the team is at centre-forward with Antoine Griezmann, Philippe Coutinho and Ansu Fati (from right to left) lining up behind him. </p>

<p>The idea is that no one stays where they are for too long and in the carrousel of movement – with Messi and Griezmann in particular swapping positions – rival defences are turned dizzy. In part thanks to Villarreal’s dismally pedestrian display it certainly worked. </p>

<p>The interchanging of positions between Barcelona's forwards caused plenty of problems </p>

<p>Sergio Busquets and Frenkie de Jong played in the ‘double-pivot’ in front of the defence and Jordi Alba was given a license to get forward from left-back at every opportunity. </p>

<p>It will get far tougher tests than the one provided by Unai Emery (13 defeats as a visiting coach at Camp Nou in 13 games) but this was a very promising start.</p>

<p>He was pensive for the most part but it was notable that he was the presence in the technical area. </p>

<p>The modern penchant for the No 1 sitting down and the No 2 taking over, especially for set-pieces, does not seem to have reached Ronald’s world. He is the gaffer.</p>

<p>The 57-year-old was a notable presence in the technical area throughout LaLiga clash</p>

<p>He was honest and charming post match telling Spanish television pitch-side reporter Ricardo Sierra that his aside to Ansu Fati after taking him off was to tell him that he had performed at his best – this after having to tick him off after the last pre-season friendly of the season when he had told the 17-year-old that he was below par.</p>

<p>His substitutions were revealing. He obviously sees 17-year-old Pedri and 20-year-old Francisco Trincao as first options to compete with Philippe Coutinho and Antoine Griezmann. </p>

<p>There were minutes too for Ousmane Dembele. And Miralem Pjanic is clearly going to compete with Sergio Busquets for the position alongside Frenkie de Jong. </p>

<p>Pedri (left) and Francisco Trincao replaced Philippe Coutinho and Antoine Griezmann</p>

<p>But for other players he has made it clear – not just on Sunday but since he took over – that they might be best suited to look for a move before next Monday. Rafinha, Junior Firpo, Carles Alena, Riqui Puig and Martin Braithwaite probably all fit in that category.</p>

<p>There was a handshake at the end of the game. And this time it wasn’t a no-look one. Messi’s smile broadened the longer the first half went on. </p>

<p>He will clearly miss Luis Suarez who gave him more assists than any other team-mate in his career. But in this fluid new-look 4-2-3-1 it looks as if he will be well served.</p>

<p>Sergeant Koeman did not give the players a rest day after their big win. </p>

<p>They trained on Monday and will do so every day up to and including Thursday when they travel to Vigo for their second game of the new era. </p>
