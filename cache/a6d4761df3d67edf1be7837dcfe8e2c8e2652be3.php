<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>United States forward Alex Morgan is set to join Tottenham on a short-term deal.Â </p>

<p>It was widely reported on Friday that the 31-year-old, who has been playing for Orlando Pride, was poised to move to Spurs in a deal running to the end of December.</p>

<p>Morgan has scored 107 goals in 169 appearances for her country and was part of the World Cup wins of 2015 and 2019. She netted a header in the semi-finals against England at last year's tournament, memorably making a tea-drinking gesture as she celebrated.</p>

<p>Should the deal happen, Morgan - who gave birth to her daughter Charlie in May - will be another among a number of high-profile names to have moved to the Women's Super League since the end of the 2019-20 season.</p>

<p>That has included four other United States internationals, with Manchester City having signed Sam Mewis and Rose Lavelle and Manchester United earlier this week recruiting Tobin Heath and Christen Press.</p>

<p>Orlando Pride said they were not commenting on the reports.</p>
