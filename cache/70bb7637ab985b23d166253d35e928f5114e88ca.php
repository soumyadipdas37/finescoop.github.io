<p>A a trial by judge found there was insufficient evidence to prove the woman was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>

<p>The Melbourne woman had been charged with two counts of gross indecency with a person under the age of 16, and two counts of incest.</p>

<p>She was accused of a series of vile acts between 1985 to 1987, Newscorp reported.</p>

<p>This included allegations she had performed oral sex on the teenager, and that the pair had penetrative sex.</p>

<p>But she told the court she had never participated in any 'amorous or sexual conduct' with her stepson. </p>

<p>She had already been convicted over the charges twice after two separate trials by jury but the charges were thrown out after an appeal.</p>

<p>The woman was allowed to walk free after an appearance before Judge Michael Bourke at the Country Court of Victoria this week. </p>

<p>She appeared via audio-visual link due to COVID-19 restrictions in Victoria.</p>

<p>In handing down the sentence Judge Michael Bourke said he was unable to find enough evidence to convict her. </p>

<p>He said while the accuser appeared trustworthy and reliant he was unable to make his judgement based off a personal opinion.   </p>

<p>'The complainant presented as honest and apparently reliable in his account of the alleged conduct charged,' he said.</p>

<p>'However, I am obliged to go beyond such subjective assessment.</p>

<p>'There is no support for the complainant's (account) of the amorous grooming behaviour.' </p>
