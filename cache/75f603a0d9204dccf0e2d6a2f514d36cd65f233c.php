<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sri Lanka has shipped 21 containers full of 'recycling' back to the UK because it was full of rotting medical waste.</p>

<p>The Sri Lankan government said container-loads of waste were brought into the island in violation of international laws governing the shipping of hazardous material.</p>

<p>Previous illegally imported containers had included rags, bandages and body parts from mortuaries, according to officials.</p>

<p>The 21 containers (pictured) were holding up to 260 tonnes of rubbish were brought into the island in violation of international laws governing the shipping of hazardous material</p>

<p>The type of hospital waste was not revealed, but they departed Sri Lanka on Saturday according to customs.</p>

<p>The 21 containers were holding up to 260 tonnes of rubbish and had first arrived by ship in the capital Colombo's main port between September 2017 and March 2018. </p>

<p>The containers were meant to carry used mattresses, carpets and rugs, but had also contained hospital waste, officials said.</p>

<p>Customs spokesman Sunil Jayaratne said: 'The shipper had agreed to take back these 21 containers.</p>

<p>'We are working to secure compensation from those responsible for getting the containers into the country.'</p>

<p>Another 242 containers from Britain remain abandoned at the same port and at a free trade zone outside the capital.</p>

<p>The government said they were carrying illegal garbage in violation of international law and also arrived between 2017 and 2018.  </p>

<p>The government is currently engaged in legal action against the shipper to have the 242 containers removed from the country.</p>

<p>A Sri Lankan investigation last year into nearly 3,000 tonnes of illegally imported hazardous waste found the importer had reshipped about 180 tonnes to India and Dubai.</p>

<p>In the past two years several Asian countries have turned back container-loads of waste from foreign shores.</p>
