<p>Surprise! Five-time Grammy winner Billie Eilish announced to her 125.3M social media following on Monday that she will star in a documentary film titled The World's a Little Blurry (pictured September 10)</p>

<p>Inside look: The 18-year-old pop star was 'paid eight figures' through Interscope Records for her first-ever rock-doc, which will be released in theaters and start streaming on Apple TV+ in February</p>

<p>The World's a Little Blurry was directed by Emmy-winning producer RJ Cutler, who also helmed the 2009 Vogue documentary, The September Issue.</p>

<p>Eilish (born O'Connell) revealed on Monday why she debuted her song My Future at the Democratic National Convention on August 19 and urged fans to vote for presidential nominee Joe Biden 'like our lives and the world depend on it.'</p>

<p>'When I performed at the DNC and I was posting, "Please, please vote, blah, blah, blah," any sort of facts about the monster that's in the White House currently, I would see comments that are like, "Shut up and stop trying to be a politician. Stop talking politics,"' the homeschooled vegan told NPR. </p>

<p>'And I literally would laugh because I don't want to be doing this. I would rather be doing anything else than be talking about politics. But that should show you how vitally important it is right now to speak up.'  </p>

<p>Cutie: Billie only gave a quick glimpse of herself as a toddler banging on the piano in the Highland Park home she still shares with her parents Maggie Baird and Patrick O'Connell</p>

<p>Maestro: The World's a Little Blurry was directed by Emmy-winning producer RJ Cutler (R), who also helmed the 2009 Vogue documentary, The September Issue</p>

<p>Billie continued: 'A lot of young people are being enormous idiots right now, with not wearing a mask and partying and all that s*** - which I want to puke on every one...The people that give me hope are the people that are really outspoken about injustices in the world and speak up for not just their own rights but everyone's rights.</p>

<p>'I've learned a lot this year and I've tried to be even more open this year and listen to other people. It's nice to see the people that really, really care and want to fight. And I love that so much. And I'm going to fight with them, you know?'</p>

<p>Next up, Eilish scored an eye-popping 12 nominations - including Top Artist - at the 2020 Billboard Music Awards, which air October 14 on NBC.</p>
