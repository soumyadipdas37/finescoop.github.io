<p>Asked what her favourite part of her body is, Malin said: 'I love my bum! It's just a nice-shaped a**! And I love my tattoos too. I love everything about me - everything is equal'.     </p>

<p>The reality star is now an ambassador for the SANDs Charity, which raises awareness of and supports those affected by stillbirth and neonatal death.</p>

<p>The mental health activist previously said: 'Whenever I have lost control of a situation whether it be my baby girl dying after 4 weeks of life, and me not wanting to give up for her battle, or my 2 years of emotional abuse; I had to actually realise that somethings aren't in my control.</p>

<p>'I had to let go and let be. I had to understand that this was part of the process how painful it was.. but the thing I did have control of was my STRENGTH to carry on.' </p>
