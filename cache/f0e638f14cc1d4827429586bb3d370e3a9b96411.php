<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sightings of rare pink dolphins in Hong Kong waters have jumped since coronavirus lockdown halted ferry travel in the region.  </p>

<p>The Indo-Pacific dolphins - also known as Chinese white dolphins and pink dolphins - are moving back into parts of the Pearl River Delta off Hong Kong. </p>

<p>Their numbers have jumped by up to 30 per cent since March when ferry traffic was suspended due to coronavirus lockdown. </p>

<p>The dolphins once avoided the area due to the boat traffic between Hong Kong and Macau.   </p>

<p>Marine scientist Lindsay Porter, who has studied dolphins near Hong Kong for three decades, said: 'What we have noticed since the ferries have stopped in this area is dolphins we hadn't seen for four, five, six years are back in the Hong Kong habitat.</p>

<p>'It seems very quickly that the dolphins have come back into this waterway.' </p>

<p>'Normally this entire area would be full of fast ferries taking people from Hong Kong to Macau and back again,' Porter added.  </p>

<p>'Since the Covid pandemic started in Macau and a lot of areas have had restricted travel, the fast ferries have stopped. And these waters have become very, very quiet.' </p>

<p>The lull in water traffic has given scientists a rare opportunity to study how underwater noise affected the dolphins' behaviour. </p>

<p>From a small rubber boat, Porter and her team drop microphones into the water and use drones to watch for dolphins.</p>

<p>The research suggests the dolphins had adapted more rapidly than expected to the quiet environment, and the population was likely to rebound when such stressors were removed, Porter said.</p>

<p>Scientists think there are about 2,000 dolphins in the entire Pearl River estuary. </p>

<p>Marine scientist Lindsay Porter (pictured) said the lull in water traffic in the waters near Hong Kong has given scientists a unique opportunity to study how the dolphins respond to underwater sound </p>

<p>A Hong Kong government survey from 2019 found only about 52 dolphins entered the waters around the Asian financial hub, but Porter believes the real number may be slightly higher.</p>

<p>'I sometimes feel that we're studying the slow demise of this population, which can be really sad,' she said.</p>

<p>Still, even if this population's decline could not be stopped, the research could help other dolphin populations elsewhere, she said.</p>

<p>Hong Kong's conservation plans have focused on opening marine parks, where ship traffic is limited but not banned. Three of those areas are frequented by dolphins.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong WWF, a conservation group, and Porter said such measures were inadequate as dolphins were still in danger of being hit by ferries as they moved between the protected areas.</p>

<p>'It means that if we did have a comprehensive management plan in Hong Kong with more effective conservation measures, we might be able to quickly stop the decline in the dolphin population,' she said.</p>
