<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A heated debate has erupted over the correct way to serve and eat fairy bread, a traditional Australian party food.</p>

<p>The earliest recordings of fairy bread come from 1929 when The Hobart Mercury described children eating the iconic snack at a birthday party.</p>

<p>It's typically made using slices of white bread cut into triangles coated in butter and hundreds and thousands sprinkles on top. </p>

<p>But Reddit user Pokemaniacgaming unknowingly caused a stir online three days ago after posting his version of the childhood classic, except he chose to keep his bread whole, rather than cutting it into triangles.</p>

<p>He also dotted the sprinkles in the centre of the bread, rather than coating the entire slice.</p>

<p>'Triangles! This needs to be triangles. I was trying to figure out why this looked so wrong to me. I just weirdly can't imagine it tasting right if it's not in triangle form,' one person responded.</p>

<p>'Not cut into triangles. Traitor,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'What kind of animal doesn't have sprinkles to the edge and cut it into triangles? I guess it's still 2020'.</p>

<p>Others were mostly appalled by the lack of ingredients sitting on top of the bread, and said it was a 'p**s poor effort'.</p>

<p>'Did you run low on 100s and 1000s? They need to go right to the edges!!!' One woman said.</p>

<p>One person suggested filling a bowl with the rainbow sprinkles and pushing the slice face down into it to get a proper coating</p>

<p>'The 100s and 1000s density in the centre is also a little too high, hold the shaker at a higher altitude for more even coverage,' said another.</p>

<p>One person suggested filling a bowl with the rainbow sprinkles and pushing the slice face down into it to get a proper coating.</p>

<p>There was some backlash about the inclusion of crusts, which are often cut off in the original recipe - although this can be deemed wasteful.</p>

<p>While there is no exact science to how to eat your fairy bread, there should only ever be three ingredients included: bread, hundreds and thousands and butter.</p>
