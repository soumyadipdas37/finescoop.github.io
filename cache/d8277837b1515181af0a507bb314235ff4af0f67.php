<p>And Hugh Jackman looked like he could break into a musical performance at any moment as he sashayed down the streets of Soho, New York, with a cane and boater hat on Sunday. </p>

<p>Still the greatest showman! Hugh Jackman, 51, looked ready to perform as he stepped out with a cane and boater hat in Soho, New York, on Sunday </p>

<p>In the other hand, Hugh held a plastic protein shaker bottle.  </p>

<p>Covering up his famous face with a mask, the Greatest Showman star wore a black jumper, camel-coloured trousers and black-and-white sneakers.  </p>

<p>He shielded himself from the autumnal sun with a black baseball cap. </p>

<p>Just the essentials? The Australian star, 51, clutched the flamboyant accessories and a black leather tote bag in one hand as he strolled down the bustling sidewalk</p>

<p>Covered up: Covering up his famous face with a mask, the Greatest Showman star wore a black jumper, camel-coloured trousers and black-and-white sneakers</p>

<p>It comes as Hugh celebrates an Emmy win for his latest film, Bad Education. </p>

<p>The lauded television drama won a Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Television Movie on Saturday. </p>

<p>Hugh was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Limited Series Or Movie, but lost out to Mark Ruffalo for his performance in I Know This Much Is True. </p>

<p>Shaded: He shielded himself from the autumnal sun with a black baseball cap</p>

<p>Hmm! It's unclear why Hugh chose to carry the eye-catching cap and cane </p>

<p>Despite losing out, Hugh has received wide praise from fans and critics alike for his role as a corrupt school superintendent in Bad Education, with many calling it the actor's best performance yet. </p>

<p>In an interview with Variety, Hugh described the opportunity to portray real-life school superintendent Frank Tassone as 'fascinating'.       </p>

<p>'The role itself was something different from what I've done. I liked the idea of someone who is super successful, very, very good at what he did, beloved by the community - and fell down this slippery path,' he said.</p>

<p>And he described playing the villain as 'delicious' during an interview with Collider. </p>

<p>'As an actor, it just had so much to play with, and so many things that I've never really had the opportunity to play with. He's seemingly very charming, but also just a viper... Those things, I just found really exciting to play,' he said.   </p>

<p>Bulking up? Hugh also carried a plastic protein shaker bottle in his other hand </p>
