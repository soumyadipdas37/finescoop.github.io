<p>It's over: This comes one month after Miley Cyrus (pictured) confirmed her split from Cody after less than a year of dating</p>

<p>She continued: 'It was confirmed by a "reliable source" even though no one is reliable in a relationship except the individuals who are participating in it.'</p>

<p>'We are just deciding who we wanna be in our lives, what we wanna do, and so, don't make it some drama story if next week we're hanging out, getting pizza,' she added.</p>

<p>The American singer went on to say she remains friends with Cody, who she's known for a decade.</p>

<p>'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not,' she explained.</p>

<p>The couple began dating in September 2019, shortly after Miley had ended her fling with U.S. reality star Kaitlynn Carter.</p>
