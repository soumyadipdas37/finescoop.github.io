<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pep Guardiola has blamed his Manchester City side's shock 5-2 capitulation at the hands of Leicester City on the visitors' lack of desire to attack in the early stages of the game.</p>

<p>Man City had led through an early stunning strike from Riyad Mahrez before struggling to double their lead at the Etihad Stadium as they pressed ahead in trying to double their lead.</p>

<p>But Jamie Vardy equalised from the penalty spot before half-time, before the Foxes ran riot in the second half to net a further two spot-kicks, with the former England international grabbing a hat-trick.</p>

<p>Man City players stand dejected after being hammered by Leicester City at the Etihad Stadium</p>

<p>Guardiola praised his side for the first 30 minutes but believes a lack of creativity against an unadventurous Leicester defence proved his side's undoing. </p>

<p>'We played really good first 30 minutes. We score early on. They didn’t change approach,' defend so deep it’s not easy, he told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'Today the problem was we put extra pressure on ourselves to score the second when they didn’t want to play. </p>

<p>The Foxes scored three penalty kicks including one by Youri Tielemans (front)</p>

<p>Raheem Sterling struggles to find space to attack as the home side toiled creatively on Sunday</p>

<p>'We weren’t creating chances and got nervous, and when you concede three penalties you cannot win. </p>

<p>'I don't know how many chances they created. I know they want to run, and we try to avoid it, but first goal for example it was not a counter attack, we were settled. We have to accept it and improve in that area. We wanted a winger instead of a full back. And have one more player in the box.'</p>

<p>Guardiola's side are looking to recapture the Premier League crown they lost to Liverpool last term but admitted his team's achilles heel has been trying to break down teams who sit back and defend in a stubborn manner.</p>

<p>Jamie Vardy netted a hat-trick for Leicester who outwitted the former English champions</p>

<p>'The last game against Wolves it was not a problem, now it’s a problem,' he added. 'We have problems to attack, it happens many times against this kind of defence. They didn’t come up to press, we have to try to score.</p>

<p>They have done it since day one, and we have to solve it. But now of course it was not the case.</p>

<p>'It’s hard, but it’s the second game, we have to try to see what you have to do to avoid it next time. This is my job, i feel bad for the guys, but still we have to analyse. </p>
