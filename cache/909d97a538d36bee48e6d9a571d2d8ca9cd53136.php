<p>When questioned by Phillip Schofield about second wave concerns, he said: 'Excuse me, I am sick and tired of watching CNN, Sky, BBC, the lot. </p>

<p>'All they do is cause panic. I’m not interested in any of this stuff. You can switch telly on anytime of the day and see more bad news, I’m not interested.</p>

<p>'You go down Whitehall, it’s like a ghost town. They only need half an excuse not to go to work, we’re paying for them by the way. </p>

<p>'They’ve been given an unprecedented situation and we’re learning as we go along. Those people who still like working from home are a bit complacent honestly. My businesses, we’ve all come back.'</p>

<p>Speaking about supporting Carina's bakery business, he said: 'What attracted me to Carina as the winner is that this business has potential. Food will always be good. </p>

<p>'I think Carina will concur that throughout this pandemic, the shop has been busy. It’s given us encouragement to open a second branch which was always on the cards. Greggs watch out, we’re going to have a lot of branches. </p>

<p>'We have to get back to some form of normality. We all know what to do, the right things to do. Put all that in place and if people act sensibly, we can get back to normality.'</p>
