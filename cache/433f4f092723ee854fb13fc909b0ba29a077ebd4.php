<p>And William was so impressed with the night out that he called up the organiser the next day and told him he'd got him into dance music.</p>

<p>Kate and William, both 38, visited the Pacha nightclub and were guests of DJ Erick Morillo, who died this week, and Francisco Ferrer, Pacha's artistic director.</p>

<p>The memory was posted by Ibiza party organiser Tony Truman, who said he was 'blown away' when Prince William rang to thank him.</p>

<p>Tony - former partner of EastEnders' star Charlie Brooks - revealed the memory on his Instagram account in a tribute to Erick Morillo, who died on Tuesday, just days after being arrested on suspicion of sexual battery. </p>

<p>Tony Truman took to Instagram and told how William was so impressed with the night out that he called him up the next day and told him he'd got him into dance music</p>

<p>He said Morillo had 'loved life so much' and would be 'properly missed by all.'</p>

<p>He then went on: 'A story just came to me about Eric that I will never forget many moons ago (12) or so years I think - HRH Prince William came to Ibiza &amp; I had the pleasure to help arrange his party plans while on the Island with Kate &amp; their entourage.</p>

<p>'I asked Eric &amp; <?php echo e('@'); ?>francisco-ferrerfr to look after him <?php echo e('@'); ?>pachaofficial for Eric's <?php echo e('@'); ?>subliminalrecords night.</p>

<p>'They obviously done a great job as the next day I get a call from HRH William (like u casually do) and Wills says thank you Tony I was not a fan of house music until last night &amp; your friend Eric was amazing, now I love it.</p>

<p>The memory was posted by Ibiza party organiser Tony Truman, who said he was 'blown away' when Prince William rang to thank him (pictured)</p>

<p>'I was blown away, not just by Wills casually calling me, but that Eric had got the Royal RnB loving posse into House Music.'</p>

<p>Tony's memory puts their visit in 2008, however the duke and duchess are known to have visited Ibiza in 2006, not long before their infamous split and while William was on a break from military training at Sandhurst.</p>

<p>According to royal experts, the 2006 trip was one of just a handful where William, then 24, felt able to really let his hair down.</p>

<p>Author and broadcaster Vicky Ward claimed last year that Kate thought he was a bit too at ease.</p>

<p>Writing for Vanity Fair, she said: 'Interestingly, of the tight-knit royal clique who hit the clubs with increasing regularity, perhaps the most aware of the bad impression they were creating was Middleton.</p>

<p>Kate and William visited the Pacha nightclub and were guests of DJ Erick Morillo, who died this week, and Francisco Ferrer, Pacha's artistic director</p>

<p>'On vacation in 2006, Prince William and Guy Pelly, an old friend in the group, often referred to as the 'court jester,' were careering around on mopeds in front of a rented house in Ibiza.</p>

<p>'According to a source, Middleton came out of the house and, matron-like, told them to stop.</p>

<p>'She said, 'Anyone could be watching! Go out the back and stop behaving like this!'</p>

<p>'Like chastened schoolboys, the two did what they were told. William may not have liked it, but Middleton's judgment was almost certainly right.'</p>

<p>The group - who had rented a villa on the island - were seen on a yacht during their stay, with Pippa and Kate in matching white bikinis.</p>

<p>A year later, the duke and duchess temporarily split, blaming the pressure of being in the public eye and too much time apart.</p>

<p>Sources also said Kate was left humiliated by William's constant partying.</p>

<p>But they got back together and three years later announced their engagement and were married in April 2011.</p>
