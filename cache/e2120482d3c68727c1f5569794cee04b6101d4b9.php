<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When owners say their second-hand vehicles are 'as good as new', the reality is usually far from it.</p>

<p>But this classic motorcycle being sold at auction in November definitely lives up to the claim, with it still being packed inside its original delivery crate. </p>

<p>The Norton Commando is already a highly-collectible vintage motorbike, but this 1977 example will likely be in huge demand having never been unpacked in it 43-year history.</p>

<p>Time-capsule motorbike: This 1977 Norton Commando 850 Interstate has not been unpacked from its wooden shipping crate in its 43-year life, making it hugely desirable to vintage motorcycle collectors</p>

<p>The unique opportunity to buy the 'time capsule' Norton - which will remain in the manufacturer's packing crate for the sale - will be offered at the H&amp;H Classics auction at the National Motorcycle Museum, directly opposite the NEC near Solihull in the West Midlands, on 14 November. </p>

<p>The bike is estimated to sell for £20,000 to £30,000 and remained in a shipping state since it was made, with the front wheel removed and the exhaust silencer also packed separately into the wooden box.</p>

<p>The 1977 850 Interstate - notable for having an electric start as well as a kickstart - is one of the final examples of the original Norton Commando, which features an 828cc air-cooled parallel-twin engine, a four-speed gearbox and a top speed in excess of 115mph. </p>

<p>The contained motorbike even has its original storage packing, including the cardboard box that sits over the top of the crate</p>

<p>You might be wondering why a motorcycle built in Britain - with production of Norton motorcycles at the time taking place in Wolverhampton and Small Heath, Birmingham - is being sold in a shipping container. </p>

<p>That's because it was sold to a customer in Belgium in 1977, with the dispatch documentation even included in the November sale. </p>

<p>The bike remained untouched and unpacked from the time it arrived with its first keeper to when they decided to part with it.</p>

<p>It was subsequently sold and transported to a buyer in Holland who shipped it to Spain before it was recently purchased by the vendor and returned to the country where it was made.</p>

<p>This is how the Norton Commando 850 Interstate would look if it was unpacked and assembled</p>

<p>Left: The 828cc parallel-twin engine has not been turned over.  Right: The front wheel is detached from the forks for easy storage in the wooden unit</p>

<p>That means it has had three owners in four different countries in its 43-year history.</p>

<p>However, not one of these collectors removed it from its crate, let alone rode it.</p>

<p>'They were simply happy to admire the bike and imagine its potential', according to the selling auction house.</p>

<p>Mark Bryan, head of motorcycles at H&amp;H Classics, said: 'Every now and again one of these remarkable things appear in the collecting world. </p>

<p>'This particular instance is quite amazing. How on earth has everybody over 43 years managed to restrain themselves and not un-crate this bike?' </p>

<p>Records show that the Norton was originally shipped to the first keeper in Belgium on 18 October 1977</p>

<p>The motorcycle has been consigned by Kevin Maddocks, who has been a long-time Norton fan and collector.</p>

<p>'Imagine how excited I was when I recently heard of a 1977 Norton Commando 850 Interstate that was still in its original packing case - 43 years old and still 'brand new'. I just had to buy it and I tracked down the owner in Spain,' he explained, </p>

<p>'The Spanish collector, who owned 98 bikes, had bought it 10 years earlier at an auction in Belgium, after the owner of a Belgian motorbike shop passed away. </p>

<p>'Apparently he had kept it in his store room, in its original packing case, for about 35 years and for some strange reason refused to sell it to anyone!' </p>

<p>The bike's auction sale includes three sets of keys, manufacturer’s advice sheets for the dealer, owners manual, service book, plus even a small spray can of Norton chain lube - possibly the last in existence</p>

<p>The Commando was produced by Norton Motorcycle from 1967 until 1977 and has become a very collectible two-wheel machine in recent years. It was originally a 750 but the engine capacity was increased to 828cc in 1973</p>

<p>He added: 'Since owning her I have never really touched her - she would look even better if I could give it a spring clean but to do it properly, I'd have to remove her from the packing case. </p>

<p>'Everything is there; three sets of keys, manufacturer’s advice sheets for the dealer, owners manual, service book, plus even a small spray can of Norton chain lube!'</p>

<p>Mr Maddocks said his intention was to show the motorcycle at events across the country and display it in museums, but the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has seen his circumstances change and he's been resigned to selling the timewarp bike.  </p>

<p>Compared to some of the 'barn-find' classic cars we've seen sell for staggering sums in recent years, this untouched collectible will be a worthy addition to an motorcycle collection. </p>
