<p>Recently she revealed in a People interview that she is 'trying to do the holistic route as of now' rather than a laparoscopy.</p>

<p>'I want to try to see if I can figure some things out for myself, but we'll see. It's a journey. Every month is different because I try different things every month. But I'll definitely keep everybody posted on what works for me, and eventually having to get the surgery because it really depends. Everyone's different,' she said.</p>

<p>Olivia explained that her diagnosis 'was something that I was nervous to share because I really didn't know if people would be familiar with the condition, and it turns out a lot of women are.'</p>

<p>She shared: 'I was shocked to see how many women have also suffered from endometriosis, and how many questions women have about painful periods. They're not normal, and they could get in the way of your fertility.'</p>

<p>Olivia is currently dating NFL dreamboat Christian McCaffrey who recently flashed the flesh in a sizzling photo-shoot for GQ.</p>
