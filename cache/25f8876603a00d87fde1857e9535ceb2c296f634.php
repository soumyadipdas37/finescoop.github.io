<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Side with MUBTASIMAH (Doncaster, 3.15) to prove herself the jewel in the bet365 Sceptre Fillies Stakes.</p>

<p>A return to turf could be the catalyst to a better performance from the Dark Angel filly, who posted a rare below-par effort at Chelmsford when last seen. But there may have been excuses for that defeat.</p>

<p>The winner that day, Miss Celestial, made all of the running while the runner-up and third home were both well positioned towards the head of affairs, unlike Wednesday’s selection, who was switched off in rear before making late headway.</p>

<p>Sportsmail's racing expert Robin Goodfellow dishes out his tips Wednesday's meetings</p>

<p>That performance was in contrast to her impressive comeback display when landing a sizeable gamble at Newbury. After travelling powerfully, she put a competitive race to bed with an impressive change of pace to register a valuable first Listed success, with her Chelmsford conqueror, Miss Celestial, one of those beaten.</p>

<p>That trademark change of gear is a potent weapon at this afternoon’s level and a dry night and quickening ground would help Mubtasimah to once again showcase her talents.</p>

<p>FLYING DRAGON (Doncaster, nap, 2.40) is a far from prolific winner, but was perhaps a shade unfortunate not to improve that strike rate at Salisbury on his most recent start.</p>

<p>September appears to be the selection’s time of year with a win, three seconds and a couple of third-place finishes from six starts.</p>

<p>And he will hopefully give it a good go in trying to improve on a narrow defeat in this event 12 months ago.</p>

<p>Pat Dobbs takes over in the saddle from a young apprentice and his mount appears to have been slowly reaching a peak judged on recent efforts, a second at Salisbury — and at Beverley last month, when staying on well to grab fifth from a difficult position.</p>
