<p>The former Love Island star, 29, spoke to Ella Eyre on Badoo's content series The Truth Flirts where she recalled being 'slut-shamed' in school and discussed her account on X-rated subscription site OnlyFans. </p>

<p>Megan admitted: 'I've never ever faked an orgasm. I just think because I'm selfish and I think you're just gonna lead someone down the garden path.</p>

<p>Candid: Megan Barton Hanson has admitted she has 'never faked an orgasm' during a frank discussion about sex.</p>

<p>'They're gonna think you're into it when you're really not, and I just think I'm digging myself a hole here. </p>

<p>'Also, if someone lied to me, and pretended, not that boys can, but if a girl lied and pretended, and I found out that she didn't, I'd be devastated, so I'd rather just be honest. </p>

<p>'Although sometimes it's a little bit brutal, but I think it's the way you say it, if you say, "a little bit like this, or a little bit..", you don't have to be like, "oh my god that was terrible, what the hell was that", as long as you're nice about it – constructive criticism.'</p>

<p>Not one to mince her words, Megan added that she was 'quite old' before she 'discovered' orgasms. </p>

<p>Megan admitted: 'I've never ever faked an orgasm. I just think because I'm selfish and I think you're just gonna lead someone down the garden path'</p>

<p>She said: 'I was quite old, because I remember I lost my virginity and was like, "what the hell was that?" It wasn't until I went horse riding, and I was like, "I've never had that tingle before" so I think I just tried to recreate that, so I actually discovered it myself when I was older'. </p>

<p>Megan also opened up on being 'slut-shamed' when she was in school by an older boy who she was dating at the time.  </p>

<p>She said: 'I had a terrible experience at school, I was actually slut-shamed so badly at school, because I was with an older boy and he asked me to send him something, and luckily I didn't crumble, I didn't send him anything.</p>

<p>'But he was like, "I bet you haven't done it, you're just a little girl aren't you?" So, I was like, "yeah yeah yeah I've done it!"</p>

<p>'I'd never done anything, so my years at school, I was ridiculed for that. So, I think now, because I've had that, I own it, I'm like, "yeah women should be proud".</p>

<p>'Sometimes when it is a new relationship, I'm a little bit introverted. I wouldn't say it out of the blue but like I'd say, "maybe a little bit like this' or 'do something like this", I think it's the way you say it. I don't think I could look at someone and be like "right, get your notepad out, this this this".'</p>

<p>She added: 'Also, if someone lied to me, and pretended, not that boys can, but if a girl lied and pretended, and I found out that she didn't, I'd be devastated, so I'd rather just be honest'</p>

<p>Megan also discussed the surge in people making accounts on X-rated subscription site OnlyFans during lockown. </p>

<p>The site allows people to charge people a monthly fee to see their content, with the platform popular with adult film stars and social media influencers sharing X-rated pictures and videos.  </p>

<p>She said: 'Well I'm part of that! Before I went on Love Island, I was actually on it, and then I think it was a producer from the show who was like, "um it's not really great for the image, it's a family show, get off that," and I was like "ah, damnit".</p>

<p>'And then lockdown was happening, and obviously coming from that, and then doing webcam work in the past, I was like, "girls on webcam are gonna clean up, everyone's bored at home and men are gonna be on there." </p>

<p>'So I was like, "ding ding, I'm definitely gonna sign back up," and I was prepared, I had a lot of slut-shaming and stuff like that, and I think because now I'm in the public eye, people were like, "oh has your career gone that quickly," and I'm like "not really".'</p>

<p>Explaining what OnlyFans is, Megan added: 'It's basically like Instagram, so you can put up whatever you want, short clips, videos, and go to whatever level you want, and I think this is amazing as well. </p>

<p>Memories: Megan also opened up on being 'slut-shamed' when she was in school by an older boy who she was dating at the time </p>

<p>'For women in glamour modelling work, they were dictated to, what they should do to be successful in the magazines and the lads mags, whereas now it's your own platform. </p>

<p>'You can be as creative as you want, you can go to whatever level you want…and charge what you want, so it's really good'.</p>

<p>Megan also admitted that she watches porn but finds that a lot of it is 'for the male gaze' which she finds 'frustrating'. </p>

<p>She said: 'I watch it, not regularly. I think when I'm single and I'm talking to people but it's not like, at that level yet, because I don't like to talk too much about it with someone I'm seeing until I see them in person.</p>

<p>'So yeah I'll watch it occasionally, but I just think it's so hard to find something that's authentic, that's my problem. I think a lot of porn is for the male gaze and being bisexual myself, obviously I'd watch lesbian porn, but even that is so frustrating, it's always for the men, it's so fake, it's so set up.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I've worked in the sex industry, I've been a stripper, I've done webcam, so I definitely think there's a place for it (porn). </p>

<p>Racy: Megan also discussed the surge in people making accounts on X-rated subscription site OnlyFans during lockown </p>

<p>Interview: The former Love Island star spoke to Ella Eyre on Badoo's content series The Truth Flirts</p>

<p>'I think it really needs to be modernised and changed, like I said with the whole lesbian thing, it's very for the male gaze. I think a lot of porn, no matter what category, is for the male gaze.</p>

<p>'I think what's really good, you know how on Instagram they have the verified accounts, they've started doing that with couples, and for me, that's the kind of porn I'd want to watch, you know it's an actual couple, who are actually in love, and it's real.'</p>

<p>Megan also recalled a girl who slid into her DMs looking for a date who she decided not to reply to, saying: 'I did have one girl and she was sending me all emojis of furniture and she was like "don't mind me just moving into your DMs".</p>

<p>'And then I didn't reply, and then she sent them again and she said: "don't mind me just moving out as you ignored me."' </p>

<p>Megan said: 'I think because now I'm in the public eye, people were like "oh has your career gone that quickly", and I'm like 'not really' (pictured in 2018)</p>

<p>She added: 'You can be as creative as you want, you can go to whatever level you want…and charge what you want, so it's really good'</p>
