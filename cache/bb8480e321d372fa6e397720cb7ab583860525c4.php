<p>A savvy home cook has revealed how she made prawn toast in her $89 5.3 litre Kmart air fryer after a similar recipe was shared on MasterChef Australia earlier this year </p>

<p>Prawn or shrimp toast is a Chinese dish made from triangles of bread brushed with egg or oil and coated with minced prawn</p>

<p>To make the toast, she used bread slices, prawns, sesame oil, fresh ginger, sesame seeds, garlic and salt and pepper to season.</p>

<p>The recipe itself is simple to follow and only takes less than 15 minutes to complete from start to finish.</p>

<p>Lynette first cut the white bread slices into rectangles then chopped 14 medium sized prawns in a food processor until it formed a paste.</p>

<p>She then added in the sesame oil and remaining ingredients before spreading a thick layer onto each slice of bread.</p>

<p>The top was then dipped into sesame seeds before cooking in the air fryer at 180 degrees Celsius for at least nine minutes.</p>
