<p>Boris Johnson has announced a 'review' of plans to re-open stadiums for sport fans in October</p>

<p>'At the present time we must also I am afraid revise plans to pilot larger audiences in venues later this month and review our intention to return audiences to stadiums and conference centres from October 1,' Mr Johnson said.</p>

<p>'But that doesn't mean we are going to scrap the programme entirely, we are just going to have to review it and abridge it and the Culture Secretary will say more about that shortly.'</p>

<p>Fans had already benn fearing the worst when it was announced that from Monday onwards, it will be illegal for to assemble in groups of seven or more anywhere in England, whether indoors or out.</p>

<p>That was already set to have a huge knock-on effect for sporting events that were banking on getting fans back into stadiums by early October, but Johnson's latest statements have confirmed more bad news for hopeful supporters.</p>
