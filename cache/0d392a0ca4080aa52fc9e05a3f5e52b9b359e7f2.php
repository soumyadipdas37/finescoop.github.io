<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bachelor in Paradise star Kirralee 'Kiki' Morris' ex-boyfriend has pleaded guilty to pinning her to a couch by her throat and slapping her across the face.</p>

<p>Jeremy Peter Banks, 31, finally admitted to the shocking act of domestic violence after more than two years of bizarre legal wrangling.</p>

<p>The salesman appeared to dodge justice months after the May 5, 2018, attack as the charges were dropped when Morris, 32, didn't show up to court.</p>

<p>But it all came unstuck when police found text messages of Banks manipulating her into pulling out of the case, and slapped him with more charges.</p>

<p>Jeremy Banks (pictured left) pleaded guilty to choking and slapping his ex-girlfriend, Bachelor In Paradise star Kirralee 'Kiki' Morris on May 5, 2018</p>

<p>Morris (pictured) woke to her boyfriend standing over her yelling and brandishing a mobile phone, a police statement of facts seen by Daily Mail Australia details</p>

<p>The couple, who had been dating for 18 months, were drinking with friends at their flat in Manly, on Sydney's northern beaches, when Morris felt sick and went to bed.</p>

<p>At about 5am she woke to her boyfriend standing over her yelling and brandishing a mobile phone, a police statement of facts seen by Daily Mail Australia details.</p>

<p>Morris was still groggy from the cold and flu tablets she took before bed, but told police she remembered Banks grabbing her.</p>

<p>He then pulled or dragged her across the room and slammed her on to a couch where he held her by the throat, pinned her with his leg, and screamed in her face.</p>

<p>The former glamour model could barely breathe, let alone scream, so she tried to bang on the floor with her foot to raise the alarm - but it was no use.</p>

<p>'Shut the f**k up... answer the question,' Banks yelled, and slapped her across the face as he kept her pinned down.</p>

<p>Morris, who first rose to fame on The Bachelor in 2016, told police she may have hit Banks in self defence as she flailed her arms, but wasn't sure.</p>

<p>Eventually she was able to break free and ran outside yelling 'help me, call the police, call the police' into the arms of a neighbour, who rushed her inside.</p>

<p> Morris shot to fame on The Bachelor in 2016, before starring on Bachelor in Paradise this year</p>

<p>Morris suffered a bloodied lip, bruising around her eye, a grazed left cheek, and redness to her elbows. </p>

<p>Still visibly distressed, Morris bravely told police what happened in a videotaped interview.</p>

<p>Banks was arrested at the flat and initially started talking to detectives until he was shown Morris' interview, and immediately lawyered up. </p>

<p>He was charged with assault causing bodily harm and common assault, and given bail for the case to continue on July 24, 2018.</p>

<p>However, the charges were thrown out by Magistrate Christopher Longley because Morris failed to appear in court.</p>

<p>Banks' lawyers successfully argued it would be unfair to admit the video interview because Morris could not be cross-examined in court.</p>

<p>However, on April 8, 2019, the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions appealed to the Supreme Court and got the evidence reinstated and a new trial ordered.</p>

<p>A law was passed in 2014 that allowed video interviews to be admitted in domestic violence cases so victims wouldn't have to face their alleged attackers in court. </p>

<p>Banks appeared to dodged justice months after the May 5, 2018, attack as the charges were dropped when Morris, 32, didn't show up to court - but it caught up with him later</p>

<p>Banks pulled or dragged her across the room and slammed on to a couch where he held her by the throat, pinned her with his leg, and screamed in her face</p>

<p>Justice Mark Ierace agreed the magistrate was mistaken in throwing out the evidence due to this law.</p>

<p>A month later, Banks was also charged with preventing a potential witness from attending court proceedings.</p>

<p>Detectives then received a trove of texts and Google Hangouts messages between the former couple of Banks begging Morris to drop the case.</p>

<p>The relentless effort began immediately after Banks was released from custody and continued until two weeks before the trial.</p>

<p>'I'm in f<strong>king jail... You sent me to f</strong>king jail – I have to go to court – you testified against me… how the f**k could you do this to me?' he wrote.</p>

<p>Despite there being a restraining order against Banks contacting Morris, the two texted each other daily.</p>

<p>Despite there being a restraining order against Banks contacting Morris (pictured), the two texted each other daily</p>

<p>Banks texted the reality star begging her to drop the case</p>

<p>'I'm trying to ensure I can get the best outcome I can with your help it can probably be the best possible outcome,' Banks wrote on May 7.</p>

<p>'I have two prior assault charges so prison is an option and I'm sure you can see it in your heart to look at the bigger picture here.'</p>

<p>In a subsequent text that day, Banks first brings up the suggestion that she not turn up to court so he can get off the charges. </p>

<p>'I will speak to my lawyer today and see what is my best course of action and let you know… if you could see it in your heart to help me with a reference or not turning up to court I would be forever grateful,' he wrote.</p>

<p>Banks ramped up the guilt tripping on May 10, begging for 'a little cooperation' that would have 'no repercussions' for her.</p>

<p>'If you ever loved me or you have any care or love for me whatsoever you would at least try to cooperate in the least amount to ensure I don't have to ruin the rest of my life,' he wrote.</p>

<p>In an extraordinary series of Google Hangouts messages on May 15, Banks made a grovelling apology for the assault in the hope Morris would help him</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, for dragging you out of bed Kiki… and I'm sorry I saw what I saw in your phone and sorry for everything OK,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'I've apologised 1000 times for that... I dragged you out of bed because of what I saw, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you and you know it. But I'm sorry, OK.'</p>

<p>Switching back to text again on June 1, Banks asked Morris if the police had contacted her and asked her to attend court.</p>

<p>'I also want your help with this situation because again – from the bottom of your heart, everything aside, kiki – do you want me to go to jail?' he added on June 5.</p>

<p>'It's as black and white as that.' </p>

<p>By June 10, the police were hounding Morris to serve her with a subpoena to testify in the case the following month.</p>

<p>'I just want to cry. This is horrible. My sister yelled at me. Mum is abusing me,' she wrote to Banks.</p>

<p>Banks told Morris he feared he would be sentenced to jail over the incident </p>

<p>Banks appeared to suggest his relationship with the reality star would survive the court case </p>

<p>He replied: 'Yelling at you for what abusing you for what?' to which Morris wrote: 'For having the police chasing me for protecting you.'</p>

<p>Banks launched into an angry tirade claiming the police would chase her anyway and her family should be supporting him. </p>

<p>'So what they would prefer to see me go to jail and have a f**ked record?' he wrote, before implying their relationship would survive the case.</p>

<p>'Imagine if when we have kids and that’s on my record what they would think, it will be over in a couple of weeks – think of our future, the police certainly don’t give a f**k about us or our future.'</p>

<p>Banks on July 2 offered to get Morris a new phone number so she could dodge the police easier, but she said she needed her current one for job applications.</p>

<p>The last text in the police facts showed Banks passing on a letter or similar from his lawyer telling police to cease contact. </p>

<p>'Can you pass that on… to your family. All they have to do is they don’t want to be contacted again about this matter. And it will stop,' he wrote.</p>

<p>Police wrote in the statement of facts that the texts were a clear attempt to scuttle the assault case.</p>

<p>'[They] were a deliberate attempt to manipulate the victim into avoiding police and persuading her not to attend court to give evidence,' police wrote.</p>

<p>'He specifically requested her co-operation and referenced their relationship continuing after the court matter resolved in his favour. </p>

<p>'He spoke of making up for past mistakes in their relationship after the court matter was ‘over and done with’ and offered to propose to her to prove his commitment. </p>

<p>'This message in particular was sent in the context of the accused asking for ‘help with this situation’ asking the victim she wanted the accused to go to jail.'</p>

<p>Faced with overwhelming evidence, Banks pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily harm in Sydney Downing Centre Local Court last Thursday. </p>

<p>He also pleaded to preventing a potential witness from attending court proceedings, while the common assault charge was dropped.</p>

<p>Banks will next face court on October 22 to begin sentencing. </p>

<p>He was also charged on May 8, 2019, with breaking the original restraining order,  for which was convicted in August 2019 but appealed to the District Court.</p>

<p>Kiki Morris appeared on Richie Strahan's season of the Bachelor in 2016 - and started dating Jeremy Banks shortly after filming wrapped</p>

<p>A new restraining order prevents Banks from contacting Morris except through her lawyer, or from going within 200m of her home or workplace.  </p>

<p>Standard bans on him assaulting, threatening, stalking, harassing, or intimidating her also apply.</p>

<p>Morris was a contestant on the 2016 season of The Bachelor, unsuccessfully competing for Richie Strahan's heart.</p>

<p>She earlier modelled for Playboy, Zoo Weekly, and Ralph, and was a Miss Bondi runner-up in 2011.</p>

<p>Morris had a second chance at love on Bachelor in Paradise earlier this year, where she shacked up with Ciarran Stott - but the relationship ended soon after the show.</p>
