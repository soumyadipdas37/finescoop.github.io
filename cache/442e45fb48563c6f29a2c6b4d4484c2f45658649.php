<p>It's synonymous with luxury, glamour and VIP treatment - and now a glimpse of The Savoy (pictured) is on offer without the grand expense thanks to a new fly-on-the-wall documentary, starting tonight</p>

<p>The four-part ITV production, airing at 9pm, takes viewers behind the scenes of one of London's top hotels - showcasing the high life experienced by guests, with at least two staff members per room attending to most of their desires. Pictured, The Savoy's butlers</p>

<p>Keeping the seven-storey hotel running is head butler Sean Davoren, 62, who started at The Savoy in 1978, and strives for 'excellence' each morning.</p>

<p>In the TV series, which sees David Hasselhoff and Denise van Outen stay at the hotel, Sean showcases The Royal Suite - which is spread across the entire fifth floor with a view of the London Eye and includes Princess Diana as one of its former guests.</p>

<p>The head butler is also seen putting newest butler and former actor Michael Peluso, 37, whose mother was the late Loose Women star Lynda Bellingham, through his paces.</p>

<p>'I’m a little bit of a tyrant,' Sean says. 'When I was being trained they would hit you, throw things at you and say, "You’d better do better or you won’t be working here." It was a good lesson but wouldn’t be appropriate now.'</p>

<p>Also featuring in the documentary are motor industry boss Damien Cuming and his wife Jacqueline, from Cambridgeshire, who have been going to The Savoy for 26 years.</p>

<p>Likewise, accountancy firm owner Simon De-Lacy Adams (pictured), from East Anglia, has stayed at The Savoy 70 times in the last year and is a well-known face around the hotel and the Savoy Grill</p>

<p>The couple spent 20 nights at the hotel last year in a £1,500 room, with Jacqueline admitting: 'We could have bought several houses'.</p>

<p>Damien even popped the question to his wife at their 'second home' 18-years ago and their go-to treat there is beluga caviar, which costs an eye-watering £160 for 30g.  </p>

<p>Likewise, accountancy firm owner Simon De-Lacy Adams, from East Anglia, has stayed at The Savoy 70 times in the last year and is a well-known face around the hotel and the Savoy Grill. </p>

<p>He has used the hotel as his London-base for many years and even has his own personalised linen that the staff use for his suites - while the returning guest was also presented with his own monogrammed pillows and bathrobes for Christmas. </p>

<p>The Royal Suite (pictured is its bathroom) is spread across the entire fifth floor with a view of the London Eye and which includes Princess Diana as one of its former guests</p>

<p>'My husband is not as good as a butler — the bell doesn’t work and I’m told to naff off if I ask for anything like that,' Simon jokes in the episode.</p>

<p>Four restaurants are housed in The Savoy - The Thames Foyer, Simpson’s, seafood specialist Kaspar’s and the Michelin-starred Savoy Grill, which is run by Maitre D’ Thierry Tomasin.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, 51, with 30 years experience in the industry, was handpicked by owner and celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay 18 months before the documentary began.</p>

<p>Speaking to his staff ahead of service, Thierry says: 'We are not waiters, we are salesmen of pleasure. We do the je-ne-sais-quoi but I want the ooh-la-la.'</p>

<p>He adds to the camera: 'Guests pay our wages at the end of the month so we should never ever forget that. This is a show. Instead of going to the theatre you come to Savoy Grill. It's the experience.' </p>

<p>Viewers also see Savoy Grill owner Gordon Ramsay (pictured left) serve up a foul-mouthed rant at his maître d'hôtel and declare standards ‘aren’t good enough’ after finding a cracked plate and being served duck with a blunt knife</p>

<p>The staff were seen preparing for Gordon's arrival during the show, with the chef trying out two new dishes and ensuring his front-of-house was up to scratch.</p>

<p>However, Gordon left disappointed after finding a cracked plate, being served duck with a blunt knife and finding little haddock in the £12 fish omelet. </p>

<p>Finding the chipped plate, he rants: 'Put it in the f****** bin. It’s The Savoy, guys, not the f****** Golden Egg down the Old Kent Road.'</p>

<p>Waiters are expected to flambé, carve and fillet dishes in front of diners, but Gordon is less than impressed with Thierry's carving skills. </p>

<p>The dining manager explains that his freshly sharpened knife has been switched for a blunt one as he tries to carve the meat, with Gordon saying: 'You've turned a beautiful duck into roadkill.' </p>

<p>'Today wasn't good,' admits Gordon. 'Nowhere near my standards. The Savoy Grill for me is about prestige. My name's on the door so I want it right and today was just not good enough.'</p>

<p>The Savoy airs at 9pm on ITV </p>
