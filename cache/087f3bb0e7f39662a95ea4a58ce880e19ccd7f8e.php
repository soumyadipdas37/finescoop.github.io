<p>'I fell in love with you the first day I saw you, and I saw those big brown eyes,' he said in an emotion-filled speech.</p>

<p>'Like, they just make me go crazy. And, like, when I told you I love you, like, I meant every single word. </p>

<p>'I know you  don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty.' </p>

<p>Tears: Locky burst into tears and gasped for air as he delivered the bad news to Bella, saying he needed 'more certainty' in a relationship</p>

<p>'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me,' she said in shock. </p>

<p> Furiously, she responded: 'You can't turn this around on me.'</p>

<p>She then stormed off, stating: 'My God... Can I leave. I'm going.' </p>

<p>Heartbroken: Bella then ran away in tears, still shaken over what had just happened</p>
