<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She revealed she was 'devastated' days earlier after having to cancel work on her upcoming cookbook due to her high-risk pregnancy.</p>

<p>And Chrissy Teigen's bed rest at home was interrupted on Sunday after she made a surprise visit to the hospital.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old model originally said she was 'so bored' while stuck at home, before taking up a room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Change of plans: Chrissy Teigen, 34, joked Sunday afternoon that she was 'so bored' while on bed rest at home, but she surprised her 31.3 million Instagram followers when her next post was from a hospital bed</p>

<p>Chrissy originally filmed herself for her Instagram Stories in closeup from her bed, with nothing on but a white towel.</p>

<p>'I'm having a bored time — a bed time boredom photoshoot today. Just in bed,' she said sleepily.</p>

<p>'Full glam. Just so bored,' she joked, while showing off her makeup-free face and clear skin.</p>

<p>But her day in bed seems to have been interrupted, as later she shared a photo to her Insta Stories of what appeared to be a hospital room.</p>

<p>'So bored': 'I'm having a bored time — a bed time boredom photoshoot today. Just in bed,' she said sleepily in her original post from home</p>

<p>Looking good: 'Full glam. Just so bored,' she joked, while showing off her makeup-free face and clear skin</p>

<p>'Scratch that': Chrissy wasn't bored anymore after she ended up in the maternity ward at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA, though she didn't say why she went there</p>

<p>The snap was taken from the hospital bed around 5:45, and a white board on the wall revealed she was in the Maternity Fetal Care Unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</p>

<p>A medical professional was administering to her and wearing a blue down jacket with colorful stripes on the sleeves.</p>

<p>'Scratch that,' Chrissy wrote, presumably referring to her statement about being bored.</p>

<p>Her visit to the maternity ward followed her announcement on Twitter on Thursday that she was ceasing all of her work temporarily after being diagnosed with a high-risk pregnancy.</p>

<p>'Today I had to postpone the cookbook indefinitely and sent <?php echo e('@'); ?>AdeenaSussman alllll the way back to Tel Aviv and same with shutting down filming Chrissy's Court. Baby cannot do it. I am devastated,' she tweeted. </p>

<p>Taking it easy: Her visit to the maternity ward followed her announcement on Twitter on Thursday that she was ceasing all of her work temporarily after being diagnosed with a high-risk pregnancy</p>

<p>Whoops! Chrissy took the hospital room photo down after people began calling en masse because she posted the room's phone number</p>

<p>Despite sharing that she was in the hospital, Chrissy didn't mention what brought her there or if it was related to her earlier video at all.</p>

<p>However, the Chrissy's Court star took down the original hospital room photo.</p>

<p>'Lol I accidentally posted the phone number to my hospital room on Instagram so I have to move, I appreciate the phone calls though you little sweetie pies,' she tweeted. </p>

<p>Chrissy also seemed to spend plenty of time in bed on Saturday, when she documented her struggle to find a good Philly Cheesesteak in Los Angeles while using a dog face filter.</p>

<p>Though the one she eventually got delivered didn't look that appetizing, she was happy to report that it still tasted good. </p>

<p>On a quest: On Saturday, she used a dog face filter while searching for a good Philly cheesesteak in LA</p>

<p>Staying healthy: On Friday, Chrissy posted a video to her Insta Stories, giving a glimpse of a compression device wrapped around her leg that prevents blood clots</p>

<p>Yikes: She shared a hilarious screenshot from the same day after she shared a photo of what she thought was a blood clot that she passed to the wrong group chat</p>

<p>Chrissy revealed on Friday she's been spending considerable time in bed in recent weeks.</p>

<p>She posted a photo to her Insta Stories of the compression pads she has had to wear on her legs to help stop blood clots from forming, as extended bed rest can cause them.</p>

<p>In a hilarious admission, she revealed that she shared a photo of what she assumed was a blood clot that she had passed to one of her group chats — except that it was the wrong group chat.</p>

<p>A screenshot from the conversation shows her husband John Legend, 41, simply responding, 'welp,' before informing her that it was the wrong chat.</p>

<p>Chrissy previously said that her pregnancies with Luna, four, and Miles, two, were complicated after her placenta failed to nourish them properly, requiring her to be induced early both times.</p>
