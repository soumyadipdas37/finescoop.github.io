<p>Statement: Vogue recently hit back at trolls after she was body-shamed for her post-baby weight loss, six weeks after giving birth to her daughter Gigi</p>

<p>The Irish beauty wrote: 'There is no secret! I got a lot of comments and mails about the video I posted the other day. Mainly positive but my god there were some awful ones!</p>

<p>'I hate the term "snapping back" it’s not something I aspire to do after having a child nor do I think it’s important. My body is different to other people’s, I didn’t do anything specific.</p>

<p>'I’ve only recently started training again, 4 times a week for 45 minutes a session. I try to eat healthily but I have not cut calories and eat a lot more than usual as I’m breastfeeding and it’s important to keep calories up so you have a good milk supply.</p>

<p>Family first: The Heart Radio host shares Theodore, two, and one-month-old Gigi with Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, 32</p>

<p>'I trained the whole way throughout my pregnancy and I think that is a factor in the way I look now. I’m also VERY tall so there’s a lot more room for a baby.' </p>

<p>Revealing that she's been a fitness devotee for almost half her life, she continued: 'I’ve trained since I was 16, for me it’s a great thing not only for my body but for my mind too.</p>

<p>'At the moment I feel permanently exhausted but training gives me energy and keeps my hormones under more control (they are still all over the place a little as with any new mother).'</p>
