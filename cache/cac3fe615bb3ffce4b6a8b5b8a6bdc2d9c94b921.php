<p>She and Russell share a three-year-old daughter called Sienna and also raise Future, Ciara's six-year-old son by the rapper of the same name.</p>

<p>Ciara gave birth to Win on July 23 this year and announced the good news with an Instagram video the following day.</p>

<p>Wearing a sparkly black mask and holding her baby to her chest, Ciara lay in her hospital bed and sang Happy Birthday To You. </p>

<p>Motivated: She hopped on the treadmill last Tuesday for 'Day 1' of her fitness regimen after announcing her plan to lose 48lbs following the birth of her third baby</p>

<p>Mother of three: Ciara posted a video of the workout to Insta Stories and made sure to tag her and Russell's dashing personal trainer Decker Davis</p>

<p>'Happy Birthday WIN!!! Mommy &amp; Daddy Love You!' she gushed in the caption. 'Win Harrison Wilson 7.23.2020 8lbs 1 oz.'</p>

<p>Russell posted the same caption over a heart-melting family picture in which he leaned into frame beside Ciara's hospital bed while she cradled their newborn.</p>

<p>The NFL star also uploaded a picture of himself beaming as he lay shirtless on a sofa in Ciara's hospital ward to do skin-to-skin with the baby. </p>

<p>Tireless: Ciara is seen in a recent behind-the-scenes Instagram video, dancing up a storm for her Rooted music video just two days before she gave birth to Win</p>

<p>New release: The music video dropped August 12 and featured glimpses of Ciara wearing this outfit and dancing in this setting</p>

<p>Days before welcoming Win he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and told guest-host Joel McHale he was unsure if he would be able to attend the birth of his son.</p>

<p>The NFL training camps were opening near the end of July, and if Ciara had given birth after that point, coronavirus concerns may have kept Russell from the hospital.</p>

<p>'I think she needs me in the hospital! You know, she last time, she grabbed my hand, she almost broke my hand,' he remembered.</p>

<p>Mother of three: She also has a daughter called Sienna, three, by Russell and a son called Future, six,  by the rapper of the same name; she and her children are pictured in Rooted</p>

<p>And she was squeezing my right hand, I said: "Baby, baby, baby, other hand." So she grabbed my left, so you know, hopefully she'll know this this time,' he quipped. </p>

<p>Ciara announced her latest pregnancy with a breathtaking Instagram snap taken on a beach during a trip to Turks And Caicos. </p>

<p>The couple are devout Christians who abstained from having sex during their romance until they married in 2016 at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England.</p>
