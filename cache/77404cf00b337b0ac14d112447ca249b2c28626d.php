<p>An Australian personal trainer has revealed how she gave up on the unhealthy idea of being 'skinny' and build the body of her dreams </p>

<p>Sophie Allen, 30, started her fitness journey in 2017, initially wanting to lose weight, and has since gone on to compete in some of the country's toughest bikini competitions</p>

<p>'All I wanted was to be skinny, to shrink parts of myself that I didn't love. Skinny was "in" when I started my fitness journey... then I decided to blow up the ideas I had around beauty and focus on getting STRONG,' she wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>'Focusing on strength, the basic principles of progressive overload, and HEALTH as a combined approach is how I've achieved my physique today. </p>

<p>'Neither is better, nor am I posting this for people to vote... I just want to share that my goals went from "get me skinny no matter the cost" to "get me healthy no matter the cost".</p>

<p>Sophie's idea of health is nourishing her body, lifting weights and moving daily in an enjoyable way, so she's paving a lifestyle that supports these things. </p>

<p>'There's nothing special about me, I started at the beginning too. If you don't think you'll ever achieve your dreams - let this be your reminder. Follow the process, don't give up and  don't forget you're capable of more'. </p>

<p>One of the most dramatic physical changes Sophie has seen is the size and toning of her glute muscles, which are remarkably different in both photos.</p>

<p>Her favourite lower body workout includes front squats, Russian dead lifts, leg press single leg, seated leg curl and cable pull throughs.</p>

<p>Although it's only a few movements they target every part of your glutes so you're creating a well rounded derrière after each session.</p>

<p>Breakfast: Oats, coconut yoghurt, berries and peanut butter</p>

<p>Lunch: Chicken, pumpkin and vegetables</p>

<p>Dinner: Coconut green chicken curry with prawns, fish and rice</p>

<p>Dessert: Protein oats with berries, Loving Earth chocolate and peanut butter  </p>

<p>On top of that she eats 1,700 calories a day to maintain her energy, starting with a breakfast bowl of berries and coconut yoghurt and a side vegetable salad (pictured at the start of her journey left)</p>

<p>Lunch might be a chicken and kale, green bean and snow pea salad, a protein shake as an afternoon snack and a stir fry for dinner.</p>

<p>In a recent YouTube video Sophie explained that she was trialling a candida diet to help with her gut health and so far was enjoying it, although it did restrict what kind of carbohydrates she could eat. </p>

<p>The candida diet is a strict eating style that eliminates sugar, gluten, dairy and alcohol, because there are claims these foods and drinks promote candida overgrowth in your system. </p>

<p>'I'm not craving sugar or anything yet. High fat is usually pretty good at satiating you and I know it's only a month before I can bring in some more carbs,' she said.  </p>
