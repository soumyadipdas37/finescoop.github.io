<p>New look drive show: Nova FM's new drive show Kate, Tim and Joel will launch next week... just days after several radio announcers from the radio network were made redundant this week</p>

<p>'Can't wait to start Kate, Tim and Joel on Monday. Is there any research I should do? A book I should read? Is there an online masterclass I can sign up to? Just kidding,' he joked.</p>

<p>'That sounds exhausting... I'm sure someone's going to tell me... right?'  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, former Home and Away star Kate excitedly said: 'We're all keen to get into the studio on Monday… Get Joel out of the house regularly, kick off the show and start making KTJ radio instead of just talking about it!</p>

<p>The rebranding of the Nova FM drive show comes after the network brutally axed jobs in the latest round of job cuts to affect the radio industry during the COVID-19 recession.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Radio Today confirmed that the network had decided to cut local workdays in Brisbane and Adelaide.</p>

<p>This change will see Nova 106.9 hosts Katie Mattin and Jack Tree, and Nova 919 announcers Rosie Panetta and Jarrod Walsh depart the business or 'possibly be redeployed'. </p>

<p>After the news was broken, Jarrod shared a tearful video on social media in which he reacted to his redundancy and reflected on his 16-year career at the network.</p>

<p>'I was one of a handful of good people who was made redundant from the radio station,' he said. </p>

<p>'I was preparing myself mentally… but nothing can prepare you to hear those words.'</p>

<p>Jarrod broke down in tears as he reminisced about his time at Nova, and admitted he was feeling a mixture of 'fear, relief and anxiety' since hearing the news. </p>

<p>He added: 'My hands have been randomly shaking for the past couple of days.</p>

<p>'I haven't really been given the opportunity to say farewell and thank you on the air so I'm going to do that here and I'm going to try and hold it together.'</p>

<p>Nova's programming and marketing boss, Paul Jackson, told Radio Today the network had been forced to 'review' its business as a result of the pandemic.</p>

<p>'It's been a tough time for all media industries during COVID and as a result we've reviewed every aspect of our business, including programming, to ensure we continue to deliver our listeners with the best content, announcers and shows, in the most efficient way,' he said.</p>

<p>'As a result of this review we've looked carefully at all our Nova workday announcers and unfortunately this has resulted in some talented broadcasters being made redundant.'</p>
