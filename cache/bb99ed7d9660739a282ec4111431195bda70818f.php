<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump mocked MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi and other members of the media during his rally Tuesday, claiming 'it was a beautiful sight' to see police target reporters.</p>

<p>Although he did not mention Velshi by name, the comments appeared to be a continuation of his attacks during another rally over the weekend where he falsely said Velshi was 'hit in the knee with a canister of tear gas.'</p>

<p>'Remember that beautiful sight? The street was a mess,' Trump said during his rally Tuesday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>'That idiot reporter from CNN got hit with a canister of tear gas,' Trump said, as the rally crowd laughed, falsely identifying Velshi's employer as CNN. 'And he went down. 'I've been hit. I've been hit.' He's been hit.'</p>

<p>Donald Trump said Tuesday at his Pennsylvania rally that 'it was a beautiful sight' to see police target reporters as they covered protests and riots</p>

<p>He specifically called out MSNBC reporter Ali Velshi who was struck by a rubber bullet as he covered unrest following the death of George Floyd</p>

<p>CNN is one of the outlets Trump most often criticizes and uses during his attacks on media at rallies – and appears to be the one that gets the most reaction out of his loyalist crowds.</p>

<p>Velshi was actually struck by a rubber bullet in June while he was covering unrest following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.</p>

<p>During Tuesday's rally in Moon Township, Trump also lambasted another unnamed reporter.</p>

<p>'Sometimes they grab. They grab one guy. 'I'm a reporter. I'm a reporter.' Get out of here. They threw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn,' Trump said of the unidentified reporters who was targeted by police while covering nationwide Black Lives Matter protests and riots.</p>

<p>'Honestly, when you watch the crap that we have all had to take so long. When you see it, it is actually a beautiful sight,' The president said.</p>

<p>Some of Velshi's fellow MSNBC hosts defended him, including 'Morning Joe' hosts Willie Geist, Joe Scarborough and his wife and co-host Mika Brzezinksi.</p>

<p>'Remember that beautiful sight? The street was a mess. That idiot reporter from CNN got hit with a canister of tear gas,' Trump said as the crowd laughed and cheered</p>

<p>The comments were similar to those made about Velshi during a Saturday Minnesota rally, which fellow MSNBC host Joe Scarborough defended</p>

<p>Velshi thanked his colleagues for defending him and the First Amendment</p>

<p>'Thanks <?php echo e('@'); ?>morningmika, <?php echo e('@'); ?>JoeNBC &amp; <?php echo e('@'); ?>WillieGeist for your words in support of me but, more importantly, for the 1st Amendment,' Velshi tweeted Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Trump's comments Tuesday were similar to those made at his rally in Bemidji, Minnesota on Saturday.</p>

<p>'I remember this guy Velshi, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas. And he went down,' Trump said as the crowd cheered and laughed. 'He was down. 'My knee, my knee.' Nobody cared. These guys didn't care. They moved him aside, and they just walked right through.'</p>

<p>MSNBC issued a response: 'Freedom of the press is a pillar of our democracy. When the president mocks a journalist for the injury he sustained while putting himself in harm's way to inform the public, he endangers thousands of other journalists and undermines our freedoms.' </p>
