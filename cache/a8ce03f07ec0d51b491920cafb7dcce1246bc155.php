<p>A 'laminated list' is detailed on Urban Dictionary as: 'A list of the top 5 people, usually celebrities, with whom you could have sex with without repercussions, if the opportunity arose, regardless of whether you were in a relationship or not.'</p>

<p>Chatting on their Spencer &amp; Vogue podcast, Spencer, 32, poked fun at Vogue for her love of the grime genre of music before she made her big reveal. </p>

<p>Vogue explained the stark difference in the couple's music taste, as she said: 'So Spenny and I have very, very different taste in music and I went into the bedroom the other day and he is blasting James Blunt...</p>

<p>'Squealing along in the shower [laughs], so that’s what I’ve heard from the bedroom. You know what though, you give me so much s*** when I’m listening to my own music, and I just leave you', before Spencer then branded her music 'c**p'. </p>

<p>As the former MIC star teased her saying: 'Honestly if you met these grime artists, they would literally be like “oh god, another one who thinks they’re cool', </p>

<p>Disgruntled Vogue responded: 'That’s unfair because you’re saying Skepta, who’s on my Laminated List, would not fancy me, and that’s a bit mean.'</p>

<p>After many months of romance over a relationship between Skepta and Adele, Vogue then admitted she's upset over their rumoured romance.  </p>

<p>Vogue asked her doting husband: 'Do you reckon Skepta would want to, I’m not going to say go out with me, that’s a bit far, do you reckon he would deffo kiss me?' </p>

<p>He then responded: 'I set myself high goals, so that others are jealous', to which a tickled Vogue went on: 'That’s good, I was kind of annoyed with Adele for a while because she was going out with his'. </p>

<p>Uh oh! After many months of romance over a relationship between Skepta and Adele, Vogue then admitted she's upset over their rumoured romance</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the podcast, the couple sparred over who is more recognisable - leading to Spencer claiming prisoners liked him.</p>

<p>He said: 'Prisoners love me. I get approached quite often by people who’ve served time and apparently Made In Chelsea is a mega hit in jail and because I was a bit of asshole on Made In Chelsea, I’m their favourite, so there.' </p>

<p>Vogue hilariously hit back: 'I don’t want to be known for something like Made In Chelsea anyway, I’m like trying to get away from you'. </p>
