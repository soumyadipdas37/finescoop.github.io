<p>Catching the eye: The former Coronation Street actress, 32, turned heads in a shoulderless salmon pink dress, with a tulle fringe at the bust</p>

<p>Stylish: The figure-hugging number showed off her frame as she cosied up to Joe, who looked smart in a black and white floral shirt, a black trench, skinny black jeans and matching boots</p>

<p>Posting a snap to Instagram, he added the caption: 'I had the best birthday. These beautiful souls are my world.'</p>

<p>He didn't tag Chloe in the post but she was present with his nearest and dearest.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'They have both been leaving loved up comments on each other's Instagram pictures from around April. They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since.'</p>

<p>Indeed, comments have materialised online under social media snaps, with Gareth writing 'Mmmmm' under one of Chloe's sultry snaps.</p>

<p>Faye confirmed her new romance with personal trainer Joe Davies in late November as they made their red carpet debut at the White Christmas musical press night. </p>

<p>During the night, the actress leaned into Joe as he placed a hand on the small of her back, indicating the friends had grown closer since Faye's relationship with Gareth ended last July. </p>

<p>And earlier this month, the couple put on an affectionate display as they walked hand-in-hand towards The Ivy restaurant in Manchester before posing for pictures.  </p>

<p>In February, Gareth was linked to his panto co-star Hannah Grace Lawson, but this appeared to just be a friendship. </p>

<p>New romance? Meanwhile, Faye's ex Gareth Gates, 36, is said to have found love with Ibiza regular DJ Chloe McLennan (far right)</p>

<p>Romance: A source said, 'They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since' </p>

<p> The pair starred in Cinderella over the Christmas period at Nottingham's Theatre Royal for five weeks, when Hannah portrayed the titular character, while Gareth played Prince Charming.</p>

<p>Gareth was married to dancer Suzanne Mole – with whom he shares daughter Missy, 10 – from 2008 until 2012.</p>

<p>He met his Corrie star ex Faye when they featured in Legally Blonde: The Musical, and went public with their relationship in August 2013. </p>

<p>In September 2018, it was reported Faye and Gareth briefly ended their relationship when the singer's 'very controlling' behaviour led to a series of furious rows.</p>

<p>But by November of that year, they had to give the relationship another try, with Faye pulling out of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! to spend time with him.</p>

<p>Way back when: The Pop Idol runner-up is said to have found love with the Ibiza regular as he hits the one-year mark of his split from former fiancée Faye (pictured in June 2018)</p>

<p>Red carpet debut: The soap star confirmed her new romance with personal trainer Joe in late November, when they attended a glitzy London event together</p>

<p>In a move that shocked fans, the singer asked her to marry him while they were on holiday in New York City on New Year's Eve 2018.   </p>

<p>Previously discussing the reason behind their first break-up, Gareth told OK!: 'There was a lot of strain on our relationship because I was always away with work and Faye's schedule was getting even busier so we decided we needed some breathing space.' </p>

<p>During the proposal he performed a 17-minute song about their relationship before getting down on one knee to offer Faye a £30,000 engagement ring.</p>

<p>But by mid-July of last year, Faye reportedly moved out of their shared flat. They announced they had split for good in August.  </p>

<p>Happier times: Faye and Gareth allegedly had volatile arguments over the soap actress choosing to hit the town with her Corrie co-stars without her beau, it was reported</p>
