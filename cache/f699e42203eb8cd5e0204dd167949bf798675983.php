<p>Women give specific facial cues when they're flirting, according to researchers at the University of Kansas.</p>

<p>The team used the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to identify the most recognizable flirtatious facial expressions.  </p>

<p>The technology, which describes facial movements, showed the most effective flirting cues include a head turned to one side and tilted down slightly, a slight smile, and eyes turned forward toward the target. </p>

<p>Researchers from the University of Kansas found that certain female facial expressions - including a head tilt and maintained eye contact - were almost universally recognized as flirting by men </p>

<p>Flirting is one of the key components of human sexuality, but it's only just begun to be analyzed by scientists. </p>

<p>'There are very few scientific articles out there that have systematically studied this well-known phenomenon,' said Omri Gillath, a psychologist at the University of Kansas, and co-author of the report, published in the Journal of Sex Research.</p>

<p>'None of these studies have identified the flirting facial expression and tested its effects.'</p>

<p>Gillath said an analysis of a half-dozen studies found that women's facial expressions non-verbally convey romantic or sexual interest, and that men were able to recognize those cues as representing flirting.</p>

<p>A women's flirting cue is different from a similar expression, like a regular smile, said psychologist Omri Gillath.  'It has a unique morphology'</p>

<p>He explained the looks are different from similar expressions, like smiling, that aren't always a part of flirting.</p>

<p>'It has a unique morphology, ' Gillath said.</p>

<p>We all have certain expectations of a romantic partner, but Dating Doctor Alana Kirk says someone outside the box can still be your perfect match:</p>

<p>In the studies, women were asked either to spontaneously offer what they thought was a flirtatious expression or follow the researchers' instructions on what look to give.</p>

<p>The participants were a mix of professional actresses and regular volunteers.</p>

<p>Some women were more effective at conveying a 'flirtatious' facial cue, and some men were better at recognizing it, but certain expressions were successfully identified by nearly all men as flirting.</p>

<p>After identifying these most recognized expressions of flirting, the researchers used them in experimental studies.</p>

<p>'Our findings support the role of flirtatious expression in communication and mating initiation,' Gillath said.</p>

<p>'For the first time, not only were we able to isolate and identify the expressions that represent flirting, but we were also able to reveal their function - to activate associations related with relationships and sex.'</p>

<p>A study from May also indicated visual cues played a more important role than pickup lines when it came to flirting.</p>

<p>Experts at the University of Nicosia in Cyprus surveyed more than 800 volunteers and found that both men and women said they were more likely to respond to a flirter who was good looking and well-dressed.</p>

<p>Other traits — like carrying an air of mystery or appearing determined — were important, but ranked lower.</p>

<p>In a report published in the journal Personality and Individual Difference, the authors indicated, 'Making good eye contact and having a good smell would make flirting more effective.'</p>

<p>'Women rated non-verbal behaviors and a gentle approach as more effective on them, while men rated good looks as more effective.'</p>

<p>Older participants reacted better to a respectful and polite manner from a would-be suitor.</p>

<p>'Flirting is an essential aspect of human interaction and key for the formation of intimate relationships,' the report said.</p>
