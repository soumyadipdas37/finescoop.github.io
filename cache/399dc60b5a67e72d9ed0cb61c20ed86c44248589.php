<p>FOX11 obtained a photo of the female deputy, who has not been named but was described as a 31-year-old mother of a six-year-old boy, covered in blood after she was shot in the jaw by an unidentified male gunman just before 7pm Saturday in the city's Compton neighborhood.   </p>

<p>The outlet reported that the female deputy managed to call for help and tended to her partner, who was also struck in the head and has only been described as a 24-year-old male. </p>

<p>Both deputies are said to be in stable condition and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LACSD) is offering a $100,000 reward for information about the 'dark-skinned' suspect who remains at large as of Monday morning. </p>

<p>Video showed the suspect approaching an LACSD vehicle parked outside the Metro Blue Line station and opening fire before he fled on foot. </p>

<p>One of the two Los Angeles deputies who were shot in the head in an ambush on Saturday night helped save her partner's life by applying a tourniquet after she radioed for back-up. FOX11 obtained a photo (above) of the female deputy, who has not been named but was described as a 31-year-old mother of a six-year-old boy, covered in blood after she was shot in the jaw</p>

<p>Video released by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department shows the moment that male suspect opened fire on two deputies at a Compton bus station before fleeing on foot</p>

<p>Moments after the gunman runs away, the passenger door of the patrol car opens and a deputy stumbles out, pressing a hand to their head.</p>

<p>The driver's-side door opens soon after. </p>

<p>On the radio, according to footage reviewed by the paper, a shaky voice mutters: '998 Compton Pax.'</p>

<p>Recognizing the code for a deputy-involved shooting, a dispatcher asks: 'Just happened?'</p>

<p>'Compton Pax, deputies down,' the voice says, almost unintelligibly. 'Compton Pax 998.'   </p>

<p>Authorities said that the deputies, who both graduated from the police academy 14 months ago, each sustained multiple gunshot wounds. </p>

<p>Investigators are still working to determine the motive for the shooting, which they said occurred 'without warning or provocation'.</p>

<p>The suspect was described as a black male between 28 and 30 years old. He was wearing dark clothing at the time of the shooting and was last seen in a black four-door sedan.  </p>

<p>'We have a very, very generic description,' Capt Kent Wegner said, noting that officers were blanketing the area in search of the suspect. The FBI announced that it was assisting in the manhunt on Sunday.  </p>

<p>'That was a cowardly act,' Sheriff Villanueva said at a press conference. 'The two deputies were doing their job, minding their own business, watching out for the safety of the people on the train.</p>

<p>'Seeing somebody just walk up and start shooting on them. It p***es me off. It dismays me at the same time. There's no pretty way to say it.' </p>

<p>LAPD Chief Michael Moore tweeted: 'Tonight we pray for these two guardians to survive. I recognize and acknowledge we live in troubled times. But we must as a community work thru our differences while loudly and resoundly condemn violence. Blessed are the Peacemakers.'  </p>

<p>On Sunday evening a video emerged showing a bystander mocking the attack on the officers as a large convoy of patrol cars raced to the scene. </p>

<p>'Compton. N***** just aired the police out,' the unidentified narrator says with a smile. 'That's crazy. Damn. It goes down in Compton.'  </p>

<p>'It's going up. Somebody bust on their a**. Somebody bust on the police. Two sheriffs shot in the face. Two sheriffs shot in the face - they tripping. </p>

<p>'Somebody just ran up on the corner and bust on their a**, right through the window'. He then concludes, grinning: 'It's a wrap.' </p>

<p>NEW: LASD &amp; the families of the two ambushed deputies have given me permission to show this graphic photo of the moment after they were shot. I’m told female deputy was shot through jaw, still radioed for help &amp; applied tourniquet to male deputy’s wounds. Both stable now. <?php echo e('@'); ?>FOXLA pic.twitter.com/6m06qec1v2</p>

<p>Newly emerged footage shows police patrol cars rushing to the scene in Compton on Saturday night</p>

<p>Bystanders filmed as the officers rushed to the aid of their injured colleagues, shot by a gunman in an unprovoked attack</p>

<p>The smiling man narrates to the camera. 'Compton. N***** just aired the police out,' he says. That's crazy. Damn. It goes down in Compton' </p>

<p>Donald Trump on Sunday said the man who opened fire should face a 'fast trial death penalty' if the deputies die. </p>

<p>Speaking at a rally in Nevada on Sunday night, he said: 'If you murder a police officer, you should receive the death penalty.'</p>

<p>To loud cheers, he continued: 'I just saw a video of that animal who went up to the car. They were unsuspecting, fine people - very fine people.' </p>

<p>He earlier called the shooter an 'animal' who needed to be 'hit hard' as the FBI was called in to help investigate.</p>

<p>The president tweeted: 'If they die, fast trial death penalty for the killer. Only way to stop this!' </p>

<p>He had retweeted his son Donald Jr. who shared the footage, writing: 'Please pray for these two Sheriff Deputies. Their lives matter!!! #BlueLivesMatter.'</p>

<p>Joe Biden said: 'This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice. Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished. Jill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery.' </p>

<p>Kamala Harris added: 'Doug and I are keeping the two Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies in our hearts as they currently fight for their lives after a horrific attack last night. The perpetrator must be brought to justice.'  </p>

<p>A large group of detectives arrived to inspect the scene of the shooting, near the bus terminal</p>

<p>Detectives are pictured arriving at the scene of Saturday night's shooting in Compton</p>

<p>The two officers were shot as they sat in their patrol car shortly before 7pm on Saturday</p>

<p>Heavily-armed police officers were seen arriving on the scene in Compton</p>

<p>Shameful footage said to have been taken outside St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood on Saturday night shows as one protester yells: 'I want to deliver a message to the family of the pigs, I hope they f***ing die.' The protesters had been connected to the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter but that has not been officially confirmed. </p>

<p>Another demonstrator tells police: 'Y'all gonna die one by one. This ain't gonna stop.' </p>

<p>On Sunday the LA county sheriffs office tweeted: 'To the protesters blocking the entrance &amp; exit of the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM yelling 'We hope they die' referring to 2 LA Sheriff's ambushed today in #Compton: DO NOT BLOCK EMERGENCY ENTRIES &amp; EXITS TO THE HOSPITAL. </p>

<p>'People's lives are at stake when ambulances can't get through.'   </p>

<p>On Sunday the LA county sheriffs office tweeted about the protests outside the hospital </p>

<p>One local faith leader had told KABC: 'They were saying "Death to the police" and "Kill the police," and these are sheriffs, but the message is still the same. They were using all types of curse words and derogatory terms. Unacceptable behavior, because a hospital should be a sanctuary.'</p>

<p>A radio reporter who was near the protest scene was taken into custody, KABC-TV reported. The sheriff's department later tweeted that the reporter interfered with the arrest of a male protester. </p>

<p>Police later added: 'After deputies issued a dispersal order for the unlawful assembly of a group of protesters blocking the hospital emergency entrance &amp; exits, a male adult protester refused to comply &amp; cooperate…</p>

<p>'During his arrest, a struggle ensued at which time a female adult ran towards the deputies, ignored repeated commands to stay back as they struggled with the male and interfered with the arrest…</p>

<p>'The female adult, who was later identified as a member of the press, did not identify herself as press and later admitted she did not have proper press credentials on her person. Both individuals have been arrested for 148 P.C.'   </p>
