<p>Subject to government approval, they are working towards supporters returning for Sheffield United’s October 3 visit, with fans set to be allowed in stadiums again for reduced capacity matches from the start of the month.</p>

<p>Arsenal expect the allowed initial capacity to range between 15 and 25 per cent which, in their near-61,000-seater stadium home, equates to between 9000 and 15,000 supporters.</p>

<p>Arsenal are set to welcome back up to 15,000 fans for the game v Sheffield United next month</p>

<p>Priority access to the available tickets will be given to Arsenal’s gold season ticket holders and premium members. Arsenal have 48,000 eligible fans and all tickets will be distributed following a ballot.</p>

<p>Rather than renew their season tickets, supporters have until 5pm on September 10 to make the initial payment required to secure their place in the ballot scheme for the lower capacity games.</p>

<p>Priority access to tickets will be given to the club's gold season ticket holders and premium members</p>
