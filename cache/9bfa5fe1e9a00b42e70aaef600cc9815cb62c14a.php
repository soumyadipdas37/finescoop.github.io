<p>Relatively small size and with a pleasing natural design, the CkeyiN Mini Essential Oil Diffuser is particularly popular with those looking for a discreet desk or bedroom diffuser. </p>

<p>It has a 90ml capacity so isn't as effective on larger room but reviewers still praise it for its solid stream without being to overpowering scent wise.  </p>

<p>One delighted shopper wrote: 'This one is absolutely lovely. It is so dinky and perfect for a bedroom or an office. It is very oriental looking, which is beautiful. </p>

<p>The diffuser provides a light mist that is both relaxing, calming and not at all overbearing. The added bonus of the light is brilliant and looks so pretty once it starts to go dark outside. It is so therapeutic and pretty to look at.'</p>

<p>Just add water and a couple of drops of essential oil to create an instant mood-booster to any room </p>
