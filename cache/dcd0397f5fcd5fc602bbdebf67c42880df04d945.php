<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>David and Victoria Beckham are said to have caught CORONAVIRUS while partying in LA, California back in March.</p>

<p>According to a new report, the couple feared they were 'super-spreaders' after flying back to the UK for son Brooklyn's 21st birthday before jetting back over to America, to spend time in Miami, Florida - all within the space of two weeks.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that it was in Miami that the football legend, 45, began to feel unwell, with his designer wife, 46, developing a sore throat and a high temperature soon after, and several of their staff also catching the virus.</p>

<p>Super-spreaders!? David, 45, and Victoria Beckham, 46, are said to have secretly caught COVID-19 while partying in LA before flying back to the UK, and then jetting over to Miami (Pictured at son Brooklyn's 21st birthday party in the Cotswolds on March 6th)</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'It was an absolute nightmare scenario,' explaining how David was in LA schmoozing on behalf of his club Inter Miami, when Victoria and their children flew over to support him.</p>

<p>'They attended a couple of swanky networking events as David had promotional duties, and were shaking hands and kissing fans and various club dignitaries,' claimed the insider.</p>

<p>The footballer and the former Spice Girl then flew back to London where they went to their Cotswolds estate to celebrate their eldest son's 21st birthday in style. </p>

<p>The couple then flew to Miami, which is when David reportedly started to feel unwell and soon after Victoria developed a sore throat and a high temperature.  </p>

<p>The source claimed that several of the Beckhams' team, including drivers, bodyguards and PAs - also fell ill, 'a couple of them very badly so'.</p>

<p>According to the insider, Victoria 'really panicked' and forced the entire family to quarantine rigidly for more than the required two week period, defined by the UK government.</p>

<p>'She was utterly petrified they might be super-spreaders, and did all she could to minimise all future risk,' said the source.  </p>

<p>It has also been claimed that, after making full recoveries, the couple checked in regularly with their team.</p>

<p>They allegedly sent 'care packages' to at least two staff members who were particularly badly affected.</p>

<p>The Beckhams then spent lockdown quarantined in their country manor, which boasts a swimming pool, hot tub, and of course a football pitch. </p>

<p>Following their recovery from COVID-19, Victoria and David are said to have had swab and antibody tests to ensure they no longer had the virus, before jetting off on holiday to Greece and Italy. </p>

<p>David Beckham's representatives declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.</p>
