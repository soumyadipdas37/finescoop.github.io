<p>That's your lot for today - tune in again tomorrow for all the latest transfer news from across the continent!</p>

<p>Have a good evening! </p>

<p>Fati - who broke a 95-year national record earlier this month to become Spain's youngest ever goalscorer - has signed a new contract until 2024 which includes a mammoth £367million (€400m) release clause.</p>

<p>Fati's original deal at the LaLiga outfit was due to expire in two years time but the club have tied him down to fresh terms and increased his original £211m release clause by £156m.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands Rudiger has once again been left out of Frank Lampard’s plans for Wednesday night’s Carabao Cup clash against Barnsley.</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain are interested in taking the central defender during this window - a season long loan appears the most likely scenario for the German international. </p>

<p>Coady has three years remaining on his current contract but talks are underway to improve on those terms, thought to be worth about £50,000 a week.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old signed that deal in February 2019 but so important has he been to Wolves' progress under Nuno Espírito Santo that he is likely to be rewarded with another increase.</p>

<p>Could Luis Suarez be partnering up with Uruguay team-mate Edinson Cavani in the Spanish capital? </p>

<p>Cavani is a free agent having left PSG in the summer and Atletico have now reportedly thrown their hat into the ring, with club chiefs dispatched to the French capital on Monday to meet the player's agents.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan will sign for two seasons with Atletico, who have agreed to pay just under £4m for each of the two seasons for which the striker will sign for.</p>

<p>Suarez's tears upon leaving Barcelona's training ground on Wednesday appear to signal the end of yet another transfer saga at the Catalan side this summer.</p>

<p>With a fairly high price tag, Spurs have apparently tried to add in Tanguy Ndombele as a makeweight.</p>

<p>However the Italian club are not interested, and only want cash if they are to part with the Slovakian defender.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had reportedly made the player a top target but hopes of a deal were ended abruptly when United heard the asking price.</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin only cost Everton £1.5m when they signed him from Sheffield United four years ago.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has reportedly concluded his incoming business this summer, despite links to Ismaila Sarr and Ousmane Dembele - however some members of the first-team could still be on their way out before the international transfer deadline on October 5</p>

<p>The future of 20-year-old striker Rhian Brewster is not certain, as well as the futures of Marko Grujic and Xherdan Shaqiri. </p>

<p>The Gunners have been heavily linked with a move for Partey as they look to strengthen their resources in midfield.</p>

<p>Arsenal could now offer Torreira to Atletico as part of a cash-plus-player deal.</p>

<p>Could Wolves be about to make another star acquisition? Costa's agent Jorge Mendes, who also looks after Cristiano Ronaldo, is reportedly looking for a new club for Costa.</p>

<p>He is currently looking to push forward a deal with Wolves, who are looking for a replacement winger after selling Diogo Jota to Liverpool last week. </p>

<p>The chaos at the Camp Nou continues! The Spanish giants have been in a state of crisis this summer amid the coronavirus crisis  while they were left to pick up the pieces following the huge fall-out from the Lionel Messi transfer saga.</p>

<p>Luis Suarez had been given the green light to leave for Atletico Madrid but there has reportedly been a significant split in the Barca boardroom over the club's choice to allow the experienced striker to join their La Liga rivals.</p>

<p>French transfer expert Jonathan Johnson says that Mbappe, who scored 30 goals in all competitions last season, is more likely to commit his future to PSG than be enticed by an exit.</p>

<p>'Kylian Mbappe is the future for this PSG project and I just don't see them giving him up without a fight. I don't think either of Real Madrid or Liverpool would be able to pay what PSG would even consider just to go to the table and negotiate next summer,' Johnson said. </p>

<p>The German side wanted Sorloth as a replacement for Timo Werner, following his £49million move to Chelsea, after the Norwegian's stunning season on loan at Trabzonspor.</p>

<p>Leipzig will pay around €22million (£20m) for the 24-year-old, with Palace splitting the money 50-50 with Trabzonspor.</p>

<p>Llorente will be the second Spain international to join in the window with the club having already secured Rodrigo from Valencia.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old, who has been capped five times by his country, has not always convinced regarding his consistency but Leeds hope his experience can help their young squad.</p>

<p>Barca have announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning that the defender has left the Nou Camp for the Premier League.</p>

<p>He brings the Portuguese cohort of Nuno Espirito Santo's squad back up to 10 following the departure of Diogo Jota to Liverpool at the weekend. </p>

<p>The Catalans were reportedly preparing to make a fresh offer for Aarons after agreeing a five-year contract with the defender - but Ronaldo Koeman has turned his attentions back to Dest.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old American international is also wanted by Bayern after impressing in the Eredivisie last season.</p>

<p>Could it really all happen again?! Gotze is currently a free agent after his contract with Borussia Dortmund expired earlier this summer.</p>

<p>Gotze was lured away from Dortmund by Bayern and Pep Guardiola in the summer of 2013 when he was one of the hottest prospects in European football but failed to make an impact in Bavaria and returned to his former club in 2016.</p>

<p>The agreement also gives Juve an option to buy the 27-year-old at the end of the season for £41m to be paid over three years.</p>

<p>They could otherwise take him on loan again for the 2021-22 season for another £9m and then buy him outright in 2022 at a reduced cost of £32m.</p>

<p>A deal for Jose would reportedly cost Barcelona, who have endured a turbulent summer amid the Lionel Messi transfer saga and their finances taking a hit due to coronavirus, around £28m.</p>

<p>Barcelona's sporting director Ramon Planes is a huge admirer of the Real Sociedad striker and is behind the club's push for his services.</p>

<p>Serie A outfit Torino are reportedly still very much in the hunt for the Uruguayan despite Atletico currently winning the race for his signature.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old burst onto the scene in some style in north London but he now appears to be out of the picture under manager Mikel Arteta.</p>

<p>This is our main bit of transfer news this morning - Spurs are reportedly hunting the signature of Napoli forward Arkadiusz Milik!</p>

<p>The Poland striker appeared to be on his way to Roma this summer, but that move collapsed and now Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is desperate to bring in a striker to provide back-up for England captain Harry Kane.</p>
