<p>Tyre dust — produced every time a vehicle brakes, accelerates or turns a corner — is estimated to account for half of all road transport particulate emissions.</p>

<p>In Europe alone, this wear-and-tear releases half a million tonnes of microscopic particles out into the environment, researchers have estimated.</p>

<p>In fact, after single-use plastics, the tiny bits of rubber from tyres are the next largest source of microplastic pollutant that ends up in the world's oceans. </p>

<p>British students have won this year's James Dyson Award for an invention, depicted, that can capture the microparticles shed by tyres as a car drives along</p>

<p>'Everyone focuses on air pollution being directly from the engines themselves and coming out of the exhaust pipe,' Tyre Collective member and engineer Hugo Richardson told the Reuters news agency.</p>

<p>'But what people don't necessarily recognise is that tire wear is a huge contributor to that — and that's partly down to its microscopic size and the fact that you don't obviously see it all the time.'</p>

<p>Mr Richardson and colleagues said that — when tested in a controlled environment —their prototype can collect around 60 per cent of all airborne particles released from a vehicle's tyres.</p>

<p>The collected particles can be recycled — turning them into inks and dyes, or even back in new tyres. </p>

<p>The significant reduction in traffic brought about by the coronavirus lockdown has given people a glimpse of how clean a city's air can be, Mr Richardson said.</p>

<p>'I think we all realise that clean air in our cities is not a pipedream any more, but something that is immediately achievable with some clever innovation and some impetus from those in charge.'</p>

<p>The benefits to public health could be profound, the researchers have said.</p>

<p>'These particles are actually small enough to be inhaled,' said Siobhan Anderson, a member of the Innovation Design Engineering program offered jointly by Imperial College London and the Royal College of Art.</p>

<p>'So they can cause different lung diseases and developmental issues — and they also enter our water and eventually make their way through our food chain and come back to us.'</p>

<p>The team — dubbed 'The Tyre Collective' — made a device that captures the air- and water-polluting dust at the source and is wrapped around part of the edge of a tyre, as pictured</p>

<p>The device It uses a combination of the aerodynamics of the spinning wheel and electrostatics to collect the dust, pictured, which become positively charged due to friction with the road</p>

<p>According to the researchers, the increasing shift towards electric vehicles will likely see pollution from exhaust emissions fall — but tyre particles will remain an issue.</p>

<p>In fact, the team believes that tyre emissions may actually increase, as electric vehicles are heavier — due to added battery weight — causing more tyre wear.</p>

<p>The Tyre Collective, which won in £2,000 prize money, will now progress to the international stage of the James Dyson Award — the results of which will be announced on November 19, 2020.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the team is working on securing a patent for their design and continuing the project as a start-up venture.</p>

<p>Urban flooding is causing microplastics to be flushed into our oceans even faster than thought, according to scientists looking at pollution in rivers.</p>

<p>Waterways in Greater Manchester are now so heavily contaminated by microplastics that particles are found in every sample - including even the smallest streams.</p>

<p>This pollution is a major contributor to contamination in the oceans, researchers found as part of the first detailed catchment-wide study anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>This debris - including microbeads and microfibres - are toxic to ecosystems.</p>

<p>Scientists tested 40 sites around Manchester and found every waterway contained these small toxic particles.</p>

<p>Microplastics are very small pieces of plastic debris including microbeads, microfibres and plastic fragments.</p>

<p>It has long been known they enter river systems from multiple sources including industrial effluent, storm water drains and domestic wastewater.</p>

<p>However, although around 90 per cent of microplastic contamination in the oceans is thought to originate from land, not much is known about their movements.</p>

<p>Most rivers examined had around 517,000 plastic particles per square metre, according to researchers from the University of Manchester who carried out the detailed study.</p>

<p>Following a period of major flooding, the researchers re-sampled at all of the sites.</p>

<p>They found levels of contamination had fallen at the majority of them, and the flooding had removed about 70 per cent of the microplastics stored on the river beds.</p>

<p>This demonstrates that flood events can transfer large quantities of microplastics from urban river to the oceans.</p>
