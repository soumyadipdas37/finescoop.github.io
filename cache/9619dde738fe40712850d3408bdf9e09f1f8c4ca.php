<p>Kim Kardashian announced Tuesday that she will 'freeze' her Instagram and Facebook accounts because the platforms allow for hate and misinformation as a part of the #StopHateForProfit campaign</p>

<p>The 39-year-old reality star said that groups take advantage of the platforms to 'sow division and split America apart' </p>

<p>'I love that I can connect directly with you through Instagram and Facebook, but I can’t sit by and stay silent while these platforms continue to allow the spreading of hate, propaganda and misinformation - created by groups to sow division and split America apart – only to take steps after people are killed,' she said in a lengthy message Tuesday. </p>

<p>'Misinformation shared on social media has a serious impact on our elections and undermines our democracy. Please join me tomorrow when I will be “freezing” my Instagram and FB account to tell Facebook to #StopHateForProfit. Link in bio for more info on how to preserve truth,' she added.</p>

<p>Kardashian is the seventh most followed person on Instagram with 188million followers and she has more than 30million on Facebook. </p>

<p>She's joining the #StopHateForProfit campaign demanding accountability and change at the tech giant Facebook, which owns Instagram, accusing the social networking platform of 'undermining out democracy'. </p>

<p>The campaign is asking participants to participate in a 24-hour Instagram 'freeze' on September 16 and the 'Week of Action' will end on September 18 with a call for prople to vote. </p>

<p>Facebook has come under fire for questionable ads during the 2016 election and for allowing hate groups to gather on its platforms.</p>

<p>Facebook was also heavily criticized for failing to take down a self-proclaimed militia group’s online event to calling for an attack on protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin following the police shootingof Jacob Blake, according to The Verge.</p>

<p>On August 26 two people were killed by a 17-year-old anti-protester armed with a rifle.</p>

<p>Afterwards it was revealed that the Kenosha Guard, a group that calls themselves a militia organization, issued a 'call to arms' on the platform. </p>

<p>At least two separate Facebook users reported the account for inciting violence prior to the shooting, but the Kenosha Guard’s Facebook page was only taken down the morning after the deadly shooting.</p>

<p>Facebook said in a statement at the time that the company’s investigation had produced no direct links between the shooting and the Kenosha Guard accounts.</p>
