<p>While Jared is still in Washington, D.C. and kids Arabella and Theodore have not yet been spotted in New York, Ivanka's arrival comes in time for the start of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sundown tonight. </p>

<p>Back home! Ivanka Trump was pictured arriving at her Manhattan apartment last night, marking the first time that she has been photographed in NYC since the pandemic hit the US earlier this year</p>

<p>Outfit: She was dressed down in dark skinny jeans and a light gray sweatshirt and accessorized with a pair of plain black flats, a simple white bag, and a printed pink face mask</p>

<p>Ivanka was somewhat low-profile — or as low-profiled as a person can be in a convoy of three Secret Service vehicles with seven Secret Service agents — as she walked into her Park Avenue home at sundown on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Along with her unfussy outfit, the First Daughter accessorized with a pair of plain black flats, a simple white bag, and a printed pink face mask.</p>

<p>Ivanka donned the same jeans, shoes, and bag for the errand, but switched up her top, ditching the gray sweater for a short-sleeve black mock-turtleneck. </p>

<p>She walked around the headquarters with Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, waving and speaking to volunteers — and at one point, she gave the woman she was talking to a fist bump. </p>

<p>After her visit, she sat down with Gov. Ducey and others to participate in a roundtable discussion about America's working families.  </p>

<p>Ivanka's trip to Arizona marked the first time the first daughter has visited the state since her father was elected, but that wasn't her only visit for the day.</p>

<p>Jennifer Holton, a reporter for FOX13 News, tweeted that Ivanka had 'ordered three loaves of Cuban bread and guava pastries from La Segunda to bring back home to DC tonight.'</p>

<p>Ivanka remained perfectly coiffed after her bread-making lesson, with not one blonde hair out of place when she headed to her next stop: Columbia Restaurant.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump's eldest daughter joined former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi at the establishment, which is the oldest restaurant in the state.</p>

<p>They sat down with other local leaders for an intimate 'fireside chat.'</p>

<p>Ivanka removed her mask for the conversation and sat slightly less than six feet apart from Bondi as they discussed the effect of COVID-19 on small businesses, among other things.  </p>
