<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Police in New York have arrested a homeless man who placed metal clamps on the subway tracks and watched, laughing, as the train derailed, injuring three people. </p>

<p>The incident occurred in the West Village, as the uptown A train was entering the 14th St - Eighth Avenue station at 8:17 am.</p>

<p>The homeless man had found a pile of tie plates, which are normally used to secure the train tracks to the foundations, on a pile of construction materials at the 14th St. station, police sources told the New York Daily News. </p>

<p>He took the plates and put them on the tracks before the train came into the station. </p>

<p>When the train pulled in, three of the subway cars derailed - and the homeless man was seen laughing as the train swerved.</p>
