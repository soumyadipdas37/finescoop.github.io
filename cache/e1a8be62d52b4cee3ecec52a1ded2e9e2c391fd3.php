<p>Deputy medical examiner Dr. Andrew Hanosh told the court via teleconference that Zhao's tongue had been burned, her hair had been singed off and smoke and soot were discovered in her airways and lungs, leading to the conclusion that she was alive when she was set on fire.</p>

<p>Nahosh estimated that Zhao suffered burns to at least 90 per cent of her body.</p>

<p>An autopsy also revealed extensive damage to the victim's genitals from having been 'punched' with a fist or another object. Court records previously revealed that Zhao had been restrained with zip-ties and sexually assaulted before her death.</p>

<p>Both Morris and Zhao stayed at the Sherwood Motel in Waterford, and an FBI agent told the court that cellphone tower records indicated that the pair traveled from the motel to a remote part of the recreational area.</p>

<p>Zhao was last seen alive by her mother on July 12 around 5.30pm.</p>

<p>Her charred body was discovered at around 8:05 a.m. the next morning by two men in the wooded parking area of the state park.</p>

<p>Morris has a long history of violent and sexual crimes dating back more than three decades</p>

<p>Cell phone records confirm Morris and Zhao met up on the night of July 12, according to newly-obtained court documents.</p>

<p>Morris told cops after his arrest he had picked Zhao up on Watkins Lake Road and they checked into the Sherwood Motel around 9:26 p.m. on July 12.</p>

<p>The suspected killer said the pair then left the motel briefly to buy alcohol at a party store before returning.</p>

<p>Zhao then left the motel at midnight 'and took all of her belongings including her cell phone with her,' Morris told cops.</p>

<p>However, cell phone records place Zhao's cell phone at the motel until around 5 a.m. the following morning - the same time both cell phone records and surveillance footage captured Morris leaving the motel, the court documents show.</p>

<p>The suspect then drove to the remote 3,745-acre park where he stayed for around seven minutes, WXYZ reported.</p>

<p>Police believe Morris bound Zhao with zip-ties, sexually assaulted her with a large object before she was 'lit on fire until she died'.</p>

<p>Several footwear impressions, hairs, fibers and other items with possible blood stains and duffel bags with Morris' identification inside were also found in the car, court records show.</p>

<p>Morris has a long history of violent and sexual crimes dating back more than three decades.</p>

<p>Morris was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in Oakland County Circuit Court in 1989 and has multiple domestic violence charges including pleading guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence in 2009.</p>

<p>At the time of Zhao's murder, he was on probation for retail fraud.  </p>
