<p>He said: 'Just back in the house from mucking out &amp; my wife said “are you sure you are meant to be here this morning?”'</p>

<p>Another said: 'Cancelled [Sky subscription] a while ago mate, if it isn't the shocking commentary its the fun taken out of the shows. Its just boring!'</p>

<p>Someone else added: 'Absolute joke!!! Cancelled the programme then rename an hour on the news channel after the show!!!</p>

<p>'What’s coming next? An hour with a journalist and call it Sunday supplement??!!'</p>

<p>Kamara is still a commentator on Sky Sports' Soccer Saturday show which has seen big changes this summer.</p>

<p>Regulars Matt Le Tissier, Charlie Nicholas and Phil Thompson were all sacked and replaced by Sue Smith, Clinton Morrison, Tim Sherwood, Tony Pulis and Glen Johnson.  </p>
