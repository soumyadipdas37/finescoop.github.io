<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain's biggest store chains are pinning their hopes on a bumper Christmas despite fears that strict measures to stop a second wave of coronavirus could devastate business.</p>

<p>After lurching to a £635million half-year loss – and revealing there would be no staff bonus for the first time since 1953 – John Lewis Partnership chairman Dame Sharon White said the festive season would be 'particularly important' for its department stores and Waitrose supermarkets this year.</p>

<p>And Next chief executive Lord Wolfson warned the recently enforced 'rule of six' is 'likely to depress demand for gifts and clothing associated with traditional family get-togethers' if it remains in place in December.</p>

<p>John Lewis Partnership boss Dame Sharon White, right, said Christmas would be 'particularly important' while Next chief exec Lord Wolfson, left, fears 'rule of six' may depress demand</p>

<p>Retailers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, are understood to have become increasingly nervous that the restrictions on social gatherings will curb festive celebration, denting sales of food, drink and party dresses.</p>

<p>In a letter to staff confirming they would not receive a bonus, White acknowledged the outlook is 'uncertain' but said households are particularly 'excited' about Christmas this year.</p>

<p>John Lewis opened its Christmas shop section on its website on August 24 – ten days earlier than it did last year – following a surge in online enquiries about festive products including Christmas trees, baubles, and mince pies.</p>

<p>White insisted she is not being 'naive' about the risk posed by further lockdowns, curfews and the Government's new 'rule of six' limit on social gatherings.</p>

<p>But she said: 'We can see in the trading right now how excited people are. Most families are going to want a bit of a lift this Christmas however we're going to celebrate it. </p>

<p>'We've got some fantastic plans in both brands really to deliver the best Christmas for families after what I think for everybody has been a pretty torrid, pretty difficult year.'</p>

<p>Pippa Wicks, John Lewis executive director, said: 'We are expecting the same demand as last year, if not better than last year.' </p>

<p>Waitrose has reported a surge in online orders since it severed ties with Ocado at the start of the month.</p>

<p>The upmarket grocer is battling to boost its online business, after Ocado joined forces with Marks &amp; Spencer to deliver shopping to Middle England households.</p>

<p>Yesterday it claimed Waitrose.com is doing a roaring trade – delivering around 170,000 orders a week, up from around 60,000 before the pandemic.</p>

<p>The supermarket also said it had seen a ‘strong pick-up in demand’ since the end of its relationship with Ocado on September 1 , with Waitrose.com orders up 9 per cent in the first week.</p>

<p>The Co-op has seized its biggest share of the grocery market for almost two decades as the pandemic drives ‘exceptional’ demand.</p>

<p>The business said families were eating out less frequently and shopping closer to home, delivering a boost to its food sales.</p>

<p>It helped the grocer grow its market share to a peak of 7.4 per cent in July, according to research by Kantar, up from 6 per cent before the Covid-19 lockdown. The boom in demand also lifted Co-op’s revenues by 7.6 per cent to £5.8billion in the 26 weeks to July 4, with profits surging 35 per cent to £27million. </p>

<p>On the back of the success, the group is handing staff a pay rise.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson has revealed plans to loosen the rule of six so that extended families can spend Christmas together. </p>

<p>But the Prime Minister has insisted this will only be possible if people abide by the social distancing rules now, to help stop the rise in infections.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Sun he said this may involve imposing a curfew on business such as pubs to flatten the curve.</p>

<p>A dent in Christmas sales is the last thing that struggling retailers – including John Lewis – need. John Lewis, famous for its Christmas adverts each year, revealed the devastating impact of the coronavirus crisis on the group, which includes Waitrose.</p>

<p>It was forced to write down the value of John Lewis stores by £470million after their closure during the lockdown accelerated the switch to online shopping.</p>

<p>This, allied with £200million in lost sales from the lockdown and a £50million Covid bill, including for PPE equipment for staff, dragged the John Lewis Partnership to a £635million loss in the six months to the end of July. </p>

<p>Even without these exceptional items, it fell to a pre-tax loss of £55million. Meanwhile, Next increased its full-year earnings outlook for the second time in as many months after a surge in summer sales.</p>

<p>Sales were boosted by fewer people taking holidays abroad in August and cool weather at the end of the month – compared to a heatwave last year – which buoyed demand for its warmer autumn ranges. </p>

<p>While full-price sales plunged by a third in its first half, Next also said trading since the lockdown had been 'resilient' due to strong online sales. </p>

<p>The fashion chain expects to turn a full year profit of £300million – down heavily on the £729million the previous year but up sharply from the £195million it had been predicting in July.</p>

<p>But it said it fell to a loss of £16.5million in the six months to the end of July – down from a profit of £327.4million last year. And it warned the end of the furlough scheme, a rise in the infection rate over the winter and tighter social distancing rules could hit sales.</p>

<p>The retailer also revealed it expects to renew leases on 60 stores. Based on negotiations with landlords so far it expects it to slash rents by half on average – saving it just under £10million a year.</p>
