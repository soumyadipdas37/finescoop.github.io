<p>Her former partner John Salmon, 49, was sentenced to a two-year conditional release order without conviction at Sutherland Local Court in Sydney's south on Tuesday, after threatening to publish explicit images of her after the pair broke up in May 2018.</p>

<p>The father of three was outraged after Ms Giles left an insulting comment on his Instagram page, the Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>'Good times! Before I found out your (sic) were cheating with the two dollar shop version of me and before that months of lying and cheating with others,' Ms Giles wrote according to agreed police facts.</p>

<p>'You and (the woman) will be very happy as long as you keep your Viagra script current, keep flashing your cash and keep the cocaine coming.'</p>

<p>Salmon's solicitor Michael Corbett told Magistrate Jayeann Carney the social media outburst from the founder of boutique law firm Company Giles, was a 'high level provocation'.</p>

<p>He said Mr Salmon now knows full well he should have handled the situation differently.</p>

<p>Mr Corbett told the court the victim deliberately intended to damage Salmon's reputation as a businessman, as a father, as a good friend to others.</p>

<p>Although he now wishes he would have taken the moral high ground, Ms Corbett said her comments were the trigger or catalyst for Salmon him to behave in the way that he did. </p>

<p>The court heard the drama unfolded when Salmon ended their eight-month relationship after a bitter argument.</p>

<p>Ms Giles had rummaged through Salmon's car without consent to locate his phone and contact a woman she wrongly suspected he was having a secret relationship with, the court heard.</p>

<p>When Ms Giles confronted Salmon he immediately left the premises.</p>

<p>The following day when Salmon was on a flight to New Zealand, Ms Giles took to Instagram, tagging several of the former couple's friends.</p>

<p>'I'm furious, if she doesn't take down the posts … I have no hesitation in sharing explicit photos of her in response to the messages and in a published form to the likes of Sydney Confidential. I'm not f<strong>king joking – if she wants to play this game, I'll f</strong>k her up,' Salmon wrote to their mutual friend in response.</p>

<p>In 2019 and 2020, Ms Giles was voted Best Reputational Risk Lawyer in NSW by Global Law Experts. </p>

<p>The glamorous lawyer once featured in a 2004 Vogue article detailing her incredible story of survival during the Boxing Day Tsunami after her beach bungalow on Phi Phi island in Thailand was smashed by the soaring tide.</p>

<p>Her body was ripped to shreds and she was eventually rescued by the Thai military  and taken to hospital.</p>

<p>With resources in the country stretched to their limits after the disaster, she underwent a blood transfusion and life-saving emergency surgery without any anaesthetic. </p>

<p>After arriving back in Sydney, she had to undergo another 140 surgeries including tissue transplants and skin grafts.</p>

<p>Ms Giles was critically ill and had developed a flesh-eating bacterial disease that caused her to to fall into a coma.</p>

<p>She was told she may never be able to have children. But since then she has fully recovered and now has two children.</p>
