<p>Horrific pain: Former Love Island star Erin Barnett (pictured), 24, recalled how she dropped down to her knees in the shower in 'horrific' pain on Monday when an ovarian cyst ruptured, in a candid Instagram post on Sunday </p>

<p>'Monday I had a cyst rupture inside on my right ovary that was slowly growing,' Erin began her post.</p>

<p>'I've had a cyst rupture inside my left ovary before it was completely removed, so I was well aware what I was feeling Monday night was a cyst rupture.'</p>

<p>Erin recalled how she went into panic mode, knowing the pain that was forthcoming.</p>

<p>Dropping down to her knees in 'indescribable' pain, she went on to describe the 'pool of blood running down the drain' and her skin 'burning' from extreme bloating.</p>

<p>Erin first discovered she had the debilitating disorder when she had a three-litre cyst removed from her ovary at the age of just 15.</p>

<p>'Everyone asking about my stomach tattoo. I got this tattoo to cover up scars on my stomach as I've had many ovary operations due to having endometriosis and polycystic ovaries,' she explained in 2019.</p>

<p>At the time, Erin also revealed that she can't have children naturally.</p>

<p>Endometriosis is present when the tissue that is similar to the lining of the uterus (womb) grows outside this layer and causes pain and/or infertility.</p>

<p>There are a wide variety of symptoms - pain can affect areas ranging from the abdomen and lower back to the pelvis and vagina. </p>

<p>Other symptoms include painful sexual intercourse, abnormal menstruation, nausea, bloating, and pain with bowel movements.   </p>

<p>The only way that the diagnosis of endometriosis can be made is to undergo a laparoscopy and have a tissue sample taken.</p>

<p>There is no cure, but treatments such as hormones and excision surgery, are available.</p>
