<p>This week, the remaining women return to The Bachelor mansion after production was temporarily suspended in March due to the escalating pandemic.</p>

<p>During the 'Love In Lockdown' episodes, it became evident that some contestants had more contact with Bachelor Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert than others.</p>

<p>A source close to Irena told Daily Mail Australia that following her return to the show she was iced out and isolated by the remaining group of women.</p>

<p>'Basically everyone turned their backs on her after her fight with Bella. She didn't really have anyone to talk to,' they said.</p>

<p>The insider claimed Irena leant on intruder Kaitlyn Hoppe for support, but mostly spoke with the show's producers and kept to herself in her room.    </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands that Bella forms a new BFF alliance with intruder Bec Cvilikas, who joins the cast after 'Love In Lockdown' ends.</p>

<p>They were recently spotted together this month on a Father's Day picnic with Bella's mother Kim in Sydney. </p>

<p>Bella told New Idea that the circumstances in the house made it difficult to forge ahead with her friendship with Irena.</p>

<p>'I knew she had a good connection with Locky too. I loved seeing [Irena] come back from her date happy, but seeing her happy made me realise that my connection with Locky may be worse off,' she said. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia had contacted Bella Varelis, Irena Srbinovska and Channel 10 for comment. </p>
