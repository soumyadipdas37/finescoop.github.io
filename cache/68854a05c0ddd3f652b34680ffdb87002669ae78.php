<p>And Vanessa Bryant got close with a new friend on Tuesday as she snuggled up with Win Wilson, the son of Ciara, 34, and Russell Wilson, 31.</p>

<p>The two-month-old boy looked adorable as Vanessa, 38, cradled him and gave him a kiss on his head.</p>

<p>Too cute: Vanessa Bryant, 38, shared an adorable photo of her holding and kissing Ciara and Russell Wilson's two-month-old son Win Wilson on Tuesday</p>

<p>She was dressed in a casual royal blue long sleeve shirt, and her lustrous raven tresses were parted down the middle and styled pin straight.</p>

<p>She flashed a soft smile while kissing Win and highlighted her impeccably made-up face. </p>

<p>Win was dressed up in a white outfit and looked relaxed in Vanessa's arms.</p>

<p>'Sweet Baby, Win,' she wrote, wile adding a blue emoji heart and tagging both of his parents.</p>

<p>New baby: Ciara and Russell welcomed Win on July 23, and announced his birth the following day; shown in February in Beverly Hills</p>

<p>Growing family: It was the second child for the couple, following their three-year-old daughter Sienna, and the third for the singer, who shares her six-year-old son Future with the rapper of the same name</p>

<p>Vanessa has long been friends with Ciara and her Seattle Seahawks quarterback husband, and it was her she turned to when she thanked her friends and fans for their messages on Kobe Bryant's birthday in late August.</p>

<p>Though the Lakers star was born on August 23, the following day was designated Mamba Day in his honor, as the date 8/24 combines the two jersey numbers he wore throughout his career, and it comes only a day after his birthday.  </p>

<p>In it together: Ciara also shared a less cropped version of the photo with her own caption</p>

<p>Family time: Vanessa spent time with Ciara on Mamba Day (8/24), which was designated because it's the day after his birthday and because the date is made up of his two jersey numebers, 8 and 24; shown with Kobe in November 2019</p>

<p>Vanessa shared a cute photo of herself and her youngest daughters Bianka, three, and Capri, one, while Ciara squeezed herself in at the side and beamed.</p>

<p>'It takes a village. Thank you to all my loving family, amazing friends and wonderful fans for your love and support. One day at a time,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Ciara also shared a less cropped version of the photo with her own caption.</p>

<p>'Seeing you and the girls smile makes my heart smile. You’re the toughest mama I know. Seeing you put one foot forward each day is admirable. It ain’t easy, but if I know one thing, Mamba Queen’s capable of it all. Love you V.,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Fancy: While the family's spent time together on Mamba Day, Bianka got a special present from Ciara: a hot pink mini Range Rover</p>

<p>Need for speed: The toddler looked overjoyed as she rode the toy luxury SUV around their property</p>
