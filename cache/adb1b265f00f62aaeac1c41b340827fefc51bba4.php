<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Spencer Matthews has told how he was motivated to quit drinking as he believed his wife Vogue Williams may have left him if he didn't.</p>

<p>The former Made In Chelsea star, 32, explained that he had to put his wife, 34, first and so quit his alcohol habit for good. </p>

<p>Speaking on a Tap Into Success webinar for Nicorette, Spencer said: 'There was a really good chance that my wife would have left me if I carried on drinking the way I was drinking. For the first time in my life I put her first. </p>

<p>Honest: Spencer Matthews, 32, has told how he was motivated to quit drinking as he believed his wife Vogue Williams, 34, may have left him if he didn't</p>

<p>'Usually the old me would have said, "Do you know what? Fine. If you don't like it then get out." I had this really kind of selfish "me before anyone else" streak before.</p>

<p>'When I realised I cared more about her than I do perhaps myself, and that I was making her see less in me, that gave me a real burning desire to be better for her, initially.'</p>

<p>Spencer and Vogue married in Glen Affric, Scotland in June 2018 and the couple are parents to son Theodore, two, and daughter Gigi who was born in July.</p>

<p>The TV star, who has his own line of non-alcoholic drinks, added: 'I feel like we have the most wonderful relationship. I can hear that she respects my opinion and respects me as an individual, and that is worth its weight in gold to me.'</p>

<p>Spencer said: 'When I realised I cared more about her than I do perhaps myself, and that I was making her see less in me, that gave me a real burning desire to be better for her, initially'</p>

<p>It comes after Spencer previously revealed he had to give up alcohol after his drinking habits became 'unsustainable' ahead of his wedding to Vogue. </p>

<p>He told The Times: 'My relationship with alcohol became unsustainable. For people who are going to ask, "Were you an alcoholic?" I suppose the short answer is "Yes."</p>

<p>Admitting that alcohol "disturbed his thought process," he added: 'I would never wake up the following the day feeling like I should be in a body bag, but my functionality, my decision-making, my creativity would be impaired.</p>

<p>'I would be all on or all off. I'd give up for three months and feel incredible. But for some reason I'd always go back to it. </p>

<p>Opening up: Spencer previously insisted he had to give up alcohol after his drinking habits became 'unsustainable' as he prepared to marry Vogue (pictured in November 2019) </p>

<p>'Moderation was impossible for me. People close to me wouldn't have thought that I had a drinking problem because it wasn't evident although towards the very end of my drinking perhaps it became a little bit more of an issue.'</p>

<p>The former Made In Chelsea star previously admitted that become a father to son Theodore made him reassess his priorities and says 'my wife and son are my world.'</p>

<p>Taking to Instagram in November, Spencer said: 'Sobriety is a lifestyle choice I made a few months before becoming a dad.</p>

<p>'In the back of my mind for many years, I had always felt that my relationship with alcohol, although seemingly harmless was unhealthy and somewhat destructive.</p>

<p>'My relationship with alcohol was destructive': Spencer previously discussed his decision to become sober before becoming a dad</p>

<p>'Drinking lead me to make poor decisions and achieving my full potential was slipping away.</p>

<p>'I had abstained from alcohol for lengthy periods at a time but in doing so had made drinking at the end of that period a reward - a pat on the back for my achievement. It was a vicious cycle...'</p>

<p>Spencer said that becoming a dad meant he had to change his ways.</p>

<p>He said: 'I had to change my relationship with alcohol in order to become the man that I knew I could be and that my family would be proud of. Sobriety has opened my mind and unlocked parts of me that I didn’t even realise existed.</p>

<p>He said: 'In the back of my mind, I had always felt that my relationship with alcohol, although seemingly harmless was unhealthy and somewhat destructive' (pictured in 2014)</p>

<p>'I am more ambitious and hard working now than I have ever been and there has been a serious shift in my priorities and what’s important to me.</p>

<p>'My wife and son are my world and being there for them in every way possible is the only thing that matters to me... that and my work...</p>

<p>'Over the last year and a half I have learnt an awful lot about the low and no alcohol sector and what it has to offer and have developed a business to compete in that sector at the highest level.</p>

<p>'If you are sober curious, we are for you. I’m incredibly proud to invite you to follow and join us in discovering a different way to drink. Cheers to that!'</p>
