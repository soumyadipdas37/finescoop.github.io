<p>Ms Agirtan shared memes targeting Indigenous Australians, same-sex parents and international students on her personal page between 2014 and 2018. </p>

<p>In one meme there was a picture of an Indigenous elder with the caption: 'Spends all his money on petrol, doesn't own a car'.</p>

<p>Ms Agirtan posted another comment in Russian saying in her 'ideal world, Aborigines would live the same way minus housing, gasoline, VB and benefits and doctors flying in helicopter reservation'.</p>

<p>She also said same-sex parents were depriving children of their right to know their biological parents.</p>

<p>'I apologise unreservedly for the Facebook posts and memes in question, which I believe have been removed,' she said. </p>
