<p>Despite the speculation, Khloe's focus remains on raising her daughter.</p>

<p>The source added: '[Khloe is only concerned about] her little girl and raising her with her father, having him in her life, figuring out things with Tristan and having a healthy relationship dynamic across the board. </p>

<p>Quality time: Tristan has been spending much of coronavirus lockdown with his two-year-old daughter True and her mother, his off-again on-again ex, Khloe Kardashian  </p>

<p>'[The Kardashian/Jenner family are] supportive and don't judge. [They] just want Khloe to be happy, for them to work things out and set a positive example for True.' </p>

<p>Along with his two-year-old daughter, Tristan also has Prince, three, from an earlier relationship, but he previously admitted to treating his two children very differently.  </p>

<p>Speaking in 2018, he shared: 'With a boy, it's just like, "Hey, man, you'll be alright, man. Stop crying."</p>

<p>'But, it's like, "True, it's gonna be OK, you know? We're right here. daddy's here to feed you. It's me! Look, yeah!" [Raising a girl is] way different, but it's fun, though. It changes you.'</p>
