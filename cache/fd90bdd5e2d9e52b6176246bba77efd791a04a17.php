<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A police officer who starred in a crime-fighting TV documentary has been thrown off the force after admitting to a string of child sex offences.</p>

<p>Lee Tatton, 54, appeared on UKTV's fly-on-the-wall documentary Cops UK: Bodycam Squad as a response officer covering Hanley in 2016. </p>

<p>But the Staffordshire Police officer's career lies in ruins after he pleaded guilty to multiple child sex offences at Birmingham Crown Court on September 1.</p>

<p>At a special case hearing held today, Tatton was dismissed without notice after it was concluded his actions amounted to gross misconduct, the Mirror reported. </p>

<p>Lee Tatton, 54, who appeared on TV documentary Cops UK: Bodycam Squad, was dismissed without notice after pleading guilty to a string of child sex offences on September 1</p>

<p>Staffordshire Police Chief Constable Gareth Morgan said: 'Officers swear an oath to serve the people of Staffordshire with fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality – and the overwhelming majority of officers and staff are loyal to that promise.</p>

<p>'Lee Tatton has fallen far short of the high standards expected by the public and the force and his discreditable conduct has led to his dismissal.'</p>

<p>Response officer Tatton did not attend the hearing and was dismissed in his absence. </p>

<p>In the show, he was nicknamed Tatts and was filmed rescuing people from a flat fire and breaking up a pub brawl in Stoke by camera crews.</p>

<p>Production company Raw Cut shadowed PC Tatton and his fellow officers for several weeks to gain insight into his job. </p>

<p>But he was arrested in December last year while dealing with minor crime for the Northern Resolution Centre by his own force's Operation Safenet team. </p>

<p>At a special case hearing held today, it was concluded that the actions of the Staffordshire police officer amounted to gross misconduct</p>

<p>The dedicated unit is tasked with looking into online child abuse to protect vulnerable young people from perverts and paedophiles.</p>

<p>Tatton was immediately suspended from duty by Staffordshire Police and remains on suspension subject to an internal force hearing.</p>

<p>At court, Tatton pleaded guilty to attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child, and four counts of making an indecent photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child.</p>

<p>Production company Raw Cut spent several weeks in 2016 shadowing paedophile Tatton and his fellow officers on a range of incidents.</p>

<p>He was filmed rescuing people from a flat fire and breaking up a brawl a pub in Stoke - where he was accidentally pepper-sprayed by a colleague. </p>

<p>It was hoped that the crime-fighting programme - on UKTV's Really channel - would give the public an insight into the work of Staffordshire Police.</p>

<p>Tatton, nicknamed Tatts, started in a TV documentary where he was filmed rescuing people from a flat fire and breaking up a brawl a pub in Stoke (pictured at a drugs bust in 2008)</p>

<p>Tatton pleaded guilty to attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child and four counts of making an indecent photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child at Birmingham Crown Court (above)</p>

<p>Speaking when the show premiered, Tatton said: 'It was put to our shift about the camera crews coming out with us and I was happy to volunteer. After a while it became second nature explaining to them what we were dealing with.</p>

<p>'I hope it will give people an insight into what we do and the things we have to deal with at 4am and 5am when most people are tucked up in bed.'</p>

<p>In a statement earlier this month, Assistant Chief Constable Scott Green said: 'Tatton's actions are unacceptable and have caused harm and distress to the very people we should be protecting and keeping safe.</p>

<p>'His actions fell well below the high standards that the public and the force demands and expects of police officers.'</p>

<p>Tatton will be sentenced on November 2 this year.</p>
