<p>Agostino was a getaway driver for teenage boys who broke into an Italian restaurant</p>

<p>Her first foray into a life of crime came in 2018, when she became involved in a series of burglaries in Sydney's north shore.</p>

<p>The then 22-year-old became getaway driver for teenage boys who robbed an Italian restaurant and tried to break into a fruit shop and cafe.</p>

<p>The crew donned black masks and used chisels to break into the Pound of Pizza restaurant at Killarney Heights on November 6. Their efforts were caught on CCTV. </p>

<p>On the same day, Agostino was also caught using a stolen credit card to buy $11.55 worth of fast food from McDonald's in Brookvale.</p>

<p>The card had been reported stolen from the Stanley Street Cafe at St Ives earlier that day.</p>

<p>She was also convicted of stealing a $90 jacket from Supre, and possessing a knife and drugs - meth and diazepam - inside Target in Blacktown's Westpoint Shopping Centre.</p>

<p>Agostino was released on bail earlier this year as she awaited an appeal on August 26 over the severity of her sentence. </p>

<p>The appeal was subsequently thrown out when she failed to show up to her court appearance in July.</p>

<p>She was arrested on September 5 after an arrest warrant was issued.</p>

<p>Agostino did end up getting her appeal heard and she was re-sentenced in the NSw District Court, news.com.au reported.</p>

<p>Her lawyer Pawel Kulisiewicz told the court 'they were always going to get court' and dismissed her offending as 'amateur hour'. </p>

<p>Judge Dina Yehia agreed to cut her prison time in half.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old was handed a 12-month sentence with a six-month non-parole period, meaning will be eligible for release from Sydney's Silverwater jail in October on time served.  </p>
