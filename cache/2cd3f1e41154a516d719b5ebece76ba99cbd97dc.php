<p>After a short journey through the caves, one of the less seasoned explorers decided to turn back, taking his friends with him after he started to panic, SudOuest reports.   </p>

<p>But the group's leader decided to continue on his own and went further into the underground tunnels.</p>

<p>By 8.30am on Wednesday, he still hadn't resurfaced with two of his friends waiting for him in the quarry car park overnight. </p>

<p>They alerted the emergency services who sent police, fire fighters and dogs to try to find the missing caver.</p>

<p>A group of ten cavers from Bordeaux went illegally exploring in the quarries of Cénac on Tuesday night (pictured: a quarry entrance in Cénac)</p>

<p>They searched all morning but were unable to find the caver in the extensive underground quarries.</p>

<p>He finally resurfaced in a resident's back garden after 12 hours of navigating the tunnels.</p>

<p>The explorer suffered an injured ankle but was relieved to have escaped the treacherous situation.</p>

<p>The mayor of Cénac reaffirmed: 'All access to quarries are prohibited by municipal decree posted at each entrance, marked with a ribbon that cannot be ignored. </p>

<p>'The quarries are very dangerous, and have 56 kilometers of galleries over six floors. </p>

<p>'It could have been dramatic in the event of a collapse.'</p>
