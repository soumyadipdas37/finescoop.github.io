<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tony Ferguson is on the comeback trail following his defeat by Justin Gaethje but he will not face Dustin Poirier, according to UFC supremo Dana White.</p>

<p>The lightweight was on the receiving end of a brutal beating from Gaethje at UFC 249 in Florida back in May.</p>

<p>Both Ferguson and Poirier have been crowned interim lightweight champions, but neither have been able to move to the next level and become undisputed king of the 155 pounders.</p>

<p>It looked as though the pair were set to meet in the octagon at UFC 254 on October 24 but White has now ruled that out.</p>

<p>'No, we're not even trying to salvage it,' White told MMA Junkie. </p>

<p>'We're getting another fight. It'll happen (with a different opponent for Ferguson).' </p>

<p>Lightweight Ferguson will not face Dustin Poirier, according to UFC supremo Dana White</p>

<p>Ferguson is set to make his UFC return next month as he looks to get his title bid back on track after Gaethje's fifth-round stoppage win set up a showdown against Khabib Nurmagomedov for the lightweight title.</p>

<p>Poirier was submitted by Khabib in Abu Dhabi in 2019 but overcame Dan Hooker this summer.  </p>

<p>Khabib's match-up with Gaethje tops the bill of the event in just over a month's time but it is unknown who Ferguson will meet.</p>

<p>Poirier was submitted by Khabib in Abu Dhabi last year but overcame Dan Hooker this summer </p>
