<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Queensland mother has pleaded guilty to torturing her three young children and subjecting them to 'excruciating' violence over a seven-month period.</p>

<p>The Moreton Bay woman, who can't be named for legal reasons, put her children through 'gratuitous inflictions of violence and pain' at her home between July 2017 and February 2018.</p>

<p>The three children, who are aged 10 or under, were repeatedly hit with spoons and belts by their mother, or each other if she demanded it.</p>

<p>Brisbane District Court heard the children were starved for more than a week at a time and subject to a horrific beating called 'The Wall'.</p>

<p>The punishment involved the children standing facing a wall with their arms stretched above their heads while being beaten with various objects for hours.</p>

<p>Crown prosecutor Toby Corsbie told the court the oldest son missed school in February due to injuries sustained at home, with authorities notified on his return to class.</p>

<p>'Ultimately, he had physical violence inflicted on every surface of his body,' he said, as reported by NCA NewsWire.</p>

<p>Mr Corsbie said the woman had tried to keep her family's home life a secret from authorities.</p>

<p>'One of the children had told police she had been told not to speak to them,' he said.</p>

<p>The mother's lawyer Patrick Wilson told the court her actions were influenced by her partner and previous abusive relationships.</p>

<p>'She has suffered at the hands of these men in her relationships... the children observed violence directed towards her by the partner,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Wilson said the mother is doing parenting courses and drug and alcohol counselling.</p>

<p>The mother was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Her partner is awaiting trial for his alleged role in beating the children.</p>
