<p>Designing History, by Michael S. Smith (Rizzoli, £40)</p>

<p>When Michael Smith renovated the Obama White House, his brief was to create an interior suitable for a political office and a family home. </p>

<p>In the Yellow Oval Room, for example — pictured with Barack and Michelle entertaining then Italian premier Matteo Renzi and wife Agnese — he kept the wall colour, chosen by Jackie Kennedy, but included the metal toys (see left) as a nod to the Obamas' playful side. </p>

<p>With a foreword from Michelle, this fascinating book is the ultimate look through the keyhole.</p>
