<p>After shifting a staggering one million mince pies in September 2019 alone, Coles is hoping to smash last year's sales record by getting in early with shoppers.</p>

<p>Coles Bakery Manager Rosie Anderson said the release date - almost four months ahead of Christmas Day - was brought forward to bring hope to coronavirus-weary customers as the pandemic rolls on.</p>

<p>'We've been working hard to bring a timely festive bakery collection to stores early to help raise the spirits of those Australians who need it most,' Ms Anderson told Nine News.</p>

<p>And Coles aren't the only iconic Australian brand getting into the festive spirit a little earlier than usual.</p>

<p>On August 27, hardware giant Bunnings rolled out a collection of Christmas lights to brighten the mood amid COVID-19.</p>

<p>The range - exclusively available in select stores - includes pink reindeer, fibre optic trees and giant Nutcracker soldiers that stand over a metre high.</p>

<p>An employee from the Craigieburn outlet, 25km from Melbourne CBD, announced the launch with a Facebook photo that's gone viral since it was posted on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>'After the year we've had, bushfires and a pandemic (and our metro Melbourne folk still getting through), looking forward to seeing lots of seasonal lighting,' she wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>Christmas come early: Bunnings has launched a collection of Christmas decorations, exclusively available in select stores, to brighten the mood amid COVID-19</p>

<p>It's not clear which other stores are stocking the festive collection, which does not appear on the brand's website because they are promotional items.</p>

<p>On social media, the excitement was evident.</p>

<p>'Eekkk! That makes me happy! Especially as we are hosting family Christmas this year and I wanted to get a head start!! Thank you!' one person said. </p>

<p>Another added: 'We need something cheerful, that's for sure! I think I need to get into the festive spirit this year.'</p>

<p>But some felt the launch was premature, even against the backdrop of the pandemic.</p>

<p>'Gosh Christmas stuff already, it's not even September yet,' one woman said.</p>

<p>A second said: 'Christmas decs (sic) already.. Oh my god, yes I love Christmas but why can't they wait until October at least?'</p>

<p>A third was more outspoken in her criticism.</p>

<p>'No!!! Halloween needs to come first. Hate b****y Christmas. Worst time of year,' she said.</p>

<p>'People turn into monsters and become so greedy - completely missing the whole point. Anyway, that's my whinge.'</p>
