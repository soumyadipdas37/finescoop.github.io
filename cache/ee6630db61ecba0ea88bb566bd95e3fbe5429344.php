<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lewis Hamilton has taken to social media to seemingly distance himself from his claims that he was being picked on by the FIA after being hit with two five-second penalties at the Russian Grand Prix.</p>

<p>Hamilton was raging when he learnt of the sanctions mid-race - he was going for his 91st career victory, which would have equalled Michael Schumacher's record.</p>

<p>He asked his race engineer 'what happened, what happened?' and once it was explained why he got the penalty he said: 'Bull****, where is that in the rule book?' and after the race, he said that race officials are 'trying to stop me'.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton complained about the officials after the Russian Grand Prix on Sunday</p>

<p>But now, on social media, Hamilton has taken a more considered tone on what happened</p>

<p>But taking to Instagram on Tuesday, Hamilton offered a more considered tone, saying: 'I may not always get it right in the face of adversity.</p>

<p>'I may not always react the way you want me to when tensions are high but I am only human after all and I am passionate about what I do. </p>

<p>'I'm learning and growing every day and I'll take my lessons and keep fighting on to the next one. Thank you to those who continue to support and are right there fighting with me. Still we rise!' </p>

<p>Hamilton had been under investigation before the race had even begun after he did two practice starts outside of the designated zone. </p>

<p>After the race Hamilton said: 'I'm pretty sure nobody has got two five second penalties for something so ridiculous before. I wouldn't put anyone in danger. I've done this at a million tracks over the years and never been questioned on it, but it is what it is.'</p>

<p>When questioned whether the penalty points were excessive he added: 'Of course it is. But it is to be expected. </p>

<p>'They are trying to stop me aren't they? But it's okay I just need to keep my head down and stay focused and we will see what happens.' </p>

<p>Race director Michael Masi spoke out after the six-time world champion, who finished third in the race, complained that officials picked on him.</p>

<p>Sunday's race director Michael Masi insisted there were no special rules for Hamilton </p>

<p>Hamilton was under investigation before the start for two practice start infringements</p>

<p>Masi said: ‘If Lewis wants to raise something, as I have said to him before, the door is always open. </p>

<p>'I am more than happy to discuss anything. As the FIA, we are the sporting regulator to administer the regulations. We have the stewards as an independent judiciary to adjudicate those.</p>

<p>‘There was an infringement and it doesn’t matter if it was Lewis or any one of the other 19 drivers.</p>

<p>‘If a breach of the regulations occurred, the stewards will consider it on its merits.’</p>
