<p>New beau: Katie Price has revealed her son Harvey wants Carl Woods to be his dad. The glamour model, 42, has been dating former Love Island star Carl for three months</p>

<p>In an Instagram video shared on Sunday, Katie asked 'Harv, what do you want mummy and Carl to do?' to which the teenager responded: 'Be with mummy and Harvey and Carl... your daddy.'</p>

<p>Katie confirmed: 'You want Carl to be your what?' as her son responded, 'Harvey's daddy.'</p>

<p>As Katie asked Harvey 'Do you? Do you love Carl that much?' he replied, 'Yes mum.'</p>

<p>As she added, 'You're so cute,' Katie says, Harvey went, 'I know, tell me about it.'   </p>

<p>Son: Harvey, 18, who has multiple disabilities including blindness, Prader-Willi syndrome and ADHA, does not have a relationship with his biological father, Dwight Yorke</p>

<p>Katie dated Harvey's biological father Dwight, 48, from 2000-2001, and has criticised the footballer for his alleged lack of contact with Harvey.</p>

<p>In her 2016 book Reborn, the mother-of-five insisted Dwight was unwilling to accept the limitations of his son's disabilities. </p>

<p>Harvey has the rare genetic disorder Prader-Willi Syndrome, among other health complications including being blind due to Septo-optic dysplasia, while he is also autistic, has an underactive thyroid and diabetes.  </p>

<p>Due to Harvey's complex needs, he lives in residential care, but has been home with Katie amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>In October 2019, Katie also claimed it has been 13 years since Dwight had seen Harvey, and in an emotional video two months later, she pleaded for the former footballer to see his son.</p>

<p>When asked if Dwight had been in touch for his son's birthday, : 'No, it's like he has no feelings for Harvey whatsoever.</p>

<p>'The only thing that upsets me is that Harvey has a half-brother out there and he's never met him.</p>

<p>She added that it was 'never too late' and that the door was 'always open' for Dwight to come back into his son's life. </p>

<p>Katie is also mother to son Junior, 15, and daughter Princess, 13, with ex-husband Peter Andre and son Jett, six, and daughter Bunny, five, with estranged husband Kieran Hayler. </p>

<p>The glamour model has a chequered love life, but seems completely smitten with new boyfriend Carl, who has been caring for her after she broke both her feet on holiday. </p>

<p>Last week, Katie slammed cruel social media users for accusing her of 'sleeping around' behind Carl's back.</p>

<p>Not mincing her words, the I'm A Celeb star said: 'I’ve heard every bit of abuse, insults and hurtful s**g naming calling under the sun from people who havent met me nor <?php echo e('@'); ?>carljwoods, I’m sick of small minded trolls trying to put us down.</p>

<p>'I’m not a s<strong>g I NEVER slept around being called a s</strong>g is infuriating and cruel. There isn’t many guys that would be able to handle the life changing injuries I have. (sic)'</p>

<p>Estranged: Katie shares Harvey with ex Dwight Yorke, they had split by the time she gave birth. The model has since criticised the sportsman for his treatment of their son</p>
