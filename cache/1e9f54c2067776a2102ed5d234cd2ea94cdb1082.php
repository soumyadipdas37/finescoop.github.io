<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Roman Fury, brother of heavyweight champion Tyson, has become a professional boxer, making him the ninth person to turn pro in the Gypsy King's family.</p>

<p>WBC champion Fury has been training alongside his 23-year-old brother during lockdown and, despite having no amateur background in the sport, Roman has turned professional. </p>

<p>Roman had been looking to take a different path to his champion brother, but has taken up boxing after spending months training with Tyson. </p>

<p>Tyson Fury's brother Roman (centre) is to lace up his gloves and turn professional</p>

<p>The 23-year-old (2L) has been training with Tyson in lockdown and is ready to go professional</p>

<p>'Just signing him [Roman] up now, he's 23-years-old, he's an aspiring cruiserweight champion of the future,' Tyson told iFL TV. </p>

<p>'Southpaw, tall, 6ft 2ins, in good shape. We're gonna try and get him – when the boxing starts again – maybe four or five fights within the boxing season and keep him busy for the next couple of years.</p>

<p>'He's learning on the job, like Canelo was. Gonna get him to about 20-0 before we move him up.</p>

<p>Roman's brother Tommy is a high-profile Fury having been a star on hit TV show Love Island</p>

<p>Peter Fury (uncle) </p>

<p>'He's 23, nearly 24. Hasn't had any amateur fights, but he's been around the game a long time so born and bred into it.</p>

<p>'We'll get him a few fights and see how he goes on. Sugar Hill's teaching him that Kronk style, he's learning.'</p>

<p>Of the Fury clan, brother Tommy and cousin Hughie are the high-profile relatives of Tyson. Tommy, 21, is 3-0 in his light heavyweight career but earned fame as a Love Island star.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hughie has been around the blocks and came close to winning the WBO heavyweight championship when he lost on points to Joseph Parker in 2017.</p>

<p>'When lockdown happened I had nothing else to do,' Roman said. 'I had no work on, as many people didn't, and I had the opportunity to go and train.</p>

<p>'So I did it, got fit, lost a bit of weight and I just fell in love with it. I thought, 'I've always wanted to do it, so why not now?'</p>

<p>'So I've put everything on hold and I'm gonna give it my best and see how we go…It's like an experiment, I wanna see how far I can go.</p>

<p>'Just started it now at 23, but it's all about self-belief and I do have a lot of that.'</p>
