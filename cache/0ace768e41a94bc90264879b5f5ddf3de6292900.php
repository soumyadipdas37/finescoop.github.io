<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Queensland could move to reopen its border with NSW far sooner than expected as the chief health officer considers slashing the target coronavirus limit in half.  </p>

<p>Dr Jeannette Young is reportedly considering a rule change that will require NSW to go just 14 days, rather than the current 28 days, without community transmission of COVID-19 before Queensland reopens the border.</p>

<p>She will reportedly mull the change after lobbying from Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind, Nine News reports.</p>

<p>Dr Young says she won't rush 'a critical decision' when the border restrictions are reviewed at the end of the month.</p>

<p>'We're still concerned that in the past four weeks there have been 14 cases in NSW of which the cause of transmission is unknown,' she told AAP in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'For a lot of people at home, it might seem like the pandemic is almost over but in reality, Monday was a record day worldwide for COVID-19 cases.</p>

<p>'We've all done so well to protect Queensland and we can't let our hard work and sacrifices go to waste by rushing a critical decision.'</p>

<p>The state's Labor government has been under sustained pressure from federal, interstate and local political rivals to ease border restrictions since the pandemic began.</p>

<p>A relaxation of the criteria could allow Queensland to reopen to NSW and the ACT much quicker than previously thought, and potentially in time for Christmas.</p>

<p>It could also make it easier for the federal government to get its proposed national hotspot system up and running.</p>

<p>Under the current rules Queensland's border is closed to visitors from NSW unless they live in a border region or have an exemption on economic or compassionate grounds.</p>

<p>All visitors from NSW, the ACT and Victoria have to go into mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival in Queensland.</p>

<p>The state has no restrictions on visitors from South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania or the Northern Territory</p>
