<p>The 39-year-old Fighter hitmaker admits she can be 'hypercritical' towards herself and she has always tried to 'push' herself to be the best she can be.</p>

<p>'Be kind to yourself. We are all walking on the path of inner research, it is our work as human beings and each one follows a different path, so it makes no sense to make comparisons,' the songbird told L'Officiel Italia. </p>

<p>Fine as she is: Christina Aguilera, 39, told L'Officiel Italia she suffers from anxiety about her image but has given up on trying to be 'perfect': 'I'm not going on a diet, get over it'</p>

<p>'Swim in your lane. "If you waste time looking over your shoulder to see what others are doing, you lose sight of it," is the best advice I've ever been given. </p>

<p>'Let's try to listen to the things that resonate within us. It takes time to get over the noise and really feel yourself.'</p>

<p>The star, who found fame in 1999 with Genie In A Bottle, said people have to be kind to themselves.</p>

<p>Solid advice: 'Let us allow ourselves to be what we are. I have often clashed with my anxieties and with being hypercritical towards myself, but I have never stopped looking for new ways to push myself further, without neglecting to protect myself,' said Aguilera; on the right she is seen in year 2000</p>

<p>'Let us allow ourselves to be what we are,' noted the performer.</p>

<p>'I have often clashed with my anxieties and with being hypercritical towards myself, but I have never stopped looking for new ways to push myself further, without neglecting to protect myself.'</p>

<p>And the 39-year-old singer insists people need to 'get over' the fact she won't be going on a diet as she is 'unique' and 'pure', even though the wider world and society may not deem her to be 'pretty or perfect'.</p>

<p>On fore: The siren has been sharing pinup photos this summer; here she is seen in a red dress</p>

<p>Speaking to L'Officiel Italia 2020's Fashion Issue, she added: 'I'm not going on a diet, get over it ... </p>

<p>'Each of us is an individual and people judge you based on your differences, on what makes you unique. </p>

<p>'You have to accept that beauty and to hell with everything else,' said the partner of Matthew Rutler with whom she has Summer. </p>

<p>'True beauty for me is the ability to know you and project what you are in an unmistakable light. Not always pretty, far from perfect, but pure.'</p>

<p>A family bond: With beau Matthew Rutler, her son Max with Jordan Bratman and the child Christina and Matthew had together, Summer Rain Rutler in October 2019</p>
