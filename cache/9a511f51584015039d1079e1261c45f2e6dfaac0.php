<p>Difficult: Sam Faiers has admitted she 'didn't want to leave the house' during her two-year struggle with cystic acne</p>

<p>She told the magazine: 'I never wanted to leave the house. I had to put on thick foundation and when I was posing I was like ''I don't want to show this side of my face.'' </p>

<p>'Some days I didn't even want to go out. When I was talking to people I thought they were all looking at my skin.</p>

<p>Sam added that she's overcome her skin struggles with the help of collagen supplements and she's finally comfortable with her complexion ahead of her 30th birthday later this year.</p>

<p>Difficult: The former TOWIE star said her confidence took a huge hit after her acne flared up when she began breastfeeding her daughter Rosie two years ago</p>

<p>Love the skin your in: Last month Sam showed her bare-faced complexion before and after having treatment on her skin</p>

<p>She added: 'You know what, my skin to me is now perfect. I don't have to slap on the foundation. I've tried everything but I've finally found what works for me.'</p>

<p>Last month Sam spoke about her struggles with cystic acne for the first time as she took to Instagram to share a snap of her bad flare-up.</p>

<p>In a lengthy post, Sam wrote: 'I've been really nervous about posting this picture. The last few years I've been very quiet about the fact that I've been suffering with adult acne - in my case, it was hormonal. </p>

<p>'After breastfeeding Rosie, my skin just broke out and I couldn't get it under control. I tried absolutely everything. It felt like the more I was doing to stop it, the worse it became.</p>

<p>Transformed: The Mummy Diaries has credited collagen supplements with helping to improve her skin's condition</p>

<p>'I've been so embarrassed about it and have used filters on Instagram to try and hide it. I would always edit and smooth my skin in pictures and I definitely wouldn't leave the house without makeup.'</p>

<p>Searching for treatment, Sam said she started to use collagen skincare products for their anti-ageing qualities but 'soon noticed a dramatic reduction in breakouts along with my skin becoming firmer, lines reducing and my skin feeling more hydrated'.</p>

<p>The Mummy Diaries star revealed it prompted her to create her own skincare brand, Revive Collagen, which launches on Friday.</p>

<p>Happy: Sam said she's finally happy with her skin after finding the perfect treatment (pictured with partner Paul Knightley and their children Paul Jnr, four, and Rosie, two)</p>
