<p>Lilypad is among Sydney's most exclusive and private boutique rentals with one night stay costing $1,450 per night</p>

<p>The luxury accommodation is 100 per cent solar powered and sleeps two guests in one of Sydney's premier locations</p>

<p>It boasts a double bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, private boat for exploring the coastline, a wine cellar stocked with Veuve Clicquot Champagne and personal chef.</p>

<p>A night's stay in the villa, which is 100 per cent solar-powered, starts from $1,450, with the price including other perks such as a private concierge, onboard breakfast items supplied by nearby restaurant Boat House Palm Beach and use of paddleboards, fishing rods and a floating day bed.</p>
