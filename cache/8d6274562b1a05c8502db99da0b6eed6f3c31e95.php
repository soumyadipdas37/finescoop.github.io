<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mikel Arteta praised Arsenal's improvement in the second-half of their 3-1 defeat by Liverpool on Monday night - but rued a crucial miss by Alexandre Lacazette to level the match at 2-2. </p>

<p>The Gunners were dominated by the Premier League champions in the first-half but took a shock lead through Lacazette, who finished off a superb team move by finishing past Alisson.</p>

<p>Liverpool ran out deserved winners thanks to goals from Sadio Mane, Andy Robertson and substitute Diogo Jota - though Arteta pointed out Lacazette's saved one-on-one just before the Reds' third goal was a crucial moment in the match. </p>

<p>Alex Lacazette missed a crucial one-on-one in Arsenal's 3-1 defeat by Liverpool on Monday</p>

<p>With Arsenal losing 2-1 at the time, Mikel Arteta (above) described the miss as a major moment</p>

<p>Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Arteta said: 'In the second half we corrected a few things, we were much better. </p>

<p>'We had some problems still with the ball and we had the best chance in the game and when it comes to Anfield you're not going to get 10 chances.</p>

<p>'When you get through one against one against the keeper, you have to score if you want to get something out of the game.'</p>

<p>Lacazette (far left) had earlier given Arsenal a shock lead in the first-half at Anfield</p>

<p>Lacazette was visibly upset after his second-half miss when he was substituted late on</p>

<p>Sky pundit Roy Keane also critiqued Lacazette's poor second-half finish and described it as a major moment in the game for Arsenal. </p>

<p>The French striker was played through on goal thanks to an incisive ball from substitute Dani Ceballos but Alisson stood tall and managed to pull off the save. </p>

<p>Keane said: ‘He could have taken it through, had a better touch. He should have put the ball into the back of the net, get into good habits. </p>

<p>‘They are huge opportunities that you have to take. It was the middle of the goal. </p>

<p>Sky Sports pundit Roy Keane also admitted Lacazette needed to score that crucial chance</p>

<p>‘We have to credit the goalkeeper for standing up but you don’t get many of those opportunities against Liverpool and you have to take them.’ </p>

<p>While Arteta noticed the improvements from his side after the half-time break, the Spanish coach was also full of praise for Jurgen Klopp's side and described how well the project under the German coach has worked for them.</p>

<p>He added: 'It's a tough place to come for anybody in the world. They (Liverpool) set incredible standards, they dominate every aspect of the game.</p>

<p>'Taking the lead put us in a really strong position to believe more that we could get something out of the game.' </p>
