<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Heir to the Spanish throne Princess Leonor donned a facemask and had her temperature checked as her father King Felipe dropped her off at school on the first day back after summer.  </p>

<p>The royal, 52, accompanied his teenage daughter, 14, on the school run for the start of the new year at Madrid's Santa Maria de los Rosales' School.</p>

<p>Both appeared relaxed as they arrived, before Princess Leonor, who is heir to the throne, stepped out of the vehicle and was temperature checked by a member of staff. </p>

<p>It comes days after Spain became the first country in Western Europe to register 500,000 coronavirus infections, with a second surge in cases that coincided with schools reopening. </p>

<p>Spanish Princess Leonor, 14, donned a facemask as she arrived at school in Madrid for her first day back amid the Covid-19 crisis </p>

<p>The youngster swept her hair into a tidy plait and wore a facemask for her return to school, before being temperature checked at the school gate</p>

<p>It is believed that Princess Leonor is starting of fourth year of secondary education, while her younger sister Princess Sofia is beginning her second year at the school.</p>

<p>The youngster, who was seated in the back of the car with elder sister Princess Leonor and King Felipe, badly hurt her leg during the summer period. </p>

<p>King Felipe appeared typically dapper in a suit and tie for the outing, while Princess Leonor swept her hair into a tidy plait for the return to school.</p>

<p>It has been a challenging summer for the Spanish royal family, after runaway former King Juan Carlos caused shockwaves around the country in August by announcing he was leaving his homeland.</p>

<p>King Felipe, 52, accompanied his daughter, who is heir to the throne, on the school run, with the duo wearing masks in the car for the journey</p>

<p>Princess Leonor has now been deemed by some as a saviour of the monarchy, with  The Times writing: 'Attention must turn to the future if the Bourbon monarchy is to survive.</p>

<p>'It is a responsibility that rests of the shoulders of Leonor, and the reigning king, Felipe VI, knows that, as he introduces her to the country while trying to modernise the monarchy.' </p>

<p>The publication went on to say the young princesses are 'the future for a modernised monarchy.'</p>

<p>'Leonor is still very young, but modern, well-educated and a woman — which is important as the feminist movement grows in Spain,' a palace source reportedly said. 'She is a great asset.' </p>

<p>While Princess Leonor joined her father in the front seat, her sister Princess Sofia, 13, could be seen waving from the back seat </p>

<p>The father-daughter duo appeared relaxed as they arrived for the first day of term back amid the coronavirus pandemic </p>

<p>Princess Leonor, who is heir to the throne of Spain, donned a medical grade face mask as she was driven to school by her father</p>

<p>The teenager offered a wave to cameras as she was driven through the school gates to make her return </p>

<p>Leonor made her public-speaking debut at at awards ceremony in Barcelona last November, where she gave comments in Spanish, Catalan, English and Arabic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she and  Sofía read from Don Quixote on World Book Day in April, and addressed the nation in a video amid the coronaviurs pandemic. </p>

<p>Her return to school comes as Spain struggles to control a recent spike in infections amid schools reopening across the country.</p>

<p>Recent infections have been more common among younger people who often develop no symptoms thanks to their stronger immune systems, and the death rate remains far below the March-April peak when daily fatalities routinely exceeded 800.</p>

<p>The youngster swept her blonde hair into a tidy plait for the occasion, and waved to waiting cameras while making her way into school in Madrid </p>

<p>Despite the unwanted milestone, unlike then, hospitals have enough beds to treat Covid-19 patients.</p>

<p>After a first wave in spring that ravaged Spain's elderly population and overwhelmed the hospital system, authorities brought the outbreak under control with the help of one of the world's toughest lockdowns.</p>

<p>But as restrictions on movement were lifted and mass testing began in late June, infections rose from a few hundred a day to a new peak of over 10,000 around 10 days ago, outstripping other hard-hit nations such as France, Britain and Italy.</p>

<p>The overall mortality rate since the pandemic first struck is around 6% in Spain, lower than in Italy, Britain and France.</p>

<p>After being temperature checked, the youngster was beckoned by a teacher who  directed her where to go next</p>

<p>Other pupils quickly joined the queue behind Princess Leonor as she was directed into school for the first day of teaching after the summer holidays </p>
