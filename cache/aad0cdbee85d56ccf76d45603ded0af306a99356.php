<p>Endellion's brother, John Lycett Green, earlier told his friends: 'My sister Endellion is alive, safe and well.</p>

<p>'Thank you all for the support and love you showed for Delli and her family.</p>

<p>‘Sorry to all of you that, like us, were grieving for the wonder that is Delli. We were told a body was found and was her. It was not, and Delli was found last night.’</p>

<p>The body was found in the ornamental lake in front of Kensington Palace, where Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge (pictured last month) reside with their children</p>

<p>He added: ‘RIP the soul that was found in Kensington Round Pond on Saturday morning.’</p>

<p>A friend of the family told the Daily Mail: 'Delli went through a bad patch, but it’s a huge relief to everyone that she is safe and well. It’s been a traumatic week.’</p>

<p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as unexplained at this time, but is not thought to be suspicious. </p>

<p>'Inquiries are ongoing.’ </p>
