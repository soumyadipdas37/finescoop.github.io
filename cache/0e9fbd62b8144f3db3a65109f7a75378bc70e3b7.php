<p>Schroeder's shopping trip comes just days after Tamron Hall hit back at allegations she 'went rogue' while interviewing the fired reality star last week. </p>

<p>The 50-year-old host of The Tamron Hall Show spoke about claims Schroeder wasn't happy with the interview during Tuesday's episode. </p>

<p>'She knew the subject matter. She knew what I was going to ask her,' said Hall of her exchange with Schroeder. </p>

<p>Cheers! After leaving the store empty-handed, the couple enjoyed lunch together with a view of the Santa Monica Pier</p>

<p>'The other day I was told that there was a report that Stassi felt "unprepared" and that it was "awkward." Even that I had gone rogue - whatever that means,' began Tamron, referring to an UsWeekly article in which a source claimed Schroeder 'felt like she was put on the spot.'  </p>

<p>Hall continued: 'Let me just be open because I'm expecting everybody who's participating in this show today, I want them to be open, so I have to do the same. It's why I wanted this show to be honest with you.</p>

<p>'So I'm going to take you behind-the-scenes of TV. Now, I don't tell people the specific questions I'm going to ask them. How they answer, that's up to them. But the topic and everything that we discussed, Stassi knew.'</p>

<p>No way: Tamron Hall recently hit back at allegations she 'went rogue' while interviewing fired Vanderpump Rules star Stassi last week</p>

<p>The talk show host also claimed Schroeder's team asked her not to raise the former reality TV star's controversial comments on the #MeToo movement, a request with which Hall says she complied.</p>

<p>'It hit me to my gut that I didn't ask her,' said Hall. 'Given that she was five months pregnant, the issue of race was hard enough for her and for me and it was a lot to unpack, including that Nazi comment, so I said we were not going to go down that road but we would have this difficult conversation that we all should have to provide a better platform for our children.'</p>

<p>However Stassi then raised the topic of her own accord, telling Tamron, 'I look back at that podcast and I'm so embarrassed that I even had those thoughts, much less put it out there.'</p>

<p>Getting grilled: Schroeder sat down for her first interview since her Vanderpump Rules firing for the Tamron Hall Show last week</p>

<p>Schroeder, whose past racially insensitive actions resurfaced last summer leading to her firing, admitted she 'was a Karen' after Hall asked her about why she reported her black co-star Faith Stowers to the police in 2018 for a crime she did not commit.</p>

<p>Hall said she was 'shocked' at her 'level of ignorance as it relates to race,' specifically because she is from New Orleans and lives in Los Angeles, both of which are highly populated, diverse cities.  </p>

<p>The pair's interview occurred last Thursday, marking Schroeder's first TV appearance since being fired from Vanderpump Rules in June. </p>

<p>Grilled: On Thursday's broadcast, Tamron questioned her judgment on making insensitive jokes about Jewish people in addition to the ones directed toward the black community</p>
