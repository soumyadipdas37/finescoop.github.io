<p>Together: Arizona married Boniface three years ago, welcoming a daughter with him at the end of 2018</p>

<p>Speaking to Town and Country magazine recently, the beauty reflected on being a young parent. </p>

<p>She said: 'I don’t know what it’s like to be a 20-year-old who didn’t have a child. I loved having Nikko.</p>

<p>'He was like a doll. I was a child myself and it was an "ignorance is bliss" situation.'</p>

<p>Arizona candidly admitted her reasoning for marriage being particularly meaningful to her, given that Nikko 'doesn't have a relationship' with her ex-fiancé Manuel.</p>

<p>Happy: She toted a miniature leather Lulu Guinness handbag in a bright yellow hue over her shoulder which featured a sweet tan keyring</p>

<p>She said: 'It meant a lot to me to get married. Especially because I already had a child who doesn’t have a relationship with his dad.' </p>

<p>Touching on how she burnt herself out by working and parenting in the early days, she told: 'By the time Nikko was three, I was totally exhausted.'</p>

<p>Arizona battled on because she feared that if she took time off her career would disappear - which caused her massive amounts of stress that she 'was under, every single day, for years'.</p>

<p>She added: 'I probably needed to take some time off, but I was stuck in this fear cycle.</p>
