<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Suarez has revealed he is excited to be part of the Atletico Madrid squad after speaking for the first time since his ¬£5.5million move from Barcelona.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan striker trained with his new team-mates for the first time on Friday¬† after saying an emotional farewell to the Catalan giants in a press conference the day before.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old striker - who has signed a two-year deal at Atletico - ended his Barcelona career as the club's third-highest goalscorer of all time, netting 198 goals in 283 appearances.¬†</p>

<p>Luis Suarez has revealed he is excited to be at Atletico Madrid after his move from Barcelona</p>

<p>The Uruguayan striker was speaking for the first time since officially sealing a ¬£5.5m move</p>

<p>Dear Atl√©ticos üíå <?php echo e('@'); ?>luissuarez9 #Su√°rezRojiblanco</p>

<p>A post shared by  AtleÃÅtico de Madrid (<?php echo e('@'); ?>atleticodemadrid) on Sep 26, 2020 at 1:49am PDT</p>

<p>But speaking on Atletico's official Instagram account, Suarez revealed his excitement at the new challenge in front of him, saying: 'Hello Atletico fans. I'm already here wearing my new shirt.</p>

<p>'I'm really excited to play and have fun on the pitch. Thanks a lot for the support and all your messages.</p>

<p>'Now it's time to enjoy and achieve important things this season.'¬†</p>

<p>The striker looked like he was heading to Juventus and even took an Italian language test in Perugia in order to get residency ahead of a proposed move to the Serie A champions.</p>

<p>And the 33-year-old striker said he is excited to be forming part of Diego Simeone's squad</p>

<p>But the former Barcelona man has completed a ¬£5.5million to Diego Simeone's side after being told by new Catalans boss Ronald Koeman he was no longer required at the Camp Nou.</p>

<p>The announcement of the move saw Lionel Messi fire another shot at Barcelona as the Argentine superstar bid an emotional farewell to his team-mate and best friend.</p>

<p>Messi was embroiled in a transfer saga with the Catalan club this summer, and while he eventually waved the white flag he launched a fresh attack on the club.</p>

<p>'I was already getting the idea but today I entered the locker room and the card really fell,' he wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>'How difficult it is going to be not to continue sharing the day to day with you, both on the courts and outside.</p>

<p>Suarez trained for the first time with his new Atletico Madrid team-mates on Friday</p>

<p>That was after he bid an emotional farewell to Barcelona in a press conference the day before</p>

<p>'It will be strange to see you with another shirt and much more to face you. You are one of the most important players in the club's history, achieving important things both as a group and individually.</p>

<p>'And not to get kicked out like they did. But the truth is that at this point nothing surprises me.'</p>

<p>Despite Barcelona missing out on title to Real Madrid, Suarez ended the season well for the Catalan side, scoring 16 goals in 28 matches, a remarkable return given he missed much of the season with a knee injury.¬†</p>

<p>Lionel Messi took another swipe at Barcelona after bidding farewell to his team-mate</p>

<p>However, Koeman told the Uruguayan in a reported one-minute phone call that his time at the Camp Nou would be coming to end, leaving the striker upset with both him and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu.</p>

<p>It appeared that Juventus would be the 33-year-old's next club and he travelled to Italy to try and seal the move. The negotiations were marred by Suarez being accused of cheating in the language test required to seal his residency.</p>

<p>The striker then changed his mind about a move to the Serie A champions and will now line-up against his former side Barcelona later this season.</p>
