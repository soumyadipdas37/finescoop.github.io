<p>Liverpool fans should be excited about the arrival of Thiago from Bayern Munich </p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has been desperate to sign the Spanish international midfielder all summer</p>

<p>Bicycle kick against Stuttgart - January 2014</p>

<p>During his first season at Bayern Munich, Thiago came up trumps for Pep Guardiola on a difficult afternoon at Stuttgart.</p>

<p>He had been on the sidelines injured for large parts of the season but there was certainly no rustiness as he scored a sublime goal to snatch all three points late on.</p>

<p>Rafinha whipped in the cross, only for Thiago to try an acrobatic bicycle kick that flew into the far corner. It was his first goal for Bayern and probably his best. </p>

<p>Away at Stuttgart in January 2014, Thiago scored a sensational bicycle kick to win the game</p>

<p>Lurking around the back post, Thiago readjusted his body to get on the end of Rafinha's cross</p>

<p>With the game on the line, he then managed to reverse the ball across goal and into the corner</p>

<p>Outrageous pass against Hamburg - September 2016</p>

<p>Thiago has always been a fine passer but this ball out to the flank against Hamburg was something else.</p>

<p>Latching onto a loose bouncing ball just inside his own half, Thiago didn't even need a touch to control it and simply sliced across the ball to guide it down the wing.</p>

<p>It found team-mate Franck Ribery running down the flank and led to a goal that Thiago celebrated wildly with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. </p>

<p>It was another moment of genius and bravery to set up an 88th minute winner. </p>

<p>Thiago's pass down the left against Hamburg back in 2016 showed his passing range perfectly</p>

<p>With the ball bouncing, Thiago sliced across it first time and guided it down the left wing</p>

<p>Thiago caught the defenders off guard and his pass raced past them before they could react</p>

<p>It found Franck Ribery perfectly and he went on to set up the winning goal in the 88th minute</p>

<p>Tackle and pass against Hoffenheim - January 2019</p>

<p>If there is one thing Liverpool boss Klopp demands from midfielders is unrelenting effort and a willingness to try and regain possession quickly. This clip shows Thiago's desire to do just that.</p>

<p>The ball falls loose around 15 yards from Bayern's penalty area (seen at 2:43 of the video below) but Thiago comes from behind to steal the ball away from a Hoffenheim player.</p>

<p>He then shows his quick thinking to launch a counter attack, spraying the ball out to Thomas Muller on the right wing. Liverpool fans can imagine him doing just that to Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. </p>

<p>Thiago is ready to react with his team-mate about to lose possession in a dangerous position</p>

<p>He may be diminutive but Thiago comes charging in and regains the ball for Bayern Munich</p>

<p>He then quickly sees Thomas Muller open and sprays the ball out to the right wing for an attack</p>

<p>Muller can then charge down field and cause Hoffenheim problems thanks to Thiago's work</p>

<p>Pressing and goal vs Schalke - January 2020</p>

<p>Another clip here from last season's drubbing of Schalke that shows Thiago's work both off the ball and on it.</p>

<p>Along with a team-mate, Thiago presses a midfielder with his back to goal and forces him to slip and give up possession. He then plays in Robert Lewandowski down the left and continues his run forward.</p>

<p>Screaming for the cut back, Thiago holds his position when gets into the box and waits for the Polish striker to slip the ball across goal for him to tap into an empty net. </p>

<p>Thiago and a Bayern colleague hound a Schalke player and force him to lose possession</p>

<p>After winning the ball he slides a quick pass into Roberto Lewandowski down the left flank</p>

<p>Thiago bursts into the box and then holds his run to wait for Lewandowski to cut the ball back</p>

<p>Hethen simply rolls the ball into the net with Liverpool grateful for more goals from midfield</p>

<p>Goal against Mainz - February 2020</p>

<p>Another beauty of a goal now and this one was a remarkable piece of individual skill back at Mainz earlier this year.</p>

<p>He takes the ball on the turn around 10 yards from the edge of the box and with four defenders in his way. But there is no hesitating and he drives towards goal.</p>

<p>Thiago jinks his way past a few tackles and then goes by another defender before arrowing the ball into the far corner. It was a superb piece of play to put Bayern 3-0 up inside 26 minutes. </p>

<p>Thiago scored a special individual goal against Mainz in the Bundesliga back in February</p>

<p>Unfazed by the number of defenders, Thiago jinked and waved his way inside the penalty area</p>

<p>After working a yard of space, he then fired an unstoppable effort with his weaker left foot</p>

<p>Tricks and flicks</p>

<p>While fans will be much more interested in what he offers Liverpool while actually in possession, we must also admire how good Thiago's control and skill in.</p>

<p>There is montage after montage of Thiago's skills, tricks and flicks and it is hard to highlight just a few.</p>

<p>But whether it be an outrageous turn, sublime close control or a drop of the shoulder when dribbling, he has got it all. Liverpool fans should be very excited indeed. </p>

<p>Thiago has a vast array of trick and flicks, including this chip over a struggling defender's head</p>

<p>Once was not enough in this game though and Thiago chipped the ball back over his opponent</p>

<p>Whether it be a stepover or piece of sublime control, Liverpool fans have lots to look forward to</p>
