<p>It comes after she and Bear-McClard spent the majority of their quarantine in their Los Angeles home.</p>

<p>They caught a flight out of JFK in April, shortly after the CDC issued an advisory, asking 'residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately.'</p>

<p>She previously told British GQ: 'You know, [my husband and I] have been a little bit on the fence. My parents are in California, but as we know the responsible thing is to not travel right now.</p>

<p>'But eventually we would like to make it out there just because, well, New York is the epicenter, although my bodega is still open. I live in Tribeca and it is already very quiet.'</p>

<p>Ratajkowski and her hubby returned to the Big Apple back in June, as they were spotted arriving at JFK.</p>
