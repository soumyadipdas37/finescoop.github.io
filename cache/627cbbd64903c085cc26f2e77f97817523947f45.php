<p>While cities in England struggled with traffic this morning, a major route in the Scottish Borders was partially closed after a root vegetable spillage.</p>

<p>Traffic Scotland raised the alarm that a tractor carrying potatoes had overturned near Dunbar on the A1 at Thistly Cross Roundabout at around 7.45am on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The resulting spillage forced the road to be closed southbound after Haddington.</p>

<p>Traffic has been diverted via the A199 before returning at the Thistly Cross Roundabout.</p>

<p>A recovery operation was then launched by the Trunk Road Incident Support Service in a bid to reopen the route, according to Traffic Scotland.</p>

<p>Police Scotland said it is not aware of any injuries.</p>
