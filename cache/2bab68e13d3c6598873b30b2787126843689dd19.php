<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jordan Houghton became one of MK Dons' key men in the centre of midfield last season, becoming the lynchpin between the defence and midfield.</p>

<p>But with Dons aiming to play with three centre backs this season, Houghton will be taking on a new role within the team.  </p>

<p>Houghton will be hoping to help Dons improve on their 19th place finish last season.  </p>

<p>Jordan Houghton has become one of MK Dons' key central midfielders last season</p>

<p>What did you accomplish in the lockdown weeks?</p>

<p>I tried to learn some guitar but that didn’t last long. I did a bit better learning Spanish, I knew some from school and I improved. And I started to do yin yoga, passive stretching and relaxation, in the evenings and that’s become established as part of my routine, two or three times a week.</p>

<p>Which teammate did you miss in lockdown?</p>

<p>I share my car journeys to Milton Keynes with Dean Lewington and I missed those conversations.</p>

<p>Earliest football memories?</p>

<p>Playing for Ashford Town in our orange-and-white striped kit, and watching the 2005 Champions League final when Liverpool came back to win against Milan. I was nine years old and still under curfew, so I went off to bed at half-time when Liverpool were losing 3-0.</p>

<p>Best goal scored?</p>

<p>As a pro, a goal for MK Dons at Mansfield, a shot from about 30 yards out, in our promotion season. And in the FA Youth Cup final for Chelsea against Fulham, we were 3-2 down after the first leg and won the second leg 5-3. That was an important goal. I played a one-two with Dominic Solanke and struck it low from 25 yards into the bottom corner.</p>

<p>However, MK Dons are now looking to play with three centre back - changing his role</p>

<p>Your five-a-side team? </p>

<p>Petr Cech in goal, me, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Ronaldinho.</p>

<p>VAR, yes or no? </p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>One wish for the season apart from promotion?</p>

<p>Personal and team improvement.</p>

<p>What sport if not football?</p>

<p>I’ve got quite into tennis.</p>

<p>What time do you get up on a day off?</p>

<p>Eight o’clock.</p>

<p>What are you watching?</p>

<p>The All or Nothing Spurs documentary on Amazon Prime. I’ve seen all the NFL ones and all the football ones and this is the best one. It’s a brilliant insight into Jose Mourinho, how he works and interacts. He’s compelling.</p>

<p>One thing you can’t do? Paddle-boarding, I’ve tried it twice on holiday and both times ended up falling in and making a fool of myself.</p>
