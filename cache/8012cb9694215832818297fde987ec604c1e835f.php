<p>At the end of last month, a Greggs depot near Leeds was forced to shutdown after around 20 staff members were infected.</p>

<p>Hundreds of employees were forced to self-isolate after coronavirus was detected at a Banham Poultry factory in Norfolk.</p>

<p>Two Sisters Food processing plant in Coupar Angus, Perthshire saw 152 coronavirus cases linked to an outbreak.</p>

<p>And nearly 300 workers were tested positive at Greencore's factory in Northampton that makes M&amp;S sandwiches.</p>

<p>'We acted early and decisively in March to implement new procedures and have strict protocols at all of our sites, including our Hull Aunt Bessie's factory, to reduce the risk of coronavirus spreading amongst our employees.'</p>

<p>The firm added: 'If a factory worker contracts the virus, we would clean the area where the person was working, confirm that social distancing has been applied and apply our own track and trace procedure to identify co-workers who also need to go into isolation.'</p>

<p>Aunt Bessie's has also confirmed that employees who have to isolate due to having virus symptoms will receive full pay.</p>

<p>The factory which produces 500 million Yorkshire puddings a year is now running at reduced capacity amid the outbreak.</p>

<p>'Our production facilities have always been regularly sanitised, and we introduced additional sanitisation and facility cleans in early March.</p>

<p>'Other measures in place at our Aunt Bessie's facility include floorspace segregation, the use of thermal infrared cameras to detect signs of high temperature, use of Perspex barriers in some areas and mandatory wearing of face masks.</p>

<p>'We have followed and gone beyond the guidance of national health authorities.</p>
