<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Martin Odegaard is Real Madrid's 'Galactico of the new normal' in the eyes of the Spanish media as he prepares to finally get a shot at cracking Zinedine Zidane's first team this season. </p>

<p>The 21-year-old moved to the Spanish capital five years ago from Stromsgodset as one of the most exciting teenagers in world football and it was pronounced on his arrival that he would train with both the first team and the Castilla reserve team. </p>

<p>He eventually made his first team debut, replacing Cristiano Ronaldo in a 7-3 win over Getafe in May 2015 to become the youngest player to debut in the club's history at 16 years and 157 days old.  </p>

<p>Martin Odegaard  has been tipped to be the 'Galactico of the new normal' for Real Madrid</p>

<p>Odegaard moved to Madrid five years ago and played in the youth team under Zinedine Zidane (right) but three loans, most recently Real Sociedad (left), were needed to develop his game</p>

<p>But he failed to get the opportunities consistently thereafter and having been out on loan at Heerenveen, Vitesse and Real Sociedad, it appears he has done enough to convince his old reserve boss Zidane that he is due another crack at the first team.  </p>

<p>Real Sociedad had an agreement to loan him for a further season but that has been cut short and it seems the timing is perfect now for him to show off his talents at the Santiago Bernabeu.  </p>

<p>He excelled last season on loan at Real Sociedad, leading their charge for a Champions League spot, only for them to fall short after the restart, and Zidane knows he has a ready-made replacement for Luka Modric in the Norwegian.</p>

<p>He was set for an extra year on loan at the Basque club but it has been cut short by Madrid</p>

<p>Modric, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner, is 34 and will gradually transition to a lesser role with Odegaard taking the reins from the Croat. </p>

<p>As well as Modric, Odegaard is going to compete with Fede Valverde, Toni Kroos and Casemiro for the starting roles in the midfield of the LaLiga champions. </p>

<p>Odegaard scored seven goals for Sociedad in 2019-20 and went on to provide a further nine assists. </p>

<p>Speaking on his departure from Sociedad having had confirmation he would return to Madrid, he said: 'It has been an unforgettable year for me.</p>

<p>Luka Modric is 34 and Odegaard is seen as the player who can successfully take over the reins</p>

<p>'I have lived incredible moments with this shirt — my presentation, my first goal, our qualification for Europe and much more. You have made me feel like just another Caterano.</p>

<p>'All of the affection on the field and off the field each day, I will never forget.</p>

<p>'I want to thank the club for the confidence they placed in me, to all my team-mates and the staff who have helped me be better.'</p>
