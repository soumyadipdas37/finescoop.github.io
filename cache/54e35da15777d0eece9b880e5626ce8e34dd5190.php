<p>What a choice. </p>

<p>As America prepares to decide between the two oldest presidential candidates ever to run for the White House, Donald Trump and Joe Biden appear to be starring in a remake of that Jim Carrey movie, Dumb And Dumber.</p>

<p>At 74 and 77, they're Senile And Seniler. Just be grateful that Brits don't vote in their election. Nobody appears to have told Sue Perkins, though. </p>

<p>The former Bake Off presenter was wringing her hands on both sides of the wall in her travelogue, Along The U.S.–Mexico Border (BBC1).</p>

<p>'How many times do we have to put these things up before we realise this is not the way?' she wailed, gazing at an endless stretch of cast-iron barrier looped with razor-wire.</p>

<p>Breathe deeply, dear, and calm your nerves.  </p>

<p>'We' haven't anything to do with it. It's a U.S. matter, and despite your quiff, no one could ever mistake you for an American.</p>

<p>This is a common delusion for lots of liberal luvvies. They imagine they run the whole world — or, if they don't, they ought to.</p>

<p>That's how we end up deposing dictators in other people's countries and get mired in decade-long conflicts.</p>

<p>It's a good job that most of the Mexicans she met have better things to do than gripe about politics. </p>

<p>In Tijuana, just over the line from California, they're busy partying . . . all the time.</p>

<p>While Sue was tutting about the injustice of immigration controls, a man in a sombrero was parading a donkey that was striped with black and white paint. </p>

<p>Or perhaps it was a pet zebra. Either way, at least one of them was stewed to the gills.</p>

<p>In an effort to catch up, Sue tried a slug-and-swallow tequila tasting at a nearby off-licence that boasted hundreds of ornate bottles of the local liquor.</p>

<p>By the fourth shot, a gloopy spirit called Kama Sutra Sexy Cream, she sounded as if her tongue had turned to damp carpet.</p>

<p>The one-liners were blurred but her wit wasn't. </p>

<p>'Mmm,' she mumbled, 'it's complex, it's sugary, I'm getting burned bin liner . . . and then the alcohol hits.'</p>

<p>That's where the comedienne excels. </p>

<p>When she isn't trying to impress us with undergraduate philosophising about migrants and morality, Sue is an exhilarating travel guide. </p>

<p>People like her, because she clearly wants to be liked and never stops talking. Well, most people like her, anyway.</p>

<p>Joining a festival for the Day of the Dead in Nogales, she boogied alongside a child who was wearing a bridal gown with her face painted like a skull.</p>

<p>Intense concentration is the keynote of The Repair Shop (BBC1), which returned with new afternoon episodes</p>

<p>'You've got it going on!' Sue shouted, trying to attract her attention. The little girl ignored her intently. Being a corpse-bride probably takes a lot of concentration.</p>

<p>Intense concentration is the keynote of The Repair Shop (BBC1), which returned with new afternoon episodes. </p>

<p>It's deeply relaxing to watch a craftsman (or craftswoman) so absorbed in their work that they can barely speak. </p>

<p>Every item restored on the show brings pleasure, but every now and then something exceptional turns up. </p>

<p>This time, it was a battered leather clutch-bag from the 1930s, brought in by 82-year-old Derek from Stockport. </p>

<p>It was the only thing he owned that had belonged to his mother, who died aged 25 when he was just two. </p>

<p>He couldn't remember her, but he treasured the creased, black-and-white photo she'd kept in the bag. </p>

<p>It showed her, beaming at the camera and holding a baby Derek on her lap. </p>

<p>Wisely, The Repair Shop never offers valuations on items, because things like that are beyond price.</p>
