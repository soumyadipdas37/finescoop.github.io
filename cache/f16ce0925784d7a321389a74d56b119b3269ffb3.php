<p>A savvy Australian mother-of-two has shared her easy recipe to make custard-filled cakes using her $29 sausage roll maker from Kmart. To make the easy dessert, she used a butter cake mix from Coles and a vanilla flavoured custard mix</p>

<p>Although Danni used a 75-cent cake mixture, other foodies said the cakes looked 'delicious' and 'so good'.</p>

<p>To make the dessert, she followed the instructions on the back of the packets then poured the batter into the sausage roll maker and cooked for five minutes.</p>

<p>She then cut the cakes down the middle, made the custard and piped the filling inside the cake shells before dusting with icing sugar.</p>
