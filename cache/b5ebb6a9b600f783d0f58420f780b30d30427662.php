<p>Wedding ceremonies and receptions in England are to be restricted to just 15 people - half of the current guidelines - as part of new coronavirus measures to curb a surge in cases.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson added that funeral services would be exempt from the limitations, with the maximum number of mourners remaining at 30. </p>

<p>Setting out the measures in the House of Commons, the politician, 56, said: 'Fifth, now is the time to tighten up the rule of six.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid that from Monday a maximum of 15 people will be able to attend wedding ceremonies and receptions, though up to 30 can still attend a funeral as now.'</p>

<p>What's going on? Peaky Blinders' Helen, meanwhile, cut a sophisticated figure in a polka dot blouse, high-waisted trousers and a wool coat, but her right arm was held up in a sling</p>

<p>Reoccurring? Nearly a year ago, the skilled thespian used a scarf to support the same limb during a night out (pictured)</p>

<p>Wahay! Damian couldn't contain his delight as he congratulated the newlyweds while strumming the keys of his instrument</p>

<p>You may kiss the bride: The new husband and wife shared a sweet smooch to ring in their new relationship status</p>

<p>Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies and receptions were included in a list of exemptions to the ban on social gatherings of more than six.   </p>

<p>Current guidance states that up to 30 attendees are permitted in Wales, while in Scotland, ceremonies and receptions are limited to 20 people, and numbers are dependent on the venue in Northern Ireland.  </p>

<p>In March, Damian joked he finally knows what fellow thespian Helen looked like as they self-isolated together in their Suffolk home amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Stopping the spread of COVID-19: Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies and receptions were included in a list of exemptions to the ban on social gatherings of more than six</p>

<p>Sweet memories: Attendees ensured they documented the celebration on their mobile devices</p>

<p>Love wins: Despite COVID-19, Damian and Helen's friends proved there's no stopping them as they still managed to have a fun-filled wedding during the pandemic</p>

<p>Milestone: The group posed for snaps outside the office </p>

<p>The duo were asked how they were coping with life in quarantine, in contrast to their typically busy schedules during an appearance on Good Morning Britain. </p>

<p>Homeland actor Damian quipped: 'I know, it’s amazing! I had no idea [Helen] looked like that!' </p>

<p>The celebrity couple, who have been married for 13 years, raise their two children, 13-year-old daughter Manon and son Gulliver, 12, at their home in north London.</p>

<p>Helen previously revealed to the Radio Times that when she met the flame-haired actor, it had been love at first sight.</p>

<p>'He just made me laugh a lot. And still does,' she gushed of her longtime partner. 'Of course, everyone in life wants someone to love and be loved by, but I think I was always just engrossed and involved in work.</p>

<p>'And no, the timing was pure fluke, pure chance, it always is, isn’t it?'</p>

<p>Going strong: The couple, who have been married for 13 years, raise their two children, 13-year-old daughter Manon and son Gulliver, 12, at their home in north London (pictured in 2019)</p>
