<p>Rachel Winter, Associate Investment Director at Killik &amp; Co, comments on the latest inflation statistics: </p>

<p>In the month of August, the nation made the most out of the Government’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme and a last-minute holiday or two. The latest gradual steps towards the ‘new normal’ were marked by some choosing to return to the office, but there’s still a lot of work to be done to get the city centres back up and running.</p>

<p>The fall in inflation means we are edging further away from the government’s 2% target, contradictory to the increases seen over the last few months.</p>

<p>With rumours of deflation gathering pace, it’s difficult to predict what will happen next. We’ve recently seen a rise in Covid-19 cases, not only in the UK but across Europe. Local lockdowns are becoming more common alongside the imminent end to the furlough scheme, resulting in fear of mass job losses. We’re listening closely to rumours around the Autumn budget, which should shed some light on how the government plans to cover the cost of the pandemic while supporting those in and out of work.</p>
