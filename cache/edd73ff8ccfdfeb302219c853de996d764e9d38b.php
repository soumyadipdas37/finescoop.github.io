<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ellen DeGeneres launched the new season of her daytime talk show on Monday with a monologue where she apologized for 'ever hurting' anyone, took responsibility for claims she runs a toxic workplace and admitted to being impatient but insisted she was the person she appears to be on TV and not a behind-the-scenes villain. </p>

<p>The star's show has been weighed down by allegations that she treated staffers with little or no respect and that senior producers allowed and encouraged a toxic work environment since earlier this summer. </p>

<p>Three producers were fired and there were questions of whether or not it would return to the air. </p>

<p>On Monday, the first, pre-taped episode of season 18 will air in the afternoon. Ahead of it, the show put out a clip of Ellen kicking off the show with a five minute monologue addressing the controversy. </p>

<p>She was neither unrepentant nor deeply apologetic, saying that she had 'learned' of things at the show that needed to be changed but squeezing in some jokes about her impatience. </p>

<p>There was no audience due to COVID-19. Instead, an audience on screens  laughed along and applauded her </p>

<p>'You may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show and then there was an investigation,' she told the audience of screens on which her virtual audience appeared.  </p>

<p>'I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realize that with that comes responsibility and I take responsibility for what happens at my show,' she said. </p>

<p>Later, she went on: 'There were also articles in the press and on social media that said I am not who I appear to be on TV because I became known as the be kind lady and here's how that happened. </p>

<p>'I started saying be kind to one another after a young man named Tyler Clementi took his own life after being bullied for being gay. I thought the world needed more kindness and it was a reminder that we all needed that.</p>

<p>'I think we need it more than ever right now. Being known as the be kind lady is a tricky position to be in. Let me give you some advice out there, if anybody is thinking of changing their title or giving yourself a nickname, do not go with the 'be kind lady'. Don't do it. </p>

<p>DeGeneres announced that she had promoted Stephen Laurel 'tWitch' Boss to become her executive co-producer.</p>

<p>'The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad. I get mad. I get anxious. I get frustrated. </p>

<p>'I get impatient. And I am working on all of that. I am a work in progress. </p>

<p>'And I am especially working on the impatience thing. And it's not going well because it's not happening fast enough I will tell you that. </p>

<p>'Listen, I don't know. I'm a talk show host but maybe some of you know that I was an actress. </p>

<p>'I've played a straight woman in movies so I'm a pretty good actress but I don't think that I'm that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you.' </p>

<p>DeGeneres then announced that she had promoted Stephen Laurel 'tWitch' Boss to become her executive co-producer. </p>

<p>Among the allegations against DeGeneres ran a workplace which fostered racism, sexual misconduct and bullying. </p>

<p>She apologized to staff privately in a conference call.  </p>

<p>Oh boy welcome to season 18 of the Ellen DeGeneres show. If you're watching because you love me, thank you, if you're watching because you don't love me, welcome! </p>

<p>How was everybody's summer? Good? Mine was great. Super terrific. I am so happy to be back in the studio. There are a lot of things I want to talk about. I've been looking forward to addressing it all directly and unfortunately talking directly to people has been illegal for six months so I a virtual audience here instead, here you all are. You look beautiful and I am sure you smell great, that's what I am imagining anyway. </p>

<p>All right, let's get to it. As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show and then there was an investigation. </p>

<p>I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realize that with that comes responsibility and I take responsibility for what happens at my show. </p>

<p>This is the Ellen DeGeneres show, I am Ellen DeGeneres, my name is there, my name is there, my name is on underwear... we have had a lot of conversations over the last few weeks about our show, our workplace and what we want for the future. </p>

<p>We have made the necessary changes and today we are starting a new chapter. There were also articles in the press and on social media that said I am not who I appear to be on TV because I became known as the be kind lady and here's how that happened. </p>

<p>I started saying be kind to one another after a young man named Tyler Clementi took his own life after being bullied for being gay. I thought the world needed more kindness and it was a reminder that we all needed that.</p>

<p>I think we need it more than ever right now. Being known as the be kind lady is a tricky position to be in. Let me give you some advice out there, if anybody is thinking of changing their title or giving yourself a nickname, do not go with the 'be kind lady'. Don't do it. </p>

<p>The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad. I get mad. I get anxious. I get frustrated. I get impatient. And I am working on all of that. I am a work in progress. And I am especially working on the impatience thing. And it's not going well because it's not happening fast enough I will tell you that. </p>

<p>Listen, I don't know. I'm a talk show host but maybe some of you know that I was an actress. I've played a straight woman in movies so I'm a pretty good actress but I don't think that I'm that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you. </p>

<p>This is me and my intention is to always be the best person I can be. If I've ever let someone down, if I've ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that. If that's ever the case I have let myself down and I've hurt myself as well because I always try to grow as a person. I look at everything that comes into my life as an opportunity to learn. I got into this business to make people laugh and feel good. </p>

<p>That's my favorite thing to do. That and Jenga. I love that game. And now I am a boss of 270 people. 270 people who help make this show what it is. 270 people who I am so grateful for. All I want is for every single one of them to be happy and be proud to work here. </p>

<p>This has been a horrible summer for people all around the world. People are losing their jobs. People are losing loved ones to a pandemic. People are losing their homes and lives in the raging fires that are going on. There's blatant racial injustice all around us. I watch the news and I feel like, where do we even begin? </p>

<p>So my hope is that we can still be a place of happiness and joy. I still want to be the one hour a day where people can go to escape and laugh. I want to continue to help the people that we help every day. And I am committed to making this the best season that we have ever had. </p>

<p>So welcome to season 18 of the Ellen Show. I am so glad that you are here. I want to start the new season by saying hello to my friend Twitch . </p>

<p>'You are not my DJ any more. You are now my co-executive producer. You are such an important part of the show. Unfortunately I had to take the fake DJ equipment away.'</p>
