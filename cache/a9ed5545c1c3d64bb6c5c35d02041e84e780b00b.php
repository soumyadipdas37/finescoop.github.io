<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The father of Jacob Blake says he won't meet with Donald Trump when he visits the city of Kenosha today because 'I don't want to play politics'.</p>

<p>Jacob Blake Sr spoke out after the president turned down a meeting with the Blake family because they wanted to have lawyers listen to the conversation, which he called 'inappropriate'.  </p>

<p>Asked about Trump's response, Blake Sr said: 'I'm not getting into politics. It's all about my son, man. It has nothing to do with a photo-op.' </p>

<p>Jacob Blake Sr, the father of Jacob Blake who was shot dead in Kinosha a week ago, has insisted he doesn't want to 'play politics' after a meeting with Donald Trump fell through</p>

<p>Jacob Blake Jr was shot seven times in the back in Kenosha on August 23 by police as he tried to get into a car with three of his six children inside </p>

<p>Speaking to CNN's Jim Acosta, Blake Sr's lawyer confirmed that he wanted to listen to the call with Trump, because of the ongoing Justice Department investigation into the shooting.</p>

<p>'[I think] it would be most appropriate to have your counsel on the phone when you're talking to anybody involved in the government,' he added. </p>

<p>Trump is expected to arrive in Kenosha, Washington, around 1pm EST today to shake hands with police officers and visit riot-damaged areas while hammering home his 'law and order' campaign message.</p>

<p>The trip is going ahead despite the Wisconsin governor and Kenosha mayor urging him to reconsider, saying it will set back the city's efforts to heal.</p>

<p>Large parts of the uptown neighborhood - home to many black and Hispanic residents - were burned or damaged by rioters and looters over three nights of chaos following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, which was caught on video.</p>

<p>Donald Trump will visit Kenosha on Tuesday and was in talks with Blake's family about a meeting, but said he declined after the family wanted their lawyers to sit in</p>

<p>Blake Sr (pictured at a rally on August 28) confirmed that he wanted lawyers present because of an ongoing Justice Department investigation into his son's shooting</p>

<p>Blake was shot seven times in the back by officer Rusten Sheskey while trying to get into his car, where his three children were sat.</p>

<p>Police say Blake had attacked them and resisted two attempts to subdue him with a Taser before being shot.</p>

<p>Video shows Blake walking away from police with his arms by his side and opening his driver-side door before gunshots ring out.</p>

<p>He survived the shooting, but is now in hospital in a serious but stable condition. His family say he is likely to be paralyzed for life.</p>

<p>Giving an update on his son's condition, Blake Sr said he is 'holding on for dear life.'</p>

<p>'We are dealing with an individual that a couple of months, a couple of weeks ago was running around with the boys and talking to me on the phone and laughing to an individual that cannot move his leg,' he said. </p>

<p>Blake Sr urged activists to remain peaceful during a wave of demonstrations that followed, but his pleas fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>Blake's shooting sparked protests in Kenosha which quickly turned into riots, with businesses torched and looted amid unrest that was blamed on outsiders </p>

<p>The interior of burned-out businesses in Kenosha are seen from the air after being targeted by rioters and looters in three nights of unrest that roiled the city last week</p>

<p>A hand-painted sign reading 'KenoshaStrong' is seen outside the remains of a business which was torched and subsequently collapsed amid rioting in the city, sparked by the shooting of an unarmed black man</p>

<p>A car dealership in Kenosha's uptown was one of the first businesses to be targeted, with the owners estimating that $1.5million in damage was caused by a fire that was ignited in their sales lot (pictured)</p>

<p>Over the course of three nights, an estimated $30million in damage was caused to businesses and buildings, with out-of-towers blamed for the disturbance.</p>

<p>The local sheriff's department has said that, of the 175 people arrested during the unrest, 102 of them have addresses outside the city.</p>

<p>Events came to a head on the night of August 25, when 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse shot and killed two people and wounded a third with a rifle he was illegally carrying.</p>

<p>Rittenhouse had traveled from Illinois to join what police described as 'vigilante' groups who said they were there to 'protect' businesses.</p>

<p>The teenager, who is now in jail charged with murder, claims self-defense.</p>

<p>Trump has since spoken out in defence of Rittenhouse, saying he 'probably would have been killed' by protesters if he hadn't opened fire.</p>

<p>'He was trying to get away from them I guess, it looks like, and he fell on then they very violently attacked him,' Trump said.</p>

<p>'It was something that we are looking at right now and it's under investigation, but I guess he was in very big trouble. He probably would've been killed. It's under investigation,' he added. </p>
