<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>DeIe Alli has not been included in the squad to face Lokomotiv Plovdiv as he faces the prospect of leaving Tottenham.</p>

<p>Alli is one of eight players to have remained in London ahead of the Europa League tie in Bulgaria, as significant doubts emerge over his future.</p>

<p>Sportsmail reported this week how Tottenham had considered using Alli as a potential sweetener in their move to bring Gareth Bale back to Tottenham.</p>

<p>Dele Alli has not travelled to Bulgaria for Tottenham's Europa League tie in Plovdiv this week</p>

<p>Alli was discussed as being part of a swap deal which could see Gareth Bale join Spurs</p>

<p>That scenario is looking unlikely, however the prospect of Alli leaving Spurs before the October 5 transfer deadline is starting to look a realistic possibility - his exclusion from the travelling party on Wednesday is another indicator that his future, at least this season, may remain elsewhere.</p>

<p>While Alli’s talent is undoubted, there is a mutual feeling from all parties the midfielder could benefit from a move away to reinvigorate his career - particularly if it becomes clear Alli won’t be playing regularly this season.</p>

<p>With Bale’s planned arrival, competition for places in attacking midfield positions will become fiercer in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>If the 24-year-old is made available, then there will be no shortage of takers domestically and in Europe.</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan are keen on signing the 24-year-old this summer</p>

<p>But there is likely to be a reluctance to sell Alli on a permanent basis from within the club given the depreciated market caused by Covid - particularly for a player who not long ago was valued in the region of £100million.</p>

<p>Tottenham would also prefer to loan Alli to an overseas club so not to strengthen a domestic rival.</p>

<p>Paris Saint Germain have monitored Alli for a number of years, while Inter Milan manager Antonio Conte is known to be a long-term admirer.</p>

<p>Alli, by his own admission, has not lived up to the sky-high standards he has set himself after bursting onto the scene in sensational fashion five years ago.</p>

<p>Having become an integral part of Gareth Southgate’s team at World Cup 2018, during which England euphorically made it to the semi-finals, Alli has lost his place in the national squad.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho took Alli off at half-time during Tottenham's 1-0 defeat to Everton on Sunday</p>

<p>A string of unfortunate injuries has played a key role in the midfielder losing his place in the England set-up.</p>

<p>But with the European Championships just nine months away, Alli knows he needs to playing regularly to have any chance of breaking back into Southgate’s squad. </p>

<p>Alli started Sunday’s 1-0 opening day loss to Everton - but was substituted at half-time sparking suggestions of a row between the Mourinho and the midfielder.</p>

<p>But the Tottenham boss is adamant there has been no bust-up, saying: ‘Dele is a very polite guy, very calm. He’s a bit introspective, when you think a lot about things.</p>

<p>‘The way he reacted was Dele. It was quiet, sad, but in the end, after the game, he was just one of many. And I never saw from him in here with myself, with the other players, everybody at the club, I never saw a strong reaction. A good boy. A really good boy.'</p>
