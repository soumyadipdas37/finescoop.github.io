<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian renter has completely transformed her laundry room without making any irreversible changes - and she only used furniture from discount stores Kmart and IKEA.</p>

<p>The woman, who lives in Perth, Western Australia, was looking to makeover the cluttered space without spending hundreds of dollars, but still wanted it to be functional.  </p>

<p>'I am renting so I was limited as to what I can do, so everything had to be functioning,' she wrote on Facebook alongside before and after photos.</p>

<p>'I am renting so I was limited as to what I can do, so everything had to be functioning,' she wrote on Facebook alongside before and after photos (pictured)</p>

<p>'The before picture is when I began the process.'</p>

<p>The prints on the walls and three laundry baskets stacked together ($4.99 each) were from IKEA and everything else was from Kmart.</p>

<p>That includes the numerous white plastic and rattan baskets she has installed to keep things in a neat and tidy manner. </p>

<p>'I've seen pretty awesome laundry bins from Kmart but couldn't get my hands on them,' she said.</p>

<p>'I finished this over a month ago and it's still functioning well.'</p>

<p>'You've done a mighty job with it! And so few extra parts needed,' one person said</p>

<p>The results impressed a number of home improvement enthusiasts who called the work she had done 'beautiful'.</p>

<p>'You've done a mighty job with it! And so few extra parts needed,' one person said.</p>

<p>'Wow I love it. I have just moved into a rental and want to do something similar,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'Wow what a difference those baskets have made'.</p>

<p>Some asked whether she had been allowed to screw holes in the walls for mounted shelves but they came with the rental, so she wasn't sure.</p>

<p>There are different rules depending on your individual landlord so it's always best to check with them before you make any large changes to the structure of the house. </p>
