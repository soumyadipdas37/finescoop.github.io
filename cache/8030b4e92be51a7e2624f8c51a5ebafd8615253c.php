<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Suarez's hopes of making his desired move to Turin have been dashed, with manager Andrea Pirlo saying 'it will be difficult' for him to become a Juventus player this season.</p>

<p>According to Italian outlet Gazzette dello Sport, the new Juventus boss said: 'Suarez is difficult because the times to get a passport are long, it is complicated that [our new striker] can be him.' </p>

<p>Personal terms on a £9million-per-year deal have been concluded, and Suarez has passed a required Italian exam, but the process is stalling out. </p>

<p>Luis Suarez's hopes of making a move to Juventus this season may have been dashed</p>

<p>Juventus manager Andrea Pirlo says 'it will be difficult' for him to make the move this month</p>

<p>The Old Lady stepped up their pursuit of the Uruguayan, but will not be allowed to bring in any more non-EU players in this transfer window. </p>

<p>Juventus have already brought in Brazilian international Arthur Melo and Unites States midfielder Weston McKennie this summer, limiting their options in pursuit of the 33-year-old striker. </p>

<p>The club needed Suarez to pass an Italian exam in Perugia and acquire dual nationality to make a transfer possible this month. </p>

<p>He did achieve the B1 certification diploma after a one-hour exam. However he will still have to wait for a passport, with the transfer window slamming shut on October 5. </p>

<p>Juventus need Luis Suarez to obtain an Italian passport if he is to complete a move to Turin</p>

<p>Roma striker Edin Dzeko is set to join Juventus for £15million deal on a two-year contract</p>

<p>He was reportedly tested in four key areas: listening and comprehension of oral texts, reading and writing in Italian, how to use Italian on a daily basis and a face to face dialogue to test his speaking skills. </p>

<p>Suarez has been deemed surplus to requirements at the Nou Camp by new boss Ronald Koeman, however in another setback for the move, it appears Edin Dzeko is on the verge of joining Juventus from Roma. </p>

<p>Dzeko is expected to sign a two-year deal in Piedmont worth €7.5m (£7m) per year, making Juventus' pursuit of another forward less likely. </p>
