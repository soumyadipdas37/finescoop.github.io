<p>Her solo outing comes just a day after the mother-of-four attended a concert in Ghent's Saint Bavo Cathedral with King Philippe.   </p>

<p>The royal couple attended the world premiere of Arvo Pärt’s 'Für Jan van Eyck' performed by Belgian choir Collegium Vocale Gent. </p>

<p>The initiative for creating the piece came from the Belgian choir and was commissioned by the City of Ghent, who has dedicated the year 2020 to celebrating Jan van Eyck, a Dutch painter. </p>

<p>Mathilde once again put on a stylish display as she continued to perform her royal duties despite the ongoing coronavirus threat</p>

<p>The composition was inspired by the altarpiece The Adoration of a Mystic Lamb by the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck, located in St. Bavo’s Cathedral, Ghent. </p>

<p>The concert took place under the baton of the world-famous Belgian conductor Philippe Herreweghe and the choir will also be celebrating its 50th anniversary with this concert. </p>

<p>The pair seemed in good spirits as they sat, socially distanced from other guests, to watch the musical concert. </p>

<p>It is also provided that social distancing of one-meter is respected and wearing a mask is compulsory. </p>
