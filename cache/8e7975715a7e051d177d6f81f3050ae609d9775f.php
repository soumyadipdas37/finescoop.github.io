<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ministry of Defence has unveiled a drone armed with twin stabilised shotguns that uses AI to identify its targets.</p>

<p>The drone has six rotor blades and is attached with a camera to provide a live-stream of indoor conflicts to a remote solider, who fires the device's weapons.   </p>

<p>A first prototype of the metre-long machine, which is designed only for indoor combat, has been called the i9. </p>

<p>MoD has developed the flying 'armed fighter' with an undisclosed British company to deploy specifically in urban situations, such as buildings barricaded by armed personnel. </p>

<p>This type of UAS system will reduce the threat to life of personnel by giving tactical commanders the option to send a remotely-controlled machine into dangerous scenarios, MoD said (stock picture). MoD told MailOnline it's unable to provide photos of the prototype, as this has been developed with a UK start-up that is in negotiations around Series A funding, and is therefore in ‘stealth mode’ (without a public profile)</p>

<p>'UK Strategic Command has been developing a capability under Project i9 to develop an armed urban warfare unmanned aerial system (UAS),' MoD said in a statement to MailOnline.  </p>

<p>'Project i9 has successfully created a prototype capability, which is being used for experimentation with end users now. </p>

<p>'This type of UAS will reduce the threat to life of personnel by giving tactical commanders the option to send a remotely-controlled machine into dangerous scenarios rather than put personnel or military working dogs at significant risk.'     </p>

<p>MoD told MailOnline it is unable to provide photos of the prototype, as it's been developed with a UK start-up that is in negotiations around Series A funding, and is therefore in ‘stealth mode’. </p>

<p>MoD says it has created a prototype of the i9, which has been designed specifically for indoor battle operations (stock picture)</p>

<p>Drones used by the British Army so far, including the Desert Hawk, have been specialised for outdoor use, such as base perimeter protection. </p>

<p>The so-called i9 drone is the UK military’s first weaponised drone to be able to fly inside, according to the Times. </p>

<p>It's been developed in response to significant casualties suffered in Afghanistan when entering barricaded buildings and will help protect British army personnel fighting in densely populated cities. </p>

<p>'Close-combat urban warfare provides some of the most dangerous and complex scenarios to military personnel,' MoD said to MailOnline. </p>

<p>'Moving through urban environments, and particularly within buildings regularly exposes personnel to significant danger and unexpected lethal force.' </p>

<p>i9 has in-built 'machine vision' – similar to technology used in driverless cars to sense surroundings on the road – to identify the enemy. </p>

<p>The AI also helps i9 stay upright, line up targets and avoid crashing into walls indoors, which is a risk because of the way drones displace air in small rooms. </p>

<p>The soldier operating i9 remotely monitors the live feed from the drone's camera on a screen to decide whether to open fire. </p>

<p>MoD stressed to MailOnline that human control will be maintained over the system 'at all times'.</p>

<p>i9 has twin shotguns but MoD is also testing it with rockets and chain guns, which use a chain-like ammunition feeding mechanism.       </p>

<p>The device is part of the government agency's promise for British military to become 'relentlessly innovative’ in the new decade. </p>

<p>‘Instead of mass and mobilisation, this future force will be about speed, readiness and resilience, operating much more in the newest domains, in space, cyber and sub-sea, and working to prevent conflict as well as winning it,' Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said earlier this month. </p>

<p>‘The global picture has changed, our enemies have studied our vulnerabilities and have adapted far more quickly than us.’   </p>

<p>The Malloy Aeronautics T-400 could also be used to evacuate casualties by putting them in a tube fixed to the pilotless drone, or search for migrants in the Channel. Meanwhile the autonomous Anduril Anvil piece of kit uses sensors to find out where drones are</p>

<p>It was reported earlier this month that MoD is also boosting its counter-drone capabilities with an aerial drone-bashing 'battering ram', designed to knock drones out of the sky. </p>

<p>The autonomous Anvil, developed by drone start-up Anduril, uses sensors to find out where drones are – relying on light and shadows – and then bashes into drones, rendering them useless.  </p>

<p>Another new quadcopter drone, the Malloy Aeronautics T-400, can either carry a torpedo, huge payloads of ammunition or medical supplies to emergency situations.  </p>

<p>The ‘pilotless pick-up truck of the air’ could also be used to evacuate casualties by putting them in a tube fixed to the pilotless drone, or search for migrants at sea. </p>

<p>‘It’s not all about delivering payloads and weapons, you could use it for border control, going up and down the Channel,' said a technical adviser to the navy’s chief technology officer.</p>

<p>‘It could be boxes of ammunition, which are really heavy, and you might need to get it across unhospitable terrain, snow, sand, rocks.’  </p>

<p>TheBlack Hornet3 is used by the British military on the front line. It is controlled using a one-handed thumb stick and troops can watch its HD surveillance video stream live on a smartphone </p>

<p>Last year, troops on the front lines were given miniature drones developed by MOD that are 'smaller than a human hand' that stream HD video on mobile phones.</p>

<p>These mini-drones, dubbed Black Hornet, can take over the life-threatening surveillance and reconnaissance duties currently undertaken by soldiers. </p>

<p>They weigh less than seven ounces (200g) and can carry out surveillance over a wide area. </p>

<p>MoD is investing £66 million ($87m) to 'fast-track' military robotic projects to the battlefield, it said last year. </p>

<p>A number of countries are known to be developing autonomous weapon systems, which can select and eliminate targets without human help.</p>

<p>They include France, Israel, Russia, South Korea, the USA and UK.</p>

<p>Nations are racing to develop AI systems that can take control of unmanned military Reaper drones - UAVs that are currently piloted by humans from a ground control centre.</p>

<p>The high-altitude craft could soon pick out targets and hit them with air-to-ground missiles without any human oversight.</p>

<p>Rumours suggest military officials are also looking into the development of automated tanks.</p>

<p>AI-assisted weapons systems are already in use in some countries, including Israel, which recently deployed semi-autonomous drones to fire tear gas at protesters in Gaza.</p>
