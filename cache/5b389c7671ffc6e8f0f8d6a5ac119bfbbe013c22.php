<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A drugs raid on the Welsh Guard's barracks has uncovered traces of cocaine and ecstasy.  </p>

<p>A stop-and-search operation was conducted by 30 Royal Military and civilian police officers on as many as 200 guardsmen from 1st Battalion The Welsh Guards. </p>

<p>The joint team, who were accompanied by a drug detection dog, tested the cards and wallets of the soldiers. </p>

<p>Five bank cards belonging to five soldiers tested positive for traces of ecstasy and cocaine. </p>

<p>The five soldiers were not arrested but given a warning and are now subject to drug testing, the Mirror reports. </p>

<p>Military and civilian police swabbed the possessions of 200 members of the Welsh Guard (pictured) and found traces of cocaine and ecstasy </p>

<p>A senior military source told the Mirror: 'The Queen has been made aware of the situation and takes a great deal of interest in her guardsmen.'   </p>

<p>Last week, it was revealed that 13 soldiers who guard Windsor Castle and protect the Queen have been jailed for breaking lockdown rules.</p>

<p>They were among a group of 16 guardsmen who attended a booze and cocaine-fuelled 'mini-rave' at a riverside park.</p>

<p>They partied with members of the public which meant they had broken a 'bubble' put in place as the Queen and Prince Philip were shielding inside.</p>

<p>The first 13 troops from the Welsh Guards were sentenced last week. </p>

<p> A senior military source told the Mirror: 'The Queen has been made aware of the situation and takes a great deal of interest in her guardsmen'</p>

<p>Their punishments ranged from 14 to 28 days at the military's Glasshouse prison in Colchester.</p>

<p>It is thought to be the largest number of troops jailed for a single crime at the same time. </p>

<p>Four of the men also tested positive for cocaine and will be kicked out of the Army after serving their sentences.</p>

<p>The guardsmen were based at Combermere Barracks in Windsor. </p>

<p>The party took place in late June, less than two weeks after the Queen attended a socially distanced Trooping the Colour – the first time the ceremony had taken place at Windsor since 1895.</p>

<p>During lockdown the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were protected at the castle by what became known as the 'HMS Bubble'. </p>

<p>At the height of the pandemic, her band of 24 servants were split into two teams of 12 who worked three weeks on and then three weeks off.</p>

<p>They also had to spend a week in quarantine before they got back from leave. </p>

<p>The guardsman were treated as a single household and under the rules they were banned from mixing with other people.</p>

<p>They could not even meet their families to make sure that the Royals were protected. But at the party they broke these rules by mixing with locals, sources said.</p>

<p>An Army source added: 'There was never any danger to the Queen and Prince Philip. They would have had absolutely no contact with the royals or members of the royal household.'</p>

<p>The other three guardsmen, including a more senior lance sergeant, will be told of their punishment in the coming days.       </p>
