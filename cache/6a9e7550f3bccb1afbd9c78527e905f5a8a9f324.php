<p>In a debate lasting more than an hour, members argued decision-making has become increasingly centralised and public funding for the islands has been cut under the SNP Government. </p>

<p>Councillors voted 18 to two in favour of a motion to formally explore options 'for achieving financial and political self-determination'. </p>

<p>Shetland Islands Council has voted overwhelmingly to start looking at ways to become financially and politically independent from Scotland</p>

<p>The motion, signed by council leader Steven Coutts and convener Malcolm Bell, said: 'We are concerned that this ongoing situation is seriously threatening the prosperity and even basic sustainability of Shetland as a community.' </p>

<p>Any move for Shetland to become self-determining would need to be supported by an island-wide referendum, councillors stressed. </p>

<p>Mr Coutts suggested devolution has not benefited Shetland – famous for its Up Helly Aa fire festivals, in which Viking ships are burned – and said the Scottish parliament feels 'remote' to islanders. </p>

<p>He claimed the levels of funding for ferries 'negatively impacts on Shetland and everyone of Shetland', although the Government said it has provided more than £15million for ferry services over the past three years. </p>

<p>The Shetland West councillor referenced the 2013 Lerwick declaration by former First Minister Alex Salmond, when he announced plans to decentralise power to the islands. </p>

<p>Quoting Mr Salmond's statement 'we believe that the people who live and work in Scotland are best placed to make decisions about our future', Mr Coutts said: 'Replace Scotland with Shetland that's the motion here today, and I encourage you to support it.' </p>

<p>Ahead of discussions with the UK and Scottish Governments, Mr Coutts said: 'I hope they recognise the challenges of living in Shetland, like the high cost of living, but also the incredible opportunities political and financial self-determination could bring.' </p>

<p>Responding to the vote, Islands Minister Paul Wheelhouse said Shetland had not submitted any request for further powers under new regulations introduced last year. </p>

<p>He said: 'It is the responsibility of local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the resources available to them on the basis of local needs and priorities.' </p>
