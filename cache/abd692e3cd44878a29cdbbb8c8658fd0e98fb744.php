<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 reality star Jon Gosselin has strongly denied reports that he harmed his teenage son, and has also denied that there is any ongoing investigation into such an incident. </p>

<p>According to a magazine report, Collin Gosselin, 16, had supposedly claimed in a now-deleted Instagram post, that his father Jon, 43, kicked and punched him during an altercation that is said to have taken place earlier this month.</p>

<p>However, a rep for Jon Gosselin told DailyMail.com: 'Jon has never abused Collin. No charges have been filed against him and there's no ongoing CYS investigation.  </p>

<p>Claims: Kate Gosselin's son Collin has accused his dad Jon Gosselin of physical abuse, prompting an investigation by the County of Berks, Pennsylvania Child &amp; Youth Services</p>

<p>'Collin has endured severe trauma. Jon is a loving father who has worked hard to ensure that his son gets the support and help he needs.' </p>

<p>However, it appears his ex-wife Kate Gosselin took the alleged story to PEOPLE magazine, where they claimed the County of Berks, Pennsylvania Child &amp; Youth Services notified Collin's mother, Kate, 45, that they had launched an open investigation. </p>

<p>Kate gave a scathing attack on Jon, which the magazine printed in their article.</p>

<p>The former couple have previously fought over their son, as Jon once lambasted Kate for sending Collin away to a special needs institution when he didn't suffer from anything more serious than common ADHD.</p>

<p>In an interview with DailyMailTV from September 2019, Jon claimed that his ex-wife Kate mentally tortured Collin and his sister Hannah. </p>

<p>Jon claimed that while Collin was 'caged' for three years at the institution, his mother only visited him three times for less than two hours total, all while refusing to tell Jon where Collin was being kept. </p>

<p>'Enough is enough': Kate Gosselin provided a full statement to a magazine about the alleged incident </p>

<p>However, PEOPLE claims that a report from the CYS, describes an allegation of 'causing bodily injury to a child through recent act/failure to act: hitting/punching.' </p>

<p>While Jon is not specifically named in the report, the details are consistent with the claims made by Collin on his Instagram last week. </p>

<p>Last week, in a now-deleted Instagram post, Collin accused his father Jon of physically beating him. The alleged altercation is said to have taken place when Collin was upset in the car with Jon. </p>

<p>Feeling good: Collin Gosselin, 16, updated his followers earlier this month with a selfie of his new haircut and said he was 'better than ever'</p>

<p>According to PEOPLE, Collin's deleted post read: 'Yesterday he beat me up and thought nothing of it, he punched me in the face and gave me a swollen nose and I started bleeding. He then continued to kick me in the ribs after I was on the floor. He is a liar.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a statement to PEOPLE, his mother Kate said: 'You do not punch and kick your children. You do not kick a child. I don't want to hear any excuses from anyone, not from his father, not from local law enforcement, not from court personnel whose job is supposedly to ensure the best interests of my children.' </p>

<p>'There is a child abuse law, PA 23, section 8i states that doing any of the following, regardless of whether it causes injury, is child abuse, and first on that list is kicking. Period.'  </p>

<p>Family time: Jon Gosselin, 43, enjoyed a quick vacation to Florida last month with his girlfriend Colleen Conrad and two of his eight kids, Collin and Hannah</p>

<p>She added that she no longer wants Jon to be near her children, saying: 'I don't want my children around him. Enough is enough.'</p>

<p>However, Berks County District Attorney John Adams told PEOPLE that Jon may not face any legal ramifications, as there were 'no charges or citations filed.' </p>

<p>Kate added to the publication that this response made her 'sick to her stomach' and said, 'I do not want this buried, swept under the rug or minimized.'</p>

<p>Interestingly, earlier this month Collin posted a positive message on his Instagram account saying he was doing 'better than ever' adding, 'Life is too great to not enjoy! #livelikeitsyourlastday.' </p>

<p>Jon was recently seen last month with Collin on a family getaway with his girlfriend Colleen in Florida. </p>

<p>In happier times: Jon and Kate divorced in 2009 after 10 years of marriage, and found huge fame thanks to their reality series Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8</p>

<p>Collin - who spent some time away from his family in a special needs school - has been living with his father full-time since February 2018, along with his sister Hannah.  </p>

<p>The other four sextuplets: Alexis, Aaden, Joel and Leah, and twins Mady and Cara, 19, live with their mother, Kate. </p>

<p>Jon and Kate divorced in 2009 after 10 years of marriage, and found huge fame thanks to their reality series Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8. </p>

<p>The former couple first welcomed their twins in 2001; the sextuplets followed in 2004. Most recently Kate starred in the reality dating series, Kate Plus Date, in 2019.</p>

<p>Kate added to PEOPLE in her scathing attack of Jon: 'I have always parented with my children's best interests in mind. He parents to make himself look good. It is so sick it makes my blood boil.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I am horrified that this man is the father of my children. I don't want my children to be associated with someone who loses his mind because his car got dented.'</p>
