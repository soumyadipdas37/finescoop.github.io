<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former NSW RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has turned his attention to helping traumatised children amid the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Mr Fitzsimmons is the new charity patron of children's mental health organisation KidsXpress, which aims to minimise the impact of childhood trauma. </p>

<p>The father-of-two was praised for his empathy and calmness while leading the RFS through the devastating 2019/20 bushfire season before stepping down in April. </p>

<p>He is now the head of Resilience NSW, a new government agency focused on disaster preparedness and recovery approach. </p>

<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Fitzsimmons said he was 'humbled' to be the charity patron for KidsXpress.  </p>

<p>'Children are our most valuable asset, they're also the most vulnerable in the community and they're our future and tomorrow,' he said. </p>

<p>'So to be invited to an organisation that's dedicated and devoted to improving the lives of children is a truly special thing to be a part of.'</p>

<p>The former RFS commissioner saw first hand how the bushfires traumatised children and has noticed similar patterns of loneliness and isolation amid the pandemic.</p>

<p>'NSW has been on its knees with drought, we had the biggest bushfires in the history in the state, we saw floods and now COVID has affected all of us,' he said. </p>

<p>'People in rural NSW have been affected by all four of those disasters. </p>

<p>'And kids are aware of everything, they find out from TV or online, there's no hiding anything from them. We need to accept the fact that kids are part of tragedy, trauma and disasters.' </p>

<p>Mr Fitzsimmons, who has two adult daughters, called for parents to have conversations about trauma and mental health with their children. </p>

<p>'There's no shame in saying 'I'm affected by this'. Adults need to have these conversations with their kids in these COVID challenging times,' he said.   </p>

<p>He recalled 'one of the most beuaful aspects of humanity' when the the RFS was inundated with thank you letters and drawings from children during the bushfires.  </p>

<p>'I cannot tell you how many cards we received from kids expressing their gratitude, saying they were sad that people were losing their homes,' he said. </p>

<p>'You may not be able to read everything but the way kids draw says something quite profound about what they're feeling.'    </p>

<p>Children aged 4 to 12 draw, sing, act and play as part of expressive therapy at charity KidsXpress, which uses creative outlets to tackle trauma in kids. </p>

<p>KidsXpress CEO and Founder Margo Ward said expressive therapy is 'proven to be the safest way of helping children'.  </p>

<p>'It allows them to externalise their feelings. You might not be able to read the words, but you can definitely understand the pictures,' Ms Ward told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'It's confronting to put children and mental health in the same sentence but it's something we have to do at KidsXpress. </p>

<p>'What's really important is we employ highly trained and experienced specialists. What we do is really creative and playful but still very serious.' </p>

<p>Ms Ward also said she was 'honoured' to have Shane on board.    </p>

<p>'The Commissioner's support has come at a critical time as we are being called on more than ever to support children and their caregivers,' she said. </p>

<p>KidsXpress recently started their 'Adopt a school' support program, which many schools now consider an essential service amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
