<p>Hudson-Odoi was part of the senior set-up at the previous camp in November, starting a 4-0 win in Kosovo but has now returned to the junior level.</p>

<p>Boothroyd praised the Chelsea winger’s attitude after a conversation on arrival at St Georges’ Park on Monday, ahead of two European Championship qualifiers against Kosovo and Austria, starting on Friday.</p>

<p>Aidy Boothroyd has urged Callum Hudson-Odoi to force his way back into the England squad</p>

<p>‘He’s very positive, he knows what he has to do to get to the seniors, what he has to work on in his game,’ said the Under 21 manager.</p>

<p>‘It’s over to him now to show what he’s all about, to show the qualities that got him into the senior team and Chelsea’s team in the first place.</p>

<p>Boothroyd backed Hudson-Odoi to return to senior squad after dropping down to Under 21s</p>

<p>‘It’s not a straight road for young players when they burst on to the scene. It’s more like a country road. You never know what’s round the corner.</p>

<p>‘That’s why we have this level because it is a feeder and players have to gain experiences before they are ready for the seniors.’</p>

<p> England Women will travel to play Germany on October 27 in their first match since March. The teams met last November in front of a record 77,768 fans but this one will be behind closed doors.</p>
