<p>Incredible: Love Island's Anna Vakili, 30, proudly flaunted her incredible curves as she posed for a sizzling snap during her sunny getaway to Dubai</p>

<p>With the water lapping around her legs, the star pulled her wet raven tresses away from her face as she struck a sultry pose.</p>

<p>Hinting she'd shared the snap to please her mystery boyfriend, Anna penned the caption: 'He loves me like damn.'</p>

<p>Confident: Earlier this month Anna told MailOnline she is yet to lose the weight she gained in lockdown, after admitting she initially lost 1.2 stone at the start of the pandemic</p>

<p>Earlier this month Anna told MailOnline she is yet to lose the weight she gained in lockdown, after admitting she initially lost 1.2 stone at the start of the pandemic before putting it back on months later.</p>

<p>Speaking alongside her sister Mandi, she said: 'At the beginning of lockdown, I lost loads of weight and was looking really great, but I ended up putting it all back on, even more. It was so up and down, I'm an emotional eater. </p>

<p>'I haven't lost it again as I've been so busy with the campaign. I tried to work out last week, but... it's all about finding the balance.'</p>

<p>No rush: She said: 'I haven't lost it again as I've been so busy with the campaign. I tried to work out last week, but...it's all about finding the balance'</p>

<p>On dealing with body image and confidence issues in the public eye, reality star Anna added: 'We've definitely had issues with body image. If I was to say that we didn't, it would be a lie. </p>

<p>'A lot of women go through different stages in their life where they might feel a bit insecure or extra confident. We always pick ourselves up and be confident in our own skin.' </p>

<p>Anna - who has been subjected to abuse from cruel trolls - insisted she's developed thick skin to the naysayers as she said: 'It's really important to talk to someone, we have each other. At the moment we deal with it much better.</p>

<p>'I guess this sounds bad, but I'm immune and desensitised to it now. Mandi is always there for me. When it comes to her, she's rarely affected, she's that bad b***h who doesn't care about things like that. </p>

<p>'I feel like it's made me stronger and I've built up resistance to these trolls. Now someone can be like ''you're fat'' and I would laugh it off.' </p>

<p>Defiant: Anna - who has been subjected to abuse from cruel trolls - insisted she's developed thick skin to the naysayers</p>
