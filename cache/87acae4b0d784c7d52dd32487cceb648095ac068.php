<p>It comes after Lizzo told Marie Claire Australia earlier this month she was 'very nerdy' growing up because she was terrified of 'eternal damnation'.</p>

<p>The Good as Hell hitmaker - whose grandparents founded the Pentecostal Christian church the Church of God in Christ - had a 'very evangelical' upbringing with lots of strict rules in place.</p>

<p>She said: 'I had a very evangelical upbringing based on evangelical beliefs, we couldn't wear pants to church because they were the devil. </p>

<p>Glittering girl:  She amped up the drama with blue eyeshadow and glittering silver gems</p>

<p>Listening to rap, pop and R&amp;B and even going to the movies was forbidden, they were all the devil, so I only listened to gospel music. I was very nerdy in Detroit. I was so scared of eternal damnation.</p>

<p>In her spare time, the star would read the bible. Even now, Lizzo prays backstage with her team ahead of each show and finds her faith helps her to cope with the 'savage' side of the music industry. </p>

<p>The Truth Hurts singer's father bought her first flute and she was grateful he was always supportive of her.</p>

<p>She added to the publication: 'My dad encouraged me so much. He genuinely believed in me, he wanted me to be a successful flautist and to play the national anthem at a baseball game.'</p>

<p>But Lizzo dropped out of university after securing a scholarship thanks to her musicianship when her father sadly passed away.  </p>

<p>Working the camera: Lizzo appeared in her element as she struck a number of poses on the bed in the slinky number and also uploaded a sexy video of her in the dress on Instagram</p>
