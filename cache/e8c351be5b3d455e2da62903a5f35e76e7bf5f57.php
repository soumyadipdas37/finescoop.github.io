<p>And before that, rising star Doja Cat performed her hit tracks Like That and Say So during the MTV Video Music Awards in a skintight glowing bodysuit that gave off the impression that she was nude.</p>

<p>The Rules songstress, 24, looked at once space-age and reptilian in her performance costume, which featured metallic scales and glowing genitalia.</p>

<p>On Sunday: Rising star Doja Cat performed her hit tracks Like That and Say So during the MTV Video Music Awards in a skintight glowing bodysuit that gave off the impression she was nude</p>

<p>She also wore a mane of phosphorescent green hair that flowed back over her shoulders.</p>

<p>The controversial singer delivered her raps and rhymes with an insistence reminiscent of Nicki Minaj, as she engaged in interesting dance moves that seemed robotic.  </p>

<p>Doja was aided in her stage show by backup dancers in iridescent metallic suits complete with CDC-recommended face coverings. </p>

<p>Other dancers looked even wackier, in dark blue bodysuits adorned with impossibly long thorns protruding from the back. </p>

<p>Best New Artist: Later, Doja accepted her Best New Artist accolade in a somewhat tamer getup, that nonetheless featured an endlessly long braid of hair</p>

<p>Low neckline: For her victorious moment, the Boss Bitch diva donned a tasseled bright crimson minidress</p>

<p>If you're going to attend the MTV Video Music Awards, you might as well make a statement, which is exactly what Doja Cat did this weekend.</p>

<p>Well, it's a good job she did get dressed up in this sparkling Versace number as she won the PUSH Best New Artist winner, so she really got to show off.</p>

<p>Modelled by Irina Shayk on the spring/summer '20 catwalk the red chainmail dress is designed with a fringed hem, deep-v neckline and tropical-inspired embellishment.</p>

<p>We only wish we could snap up the dress for our own events, but sadly it's unavailable. However, it's worth clicking (right) to discover the designer's latest collection.</p>

<p>Or why not steal the show in a dress from our picks that'll set you back as little as £19.99. All you need to complete the look is a towering pair of heels and a little bling!</p>

<p>For her victorious moment, the Boss Bitch diva donned a tasseled bright crimson minidress.</p>

<p>The garment boasted a deeply plunging neckline, but the focus remained Cat's braid, which skimmed her ankles. </p>

<p>Great backup dancers: For her performance, she also wore a mane of phosphorescent green hair that flowed back over her shoulders</p>

<p>When she accepted her Moonperson award: The focus remained Cat's braid, which skimmed her ankles</p>

<p>The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event. </p>

<p>The first VMA ceremony was held in 1984 at New York City's Radio City Music Hall, where Madonna performed her hit Like a Virgin wearing her iconic wedding gown/bustier combination.</p>

<p>The Video Vanguard Award has been awarded to 34 acts, and was renamed the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award in 1991, after he previously won the 1988 trophy.</p>
