<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Abbie Chatfield has been forced to pull an episode from her tell-all podcast, after a former boyfriend withdrew his consent for her to discuss their relationship.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 25-year-old claimed her ex 'won't let' her post the hour-long installment of her podcast It's A Lot, which would have included deeply personal details of their relationship and break-up.</p>

<p>The episode was set to be the second part of a two-part special. The first, which remains available online, saw Abbie discuss her ex using the pseudonym 'Barry', and claim that she was ghosted, controlled and 'gaslighted' during their relationship.</p>

<p>Upset: Former Bachelor star Abbie Chatfield (pictured) revealed on Tuesday that she had been forced to pull an episode from her tell-all podcast, after an ex-boyfriend withdrew his consent for her to publicly discuss their relationship</p>

<p>'This week, I was supposed to have out the second half of "The Ex-boyfriend That I Love" episode,' the Bachelor star said in a brief update on her podcast channel.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, despite giving me prior consent and despite giving me ongoing consent to leave up part one, he and I spent all of the better half of this week on the phone, talking about how he doesn't want to the second part up.</p>

<p>'Bit annoyed. Wish I'd have uploaded it all in one go. It was a lot of work, as well, which I was upset about.'</p>

<p>In the first episode, Abbie had claimed that she and her ex had broken up and got back together about '17 times' over a two-year period.</p>

<p>Abbie was in a constant spiral of heartache during their tumultuous romance, but claims her ex did apologise to her after listening to the first episode.</p>

<p>Devastated: Abbie said she was upset by the decision, after fans had told her the first episode in her planned two-part series had 'helped' them process their own traumatic break-ups</p>

<p>She added that the first episode had triggered many responses from fans saying it had 'helped' them process their own traumatic break-ups.</p>

<p>Abbie continued: 'But, I worry about him - unfortunately, first and foremost. I think it was confronting for him to hear what he actually did.</p>

<p>'I got the most sincere apology that I'd gotten over the years. So that was good. But unfortunately, I can't release part two because he won't let me. So, I'm not going to.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I'm just feeling a bit sad about it. I felt like it was my chance to have a cathartic moment about it. </p>

<p>'Unfortunately some people in Brisbane are more interested in their reputation than they are about the truth.'</p>

<p>Furious: When a fan on Instagram Stories said the episode 'was supposed to be a cathartic experience' for Abbie and her ex had taken that away from her, Abbie responded: 'I wish I could release it without a defamation suit'. She later said that while the claims in her podcast were true, she couldn't prove them in court</p>

<p>Abbie later took to her Instagram Stories to respond to fan messages surrounding the missing podcast.</p>

<p>One fan wrote that the episode 'was supposed to be a cathartic experience' for Abbie, and said the podcast 'was meant to be for you and reclaiming your power'.</p>

<p>Abbie swiftly responded: 'I wish I could release it without a defamation suit lol.'</p>

<p>When another fan pointed out that defamation requires that the information is false, Abbie responded: 'But I must prove that it's true. And I don't have material evidence that will hold up in court.'</p>

<p>'Can't exactly prove it': Abbie later shared a post saying she 'couldn't prove' a specific claim relating to a deeply personal matter, which would mean her ex could sue her for defamation</p>
