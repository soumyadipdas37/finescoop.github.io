<p>'Telling someone they’re too skinny isn’t OK': Love Island's Molly Smith hit back at bodyshamers on Instagram after sharing lingerie snaps and reading the comments </p>

<p>She penned: 'I’ve had a few comments about being "too skinny" ... that I need to eat more etc ... I’ve actually never been so healthy.</p>

<p>'Telling someone they’re too skinny isn’t OK, no one knows the background of that person.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I work hard at the gym and enjoy my workouts and PT’s with <?php echo e('@'); ?>zakmason__ (even though I annoy him) and I’m so appreciative of how hard he pushes me and helps me.</p>

<p>Comparisons: She also shared a couple of pictures of her strong and toned body after working with a personal trainer</p>

<p>Her words: Molly quite rightly said that people should think twice before commenting on her appearance and insisted she has never eaten more than she does right now</p>

<p>'Also <?php echo e('@'); ?>francisdiet has helped me to understand food and maintain a healthier lifestyle - I’ve actually never eaten so much.' </p>

<p>Molly's post came after she shared a picture of herself wearing orange lace lingerie from inside her home. </p>
