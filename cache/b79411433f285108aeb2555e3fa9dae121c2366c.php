<p>The model turned the streets into her runway as she confidently strutted before making her way into her accommodation.   </p>

<p>Joan is currently taking part in Milan Fashion Week, after wowing during London's virtual event last week.  </p>

<p>Milan is only one of the four fashion capitals that is hosting the catwalk showcases with a few adjustments in light of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Stunner: Joan oozed confidence as she strutted down the street amid downtime from the catwalk </p>

<p>The city is hosting 23 shows over the next five days- a move which sets them apart from New York and London, who have both held virtual fashion weeks.</p>

<p>Paris has 20 scheduled shows planned next week but coveted guestlists have been reduced dramatically, in keeping with strict socially distancing guidelines.</p>

<p>Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Back in February, Georgia Armani cancelled his show in Milan as the virus began to sweep through the country. </p>
