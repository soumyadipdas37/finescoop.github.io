<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Using a cheesy chat-up line is the oldest trick in the book when it comes to dating - but there's always a chance it could instantly offend the recipient.</p>

<p>And these hilarious screenshots, collated by Bored Panda from across the world, show that some sassy singletons are always prepared with the perfect withering put-downs.</p>

<p>Instagram account Tinder Nightmares rounded up the selection of brutal replies sent by users fed up with cheesy chat-up lines and X-rated suggestions.</p>

<p>One example included a woman, who when asked if she wanted to 'hook up' with a hopeful suitor, replied: 'I know there are 26 letters in the alphabet but I'm having a hard time remembering the two after M. Could you help me out?'</p>

<p>Despite the answer to his chat-up line being 'no', the man admitted it was 'the most creative way he'd been turned down'.   </p>

<p>Despite being turned down, this dating hopeful couldn't help being  impressed by his match's response when he tried to suggest a hook up </p>

<p>Quick maths: This anonymous suitor had his hopes destroyed after calling his Tinder match only a nine out of ten, and she was quick to deliver a brutal reply</p>

<p>Candid: One person kept it very real when replying to one X-rated message</p>

<p>Poetic justice: This was a brutal but straight-talking response to someone who felt it was OK to send an X-rated message in the form of a riddle</p>

<p>This anonymous person was quick to reply to an unwanted message with a withering commentary on their suitor's intelligence </p>

<p>Early bird doesn't catch the worm: This anonymous man's attentions were unwanted when he started sending messages at 6:52am</p>

<p>This American Tinder user's X-rated message was extremely unwelcome, with the recipient admitting that she would be sharing the text with her friends and laughing at it </p>

<p>That's what you get for being smart! An attempt at suggesting sex via emojis met with a rather threatening repsonse </p>

<p>Dating pro tip: If you send an explicit message, prepare to receive a withering putdown that questions the size of your manhood  </p>
