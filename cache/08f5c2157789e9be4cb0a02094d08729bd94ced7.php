<p>An idyllic wooden hut on the sandy peninsula of Mudeford, Dorset, is being sold for an eye-watering £330,000.</p>

<p>Whereas an isolated timber cabin overlooking the Irish Sea on the Cumbrian coast has been snapped up for a mere £3,000.</p>

<p>The striking difference in value appears to lay bare the well-chronicled North-South divide, a thorny issue in Britain.</p>

<p>Although the humble Cumbrian cabin's aesthetics are more modest than the pretty beachfront Dorset hut, it has fetched a 100 times less from an anonymous buyer.</p>

<p>Two beach huts with gorgeous sea views have both gone on the market - but there's a gulf in price. An idyllic wooden hut on the sandy peninsula of Mudeford, Dorset, (left) is being sold for an eye-watering £330,000. Whereas an isolated timber cabin (right) overlooking the Irish Sea on the Cumbrian coast has been snapped up for a mere £3,000</p>

<p>Located just outside the village of Silecroft, the 6ft by 13ft timber hut is surrounded by a 1,000 sq ft stock-proof fence.</p>

<p>It does not have running water or electricity but provides opportunities for a revamp if the owner wishes to deck it out with home comforts.</p>

<p>However, like many beach huts, one is not allowed to spend the night. But it still attracted a flurry of interest from potential buyers when it went on the market with H&amp;H Land &amp; Estates. </p>

<p>Katie Hunter, chartered surveyor for H&amp;H Land &amp; Estates, said: 'This is a really unusual and exciting property, offering so much for such a reasonable price.</p>

<p>'In the area there are a number of beautiful coastline walks, in both northerly and southerly directions, and the beach hut itself offers a lot of potential to upgrade and modernise, subject to planning permission.</p>

<p>'Given the year we have all had and the way Covid-19 has affected many people's lifestyle choices, we always expected this beach hut to tick so many boxes for those seeking outdoor space in peaceful, scenic settings.'</p>

<p>Number 216 beach hut is kitted with hot water, a gas cooker and a fridge freezer run off solar panels on the roof. The blue structure can comfortably sleep four people and has a mezzanine level accessed via wooden stairs</p>

<p>Its asking price of £330,000 would be enough to buy a detached three-bedroom bungalow in Cumbria, complete with stunning country views</p>

<p>But despite the evident attraction of the cabin, it sold for a fraction of the asking price for the Mudeford hut.   </p>

<p>The remote strip of land in Mudeford in Christchurch Harbour is home to about 360 privately-owned huts that have soared in value over the last 10 years.</p>

<p>The sandy spit is said to be so in demand because of its isolated location - cars are banned and it can only be reached by a 30-minute walk, a ride on a land train or a short ferry crossing.</p>

<p>However its location is not the sole reason it beats the Cumbrian cabin for price - it also does not hamstring the owner with overnight rules and lack of technology.</p>

<p>It is on the market with Denison's Estate Agents of Christchurch, Dorset. Andy Denison said: 'This year we have seen a rise in the beach hut sale prices of around 10 per cent from the period of 2019.</p>

<p>'Continue demand drives the prices up although, as the season starts to close down, the heat in the market has been lifted.</p>

<p>'Why Mudeford Spit? It is a place to escape and offers a simple way of living.</p>

<p>'This year has seen more and ore people working remotely and they have more time to enjoy the beach life.'</p>
