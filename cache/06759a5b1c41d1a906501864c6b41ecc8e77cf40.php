<p>Depp recently requested a delay in their January court dates, which conflict with the filming schedule for Fantastic Beasts 3 in London.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Heard has launched a $100million countersuit, accusing her ex-husband of using trolls and social media bots in a 'smear campaign' against her.</p>

<p>She said in court documents that she's finally 'fighting back,' as she seeks to have Depp's 'frivolous lawsuit' tossed, claiming it continues his 'abuse and harassment.'</p>

<p>The documents read: 'This stream of false and defamatory accusations against Ms. Heard is all an attempt to ruin her life and career, simply because she was a victim of domestic abuse and violence at the hands of Mr. Depp, and had the audacity and temerity to finally come forward to end it.' </p>
