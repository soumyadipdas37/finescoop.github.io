<p>The presenter, 50, explained that she would repeatedly tell friends and colleagues she was 'totally fine,' even as her mental health continued to deteriorate.</p>

<p>Despite keeping her emotions hidden, Andrea added that it still 'hurt' when she began to feel friends 'pulling away,' as the panel praised her for speaking out about her breakdown. </p>

<p>Candid: Andrea McLean emotionally recalled her mental breakdown during Monday's Loose Women, as she admitted it stemmed from 'a culmination of things'</p>

<p>Andrea said: 'I had a breakdown last year it was a culmination of many things, it was death by paper cuts and it culminated last summer where I had a breakdown, burned out, at home we called it face-planting.' </p>

<p>Coleen Nolan admitted she and the rest of the Loose Women team knew Andrea was struggling, but didn't know how to help as she insisted that all was well.</p>

<p>She added: 'The problem is you weren't letting us in... we'd say ''are you alright? You can text us when you're home,'' and you said you were alright.'</p>

<p>Saira Khan agreed: 'We don’t want to say too much because we’re worried we're intruding, how do we do it.'</p>

<p>Speaking out: The presenter revealed earlier this year that she suffered a secret breakdown last summer (pictured hosting Loose Women in June 2019)</p>

<p>Difficult: Andrea told the panel that she would repeatedly tell friends and colleagues she was 'totally fine,' even as her mental health continued to deteriorate</p>

<p>Denise went onto praise Andrea for speaking out about her breakdown, stating: 'I’m so proud of you, I was so proud of you, I knew it was happening and you were frightened of what many people were going to say, but it's so good that you did...'</p>

<p>Andrea admitted that despite pushing her friends away, she still found it hard as the distance grew between them.</p>

<p>She told the panel: ' A lot of the accusations I’ve had is ''Andrea McLean she's very safe, she's very bland.'' A lot of that came from fear and stepping out of those boundaries.</p>

<p>'I think I was a Stepford wife at work. A lot of women say how are you and you say I’m fine totally fine, and you don't want to burden your colleagues.  </p>

<p>'I think for me it is a little bit hurtful when you feel people pulling away but you don't know how to get that back.'</p>

<p>Challenging: Andrea admitted that despite pushing her friends away, she still found it hard as the distance grew between them</p>

<p>Andrea took a break from Loose Women after suffering a breakdown, but did not reveal the extent of her struggles until May of this year.</p>

<p>The star has since spent a majority of lockdown writing a tell-all book about her struggles, </p>

<p>She said: 'Last year i had a breakdown, I also spent much of the following year and much of the lockdown writing about that breakdown.</p>

<p>'What that's like, it's like poking a wound. The book that I've written is the most honest and raw book i have ever written.</p>

<p>'[It incorporates] the reasons why [I had a breakdown]... It talks about domestic abuse, which I have never opened up about before, it talks about mental unwellness, and getting to that breaking point when you can't take anymore.'</p>

<p>Loose Women airs weekdays from 12:30pm on ITV. </p>
