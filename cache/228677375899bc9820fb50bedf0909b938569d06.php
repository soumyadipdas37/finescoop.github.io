<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>In their combined 69 years in management and over 2000 games Carlo Ancelotti and Roy Hodgson must have thought they had seen it all.</p>

<p>But this latest version of the handball rule will be baffling even these two veteran managerial masters.</p>

<p>Hodgson’s Crystal Palace benefitted from it last week, winning a controversial penalty given for handball against Victor Lindelof en-route to their well-deserved win at Manchester United. </p>

<p>Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin both got on the scoresheet as Everton beat Palace</p>

<p>The in-form Calvert-Lewin broke the deadlock with a poacher's finish inside 10 minutes</p>

<p>The Toffees forward was found around the penalty spot by Seamus Coleman to tap the ball in</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin celebrates his fifth goal in three games to give Everton an early lead</p>

<p>COACH: Carlo Ancelotti 7.5</p>

<p>REFEREE: Kevin Friend 6</p>

<p>MAN OF THE MATCH: James Rodriguez (Everton)</p>

<p>VENUE: Selhurst Park</p>

<p>Against Everton though, after one earlier escape, they were on the wrong end, Joel Ward being penalised to concede the penalty from which Richarlison scored the winner that made it three wins out of three to start the season for Everton for the first time since 1993.</p>

<p>After referee Kevin Friend pointed to the spot following a pitchside monitor review Ward had the helpless look on his face of a man who was not quite sure exactly what he could have done to avoid conceding a penalty or even what he can do in the box now.</p>

<p>Lucas Digne headed the ball at him from fairly close range giving the Palace right-back little time to react and get his hand out of the way. He would not have been the only one scratching his head.</p>

<p>Based on the laws, Friend’s decision was at least understandable. That, though, does not make the handball law itself right in the first place, with this awarded spot-kick the latest evidence. </p>

<p>However, Crystal Palace responded 16 minutes later as Cheikhou Kouyate netted an equaliser</p>

<p>Kouyate rose high above Richarlison to thump a header past Jordan Pickford in Everton's goal</p>

<p>Kouyate headed in Andros Townsend's corner in the first half to bring the scores level again</p>

<p>It certainly has not made things any clearer or easier for defenders.</p>

<p>The nature of Everton’s winner was the big talking point from another hugely encouraging day for Ancelotti and his side.</p>

<p>It was kickstarted by a fifth goal in three league games by Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who enhanced his claims for a first England call-up next week.</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin enjoyed a good season last term but this one threatens to be even better with him spearheading an Everton side with their tails firmly up and transformed following the summer additions of Allan, Abdoulaye Doucoure and chief string-puller James Rodriguez.</p>

<p>At this rate, both for him and this Everton side, it will not be long before he matches his 13-goal Premier League tally of last season. </p>

<p>Everton restored their lead from the penalty spot with Richarlison stepping up to take the kick</p>

<p>Referee Kevin Friend consults a pitchside monitor after the ball struck the hand of Ward</p>

<p>Richarlison stepped up to score the penalty after Friend overruled his initial call</p>

<p>Richarlison smashes the ball to his left, with Palace keeper Vicente Guaita unable to reach it</p>

<p>A drama-free 90 minutes for Jordan Pickford was also welcome for Ancelotti, whose goalkeeper has been so shaky the tactical assessment of Everton in the matchday programme even included advice for the home side that a shoot-on-sight policy might a wise approach at Selhurst Park.</p>

<p>There was no blame attached to Pickford for Palace’s goal, a towering Cheikhou Kouyate header, before Richarlison struck to settle this meeting between two sides who had both won their opening two fixtures and keep the Everton feelgood factor going.</p>

<p>After his opening day winner against Tottenham and hat-trick against West Brom it took Calvert-Lewin just 10 minutes to get off the mark at Selhurst Park.</p>

<p>He had the easy part, tapping in from close range under minimal pressure after being criminally left unmarked.</p>

<p>But the move Everton built up to create the opportunity was delightful and an indication of their development as a team under Ancelotti.</p>

<p>Andre Gomes began it just inside the Palace half with a raking ball out to the right which was kept in on the stretch by Seamus Coleman, tapped back to Abdoulaye Doucoure and then onto James Rodriguez. </p>

<p>Townsend (left) looks to close down James Rodriguez (R), who tries to send a cross into the box</p>

<p>Without any hesitation, Rodriguez, who spotted that Coleman had continued his run in behind Tyrick Mitchell, fed his captain though with a brilliantly-executed first time pass and Calvert-Lewin was waiting in the middle to apply the finishing touch. In his form, he was never going to miss.</p>

<p>Mitchell and Zaha responded with threatening moments for Palace but Everton’s confidence was there for all to see.</p>

<p>They kept and passed the ball with real intent. Whenever a player in a yellow shirt was looking to move the ball on he was rarely short of passing options.</p>

<p>Their defending for Palace’s equaliser was less impressive. From Andros Townsend’s inswinging corner from the right was headed home emphatically by Kouyate.</p>

<p>Almost inevitably, the spotlight was initially on Pickford with the header going in just above him.</p>

<p>But the Kouyate’s contact was firm, from close range and eyes should have instead been on Michael Keane for misjudging the flight of the ball and Richarlison for his feeble attempts to mark the Palace man.</p>

<p>Lucas Digne (right) dives in to make a tackle on Palace talisman Wilfried Zaha (left)</p>

<p>The Brazilian got back to his day job soon after to spearhead an Everton counter and the visitors were appealing for a penalty when Richarlison’s cross hit Joel Ward on the arm.</p>

<p>Palace escaped that when Kevin Friend said no spot kick following a VAR check in Stockley Park. Five minutes later Ward and Palace were not so fortunate.</p>

<p>When Digne attempted to head Rodriguez’s crossfield ball further into Palace’s area the ball again struck Ward’s outstretched arm, preventing it reaching Richarlison.</p>

<p>Play continued until the next break in play and this time Friend did point to the spot after re-checking the incident and Richarlison did the honours.</p>

<p>On the first occasion, Richarlison’s cross appeared to hit Ward high up on his arm which was already close to his body making the final call understandable.</p>

<p>The second gave Friend a bit more to think about with the ball hitting Ward on a left hand with his arm a little further away from his body, though he had minimal time to react.</p>

<p>Zaha is shown the yellow card for a coming together with Everton defender Yerry Mina</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin should have made it 3-1 five minutes into the second half when Palace’s defence watched and waited as Rodriguez’s corner sailed in, he reacted quickest but could only poke wide.</p>

<p>From a following Rodriguez corner, Calvert-Lewin was first to it again but Richarlison as beaten to the knockdown by Jordan Ayew who hacked clear.</p>

<p>With the game still on a knife-edge late on Calvert-Lewin had another opportunity to put the game to bed when sub Gylfi Sigurdsson’s attempted pass deflected his way, putting him through on goal.</p>

<p>Mamadou Sakho, though, got a crucial touch to distract him just as Calvert-Lewin was about to pull the trigger and the ball ricocheted kindly for Vicente Guaita.</p>

<p>But Everton held on, with all the hard work done and decisive moments coming in the first half. </p>

<p>Until next time, goodbye!</p>

<p>Kevin Friend blows his whistle for full time and that seals Everton's third win on the bounce, in what has been a very impressive start to the 2020-21 campaign indeed.</p>

<p>On the balance of play, you feel the Toffees were deserving of their win at Selhurst Park, with the visitors displaying some fantastic football with the midfield of Andre Gomes, Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure working well.</p>

<p>They took the lead through main man Dominic Calvert-Lewin who buried a great cross after a sumptuous team move after ten minutes. Palace responded through Kouyate who powered a header beyond Pickford in goal.</p>

<p>VAR drama led to Everton's winning goal, as Kevin Friend found that Joel Ward had committed handball after reviewing on the pitchside monitor, in somewhat of a harsh decision.</p>

<p>Richarlison stepped up and made no mistake from 12 yards, putting Ancelotti's side back to the top of the league table. </p>

<p>90+2 mins: Calvert-Lewin has been battling all afternoon with Palace's strong centre halves and does superbly to win a free kick just before the halfway line after drawing a foul from Kouyate.</p>

<p>90+1 min: The fourth official has added four minutes of stoppage time for Palace to find an equaliser.</p>

<p>90 mins: Palace looking tired out there now, with Joel Ward failing to find his man as his loose pass trickles behind for a goal kick.</p>

<p>Third and final change for Everton with goalscorer Richarlison coming off for Tom Davies. </p>

<p>88 mins: Allan uses his experience to bring down Zaha as the Palace captain looks to make a breakaway for the hosts. </p>

<p>Hodgson makes his final change with Jairo Riedewald replacing McArthur. </p>

<p>87 mins: Everton have a free kick cleared but retain possession as they look to kill the game with minutes remaining. </p>

<p>86 mins: Ancelotti makes his second change and it's Rodriguez who makes way for Alex Iwobi. </p>

<p>Another good showing from the former Real Madrid man this afternoon. </p>

<p>84 mins: Everton get forward again and Coleman wins a corner for his side as Mitchell knocks his cross behind. </p>

<p>Rodriguez takes and Guaita comes off his line commandingly to punch clear. </p>

<p>83 mins: Digne's free kick is cleared and Allan goes for the headlines with a wild volley from miles out. It lands in Row Z. </p>

<p>82 mins: Richarlison eases the pressure on his side, winning a free kick high up the pitch for Everton. Palace make their second change of the afternoon, with Christian Benteke replacing Jordan Ayew.</p>

<p>80 mins: Palace have around ten minutes to rescue something from this game. Everton look like they have changed their shape slightly, with Doucoure dropping deeper alongside Allan to shore up the defence. </p>

<p>78 mins: Chance Everton! Rodriguez tees up Sigurdsson, whose pass deflects off Kouyate into the path of Calvert-Lewin. The young striker hooks the ball goalwards but Guaita is across to collect.</p>

<p>76 mins: Ancelotti makes his first change, with Andre Gomes making way for Gylfi Sigurdsson. There had been a brief pause in play due to a head injury for Kouyate, but the defender is up and play continues.</p>

<p>75 mins: And that change is made now, with Michy Batshuayi coming on for Eze, who has looked bright on his first full Premier League debut since arriving from QPR this summer.</p>

<p>74 mins: Everton manage to get hold of the ball and look to offer their defenders some respite here. Palace are preparing their first substitution of the afternoon, in a bid to change the outcome of this game.</p>

<p>71 mins: Palace have a free kick on the left while VAR completes its check on that incident. </p>

<p>The ball appeared to strike the arm of Calvert-Lewin, who looked to have tucked his arms into his body when the ball was struck. Friend is advised not to give a penalty.</p>

<p>70 mins: Palace win another free kick just outside the Everton box after some unconventional defending from Mina, who brings down Jordan Ayew.</p>

<p>Eze plays it short to Zaha whose cross fails to find a Palace man. The ball is recycled and the Palace captain fires at goal and his shot is blocked by an Everton man to the appeals of Palace players, who feel it may have struck a hand.</p>

<p>67 mins: Everton progress up the pitch as Digne has time to cross on the left hand side. He lofts a ball into the box for Rodriguez to arrive onto. The Colombian hits it on the volley but has mistimed it and the attack fizzles out. </p>

<p>65 mins: Townsend picks out Kouyate at the back post and the former West Ham man looks to squeeze the ball past Pickford from a tight angle but it goes just wide. </p>

<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been starved of service the last ten minutes or so, with Everton pinned back. </p>

<p>64 mins: Everton have at times oozed class this afternoon, with Gomes, Allan and Rodriguez dictating things, but Palace are turning this into a scrap.</p>

<p>The hosts win a free kick just outside the area on the right after Mina commits a needless foul on Ayew.</p>

<p>63 mins: Ayew is played in down the left and puts a wonderful cross into the box, putting Michael Keane in plenty of trouble but there is no Palace man to put the pressure on the defender and Everton survive.</p>

<p>62 mins: Townsend hangs a ball into the penalty area and Coleman is there to clear. The ball is recycled and Ward's delivery is blocked behind for a corner. </p>

<p>A better spell here from the hosts, who have pinned Everton back.</p>

<p>61 mins: Townsend is chopped down twice and Friend blows his whistle on the second occasion and sees fit to book Richarlison for his foul on the Evertonian. </p>

<p>Ward takes the free kick from deep but overhits it and it rolls out of play. </p>

<p>59 mins: Joel Ward is the latest Palace man to go into the book for a foul on Richarlison. </p>

<p>55 mins: Good work between Richarlison and Digne earns Everton another corner. Rodriguez delivers and Calvert-Lewin is up again but Palace clear.</p>

<p>Zaha hits the visitors on the break but Doucoure makes up ground superbly to dispossess the danger man.</p>

<p>52 mins: Chance Everton! The visitors have a corner and Rodriguez sends a good ball in towards the six yard box, Calvert-Lewin gets ahead of his man but can't direct it goalwards and the ball goes wide.</p>

<p>It's been a game of corners with the hosts having one down the other end, the ball is cleared only as far as Eze but his volley balloons over.</p>

<p>50 mins: It's been a bright debut game for Eze, who drives past Allan and the Brazilian brings his man down right under the nose of Friend who awards a free kick within shooting distance.</p>

<p>Eze takes and clips it to the back post, Kouyate rises and heads but Everton win the free kick for a foul on Keane.</p>

<p>48 mins: Palace have an early set piece in this second half after a foul by Digne. Townsend to take once more. </p>

<p>It's a decent ball in and Pickford punches only as far as Eze, the youngster lines up a shot but it is blocked and cleared away.</p>

<p>46 mins: Palace get the ball rolling and the second half begins. Neither Hodgson nor Ancelotti have made any substitutes at the break.</p>

<p>Rodriguez goes down claiming he was struck by James McArthur but VAR has had a look at that and found no offence.</p>

<p>The players are back out onto the Selhurst Park turf and the second half is moments away. Can Everton make it three Premier League wins on the spin here? If they do, it will be the first time since 1993 that the club have achieved that feat.</p>

<p>Kevin Friend blows his whistle and the first half comes to an end at Selhurst Park. </p>

<p>It's been a lively first half between the two unbeaten sides, with Everton the better of the two after 45 minutes.</p>

<p>But that won't stop Palace feel a sense of injustice as to how the visitors have earned their lead. VAR intervened to punish Joel Ward after the ball struck the Palace man's arm when it appeared he had little chance to move it out of harm's way.</p>

<p>Palace had battled back into the game as a Kouyate header levelled the scored following Dominic Calvert-Lewin's early strike that capped off a great team move.</p>

<p>Plenty to play for in the second half still. </p>

<p>45+4 mins: Everton have a free kick in a dangerous area as Rodriguez is brought down by James McArthur on the edge of the area. The midfielder has been booked for that.</p>

<p>It's a tame effort from the star man and Guaita gets across to comfortably save.</p>

<p>45+2mins: Everton are vulnerable as Eze bursts forward for Palace, but the new boy makes the wrong decision and the visitors recover. </p>

<p>Ancelotti's side are keeping the ball beautifully with two minutes of the half remaining.</p>

<p>45+1min: The fourth official has added four minutes of stoppage time.</p>

<p>43 mins: Palace will have to regroup and rally a fightback now after conceding what they feel is an unjust penalty. Everton are in control of possession now as the clock ticks down towards half time. </p>

<p>Everton score! Richarlison makes no mistake from 12 yards, with a stuttered run up followed by a devastating strike into the top left corner.</p>

<p>Palace players are still fuming and Ward is remonstrating with Kevin Friend. The referee had the chance to look at it for himself but you do feel the hosts have been hard done by there.</p>

<p>Everton are awarded the penalty! Palace players look totally bemused, with Townsend heard screaming: 'No way!'</p>

<p>Richarlison to take...</p>

<p>38 mins: James Rodriguez plays a beautiful raking ball across to Digne, who controls it on his chest but Joel Ward knicks it off him.</p>

<p>Again Everton are fuming! They feel the full back has handled the ball again. VAR is checking and it does strike his arm, his arm is not tucked into his body nor does he move it towards the ball. It seems like he doesn't have time to move out of the way.</p>

<p>Kevin Friend is making his way to the monitor to look for himself.</p>

<p>35 mins: Doucoure gives the ball away again in midfield and Palace break through Zaha. He looks for a one-two with Ayew in the Everton penalty area but the flag is up for offside. </p>

<p>34 mins: There is a real intensity to this Everton side when they lose possession, but it has been matched by Palace who are showing no sign of taking a backward step here. </p>

<p>32 mins: VAR check is complete and Kevin Friend's decision stands, no penalty. It would have been harsh if Palace were punished for that.</p>

<p>30 mins: Palace are on the front foot now, and have another corner on the far side. Eze to take. </p>

<p>Keane is up to head away and Everton break through Richarlison but Palace are back superbly and the Toffees win a corner. The visitors aren't happy here, as they feel Joel Ward handballed it there. </p>

<p>VAR is checking...</p>

<p>Goal for Palace! The hosts win a corner on the break and Townsend is over to take. His ball is wonderful and Cheikhou Kouyate rises highest at the back post to power a header beyond Jordan Pickford.</p>

<p>The header was central but the power on it left the England goalkeeper with little chance of pawing it away.</p>

<p>Palace are back in the game!</p>

<p>24 mins: Everton are probing in Palace's final third now, but Palace win possession and look to break on the visitors.</p>

<p>Play is halted, though, as Kevin Friend spots Zaha kicking out at Yerry Mina. The Palace captain is booked for that, despite his protestations of innocence. </p>

<p>21 mins: Rodriguez picks up the ball on the edge of the host's box, puts a cross over and Sakho is there to knock it behind for a corner.</p>

<p>Rodriguez and Digne play it short but Palace get a foot in and the danger is averted.</p>

<p>19 mins: A loose pass from Doucoure across the midfield is picked up by Townsend. Palace work the ball towards Zaha who turns and shoots but his shot is blocked.</p>

<p>New boy Eberechi Eze was open there, the Palace captain should have slotted him in.</p>

<p>17 mins: Palace have a chance to fire back now as Zaha wins a corner on the near side. Townsend takes but his corner is overhit and no Palace man can get on it.</p>

<p>Poor from the former Spurs winger.</p>

<p>13 mins: Well then, they had a slow start last week to West Brom but Everton have got off to a flyer this afternoon. </p>

<p>The Toffees have been defensively shaky in recent years and it will be up to Palace now to pose questions to Ancelotti's side.</p>

<p>Everton take the lead! And it's a lovely flowing team goal from the visitors. They are so patient in their passing and pick their moment to pounce as Seamus Coleman is released in behind, the full back pulls the ball back and it is that man Dominic Calvert-Lewin there to bury home.</p>

<p>If ever a goal symbolised this new-look Everton, that was it. Sumptuous football.</p>

<p>9 mins: The midfield battle could be key this afternoon, with Everton showing a capability to rotate with James Rodriguez dropping deeper for the ball.</p>

<p>Michael Keane bursts forward and spreads a ball out to Coleman. The Irishman gets a ball into the box and Doucoure swivels and hits the ball directly at Guaita who saves.</p>

<p>7 mins: Both sides are looking to settle into the game here as Andros Townsend whips a teasing ball into the box and Zaha runs across his man to get a touch on it but he can't and Pickford collects.</p>

<p>3 mins: Palace skipper Wilfried Zaha has the ball at his feet and he's running at Yerry Mina, the Colombian knocks the ball behind for a corner for the hosts.</p>

<p>Everton make a meal of clearing it but Kevin Friend lends a helping hand as he deems Sakho has fouled a Toffee man and the visitors win a free kick.</p>

<p>The players take the knee in support of anti-racism and Kevin Whistle blows his whistle to get this under way. Richarlison gets the ball rolling for the visitors, who don a bright yellow kit this afternoon.</p>

<p>A minute's silence is observed before kick off in tribute to Sergeant Matt Ratana, who was fatally shot dead in an incident at Croydon police station. </p>

<p>Not long to go now until the second Premier League game of the day gets under way here at Selhurst Park. </p>

<p>Crystal Palace were superb last time out at Old Trafford, earning a surprising, albeit thoroughly deserved 3-1 win over Manchester United.</p>

<p>Everton, meanwhile, have looked a side transformed under Carlo Ancelotti, with new boy James Rodriguez linking up beautifully with young striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin. </p>

<p>Which way is this one going to go this afternoon? We'll have kick off very shortly as both sides emerge onto the turf.</p>

<p>We've already had a game full of drama this afternoon, with Manchester United snatching a last-gasp winner against Brighton through a Bruno Fernandes penalty. </p>

<p>Let's hope we get more of the same this afternoon with two sides looking to extend their 100% league record. </p>

<p>I'll never get used to this behind-closed-doors nonsense. It should still be a really quality game this afternoon though. </p>
