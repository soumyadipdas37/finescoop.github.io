<p>Sam had been attending a treatment clinic in Balmain, in Sydney's inner west, on Monday when he lost his cash and Medicare card. </p>

<p>He made a desperate plea to the Balmain Living group on Facebook and offered 'whatever favour' in return for the money.   </p>

<p>Recent cancer sufferer Sam (pictured) made a heartbreaking plea to a Facebook group after losing his last $50 note while attending a treatment clinic in Sydney's inner west </p>

<p>Sam said he dropped his money and Medicare card somewhere near Woolworths in Balmain (pictured above). He later found the card but his cash had gone missing </p>

<p>'I had been getting blood tests due to my recent battle with cancer in Balmain today,</p>

<p>'And dropped my money clip with my Medicare card and my last $50 near Woolworths or Taste Baguette,' Sam's post read. </p>

<p>'After 30 minutes of searching I found my card in the gutter on Beatie Street but not the clip and the money.'  </p>

<p>The cancer sufferer also provided the heartbreaking explanation behind why he needed the cash. </p>

<p>'If anyone found it, or knows who did, can you please let me know as I need medication with that money. </p>

<p>'I will do you whatever favour you want if you can return. And you will get really good karma,' he wrote. </p>

<p>There was an outpouring of support from residents who offered to donate money for the medication.   </p>

<p>'Sorry to hear this. If you don't find it, happy to pitch in $10. Take care. </p>

<p>Generous community members quickly offered to donate the $50 back to Sam and he said he was overwhelmed (pictured above) and couldn't stop crying from the generous act </p>

<p>'Let us know how you go and if no lucky by tonight, send me your account details,' one thoughtful commenter wrote. </p>

<p>Several other users added they would be 'happy to chip in'.   </p>

<p>Sam quickly confirmed the money in his account had already reached $50 thanks to the generous donations.   </p>

<p>'Thanks so much for the offers but I can't take money off anyone else now, it wouldn't be right. </p>

<p>'But thank you so much, it's been amazing, the generosity has overwhelmed me in the best way.  </p>

<p>'I can't stop crying. Thank you all. What an amazing community,' he wrote. </p>

<p>Other users also commended their 'wonderful community' and wished Sam 'all the best for a full recovery'.   </p>

<p>'Thank you, I'm overwhelmed and crying from everyone's generosity,' he said. </p>

<p>The cancer sufferer refused to accept offers of any extra money or help (Australian $50 note pictured above) </p>
