<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jackie O Henderson's father has called Queensland premier Anna Palaszczuk a hypocrite after she allowed AFL players into the state while everyday Australians have been turned back because of the border closure.  </p>

<p>Tony Henderson levelled the insult while speaking on the KIIS 106.5 show on Friday. </p>

<p>'The arrogance of that Palaszczuk is unbelievable,' he said.</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk has come under fire after she proudly welcomed 400 AFL players, staff and family members into the state so the season could go ahead away from coronavirus-stricken Melbourne. </p>

<p>They were given the all-clear to dodge the state's border lockdown.</p>

<p>A number of WAGs and officials have reportedly been living it up in 'hotel quarantine' - sipping cocktails while lounging by the pool at their luxury Gold Coast resort. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, ordinary Australians have been denied exemptions for medical emergencies and banned from visiting sick family members.</p>

<p>A Ballina mother, in northern New South Wales, lost one of her unborn twins because she was unable to travel the two hours into Queensland for emergency surgery.</p>

<p>Instead she had to wait 16 hours for an emergency flight and travel 750 kilometres to Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.</p>

<p>Mother Chantelle Northfield was also separated from her newborn son after giving birth at Lismore Base Hospital, in New South Wales.</p>

<p>Her son experienced difficulty breathing and was airlifted to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.</p>

<p>Ms Northfield remained in New South Wales and was unable to visit her baby without quarantining for 14 days.   </p>

<p>Mr Henderson claimed politicians like Ms Palaszczuk lacked 'moral ethics'.  </p>

<p>'It's just politics,' he said.</p>

<p>'Basically, she [Anna] had no hope of winning the next election, but now I think she will.'</p>

<p>Mr Henderson had initially been invited onto the radio show to take part in a lighthearted game of guess your father.</p>

<p>Radio host Jackie O had to listen to 10 anonymous callers and correctly pick out her dad.</p>

<p>Though the segment later took on a more serious tone when Mr Henderson was asked for his opinion on border closures in the country. </p>

<p>'Right from the word go, I said listen, just let it [COVID] wash through and we'll see who's left,' Mr Henderson said.</p>

<p>'At least we would've had an economy. When the free money stops, the world is going to stop spinning. It is unbelievable. We've got no idea what's going to happen very shortly.'</p>

<p>A regretful Jackie O added she doubted she would be able to see her family over the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>'It is crazy, because I want to see you guys,' she said.</p>

<p>'I don't even know if we're going to be able to see you guys on Christmas.' </p>
