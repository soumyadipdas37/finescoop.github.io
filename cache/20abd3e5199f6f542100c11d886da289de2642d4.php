<p>Casual: Anthea Turner, 60, cut a stylish figure as she headed to the shops on London's King's Road with her fiancé Mark Armstrong, 55, on Saturday</p>

<p>Anthea showed off her chic fashion sense by opting for a stylish nude coat along with blue ripped jeans.</p>

<p>The former GMTV host displayed her flawless complexion by going makeup free for the outing.</p>

<p>Both Anthea and Mark had clearly indulged in some retail therapy, as they headed home laden with shopping bags.</p>

<p>Anthea and Mark were scheduled to tie the knot this month in Italy, but were forced to postpone their nuptials due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>

<p>Out and about: The presenter went makeup free in a cosy nude jacket and ripped jeans as she headed home with her purchases</p>

<p>Anthea told HELLO!: 'Mark and I had planned to go out and look at venues in March and then set a date for September.</p>

<p>'Mark is from Italy, his family are from Milan, so it seemed the perfect place for us. </p>

<p>'It will be next year now. I am not even in any angst about it. When we do it, it will be small and cute, just with our close friends and family.'</p>

<p>The TV veteran was previously married to ex-husband Grant Bovey for 13 years, but the couple split after he cheated on her with a woman half her age in 2013.</p>

<p>Anthea's first marriage was to her manager, former DJ Peter Powell, in 1990, with the couple splitting up eight years later.</p>

<p>On finally finding The One, the media personality gushed about her man of 13 months, who had planned a trip to Rome for her 60th birthday: 'Mark is the absolute love of my life, we adore each other.</p>

<p>'He makes me smile every day and we are excited about our life together. Sometimes, when you are a bit older and you have lived, something tells you this is so right, you just know. </p>

<p>'People might say why do you have to get married, or why would you want to. It is because I do believe in marriage, and I can't think of a nicer person to be with for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>'I've always said I would get married again, I knew I would meet someone, that I would not be on my own. I definitely never put up the shutters to finding love again, with 'keep away' tattooed on my forehead.' </p>

<p>On hold: Anthea and Mark were scheduled to tie the knot this month in Italy, but were forced to postpone their nuptials due to the COVID-19 pandemic (pictured in September 2019)</p>
