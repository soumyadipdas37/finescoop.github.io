<p>Brisbane River City Rotary Club members Will Bassett, Brooke Thomas and four others parked their vehicles on Qualtrough Street, in Woolloongabba, in late June.</p>

<p>They then walked around the city delivering warm meals to people living rough on the streets, before returning to find they had all been slapped with $100 fines.</p>

<p>Despite asking three times to be let off, Brisbane City Council refused to take back the fines. </p>

<p>The typical two hour parking limit on the street was reduced to 15 minutes because an AFL game was being played at the nearby Gabba Stadium.</p>

<p>Brisbane River City Rotary Club members Will Bassett, Brooke Thomas and four of their peers parked their vehicles on Qualtrough Street, in Woolloongabba (pictured), in late June</p>

<p>The time change occurs whenever an event is being held at the sporting venue and applies to all the streets that fall within the 'Gabba Traffic Area', 9 News reported. </p>

<p>Mr Bassett admitted he was unaware of the time change and had regularly parked his car on the street during a food run.</p>

<p>'We thought it was two-hour parking as has been for most of the other time - but just on that day it had moved down to 15 minutes,' he said. </p>

<p>Ms Thomas said it was a blow to the gut to be punished for helping other people.</p>

<p>'I had just given up my Sunday afternoon to organise and arrange these meals and to be hit with a fine was pretty disappointing,' Ms Thomas added.  </p>

<p>Brisbane City Council said it was the responsibility of drivers to be aware of the time limits.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia contacted Brisbane City Council for comment. </p>
