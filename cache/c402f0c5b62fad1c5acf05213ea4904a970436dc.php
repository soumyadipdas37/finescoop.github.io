<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dominic Thiem erupted into a bizarre row with tournament bosses at the US Open after not being allowed to drink straight from his Red Bull can because it is not one of their sponsors.</p>

<p>The second seed marked his 27th birthday with a commanding 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over India's Sumit Nagal on Thursday, though it was somewhat overshadowed by his heated dispute with US Open chiefs.</p>

<p>Thiem was angered when he was told late into the match that his can of Red Bull had to be poured out into a plain cup away from his sight and TV cameras as the beverage company does not sponsor the tournament.</p>

<p>Dominic Thiem became embroiled in a row with US Open officials over a Red Bull can</p>

<p>Thiem was angry that tournament bosses wanted to pour it into a blank cup out of his sight</p>

<p>Footage emerged online showing world No 3 Thiem rowing with a US Open official, in which he was heard saying: 'You guys are like crazy about anti-doping and then you want to carry the Red Bull can out and you guys fill it in a blank cup.</p>

<p>'I mean what the heck is this? Just bring me a blank cup and I'll pour it in.'</p>

<p>The Austrian, who is seeking his maiden Grand Slam title, was eventually allowed to pour the drink himself while a white towel was held over him to prevent the Red Bull logo from being visible.</p>

<p>Thiem FINALLY got his Red Bull in a cup. However, the USTA-guy is doing everything in his power not to show the label. Lol. pic.twitter.com/PexGXxGJmM</p>

<p>The incident happened during Thiem's match with India's Sumit Nagal on Thursday</p>

<p>The Austrian won 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 to set up a mouthwatering third-round tie with Marin Cilic</p>

<p>Thiem admitted the incident 'p***** him off' after claiming a straight-sets victory to set up a mouthwatering third-round tie with 2014 US Open champion Marin Cilic. </p>

<p>'They wanted to go out with the open can and fill it in a plain cup without me observing it,' Thiem said.</p>

<p>'That's what p***** me off a little bit because the anti-doping rules are so strict. I don't want to lose the can out of my sight... and they propose me to fill the can in a plain cup without me observing it.</p>

<p>'That p***** me off a little bit.' </p>
