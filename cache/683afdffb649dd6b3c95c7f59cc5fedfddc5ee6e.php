<p>The woman, known by her pseudonym Xiao Qin, admitted to the incident when the authorities approached her at her workplace.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old migrant worker had moved to the eastern Chinese city from central China to seek employment last year.</p>

<p>Before leaving her hometown, Xiao Qin broke up with her boyfriend whom she dated for six months. But the woman found out that she was expecting a baby soon after arriving in Zhuji.</p>

<p>Xiao Qin decided to abandon the baby because she couldn’t afford to raise the child on her own. She then wrapped the newborn baby in the plastic bag and dumped her on the pavement just hours after the labour. The picture shows Xiao Qin visiting her daughter at the hospital</p>

<p>Worried about the reaction of her family and friends about her being unmarried and pregnant, Xiao Qin kept the news under wraps. She also wore baggy clothes to work so that her colleagues wouldn’t find out.</p>

<p>On August 15, Xiao Qin’s water suddenly broke while she was working at the factory. She asked her boss for a day off and rushed back to her rented flat.</p>

<p>The young mother eventually gave birth to her daughter at home. She even cut the umbilical cord by herself using a folding knife.</p>
