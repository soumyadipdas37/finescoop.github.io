<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Carol Burnett and her third husband Brian Miller have been granted temporary guardianship of her teenage grandson Dylan.</p>

<p>Court documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and dated Tuesday showed that they have been appointed temporary guardians of 14-year-old Dylan through January 8, 2021, according to an article by People.</p>

<p>'The Court finds that sufficient evidence has been provided to grant the matter on calendar this date based upon the reading of the moving papers and consideration of all presented evidence,' court documents said.</p>

<p>Stepping in: Legendary comedian Carol Burnett and her third husband Brian Miller, shown in January, have been granted temporary guardianship of her teenage grandson Dylan Joseph Hamilton</p>

<p>'Temporary guardians have the authority to change Dylan's school and housing pending the next hearing date,' the court papers also said.</p>

<p>Burnett, 87, and Miller two weeks ago sought the court's approval to be appointed as the boy's temporary guardians as her daughter Erin Hamilton copes with substance abuse issues.</p>

<p> Her petition claimed that 'The LAPD placed Erin on a 51/50 hold for suicidality and drug use [in July]'.</p>

<p>'Throughout her adult life, and since Dylan's birth, Erin has suffered from severe substance abuse and addiction issues. Dylan's living environment has long been unstable, unpredictable, and unhealthy for a child,' her petition added.</p>

<p>Substance abuse: The 87-year-old actress - who's an Oscar away from EGOT status - did so because her youngest daughter Erin Hamilton (L) 'recently threatened to take her own life and has been in and out of rehab eight times' (pictured in 1993)</p>

<p>The 52-year-old singer, who was crowned Miss Golden Globe 1993, was released from Chino Hills Hospital on July 24.</p>

<p>Dylan's father Kurt West has been in rehab, and the boy's situation became so troubled the Department of Children and Family Services conducted investigations in 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>The married couple of 18 years have financially supported Dylan his entire life including his boarding school, medical/dental insurance, and housing expenses.   </p>
