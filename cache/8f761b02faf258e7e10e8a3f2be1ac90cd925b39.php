<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>In the absence of any Ryder Cup this week, the three Englishmen left in the US Open had to settle for glamour match-ups in the final round on Saturday that would have represented a good rehearsal.</p>

<p>Paul Casey got to walk the fairways with world No 1 Dustin Johnson.</p>

<p>Lee Westwood’s playing partner was Tony Finau, while Matt Wallace had Rickie Fowler for company.</p>

<p>The Brits in the US Open faced matches that would have helped their Ryder Cup preparations</p>

<p>Dustin Johnson was the opponent of Paul Casey, with the world No 1 coming in as favourite </p>

<p>What they had to play for, though, was a world away from the tension of the biennial dust-up.</p>

<p>For Johnson and Casey, what a contrast to the excitement they felt going into the final round of the last major, the USPGA Championship, where the pair ended up tied second.</p>

<p>Johnson came into this event as the hot favourite but there was always the worry he would run out of steam after a 2-1-2-1 run in his last four events and so it proved.</p>

<p>Credit Johnson, who showed plenty of professionalism and pride and to finish with a 70. So did Casey, who had a roller- coaster week, opening with rounds of 76-70 and then two nines of 39-30 on Saturday, before finishing with a 73.</p>

<p>Lee Westwood impressed, with the 47-year-old performing once again in his suited major </p>

<p>One up to America, if you like.</p>

<p>What a fine week Westwood enjoyed in his first tournament in the US since March.</p>

<p>The US Open was always the major that most suited his magnificent long game.</p>

<p>He might have been frustrated with his second round 76 but a second successive 72 on Saturday gave him a top-20 finish, which was highly creditable given he is now 47. Finau, however, pipped him by one.</p>

<p>As for Wallace, it was in New York last year that he delivered his finest major display to date, finishing third in the USPGA at Bethpage. He will be disappointed with a last round 77 to finish outside the top 40, although he did beat Fowler by two shots.</p>
