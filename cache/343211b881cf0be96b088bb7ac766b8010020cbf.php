<p>TV viewers were moved when Jim Radford, of south London, performed his ballad The Shores of Normandy, which reached the top of the charts last year</p>

<p>Radford was granted conditional bail to appear before Caernarfon Crown Court on October 5. </p>

<p>His lawyer Mark Bagshaw indicated he would deny the allegations.</p>

<p>Radford received a standing ovation when he performed at the Royal Albert Hall to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the invasion of France. </p>

<p>In 1944, he was a 15-year-old 'galley boy' with the Merchant Navy and probably the youngest to take part in the landings.</p>

<p>On the morning of June 6, his first deep sea trip took him to Normandy to help build the Mulberry Harbour, allowing the Royal Navy to transport personnel, vehicles and supplies on to the beaches as the liberation began of Western Europe from the Nazis.</p>

<p>In October 2015 the singing peace campaigner was appointed a Chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur by the French Republic 'in recognition of his steadfast involvement in the Liberation of France during the Second World War.'</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Sir Rod Stewart had been among those to praise his song.</p>

<p>Sir Rod tweeted : 'If this doesn't pull on ya heart strings, nothing will. 'On The Shores of Normandy' sung by Jim Radford, one of the surviving heroes of WWII. God Bless Him. - Rod xx'</p>
