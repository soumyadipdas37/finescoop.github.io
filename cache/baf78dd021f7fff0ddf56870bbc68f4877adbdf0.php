<p>'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.</p>

<p>'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand.</p>

<p>'So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?' </p>

<p>Gemma then brazenly stuck up two fingers to the camera with both hands before saying it had been 'amazing' looking back at the reality show that made her a household name.</p>
