<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australia's Deputy Prime Minister has demanded state leaders open their borders in time for Christmas. </p>

<p>Michael McCormack said it's 'not good enough' that Australians still can't travel within the country despite daily coronavirus cases continuing to plummet. </p>

<p>'We want the Premiers of those states who have still got very tight lockdowns to ease those restrictions,' he told Sunrise on Monday.</p>

<p>'People want to travel, particularly as we approach the warmer months where people want to go on holiday and they want to catch-up with their loved ones over Christmas.</p>

<p>The federal government is extending subsidies for airlines operating flights between capital cities and regional towns. Pictured: Passengers leaving Sydney for Adelaide on September 24</p>

<p>Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack told Sunrise it's 'not good enough' that Australians still can't travel within the country despite daily new coronavirus cases continuing to plummet</p>

<p>'It's not good enough that we've got tight border restrictions that are preventing many people from travelling where they want to be around this great nation.'</p>

<p>Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania all still have 'hard' border closures in place, while Victorians must undergo hotel quarantine if they are granted an exemption to leave the state.  </p>

<p>Mr McCormack said airlines had been smashed by coronavirus lockdowns and border closures.</p>

<p>'Uncertainty affects the ability of airlines and airports to plan for recovery and undermines consumer confidence, which amounts to a significant cost to industry and ultimately the Australian economy,' he said.</p>

<p>'The federal government is doing our bit by underwriting these flights to maintain minimum connectivity.</p>

<p>'Now we need the states and territories to do their bit too as we again encourage the continued easing of border restrictions.'</p>

<p>One in four Australians travelled by air to visit friends and family every year before the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>'By underwriting key routes, we are providing the opportunity for Australians to do just that,' Mr McCormack said.</p>

<p>The federal government is extending subsidies for airlines operating flights between capital cities and regional towns.</p>

<p>Support for key domestic routes will continue until the end of January, while regional routes will be propped up until March.</p>

<p>The government has already spent $150 million helping Qantas, Virgin and smaller airlines survive the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The upcoming federal budget is expected to contain hundreds of millions of dollars in additional support.   </p>
