<p>The latest: Whitney Way Thore, 36, has spoken out about her use of the word 'fat' in an Instagram post describing herself in a childhood photo on Monday</p>

<p>The commentary began four days prior when she shared of herself in the 1980s while rocking a colorful and patterned bathing suit.</p>

<p>Whitney captioned it: 'Bringing you high fashion since 1988. But seriously, can I get this suit in size fat?' </p>

<p>Several people commented to her things like 'you are not fat... you are beautiful! as well as 'Please quit calling yourself fat!!! No BS LOVE you!!'</p>

<p> Others wrote: 'Beautiful then, beautiful now. Don't you dare smack talk yourself' and also: 'Girl.. I'm going to tell you the same thing my 11yr old tells me every time I reference myself as being fat. She says mom!, that's such a mean word, your not fat your just fluffy.' </p>

<p>Candid: Dozens of fans took to her comments and told her not to describe herself that way, but on Monday, Whitney said of the backlash: 'It's actually insulting to insist that a fat person who has identified as fat actually isn't fat'</p>

<p> Speaking out: The commentary began four days prior when she shared of herself in the 1980s while rocking a colorful and patterned bathing suit. Whitney captioned it: 'Bringing you high fashion since 1988. But seriously, can I get this suit in size fat?'</p>

<p>On Monday, Whitney shared a snap of herself in a black bikini with some of those comments surrounding her.</p>

<p>She shared a caption that said: 'A few days ago I posted a pic from the '80s and said I wanted the swimsuit I was wearing in a "size fat" and I got so many comments that I didn't expect, so here's just a little reminder that...' with four points. </p>

<p>The TLC star first said: 'It's actually insulting to insist that a fat person who has identified as fat actually isn't fat. If you try to convince me otherwise, you're simply reinforcing the notion that being fat is bad and not making any damn sense because I am obviously fat.'</p>

<p>Whitney then said for point two: 'Telling a fat person some variation of, "You're not fat; you're beautiful!/funny!/smart!/successful!" means that you have not reconciled that a person can simultaneously be fat and possess good qualities and be likable... and that's a problem for you to work out, not fat people.'</p>

<p>Her third point was: 'It's disrespectful to tell someone that the way they identify is wrong. I personally cringe myself into the either over words like "fluffy," "chunky," etc. I don't need to distance myself from the word fat. I don't need a euphemism. If it makes you uncomfortable, again, that's on you, not me.'</p>

<p>Whitney's last point was: 'For many fat people, myself included, there has been a long journey of acceptance in using the word "fat" as a descriptor like any other - short, brunette, and white are also adjectives I use to describe me and none are good or bad, they just are. Let fat people call themselves fat and recognize it isn't a put-down.'</p>

<p>She ended it with a heart emoji. </p>

<p>In May, the star chose to announce news that her fiance Chase Servino was expecting a child with someone else with a photo of a black screen and detailed caption.</p>

<p>'Chase and I are no longer engaged,' the reality star wrote. 'After experiencing a lot of ups and downs and still living apart, Chase reconnected with a woman with whom he has had a long history.'</p>

<p>She added that her former fiancé only 'recently' shared the news that his relationship 'resulted in a pregnancy.'</p>

<p>Splitting up: In May, she shared the 'weird and uncomfortable' news that she ended her engagement to Severino</p>

<p>'Chase will be a father in October,' the TCL star, who got engaged in October 2019 revealed.</p>

<p>Despite the complicated reasoning behind their split, Thore said she is 'not interested in anything hateful being directed toward anyone' and requested privacy.</p>

<p>Severino asked for Whitney's hand in marriage at the top of the Eiffel Tower, but managed to keep the news under wraps for two months. </p>

<p>Whitney's reality show My Big Fat Fabulous Life season eight debuts on Tuesday, November 10 at 9/8c on TLC. </p>

<p>Devastating: Despite the complicated reasoning behind their split, Thore said she is 'not interested in anything hateful being directed toward anyone' and requested privacy</p>
