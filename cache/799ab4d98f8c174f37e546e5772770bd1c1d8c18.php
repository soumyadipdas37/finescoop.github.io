<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The latest attempt to oust an Oxford college dean failed yesterday after he was cleared of all safeguarding allegations.</p>

<p>A Church of England investigation found that the Very Reverend Professor Martyn Percy had acted ‘entirely appropriately’ in handling abuse allegations.</p>

<p>He had faced four complaints made to the Church’s National Safeguarding Team in which he was accused of mishandling historic abuse allegations reported to him by former students.</p>

<p>Professor Percy, dean of Christ Church college and its cathedral, said his exoneration meant a line had been ‘firmly drawn’ under questions over how he dealt with historic cases.</p>

<p>It followed internal complaints against the dean in 2018, which led to his suspension and the commissioning of an independent tribunal, The Times reported.</p>

<p>Professor Percy was exonerated and reinstated a year later. But last year, a vote of no confidence was tabled against him. He lost but remained in post.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Huddersfield, Dr Jonathan Gibbs, the lead safeguarding bishop, said yesterday: 'An independent investigation into allegations that the Dean, Martyn Percy, failed to fulfil his safeguarding responsibilities has concluded the Dean acted entirely appropriately in each case.</p>

<p>'The National Safeguarding Team (NST) followed the House of Bishops guidance when the four separate allegations were referred earlier in the year relating to the Dean, a senior office-holder.</p>

<p>'At no point was there any allegation or evidence that the Dean presented a direct risk to any child or vulnerable adult.'</p>

<p>Professor Percy posted on Twitter: 'Thank you to everyone for their support and prayers. It is good to have a line firmly drawn under this.'</p>

<p>He has taken the college to an employment tribunal which is due to be heard in public next year.</p>

<p>Christ Church college said that the church's ruling showed there had been 'no breach of the Church of England's protocols'.</p>

<p>'Safeguarding is of the utmost importance at Christ Church, and it is our obligation to report such concerns appropriately,' it added.</p>
