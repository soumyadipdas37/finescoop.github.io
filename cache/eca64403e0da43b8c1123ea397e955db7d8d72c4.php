<p>The father has admitted he was trying to kill his partner of nearly two decades at their Melbourne home last year.</p>

<p>Three weeks before the vicious attack the woman had kicked her partner out of the family home after he began beating her while she was driving, hitting her eight times and pulling her hair.</p>

<p>Two Melbourne boys stepped in to stop their father trying to kill their mother after he stabbed her 25 times with a screwdriver (file picture)</p>

<p>He accused her of ruining his family. She pulled over near a police station and ran inside screaming for help, and he drove away in her car.</p>

<p>The woman let him move back into their home after he threatened to kill himself if she didn't take him back.</p>

<p>The woman tried to kick him out again on the morning of the screwdriver attack, after seeing him smoking an ice pipe in their bed.</p>

<p>'Its a pretty ugly picture isn't it of him sitting in bed sucking on an ice pipe, three kids in the house,' a Supreme Court judge said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The man repeatedly punched his partner in the face and chest. She didn't realise at the time that he was armed with the screwdriver, stabbing her with it.</p>

<p>She suffered suspected defensive wounds on her arms, trying to protect herself.</p>

<p>'Help, he's going to kill me. You're going to kill me,' she cried out.</p>

<p>He replied: 'Yes, that's what I want to do.'</p>

<p>Two of the couple's children heard the violence and tried to stop their father, holding him so their mother could run to a neighbour's home for help.</p>

<p>The man ran after her, telling her that he loved her and that he knew she'd have to call police.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said he grabbed her by the hair and demanded she look into his eyes when he spoke to her.</p>

<p>He took off before police arrived and was arrested later in the day.</p>

<p>The woman required surgery for her multiple life-threatening stab wounds and a punctured lung.</p>

<p>The judge said a scar on the woman's face would be a daily reminder of the attack.</p>

<p>'Every time your children see it, it would remind them of what they've been through,' he said.</p>

<p>A pre-sentence hearing is continuing.</p>
