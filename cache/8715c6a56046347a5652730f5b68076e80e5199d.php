<p>The Harry Potter actor, 57, even went so far as to suggest those that don't wear a mask should be 'hanged' or 'sent to the stocks'.</p>

<p>Joining Lorraine Kelly for a chat on Tuesday morning, Jason was speaking about struggling amid the pandemic and how he has recently returned to work on the set of Netflix series Sex Education.</p>

<p>Mask up! Jason Isaacs has raged about those that don't abide by COVID-19 face mask rules</p>

<p>'It’s quite hard to keep your spirits up, I’ve found it very hard. The only way is to help people.</p>

<p>'I did go to a set the other day, on Sex Education. It was great and fun and really weird.'</p>

<p>Lorraine added: 'Everybody’s got masks on and social distancing. It’s going to be hard to go back to normal.'</p>

<p>To which Jason said: 'I am less annoyed by the people who don’t wear masks, who should be in the stocks or prison, but the people who don’t wear it over their nose.</p>

<p>All or nothing: Jason found those that wore masks half on/half off a great source of his chagrin </p>

<p>'Or the people who pull it down to have a chat and then pull it back up, they should be hanging in the streets!'</p>

<p>The actor is in fact racing for Great Ormond Street, which he also discussed with Lorraine, 60.</p>

<p>'The author of Peter Pan left the rights to Great Ormond Street Hospital and it’s been one of the joys of my life to have a connection with this place. You’d be amazed what happens inside those walls. </p>

<p>Pandemic chat: Joining Lorraine Kelly for a chat on Tuesday morning, Jason was speaking about struggling amid the pandemic</p>

<p>Fuming! 'The people who pull it down to have a chat and then pull it back up, they should be hanging in the streets!' he said</p>

<p>'The charity makes sure the families and relatives are kept sane and happy and as you can imagine, during COVID, it’s got considerably worse. </p>

<p>'The charity has huge demands on it and has less money coming in so I’m here to recruit people. We’re trying to raise even more money than we normally do,' Jason explained. </p>

<p>Jason also revealed that he and his on-screen son from Harry Potter, Tom Felton, are talking about doing a podcast.</p>

<p>Reunion: Jason also revealed that he and his on-screen son from Harry Potter, Tom Felton, are talking about doing a podcast. The pair played Lucius and Draco Malfoy across the eight Harry Potter movies</p>

<p>'He’s never seen the films of his generation and I’ve never heard the music of his generation so we were thinking of doing a podcast where we force each other, cross generationally, to catch up,' Jason explained.</p>

<p>The pair played Lucius and Draco Malfoy across the eight Harry Potter movies.</p>
