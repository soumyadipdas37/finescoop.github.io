<p>'I don't think this was executed very well': Some fans took to Twitter to express their disappointment at losing the chance to scoop the haul of goods – including Louis Vuitton bags</p>

<p>'Is it just or me or was the Molly Mae giveaway kinda unfair? Cause she said to enter the giveaway do this and that which 2mil+ did but she only used the random generator on 25 ppl so only they had a chance of winning tbh.. I don’t think this was executed very well.</p>

<p>'Imagine Running a competition that millions of people enter and you can only be bothered to pick up 25 names... well your management <?php echo e('@'); ?>mollymaehague #mollymaegiveaway #mollymae #lazybehaviour  </p>

<p>'How do you get 2mil+ comments on the Molly mae giveaway but then only do the number generator on 25 people??? How is that fair? </p>

<p>Support: Others said naysayers should be grateful as they insisted the 'sweetheart' has been one of the only celebrities that have created such an impressive giveaway</p>

<p>'what a scam Molly Mae's giveaway was. nearly 3 million entries and she only picks 25 people to put in the random name generator lmfao. </p>

<p>Others said naysayers should be grateful as they insisted the 'sweetheart' has been one of the only celebrities that have created such an impressive giveaway.</p>

<p>They penned: 'Why are people moaning about how Molly Mae picked the winner Rolling on the floor laughing Stop being so sore and be happy for the girl that won ffs 2 million people entered what did you expect.</p>

<p>'Really baffles me how salty some people are about loosing <?php echo e('@'); ?>mollymaehague giveaway. 1. She did sth most celebs would never do and we should appreciate her for that 2. Be happy for someone else, it really isn’t that hard</p>

<p>'Molly Mae is such a sweetheart idc I’m still keeping my follow.' (sic) </p>

<p>The TV star stood by her further as she added in a separate post following the backlash: 'For people saying that 25 names in a generator isn't fair... we literally spent all well brainstorming the best way to pick. </p>

<p>'Film night': The loved-up pair ended their evening by watching a movie together in bed</p>

<p>'There was no software or app that would allow me to put in two million IG comments without logging in with my insta password which I would never ever do. </p>

<p>'why am I scrolling through the all the tweets about molly mae and seeing people mad that she only picked from 25 people ... like she still picked those 25 from the 2 million it’s literally not unfair lol ?</p>

<p>'Let's just all be happy for the winner please. It's only a light hearted giveaway. The 25 names had all entered more than one... including the winner. Let's be happy for her! She deserves it.' (sic) </p>
