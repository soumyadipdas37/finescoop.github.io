<p>Marketing and community manager Rosie, who was based in Singapore, styled a floral print dress with a denim jacket and white trainers.</p>

<p>Having fun: The giddy media personality wiped away her tears carefully to ensure she didn't smudge her mascara</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Lorraine detailed the pain of going through a miscarriage, insisting the loss 'never leaves you.'</p>

<p>The broadcaster took to Twitter to respond to a post by First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, who shared the story of the country's Justice Minister Humza Yousaf and his wife Nadia El-Nakla and their loss.</p>

<p>In her post, Nicola wrote: 'Brave account of miscarriage from ⁦<?php echo e('@'); ?>HumzaYousaf &amp; Nadia El-Nakla. It's an experience my husband &amp; I had just once, but it never leaves you. </p>

<p>Happy family: The broadcaster shares Rosie with her husband of 28 years Steve Smith (pictured together on holiday in India)</p>

<p>'Nadia's account of the physical pain especially sparks awful memories. We don't talk about all this enough.'</p>

<p>Agreeing with Nicola's poignant message, the TV star retweeted it and added: 'Affects far too many of us <?php echo e('@'); ?>nicolasturgeon and you are so right. It never leaves you xx'</p>

<p>In 2015, she told OK! Magazine: 'Another baby would have been super. But, hey, it didn't happen. I had a miscarriage when Rosie was about five.'  </p>
