<p>The TOWIE star, 31, told MailOnline it's 'been a rough ride' for Sam, 28, after he recently found out Zara cheated on him at the beginning of their romance.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview, Pete revealed that he believes some people 'try to pull the wool over Sam's eyes' and he's not enjoyed seeing his friend 'so down.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes I think he can be too nice': Pete Wicks has warned best pal Sam Thompson against getting back with Zara McDermott following the couple's shock split</p>

<p>Pete said: 'Sam is like the brother I never had and never wanted. He's a great guy and has a heart of gold.</p>

<p>'Although we're from different backgrounds and people assume we wouldn't get on, we do spend a lot of time with each other.</p>

<p>'He's had a rough time recently. If there's one person that is probably worse when it comes to dating than me, it's Sam Thompson.</p>

<p>'Sam overthinks everything – I have never known anyone to overthink like he does. </p>

<p>'He needs to concentrate on himself': The TOWIE star told MailOnline its 'been a rough ride' for Sam, 28, after he recently found out Zara cheated on him at the beginning of their romance</p>

<p>'Sometimes I think he can be too nice. He's made mistakes, he's made a number of them but he's a really, really nice geezer and I think sometimes people try to pull the wool over his eyes.</p>

<p>'It didn't work out for me trying to give things another go… as far as I'm concerned, what goes on between Sam and Zara isn't really my place to say until they come out and openly discuss everything.</p>

<p>'But in my opinion he needs to concentrate on himself and making himself happy. It's been a rough ride for him.</p>

<p>'It's not nice to see someone as down so as what he has been about it but he will bounce back, we all bounce back.'</p>

<p>'It's not nice': In an exclusive interview, Pete revealed that he believes some people 'try to pull the wool over Sam's eyes' and he's not enjoyed seeing his friend 'so down' </p>

<p>The reality duo spent a week living together in an apartment while filming C4 show The Circle shortly after Sam's breakup.</p>

<p>Sam used an ageing filter on Pete in an Instagram upload he shared to thank the TOWIE star for all his support.</p>

<p>But some fans were genuinely convinced Pete had turned grey and wrinkly during lockdown.</p>

<p>Pete said: 'I showed Sam an article, it said 'Sam has used an app to make Pete look several years older' – I look about 40 years older!</p>

<p>'Everyone thinks lockdown has been really tough of me! They were all saying, 'look at the state of him.' I have a complex now. I looked like a ball bag!'</p>

<p>'I looked like a ball bag!': Sam thanked Pete for all his support by posting a photo of the TOWIE star with an ageing filter, causing fans to believe he'd genuinely turned grey in lockdown </p>

<p>Pete is back on screens with the new series of TOWIE and the drama has already started to unfold between him and Chloe Sims, 37.</p>

<p>While he remains tight-lipped over the details of their fallout, Pete said so far filming has been a 'rollercoaster of emotions.'</p>

<p>He said: 'I assumed after such a long time off and lockdown that everyone would go back in a good mood and be lovely, but not on TOWIE.</p>

<p>'I don't know why I had that rose tinted view of it. It's going to be a classic series this one.</p>

<p>Friends again?: Pete is back on screens with the new series of TOWIE and the drama has already started to unfold between him and Chloe Sims </p>

<p>'An awful lot as happened': Pete says filming for the ITVBe show has so far been a 'rollercoaster of emotions' and hints his friendship with Chloe has been 'something worth fighting for' </p>

<p>'We've been filming for a couple of months and it's working slightly differently as we're doing a longer stint of filming. An awful lot as happened so far, trust me.</p>

<p>'TOWIE will kill me if I give anything away but it's been a rollercoaster of emotions so far, put it that way.</p>

<p>'For me where I am quite independent and self-sufficient, it's difficult for people to be around me much of the time because I don't give a lot away. </p>

<p>'But if something is worth fighting for it tends to come full circle.'</p>

<p>Single: Pete will turn his hand towards counselling daters alongside Love Island's Shaughna Phillips for Mike's Hard Seltzer's advice hotline – but says he still hasn't met anyone himself </p>

<p>Pete, whose ex-girlfriends include Megan McKenna and Shelby Tribble, said he's no closer to finding The One, even after his recent stint on Celebs Go Dating.</p>

<p>Instead, Pete will turn his hand towards counselling daters with their dilemmas as part of Mike's Hard Seltzer's advice hotline.</p>

<p>Pete will be answering questions from the public via the hotline on September 25 from 3-6pm alongside Love Island's Shaughna Phillips.</p>

<p>He said: 'In lockdown I didn't do any dating and it was quite nice to take a break from it to be quite honest with you. I'm getting a bit old now, it's starting to slow down a bit.</p>

<p>Lending a hand: The duo will be answering questions from the public via the hotline on September 25 from 3-6pm</p>

<p>'I have worked out this year, which is probably something I should have worked out years ago, that I do feel under pressure because you see other people in relationships and settling down who are younger ages but we're all here to run our own race, whether you meet someone in your 40s it doesn't matter if it's the right place.</p>

<p>'Eventually I will settle down but it has to be with the right person and at the right time.</p>

<p>'I've been through so much when it comes to dating that I imagine I have a lot of answers for people calling the hotline.</p>

<p>'The whole concept I like, it's quite interesting really the amount of people that do overthink when dating.'</p>

<p>Pete was speaking on behalf of Mike's Hard Seltzer, who has launched a dating advice hotline to help Brits stop overthinking their love life. Mike's Love Advice Hotline will be open to the public via WhatsApp on 25th September from 3-6pm, and Pete Wicks and Shaughna Phillips will be on hand to answer any questions </p>
