<p>The 24-year-old from Melbourne, who lost her father and sister in the disaster, had her fingers amputated and wears a full face mask to protect her healing skin.</p>

<p>In a revealing Instagram post on Saturday, Ms Browitt put her insecurities to the side in a brave attempt to share her experience with disfiguring injuries.</p>

<p>'For me personally, my back is one of the areas I struggle to feel comfortable with as the healing process continues,' she wrote.  </p>

<p>Three photographs, captured in March, April and August, showed a tangle of red and raw scar tissue covering the expanse of her back.</p>

<p>'Comparing these photos and how much my back has changed over time absolutely amazes me.'</p>

<p>'How the skin heals is astounding and seeing the changes first hand is just so interesting to me.'</p>

<p>Though her skin is slowly recovering, she explained that bending down can be difficult because the scars on her back are tight.</p>

<p>'But I'm constantly stretching and setting new goals for myself. I just have to keep pushing to be my very best self.' </p>

<p>The 24-year-old has been detailing her rehabilitation on social media to share an insight into the daily life of a burns survivor.  </p>

<p>Videos on TikTok and Youtube reveal her daily routine, which includes moisturising, stretching out her new skin and doing exercise.</p>

<p>Earlier in September, she uploaded three pictures of her legs dating back to April 27, highlighting the incredible transformation her body has gone through in her healing. </p>

<p>'My skin colour is improving amazingly and it's so exciting to see,' Ms Browitt posted.</p>

<p>Ms Browitt is among 26 survivors of the blast and now wears a face mask to protect her skin</p>

<p>'I'm also starting to find areas of my legs that have returned back to being soft and supple like skin should feel.</p>

<p>'Any sight of improvement is always a great boost of motivation for me to keep going and to stay strong and hopeful.</p>

<p>'I know that this journey has definitely made feel so grateful towards my body and what it can do.'</p>

<p>Her 21-year-old sister Krystal and father Paul were among 16 Australians who died in the blast.  </p>

<p>When first responders arrived on the scene after the explosion, Mr Browitt urged them to save his girls before coming back for him. </p>

<p>Krystal was tragically killed in the initial blast, while Mr Browitt died later in hospital.</p>

<p>Ms Browitt spent nine months painstakingly rebuilding her life and recovering in hospital.</p>

<p>She previously said she keeps wishing she could turn back time and at least have looked for her sister and father and sat with them during the aftermath.</p>

<p>'We're just picking up the pieces of our new lives and doing the best that we can do,' she said.</p>

<p>'I just want to thank everyone for your kindness, compassion and constant support. You guys manage to put a smile on my face, even if just for a second.'</p>

<p>Before the tragedy, more than 18,000 tourists would visit the White Island volcano each year.</p>
