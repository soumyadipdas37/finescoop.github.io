<p>The fundraiser was set up on a fake Facebook account under the name of Curry's husband Mark Tabone and was shared in the comments of his tribute post to the 33-year-old.</p>

<p>'Some people,' Curry wrote. 'Someone has started a Go Fund Me page on Mark Andrew Tabone's FB page … this is not us.</p>

<p>'It's also sending friend requests. PLEASE DO NOT OPEN ANYTHING FROM THIS FAKE ACCOUNT'.  </p>

<p>Australian swimming legend Lisa Curry has slammed online trolls who set up a fake fundraising account claiming to raise money for her daughter Jaimi, who died on Monday</p>

<p>Curry's ex-husband Grant Kenny announced their 'caring and loving' daughter had died at Sunshine Coast University Hospital on Monday morning</p>

<p>Jaimi passed away at Sunshine Coast University Hospital on Monday morning surrounded by her family, including both her Olympian mother and Ironman father Grant Kenny</p>

<p>Tabone, who married Curry in 2018, blasted the fraudsters as 'disgusting' and said he would be reporting the fundraiser to Facebook.</p>

<p>'Do not accept friendship or Go Fund Me, we did not do this!' he wrote.</p>

<p>Jaimi died at Sunshine Coast University Hospital on Monday morning surrounded by her family, including both her Olympian mother and Ironman father Grant Kenny. </p>

<p>Her model brother Jett paid tribute to his sister on Tuesday, admitting that while he 'may not have been the best brother' they 'loved one another unconditionally'. </p>

<p>'I may not have been the best brother to you all the time, I know you thought you weren't being the big sister I needed all the time, but I do know we loved one another unconditionally all the time,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'I will love you forever. Rest In Peace my beautiful big sister, the world lost one of its treasures yesterday but heaven gained one. You will be dearly missed by all whose lives you touched.' </p>

<p>Curry shared a statement just hours earlier telling of her family's 'unbearable' pain at the death of her 'beautiful daughter'.</p>

<p>'Our hearts are completely broken. Our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital yesterday morning with her loving family by her side,' she wrote. </p>

<p>Jaimi is the daughter of Lisa Curry and her ex-husband, Australian ironman champion Grant Kenny (who is pictured with his daughter as a baby)</p>

<p>'So loved. So beautiful. So kind to everyone... So painful. I can barely breathe. </p>

<p>Lisa's ex-husband Grant broke the news of their daughter's death on Monday evening with a public statement. </p>

<p>'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm that our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read a statement from Grant Kenny.</p>

<p>'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself.</p>

<p>'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child. </p>

<p>Grant Kenny welcomed a fourth child with radio presenter Fifi Box (right), with whom Jaimi (left) continued a close friendship </p>

<p>'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us as the extra time we were able to spend with her. </p>

<p>Jaimi was the couple's eldest child, and a sibling to sister Morgan and son Jett. </p>

<p>Curry and Kenny married in 1986 and were one of Australia's most famous couples with both enjoying individual sporting success on the world stage.</p>

<p>But after their separation in 2019, Kenny has since welcomed a fourth child with radio presenter Fifi Box, while Lisa married Elvis impersonator Mark Tabone in 2018.</p>

<p>Jaimi continued a close friendship with Box even after she separated from her father. </p>

<p>She had just turned 33 in June, with her mother taking to social media at the time to wish her a happy birthday. </p>

<p>'Our first born. Really... where have all those years gone! Have a lovely day bubba. We all love you so much,' Lisa wrote. </p>
