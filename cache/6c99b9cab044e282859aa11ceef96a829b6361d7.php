<p>Prior to her appointment to the high court, Ginsburg argued six gender equality cases before the court.</p>

<p>Markle was just one of the many voices raised up to pay tribute to the late justice.</p>

<p>Ginsburg was 'a titan - a relentless defender of justice and a legal mind for the ages,' Harris wrote in a tweet with a photo of the visit.</p>

<p>Others on the Supreme Court steps clutched candles, flowers, signs, and young children. Some appeared in running and biking clothes, on a detour from their morning exercising.</p>

<p>Mourners heralded Ginsburg's groundbreaking legal career and expressed dark worries about the future of the country.</p>
