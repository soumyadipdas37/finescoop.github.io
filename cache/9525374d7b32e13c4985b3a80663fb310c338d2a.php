<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump stayed in Paris with the U.S. ambassador to France, and then returned to Washington with three works of art taken from the residence, it has emerged.</p>

<p>The president was in Paris in November 2018 as part of the commemorations for the centennial of the end of World War I.</p>

<p>He stayed as a guest of Ambassador Jamie McCourt at the Hotel de Pontalba, a spectacular Parisian townhouse built between 1852 and 1855, which was bought by the U.S. in 1948.</p>

<p>Trump's time in Paris has been in the news this week after the Atlantic reported that he had described U.S. soldiers who died in World War I and in Vietnam as 'losers' and 'suckers', for not finding a way to dodge the draft.</p>

<p>The Atlantic also claimed he canceled a visit to a second cemetery, the Belleau Wood cemetery, because he was worried the rain would affect his hair. </p>

<p>Donald Trump traveled to Paris in November 2018 to mark 100 years since the end of WW1</p>

<p>Trump's trip has this week been overshadowed by reports that he denigrated war dead</p>

<p>However, the detail of his 'shopping trip', reported by Bloomberg, has not been previously disclosed.</p>

<p>Trump decided that he wanted to take three pieces of art from the house.</p>

<p>One was a Benjamin Franklin portrait, painted by Joseph Duplessis around 1785.</p>

<p>At the time the oil painting was produced, Franklin was the most famous American in the world, and was representing the new republic in France - where, according to the National Portrait Gallery, 'he was revered for his wit and scientific knowledge.' </p>

<p>The portrait was used as the basis of Franklin's likeness on the $100 bill. </p>

<p>Duplessis painted numerous versions of Franklin - one of which, with him wearing a red coat, currently hangs in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. </p>

<p>There are only three signed versions of the grey coat version.</p>

<p>One is owned by the New York Public Library; one is owned by the National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC; and the third was sold at auction by Sotheby's in January 2015 for $1.445 million. </p>

<p>A Benjamin Franklin portrait, painted by Joseph Duplessis around 1785, was one of the items</p>

<p>The U.S. ambassador's residence, the Hotel de Pontalba - where Trump stayed in Paris</p>

<p>The second item was a bust of Franklin.</p>

<p>Little is known about the bust, although a 2015 photo of the residence shows what appears to be a Jean-Antoine Houdon version. </p>

<p>Houdon produced his first portrait bust of Franklin in terracotta, and it is now preserved in the Louvre. </p>

<p>Subsequently, two marbles were carved - one in 1778, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and one dated 1779, sold for $3 million in 1998 to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. </p>

<p>The third item taken by Trump was was a set of figurines of Greek mythical characters. </p>

<p>Trump's decision provoked a furious exchange of emails, Bloomberg reported, as State Department and White House officials tried to work out if it was legal.</p>

<p>They concluded that it was, as the art is U.S. government property. </p>

<p>But all three were in fact replicas, it later emerged. The combined value of all three artworks - given their dubious authenticity - was estimated by Bloomberg at $750,000.</p>

<p>A bust of Benjamin Franklin, pictured inside the residence in 2015, was also taken</p>

<p>The third item was a set of Greek figurines, pictured sitting on the mantlepiece</p>

<p>The Franklin portrait was a copy, and the original was then held by the National Portrait Gallery, a mile from the White House.</p>

<p>The curators removed a different portrait of the founding father from the Oval Office and borrowed the original Duplessis from the gallery. </p>

<p>That one now hangs in the Oval, not the replica Trump ferried out of France.</p>

<p>The Franklin bust was also a replica, White House art curators concluded.</p>

<p>Trump joked that he liked the fake better than the $3 million original, two people familiar with the episode said. </p>

<p>And the Greek figurines were also deemed to be of little value.</p>

<p>They were intended to be taken for almost 500-year-old sculptures, from the 16th or 17th Century, said London-based art dealer Patricia Wengraf.</p>

<p>In fact, the set date back only 100 years or so.</p>

<p>Depicting Greek gods, they were made by Neapolitan artist Luigi Avolio, and, Wengraf said, of little value.</p>

<p>She described the figurines as '20th century fakes of wannabe 17th century sculptures.'</p>

<p>The U.S. embassy in Paris is housed inside a building bought by the U.S. in 1948</p>

<p>Trump visited American Cemetery of Suresnes, outside Paris, but refused a second cemetery</p>

<p>The White House defended the president's actions.</p>

<p>Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said he had proudly brought the pieces back to the U.S. for the nation. </p>

<p>'The President brought these beautiful, historical pieces, which belong to the American people, back to the United States to be prominently displayed in the People's House,' he said.</p>
