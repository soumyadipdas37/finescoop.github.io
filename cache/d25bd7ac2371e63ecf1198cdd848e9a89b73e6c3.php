<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Flu cases dropped by almost 90 percent in the US amid lockdowns, social distancing and mask-wearing due to the coronavirus pandemic, a new report reveals. </p>

<p>Positive influenza tests rates fell from about 20 percent between September 2019 and February 2020 to 2.3 percent between March 2020 and May 2020.</p>

<p>Results also show the number of specimens being submitted to labs declined by more than 60 percent as families sheltered in place with adults telecommuting and children remote learning.</p>

<p>What's more, interseasonal, or summer, circulation of the flu in America is at historic lows at around 0.20 percent.  </p>

<p>A new CDC report found that positive flu test rates dropped from about 20% between September 2019 and February 2020 to 2.3% between March 2020 and May 2020 (above)</p>

<p>For the report, the team collected data from about 300 US laboratories located across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>Researchers compared the time period before COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the US to the period after.</p>

<p>This was defined as between September 29, 2019 and February 29, 2020 for the pre-national emergency period and from March 1, 2020 to May 16, 2020 for the post-period.</p>

<p>In the US, flu activity started increasing around early November 2019, peaking in mid-February 2020 with 30.25 percent of test results coming back positive.</p>

<p>By early March, positive test rates fell to 14.9 percent and then decreased by about 90 percent for the four weeks that followed.</p>

<p>Overall, positive influenza test rates dropped from 19.34 percent pre-national emergency to 0.33 percent post-national emergency.</p>

<p>The number of tests being performed at labs also declined from a median of 49,696 per week before the national emergency to a median of 19,537 per week after the declaration.</p>

<p>Summer circulation of the flu, between May 17, 2020 and August 8, 2020, is at historical lows of 0.2 percent of positive tests returned.</p>

<p>This is in comparison with 2.35 percent in 2019, 1.04 percent in 2018 and 2.36 percent in 2017.</p>

<p>Similar drops were also seen in countries such as Australia, Chile and South Africa, the team found.</p>

<p>CDC researchers say they believe these low rates are due to the mitigation measures states took to curb the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>'In the United States, the COVID-19 national emergency was declared on March 1, 2020, but states began implementing a range of COVID-19 mitigation measures in late February, including school closures, bans on mass gatherings, and stay-at- home orders,' the authors wrote.</p>

<p>'In addition, some emphasis was placed on individual measures, such as mask wearing, staying home while sick, and social distancing.' </p>

<p>They stress that influenza vaccination for all people above six months old is vital to prevent flu infection, especially this season when coronavirus and flu might co-circulate. </p>
