<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One of the Government's chief legal officers has offered his resignation to Boris Johnson over the Prime Minister's controversial Brexit plans, it was claimed today. </p>

<p>Lord Keen of Elie, the Advocate General for Scotland, is said to have offered to quit amid a rumbling row caused by Mr Johnson's proposals to tear up parts of the Brexit divorce deal. </p>

<p>The resignation offer from Lord Keen, who serves as the UK Government's law officer for Scotland, is said to not yet have been accepted by Number 10. </p>

<p>There is speculation that the Government is trying to persuade Lord Keen to stay in his post. </p>

<p>The claims came after Lord Keen clashed with Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis over the legality of the Prime Minister's plans. </p>

<p>Lord Keen of Elie, the Advocate General for Scotland, has reportedly offered his resignation to the Prime Minister over the Government's Brexit plans</p>

<p>Mr Lewis told MPs last week that the measures contained within the UK Internal Market Bill will 'break international law in a very specific and limited way'.   </p>

<p>But yesterday Lord Keen said the Northern Ireland Secretary 'answered the wrong question'. </p>

<p>Speaking in the House of Lords, the peer said that the legislation does not 'constitute a breach of international law or of the rule of law'.  </p>

<p>He said: 'I have satisfied myself as to the correct legal position in this context.</p>

<p>'It is my view that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland essentially answered the wrong question.'</p>

<p>But Mr Lewis hit back this morning as he gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee. </p>

<p>He told MPs: 'I have spoken to Lord Keen and I have to say… looking at the specific question my honourable friend asked me last week, he agrees the answer I gave was the correct answer.' </p>

<p>Mr Lewis reiterated that the Government's official legal advice to ministers is that overriding key parts of the Brexit divorce deal would break international law. </p>

<p>He maintained that his assertion in the Commons last week was 'absolutely in line' with the views of top lawyers advising the Government. </p>

<p>The minister said: 'I gave a very straight answer to Parliament last week in line with the Attorney General's position.</p>

<p>'My position is absolutely in line with the legal advice that the Attorney General put out.'</p>

<p>The claims of Lord Keen offering his resignation come one week after Sir Jonathan Jones quit as Treasury Solicitor and Head of the Government Legal Profession. </p>

<p>He reportedly resigned over Mr Johnson's plans to depart from parts of the divorce accord struck with Brussels.             </p>
