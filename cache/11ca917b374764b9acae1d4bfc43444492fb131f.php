<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tradesmen have been among the hardest hit by Victoria's second coronavirus lockdown, with an estimated 13,000 of them losing their jobs across July and August. </p>

<p>A report released by consulting firm Taylor Fry revealed that employment levels across all industries in Victoria had fallen by 7.7 per cent since March when the pandemic began in Australia. </p>

<p>Construction held up comparatively well during the initial lockdown, with employment dropping by 4.5 per cent.</p>

<p>But new figures show the industry plunged by almost seven per cent during the second wave, with Victoria now under draconian restrictions that have severely cut activity on building sites. </p>

<p>Taylor Fry principal Alan Greenfield told the Australian Financial Review that the nosedive is due to tougher restrictions.</p>

<p>'Pre-pandemic, construction jobs accounted for about nine per cent of all jobs in Victoria, making it the state's fourth-largest employer,' Mr Greenfield said. </p>

<p>'The closure of hardware stores and restriction on the number of workers allowed on work sites is taking its toll.'</p>

<p>Peter Temopoulos, general manager of building and operations at Metricon Homes in Victoria, said initial restrictions only allowed workers to visit one construction site per week during lockdowns.</p>

<p>While that was increased to three sites per week after severe lobbying by the sector, the company is still limited to five on-site workers at any one time for small residential builds.</p>

<p>'For small-scale construction, they could be down to ten per cent capacity. If you were doing 20 sites per week ... and they can only do three, you're impacted greatly,' Mr Temopoulos said. </p>

<p>The capacity restrictions were imposed in early August, leaving tradesmen across the state fearful about their mortgages and providing for their families.</p>

<p>'The big dog upstairs [Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews] just letting us down once again, he's useless.' </p>

<p>Project supervisor Lee, 26, recently purchased his own home but has now had his hours cut back drastically and has been forced to turn to JobKeeper.</p>

<p>'I might not be able to eat after I pay my mortgage, I've got a car I pay for as well,' he said.</p>

<p>'Very stressful, lots of sleepless nights and I'm not the only one I'm sure of it.' </p>

<p>Master Builders Victoria chief executive Rebecca Casson said the on-site limitations resulted in extensive job losses.</p>

<p>'Our industry accounts for 45 per cent of the state's tax revenue so this scaling back with have an impact on our community,' she said.</p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews  (pictured during a press conference) acknowledged he was asking for a heavy sacrifice form the state's people</p>

<p>Upon announcing the tough restrictions on construction, Mr Andrews acknowledged he was asking for a heavy sacrifice from the state's people. </p>

<p>'Our construction sector, the lifeblood of our economy, will also move to pilot light levels,' Mr Andrews said.</p>

<p>'This will allow the industry to keep ticking — while also making sure we limit the number of people onsite.' </p>

<p>Premier Andrews had refused to provide a pathway out of Stage 4 lockdown when the six-week period expires, with industry fears it may be extended. </p>
