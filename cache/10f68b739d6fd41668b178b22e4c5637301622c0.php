<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Coleen Nolan has admitted that she is terrified of being catfished after joining four different dating apps in her search for love. </p>

<p>The Loose Women star, 55, had already signed up to one site but got serious with her pursuit of romance by joining three more following advice from her co-presenters.</p>

<p>In a chat with Ruth Langsford, Saira Khan, and Janet Street Porter on Tuesday's show, Coleen also revealed that one of the pictures on her profile is a makeup-free shot because she wants to present the real her.  </p>

<p>Finding The One: Coleen Nolan has admitted that she is terrified of being catfished after joining four different dating apps in her search for love</p>

<p>She explained: 'It's really difficult, I put this picture on because I have put other pictures on where I've got full makeup on.</p>

<p>'But I thought, actually, they'd better know me from the start.</p>

<p>She went on to discuss her fears over the catfishing, saying: 'But here's my issue - how do I know it's the real them?'</p>

<p>Advice: In a chat with Ruth Langsford, Saira Khan, and Janet Street Porter on Tuesday's show, Coleen also revealed that one of the pictures on her profile is a makeup-free shot</p>

<p>Ruth replied: 'This is the issue isn't it, I think that's why so many people are put off.'</p>

<p>Although Coleen seemed nervous about getting back out on the dating scene, Janet - who has been divorced twice - offered some words of advice, saying: 'I don't know why you are embarrassed.</p>

<p>'Most of my friends met their partners online, that's the modern way to do it.</p>

<p>Chat: She went on to discuss her fears over the catfishing, saying: 'But here's my issue - how do I know it's the real them?' to which Ruth (pictured) replied: 'This is the issue isn't it'</p>

<p>'And since lockdown, people are even more nervous about meeting people, and it is the only way forward, you've just got to get your head around it Coleen.' </p>

<p>She added: 'The option is be lonely and only see the dogs and the kids when they come round, or go out have a bit of fun and meet someone.</p>

<p>'You're not looking for a bloke you're to marry, you're just looking for someone to have fun with.'</p>

<p>Coleen revealed she 'melted into a pool of embarrassment' when a man she had been talking to on the app gave her his number and asked her to give him a ring. </p>

<p>New romance?: Coleen Nolan revealed last month that she has been messaging a younger man on social media and confessed that it is 'nice to have a flirt'</p>

<p>'That's a bit too much. When it comes to going on a date and I fancy someone I turn into a 12-year-old schoolgirl, I forget my own name. I'm rubbish, I am the biggest cowardly flirt you'll ever meet.'  </p>

<p>She added that it was a worry if people know her from her singing fame or from Loose Women.</p>

<p>'I had a message yesterday that said, 'I bet you're in the mood for dancing, and I thought, 'Oh for god's sake,' and deleted him,' she said.</p>

<p>It comes after last month Coleen revealed on the show that she has been messaging a younger man on social media and confessed that it is 'nice to have a flirt'.</p>

<p>Split: Coleen has been single for three years after splitting from her second husband Ray Fensome in 2017 after 11 years of marriage (pictured in 2013)</p>

<p>The presenter said she was speaking to a 38-year-old suitor during a candid chat about age differences in relationships </p>

<p>However she also questioned why someone much younger would be interested in an older woman as she mused whether it was because of her fame or money. </p>

<p>'I would always question why would a 35 year old want to be with a 55 year old? Is it because I'm on telly or you think I'm rich? Having said that, on social media, I have been speaking to a 38-year-old. He's like a 38-year-old with an older soul.'</p>

<p>Her fellow panellist Michelle Ackerley then chipped in saying 'you need to connect' to which Coleen responded: 'Yeah, the problem is you don't really get that on dating websites'.</p>

<p>Coleen has been single for three years after splitting from her second husband Ray Fensome in 2017 after 11 years of marriage. </p>

<p>Let's get real: In the chat last month Coleen questioned why someone much younger would be interested in an older woman as she mused whether it was because of her fame or money</p>
