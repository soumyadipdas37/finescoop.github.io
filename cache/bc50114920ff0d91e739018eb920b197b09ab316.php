<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A father was left stunned after seeing hundreds of people standing in a 'five hour' queue waiting for Covid tests at a walk-in centre in Manchester.</p>

<p>Tony Kirvin, 43, needed to get his son Michael tested after the 14-year-old started showing mild symptoms and was sent home from school.</p>

<p>The nearest testing centre was a 120-mile round trip, which he said was not feasible, so Mr Kirvin instead drove to a walk-in centre near their home in Bury on Thursday.</p>

<p>But he was shocked to see hundreds of people queuing up outside the Mosses Centre, with many not wearing masks, video footage shows.</p>

<p>Tony Kirvin, 43, was shocked to see hundreds waiting in a 'five hour' queue for Covid tests at Mosses Centre in Bury, Manchester, on Thursday</p>

<p>While filming the queue, Mr Kirvin says: 'This guys is the queue for the walk-in Covid centre in Bury. Look at the f***ing size of this queue. </p>

<p>'Jesus f***ing christ it just goes on and on and on. No wonder we are in the middle of a pandemic.'</p>

<p>Mr Kirvin said his wife was told there was 'no chance' they would get into the centre as the wait was at least five hours. </p>

<p>He added that there was 'absolutely no way' they could join the line as his son, who has autism, would have 'had a meltdown' standing in a queue for that long. </p>

<p>The father-of-four said: 'We couldn't find a test anywhere until I saw this walk-in place.</p>

<p>'But when we arrived the queue was huge - there must have been at least 100 people.</p>

<p>'My son is autistic, no way he could stand in a queue that long. He'd have a melt down.</p>

<p>'It's just shocking to see, but not surprising considering schools have been reopened and we've had the eat out to help out scheme.</p>

<p>'It was inevitable.'</p>

<p>The full-time carer managed to get a test for his son at the Heywood site and is set to receive the results in the next two days. </p>

<p>The father-of-four filmed the lengthy queue after driving his 14-year-old son Michael to get a test because he was sent home from school after developing mild symptoms</p>

<p>Councillor Andrea Simpson, Bury Council Cabinet Member for Health and Wellbeing, said: 'Bury has opened a number of walk-through testing centres to improve access and options for local people that are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, additional sites are due to open very soon.</p>

<p>'Demand for testing is increasing at a national level and in response to this, having these local testing options helps to meet this demand locally.</p>

<p>'As a result of this demand, our walk-through centres have become increasingly busy, and whilst the centres will test as many symptomatic people as possible, at busy times, there may be a wait, and if demand is very high people may be asked to consider other testing options.</p>

<p>'It's really important that our walk-through centres are reserved for people who are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, many people coming to the centres have no symptoms.</p>

<p>'People not experiencing symptoms should not request a test and will not be tested at the centres.</p>

<p>'For people with symptoms coming to one of the centres, it is important to stay a safe distance from other people and to wear a face covering on the journey to and from the site.'</p>

<p>It follows nationwide complaints from frustrated people who have been told to travel hundreds of miles to find out if they have Covid-19.</p>

<p>A shortage in UK laboratory capacity has been blamed for problems, as it limits the number of appointments available.</p>

<p>But the failings heap fresh doubt on whether Boris Johnson's 'Operation Moonshot' strategy is possible. </p>

<p>The nearest testing centre was a 120-mile round trip, which Mr Kirvin said was not feasible, so he instead drove to a walk-in centre near their home but was faced with shocking queues</p>

<p>The ambitious £100billion scheme aims to carry out millions of tests every day by early next year.</p>

<p>Charlie Ledington, of Worcester, had to keep her five children off school because she was unable to book an appointment for her youngest child Chloe, two. </p>

<p>She was repeatedly told the system was busy when she began trying on Wednesday.</p>

<p>At 11pm she was offered a test at a centre in Wales, a four-hour drive away – only to be told there was no availability when she tried to confirm it. </p>

<p>The following day she was offered spaces in Droitwich, Bristol and Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, only to be told again no appointments were available.</p>

<p>'It's a mess. I've had to keep my children off school. We all have had to isolate for ten days now,' she said.</p>

<p>It also emerged on Thursday that residents in Brighton are being directed 67 miles away to the Isle of Wight – including a ferry ride.</p>

<p>Brighton Kemptown Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said: 'This is after they closed the Brighton testing centre. Absolute shambles.'</p>

<p>A Department of Health spokesman said it was 'targeting testing capacity at the areas that need it most', adding: 'Our capacity is the highest it has ever been and our laboratories are processing more than a million tests a week.'</p>
