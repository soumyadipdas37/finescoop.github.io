<p>Elijah Taylor (pictured after his arrest in Perth) has been charged after allegations by ex-girlfriend Lekahni Pearce</p>

<p> Pearce (pictured) made headlines last month after she snuck into the Sydney Swans' quarantine hub in Perth</p>

<p>Ms Pearce had previously claimed on social media that Taylor attacked her. He was arrested in Langford, in Perth's southeast earlier this month.</p>

<p>He was questioned for over five hours in Cannington Police Station before leaving with a blanket covering his face. </p>

<p>'The Sydney Swans are aware of allegations made on social media regarding first year player Elijah Taylor,' a Sydney Swans statement read.</p>

<p>'The allegations are very serious and are being treated as such.</p>

<p>'The club had notified the AFL and is not in a position to comment further at this time.'</p>

<p>The AFL integrity unit is handling the investigation over the alleged incident.</p>

<p>'The allegations are extremely serious,' an AFL statement reads.</p>

<p>Taylor was arrested in Perth and placed in the back of a police van (pictured) before being driven to Cannington station </p>

<p>'The AFL has been in contact with local law enforcement and will continue to provide support and assistance for all.'</p>

<p>Taylor's manager Tom Seccull issued a statement saying the club is aware of the allegations.</p>

<p>'However, given the seriousness and sensitivity for those involved, we're not in a position to comment further at this stage,' he said.</p>

<p>The former couple made headlines last month after Taylor snuck Pearce into the Swans' AFL quarantine hub at Perth's Joondalup Resort. </p>

<p>His senior teammates reportedly discovered Ms Pearce in the hotel and raised the alarm, with Taylor suspended for the remainder of the 2020 season.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old had reportedly crossed a golf course to be reunited with her then boyfriend. </p>

<p>Ms Pearce reportedly snuck across the golf course and into the resort where the players were staying</p>

<p>Ms Pearce told Channel 7 she didn't see any security guards while sneaking into the hub.  </p>

<p>'I just walked through, went to his room. That's how easy it was. I didn't jump any fences,' she said.  </p>

<p>Ms Pearce had just completed her own mandatory self-quarantine period after flying in from Sydney.</p>

<p>Taylor was sent home in the aftermath of the scandal, while his club was fined a total of $50,000 - with $25,000 suspended.</p>

<p>The teenager had been staying with family in WA following the suspension for his breach.</p>

<p>Taylor, who is the nephew of former AFL star turned Channel Seven commentator Brian Taylor, has played four games for the Swans since being drafted from Western Australia.</p>

<p>He made his AFL debut in the Swans' loss again the Gold Coast Suns at the SCG.</p>
