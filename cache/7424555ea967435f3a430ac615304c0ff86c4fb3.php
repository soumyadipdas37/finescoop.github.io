<p>The 28-year-old model shared throwback photos with the 24-year-old running back as they embraced by the beach.</p>

<p>The two frolicked in the clear blue water in a tropical spot, and the photos appeared to have been taken around the same time as similar pictures she released to celebrate the Fourth of July. </p>

<p>Big day: Olivia Culpo, 28, helped kick off the NFL season on Sunday with gorgeous throwback posts to a beach vacation with her boyfriend Christian McCaffrey, 24</p>

<p>'ITS GAME DAY ‼️‼️ lets goooo <?php echo e('@'); ?>christianmccaffrey,' she gushed in the comment as she cheered on her football player boyfriend.</p>

<p>Olivia was dressed in an intriguing bikini featuring a bandeau top and high-waisted bottoms with a sparkling brown texture.</p>

<p>She added an unusual accessory with matching sleevelets and a thick headband to hold back her dark tresses.</p>

<p> Christian wore a simple pair of swim trunks and otherwise showed off his bulging muscles as his girlfriend sat on his lap and they made kissing faces at each other.</p>

<p>'ITS GAME DAY': Olivia cheered on her running back boyfriend in the caption while embracing him and leaning in for a kiss in her stunning photos. She stood out in a brown bikini with sleevelets and a headband</p>

<p>Alas, Olivia's cheering on her boyfriend wasn't enough to help his team clinch a win, and the Carolina Panthers were defeated Sunday afternoon by the Los Vegas Raiders 34–30.</p>

<p>McCaffrey ran 96 yards during the game and scored two of his team's touchdowns.</p>

<p>Although the two have been inseparable during much of the coronavirus pandemic, the professional athlete has been absent from many of Olivia's recent posts as he's been at the Panthers' training camp.</p>

<p>Back in June, Olivia practiced her baking skills by whipping up an opulent rainbow unicorn cake for Christian's 24th birthday.</p>

<p>Although she's been all smiles in recent photos, the former pageant queen revealed late last month that she had been diagnosed with endometriosis.</p>

<p>'I've never publicly said this before, but I have endometriosis. Aka the most excruciatingly painful cramps/periods,' she said on her Instagram story last week. </p>

<p>When many of her followers chimed in that they were also dealing with the disorder, which can cause excruciating pain for some sufferers, Olivia share details about how she copes, while admitting she has a fear of having surgery.</p>

<p>'It's so not fun. Very painful. There is obviously a surgery you can get for it that I don't really want to get, but [I use] lots of heating pads, [drink] lots of water, and [take] lots of Midol,' she revealed. </p>

<p>Painful: 'I've never publicly said this before, but I have endometriosis. Aka the most excruciatingly painful cramps/periods,' revealed the 28-year-old model on her Instagram Story</p>

<p>She also encouraged women who think they may be dealing with endometriosis to 'do [their] research and due diligence' by seeking help from a medical professional.</p>

<p>'If you are having very painful periods or you are not being diagnosed with what you think COULD be endometriosis, definitely do your research.</p>

<p>'Because if you don't discover that you have this it could get in the way of fertility, you can have tissue growing in areas that you really shouldn't have it, which could interfere with getting pregnant someday,' explained the former Miss Universe.</p>

<p>'Definitely go to your doctor if you have painful periods. Painful periods are not normal. You just want to make sure that everything is ok. If you do want to get pregnant, you just never know. You don't want to wait too late.'</p>

<p>She then tagged her personal OB-GYN Dr. Thaïs Aliabadi, who also happens to treat numerous members of the Kardashian-Jenner family.</p>

<p>Candid: After learning that many of her followers also suffer from the painful disorder, Culpo returned to the platform to elaborate on her coping mechanisms, as well as her aversion to surgery</p>
