<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pep Guardiola revealed that Manchester City will be without both Sergio Aguero and Aymeric Laporte for their season curtain-raiser at Wolves.</p>

<p>Laporte only returned to training on Friday following self-isolation on the back of a positive coronavirus test.</p>

<p>Aguero's knee injury means he is undergoing sessions alone and yet to link up with the rest of Guardiola's squad. </p>

<p>Sergio Aguero will be absent as he continues his recovery from knee surgery this summer</p>

<p>Defender Aymeric Laporte has only just returned to training after a positive coronavirus test</p>

<p>It leaves City without two of their best players for a trip to Molineux against a Wolves team that did the double over them last term.</p>

<p>'Riyad (Mahrez) came back (from self-isolation) four days ago and today was the first day Aymeric is coming back,' Guardiola said.</p>

<p>'Riyad will be available, Laporte not yet. Aguero has not made one training session with us.'</p>

<p>Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling are Guardiola's options through the middle and Laporte's absence at the back could mean a debut for the £40million summer signing.</p>

<p>Ake might have been joined by Lionel Messi as the Argentine attempted to engineer a way out of Barcelona. City had been cautiously optimistic of landing Messi before his exit was blocked.</p>

<p>It leaves Pep Guardiola without two of his best players ahead of Monday's visit to Wolves</p>

<p>Nathan Ake, City's £40m summer signing from Bournemouth, could be in line to make a debut</p>

<p>Guardiola added: 'I don't have to explain anything. Leo explained it quite well, his feelings. I don't have anything to add. He is at Barcelona, a club I love.'</p>

<p>City could yet be busy in the transfer window before it shuts on October 5 as they hunt for a centre half, with the futures of a number of existing players up in the air.</p>

<p>Guardiola suggested the next fortnight could be busy at the Etihad Stadium. 'Since day one, when I arrived here, I am more than satisfied on what I had. I know the club do absolutely everything to do their best for all of us,' he said.</p>

<p>'If it happens then it'll happen, we could move someone – because sometimes the player decide to leave. I'll never complain about this (transfers). I'm a lucky person to have these players.'</p>

<p>Guardiola wouldn't be drawn on City's failed attempt to sign Barcelona star Lionel Messi</p>
