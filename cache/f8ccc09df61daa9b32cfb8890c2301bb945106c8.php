<p>Sweet: Rob's post was soon flooded with messages of support, with one among them being from actor Ryan Reynolds</p>

<p>'They help me. I don't do that too often but if you have had a child die or a sibling die and would benefit from hearing a daddy say that he misses his little boy so much and loves him forever, then here you go. </p>

<p>'Thank you forever to my community of bereaved parents who help me more than I can say. I love you Henry.'</p>

<p>Tragedy: Rob's son Henry died in January 2018 from a brain tumour when he was aged two, after undergoing surgery and spending a gruelling 15 months in hospital</p>

<p>Rob and his partner Leah were left devastated when their beloved son Henry died in January 2018 from a brain tumour when he was aged two. He had been diagnosed in 2016.</p>

<p>Rob said that his wife had been pregnant for three of the eight years they have been together and they had four beautiful boys. </p>

<p>The toddler underwent surgery to remove a tumour in addition to further treatment, spending a gruelling 15 months in hospital. </p>

<p>But his family were told his cancer had returned in the autumn of 2017 before he passed away the following January. </p>

<p>Done: In August, father-of-four Rob revealed he'd had a vasectomy, but he and Leah haven't ruled out adopting in the future (pictured together in April 2018)</p>

<p>In August, father-of-four Rob revealed he'd had a vasectomy, but he and Leah haven't ruled out adopting in the future.</p>

<p>He detailed the process in a candid piece for the Guardian, explaining while his family 'loves babies', they have been through a great deal after Henry's death.</p>

<p>He said: I did this because my wife and I don't want her to get pregnant again. It doesn't mean we don't want any more kids, it just means that if we did have any more, they'd have to be adopted or stolen or left to us because friends or family with young kids died in a plane crash or had their brain stems blown apart by less-lethal rounds fired at them at point-blank range while they were waiting in an 11-hour line.</p>

<p>'I am sad sometimes that I won't get Leah pregnant again. Our youngest recently turned two and it hurts to think that we won't make more chunky little nuggets together. </p>

<p>'We really love babies... But after an insane six years of being pregnant and breastfeeding, and sometimes doing those things while caring for a dying child. On balance, we're glad I did it.'</p>

<p>Rob also paid tribute to Henry on Father's Day, this year. </p>

<p>The actor - who penned the sitcom Catastrophe during his son's cancer battle - shared a photo of a newborn Henry sleeping on his lap, telling his Instagram followers: 'I'm still his dad &amp; he's still my son.' </p>
