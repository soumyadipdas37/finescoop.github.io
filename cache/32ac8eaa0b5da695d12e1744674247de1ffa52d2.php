<p>A woman has relived the moment she found out her godfather - who was also her mother's gynecologist - was her biological father, and learned she has about 300 siblings.  </p>

<p>Fiona Darroch, who was born in South Africa and now lives in Australia, accidentally discovered obstetrician Norman Walker was her real father six years ago, at the age of 53.</p>

<p>She had been looking for books written by her godfather when she stumbled across a strange Amazon review by a woman from Ireland, she told SBS Insight in an exclusive interview.</p>

<p>The Irish woman was trying to find information on him and wrote: 'Dr Walker was my biological father and sperm donor.'</p>

<p>Ms Darroch, who didn't even know she was conceived via a sperm donor at the time, had a series of letters addressed to her from Dr Walker from when she was young, along with his war medals and photos.</p>

<p>She wrote back: 'Hey I've got all this stuff that I'm happy to share with you.'</p>

<p>But the more information the pair shared, the more she began to wonder.</p>

<p>'When I fished out his letters, I found a driver's license of his that he had given me from when he was 16,' Ms Darroch said.</p>

<p>'I showed it to my husband and said, "Who does this look like?" and he just laughed, because it looks exactly like our youngest daughter.'</p>

<p>By that point, she knew it was time to confront her mother.</p>

<p>'My mum came clean and told me that they had used a sperm donor, and that Dr Walker was her gynecologist and he said that they just usually used medical students.'</p>

<p>Ms Darroch, whose legal father had died years prior, was devastated and angry that she had been lied to.</p>

<p>'It was like losing my own father who raised me all over again,' she said.</p>

<p>'You experience the same grief and loss, because you're no longer connected to the person who you thought you were connected.' </p>

<p>Her mother was unclear on the sperm donation process and wouldn't give a straight answer when confronted about whether she thought Dr Walker was the donor.</p>

<p>When Ms Darroch's oldest daughter did a 23andMe DNA test in 2017, her suspicions were confirmed.</p>

<p>'When the results came out, she had matched with lots and lots of people and she didn't have a clue who they were. </p>

<p>It just so happened that one of my donor [half] siblings had given his entire family ancestry tests for Christmas that year, and we all matched at the same time.' </p>

<p>From there, the estranged siblings began putting the pieces of their family back together.</p>

<p>Ms Darroch and her half-siblings believe Dr Walker inseminated hundreds of women around the world</p>

<p>They also spoke to staff at the donor clinic who confirmed Dr Walker's actions and said many families fell victim to sperm tampering at the hands of the gynecologist.</p>

<p>Ms Darroch's youngest daughter recently discovered that she has an uncle who is 15 years younger than her mother - indicating that he was actively tampering with sperm for about 15 years after she was born.</p>

<p>'We're thinking maybe 200 to 300 [half siblings],' she said. </p>

<p>Siblings have been found from from United States, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, South Africa, and Australia. </p>

<p>Dr Walker took his own life when Ms Darroch was 15.</p>

<p>'I think his ethics were really shonky. I understand that at that time they had no idea that DNA was going to be so popular and it would be so easy to track down your family tree.'</p>
