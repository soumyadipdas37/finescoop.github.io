<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>More than 200,000 Americans have now died from COVID-19 - a bleak milestone that comes even as the national fatality rate continues to decline. </p>

<p>The number of Americans dying from coronavirus per day, based on a weekly average, is now at just over 760. </p>

<p>It is down from the peak 2,000 deaths being reported per day back in April. </p>

<p>The death toll surpassed the 200,000 mark on Tuesday - a figure that was unimaginable eight months ago when the virus first struck the United States. </p>

<p>While deaths continue to decline across the country, fatalities related to COVID-19 are a lagging indicator and can potentially rise several weeks after new cases.</p>

<p>The number of Americans dying from coronavirus per day, based on a weekly average, is now at just over 760. It is down from the peak 2,000 deaths being reported per day back in April</p>

<p>The national infection rate started increasing just over a week ago, which is a rise health experts have attributed to schools reopening and parties over the Labor Day holiday. </p>

<p>The average number of COVID-19 cases being reported per day is now at just under 40,000 with total infection in the US topping 6.8 million.</p>

<p>Before this uptick, cases, on average, had been trending downwards nationally since July when about 70,000 infections were being reported daily. </p>

<p>The University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation is predicting that deaths will rise to more 378,000 by the end of the year. </p>

<p>The death rate projected by the IHME model, which has been cited by the White House Coronavirus Task Force, would more than triple the current daily death rate to to 3,000 per day in December.</p>

<p>During the early months of the pandemic, 200,000 deaths was regarded by many as the maximum number of lives likely to be lost in the United States to the virus. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump on Monday said he had done a phenomenal job on the pandemic.</p>

<p>'It affects virtually nobody. It's an amazing thing,' Trump told supporters at a Swanton, Ohio, campaign rally Monday night. </p>

<p>'It affects... elderly people with heart problems and other problems - if they have other problems that's what it really affects, that's it.' </p>

<p>Trump has admitted to playing down the danger of the coronavirus early on because he did not want to 'create a panic.' </p>
