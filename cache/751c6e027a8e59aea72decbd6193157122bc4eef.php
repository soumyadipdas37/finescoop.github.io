<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There were fresh signs of revival in the economy today with figures showing Britons going out spending. </p>

<p>Retail sales were up 0.8 per cent last month from July, fueled by home improvements and continuing high levels of online shopping. </p>

<p>The figures are now 4 per cent above February before the coronavirus lockdown hit - suggesting that confidence is returning. However, clothing stores are still suffering.</p>

<p>Jonathan Athow of the Office for National Statistics said: 'Retail sales continued to grow, further surpassing their pre-pandemic level.</p>

<p>'Sales of household goods thrived as the demand for home improvement continued and, despite a dip this month, online sales remained high.</p>

<p>Retail sales were up 0.8 per cent last month from July, fueled by home improvements and continuing high levels of online shopping</p>

<p>'However, clothing stores continued to struggle with sales still well below their February level.</p>

<p>'Overall, the switch to greater online sales means the high street remains under pressure.'   </p>

<p>The 0.8 per cent increase in August was a slowing from 3.6 per cent monthly growth in July.</p>

<p>But it exceeded the expectations from analysts, who had forecast a 0.6 per cent improvement.</p>

<p>Online sales continued to be strong as shoppers chose to stay at home but dipped slightly against the previous month.</p>

<p>Sales from online channels moved 2.5 per cent lower against July's data but were still 46.8 per cent higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>Spending on household goods was particularly strong in August, with retailers reporting a 9.9 per cent jump in sales of homeware products compared to February.</p>

<p>Clothing sales have struggled to recover at the same pace and remained 15.9 per cent below pre-Covid levels.</p>

<p>The ONS also reported that 51.5 per cent of food retailers said they saw a decrease in footfall from August 10 to August 23, which it said could be linked to the reopening of other areas of the economy, such as restaurants and bars.</p>

<p>Sales data from large retailers also showed a slight dip in sales in July and August compared to the previous months, as more people ate out again.</p>

<p>Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said: 'Retail sales continued to grow, further surpassing their pre-pandemic level.</p>

<p>'Sales of household goods thrived as the demand for home improvement continued and, despite a dip this month, online sales remained high.</p>

<p>'However, clothing stores continued to struggle with sales still well below their February level.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak (pictured on a visit to a pottery in Stoke-on-Trent this week) has said confidence will be critical for the recovery</p>

<p>'Overall, the switch to greater online sales means the high street remains under pressure.'</p>

<p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: 'It is clear that the retail industry is entering a period of fragile recovery, with August showing the third consecutive month of growth.</p>

<p>'However, the recovery remains a mixed bag, with high growth in online sales while city centre shops suffered as a result of low footfall.'</p>

<p>Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: 'After the stellar recovery in retail sales we saw in the past three months, it's no surprise that the monthly rate of growth slowed in August.</p>

<p>'Being the second month of the high street reopening in full, much of the focus last month was on the hospitality and leisure sectors.</p>

<p>'The popularity of initiatives such as Eat Out To Help Out even led to a rare slowdown in grocery sales growth.'</p>
