<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who suffered severe cystic acne following an intense beauty treatment has cleared up her skin within weeks after using a $14.99 facial cleansing bar.</p>

<p>Jennifer Wilson, from Queensland, said she forked out thousands of dollars on 'everything' to help treat her breakouts including skincare products, laser treatments, LED light therapy and chemical peels - but nothing seemed to work.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old designer said her acne was so 'aggressive and angry' she was unable to smile without being in pain.</p>

<p>'It was a combination of very large, deep cystic acne and lots of surface bumps. My skin was always red and inflamed, makeup didn't sit well on it so it was hard to cover, but more than that, it just hurt all the time,' Jennifer told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>'It physically hurt to smile and move my cheeks. When I woke up in the morning, I would look in the mirror and cry almost everyday at the state my skin and face was in. It was really traumatic.'</p>

<p>The 28-year-old designer said her acne was so 'aggressive and angry', she was unable to smile without being in pain (pictured now)</p>

<p>She was surprised to see her skin improved within the first week of using the Carbon Theory Cleansing Bar (pictured)</p>

<p>Jennifer said she first developed pimples about two years ago after she stopped taking birth control at the age of 26.</p>

<p>But her acne worsened after she underwent an intense exfoliating treatment that buffs away dead skin cells off the surface of the skin using a gentle suction, leaving you with a brighter, smoother complexion.</p>

<p>'It first started as hormonal acne around my chin, just on the surface of my skin. However after I had microdermabrasion my skin went crazy,' she explained.</p>

<p>'I had deep, painful cystic acne all over my cheeks, jawline, forehead and chin. My skin was unrecognisable.'</p>

<p>She said her 'hard-to-cover' acne was a 'real blow' to her self-confidence. </p>

<p>'I felt like I couldn't even walk to the mailbox without wanting to pile concealer on my face to cover up,' she recalled.</p>

<p>'I hated taking my makeup off at the end of the day and having to show my fiancé what my face really looked like. I was constantly distracted from whatever I would be doing because I was worried my acne was showing or whether people were looking.</p>

<p>'It made me very self-conscious and honestly depressed. I didn't want to go out and see friends, or meet new people because I really didn't like the way my face looked.' </p>

<p>The 28-year-old said her acne worsened after she underwent an intense exfoliating treatment called microdermabrasion where it buffs away dead skin cells off the surface of the skin</p>

<p>The 28-year-old said the cleansing bar has since 'changed my skin and life' after she was able to clear up her 'hard-to-cover' acne </p>

<p>She tried everything in the past 10 months, including high-end skincare and drugstore products, specialist recommendations and 'everything in between' - but nothing worked</p>

<p>Carbon Theory's Facial Cleansing Bar contains premium natural ingredients dermatologically proven to prevent breakouts and keep your skin looking balanced, clear and hydrated. </p>

<p>Founder Philip Taylor recommends cleansing twice a day to target bacteria and remove excess oil. </p>

<p>Thanks to activated charcoal, the ingredient gently draws out bacteria, unclogs pores and bacteria that become trapped. Organic tea tree oil aids in reducing inflammation and clearing breakouts whilst Shea butter will hydrate your skin to heal faster.</p>

<p>So she tried everything in the past 10 months, including high-end, drugstore and natural skincare products, specialist recommendations and 'everything in between'.</p>

<p>'I tried cutting out all inflammatory food, taking skin supplements, literally everything, you name it, I tried it,' she said.</p>

<p>But she was surprised to see her skin improved within the first week of using the Carbon Theory Cleansing Bar at the end of March.</p>

<p>'By the end of April, my skin had almost completely cleared up of active breakouts. It's honestly incredible,' she said.</p>

<p>Five months on, Jennifer said 'almost all of the redness and scarring has completely healed' since she religiously used the bar day and night in her skincare regime.</p>

<p>'I honestly feel so incredibly happy, most days I don't wear any makeup at all because I don't feel like I need to hide anymore,' she said. </p>

<p>'I cannot say enough good things about Carbon Theory, I recommend it to anyone who will listen. It has completely changed my skin and my life - and it has given me my confidence and my life back.'</p>
