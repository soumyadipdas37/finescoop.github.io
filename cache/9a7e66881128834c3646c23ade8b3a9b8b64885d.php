<p> Lucy (pictured recently), 20, from Hinckley, Leicestershire, tipped the scales at 15 stone at her heaviest after starting a new relationship and ordering meals in almost every night as she curled up on the sofa with her new man</p>

<p>But the healthcare assistant (pictured recently) was soon shocked into changing her ways after discovering none of her clothes fitted anymore</p>

<p>Lucy said: 'I have always felt uncomfortable with my body but I never had the motivation to do anything about it. I was bullied when I was younger for my weight but as you get older it stops.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I was very uncomfortable going out with my boyfriend, because he was so fit. When I got into a relationship I gained almost two stone. </p>

<p>'I realised we would order takeaways on most days or go out for meals. I used to get fizzy drinks every day and binge junk food -I didn't really think about what I was eating.</p>

<p>'I found Instagram accounts and started calorie counting and making fakeaways. It was more of a lifestyle change for me rather than a diet, I didn't feel restricted at all.'</p>

<p>Lucy's fakeways included a 258 calorie plant-based kebab, a 307 calorie McMuffin fakeaway made with Quorn sausage patties and 250 calorie homemade pizza wraps. </p>

<p>She added: 'It took me almost two years to get where I am right now, weight loss needs patience. I had a lot of people telling me I look great, ask me how I've done it and if I can share any tips.</p>

<p>'My advice for people trying to lose weight would be that it takes time, it doesn't happen overnight, don't be too restrictive.</p>

<p>'I think it's important to keep a balance, don't limit yourself too much and don't stop socialising because you are on diet.' </p>
