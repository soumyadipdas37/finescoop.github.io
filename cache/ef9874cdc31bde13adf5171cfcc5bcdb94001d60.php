<p>Mr Wiseman, 51, said he had to endure a 'life sentence' while his attacker was able to delay justice further adding to his trauma which had been dredged up with the police investigation and court case. </p>

<p>'These extensions are just a slap in the face - I thought it was all over,' Mr Wiseman told Newscorp. </p>

<p>'You've got these people who don't have any remorse and don't appreciate the pain they've caused and the victim gets dragged through it over and over again – it's so frustrating,' he said.</p>

<p>'It's like getting stabbed in the back every month there's another extension.'</p>

<p>He is calling for an overhaul of the system to provide better support to victims, adding that he only found out he was entitled to $10,000 in compensation when other abuse victims let him know. </p>

<p>He said while he was grateful for the money it appeared to be a token amount, which he said should be raised and the 'hoops' victims are required to jump through removed. </p>

<p>Mr Wiseman said he was also incredibly frustrated over 'cruel' changes to laws in February which ban victims in Victoria from speaking about their cases under their own identities once their attackers have been found guilty. </p>

<p>Those who break the law can be fined $3,000 or be jailed for four months. </p>

<p>He said he said he is worried similar laws could be introduced in New South Wales, where he is a resident, and that speaking up had not only helped himself but also other victims. </p>
