<p>The Bachelorette veteran looked ready to work up a sweat in a black crop top and leggings with a mask on and her blonde hair pulled up.</p>

<p>This comes after the 35-year-old got the compliment of her life when Lady Gaga said she started to 'cry' when she saw the reality TV vet dance the Cha Cha to her single Stupid Love. </p>

<p>Gotta dance: Kaitlyn Bristowe was seen heading to rehearsals in Los Angeles on Tuesday after making her debut on Dancing With The Stars</p>

<p>A lot to carry: The TV star had a black bag over her shoulder and a brown backpack on as she left the Dancing With The Stars studio. The siren was holding her cell phone as if she was expecting a call</p>

<p>The 34-year-old pop siren took to Twitter on Monday to sing the pair's praises as they emoted during their dance.</p>

<p>'Is it weird that this made me cry,' wrote the Star Is Born actress. 'I love watching people happy and dancing!'</p>

<p>Stupid Love was released earlier this year on Gaga's Chromatica album with the lyrics:  'You're the one that I've been waiting for, Gotta quit this cryin', Nobody's gonna heal me if I don't open the door, Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me.'</p>

<p>Dancer's legs: The Bachelorette veteran looked ready to work up a sweat in a black crop top and leggings with a mask on and her blonde hair pulled up</p>

<p>There is a bit of a back story with Kaitlyn, who hails from Canada.</p>

<p>Before her performance she told her boyfriend Jason Tartick that she had hoped the Oscar-winning crooner would watch the show.</p>

<p>He said, 'One of the things she said at dinner was "how cool would it be if Lady Gaga reposted my dance?"</p>

<p>Way to go: The stunner with Artem on the dance floor on Monday as they did the Cha Cha</p>

<p>Tears of joy: Lady Gaga said she started to cry when she saw the reality TV vet dance the Cha Cha to her single Stupid Love</p>

<p>'I was like this is such a Kaitlyn Bristowe thing to say,' he noted.</p>

<p>'I was like, "Just enjoy it, Lady Gaga is probably not gonna repost your stuff. Just have fun. Don't worry about that." She was like, "I know but that would be cool."'</p>

<p>And then Bristowe got her dream come true. </p>

<p>'33 minutes ago Lady Gaga said the performance made her cry,' he then shared.</p>

<p>Flattered: Stupid Love was released earlier this year on Gaga's Chromatica album with the lyrics: 'You're the one that I've been waiting for, Gotta quit this cryin', Nobody's gonna heal me if I don't open the door, Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me'</p>

<p>'The way that Kaitlyn manifests s**t and that it happens when it defies all odds is inexplicably crazy.'</p>

<p>Bristowe was on the 19th season of ABC's The Bachelor, and was the lead on the 11th season of The Bachelorette.</p>

<p>She was with her Bachelorette choice Shawn Booth, 33, from 2015 until 2018 then started dating Jason.</p>

<p>Now that she is back on TV, she says she is trying to get used to the trolls. 'I forgot how mean people are when you go on TV,' she wrote on her Instagram story. 'Just so many "She looks so old and plastic" comments everywhere. You win today trolls. It got to me.'</p>

<p>She also told UsWeekly: 'What I’m the most scared of, I think, is letting people down. It's always my biggest insecurity — disappointing myself or my partner.' </p>
