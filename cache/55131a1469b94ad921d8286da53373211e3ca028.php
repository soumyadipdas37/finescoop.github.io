<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A student appeared in court today after allegedly sending 'incendiary' devices in parcels disguised as iPhone boxes - before triggering them to set fire to labels so he could claim refunds from Amazon, a court heard.</p>

<p>Ovidijus Margelis, 26, allegedly posted suspicious packages containing explosives while studying at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge. </p>

<p>But the Lithuanian disputes his charge of intent to cause an explosion because, his defence says, the incendiary devices inside the parcels were only intended to trigger a small flame.</p>

<p>The third-year Business Management student was said to have posted packages to addresses and claimed they were iPhones and other 'commercial items'.</p>

<p>Ovidijus Margelis (pictured), 26, allegedly posted suspicious packages containing explosives while studying at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge</p>

<p>But the carton boxes actually contained small devices that set alight when Margelis used his mobile phone to call them, it was said.</p>

<p>The fire made the packages untraceable, and allowed the student to claim refunds from Amazon and Paypal, according to the prosecution. </p>

<p>A Cricklewood resident received a suspicious package containing an explosive device on Thursday, September 10 and called the police immediately.</p>

<p>Margelis was arrested at his home in Cambridge by officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command on Saturday and charged with three counts of intent to cause an explosion.</p>

<p>He is also charged with four fraud-related offences relating to the three-month scheme he is said to have carried out.</p>

<p>The student appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today via video link in a prison-issued grey tracksuit. He is currently in custody and spoke to confirm his name and address.</p>

<p>Misba Majid, prosecuting, said: 'This is a sophisticated offence, it has taken the defendant some time to put these things together.' </p>

<p>Margelis, of Cambridge, is charged with three counts of intent to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or injure property.</p>

<p>He is also charged with possessing a controlled article for use in fraud, using criminal property and possessing identity documents with intent. </p>

<p>No plea was entered.</p>

<p>Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said: 'I will deny bail for now but may reconsider the matter next Monday.'</p>

<p>He was remanded in custody and will next appear before Westminster Magistrates Court on October 21. </p>
