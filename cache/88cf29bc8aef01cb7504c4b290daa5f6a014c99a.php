<p>The woman claimed her homemade version tasted better than McDonald's McMuffin (left)</p>

<p>'I refuse to spend $5 each on a McMuffin at Maccas (yes I know the world is becoming more expensive, I get it) when I can make them myself for $10 for the lot with some left for tomorrow,' she wrote in a Facebook group.</p>

<p>'These were better than Maccas ones.' </p>

<p>The home cook said she used egg rings she purchased from eBay for just $1 to cook the perfectly round eggs just like the fast food chain.</p>

<p>She explained that she typically uses the American cheese slices in the muffins but she opted for tasty cheese instead after her other option was sold out.</p>

<p>Hundreds were impressed with her homemade McMuffins, while others revealed they have been able to save a lot of money creating their own versions at home.</p>

<p>'I make them too with the American cheese from Coles, it tastes just like Macca's. I make six for $10. And when I make them, I wrap them in a paper towel and put in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds... so good,' one woman said.</p>

<p>A second woman said: 'You can get burger cheese slices from Coles, Tastes exactly like Macca's cheese. And your muffins will taste identical. We haven't done them any other way since.'</p>

<p>A third woman said: 'I love bacon and egg muffins, it's the best. It's so quick and easy and the muffins are yummy,' while another home cook added: 'I make them at home all the time, the Coles brand smokey cheese slices taste like McDonald's.'</p>
