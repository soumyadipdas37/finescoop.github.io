<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Brom manager Slaven Bilic claimed his defender Kieran Gibbs should have been cleverer in avoiding a red card following a clash with James Rodriguez at Goodison.</p>

<p>Gibbs was sent off shortly before half-time for retaliating after he had been pushed by Rodriguez — shoving the Colombian star in the face.</p>

<p>Bilic was also sent to the stands for confronting referee Mike Dean as they walked off for the interval and Albion, trailing 2-1 at the time, eventually lost the match 5-2.</p>

<p>Kieran Gibbs was sent off for shoving James Rodriguez in the face in 5-2 loss against Everton</p>

<p>West Brom manager Slaven Bilic (R) called on his player to be 'cleverer' after retaliating</p>

<p>‘Kieran made a mistake when James clipped him. He stayed on his feet and reacted. If he’d gone down, it would have been a yellow card for James and definitely not a red for him,’ argued Bilic afterwards.</p>

<p>‘He did the worst situation by not going down and then reaching with the hand. He didn’t give the referee any other option. He should have been a little bit more crafty and clever.</p>

<p>‘James was waiting and if you do that, it is a straight red. You can’t complain.’</p>

<p>Ironically, Bilic did complain at the time, loudly, to Dean when managers are not allowed to speak to officials until half-an-hour after the final whistle.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old was sent his marching orders for shoving James in the face after being pushed</p>

<p>A straight red card is the automatic punishment though Bilic insists he was not abusive. ‘As a manager, I should be in a position to ask the referee what is going on. It was half-time, not like the game was going on, nobody was around,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t swear. I asked him in a frustrated way but I didn’t cross the line,’ he said. ‘I told him if you want to kill us, kill us. That’s all.’</p>

<p>Bilic was also picked up by TV microphones shouting at Dean ‘Check the foul, check the foul’ — a reference to Everton’s first goal when West Brom believe their defender Darnell Furlong was fouled in the build-up.</p>

<p>The Crotian was himself sent off for his protests to Mike Dean when walking in at half time</p>

<p>Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti wants improvement from his team despite their impressive start to the season. ‘We weren’t able to control West Brom’s transitions in the first half,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘We were more in control in the second half but I have to be honest and say we had a great advantage with their red card. I think we had a lot of creativity in attack with the full-backs pushing up.’</p>
