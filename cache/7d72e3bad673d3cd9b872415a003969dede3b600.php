<p>Oh no! Jessica Alves has shared graphic images of her botched chin filler after a trip to the beauty salon left her with a deep hole in her face</p>

<p>Explaining her woes, Jessica told MailOnline: 'Three months ago I went to a beauty salon in Essex to have fake eyelashes fitted and while in the salon I saw a few girls coming in and out having had fillers into their lips and chin.</p>

<p>'I liked the results and then asked if I could also have fillers in my chin to make it more pointy. The lady who performed the injections had only finished her training course and I had 1 millilitre of filler in my chin.'</p>

<p>Admitting that things soon took a turn, Jessica said: 'After few weeks I flew to Brazil and I started to see the shape of my chin changing. I had an infection and the fillers started to drip and form a deep hole on the centre on my chin.'</p>

<p>The Celebrity Big Brother star went on to reveal that fillers in her legs and feet caused them to swell three shoe sizes after getting the treatment done in Brazil.</p>

<p>She said: ' From size shoes UK 7, I went up to size 9 or 1,  losing all my shoes. My legs and feet became really swollen causing me pain and discomfort.'</p>

<p>Jessica revealed all of the London surgeons she asked for help were unable to assist with her problem and she flew out to Istanbul in the hope she could find someone.  </p>

<p>However the surgeons in Turkey were also at a loss, as she revealed: 'I met with five surgeons and all of then said that they could not help. They just didn't know how to remove the fillers from my feet or how to close the hole on my chin.'</p>

<p>Worrying: However just weeks after getting the filler injected herself, Jessica noticed her chin had changed shape and she had developed an infection</p>

<p>Jessica admitted that the experience left her feeling 'emotional' because she worries that people think she is 'addicted' to surgery, but she insists she isn't.</p>

<p>Jessica said: 'I had those surgeries for health reasons and also I am transitioning and few more surgeries along the line will be needed to perfect my female look.</p>

<p>'I just hope that people can learn from my mistakes and experiences. It isn't always pretty.'</p>

<p>Jessica, formerly known as the Human Ken Doll Rodrigo Alves, has spent more than £600,000 on surgeries, deciding to transition earlier this year.</p>
