<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A masseuse accusing a blind Paralympian swimming champion of grabbing her bottom 'does not remember' why she gave several conflicting accounts of the attack, a court heard.</p>

<p>Lord Christopher Holmes of Richmond MBE, 48, allegedly groped the woman's buttocks at a five star hotel's spa on March 7 last year.</p>

<p>The visually impaired Tory peer denies sexually assaulting the masseuse and in a statement to police said as a blind person he can get a sense of what a person looks like through touch. </p>

<p>Giving evidence behind her screen, the woman in her 30s, claimed that after the assault, her job as a masseuse became a 'trigger' for unwanted memories and flashbacks.</p>

<p>But the court was told there was evidence she continued to enjoy certain activities such as yoga and boxing, despite claiming they acted as 'reminders of the trauma'.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the court heard that the woman had told a friend that Holmes, as well as groping her buttocks, had 'held her hand down and kept her against the wall' but that these details were not relayed to the jury.</p>

<p>Asked today whether this had happened, she replied: 'I don't remember'. </p>

<p>Holmes had earlier said: 'As I am basing my recollection only on touch I cannot be sure exactly where my hands rested but there was absolutely no intention to touch her in a sexual way.</p>

<p>'It was purely to give me an idea of her appearance.'</p>

<p>Sarah Forshaw defending the peer, reminded her she had told her counsellor 'activities which I used to enjoy in the past such as yoga have become strong reminders of the trauma.'</p>

<p>The woman told the court: 'I wasn't looking after myself, I wasn't able to exercise.</p>

<p>'It wasn't just yoga, it was in general.'</p>

<p>Lord Holmes was a champion swimmer, winning six gold medals at the 1992 Barcelona Games and three at the Atlanta Paralympics. </p>

<p>He also broke 35 world records before moving into top roles in sports management and politics.</p>

<p>He was director of Paralympic integration for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games before taking his seat in the House of Lords in 2013.</p>

<p>His website says he campaigns for more accessible environments for disabled people and has been asked to head a Government review that will make recommendations on how to encourage more disabled people to apply for public appointments.</p>

<p>Lord Holmes has also sat on a number of House of Lords select committees and has introduced a private members bill to tackle unpaid internships. </p>

<p>But in WhatsApp conversations with her boyfriend following the alleged attack the woman said she was looking forward to classes and posting selfies in yoga outfits.</p>

<p>There were also references to boxing classes, which she had also claimed she could not face.</p>

<p>Ms Forshaw asked her: 'When did that post traumatic stress disorder kick in, that you didn't want to do boxing anymore?'</p>

<p>'When I was constantly reminded and being told by the police of what happened,' said the woman.</p>

<p>'I was trying to be strong and it overwhelmed me.'</p>

<p>Earlier the court heard that the woman has been arrested in December 2019, for allegedly assaulting a police officer while 'roaring drunk'.</p>

<p>She is currently bringing a claim against the police for unlawful arrest, saying her 'human rights were broken'.</p>

<p>Ms Forshaw asked: 'Did it overwhelm you when you were arrested for assaulting a police office?'</p>

<p>'No comment,' the alleged victim replied.</p>

<p>The former masseuse complained that the constant reminders 'broke her as a strong woman', with police even contacting her when she was on holiday in Santorini.</p>

<p>The barrister asked her: 'Was it that a client touched your bottom that caused you such distress or the idea that you had to go to court and say so on it?'</p>

<p>'The incident that he grabbed my bottom,' said the woman. </p>

<p>Ms Forshaw said: 'I suggest to you deliberately exaggerated the impact on you of what happened in the treatment room with Lord Holmes and what happened when you were drunk and arrested.'</p>

<p>The woman replied: 'I did not exaggerate.'</p>

<p>Jurors heard that the aftermath of the assault left her 'sick all the time' at work due to flashbacks and she had to take many days off.</p>

<p>But Ms Forshaw told her she was 'sickly' prior to the incident and her taking sick days had caused friction with her agency.</p>

<p>Holmes (centre with his meddles), who is a life peer in the House of Lords, is Britain's most successful Paralympic swimmer, with a total of nine golds, five silvers and one bronze</p>

<p>In her statement to the police, the woman said her relationship with her boyfriend had 'become strained' and they argued a lot as a result of the incident.</p>

<p>'You told us you have broken up with [your boyfriend] seven times and you broke up before March 7,' said Ms Forshaw.</p>

<p>'We were on a break, we were not broken up,' replied the woman.</p>

<p>Earlier in her description of the alleged assault, the woman told jurors that Holmes had squeezed her face in an uncomfortable way before moving to her backside.</p>

<p>In her initial statement to the police, however, she said he'd 'patted' her head with an open palm.</p>

<p>'Is the pinching just one of those little bits of details you added as you went along,' asked Ms Forshaw.</p>

<p>'No,' she replied.</p>

<p>Referring to the woman's counselling sessions, Ms Forshaw suggested that this was the first time the 'face pinching' came up.</p>

<p>'Those sessions are extremely private and it makes me extremely embarrassed,' said the woman, her voice shaking.</p>

<p>'Now it is out, everything.</p>

<p>'It is extremely embarrassing for me to go through my counselling notes.</p>

<p>'I thought it was a safe space for me to say what I was thinking.'</p>

<p>Holmes, joined in the dock by his assistance dog, black Labrador, Nancy, denied one charge of sexual assault at London's Southwark Crown Court (file image pictured)</p>

<p>A series of messages the woman had sent to a friend back in Poland in which she suggested Holmes had grabbed her arms was then read out in court.</p>

<p>'After he touched your bum, you are suggesting to [friend] that after what happened he grabbed you by the arms and wanted you to do extras,' said Ms Forshaw.</p>

<p>The woman replied: 'To be honest I didn't want to give her detail.'</p>

<p>She also told her friend that Holmes had held her hand down and kept her against the wall.</p>

<p>'He didn't hold your hand, at least if he did, you didn't tell this jury about it.</p>

<p>'So did it happen or didn't it happen that he held your hand down,' asked Ms Forshaw.</p>

<p>'I don't remember,' said the woman.</p>

<p>The jury also heard that she had initially described Holmes as 'grabbing' her by the shoulder to the police.</p>

<p>Ms Forshaw told her: 'He may have traced your shoulders and I will even suggest that he did trace your shoulders but he didn't grab her shoulders.'</p>

<p>'I don't remember,' she replied.</p>

<p>'The reality is that you build things up in your head and that is what you have done on this occasion,' said Ms Forshaw.</p>

<p>'You thought Lord Holmes had taken a liberty by tracing your silhouette and not just your face and you convinced yourself he must have been a sexual motive.'</p>

<p>Ms Forshaw added that there was in fact 'nothing sexual about what happened.</p>

<p>'And then you added some exaggerated detail you would say and some things you just made up to make it seem more serious than it was,' she added.</p>

<p>'I do not agree with that,' said the woman.</p>

<p>Holmes, who has been attending court each day with a woman thought to be his wife, is joined in the dock by his service dog, a black Labrador called Nancy.</p>

<p>A life peer in the House of Lords, he is Britain's most successful Paralympic swimmer, with a total of nine gold medals, five silvers and one bronze. </p>

<p>Holmes, of Richmond, Surrey, denies one count of sexual assault.</p>

<p>The trial continues. </p>
