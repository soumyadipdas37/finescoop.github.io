<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The BBC will face a backlash from pensioners as it emerges the pay bill for its stars rose by more than £1million last year.</p>

<p>The corporation’s annual report, which is published tomorrow, will show that 76 presenters earn more than the Prime Minister’s wage of £150,000 a year.</p>

<p>The total cost of ‘on-air talent’ rose from £143.6million in 2018/19 to £144.7million last year.</p>

<p>It came as it emerged that the BBC had given pay rises to more than 700 female employees since the start of its equal pay scandal. </p>

<p>A Freedom of Information request revealed that at least 84 women were given pay increases through formal processes between July 2017 and March 2020.</p>

<p>During the same period, 608 women received a pay revision or increase through an informal pay enquiry, the Guardian reported.</p>

<p>The pay revelations are set to reignite fury over the BBC’s decision to strip almost 4million over-75s of their free TV licences.</p>

<p>The BBC has insisted it cannot afford the concession for all pensioners and says only around 900,000 who receive Pension Credit would continue to get it.</p>

<p>Last night pensioners’ groups demanded the corporation slash star pay if they are to expect over-75s to pay for their licences.</p>

<p>It also emerged that the BBC had given pay rises to more than 700 female employees since the start of its equal pay scandal. Pictured: BBC head quarters</p>

<p>Dennis Reed, of pensioners’ campaign group Silver Voices, said: ‘This increase shows a warped sense of priorities by the BBC in a time of difficulty. I would like to see them giving equal priority to poorer pensioners who struggle to pay their licence fee.’</p>

<p>The report shows there are now two stars raking in more than £1million, another earns between £500,000 and £1million, and 73 are on between £150,000 and £500,000.</p>

<p>And it says spend on on-air roles represents 10 per cent of total internal creative content – the same as the year before.</p>

<p>Tim Davie, the BBC’s new director-general, has vowed to slash the number of people employed by the corporation. </p>

<p>But the report is believed to show the total number has barely changed. It also reveals virtually the same number of senior managers as there were in the previous year. </p>

<p>Mr Davie is set to expand on his previous comments about tackling staffing levels in a speech today. </p>

<p>A source said: ‘[Mr Davie] will warn that public service BBC staffing levels must come down in the future.’</p>

<p>The ‘on-air talent’ bill covers those who appear on screen and on the radio. </p>

<p>And Desert Island Discs presenter Lauren Laverne is also set to be announced as one of the BBC’s ten best- paid presenters, having earned £305,000 in 2018/19.</p>

<p>The corporation yesterday declined to comment.</p>
