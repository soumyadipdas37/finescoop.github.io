<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea new boys Hakim Ziyech and Ben Chilwell will miss the start of the Premier League season in a real blow to Frank Lampard, according to reports.</p>

<p>The Blues have been ruthless in the summer transfer window - signing Ziyech (£37m), Chilwell (£50m), Timo Werner (£53m), Kai Havertz (£89m) while also completing free transfers for Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr.</p>

<p>However, according to The Athletic - Chelsea fans will have to wait to see both Ziyech and Chilwell in action after they are set to miss the start of the campaign - in which they begin away at Brighton on Monday - due to injury.</p>

<p>Chilwell is still struggling with a heel injury after signing from Leicester - he has been working his way back to full fitness after picking up the problem against Crystal Palace on July 4.</p>

<p>However, fellow new boy Havertz is on course to make his debut at the Amex Stadium on Monday evening as Lampard's side look to get off to winning ways.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Chelsea have been given a big boost with Christian Pulisic also in line to feature after recovering from a hamstring injury suffered in the FA Cup final defeat against London rivals Arsenal.</p>

<p>After spending £230m in the summer window, the Blues will be desperate to get off to an emphatic start in the Premier League.</p>

<p>Lampard will be looking to make quick inroads with both Manchester City and Liverpool, who have been the dominant forces over the last couple of seasons.</p>

<p>Chelsea secured Champions League football on the final day of last season - finishing fourth, but a massive 33 points behind runaway winners Liverpool. </p>
