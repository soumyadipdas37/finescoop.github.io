<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jack Fincham has deleted a string of Instagram posts, uploaded on bank holiday Monday, featuring him and a marquee-full of people flouting COVID-19 rules.</p>

<p>The Love Island personality, 26, decided to film the event and upload around 10 Instagram Stories on Monday afternoon and evening, as he and his friends attended the BBQ and disco held at The Swan in West Malling, Kent.</p>

<p>But clearly realising that doing this incriminated all involved - making them eligible to be fined £10,000 under the newly enforced rules for mass gatherings - Jack removed the evidence on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Delete! Jack Fincham has deleted a string of Instagram posts, uploaded on bank holiday Monday, featuring him and a marquee-full of people flouting COVID-19 rules</p>

<p>Neither he nor The Swan pub replied to MailOnline's request for comment on Monday evening.</p>

<p>The pub has also removed all traces of the event from their Facebook page, which had previously advertised the party with a picture of a marquee and balloons and details of the food, drink and music.</p>

<p>The Swan charged revelers £120 each for the pleasure - promising to adhere to social distancing and the pandemic public safety guidelines.</p>

<p>It posted the following message ahead of the event: 'Your tables will be positioned 2 metres apart and you will be allowed to dance at your tables only.</p>

<p>Social, not distant! The Love Island personality, 26, decided to film the event and upload around 10 Instagram Stories on Monday afternoon and evening, as he and his friends attended the BBQ and disco held at The Swan in West Malling, Kent</p>

<p>'There won't be a dance floor and we ask that you don't form the conga at any point.</p>

<p>'We will be adhering to COVID-19 guidelines and expect everyone joining us to do the same, if our rules are followed we will stay healthy and safe.'</p>

<p>Yet Jack's social media posts saw him kissing an unknown brunette woman on the cheek while they partied under the marquee, hugging his friends as they drank and dancing with a mass of people as night fell.</p>

<p>The ex-reality personality flouted COVID-19 rules, along with the other attendees, who were all seen crammed into the event despite the 2m+ rules that are still in place in England. </p>

<p>Flouting the rules! The Swan threw a huge event - charging revelers £120 each for the pleasure - promising to adhere to social distancing and the pandemic public safety guidelines</p>

<p>Evidence: Jack, 26, not only attended the event, but filmed himself and all the attendees, plastering it across his social media accounts</p>

<p>The Swan had posted the following message to Facebook ahead of the event: 'Your tables will be positioned 2 metres apart and you will be allowed to dance at your tables only'</p>

<p>Breaking the rules: 'There won't be a dance floor and we ask that you don't form the conga at any point. We will be adhering to COVID-19 guidelines and expect everyone joining us to do the same, if our rules are followed we will stay healthy and safe,' was also promised by The Swan</p>

<p>Oh dear! Yet the footage shared by Jack - who has 2.1 million Instagram followers - saw the exact opposite of what the event planners had promised</p>

<p>Yet the footage shared by Jack - who has 2.1 million Instagram followers - saw the exact opposite of what the event planners had promised.</p>

<p>In a multitude of clips from the day-into-evening event, the attendees were seen in a mass gathering in the centre of the marquee, dancing closely together, with no social distancing rules being followed at all.</p>

<p>The promise to keep attendees to their own tables had, evidently, been abandonned by this point.</p>

<p>Too close: Jack was also seen hugging his friends as they drank and danced at the ticketed event</p>

<p>Musical chairs! The promise to keep attendees to their own tables had, evidently, been abandoned by this point</p>

<p>The party - which featured food, a DJ, tables intended for no more than eight people, and unlimited alcohol - comes after new rules to crack down on mass gatherings came into force on Friday - leading to £90,000-worth of fines issued by Sunday night.</p>

<p>The regulations - with were put in place ahead of the bank holiday weekend - gives police the power to hand out £10,000 fines. </p>

<p>Current government guidelines state people from different households can meet in an outdoor space in a group of up to six. It is also acceptable for people to meet in a  a group of two households in any location.</p>

<p>One of the biggest infringements to have taken part this weekend was the massive illegal lockdown rave in Wales, which was finally shut down by police on Monday.</p>

<p>Meanwhile: One of the biggest infringements to have taken part this weekend was the massive illegal lockdown rave in Wales, which was finally shut down by police on Monday </p>

<p>Some 3,000 revellers descended on an area of woodland near the village of Banwen in the early hours of Sunday morning - with 400 ravers still at the site by Monday evening.</p>

<p>But South Wales Police managed to shut down the rave after around 70 officers, assisted by Dyfed-Powys Police and the British Transport Police, were called out to the wood to execute a dispersal order.</p>

<p>Summons have been issued to 22 ravers, which could see them slapped with £10,000 fines under the new rules.</p>

<p>Assistant chief constable David Thorne wrote on Twitter: 'Rave at Banwen is over! South Wales Police, Dyfed-Powys Police [and] British Transport Police teams have done a fantastic job this weekend of clearing this huge area from the 3,000 strong illegal gathering. Thank you to all involved.'  </p>

<p>You ok? A young woman rests on the ground at the site of an illegal lockdown rave in Wales</p>

<p>Locals voiced complaints about the illegal music festival after rubbish was dumped and ravers defecated over the site.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, rowdy revellers confronted a line of riot shield-wielding police officers in a Norfolk forest on Sunday night, after authorities tried to shut down their 500-person rave.</p>

<p>Crowds of police officers wearing helmets and hi-vis jackets moved in to break up the 'well-established and planned' all-night unlicensed music event in Thetford Forest.</p>

<p>Get out! Around 70 South Wales Police officers, including mounted officers, executed a dispersal order at an illegal rave in the woods near the Welsh village of Banwen</p>

<p>One man was fined £10,000 for a Headingley house party. Another gathering in the same area lead to four people being slapped with the enormous fee, Sky News reports.</p>

<p>Two DJs were fined £10,000 each in Burley; and Jeremy Corbyn's brother Piers received the first £10,000 fine in London for an illegal gathering after he organised a march claiming coronavirus is a hoax.</p>

<p>The 73-year-old meteorologist led more than 10,000 anti-lockdown protesters at the 'Unite for Freedom' rally in Trafalgar Square on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn, the older brother of the former Labour leader, was seen being hauled off by officers after the event and his Twitter account has since confirmed he was slapped with the colossal fine and 'held for ten hours.'  </p>
