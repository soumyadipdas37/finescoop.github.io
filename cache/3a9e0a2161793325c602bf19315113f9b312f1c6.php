<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian mum has shared the ultimate summer DIY project using a pair of macrame rope seats and an old swing set.</p>

<p>The lady, who lives in New South Wales, shared a photo on Facebook of her children's outdoor swing set complete with two adult-sized seats and cushions as well as fairy lights wrapped around the framework.</p>

<p>The result looked like a boho backyard retreat, perfect for lazy afternoon swinging and relaxing chats underneath the setting sun.</p>

<p>'I'm not sure if this has been posted before but it's just an idea for old swing set frames and hanging boho chairs,' she captioned the photo.</p>

<p>It quickly garnered attention online with hundreds of people saying they would like to try a similar 'hack' on the swing sets 'rotting away' at home.</p>

<p>'Excellent idea. I was going to take my swing set down with a sledgehammer but this is a much better option,' one person said.</p>

<p>'Love this so much. I was going to buy another egg chair but not after seeing this,' said another. </p>

<p>A third added: 'I have this saved on one of my Pinterest boards for my dream backyard. I've been saying that I am going to do it for months so I need to get on that'.</p>

<p>'I actually fit my hammock to rest in between the two swing spots so I can lay in it anywhere around the backyard,' one woman said</p>

<p>Other DIY lovers said they'd tried a similar thing after buying macrame hanging chairs off eBay and were glad they didn't just throw their old swing sets away.</p>

<p>'I actually fit my hammock to rest in between the two swing spots so I can put it anywhere in the backyard,' one woman said.</p>

<p>'I love my swing set now! Who would have thought the adults would be using it all these years later,' said another.</p>

<p>Fairy lights were a common addition for added flair, while others indulged with flowers wrapped around the set itself.</p>
