<p>NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance said the tender process to deliver 10km of twin metro railway tunnels has started with the government opening the call for registrations of interest.</p>

<p>'This is a city-shaping project we're seeing,' he told reporters.</p>

<p>Western Sydney Minister Stuart Ayres said 200,000 jobs could be created through the Aerotropolis over the next 20 years.</p>
