<p>Wow! Rihanna's star-studded Savage X Fenty Vol. 2 show was finally underway on Thursday, with models including (L-R) Bella Hadid, the hitmaker herself, Irina Shayk, Cara Delevingne storming the runway in an array of racy looks</p>

<p>Cara set pulses racing in a plunging black velvet bra with silver embroidery, teamed with sexy fishnets and daring black makeup divided her face into a look of two halves.</p>

<p>The British model strutted down the runway in her jaw-dropping ensemble, including towering heeled boots, with her blonde hair styled into an androgynous shaggy fringed style.</p>

<p>Elsewhere Irina paraded her amazing physique in a sheer black lace bra and sequinned shorts, teamed with a long silk robe.</p>

<p>Eye-popping: Backed by shirtless and lace-clad dancers, Irina proved she could be the centre of attention in a sea of stunning models as she strutted down the runway</p>

<p>Getting ready: Meanwhile Bella was transformed into a fishnet clad vixen dressed in a skimpy black lingerie, with the help of three crew members in preparation for her fashionable display</p>

<p>Pose it up: She posed up a storm with her fellow fishnet-clad models, although it seemed some weren't akin to the rules of social distancing</p>

<p>Eye-popping: As she posed alongside the other models, Bella still stood out in her black two-piece and thigh-high PVC boots </p>

<p>Slicking her hair back into a high ponytail, her endless pins were on full display as she strutted down the runway.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile Bella was transformed into a fishnet clad vixen dressed in a skimpy black lingerie and knee-high PVC boots as she strutted her way down the catwalk with her amazing physique on display.   </p>

<p>Behind the scenes it seemed safety was the number one priority as the crew was spotted in masks and protective face shields, though it seemed some of the models weren't akin to the rules of social distancing as they posed together backstage.</p>

<p>Rihanna also told People that part of organising the show was ensured that all of the models were safe in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>She said: 'It was a completely different process this year. We had to work around the challenges of COVID-19, keeping everyone safe and their health at the top of our list. It forced us to figure out new ways to produce a show. </p>

<p>'We had to figure out ways to make this feel as visually enthusiastic as possible. I’m excited, and I’m proud of my team — we pulled it off."</p>

<p>Forbes revealed in 2019 that Rihanna — who's real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty — is the richest female musical artist.</p>

<p>The Diamonds singer's $600 million net worth has eclipsed the fortunes earned by her peers Beyonce, Madonna and Celine Dion, according to the publication. </p>

<p>In addition to her latest fashion ventures, Rihanna dipped into the world of cosmetics in 2017 with Fenty Beauty, a company which accrued nearly $570million in revenue in 2018.</p>
