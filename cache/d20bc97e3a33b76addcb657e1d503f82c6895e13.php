<p>Soipov Abdullokh, 22, who had been stranded in Thailand due to Covid, plunged to his death in Ngao Waterfall National Park, southern Thailand, on Saturday. </p>

<p>Soipov Abdullokh, 22, from Uzbekistan, fell 50ft to his death from a waterfall in Thailand after ignoring warning signs and climbing it in order to take a selfie</p>

<p>Arriving early on Saturday, the group had hiked down a trail to view the 1,000ft waterfall which gives the park its name.</p>

<p>Abdullokh then left the trail and ignored warning signs in order to climb the falls and take pictures, investigators said.</p>

<p>His friends then watched in horror as he slipped and fell around 50ft to his death, landing on sharp rocks below.</p>

<p>It took emergency services around two hours to reach the remote spot, where they found Abdullokh bleeding heavily from the head and nose.  </p>

<p>Chalit Sinrojthanakorn, head government officer for the national park, said: 'The deceased walked off the path set out by authorities to climb the waterfall. </p>

<p>Police said Abdullokh had gone with six Russian friends to view the falls at Ngao Waterfall National Park (pictured) when he slipped and plunged to his death</p>

<p>'He then slipped on a rock and fell. </p>

<p>'His body crashed against the rocks below and he was bleeding through the mouth and nose. The death was very quick.'</p>

<p>The park ranger said that Soipov had 'violated' a ban on climbing the waterfall because he 'wanted to take pictures'.</p>

<p>Police said the tourist's body has been sent to hospital to confirm the cause of death and the Embassy of Uzbekistan has been informed.</p>
