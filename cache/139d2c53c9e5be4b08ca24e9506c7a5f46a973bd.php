<p>Ocado struggled to keep pace with orders during lockdown, when sales increased 44 per cent, and it appeared be facing similar issues after the M&amp;S launch. </p>

<p>Its shares have doubled in value from £10.77 in early March to £22.66, valuing the business at £17billion. </p>

<p>But the bank warned that the shares could now be overvalued because investors are 'overestimating' the number of future partners for its global solutions business, and underestimating 'execution risk'.</p>
