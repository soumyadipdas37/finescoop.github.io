<p>'Wishing you both happiness': Filmmaker Ava DuVernay shared an image from the ceremony on social media and said it had been 'an honor' to witness their wedding</p>

<p>In October, DailyMail.com exclusively reported that the couple's troubles began amid strain over living in different cities, Nash's graphic sex scenes on television and her sexy new look.</p>

<p>In her property settlement, the actress 'gets their house in Bell Canyon, CA and the 2016 Tesla. She also gets to keep her production company, Chocolate Chick,' TMZ reported.</p>

<p>Additionally, the outlet said that Jay, who is an electrical engineer, will keep his 2011 Ford F-150 truck and a $184,820 payout from his ex-wife.</p>

<p>The money is Tucker's cut from the sale of a property they once shared, and aside from that, both parties agreed not to request spousal support. </p>

<p>Interestingly, prior to news of their split being made public, Nash had quietly listed the Bell Canyon home for $1.2 million in July of 2019.</p>

<p>According to sources who spoke with DailyMail.com, the couple had been having issues for nearly two years prior to finally calling it quits. </p>

<p>Betts was there for the last wedding: The two go back in time. Jessica sang at Niecy's wedding to Jay in 2011 in Malibu</p>

<p>Niecy and Jay were married in Malibu in 2011 but their relationship took a turn in part due to the star's full-body cosmetic surgery makeover and her 'extreme career ambitions.'</p>

<p>A source close to the former couple told DailyMail.com at the time: 'Niecy got a brand new body right before she went to film Claws down in New Orleans and that's when their troubles began. Jay was really uncomfortable with her graphic sex scenes on the show and that made their problems worse.</p>

<p>'They were living in two different cities and Jay expressed he didn't like his wife being in New Orleans while he was in LA.'</p>

<p>“You got Divorced? Betts, say less” 😂👽💍</p>

<p>When the comedy-drama had its big premiere in LA in June of 2017, Tucker didn't attend because the couple had been fighting about the show, according to the source.</p>

<p>And while Tucker did attend Nash's ceremony for her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the summer of 2018, he wasn't by her side in September when she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie for her role in When They See Us.</p>

<p>Niecy was also previously married to Don Nash from 1994 to 2007. </p>
