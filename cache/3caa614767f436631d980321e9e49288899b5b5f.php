<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jamie Carragher admitted he was surprised by the standard of Manchester City's performance after their win against Wolves on Monday night. </p>

<p>Goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus secured a 3-1 victory against a side who beat them twice last season.  </p>

<p>It means Pep Guardiola's side, who started the Premier League season late due to their European exploits in the last campaign, are off and running with three points and ex-Liverpool defender Carragher was suitably impressed. </p>

<p>Jamie Carragher was impressed with Manchester CIty's level of performance against Wolves</p>

<p>Gabriel Jesus celebrates his late strike which sealed all three points on Monday evening</p>

<p>'I thought City would lose tonight just for the fact it was the first game,' Carragher told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'United were sluggish first game, Liverpool and Spurs as well. But the way they came out with the energy in the first half it was a real sort of statement really but I thought City were outstanding in the first half. </p>

<p>'How they dealt with the game at 2-1 - 78 minutes gone you’d have thought there’d be a couple of chances for Wolves, but they only had one shot really. '</p>

<p>Carragher also said he would only put Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in a clear bracket ahead of De Bruyne, who once again shone at Molineux. </p>

<p>'I would put him [De Bruyne] top of that second band of players behind Messi and Ronaldo,' Carragher added.</p>

<p>Kevin De Bruyne won and then scored the first-half penalty which sent City on their way </p>

<p>It was an excellent start for Pep Guardiola's side as they look to reclaim the league title</p>

<p>'He’s a manger’s dream. He can play in the No 10 position, he can play right of a three and even speaking to Roberto Martinez he plays him central midfield for Belgium. </p>

<p>'He will have great longevity in his career because I still think he’d have that ability to play that deep role maybe when his legs go a little bit because he’s got a great engine. </p>

<p>'His passing ability is possibly as good as anything we’ve ever seen in the Premier League and he could play that role when he’s in his mid-thirties no problem.'</p>
