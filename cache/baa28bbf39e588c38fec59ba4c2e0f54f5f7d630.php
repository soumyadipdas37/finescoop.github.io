<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the shocking moment a 183ft crane plummeted on to the docks with the operator still inside the cabin after it was hit by one of the world's largest container ships.</p>

<p>The CCTV footage was recorded in the Port of Valencia, Spain, just after 9am as the crane's support legs started to buckle following the unexpected impact. </p>

<p>One docker, identified as Roberto Manez Blanco, 48, was operating the crane at the time it fell.</p>

<p>He was able to warn his colleagues of the impending incident as they scarpered rapidly out of its path but he could not escape the cabin before it collapsed. </p>

<p>Mr Blanco suffered several broken ribs and haemorrhaging as a result of the 183-foot (56-metre) fall to the ground but is reported to be out of danger.  </p>

<p>In the clip, which was recorded on September 13, the large green structure dominates the left-hand side of the screen.</p>

<p>The impact of the MSC Mia container ship, a 400-metre long vessel, is not picked up on camera but the crane can be seen starting to tilt following the collision. </p>

<p>Its metal legs then begin to buckle under the weight as the structure comes crashing to the ground with workers desperately running to get out of its path.</p>

<p>The CCTV footage was recorded in the Port of Valencia, Spain, just after 9am as the crane's support legs started to buckle following the unexpected impact</p>

<p>Mr Blanco, who is being kept in the La Fe Polytechnical University Hospital in Valencia, is thought to have been the only person seriously injured during the incident. </p>

<p>A second video shows the aftermath of the accident with part of the crane structure seen lying across the dock and another part resting in the water.</p>

<p>The camera pans to show the vast Mediterranean Shipping Company vessel that became tangled in the crane's lines after it passed too close. </p>
