<p>More than 300 elephants were killed in Botswana earlier this year from toxins in water produced by cyanobacteria, officials said today.</p>

<p>They announced the results of the investigation into the deaths which had baffled and alarmed conservationists. </p>

<p> More than 300 elephants were killed in Botswana earlier this year from toxins in water produced by cyanobacteria</p>

<p>Locals in the area had reported seeing the elephants walking in circles suggesting they have been neurologically impaired either by a pathogen or a poison. </p>

<p>Cyanobacteria are microscopic organisms common in water and sometimes found in soil. </p>

<p>Not all produce toxins but scientists say toxic ones are occurring more frequently as climate change drives up global temperatures.</p>

<p>Cyril Taolo, deputy director of the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, told a news conference the number of dead elephants had risen to 330. </p>

<p>This was from 281 reported in July, where aerial photos showed their carcasses scattered across the Okavango Delta and other northern parts of the country.  </p>

<p>The first unusual deaths were reported in May when 169 elephants died in a short period at the Okavango Delta, a marshy and lush wildlife habitat.</p>

<p>That number had almost doubled by mid June, with 70 per cent of the deaths occurring around waterholes, according to local sources. </p>

<p> Cyanobacteria are microscopic organisms common in water and sometimes found in soil that had poisoned the watering holes</p>

<p>The department's principal veterinary officer Mmadi Reuben said: 'Our latest tests have detected cyanobacterial neurotoxins to be the cause of deaths. </p>

<p>'These are bacteria found in water.</p>

<p>'However we have many questions still to be answered such as why the elephants only and why that area only? We have a number of hypotheses we are investigating.'</p>

<p>Other animals in the Okavango Panhandle region appeared unharmed.</p>

<p>Some cyanobacterial blooms can harm people and animals, with scientists becoming concerned about their potential impact due to climate change.</p>

<p>This leads to warmer water temperatures, which many cyanobacteria prefer.</p>

<p>Southern Africa's temperatures are rising at twice the global average, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>

<p>'It amounts to having the right conditions, in the right time, in the right place and these species will proliferate,' Patricia Glibert, a professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, who has studied cyanobacteria.</p>

<p>'These conditions are coming together more often, in more places, so we are seeing more of these toxic blooms around the world.'</p>

<p>In Zimbabwe, about 25 elephant carcasses were found near the country's biggest game park and authorities suspect they succumbed to a bacterial infection.</p>

<p>The animals were found with tusks intact, ruling out poaching and deliberate poisoning. </p>

<p>Parks authorities believe the elephants could have ingested the bacteria while searching for food and the carcasses were found near water sources.</p>

<p>'We considered the possibility of cyanobacteria but we have no evidence that this is the case here (in Zimbabwe),' said Chris Foggin, a veterinarian at the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust.</p>

<p>It tested samples from both dead elephants from Zimbabwe and Botswana.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe has sent samples to Britain and is waiting for permits to send samples to two other countries, Foggin said.</p>

<p>Africa's overall elephant population is declining due to poaching but Botswana, home to almost a third of the continent's elephants, has seen numbers grow to around 130,000.   </p>
