<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea's new record signing Kai Havertz says the opportunity to work with Frank Lampard had a 'big impact' in his decision to move to Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>The 21-year-old finally completed a sensational £89m move to the Blues on Friday, in a fee which includes add-ons, after months of speculation about a transfer from Bayer Leverkusen. </p>

<p>Havertz becomes the club's sixth major signing of an incredible transfer window, taking their total spending to an enormous £230m, and the man himself spoke glowingly about his new manager - both as a player and as a coach.  </p>

<p>Kai Havertz has revealed how Frank Lampard's presence made an impact in his decision </p>

<p>Havertz has completed his club-record £89million move to Chelsea from Bayer Leverkusen</p>

<p>'Of course he had a big impact on my decision because I loved him as a player and watched him very often, and I think I can learn from him now he is a manager as well,' Havertz told the official club website. </p>

<p>'I think he is a very humble person and a great guy and I can't wait to play with him and learn from him.</p>

<p>'He was very offensive like me and he loves to score goals, and I love to score goals as well so I think he will help me a lot in my position. Also maybe on the things that I can improve and I can't wait to work with him.'</p>

<p>The 21-year-old German has signed a five-year deal at Stamford Bridge to work with Lampard</p>

<p>Havertz's move makes the 21-year-old the joint most expensive player ever signed by a British club, along with Paul Pogba, who joined Manchester United in 2016. </p>

<p>The Premier League transfer record is £145m, which Liverpool received from Barcelona for Philippe Coutinho. </p>

<p>Havertz, who is in the current squad with the German national team, will also join up with compatriots Antonio Rudiger and fellow summer signing Timo Werner in west London. </p>

<p>The German international becomes the sixth major signing at Stamford Bridge this summer </p>

<p>Fellow German Timo Werner is one of the big names already through the door in west London</p>

<p>'I think it is very exciting because Chelsea has very young players and I know some of the players like Timo [Werner] and Toni [Rudiger],' Havertz added.</p>

<p>'I have played with them in the national team and they are good friends of mine and so I think this is very good for me.</p>

<p>'Also that Chelsea have very young players and English players and that is very nice and a big project. Hopefully we can have many successes.' </p>
