<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jamie Overton has left Somerset to join Surrey on loan ahead of a permanent three-year deal at the Kia Oval.</p>

<p>Overton, 26, had initially asked to make the temporary move in late July when he agreed the long-term switch but was persuaded to remain in Taunton on the proviso that he would be released immediately should he fall out of favour.</p>

<p>And after being omitted from Somerset’s XI for the Vitality Blast win over Glamorgan in midweek, the twin brother of England international Craig requested that the agreement be triggered.</p>

<p>Jamie Overton has joined Surrey on loan from Somerset on an initial loan deal</p>

<p>He could make his debut for Surrey at home to Hampshire in a Twenty20 contest on Thursday, having potentially given up a Lord’s domestic final appearance later this month with Somerset, for whom he has taken 15 first-class wickets at 12.4 runs apiece and scored a maiden hundred this season.</p>

<p>Tom Abell’s team head the midlands group in the Bob Willis Trophy, leaving them well placed to make the five-day showpiece match by virtue of being one of the two teams with the best record after five rounds of matches.</p>

<p>‘I’d like to personally thank Andy Hurry, and Somerset, for their understanding in allowing Jamie to join us on loan with immediate effect and I’m looking forward to seeing Jamie perform in a Surrey shirt,’ Alec Stewart, Surrey’s director of cricket, said.</p>

<p>Overton, who initially requested the switch in late July, has already agreed a permanent deal</p>

<p>Alec Stewart, Surrey's director of cricket, says he is looking forward to the 26-year-old's arrival</p>

<p>Surrey currently have a raft of fast bowlers sidelined through injury or unavailable due to England commitments, meaning that Overton’s early arrival is a rare piece of good news.</p>

<p>Jade Dernbach, Morne Morkel and Liam Plunkett are all ruled out on fitness grounds while the Curran brothers, Tom and Sam, are on international duty.</p>

<p>Hurry, Stewart’s counterpart at Somerset, added: ‘I want to take this opportunity to thank Jamie for all his contributions and commitment to the club over the last 10 years and we wish him well in the next chapter of his career.’</p>
