<p>Swatting, a form of retaliation where people make false reports to get police, often SWAT teams, to descend on a particular address, has become a growing problem.</p>

<p>Vadim Pinskiy (pictured), 35, made up a number of domestic disturbances and violent incidents which never occurred, New Jersey Police say</p>

<p>Lawmakers say internet and gaming culture has increased the number of swatting calls in recent years. </p>

<p>Pinskiy, originally from Uzbekistan, started the hoax calls in June using an anonymous tip-off service.</p>

<p>Over the following months, six more calls were made about violent disturbances at the same address, none of which turned out to be true.</p>

<p>Police traced the IP address making the bogus claims and tracked down Pinskiy.</p>

<p>They found he knew the people at the home he was regularly reporting to police but did not say how.</p>

<p>They arrested Pinskiy at his Promenade Boulevard home last week during a court-warranted search.</p>

<p>Swatting has become a growing problem, with people deliberately sending officers to addresses where no crime has been committed (file image)</p>

<p>He was charged with seven counts of making false reports and harassment, as well as a count of stalking.</p>

<p>Ramsey police sent him to Bergen County Jail after his arrest on Wednesday but he was ordered to be released by a judge the following day.</p>

<p>Under new laws passed in 2015, making false reports can be punished with a prison sentenced of five to 10 years and a fine of up to $150,000. </p>
