<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea are having a transfer window that no other Premier League side has managed before. </p>

<p>The west Londoners have broke the bank this summer, with their spending currently at around £231million - more than any other English top-flight team in a single window - and there could even be more players coming in.</p>

<p>The timing of this free-spending spree by Frank Lampard's Blues is rather peculiar - as the coronavirus pandemic means that the majority of clubs are strapped for cash, with expensive transfer activity expected to be small this year.</p>

<p>With the help of football business account SwissRamble, Sportsmail takes a look at how Roman Abramovich's Blues have managed to stump up all this cash during this window...</p>

<p>Sportsmail looks at how Frank Lampard and Roman Abramovich have spent big in the window</p>

<p>Timo Werner (RB Leipzig) - £50million</p>

<p>Ben Chilwell (Leicester City) - £50million</p>

<p>Hakim Ziyech (Ajax) - £37million</p>

<p>Thiago Silva (Paris Saint-Germain) - Free</p>

<p>Malang Sarr (Nice)  - Free</p>

<p>Kai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen) - £90million (incoming) </p>

<p>SMART PLAYER SALES</p>

<p>One area where Chelsea have helped themselves over the past six years is through generating money through player sales. </p>

<p>There is no hiding the fact that the Blues have spent big over the years. In fact, the west Londoners have spent just as much money (£890million) on players as Manchester City (£892m) and more than Manchester United have (£870m) in the past six years.  </p>

<p>But these losses have been helped by Chelsea selling players properly. In that same period, the Blues have made around £450million from selling some of their stars.  </p>

<p>The sale of players such as Eden Hazard (right) to Real Madrid has helped Chelsea's finances</p>

<p>Against that, #CFC have sold players for £198m over last two years, mainly Eden Hazard £100m (excluding add-ons) and Alvaro Morata £50m, booking an estimated profit from those sales of £173m. The profit is so high, as most departing players were fully amortised in the accounts. pic.twitter.com/l27ts8Fs4b</p>

<p>Ex-winger Eden Hazard is the biggest sale they have managed to make in that time, as Real Madrid snapped him up for around £100million last summer. </p>

<p>Eden Hazard - £100million</p>

<p>Diego Costa - £60million</p>

<p>Oscar - £54million </p>

<p>Alvaro Morata - £50million </p>

<p>Nemanja Matic _ £40million</p>

<p>Thibaut Courtois - £30million </p>

<p>Other high-fee departures such as Alvaro Morata , Thibaut Courtois , Diego Costa, Nemanja Matic and Oscar have allowed the Blues more freedom to operate in the transfer market.</p>

<p>Chelsea were also affected by their transfer ban presented to UEFA, which only allowed them to sign loanee Mateo Kovacic for £40million last summer. </p>

<p>The Blues not only managed to generate even more money by selling Hazard, but they also made several smaller sales which raised even more cash. Look no further than David Luiz to Arsenal, Mario Pasalic to Atalanta and Ola Aina to Torino. </p>

<p>It means that, while the Blues are up there with the two Manchester clubs in terms of overall spend, Chelsea sit well behind the pair in terms of net spend over the last six years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Chelsea also raise money when letting go players on free transfers. Recent high-wage exits include Gary Cahill, Willian and Pedro - who were all on massive wages while at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>But even though the Blues gained no transfer fee for the player, it makes other free signings that command high wages, such as Thiago Silva, much easier to justify. </p>

<p>With Chelsea's squad currently full of players due to their numerous arrivals, do not be surprised if they end up selling even more players this summer for high prices. The Blues are reportedly keen to let go Michy Batshuayi, Danny Drinkwater, Ross Barkley, Emerson Palmieri and Tiemoune Bakayoko this summer. </p>

<p>The Blues have also let go several high-earners such as David Luiz (left) and Gary Cahill (right)</p>

<p>EUROPEAN IMPROVEMENT </p>

<p>Champions League football helps teams in more ways than one. Obviously playing in Europe's premier club competition attracts a higher calibre of wages, but the prize money is a completely different ball game too.</p>

<p>In the 2018-19 season, Maurizio Sarri led Chelsea to the Europa League glory after a 4-1 win over Arsenal in the Baku final. The prize money for winning the competition stood at £18.3million, according to SwissRamble, while the total European earnings from TV money and participation fees led to £41million. </p>

<p>Chelsea earning Champions League football on the final day of the season will help finances</p>

<p>But in the Champions League last term, Chelsea earned £20million for reaching the last-16 stage - where they were knocked out by Bayern Munich - while the additional TV money and other areas of economic gain meant they earned £72million from European competition alone. </p>

<p>With Chelsea securing a top-four finish last season, meaning they are eligible for this hefty source of prize money once again, it means the Blues can justify spending all the money on Werner, Ziyech and the other players as they are likely to reach the Champions League knockouts once again. </p>

<p>The other major boost for #CFC accounts is their return to the Champions League. In 2018/19 they earned £41m TV money for winning the Europa League, but I estimate they will receive £72m for reaching the Champions League last 16 in 2019/20, which is a revenue increase of £31m. pic.twitter.com/xI8wQvwQxE</p>

<p>Clubs get more for playing the Champions League last-16 than for winning the Europa League</p>

<p>CORONAVIRUS HELPS FFP BATTLE</p>

<p>The reason why clubs often limit their financial spending is due to Financial Fair Play (FFP), which UEFA use to make sure the mega-rich clubs do not gain too much of an advantage in the transfer market.</p>

<p>Under FFP rules, teams must make a £27million loss over the course of three years. Each club must take part in the checks, with the next ones scheduled for 2021. </p>

<p>But this year, European football's governing body will 'neutralise the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing clubs to adjust the break-even calculation for revenue shortfalls reported in 2020 and 2021.'</p>

<p>The easing of UEFA's FFP rules due to the coronavirus rules will help Chelsea to spend money</p>

<p>What this means, is that when UEFA check on club's finances in 2021, they will only take down financial results from 2018 and 2019 - but not 2020 which has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>If teams end up making a financial loss over this period, which most teams tend to do, then that figure will be halved by UEFA as they are going easy on clubs due to the global financial uncertainty at the moment.</p>

<p>Up and to the end of the 2018/19 season, Chelsea's finances met UEFA's FFP rules. </p>

<p>Yet even with this significant transfer spree this summer, SwissRamble predicts the Blues to suffer just a £5million loss by the end of 2022 due to the COVID-affected regulations. </p>

<p>On that basis, #CFC will only have a small £5m (€6m) FFP break-even deficit for the 2022 monitoring period, as this will cover 2018 (£95m profit), 2019 (£73m loss) and the average of 2020 (£46m profit) and 2021 (£99m loss), i.e. £27m loss. In other words, they should be fine. pic.twitter.com/Nck0uFGdyX</p>

<p>THE BANK OF ROMAN </p>

<p>Of course, there can't be a story about Chelsea spending millions in the transfer market without mentioning Russian owner Roman Abramovich.</p>

<p>The oligarch has continued his strong investment in the west London club which began in June 2003. </p>

<p>Owner Roman Abramovich has waved his magic money wand to give Chelsea firepower</p>

<p>OK, enough fancy footwork in the accounts. Back in the real world someone will still have to pay the bill. Fortunately for #CFC, they can call on the “Bank of Roman”, as their owner has pumped in £1.3 bln since his arrival, including a chunky £247m in 2019. pic.twitter.com/1fNjoy7JjM</p>

<p>Overall, Abramovich has invested a whopping £1.3billion since 2004, but between 2015 and 2018 he never put in more than £50million-a-year into the Stamford Bridge accounts.</p>

<p>That changed in 2019, when the Chelsea owner invested £247million. In the year where Chelsea raised nearly £200million in player sales, there is little surprise that the Blues have a lot of room to manoeuvre in the current market. </p>
