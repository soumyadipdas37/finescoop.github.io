<p>Paris is set to impose strict new regulations in attempt to slow the spike in coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>Emmanuel Macron's government has ordered bars in Paris, along with Lyon and nine other cities on 'heightened alert', to close at 10pm.</p>

<p>There is also a 10-person restriction at public gatherings with attendees at weddings and parties limited to 30.  </p>

<p>Gyms and other indoor sporting facilities will also remain closed and it remains mandatory for all pedestrians to wear face masks in public areas in the capital. </p>

<p>The move comes as the president tries to avoid imposing a full lockdown across the country with the French economy already set to shrink by 8.7 per cent this year.</p>

<p>The French government recently announced that it would be pumping €100billion (£91billion) into the economy as part of a recovery plan. </p>

<p>Politician Macron hopes that this will help the French economy to get moving again by 2022. </p>

<p>Paris Fashion Week, which is set to host presentations by Kenzo, Kenneth Ize and Schiaparelli, will end on October 6. </p>

<p>The Swedish beauty credited her stage actress mother Maria for helping her to navigate the demands she faced while growing up as a ballerina.</p>

<p>In October's edition of ELLE magazine, Alicia said: 'Being in a leotard looking at your body in a mirror seven hours a day, six days a week and having people talk about your body in front of you and in front of other girls and boys, growing up with that is not healthy. </p>

<p>The Tomb Raider star trained in ballet at the Svenska Balettskolan i Göteborg  (Swedish National Ballet School) in Gothenburg from 1998 until 2004.</p>

<p>At 15, the skilled star relocated from the country's second-largest city to train at the its upper school in Stockholm, where she lived alone in a small flat. </p>

<p>The media personality previously detailed her time at the educational facility in an interview with the Telegraph.</p>

<p>The actress told the publication back in 2015: 'They have a boarding school now but they didn’t have back then.</p>

<p>'I lived in a tiny flat. It was like half a room with a tiny kitchenette. I even had a minibar because it didn’t have a fridge. It was in an old house, beautiful, with wooden floors, but it was basically a big closet.</p>

<p>‘Now when I see 15-year-olds I think, ''how did I do it?'' But it was worse for my mum. I felt horrible leaving her.'</p>

<p> The Anna Karenina star was also instructed at the American Academy of Ballet in New York for one summer.  </p>
