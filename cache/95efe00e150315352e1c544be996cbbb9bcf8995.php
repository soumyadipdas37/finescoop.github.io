<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>As if 2020 wasn’t already proving to be a painful enough year, fraud has soared in lockdown.</p>

<p>Fraud victims are now losing at least £11.5million a day but the real total is estimated at £80million, as only about 15 per cent of cases go reported.</p>

<p>Cases are up 43 per cent in lockdown, according to Action Fraud figures, and the amount lost is up a staggering 286 per cent – meaning a victim loses £8,000 of their savings in average every minute.</p>

<p>So could you fall victim to lockdown fraud?</p>

<p>On this week’s podcast, Simon Lambert and Georgie Frost discuss how people are being conned, the red flags to watch out for, what your rights are if you fall victim and why it’s not enough to think it won’t happen to you.</p>

<p>Also on this week’s show, will the rule of six knock the chance of a V-shaped recovery for six and what on earth is the Government playing at with its Brexit threat to break international law?</p>

<p>And finally, there’s a savings lottery out there with a better chance of winning £50,000 than the Premium Bonds.</p>

<p>Family BS’ windfall bonds have a minimum investment of £10,000 but a one in 714 chance of winning monthly prizes of between £1,000 and £50,000… but there’s a catch, it’s also possible no one will win. So, is it worth signing up?</p>

<p>Fraud cases are up 43% in lockdown but the amount lost has risen by 286% </p>
