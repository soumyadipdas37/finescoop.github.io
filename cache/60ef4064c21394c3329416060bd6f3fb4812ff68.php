<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A smiling Alexei Navalny posed on a hospital balcony with his wife Yulia today as the Russian dissident continues his remarkable recovery from being poisoned with Novichok. </p>

<p>Navalny, 44, held a coffee mug in one hand and wrapped his other arm around his wife's waist as she looked over the skyline of Berlin from the city's Charite hospital. </p>

<p>The Vladimir Putin critic hailed his wife for helping to nurse him back to health after he was taken ill and spent weeks in a medically-induced coma following his exposure to the Soviet-era nerve agent. </p>

<p>'Now I definitely know from experience: love heals and brings you back to life,' he said. 'Yulia, you have saved me, and let it go down in neurobiology textbooks.'</p>

<p>Separately, Navalny today demanded that Russia return the clothes he was wearing when he fell ill on a flight in Siberia last month. </p>

<p>Recovery: Alexei Navalny and his wife Yulia pose for a picture on a balcony of the Charite hospital in Berlin where the Russian opposition leader is being treated </p>

<p>Navalny said in his first blog post since emerging from a coma that there was evidence of Novichok 'in and on my body'. </p>

<p>A German military lab found 'unequivocal evidence' of the substance earlier this month, a finding supported by laboratories in France and Sweden. </p>

<p>Navalny's aides gathered discarded objects from his hotel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk and sent them to German experts who found Novichok on a water bottle. </p>

<p>Suspicion has fallen on Moscow, especially because the nerve agent was the same one used to poison Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, but the Kremlin denies any involvement. </p>

<p>Russia's transport police says it has questioned 200 people in a basic probe, but authorities have yet to open a full investigation. </p>

<p>The Kremlin has played down Germany's finding of Novichok, insisting that medical tests carried out by its own doctors found no poison in Navalny's body.. </p>

<p>Navalny said he 'did not expect anything else' after Russian talk shows suggested that Western intelligence or his own allies had carried out the attack.   </p>

<p>He also demanded that Russian authorities return his clothes, which were removed before he was flown to Germany 'totally naked'. </p>

<p>'Taking into account that Novichok was found on my body, and poisoning through physical contact is highly likely, my clothes are a very important piece of evidence,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'I demand my clothes be carefully packed in a plastic bag and returned to me.' </p>

<p>Outrage at Navalny's poisoning has led to calls for renewed sanctions against Russia, including scrapping the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany.  </p>

<p>The Kremlin has rejected those calls, saying that the pipeline is 'absolutely in line with the interests of both Russia and EU countries'.  </p>

<p>Doctors at the Charite hospital said last week that Navalny's condition 'continues to improve', although possible long-term effects are not yet clear. </p>

<p>At the weekend, a former Soviet scientist who was involved in creating Novichok apologised to Navalny and acknowledged that the substance was used against him. </p>

<p>'I offer my profound apologies to Navalny for the fact that I took part in this criminal business, developing this substance that he was poisoned with,' said Vil Mirzayanov in an interview with Russia's TV Rain on Saturday. </p>

<p>Navalny arrives at Berlin's Tegel Airport after he was airlifted from Russia. Doctors at the German hospital say his condition has been improving </p>

<p>Navalny's allies have pointed the finger at Russian president Vladimir Putin (pictured) after the opposition leader fell ill, but the Kremlin has dismissed the claims </p>

<p>Mirzayanov, who now lives in the United States, wrote the first articles on Novichok's development in the early 1990s.  </p>

<p>'Navalny will just have to be patient but in the end, he should be healthy,' Mirzayanov said, predicting recovery would take 'almost a year.' </p>

<p>He suggested that Navalny most likely took in the poison by mouth, since he appears not to have contaminated others. </p>

<p>So far three scientists, now in their 70s, have made public statements after working on the top-secret Soviet project. </p>

<p>Navalny has long been the most prominent opposition figure in Russia and his allies say he will return to the country once he has recovered. </p>

<p>Putin's spokesman said last week that Navalny would be free to return to Russia, where he has been arrested multiple times in what critics say were politically motivated crackdowns. </p>

<p>Navalny has also been sued over his anti-corruption investigations and was barred from running in the 2018 presidential election, which Putin won.</p>
