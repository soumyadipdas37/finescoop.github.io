<p>Eric Carmichael told CBS that his wife was on the first floor when the accident occurred. </p>

<p>He said she told him that it all happened so fast and there was nothing she could do to help.   </p>

<p>'The lady was trying to put her package into the elevator, like that's how we do it. Take it from the lobby,' Carmichael told the station. </p>

<p>'I guess maybe the package and the woman were over the limit of what the elevator could handle so then what my wife said she saw was the lady's arms like hanging onto her package.'</p>
