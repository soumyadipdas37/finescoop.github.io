<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the moment a delivery driver was caught on camera 'urinating' on a street in front of passing cars. </p>

<p>Yodel customer Tat Jana had been waiting for her delivery at home in Coventry, West Midlands, yesterday when she spotted the unnamed man.</p>

<p>The driver, who is believed to work for Yodel, appeared to duck behind a car door to relieve himself before driving off and leaving behind a puddle of liquid. </p>

<p>She also caught the man tossing parcels into the path of oncoming traffic as he attempted to sort his deliveries.</p>

<p>In the first clip, the courier can be seen standing in the street with dozens of parcels strewn across the floor.</p>

<p>He rummages around in the boot of his blue car as he rearranges packages and throws some more to the ground. </p>

<p>A passing car narrowly avoids flattening a mass of boxes as it attempts to squeeze down the road.</p>

<p>Yodel customer Tat Jana had been waiting for her delivery at home in Coventry, West Midlands, yesterday when she spotted the unnamed man</p>

<p>In a second video, the driver has placed the packages back into his vehicle and is leaning against the passenger side of his car with the door open.</p>

<p>A woman and young girl work past the car before the driver appears to relieve himself. </p>

<p>He looks around constantly before eventually emerging from around the side of the vehicle as he readjusts the crotch of his trousers.</p>

<p>The man then gets in his car and drives away but leaves behind a wet patch which is seen trickling into the road.</p>

<p>Ms Jana took to a Yodel complaints group earlier today to share her experience.</p>

<p>She posted the videos saying: 'I was waiting for my package yesterday. Looked out the window so as not to miss' with angry emojis.</p>

<p>Her post has horrified fellow group members as one wrote: 'Ewwww nice, not.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'What a dirty and disgusting article that driver is, tut.'</p>

<p>And one man said: 'What the actual f***? So grim.'</p>

<p>Speaking afterwards, Ms Jana added: 'I was in shock, people are waiting for their parcels and he throws them on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>'You can see him go to the toilet too.</p>

<p>'I saw him on Monday as well throwing parcels, I was worried he might have mine and break it so I took the video.</p>

<p>'Then I looked out the window yesterday and saw the same courier.'</p>
