<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona have targeted Gini Wijnaldum in a move that could see Thiago Alcantara become his replacement at Liverpool.</p>

<p>Wijnaldum, the Holland international, has entered the final year of his contract and Liverpool have not opened talks with the midfielder about new terms. Liverpool have allowed players to run down deals before — Emre Can is the best example — but whether they will now is debatable.</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman, Barcelona’s new head coach, is a huge fan of midfielder Wijnaldum, having built a strong relationship with him from the time he was in charge of the national team. Now he is eager to be reunited with the 29-year-old.</p>

<p>Barcelona are interested in signing Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum in this window</p>

<p>Reports in Spain on Wednesday claimed Wijnaldum has agreed personal terms with Barcelona but Liverpool insist there has been no official contact between the clubs nor have they received a bid for Wijnaldum, an influential player whom manager Jurgen Klopp holds in high regard.</p>

<p>There has been no sign from Wijnaldum, either, that he is unsettled or wants to agitate for a move but there is little doubt that Barcelona want to add his experience as they begin the process of rebuilding in the wake of their Champions League calamity.</p>

<p>If Wijnaldum ends up leaving Liverpool he could be replaced at Anfield by Thiago Alcantara</p>

<p>Wijnaldum is highly regarded by new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman from their time with the Dutch national team</p>

<p>Liverpool signed Wijnaldum from Newcastle for £25million in 2016. Given his standing in the squad and the value he gives to the team, they would look to recoup that fee at the very least. Should they do that, it would then pave the way for a move for Thiago.</p>

<p>The Spain midfielder has his heart set on moving to Anfield. He is in a similar contractual position to Wijnaldum, in that he has entered the last 12 months and Bayern Munich have made it clear they want £30m for him.</p>

<p>Klopp has been on record and expressed his admiration for Thiago, who once turned down a move to Manchester United. If Wijnaldum goes, Liverpool’s manager would need a quality replacement and 29-year-old Thiago, who excelled in Bayern’s Champions League triumph, would fit the bill.</p>
