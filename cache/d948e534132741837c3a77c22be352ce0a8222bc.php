<p>Alvaro Morata has touched down in Italy ahead of a sensational return to former side Juventus</p>

<p>The striker left the Serie A club to join Real Madrid in 2016 but is set to rejoin the club on loan</p>

<p>Morata scored 12 goals and made two assists for Atletico in the 2019-2020 season after making his loan move from Chelsea permanent last summer.</p>

<p>The forward never hit the heights expected of him at Stamford Bridge but fared better in LaLiga, where he managed 43 goals in 112 games for both Atletico and Real.</p>

<p>The striker scored 15 goals across two years in his first spell with Juve but Morata is arguably the club's second choice after missing out on Suarez. </p>

<p>The 27-year-old gave a thumbs up to the cameras before being driven off to finalise his move</p>

<p>Morata's exit will now pave the way for Luis Suarez to join Atletico Madrid from Barcelona</p>

<p>Juve had long held an interest in the Barca man and he passed an Italian exam Perugia last week in order to acquire dual nationality, with the club being unable to bring in any more non-EU players in this transfer window following the arrivals of Arthur Melo and Weston McKennie. </p>

<p>But manager Andrea Pirlo admitted the move would be difficult because of the time it takes for a passport to be approved with October 5 the deadline for moves to be completed.</p>

<p>The complications allowed Atletico to swoop in with Diego Simeone set to pair Suarez up front with Diego Costa with Morata making way for the 33-year-old.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan's six-year stint at the Nou Camp is coming to a bitter end despite him being Barca's third highest goalscorer of all time.</p>

<p>New manager Ronald Koeman made it clear the striker was not part of his plans and he was told to find a new club for the upcoming season. </p>
