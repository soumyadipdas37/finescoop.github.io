<p>Bayern Munich have won the German Super Cup after beating Borussia Dortmund 3-2</p>

<p>Joshua Kimmich exhibited some world-class improvisation to score the late winner for Bayern</p>

<p>The goal came from a text-book counter attack after Kimmich intercepted the ball on the halfway line. </p>

<p>Charging down the pitch at pace, Kimmich played in Robert Lewandowski before receiving the ball back.</p>

<p>The German international picked up the ball between the edge of the box and the penalty stop and shot at goal.</p>

<p>Goalkeeper Marwin Hitz made an initial save but what happened next was never to be expected.</p>

<p>As Kimmich fell to the ground, the 25-year-old managed to connect with the rebound to flick the ball past the Dortmund keeper to secure a win for Bayern. </p>

<p>Fans were quick to take to social media to discuss whether the striker's goal was pure luck or calculated.  </p>

<p>Some fans felt that Kimmich meant to connect with the ball in the way that he did. </p>

<p>One Twitter user wrote: 'Of course he did, clearly see his leg go out to meet the ball. Great instincts.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'He definitely meant that! You can see the way he moves his foot towards the ball and angles it too! Amazing goal!!' </p>

<p>While others claimed that the 25-year-old could never seen have happening coming but believed he made an attempt to connect with the ball. </p>

<p>One fan Tweeted: 'He meant to shove his foot out and hope to do something with the ball. Did he mean exactly that to happen? Nah, just shove a foot out and hope.'</p>

<p>Others, however, took a more cynical approach, saying: 'Anyone who knows football knows he didn't mean that. Silly question'.</p>

<p>Speaking of his team-mates goal, Manuel Neuer said it was combination of 'will and talent'</p>

<p>While Bayern manager Hansi Flick said that Kimmich's 'mentality has been very special'</p>

<p>Speaking of his team-mates goal, Manuel Neuer said it was combination of 'will and talent'. </p>

<p>He said: 'That was will and talent at the same time. He did not stay on the ground and still chips the ball in. He's just a good player.' </p>

<p>Bayern head coach Hansi Flick agreed with his goalkeeper's comment, telling ZDF: 'As long as I've known him, his mentality has been very special. He is well on his way to being one of those players who shapes this team and this club.</p>

<p>'I always look, when can I give him a break? But then you have to reckon with his anger, he always wants to be on the pitch.'</p>
