<p>People will get an online identity that can be used for daily activities such as proving ones age, registering with a GP and buying properties from a different location.</p>

<p>It comes after issues emerged in identifying people during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as during the self-employment income support scheme.</p>

<p>The government did not have any details on half of the 2.6million who applied for support at the start of the crisis.</p>

<p>Some - such as Tony Blair - called for new digital ID cards to prove their 'disease status' as the world relaxed lockdown measures.</p>

<p>Downing Street is planning new digital ID cards for British citizens as Dominic Cummings (pictured yesterday) bids to transform the Government's use of data despite privacy fears</p>

<p>Minister for digital infrastructure Matt Warman told the Times he was excited to 'work with partners in the private sector'.</p>

<p>Cabinet Office minister Julia Lopez added: 'There is a need and an expectation for the government to make it easier for people to use digital identities quickly, safely and securely, and we are committed to enabling this.'</p>

<p>But naysayers have said the plans to 'remove regulatory barriers' would result in problems over privacy.</p>

<p>Matthew Rice of the Open Rights Group said: 'If the public don't trust that their data is going to be secure, they are not going to engage with the system no matter how seamless or frictionless.'</p>

<p>Boris Johnson's chief adviser Mr Cummings has been a vocal critic of privacy laws in the past.</p>

<p>He branded the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation 'a legal and bureaucratic nightmare' on his blog two years ago.</p>

<p>Former Prime Minister Mr Blair has previously argued in favour of the use of digital ID cards for British citizens.</p>

<p>He said only if people can easily show whether they are clear of coronavirus will industries such as international travel be able to restart.</p>

<p>Speaking at the virtual CogX technology conference in June, Mr Blair said such a system would operate alongside track and trace programmes.</p>

<p>Former Prime Minister Mr Blair (pictured in February) has argued in favour of the use of digital ID cards for British citizens</p>

<p>He said: 'You can create a digital ID today that is much more easily protected so you can deal with a lot of the privacy and surveillance issues that worry people.</p>

<p>'It is a natural evolution of the way that we are going to use technology in any event to transact daily life and this Covid crisis gives an additional reason for doing that.</p>

<p>'I think people's disease status - have they been tested, what is the result of that test and have they had the disease, do they have the disease - unless you are able to record some of this data in a way people can use, it is going to be difficult to go back to anything like a near normal in things like transport.</p>

<p>'If you are going to start international travel again, how can you do that unless people can be easily tested and have some record of that test?</p>

<p>'There has always been a good case for introducing some form of digital ID but I think that case is even more powerful today.'</p>

<p>Mr Blair acknowledged the use of technology risked leaving behind people less comfortable using it, but said it could be addressed through training and education.</p>

<p>He said: 'That digital divide between those that are familiar and can use the new technology well and those who can't is obviously going to be a big source of difficulty.</p>

<p>But he said people would need to adapt as some sectors of the economy would be changed forever as a result of the virus.</p>

<p>He added: 'I can't see the travel, tourism, hospitality industries coming back fast. I think bricks and mortar retail has probably had its day - certainly in its present form.'</p>
