<p>Jordan Crosby was taking snaps of the surf crashing against Seaham Lighthouse in County Durham at sunrise on Friday. </p>

<p>He spent half an hour capturing the shots form the harbour with his Nikon D5 camera as the waves towered over the 30ft-tall lighthouse.</p>

<p>It was only when Jordan got home that he noticed he had inadvertently captured the uncanny resemblance of The King emerging from the ocean with his trademark quiff.</p>

<p>Jordan Crosby, 26, was taking snaps of the surf crashing against Seaham Lighthouse in County Durham at sunrise on Friday when he saw face of Elvis appear in a giant wave</p>

<p>Jordan, 26, of Hartlepool, said: 'It was pretty wild out there so I thought it would make for some dramatic pictures.</p>

<p>'I pulled out my winter coat for the first this year and headed up there at sunrise to see what I could get.</p>

<p>'The forecast was for 40mph winds and the waves were meant to be 50ft or 60ft. It was certainly ferocious.</p>

<p>'The images aren't really that technically difficult to get, it was more about dealing with the weather, and after 30 minutes I headed home to see what the pictures were like.</p>

<p>It was not until the photographer got home that he noticed he had inadvertently captured the uncanny resemblance of The King emerging from the ocean with his trademark quiff</p>

<p>'When I put them online somebody said you can see Elvis' face in one of the waves.</p>

<p>'I thought he was having me on, but once you see it you can't miss it. Sure enough there he was emerging from the sea.</p>

<p>'You can see his quiff really well, then a nose and his face. It's amazing really, everybody loves Elvis so to capture an image of The King was really special.'</p>

<p>The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings as heavy rain and 65mph winds were forecast in some part of the UK today.</p>
