<p>Land searches have been carried out in a bid to find the young man's body. And detectives have made an appeal to the author of a letter relating to his disappearance.</p>

<p>That September 24, the anonymous handwritten letter was posted to Guisborough Police Station. Details of what was contained in the letter have not been revealed by those heading the investigation.</p>

<p>However Detective Chief Inspector Shaun Page is appealing for the letter writer to call Crimestoppers anonymously or the investigation team directly and give them any additional information that they may have.</p>

<p>He said: 'For operational reasons I can't divulge the contents or topic of the letter, but it was sent through the post and addressed to the incident room at Guisborough Police Station.</p>

<p>'The person who sent it may know more that could help our inquiry team. They obviously felt compelled to write the letter seven years after his disappearance and I would like to hear from them again now.'</p>

<p>Anyone with information can use the Cleveland Police section of the Major Incident Public Portal via https://mipp.police.uk/, call Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
