<p>And while Izzy Sharman-Firth may not have the best odds at the moment, she insists her connection with leading man Locky Gilbert is stronger than producers would have you believe.</p>

<p>Despite having the least amount of screen time out of the top four, the 29-year-old HR adviser claims she had several intimate moments with Locky in the mansion - but they weren't show on TV.</p>

<p>Don't write her off yet! Despite having the least amount of screen time out of the final four, The Bachelor's Izzy Sharman-Firth claims she had several intimate moments with Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>She told TV Week that 'things moved really quickly' between her and Locky, 31, after they returned to the mansion following three and a half months of lockdown.</p>

<p>Izzy went on to reveal that the pair 'shared a few kisses the other girls didn't know about' and also had in-depth conversations that didn't make the edit.</p>

<p>'Locky opened up about how strongly he felt towards me, and quite a few times told me he was falling for me,' she added. </p>

<p>The romance you didn't see: She told TV Week 'things moved really quickly' between her and Locky, 31, after they returned to the mansion following three and a half months of lockdown</p>

<p>As The Bachelor heads into finale week, Izzy is the least likely to win Locky's heart - with Sportsbet offering long odds of $15 as of Monday. </p>

<p>By contrast, Irena Srbinovska is the favourite ($1.30), Bella Varelis is tipped for runner-up ($3.25) and intruder Bec Cvilikas is expected to place third ($7.50).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Locky confirmed on Monday he was still dating his winning contestant.</p>

<p>The former Australian Survivor star, 31, told TV Week he was '110,000 per cent in love' with his chosen lady and 'can't wait to tell people how great she is'. </p>

<p>While Locky admitted he hadn't 'been able to catch up much' with his girlfriend since shooting the finale in July, he made it clear they were still together.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, he concluded: 'It will be amazing [after Thursday] to just be in public together and have a normal relationship. It seems small, but I can't wait to just go for a walk together and grab a coffee.</p>

<p>'I'm over the moon and can't wipe the smile off my face. I couldn't be happier and can't wait to share it with the world.'</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>
