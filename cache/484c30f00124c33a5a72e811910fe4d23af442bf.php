<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An entrepreneurial 10-year-old boy who went toe-to-toe with tech giants Sony says he has come out on top after a two-year legal battle over a trademark.Â </p>

<p>Angus Copelin-Walters was just eight when his company Croc Candy lodged a trademark for 'Croc Tank' in 2017.</p>

<p>The plan was to create a vehicle to mentor and help children like Angus, who has dyslexia, develop ideas and learn about finance.</p>

<p>The name was inspired by the hit TV show Shark Tank on which entrepreneurs pitch their inventions and ideas to investors to obtain funding.</p>

<p>Angus Copelin-Walters was just eight when he lodged a trademark for 'Croc Tank' in 2017 in the hopes of kickstarting a mentoring initiative to help other kids develop ideas and learn about finance</p>

<p>Angus Copelin-Walters (pictured with his family) has won a two-year legal battle against Sony after the tech company locked the young businessman in a trademark dispute</p>

<p>But his plans were quickly put on halt when he went to sign up 'Croc Tank' and Sony Pictures Television, who own Shark Tank and the trademark, objected.</p>

<p>'We talked about it and some people said not to worry but Angus wanted to keep going,' his mother, Joanne Walters, told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'It's actually a process that goes through IP Australia, it's not actually the court system at that stage.'</p>

<p>Angus stood his ground for more than two and a half years as the legal case continued to progress, with his family hiring a lawyer.</p>

<p>'Then it went into negotiations so Angus withdrew the trademark in the end under the settlement, and that's what he was happy with,' Ms Walters said.</p>

<p>Angus had been running his Croc Candy company for more than a year when he thought of the innovative idea to help other kids with learning difficulties</p>

<p>'Sony were just protecting their brand... though I don't think a boy from Darwin is a really big threat.'</p>

<p>Angus, a huge fan of the Shark Tank, fell in even more love with the show after finding out three of the US-based 'Sharks' also have dyslexia.</p>

<p>The budding businessman said he was happy with the confidential settlement he reached with Sony after fearing the legal battle would never end.</p>

<p>'The dispute was not a court case. It was a process of opposition through IP Australia and then a negotiation to reach a settlement,' Ms Walters said.</p>

<p>With both the legal stoush and the coronavirus pandemic hitting this year, Angus hasn't stopped with his business ideas.</p>

<p>Angus is a huge fan of the show Shark Tank and is inspired by the ideas, and was even moreso a fan after finding out three of the US-based 'sharks' also have dyslexia</p>

<p>During lockdown he learnt how to sew and now has a new brand 'Ango Mango'.</p>

<p>'We started to make some walker bags and coasters for people to brighten up their day just as a bit of a surprise,' Ms Walters said.</p>

<p>'That developed onto people asking him to make some other bags and while it was quiet with the candy it's been going really well.'</p>

<p>'Making things are being creative is helping him, I guess I think dyslexic people are like that. They just have a different way of thinking and so that's why this entrepreneurship is suiting his personality.'</p>

<p>Angus' workshops for kids kick off during October Business Month with the revised name Kids Can.</p>
