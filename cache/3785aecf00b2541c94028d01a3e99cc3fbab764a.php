<p>As a diner in one of my restaurants said yesterday: 'Frankly, at this point, I would feel safer if the coronavirus held a press conference telling us how it's going to protect us from the Government.'</p>

<p>Congratulations, Downing Street! The Cabinet has achieved the impossible and unified the nation. Whatever our politics, wherever we live in Britain, we all think they're idiots</p>

<p>I am beside myself with frustration at the latest measure: imposing a 10pm curfew on the hospitality industry. </p>

<p>Pubs and restaurants that have been helping to keep people safe with stringent hygiene and social distancing measures must eject everyone on to the streets at the stroke of 10pm.</p>

<p>Last Friday and Saturday, soon after 10pm, I walked through Soho in Central London and the area was like an illegal rave, with thousands of people mingling noisily. </p>

<p>It was mayhem. Many were simply partying in the street. </p>

<p>Others were trying to get away, cramming cheek-by-jowl into Ubers and black cabs, or milling around, waiting for the Tube and buses to be less jammed.</p>

<p>It would be ridiculously naive to suppose they were all going home to bed. </p>

<p>Across London, people were heading to illegal house parties, where there would be no precautions against the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>For the Government to shut us down at 10pm is counter-productive and destructive (pictured scientific advisors Sir Chris Whitty (left) and Sir Patrick Vallance (right)) </p>

<p>Vigilant</p>

<p>By invoking powers that most of us did not know were legal and imposing this ludicrous curfew, the Government is herding countless drinkers and diners away from safe environments.</p>

<p>Frankly, it turned my stomach to see pictures last week of council-funded 'inspectors' wearing high-visibility jackets, patrolling Soho and peering into letterboxes to check nobody inside was having fun after the curfew.</p>

<p>No one is better equipped for keeping customers safe than the hospitality industry. </p>

<p>We have the staff, the infrastructure and the motivation — it's vitally important to us that we enable people to meet on our premises while shielding them from the risk of catching the coronavirus.</p>

<p>The most reliable figures I've seen suggest that a mere 3 per cent or 4 per cent of Covid-19 infections occur across pubs, restaurants and even hotels.</p>

<p>That's far less than the transmission rate on public transport, for instance, or practically anywhere else.</p>

<p>After 45 years in the restaurant business I know that as long as they are with us, they are in almost no danger.</p>

<p>Our kitchens — at restaurants including The Wolseley, The Delaunay and Brasserie Zedel — are proven to be safer than the average domestic kitchen. </p>

<p>In the dining areas, waiting staff are scrupulous about ensuring patrons are masked when they are not at their tables, and that customers are well-separated. </p>

<p>They take their responsibility very seriously because they know their jobs depend on it.</p>

<p>There is no need for Covid marshals in a restaurant. Every waiter has to be vigilant.</p>

<p>To shut us down at 10pm is counter-productive and destructive. Famously, many restaurants survive on very tight margins. </p>

<p>You might think closing at 10pm rather than 11pm would make little difference: it's only an hour, after all. </p>

<p>But in many cases, that means that a 'second sitting' is impossible — and with it goes any chance of turning a profit.</p>

<p>It really does feel as if a specially commissioned think tank has been assembled to find ways of bringing Britain's restaurant industry to its knees. </p>

<p>The threat of draconian fines for people caught disobeying rules that no one (not even the Prime Minister) can explain, the flip-flopping policies (and, in London, the seven-day congestion charge) all combine to threaten with an extinction a sector that employs three million hardworking people across the UK.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson's mixed messages are beyond parody. 'Go to work / Don't go to work. Eat out to help out / Drink up and go home.'</p>

<p>All this conspires to make people feel that restaurant dining simply isn't worth the trouble. </p>

<p>We don't know what we're allowed to do and so, being a law-abiding nation, we end up doing nothing.</p>

<p>All over Britain, cafes and restaurants, the independents as well as the big chains, are being wrecked. </p>

<p>My establishments cater to a wide demographic, but no one is immune to the effects of the disaster.</p>

<p>Tragedy</p>

<p>Mercifully, many of us are supported by loyal customers who help us keep our heads above water. </p>

<p>The atmosphere in my restaurants has actually been quite electric, buzzing with the dogged determination of our regulars to keep enjoying themselves in spite of confused and counterproductive government edicts.</p>

<p>But thousands of places have been unable to open again. They've gone under, and I'm afraid more will follow. </p>

<p>That is a tragedy for the customers to whom favourite restaurants are very special: one diner described it to me as 'a kind of bereavement'.</p>

<p>When people treat themselves to a meal out, they are not only buying food. </p>

<p>They want to enjoy a special atmosphere with friendly, welcoming staff who recognise them and make them feel valued. Every restaurant is a sort of club for its regulars.</p>

<p>Even if some of the shuttered businesses might one day reopen, that ambience will be gone. </p>

<p>Different staff will be hired, in many cases, because the old ones have been forced to seek work elsewhere.</p>

<p>An atmosphere that took years to be lovingly built up is snuffed out.</p>

<p>For me, that is heart-breaking. My staff are like my family. I've known them for many years and their contribution has been invaluable. </p>

<p>We've been desperate to avoid redundancies, but Chancellor Rishi Sunak's furlough scheme was cruel to restaurant workers as it failed to take into account tips and service charges.</p>

<p>As a result, many of my staff were reduced to about 40 per cent of their earnings, instead of 80 per cent. </p>

<p>I know staff who are facing eviction for non-payment of rent and others who have racked up dangerous levels of debt.</p>

<p>We are doing everything we can to support them, but the only realistic way to help is to get them back to work. </p>

<p>That's why I've taken the huge gamble of reopening our restaurants (the three I have already mentioned, plus Colbert, Soutine and Fischer's). This isn't business as usual. It's about people's livelihoods.</p>

<p>All this sacrifice might feel more worthwhile if I had any confidence in the medical science behind the curfew. </p>

<p>Instead, I have yet to meet a person in the medical profession who believes the Government is doing the right thing.</p>

<p>Misguided</p>

<p>One of the pleasures in owning restaurants is the opportunity it provides to meet a range of people one might otherwise never talk to.</p>

<p>In recent days I have chatted to the director of a hospital trust, an epidemiologist and several doctors. </p>

<p>Like me, they fear this policy is deeply misguided and will cause further economic misery.</p>

<p>Worse even than the curfew is the panic that has turned cities into ghost towns. This mindless over-reaction is destroying the fabric of the country.</p>

<p>Parts of my industry will be able to withstand the curfew, at least in the short term. </p>

<p>But millions of jobs in all industries will be lost, undermining the British economy, if the emptying of our cities continues.</p>

<p>Curfews and lockdowns cannot kill Covid-19. Sadly, the virus will just flare up again.</p>

<p>But these insane policies can kill countless individual businesses — and with them our whole way of life.</p>
