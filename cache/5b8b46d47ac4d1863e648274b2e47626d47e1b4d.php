<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain's Indian summer heatwave is set to come to an end this week as the threat of a new lockdown looms over the UK - with temperatures set to plummet from tomorrow after heavy rain sweeps in from the north. </p>

<p>Those in southern England will continue to bask in glorious 77F (25C) temperatures following a misty start today, before 'wintry' Arctic conditions are expected to sweep across the nation alongside potential 65mph winds by Thursday.</p>

<p>Cloudy conditions and washouts will cause temperatures to drop in the North West of England and parts of Scotland tomorrow, with a 'marked change' in weather expected throughout the rest of the week. </p>

<p>The gloomy weather comes as Boris Johnson looks set to make an announcement on any new Covid-19 restrictions tomorrow, as pressure builds for the Prime Minister to plunge Britain into a second lockdown. </p>

<p>Sir Patrick Vallance today warned the UK faces 50,000 new daily cases of coronavirus by the middle of October and more than 200 deaths everyday by November if the disease is not brought under control. </p>

<p>The Chief Scientific Adviser gave the warning as Professor Chris Whitty warned the UK has 'in a bad sense literally turned a corner' with rising rates of infection and that the nation needs to view the fight against the disease as a 'six month problem' before science eventually can 'ride to our rescue'. </p>

<p>'We need an alternative.'</p>

<p>Another said: 'Lockdown Number 2 incoming. But with people in a much worse frame of mind and the weather being much s*****r.'</p>

<p>A third user added: 'The "advantage" of the lockdown was that it was spring/summer and lovely weather.</p>

<p>'Six months indoors during the winter isn't appealing for many! More people will just say "f*** this".'</p>
