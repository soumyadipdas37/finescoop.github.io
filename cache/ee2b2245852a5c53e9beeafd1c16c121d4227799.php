<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Patrice Evra has conceded he is 'tired' of Manchester United's lacklustre performances and has called on his former club to sign new players after their defeat to Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side fell to a 3-1 defeat to the Eagles in their Premier League opener and looked bereft of attacking guile while questions were asked of their defence once again.</p>

<p>Former United man Wilfried Zaha came back to haunt his old club with two strikes following Andros Townsend's opener, while Donny van de Beek's strike was nothing more than a consolation for United.</p>

<p>Patrice Evra says he is 'tired' of the situation at Manchester United and said it is 'deja vu'</p>

<p>United fell to a 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace to get their season off to a horrendous start</p>

<p>And Evra, who was a fan favourite during his time playing under Sir Alex Ferguson at United, has revealed he is 'tired' when talking about United and feels there is a lot of negativity around the club.  </p>

<p>'Lacking everything, mainly the cohesion,' he said on Sky Sports. 'I can't say first game as an excuse. Crystal Palace had no fear and came to destroy Man United. </p>

<p>'[There is] so much negativity around the club such as the transfers and the club don't do nothing about it. </p>

<p>Defensive frailties came to the fore as United shipped three goals in a shocking performance</p>

<p>'It feels like deja vu and I'm tired, I'm a positive man but I feel exhausted after the first game of the season so good luck to all the Man United fans.'</p>

<p>The Frenchman feels it may be a long and arduous season for his former club, adding that many United supporters will feel disappointed about their transfer activity this summer. </p>

<p>'It would be difficult this season. We can see in the transfer window, a lot of United fans are disappointed.</p>

<p>Evra said he is disappointed with transfer activity and wanted more after Bruno Fernandes</p>

<p>'I think we make more impact on social media and in the papers than the reality. Because in the end we buy no players, or at least Van de Beek.</p>

<p>'But we need more, after Bruno Fernandes I was expecting more, like a lot of United fans.'</p>

<p>United have around three weeks to complete their transfer business, with the club heavily linked with a move for Jadon Sancho for the duration of the summer window.  </p>
