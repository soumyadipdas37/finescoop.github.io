<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Iggy Azalea has certainly bounced back since the birth of her first child earlier this year. </p>

<p>In a recent TikTok video, the 30-year-old flaunted her flat, toned tummy and curvaceous derriere in a tiny string bikini.</p>

<p>The rapper didn't have an inch to pinch as she danced and gyrated around in the skimpy swimwear.</p>

<p>Flaunt it! In a recent TikTok video, Iggy Azalea flaunted her flat, toned tummy and curvaceous derriere in a tiny string bikini</p>

<p>In another TikTok video, Iggy showed off her enviable pear-shaped hips and tiny waist in a tight black dress with a corset.</p>

<p>The hitmaker put safety first by wearing a black face mask that matched her dress.</p>

<p>Iggy recently denied that her incredible post-baby body was the result of plastic surgery.</p>

<p>She told a fan on Twitter that her toned physique was down to a healthy diet and the fact that she was already in great shape before falling pregnant.</p>

<p>Perfection: The rapper didn't have an inch to pinch as she danced and gyrated around in the skimpy swimwear</p>

<p>And while that may well be true, it doesn't mean that Iggy has never gone under the knife before.</p>

<p>She has openly admitted to undergoing some procedures, including rhinoplasty and a breast augmentation.</p>

<p>The blonde bombshell has denied having butt implants, but there has been speculation that she may have undergone a Brazilian butt lift.</p>

<p>Plastic surgeon to the stars, Michael Salzhauer (aka Dr. Miami), who has not operated on the rapper, told Daily Mail Australia last year that Iggy's 'shape' is a dead giveaway. </p>

<p>Shapely: In another TikTok video, Iggy showed off her enviable pear-shaped hips and tiny waist in a tight black dress with a corset</p>

<p>'Her shape and personal history makes me think she has,' he said, adding that telltale signs of a Brazilian butt lift include: 'A very small waist and big buttocks. Also, tiny scars in the lower buttocks creases, they are usually very hard to find.' </p>

<p>A Brazilian butt lift is a form of buttock augmentation, which enhances the size and shape of a patient's bottom using a fat transfer from other areas of the body.</p>

<p>Iggy, who is often hailed by fans for her womanly curves, previously told Sway Calloway on Sway in The Morning that her bottom is completely natural.</p>

<p>'Of course the butt is mine. I heard it's not a real butt, I've heard it's a number of things,' she said in 2013.</p>

<p>'I heard sometimes it's my underpants. I heard it's implants. All kinds of crazy things. It's my flesh, it's my butt.'</p>

<p>The Kream hitmaker welcomed her son, Onyx, in May. While she hasn't confirmed it, the child's father is believed to be her boyfriend, Playboi Carti.</p>
