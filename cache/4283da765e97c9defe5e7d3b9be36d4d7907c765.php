<p>The 94-year old trust is facing a turning point. After its manager Alastair Mundy of Ninety One took a leave of absence due to ill health in April, it has appointed Nick Purves and Ian Lance of RWC to run the trust going forward.</p>

<p>What does it invest in? </p>

<p>Even with the new managers, the trust has confirmed it will keep its value-style of investing – picking unloved stocks in the belief they will deliver solid performance. </p>

<p>It mainly focuses on the UK, though does have exposure to the US and Europe. Biggest holdings include Travis Perkins, IWG and Bayer.</p>

<p>What do the experts like? </p>

<p>James Carthew, of Marten &amp; Co, wrote in a note to clients: 'The RWC team says that value stocks have never looked more unloved in the 30-odd years they have been managing money.' In their view, he said, it is 'an attractive entry point for new investors'.</p>

<p>Any downsides?</p>

<p>Value investing is deeply out of favour at the moment, as money has piled into popular tech stocks. </p>

<p>RWC is also planning to cut Temple Bar's valuable dividend, which has been rising for 36 years, to a more 'sustainable' level.</p>
