<p>An insider close to the Logan Lucky star said she's now behaving 'like a teenage girl in love' because Vitolo is 'openly affectionate with her, left his fiancée to be with her and gives her something [her ex-boyfriend] Jamie [Foxx] couldn't,' the source added.</p>

<p>The insider said Holmes had been devastated by her breakup last year with the playboy actor, who never seemed to give up his roving eye and was still too close for comfort with his baby mama.</p>

<p>The acting couple were first linked in 2013 hand-in-hand through Malibu, but they kept their relationship private throughout the years.</p>

<p>The couple finally split after they took their relationship public last year at the Met Gala.</p>

<p>Prior to coupling up with Foxx, Holmes was married to Hollywood icon Tom Cruise.</p>

<p>The couple began their whirlwind courtship in 2005 and were married in seven weeks.</p>

<p>Katie filed for divorce in 2012, which was finalized after only ten days.</p>
