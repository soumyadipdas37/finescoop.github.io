<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The witness who helped relaunch the probe into Madeleine McCann's disappearance has insisted suspect Christian Brueckner is guilty and will 'stay in jail for a long time'.</p>

<p>Helge Busching has broken his 12-year-long silence to stand by his claims to police that the convicted German rapist was behind the infamous abduction in 2007.</p>

<p>The 48-year-old was the first person to go to police with information about Brueckner in 2017, around the tenth anniversary of her going missing.</p>

<p>He says he knows that Brueckner killed the three-year-old, who personally told him several details about events surrounding the disappearance. </p>

<p>The witness who helped relaunch the probe into Madeleine McCann's disappearance has insisted suspect Christian Brueckner is guilty and will 'stay in jail for a long time'</p>

<p>When asked by The Sun  what he thought of Brueckner, he said: 'One word. Guilty.'</p>

<p>Main suspect Brueckner is currently in jail for drugs offences, and is appealing a seven-year sentence for raping a 73-year-old woman.</p>

<p>Busching, now a recycling worker, was tracked down to a village on the Greek island of Corsica, having remained anonymous since he provided evidence to officers three years ago.</p>

<p>In a statement he gave to officials at the time, Bushin claims Brueckner, 43, told him he was involved in abducting Maddie while they were talking at a kite festival in Orgiva, Spain.</p>

<p>He described the main suspect as a 'German male person, whom I know by the name of Christian', adding how he would 'talk in detail of his knowledge' of his connection with Madeleine McCann.</p>

<p>Main suspect Brueckner is currently in jail for drugs offences, and is appealing a seven-year sentence for raping a 73-year-old woman</p>

<p>The then-three-year-old was taken from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, while her parents had dinner in a nearby tapas bar.</p>

<p>Met Police and Portuguese authorities have continued a relentless search for her, but after Brueckner became a suspect in the case, investigating German police claim they have found evidence that Madeleine has been killed.</p>

<p>Her parents Kate and Gerry McCann continue to believe that she is alive.</p>

<p>Busching said he and another friend Manfred Seyferth knew Brueckner from when they all lived in the same Portuguese resort that the McCanns holidayed in. </p>

<p>It is believed Bushing did not have much contact with Brueckner following this, but found himself with his own criminal difficulties.</p>

<p>After first being arrested over a 2011 assault on a beggar in Italy, he was later picked up by police trying to smuggle migrants from Greece to Italy. </p>

<p>While under investigation he was put in touch with Operation Grange - the Met Police's team investigating Madeleine's disappearance - where he gave them details about Brueckner. </p>

<p>According to an internal Greek police report, Busching's information was described as 'given voluntarily and without monetary or other consideration'.</p>

<p>Then three-year-old Maddie McCann was taken from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007, while her parents had dinner in a nearby tapas bar</p>

<p>It is unclear why Busching waited nearly ten years before telling cops of Brueckner's alleged involvement.</p>

<p>However, Busching, along with Seyferth, did help convict Brueckner last December for the rape of a 73-year-old woman just outside of Praia da Luz two years before Maddie's disappearance.</p>

<p>The American victim had told cops her attacker filmed the attack and appeared to get a thrill out of seeing her begging him to stop.</p>

<p>Busching and Seyferth are said to have stolen a video camera in Brueckner's home while he was in jail for theft. They contacted police after seeing the images and told them it was Brueckner.</p>

<p>Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured together) discovered their daughter Madeleine missing in Praia da Luz in May 2007  </p>

<p>He is currently appealing the seven-year sentence he was given.</p>

<p>When asked recently about the investigation, Bushing said: 'I am not allowed to say anything about Brueckner but I hope he stays in jail.' </p>

<p>Mr Fulscher has been in Portugal this week looking for witnesses who he believes will clear him. He told The Sun: 'My client is being investigated on the claims of two very dubious and unbelievable wit- nesses who are convicted criminals themselves and have problems with drink and drugs.'</p>

<p>In 2014, Brueckner assaulted a five-year-old girl in a public park in Braunschweig, northern Germany before taking graphic photographs of her which he saved on a memory card.</p>

<p>During an investigation, police raided his flat, they found a Casio Exilim digital camera with 391 vile images and 68 videos of abuse. On the same camera, detectives found about five photographs of Brueckner abusing the five-year-old girl in the park. </p>

<p>He was first tried at a lower court for sexual abuse, but was acquitted in 2016 and fled to Portugal.</p>

<p>He was extradited back to Germany a year later to stand trial again, where he confessed to abusing the girl and owning the camera. He is currently serving his sentence in Kiel prison near Hamburg.</p>

<p>While in prison, Brueckner was also found guilty of raping a 72-year-old American woman in Praia da Luz in 2005.</p>

<p>His lawyers, who deny he had any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance, are seeking to use a procedural error to overturn his seven-year sentence for the rape.</p>

<p>Brueckner's lawyer Friedrich Fulscher said last week that his client was 'innocent' of any involvement in the disappearance of Madeleine. </p>
