<p>Current Covid-19 lockdown restrictions have also caused problems for distributing drugs, said the Green Drone team. </p>

<p>The team's statement said that the situation: 'requires thinking outside the box and coming up with new ways of getting cannabis to consumers' – which they said is what gave birth to the project in the first place. </p>

<p>The police announced shortly after the incident that it had arrested two suspects in their 30s,who allegedly operated the drone dropping the cannabis.</p>

<p>The distribution of a substance suspected to be dangerous is illegal according to the police in Israel.</p>

<p>The arrested suspects are to be interrogated and then dealt with accordingly.</p>
