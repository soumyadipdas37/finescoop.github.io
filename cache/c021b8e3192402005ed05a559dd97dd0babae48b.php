<p>The radio presenter, 42, took to Instagram to share the exciting news on Sunday saying that she's 'up for the challenge' and wants to make her daughters 'proud'. </p>

<p>She told her fans: 'Guess who won't be holding the coats at the side of the rink anymore! I am so, SO excited to be joining the cast of Dancing On Ice.</p>

<p>Confirmed: Myleene Klass is the first celebrity set to appear on the 2021 series of Dancing On Ice</p>

<p>'My girls have always wanted me to do this but I've always been too scared someone will skate over my fingers! </p>

<p>'Anyway, I want to make them proud and show them I'm up for a challenge when completely out of my comfort zone but most of all, I want a bum like Jlo!'   </p>

<p>Myleene's exciting new challenge comes just one week after she revealed she had gotten engaged to her long-term beau and the father of her one-year-old son Apollo, Simon Motson. </p>

<p>Dancing On Ice will return to ITV in the new year and see twelve celebrities skate live with their professional partners each week.</p>

<p>Happy news: The announcement comes just one week after Myleene revealed she was engaged to her beau Simon Motson</p>

<p>The duos will try to impress both the panel and the viewers who will ultimately decide who is crowned the winner of the show.</p>

<p>Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby once again return to present the show and the expert panel of Torvill and Dean, John Barrowman and Ashley Banjo will all resume their roles as judges.</p>

<p>On joining the show, Myleene said: 'I have a 13 year old daughter and a nine year old daughter who are obsessed with ice skating. </p>

<p>'They both ice skate and I stand there and I hold the coats. That's my role – to tie the shoelaces and hold the coats. Now it's my turn to learn and I can't wait!''</p>

<p>Bring it on! The star said she was 'so excited' to get skating and couldn't wait to make her daughters proud</p>

<p>Amid the exciting revelation a source told the Sun that bosses were 'delighted' to work with Myleene and added that she's thought to have signed a 'huge deal worth over £50,000'. </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Myleene's representative as well as Dancing On Ice for a comment. </p>

<p>Other stars thought to be in the running for a spot on Dancing On Ice include Jason Donovan and Denise Van Outen.</p>

<p>The former Neighbours heartthrob - who competed on Strictly in 2011 - is expected to join the star-studded line-up on the ITV show when it airs in January.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun that Jason had lots of 'star power' but added that his dancing skills may not be as helpful as he thinks once on the ice.</p>

<p>Jason isn't the only West End star who has been linked to the rink, with Denise Van Outen said to have signed a deal worth around £40,000 to appear on the series. </p>

<p>According to the Daily Star, Denise 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the show when it kicks off in January after impressing at an audition last month.</p>

<p>Impressive: The former footballer will be under pressure to do well on the ice as Frankie previously finished as runner-up on Strictly Come Dancing in 2014</p>

<p>The mother-of-one is a natural performer after reaching the final of Strictly Come Dancing in 2012 and playing Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago on Broadway and in the West End. She's currently staring in her Cabaret All Stars show in London.</p>

<p>While other names rumoured to have signed up to the physically intense show include actor Rufus Hound, YouTube rapper Lady Leshurr and Coronation Street actress Faye Brookes.</p>

<p>Reality star Billie Faiers and footballer Wayne Bridge, who is married to The Saturdays singer Frankie, have also been tipped for the next series in recent weeks.</p>

<p>A source suggested that Billie would bring fun energy to the show and would be a well-known name after the success of her reality TV career.</p>

<p>While they suggested that Wayne may have impressed bosses with his TikTok moves during lockdown.  </p>

<p>Billie found fame on TOWIE in 2010 alongside her sister Sam and now appears with her in spin-off Mummy Diaries.  </p>

<p>The former footballer will be under pressure to do well on the ice as Frankie previously finished as runner-up on Strictly Come Dancing in 2014. </p>

<p>The most recent series of Dancing On Ice aired in January and was won by former EastEnders star Joe Swash. </p>
