<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert was chauffeured around during his post-finale press rounds in a luxury van with tinted windows.</p>

<p>And it seems the 31-year-old got used to the VIP treatment, as he mistakenly climbed into a stranger's car in Sydney on Friday night - thinking it was his personal driver.</p>

<p>At the end of a wild night out with his girlfriend, Irena Srbinovska, Locky was seen strolling down Glenmore Road looking for a taxi back to their hotel.</p>

<p>Whoops! The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert (pictured) left a Sydney driver TERRIFIED after he mistook their car for his Uber following a night out with new girlfriend Irena Srbinovska</p>

<p>After spending several minutes waiting for a ride that he'd never actually booked, he dashed towards the first car stopped at the nearest red light.</p>

<p>'Our Uber is here!' Locky could be heard shouting at Irena and their friends, before he opened the vehicle's back door and sat inside.</p>

<p>The startled driver told the 6ft 5in reality star that he wasn't an Uber driver and politely asked him to leave.</p>

<p>Locky, who was rather embarrassed by the mishap, offered his apologies and stepped out of the car.  </p>

<p>Funny: According to a witness, the 31-year-old Bachelor ran towards the first car that stopped at the red light in front of the group on Friday night, thinking it was their Uber</p>

<p>'Locky get out! That's not your Uber. You haven't ordered one,' shouted a friend from the other side of the road.</p>

<p>An onlooker told Daily Mail Australia: 'Irena was busy talking to their friends when it happened. </p>

<p>'When they realised what Locky had done, they couldn't believe it. They thought it was so funny.'  </p>

<p>'Locky get out! That's not your Uber. You haven't ordered one,' shouted a friend. 'Irena was busy talking to Bel Colwell, and his friends couldn't believe it,' the witness added</p>

<p>That was quick! At one point Locky and Irena jokingly stopped to look at wedding dresses</p>

<p>They seemed to be in giddy spirits while walking down the street, happily chatting to paparazzi and jokingly checking out wedding dresses in the window of a bridal store.</p>

<p>After reaching Oxford Street, the couple decided to part ways with their friends and were finally able to book a ride back to their hotel.</p>

<p>The pair were seen jaywalking as they walked over to their car. </p>
