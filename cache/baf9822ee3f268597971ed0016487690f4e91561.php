<p>Cindy began modelling early on after being discovered at 16 years old and signing with Metropolitan Management and Wilhemina Models. </p>

<p>In 2012 she walked exclusively for Calvin Klein and has previously appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia, as well as editorials across a number of different Vogue publications, Harper's Bazaar and ELLE UK.</p>

<p>She first made her Victoria's Secret fashion show debut in 2013 and appeared in every showcase until its cancellation in 2019.</p>

<p>The lingerie giant's parent company, L Brands, confirmed the cancellation in November last year, amid dwindling ratings and ongoing backlash over its lack of diversity.</p>

<p> 'Unfortunately the Victoria's Secret show won't be happening this year,' Shanina Shaik confirmed to Australia's Daily Telegraph in July 2019. </p>

<p>'It's something I'm not used to because every year around this time I'm training like an Angel.'</p>

<p>In an interview with Vogue last year, Cindy spoke about being scouted at 16 and how her parents coped.</p>

<p>Fashion icon Azzedine Alaïa treated her as a protégé, as she said: 'Alaïa was my first job. I arrived at his showroom and was not even able to walk in heels. I learned to walk with him..</p>

<p>'Through it all, I could always feel that I was in the presence of a genius. He offered me a dress for my birthday.'</p>
