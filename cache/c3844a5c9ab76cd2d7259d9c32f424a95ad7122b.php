<p>And on Monday, Pip Edwards didn't disappoint as she showed off her new age 'evening ritual' on Instagram. </p>

<p>The 40-year-old proved she's open minded as she showcased what appeared to be burnt sage, scented candles and a deck of Animal Dreaming Oracle Cards.</p>

<p>New age queen: Burning sage, candles and oracle cards: P.E Nation's Pip Edwards, 40, (pictured) showed off her bizarre new age 'evening ritual' to Instagram on Monday</p>

<p>Oracle cards are similar to Tarot cards, but focus on 'the big picture' rather than the 'ingredients', according to website Biddy Taro.</p>

<p>The Oracle cards focus on animal energies, allowing the user to commune with the energies of nature. </p>

<p>Lighting the herb sage cleans the card deck and is also known to clean air. </p>

<p>A number of candles were also sitting on the table.</p>

<p>There it is: Pip showed off sage, oracle cards and a sign which read: 'She is strong but she is tired' along with an assortment of candles </p>

<p>Also seen on the table was a book which read: 'She is strong, but she is tired.' </p>

<p>Pip didn't offer an explanation of the items, but seemed enthusiastic with the new age elements of her evening ritual. </p>

<p>One part of Pip's life which certainly doesn't need any help is her relationship with former cricketer, Michael Clarke.  </p>

<p>They're smitten! Pip Edwards snuggled up to Michael in his designer closet last week as she continues to spend more time at his mansion</p>

<p>On Thursday evening, Pip posted a picture of the pair snuggling up in his designer closet at his Bondi Beach pad.   </p>

<p>In the picture, former Australian cricket captain Michael, 39, was seen wrapping his arm around the business mogul's neck and tenderly caressing her arm. </p>

<p>Pip was barefoot in the impressive closet, wearing a pair of baggy casual black trousers and a white tank top.    </p>

<p>Going strong: Pip and Michael have been dating for months after meeting and falling for each other following his split from ex-wife, Kyly Clarke</p>

<p>In a rare interview for The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine, Michael reflected on his life, a year after separating from wife of seven years, Kyly Clarke.</p>

<p>While he preferred to keep coy about his new romance with Pip, the retired Australian cricketer did reveal that he's 'so happy right now' and is 'in a great place'.</p>

<p>'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said.</p>

<p>Change of scene: Pip appears to be spending more and more time at Michael's home, as evidenced from her Instagram selfies</p>

<p>Hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip the radio host did say that he couldn't be happier.</p>

<p>'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for,' he said.</p>

<p>The sporting great had separated from Kyly, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12. </p>

<p>Happy: Reports surfaced Michael had begun dating Pip after his separation with Kyly became public knowledge. Pip seemingly confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July, and the pair enjoyed a PDA-filled trip to Noosa, Queensland that same month. Pictured here with friends </p>
