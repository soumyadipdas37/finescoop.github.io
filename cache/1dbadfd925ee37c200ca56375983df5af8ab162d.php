<p>Happy at last: Also in the group photo is Carter's brother Courtney as well as other family members. 'Such a lovely evening at home with family celebrating my beautiful sis <?php echo e('@'); ?>Halle_Hammond’s birthday,' said Paris in her caption</p>

<p>In Hilton's movie, the Simple Life star shares that at age 16 while living in New York City two men took her out of her bedroom in the middle of the night as her parents cried. </p>

<p>She was sent to a boarding school for troubled teens. </p>

<p>Paris ran away from many schools until she was placed in Utah's Provo Canyon School where she remained until she was 18-years old.</p>

<p>She had the same drama: Hilton told Drew Barrymore on Monday she has PTSD after being placed in boarding school for troubled teenagers</p>

<p>Paris' movie: Paris also said abuse at the schools was not supposed to be the original focus of the documentary. 'It actually wasn’t supposed to be the original premise of the film,' said the star</p>

<p>The fragrance mogul said she was beaten, drugged and placed in solitary confinement without a blanket or food. </p>

<p>'All it did was give me trust issues, PTSD. I didn’t deserve to go there,' said the CEO.</p>

<p>'My mom and dad were just very strict and sheltered when I lived in LA,' shared the friend of Kim Kardashian. 'I wasn’t allowed to go on dates, couldn’t wear makeup, couldn’t go to a school dance. They just didn’t want me to grow up. </p>

<p>'Then I moved to New York and that’s when my life changed and I just was sneaking out at night and going to clubs and ditching school but not doing anything terrible, just wanting to go out at night and that really scared my parents because they were so protective.'</p>

<p>All good now: When Drew asks Paris if she is close to her mom Kathy right now, the socialite added: 'We’re closer than ever. It’s something that we just never talked about it so it was very hard for her to hear but I think just talking about it just brought us even closer than we were.' Seen in 2019</p>

<p>Drew then shared she knows Paris' mother Kathy: 'My mom used to come in your driveway, drop me off in the car and then a day or two later she would come back. I have a host of issues with my mom, many of which I let go somewhere around 40.'</p>

<p>When Drew asks Paris if she is close to her mom Kathy right now, the socialite added: 'We’re closer than ever. It’s something that we just never talked about it so it was very hard for her to hear but I think just talking about it just brought us even closer than we were.'</p>

<p>And Drew also asks the question if whether Paris is addicted to the love.</p>

<p>Paris said, 'Yes, I think just from going through what I went through I’ve always just searched for love and attention </p>

<p>The 45-year-old Charlie's Angeles actress shared she had also been placed in such a school.</p>

<p>And the mother-of-two also disclosed that like Paris, she had been placed in solitary confinement during her stay because she was very 'rebellious.' </p>

<p>Her past: Drew said she had been sent to a school for troubled teens </p>

<p>Drew began by telling Paris she had seen her documentary and felt like she was watching a 'mirror image of everything I’ve been through.'</p>

<p>The 50 First Dates star then said, 'I’ve had the people come and take me away. I’ve been locked up in solitary confinement.'</p>

<p>Barrymore added, 'I’ve been in a place for lengthy periods of time we are talking year, year and a half plus.'  </p>

<p>The former wild child added, 'I haven’t seen a kind of story like this really reflected out there very often that’s one I recognize so deeply.'</p>

<p>Tough time as a teen: 'I’ve had the people come and take me away. I’ve been locked up in solitary confinement. I’ve been in a place for lengthy periods of time we are talking year, year and a half plus,' she shared</p>

<p>Young: Drew does not said when she was sent away, but there was a gap in her career from 1989 when she was in Far From Home and 1991 when she starred in Motorama. At the time she was 15-years-old. Seen in 1988</p>

<p>Drew then said that she had a better experience with her boarding school than Paris did.</p>

<p>'The people at my place were really good,' said the Santa Clarita Diet star.</p>

<p>'I mean I didn’t like being thrown in solitary confinement. I will say I was very rebellious. I started riots there all the time. There was a lot of other kids like me.'</p>

<p>And she said she was sent away because her mother Jaid Barrymore, now 74, was not sure how to control her child.</p>

<p>Not all bad: Drew then said that she had a better experience with her boarding school than Paris did. 'The people at my place were really good,' said the Santa Clarita Diet star</p>

<p>'My mom just didn’t know what to do with me,' admitted Drew whose difficult childhood was explored in her 1990 tell-all Little Girl Lost.</p>

<p>'I was doing drugs. I was out of control. She just threw her hands up and threw me in there not knowing where else to turn to,' added the host.</p>

<p>'That place really did help me and it did save my life and I actually wouldn’t change a thing.'</p>

<p>Not an easy road to navigate: Drew and her mother Jaid seen in 1982 in New York City</p>

<p>So many drugs: 'I was doing drugs. I was out of control. She just threw her hands up and threw me in there not knowing where else to turn to,' added the host of her mom</p>

<p>Drew does not said when she was sent away, but there was a gap in her career from 1989 when she was in Far From Home and 1991 when she starred in Motorama. At the time she was 15-years-old.  </p>

<p>Paris also said abuse at the schools was not supposed to be the original focus of the documentary.</p>

<p>'It actually wasn’t supposed to be the original premise of the film,' said the star.</p>

<p>Better for Drew: 'That place really did help me and it did save my life and I actually wouldn’t change a thing,' the Wedding Singer actress added</p>

<p>'I wanted to do a film to show the business woman I am and all I’ve accomplished because I feel like there are so many misconceptions about me and then during shooting I just became to close with the director that we had this like sisterly relationship where I felt I could open about anything with her. </p>

<p>'She told me, "This is so important that you tell your story because you are going to help other survivors and people want to come forward with theirs." It was very difficult for me because it wasn’t something I ever wanted to talk about in public.'</p>

<p>And she said that she did not gain anything positive from boarding school. </p>
