<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England’s women moved into a 2-0 lead in their five-match T20 series against West Indies following crucial all-round interventions from Sarah Glenn in her hometown of Derby.</p>

<p>First Glenn top-scored from No 8 with a 19-ball 26 as England recovered from a perilous 96 for six to reach an imposing 151 for eight after being put in to bat. Then her leg-breaks removed the dangerous duo of Deandra Dottin and captain Stafanie Taylor after the tourists had reached 72 for one in the 12th over.</p>

<p>They declined hopelessly to finish on 104 for eight as England replicated Monday’s 47-run victory. Against opponents devoid of depth or confidence, Heather Knight’s team ought to secure the series on Saturday.</p>

<p>Sarah Glenn's all-round performance helped England to a 47-run victory over West Indies</p>

<p>England have now moved into a 2-0 lead over their opponents in their five-match T20 series</p>

<p>A former junior hockey international, the 21-year-old Glenn has also played full-back for Belper Town FC, and switched in her teens from seam to leg-spin after watching videos of Shane Warne and discovering that she bowled with a natural flick of the wrist.</p>

<p>At one point, she had figures of none for 20, but then looped a leg-break into the pads of Dottin to remove her lbw for 38, and had Taylor – who had become the second woman to pass 3,000 runs in T20 internationals – stumped for 28. Glenn finished with two for 24.</p>

<p>Glenn was named player of the match after top scoring from No 8 then taking two wickets</p>

<p>‘It was a good test for us today,’ she said after being named player of the match. </p>

<p>‘If you lose a few wickets early on, you can easily just push singles, so it was good to throw the first punch at the end of our innings and show some courage. </p>

<p>'I’m starting to bowl my variations in game situations too.’</p>

<p>Despite that, it was a scrappy English performance in the field. Much of their batting needed polish too after a brisk 21 from opener Tammy Beaumont and 25 off 20 balls from wicketkeeper Amy Jones. Not until Glenn and Katherine Brunt put on 46 for the seventh wicket did England breathe more freely.</p>
