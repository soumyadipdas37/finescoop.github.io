<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eliud Kipchoge is adamant Nike's game-changing marathon shoe is not a breach of the spirit of sport ahead of Sunday's London Marathon.</p>

<p>The Kenyan confirmed on Wednesday he will be competing in the same Alphafly Next% shoe that he wore in becoming the first athlete to break two hours in Vienna last October. </p>

<p>While the shoes are expected to be deemed compliant with World Athletics rules around sole thickness and carbon plates, there is a question of the ethics of trainers that improve running economy by an estimated five to eight per cent.</p>

<p>Eliud Kipchoge is adamant Nike's marathon shoe is not a breach of the spirit of sport</p>

<p>But Kipchoge said: 'We live in the 21st century, whereby firstly we need to accept change and secondly development goes hand in hand with technology. </p>

<p>'The shoe is good and they accepted the technology patent.' </p>

<p>With Kipchoge serving as a talking billboard, his main rival on Sunday, Kenenisa Bekele, went off message by saying he will wear the older Nike Vaporfly because the newer shoe has caused him some 'minor injuries'.</p>
