<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A retired police officer in Texas has called deputies' behavior unprofessional after they broke down the door to his home on a warrant for someone who did not live there.</p>

<p>Louis Rodriguez and his son began filming at their home in Houston on September 1 when Harris County deputies demanded entry and said they had a warrant for the arrest of Curtis Rogers.</p>

<p>'The officers are looking for a Curtis Rogers in this house and there is no Curtis Rogers that lives in this house,' said Louis Rodriguez's son in the video.</p>

<p>Rodriguez said that at first he was wasn't certain whether the people outside were real police officers, and refused to open the door and asked to see a warrant, according to KTRK-TV.</p>

<p>Louis Rodriguez and his son began filming at their home in Houston on September 1 when Harris County deputies broke down his door looking for someone who doesn't live there</p>

<p>Soon after they began filming, the deputies broke down the door with a battering ram. </p>

<p>'They went that quickly to bust my front door down and come to my home,' said Rodriguez, a retired police officer. </p>

<p>'Out of control yelling, demanding, threatening they wanted to come in. I wasn't sure they were police officers at the time,' he said. </p>

<p>Rodriguez told the deputies he was a retired officer and asked to see their warrant, but instead they detained him and his son and took them outside.</p>

<p>'(They) manhandled myself and my son and brought us outside. (Then) they finally realized the mistake they made,' he said.</p>

<p>Soon after they began filming, the deputies broke down the door with a battering ram</p>

<p>The mistaken raid occurred in this suburban neighborhood of Houston</p>

<p>A captain on the scene apologized when the deputies realized their mistake, but Rodriguez said the apology was not sufficient.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Harris County Sheriff's Department said: 'Deputies attempting to execute an arrest warrant on Sept. 1 mistakenly approached the wrong home in the 21100 block of Royal Villa Drive and damaged the front door.'</p>

<p>'Deputies subsequently realized they made a mistake and the sheriff's office arranged to have the door replaced. The sheriff's office regrets the mistake and the incident is under review,' the statement continued.</p>

<p>Although nobody was injured in the incident, Rodriguez said he is disappointed in what happened and plans to file a complaint with the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>'I'd hate for this to happen to any family in Harris County,' he told the local ABC affiliate.  </p>
