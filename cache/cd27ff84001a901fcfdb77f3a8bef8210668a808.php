<p>Work on building the tower began in 1821, under the direction of Captain Joseph Huddart. Pictured: The beautifully-furnished double bedroom</p>

<p>According to ManorCastles.com, work on building the tower began in 1821, under the direction of Captain Joseph Huddart, the High Sheriff of Caernarfonshire. </p>

<p>His father, who was also a captain and named Joseph, had owned the surrounding estate since 1809 after making a fortune from the invention of a steam-driven industrial rope binder. </p>

<p>After the land passed into his hands, Huddart began to renovate it and the now-ruined manor called Brynkir Hall, the remains of which stand near the tower. </p>

<p>After his death, Huddart junior continued his restoration by building the Gothic tower. </p>

<p>Visitors could sit down and have a read in front of this window, which looks out onto the Welsh landscape (pictured)</p>

<p>The tower and the estate remained with the Huddart family until 1910, when bankruptcy saw it pass into the hands of the Government. Pictured: The bathroom and its mammoth antique sink</p>

<p>Visitors to the tower could hike up Mount Snowdon itself - it is less than 20 miles away - or explore the stunning villages and scenery nearby</p>

<p>It and the surrounding estate remained with the Huddart family until 1910, but bankruptcy then saw the Government take ownership. </p>

<p>The tower and hall did then have a brief stint as a World War One prisoner of war camp, before the latter was largely demolished in the 1920s. </p>

<p>The estate was broken up and sold off in 1930 and the tower remained derelict until the 1990s, when it was renovated. </p>
