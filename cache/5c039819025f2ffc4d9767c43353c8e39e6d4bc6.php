<p>In memory: Kim Kardashian lovingly paid tribute to her beloved father, Robert Kardashian, with two throwback images and a heartfelt note on the 17th anniversary of his death</p>

<p>She continued: 'I really can't believe it's been that long. I miss you so much dad. I could really use a law school study buddy.' </p>

<p>Additionally, she shared a glowing snap at a party with Robert and sisters, Khloé and Kourtney, who appeared to be holding onto a glass of white wine.  </p>

<p>In the image, the famous siblings, who looked respectively around 16 to 21 years old at the time, had their arms wrapped each other and sport beaming smiles.   </p>

<p>Beloved dad: In memory of the famed attorney, who passed away after a battle with esophageal cancer in 2003 at the age 59, the reality star reminisced on his legacy and life</p>

<p>The KKW Beauty mogul has been working to follow in her father's footsteps in recent years, as she continues studying the legal system to become a criminal justice lawyer.  </p>

<p>In March, she spoke of how becoming a mother prompted her to begin a four-year apprenticeship with a law firm in San Francisco in 2018.</p>

<p>Speaking to Grazia, the beauty, who is a little more than a year into a four year law course, said: ‘Becoming a mom has really opened up my heart, and it’s changed me.</p>

<p>'I really can't believe it's been that long. I miss you so much dad. I could really use a law school study buddy,' the mother-of-four wrote on her Instagram Story (Kim seen on her 16th birthday)</p>

<p>‘I don’t know if this journey would have happened for me before I was a mom. I will do what I can to help keep on shouting the stories of these people I’ve met.’</p>

<p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said she was 'prideful' that she could set an example for her children through her work and that a 'big part' of life should be giving back.</p>

<p>She is a mom to North, seven, Saint, four, Chicago, two, and Psalm, one, who she shares with husband Kanye West.  </p>

<p>Just like dad: The KKW Beauty mogul is working hard to follow her father's footsteps, as she continues studying the legal system in the hopes of becoming a criminal justice lawyer</p>

<p>She said: 'Life becomes a little bit less about you than it used to be. So I love showing them that message: that they can really be in a business to help people, and that should be a big part of their lives.’</p>

<p>Though Kim is not attending law school, she is eligible to take the bar exam through an alternative path known as 'reading the law', which allows students to take the test by apprenticing through a practicing lawyer or judge. </p>

<p>In conjunction with her Vogue US cover in May 2019, she took to her social media to share a lengthy post about her new study venture.</p>

<p>Evolving: Speaking to Grazia , the beauty, who is a little more than a year into a four year law course, said: ‘Becoming a mom has really opened up my heart, and it’s changed me</p>

<p>'Last year I registered with the California State Bar to study law. For the next 4 years, a minimum of 18 hours a week is required, I will take written and multiple choice tests monthly,' she began.</p>

<p>'As my first year is almost coming to an end I am preparing for the baby bar, a mini version of the bar, which is required when studying law this way. I’ve seen some comments from people who are saying it’s my privilege or my money that got me here, but that’s not the case.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'One person actually said I should “stay in my lane.” I want people to understand that there is nothing that should limit your pursuit of your dreams, and the accomplishment of new goals. You can create your own lanes, just as I am. The state bar doesn’t care who you are. This option is available to anyone who’s state allows it.'</p>

<p>Gone too soon: Robert, who was an attorney that at one point represented O.J. Simpson, died of esophageal cancer in 2003 just two months after he was diagnosed (seen with his two eldest daughters) </p>

<p>Her father, who was an attorney that at one point represented O.J. Simpson, died of esophageal cancer just two months after he was diagnosed.</p>

<p>He was married to momager Kris Jenner from 1978 until 1991, when they very publicly went through a messy divorce.</p>

<p>While Robert was married to two more women in his lifetime (Jan Ashley from 1998 to 1999, and Ellen Pierson in 2003), he only had children with Kris. </p>
