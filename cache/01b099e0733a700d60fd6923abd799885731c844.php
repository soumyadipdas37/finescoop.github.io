<p>Lionel Messi could miss El Clasico due to quarantine rules if he plays for Argentina next month</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman faced a difficult start to life as Barcelona boss with the Messi transfer saga</p>

<p>He would miss matches against Getafe and Alaves, and crucially the huge fixture against fierce rivals Real Madrid. </p>

<p>FIFA has confirmed that players situated in Europe will be available for CONMEBOL qualifiers, but a number of clubs have raised concerns.</p>

<p>Argentina will be keen for their talisman to be leading the line for their matches, although new Barcelona boss Koeman will be reluctant for him to miss La Liga games as a result.</p>

<p>Messi scored twice on his return to action in a pre-season friendly, despite a dramatic summer</p>

<p>It comes at the end of a difficult summer, in which Messi was on the verge of leaving the club. </p>

<p>The drawn out saga drew the ire of fans, and now club president Josep Bartomeu faces being booted out after 20,687 club members backed a vote of no confidence against him. </p>

<p>It didn't affect Messi's playing ability though, as he returned to action against Girona in a pre-season friendly this week, scoring twice after his dramatic u-turn. </p>
