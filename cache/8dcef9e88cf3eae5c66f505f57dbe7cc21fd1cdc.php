<p>Facebook announced it's already registered 2.5 million new voters in advance of Election Day November 3, with a goal of registering 4 million people total. The campaign is part of the platform's ongoing effort to thwart disenfranchisement and misinformation doing the campaign season</p>

<p>It also started pinning voting information at the top of all three apps, with links to official state voting websites and nonpartisan voting organizations.</p>

<p>The voter hub will remain top-of-feed through September 25.</p>

<p>Today, Facebook announced a national campaign, 'More Questions, More Answers,' would appear on both Instagram and Facebook with the aim of directing people to its Voting Information Centers 'to help ensure their vote is counted in this election.'</p>

<p>• All new political ads on Facebook and Instagram banned a week from November 3 - but existing ones can stay be re-used and be re-targeted </p>

<p>Social media, and Facebook in particular, was criticized for allowing misinformation campaigns to taint the 2016 election.</p>

<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company will remove all political ads a week before the election, though users can deactivate such ads now if they choose.  </p>

<p>'This election is not going to be business as usual,' Zuckerberg wrote. 'We all have a responsibility to protect our democracy.' </p>

<p>Adam Chiara, a communications professor at the University of Hartford said Facebook seemed to be acknowledging the power it holds over the upcoming presidential race. </p>

<p>'Maybe some steps they are taking work and others are mistakes,' Chiara said, 'but I would rather have the platform try to be a positive force than be in denial of the role it plays in our democracy.'</p>

<p>Other social media platforms have also announced intense efforts to prevent election tampering.  </p>

<p>Twitter will remove or label unverified postings claiming electoral victory prematurely, and YouTube is taking down content aimed at manipulation, including 'videos that contain hacked information about a political candidate shared with the intent to interfere in an election,' according to a statement.</p>

<p>YouTube will also remove videos promoting efforts to interfere with the voting process such as telling viewers to create long voting lines.</p>

<p>Last week, Snapchat announced it had registered more than 400,000 new voters, more than half of whom were between the ages of 18 and 24.</p>

<p>More than half of Snapchat users who registered through the app in 2018 voted in the midterm elections, highlighting the power of social media as an election driver. </p>
