<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A government office has failed to enforce social distancing among workers, a health and safety inspection has found.  </p>

<p>Photos showing staff gathered close together around a desk at the Department for Work and Pensions in Leeds were taken by inspectors concerned about the office breaching regulations. </p>

<p>There have been two coronavirus cases among staff, with the Health and Safety Executive finding that management had failed to ensure social distancing was maintained.</p>

<p>Since the ruling, the DWP said it had taken 'urgent action to rectify all issues identified' at the Quarry House office.</p>

<p>The inspection came after a DWP whistleblower, who had previously been working from home, raised concerns about a lack of social distance in the office upon his return. </p>

<p>He, like the majority of the office workers, had been working from home, though a recruitment drive triggered by the rise in Universal Credit claimants amid the outbreak meant that hundreds of staff have still been in the building.   </p>

<p>Upon returning to the office, the whistleblower said he was concerned for his health in the building, which also houses some parts of the NHS.</p>

<p>He told the BBC: 'I hear stories about people congregating, not following outlaid guidance. In an office so big it is difficult to monitor 24/7.'</p>

<p>The HSE then received a report of 'workplace concern' which led to a subsequent office inspecting on August 27. </p>

<p>The report said: 'You are failing to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of your employees/agency staff at work because you have not implemented necessary measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.'</p>

<p>The HSE also said that the DWP risk assessing for the office only being half full was 'ambitious and unrealistic',  leading to a risk of 'congestion'.  </p>

<p>Two emails are thought to have recently been sent to staff saying two people had tested positive, with both sent home from the affected floors and deep cleans carried out. </p>

<p>The HSE also confirmed that following the visit an official letter was sent to the DWP.</p>

<p>In it, the DWP was told a fee would need to be paid because of 'material breaches' of health and safety law.</p>

<p>It was given a deadline of Tuesday September 15 to confirm action had been taken to remedy the issues highlighted in the report.</p>

<p>Upon returning to the office, a whistleblower said he was concerned for his health in the building, which also houses some parts of the NHS</p>

<p>Charles Law, industrial officer with the PCS union, said: 'It's extremely worrying for our members who work for the department, especially if they're expected to stop being at home and come into the workplace.</p>

<p>'It's shocking that the HSE would do such a damning report on a flagship DWP office and we're extremely concerned for the safety of our members.'</p>

<p>In a statement, a DWP spokesperson said: 'We take the health and safety of staff extremely seriously and have implemented Covid-secure measures across our sites to ensure they comply with government guidelines.</p>

<p>'We have taken urgent action to rectify all issues identified by the HSE.'</p>
