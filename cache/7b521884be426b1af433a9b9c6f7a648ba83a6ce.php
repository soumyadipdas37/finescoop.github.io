<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two Irish men have been welcomed back to their home country by their families after they were acquitted of the murder of a homeless Australian pensioner.    </p>

<p>Tradesmen Nathan Kelly, 23, and Christopher McLaughlin, 25, immediately returned to Donegal, in Ireland, after they were found not guilty last Monday of murdering 66-year-old Paul Tavelardis.</p>

<p>The pair had been on a 12-hour drinking bender when they crossed paths with Tavelardis on Grosvenor Street in Surry Hills, Sydney's inner west, on December 29, 2018.  </p>

<p>The court heard Tavelardis had been suffering from leukaemia and living in his car on the street before he attacked both men.</p>

<p>Kelly and McLaughlin claimed they acted in self defence before Tavelardis died from his injuries nine days later.  </p>

<p>A NSW Supreme Court jury found both men not guilty and the pair were released after spending 20 months on remand.</p>

<p>The pair's solicitor Ciaran MacLochlainn told Daily Telegraph Kelly and McLaughlin returned home following the trial where they have kept a low profile.</p>

<p>'A man has died, there is nobody celebrating,' he said. </p>

<p>Kelly marked his return home with a quiet dinner and tea with his family. </p>

<p>A Snapchat photo showed him sitting on the family couch and resting next to a man holding a baby.  </p>

<p>'They are here at home and their families are relieved,' Mr MacLochlainn said.</p>

<p>'The families were very concerned for the family of the poor man that died.' </p>

<p>Mr MacLochlainn said both men's judgement were clouded by alcohol on the night of the incident.  </p>

<p>Over their three-week trial, the jury had heard the two men had been drinking heavily throughout the afternoon and evening.</p>

<p>They had begun drinking ciders at their apartment block before they visited the Summer Hill Hotel.</p>

<p>Both men were kicked out and CCTV footage showed the pair made their way to Summer Hill railway station where they laid down. </p>

<p>They later stumbled around the suburb, got in a car and loudly drove laps of Summer Hill.</p>

<p>On their return to Grosvenor Crescent where they also lived, the two men said they found Mr Tavelardis trying to break into Mr McLaughlin's ute. </p>

<p>Both men's barristers said, after a short conversation, the older man struck out at Mr Kelly with a metal pipe.</p>

<p>A neighbour recalled hearing a loud scream of 'fear' and peering out his window to see Mr Tavelardis run around his car with a large item in his hand towards the tradesmen. </p>

<p>In a later police interview, Mr Kelly lifted his top to show a welt on his back where he said Mr Tavelardis had struck him on the back.</p>

<p>Mr Kelly had been kicked out of the pub before the attack while McLaughlin was described by a witness as 'blind drunk' about 11pm. </p>
