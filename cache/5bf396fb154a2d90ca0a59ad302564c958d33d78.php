<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Crystal Palace ensured Manchester United got their season off to a nightmare start with a deserved 3-1 victory at Old Trafford.</p>

<p> A Wilfried Zaha double added to an early Andros Townsend ensured the Eagles made it two wins out of two in the Premier League this season.</p>

<p>Sportsmail's David Kent gives his verdict on displays from players of both sides at Old Trafford. </p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha was on target twice as Crystal Palace ran out 3-1 winners over Man United </p>

<p>MANCHESTER UNITED - 4-2-3-1 </p>

<p>David De Gea - 7</p>

<p>Three good saves from Ayew kept United in it though moving from his line gifted Palace a killer penalty do-over .</p>

<p>Timothy Fosu-Mensah - 5</p>

<p>Handed shock start, struggled defensively and booked for poor foul on Mitchell but set up a goal.</p>

<p>Victor Lindelof - 3</p>

<p>Had a hand in all three goals - beaten by Schlupp, conceding a pen then being shrugged off by Zaha.</p>

<p>Victor Lindelof had a night to forget after having a hand in all three of Palace's goals</p>

<p>Harry Maguire - 5</p>

<p>Back from his summer troubles but looked off the pace and booked for a clumsy challenge on Zaha.</p>

<p>Luke Shaw - 5</p>

<p>Caught out by Townsend for the early goal, looked susceptible defensively and non-factor going forward.</p>

<p>Paul Pogba - 6</p>

<p>Tried to hold United together, and looked for an equaliser with a couple of long-range shots that at least troubled Guaita.</p>

<p>Scott McTominay - 7</p>

<p>Unlucky with a strike that bounced just wide, grafted hard but was just overwhelmed by having too much to do.</p>

<p>Marcus Rashford - 6</p>

<p>Never stopped trying but too many passes were wayward and too many shots easily blocked.</p>

<p>Bruno Fernandes - 6</p>

<p>An inspiration since January but listless, like all his team mates, here. Well marked by Palace’s midfield.</p>

<p>Dan James - 5</p>

<p>No surprise he was the sacrifice made for Greenwood at half-time. No penetration and sloppy with his crossing.</p>

<p>Daniel James was disappointing in the first half and his substitution came as no surprise</p>

<p>Anthony Martial - 6</p>

<p>Lack of service was glaring but well marked by Palace centre-halves when ball did come his way.</p>

<p>Subs</p>

<p>Mason Greenwood (for James, 46) - 5</p>

<p>Donny van der Beek (for Pogba, 66) - 8</p>

<p>Odio Ighalo (for Fosu-Mensah, 81) - 6</p>

<p>Subs not used: Henderson, Bailly, Fred, Ighalo, Wan-Bissaka, van der Beek.</p>

<p>CRYSTAL PALACE (4-2-3-1)</p>

<p>Vicente Guiaita - 6</p>

<p>Good handling from couple of long shots but fortunate that a first-half mis-kick did not fall for Rashford.</p>

<p>Joel Ward - 6</p>

<p>Showed great discipline especially when Greenwood came on, although had a hand in United’s goal.</p>

<p>Cheikhou Kouyate - 7</p>

<p>At fault for van der Beek’s goal but a rare error on a night when the back four protected Guaita superbly.</p>

<p>Cheikhou Kouyate (L) and Joel Ward (R) were part of a superb defensive display by Palace</p>

<p>Mamadou Sakho - 8</p>

<p>Very dominant display, unfazed by the pace of Martial or the movement of the other United forwards.</p>

<p>Tyrick Mitchell - 7</p>

<p>Showed great discipline in dealing with United’s wide men and relished his battle with Rashford.</p>

<p>James McArthur - 7</p>

<p>Strong midfield showing made sure Pogba and Bruno were not able to run the show.</p>

<p>James McCarthy - 7</p>

<p>Hard-working display and deserved a slice of luck when VAR ruled he had not tripped Pogba late in the first half.</p>

<p>Andros Townsend - 8</p>

<p>Took his goal well and threatened with a couple of dangerous shots in both halves without testing de Gea again.</p>

<p>Andros Townsend set Palace on their way and was a a threat for the Eagles throughout </p>

<p>Jordan Ayew - 8</p>

<p>Forced de Gea into two saves either side of the break and his pacy run later won the pen which he missed.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Schlupp - 7</p>

<p>Movement and pace was problematic for a poor United defence and his play and cross for the goal brilliant.</p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha - 9</p>

<p>Led the line well and exploded in the second half with two killer goals, one a great solo effort.</p>

<p>Zaha ensured the victory with a powerful strike after a surge forward past Lindelof </p>

<p>Subs</p>

<p>Eberechi Eze (for Schlupp, 74) - 6</p>

<p>Michy Batshuayi (for Ayew, 81) - 6</p>

<p>Luka Milivojevic (for McCarthy 87)</p>

<p>Subs not used: Hennessey, Meyer, Kelly, Inniss.</p>

<p>Referee: Martin Atkinson - 7</p>
