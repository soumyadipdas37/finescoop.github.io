<p>Cutie pie: Kourtney Kardashian cuddled up to the adorable puppy named Ruby, while chronicling it on her Instagram stories, on Wednesday</p>

<p>Kourtney sat at a table in a blue tee with the adorable small puppy in her lap looking at the camera. </p>

<p>'Hi Ruby,' she simply captioned the photo, though it's not clear who the little puppy belongs to. </p>

<p>The mother-of-three looked glamorous with a full face of makeup drawing up her cheekbones and a nude color making her pout look more full. </p>

<p>She went on to change her outfit, opting for a leather collard short sleeve top instead. </p>

<p>Kourtney cuddled up to her longtime friend Sarah, who was a high school classmate. </p>

<p>Earlier in the day, she hinted that she looked like an alien as she posed in a strapless cream colored top with matching slacks for a bathroom mirror selfie.</p>

<p>'Greetings earthlings,' was all the mother of three said in her brief caption.</p>

<p>Her inspiration? A look at what most people think an alien looks like; stock photo</p>

<p>Indeed the sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian did slightly resemble an alien emoji as her hair was slicked back and she had on heavy eye makeup that gave her a cat-eye look.</p>

<p>Her expression was also flat with zero human expression.</p>

<p>This comes after a report she has not reunited with ex Scott Disick. </p>

<p>While the KUWTK star and her former partner of nine years, 37, have been spending more time together since he called it quits from Lionel Richie's 21-year-old daughter Sofia last month, sources claim the friendly exes will never reunite.</p>

<p>Not going back: This comes after a report she has not reunited with ex Scott Disick . While the KUWTK star and her former partner of nine years, 37, have been spending more time together since he called it quits from Lionel Richie's 21-year-old daughter Sofia last month, sources claim the friendly exes will never reunite </p>

<p>The insider added that they are maintaining a healthy co-parenting relationship for the sake of their children Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five.</p>

<p>They told TMZ: 'They're are not a couple, even though they've been hanging out more since his breakup with Sofia. </p>

<p>'It's highly unlikely Scott and Kourtney will ever get back together as a couple. They still consider themselves a family and co-parenting their three children is a priority for both. </p>

<p>'The kids had a blast [during their recent trip to Lake Coeur d'Alene in Idaho] and Scott and Kourtney realised it's good for the fam and they want to do more of it.'</p>
