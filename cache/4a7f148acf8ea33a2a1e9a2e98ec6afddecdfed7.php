<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 26-year-old woman and her partner have been charged after they allegedly snuck into New South Wales from Victoria illegally just days before she gave birth.</p>

<p>The woman, who was heavily pregnant, was part of a group of ten Malaysian nationals who were stopped a border checkpoint on the Murray Valley Highway, Euston, on August 17.</p>

<p>The group told police they intended to drive to Coffs Harbour, on the NSW Central Coast, from Victoria to find work as fruit pickers.</p>

<p>They were turned away and told they would need to fly into Sydney and quarantine in a hotel for 14 days at their own expense instead.</p>

<p>Two people, including a new mum, have been charged after they allegedly crossed the border illegally  (pictured, the border checkpoint at Albury)</p>

<p>10 days after the crossing attempt, police in Coffs Harbour were alerted that the couple had presented at Coffs Harbour Hospital (pictured)</p>

<p>Victoria: Completely open, but other states are banning residents from going there</p>

<p>NSW: Border with Victoria is closed but others are open without restriction</p>

<p>Queensland: Open to everywhere but Victoria, NSW, and the ACT</p>

<p>Northern Territory: Open to everywhere but Victoria and Sydney, which must do hotel quarantine</p>

<p>South Australia: Closed to Victoria, NSW arrivals must self-isolate, rest are open</p>

<p>Tasmania: Closed to Victoria, everywhere else must do hotel quarantine</p>

<p>Western Australia: Closed to everywhere without an exemption </p>

<p>But just ten days later, police were alerted to a couple who allegedly crossed the border unlawfully - with the woman going to Coffs Harbour Hospital to give birth.</p>

<p>She was alleged accompanied by a 28-year-old man who had been with her during the failed border crossing attempt.</p>

<p>The woman was discharged from hospital on Monday and police issued the pair with Court Attendance Notices for not complying with noticed direction in regards to COVID-19.</p>

<p>The pair will appear in Coffs Harbour Local Court on September 14, 2020.</p>

<p>Eight other people were issued with fines in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>One $1,000 fine was issued to a 25-year-old man who broke self-isolation directions after arriving to Sydney from Melbourne.  </p>

<p>Two men, aged 22 and 25, were issued with $1,000 after police were called to a resort in Jindabyne on August 26.</p>

<p>Around 30 people are believed to have been partying inside the staff quarters of the resort.</p>

<p>More fines are expected to be issued in regards to this incident.</p>

<p>Fines were also issued in regards to parties in Lethbridge Park, Jerseyville and King Street Wharf, in Sydney's CBD.</p>

<p>The King Street Wharf incident involved a boat where at least 40 people were on board.</p>

<p>Officers determined the business's COVID Safety Plan was incomplete and the manager was fined $5,000. </p>

<p>The woman had told police she was going to pick fruit in Coffs Harbour, but gave birth in hospital just days later (stock image)</p>

<p>The NSW border with Victoria closed on July 7 at 11.59pm, meaning no one from Victoria can cross into the state without an exemption.</p>

<p>Exemptions include critical service providers such as miners, emergency service workers, anyone requiring medical treatment, children attending school and people who need to meet legal obligations.</p>

<p>NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced an easing of the border permit system with Victoria, as fierce debates rage on about the coronavirus closures.   </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian visited Albury on Tuesday to announce a 50km border buffer zone on either side to allow agricultural workers to cross into NSW more easily.</p>

<p>The permits are expected to be available for residents by Friday, making it easier to travel for work and ease 'angst and frustration' among locals. </p>

<p>But the same can't be said for Queensland, where premier Annastacia Palaszczuk revealed her state's border wouldn't open until at least October - despite the state economy hemorrhaging $17million a day.</p>
