<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump went full 'law and order' at his rally Thursday night in Jacksonville, Florida accusing his rival Democratic Joe Biden of going on an 'anti-police crusade' and calling law enforcement the 'enemy.' </p>

<p>The president's comments come on the heels of another night of violence in the United States, as two police officers in Louisville, Kentucky were shot during demonstrations after a Kentucky grand jury brought no charges against Louisville police for Breonna Taylor’s death. </p>

<p>'Biden's anti-police crusade must stop,' the president demanded. 'I will always stand with the heroes of law enforcement.'  </p>

<p>President Donald Trump blasted Democrat Joe Biden for going on an 'anti-police crusade' during his rally Thursday night in Jacksonville, Florida </p>

<p>Trump described the Democratic ex-vice president as being 'weak as hell.' </p>

<p>'He surrendered his party to flag burners, rioters and anti-police radicals,' the president said. </p>

<p>Trump brought up Wednesday night's chaos in Kentucky - actually complimenting the state's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear for calling up the national guard. </p>

<p>But then accused Biden of backing the unrest. </p>

<p>'Joe, they're not peaceful!' Trump yelled. 'I think he believes it,' the president smirked. </p>

<p>Biden has condemned violence and destruction related to this summer's Black Lives Matter protests getting out of control - but Trump has continued to make the claims anyway. </p>

<p>Biden tweeted Wednesday, 'Even amidst the profound grief &amp; anger today's decision generated, violence is never &amp; can never be the answer.' </p>

<p>'Those who engage in it must be held accountable,' he said. </p>

<p>'Jill &amp; I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift &amp; full recovery,' Biden added.  </p>

<p>But Trump continued to say that he was candidate of law enforcement, while Biden was the candidate of Black Lives Matter - portraying the broader movement as violent and unhinged.   </p>

<p>'He even described law enforcement as the enemy,' Trump said of Biden Thursday night, taking Biden's words warning of the overmilitarization of the police out of context.   </p>

<p>On July 8, the former vice president said, 'Surplus military equipment for law enforcement: they don’t need that. The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood - it’s like the military invading.' </p>

<p>'They don’t know anybody; they become the enemy. They’re supposed to be protecting these people,' Biden said. </p>
