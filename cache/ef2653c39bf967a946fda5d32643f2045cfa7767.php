<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mindset expert and clinical hypnotist Claire Aristides has shared what common dreams really mean and how they could relate to your emotions and everyday life. </p>

<p>Some dreams often involve falling, losing your teeth, being naked in public and dying - all of which can have a deeper meaning.</p>

<p>'Dreaming is a way to connect to the subconscious mind; dreams are natural, healthy and can be metaphorical to what an individual is feeling or experiencing,' Claire, from Sydney, told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>'I would encourage people to not feel frightened of dreams or think that they're negative, but instead see them as a gateway or outlet to your unconscious mind.'</p>

<p>She said metaphors are a 'very good way' to understand or decode what is happening in our dreams, mind and lives.</p>

<p>Claire has also released a free Mindology app to calm and empower the mindset through visualisation and self-hypnosis.</p>

<p>Falling</p>

<p>One common dream thousands of people experience is falling, which Claire says might occur as a result of feeling lost or unsafe.</p>

<p>'Dreams don't always mean the same thing for every person, but falling can be a metaphor for feeling out of control, falling out of touch with someone or falling into the unknown and feeling unsafe,' she said.</p>

<p>'This could also signify leaving something behind or separating from something that you might be drifting away or holding you back.'</p>

<p>Losing your teeth</p>

<p>Similarly to falling, dreaming about losing teeth could signify feeling lost or losing control.</p>

<p>Claire said it's important to draw on what's taking place in everyday life in order to understand a dream.</p>

<p>'Losing your teeth can relate to stress, anxiety and feeling like you're not in control of a situation,' she said.</p>

<p>Being naked in public</p>

<p>Dreaming of being naked in a public place is common and can link to feeling exposed or caught out.</p>

<p>'This often relates to the fear of others pointing out your insecurities, failures and flaws - which is something no-one wants,' Claire said.</p>

<p>'This type of dream can also be tied into an individual's self-esteem levels, guilt or being caught out.'  </p>

<p>Falling - feeling out of control, separating from something, feeling unsafe</p>

<p>Dying - change is occurring, end of a chapter or phase in life, something new is starting, stress</p>

<p>Losing your teeth - stress, anxiety, feeling like you're not in control</p>

<p>Chopping off your hair - change, making a big career decisions, stress, something is changing in your life</p>

<p>Being naked in public - self-esteem issues, fear of flaws and insecurities being exposed to others</p>

<p>Ending a relationship - stress in a relationship, mindset exploring response to a possible situation</p>

<p>Drowning - feeling overwhelmed, not coping, stress</p>

<p>Being chased - feeling frightened, fearing something or someone, escaping</p>

<p>Claire said it's important to draw on what's taking place in everyday life in order to understand a dream </p>

<p>Dying</p>

<p>Dying in a dream can signify change is about to happen, or and ending is taking place.</p>

<p>'Death represents an ending - whether it be the ending of a chapter in their life, separating from a relationship or ending a phase,' Claire said.</p>

<p>And with death, or the end of a chapter, ideally beings a new journey for the person to embark on.</p>

<p>Claire said while dying in a dream may be frightening, it can indicate a positive aspect and change to someone's life too.</p>

<p>Dying in a dream can signify change is about to happen, or and ending is taking place</p>

<p>Ending a relationship</p>

<p>When we dream, the muscles in our body are relaxed but the mind and brain is still very active.</p>

<p>And because dreaming strongly links to how an individual is feeling, this gives the mind an opportunity to play out certain situations.</p>

<p>Claire said if a person dreams of ending their relationship with their partner, this may be because of stress, issues, other factors, or sometimes nothing at all.</p>

<p>'Dreaming gives the individual a chance to react to a situation in their minds, or think about something differently,' she said.</p>

<p>'The power of the imagination takes what a person has experienced over the last few days and uses it when dreaming, but alters or creates situations.' </p>

<p>Claire said if a person dreams of ending their relationship with their partner, this may be because of stress, issues or other factors, or nothing at all</p>

<p>Being chased</p>

<p>When people dream of being chased, this can reflect the fear of change, being frightened or escaping something.</p>

<p>'Children, teenagers and adults can dream of being chased for multiple reasons, and fear itself can evolve into a character that can start to chase you in a dream,' Claire said. </p>

<p>'This can link to fearing something at school, work or change in general.' </p>

<p>While cutting your own hair or shaving your head in a dream isn't as common as others, this might be metaphoric to stress of a particular situation</p>

<p>Cutting your hair </p>

<p>While cutting your own hair or shaving your head in a dream isn't as common as others, this might be metaphoric to stress from a particular situation or change.  </p>

<p>'The hair is a metaphor for something - which will vary from person to person,' Claire said. </p>

<p>'It could be a metaphor for making a career decision, personal change in your life or letting go of something.'</p>
