<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 29-year-old man came out of a gym to find his bike had been stolen and someone had left a photo of the 'thief' in its place.</p>

<p>The owner left his bike locked up on Prebend Gardens road near Stamford Brook station in Chiswick on the afternoon of September 1.</p>

<p>But he came back just after 3pm, around an hour and a half after heading into the gym, to find that his bike had disappeared. </p>

<p>A 29-year-old man came out of a gym to find his bike had been stolen and instead a photo of the 'thief' had been left in its place, with no other information apart from a timestamp (above)</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the 29-year-old saw two pieces of A4 paper where his bike had been locked up, seemingly showing a 'thief' with his bicycle.</p>

<p>The man said: 'I locked the bike up, went to the gym, just finished training and when I came out the bike was gone. But in its place I found two A4 sheets of paper with the image with a timestamp on it duct-taped to where I'd left the bike.'</p>

<p>The printed photograph of the man had 'STOLEN' written across it and someone had also timestamped the image '14:45' - only around 15 to 30 minutes before the man had returned for his bike.</p>

<p>The bike owner said he filed a report to the police that evening and was emailed on September 5, saying that a police officer would be in touch. </p>

<p>The man had left his bike on Prebend Gardens road (above) near Stamford Brook station in Chiswick on the afternoon of September 1 but came back just after 3pm to find it was gone</p>

<p>He said: 'Part of me wishes they had told them to stop stealing my bike rather than just taking a picture, but understandably could be someone, like an old woman or someone who did not really want to get involved. </p>

<p>'So they did the only thing they could do which was take a picture and give me all the details they had.'</p>

<p>He said that he tried to see if anyone from the nearby properties could come out to talk to him about the picture 'but they didn't'. </p>

<p>He added that he would have liked to at least say 'thank you' to the individual for doing what they could to assist him.</p>

<p>MailOnline have contacted the Metropolitan Police for comment. </p>
