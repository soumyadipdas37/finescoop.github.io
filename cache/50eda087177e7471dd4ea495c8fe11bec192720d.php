<p>Hidden reason: Tinsley Mortimer revealed the hidden reason Dorinda Medley 'hates' her Thursday on the first part of The Real Housewives Of New York City's season 12 reunion</p>

<p>'You called John screaming,' Tinsley said. 'The producers wanted me to not stay in the house that night because you were going so crazy. They were actually worried about my safety. You turned on me the moment that John got that money.'</p>

<p>Dorinda's anger over the matter led her to lash out at Tinsley over the years, it was claimed.</p>

<p>'The betrayal that you felt towards John manifested in anger towards me,' Tinsley told Dorinda.</p>

<p>Dorinda denied it all, saying she'd never heard about the gift or gotten involved in John's finances, but she was shown in a flashback giving him a hard time about Scott.</p>

<p>Money matter: According to 45-year-old blond socialite, Dorinda, 55, could not get over the fact that her ex, dry cleaner John Mahdessian, also 55, received money from Tinsley's fiancé, Scott Kluth, 41</p>

<p>Video proof: Dorinda denied it all, saying she'd never heard about the gift or gotten involved in John's finances, but she was shown in a flashback giving him a hard time about Scott</p>

<p>'I have done nothing for you to hate me the way that you do,' Tinsley continued. 'Your jealousy, your hatred, your obsession with my relationship… hey girl, I'm engaged, we're getting married, so you can just move on.'</p>

<p>'With no financial security,' Dorinda said. 'Tinsley, I hate your life.'</p>

<p>Tinsley was asked by show host Andy Cohen, 52, what, if anything, had prevented her from finding her 'fairytale' with Scott sooner.</p>

<p>Life hater: 'With no financial security,' Dorinda said. 'Tinsley, I hate your life'</p>

<p>'Being in New York and Chicago, even though they are fairly close, was a big issue,' Tinsley noted, adding that she'd dated a man from Chicago in an attempt to make Scott jealous.</p>

<p>'Scott never made me choose between him and the show,' Tinsley went on. 'I knew that the show was definitely an issue for him and I knew that when we got back together, it was a decision we had to make. I chose him over being here with everybody. I didn't want to put him in the mix of all this because it could be toxic, and it could be bad for my relationship.'</p>

<p>Being quarantined during the coronavirus epidemic been 'amazing' for the two of them, she added. 'I was the housewife I always wanted to be. I was cooking and cleaning, and making the house. I was finally able to show him that I was this person, too. I think he never saw me in a normal situation of being at home and being together.'</p>

<p>Long distance: 'Being in New York and Chicago, even though they are fairly close, was a big issue,' Tinsley noted, adding that she'd dated a man from Chicago in an attempt to make Scott jealous</p>

<p>Tinsley said she'd never gotten a great deal of support from the cast about her relationship with Scott, and explained that she'd been secretive about their renewed fling because she was 'embarrassed' that she'd cried over him 'so many times.'</p>

<p>On the day Tinsley announced she was leaving the show, Dorinda suggested that Tinsley take a turkey baster and try to get pregnant.</p>

<p>Tinsley was still upset about it, and considered it an insult to women doing IVF.</p>

<p>Baster remark: On the day Tinsley announced she was leaving the show, Dorinda suggested that Tinsley take a turkey baster and try to get pregnant</p>

<p>'I am shamed for not having a child,' she said. 'I am shamed for wanting one.'</p>

<p>'I'm surprised you're not pregnant already,' Dorinda observed. 'You've been talking about getting pregnant non-stop.'</p>

<p>She then apologized for having made the comment, though no one believed her.</p>

<p>Said sorry: Dorinda then apologized for having made the comment, though no one believed her</p>

<p>Asked what her real issue with Tinsley was, she said, 'I believe half of what I hear in life and all of what I see. You guys saw just what was on the show. There was a lot of stuff, Tinsley, that went on.'</p>

<p>On social media, Leah had proclaimed herself 'disgusted' with Ramona's Florida sojourn, and addressed it during the reunion, telling her it showed 'a total lack of awareness.'</p>

<p>'In New York City, people are dying and they can't even say 'bye' to their families, and on Instagram, you're posting, 'Here I am with my workout, and I just upgraded to a new modern suite,' she told Ramona.</p>

<p>'I don't even care if you don't wear a mask,' she continued. 'It was more about the total lack of empathy of how many people are suffering in this country and the world.'</p>

<p>'It's not about wearing a mask, you f***ing idiot!' Leah yelled. 'It's about showing yourself dancing, like you're not being respectful during a pandemic.'</p>

<p>'Stop! Shut up!' Andy called out.</p>

<p>He turned his attention to Leah, noting that she'd gained many fans during the season.</p>

Throwing tiki torches, naked diving into a pool and basically trashing Ramona's house. I'm not sure I've laughed at anything this year harder than I've laughed at that episode.'</p>

<p>Leah had started drinking just before making her first appearance on the show, but had since quit again and gotten a new apartment.</p>

<p>Her parents and daughter Kier, 12, all watched RHONY, she added, noting that her dad had 'big freakin' crush on Sonja.'</p>

<p>When a viewer asked about the abundance of drinking that occurred on the show, Andy addressed Dorinda, wondering if she'd any inclination to stop.</p>

<p>'When the season ends, I think we all stop,' she said. 'I'm not like Ramona, I'm not out every night. Ramona is out every single night drinking.'</p>

<p>Drinking question: When a viewer asked about the abundance of drinking that occurred on the show, Andy addressed Dorinda, wondering if she'd any inclination to stop</p>

<p>Leah asked if Ramona had called her a whore, and Dorinda corrected it to 'tramp.'</p>

<p>'Oh my God, Dorinda,' Ramona moaned. 'Go to church.'</p>

<p>Church time: 'Oh my God, Dorinda,' Ramona moaned. 'Go to church'</p>

<p>She added that she'd been concerned about Sonja's drinking lately, as it was starting earlier.</p>

<p>Sonja insisted that for several seasons she'd been taking diuretics that slowed her motor skills and conversational abilities, but that seeing herself slur this year made her stop.</p>
