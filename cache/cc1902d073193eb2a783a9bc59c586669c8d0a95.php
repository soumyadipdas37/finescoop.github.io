<p>'And at least get the conversations started about how to combat the effects that the coronavirus is having on our lives,' he continued. </p>

<p>Like many Melburnians, Orpheus has had to find different ways to entertain himself while in isolation during the city's stage-four lockdown. </p>

<p>In July, he told Daily Mail Australia that he has been keeping himself distracted by making music. </p>

<p>'There will be singing involved, but I've been mainly producing music,' he told Daily Mail Australia. </p>
