<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Word spread quickly among Tottenham players on Sunday night about the manager branding them 'lazy'.</p>

<p>Some saw it as a tactic to trigger a reaction following a lacklustre display against Everton.</p>

<p>Others were not so understanding.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho was furious with his Tottenham players on Sunday as he brandished them 'lazy' </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho still has the support of the majority of his squad, but his record of falling out with his players suggests this might not be a one-off.</p>

<p>Asked directly about Mourinho's comments, left back Ben Davies did not appear to agree with his manager.</p>

<p>He said: 'I think everybody worked hard. Me, personally, I gave it my all. The performance wasn't up to scratch. It's hard to put it down to a lack of effort.'</p>

<p>It's important to stress Mourinho employed the term 'lazy pressure' when complaining about his side's performance in the 1-0 defeat by Everton.</p>

<p>Ben Davies did not appear to agree with his manager after Sunday's defeat against Everton</p>

<p>He may argue he wasn't directly accusing his players of being lazy, rather identifying a tactical flaw. But he knows the consequences of language used in post-match interviews.</p>

<p>The club's significantly disrupted pre-season is a valid excuse for their lethargic start. At least two Tottenham players tested positive for Covid-19 during pre-season.</p>

<p>Mourinho confirmed on Sunday that a number of his squad missed parts of pre-season because they were in quarantine - star striker Harry Kane among those who were required to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Kane's lack of match fitness was clear during England's games against Iceland and Denmark, as it was against Everton.</p>

<p>Mourinho has support from most of his squad but has a track record of falling out with players</p>

<p>Without a genuine back-up option, Mourinho has no option but to continue deploying his talismanic forward. </p>

<p>The problem is persuading strikers to sign when they know they will be mostly on the bench.</p>

<p>The willingness to strengthen - within reason - from the Spurs board is there, albeit on a restricted level due to the financial consequences of Covid-19.</p>

<p>There remains concern about Mourinho's seeming reluctance to utilise young players.</p>

<p>But there remains concern about Mourinho's seeming reluctance to utilise young players</p>

<p>Record signing Tanguy Ndombele, 23, and Ryan Sessegnon, 20, have struggled for game time. Loaning out Oliver Skipp and Troy Parrott has reinforced the unease.</p>

<p>As ever with Mourinho, there is negativity from sections of the fan base with regards to the team's playing style.</p>

<p>But Mourinho will take substance over style, and victory against Lokomotiv Plovdiv in the Europa League on Thursday and another versus Southampton on Sunday should settle any early anxieties.</p>
