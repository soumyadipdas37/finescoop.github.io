<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The identity of a frail, elderly woman found by the side of the road on Queensland's Sunshine Coast remains a mystery and police are urging any relatives to contact them.</p>

<p>The woman, believed to be in her 80s or 90s, was picked up by a driver on Brandenburg Road in Mooloolah Valley on September 8 and dropped outside Nambour Hospital.</p>

<p>Police Inspector Matt Robertson says the woman was in a vulnerable situation and 'very frail', requiring medical treatment.</p>

<p>The identity of a frail, elderly woman (pictured) found by the side of the road on Queensland's Sunshine Coast remains a mystery</p>

<p>CCTV showed the man who took the woman to the hospital after finding her on the road</p>

<p>The man who found the woman took her to hospital and told staff he didn't know her and had no reason to think he was doing anything except helping her.  </p>

<p>'He came in, he stated exactly what occurred and at this stage the evidence suggests what he said occurred,' Inspector Robertson said, according to the ABC.</p>

<p>'He does believe he might have seen her in the area before.'  </p>

<p>They do think there may be a story to tell however and the missing piece was a 'puzzle'. </p>

<p>Pictured: The woman when she was first found and taken to hospital to be cared for. She couldn't verbally communicate at the time</p>

<p>However, he says police are not investigating any criminality or elderly abuse and just want to find her family.</p>

<p>Police have released an image of her ring in the hopes it might help someone identity her. </p>

<p>'Our primary investigation is just to locate who this lady is to reunite her with her family,' Inspector Robertson.</p>

<p>Police have been unable to ask the woman who she is because she has been suffering a 'challenging health situation', although she is improving after being transferred to Sunshine Coast University Hospital.</p>

<p>Inspector Robertson said she was now able to communicate verbally and have conversations with people.</p>

<p>Police have released an image of her ring in the hopes it might help someone identity her</p>

<p>'It's not something where we've been able to go charging in very quickly with and we're taking it one step at a time and exploring those avenues as she's capable,' he said.</p>

<p>Officers have put out a call for public assistance after trying many lines of inquiry, hoping it will help solve the mystery.</p>

<p>Police are unable to DNA test people without their permission, so they're hoping someone can identify the woman.</p>

<p>'That's going to be our quickest line of inquiry without bureaucracy, sending off inquiries that could take days to get back,' Inspector Robertson said.</p>

<p>'It only takes one person, who knows a person, to make one phone call and we can identify the lady.'</p>

<p>He said the woman's situation was unique, agreeing that it was almost like a reverse missing person's case.</p>

<p>'We have the located person, we're just trying to find the family,' he said.</p>
