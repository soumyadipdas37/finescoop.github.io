<p>Reflecting on the forward's success, Heynckes told DFL Magazine that Muller is the 'most extraordinary player in German football history.' </p>

<p>He said: 'For me, with his overall package, character and playing style, he is the most extraordinary player in German football history together with the great Gerd Müller,' Heynckes stated.</p>

<p>'He is once again showing what has always distinguished him: being a team player, hard-working and hard-running. In addition to that, he's a driving force on the pitch, which is more clear now than ever.' </p>

<p>Muller has featured 525 times for the Bundesliga giants and won most trophies with the club</p>

<p>Heynckes praised the 25-year-old for his attitude to the club and his development as a person. </p>

<p>He said: 'He is the epitome of a professional footballer who also stands for what FC Bayern is all about. He lives for football, football is his hobby, his job, his elixir of life. At the same time, he has developed as a person.' </p>

<p>Before finishing off by honouring Hansi Flick, who has transformed Bayern from a superpower in rapid decline to the most formidable force in Europe.  </p>

<p>He said Flick has succeeded with 'team and people management, empathy, credibility and communication.</p>

<p>'He doesn't take himself too seriously, even though he's the main sporting person. He's not the boss because of his position, but because of his personality.'</p>
