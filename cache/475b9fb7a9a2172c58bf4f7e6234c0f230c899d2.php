<p>Garvey will leave at the end of the year and will host her own interview series on BBC Radio 4 in 2021.</p>

<p>She has presented Woman's Hour for 13 years.</p>

<p>The broadcaster said: 'It's been a real privilege to play a small part in the history of this very special radio programme.</p>

<p>'On one unforgettable day, I interviewed David Cameron in the morning, and Mary J Blige in the afternoon. There's no other job like it.</p>

<p>Jane Garvey has announced she is quitting Woman's Hour after 13 years at the helm</p>

<p>'But famous people are not the reason people engage with Woman's Hour. It's because the programme still talks about the subjects and challenges no-one else goes near.</p>

<p>'I'm very proud of our relationship with the audience and the trust they place in us.'</p>

<p>Mohit Bakaya, controller of Radio 4, said: 'When it comes to the art of radio presenting there are few that can match the brilliance of Jane Garvey.</p>

<p>'And whilst I understand that she feels it is time to move on after a terrific 13 years presenting Woman's Hour, I am thrilled that she will stay on the network.'</p>

<p>Garvey will be 'presenting her own interview series, as well as becoming a regular late-night fixture, along with Fi Glover', with their Fortunately podcast arriving on the Radio 4 schedule.</p>

<p>Dame Jenni announced at the end of July that she was leaving the Radio 4 show after more than three decades. Her last programme will be on October 1.</p>

<p>The 70-year-old is the longest-serving presenter in the show's 74-year history.</p>

<p>The BBC said new presenters will be announced in due course.</p>

<p>It has decided to fill the vacancies with two new presenters.</p>

<p>Garvey is believed to have decided to leave before Dame Jenni announced her departure.</p>

<p>The broadcaster, the first voice on Radio 5 Live when it was launched in 1994, revealed the news to her listeners on Friday morning, saying: 'Is there anything worse than a personal statement from a radio presenter? No, not really, but I'm afraid you are about to hear one.</p>

<p>'I have loved presenting Woman's Hour, it has been a tremendous privilege, but I have decided to leave the programme at the end of the year.</p>

<p>'I'm not leaving Radio 4. I'm going to be doing a new interview programme, starting in April of next year and, if you are a listener to the Fortunately podcast with me and Fi Glover, somehow or other that is being allowed to stagger on to the Radio 4 late-night schedule, so that will be coming to Radio 4 in the new year as well.'</p>

<p>She added: 'No time to get maudlin ... we can do that in late December.'</p>

<p>Garvey, who irked some listeners earlier this year and was accused of being 'snobby' when she called Arctic Rolls a 'low-level pudding', quipped on Twitter that 'No, it wasn't the bloody Arctic Roll thing that did for me in the end.</p>

<p>'Thanks for all the comments. Especially the one that said I was way too opinionated, and a man should take over BBC Woman's Hour immediately.'</p>
