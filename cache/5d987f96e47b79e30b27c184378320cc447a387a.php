<p>'And I never imagined our first date night would be a surprise night in Ikea. But I have to admit I thoroughly enjoyed myself... I do love you bubs to the moon and stars and back again. </p>

<p>'You get me. Even though you instantly regretted your decision when you saw the Fejka section. I made myself a nice bouquet. Grabbed a basket I definitely don't need and a giant pack of Daims. And now we are off to get some dinner...</p>

<p>'I'm guessing it'll be a McDonald's the way this nights going. Thank you bub. Happy Friday everyone... I hope you're all ok! Love you lots, always.'</p>
