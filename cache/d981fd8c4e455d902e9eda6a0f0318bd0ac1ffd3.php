<p>'I was incredibly excited, happy and very very nervous', the support worker said of his time in the famous Tent.

<p>Commenting on how well the competitors have got on, Loriea - who 'struggles to think simplistically' when it comes to her cooking - explained: 'What stands out the most is the close bond we had made already, as well as how supportive we all were to each other, despite coming from various backgrounds.

<p>The popular show had been scheduled to go into production back in April, before the pandemic, and subsequent lockdown, scuppered all plans.</p>

<p>Wide range: (L-R) At 61, retirement living team leader Linda from East Sussex is this year's oldest contestant, while the youngest in the group is accounting and finance student Peter, 20, from Edinburgh</p>

<p>Despite being considered a high-risk candidate for coronavirus at 80, Prue decided to make a comeback to the much-loved series.  </p>

<p>TV sources previously claimed producers banned older contestants who are considered vulnerable to the virus. An insider told The Sun: 'There's a real sense of urgency to get the next series of Bake Off in the can, considering it's one of Channel 4's biggest draws.</p>

<p>'That means the nation's baking grans and grandads have been deemed too high risk. Bake Off's wizened contestants are often the heart of the show.</p>

<p>'Val, who would 'listen' to cakes to work out if they were done, and rapping septuagenarian Flo became favourites.'</p>

<p>Kelly Webb-Lamb, deputy director of programmes and head of popular factual for Channel 4, recently admitted it was an 'enormous' feat getting the show back on air.</p>

<p>Media personality Paul, 54, reportedly wants to continue using his trademark handshake in the upcoming season, despite fears of spreading the virus.   </p>

<p>The food expert's handshake is widely regarded as the golden ticket for bakers who aim to meet his high expectations or win Star Baker of the week. </p>

<p>The first time fans witnessed his congratulatory move was in series three of the former BBC show. The program was relaunched on Channel 4 in 2017 and saw him dish out another seven handshakes in just one run.   </p>

<p>Channel 4 has clarified they will follow strict safety protocol so that all parties are free to handshake to their heart's content. </p>

<p>The new series of The Great British Bake Off will begin on Channel 4 on September 22 at 8pm. </p>
