<p>A mother-of-two lied about her daughter having terminal cancer to everyone she knew - including her husband, a court has heard.</p>

<p>Renee Jocelyn O'Brien pleaded guilty to 11 counts of fraud at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Tuesday after raising more than $10,000 on GoFundMe and from other donations.</p>

<p>She told friends and family that her daughter's condition was fatal and she would die in 18 months. </p>

<p>The court heard how O'Brien took her five-year-old daughter to the hospital after she complained of headaches.</p>

<p>Doctors found a small cyst near the girl's skull but instead of telling her family the truth, O'Brien told her mother and husband that the child had brain cancer.</p>

<p>Her husband, who had no idea his wife was lying, quit his job to spend more time with the family and the pair even discussed funeral options with a friend.</p>

<p>A GoFundMe page for the family raised thousands of dollars in donations and a kindly couple, who did not have children, helped to create and tick off experiences on a 'bucket list' for O'Brien's daughter.</p>

<p>Nick Hanly, O'Brien's legal aid lawyer, said his client made a 'giant leap' when she was told about the cyst, the Courier-Mail reported. </p>

<p>'She has started a lie and it has snowballed,' he said.</p>

<p>'It has engrossed her life and she has continued the story.'</p>

<p>He added that his client was of 'below average intellect' and was highly stressed at the time of her offending.  </p>

<p>Social media posts led to the family getting media exposure, and they were gifted incredible experiences such as whale watching and motorcycle rides. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two told friends and family that her daughter's condition was fatal and she would die in 18 months </p>

<p>However, a government agency became concerned and contacted police.</p>

<p>O'Brien admitted to her child never having cancer after police came to her home with a search warrant. </p>

<p>An anonymous friend told Daily Mail Australia they discovered O'Brien was lying from other mutual friends.</p>

<p>'Her constant lying and the way she treated their kids made us think about our friendship,' the friend said.</p>

<p>'I feel sorry for the kids, they will need lots of counselling.'</p>

<p>O'Brien was sentenced to a nine-month prison term suspended for two years.</p>
