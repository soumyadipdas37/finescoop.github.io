<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The woman who was sexually assaulted at Stanford University in a high profile 2015 case has said she revealed her identity because she didn't want to spend the rest of her life 'shrinking'.</p>

<p>For years, Chanel Miller, 28, from California, was known in legal proceedings as 'Emily Doe,' but revealed her identity earlier this month. She is preparing to release a memoir, Know My Name, in which she details the attack, the court case and her recovery.</p>

<p>Chanel was 22 when she was sexually assaulted while unconscious by Brock Turner in January 2015 outside a fraternity house on Stanford's California campus. Turner was found guilty of sexually assaulting Miller in March 2016, but was only given a six month prison sentence in 2016 and spent just three months behind bars.   </p>

<p>Appearing on Lorraine today, she explained that while privacy is a 'huge luxury', revealing her identity helped her 'acknowledge the pain' she went through and admitted she didn't want the 'fear of attack or blame' hold her back from this. </p>

<p>For years, Chanel Miller, 28, (pictured this year) from California, was known in legal proceedings as 'Emily Doe,' but revealed her identity earlier this month</p>

<p>'I decided I didn't want to spend the rest of my life shrinking and spending all of my energy concealing who I was, she said. </p>

<p>'I understand privacy is a huge luxury I had over the course of four years, but I also realised that not being able to acknowledge the pain I went through stopped me acknowledging growth I had as a result of that pain.</p>

<p>'I felt everyone in my life was talking to a Chanel that no longer existed, I wanted to come forward and say "This is my story, this is me now, I need you to meet me here". </p>

<p>'The main thing holding me back was the fear of attack or blame and I didn't want the fear of what men might do to keep me from who I wanted and needed to be.'  </p>

<p>Brock Turner was found guilty of sexually assaulting Miller in March 2016 , but was only given a six month prison sentence in 2016</p>

<p>While she was still anonymous, Miller's powerful 12-page victim impact statement recounting the assault, her treatment by investigators and the ordeal of facing questions about her sexual activity and drinking habits, went viral.</p>

<p>Part of the statement read: 'You don't know me, but you've been inside me,' Miller reads in the statement that quickly went viral following the court case.</p>

<p>'In newspapers, my name was 'unconscious, intoxicated woman.' Ten syllables, and nothing more than that. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity.</p>

<p>'To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All-American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty with so much at stake.</p>

<p>'You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.'  </p>

<p>Speaking today, Chanel explained how after 'gutting herself' in the statement, she felt 'humiliated' when Turner received such a short sentence. </p>

<p>However, the support she received from the public after the statement was published in the media, meant she 'slowly became confident in herself and her capabilities'. </p>

<p>'It's very strange looking back, after I read the statement in the court room and the sentence was delivered, I thought I had failed, she said. </p>

<p>'I was humiliated and wondered why I had gutted myself and shared all these touchy feely things and wanted to curl up and go home. </p>

<p>'It wasn't until the next day, when it was released into the world I began to understand that what I did was courageous, and slowly became confident in myself and my capabilities. </p>

<p>'It's very scary that an alternate reality had my statement not gone public I would have felt like I failed.' </p>

<p>She added: 'If I had fully believed him and let his sentence dictate my worth I would have been wrong and instead the reality was millions of people were moved by what I had to say, do not under estimate your power and always seek a second opinion.'</p>

<p>Speaking today, Chanel explained to host Lorraine Kelly how after 'gutting herself' in the statement, she felt 'humiliated' when Turner received such a short sentence</p>

<p>However, the support she received from the public after the statement was published in the media, meant she 'slowly became confident in herself and her capabilities' </p>

<p>As a result of Chanel's case,  the law in California has since changed and there is now a mandatory three year minimum prison sentence for penetrating an unconscious person or an intoxicated person. </p>

<p>Chanel called the change in legislation 'very exciting', but told 'any victims' to be proud of themselves at 'any stage' of their recovery. </p>

<p>'It's very exciting, said Chanel, 'And I remember even before the law, my dad would always say "I'm so proud of you" and I would think, "What is he proud of? I'm barely getting out of bed, i'm barely getting by."' </p>

<p>'Now I understand and for any victims watching, I hope you're proud of yourself, even for getting out of bed, at any stage and I hope you give yourself credit.' </p>
