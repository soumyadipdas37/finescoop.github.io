<p>'Mikel has taught me a lot,' said Nketiah, 21. 'He is definitely very personable. He does a lot of tactical work about understanding your role. As a player, it's great to see the manager going into such detail — it shows how much he cares.</p>

<p>'As a young player, if you have the right mentality, you can definitely improve under him and that's something I'm trying to do.</p>

<p>'He's helped my all-round game, given me chances to express myself, make mistakes and try to correct them. I'm learning on the job.'</p>

<p>England are top of their qualifying group and victories against Kosovo and then away in Austria on Tuesday would effectively see them through to next year's tournament.</p>

<p>'These are two really tough games,' said Boothroyd. 'If we get positive results that lead to points, it'll put us in a really good position.'</p>
