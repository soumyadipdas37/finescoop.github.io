<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>American Girl has debuted a new '80s-themed doll who rocks scrunchies and leggings, plays Pac-Man at the arcade, has her own American Girl doll, and watches the devastating Challenger disaster at school. </p>

<p>Courtney Moore, the brand's first historical doll in three years, grew up in a blended family in California's San Fernando Valley in 1986, and like the American Girl dolls who came before her, her outfits, hobbies, and struggles are all inspired by the era. </p>

<p>As the quintessential '80s girl, she loves watching music videos after school, renting movies, going to the mall, and showing off her gaming skills at Smiley's Arcade, but there is also a more serious side to her story. </p>

<p>'The best thing about the new American Girl doll (besides Gen Xers having an existential crisis) is that she has her own American Girl doll,' someone else commented. </p>

<p>'I really can't stop thinking about this on Courtney's display page on the website too,' another person wrote, referring to the date of the launch being written on the chalkboard in her classroom. </p>

<p>And someone else imagined how the coronavirus pandemic would influence a future American Girl doll </p>

<p>'The 2020s American Girl Doll will be named Harper and she will wear a cute face mask, a tie-dye sweat set and her accessory will be a travel-size Purell,' the fan deduced. </p>
