<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has revealed 'ambitious plans' for a pilot scheme next month which could lead the way to fans returning to stadiums.</p>

<p>It follows an announcement on Wednesday that the government is revising its plans for the anticipated return of fans to grounds from the start of October following the recent increase in infections.</p>

<p>New rules mean that the number of people meeting indoors and outdoors has now been reduced from 30 to six, which has been introduced to limit the transmission of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Premier League clubs face losing £700million if they are unable to let fans watch matches</p>

<p>Sport pilot events in England scheduled for the rest of September could be limited to 1,000 spectators as coronavirus restrictions are tightened nationwide.  </p>

<p>But Mr Johnson announced a mass pre-event testing pilot in Salford in the hope sporting venues could start to welcome fans who return a negative coronavirus test.</p>

<p>Theatres and sports venues could test all audience members and let in those with a negative result.</p>

<p>At the Downing Street press conference, he added: 'Workplaces could be opened up to all those who test negative that morning and allow them to behave in a way that was normal before Covid. </p>

<p>There were 2,500 fans at a friendly between Brighton and Chelsea in August as part of a trial </p>

<p>'Those isolating because they are a contact, or quarantining after travelling abroad could, after a period, be tested and released.</p>

<p>'Now that is an ambitious agenda, but we are going to pilot this approach in Salford from next month, with audiences in indoor and outdoor venues.</p>

<p>'And then we hope to go nationwide.'</p>

<p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters says it is 'absolutely critical' that fans are allowed back inside stadiums as soon as possible. </p>

<p>He says failure to do so will cost clubs £700m during the 2020-21 season, which starts on Saturday. </p>
