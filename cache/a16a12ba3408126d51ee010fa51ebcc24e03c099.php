<p>Statistics obtained under Freedom of Information laws by the Sun-Herald, revealed young disadvantaged Australians, with an immigrant or Indigenous background, have received a greater number of penalties in NSW and Victoria between March 17 to June 28.</p>

<p>The data also showed that suburbs where most fines were handed out, had little correlation to coronations hot spots.</p>

<p>Mount Druitt: 77 breach notices</p>

<p>Sydney's CBD: 75 breach notices</p>

<p>Liverpool: 34 breach notices</p>

<p>Potts Point: 29 breach notices</p>

<p>Kempsey: 29 breach notices</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Nationwide stay-at-home orders introduced in March by Scott Morrison's government to slow the spread of COVID-19, saw fines for anyone who was outdoors without a valid reason or failing to abide by the 1.5m rule.</p>

<p>The NSW suburbs which received the highest number of $1000 fines for COVID-19 breaches was Mount Druitt, Sydney's CBD, Liverpool, Potts Point and Kempsey. </p>

<p>But the top five areas where fine recipients actually lived was Mount Druitt, Liverpool, Green Valley, Blacktown and Redfern.</p>

<p>In total, NSW dished out 1209 personal infringement notices, along with a further 210 penalties for more serious breaches.  </p>

<p>Officers issued 77 fines in Mount Druitt - an area which recorded 19 coronavirus cases and sits in the bottom ten percent of Australia's most socio-economically disadvantaged suburbs, according to official government figures.</p>

<p>The Mid North Coast town of Kempsey, which also sits in the bottom 10 percent, received 28 fines and charges and recorded two cases of coronavirus. </p>

<p>Both of these areas have a higher number of Aboriginal residents compared the national average of 2.9 per cent. </p>

<p>Central Goldfields Shire</p>

<p>Greater Dandenong </p>

<p>Brimbank   </p>

<p>Mount Druitt has an Indigenous population of 6.8 per cent, while Kempsey has 13.5 per cent. </p>

<p>But in Sydney's exclusive eastern suburbs, where there was an outbreak of infections, the numbers tell a very different story.</p>

<p>Bondi had 112 cases and saw 16 fines given out, while Mosman had no penalty notices issued at all and recorded 41 infections.</p>

<p>Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of NSW, said authorities should be targeting areas with a higher number of infections.  </p>

<p>'You really want the focus to be hotspots,' she said. </p>

<p>'Outbreak managers will get the most benefit if the police target hotspots and those that are living in hotspots need to be advised overtly that this is what will happen.' </p>

<p>NSW Police said fines are issued to people disobeying the rules and that 'statistics did not always convey all relevant information - for example, there were a lot of fines issued in the CBD and Kings Cross because they were places where people gathered'. </p>

<p>But Samantha Lee, a solicitor in the police accountability practice at Redfern Legal Centre said it appears police have been given too much discretion to dish out fines.</p>

<p>'Such discretion often has a detrimental impact on those who are most vulnerable,' she said.  </p>

<p>The officers were seen conducting Public Health Order checks at homes and businesses across Sydney</p>

<p>Young people under 30 more likely to be in insecure work, represented half of all breach notices in NSW - 40 per cent were under 25.</p>

<p>Residents in postcodes with a high number of immigrants who can't speak English also revived a higher number of fines.</p>

<p>In Victoria, the state's three most disadvantaged communities made up 10 percent of coronavirus fines, while richer suburbs accounted for less than 2.0 per cent.</p>

<p>In the first two months of lockdown to May 19, Central Goldfields Shire, Greater Dandenong and Brimbank copped 529 fines, The Age reported. </p>

<p>However those living in the state's most advantaged communities - Nillumbik Shire, Bayside and Boroondara - were hit with just 85 breach notices.   </p>

<p>Police clashed with anti-lockdown protesters in Melbourne, (pictured) arresting 17 people and fining more than 160 over a rally that started at the Shrine of Remembrance on September 5</p>
