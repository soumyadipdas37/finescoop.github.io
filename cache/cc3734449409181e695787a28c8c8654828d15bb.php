<p>EXCLUSIVE: Love Island Australia couple Amelia Plummer and Josh Moss (pictured) have shared details from their 'surprise wedding' in Sydney on September 1</p>

<p>As she panned across the venue, there were a limited amount of guest seats set up, likely due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Amelia shared a romantic photo of the couple kissing as they posed for photos against a vintage vehicle.</p>

<p>'Welcome to the wedding of Amelia and Josh. 1st September 2020': Taking to Instagram at the time, Amelia shared a video of the picturesque Ashton House venue</p>

<p>Looking the part! Josh, 27, and Amelia, 24, looked every inch the happy newlyweds in breathtaking photos - but it was later revealed that it was a photoshoot to help out a friend</p>

<p>However, Amelia soon confessed to fans that the couple didn't really tie the knot.</p>

<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Amelia admitted that it was definitely something she looks forward to 'some day'.</p>

<p>'We actually got asked the day before by our mate (the photographer - Jack Henry). It was more of a favour really,' she admitted.</p>

<p>'My best friends all thought it was real, and Josh's sister was even confused - everyone thought we eloped.' </p>

<p>'Everyone thought we eloped': Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Amelia admitted that the couple received lots of congratulatory messages by fans, and even confused some of their friends and relatives by the cheeky posts at first </p>

<p>The couple first rose to fame on the inaugural Love Island Australia season in 2018, and are the only original match still together from their season.</p>

<p>Their season recently aired in the UK as the coronavirus pandemic halted production of their own local format.</p>

<p>Josh and Amelia told Insider Voices in May that the secret behind their success two years on was down to avoiding 'outside noises'.</p>

<p>'Don't compare yourself to other reality TV couples':  Josh and Amelia claimed the secret to their success two years on was down to avoiding 'outside noises' and focusing on themselves</p>

<p>'When we got out [of the villa] there was so much media... and that is so much added pressure to the relationship. And also people who were invested in the relationship would come up and say "you can't ever break or I'll cry!"' Josh said.</p>

<p>'A lot of people always ask us "when are you getting married or having kids?", but I'm 24 and not ready... You wouldn't question your friends in a relationship for one year with those questions,' Amelia added.</p>

<p>She continued: 'There's also the pressure of seeing other reality TV couples who are having a baby, getting married, or moving in together - everyone wants to see you progress quickly.'</p>

<p>'As long as you don't compare yourself to another reality TV couple - we just focus on ourselves and it's okay,' Amelia said.</p>

<p>Remember them? The couple first rose to fame on the inaugural Love Island Australia season in 2018, and are the only original match still together from their season</p>
