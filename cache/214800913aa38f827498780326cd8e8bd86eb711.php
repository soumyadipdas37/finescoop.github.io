<p>The Welshman, who left Spurs for a world record fee in 2013, completed a season-long loan move earlier this month and is hoping he can rediscover the form that earned him a move to LaLiga.   </p>

<p>A knee injury picked up on international duty will keep him out of Sunday's game against Newcastle but Bale the forward insisted he is itching to get back on the pitch.</p>

<p>Gareth Bale has insisted that returning to Tottenham has made his energy levels go up</p>

<p>The Welshman completed a season-long loan move after leaving the club seven years ago</p>

<p>'I am happy to be back and love this club with all my heart. I've had great memories here and l feel very happy and confident. My energy levels have gone up,' Bale told Sky Sports' Geoff Shreeves.  </p>

<p>'It was time for a change. I wanted to change for a little while but it hadn't materialised. </p>

<p>'This club means so much to me, it gave me my opportunities, and I felt it was a good time to come back. I feel the club is still going in a great direction and I wanted to be part of that.'</p>

<p>The forward admitted he felt flat for a while at Real Madrid after falling out of favour with fans</p>

<p>Bale won 13 trophies during his seven-year spell at Real, including four Champions League and two LaLiga titles. But his despite his success, the forward struggled to win over the Spanish fans and his exit has been coming for a while. </p>

<p>'I just want to enjoy my football,' he continued. 'In Madrid it was a bit flat for a while, which l think everyone could see. When you are not happy, it's difficult to play at your highest level.</p>

<p>'I am very quiet, I try to keep myself as normal as l can and away from the cameras and media. Maybe that is what they didn't like over there.'</p>

<p>After suffering whistles from the Real supporters, Bale would have been set for a memorable welcome from Tottenham fans but current restrictions mean his first game back will likely be played behind closed doors.</p>

<p>He added: 'Obviously it's disappointing that the fans aren't going to be there at the stadium for my first game back because I feel like the reception would have been incredible.' </p>
