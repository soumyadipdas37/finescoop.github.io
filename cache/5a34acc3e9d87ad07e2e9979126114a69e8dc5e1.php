<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Good Morning Britain viewers were given a sneak preview of what Piers Morgan's caricature in the new series of Spitting Image will look like - and many were left 'in stitches' at the sight of Piers the puppet. </p>

<p>An aggrieved-looking Piers, 55, maintained the rubber head looked nothing like him, saying: 'As you can see, it bears no resemblance to me whatsoever' and admitted he was more than a little disappointed with how he'll be portrayed. </p>

<p>A revamped version of the political satire show, hugely popular in the 80s, starts on BritBox this Saturday. </p>

<p>Piers told viewers: 'I’ve waited all my adult life to have Spitting Image do a puppet of me and then last night I got sent the image and I was like, "You know what, I could’ve waited another 40 years for this"'. </p>

<p>Are you looking at me? Piers, who claimed he'd 'waited 40 years' to have a Spitting Image puppet of himself made admitted to Good Morning Britain viewers that he could have waited 'another 40 years' having now seen the less than flattering likeness</p>

<p>Piers, 55, mimics the pursed lips of his puppet after it was unveiled just before 9am on GMB today; a revamp of the 80s political satire show starts on BritBox on October 3rd</p>

<p>At least his gurning puppet gave viewers a laugh. </p>

<p>After the puppet was unveiled, revealing an oversized jawline and a pair of pursed lips, alongside a greying hairline, viewers took to social media to share their mirth. </p>

<p>And co-host Susanna Reid's face also didn't hold back; the presenter was left open-mouthed by the sight of her friend reimagined by Spitting Image. </p>

<p>One viewer said the puppet was 'a great improvement' on the real-life Piers, while another revealed they almost parted company with their last swig of coffee after clapping eyes on Mr Morgan.   </p>

<p>Gary Lineker, a close friend of the star, shared the image on Twitter, saying it was 'the first time I can recall a puppet to be actually quite flattering.'</p>

<p>Susanna's face says it all; Piers' co-host was left open-mouthed by the sight of the gurning puppet of Piers</p>

<p>Piers' friend Gary Lineker, who's known for having a pop at his close friend, said the image was 'the first time I can recall a Spitting Image puppet to be actually quite flattering'.</p>

<p>It appears not many famous faces are safe from the glare of the satire show, with a naked sauna room Kung-fu fight between Boris Johnson, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin the shocking centrepiece of a trailer heralding the programme's return.</p>

<p>The trailer shows the UK and US heads eating fried chicken in the hot room together before the Russian premier enters accompanied by two blondes and attacks.</p>

<p>The show also takes aim at other A-listers such as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson and Mr Trump feature highly in the two-minute long advert, starting it by discussing Spitting Image's comeback.</p>

<p>The US President states: 'Puppets. That is the very most moronic thing I've ever heard.' </p>

<p>Creators have also put together a Who's Who of famous faces in puppet form, from Priti Patel to Kim Kardashian, for the show's return.</p>

<p>The trailer sees Gwyneth Paltrow advertise some unusual products while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg steals a mobile phone and boasts: 'I've got all your private data.' </p>

<p>Puppets of Kanye West, Ed Sheeran and the Pope also feature in the advert for the new series.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be among of the most anticipated characters to be seen on the show</p>

<p>The puppet of Prince Harry was first seen at a stand at MIPCOM in Cannes, France, last year</p>

<p>Viewers comments, on Twitter, ranged from: 'That is too gross and explicit... can't watch it with the family,' to 'hard to unsee that sauna scene' and 'offending all the right people. Brilliant, keep it up.'</p>

<p>It comes as new images of the puppets of environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg and Home Secretary Ms Patel were released.</p>

<p>The satirical puppet show, which was watched by 15 million viewers in its heyday, will return on October 3 with a 10-week series on BritBox.</p>

<p>Producers previously unveiled images of the Prime Minister, his chief adviser Dominic Cummings and the Duke of York ahead of the show's comeback.</p>
