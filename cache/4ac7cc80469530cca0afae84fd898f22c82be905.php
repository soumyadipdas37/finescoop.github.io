<p>Last year, the mother-of-two had a secret breakdown which she revealed today was sparked by traumatic memories which returned to her while taking part on the celebrity edition SAS: Who Dares Wins</p>

<p>When asked why she hadn't spoken about her financial breakdown sooner, she said: Shame. The main thing was shame.</p>

<p>'I really thought about putting this in the book, I thought I cannot write about piecing your life back together, without literally laying it all out on the table, and one of those things was that I took my eye off the ball financially while my head was in a bad space. </p>

<p>Andrea has previously spoken about how her breakdown was triggered by years of being a 'people pleaser', but today explained that she's done with 'taking the short end of the stick'. </p>

<p>'As women, we slip back into our old patterns there is a comfort in our discomfort , said Andrea. 'But the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. </p>

<p>'I know that sometimes I come across as Mrs Stepford wife and I'm not doing that anymore, smiling and taking the short end of the stick.' </p>

<p>She stressed that she no longer fears other people's opinions of her, and is not afraid to speak her mind.  </p>

<p>'I'm speaking out', she said. 'I was afraid before. The repercussions were terrifying in some cases, but in others I didn't want people to not like me.</p>

<p>'I'm not scared anymore. I say now, I'll say i'm not happy or I'm starting to feel a bit strange and I need to back off. We tend to put everyone else's needs first and that is ridiculous.' </p>

<p>Explaining what triggered her breakdown, Andrea explained that during her stint on SAS: Who Dares Wins, she felt as though her 'mask' was being 'ripped off'. </p>

<p>'What came back was some really traumatic things in my life,' told Andrea. 'I had buried them and we think it's dealt with, but when I did that I had opened the box and couldn't get them back in again.' </p>

<p>Andrea took a six-week break from Loose Women after suffering a breakdown, but did not reveal the extent of her struggles until May of this year.</p>

<p>Speaking in an episode of Loose Women earlier this month, she said: 'Last year I had a breakdown. I also spent much of the following year and much of the lockdown writing about that breakdown.</p>

<p>'What that's like, it's like poking a wound. The book that I've written is the most honest and raw book I have ever written.</p>

<p>'[It incorporates] the reasons why [I had a breakdown]... It talks about domestic abuse, which I have never opened up about before, it talks about mental unwellness, and getting to that breaking point when you can't take anymore.'</p>
