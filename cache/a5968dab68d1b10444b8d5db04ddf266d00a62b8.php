<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 9/11 memorial was left covered in soap suds after vandals poured detergent into a fountain just days before the 19th anniversary of the attacks. </p>

<p>Volunteers blamed the bizarre prank on 'disturbed individuals' after finding a mountain of soap and bubbles on the memorial in Yardley, Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>Police told 6ABC that 'it appears someone dumped a few gallons of dish detergent into the fountain'. </p>

<p>Judi Reiss, the mother of 9/11 victim Joshua Reiss, said she hoped the vandals were merely a 'bunch of dumb young teenagers' who needed 'more education' on what the memorial represents.  </p>

<p>Vandalized: A 9/11 memorial is covered in soap and bubbles after vandals poured dish detergent into a fountain just days before the anniversary </p>

<p>Clean-up: The soap suds are removed ahead of the 19th anniversary on Friday which will see a socially-distanced memorial event take place at the memorial </p>

<p>'It was a little disheartening. But I know just like with our lives, we can clean up we can fix it up, and on September 11 the garden will be at its most beautiful,' she said. </p>

<p>Volunteers said the soap had not caused any major damage but forced a major clean-up operation just days before the anniversary. </p>

<p>'It appears someone thought it funny to add soap suds to the fountains,' they said as they condemned the 'disrespectful' stunt in a Facebook post.  </p>

<p>Mourners are expected to take part in a socially-distanced memorial procession to mark the day itself on Friday. </p>

<p>Police lieutenant Jason Braim said the cleaning product 'created a bubble mass the whole entire width of the fountain itself and about five feet high'. </p>

<p>'This location should not be disturbed a total lack of respect for what this fountain stands for as a monument,' he said, adding that CCTV footage may identify the culprits. </p>

<p>Opened in 2006, the memorial had previously been the victim of similar detergent-based vandalism six years ago. </p>

<p>Pennsylvania will also mark the anniversary with a virtual memorial service for the victims of Flight 93, which crashed in the state after passengers heroically took on the hijackers to bring down the plane. </p>

<p>It is believed that the Flight 93 terrorists were heading to Washington to destroy either the White House or the Capitol. </p>

<p>After the plane was hijacked, passengers on Flight 93 discovered what was happening in New York City where the World Trade Center had already been hit. </p>

<p>The al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked commercial jets in a devastating co-ordinated attack and used them as missiles, both towers coming down within less than two hours after they were hit.</p>

<p>The collapse of the World Trade Center covered New York in hellish clouds of ash while fires burned for months in the rubble of the twin towers. </p>

<p>2,977 people died in total in addition to the 19 terrorists.  </p>

<p>More than 51,000 people have applied to a victim compensation fund that makes payments to people with illnesses potentially related to 9/11.    </p>
