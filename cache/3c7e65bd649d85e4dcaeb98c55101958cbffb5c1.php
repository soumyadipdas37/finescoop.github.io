<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Ham are waiting for Burnley to respond to their £27million offer for James Tarkowski, and are willing to increase it, after holding talks.</p>

<p>Moyes wants to strengthen his defence rather than move for another forward such as Brentford's Said Benrahma. </p>

<p>Burnley value the defener at £50m and are determined to hold onto the defender.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old was courted by Leicester last summer and is set to be in demand again after a solid season for the Clarets, who finished 10th in the Premier League after performing impressively post-lockdown.</p>

<p>Yet it is thought Burnley currently have no intention of negotiating the release clause in Tarkowski’s contract, given the difficulty of buying a replacement of the same level if he is sold.</p>

<p> the England international scored two goals in 40 club appearances last season.</p>
