<p>Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper Harvey Briggs, 52 (right), was arrested Thursday night and charged with assault after allegedly ripping the face mask off protester Andrew Golden (left)</p>

<p>The incident occurred August 10, when Golden was filming a traffic stop while on the sidewalk</p>

<p>Briggs, who was standing across the street, shouted at Golden not to impede the officers</p>

<p>The August 10 incident began when protester Andrew Golden started filming police as they pulled over a protester in a car. </p>

<p>As Golden films the incident, Briggs - a 22-year veteran of the Tennessee Highway Patrol - can be heard shouting at him, from across the street, to move away and not to interfere with the traffic stop. </p>

<p>Golden swears while pointing out that he's on the sidewalk and not getting close to the police officers, prompting Briggs to march over to him. </p>

<p>The two then begin arguing, with Briggs noting that he doesn't appreciate Golden's colorful language, while Golden asks why Briggs has his hand on his gun handle.  </p>

<p>After Golden swore while saying he was isn't impeding the officers, Briggs marched up to him</p>

<p>During the heated confrontation, Golden claimed that Briggs - who wasn't wearing a face mask - ripped off the one that he was wearing and threw it on the ground (pictured)</p>

<p>Briggs was a 22-year veteran of the Tennessee Highway Patrol. He was fired on August 14 and is currently appealing the decision</p>

<p>During the argument, Briggs gets close enough to Golden that they are nearly nose-to-nose - despite Briggs not wearing a face mask. </p>

<p>Although the precise moment isn't shown on camera, Golden suddenly exclaims that Briggs ripped off his face mask and shows it lying nearby a tree trunk.  </p>

<p>Briggs, meanwhile, can be seen marching back to his post across the street. As he walks away, he tells Golden not to impede the traffic stop officers. </p>

<p>When Golden asks the other officers if they're 'going to do something' about what happened, Briggs denies removing the mask and says he's 'tired of you people making stuff up.'</p>

<p>Golden, in his Facebook post about the incident, wrote that he was 'met with a blank stare' from the other officers. </p>

<p>Golden also noted that Briggs is 'A notorious figure at the Capitol protest,' but didn't elaborate on why that was the case.  </p>

<p>Briggs was fired four days later, on August 14, for 'unprofessional conduct.' </p>

<p>He appealed his termination, but no decision has been made about his termination, a THP spokesperson told WKRN.</p>

<p>Briggs' arrest warrant claimed that while removing Golden's mask and throwing it, Briggs touched Golden's face.</p>

<p>Golden was described as having participated in a 'peaceful demonstration' near the state capitol building.  </p>

<p>The Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security said in an internal investigation that Briggs had violated department policy, resulting in his being fired by the THP, the Tennessean reported. </p>
