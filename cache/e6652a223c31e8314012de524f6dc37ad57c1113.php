<p>The Love Island star, 21, filmed the clip in her Cheshire flat as she spent the evening with her boyfriend Tommy Fury and their pal Maura Higgins.</p>

<p>While watching the video which was called My Wardrobe Transformation, eagle-eyed viewers noticed the box of canisters on her living room coffee table.</p>

<p>Molly-Mae Hague's fans have called her out after they spotted what looked like 'hippy crack' laughing gas canisters in her flat as she filmed a video for her YouTube channel</p>

<p>During the video, Molly-Mae showed her fans around her home after making a spaghetti bolognese for Tommy and Maura, before revealing they were settling down to watch a film together.  </p>

<p>As she brought the dinner over, she said: 'Spag bol, Tommy, and Bridesmaids,' referencing the movie on the TV.</p>

<p>However viewers noted the box of what looked like 'hippy crack' canisters on the table and the orange balloon which was lay next to Tommy. </p>

<p>Many of Molly-Mae's fans took to the comments section after noticing the box, with one person writing: 'Anyone else seeing the loons box when Maura is eating the pasta and the orange balloon on the sofa.'</p>

<p>Another person said: 'Casual box of balloons on the table.'</p>

<p>A third said: 'Anyone see the gas canisters on her table?? When she vlogged her food.'</p>

<p>A different person wrote: 'Is that balloon canisters on the table?'</p>

<p>Another said: '12:35 box of balloons on the side table.' </p>

<p>Reaction: Many of Molly-Mae's fans took to the comments section after noticing the box</p>

<p>Molly's rep had no comment when contacted by MailOnline. A source close to Molly insisted she had 'never done balloons', according to the Sun.</p>

<p>Maura and Tommy's representatives have been contacted for comment. </p>

<p>A source close to Maura told MailOnline: 'Maura was unaware that these were in the flat, she was just a guest at Molly and Tommy’s home chilling out and enjoying dinner.'</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that Tommy has been associated with the so-called drug 'hippy crack'.</p>

<p>Nos, also known as laughing gas, is a gas called nitrous oxide which people inhale to get high.</p>

<p>The drug is used by chefs to make whipped cream so is easy to buy. </p>

<p>People inhaling the drug usually do so by filling a balloon with it and breathing it in over the course of a minute or so.</p>

<p> The drug can produce a feeling of euphoria, lead to laughing or fits of giggles, cause hallucinations, and distort the sounds people hear.</p>

<p>Its effects are usually short-lived but it can cause much longer lasting health damage.</p>

<p>Because breathing it in essentially replaces the air you breathe with the drug, there is a risk of suffocation. People may also pass out because of the lack of oxygen. </p>

<p>Inhaling nitrous oxide can also lead to severe headaches, dizziness, paranoia or stop you being able to think straight.</p>

<p>It can also become addictive and, over time, lead to a vitamin B12 deficiency which can cause nerve damage in the hands and feet. Long-term use can also stop the body producing white blood cells effectively, damaging the immune system.</p>

<p>The boxer was allegedly filmed appearing to inhale it from a balloon before his appearance on Love Island in 2019.</p>

<p>In a video obtained by The Sun, the brother of boxer Tyson Fury was seen lying shirtless on the floor, seemingly having a reaction to the drug.</p>

<p>The video, which the website claims was filmed two months before he entered the ITV2 show, appeared to have been shot inside a friend's house, where Tommy rolls around on the carpet.</p>

<p>Others featured in the video with Tommy and are also seen inhaling from balloons.  </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted Tommy's rep and a rep at Love Island for comment at the time. </p>

<p>Official figures showed there has been five deaths per year on average linked to the substance since 2014.      </p>

<p>Nitrous Oxide, has been nicknamed 'laughing gas' due to the euphoric and relaxed feeling people who inhale it can sometimes feel.</p>

<p>The substance - also known as 'hippy crack' - is normally bought in pressured canisters, commonly transferred to a container, e.g. a balloon, from which the gas is inhaled.</p>

<p>Although possession of laughing gas is not illegal, English law prohibits its sale to under-18s if there is a chance they will inhale it. </p>

<p>The effects of nitrous oxide vary depending on how much has been inhaled but they include:</p>

<p>• Feelings of euphoria, relaxation and calmness.</p>

<p>• Dizziness, difficulty in thinking straight and fits of giggles/laughter.</p>

<p>• Sound distortions or even hallucinations.</p>

<p>• In some people, a headache can be an unwanted immediate effect.</p>

<p>Risks include</p>

<p>• Unconsciousness or death from lack of oxygen. This occurs when the available oxygen for breathing is effectively pushed out by the nitrous oxide.</p>

<p>The Royal College of Nursing says inhaling hippy crack can cause 'choking or tightness in the chest, nausea or vomiting and a dangerously high heart rate'. </p>
