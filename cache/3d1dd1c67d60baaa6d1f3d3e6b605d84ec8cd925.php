<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tyra Banks made her debut as host of Dancing With The Stars earlier this month, on the show's season 29 premiere. </p>

<p>And fans of the long-running celebrity competition series were immediately full of criticism, as they mourned the replacement of veteran hosts Tom Bergeron, 65, and Erin Andrews, 42. </p>

<p>After remaining quiet about the initial backlash on social media, the 46-year-old supermodel shared a video on TikTok, about pushing through her mistakes.    </p>

<p>Speaking up: Tyra Banks defended herself as the new host of Dancing With The Stars after facing criticism on Tuesday night's episode and the show's season 29 premiere </p>

<p>'Tonight I hosted the second episode of Dancing with the Stars... and, it wasn't perfect,' the TV host said in the video. 'Yeah, I had a lot of fun but I messed up, I said the wrong words, but the thing is I kept going.' </p>

<p>Then, Banks compared herself to contestant Skai Jackson, who made a noticeable fumble during her samba with partner Alan Bersten on Tuesday.   </p>

<p>'She got back up and she kept going, and because of that she's here for another week,' Banks said. 'So the message is: I messed up this week, Skai messed up this week, but we're gonna keep on going and going.' </p>

<p>'Tonight I hosted the second episode of Dancing with the Stars... and, it wasn't perfect,' the TV host said in the video (pictured on Tuesday's episode) </p>

<p>'Forgive yourself when you mess up and keep going,' Banks urged her more than 1.3 followers on the video-sharing app.</p>

<p>The former America's Got Talent host has undergone two weeks of trolling on Twitter, with many viewers describing her hosting as 'awkward.' </p>

<p>On Tuesday night's episode, many pointed to an exchange with Bachelorette alum Kaitlyn Bristowe.   </p>

<p>Asking for understanding: Banks compared herself to contestant Skai Jackson, who made a noticeable fumble during her samba with partner Alan Bersten on Tuesday</p>

<p>Nobody is perfect: After remaining quiet about the initial backlash on social media, the 46-year-old supermodel shared a video on TikTok, about pushing through her mistakes</p>

<p>After performing on an injured ankle, Banks asked how Bristowe was feeling, to which the podcast host joked that the 'cortisone helps' and she was 'doing okay.'</p>

<p>After remarking not wearing heels during the performance helped, Banks asked to see her shoes. </p>

<p>The request led to an awkward silence, before Banks abruptly said, 'Okay, let's get scores.' </p>

<p>Odd: Many pointed to an exchange with Bachelorette alum Kaitlyn Bristowe on Tuesday night</p>

<p>Awkward: Fans were confused by the awkward moment between Banks and Bristowe</p>

<p>Issues on set: It was unclear if Bristowe simply did not Banks or if she did not have time to respond </p>

<p>Fans were confused over the moment, with one Twitter user asking why 'nobody' can hear Tyra, even after she 'repeated herself three times.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, another noted the similarity to last week, when Tiger King's Carole Baskin simply did not respond to Banks' question about whether she 'tapped into her inner tiger' during her performance. </p>

<p>'Carole Baskin not responding to Tyra was just so awkward for TV, I can’t,' one viewer tweeted last week.  </p>

<p>Mixed reviews: Fans were confused over the moment, with one Twitter user asking why 'nobody' can hear Tyra, even after she's 'repeated herself three times'</p>

<p>After her debut, a flood of DWTS fans desperately begged for the reinstatement of former hosts Bergeron and Andrews, who were shockingly canned in July. </p>

<p>Bergeron had been with the Dancing With The Stars franchise since it launched in 2005, while his former co-host Andrews joined the show in 2014.</p>

<p>In an interview with Extra earlier this month, Andrews revealed that her and Tom's unexpected dismissals from Dancing With The Stars 'was a surprise' and that hers came via phone call. </p>

<p>Loss of heart: One Twitter user declared that replacing Tom and Erin with Tyra 'replaced the heart of the show'</p>

<p>Though there was never a direct reason given as to why the pair were axed, Valerie Bruce, general manager of LA Productions, stated that Dancing With The Stars was being taken 'in a new creative direction' for season 29.</p>

<p>She also offered her, 'sincere thanks to Tom and Erin, whom we will always consider part of the Dancing with the Stars' family.'</p>

<p>The pair were let go just days before DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that Tyra Banks would be taking over their hosting gig. </p>

<p>Adjusting: After her debut, a flood of DWTS fans desperately begged for the reinstatement of Bergeron, 65, and Andrews, 42, who were shockingly canned in July</p>

<p>'Can Tyra please be the first one sent home?' wrote one fan, referencing to the series' nerve-wracking weekly eliminations.</p>

<p>Another Twitter user declared that replacing Tom and Erin with Tyra 'replaced the heart of the show.'</p>

<p>'Nothing against her, but it just sounds so off when you hear her voice instead of Tom Bergeron's. On a year where people WANT comfort of the familiar... it's just a really poor decision,' they explained.</p>

<p>Even worse: One clearly unimpressed DWTS viewer labeled Tyra as the 'most hated woman on DWTS this season,' above the polarizing Tiger King star Carole Baskin</p>

<p>On blast: 'Who ever came up with putting Tyra on this show needs to be fired,' mirrored another</p>

<p>The Tyra show: Devout Dancing With The Stars viewers accused Banks of making the show 'all about her,' due to her frequent comments and her eye-catching ensembles worn during the premiere episode</p>

<p>Many fans on Twitter aggressively attacked the higher-ups at Dancing With The Stars for 'firing' Tom and Erin.</p>

<p>'The person who fired Tom Bergeron and replaced him with Tyra Banks needs be run out of town. She's awful,' one wrote.</p>

<p>'Who ever came up with putting Tyra on this show needs to be fired,' mirrored another. </p>
