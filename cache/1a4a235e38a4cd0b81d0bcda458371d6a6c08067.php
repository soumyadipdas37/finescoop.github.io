<p>Australia will pose a significant threat to England, with various players possessing the ability to cause England harm.</p>

<p>Here, Sportsmail selects five Australia players to be wary of. </p>

<p>England will have to be wary of a host of players when they take on Australia on Friday</p>

<p>Alex Carey</p>

<p>Australia’s white-ball wicketkeeper is yet to fire in T20 internationals, but he shone with the bat during his side’s progress to the 50-over World Cup semi-finals last year, making a fighting 46 in the defeat by England after his side had slipped to 14 for three.</p>

<p>Glenn Maxwell</p>

<p>There are few more thrilling sights than Maxwell in full flow, and he should slot straight back in after time out because of mental health issues and elbow surgery. </p>

<p>He scored a century in a warm-up game on Monday and wants to play the finisher’s role. His strike rate of 160 is the best of anyone with 1,000 T20 international runs.</p>

<p>Glenn Maxwell should be able to slot straight back in and is eager to play the finisher's role</p>

<p>Adam Zampa</p>

<p>The vegan leg-spinner has played a crucial part in Australia’s climb to the top of the T20 rankings, taking 33 wickets at just 19 apiece, with a superb economy rate of just 6.12. Has formed a useful slow-bowling partnership with left-armer Ashton Agar.</p>

<p>Riley Meredith</p>

<p>The uncapped 24-year-old Tasmanian quick has been namechecked repeatedly by Shane Warne and will keep England’s batsmen honest if he gets a chance. </p>

<p>Capable of breaching 90mph regularly, he hit team-mate Marcus Stoinis on the helmet during a Big Bash game last year with the kind of skiddy delivery that makes him so dangerous.</p>

<p>Kane Richardson</p>

<p>The unsung third prong of Australia’s T20 pace attack, behind Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. He bowls in the powerplay and at the death, where England will need to handle his yorkers.</p>

<p>He has just pulled out of the IPL so he can attend the birth of his first child. </p>
