<p>She detailed the lingerie he had her wear, before asking her to go nude, as he offered her one glass of red wine after another.</p>

<p>Later, after the makeup artist for the unpaid shoot went to bed, she and Leder sat on the couch, where she 'absentmindedly' began rubbing her feet against him for warmth.</p>

<p>The Gone Girl actress wrote: 'Most of what came next was a blur except for the feeling. I don’t remember kissing, but I do remember his fingers suddenly being inside of me. Harder and harder and pushing and pushing like no one had touched me before or has touched me since.'</p>

<p>A few years later, she learned that he was selling a book of risqué photographs from the unpaid shoot, which she originally only gave permission to use in a magazine.</p>

<p>Leder provided a copy of a release, which granted him the necessary rights, claiming it was signed by her agent at the time. </p>

<p>The photographer's representatives have since released a statement, denying her allegations: 'Mr. Leder completely denies her outrageous libelous allegations of being "assaulted." It is grotesque and sad that she is so vindictive about the publication of the photos.'</p>

<p>She wrote: 'It’s been nothing short of life-changing to see how many women (and men!) this piece resonated with. </p>

<p>'Thank you to every single person who read, shared, commented and tagged me. I can’t tell you what it feels like to see my words in print and to hear from each and everyone of you. Thank you.'</p>

<p>The I Feel Pretty actress later expanded on the issue with V Magazine, opening up about how she's evolved over the years as a model and entrepreneur in the fashion industry, as well as how she's approached fragile masculinity.</p>

<p>She told friend and photographer Inez Van Lamsweerde: 'In general, you have no control. When I was younger, I just kind of let things happen. And I struggled with that. </p>

<p>'I’m so glad that I don’t [have to do that] now. I’m not this passive person who is not in control. I’m 29, so I’m kind of leaving [that] behind.'</p>

<p>Ratajkowski continued: 'I understand, with love, that men’s experiences have been really limited. The way that men feel and process shame is so different. </p>

<p>'You have to teach them about experiences that you, as a woman in the world, [have had]. Expose them to that.' </p>
