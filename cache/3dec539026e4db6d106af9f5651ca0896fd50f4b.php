<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman in Republican pollster's focus group has become a cult hero after expressing her her frank opinions on the performances of Donald Trump and Joe Biden during the Presidential debate. </p>

<p>Ruthie, from Pennsylvania, was joined by 14 other undecided voters in the focus group conducted via Zoom by veteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>She had originally been on the fence about the vote but later stated that Trump's behavior during the debate had persuaded her to support Biden. </p>

<p>The group watched the 90-minute debate, broadcast from Cleveland, Ohio, as the two candidates shouted and insulted each other while moderator Chris Wallace lost control of the 'dumpster fire' that was the first Presidential debate.</p>

<p>Most of the voters in the group described Trump in a negative light following the encounter as Ruthie likened Biden's struggle to trying to 'win an argument with a crackhead'.</p>

<p>She has since been labeled as a 'cult hero' on social media.</p>

<p>The presidential debate quickly devolved into an unconstrained mess – surpassing prior encounters in the force and severity of the attacks but also into the constant cross-talk and breakdown of orderly discussion.</p>

<p>Barely had the night begun when the two candidates began name calling and fighting, with Biden asking Trump to shut up and slapping him down as the president repeatedly interrupted his answers.</p>

<p>The group said they were largely stunned by Trump's performance before characterizing him as 'unhinged,' 'arrogant,' 'forceful', 'chaotic', 'un-American' and a 'bully'. </p>

<p>In contrast, when asked to describe Biden, Politco reported that the group offered: 'better than expected,' 'politician,' 'compassion,' 'coherent,' and a 'nice guy lacking vision.'</p>

<p>Most of the voters in the group described Trump in a negative light following the encounter as Ruthie (pictured) likened Biden's struggle to trying to 'win an argument with a crackhead'</p>

<p>Ruthie, who described the President as a 'crackhead' more than once, has since been labelled a cult hero online.</p>

<p>Replying to a thread about the focus group, one social media user wrote: 'Ruthie actually won the debate tonight.'</p>

<p>Another commented: 'We should all be more like Ruthie!'</p>

<p>And a third added: 'Hero to women, Ruthie! Thank you for calling it like you see it!...'</p>

<p>There were nine men and six women in the group from battleground states across the country - Arizona, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada. </p>

<p>The group ultimately found that four said they were supporting Democratic nominee Joe Biden after watching the debate.</p>

<p>Two backed President Donald Trump and the rest remained on the fence.</p>

<p>The findings appeared to mirror those found with an instant poll conducted by CBS.</p>

<p>It suggested that a majority of 48 percent of viewers thought that Joe Biden won the opening debate, to just 41 per cent who believe Trump did. </p>

<p>Another 10 per cent of the viewership believed the event ended in a tie. </p>
