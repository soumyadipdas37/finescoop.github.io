<p>End of the road: The Bachelorette's Angie Kent (right) has broken her silence on her split from Carlin Sterritt (left), saying their relationship fizzled out after they left the reality TV 'bubble'</p>

<p>'We finished filming in August last year, and Carlin and I decided to break up... it would have been around June,' she said.</p>

<p>'We were discussing, "What are we going to do? It's getting hard." But we didn't really announce [the split] until about July.'</p>

<p>Angie explained that they decided to call it quits after she left Sydney to spend time with her family in Queensland. </p>

<p>'It just wasn't good. I just kept staying [in Queensland] and he was kind of like, "What are we doing?"'</p>

<p>Fizzled: The Gogglebox star told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday that their romance in the outside world didn't live up to the intense chemistry they shared during filming last year</p>

<p>Angie said they 'tried' to make things work, but the romantic 'bubble' they made for themselves on The Bachelorette didn't translate into reality. </p>

<p>'It was a good for a while, until it wasn't,' she added. </p>

<p>'Our values were different. I'm a little more spiritual, a little bit more carefree and wild, whereas he's more, you know, kind of...'</p>

<p>Radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson interrupted: 'A Christian boy.'</p>

<p>'He's a Christian boy!' Angie agreed. 'He's just... we're just different.'</p>

<p>Conflict of values: She also claimed that her ex-boyfriend's Christian values were a problem for her because she prefers 'spirituality' to organised relation</p>

<p>Angie also set the record straight on rumours that their relationship started to fall apart after Carlin discovered she was texting runner-up Timm Hanly.</p>

<p>She clarified that she reached out all the contestants from the final four to make sure they were okay, and not just Timm.</p>

<p>'There was nobody else involved in our break-up. It was just him and I,' she said.</p>

<p>'I was very open about the fact I spoke to my top four dudes right after filming, because you go on such a hectic love safari - you technically go through four break-ups with dudes that you really like. Of course I'm going to check in on them.</p>

<p>'I always told Carlin when I did. Timm and I stopped talking in December last year, and Carlin and I broke up only two months ago, so it had nothing to do with Timm.' </p>
