<p>Earlier this month, Christine detailed the ins and outs of her daily routine on the show in an interview with Vogue magazine.</p>

<p>The Oppenheim Group employee told the publication: 'I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of makeup. How I look on [Selling Sunset] is not how I look when I wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>'When it comes to the show, I don’t do my own hair. I do my own makeup because I love doing it. The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two and a half to three hours.'</p>

<p>'It’s important in a world where there’s this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia. People think that [things are] real, and they’re not.' </p>
