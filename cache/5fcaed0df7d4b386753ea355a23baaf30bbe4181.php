<p>Men with untreated hypertension are at almost twice the risk of suffering erectile dysfunction, a study concluded.</p>

<p>Greek scientists found men with a history of high blood pressure had damage to the vessels supplying blood to the genitals.</p>

<p>High blood pressure damages artery walls, causing them to harden and narrow.</p>

<p>This reduces blood flow - the key to achieving an erection.</p>

<p>Men with untreated hypertension are at almost twice the risk of suffering erectile dysfunction, a study concluded</p>

<p>The researchers, from the University of Athens, said blood pressure drugs can help things.</p>

<p>But they warned that some drugs can actually make things worse, so a careful approach is needed to select the right treatment.</p>

<p>The scientists, presenting their findings at the European Society of Cardiology, said impotence could also be a red flag that a man is at risk of dangerous heart disease.</p>

<p>Because of blood is struggling to reach the groin, it is also likely to be poor in the heart and brain, which could cause a heart attack or stroke.</p>

<p>The researchers tested 365 men with erectile dysfunction and no history of diabetes or cardiolvascular disease.</p>

<p>About 80 per cent of high-risk patients taking statins for cardiovascular disease still have high cholesterol and may need higher doses of the medication, a study finds. </p>

<p>Researchers from Imperial College London analysed the findings of a major study of cardiovascular patients in 18 European countries including the UK.</p>

<p>Those at the highest risk of cardiovascular 'events' - such as a heart attack or stroke - may benefit from higher doses or injectable versions of cholesterol therapies. </p>

<p>Scientists say although statins are a 'first line treatment', when used alone they will not help the majority of European patients achieve their cholesterol goals. </p>

<p>They found that if high-risk patients take a combination of cholesterol drugs can cut the risk of heart attacks by 11 per cent and the risk of death by 5 per cent. </p>

<p>They carried out ultrasound scans on each participants' genitals to evaluate blood vessel health.</p>

<p>Blood flow velocity progressively decreased with rising blood pressure.</p>

<p>Flow was fastest in those with normal blood pressure, slower in those with high-normal blood pressure, and slowest in those with hypertension - the medical term for high blood pressure.</p>

<p>Taking blood pressure drugs helped the problem for those with hypertension.</p>

<p>The researchers, however, warned that certain antihypertensive drugs - notably diuretics and beta blockers - have been linked with deterioration in sexual function.</p>

<p>Study leader Professor Charalambos Vlachopoulos said: 'The progressive decrease in penile blood flow velocity across the three blood pressure categories in men not taking antihypertensive medication indicates significant structural changes in the penile blood vessels from longstanding hypertension.</p>

<p>'The blood flow differences across the three blood pressure categories disappeared with treatment, suggesting a medication effect.' An additional analysis found that among men with normal or high-normal blood pressure, taking drugs actually reduced blood flow, making the problem worse.</p>

<p>Professor Vlachopoulos said: 'These results imply that hypertensive patients already have significant structural damage in the penile arteries and adding antihypertensive drugs does not further reduce penile blood flow.</p>

<p>'But in men with normal or high-normal blood pressure, the penile arteries have minimal structural damage and medications could have a negative impact on penile blood flow.' He urged men with concerns about sexual dysfunction to discuss it with their doctor.</p>

<p>'For men with as yet untreated hypertension, older medications - beta blockers and diuretics - are not ideal and should be used only if absolutely indicated,' he said.</p>

<p>'[But] switching to another drug class does not guarantee either the restoration or improvement of erectile function.</p>

<p>'This has to be carefully explained to patients in advance to avoid unreasonable expectations,' he said. </p>

<p>High blood pressure, or hypertension, rarely has noticeable symptoms. But if untreated, it increases your risk of serious problems such as heart attacks and strokes.</p>

<p>More than one in four adults in the UK have high blood pressure, although many won't realise it.</p>

<p>The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.</p>

<p>Blood pressure is recorded with two numbers. The systolic pressure (higher number) is the force at which your heart pumps blood around your body.</p>

<p>The diastolic pressure (lower number) is the resistance to the blood flow in the blood vessels. They're both measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).</p>

<p>As a general guide:</p>

<p>If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes.</p>

<p>Persistent high blood pressure can increase your risk of a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:</p>
