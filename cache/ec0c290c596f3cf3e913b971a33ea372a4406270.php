<p>When Sullivan revealed his dying wish was to see his son, Cade, play his first football game of the season for Pulaski County High School, Humprehy decided she was going to make his dream come true. </p>

<p>The game was scheduled for September 11, and was set to be played in Belfry - a four hour drive away from the hospice facility. </p>

<p>Humphrey knew that Sullivan was in no shape for a long drive, so decided to reach out to the local airport to see whether she could charter a small plane. </p>

<p>Just days later, Kentucky dentist, Dr. Denny Brummett, came forward and offered to fly Sullivan to the game on his private plane. </p>

<p>Photos shared to Facebook last Friday show Sullivan beaming before boarding the plane with his partner. </p>

<p>The dying dad was joined by Humphrey, who also traveled to the football game to make sure Sullivan was tended to at all times. </p>

<p>When they touched down in Belfry, the group sat away from the rest of the crowd out of an abundance of caution.  </p>

<p>But when Sullivan's son, Cade, spotted his dad, he quickly ran over and embraced him - a heartwarming moment that was captured on camera. </p>

<p>'Words could not be put into sentences or phrases to describe how I felt at that time,' Sullivan told CNN.</p>
