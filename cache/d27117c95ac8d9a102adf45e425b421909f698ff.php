<p>Mary Irvine failed to report her job as a personal aged care worker in Victoria to the government agency on two occasions over a five year period. </p>

<p>The 56-year-old was claiming the disability support pension due to her severe asthma while making more than $1,000 a fortnight working at Yallambee Traralgon Village from 2014 to 2018.</p>

<p>Mary Irvine (pictured) pleaded guilty to dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception</p>

<p>She also failed to report her income while working in Gippsland for ten months in 2012.</p>

<p>Irvine pleaded guilty to two charges of dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception via video link in County Court of Victoria on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The court heard Irvine thought her granddaughter had been correctly lodging her Centrelink income reporting form for her, which Judge Carolene Gwynn did not accept.</p>

<p>'(Recipients are) not eligible for DSP payments if they work more than 30 hours per week,' Judge Gwynn said, as reported by NCA NewsWire. </p>

<p>Irvine had previously told police her ex-husband spent her allowance on alcohol, though her bank statements revealed she had spent large sums of the cash at Big W, Target and Bunnings.</p>

<p>Judge Gwynn sentenced Irvine to a three-year good behaviour bond and two year suspended jail sentence.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old claimed $108,816 after defrauding Centrelink on two occasions over five years</p>

<p>'(Your) motivation was more need-based than one of sheer greed, yet that does not excuse your offending,' she said</p>

<p>She said there was 'a place for both mercy and leniency' in Irvine's trial.</p>

<p>Irvine must also repay Centrelink the money.</p>
