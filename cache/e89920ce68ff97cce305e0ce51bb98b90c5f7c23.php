<p>West and his kids were also joined by another boy, who might have been the 13-year-old son Kiyan of the 39-year-old TRL alum (born Alani Nicole Vázquez).</p>

<p>The 21-time Grammy winner enlisted Lakewood Church senior pastor Joel Osteen to deliver a sermon where he praised the Wash Us In The Blood rapper's 'inventiveness.'</p>

<p>'I'm watching these fine men and women singing, looks like they're walking on the water. And my mind goes back to that time where Jesus invited Peter to walk on the water,' the 57-year-old televangelist said.</p>

<p>'I could imagine Peter thought, "Jesus, what are you talking about? That's impossible! I can't do that." I think we all have that at times in life where we think, "God's telling me to do something. I'm feeling down on the inside," but we don't feel qualified. We don't have the experience. I can't sing like them. I can't invent like Kanye.'  </p>

<p>Considered taking their act on a national tour: Kanye (R) and Joel (L) previously collaborated on November 17 when they addressed his packed 16,800-seat, non-denominational Christian megachurch together</p>

<p>Osteen added: 'But God doesn't put a dream in your heart and then not give you the ability to do it. I've learned in life, you have to choose between your comfort and your calling. Peter heard the calling. "Come on out here." But Peter was comfortable in the boat with the other disciples. It was easy to get comfortable even in a dysfunction.'</p>
