<p>Earlier in the day, Amanda fought back tears while appearing on Lorraine when she revealed her new single reminds husband Chris Hughes of their stillborn son, Theo.</p>

<p>The TV star debuted her the song, With You, from the musical Ghost on YouTube on Thursday and Chris said it brought back memories of losing Theo back in 2011. </p>

<p>Amanda said: 'It's a song about grief and loss. It's a very moving song. My whole album means so much for me. </p>

<p>'I sing it a lot. My whole album in fact is about songs that mean so much to me and my family. It was my husband Chris who absolutely floored me one day when I was singing.  </p>

<p>'He said, "The last two lines of that song really remind me of how we felt when we lost Theo" - who was our lovely little boy who was born sleeping. The last two lines are, "you took my world away, you took my life away".'</p>

<p>Amanda continued: 'Chris is a typically stoic man who was very supportive of me and our girl Lexie when it all happened and never took time for himself.</p>

<p>'So for him to come out with that sentence, it just floored me. That's the first single we thought to release - very emotional.' </p>
