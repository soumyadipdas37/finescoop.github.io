<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A set of maps of Sydney has shown how the city developed and spread over the 250 years from Captain Cook's landing up to today.</p>

<p>The maps were made using sources from the National Library of Australia as well as early drawings, maps, directories and government documents. </p>

<p>Insurance company Budget Direct created the maps using information from the Office of Environment &amp; Heritage and uploaded them to the company's blog.  </p>

<p>A set of incredibly detailed maps have shown Sydney's most important developments since it was colonised almost 250 years ago (Map of Sydney in the year 1770 pictured) </p>

<p>The city was originally colonised by convict settlers before rapidly expanding into a hub of suburbs. The University of Sydney was established by 1858 (map of Sydney pictured) </p>

<p>The first map was based on a sketch from when Captain James Cook arrived in Sydney in 1770 during his voyage of discovery from the British crown. </p>

<p>It was drawn during the first survey of the area and outlined the coast of modern day Botany Bay.  </p>

<p>European settlement began when 1,485 convict settlers landed in New South Wales with the First Fleet on January 26, 1788. </p>

<p>The penal colony established at Sydney Cove included men's and women's prison camps, the government's mansion and a farm. </p>

<p>By 1799 the colony had expanded to establish a road from the city to a government house in Parramatta and civilian colonies around modern Concord, Ryde, Gladesville and Lane Cove areas.   </p>

<p>The early city and suburbs of Sydney were planned out by 1822 and York Street, George Street, Pitt Street and Macquarie Street were added to the town grid.   </p>

<p>By 1858, there were facilities still in use today such as the University of Sydney, the Australian Museum and the Sydney Cricket Ground.   </p>

<p>By 1984 Sydney had developed into a metropolitan city of suburbs connected by highways and train lines (pictured). Structures like the Opera House and Harbour bridge had also been built</p>

<p>The city established major structures like Sydney Olympic Park, Sydney Football Stadium and the M2 Hills motorway by the year 2000 (map of Sydney in 2000 pictured) </p>

<p>The illustration of Sydney in 1894 was based on rail maps and showed a new tram system, the 'Great Western', 'Great Southern' and 'Great Northern' railways. </p>

<p>It also included the State Library, Art Gallery of NSW and The Strand Arcade. </p>

<p>By 1934 Sydney had completed the Queen Victoria Building, Sydney Harbour Bridge, a high-rise building and developed new roads to connect the city.  </p>

<p>The city's urbanisation continued at a rapid pace and a 1948 map by the Cumberland County Council showed the first town plan of metropolitan Sydney.    </p>

<p>Former NSW minister for planning Bob Carr later commissioned a map to mark the 200th anniversary of Sydney's colonisation, inspiring the 1988 illustration.  </p>

<p>By 2000 the Harbour City had developed Sydney Olympic Park, Sydney Football Stadium and opened the M2 Hills motorway.  </p>

<p>Sydney continued to grow into the 21st century and by 2017 the city had established a focus on creating green spaces such as Barangaroo in the CBD.  </p>

<p>The final map of Sydney showed a snapshot of the city from Google Earth and revealed the true extent of its expansion to a bustling city of over 5 million people.  </p>

<p>Sydney continued to expand further west and developed to house over 5 million people in 2020 (Map of Sydney in 2020 pictured) </p>
