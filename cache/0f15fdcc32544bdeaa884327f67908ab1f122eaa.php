<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Police in Indianapolis are looking for two armed men who shot and killed a mother of four during an armed robbery, injuring her husband and leaving their six-year-old son to call for help.</p>

<p>Wilma Hochstetler, 40, died on Thursday night after she and her husband Jonathan were attacked by the side of a road in the west of the city.</p>

<p>The deeply religious couple owned a roofing business in Bloomfield, 80 miles south west of Indianapolis. </p>

<p>Wilma Hochstetler, pictured with husband Jonathan and their four children, died on Thursday</p>

<p>The pair were working to repair a blown tire on Thursday night when armed robbers attacked</p>

<p>They had wallets and Wilma's phone stolen, then the robbers turned to leave, and opened fire</p>

<p>Jonathan was away with work and driving home, when his tire blew, damaging a trailer light.  </p>

<p>Wilma then drove from their home, with their six-year-old son Bradon, to Indianapolis to help him. </p>

<p>While the couple were working to repair the tire, at 1:50am, two men approached and held Wilma and Jonathan up at gunpoint, stealing Wilma's phone and both of their wallets. </p>

<p>The gunmen turned to walk away, but then swiveled back and shot at them, killing Wilma and shooting Jonathan in the neck.</p>

<p>Bradon, who was cowering in their truck, then managed to find a cell phone and call 911.</p>

<p>Wilma and Jonathan Hochstetler had met through a church youth group</p>

<p>Samuel Hochstetler, Jonathan's father, said his son has had two surgeries, required fusion of three vertebrae, and is on a feeding tube.</p>

<p>He felt lucky not to be paralyzed.</p>

<p>'He said I have total peace, I'm comfortable, I'm encouraged,' Samuel said. </p>

<p>'He said I have no anger towards those men.' </p>

<p>Samuel said that he too forgave the two men who attacked them.</p>

<p>'I extend forgiveness towards the two murderers,' he told Fox 59. </p>

<p>'Revenge only begets more violence. </p>

<p>'My heart’s desire for them is that they would repent and fall on their faces before the Lord Jesus and cry out for mercy for their own soul’s sake. </p>

<p>'Jesus would desire to give them a new heart and a new spirit.' </p>

<p>Police in Indiana are still searching for the two gunmen, who Jonathan says he forgives</p>

<p>Wilma leaves behind four children - Melissa, 16, Abigail, 14, Kendra, 10, and six-year-old Bradon. </p>

<p>Andrew Yutzy, a family friend, told WIS News that the pair were childhood sweethearts living a happy family life. </p>

<p>'They were in the same church and the same youth group, and I guess, they were both kind of shy people,' he said. </p>

<p>'Two shy people met each other and fell in love. </p>

<p>'They were just always the people that were there with a smile, and literally, they would give the shirt off their back, if it would help you.' </p>
