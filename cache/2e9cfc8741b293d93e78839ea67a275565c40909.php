<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A panda in China has developed two bald patches on its head because it rolled around too much, according to a zoo.</p>

<p>Footage of three-year-old Fuxing walking in his enclosure with parts of his skin exposed has caused an outcry on the nation's social media outlets. </p>

<p>The zoo told reporters that the bear's hair loss was caused by the fact that the 'active' animal rolled on the ground 'frequently'.</p>

<p>Footage released by state media shows three-year-old Fuxing walking in his enclosure at Beijing zoo with two bald patches on his head. The zoo said Fuxing was 'particularly active'</p>

<p>Footage released by Chinese state-run newspaper People's Daily shows the male panda walking in his enclosure with part of the skin uncovered by fur.</p>

<p>A report from Beijing Youth Daily said that Fuxing began to lose hair in late July, and the bald patches appeared in August. </p>

<p>Pictures and videos of the bear led to heated discussions on Chinese social media outlets, with many panda fans speculating the cause of Fuxing's hair loss.</p>

<p>Fuxing, whose name means 'Lucky Star' in English, was born in June 2017 in the city of Ya'an</p>

<p>One user of Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter, suspected that Fuxing had got his fur plucked out 'while fighting'.</p>

<p>Another person wondered if the panda had hit a midlife crisis.</p>

<p>A third commenter joked if Fuxing had been worrying about not being able to find a partner.</p>

<p>Fuxing, whose name means 'Lucky Star' in English, was born in June 2017 at the Bifengxia Panda Base near the city of Ya'an. </p>

<p>A spokesperson of the Beijing Zoo claimed that Fuxing was 'particularly active' after reaching the age of three.</p>

<p>A video released by Beijing Zoo in May shows a keeper training Fuxing to roll around. The zoo worker is seen giving Fuxing food as a reward every time the bear completes the action</p>

<p>Zhang Chenglin, the vice director of the Zoo, told Beijing Youth Daily that Fuxing's bald patches were caused by the fact that he rolled around 'frequently'.</p>

<p>He said that the bear often rubbed his head against the ground. </p>

<p>'We think Fuxing's bald patches aren't external injuries, nor has he suffered bacterial infections. [The hair loss] is caused by his action of rolling,' Zhang told the outlet.</p>

<p>However, a video released by the zoo in May shows a keeper training Fuxing to roll around. </p>

<p>The zoo worker is seen in the clip giving Fuxing food as a reward every time the bear completes the action.</p>

<p>It is reported that the zoo has given Fuxing medication, and his hair has started to grow back.</p>
