<p>Smell that? McDonald's has sold some wacky merchandise before — in fact, the chain sold Quarter Pounder-scented candles earlier this year</p>

<p>Burn 'em all! The scents include bun, ketchup, pickle, cheese, onion, and '100% Fresh Beef'</p>

<p>Swag: The candles were part of a Quarter Pounder Fan Club collection of merchandise, which also includes a locket</p>

<p>For superfans: The line also included a 2020 Quarter Pounder calendar</p>

<p>McDonald's has sold some wacky merchandise before — in fact, the chain sold Quarter Pounder-scented candles earlier this year.</p>

<p>In February, the company launched the Quarter Pounder Fan Club, an offshoot of its official merchandise line, with several items that celebrate its beloved cheeseburger.</p>

<p>The most eyebrow-raising addition was a pack of six scented candles that each smell like a different Quarter Pounder ingredient. </p>

<p>The pack includes six custom scented candles inspired by Quarter Pounder ingredients. There's one each with scents like bun, ketchup, pickle, cheese, onion, and '100% Fresh Beef.'</p>

<p>The idea seems to be that burning them all at once will make a room smell like a Quarter Pounder, but it also give customers the option of burning just an onion-scented or ketchup-scented candle. </p>

<p>The candles joined several other quirky merchandise options on the website, including a sesame seed umbrella, gold-colored locket with the golden arches stamped on it, hair ties, socks, T-shirts, a beanie, and a lounge set. </p>
