<p>Haku (pictured) is a four-year-old purebred and has been with the Pham family since she was a puppy</p>

<p>'I love Haku but I was also happy to let them keep her company for a little while longer, because we were in lockdown at the time. They were an old couple, I thought I would be kind,' she told Courier Mail. </p>

<p>Each week from March to July when Ms Pham came back and asked for Haku back, the couple allegedly repeatedly asked for her to stay just for 'one more week'. </p>

<p>'It broke my heart, we have had Haku since she was a puppy, she is a big part of our family,' she said.</p>

<p>'I couldn't believe it, we trusted them with our dog and they refused to give her back.' </p>

<p>Ms Pham then found out that the couple had separated and the husband had allegedly taken Haku with him, leaving the worried mum with no idea how to get her back.</p>

<p>She had even seen the man's new girlfriend allegedly post photos with Haku 'as if she is her own'. </p>

<p>Ms Pham has reported the incident to police and even offered to buy the man another dog in exchange for Haku.</p>

<p>A Queensland Police spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the matter was under investigation.</p>
