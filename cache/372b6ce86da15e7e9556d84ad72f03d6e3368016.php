<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters have vowed to swarm the streets of Melbourne on Saturday in a so called 'Freedom Day' rally.</p>

<p>But many have since backflipped on the plan and are urging other demonstrators to stay at home, labelling the protest a 'trap'.</p>

<p>The marches were expected to last the whole day, spanning across the coronavirus-riddled city including the Shrine of Remembrance and Parliament House.</p>

<p>Now some of the state's biggest coronavirus-deniers have announced they won't be attending, saying any demonstrations could prompt Premier Daniel Andrews to extend the lockdown.</p>

<p>James Bartolo, one of the biggest pushers behind the anti-lockdown movement, was charged with incitement on Friday for allegedly encouraging his mass following to attend the rally.</p>

<p>Thousands of protesters were expected to swarm the streets of Melbourne on Saturday (pictured anti-lockdown protest outside Parliament House in Melbourne in May)</p>

<p>Police have warned anybody attending the rallies will be hit with massive fines (pictured man is detained at an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne last month)</p>

<p>Police smashed their way into his home using a battering ram to knock down the front door. </p>

<p>Following his arrest, Bartolo told Nine News he would not longer be in attendance.</p>

<p>'I wanted people to not go to the protests, now, hopefully, (the) protest won't go ahead, I hope you put that on,' he said on Friday night. </p>

<p>'It's a trap because Daniel Andrews just wanted to blame the protest to extend the lockdown.'</p>

<p>Sharing a video on his personal Facebook page, the 27-year-old said Saturday's march was the 'worst possible thing' to do.</p>

<p>'It is a set up from the get go. It is all just terrible. Don't go to that one,' he said. </p>

<p>'I say don't go because I am concerned about the safety of the brave men and women who plan to go. The police are not forcing me to say anything.'</p>

<p>The Freedom Day rally was expected to be held at Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance on Saturday</p>

<p>James Bartolo (pictured) one of the biggest anti-lockdown pushers has now said he will not attend the protest after he was arrested for incitement</p>

<p>Bartolo urged his followers not to attend the planned protest on Saturday</p>

<p>Bartolo said that with Premier Daniel Andrews' road map out of Stage Four restrictions to be revealed on Sunday, marches on Saturday would do more harm than good.</p>

<p>Police have warned they will be out in full force for anyone who will attend the protests.</p>

<p>Along with Bartolo, three other men have been arrested and charged with incitement of the Freedom Day rallies.  </p>

<p>'The tinfoil hat-wearing brigade are alive and well in our community,' Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius said a week ago.</p>

<p>'They're taking every opportunity to leverage the current situation to serve their own ridiculous notions about so-called 'sovereign citizens', about constitutional issues and about how 5G is going to kill your grandkids.</p>

<p>'It's bats*** crazy nonsense.'</p>

<p>Mr Andrews on Friday backed police efforts to shut down any planned protest rallies while the lockdown rules remain in place.</p>

<p>'You can't ignore the reality you're in and give yourself a leave pass and go and do something that, in all likelihood, will contribute to the spread of this (virus),' he said.</p>

<p>The premier will announce the details of Victoria's road map out of lockdown on Sunday. </p>

<p>A leaked top secret draft for the city's exit road map earlier revealed the government's plan to extend the 8pm-5am curfew and keep restrictions on businesses for an additional two weeks.</p>

<p>While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked map is 'out of date', premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Stage Four restrictions. </p>

<p>Top secret draft documents for the city's exit road map have revealed the government's plan to extend the 8pm-5am curfew (pictured, police roam Melbourne on Thursday)</p>

<p>‘Everything is on the table,’ he admitted. ‘It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.’</p>

<p>According to the leaked documents, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage Four comes to an end.</p>

<p>Single people and single parents would also be given the right to have a nominated visitor at their home.</p>

<p>According to the report, which was obtained by the Herald Sun, there are bigger changes coming from September 28, which includes the curfew being lifted and increased social gatherings. </p>

<p>Melbournians are seen enjoying their one hour a day of exercise as hope of Stage 4 restrictions easing fades during COVID-19 in Melbourne (pictured on Thursday)</p>

<p>The report stated that from September 28, up to five people, including children, from up to two households will be allowed to meet outdoors for social interaction.</p>

<p>Permits will no longer be required for childcare and in-home childminding, according to the document.</p>

<p>Outdoor personal training would be allowed for up to two people per trainer and outdoor pools will open for exercise for up to 20 people at a time.</p>

<p>The documents claim that to move to Stage Two, the state must record a daily average of fewer than five new cases over a two week period.</p>

<p>It must also record fewer than three cases from an unknown source during that time, however, this has not happened since June.</p>

<p>State of disaster: Increased police powers to enforce the lockdown. Cautions will no longer be issued, only $1,652 fines or court summons</p>
