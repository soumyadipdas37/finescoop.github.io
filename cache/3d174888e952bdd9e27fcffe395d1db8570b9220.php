<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>GlaxoSmithKline has stepped up its battle against Covid-19 with clinical trials of a potential vaccine it is developing with French drug maker Sanofi. </p>

<p>The early-stage study will evaluate how safe the vaccine is and what kind of immune response it triggers in 440 healthy adults tested at 11 sites across the US. </p>

<p>If the results are conclusive, GSK and Sanofi are hoping to get the vaccine approved in the first half of next year. </p>

<p>Trial: If the results are conclusive, GSK and Sanofi are hoping to get the vaccine approved in the first half of next year</p>

<p>The pair are planning to produce up to 1billion doses in 2021 if they are successful. </p>

<p>Covid-19 has killed more than 860,000 people worldwide and 41,500 in the UK, according to official figures. </p>

<p>GSK's vaccine uses the same technology as one of Sanofi's seasonal flu vaccines, which will be coupled with a substance made by GSK that enhances and boosts the impact of the vaccine. Britain and the US have already signed deals with Sanofi and GSK – and the two companies are in talks to supply the European Union with up to 300m doses. A number of other pharmaceutical firms and swiftly formed alliances are developing their own vaccines. </p>

<p>Astrazeneca, GSK's rival on the FTSE100, is working on a vaccine with Oxford University that is already in late-stage trials. </p>

<p>Astrazeneca said it could have data available by the end of October to get sign-off from US regulators for emergency use of the vaccine. Russia approved a controversial vaccine, called Sputnik V, after less than two months of human testing. </p>

<p>GSK shares fell 1.2 per cent, or 18.4p, to 1470.8p, after it announced the trials were starting.</p>
