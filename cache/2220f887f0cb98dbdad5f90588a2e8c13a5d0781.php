<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dele Alli has once again been excluded from Jose Mourinho's Tottenham squad for the visit of Newcastle on Sunday afternoon. </p>

<p>The midfielder played for an hour during Spurs' 3-1 Europa League victory over Shkendija in midweek, but Alli has not been named in the starting XI or among the substitutes for the Premier League fixture.</p>

<p>The England international has been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain in recent days, but the Ligue 1 champions are reportedly set to withdraw from negotiations. </p>

<p>Mourinho insists he does not see him leaving before the transfer deadline next month. 'Since Dele arrived from MK Dons he's had ups and downs,' he said. </p>

<p>'Fabulous periods and also other periods when he disappears from the top level. When this lack of consistency happens in a player it is normal that when you are in great form you play because you deserve to and when you are not in a good moment you don't play.</p>

<p>'He is selected. No decision yet about starting or on the bench, but if he is on the pitch for one minute or 90 he has to show us. Pure and simple.'</p>
