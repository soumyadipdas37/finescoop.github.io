<p>Coles Category Manger for Bakery Rosie Anderson said they're hoping the early arrival of Christmas will spread some much needed cheer during the pandemic.</p>

<p>'We've been working hard to bring a timely festive bakery collection to stores early to help raise the spirits of those Australians who need it most,' she said.</p>

<p>A Woolworths spokesperson said the four month head start will allow families to better budget for the festive season.  </p>

<p>'Some of our customers like to purchase products early and have them stocked away to help spread out their Christmas spend,' the spokesperson told Seven News.</p>

<p>'As the impact of the pandemic continues, many customers will be looking for ways to manage their budgets this Christmas and we want to help them do that.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile a Sydney shopping centre has been slammed for erecting a large Christmas tree in the middle of August.</p>

<p>Shoppers were left stunned when they stumbled across the giant tree covered in fluorescent decorations in the middle of the Queen Victoria Building, in Sydney's CBD several weeks ago.</p>

<p>Shoppers were bewildered when they stumbled across the giant tree (pictured) covered in fluorescent decorations in the middle of the Queen Victoria Buildingin August</p>

<p>And while it was hoped the tree would help spread some joy during the coronavirus pandemic, some residents were less than impressed.</p>

<p>'I think it's insensitive,' one woman wrote. 'Just an early reminder to those struggling with job loss they can't afford presents this year for their kids.' </p>

<p>Others thought the decorations were 'ugly' and didn't quite understand the timing. </p>

<p>'Christmas already? Calm down,' another person wrote.</p>

<p>'Why is there a Christmas tree in the QVB in August? Why is it so ugly?' another asked.</p>

<p>While some shoppers thought the tree (pictured) was ugly, others enjoyed the whimsical aspects</p>

<p>However, some were happy with the colourful display.</p>

<p>'How pretty,' one wrote.</p>

<p>'So keen to see off 2020,' another wrote. </p>

<p>A spokesman for the shopping centre said the tree was supposed to act as a symbol of 'joy and resilience for a time like no other'.</p>

<p>They worked with artist Gerwyn Davies to created 'The 2020 Tree', with the idea to make something magical from a 'collective mess'. </p>
