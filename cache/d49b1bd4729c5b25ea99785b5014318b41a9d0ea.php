<p>Request denied: A judge has denied a request made by Blac Chyna, shown in November in New Jersey, to dismiss an assault and battery lawsuit filed by her ex Rob Kardashian</p>

<p>Chyna filed the motion to dismiss in February on grounds that she 'did not intend to inflict injury on Rob and because she did not in fact harm him, Rob's claim for assault and battery fail,' the filing stated.</p>

<p>Chyna's motion to summarily dismiss the lawsuit included a document of 'undisputed' evidence that allegedly showed Kardashian 'did not suffer any congnizable' damage.</p>

<p>The motion claimed that 'the only ''harm'' Rob suffered that night night relates to his heartbreak that Chyna moved out of Kylie Jenner’s home with their newborn baby girl, Dream'.</p>

<p>Chyna and Kardashian have a three-year-old daughter Dream together.</p>
