<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two hikers got terrifyingly close to a sheer drop while climbing across a thin ridge more than 11,000 feet up a French mountain.</p>

<p>Elin Skyttedal, who lives in Swedish capital Stockholm, and her partner bravely climbed the exposed Aiguilles d'Entrèves in the Mont Blanc massif of the Alps in France.</p>

<p>Heart-stopping 360 camera footage shows Ms Skyttedal using her hands and feet to climb across the top of the narrow rocky ridge.</p>

<p>The experienced climber fearlessly moves across the thin ridge despite the terrifying drop of 11,800 feet on either side. </p>

<p>Elin Skyttedal, from Swedish capital Stockholm, climbed across the 11,800ft high ridge of the exposed Aiguilles d'Entrèves in the Mont Blanc massif of the Alps in France</p>

<p>Her partner is seen climbing further ahead on the traverse, with the mountaineers being joined together by a blue safety rope, the video shows.</p>

<p>Ms Skyttedal shared her jaw-dropping adventure on Instagram, where she regularly posts other nail-bailing snaps of her daredevil rock climbing.</p>

<p>She is also an avid skier and hopes to complete some more of the Alps's 13,000 foot peaks, having already climbed across the Breithorn traverse.</p>

<p>Ms Skyttedal has also braved the popular Cosmique Arete climb, which is known for being an aesthetic ridge due to its orange granite.</p>

<p>But the climb demands a range of skills, including mixed climbing, rock climbing, route finding and abseiling.</p>

<p>The jaw-dropping footage was filmed using a 360 camera, showing Ms Skyttedal and her partner climbing across the narrow ridge with a terrifying drop on either side </p>

<p>The rocky summit of the Aiguilles d'Entrèves forms part of the frontier straddling between France and Italy.</p>

<p>The easiest way to ascend the mountain is using its north-east ridge from Col du Toule, which is a popular day-outing for many climbers.</p>

<p>The initial stage of the ridge is easier for climbers, with plenty of scrambling and opportunities to enjoy views of Mont Blanc. </p>

<p>But the ridge leading up to the summit is considerably more nail-biting as it runs along a knife-edge - not one to be recommended for those scared of heights.</p>

<p>The jaw-dropping footage was filmed on July 23 this year.</p>
