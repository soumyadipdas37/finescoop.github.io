<p>Wow! Ed Westwick's girlfriend Tamara Francesconi, 23, posed in a black bandeau bikini after 'eating her body weight in seafood' during their Santorini break, on Tuesday</p>

<p>Tamara looked sensational in her two-piece swimwear set, which featured wooden circles, which held it together.</p>

<p>She layered up with a semi-sheer green beach shirt and held onto a Christian Dore handbag, while wearing a black bucket hat to complete her ensemble.</p>

<p>She captioned her upload: 'Today was the best, ate my body weight in seafood, went off roading in our buggy and got stuck, found a secluded beach to cool off and took the world's greatest nap!' </p>

<p>All the seafood! Tamara also shared a snap of their impressive seaside lunch</p>

<p>Their Santorini getaway comes after Ed was seen joking around with his girlfriend as he pretended to propose while they spent the day together in Lake Como on Friday.</p>

<p>The Gossip Girl star was seen getting down on one knee while he and the model waited for his mum to join them, but Tamara was none too pleased by the act. </p>

<p>Tamara looked at Ed with a displeased expression as he held his hands to her as if he was holding a ring, before he stood up and expressed his disappointment at being rebuffed by her.</p>

<p>But he proved that all was well between them as he quickly gave her a kiss as an apology for making the joke.  </p>

<p>Stuck! She captioned her upload: 'Today was the best, ate my body weight in seafood, went off roading in our buggy and got stuck' while sharing a video of Ed struggling with the vehicle</p>
