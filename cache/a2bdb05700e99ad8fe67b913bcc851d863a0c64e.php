<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New walkie-talkies for the emergency services have been delayed by another two years and gone a further £1billion over budget.</p>

<p>The shambolic project will now over-run by at least five years and cost the taxpayer more than £10billion – £4billion more than was budgeted.</p>

<p>The Emergency Services Network – to be used by 107 police, fire and ambulance services in England and Wales – will replace the current and ageing Airwave system.</p>

<p>It was supposed to be introduced from 2017, with full implementation in 2019, but MPs were told yesterday that the later date has slipped again to 2024 at the earliest. </p>

<p>Each year’s delay to ESN costs £550million – the bill for keeping Airwave going.</p>

<p>New walkie-talkies for the emergency services have been delayed until 2024 - at the earliest - and will cost another £1billion to the taxpayer</p>

<p>Last year the Home Office forecast that ESN would cost £9.3billion, an increase of £3.1billion on the original estimates set when the project began in 2015. </p>

<p>The original prediction was based on Airwave being switched off at the end of next year, the Commons public accounts committee was told yesterday.</p>

<p>Home Office permanent secretary Matthew Rycroft said: ‘The absolute latest that we could turn Airwave off is 2025.</p>

<p>‘And what we are seeking to do is to accelerate that date so that we can turn it off by the beginning of 2024.’</p>

<p>ESN will have an estimated 302,000 emergency service users, meaning the now £10billion cost equates to around £33,000 per user up to 2037 – the system’s expected life span.</p>

<p>Joanna Davinson, the Home Office’s technology chief, told the MPs: ‘A year’s delay... is in the ballpark of £550million. </p>

<p>'We are getting a lot more confident around the technical solution, but the piece that was uncertain was working out the deployment.</p>

<p>‘That’s what’s taking us out to the end of 2024 into ’25.</p>

<p>‘There’s a number of things that we could do to accelerate that and we’re working that through at the moment ... with a view to bring that forward into early ’24.</p>

<p>‘Which although it is absolutely later than the dates we talked about when I was here last – when we said 2022 was the earliest possible date and more likely it will be ’23. We are now looking at moving into ’24.’</p>

<p>Miss Davinson, who earns between £155,000 and £159,999 a year, added that testing of the system on the London Underground began earlier this year.</p>

<p>The £10bn upgrade is already five years behind schedule and £4bn over budget. Home Office permanent secretary Matthew Rycroft said: ‘We need to be absolutely sure that this works, that it works in every aspect as well as the existing system, and in some aspects, better.’</p>

<p>The Airwave system’s inability to work underground hampered the response to the July 7 terror attacks in 2005 and was later adapted to be able to function in Tube tunnels. </p>

<p>Mr Rycroft said: ‘The crucial date is when can we turn off the current Airwave system.</p>

<p>‘Because until that moment we’ll be paying for two systems at once and that is where the additional cost comes in.</p>

<p>‘We need to be absolutely sure that this works, that it works in every aspect as well as the existing system, and in some aspects, better.’</p>

<p>Miss Davinson said 5,000 of the new handsets will be sent out to the emergency services to begin testing ‘over the course of the next few weeks’.</p>

<p>ESN involves contracts with the mobile networks EE and Vodafone, as well as hardware manufacturers Motorola and Samsung.</p>
