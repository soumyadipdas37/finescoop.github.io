<p>Kerching: A demo album written by Ed Sheeran when he was just 13 years old has sold at auction for a whopping £50,000 after it was left 'forgotten' in a drawer for years</p>

<p>Spinning Man consists of various love songs including Addicted, On My Mind and Misery, with the album being dug out from a drawer after being 'forgotten' about for many years. </p>

<p>Speaking of the amazing sale, auctioneer Paul Fairweather of Omega Auctions said: 'An incredible price! We expected it to sell well but that certainly exceeded our expectations.</p>

<p>'It was a fierce battle between four or five very serious bidders and we were blown away with the final price.'</p>

<p>It is said that Ed wrote the album while he was staying with relatives during his busking days and gave a copy of the album to a pal of his loved one. </p>

<p>The pal's brother, Kevin, 48, went on to sell the CD. He told PA: 'My brother put it in a drawer and forgot about it.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ed previously said in his book, Ed Sheeran: A Visual Journey, that he penned the album after getting his heart broken by his first love.</p>

<p>He said: 'In 2004, I made my very first album, Spinning Man, named after a picture that my dad had," he said.</p>

<p>'I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs, and they were all songs that rhymed.</p>

<p>Artist: The Shape Of You hitmaker, 29, made 20 copies of the track and still owns 19 of them after previously stating that he didn't want anybody to 'get hold of a copy' (pictured in 2011)</p>

<p>'One lyric went: 'I'm a typical average teen if you know what I mean'.</p>

<p>'There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence, and I have 19 of them. I don't want anyone else to get hold of a copy.'</p>

<p>In further good news for Ed, the singer recently became a father after wife Cherry Seaborn gave birth to a baby girl named Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran.</p>

<p>The unusual name was inspired by the new dad's favourite book series, His Dark Materials, by Philip Pullman. </p>
