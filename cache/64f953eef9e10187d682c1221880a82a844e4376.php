<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bunnings has pulled an axe-throwing Santa Claus decoration from shelves after it was deemed 'inappropriate' for Christmas.</p>

<p>Eyebrows were raised over the $129 outdoor inflatable, which features a smiling Saint Nick hurling weapons at a reindeer pinned to a rotating dartboard and looks more suitable for Halloween than the festive season.</p>

<p>And it seems the Australian hardware giant quickly took note of the response.</p>

<p>'While we're always looking for unique Christmas items, we decided this product wasn't appropriate and we've withdrawn it from sale,' Bunnings director of merchandise Mr Bishop said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Farewell, Father Christmas! Bunnings has pulled this $129 inflatable decoration from shelves after it was deemed 'inappropriate' for the festive season</p>

<p>Reactions to the unique fixture were mixed, with some shoppers branding it 'peculiar' while others praised its individuality.</p>

<p>At a store in Innaloo, nine kilometres from Perth CBD, a mother was overheard saying: 'I'm horrified, but want one.'</p>

<p>'It's really cool, the target deflates after being 'axed' and pops back up again. There's a few new ones in this year,' one woman said on Facebook.</p>

<p>Another tagged her friend, writing: 'Please get this for next year!'  </p>

<p>One customer saw the product withdrawal coming.</p>

<p>'Here come the offended people demanding it be pulled from the shelves,' he said.</p>

<p>In good news for those who missed out on the sadistic Saint Nick, Bunnings has plenty of other inflatable Santas engaging in a variety of activities which range from the traditional to the downright zany.</p>

<p>Options include Santa playing a saxophone, driving a forklift full of gifts, riding a shark and standing alone, watching the world go by.</p>

<p>They're all part of Bunnings 2020 festive range which was released in August to brighten the mood amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>The collection – which is only available in select stores – also includes pink reindeer, LED and fibre optic trees and giant Nutcracker soldiers that tower over a metre high.</p>
