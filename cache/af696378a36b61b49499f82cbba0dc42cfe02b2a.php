<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Beauty advent calendars get bigger and better every year, and this year is no exception. Amazon has just revealed its Beauty Advent Calendar for 2020 brimming with an amazingly affordable selection of bestsellers.</p>

<p>Costing just £60, but worth over £215, the limited-edition advent from Amazon Beauty is one of our favourites of the season.</p>

<p>It's now available for pre-order and will officially be launched later this month. But given the success of last year's advent, it will likely sell out before its October 15 release.</p>
