<p>In the footage that was recorded on Saturday, the man identifies himself as Armando  (pictured) as he walks through a few San Francisco streets in search of the Democrat's home</p>

<p>Once he finds her residence, he set up a camera across the street and walked over to her driveway. Armando then saluted his viewers, pulled down his pants and squatted in the driveway</p>

<p>After a few seconds, Armando stands to his feet and wipes his buttocks before walking away and leaving behind what appeared to be feces. </p>

<p>'That was for President Trump,' Armando is heard telling his viewers. </p>

<p>The video, which is titled 'Poopalosi', was shared on the YouTube star's page and has more than 20,000 views as of Monday morning. A short time later, Armando shared another livestream titled, 'I'm gonna need a lawyer.'</p>

<p>In that video, Armando claimed that he was detained by the Bay Area Rapid Transit Police at the request of the Capitol Police department. </p>

<p>'It was scary, man,' he said in the second video. 'They asked me about Kamala Harris, and about how I joked on the stream that if she lived in San Francisco I'd sh*t on her house too. They weren't f**king playing.'</p>

<p>According to the New York Post, a Twitter account claiming to be that of Armando apologized for the incident. </p>

<p>'<?php echo e('@'); ?>SpeakerPelosi I know you may not ever see this but I want you to know, I meant no foul harm yesterday when I did what I did. I’m not proud of it at all and I just would like for you to know that. I have no ill will against you or anyone in an elected officials position,' the now deleted tweet reads. </p>

<p>According to Armando's YouTube page, he is an aspiring filmmaker who has backpacked across the US.  </p>
