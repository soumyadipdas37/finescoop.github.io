<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prosecutors have chosen not to charge a man who killed a builder by punching him outside a Screwfix store after he claimed self-defence.  </p>

<p>Andrew Webster, 51, suffered fatal head injuries after confronting a queue jumper at the DIY shop in Warrington, Cheshire, on July 2 this year. A 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault and released on bail.</p>

<p>However, Mr Webster's grieving widow Lisa, 42, was told that no further action will be taken after the suspect claimed self-defence - and detectives had 'insufficient evidence' to prove otherwise. </p>

<p>The heartbroken wife is 'completely devastated' by the Crown Prosecution Service's decision and claims it is the 24-year-old's word against her dead husband's.</p>

<p>She told the Mirror Online: "We’ve lost a massive part of our lives and he’s just cracking on with his life. Andy doesn't have a voice in this, does he?</p>

<p>"Neither person should be fighting but, at the end of the day, you hit someone and they died. You have so many opportunities to walk away and not get involved, and end up basically saying that you were scared.</p>

<p>"How can this even be right in this country? I find it disgusting. I feel really let down. I’m just totally numb. I’m disappointed. </p>

<p>Andrew Webster (pictured with his wife and daughter), 51, died after being attacked by another customer while queuing outside a branch of Screwfix, in Warrington, Cheshire</p>

<p>'I feel like I’ve been led down the garden path in a way."</p>

<p>The Crown Prosecution Service said "the legal test for a prosecution was not met" and there was "insufficient evidence" to dispute the younger man's claim that he acted in self-defence and used "appropriate force". </p>

<p>In a tribute on Facebook, Mrs Webster revealed that her husband's organs had been donated before he died.</p>

<p>'I want you all to know he was my true hero,' she wrote. 'He was just the most amazing, bravest guy.'</p>

<p>Police said there was an 'altercation between two men' before Mr Webster was attacked just after 10am on Thursday, July 2.</p>

<p>Traders on the on GatewayTrade Park claim there was a row over queue jumping. </p>

<p>Police said they were called to an 'altercation' between two men at a branch of the DIY chain in Gateway Trade Park (pictured) shorty after 10am last Thursday</p>

<p>Screwfix are only allowing customers to pick up click and collect orders because of the coronavirus pandemic and there have been long queues.</p>

<p>One worker on the trading estate said: 'I heard there was an argument over queue jumping.</p>

<p>'The rumour is someone pushed in and the other didn't like it and words were exchanged and the guy was jumped.</p>

<p>'It's tragic and such a tragic waste of life over a stupid argument and something so trivial.'</p>

<p>Mr Webster was taken to Aintree Hospital in Liverpool for specialist care but died nearly a week later.</p>
