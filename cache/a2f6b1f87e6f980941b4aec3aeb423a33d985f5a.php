<p>While 'Karen' has been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons in 2020, Sabrina said in a humorous piece for Kidspot that naming a child 'Carryn doesn't fool anyone'.</p>

<p>Other very unusual names for girls that made the list include Chablis, Corona, Graceland, Honestee, Jezzabella, Jinx, Jumelle, Klowee, and Pistol.</p>

<p>'Honestlee, this hurts my head. I'm already not a huge fan of the next-gen virtue names, but a misspelt one to boot? I'm out,' she joked about the name 'Honestee'.</p>

<p>Among the most baffling choices for boys are Axe, Bamboo, Chaton, Dagger, Jaguar, Jevin, Mordax, Rad and Tygrrr.</p>

<p>The addition of x and y are becoming increasingly common, with parents naming their son bizarre names like Jaxtynn, in which Sabrina described as a 'train wreck'.</p>

<p>'Just when I thought the random insertion of X's and Y's into children's names was over, this little fella pops up,' she said.</p>
