<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lady Kitty Spencer put on a loved-up display with fiancé £80million fashion tycoon Michael Lewis as they shopped for rings in Florence today. </p>

<p>Princess Diana's niece, 29, looked chic in a floaty blue and white striped dress for the occasion and wore a mask, teamed with her 30 carat diamond engagement ring worth an estimated £300,000. </p>

<p>The society model reportedly got engaged to fashion tycoon Lewis, 61, who is 32 years her senior and five years older than her father Earl Spencer, after Michael proposed in Cape Town over Christmas.</p>

<p>Last week, Lady Kitty Spencer led the fashion pack as they descended on Florence for a busy schedule of dinners, dancing and haute couture runway shows in a lavish celebration hosted by Dolce &amp; Gabbana. </p>

<p>Lady Kitty Spencer, 39, joined fiancé £80million fashion tycoon Michael Lewis, 61, as they shopped for rings in Florence today</p>

<p>Michael, who is worth an estimated £80 million, donned a pair of blue denim jeans paired with a smart blazer and pale blue shirt.  </p>

<p>Lady Kitty and Michael went public with their relationship during a stroll through New York in May and were seen kissing after leaving Club 55 in St Tropez in August. </p>

<p>An expert previously revealed that the society model was wearing an emerald cut diamond engagement ring with an estimated 30 carats of flawless diamonds.</p>

<p>Speaking to MailOnline, appraiser Oliver Horner from Prestige Pawnbrokers of Channel 4's Posh Paw, said: 'This gorgeous full hoop diamond full band engagement ring is of extremely high quality.</p>

<p>The couple put on a loved-up display as they walked through the city, where they popped into shops and went ring shopping at  the Bvlgari</p>

<p>'The full band is set with large emerald cut diamonds, each stone looks to be approximately one and a half carats and I would estimate the total diamond weight of the ring to be between 25 and 30 carats.</p>

<p>'Judging from the image the diamonds look to be of exceptional quality and I estimate a clarity grade to be between flawless and VVS1 and to be of D to F colour which is the very best.</p>

<p>'I believe a ring of this exceptional quality would have an would cost between £200,000 - £300,000 maybe even more given the provenance of such a piece.'</p>

<p>Kitty grew up in Cape Town and spent Christmas, her birthday and New Year's Eve in South Africa, where Michael is also based.</p>

<p>The couple, who have a 32 year age difference, appeared relaxed as they strolled through Florence on the outing </p>

<p>Michael has three adult children and was previously married to a woman named Leola in 1985.</p>

<p>Kitty, who was spotted at the tycoon’s £19 million mansion in central London last summer, told the Mail at the time that she didn’t feel 'in any rush' to start a family.</p>

<p>'I can see myself having children at some point... but I'm only in my twenties. I do have friends my age who are having children, and they are so, so, sweet, but I think everyone should do things in their own time.'</p>

<p>Princess Diana's niece jetted off to the French Riviera earlier this month and has now made her way to Italy, where she has enjoyed the views of a volcanic crater south of Rome, visited the town of Nemi and toured the Pope's summer palace. Pictured, in Nemi in a £1,750 D&amp;G dress</p>

<p>Lewis' previous wife, Leola, 59, signed a prenuptial agreement but it's not yet known whether Lady Kitty will do the same. </p>

<p>Last week, Kitty joined a host of other fashionistas who flew into Tuscany to enjoy at least three different events hosted at exclusive venues across the city by D&amp;G.</p>
