<p>The original Batmobile went under the hammer for the first time in 2013, 47 years after its designer built it from an old Lincoln Futura he bought for $1, and sold for an eye-popping $4.6million.</p>

<p>Car customiser George Barris transformed the banger into the sleek black vehicle that starred in the legendary film and TV series. </p>

<p>The Batmobile started out as a 1955 Lincoln Futura which Barris bought from Ford in 1965 for a nominal $1.</p>

<p>He then spent 15 days and $15,000 transforming the concept car into the one-of-a-kind Batmobile to be driven by actor Adam West. </p>
