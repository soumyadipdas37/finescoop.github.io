<p>During the interview Skin was speaking about the difficulties couples have faced in lockdown, saying: 'Lockdown has been a real test of a relationship.</p>

<p>'A lot of people are like ''Wow, we really didn't get on and that was the end of that relationship, because I realised in two months of being in lockdown that we're not the same people.''</p>

<p>'And some other people, like me, got engaged… You know what, I think you're the first person I've told. Oops!'</p>

<p>Skin - who is openly bisexual - also spoke about the nasty racism, sexism and homophobia she's faced in her 25 years in the music industry.</p>

<p>She said: 'What I’m most scared of right now is people leaning into their darker sides of nature, we see that in so many ways: we see that in racism, in sexism, homophobia.</p>

<p>'Right now, I think it’s easy for people to slide into gentle racism because things are difficult for them to understand and unfamiliar. I’m scared of that becoming a normal response to things. </p>

<p>'In England we got to a place where we were much more open and much more liberal in life. I feel like in the last few years this has been closing down, and that doesn’t bode well for us and people in my community. </p>

<p>'The moment Brexit happened, literally the next day the atmosphere just changed and gave power to a certain small percentage of people who don’t like us and people like me.'</p>
