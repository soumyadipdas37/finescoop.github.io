<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lewis Hamilton's hopes of matching Michael Schumacher's race victory record were put on hold as he finished third at the Russian Grand Prix following a ten-second penalty.</p>

<p>The British driver who started on pole position, was under investigation before the race had even begun, after he did two practice starts outside of the designated zone.</p>

<p>Hamilton did his two practice starts further down the pit exit than he was allowed to do so, and as a result he lost the lead and will have to wait for his 91st career victory.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton missed out on his first opportunity to match Michael Schumacher's 91 wins</p>

<p>Hamilton was under investigation before the start for two practice start infringements</p>

<p>It meant Hamilton who was in the lead was punished with two five-second penalties</p>

<p>Replays showed Hamilton performing a practice start well down the pit exit, causing several drivers to swerve across the white line as they accelerated out of the pits.</p>

<p>The race director’s event notes for the Russian Grand Prix, under Article 19, state that practice starts may only be carried out on the right-hand side after the pit exit lights.</p>

<p>19.2 states that for reasons of safety and sporting equity cars may not stop in the fast lane at any time the pit lane is open without a justifiable reason.</p>

<p>As well as two five-second penalties, Hamilton was also awarded one penalty point for each infringement taking his total to ten.</p>

<p>It means that should Hamilton get two more penalty points by the Turkish Grand Prix, then the 35-year-old might even face a race-ban,</p>

<p>Hamilton was unhappy with the decision which saw him fall behind eventual race-winner Valterri Bottas and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton dropped places to Valterri Bottas and Max Verstappen to finish in third place</p>

<p>When told about the penalty he asked his race engineer 'what happened, what happened?'</p>

<p>Once it was explained why he got the penalty he added: 'Bull****, where is that in the rule book?'</p>

<p>Hamilton kept his lead at the start but dropped down the field following his pit-stop to 11th position - though with everyone in front of him yet to pit.</p>

<p>He complained to his team for bringing him into the pits earlier than he would have liked. </p>

<p>Hamilton received two penalty points at both the 2019 Brazilian and 2020 Austrian Grand Prix for collisions with Red Bull's Alex Albon.</p>

<p>He also received two points for a yellow-flag violation in qualifying at this year's Austrian Grand Prix. </p>

<p>At the Italian Grand Prix he received two penalty points for entering the pits when the pit-lane was closed following Charles LeClerc's crash, which also cost him a potential victory.</p>

<p>His two penalty points means he has now four races to avoid any sort of infringements before the two points from Brazil last season are wiped off his tally.</p>

<p>As well as missing out on the record it also meant that Hamilton's championship lead drops to 45 points ahead of team-mate Bottas.</p>
