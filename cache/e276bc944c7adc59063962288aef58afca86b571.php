<p>Glamorous: Chloe Green showcased her style credentials as she attended the 2020 Monte Carlo Gala for Planetary Health in Monaco on Thursday</p>

<p>The mother-of-one fittingly seemed to have drawn inspiration from the ocean for her outfit, as she dazzled in a sea blue gown. </p>

<p>The glittering dress featured vibrant splashes of colour that caught the eye, whilst it clung to her every curve. </p>

<p>Chloe completed the look by toting a bejewelled nude clutch bag, and gave her face mask the same treatment, opting for a rhinestone encrusted covering.  </p>

<p>Turning heads: Daring to clash colours and prints, the 29-year-old socialite was a vision of beauty as she walked the blue carpet</p>

<p>Hosted by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, the annual event gathers leading philanthropists, talents and scientists to join forces and launch the charity's initiatives to bridge the widening gap between health and the environment. </p>

<p>The 2020 Monte-Carlo Gala for Planetary Health aims to highlight the idea that our future is dependent on healthy ecosystems.</p>

<p>Hosted by the Prince’s foundation, it has gathered talents, philanthropists, decision makers and scientists to discuss the challenges the planet’s environment faces.  </p>

<p>The night is usually auction filled with many collectables, memorabilia and fine art from some of the most high-profile artists across the globe going on sale.</p>

<p>Proceeds will be used to help the Foundation's initiatives, which includes the development of marine protected areas, protection of threatened marine species, the mitigation of the impact of climate change and acidification on the ocean, as well as the fight against plastic pollution.  </p>

<p>However it's likely this year's event has seen drastic changes to ensure social distancing can be adhered to, with many stars also donning masks as they arrived on the blue carpet. </p>

<p>Star-studded: Milutin Gatsby, Helen Mirren, Prince Albert II of Monaco, Princess Charlene of Monaco, Andy Garcia and Kate Beckinsale were among the guests at the gala </p>
