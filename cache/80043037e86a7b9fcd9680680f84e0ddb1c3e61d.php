<p>The caramel cups have been a huge hit among Australian shoppers for years, with the product selling out every time it launched in stores for a limited time only.</p>

<p>'Toffifee is only available this week at Aldi in Australia. Woohoo! I stocked up and bought 60 large boxes,' one shopper previously said on social media. </p>

<p>'I hope it lasts until next year when they're available again! Why can't they be sold all year round? There's such a market for them.'</p>

<p>But customers will no longer have to worry about missing out on getting their hands on the sought-after treats - as the retailer confirmed they are here to stay permanently on shelves.</p>

<p>'Toffifee has previously been available at Aldi as a limited edition product and has only recently become part of the everyday range,' an Aldi spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>Made by the same creators of Werther's Original and Knoppers, Toffifee features a caramel shell filled with a creamy nougat, a crunchy hazelnut, and topped with a drop of rich chocolate. </p>
