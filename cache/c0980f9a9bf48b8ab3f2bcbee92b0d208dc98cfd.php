<p>Vidal's deal runs until the end of June next year, but he is eager to leave the club. </p>

<p>As reported by Sky Sport Italia, Inter Milan are leading the race to sign Vidal, with Antonio Conte rating the Chile international highly. </p>

<p>Arturo Vidal's agents have entered talks with Barcelona's board over terminating his contract</p>

<p>Vidal made 43 appearances last season, scoring eight goals, but he is one of a host of players who could depart as Barcelona look to overhaul their squad.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old has been vocal in his criticism of Barcelona, criticising the club for being too reliant on Lionel Messi and having too many youth products in the first-team. He slammed the club fro having just '13 professional players'.</p>

<p>Vidal told Daniel Habif's YouTube channel: 'Barcelona have to change their way of thinking. Football has moved on a lot and the [whole] DNA [thing] is being left behind because other teams are improving in other aspects: football at the moment is more physical, more dependent on power and speed and the technical side is sometimes less important.</p>

<p>Inter Milan are the front-runners to sign Vidal, with Antonio Conte rating the midfielder highly</p>

<p>'The last three years are not what a team like Barcelona deserves. The best team in the world cannot have 13 professional players. You cannot always win with DNA.' </p>

<p>Vidal joined Barcelona from Bayern Munich in 2018 and has played 96 times for the club. </p>

<p>He won the LaLiga title during his first season, but last season was hugely frustrating for Barcelona as they failed to win a trophy. </p>

<p>There is much uncertainty at Barcelona at present, with new manager Ronald Koeman overseeing an overhaul of the squad, while the club are also dealing with the high-profile issue of Messi's desire to leave the club. </p>
