<p>'Mortified': Tamzin Outhwaite has claimed that Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli (pictured) refused to let her star in close-ups for an advert, as she was struggling with acne</p>

<p>She said: 'There have been times in my life where I've had such bad acne that it's affected my work. </p>

<p>'When I was in my early 20s, I was doing a champagne commercial as a champagne bubble. I had a little blonde wig.</p>

<p>'It was Don Johnson playing the piano. We were the champagne bubbles on the piano keys. We were in gold all-in-ones.</p>

<p>Open: The actress spoke candidly about her skin battles during an appearance on Celebrity Skin Talk with Scott McGlynn</p>

<p>'Bruno was our choreographer, we were filming in Barcelona. One morning my acne came up very bad around my jaw line, it was raised and it couldn't be covered.</p>

<p>'I remember Bruno said, ''I'm really sorry, but I'm going to have to sit you out for this close up shot''. It was because of my acne. </p>

<p>'I was mortified. I do remember feeling mortified that something so physical on my face was stopping me doing what I loved.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Bruno Tonioli for comment.</p>

<p>Jaw-dropping: Tamzin starred in an advert for Freixenet sparkling wine in her early 20s, but claims she was told to 'sit out' on filming close-ups by choreographer Bruno</p>

<p>Awkward: She added: 'I was mortified. I do remember feeling mortified that something so physical on my face was stopping me doing what I loved'</p>

<p>Tamzin first rose to prominence when she joined the cast of EastEnders as fiery Mel Owen in 1998, after training at the legendary Sylvia Young Theatre School.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bruno had long been known for his work as a choreographer before joining the Strictly judging panel in 2004, and is the mind behind some of the UK's most iconic advertisements. </p>

<p>It comes after BBC announced that Bruno would not be appearing on the Strictly panel this series, due to travel restrictions introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The star, who lives in Los Angeles and is a judge on Strictly's US counterpart Dancing With The Stars, will make several appearances throughout the series on the results show to offer his viewers on the celebrity couples' performances.</p>
