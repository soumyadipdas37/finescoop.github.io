<p>An adventure-loving bride and a groom (pictured Skye and Ryan Myers) have posed for wedding photographs on the edge of a cliff after having to downsize their nuptials because of COVID-19</p>

<p>Ryan, 30, and Skye (pictured on the edge of the cliff), 28, from Mountain Home, Arkansas, wanted a big ceremony but had to change their plans due to coronavirus restrictions</p>

<p>For the occasion, photographer Mason Gardner captured images of Ryan and Skye grasping on to one another.</p>

<p>Ryan said: 'We are avid adventures and love the outdoors - hiking, kayaking, boating and camping rotate spots on our agenda, so we are always looking for the next epic adventure. </p>

<p>'Somewhere in the middle of June this year, after being together for more than four years, I told her I didn't want to wait any longer to being married to her', recalled the groom.</p>

<p>'We wanted a big wedding, but had minimal time to plan it because Skye started nursing school, and with the pandemic regulations we were having difficulties deciding on how to proceed with a wedding. </p>

<p>For the occasion, photographer Mason Gardner captured images of Ryan and Skye (pictured in her glamorous wedding dress) grasping on to one another</p>

<p>'That's when we started looking at gorgeous iconic spots for an outside ceremony, so that it would be magical and memorable.' </p>

<p>Couples in Arkansas can have a wedding of around 100 people, but the venue must follow a long list of requirements, including social distancing measures and providing hand sanitizer stations at every entrance and exit.</p>

<p>Ryan said the wedding took place at Hawksbill Crag with about 12 guests, and it was at the end of the ceremony that the breath-taking photoshoot was taken. </p>

<p>He said: 'For the photos, Skye was in a sit harness designed for climbing. Everyone included had experience and was well-trained in climbing. All equipment and safety gear used was inspected and cleared by an expert.</p>

<p>'Our crew was made up of myself, my best man Gage, Skye and her sister Summer, one rappelling expert and our photographer, who was amazing!'</p>
