<p>Rodman, who has dated the likes of Madonna and Carmen Electra in the past, has been involved with social issues lately. </p>

<p>In June, he pleaded with demonstrators to protest police brutality peacefully. </p>

<p>Rodman condemned looters in a social media video at the time, saying 'we're human beings, not f***ing animals.'   </p>

<p>He weighed in on the demonstrations to protest the killing of George Floyd, saying that protesters were crossing the line into looting and rioting over Floyd's killing.</p>

<p>'Someone needs to come out and say, 'Hey, guys. Why are we looting? Why are we stealing? Why are we creating more issues?'' Rodman said in the video. </p>

<p>'This is a bad, bad situation - but [if you're going to protest], protest in the right way. You don't have to go and burn down things, steal things.</p>

<p>'We're human beings, we're not f**king animals.' </p>
