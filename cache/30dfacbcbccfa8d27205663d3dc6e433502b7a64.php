<p>Tough: Paris Hilton, 39, (L) almost broke down as she listened to shock jock Kyle Sandilands (R) discuss his troubled childhood during interview for new documentary on KIIS FM on Tuesday</p>

<p>'I understand, I had a sh<em>t childhood as well. Homeless, parents didn't want me, threw me out, sh</em>t like that,' Kyle continued. </p>

<p>'Hearing your story from your childhood, very different upbringing from me, but to realise the loneliness, the sadness, how you created a shell. </p>

<p>'I couldn't be more impressed...I felt such a connection. I wanted to reach into the TV screen and give you a little squeeze. I thought it was amazing.' </p>

<p>Paris could then be heard with a shaking voice telling Kyle and co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson how she was becoming emotional: 'You're going to make me cry, thank you,' she sobbed.     </p>

<p>Paris and Kyle then bonded over not being happy as she spoke of how money and fame could not buy happiness. </p>

<p>'Success has always been something that has driven me.' she continued: 'I think growing up in my family has always been a lot to live up to.' </p>

<p>Paris said her trauma at the schools she went to inspired her to become successful, so nobody could control her or tell her what to do.    </p>
