<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It looked like being another one of those afternoons in favour of Lewis Hamilton. Ones we have all been grown accustomed to now.</p>

<p>He led into the first corner of the Italian Grand Prix, and his only realistic challenger in Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas had suffered a poor start and dropped places from second.</p>

<p>Anyone who has watched Formula One for the past six years of heavy Mercedes domination will by now know this kind of scenario a vast majority of the time leads to a straight forward victory for the world champion.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton looked on course for a straight forward win at the Italian Grand Prix</p>

<p>But after suffering a pit-stop fiasco he picked up a penalty effectively dropping him to last</p>

<p>Except F1 can work in mysterious ways and when you least expect it. An accident or retirement anywhere on the track can have implications all through the field up to and including a dominating race leader.Â </p>

<p>Around 19 laps into the race, Hamilton was cruising with an advantage of over 10 seconds, but Kevin Magnussen's retirement for Haas around the pit-stop window threw what was turning into another processional F1 weekend into total chaos when the safety car was brought out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Hamilton, luck was simply against him. His track position meant his team had mere seconds to react in whether to bring him in for a pit-stop or risk staying out and losing out in strategy.</p>

<p>Charles Leclerc suffered a huge crash which brought out the red flags at the Italian Grand Prix</p>

<p>His crash came before Hamilton had a chance to serve his stop/go penalty punishment</p>

<p>In doing so clear instructions heading into the final parabolica corner warning drivers not to pit in with a red 'x' on digital boards were ignored or missed.</p>

<p>From the moment Hamilton then entered the pit-lane, his race was doomed.</p>

<p>After an investigation, he was given a 10-second stop/go penalty which is the harshest in-race punishment a driver can receive. He wasn't the only one to suffer the fate, with Alfa Romeo's Antonio Giovinazzi doing the same and collecting the penalty.</p>

<p>Hamilton had pitted illegally in a period when the pit-lane was closed to the drivers</p>

<p>Despite retaking the lead after his pit exit, his race advantage was all but wiped out</p>

<p>Had the race continued, Hamilton could have served his penalty and perhaps had a better chance of salvaging a better final position.</p>

<p>As it was Charles Leclerc's spectacular crash in his Ferrari a few laps later made his scenario even worse, especially when the confirmation of his penalty had not been made official by race stewards at the time.</p>

<p>Leclerc's crash brought the race to a stop via the red flag, and that meant Hamilton would have to serve his grid penalty almost immediately after the restart. Although he was leading at the time, it would have little help to where he would end up once his penalty was served as he was certain to come out in a distant last place.</p>

<p>On lap 28 at just after the halfway point of the race, Hamilton made his stop to come out nearly half a minute behind the pack, and from then on his race was only ever going to be about damage limitation, and that meant just securing a points finish.</p>

<p>A bunched grid at the restart following the red flag left Hamilton knowing his penalty that had yet to be served would drop him to a distant last place</p>

<p>Despite leading into turn one, the world champion pitted at the end of the lap</p>

<p>Fortunately the Monza circuit has a few decent overtaking spots and it allowed Hamilton to brush up on his racecraft of having to overtake cars to eventually secure a very respectable seventh place finish given the circumstances around it.</p>

<p>With his title rivals in Max Verstappen (who didn't even finish) and Bottas only securing fifth, it also meant little damage was done to his already healthy championship advantage.</p>

<p>It seems the Brit felt wronged by the decision to give him a stop/go penalty. He questioned his team about the decision to pit him, and then during the red flag period the stewards over the evidence of his penalty.</p>

<p>The evidence was stacked against him and whether his 'this is b*******' outburst after serving his penalty that put him last was against the penalty or just part of the bad luck he had suffered, he was clearly frustrated knowing he had certainly lost a race he was all but certain to win had outside circumstances not intervened.</p>

<p>Hamilton though showed his credentials to overtake nearly half the field to finish seventh, while his team-mate Valtteri Bottas (second front) only overtook one car after the restart</p>

<p>On the face of it it was a disastrous Sunday for Hamilton but there were positives to take. His championship advantage has hardly taken a dent and has only been reduced to 47 points from 50.</p>

<p>But in a season where winning constantly from the front has been used as a weapon against him, he also proved he can still carve through the grid better than most of his peers.</p>

<p>In the same car as Bottas he overtook nearly half the field, while his team-mate could climb one position following the restart. Hamilton's racing pedigree would have only grown after this weekend.</p>
