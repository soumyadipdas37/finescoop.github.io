<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Osher Günsberg has hosted eight seasons of The Bachelor since 2013, but has never revealed his favourite suitor.</p>

<p>But he hinted on the Cocktails and Roses podcast on Thursday that one leading man left him particularly impressed: 2015's Sam Wood.</p>

<p>The TV presenter, 46, said that he really respected gym owner Sam, 40, for how he didn't string along women he wasn't interested in.</p>

<p>Does Osh have a favourite suitor? Osher Günsberg, who has hosted eight seasons of The Bachelor since 2013, hinted on Thursday that one leading man left him particularly impressed</p>

<p>He was discussing Wednesday night's episode of The Bachelor with ex-contestant Alisha Aitken-Radburn when he praised Sam's conduct on the show.</p>

<p>Alisha noted how disappointing it must have been for Steph Harper to go on a single date with Locky Gilbert and not return to the mansion with a rose.</p>

<p>When this happens late in the season, this usually means the woman in question is going to be sent home at the next rose ceremony - which could be days away.</p>

<p>Good bloke: Osher said that he really respected 2015 suitor Sam Wood (left, with his winning contestant Snezana Markoski) for how he didn't string along women he wasn't interested in</p>

<p>Osher pointed at that during his season Sam would send women home straight away if he didn't feel a connection, rather than dragging them to a rose ceremony and potentially giving them false hope.</p>

<p>He said: 'If you're a prospective Bachelor and you're listening to this show as research - if you're in like the pre-[show] bubble lockdown figuring out what the hell you're going to do as the Bachelor - Sam Wood it, mate.</p>

<p>'If you're not feeling on the single, in my opinion be a big man, Sam Wood it and say goodnight right there and then.</p>

<p>Right decision: Osher pointed at that during his season Sam would send women home straight away if he didn't feel a connection, rather than dragging them to a rose ceremony and potentially giving them false hope. Sam is pictured with Snezana, whom he married in 2018</p>

<p>'Don't make them wait another couple of days for a rose ceremony.'</p>

<p>Sam went on to choose single mother Snezana Markoski during the 2015 season finale, and they got engaged later that year. They married in Byron Bay in 2018.</p>

<p>The reality TV lovebirds have since welcomed two children, Willow and Charlie. He is also a stepfather to 15-year-old Eve, Snezana's daughter from a previous relationship.</p>

<p>The one: Sam chose single mother Snezana Markoski (pictured) during the 2015 season finale. They got engaged later that year, married in 2018, and have gone on to welcome two children</p>

<p>Osher has hosted every season of The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since Channel 10 bought the licence to the U.S. dating franchise in 2013.</p>

<p>He even found love on the show himself when he met freelance makeup artist Audrey Griffen on set of Blake Garvey's season in 2014.</p>

<p>The couple married in 2016 and welcomed a son named Wolfgang in August 2019.</p>

<p>Osher is also a stepfather to Georgia, Audrey's teenage daughter from a previous relationship.</p>
