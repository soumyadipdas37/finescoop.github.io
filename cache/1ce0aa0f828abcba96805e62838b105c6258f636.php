<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Parents locked down in Melbourne can rejoice after a little-known rule revealed they are entitled to an extra hour of exercise with their children.</p>

<p>Stage Four restrictions enforced in the coronavirus-riddled city mean residents can only exercise for one hour a day and with only one other person.</p>

<p>But a rule that has been clarified on the Department of Health's website has now indicated parents can go for an additional hour of exercise with their children.</p>

<p>'Parents or carers of children can take their children for one hour of active outdoor play outside the home,' the DHHS website says.</p>

<p>'This is separate to the one hour of exercise allowed for parents or carers each day.'</p>

<p>Melbourne residents can only leave their homes to exercise, to give or receive care, work or study or for necessary shopping (pictured woman running in the Tan on August 24)</p>

<p>The website also said to reduce the risk of spreading the killer virus, only the minimum number of parents or carers should accompany the child.</p>

<p>The huge revelation comes five weeks into the lockdown which has seen residents stuck inside their homes only permitted to leave for four reasons.</p>

<p>These include to exercise, to give or receive care, work or study and for necessary shopping.</p>

<p>The strict Stage Four restrictions were imposed on August 2 with Premier Daniel Andrews saying all exercise was to be done within the neighbourhood. </p>

<p>'Recreational activity is no longer allowed, you'll be allowed to have one hour of exercise no further than 5km from your home that means it's fresh air, it's a jog, it's a walk, it is in you local neighbourhood,' he said.</p>

<p>A DHHS spokesperson said the exercise rule was not new but would benefit workers who have changing schedules like frontline workers.</p>

<p>It comes as Mr Andrews is expected to announce the state's road map out of lockdown on Sunday.</p>

<p>A leaked top secret draft for the city's exit road map earlier revealed the government's plan to extend the 8pm-5am curfew and keep restrictions on businesses for an additional two weeks.</p>

<p>The Victorian government however said the road map was 'out of date'.</p>

<p>According to the leaked documents, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage Four comes to an end.</p>

<p>The clarified exercise rule will benefit parents and carers who have altering work schedules (pictured woman walks near the Tan in Melbourne last month)</p>

<p>Outdoor personal training would be allowed for up to two people per trainer and outdoor pools will open for exercise for up to 20 people at a time.</p>
