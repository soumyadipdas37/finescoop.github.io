<p>Pep Guardiola is hoping to add a left back to his ranks before Monday's transfer deadline, a move dependent on whether Aleks Zinchenko leaves the Etihad Stadium.</p>

<p>Tagliafico is understood to be on City's radar, although they are yet to make contact with the Dutch champions.</p>

<p>Nicolas Tagliafico will cost Manchester City in the region of £23million if they wish to sign him</p>

<p>Ajax are resistant to losing a fourth senior player in the same summer but the 28-year-old is keen on a move to the Premier League.</p>

<p>Bayern Munich's David Alaba, who currently faces contract uncertainty at the Allianz Arena, is a player City have also held interest in.</p>

<p>An attacking full back, Tagliafico signed from Independiente two years ago and was impressive during Ajax's run to the Champions League semi-finals.</p>

<p>City have already spent more than £100m on defenders this summer after landing Nathan Ake from Bournemouth and Benfica's Ruben Dias. </p>

<p>Any move for the Ajax ace is dependent on whether Aleks Zinchenko leaves the club</p>
