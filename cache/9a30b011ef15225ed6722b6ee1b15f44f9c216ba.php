<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New laws aimed at protecting British troops from relentless legal witch-hunts will block soldiers' own injury claims, Labour warns today.</p>

<p>Defence spokesman John Healey said parts of a new bill amounted to 'penny-pinching' because they put a time limit on compensation claims from UK forces.</p>

<p>It means soldiers who have suffered life-changing trauma could find it more difficult to seek compensation.</p>

<p>Figures uncovered by Labour reveal the Ministry of Defence could save millions from future claims when the Overseas Operations Bill becomes law.</p>

<p>The bill, which will be debated in the Commons tomorrow, puts a five-year time limit on claims against British soldiers by insurgents or civilians.</p>

<p>Ministers hope this will end the relentless 'vexatious' legal probes that soldiers have faced for more than a decade after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>But Labour says the bill also puts a six-year deadline on compensation claims against the MoD brought by troops or their families for injuries and loss while posted overseas.</p>

<p>Defence spokesman John Healey (above) said parts of a new bill amounted to 'penny-pinching' because they put a time limit on compensation claims from UK forces</p>

<p>Labour said the bill will 'deny troops serving overseas the same employment rights as everyone they serve to defend back home'. </p>

<p>The party wants claims from troops themselves to be exempt from the time limits. </p>

<p>Mr Healey said: 'This is an 'MoD protection bill' that will block rightful claims from our own British troops when the MoD fails them. It's penny-pinching.'</p>

<p>The MoD said: 'The changes to the time limits for bringing claims are needed to stop service personnel and veterans having to repeatedly give evidence in relation to historical incidents.'</p>
