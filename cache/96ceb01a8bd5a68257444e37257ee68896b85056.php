<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A beauty salon has been slammed after putting a poster in its window denying the existence of coronavirus and telling customers they do not have to wear face masks.</p>

<p>Skin Kerr Aesthetics, Hair and Beauty, in Bootle, Merseyside, shared the notice on its Facebook page, which has since been deleted.</p>

<p>The poster, stuck to the salon window with masking tape, had bullet points saying: 'Covid Free Salon; no masks, we take cash; Covid talk is banned; you can't catch what doesn't exist.'</p>

<p>The bullet points end with '#voodoovirusisbullsh**' and '#wedonotconsent' and states 'please respect the rules of the salon'.</p>

<p>Skin Kerr Aesthetics, Hair and Beauty, in Bootle, Merseyside, shared the notice on its Facebook page, which has since been deleted</p>

<p>Under rules designed to limit the spread of the disease, hairdressers and salon staff are required to wear surgical face masks as well as clear visors.</p>

<p>Hairdressers and barbershops restarted on July 4, and from August 15 close contact beauty services, including facials and eyebrow treatments were opened.</p>

<p>Around 1,117 people have died of Covid-19 in Merseyside hospitals, with many more deaths recorded in care homes and in other community facilities.</p>

<p>Fears of a second wave are also rising after around 200 school pupils and 21 staff were told to self-isolate after positive tests at schools across the county.</p>

<p>And in the most recent seven-day period of data - August 29 to September 4 - Liverpool registered 133 new cases of the deadly virus.</p>

<p>Furious social media users slammed Skin Kerr Aesthetics for the sign online, with one branding the owner 'irresponsible'.</p>

<p>One man, who tagged police in his Twitter post, wrote: 'Can we do something about this irresponsible business owner - <?php echo e('@'); ?>skinkerr clinic please?'</p>

<p>He added: 'Merseyside already hovering just below levels to have restrictions reimposed.'</p>

<p>Another account warned people to 'avoid' the salon after seeing the sign, adding: 'Getting your hair or nails done in Liverpool?</p>

<p>The poster, stuck to the salon window with masking tape, had bullet points saying: 'Covid Free Salon; no masks, we take cash; Covid talk is banned; you can't catch what doesn't exist'</p>

<p>'Here's one to AVOID. Nice one guys! Doing a great job at flushing your biz down the toilet!'</p>

<p>A woman, who said she was the manager, said she 'did not wish to discuss' the post but claimed she had been threatened with violence.</p>

<p>Merseyside Police told MailOnline: 'Officers will be attending the salon today to speak to the staff and owner to make sure they are aware of their responsibilities.</p>

<p>'We will also be linking in with the local authority, Sefton Council.'</p>
