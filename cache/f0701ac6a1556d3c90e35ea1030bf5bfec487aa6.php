<p>Selena looked radiant in the clip, where she had flowers pinned into her curls and rocked glam from her new Rare Beauty brand.</p>

<p>The former Disney Channel star kept her outfit simple as she reminded fans to vote with her tee-shirt, though it was largely hidden behind her locks.</p>

<p>It definitely looked like Selena was making the most of her indoor time.Â </p>

<p>Trying! She hadn't exactly perfected the dance, seen shrugging while admitting 'I don't know' after going through the motions</p>

<p>So pretty:Â Selena looked radiant in the clip, where she had flowers pinned into her curls and rocked glam from her new Rare Beauty brand</p>

<p>She opened up about what she's learned about herself during quarantine while appearing on the Variety and iHeart podcast The Big Ticket last week.</p>

<p>'Itâ€™s definitely the most time Iâ€™ve spent on my own probably since I was 16,' the pop star/actress said.</p>

<p>'At first it was super uncomfortable, more so because of the anxiety I was carrying because of everything that is happening.</p>

<p>'I also feel like I got the opportunity to learn a lot about my country in ways that I never have before,' she went on.</p>

<p>Solo: In addition to learning dances at home Selena says she's been able to learn about herself while being alone. ''Itâ€™s definitely the most time Iâ€™ve spent on my own probably since I was 16,' she said in a recent interview</p>

<p>'I feel like Iâ€™ve gained a sense of knowledge and a sense of feeling good about saying what Iâ€™m saying, and I feel good about what Iâ€™m standing by, and Iâ€™m not going to let other opinions conduct what I feel personally.'</p>

<p>Gomez has been vocal about getting her generation to the polls.Â </p>

<p>In June she shared a lengthy Instagram post where she wrote about systemic racism in the US.</p>

<p>'Everyone needs to have their voices heard and we can do that by VOTING,' she wrote. 'We will not let voter suppression stop us!'Â </p>

<p>Make your voice heard! Gomez has also been encouraging young fans to vote on her social media</p>
