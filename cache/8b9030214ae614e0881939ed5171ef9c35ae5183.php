<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Barack Obama gave out his 'phone number' to the American people, asking that they send him a text. </p>

<p>'All right, let's try something new. If you're in the United States, send me a text at 773-365-9687 - I want to hear how you're doing, what's on your mind, and how you're planning on voting this year,' Obama tweeted and posted to Instagram Wednesday. </p>

<p>He also promised to write back. </p>

<p>President Barack Obama sent out his 'phone number' to the American people on Wednesday, trying to strike up a text message relationship </p>

<p>The president used Twitter (pictured) and Instagram to share the Chicago-based phone number </p>

<p>Texting the number links Americans to a service called Community, which allows community leaders to send messages to members and members can reply </p>

<p>Those that opt in to the service are also given a contact card for Barack Obama that includes a picture of the ex-president </p>

<p>'I'll be in touch from time to time to share what's on my mind, too,' Obama said.</p>

<p>The post includes a picture of Obama in a baggy button down shirt showing his cell phone to former first lady Michelle Obama, who's wearing a black and white sundress.  </p>

<p>Obama is using a technology called Community, which allows 'community leaders' to send text messages directly to 'members' who opt in to the service. </p>

<p>'Leaders are able to directly text all their members at once, reach members in a specific city, or chat with a single member one-on-one,' a press release announcing Obama's involvement said.  </p>

<p>When DailyMail.com called Obama's Chicago-based number, a voicemail picked up from the ex-Democratic president.   </p>

<p>'Hi, It's Barack Obama. Send me a text and I'll send you messages from time to time,' the message says. 'Looking forward to hearing from you,' it says, and then abruptly hangs up. </p>

<p>When texting the number, users are asked to click a link that registers them with Community's service. </p>

<p>'OK, I've got your number saved,' the next message reads. 'Good to be connected. More from me soon, but first the required legalese: Msg frequency will vary. Msg&amp;Data rates may apply. Reply HELP for help, STOP to cancel at any time.' </p>

<p>A contact card then shows up, which includes a picture of Obama, so individuals can save his 'number.' </p>

<p>The New York Times profiled Community in October 2019 several months after it launched, as a number of celebrities were using the service including Diddy, Paul McCartney and Sophia Bush. </p>

<p>Actor Ashton Kutcher is an investor.  </p>

<p>At the time, the company wasn't working with political figures.  </p>
