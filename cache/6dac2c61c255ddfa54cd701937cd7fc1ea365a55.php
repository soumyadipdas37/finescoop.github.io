<p>'Tough journey': Katie returned to social media earlier this week after taking time out to focus on her health following her surgery on her two broken feet (pictured earlier this week) </p>

<p>She added: 'I thought, "I'm never going to walk again". The doctors said they've cut off legs before after seeing injuries like mine.'</p>

<p>Katie underwent an eight-hour operation to rebuild her feet after she was 'mucking about' following a few drinks and jumped off what she thought was a 'small wall' at the Land of Legends theme park.  </p>

<p>The model revealed how she has returned to The Priory because her 'mental health' has been 'badly affected' by her injuries.  </p>
