<p>Low-key: Steve Wright, 66, wrapped up in an all-black ensemble, which he topped off with a brown flat cap, during an outing in London, on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Sat al fresco, the presenter tucked into a fresh salad, which he appeared to wash down with a glass of red. </p>

<p>At times during his pit stop, Steve decided to cover up with a face mask, and spent much time on his mobile phone.</p>

<p>After enjoying his lunch, the radio host carried large shopping bags as he strolled along the street. </p>

<p>Walking through the grey streets in a pair of casual black shoes, the Steve Wright In The Afternoon presenter looked to be lost in thought.</p>

<p>Yummy! The radio stalwart enjoyed a salad for lunch as he stopped off at a restaurant</p>

<p>What's going on? After enjoying his lunch, the radio host carried large shopping bags as he strolled along the street</p>

<p>Safety first: At times during his pit stop, Steve decided to cover up with a face mask</p>

<p>The star has previously spoken openly about his weight struggles.</p>

<p>In 2010, speaking to The Daily Mail, Steve revealed that he was on a mission to shed one-and-a-half stone in order to be more comfortable with his body shape; a goal weight of 12 or 13 stone. </p>

<p>Steve, who has been 18 stone at his peak weight, had at the time already lost the same amount of weight by cutting chips and crisps.</p>

<p>He said at the time: 'I've been eating healthily and I've lost about one-and-a-half stone. But I want to lose another stone-and-a-half at least...</p>

<p>'I'm not there yet but I'm getting there. I've cut out chips, crisps and I no longer eat chocolate.' </p>

<p>Distinguished: The BBC presenter sported a full beard and moustache</p>

<p>Simple does it: The radio host teamed plain black trousers with a button-down shirt and an oversized suit jacket</p>

<p>Keeping updated: Steve spent much time on his mobile phone</p>

<p>He also explained that he had been walking a lot around the West End, sometimes strolling a couple of miles to Regent's Park, but admitted that sitting down for his regular show had lead to his former weight gain.</p>

<p>'When you get to my age,' he added. 'You get that paunch and I also sit down all day for my work. So exercise is the key – but eating right is also important.'  </p>

<p>The star has two children, Tom, 29, and Lucy, 22, from his marriage to ex-wife Cyndi. The pair divorced in 1999. </p>

<p>The DJ joined the BBC in 1980, previously presenting the Saturday night slot and breakfast shows on Radio 1. </p>

<p>No signal? Steve held up his mobile phone as he attempted to get some signal</p>
