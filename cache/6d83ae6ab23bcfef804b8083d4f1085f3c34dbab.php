<p>No more! Ashley Darby gave her husband Michael, 59, an ultimatum. The 32-year-old star is seen telling her husband on Real Housewives Of Potomac that in the past they have had romances with other people but she doesn't want to do that anymore. The beauty then says if she finds out anything else it would be 'catastrophic for our relationship'; seen in 2018</p>

<p>He asks a producer to cut the camera. 'It's a wrap,' he said obviously tense. He then says he has been accused of all kind of 'sh*t.'  </p>

<p>Also on the episode, she confronted her husband about what she saw. </p>

<p>'I called my husband, and I said, "Get your ass home right now." He walks through the door, sits down on the couch, and he tells me what happened,' she said in an interview. </p>

<p>'I was very, very, very upset, and I realized that I don't want to be yelling with the baby being in the house. So that's why I wanted to sit down with him and really talk about it.'</p>

<p>He told his wife that he and his friends had been talking to some women at a strip club.</p>

<p>Then one of the ladies offered to go to a hotel with him.</p>

<p>'Michael said, "I was so drunk, I fell asleep, and when I woke up, she was laying in the bed next to me,"' Ashley said. 'Then when Michael gets out of bed to check the time, she snapped a picture of him from behind at the dresser and gave it to a blog.'</p>

<p>Michael then shared: 'I should have told you. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.' </p>

<p>He added, 'I worry what comes out without us discussing it, so I wanted to wait until you were back and talk about it.'</p>

<p>Parenthood: The couple are parents to son Dean, one, and expecting another baby</p>

<p>She then brings up their son, Dean. 'You did not think anything about me. I was so far from your mind in that moment. So far. And so was Dean,' she said. 'You weren't even considering either of us.'</p>

<p>He said he was being 'inconsiderate' then added that he felt he had lost his intimacy with Ashley.</p>

<p>'We're not gonna stay together just for Dean,' she told Michael. 'If I find out anything else, it will be catastrophic for our relationship.'</p>

<p>Darby was involved in an incident at a strip club in which 'this one woman kept touching him.'</p>

<p>'As far as I know, everything is well... that's why I'm shocked,' Darby, 32, said of the occurrence, just days after sharing on Instagram that they're expecting another child.</p>

<p>She opened up about a past occurrence that took place with Michael, 59, when he returned home from a strip club.</p>

<p>'One time, he did come home, smelling like perfume,' she said. 'I was upset and he was like, "I'm sorry I was at the strip club." I was pregnant and I was very sensitive.'</p>

<p>She said that after she asked him to to do it again, she presumed he 'stopped going to strip clubs.'</p>

<p>Darby said that Michael told her 'he was at a strip club' in the incident, which took place when she and their one-year-old son Dean were at co-star Monique Samuels' house for a cast trip.</p>

<p>Another co-star, Candiace Dillard, later revealed to Ashley an image of Michael at the strip club.</p>

<p>Good news: The couple announced they're expecting their second child </p>

<p>Ashley said that she and her spouse 'talked about the issue that Candiace brought up, and he told me he was at the strip club and this woman kept touching him.'</p>

<p>She said that tensions ran high and they slept in separate rooms, 'Michael slept in the baby's room and I slept in the bedroom.'</p>

<p>She said her husband 'regrets' his actions, which he didn't specify, and 'feels bad' about it.</p>

<p>Out and about: Ashley joined (L-R) Robyn Dixon, Wendy Osefo, Gizelle Bryant and Charrisse Jackson-Jordan for Bryant's birthday in Washington, DC on Saturday</p>

<p>On the show, Dillard, 33, said she'd received pictures of Michael 'in his boxers' at a hotel. Bryant, 50, told Dillard, 'I'm minding my business and I had at least 40 DMs about Michael; this is the worst!'</p>

<p>Dillard said there was now 'photographic evidence of Michael at a hotel, Michael at the strip club and Michael at MGM.'</p>

<p>The show's Karen Huger said of the image, 'Michael doing something, but it don't look like it's Ashley.'</p>

<p>Samuels, 36, said that 'in the big scheme of it all, the only person that matters right now is baby Dean.'</p>

<p>Robyn Dixon suggested that Michael show better restraint and 'go home to [his] wife.' </p>

<p>Previously, a cameraman on their reality series publicly claimed in 2018 that Michael had groped him during filming.</p>

<p>Charges of felony assault and misdemeanor improper sexual conduct were filed against him but later dropped due to a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>'When I got the news, I just froze,' Ashley said on RHOP while delving into the matter. 'It was not real that something like this was happening to my husband and I. My heart was racing, I was getting light headed. Like, this just can’t be my reality.'</p>

<p>Last year, Michael was alleged to have made a sexual comment about one of Housewives' husbands.</p>

<p>'After the night died down, Michael walked past us and said, "Yeah, I would suck his d***,''' Dixon told Ashley on the show. 'You were there. You all were walking past us.'</p>

<p>Despite one of her fellow Housewives claiming Michael said it, Ashley adamantly denied he'd made the comment. </p>

<p>The Real Housewives of Potomac can be seen on Bravo Sunday at 9/8c.</p>
