<p>Fans of the brunette beauty immediately praised her body, marvelling at how incredible she looked after having having four children.</p>

<p>'4 kids and you look like that,' one gushed, while another added 'You are the new Elle'.</p>

<p>Ambassador: Rebecca often spruiks fake tan and sunscreen products on Instagram </p>

<p>And it hasn't been without its woes.</p>

<p>Rebecca recently revealed that one of her twins can't stop saying the swear word 'bast***' around the house.</p>

<p>She made the admission on Monday during her KIIS FM radio show, The 3pm Pick Up. </p>

<p>The radio host admitted that her son picked up the term from her after she kept saying it while playing Mario Kart while in lockdown.</p>

<p>'He says it all the time. It's kind of cute, but it's so wrong,' Bec said with a laugh.</p>

<p>'My husband and I have been having some chats at home about what words warrant being a swear word or not. When I was a kid, every rude word was a swear word... even shut up,' Bec added.</p>

<p>She said her four children are watching The Simpsons a lot, so have been saying some cheeky words at home.</p>

<p>But she said Darcy can't stop saying 'bast***' after hearing her fire up while playing Mario Kart.</p>

<p>'I've been playing a lot of Mario Kart at home and since going to my friend Nicole Slater's house... she has this talking parrot that says, "oh you bast***, oh you bast***".</p>

<p>'So now when someone bumps me when playing Mario Kart I say, "oh you bast***",' Bec explained.</p>

<p>'I've got this parrot in my head! So my youngest Darcy, one of my twins, has picked up on the bast*** word and won't stop saying it!'</p>

<p>But Bec said she wasn't sure if it is a swear word or not.</p>

<p>She added that she had a conversation with Darcy recently about what being a twin was and he said he thought it was 'being a bast***'.</p>

<p>Busy! Rebecca is a mother of twins, Tom and Darcy, three, son Oscar, nine, and daughter Billie Kate, six</p>

<p>Bec's radio co-host Katie 'Monty' Dimond said she thought it was a bit full on that a three year old was swearing.</p>

<p>'As cute as that sounds, hearing bast*** coming out of a kid's mouth is pretty full on isn't it?' Monty said.</p>

<p>Rebecca and her husband Chris have been in lockdown in Melbourne with their four children, son Oscar, nine, daughter Billie, six, and twins Tom and Darcy.</p>

<p>Last month, she admitted on her radio show that she's over the stage-four restrictions and can't wait to travel interstate for a holiday.</p>

<p>It came after her twins trashed her stylish living room.</p>

<p>'I'm done... I'm out,' Bec said.</p>
