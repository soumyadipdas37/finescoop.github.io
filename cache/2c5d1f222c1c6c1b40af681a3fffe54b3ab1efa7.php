<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jonny Bairstow will be the biggest loser when England's central contracts for 2020-21 are announced on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old was among the 10 players to receive a Test contract 12 months ago, but has featured just once for his country in the longest format since then and will drop down to an ECB white-ball deal.</p>

<p>Ashley Giles, England's managing director, will announce that a dozen players have been awarded the £650,000-a-year full contracts, with Dominic Sibley expected to be included for the first time.</p>

<p>Jonny Bairstow has had a frustrating time of late and will drop down to an ECB white-ball deal </p>

<p>Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley have also been considered, along with Mark Wood, who is currently among those on the £275,000 limited-overs terms.</p>

<p>As Sportsmail revealed last month, England's leading players have avoided salary drops, despite the governing body's wide-ranging cuts in response to the Covid-hit 2020 season. The ECB have lost more than £100million.</p>

<p>The money within the Team England Player Partnership remains 'roughly the same' according to one source — reward for a summer of dedication away from families, inside England squad bubbles in Manchester and Southampton.</p>

<p>Some will see their wages bumped up, although Joe Denly is unlikely to have his white-ball terms renewed. The Kent batsman was the surprise recipient of a limited-overs contract last September after he had failed to make the final 15 for the 50-over World Cup. </p>

<p>Dominic Sibley is expected to be rewarded after impressing at the top of the Test order</p>

<p>Equally Tom Curran, a player who did, was oddly overlooked. Dawid Malan can rightly expect an upgrade from incremental terms, befitting his status as the leading Twenty20 international batsman in the ICC rankings.</p>

<p>But his new Yorkshire team-mate Dom Bess will join Jack Leach in the increment stakes — a top-up of £80,000 is applied to annual county wages — having made eight Test appearances this year.</p>

<p>Essex on Tuesday night apologised for the celebrations that soured Sunday's Bob Willis Trophy final win when one of their players, Will Buttleman, poured beer over Muslim team-mate Feroze Khushi. They had initially pledged greater cultural education for their players but stopped short of saying sorry. But captain Tom Westley said: 'On behalf of myself and the team we would like to apologise for any offence that was caused by our celebrations at Lord's.'</p>
