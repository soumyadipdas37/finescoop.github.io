<p>Palace, Aston Villa and West Ham have all shown an interest in the winger but the Eagles look set to win the race for his signature.</p>

<p>Benrahma, who is valued at £20million, formed an exciting attacking triumvirate alongside Ollie Watkins and Bryan Mbeumo but that has been broken up this summer.</p>

<p>Watkins completed a £33m switch to Villa last week and in doing so became the most expensive signing from the Championship ever.</p>

<p>Roy Hodgson's Eagles appear set to win the race to get 25-year-old's signature this summer</p>

<p>Now it looks as though Benrahma is going to join him in the English top flight by moving to Selhurst Park. Palace kick-started their new Premier League campaign with a 1-0 victory over Southampton at the weekend.</p>

<p>Palace have already brought in another talented forward in Eberechi Eze from QPR this summer and their own star winger Wilfried Zaha has been linked with a move away.</p>

<p>Brentford are pressing ahead with a move for 27-year-old Iran international midfielder Saman Ghoddos of Amiens as they look to make additions before the transfer window shuts next month.</p>
