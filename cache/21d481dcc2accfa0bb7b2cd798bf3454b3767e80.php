<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A British couple yachting in Spain recorded the moment a group of killer whales attacked their boat.</p>

<p>Graeme Walker and his wife Moira were sailing on their yacht with their friend Stephen Robinson when a trio of killer whales targeted them off the coast of Cape Finisterre.</p>

<p>BBC Scotland reports that Graeme, from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, only noticed the killer whales when one of them rammed his 45ft yacht. </p>

<p>Graeme Walker and his wife Moira were sailing on their yacht with their friend Stephen Robinson when a trio of killer whales targeted them off the coast of Cape Finisterre</p>

<p>During the 45-minute attack a 1.5sq ft bite had been taken out of the yacht's rudder. </p>

<p>Graeme said: 'I was not really sure what was happening, then one of the animals broke the surface, on the left hand side of the boat, for breath.'</p>

<p>The retired chief financial officer contacted the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre who told him to turn the engine off and keep the sail down.</p>

<p>Despite the precautionary measures, Graeme said that the killer whales caused the boat to spin 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Graeme's biggest fear was that his yacht would take water on board from the damage caused by the animals and they would have been left stranded 720 miles into a 1,600 mile journey.</p>

<p>It will now take weeks for Graeme to have his yacht repaired.</p>

<p>Graeme, from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, only noticed the killer whales when one of them rammed his 45ft yacht</p>

<p>This is the latest in a number of cases of killer whales attacking vessels off of the Spanish coast and as a result the Spanish transport ministry has banned boats of 15m or less from sailing between Cape Prioriño Grande and Estaca de Bares point in Galicia for a week.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, The Guardian reported that scientists had been left baffled by the spate of killer whale attacks.  </p>

<p>In one recent incident, Halcyon Yachts were taking a 36ft vessel to the UK from A Coruña in northern Spain when a killer whale rammed it at least 15 times. </p>

<p>The vessel lost steering and had to be towed back to port because of the attack.</p>

<p>During the 45-minute attack a 1.5sq ft bite had been taken out of the yacht's rudder</p>

<p>Around the same time a radio warning was issued after killer whales were spotted near Vigo where two other recent collisions had taken place.</p>

<p>Alfredo López, a biologist from the Coordinator for the Study of Marine Mammals in Galicia, told the paper that killer whales make their way up the Spanish-Portuguese coastline every year in September.</p>

<p>It is currently not known whether the same pod of killer whales is carrying out all of these attacks but Dr Ruth Esteban, a Gibraltar orca expert, told the paper that it is unlikely that different groups would carry out such similarly organised attacks.</p>

<p>The killer whale, or orca, is the largest member of the dolphin family with a complex diet that sees different groups of the animal eating different prey.</p>

<p>Generally killer whales are not considered to be a threat to humans. </p>
