<p>Their excursion came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a speech in the House of Commons announcing tightened coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday.</p>

<p>His announcement comes after Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the UK could hit 50,000 cases a day by mid-October and 200 plus daily deaths by November unless Britain changes course. </p>

<p>Melanie, who plays Cathy Matthews, returned to work on the Corrie set back in June, after production was halted for three months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Avoiding the mad dash: The couple were likely aiming to avoid the scramble for toilet paper that was seen nationwide back in March</p>

<p>Cast and crew over the age of 70, or with an underlying health condition, were kept at home during the early stages of production returning. </p>

<p>The new safety measures are in accordance with the recently issued TV production guidelines, which have been observed while filming the top ITV soap.</p>

<p>While the new restrictions include 10pm curfews for pubs and restaurants and people being urged to work from home where possible, it appears that filming schedules for shows will currently remain unaffected.</p>
