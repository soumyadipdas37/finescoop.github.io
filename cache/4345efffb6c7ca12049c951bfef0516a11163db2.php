<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australians have been warned not to indulge in any takeaway meals offered on Facebook Marketplace with fears the cheap food could lead to food poisoning.</p>

<p>Curries, noodles, cooked meat, desserts, rice dishes and even raw sausages are just some of the items on offer on the advertising platform with some starting at $8.</p>

<p>But the Food Safety Information Council has warned it's highly likely the home chefs aren't meeting food safety requirements.</p>

<p>Curries, noodles, cooked meat, desserts, rice dishes and even raw sausages are just some of the items on offer on Facebook Marketplace</p>

<p>Cathy Moir, chair of the health promotion charity said they became aware of the 'illegal' practice in May after noticing a string of 'high-risk' foods were being sold online.</p>

<p>'These unregulated food sales are a considerable food safety risk. There is a real risk of food poisoning, which, in its worst form can have severe health consequences,' Ms Moir said. </p>

<p>'Not only that, it is illegal. Government and local council enforcement agencies are clamping down on these unregistered food businesses, as and when they become aware of them.</p>

<p>'However, new sellers keep popping up and this is putting a considerable strain on our health services.'</p>

<p>Advertising food does not go against any rules of Facebook Marketplace which is commonly used to buy and sell clothes or furniture.</p>

<p>The Food Safety Information Council has warned it's highly likely the home chefs aren't meeting the required food safety requirements</p>

<p>Thai and Indian dishes were popular on the site along with cakes and other desserts</p>

<p>But Ms Moir said cooking at home couldn't ensure the same level of health and safety as registered businesses would have. </p>

<p>'It is unlikely that food prepared in a home kitchen or backyard BBQ would meet these standards,' she said.</p>

<p>'Another reason to be extremely wary of these illegal sellers is a risk of allergic reactions. Licensed sellers must also be aware of any labelling requirements, including the allergens in their food, so they can inform consumers.'</p>

<p>There are simple ways to spot if the food is being sold from an unlicensed seller.</p>

<p>Ms Moir said to always check whether or not they had a website or social media page for their business.</p>

<p>She also said if the food was listed at a home address and much cheaper than usual it was likely to be unregulated. </p>

<p>Another seller is seen using Facebook Marketplace to advertise their homemade fish for $40 </p>

<p>Another rice dish believed to be cooked at home is available on the platform for $12 </p>

<p>Most of the unlicensed vendors offered their meals for 'pick-up only' with prices ranging from around $8 to $35.</p>

<p>Indian and Thai dishes were extremely popular along with cakes and other desserts.</p>

<p>Some were even offering kangaroo meat for dog food while one was offering salted fish.</p>

<p>'If in doubt, don't take the risk of buying unsafe food. Support your local food businesses instead, either in store or by ordering online,' Ms Moir said.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Facebook for comment. </p>

<p>A platter of sandwiches was also spotted on sale for just $1 in Sydney </p>
