<p>Myriam Aouffir, 43, is a high-profile press officer for French television.</p>

<p>Dominique Strauss-Khan seen with his new partner Myriam Aouffir spotted at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall</p>

<p>The couple have been together only a matter of months</p>

<p>DSK and his new girlfriend have already been spotted traveling in Corsica</p>

<p>In May 2011, Strauss-Khan, 64, was arrested for assaulting a maid at the Sofitel, a midtown Manhattan hotel. Charges were later dropped but it led to revelations about the former IMF chief's sex life, in which he admitted attending swingers' parties.</p>

<p>Anne Sinclair, Strauss-Khan's former partner, confirmed she has split from her scandal-hit husband at the end of last month.</p>

<p>Ms Sinclair, 64, originally stuck by Mr Strauss-Kahn after he was embroiled in a catalogue of scandals last year.</p>

<p>What is she letting herself in for? Disgraced Strauss-Khan's wife left him after a string of sex-scandals</p>

<p>But the multi-millionaire heiress finally kicked her husband out of their Paris apartment in June, before immersing herself in a new job running an internet site in the French capital.</p>

<p>The new relationship between Strauss-Khan and Ms Aouffir has been high profile even though they have been together less than a year.</p>

<p>Like Mr Strauss-Kahn, Myriam Aouffir comes from a Moroccan background, and is also believed to be estranged from her husband, with whom she has two children.</p>

<p>Ms Aouffir, who studied at Montpellier University, has been seeing Mr Strauss-Kahn for a number of months, according to close friends of the couple.</p>
