<p>Working out: It comes after the mother-of-two, who gave birth to her daughter Gigi in July, looked sensational in a black sports bra which she teamed with a pair of leggings</p>

<p>Hard at work: Vogue showcased her fitness prowess as she practiced a series of movements including lunges and squats using a purple resistance band</p>

<p>Spencer confirmed earlier this week that he and Vogue will be having more children in the future, but only if she allows him to hire a live-in nanny.</p>

<p>During the first episode of their eponymous podcast, the former Made In Chelsea star also stressed the 'necessity' of childcare for working parents. </p>

<p>Responding to fans' queries about growing their family, Vogue confirmed: 'Yes we will be. Not yet though'.</p>

<p>The reality star then added: 'Depending on the nanny's availability and whether or not she can move in permanently. I won't do it otherwise.' </p>

<p>Fresh-faced: The Heart FM presenter wore her blonde locks swept back into a low bun, while going make-up free and covering her face with a pair of round shades</p>

<p>Vogue shared the details of their agreement as she said: 'Spenny did actually say that, that we could have four kids if I swore that we could have a live-in nanny by the time we had four kids. </p>

<p>'It's different for Irish people I think because we don't do the whole night nanny thing, and all that stuff, you don't hear about that at home, but here, you have maternity nurses, night nannies and stuff like that and we just don't have that.' </p>

<p>Spencer left his long-term partner in giggles as he joked he'd wear 'condoms every time' if she tries to have a third baby without a live-in nanny, with the blonde sarcastically replying: 'Good luck, I'd be really into that, we can start doing that right now because I'd rather not go on the pill.' </p>

<p>Family: Vogue gave birth to Gigi on July 23 with husband Spencer Matthews, 33, and the couple welcomed their first child, son Theodore in September 2018</p>
