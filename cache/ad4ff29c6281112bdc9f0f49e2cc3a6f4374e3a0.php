<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>After widespread connectivity issues with the Disney+ streaming service during its launch yesterday, the TV manufacturer Vizio has announced it’s working on an update for its SmartCast TVs that could help some users access the service.</p>

<p>The issue appears to be connected to an outdated version of software used to operate the builtin Chromecast hardware that comes with Vizio's SmartCast TVs.  </p>

<p>After a number of SmartCast TV owners complained about not being able to use Disney+ through the builtin Chromecast, Vizio began to investigate the issue.  </p>

<p>When Disney+ launched yesterday, Vizio's SmartCast TV owners were unable to access the service using the television's builtin Chromecast feature</p>

<p>In a statement to Business Insider, Vizio said the company is ‘working diligently to implement the new version of Chromecast and will start rolling out the update to our SmartCast TVs as soon as possible.’</p>

<p>‘In the meantime, customers with Vizio SmartCast TVs can use AirPlay to stream Disney+ directly from their Apple device to the TV.’</p>

<p>‘The iOS device only needs iOS 12.3 or later, or a Mac running 10.14.5 or later, and your device must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the TV.’</p>

<p>Some Twitter users speculated that Disney+ requires Chromecast version 1.36 to run, but the builtin Chromecasts on Vizio's SmartCast TV are currently operating version 1.34. </p>

<p>Vizio released a statement saying an software update for its internal Chromecast tech is being worked on and will be released 'as soon as possible'</p>

<p>While the company didn’t provide a date for when the specific Chromecast update would be ready, Vizio’s customer support says the Disney+ will be available on the SmartCast app store in 2020.</p>

<p>Disney+ is a new streaming service from that will give subscribers access to more than 500 movies and 7,500 television shows from Disney’s archives for a monthly fee of $7.</p>

<p>The app is currently supports Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, MacOS, ChromeOS, Windows PC, and other platforms.</p>

<p>Disney+ will make more than 500 movies and 7,500 television shows available for streaming for a $7 monthly fee</p>

<p>By 9AM on launch day, the service had registered at least 7,300 user problems, according to Down Detector, an outage mapping website.</p>

<p>70 percent of those issues were reported as streaming problem, 27 percent were reportedly login problems, and 3 percent were related to other issues.</p>
