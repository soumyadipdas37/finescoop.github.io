<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Home and Away star accused of putting a policewoman in a headlock and punching her repeatedly has blamed his behaviour on a brain disorder.</p>

<p>Joel McIlroy, who could face seven years in prison if convicted, wants his case dealt with under mental health provisions rather than the criminal law.</p>

<p>The Silver Logie nominee suffers from the degenerative brain condition Huntington's disease, which Downing Centre Local Court heard caused him poor impulse control.</p>

<p>McIlroy applied on Tuesday for five charges to be dealt with under Section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. </p>

<p>Magistrate Jennifer Giles was furious at the late application, which came on what was to be the first of a two-day hearing. </p>

<p>Home and Away actor Joel McIlroy has been charged with assaulting two police officers and has asked for the matters to be dealt with under mental health provisions rather than the criminal law</p>

<p> McIlroy appeared on Home and Away from 1994 to 2006, the year he was nominated for a Silver Logie as the most popular actor on Australian television. His character Flynn Saunders was married to Kate Ritchie's Sally Fletcher.  McIlroy and Ritchie are pictured together</p>

<p>McIlroy could face up to seven years behind bars if convicted of assaulting a police officer. He is pictured outside Downing Centre Local Court on Tuesday </p>

<p>Ms Giles described the move as a 'squanderous use of court resources' and a 'ridiculous waste of time'.</p>

<p>McIlroy allegedly repeatedly punched a 29-year-old senior constable during a violent scuffle in Sydney's inner-city in October, putting the officer in hospital.</p>

<p>The 47-year-old was originally charged with two counts of assaulting police, one of resisting police and one of wilfully obstructing an officer in the execution of their duty.</p>

<p>He was then additionally charged with assaulting an officer occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence which carries a maximum penalty of seven years in jail.</p>

<p>McIlroy appeared on Home and Away from 1994 to 2006, the year he was nominated for a Silver Logie as the most popular actor on Australian television.</p>

<p>His character Flynn Saunders was married to Kate Ritchie's Sally Fletcher.</p>

<p>No evidence was heard on Tuesday but parts of the police case against McIlroy have previously been aired in other courts.  </p>

<p>Central Local Court heard McIlroy 'viciously' shoulder-charged and punched the policewoman when he intervened in an arrest unrelated to him at Surry Hills on October 22.</p>

<p>Joel McIlroy is pictured leaving Downing Centre Local Court on Tuesday with his mother, with whom he has been living near Newcastle since being granted bail in February </p>

<p>The officer was only 164cm tall and weighed around 60kg, while McIlroy weighed 100kg and was almost 20cm taller.</p>

<p>The injured policewoman was taken by ambulance to St Vincent's Hospital where she spent the night being treated for soft tissue damage including bruising and swelling to her shoulder, face and neck.</p>

<p>Defence lawyer Elliot Rowe said on Tuesday there would be some dispute about what happened and that McIlroy appeared not to have understood the woman he allegedly punched was a police officer. </p>

<p>His behaviour was 'out of character', not premeditated and could be attributed to cognitive impairment caused by Huntington's disease, Mr Rowe told the court.</p>

<p>However, the court also heard McIlroy had asked a witness to the Surry Hills incident to film him being 'choked' and alleged 'police brutality'. </p>

<p> Home and Away actor Joel McIlroy, 47, allegedly punched a female senior constable multiple times as he intervened in the arrest of another man in Sydney's Surry Hills on October 22. He is pictured with fellow star Kate Ritchie, who played his wife in the long-running television series</p>

<p>On the day of the alleged assault plainclothes police from North Central Transport Action Group had a man under arrest for minor property offences.</p>

<p>McIlroy, who lived on Rutland Street where the incident occurred, allegedly approached two female officers about 11.15am but was told to leave.</p>

<p>He allegedly then shoulder-charged and punched one of the policewomen in the face several times while he had her in a headlock.</p>

<p>McIlroy was arrested with the help of a member of the public and taken to Surry Hills police station.</p>

<p>Video of McIlroy's arrest allegedly showed him yelling during the struggle: 'I can't breathe' and 'get your hand off my face.'</p>

<p>Police prosecutor Senior Sergeant Amin Assaad said the Surry Hills incident occurred after McIlroy 'stuck his nose in where it doesn't belong'. </p>

<p>He said McIlroy had also been involved in two other incidents, one in a church and one on a train, before the alleged Surry Hills assaults.</p>

<p>The policewoman allegedly assaulted by McIlroy needed physiotherapy for soft tissue damage, a court has heard. McIlroy is pictured with singer and actress Tammin Sursok </p>

<p>'At some stage Mr McIlroy needs to be held accountable for his actions and members of the community need to be protected,' Senior Sergeant Assaad told the court.</p>

<p>Ms Giles asked how the community could be safe with McIlroy 'wandering around' and 'buying into things that don't concern him' then turning violent. </p>

<p>Mr Rowe said his client had not come to police attention since the alleged assaults and his arrest and detention had come as a 'wake-up call'.</p>

<p>The court heard McIlroy's brain condition was so severe a psychiatrist had advised he should not give evidence in his own defence.  </p>

<p>After his arrest McIlroy had spent 103 nights in custody and since being granted bail had been undergoing treatment including taking medication for depression. </p>

<p>In February the Supreme Court heard McIlroy had initially been reluctant to take medication after being diagnosed with Huntington's disease.</p>

<p>The disease had already claimed the life of McIlroy's father. </p>

<p>Joel McIlroy was granted bail in the NSW Supreme Court in February after telling a judge he would take medication for the degenerative brain condition Huntington's disease. He is pictured far right with his one-time Home and Away screen wife played by Kate Ritchie</p>

<p>Justice Peter Hamill granted McIlroy bail on conditions including that he lives with his mother and her husband at Belmont, near Newcastle.</p>

<p>He had to agree to ongoing treatment and taking medication, reporting to police three times a week and not contacting the two officers involved in the Surry Hills incident.</p>

<p>McIlroy also appeared in television series Water Rats, All Saints, and Heartbreak High. </p>

<p>Ms Giles will make a decision on the Section 32 application on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>Huntington's disease is caused by the inheritance of an altered gene. </p>

<p>The death of brain cells in certain areas of the brain results in a gradual loss of cognitive, physical and emotional function. </p>

<p>Huntington's disease is a complex and severely debilitating disease, for which there is no cure.</p>

<p>The most common symptom is jerky movements of the arms and legs, known as 'chorea'. </p>

<p>Chorea usually starts as mild twitching and gradually increases over the years. </p>

<p>A person with Huntington's disease may also have difficulties with speech, swallowing and concentration.</p>

<p>Someone with Huntington's disease may live for 15 to 25 years after developing the first symptoms.</p>
