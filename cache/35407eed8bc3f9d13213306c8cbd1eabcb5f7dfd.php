<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Some Bachelor fans are convinced Locky Gilbert and Irena Srbinovska won't last as a couple based on their body language during media interviews on Friday.</p>

<p>Following Thursday night's finale, the pair stopped by The Kyle and Jackie O Show and posed for a selfie with hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson.</p>

<p>The seemingly innocent photo, which shows Irena slinging an arm around her boyfriend's shoulders as they smile for the camera, has been closely analysed online - and some naysayers believe it's 'proof' the pair are heading for a break-up.</p>

<p>Courting critics: Cynical Bachelor fans have claimed Locky Gilbert and Irena Srbinovska (both at front) won't last as a couple based on their body language in an Instagram photo on Friday. Pictured with radio hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson</p>

<p>'Classic example of "Fake it til you make it"!' one cynical viewer commented.</p>

<p>Another suggested the couple looked more like friends, saying: 'It looks more like a mate the way she put an arm around his shoulder'.</p>

<p>A third wrote: 'You need to get that body language person on this photo looks awkward... she's leaning into him and has her arm around him and he doesn't look that into her.'</p>

<p>Perfect match: Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Friday, Matchsmith body language expert Holly Bartter insisted the new couple are well suited</p>

<p>Not going to last: While they appeared happy, some fans claimed the photo was evidence they would soon split</p>

<p>But an actual body language expert told Daily Mail Australia on Friday afternoon that Locky and Irena's physical cues actual point to a happy and long-lasting relationship.</p>

<p>Holly Bartter guru and Matchsmith founder Holly Bartter analysed footage of the pair in the KIIS FM studio and concluded they 'look really in sync'. </p>

<p>The fact their arms were folded at the start of the chat - which is usually a sign of conflict - was most likely just them feeling nervous about the interview, she said. </p>

<p>'Locky looks at Irena as she responds, a bit in awe of her, they sit close but not all over each other,' Ms Bartter explained. </p>

<p>'Irena seems very self-assured, lots of touching of the hands and leaning into one another without being all over each other, and lots of smiling at one another.'</p>

<p>Bartter said they 'seem well-matched and connected', and said that Locky appeared 'head over heels and smitten' with Irena. </p>

<p>'They seem content with one another, and it looks like he's made the right decision,' said body language expert Holly Bartter</p>

<p>'They seem content with one another, and it looks like he's made the right decision,' she observed. </p>

<p>'Irena is level-headed and consistent for him. She knows what she wants, and her confidence brings out the confidence and certainty in him further.'</p>

<p>A conflicted Locky chose Irena as his winning contestant during The Bachelor's emotional finale on Thursday.</p>

<p>'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told her.</p>

<p>Moments earlier, he'd delivered the bad news to runner-up Bella Varelis - despite having told her earlier in the episode he was 'falling in love' with her.</p>
