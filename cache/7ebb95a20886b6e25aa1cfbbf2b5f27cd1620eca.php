<p>Reddy was a pioneer behind the women's rights movement of the 1970s, and her passing comes just months after film I Am Woman depicted the wondrous changes she made throughout her career.</p>

<p>The film follows the early days of Helen's music career, shortly after she moved to America in the 1970s, in the middle of the women's rights movement.</p>

<p>Her hit song, I Am Woman, became an anthem for the movement, but it wasn't without some hardships, with Helen having to convince record executives of its value.</p>

<p>She also had to fight for fair pay, after learning her all-male band was earning more money than she was. </p>

<p>The biopic features the time Reddy famously won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal, where she stated in her acceptance speech: 'I'd like to thank God, because she makes everything possible'.</p>

<p>I Am Woman is available to stream on Stan</p>
