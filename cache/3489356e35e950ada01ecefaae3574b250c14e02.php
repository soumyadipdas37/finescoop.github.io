<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother struggling to find her autistic son's favourite has been 'blown away' after the company dropped a free box of their products to her home. </p>

<p>Leanne Page, 40, from Morayfield, north of Brisbane, went to her local Woolworths store earlier this month to discover they were out of Keith's Foods Mini Dagwood Dogs. </p>

<p>When she was unable to find them in any nearby stores, she reached out to the Gold Coast-based company to ask if they had discontinued the range, which is the only thing her son Tyler, three, will eat.  </p>

<p>'I asked where I could buy them, I got put onto Karen who told me I could get them an hour-and-a-half away,' Ms Page told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>Leanne Page, 40, struggled to get her son Tyler (pictured), three to eat until she found Keith Foods' Mini Dagwood Dogs</p>

<p>'Next thing I know she has turned up at my door. Keith's Foods gave it to me for nothing. </p>

<p>'It is the only thing my son eats. He hasn't eaten in the past two years.'</p>

<p>'I was blown away.'</p>

<p>Karen explained the shortage was due to Keith's Foods, which specialises in crumbed products, experiencing difficulties sourcing key ingredients amid the pandemic. </p>

<p>Four days after making the hour-and-a-half drive to personally deliver the 30-pack box, Karen called Ms Page to tell her she would never have to worry about running out again. </p>

<p>After reaching out to the company, Keith's Foods representative Karen (left) drove to Ms Page's (right)  Morayfield home to deliver a free 30-pack box </p>

<p>Ms Page shared her experience in Facebook group The Kindness Pandemic with a photo of her gift to Karen and a card for the Keith's Foods team</p>

<p>'She spoke to her boss and they have decided that for however long my son eats these products they would supply us with 150 free when I contact them,'  Ms Page said. </p>

<p>Karen returned days later with another delivery and was gifted with flowers and a card to say thank you to the team for 'going above and beyond'.</p>

<p>The mother-of-three said the kind act has had 'an amazing impact' on her family.</p>

<p>'I can't thank them enough, they have done so much for me.'</p>

<p>'Tyler was overwhelmed, he got more hot dogs so he was good!</p>

<p>Keith's Foods specialises in crumbed products</p>

<p>'As long as he gets his mini hotdogs on his plate every night he is happy.'  </p>

<p>Ms Page shared her experience with the family owned business in Facebook group The Kindness Pandemic, which has since garnered more than 6000 positive reactions.</p>

<p>'Now that’s awesome customer service!' one person wrote.</p>

<p>Another comment read: ' This is amazing. Why can't more people be like this?'</p>

<p>The Australian operated business, founded in 1976, said they have also been bombarded with personal messages praising the heartwarming gesture. </p>

<p>'It has been an amazing response and not something we expected,' a Keith's Foods spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'We do stuff like this often, we work with a lot of charitable organisations through our distributors and donate directly to local church groups.' </p>

<p>'We did not realise doing something like sending out Dagwood dogs to a mum and her boy would give us this sort of reaction.'  </p>

<p>'We are going to supply Ms Page constantly so her son will always be in constant supply.' </p>
