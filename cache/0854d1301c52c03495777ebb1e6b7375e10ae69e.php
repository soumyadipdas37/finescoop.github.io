<p>The brunette beauty appeared shocked when she was told that Ray had talked about the possibility of them working things out.</p>

<p>'He said that?' Princess asked, adding, 'He didn't say that to me!'</p>

<p>When asked if she was open to counselling like Ray was, Princess responded it's 'a little too late'. </p>

<p>Too little too late: Princess said it's 'a little too late' to get therapy to save the marriage</p>

<p>Mom's night out: The designer enjoyed some time with her girlfriends on Thursday</p>

<p>Opening up about his marriage troubles, Ray, 39, told the hosts of The Real in a video chat on Monday, 'When you're in your own relationship, sometimes, you know, sometimes you do things spontaneously, sometimes you move too fast, sometimes you make mistakes, you know what I mean?' </p>

<p>He added, 'And so ... I'm not saying that that's what I did, or that I made a mistake, but I don't know if I did make a mistake. I don't know.' </p>

<p>Ray J added: 'I have every right to just not know and still just try to figure it out.'</p>

<p>Host Jeannie Mai confronted the One Wish hitmaker about 'refusing to go to marriage counseling' with Princess and encouraged him to explain his reasoning behind the refusal.</p>

<p>'I just felt like the counseling was more so a hustle and it wasn't good ... I felt like it would get one-sided,' he stated, before suddenly shifting his opinion on the matter. 'But, hey, maybe we do need counseling.'</p>

<p>He said that? The brunette beauty appeared shocked when she was told that Ray had talked about the possibility of them working things out</p>

<p>Ray added that he had been spending lots of time at the house with his family and called what he and Princess have 'a good thing'.</p>

<p>'It was just a good vibe, it really was. I just have to fall back and go, damn, this is a really, really good thing.' </p>

<p>Of counselling he said, 'I would be up for it. I'd be up for whatever it is to make sure my kids have a strong foundation and have both their parents in their lives 24/7,' </p>

<p>He continued: 'I don't see myself splitting the time, it's so tough to not be with your kids all of your time.'</p>

<p>With counseling officially on the table, host Loni Love asked Ray J, born William Ray Norwood Jr., to explain 'the problem' with him and Princess Love's relationship.</p>

<p>'Sometimes you move too fast, sometimes you make mistakes,' Ray J told The Real on Monday</p>

<p>Of counselling he said, 'I would be up for it. I'd be up for whatever it is to make sure my kids have a strong foundation and have both their parents in their lives 24/7,'</p>

<p>'It's not about unhappiness, sometimes we don't see eye to eye and it maybe gets too explosive and sometimes we might move too fast. Sometimes we might not move too fast.'</p>

<p>Ray, who enlisted celebrity lawyer Laura Wasser for proceedings, filed for dissolution of marriage in Los Angeles County Court on Monday, September 14. </p>

<p>In the filing, the I Hit It First singer claimed he and Princess Love had a prenuptial agreement that he wants enforced, which details prior-agreed support and personal property which is not part of the marriage.</p>

<p>Back in May, Princess had filed for divorce from the singer, before seemingly having a change of heart and requesting to dismiss the filing on July 8.</p>

<p>Princess had sought full legal and physical custody of their two kids along with child support.</p>
