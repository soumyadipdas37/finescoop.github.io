<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Michael Keane has committed his future to Everton by signing a new five-year deal with the Toffees. </p>

<p>The centre-back will remain at Goodison Park until at least 2025 following some promising performances for Carlo Ancelotti's side after lockdown. </p>

<p>It has been a good week for the 27-year-old, who was recalled to Gareth Southgate's England squad this week for the September international fixtures against Iceland and Denmark. </p>

<p>Defender Michael Keane (above)  has signed a new five-year contract at Everton until 2025</p>

<p>He told the Everton official website: 'I want to keep improving and keep learning. My best years are definitely ahead of me.</p>

<p>'I'm working on things every day...striving to get better in every part of my game and, hopefully, I can show that.'</p>

<p>Keane has also called on manager Ancelotti and his team-mates to start producing more positive results in the Premier League. </p>

<p>The centre-back featured 31 times for Everton in the Premier League last season, scoring twice</p>

<p>The Toffees had a mixed second-half to the season following the Italian manager's appointment at Goodison Park in December and ended up finishing in 12th place.</p>

<p>The defender added: 'As a team we have to look to achieve something and push for a trophy. It is not easy but it is something we have to aim for.</p>

<p>'The Club has been investing in the team and it is time we started producing results on the pitch.</p>

<p>Keane called on his team and manager Carlo Ancelotti (above) to get into Europe this season</p>

<p>Keane (right) was also called back into Gareth Southgate (left)'s England squad this week</p>

<p>'We want to finish higher in the table than we did last year and get into Europe. And if we can win a cup that would be brilliant.</p>

<p>'It is always helpful when you feel you have a good relationship with your managers and can speak to them about anything, whether it is football or something else.' </p>

<p>Keane arrived at Everton from Burnley in a £30million deal and has gone on to make 107 appearances in all competitions for the Toffees, while he has also been capped 10 times by his country.</p>
