<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>No defects were identified during a mechanical inspection of a helicopter the day before it crashed in Broome, killing a well-known West Australian pilot and a 12-year-old girl.</p>

<p>The finding is made in a preliminary report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau into the July 4 crash which killed prominent businessman Troy Thomas, 40, and 12-year-old Amber, whose family has requested her surname not be published.</p>

<p>Mr Thomas's daughter Mia and teacher's aide Maddy Down, 24, were also seriously injured.</p>

<p>No defects were identified during a mechanical inspection of a helicopter (wreckage pictured) the day before it crashed in Broome </p>

<p>Popular pilot Troy Thomas, 40, and Amber, 12, were killed in the crash</p>

<p>The group had been setting off on a scenic flight on the Robinson R44 helicopter from an industrial property when it broke apart and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Witnesses described hearing a bang as the helicopter reached about 55 feet (17 metres) .</p>

<p>Preliminary investigations revealed Mr Thomas and another pilot had reported feeling unusual vibrations through the tail rotor pedals several days earlier - a sensation Mr Thomas likened to having his feet tapped by spoons.</p>

<p>A report published on Wednesday reveals the helicopter was inspected the day before the crash by a maintenance engineer and no defects were found.</p>

<p>The dynamic balance of the tail rotor was also found to be within limits, and when a maintenance pilot started the helicopter, they could not feel any vibration.</p>

<p>A test flight was not undertaken because of the confined nature of the yard and concerns with securing the site.</p>

<p>Mr Thomas, 40, (pictured) was killed in the crash on July 4 </p>

<p>Mr Thomas was told about the findings and instructed to conduct a check flight.</p>

<p>ATSB transport safety director Mike Walker said the R44 pilot's handbook advised that a change in the sound or vibration of a helicopter could indicate an impending critical failure.</p>

<p>'It is not clear whether the pilot experienced any vibrations through the pedals at the time of the accident flight,' Dr Walker said.</p>

<p>'Nevertheless, the ATSB urges any R44 pilot who experiences unusual vibrations through the tail rotor pedals to land as soon as possible and follow the advice in the pilot's operating handbook.'</p>

<p>Investigations are continuing, including further analysis of CCTV footage.</p>

<p>Several major components of the R44 have been taken to the ATSB's technical facilities in Canberra for further analysis.</p>

<p>A 3D X-ray of the tail rotor gearbox found no evidence of internal damage.</p>

<p>'The ATSB will continue to extensively examine and analyse the recovered components as it seeks to determine the contributing factors behind the in-flight break-up,' Dr Walker said.</p>
