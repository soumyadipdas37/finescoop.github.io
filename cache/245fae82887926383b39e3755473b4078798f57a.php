<p>ON November 17, 2010, we said Seymour Pierce Ltd had talks with rival firms regarding possible merger discussions following concerns over its capital position.</p>

<p>We now accept the investment bank has at all times maintained a regulatory capital position well in excess of its minimum requirement and has not been in any discussions with rival firms about a merger or seeking a partner.</p>

<p>We apologise and are happy to set the record straight.</p>
