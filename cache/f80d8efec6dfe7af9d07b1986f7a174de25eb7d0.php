<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A family of eight have opened up about the horrifying moment their boat sank in the middle of the ocean during a camping trip.</p>

<p>A six-month old baby was on board when the boat started taking on water about 77km east of Yeppoon in Central Queensland.  </p>

<p>The family were forced to flee into a raft where they spent an hour and a half clinging on for life as they waited to be rescued.</p>

<p>'The partner’s not real keen on getting in the boat any time soon,' he told 7NEWS.</p>

<p>A family of eight spent an hour and a half clinging on for life after their boat sank in the middle of the ocean</p>

<p>The group were heading out to camp for six days when problems struck.</p>

<p>The father-of-three said they heard a thud and then the boat started sinking, and they still have no idea what went wrong.</p>

<p>As water began squirting onto the deck the group acted fast, putting on life jackets and inflating an emergency life raft.</p>

<p>They also activated a personal locator beacon which sent rescue crews their GPS coordinates for their rescue.  </p>

<p>The three children were then placed onto the raft with Mr Nugent's partner while a number of the adults were forced to cling to the side or stay afloat on the sinking boat.  </p>

<p>Despite the ordeal the baby only cried for about five minutes before settling down to sleep after being given a bottle. </p>

<p>Footage captured by one of the family members shows the family remained calm and collected despite the risk to their lives. </p>

<p>Their beer supplies also went down with the sinking vessel, much to the dismay of the adults on board. </p>

<p>Australian Maritime Safety Authority sent a crew of two helicopters and several boats to rescue the family after midday</p>

<p>'Here we are being rescued, 80km down, 80km out. The boat sank. There is a helicopter,' a man is overheard saying. </p>

<p>'Everyone is safe. And we lost all the beer.'</p>

<p>Australian Maritime Safety Authority sent a crew of two helicopters and several boats to rescue the family after midday.</p>

<p>After confirming all were in good health, they transferred the crew to a Water police vessel and returned them to shore.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr Nugent said it could have been a very different story if they hadn't been so well prepared.</p>

<p>'If we didn't have any of that (safety equipment), we'd still be out there floating on the water,' he said. </p>
