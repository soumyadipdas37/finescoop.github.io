<p>HOT</p>

<p>Daniel Levy</p>

<p>What an interesting and infuriating character. He’s a builder, he’s a miser, he’s a pitbull and he’s a poodle (around Jose Mourinho). Truly, a riddle. </p>

<p>But then he hands over all that cash to bring Gareth Bale back. And maybe, if only for a while, we can all be a little happy about that.</p>

<p>Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy deserves much credit for the loan signing of Gareth Bale</p>

<p>Dominic Thiem</p>

<p>We should resist framing the US Open champion in the context of tennis’s new wave — at 27, he’s older than Bjorn Borg was when he retired. But if Andy Murray taught us anything then it’s the beauty of persistence. </p>

<p>Thiem winning a Slam after losing three finals was simply delightful.</p>

<p>Maxwell and Carey</p>

<p>At 73-5, Australia were done. And then they weren’t. Chasing England’s 303 on Wednesday, Glenn Maxwell hit 108 from 90 balls and Alex Carey went for a stroll with 106 off 114. </p>

<p>Australia won with two balls left and took the series; England’s cricketers lost, but once more offered an excellent distraction at a weird time.</p>

<p>Australia's Glenn Maxwell produced an excellent performance as he hit 108 from 90 balls</p>

<p>NOT</p>

<p>Tour de France</p>

<p>Some sports are dangerous and it adds to the flavour. But some dangers are more unnecessary than others. </p>

<p>So what to make of stage 13, when Romain Bardet crashed and was obviously dazed when he resumed racing? His claim that he suffered a ‘small haemorrhage’ on his brain makes you wonder if cycling’s concussion protocol is what it should be.</p>

<p>Kevin Kisner</p>

<p>After the retired NBA player Rex Chapman tweeted that his child tested positive for Covid, and that his parents had been in hospital, the US golfer tweeted: ‘Guess they can’t follow the guidelines.’ </p>

<p>He later apologised for his ‘reckless’ comment. In the same spirit of recklessness, Sportsmail felt Kisner’s six over par opening-round at the US Open was hilarious.</p>

<p>Athletics</p>

<p>The prison sentence given to the ex-head of World Athletics, Lamine Diack, on corruption charges brings home how rotten things have been in the sport. </p>

<p>That he accepted money to protect Russian drugs cheats ranks among the worst of sporting betrayals.</p>
