<p>Twitter users have revealed their 'awfully British bedtime routines' in a viral thread. One person admitted: 'Going upstairs... looking forward to the freshly washed bedding you did earlier and realising you've not put it back on yet'</p>

<p>Using the hashtag #awfullybritishbedtimeroutines, another said (above): 'I let Tom Hardy read me a bedtime story.' The popular actor has previously featured on CBeebies Bedtime Stories</p>

<p>One British man explained that most people in the UK will check the doors multiple times and will only be satisfied that they're locked with a 'gentle shake of the handles'</p>

<p>One husband suggested most couples will turn to their partner and say: 'He'll never sell any ice creams at that speed' after hearing a fire engine go past their bedroom windows</p>

<p>This person said: 'Slapping your knees and saying "right, better go to bed then"' before staying up for a further two hours featured heavily in their bedtime routines</p>

<p>Trying to avoid having to switch off everything and let the pets out also featured many times on the Twitter thread today (above)</p>

<p>This post explained how most Britons promise not to binge more Netflix episodes when heading to bed, but more often than not, fail completely at keeping their pledge</p>

<p>Even once we've double checked the door is locked, some people will still head to bed wondering whether it's bolted</p>

<p>'Checking to see what colour bins the neighbours have put out then doing the same,' wrote one Briton when responding to the viral thread</p>

<p>This woman suggested that a lot of Britons would work out exactly how many hours and minutes sleep they would get if they went to sleep right then</p>

<p>This person admitted that they often went to bed frustrated after thinking about better responses to use during arguments</p>
