<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Watford are in talks over a move for former Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Sam Hutchinson.</p>

<p>The versatile 31-year-old is a free agent after his contract ran out at Hillsborough at the end of last season.</p>

<p>Hutchinson, who started his career at Chelsea, was hugely popular with supporters at Wednesday where he enjoyed a six year spell. </p>

<p>Sam Hutchinson is currently a free agent after leaving Sheffield Wednesday this summer</p>

<p>The 31-year-old, who started his career at Chelsea, is in talks about moving to Watford</p>

<p>He was a key figure in Wednesday reaching back-to-back play-offs under Carlos Carvalhal.</p>

<p>The midfielder also made 133 league appearances but was not offered a new deal as manager Garry Monk looked to bring down the age of his squad.</p>

<p>Hutchinson started out at centre back and also figured at right back before re-inventing himself as a defensive midfielder.</p>

<p>Watford have been talking to Swansea City about a move for their captain Matt Grimes and saw defensive target Alfie Mawson of Fulham join Bristol City on loan this week.</p>
