<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Google worker has been in hospital fighting for his life for months after he was told the broken arm he had been admitted for was actually blood cancer.  </p>

<p>James McGill, 33, who works as a senior account manager at Google, was admitted to hospital after seeking help for his broken arm which was not healing properly around December. </p>

<p>McGill, who works for Google's media team in Dublin, Ireland, broke his arm a couple years before but started having further complications in December. He began to trip up more frequently and realised he was losing power in his left leg. </p>

<p>He also began to lose the ability to swallow or drink. </p>

<p>Thirty-three-year old Google manager James McGill from Dublin found out he had brain cancer after his arm, which he had broken a couple of years ago, had failed to heal properly </p>

<p>Pictured: McGill before he discovered he had brain cancer after seeking help from doctors with a broken arm</p>

<p>McGill, pictured, worked as a senior account manager for Google before discovering his terrible illness</p>

<p>After an MRI scan in January, McGill was told that he had a lesion on his brain, which later diagnosed as lymphoma of the brain. </p>

<p>The 33-year-old dropped in weight to just 81lb in May and was given between a day or two days to live by consultants. </p>

<p>In a bid to raise £100,000 to make his home liveable for his condition, McGill's friends set up a GoFundMe page. </p>

<p>Telling his story, McGill said: 'I broke my arm a couple of years ago, but it never seemed to heal properly.</p>

<p>'I slowly started to lose movement in it so went to see a few consultants, but they didn't really have an answer.</p>

<p>'Last December I slowly started to lose power in my left leg and found myself tripping up a lot. So I booked myself in for an MRI scan and they found a lesion on my brain.'</p>

<p>McGill went on to describe the moment he was told the devastating news at his parent's house. </p>

<p>'I took the call and just broke down in my dad's arms when I told him what it was,' he said.  </p>

<p>'It wasn't long after that when I lost the ability to swallow or drink.</p>

<p>'They did an operation to find out what it was, and it turned out to be lymphoma. I've been bed-bound ever since.'</p>

<p>Due to coronavirus lockdown, McGill's the only visitors allowed to see him while in hospital were his parents.  </p>

<p>He said: 'I couldn't even tell them in person because they weren't allowed in that day. I had to tell them on FaceTime.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old dropped in weight to just 81lb in May and was given between a day or two days to live by consultants</p>

<p>'By May I was drastically underweight – I had gone from 60kg (132lb) to 37kg (81lb) in the space of a few months.</p>

<p>'At one point the doctors said I had 24 hours to live – but I didn't know anything about it. I was hallucinating that I was having dinner with Kim Kardashian in London.</p>

<p>'Somehow I managed to pull through, and I think I'm slowly getting a bit better.</p>

<p>'I had multiple rounds of chemo which was a huge battle on the body and mind. Each time I fought hard. The medical team here in Beaumont have been amazing.</p>

<p> 'I now want to get home for Christmas. That's the target. After where I was, it would mean everything if I could do it.</p>

<p>'The house needs loads of adjustments to make it livable. I'll need hoists on the ceiling, extensions downstairs, it'll be a lot of work.</p>

<p>'My friends set up the GoFundMe to get me some presents because they knew I was miserable and I had told them I didn't like the hospital towels.</p>

<p>'It's overwhelming to see how much money has been raised so far. It's really given me a boost over the past few days because it shows how many people are in my corner.'              </p>
