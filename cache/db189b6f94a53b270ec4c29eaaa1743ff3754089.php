<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer praised the influence of Juan Mata after the Spaniard starred in Manchester United's Carabao Cup win at Brighton.</p>

<p>The visitors ran out 3-0 winners as the 32-year-old Mata laid on Scott McTominay's header before tucking away his 50th goal for the club, with Paul Pogba's deflected free-kick wrapping up the victory.</p>

<p>There was nowhere near the drama of United's last-gasp Premier League win here at the Amex Stadium four days ago, with a combined 19 changes across both sides.</p>

<p>Juan Mata put in a man of the match performance in Manchester United's win at Brighton</p>

<p>In a first half of little chances, Mata won a free-kick before dusting himself off to cross for McTominay to head United in front.</p>

<p>He then doubled the lead himself, having also scored in the win at Luton in the previous round.</p>

<p>'His composure and experience (is vital) for a young team,' Solskjaer said of the former Chelsea midfielder, who was captain for the night.</p>

<p>The midfielder was crucial for United's first goal in a 3-0 win having been fouled</p>

<p>His resulting free-kick was headed home by team-mate Scott McTominay before the break</p>

<p>'I think he created more or less every moment in this game that was of the highest quality in an attacking sense.</p>

<p>'He is a very valuable member of the squad and a top professional. It is never easy to tell him when he's not playing.</p>

<p>'He has had a fantastic career, he has won whatever there is to win more or less.</p>

<p>'He is an example for everyone to look at, how you conduct yourself and how you perform when you get the chance.'</p>

<p>United moved into the last eight following the win as Solskjaer looks for his first piece of silverware as boss.</p>

<p>The Spaniard then doubled United's lead in the second half with a cool finish at the Amex</p>

<p>Mata celebrates his goal which gave United a 2-0 lead in the Carabao Cup fourth round tie</p>

<p>The Red Devils reached the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, FA Cup and Europa League last season and the Norwegian believes those near misses will help his players this year.</p>

<p>'Definitely,' he replied when asked if it will add drive to his squad.</p>

<p>'We are already now in the quarter-finals and of course depending on the situation in December we are going to want to go through to the semis again. The semi-final defeats, of course they hurt.'</p>

<p>The 32-year-old controlled the game in midfield leaving manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer purring</p>

<p>Solskjaer will now hope his side can kick on having reached the quarter-finals of the cup</p>

<p>Brighton boss Graham Potter felt the scoreline was harsh on his players after what he thought was an even contest.</p>

<p>'I thought it was quite an even first half,' he said.</p>

<p>'We were in the game but then really disappointed with the goal we concede before half-time. In the end 3-0 looks a tough scoreline but I think it was a competitive game from our perspective.</p>

<p>'They bring on Pogba and (Marcus) Rashford and it becomes a little more complicated for you. I thought we competed and had some good moments, I've no problem with that and the spirit of the players.'</p>
