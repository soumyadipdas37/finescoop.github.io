<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This Morning's Dr Zoe Williams shocked viewers today by revealing the Singapore Grip is a technique used by women to tighten their vagina during sex. </p>

<p>Actor David Morrissey, 56, joined Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby to discuss his period drama of the same name, which has been adapted from the J.G. Farrell novel and follows a British family living in Singapore in the 1940s as their son gets caught in a love triangle. </p>

<p>However, Phil and Holly couldn't help but mention another meaning of 'Singapore Grip,' eventually showing a clip from Dr Zoe Williams where she explained that the term 'Singapore Grip' referred to a sexual act. </p>

<p>Many of those watching were surprised the show mentioned the cheeky definition, with some complaining it was too early for the X-rated chat.</p>

<p>Dr Zoe Williams left viewers shocked on This Morning when she gave an X-rated definition of the term 'Singapore Grip'</p>

<p>After the two hosts tried to egg David on to give the explanation himself, the actor deflated, saying he thought it related to an economic term. </p>

<p>However a stone-faced Dr Zoe told viewers: 'The Singapore grip is a sexual technique which involves the woman using her vaginal muscles to stimulate a man's penis during intercourse while they remain stationary.'</p>

<p>Her intervention left Phil and Holly, who had said explaining the term was 'their duty' in stitches. </p>

<p>Meanwhile David, who plays the central character in the ITV drama, joked: 'Is that in episode three?' </p>

<p>Presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were left in stitches during their interview with actor David Morrissey, who plays Walter Blackett in the ITV adaptation of the J.G. Farrell novel </p>

<p>'It is perfect Sunday night viewing,' Holly offered cheekily. </p>

<p>'Well that should get our viewers numbers up nothing will,' David added with a laugh.  </p>

<p>And the actor was not the only one who didn't know about the term, with many viewers revealing their shock on Twitter, with one saying: 'The Singapore Grip' was named after a sexual technique?!' </p>

<p>'Oh my god! Did they just do that?' added another. </p>

<p>'Well you learn something new everyday,' a third said.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Many of those watching at home were left shocked after the definition was shared live on the morning talk show </p>

<p>However, some thought Dr Zoe's interview was perhaps a bit too raunchy for a morning show, with one writing: 'That went a bit x-rated.' </p>

<p>'Call me a prude but discussing sexual matters at 10.45am on #thismorning is inappropriate,' another said.</p>

<p>The Singapore Grip series, which is currently airing on ITV on Sunday nights, is adapted from the novel by J.G. Farrell, published in 1978.</p>

<p>It is a satirical work on the start of World War II and Japans's entry into the conflict by invading South East Asia occupying Singapore. </p>

<p>It follows in the footsteps of Downton Abbey and The Durrells as ITV's new six-part period drama - but The Singapore Grip  has so far failed to win over viewers. Pictured, the Blackett family and guests appearing shocked by their evening entertainment</p>

<p>However, the story focuses on a wealthy British family living in the area and their son, who gets caught into a love triangle. </p>

<p>In the novel, the term 'Singapore grip' is a running joke, as naive Matthew Webb doesn't know it describes a sexual act and uses in a variety of other ways, to describe a type of greeting or a bag. </p>

<p>The series has been widely panned by viewers, with audiences at home 'switching off' and complaining about the 'bizarre' storyline - after the first episode shifted timelines from before and during the Second World War's Battle of Singapore. </p>
