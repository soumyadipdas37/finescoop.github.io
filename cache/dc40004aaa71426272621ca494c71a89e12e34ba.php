<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A man has told how his wife confessed to planning her 'surprise' pregnancy that saved their relationship - and later admitted she doesn't enjoy being a mother to their three-year-old son. </p>

<p>The 39-year-old, believed to be from the US, took to Reddit explaining that he had been in a relationship with his now wife for three years in 2018 when he decided that they should go their separate ways.</p>

<p>He said less than a month after their split, his wife contacted him to say she had fallen pregnant and they agreed to stay together for the sake of their child. Their son was born in 2018 and the couple married last year. </p>

<p>However it recently emerged that the seemingly 'surprise' pregnancy had been a ploy by his now wife to keep them together.  </p>

<p>An anonymous man, believed to be from the US, has sparked a debate about how to react to discovering your partner got pregnant to save the relationship (file image)</p>

<p>The 39-year-old man explained that his wife confessed to lying about her pregnancy when he bought up the possibility of having more children </p>

<p>The father discovered the truth after he started a conversation about having more children and his wife said she doesn't want more and admitted she didn't 'enjoy' having their son around. </p>

<p>He explained: 'He continued: 'After dismissing me for several days, tonight my wife admitted that she actually planned her pregnancy with our son but that she didn't really want the baby at all, she just wanted to keep me around/knew that if she was pregnant I wouldn't break up with her/knew that I would get back together with her, but she planned it just so I would stay with her and she doesn't actually enjoy having him, she just wanted to be with me. </p>

<p>'This hurt and upset me a lot, and I honestly don't know how to feel. On one hand I feel like, well, everyone got what they wanted so it's fine, right? But at the same time, I feel like I've been lied to for years AND the fact that my wife admitted to not enjoying our son is weighing on my heart.</p>

<p>'Is it unreasonable for me to feel this way? What would you do if you were in my shoes? I wish I could go back to before I knew this and just continue living my life the way it was... but I don't know if I can now.' </p>

<p>Many responses to the post urged the man to leave his wife and take custody of his son, while others suggested they should try to work through their hurt with couple's therapy.    </p>

<p>Many responses to the post urged the man to divorce his wife and seek full custody of their son because she doesn't 'enjoy' having him around </p>

<p>One person wrote: 'Look making your partner believe that you are using protection when you aren't is rape by deception. You agreed to protected sex. She lied and baby trapped you, not only using you but your son for her own selfish reasons. Get this recorded, leave her and get custody.' </p>

<p>Another said: 'That's heartbreaking, I'm really sorry. The way in which you have handled things is truly amazing. Personally, I'd take my child and be gone and I would focus all my love and attention on them so they know they have at least one person who loves them unconditionally. I'm disgusted by your wife's behaviour.' </p>

<p>Others suggested the man should try couple's counselling before deciding to end the relationship.</p>

<p>'Your son is so lucky to have you,' one Redditor wrote. 'Please be careful in how you handle this, if your marriage sours he will get hurt. The two of you should go to counselling and figure out what you're doing while he's at a babysitter or something. If that's genuinely how she feels, don't discuss it where he can hear.  </p>

<p>Others suggested the man should seek counselling with his wife before filing for a divorce that could impact their child </p>

<p>'Even if you think he won't understand, he'll remember you're upset. I have a few things from my childhood that I remember clearly but did not understand for decades until I looked back with an adult perspective on them.'</p>

<p>Another suggested: 'Please seek counselling, both couple's and individual's. From there you'll figure out if you want to stay together, separate, or get divorced. Good luck!'</p>

<p>A third added: 'Could depression be an influencer here? Perhaps she does love the child but has been feeling very depressed and is in a bad place. I could be absolutely wrong though. I would recommend counselling for both of you, but especially her.' </p>
