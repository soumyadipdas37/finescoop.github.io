<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bayern Munich are reportedly ready to rekindle their interest in Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi this summer.</p>

<p>The German giants were keen on the 19-year-old in January 2019 and made a £40million offer, which was swiftly rejected by Chelsea.</p>

<p>Bayern made another move last summer but couldn't lure him away from Stamford Bridge and Hudson-Odoi eventually committed his future to the club, signing a huge new contract worth around £50million over five years.</p>

<p>Bayern Munich are reportedly keen on making a second attempt to sign Callum Hudson-Odoi</p>

<p>Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic (R) is known to be a huge fan of the young winger</p>

<p>But Bayern have not been deterred in their pursuit and, according to Sky Sports Germany, are set to make another offer for the winger.</p>

<p>It is claimed there has already been contact from the recently-crowned Champions League winners to Hudson-Odoi's representatives. </p>

<p>They have not yet made official contact with Chelsea but would be interested in an initial loan move with an option to buy.</p>

<p>It is also reported that Juventus and RB Leipzig are keeping tabs on Hudson-Odoi. </p>

<p>Chelsea have spent big this summer, recruiting Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech in offensive positions to leave Hudson-Odoi's game time in doubt.</p>

<p>Bayern are also on the hunt for a winger, despite signing Leroy Sane from Manchester City earlier this summer. </p>

<p>Chelsea have spent huge amounts on attackers this summer, leaving Hudson-Odoi vulnerable</p>

<p>The winger signed a huge new contract last summer so Chelsea would not let him go for cheap</p>

<p>They wanted to extend Ivan Perisic's stay in Bavaria from Inter Milan but were unable to bring the Croatian back to the club after his successful stay.</p>

<p>Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic is claimed to have 'nearly fell in love' with Hudson-Odoi during their initial pursuit.</p>

<p>Hudson-Odoi was frustrated at a lack of game time under former manager Maurizio Sarri and even handed in a transfer request to force a move away from Chelsea. </p>

<p>He is now back in the fray under manager Frank Lampard and came off the bench for a brief 10-minute cameo in Chelsea's 3-1 win over Brighton on Monday night.</p>

<p>But he made 35 appearances in all competitions last season, scoring four goals and contributing seven assists. </p>
