<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victoria's police minister Lisa Neville chucked a hissy fit upon learning in the media that Australian Defence Force personnel were to be deployed at Melbourne quarantine hotels. </p>

<p>Ms Neville told the public inquiry into the state's disastrous hotel quarantine program that she was 'pretty cranky' upon opening a Melbourne newspaper and reading that hundreds of troops would be replacing private security guards. </p>

<p>The minister had learned of the call for troops at midnight upon reading a front page newspaper report. </p>

<p>Victoria's Minister for Police and Emergency Services was 'pretty cranky' upon reading an article containing information she believes she oyught have known about </p>

<p>An email exchange in June between police minister Lisa Neville (in grey) and Victoria Police and Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp</p>

<p>The June 25 article had revealed up to 850 ADF personnel had been requested by Victoria Police and Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp as COVID-19 spread from the quarantine hotels. </p>

<p>Quarantine breaches involving private security guards seeded 99 per cent of Victoria's deadly second wave of COVID infections, which in turn has led to more than 700 deaths of the elderly. </p>

<p>More than 30 security guards ended up catching coronavirus from quarantined returned travellers while working in the hotels. </p>

<p>After more than a month of sitting, the inquiry has heard not a single person can identify who made the decision to hire the private security guards. </p>

<p>Mr Crisp withdrew his request for ADF support the same day and instead Corrections Victoria officers were brought into guard returned travellers.</p>

<p>A text message exchange between Ms Neville and Mr Crisp was produced to the inquiry.</p>

<p>'The use of army in hotels? That was not agreed to at (Crisis Council) yesterday but is that we doing? And what will they be doing?' Ms Neville texted.</p>

<p>'Not sure what they do at hotels given no one leaves!! And they have no powers.'</p>

<p>Ms Neville told the inquiry she had been annoyed to learn of the proposal in the paper. </p>

<p>'So I think I, partly knowing how when I use two exclamation marks indicates that. I was still relatively annoyed about it,' she said. </p>

<p>ADF troops were not used to guard hotels housing returned travellers during the start of Victoria's COVID_19 pandemic</p>

<p>Texts between Mr Crisp and another public servant indicate the ADF was on offer from as far back as March 27 and his minister (Lisa Neville) knew it</p>

<p>DHHS secretary Kym Peake sends off an email to the justice department in June. </p>

<p>Ms Neville explained she was concerned from as far back as March 27 that ADF personnel had no powers to enforce hotel quarantine. </p>

<p>The inquiry has heard former Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton claimed he was not consulted about security arrangements at the hotels before learning the decision had already been made. </p>

<p>Ms Neville said she had not been consulted either and was surprised when during a March 27 meeting with Mr Crisp the decision to employ private security appeared to have been set. </p>

<p>At the time, the government's jobs department had been in charge of the hotel quarantine scheme, before it was taken over by the health department. </p>

<p>As the inquiry draws to its conclusion, the question over who made the initial decision to employ private security guards remains unanswered. </p>

<p>Ms Neville said both herself and the commissioner should have been consulted. </p>

<p>Notes of her meeting with Mr Crisp indicate the use of ADF troops had been on offer from before the hotel quarantine program began. </p>

<p>A note scribbled by the police minister in March 27. It refers to private security and ADF </p>

<p> Former Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton appeared at the inquiry last week. He claims he was not asked for his opinion on private security before the decision was made</p>

<p>Victoria Police and Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp annoyed the police minister when he failed to tell her what his plans for ADF personnel were </p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who will appear before the inquiry late Friday afternoon - in a move some believe was made to dodge media scrutiny -  continues to deny ADF help had been on offer. </p>

<p>Ms Neville said she believed ADF personnel would have only been used to fill gaps in Victoria's response to the pandemic and would needed to have 'added value' to existing efforts. </p>

<p>She denied having knowledge of a possible ADF role on March 27, despite text messages from Mr Crisp to a colleague stating he was discussing it with her. </p>

<p>Ms Neville maintained she had been unaware of ADF involvement until she read that article months later. </p>

<p>The inquiry further heard Ms Neville never bothered to ask any of her colleagues interstate about their use of ADF at hotels because her department was not in control of the pandemic response - the health department was. </p>

<p>Earlier, jobs minister Martin Pakula claimed he too did not know who made the decision to use private security rather than ADF or police.</p>

<p>Nor could he explain why security company Unified Security, which was not  endorsed by both the government or Trades Hall, received the lion's share of the hotel security work. </p>

<p>The minister said it was normal for the government to consult unions ahead of awarding contracts to ensure companies paid decent wages. </p>

<p>Unified Security had just 89 permanent staff in March, but ended up employing 1759 people, almost all through subcontractors.  </p>

<p>Victorian jobs minister Martin Pakula fronted the hotel quarantine inquiry in Melbourne on Wednesday. Like most before him, he knew very little about the troubled system and where responsibility lies</p>

<p>A public servant within Mr Pakula's department pushes for Unified Security to be kept on at quarantine hotels beyond the initial weekend in March when the program was announced</p>

<p>The Police Association of Victoria and unions all had concerns about their members working within the hotels</p>

<p>It was through those subcontractors that Victoria's deadly second wave was spread. </p>

<p>'I think it is explicable in terms of the initial decision but I'm not aware of the context in which the decision was made to carry on,' Mr Pakula said. </p>

<p>The minister's department had been in charge of the hotel quarantine plan in the days before it was announced by the premier on March 27, at which point the health department took over control. </p>

<p>He claimed he had been unaware of any issues about hotel quarantine until after the inquiry into the debacle was established. </p>

<p>In hindsight, the minister said he would have preferred Jenny Mikakos' health department to have been in control from the beginning and made its own arrangements for security.</p>

<p>'I agree that it would be preferable for the agency which has overall responsibility to have the contractual management responsibility. I think that would have been better,' he said.</p>

<p>Private security guards were dumped by the State Government at the end of June as it became clear the virus had spread from the hotels they were guarding. </p>

<p>The inquiry continues.  </p>
