<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The death of a talented 18-year-old student, who had saved a boy's life just weeks earlier, was 'most likely' related to taking laughing gas, an inquest has heard.</p>

<p>Rory Wai, from Wivenhoe, Essex, was found unresponsive in his bedroom by his brother William, on the evening of August 6 last year.</p>

<p>Just weeks before his death, Rory had saved a young boy from drowning while working as a lifeguard at Valley Farm Caravan Park in Clacton during the summer holidays. </p>

<p>The 18-year-old's sudden death was possibly related to the use of laughing gas, an inquest at Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Pathologist Dr Shaobin Wu told the court that a post-mortem showed damage to his lungs and his kidneys had symptoms of acute renal failure, the Gazette reported. </p>

<p>Rory Wai, from Wivenhoe, Essex, (above) was found unresponsive by his brother William at his home on August 6, 2019, weeks after saving a boy's life while working as a lifeguard in Clacton</p>

<p>The 18-year-old's death was 'most likely' related to nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, an inquest at Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard on Tuesday</p>

<p>Dr Wu added that although the cause of death was 'unascertained', it was 'most likely' related to drug use.</p>

<p>She listed the use of nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, as a possible factor in the sudden death, but added that she could not 'give a definite cause of death'.</p>

<p>Senior coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said: 'I have given this careful consideration and the evidence Dr Wu has given is that the cause of death is unascertained.</p>

<p>'But from her evidence it was more likely than not Rory's death was drug related.</p>

<p>'I am going to record that he died as a result of an accident, that he took a deliberate action that had an untoward result and outcome.</p>

<p>'He was clearly much-loved by his brothers.</p>

<p>'It must have been horrendous for William to find him.'</p>

<p>As well as his brother William, Rory also leaves behind his father Henry, mother Sally, and his other brother David. </p>

<p>Sally Anderson-Wai paid tribute to her hardworking and kind son following Tuesday's hearing and said she hoped his death may deter other young people from experimenting with laughing gas.</p>

<p>Rory had considered studying engineering at university and had a ten year plan, which included planning a trip to America, Ms Anderson-Wai said.</p>

<p>She told the Gazette: 'He was thinking of becoming a property developer, he'd cleared his bedroom out and had a whiteboard with all these things to do on it.'</p>

<p>Rory's mother Sally paid tribute to her kind son after the inquest and said she hoped his 'devastating' death may deter young people from experimenting with laughing gas</p>

<p>Rory, who mentored younger and less able students, also worked at Brightlingsea Lido after completing his A-Levels at Colchester Sixth Form College. </p>

<p>When Rory's results arrived after his death, his family saw that he had achieved an A grade in Maths and B grades in Physics and Chemistry, and got a B in AS-Level Accountancy.</p>

<p>Ms Anderson-Wai added that after passing his 11 GCSEs in, he won a top prize for Maths in year 11.</p>

<p>She said: 'After he died a couple of his friends came up and said they really loved Rory and it was because he had helped them when they were being bullied at school.</p>

<p>'At the college, he was awarded a posthumous academic award and a new sports award was named after him in December 2019.'</p>

<p>Ms Anderson-Wai said that Rory's death has devastated' their family and hope it may act as a 'deterrent to young people' considering taking drugs or laughing gas.</p>

<p>She said: 'People think laughing gas is OK but it's really not.'</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Kevin Hughes told the court: 'It was a tragic case, which can bring home some of the dangers of drug use.'</p>
