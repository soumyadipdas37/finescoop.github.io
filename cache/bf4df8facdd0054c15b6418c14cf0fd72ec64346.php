<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Extinction Rebellion founder has sparked fury after suggesting MPs and business owners 'culpable' for climate change 'should have a bullet through their heads'.</p>

<p>In a recording obtained by Guido, Roger Hallam, 54, can be heard telling his followers that 'the people that run society, run big business, run governments, run the elites' are fully responsible for the 'climate catastrophe'. </p>

<p>He is also heard arguing for 'mass socialistic organisation', despite Extinction Rebellion tweeting on Tuesday that it is 'not a socialist movement'.</p>

<p>Hallam's controversial remarks were branded 'outrageous' by Conservative MPs as furious Extinction Rebellion activists took to Westminster today. </p>

<p>The co-founder has previously caused trouble for comparing the Holocaust to 'just another f***ery in human history' and suggesting that those 'responsible' for climate change should face Nuremberg-style trials - on a par with Nazi war criminals. </p>

<p>Hallam said: 'Most days When I get out of bed I'm saying the people that are culpable are the people that run society, run big business, run governments, run the elites. </p>

<p>Roger Hallam, 54, told his followers that 'the people that run society, run big business, run governments, run the elites' are fully responsible for the 'climate catastrophe'</p>

<p>Hallam's controversial remarks were branded 'outrageous' by Conservative MPs as furious Extinction Rebellion activists took to Westminster today (pictured: Extinction Rebellion activists take part in a 'Carnival of Corruption' protest march in London, September 3, 2020)</p>

<p>The co-founder has previously caused trouble for comparing the Holocaust to 'just another f***ery in human history' and suggesting that those 'responsible' for climate change should face Nuremberg-style trials - on a par with Nazi war criminals </p>

<p>Hallam compared the murder of six million Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis to other historical massacres and claimed that memory of the Shoah - or Holocaust - was holding Germany back.</p>

<p>The former organic farmer was quickly condemned by Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany after his comments with a newspaper in the country. </p>

<p>In an English-language interview he told Die Zeit: 'The extremity of a trauma...can create a paralysis in actually learning the lessons from it.</p>

<p>'The fact of the matter is, millions of people have been killed in vicious circumstances on a regular basis throughout history.'</p>

<p>He cited the Belgian colonialists who 'went to the Congo in the late 19th century and decimated it'.</p>

<p>Hallam also wants those responsible for climate change to face Nuremberg-style trials.</p>

<p>He even called for a 'World War Two mobilisation' of society, with rationing and the confiscation of private property. </p>

<p>Asked how those responsible for climate change should be dealt with, he told The Times: 'The question will be who's culpable, in the same way [as] with the Nazis. </p>

<p>'Was it just the top Nazis or was it the small guys?' </p>

<p>He added that 'maybe [we] should put a bullet in the head' as punishment. </p>

<p>Last October, Hallam also boasted that prison is 'pretty much as good as it gets' following his six-week remand at Wormwood Scrubs. </p>

<p>Hallam was branded an 'arrogant liability' after claiming to be 'annoyed' that so many of his followers 'made up excuses' to not get arrested.</p>

<p>'I was fine and if anything [it] was annoying, it was sitting there thinking about why so many people make up excuses for not taking this step which is now so necessary,' he told his followers on Facebook. </p>

<p>'I know I'm a bit weird, sitting on a bed all day reading biographies of Gandhi, having my food made for me, is pretty much as good as it gets as far as I am concerned.'</p>

<p>'And they are exponentially more culpable to the extent that the climate catastrophe becomes more clear. </p>

<p>'So in 1990, you might have given them six months in prison, now maybe you should put a bullet through their head - or rather someone probably will.'</p>

<p>He added: 'If you're going to live, or have a substantial probability of living, then we're looking at mass, socialistic organisation.'</p>

<p>Tory MP Matt Vickers today slammed Hallam's 'outrageous' comments, telling The Sun that Extinction Rebellion has been 'hijacked' by 'thugs'. </p>

<p>'They do not stand for the majority of Britain who are about climate change. There are lots of big businesses doing a lot to help the environment,' he said. </p>

<p>Andrew Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, told the newspaper: 'XR is a trojan house for those who know they can never get power through the ballot box and claim to represent legitimate causes - environmentalism.</p>

<p>'But as is clear from their widely publicised ambitions of Socialism, Marxism, anarchy - it's very clear what their ultimate ambition is. Through their extreme actions and violent actions, they have actually damaged their causes.'</p>

<p>A spokesman for Extinction Rebellion today distanced the organisation from Hallam's remarks, adding: 'Extinction Rebellion is resolutely committed to nonviolence and to suggest otherwise is contrary to the evidence.</p>

<p>'These comments were made in an interview with a freelance journalist over a year ago and as we have previously said Roger Hallam no longer holds a formal role in Extinction Rebellion. His views are his own.'</p>

<p>Twitter was ablaze with criticism, with one social media user posting:  'So the founder if #ExtinctionRebellion speaks like a Nazi, says 'Governments + business owners' should/could have a bullet through their heads and a system of Socialism be put in place to replace capitalism. The stench of #DomesticTerrorism is strong!'</p>

<p>Another tweeted: 'So if business owners all have bullets put through their heads, who is going to supply goods and create employment? Mind blowing numpties appear to run with the pack of 'extinction rebellion' supporters.'</p>

<p>It comes as Extinction Rebellion activists glued themselves to the ground to block entrances to Parliament today in a dramatic escalation of their two-week campaign of disruption.  </p>

<p>Protesters said they 'jumped the barriers and ran past armed police to glue (themselves) on to the floor outside the House of Lords'. </p>

<p>The tactic, a staple of previous XR demonstrations, was accompanied by scores of others staging a sit-in elsewhere around the perimeter of the parliamentary estate, including at the Carriage Gates. </p>

<p>A separate protest, carried out by XR ally Animal Rebellion, saw activists locked on top of a pink slaughterhouse truck parked sideways across nearby Victoria Street. </p>

<p>The campaigners said they are demanding 'a plant-based food system as a means to mitigate the worst impacts of the climate crisis and reduce the risk of future pandemics'. They have previously used fake blood in their demonstrations. </p>

<p>Police arrested another 72 Extinction Rebellion activists yesterday as they swooped on demonstrators lying in the road to block Boris Johnson's route to Prime Ministers' Questions yesterday. </p>

<p>It brings the total number of eco-warriors detained to 232 since they kick-started their fortnight of chaos in the capital on Friday following a coronavirus recess. Police said there had been 'dozens' more arrests today. </p>

<p>The arrests were made for a range of offences including breaching Public Order conditions, obstructing the highway, obstructing police and assault on an emergency worker. </p>

<p>Extinction Rebellion protesters also tried to storm the new BBC building in Cardiff city centre this afternoon. </p>

<p>Hallam is also heard arguing for 'mass socialistic organisation', despite Extinction Rebellion tweeting on Tuesday that it is 'not a socialist movement'</p>

<p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said police have put a cordon around the vehicle and are working to safely remove protesters, who will subsequently be arrested</p>

<p>Protesters have been holding a demonstration in Central Square betwee the new BBC Wales headquarters and Central Station.</p>

<p>There are reports that some of the protesters have glued their hand to the building and police stopped others from entering.</p>

<p>It comes a day after they blocked Bute Terrace in both directions and caused traffic delays around the city.</p>

<p>Around 400 people are estimated to have attended the protest, which is part of a week-long campaign across the UK.</p>

<p>A spokesman for South Wales Police said: 'Officers are currently in attendance at a protest in Central Square in Cardiff. One person has been arrested on suspicion of committing criminal damage.</p>

<p>'Officers are working to engage with protest organisers and attendees in order to remind them of their obligations under the current Coronavirus legislation and the overarching goal for everyone to take personal responsibility by following Welsh Government regulations to Keep Wales Safe.</p>

<p>'We are duty-bound to take into account all relevant legislation, and South Wales Police has strived to maintain a consistent policing style of engaging, explaining and encouraging, and enforcing as last resort where necessary, throughout this public health emergency - an approach we intend to continue.'</p>

<p>XR spokesperson Tamsin Omand, 35, from London, said that protesters wanted the Prime Minister to see and hear their action.</p>

<p>'The climate and ecological emergency has to be the absolute priority - how we are going to transform society into one that is fit for the crises we are already experiencing and the ones coming down the road,' she said. </p>

<p>'We are seeing a Parliament that has failed on every count - Boris Johnson wasn't even around for the first Cobras (of the coronavirus pandemic), so if that is the attitude he is going to take to the climate and ecological emergency we are in dire straits.</p>

<p>'Disruption is a core tenet of how XR works and how we have managed to achieve so much in a short period of time.</p>

<p>'We have been outside Downing Street blocking his route on both sides and of course he's encountering us here in the square - I think we are impossible to ignore.'   </p>
