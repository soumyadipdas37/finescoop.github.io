<p>Tony Blair's former spin doctor says turning his son Calum, the middle of three children he has with partner Fiona, away was the hardest decision of his life.</p>

<p>Calum, now 31, had gradually descended into alcoholism but had spurned his family's repeated pleas to curb his excessive drinking.</p>

<p>Mr Campbell said: 'It was a very, very horrible thing to have to do. If anything had happened to him I would never have forgiven myself.</p>

<p>'After Calum staggered off into the night, I slid down the door and put my head in my hands, rocking like a child, weeping.</p>

<p>'We spent the whole night not knowing where he was, if he'd got into trouble, fallen into the canal... and the worry that this had created a thing between us.</p>

<p>'That was very, very painful. I felt helpless.'</p>

<p>Alastair Campbell has revealed that he blames himself for his son's alcoholism as he tells of the time he shut his drunk 21-year-old out of the family home</p>

<p>Tony Blair's former spin doctor says turning his son Calum (pictured), the middle of three children he has with partner Fiona, away was the hardest decision of his life</p>

<p>The ex-No10 communications chief said Calum's drinking started while he worked for Mr Blair and escalated after he left Downing Street in 2007.</p>

<p>He fears that his own battle with depression, which took a drastic turn after he quit frontline politics, contributed to his son's alcoholism.</p>

<p>'I worried I was possibly contributing to it or making it worse, that who I am and what I do made Calum drink,' Mr Campbell told The Mirror.</p>

<p>'I was around much less for Calum than my other two... He became a teen while I was working with Tony Blair. Fiona would say that I wasn't always there when I should have been and even when I was there I wasn't really there. </p>

<p>'I hadn't even been aware that he had been drinking as much as he was.</p>

<p>'I'd also had a problem with alcohol in my 20s, and I felt I ought to have been able to do more to help him, but I didn't handle it well at all.</p>

<p>'I saw myself making the same mistakes as people made with me back then, just getting angry and telling him to stop, which doesn't help.</p>

<p>Calum (right) insists that his own alcoholism had nothing to do with his father's intense work ethic as Tony Blair's right-hand man or his mood swings</p>

<p>'My own depression was getting worse, and worrying about him didn't help.  </p>

<p>'There were nights we lay worrying the next knock on the door would be the police telling us he was dead.'</p>

<p>Calum insists that his own alcoholism had nothing to do with his father's intense work ethic as Tony Blair's right-hand man or his mood swings.</p>

<p>But he recalls: 'I didn't have a normal childhood. I would be hanging around on street corners at 4pm and in Downing St at 6pm. </p>

<p>'You couldn't really get much of my dad's attention much of the time, back then he was constantly paging, not tweeting. I remember the mood swings'.   </p>

<p>The ex-No10 communications chief (pictured: in 2005) said Calum's drinking started while he worked for Mr Blair and escalated after he left Downing Street in 2007 </p>

<p>In his new book Living Better: How I Learned To Survive Depression, Mr Campbell opens up about his own struggle with alcoholism and depression.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Mirror, he said he tried to help former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy, who died in 2015 of a haemorrhage linked to alcoholism, and booked him in to Castle Craig rehab clinic in Scotland, where Calum finally beat his addiction.</p>

<p>The former spin doctor also revealed he has been secretly helping others in politics suffering, adding: 'Westminster is like a laboratory for mental health problems.</p>

<p>'A lot of MPs could do with having proper psychological help, but very few of them do. I totally get why they don't want to be open, but I don't think it helps anyone.</p>

<p>'One thing about me coming out about my depression is that I get a lot of MPs coming to be asking for help. </p>

<p>'More people in politics would benefit from being honest.' </p>
