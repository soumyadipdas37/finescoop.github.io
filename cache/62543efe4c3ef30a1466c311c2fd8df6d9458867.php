<p>She was in her 90s when she passed away 'peacefully'. </p>

<p>Residents said the arrival of Mr Palmer's yacht has 'turned a few heads' for many reasons - in an area where it isn't unusual to see a luxury boat.</p>

<p>The boat (interior pictured) is named in honour of Mr Palmer's mother, who passed away in 2014</p>

<p>'A boat's original name is recorded in what we call a "ledger of the deep" and changing it is considered very bad juju. It can be done but it's extremely uncommon.' </p>

<p>Renaming a boat involves destroying log books with the old name. </p>

<p>Others were simply captivated by the mere size of the three-storey vessel initially purchased in 2009.    </p>
