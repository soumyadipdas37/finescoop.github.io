<p>And the now 47-year-old Australian star has revealed the racy scene almost didn't happen.</p>

<p>Speaking on The Morning Show on Thursday, Adam revealed the scene wasn't actually in the original script. </p>

<p>Revealing: On Thursday, Adam Garcia (pictured) revealed the backstory behind THAT raunchy dance scene in Coyote Ugly - 20 years after the iconic film was made</p>

<p>'The whole thing sort of came about because they realised I was a dancer and they realised they can put this scene in,' he said. </p>

<p>Adam explained that he and the film's choreographer, Travis Payne, then worked out a routine - only for the producers to be less-than-thrilled with it.     </p>

<p>'We went and choreographed this whole thing and we did it, and they said I looked like I was a professional dancer,' he said. </p>

<p>Hot, hot, hot! Adam explained that he and the film's choreographer, Travis Payne, then worked out a routine - only for the producers of the film to be less than thrilled with it</p>

<p>Adam said he then had to downplay his dancing skills, in order for it to be more authentic for the film. </p>

<p>'[So they said] Make it less pointy-toey... and more nibble rubbing,' he laughed. </p>

<p>The memorable scene features Adam, who portrayed Kevin O'Donnell in the film, do a strip tease on the bar to help love interest, Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo). </p>
