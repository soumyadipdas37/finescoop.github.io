<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Striker Mauro Icardi found his poacher's goal touch again as defending champions Paris Saint-Germain beat Reims 2-0 Sunday in the French league to continue their recovery with a third straight win.</p>

<p>After losing the Champions League final 1-0 to Bayern Munich last month, PSG opened their league campaign with consecutive losses and narrowly avoided a third before squeezing a 1-0 home win against Metz in stoppage time.</p>

<p>No such trouble this time, however, as Icardi struck twice. He opened his account for the season in the ninth minute after being well set up by striker Kylian Mbappe.</p>

<p>With a 2-0 win over Reims, PSG are now up to seventh in Ligue 1 after their third win in a row</p>

<p>Mauro Icardi got on the score sheet twice to help his team's league resurgence continue</p>

<p>Brazil star Neymar's goal drought continued when he missed a good chance late in the half. Mbappe created Icardi's second goal midway through the second half and then missed a glaring opportunity of his own.</p>

<p>Neymar failed to score in three games during the Champions League's final eight in Lisbon and has not yet netted in the league so far.</p>

<p>PSG climbed up to seventh place with nine points from five rounds. That's four points behind leader Rennes, who have made the best start in the Brittany club's history.</p>

<p>Brazilian star Neymar's goal drought continues though, despite his team playing better</p>

<p>Earlier, striker Wissam Ben Yedder scored twice as nine-man Monaco held on for a 3-2 home win over struggling Strasbourg.</p>

<p>Ben Yedder, last season's joint top scorer with PSG's Mbappe, struck first in the ninth minute. Right back Ruben Aguilar made it 2-0 just before halftime for fifth-place Monaco.</p>

<p>After Mehdi Chahiri replied for the visitors, Ben Yedder increased the lead to 3-1 in the 53rd before midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni and defender Axel Disasi were red carded. Ludovic Ajorque pulled one back for Strasbourg from the penalty spot in the 70th.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Wissam Ben Yedder helped his team to a 3-2 win despite being down to nine men</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Teji Savanier's last-minute penalty secured Montpellier a 2-2 draw at Dijon.</p>

<p>Lens striker Ignatius Ganago scored in a 1-1 draw at Nimes and limped off in the second half with a hamstring injury. He netted his fourth goal this season from Gael Kakuta's pass in the 34th.</p>

<p>Also Sunday, it was: Bordeaux 0-0 Nice; Lorient 1-1 Lyon; and Angers 3-2 Brest.</p>
