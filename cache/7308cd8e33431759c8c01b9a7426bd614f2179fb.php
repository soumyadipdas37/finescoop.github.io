<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The moment a driver caused a three-car pileup after using the handbrake to stop on a highway to avoid crashing into a Portaloo truck has been caught on camera.</p>

<p>Terrifying footage shared by Dashcam Owners Australia showed the moment the accident unfolded on the Pacific Highway at the Oxenford exit near Queensland's Gold Coast on September 3 at about 3pm.</p>

<p>In the video, a grey Skoda Octavia could be seen trailing closely behind a larger vehicle carrying portable toilets on the three-lane motorway, which has a speed limit of 110km/h.</p>

<p>Smoke streamed from the Skoda's wheels as the driver appeared to engage the handbrake to avoid a collision, while swerving into oncoming traffic in the middle lane (pictured) </p>

<p>The Portaloo truck slowed to move in to the congested left-hand lane to exit the highway, but the driver of the grey car was apparently startled.</p>

<p>The vehicle with the dashcam was travelling in the middle lane and crashed into the Skoda, sending both vehicles screeching into a white Toyota Hilux in the right-hand lane.</p>

<p>Pieces of plastic and debris from the smash were sent flying across windshields and onto the tarmac, as the three cars came to a grinding halt on the busy highway. </p>

<p>The footage sparked a heated debate in the comments section about how the Skoda driver used the brakes. </p>

<p>'How did the driver lock up the back wheels like that? Seriously they couldn't have pulled the handbrake...could they?' asked one confused viewer.</p>

<p>'Only the back wheels locked up, so they definitely pulled the handbrake,' explained another.</p>

<p>'It really looks like the handbrake was used. You can see the car tip forwards before the brake lights even came on,' someone else wrote.</p>
