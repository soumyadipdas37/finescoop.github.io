<p>Over the last 12 months, homebuyers in Sydney have increasingly opted to search for properties near beaches, reserves or national parks and away from the CBD.</p>

<p>The realestate.com.au study of 'high intent' buyer activity online discovered beach areas to the far north and south of Sydney were among the most popular suburbs.  </p>

<p>Wamberal on the Central Coast was identified as the most in-demand suburb with homebuyers - despite being more than 80 kilometres north of Sydney</p>

<p>A spike was also recorded in south-western suburbs, with buyers snapping up homes in Leppington, Austral and Gledswood Hills. </p>

<p>Inquiry levels for these suburbs had doubled when compared to a year earlier, as they have sufficient properties eligible for government buyer grants. </p>

<p>Nerida Conisbee, the chief economist at Realestate.com.au, said the demand for house and land packages in the city's outer suburbs was growing. </p>

<p>'It's clear that a longer commute doesn't bother people as much as it might have before, which makes sense if you're only going into the office once or twice a week,' Ms Conisbee said.</p>

<p>'First homebuyers seem to be more willing to purchase house and land packages in fringe suburbs and more people want space.'</p>

<p>Wamberal on the Central Coast was identified as the most in-demand suburb with homebuyers - despite being more than 80 kilometres north of Sydney.    </p>

<p>Prospective buyers looking for a home in the suburb would be less than a kilometre from a waterway, with Wamberal Lagoon or Wamberal Beach nearby.</p>

<p>The research found buyers seeking to acquire a unit were also searching areas close to water, including Freshwater, Kirribilli and Cammeray.</p>

<p>Ms Conisbee suggested spending more time at home during the coronavirus crisis may have encouraged families to prioritise lifestyle over accessibility when buying a home.  </p>
