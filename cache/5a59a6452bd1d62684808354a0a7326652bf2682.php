<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has suggested negative interest rates are not imminent, but they remain on the table as the economy faces 'hard yards' ahead amid a fresh spike in Covid cases.</p>

<p>Speaking on a British Chambers of Commerce webinar, Bailey said policymakers have looked 'very hard' at the possibility to cut rates further, including below zero, but that didn't mean they were going to do so now.</p>

<p>His comments come after minutes from the Bank's meeting last week showed officials were looking into the practicalities of negative rates, raising speculation of an imminent cut.</p>

<p>BoE governor Andrew Bailey has suggested negative interest rates are not imminent</p>

<p>But Bailey today seemed to play down such talks, saying policymakers just needed to be sure negative rates were a viable option if needed. </p>

<p>'It would be a cardinal sin in my view if we said we had a tool in the box which we didn't think could be operationally used,' he said.</p>

<p>'Yes it's in the tool bag, but that doesn't mean we're going to use negative rates.'</p>

<p>Bailey has launched a study on whether the UK should follow Japan and the EU by setting negative interest rates. </p>

<p>He has described other countries' experiences of negative rates as a 'mixed bag', with their effectiveness depending on the structure of the banking system and the timing of the move. </p>

<p>If the Bank of England moved to push rates into the red, then commercial banks would have to pay to hold cash deposits with them, making it likely most if not all would pass on these costs to savers. </p>

<p>The pound rose against the dollar and the euro earlier on following his comments, but has since lost those gains. Sterling was 0.15 per cent lower against the dollar and flat against the euro, with £1 buying $1.279 and €1.088 on currency markets this afternoon. </p>

<p>Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com, said: 'This was not the attempt to distance the Monetary Policy Committee from the negative rate comments in last week's release to give the central bank more flexibility. </p>

<p>'As the MPC indicated last week, Bailey wants to leave negative rates on the table.'</p>

<p>Last week the Bank's policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.1 per cent amid evidence that the economy was emerging well from the paralysis of lockdown. </p>

<p>Covid fears: Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new restrictions today to prevent the spread of Covid today</p>

<p>But today Bailey said the rapid rise of coronavirus cases 'reinforce the downside risks' to the economy, including a faster than expected rise in unemployment. </p>

<p>He said: 'The latest news, that we are seeing a very unfortunate, faster return of Covid-19 is extremely difficult news for all of us and the whole country.</p>

<p>'That does reinforce the downside risks we have in our forecasts.</p>

<p>'The Bank of England will do everything we can do within our remit and powers to support the businesses and people of this country. And we will do that.' </p>

<p>His comments come as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new restrictions today to prevent the spread of Covid, including a 10pm curfew on all restaurants, bars and pubs across England from Thursday and a U-turn on office workers - now again told to work from home.</p>
