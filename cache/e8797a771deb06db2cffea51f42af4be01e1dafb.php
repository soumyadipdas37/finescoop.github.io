<p>The reality star, 39, was scheduled to have a chat with Lorraine Kelly about her YouTube documentary where she speaks about abuse she endured as a teen.</p>

<p>Speaking to Ross King, Lorraine said: 'We were supposed to be talking to Paris Hilton today. Sadly we got a call very, very late last night saying that's she's not well.'</p>

<p>Sickness: Paris Hilton, 39, cancelled an interview on ITV's Lorraine at the last minute after suddenly falling ill</p>

<p>'We obviously wish her well and hope she gets better soon.'</p>

<p>Lorraine addressed some of the themes from the documentary This Is Paris, including the persona Paris said she put on during her early years of fame. </p>

<p>She said: 'When I watched the documentary I thought, "Not a happy life". She's invented this character and even speaks in a funny voice. </p>

<p>'I thought that was her voice but it's not at all! She's a bright girl but she puts on an act.'</p>

<p>Interview: The reality star was scheduled to have a chat with Lorraine Kelly about her YouTube documentary where she speaks about abuse she endured as a teen</p>

<p>Ross agreed and said: 'That’s not her voice, she’s a sharp cookie. We talk about the Kardashians as well, Kim was Paris’ pal. Paris set the way for her.'</p>

<p>Lorraine added: 'I think she's someone desperately looking for love and desperately looking for validation, I suppose. It's just very sad.</p>

<p>'I hope she comes back, I would love to speak to her.'</p>

<p>It comes after Paris admitted she felt 'pressured' into making her sex tape with her 'first real boyfriend' Rick Salomon. </p>

<p>Lorraine said: 'When I watched the documentary I thought, "Not a happy life". She's invented this character and even speaks in a funny voice'</p>

<p>In the documentary, she compared the ordeal to being 'electronically raped' and admitted she wasn't 'in the right head space' after the video leaked online.</p>

<p>Filmed at the height of their relationship in 2001, the home-made movie was subsequently sold by poker player Rick, 52, following their separation in 2004 and distributed with the title 1 Night In Paris.</p>

<p>According to The Sun, the media personality reflected: 'It was my first real relationship. Eighteen. I was so in love with him and I wanted to make him happy.</p>

<p>Fame: Ross King agreed and said: 'That’s not her voice, she’s a sharp cookie. We talk about the Kardashians as well, Kim was Paris’ pal. Paris set the way for her' </p>

<p>'And I just remember him pulling out the camera. And he was kind of pressuring me into it. It was like being electronically raped.'</p>

<p>Sharing her thoughts on whether the outcome would have been the same if the tape was released today, the heiress added: 'That was a private moment of a teenage girl, not in her right head space, but everyone was watching it and laughing like it's something funny.</p>

<p>'If that happened today, it would not be the same story at all, but they made me the bad person. I did something bad...I was just so lost and desperate for love that I found the worst possible person.' </p>

<p>Drama: It comes after Paris admitted she felt 'pressured' into making her sex tape with her 'first real boyfriend' Rick Salomon (pictured in 2005)</p>
