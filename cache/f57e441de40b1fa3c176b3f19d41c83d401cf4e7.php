<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sheffield United are reluctant to meet Liverpool’s asking price for Rhian Brewster and have offered a loan leaving the door open for Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old was left out of Liverpool’s matchday squad for the Carabao Cup tie at Lincoln City on Thursday night, fueling speculation of an imminent move.</p>

<p>Blades manager Chris Wilder had held talks with Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp but Brewster's future remains in limbo. </p>

<p>Rhian Brewster's future remains in limbo with Sheffield United unwilling to pay £25m</p>

<p>Crystal Palace are also admirers, but are yet to make an approach for a player valued at £25m by Liverpool, who insist on a buy-back option being included in any deal.</p>

<p>Brewster is in demand after scoring 11 goals in 22 appearances during a loan spell at Swansea City last season, which included several stunning strikes.  </p>

<p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is an admirer of Brewster's talents but can't promise him regular game time with a formidable forward line of Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah.</p>

<p>Forward Diogo Jota has also just been signed from Wolves.</p>

<p> Brewster is highly rated by Liverpool but the club can't offer him regular first team football</p>

<p>Klopp handed the 20-year-old a rare substitute appearance in extra-time during the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal at Wembley, but Brewster missed his penalty in the shoot-out. </p>

<p>That could now be his last appearance in a Reds shirt.</p>

<p>Klopp may also be loking to recoup some of the £66m spent on midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Jota last week. </p>
