<p>Joy Hattie thought she was 'losing her marbles' when her two dogs, Sadie and Sophie, kept showed up behind her upstairs while she was folding laundry. </p>

<p>The mystery was solved when she set up a camera and caught her mischievous pooch Sophie red handed, opening the locked baby gate with her nose and two paws.  </p>

<p>Joy, a teacher in Morinville, Alberta, Canada, had installed the baby gate across the stairs to stop her two pets, Sadie and Sophie, from getting her new carpet dirty.  </p>

<p>However the teacher was left baffled when the pair kept appearing upstairs - despite her being convinced she had locked the gate behind her. </p>

<p>As it continued to happen, Joy blamed herself for keeping the security gate open, until she spotted the real culprit in action in amazing footage.</p>

<p>Standing at the top of the staircase, Joy filmed as her pet Sophie, a great Pyrenees Shar-Pei cross, lifted the clasp over the gate.</p>

<p>At first the white pooch put her nose under one end and lifted it slightly before wedging it upright by placing her right front paw on the hinge.</p>

<p>The clever one-year-old then moved her left paw under the raised clasp and simultaneously pulled back on the railings to open the door widely.</p>

<p>Once the barrier was wide open, Sophie and her two-year-old sister Sadie - a Labrador white shepherd cross - followed through and trotted up the stairs. </p>

<p>'I genuinely thought I was losing my mind,' said Joy. The pair of them would be stood behind me and I'd look downstairs and see the gate open.</p>

<p>'In our home, the upstairs was freshly carpeted so the baby gate was there to help keep things clean. </p>

<p>'Sophie and Sadie are allowed upstairs with us but did not have free reign.</p>

<p>'I noticed when going upstairs to put away laundry, a few minutes later Sophie would appear.</p>

<p>'I thought I was losing my marbles when I'd see the gate open and blamed myself for not latching it.</p>

<p>'I genuinely thought I was losing my mind,' said Joy, a teacher in Morinville, Alberta. ' I'd see the gate open and blamed myself for not latching it'</p>

<p>'Sadie could always jump the gate but wouldn't because she's the 'good girl'. Sophie prefers to solve problems her own way, and avoid physical exertion like jumping.</p>

<p>'I decided to see what was happening and hid in the bathroom at the top of the stairs with my phone out. This is the result!</p>

<p>'I was not surprised at all when I discovered what she was doing. Sophie is a dog who tries to catch balls with her front paws instead of her mouth.</p>

<p>'She's very clever and mischievous and makes us laugh every day.'</p>
