<p>Vote: Jenner recently made her Instagram Live debut to discuss politics with Jon Favreau, the former speech writer for President Barack Obama and current host of the popular politics podcast Pod Save America</p>

<p>The reality star had some initial technical difficulties since she wasn't used to the format, but once things got underway the two discussed the perils of voter suppression across the country and the importance of increasing youth voting turnout.</p>

<p>'If you don't like what's happening in America right now, I honestly think this election is your last chance to change it,' Favreau warned.</p>

<p>'Voting won't elect a savior, it won't solve all our problems, but voting will give us a chance to do something about climate change, systemic racism, healthcare, and education. Voting will give us a chance to make sure that our politics isn't as f**ked up as it is right now, and that we're not all at each other's throats like we are right now.'</p>
