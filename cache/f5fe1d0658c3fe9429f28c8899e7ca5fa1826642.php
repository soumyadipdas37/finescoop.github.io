<p>The patient called the 13 Health line, operated by Queensland Health, for advice while suffering from abdominal pain following a serious operation.</p>

<p>According to Gold Coast Bulletin, the woman called the hotline as a last resort late at night while writhing in pain. </p>

<p>Queensland Health has apologised to the woman, admitting the advice could have been catastrophic for her health.</p>

<p>About 100 calls per day are made to the hotline, but the number has dramatically increased since COVID-19.</p>

<p>The line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is run by 170 registered nurses.</p>

<p>Employees are required to have a minimum of two years' experience.</p>

<p>The nurse in question had reportedly held the job for five years. </p>

<p>'We apologise for any distress caused to the patient, which is why we took immediate action within 24 hours of the incident,' a Queensland Health spokesman said.</p>

<p>They also said advice provided on the hotline is of a high standard, and reminded patients that a phone conversation does not replace a medical examination.</p>

<p>The incident is being investigated. </p>
