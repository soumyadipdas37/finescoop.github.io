<p>A judge ruled Wednesday that the 10-time Grammy nominee did not commit copyright infringement in her song based on Chapman's Baby Can I Hold You.</p>

<p>US district judge Virginia A Phillips found that her use of the song constitutes 'fair use,' protecting a common practice in the music industry of developing new music based on existing work, and requesting license from the original artist before release.</p>

<p>Judge Phillips wrote: 'Artists usually experiment with works before seeking licenses from rights holders and rights holders typically ask to see a proposed work before approving a license.</p>

<p>'A ruling uprooting these common practices would limit creativity and stifle innovation within the music industry.'</p>

<p>The Pink Friday artist's legal team argued that artists should be free to create work based on existing material, without fearing legal action from the original artist when pursuing license.</p>

<p>The attorney stated: 'Such free-flowing creativity is important to all recording artists, but particularly in hip hop.</p>

<p>'With that category of music, a recording artist typically goes into the studio and experiments with dozens of different ‘beats’ or snippets of melodies, before hitting upon a pleasing combination.'</p>

<p>Although the judge agreed, she ruled that the dispute over whether Minaj provided the music to DJ Flex would need to go to jury. </p>
