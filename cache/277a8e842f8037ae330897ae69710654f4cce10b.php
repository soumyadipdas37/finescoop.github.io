<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They filed for divorce after nearly 13 years of marriage back in May, with actor Kyle Newman also filing a domestic violence prevention petition against actress Jaime King.</p>

<p>Now, ex-husband Newman, 44, is claiming that King, 41, cleared out their joint bank accounts before forcing him to leave their family home during the divorce.</p>

<p>DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for the Hart of Dixie actress for comment regarding the claims.  </p>

<p>Getting ugly: Jaime King's ex-husband Kyle Newman claims the actress 'emptied their joint bank accounts' and 'excluded' him from family home amid divorce battle</p>

<p>According to legal documents, the actress 'emptied and closed' their joint bank accounts leaving Newman with 'minimal access to funds' per a report by UsWeekly.</p>

<p>The legal documents state that Newman has requested that King pay his legal fees, as his role as a stay-at-home father to their two sons James, six, and Leo, five, makes it impossible for him to cover to the $150,000 in fees he has already built up.</p>

<p>He is asking for a repayment sum totaling $70,000 to his lawyers. </p>

<p>Split: They filed for divorce after nearly 13 years of marriage back in May, with actor Kyle Newman also filing a domestic violence prevention petition against actress Jaime King</p>

<p>It is also claimed in the papers that King has 'excluded [Newman] from the family residence' since the divorce, which has delayed their legal battle and lead to further legal fees for Newman.</p>

<p>The report adds that instead of finding a resolution, King returned to work in Canada to film a new season the show Black Summer, allegedly leaving Newman with the children and 'without support [and] without access to community funds.'  </p>

<p>Since the split, Newman has looked after their children in Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>King also has a restraining order on Newman, and in May accused him of abusing her for the past five-and-a-half years in explosive court documents.</p>

<p>The Nebraska-born actress has claimed that she is suffering from 'anxiety, fear and emotional damage' as a result of the long term abuse at the hands of her ex.</p>

<p>King also claimed that her estranged husband used GPS trackers and microphone pens to keep tabs on her, and that he took $300k from her bank account. </p>

<p>She went on to say that he's been 'gaslighting' her and that she's 'incredibly afraid' of 'what he will do in retaliation.' </p>

<p>The White Chicks star requested her two Shiba Inu dogs Peter and Wendy, which she owned before they were married, as well as their Mercedes 'so the respondent cannot track my movements through the internal tracking system.' </p>

<p>She also asked for 'exclusive use of all home security systems… so that respondent cannot continue to surveil me.' </p>

<p>King wrote in the documents: 'He told me that he is having people watch my movements and my home.' </p>

<p>She went on to allege that Newman is holding their sons James, six, and Leo, four, out-of-state in Pennsylvania and refuses to return them. </p>
