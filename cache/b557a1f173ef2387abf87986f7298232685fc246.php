<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jody Morris and Chelsea's coaching staff aren't the only influences on Frank Lampard's management, with the Blues boss admitting he consults his wife over players' 'life issues'.</p>

<p>The Englishman took on his first Premier League season in only his second term as a manager in 2019-20, impressing under the Stamford Bridge pressure to finish fourth and reach the FA Cup final. </p>

<p>The Blues icon is continuing to learn quickly in the dugout and has experience playing under some of the world's top bosses to pull from - but Lampard has revealed his wife Christine is a crucial sounding board for his man-management. </p>

<p>Frank Lampard has revealed his wife Christine helps him deal with his players's personalities</p>

<p>The pair have been married since 2015, with Christine a famous TV presenter working on ITV</p>

<p>Lampard impressed in his first season back at Chelsea as a young boss but is still learning </p>

<p>'I do throw a lot of things off Christine,' the legendary former midfielder said. </p>

<p>'She's not picking what full-back we're going to play that weekend but at the same time, if I have certain issues which are life issues - and actually football issues sometimes - I can definitely go home.'  </p>

<p>'I go, "Christine, what do you think about this problem: I've got a player here and he didn't turn up for training yesterday. But we still probably need him on the weekend, what do you think?''' </p>

<p>Lampard revealed that Christine helps him understand players' issues in their personal lives</p>

<p>'And she goes: "Does he have a girlfriend, a wife? Is there a problem? Have you spoken to them? Maybe you should speak to them."</p>

<p>'So she's not my life coach as such, but I'm very fortunate to have someone to bounce things off of at home.'</p>

<p>Christine, who married Lampard in 2015 during his breif Manchester City spell, is a high-profile TV presenter, currently appearing on ITV's Loose Women.  </p>
