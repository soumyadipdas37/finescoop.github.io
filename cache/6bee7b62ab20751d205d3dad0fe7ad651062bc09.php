<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Is this what TV presenter Jeremy Vine's feet really look like? Or has the shot been taken with an ultra wide-angle to produce a strong visual distortion? </p>

<p>Well, whichever it is, the broadcaster's 'outsized' feet in question were not the intended subject of discussion for this Twitter post.</p>

<p>It was in fact the ripped jeans Jeremy is wearing in the picture that was meant to be the focal point.</p>

<p>Jeremy Vine was showcasing his ripped jeans on a Twitter post but it was his huge feet that grabbed the attention of social media users</p>

<p>Alongside the picture in a Twitter post, Jeremy wrote: 'When your work trousers are soaked, and the only spare pair you can find are the ones you hid in the office so your family never saw them'</p>

<p>But the patched up jeans were overshadowed by his enormous feet and got Twitter users in a frenzy over them. </p>

<p>One user <?php echo e('@'); ?>McshineShiney likened the 6 foot 3 inches tall presenter's feet to that of Sideshow Bob from The Simpsons programme who is famed for his gigantic feet.</p>

<p>'I'm more concerned about them shoes Jeremy. Sideshow Bob is asking for them back,' he wrote. </p>

<p>Others cheekily commented on the size of the 'clown shoes' being as big as a house. </p>

<p>Lee using the handle <?php echo e('@'); ?>LA_71_ quipped: 'Always fancied a holiday, Can I borrow your shoes please'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <?php echo e('@'); ?>robjbeech commented: 'There's an elderly lady with a large number of children with a poor, primarily liquid diet asking for their home back.'</p>

<p>Presenter Jeremy Vine's 'outsized' feet have become the topic of discussion for Twitter users</p>
