<p>Universities Scotland said the stricter restrictions were a 'necessary step at this crucial moment of managing the virus in the student population, to protect students and the wider community'.</p>

<p>The new rules say institutions will 'make absolutely clear to students that there must be no parties, and no socialising outside their households'.</p>

<p>The outbreaks across Scotland have prompted a strong warning against house parties. </p>

<p>During yesterday's coronavirus briefing national clinical director, Jason Leitch, said: 'We need you not to have house parties, I could not be more clear.'</p>

<p>Nicola Sturgeon said the 'significant outbreak at the University of Glasgow' had impacted on the daily Covid-19 infection figure for the NHS Greater Glasgow area.</p>
