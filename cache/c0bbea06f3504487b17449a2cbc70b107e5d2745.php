<p>Casual: His female companion wrapped up in a purple kaftan after emerging from the ocean</p>

<p>'I mean, I saw it. I continue to watch the whole series even after I'd been killed off in the lavatory,' he said, laughing.</p>

<p>'Because I just thought it's a fantastic television show, you know? I was very lucky to be part of it. I loved it; there were storylines [where] I wanted to know what was going to happen to these people! </p>

<p>'I know that the finale satisfied a lot of people. It also disappointed a lot of people, and I'm afraid I am in the latter camp,' he said.</p>

<p>'I think David and Dan raised the bar when it came to television screenplay writing,' he continued. </p>

<p>'They are phenomenal. And for the whole thing to end up as a committee, I just thought, "Hmm, no." I would say I was somewhat underwhelmed by [the ending].' </p>

<p>Time to eat! Later the pair were seen enjoying lunch together following a swim in the sea</p>
