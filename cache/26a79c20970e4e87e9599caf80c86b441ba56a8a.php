<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you suffer from neck and shoulder pain then getting a good nights sleep is easier said then done. </p>

<p>Luckily, frustrated Amazon shoppers have found a solution in the SEPOVEDA Support Pillows. Ergonomically designed, the pillows are filled with enough microfiber to offer a super comfortable sleep whilst protecting the user's head, neck, spine. </p>

<p>Even better, the support pillows are now on sale, meaning you can pick them up for only £21.24 for a set of two.  </p>

<p>The SEPOVEDA Support Pillows have a near-perfect star rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Amazon </p>

<p>Unlike feather pillows, the SEPOVEDA support pillows are generously filled with bouncy hollow microfiber which offers a denser, plumper fill. </p>

<p>The product description states the ultra-bounce pillow is 'ergonomically designed' to encourage a peaceful night's sleep and to protect your head and neck when you fall asleep, relieving aches and pains.  </p>

<p>The hit product, which costs £21.24 in the sale, has received an abundance of dreamy reviews online.  In fact, 83 per cent have awarded it the full five-stars.</p>

<p>One shopper claimed the pillow is of hotel quality, writing: 'I might go the extra mile to compare them to the famous Hilton Pillows in their softness. The comfort is excellent. I have neck pain, which means I need that extra support for the neck, which is perfect in this pillow.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another penned: 'Outstanding comfort for neck or shoulder pain sufferers. After three previous purchases of silent night and Slumberdown pillows, I decided to pay a little extra and purchase these. </p>

<p>The difference is night and day, and my only regret is that I did not spend the extra sooner and purchase these. No more waking up to neck or shoulder pain. My partner has already taken one, and so I am about to make a second purchase. Buy without hesitation.'</p>

<p>The support pillows protect the user's head, neck and spine thanks to the generously filled hollow fibres- which are also dust mite resistant </p>

<p>Many shoppers would recommend the cushions for a peaceful night sleep but should you find them a little too bouncy then the zipper design means you can adjust the height of the pillow according to your needs, and go to sleep in the most comfortable posture.</p>

<p>One shopper likened the pillow to a 'giant fluffy marshmallow', writing: 'Finally pillows that allow me a decent nights sleep!! For years I've struggled finding pillows that haven't gone flat after a couple of days'</p>

<p>These are the answer to my prayers, and the best thing is that I only need to use one as they puff up so much and are so comfortably soft and supportive that it really is like laying my head in a fluffy marshmallow. The only downside is that I now don't want to get out of bed!!' </p>

<p>Another stated: 'You need this pillow in your life. I've just woken up from what was honestly the best sleep I've had in years and years. This pillow is supportive yet soft. I'd especially recommend for side sleepers although back sleepers will love it too.' </p>
