<p>Several women from North Shore, north of Auckland, recently reported unwanted advances after filling out contact tracing forms.</p>

<p>One of the customers received a text message after a visit to Countdown in Glenfield.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old left her contact details on a sign in sheet at the store entry on the weekend after forgetting to bring her phone to the shops.</p>

<p>One of the customers received a text message after a visit to Countdown in Glenfield, (pictured) the New Zealand equivalent of Woolworths</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning she was horrified to receive a text message from an unknown number.</p>

<p>'Hey hw r u,' the message read.</p>

<p>When she asked who sent the message she was advised they had gotten her number from a 'covid tracer form'.</p>

<p>She immediately deleted the text message and blocked the phone number.</p>

<p>The shopper was concerned whoever contacted her may have photographed the entire sign-in sheet.</p>

<p>'It's a bit scary to get text messages like that, especially that someone thinks it is appropriate to take your information off something like that,' she told the New Zealand Herald.  </p>

<p>But she laid blame on the supermarket chain for failing to protect the privacy of its customers.</p>

<p>'And it should be enough for stores to know it shouldn't be displayed out in the open,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'm good at keeping things quite private but to think it could get into the hands of the wrong person … You never know what people will do.'</p>

<p>Countdown has urged customers to respect the privacy of other shoppers while using contact tracing forms. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for Countdown told the New Zealand Herald they would be happy to look into the shopper's concern and notify police.</p>

<p>The spokesperson said paper forms were under close supervision from supermarket staff before being locked away in the office.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile the Office of the Privacy Commissioner is urging residents to use the NZ COVID Tracer app as the best method for tracking their movement</p>

<p>The office has encouraged the shopper to lodge a complaint with the business over the incident. </p>

<p>If the situation was unable to be resolved, the complaint could be escalated to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.   </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Countdown for comment.</p>

<p>A similar incident was reported in May after a customer was contacted by a Subway employee who had visited one of their franchises in North Shore.</p>

<p>The staff member who took the customer's order was fired after reaching out to her on social media.</p>

<p>He sent her an email, text message and requests on Facebook and Instagram after taking her details from a sign-in sheet.</p>

<p>The sandwich chain now operates a digitised contact-tracing system which is inaccessible to employees.   </p>
