<p>An abandoned German Shepherd-mix has adopted a litter of three orphaned kittens (pictured together) after tragically losing her own puppies</p>

<p>Touching footage showed, Georgia (pictured with one of the kittens), who was found in July by volunteers from Sunshine Dog Rescue of Phoenix, Arizona, after surviving on scraps near the US-Mexico border, caring for the kittens like they are her own young</p>

<p>The dog was pregnant when she was taken in by the non-profit organisation, but on August 13 her puppies were born prematurely and sadly all passed away. Pictured: The three kittens cosying up next to Georgia</p>

<p>Talking about Georgia's reaction to losing her puppies, Anita said: 'The best way I could describe it was that she was frantic. It was so sad, she was looking for those babies.</p>

<p>'She tore up the toddler mattress we had her on, trying to find her babies,' she recalled.</p>

<p>Explaining her decision to introduce Georgia to the kittens, Anita said it was 'amazing' to see how the animals instantly calmed one another down. </p>

<p>Despite the tragedy, two days later founder of Sunshine Dog Rescue, Anita Osa decided to introduce Georgia to the litter of orphaned kittens (pictured together), and the group immediately hit it off</p>

<p>Talking about Georgia's reaction to losing her puppies, Anita said: 'The best way I could describe it was that she was frantic. It was so sad, she was looking for those babies'. Pictured, the kittens climbing over Georgia</p>

<p>Explaining her decision to introduce Georgia to the kittens (pictured together), Anita said it was 'amazing' to see how the animals instantly calmed one another down</p>

<p>'I introduced the kittens to her gently,' she recalled. 'I first brought one in and let her sniff it, and she seemed to accept it, so I brought the others out.</p>

<p>'It was amazing to see how Georgia instantly calmed down, and I think for the kittens, they have no idea that she is a dog.'</p>

<p>Shortly after their introduction, all the members of the newly-formed family were adopted and Georgia has even gone to live with one of her kittens.</p>
