<p>Unmasked: He was revealed as Puppet during Monday's episode of The Masked Singer, but Simon Pryce said his young fans actually worked out that he was under the costume a long time ago</p>

<p>Speaking about his costume on the show, Simon revealed he never expected judge Dannii Minogue to be so scared of Puppet.</p>

<p>He said the hardest part about appearing on the show was 'not being able to talk to anyone', and admitted the group performance was bizarre.</p>

<p>'You don't know who anybody is. Then all of a sudden, when you do a group number, you're all there on stage together and you do an awkward little wave to each other,' he said. </p>

<p>Guessing game: Appearing on The Project on Tuesday, the 48-year-old Wiggles member confessed he had parents telling him their kids had already worked it out</p>

<p>'You can't talk. You've got all your costumes on and you stand there awkwardly looking at each other.'</p>

<p>The beloved children's entertainer confessed his costume was especially heavy, making it difficult for him to move and see.</p>

<p>'The head weighed about 20 kilos and it had a big metal bar that moulded to a brace. Every time my mouth closed, I couldn't see, because that's where my view was,' he explained. </p>

<p>'Well, I'll tell you what, I will never complain about wearing a skivvy ever again!' he joked after taking off his mask. Pictured second from right with The Wiggles</p>

<p>And while she may not have been Puppet's biggest fan, Dannii, 48, was the only judge who guessed his identity correctly before the big reveal.</p>

<p>The performer admitted that the Puppet costume was a lot more restrictive than the famous red outfit he wears with The Wiggles.</p>

<p>'Well, I'll tell you what, I will never complain about wearing a skivvy ever again!' he joked after taking off his mask. </p>
