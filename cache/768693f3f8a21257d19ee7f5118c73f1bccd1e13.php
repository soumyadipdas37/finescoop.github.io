<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It was New York Fashion Week, but not as we know it. </p>

<p>Due to the pandemic things were a little different to previous years, with many designers choosing to go digital only or to put on small presentations.</p>

<p>And while there wasn't the usual international jetset fashion crowd roaming the streets of the Big Apple, there were still quite a few front row mavens kicking around.</p>

<p>Not to mention the odd model travelling between presentations. </p>

<p>So we still got a bit of New York street style and for that we're grateful. We need the new season inspiration and these beauties certainly provided it. </p>

<p>Boots (made for strutting)</p>

<p>Ah, we love a great pair of boots.</p>

<p>And at NYFW, it was ALL about the boots. That's why we're starting with pictures of calves and ankles!</p>

<p>You may notice a theme with this autumn's footwear too. </p>

<p>The western boot trend was big at NYFW</p>

<p>The western boot trend was big at NYFW</p>

<p>There's a major cowboy / western vibe going on and we like it.</p>

<p>So whether it's a western heel, the curved tops of cowboy boots or that unmistakable detailing on the ankle and foot, it's all about playing with the prairie trend.</p>

<p>Oh and if you can do it with a flash of white and a slouchy calf high style, you'll have nailed AW20 with ease.</p>

<p>Wear them with midi dresses, mini skirts, shorts and jeans! Yee haaa!</p>

<p>Luxe leather</p>

<p>Leather looked good at NYFW</p>

<p>Whether it's the real deal or faux, leather is here to stay this autumn </p>

<p>Leather was a major trend on the AW20 catwalks so it's no surprise to see so many of New York's stylistas rocking it this season.</p>

<p>Leather is great because it not only makes every outfit look a little bit more expensive (even if it's faux), but it adds a bit of a tougher edge to proceedings too. </p>

<p>And it translates so beautifully into so many different pieces. We love the leg baring leather shorts and skirts on display in New York, and what about this great oversized, tailored blazer?</p>

<p>It just goes to show a leather jacket doesn't need to be a biker.</p>

<p>And these brown leather trousers remind us it also doesn't have to be black.</p>

<p>So get creative and start adding in some leather pieces to your wardrobe. It works particularly well with contrasting textures like wool, which is just as well as winter approaches.</p>

<p>Modern tailoring </p>

<p>Girls in suits = super fly </p>

<p>We've always had a thing for a pretty girl in a boyish suit.</p>

<p>It's just a great combination and these fashion fans worked the look in their own unique ways which we love.</p>

<p>There was a lot of oversized tailoring around which is ace if you like to mess about with proportions. And if the abs and confidence allows then we're all for a suit with only lingerie or a cropped top underneath.</p>

<p>Plus, as these three (above) prove, you can wear a suit with any style of footwear, from trainers all the way to stiletto sandals, so just make it work for you and your day.</p>

<p>Tailoring but different </p>

<p>And there are no hard and fast rules. Short suits are still a big look and great for transitional weeks of the year.</p>

<p>And you don't have to match the top and the bottom. Why not pair a buttoned up, slightly longer length blazer with wide leg trousers, jeans or leggings?</p>

<p>Or just with cut off hot pants? With those legs we definitely would.</p>

<p>Bag it</p>

<p>Accessorise in style this season</p>

<p>The women of New York Fashion Week were really killing it with their accessories.</p>

<p>First the boots, now the bags.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a return to slightly smaller bags, despite the trend for big old arm candy. </p>

<p>But they couldn't be boring. They had insect clasps or slogans and many were bright and bold, to really draw the eye.</p>

<p>Belt bags are still a thing</p>

<p>And love them or hate them, belt bags (AKA bum bags) are still a thing. They do leave your hands totally free so that is a definite benefit.</p>

<p>These two couldn't be further from the 90s nylon pouches though. </p>

<p>They're so much smarter, so much more chic and we have to say we LOVE that minty green version. It even has a separate pocket for your phone.</p>

<p>A new classic!</p>

<p>Liking the look of those New York style gurus?</p>

<p>Us too and they're all easier to achieve than you might think.</p>
