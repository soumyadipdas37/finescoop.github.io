<p>Night on the town: Teaming his smart suit with a powder blue shirt, the Harry Brown star used a walking stick as he made his way to a cab ahead of being whisked off home</p>

<p>Former British Army solider Caine has been walking with the aid of a stick since a nasty fall on a patch of ice in 2018, leaving him with an ankle injury.</p>

<p>'Michael slipped and broke his ankle in his garden during the recent heavy snow,' his spokesperson told The Mirror at the time. 'He is in fine health and great spirits.'</p>

<p>Last year, the veteran British actor revealed how he met the love of his life after seeing her star in a coffee commercial.</p>

<p>'I was at home and this commercial came on, for Maxwell House coffee. And there was this beautiful Brazilian girl,' he told Andrew Denton's Interview.</p>

<p>True love: Caine married his stunning spoude in 1973, and the couple celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary in January. Pictured together in May 2019 </p>

<p>'I said to my mate "we're going to Brazil tomorrow - I have plenty of money, we're going to find her".'</p>

<p>Much to the actor's surprise, though, was the fact his dream woman was not on the other side of the world but instead a stone's throw away from where he was living.</p>

<p>'I got all excited and said let's go down to the tavern to have a drink and this other guy comes in. He said "we made that commercial - she's not in Brazil, she's on the Fulham Road" which is about a mile away from me.'</p>

<p>Michael called his future bride 11 times before she agreed to go out with him.</p>

<p>Michael married Shakira in 1973 and they have one daughter together, Natasha, 47. He has another daughter Nikki, 63, from his previous marriage with actress Patricia Haines.</p>
