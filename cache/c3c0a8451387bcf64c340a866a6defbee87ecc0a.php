<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich refuses to sell players to the club's bitter rivals Tottenham.</p>

<p>The Blues and Tottenham share hostility as local rivals, and the Russian owner who bought the Stamford Bridge club in 2003, continues to make sure that rivalry is kept alive.</p>

<p>Former player Carlton Cole has told the story of how Abramovich stopped the striker from moving to Spurs, even after he had already completed a medical.</p>

<p>Carlton Cole almost left Chelsea to join rivals Tottenham before the move was called off</p>

<p>Owner Roman Abramovich called Cole at the last second to tell him the move wouldn't happen</p>

<p>He told Talksport as per the Daily Mirror: 'I almost joined Spurs. I went and did my medical and everything.</p>

<p>'Roman Abramovich found out and he said ‘you've got to come back, you’re not joining them’. He said 'you can’t go to Spurs, I don’t do business with them'.'</p>

<p>The only player to leave Chelsea for Tottenham since 2003 was goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, who left on a free transfer in 2009.</p>

<p>Cole came through the youth academy at Chelsea making his first-team debut in 2002.</p>

<p>The Englishman eventually left for one of Chelsea's other London rivals, West Ham, in 2006 after making 31 appearances for the Blues.</p>

<p>However this came after Abramovich proposed a very different career path for Cole by suggesting a move abroad. </p>

<p>Cole was eventually joined West Ham despite Abramovich suggesting a move abroad</p>

<p>He said: ''I've got an alternative for you' (said Abramovich). I drive back to Stamford Bridge with my uncle and my dad.</p>

<p>'He had his interpreter with him. Roman Abramovich was there, we were talking. I was saying 'where am I going?'</p>

<p>'He said, 'I will give you a new contract but you've got to go to CSKA Moscow' - his other team.</p>

<p>'I was trying to get into the England team. Those days you could not go abroad. If you go abroad you don't get in the England team. So I said to him, 'I ain't going to CSKA Moscow, pal.'"  </p>
