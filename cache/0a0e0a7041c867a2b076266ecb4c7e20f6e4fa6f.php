<p>To make the elaborate dish, Amanda said you'll need a few pantry staples like flour, eggs, extra Virgin olive oil and garlic.</p>

<p>As well as this, she also got her hands some items you might not have on hand, like Aldi's $6 truffle brie and beef.</p>

<p>'I definitely recommend the truffle brie for indulgent cheesy or creamy sauces,' Amanda told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'Aldi's blue cheese is a big hit at our house too.'</p>

<p>You'll be making your own pasta with the flour, eggs and olive oil, as well as your own filling for the ravioli (pictured after being made)</p>

<p>You'll be making your own pasta with the flour, eggs and olive oil, as well as your own filling for the ravioli - which consists of butter, button mushrooms, garlic and beef. </p>

<p>Hundreds who saw Amanda's impressive meal on Facebook said they couldn't wait to try it for themselves at home.</p>

<p>'This looks absolutely divine!' one commenter posted.</p>

<p>'Finally someone shows us a home-cooked meal. Love it. Thanks for sharing,' another added.</p>

<p>You need to cook the ravioli quickly in a pan of boiling water that has lots of salt inside it (the pasta pictured being cooked)</p>

<p>Serves four </p>

<p>INGREDIENTS </p>

<p>Amanda shared the recipe for her meal with FEMAIL (the finished result pictured)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Three quarters of a kilo of flour</p></li>
<li><p>Three large eggs</p></li>
</ul>

<p>* 1.5 tablespoons of extra Virgin olive oil</p>

<ul>
<li><p>80-100mL of water</p></li>
<li><p>Four 'good size' button mushrooms</p></li>
</ul>

<p>* 150-200 grams of beef </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Butter</p></li>
<li><p>3-4 tablespoons of minced garlic</p></li>
</ul>

<p>* 100-150mL of red wine </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Salt and pepper</p></li>
<li><p>Aldi truffle brie</p></li>
<li><p>Parmesan</p></li>
<li><p>Parsley</p></li>
</ul>

<p>METHOD</p>

<p>For the pasta</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sift around half to three quarters of a kilogram of plain flour, into a well.</p></li>
<li><p>Add in three large eggs, around 1.5 tablespoons of extra Virgin olive oil and around 40mL of water. Lightly whisk the eggs with a fork and start to bring in some of the flour.</p></li>
<li><p>When it's 'runny and sticky', add another 40mL of water and bring in enough flour so that it starts to resemble a dough.</p></li>
<li><p>Have more water ready, because from here it's all about adding in little bits of water as is needed to get the rest of the flour into the dough without it becoming breadcrumbs.</p></li>
<li><p>When you've got a nice firm yet workable dough, cover it, so it's protected from the air drying out and then set it aside.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the filling</p>

<p>1. Slice four 'good size; button mushrooms as thin as possible and cut them into 'sticks'.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Do the same with around 150-200 grams of beef.</li>
</ol>

<p>3. Crank a good frying pan up on medium-high to high heat. Add a little olive oil, butter and about 3-4 tablespoons of minced garlic.</p>

<p>4. Fry off the mushrooms quickly until they're flexible. Remove them from the pan and set aside.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li><p>Cook off about 100-150mL of red wine, add the beef, toss it a couple of times and just brown the outside of it.  </p></li>
<li><p>Remove it and add the mushrooms. Set aside. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the finishing touches of the ravioli</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get a big pot of water boiling, add lots of salt and while you're doing this, roll out your dough with a wine bottle until it's about 1-1.5mm thick.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a measuring cup to cut out your over-sized ravioli and put enough filling inside that you've got a delicious bite, letting the juice run off the filling before you put it in the pasta so you don't end up with a soggy mess.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the 'pasta lids' on top and push around with a fork to seal it. Be firm, it needs to seal the ravioli without cutting it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the sauce</p>

<p>1. In a saucepan on low-medium heat, melt some salted butter and add some garlic depending on taste.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><p>Cut off the very outer film part of Aldi's truffle brie, break up the whole triangle and put in half of your cream. Add parsley and Parmesan to taste.</p></li>
<li><p>When all of the brie is definitely melted and you can see the brown truffle flecks swimming around, add in the rest of your cream. Turn the sauce right down to the lowest heat and keep your eye on it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>4. Put the pasta in the water, once it floats scoop it out, drain it and put it into the sauce. </p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Pour yourself a glass of wine and serve hot. </li>
</ol>

<p>Hundreds who saw the finished result (pictured) said they couldn't wait to try it for themselves and that the dish (pictured) looked divine</p>

<p>This isn't the only gourmet Aldi meal Amanda makes with Aldi ingredients.</p>

<p>The mum-of-three said she is also a huge fan of the discount store's budget rib-eye steaks, which she pairs with another favourite buy: the Aldi blue cheese.</p>

<p>'It's just good to see people making something from Aldi that isn't the garlic dip pizza,' Amanda said.</p>

<p>'The dish was a huge success in our household.' </p>
