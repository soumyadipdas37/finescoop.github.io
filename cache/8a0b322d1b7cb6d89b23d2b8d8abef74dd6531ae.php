<p>In the clip taken at eSalon in the city Monday afternoon and obtained by Fox News the Democrat is seen with wet hair as she is followed closely behind by a stylist, who is in a face covering. </p>

<p>Salons in San Francisco have been closed since March and were only told they could reopen Tuesday; they can still only offer outside styling.  </p>

<p>Pelosi's spokesperson told Fox News: 'This business offered for the Speaker to come in on Monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business. The Speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment.' </p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi got a blowout at a San Francisco salon closed under COVID rules and was filmed inside the store without a mask, footage released Tuesday reveals</p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle tweeted about the incident Tuesday </p>

<p>Appearing to contradict the images taken inside the salon they added: 'The Speaker always wears a mask and complies with local COVID requirements.' </p>

<p>But the salon owner, Erica Kious, told Fox: 'It was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can't work.</p>

<p>'I have been fighting for six months for a business that took me 12 years to build to reopen. I am a single mom, I have two small children, and I have no income.' </p>

<p>House Speaker Pelosi has berated Donald Trump for not wearing a mask. After the president was pictured not wearing a mask in May Pelosi said: 'It's a vanity thing, I guess, with him.' The president on Tuesday retweeted Fox's link to the story.</p>

<p>In July she announced that all members will be required to wear a mask when voting on the House floor. </p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle tweeted about the incident Tuesday, writing: 'Between gourmet ice cream and private salon blowouts, Nancy Pelosi seems to really be enjoying life as Americans suffer.'</p>

<p>In April Pelosi had showed off a selection of pricey ice creams on James Corden's 'Late Late Show' while Democrats were refusing to refill the coffers of the Paycheck Protection Program without additional funds for state governments and hospitals.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign latched onto the clip pointing out that Pelosi was 'eating $13-a-pint ice cream out of her $24,000 fridge.' </p>

<p>The salon owner, Erica Kious, said: 'It was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can't work'</p>

<p>Mom of two Kious, who rents chair space to independent stylists, said she received a message from one Sunday night to say the Democrat's team had been in touch about an appointment.  </p>

<p>She added: ''We're supposed to look up to this woman, right? It is just disturbing.</p>

<p>'We have been shut down for so long, not just me, but most of the small businesses and I just can't – it's a feeling – a feeling of being deflated, helpless and honestly beaten down.' </p>
