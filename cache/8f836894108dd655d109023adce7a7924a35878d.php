<p>Style: The beauty, 26, displayed her ample cleavage and taut midriff in a tiny strapless black crop-top as she strutted down the street</p>

<p>Stunning: Maya looked stunning as she enjoyed a night on the town in the capital</p>

<p>The Vossi Bop hitmaker, 27, referred their romance in his 2019 song Lessons, but Maya insisted that it comes with the territory if you date a musician.  </p>

<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A with singer Madison Beer as quoted by The Sun, Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it’s like, "This is this, it’s everybody’s business".'</p>

<p>Stormzy's song, which featured on his Heady Is The Head album, directly name-check's Maya and their split.  </p>

<p>He raps: 'Fast forward now, my nephew’s still asking for his Auntie Maya, guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya. </p>

<p>'I just stood and let it burn, I couldn’t down the fire. Lord, I pray you make it easy, that’s my one desire.'</p>

<p>Gorgeous: Her raven tresses were styled in soft waves while fluttery lashes and rose lipstick accentuated her pretty features</p>

<p>Spotlight: The star showed off her toned figure as she stepped out </p>

<p> Maya has since been linked to Drake, who reportedly first contacted the TV star in 2018, but she ignored his messages as she was still dating Stormzy at the time.</p>

<p>The God's Plan hitmaker, 33, even provoked Maya's ex Stormzy in a new song where he refers to the TV presenter as a 'sweet one'.</p>

<p>A source said: 'Drake definitely appeared to have a soft spot for Maya and late in 2018 he started following her on Instagram out of the blue. She totally ignored him and didn’t follow him back as she was with Stormzy.</p>

<p>Expected: The outing comes as Maya recently revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs (pictured in 2017)</p>

<p>'Even when she split with Stormzy it’s not something Maya wanted to pursue and she has left it.'  </p>

<p>Drake's jibe on rapper Headie One’s track Only You Freestyle comes after Stormzy declared that he still 'wholeheartedly' loves Maya earlier this year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Stormzy's new romance with Victoria's Secret model Yasmine Holmgren is going from strength to strength as it was revealed last month that the pair enjoyed a secret reunion in London once lockdown ended.</p>

<p>All over: Maya split from the rapper in August last year after four years together 9pictured in February 2017)</p>
