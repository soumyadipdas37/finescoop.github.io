<p>Working on her fitness: Coleen Rooney was seen enjoying some alone time on Tuesday morning, when she was spotted heading to the gym in Cheshire</p>

<p>Rounding out her casual ensemble with a pair of running shoes, the mother-of-four wore her brunette tresses in a ponytail, while she went makeup-free.</p>

<p>Accessorising with dazzling diamond stud earrings, the Liverpudlian juggled her coffee, protective face mask and smartphone as she headed to her workout.  </p>

<p>Coleen's very public feud began when she accused Rebekah, wife of footballer Jamie Vardy, of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies.  </p>

<p>Full of beans: The 34-year-old wife of footballer Wayne Rooney looked ready for her workout session as she donned a black hoodie and leggings while grabbing pre-gym coffee</p>

<p>It has since been claimed that Coleen wants to undertake 'forensic analysis' of Rebekah's electronics to look for evidence, according to a report from The Sun.</p>

<p>A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'Coleen met with her lawyers and they’ve told her they need to continue putting together more evidence.</p>

<p>'She needs to prove that Becky was directly responsible for the leaks or, at the very least, that the information came from her social media account.  </p>

<p>'Coleen is adamant she is right, but in a legal setting the evidence she has may not be enough to cross the threshold.'  </p>

<p>Casually cool: Rounding out her casual ensemble with a pair of running shoes, the mother-of-four wore her brunette tresses in a ponytail, while she went makeup-free</p>

<p>It was also claimed by the publication that Coleen and her legal team will reportedly need a court order to be able to do so.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Coleen and Rebekah's representatives for comment.  </p>

<p>Coleen reportedly declared that she 'won't be bullied' by Becky when their libel case goes to court.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun that 'Coleen is totally confident. She says she won't be bullied and is ready for a scrap.'   </p>

<p>Coleen has also said she won't be intimidated by 'strong-arm tactics' saying Rebekah's attempt to hurry along legal proceedings are 'laughable'.</p>

<p>This follows further claims that Coleen said she is 'not worried at all' about Rebekah's apparent rush to bring their WAG war to court 'immediately'.  </p>

<p>According to reports, Coleen has told pals that her WAG rival is only speeding things up as she's 'concerned' what Coleen's lawyers will find. </p>

<p>Juggling: Accessorising with dazzling diamond stud earrings, the Liverpudlian juggled her coffee, protective face mask and smartphone as she headed to her workout</p>

<p>The Sun claims that amid Rebekah's apparent call for Coleen to 'put up or shut up', the Liverpool native remains confident she has an 'extremely strong case.'   </p>

<p>The publication states that Coleen has vowed to fight back against Rebekah's rush of taking things to court, and will instead spent time building a strong case. </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives of Coleen and Rebekah for comment.   </p>

<p>It comes following claims Rebekah signed legal papers in a bid to get Coleen to head to court 'immediately' amid their ongoing WAG war  </p>

<p>It was reported that Rebekah has filed the papers under the impression that Coleen is 'dragging her heels' following her bombshell accusations she has been selling stories about her to The Sun. </p>

<p>Analysis: She is set to undertake a 'forensic analysis' of WAG rival Rebekah Vardy's phone and email records ahead of their forthcoming £1million High Court showdown</p>

<p>The shock move is said to have come after Rebekah came to the conclusion that Coleen was purposefully 'dragging her heels' and wants her to 'put up or shut up' as the legal battle rumbles on. </p>

<p>According to reports, the session, which will be held later this year, will determine whether the wife of footballer Jamie Vardy was 'libelled' when Coleen accused her Instagram account of leaking stories to the press. </p>

<p>The Sun states that mum-of-five Becky's bombshell demands come after Wayne Rooney's wife has so far failed to bring forward a defence to court, with her legal team apparently requesting more time to build a case. </p>

<p>They added that if a judge finds that Coleen was directly blaming Rebekah for selling the stories, then she will have to head to court and 'prove' her claims and 'back it up' with 'evidence'. </p>

<p>Feud: It was recently claimed Coleen said she won't be intimidated by 'strong-arm tactics', saying Rebekah Vardy's (pictured in 2019) attempt to hurry legal proceedings are 'laughable'</p>

<p>MailOnline reached out to Rebekah and Coleen's representatives for comment at the time of publication.    </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Coleen was also accused of leaking stories to the press by Rebekah after she told in a bombshell legal document how she had been left suicidal by the accusation that she had leaked stories about Coleen and her family. </p>

<p>She also claimed in the document drawn up for her libel battle against Coleen that the stress of the scandal had left her fearful of losing her unborn baby at the time and suffering panic attacks that made her too scared to leave her home.</p>

<p>The I'm A Celeb star complained of being made a 'scapegoat' by her rival seeking to blame her for stories appearing when in the past Coleen had approved of her friends leaking gossip about her.</p>

<p>Tension: A source claimed 'her lawyers specialise in investigative law and they are going through every form of communication between the two and between Becky and others'</p>

<p>The document says Rebekah believes she 'has deliberately been made a scapegoat (sic) by the Defendant (Coleen) for past 'leaked' stories.' </p>

<p>It points to previous stories about Coleen and Wayne with some 'in particular about their marriage, which have in fact come from the Defendant's friends, at times even with the Defendant's approval.'  </p>

<p>The paper states that Sun journalist Dan Wootton had said on talkRADIO on October 19 last year that Coleen had 'manipulated the media to tell stories about her own life'.</p>

<p>Wootton added that he had 'written many, many stories' about her marriage and 'lots of other things around the Rooneys' that had come directly from friends of Coleen including some told 'with her (Coleen's) approval', says the document.</p>

<p>He went on to say on talkRADIO that nothing had ever come from 'any of the Vardys', it adds. </p>

<p>Rebekah describes in her document how Coleen's public denunciation of her on Instagram while she was seven months pregnant had 'gravely injured her reputation'.</p>

<p>Detailing how Coleen had 'caused her enormous distress and very extreme embarrassment', she disclosed how she had been bombarded with abuse on social media.</p>

<p>Rebekah said that the widespread damage to her reputation was illustrated by research showing her name had become a more popular search term than 'Brexit' on Google in the UK on the day the scandal broke.</p>

<p>Still waiting: The mum-of-five's alleged bombshell demands comes after Wayne Rooney's wife has so far failed to bring forward a defence to court (pictured with husband Jamie in 2018)</p>

<p>She also claimed that it led to her name appearing 276,822 times on Twitter on the same day, more than triple the number of mentions of Boris Johnson who had had his name published only 80,704 times. </p>

<p>Coleen made headlines around the world last October when she made her devastating claim that Rebekah had been leaking stories about her and her family to the Sun newspaper. </p>

<p>She released the statement: 'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account / individual it's come from.</p>

<p>'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's ……………. Rebekah Vardy's account.'</p>

<p>Rebekah immediately denied the claims and has since been fighting to clear her name and demands Coleen withdraw the claims against her.    </p>

<p>The full statement: Coleen made these shock claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and she concluded that it was Rebekah's account</p>
