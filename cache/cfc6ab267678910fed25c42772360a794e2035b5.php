<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>NSW Nationals leader and deputy premier John Barilaro has backed away from his threat to stop supporting government over the state's disputed koala protection laws.</p>

<p>The backdown comes after Premier Gladys Berejiklian demanded a commitment from the Nationals that they would stay in the Coalition Government during crisis meeting talks held on Friday morning. </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian issued a ultimatum to the deputy premier and his Nationals colleagues on Thursday after they threatened mutiny over the state's disputed koala protection policy.</p>

<p>New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian issued a stunning ultimatum to her deputy and Nationals MPson Thursday</p>

<p>Mr Barilaro blindsided Ms Berejiklian, announcing his MPs would abstain from voting on coalition bills as they fought changes to the protection plan.</p>

<p>The move effectively robbed the government of its majority and provoked a stern response from the premier.</p>

<p>'It is not possible to be the deputy premier or a minister of the Crown and sit on the crossbench', Ms Berejiklian fired off in a media statement.</p>

<p>She said Mr Barilaro and his Nationals ministerial colleagues had until Friday morning to declare support for her government or be sacked from cabinet.</p>

<p>'If required, I will attend Government House tomorrow and swear in a new ministry,' Ms Berejiklian said.</p>

<p>Mr Barilaro appeared by Friday morning to be softening his stance, telling Sydney's 2GB radio he thought the issue could be resolved but it may take time, possibly several weeks.</p>

<p>He also claimed the threat to sit on the cross bench had been misinterpreted.</p>

<p>'What we said yesterday was that no one would go physically to the cross bench,' Mr Barilaro said.</p>
