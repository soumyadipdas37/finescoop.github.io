<p>The TV presenter, 43, brought her adorable dog Shmizzels onto the show, and her pet sat happily on her lap as she chatted to co-host Sean Fletcher.</p>

<p>But she didn't realise that her dogs tag was fully visible on screen, which meant her details, including her phone number could be seen.</p>

<p>Oops: Good Morning Britain's Ranvir Singh accidentally revealed her home address and phone number on her dog's collar while taking care of him on Monday's show</p>

<p>Ranvir brought on Shmizzles because there was no one at home to take care of him, as she said: 'I thought until 10 o clock it's a bit mean to leave a dog alone, isn't it?' </p>

<p>Sean concurred as he commented on how young he was, adding: 'Whereas I have a nine year old dog and he's alright.'</p>

<p>Things took an amusing turn when Ranvir had to apologise for her dog's display of affection with Sean before they went on air.</p>

<p>'I've just had to apologise, there was a rather over-amorous incident that occurred this morning, completely not of Sean's doing,' she explained. 'I'm sorry you were humped by my dog, I apologise.'</p>

<p>Thoughtful: Ranvir brought on Shmizzles because there was no one at home to take care of him, as she said: 'I thought until 10 o clock it's a bit mean to leave a dog alone, isn't it?'</p>

<p>Mistake: But she didn't realise that her dogs tag was fully visible on screen, which meant her details, including her phone number could be seen</p>

<p>Awkward: Things took an amusing turn when Ranvir had to apologise for her dog's overly-amorous display of affection with Sean before they went on air</p>

<p>Viewers were understandably concerned with the fact that Ranvir had accidentally broadcast her address to the world, as they took to Twitter to inform her.</p>

<p>One person wrote: '<?php echo e('@'); ?>GMB everyone knows where Ranvir Singh lives, thanks to the dog collar.'</p>

<p>While another added: 'Gorgeous dog Ranvir did you realise you just gave all the viewers your address on his ID tag (sic).' </p>

<p>And one joked: 'ranvir on good morning britain just showed her whole home address on her dogs collar tag bro you just got doxed by a dog (sic).'</p>

<p>Helping out: Viewers were understandably concerned with the fact that Ranvir had accidentally broadcast her address to the world, as they took to Twitter to inform her</p>

<p>Last week, Adil Ray revealed the abuse he, Alex Beresford and Sean have had to deal with during their presenting stints on Good Morning Britain.</p>

<p>The presenter, 46,  spoke candidly about the racist trolling the GMB presenters are subjected to online during Wednesday's edition of the show, and insisted while there have been some improvements with representation, more needs to be done. </p>

<p>Speaking on the ITV breakfast show, Adil - who has been co-hosting during Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid's summer break - began on a positive note: 'There have been changes on screen and we recognise that - I mean, we're here right now.</p>

<p>'Even though it's not permanent jobs, things have definitely changed.'</p>

<p>Disappointing: Last week, Adil Ray revealed the abuse he, Alex Beresford and Sean have had to deal with during their presenting stints on Good Morning Britain</p>

<p>His co-presenter Ranvir pointed out that there is a lot of 'nonsense' that BAME people suffer on social media. </p>

<p>She added: 'You do get trolled for it - you get a lot of Twitter nonsense. You were reading out a lot this morning, I don't know if you want to go into it.' </p>

<p>Adil responded: 'Oh we do get trolled for it. I don't want to go into it, but I know Alex Beresford and Sean Fletcher got it last week. We are part of the change.' </p>

<p>Representation: Adil began on a positive note: 'There have been changes on screen and we recognise that - I mean, we're here right now' (pictured: Alex on Friday)</p>

<p>The Citizen Khan actor tried to focus on the positives, and 'the amount of love' he's felt from most viewers. </p>

<p>He explained: 'We do get grief on television, it's part of the job. But what I've done over the past seven weeks on this show, is concentrate on the amount of love. </p>

<p>'I spend less time on social media and just learnt to ignore the minority views and embrace the love.' </p>

<p>Struggle: However, Adil claimed, 'we do get trolled for it. I don't want to go into it, but I know Alex Beresford and Sean Fletcher (pictured) got it last week'</p>
