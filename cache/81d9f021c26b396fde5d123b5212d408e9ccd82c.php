<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are reportedly set to table a take-it-or-leave-it £90million offer for Jadon Sancho.</p>

<p>United have been chasing Sancho all summer but have been unable to reach an agreement with Borussia Dormtund, who have remained firm on their £108m asking price for the forward.</p>

<p>But according to Mirror Sport, the Red Devils will issue a final offer of £75m up front with a further £15m in add-ons and claim Ed Woodward will inform the Bundesliga side there will be no negotiating over the fee or structure of the deal.</p>

<p>Manchester United are set to table a take-it-or-leave-it £90million offer for Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>Ed Woodward will tell Borussia Dortmund the fee and payment structure is not negotiable </p>

<p>United face a battle to get a deal done before the October 5 deadline with both the Premier League and Bundesliga seasons already underway.</p>

<p>The club made a breakthrough in talks over Sancho's wages and the agents' fees earlier this month but have so far been unable to bring down the price for the England international. </p>

<p>Dortmund's director Sebastian Kehl said earlier this week that Sancho would not be sold in a cut-price deal. </p>

<p>United face a battle to get a deal done before the October 5 with Dortmund wanting £108m</p>

<p>Suggesting that United had made a bid in the region of £73million for the former Manchester City starlet, Kehl told Sport 1: 'We agreed that we had to show a certain attitude. And €80m are simply not enough for such a player. </p>

<p>'We owed that to the club and the fans. I don't want to give him up either. Without Jadon this team is worse.'</p>

<p>Sancho has had a flying start to the season for the German side with a goal and two assists in their opening two fixtures.</p>

<p>In the 2019-2020 campaign, the forward contributed 20 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances as Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga.</p>

<p>United have alternative options but the 20-year-old is still their No1 target. The club are locked in negotiations with Porto over left back Alex Telles who is out of contract next summer.</p>

<p>They are hoping to bring down the Portuguese side's £17m asking price while holding out for an £18m bid from Roma for Chris Smalling - who is looking to seal a move back to the Serie A side.</p>
