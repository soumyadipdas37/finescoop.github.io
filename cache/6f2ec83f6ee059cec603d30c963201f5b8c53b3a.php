<p>The 50 First Dates star - who split from husband Will Kopelman in 2016 - had a go with celebrity dating app Raya, but it didn't go as planned for her as she was stood up by a potential suitor.</p>

<p>'I got stood up. I didn't match with anyone and my friends gave me this sort of bloated sense of false confidence. They were like, "You should try it. You will do great." It was a car wreck ...' she said during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.</p>

<p>Not nice! Drew Barrymore's experience with dating apps was a 'car wreck.' The 50 First Dates star had a go with celebrity dating app Raya, but it didn't go as planned for her as she was stood up by a potential suitor</p>

<p>False hope: 'I got stood up. I didn't match with anyone and my friends gave me this sort of bloated sense of false confidence. They were like, "You should try it. You will do great,"' she said</p>

<p>She noted that the man who stood her up was not a celebrity but rather a restaurateur. </p>

<p>'I definitely had fun with it. And I've always wanted to go on a blind date but my life got in the way of that,' noted the ET star.</p>

<p>'So, I thought online dating my satiate that desire. Yeah no, it was a real wakeup call.'</p>

<p>She also said there were plenty of other celebrities on the site, saying it was like 'looking through UsWeekly' and she was stunned.</p>

<p>It was fun: 'I definitely had fun with it. And I've always wanted to go on a blind date but my life got in the way of that,' noted the ET star</p>

<p>Who, Drew? She also said there were plenty of other celebrities on the site, saying it was like 'looking through UsWeekly' and she was stunned And the star admitted that it was 'not fun' that she was not sharing the names of the men but that she was not going to list them</p>

<p>And the star admitted that it was 'not fun' that she was not sharing the names of the men but that she was not going to list them.</p>

<p>In the past, Ben Affleck and Channing Tatum have admitted to being on dating apps as have Demi Lovato, Amy Schumer and Sharon Stone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Drew previously admitted she has been sworn off men.</p>

<p>Thanks but no thanks: It does not sound like she will go on a dating app again. 'Yeah no, it was a real wakeup call,' she said</p>

<p>Still stunning! The star looked pretty in a floral print silk dress with her hair worn down</p>

<p>The Santa Clarita Diet star said: 'I'm not closed for business but I have been exactly in that mentality for the past five years, thinking I just don't have the bandwidth, I don't know if I'm willing to open up, I just can't fit it in.'</p>

<p>Back in 2018, Drew revealed she has come off dating sites.</p>

<p>She said: 'I got off [dating apps]. It was fun to try though. I've been working out there in the public since I was young so that myth of the blind date alluded me and I always wanted to do it so that was like a dating app for me. </p>

<p>Great shape: Barrymore has stayed slender after two kids: here she is seen at the Launch of The Drew Barrymore Show at The Empire State Building on September 14, 2020</p>

<p>'But then it's not blind on my side so it just, I don't know, doesn't work.'</p>

<p>And, even though she was desperate to get out there again after her split, Drew - who has Olive, seven, and Frankie, six - was shocked that none of her friends attempted to set her up with anyone.</p>

<p>She explained: 'None of my friends ever set me up! I think I have the same old friends for so long, were all in such a rhythm, we don't even think like that.'</p>
