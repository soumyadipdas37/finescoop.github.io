<p>It may look and move like a scorpion, but this $3,999 chair is the ultimate gaming or work station. A US firm unveiled the Scorpion Computer Cockpit that is powered with a push of a button, allowing the user to transform the design to fit their needs</p>

<p>CNET first spotted the cockpit in Alibaba, the Scorpion Computer Cockpit includes a desk attached to a chair, along with a mount for one ultra-wide 49-inch monitor or three screens no more than 27 inches each – all are attached to the end of the tail.</p>

<p>The e-commerce site, however, lists the chair for just $1,999 – which is much cheaper than what is shown on Cluvens' company website.</p>

<p>'This is our new model of the year 2020 that's in the shape of a scorpion. Comfortable recline up to 170 degrees,' the website states.</p>

<p>'The chair and desk are electrically controlled with one touch.'</p>

<p>There is also a 'zero gravity' position that is a slight tilt or a 170 degree include for a 'flat' position.</p>

<p>Users can choose from six different poses, including positioning the screen at a 45 degree angle, a 75 degree angle and raising the chair for a reclining layout. </p>

<p>The firm and Alibab are currently taking pre-orders for the Scorpion Cockpit, but both note the chair is estimated to shop in three to six week, with an installation time of one to two hours for two people.</p>
