<p>To which Mark added: 'And that's the best thing about you Millie, if you don't know Millie and you're listening right now and watching it, she's obviously one of the most talented actors to come out of this country for sure.</p>

<p>Millie said: 'It was amazing, it was so fun, obviously I was literally meeting up with your family whilst I was filming and they saw some nights, I was definitely more tired than I've ever worked before.</p>

<p>'I was definitely pushing myself through, it was challenging but I absolutely enjoyed every second of it, it was so much fun.'</p>

<p>With Mark adding: 'I can vouch for that because I remember being at your house in the UK and it was about 11:30 at night maybe, I'd been there a few hours, had some food with your mum and dad, and you still weren't home.</p>

<p>The star admitted that she didn't even think she would be 'old enough' to serve as a producer and it was her father who suggested she be part of the production.</p>

<p>She revealed: 'Well, when I read the book, I knew I wanted to bring this to life.</p>

<p>'My dad and I, and my older sister Paige, we came together with our production company, PCMA and we found a studio to then make the film, Legendary, and then we found a writer and a director. </p>

<p>'My family and I really begun this journey of Enola so that's how it come along. My dad said to me, you should be part of the production.</p>

<p>'I was like, "Is that even a thing? Is that allowed, how old do you have to be to be a producer? I thought there was an age limit" and he was like, "No I bet you there isn't" so I was like, "alright!"</p>

<p>'So we've got a producer credit, this is the role I'm taking, and I put my head down, I went on set, and I basically was behind the production as well as being on screen.'</p>

<p>Sharing her accomplishment, she said: 'It was definitely a bigger role than I've ever taken before but I was very very excited and threw myself into it.'  </p>
