<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She will soon be very busy presenting the upcoming series of Strictly Come Dancing.</p>

<p>And Claudia Winkleman let her hair down before the most manic time in her work calendar as she stepped out for dinner at Annabel's in Mayfair on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The presenter, 48, looked stylish in a cream and black stripped jumper and black trousers as she left the swanky eatery.  </p>

<p>Claudia opted for a very bronzed makeup look and highlighted her pretty features with her trademark dark eye liner.</p>

<p>Eve, 74, also looked chic in an all-black ensemble which she teamed with a cream trench coat.  </p>

<p>Like mother like daughter: Eve, 74, also looked chic in an all-black ensemble which she teamed with a cream trench coat</p>

<p>Earlier this summer Claudia confessed she does not take her Strictly Come Dancing position for granted as she admitted she fears for her job. </p>

<p>In an interview with Daily Star Sunday, the host - who reportedly earns £450,000 a year - explained: 'If they'll have me, I'll keep doing it. But I assume I'll be fired any minute'. </p>

<p>Claudia surprisingly revealed she has never tuned in to watch herself, insisting: 'I can't or I'd be sick, I can't imagine how irritating I am'.  </p>

<p>Glowing: The presenter, 48, looked stylish in a cream and black stripped jumper and black trousers as she left the swanky eatery</p>

<p>Fun: The pair looked in high spirits as they left the restaurant in central London together on Tuesday night</p>

<p>Autumn style: Claudia looked relaxed but chic in the jumper and black jeans combo for her night out</p>

<p>The brunette beauty has worked on television for over 30 years and is undoubtedly an extremely talented presenter.</p>

<p>However, the mother-of-three has put a great deal of her success down to 'luck'. She said: 'I feel I have already had too long a run. I am incredibly lucky'.</p>

<p>Strictly Come Dancing will be back on screens on the BBC this autumn and will be presented by Claudia and Tess Daly. </p>

<p>Home time: The presenter was out and about with her mother, with the pair seeming leaving in separate directions from the bar </p>

<p>Something to look forward to: Strictly Come Dancing will be back on screens on the BBC this autumn and will be presented by Claudia and Tess Daly </p>
