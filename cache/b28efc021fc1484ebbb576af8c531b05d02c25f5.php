<p>The Gunners are trying to free up funds in order to buy Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey and Lyon ace Houssem Aouar.</p>

<p>And according to Football London, The French champions are ready to bid £30million for Guendouzi. </p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain are considering a bid for Arsenal midfielder Matteo Guendouzi this year</p>

<p>Arsenal have already discussed the option of signing Partey in exchange for Gunners duo Matteo Guendouzi and Alexandre Lacazette.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old Ghanaian international Partey is Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's top transfer target this summer, and can leave his current club if his £44m release clause is triggered.</p>

<p>With the player himself said to be open to making the move, Gunners' chiefs have offered Atletico the French pair in a potential swap deal - though the LaLiga side are not said to be keen on Lacazette in particular at this moment in time.  </p>

<p>Guendouzi has been absent from the Gunners squad following ugly scenes involving Brighton striker Neal Maupay in their defeat at the Amex last season following the restart and has fallen out of favour with boss Mikel Arteta.</p>

<p>That appears to have continued into this season after he was left out of the FA Cup holders' Community Shield victory against Liverpool on Saturday at Wembley.</p>

<p>Lyon sporting director Juninho has recently spoken out insisting that he isn't interested in a deal to swap Aouar for Guendouzi.  </p>

<p>The French champions managed by Thomas Tuchel are ready to bid £30million for Guendouzi</p>

<p>He said: 'I get on very well with [Arsenal technical director] Edu, we spoke on the phone. Aouar is really appreciated by Mikel Arteta.</p>

<p>'Guendouzi was discussed during the call, he is a great player, but he is the wrong profile.</p>

<p>'We are not interested in that at all, we cut the conversation.' </p>
