<p>An England Under 17 international, Delap was a surprise name on Pep Guardiola’s bench for Monday’s 3-1 victory at Wolves in Sergio Aguero’s absence. </p>

<p>Explosive young striker Liam Delap is in line for his senior Manchester City debut on Thursday</p>

<p>The 17-year-old was a surprise inclusion on the City bench for the league game with Wolves</p>

<p>Guardiola vowed to name a much-changed side for Thursday's Carabao Cup third round tie against Bournemouth, with Delap in contention to start.</p>

<p>Tommy Doyle, Felix Nmecha, Adrian Bernabe, Taylor Harwood-Bellis and Cole Palmer are all under consideration for selection.</p>

<p>City sources have long since talked up Delap, who scored twice during the Under-21 team’s recent EFL Trophy win over Mansfield Town.</p>

<p>Delap trained with Guardiola’s squad during Project Restart and City believe he has the physical capabilities to deal with men’s football already.</p>

<p>The youngster is the son of former Stoke and Premier League player Rory Delap</p>

<p>‘Obviously the players are the best of the best and being around them shows what the highest level is like and what it takes to be there,’ Delap said. ‘Getting a taste of that gives me great confidence.’ </p>

<p>Guardiola is dealing with a spate of injuries, with Aguero, Aleks Zinchenko, Bernardo Silva and Joao Cancelo among those missing out. Eric Garcia has a chance of featuring, as does Aymeric Laporte, although Ilkay Gundogan is still self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus.</p>

<p>Delap’s emergence played a part in fellow promising front man Charlie McNeill opting to leave City for rivals Manchester United in a deal that could eventually top £1.25million.</p>
