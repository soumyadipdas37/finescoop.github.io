<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Formula One boss Ross Brawn is ready to fight the sport's purists by introducing reverse grid qualifying in what many will see as an attempt to stop Lewis Hamilton's all-conquering Mercedes team.</p>

<p>Brawn mooted the idea on Sunday after an unpredictable Italian Grand Prix at Monza won by AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly.</p>

<p>The notion is to stage a race on Saturdays with those at the bottom of the championship standings starting at the front to act as qualifying to determine the grid for the Sunday's race.</p>

<p>Formula One boss Ross Brawn is ready to introduce reverse grid qualifying into the sport</p>

<p>Brawn said: 'Monza was a candidate for a reverse-grid sprint race when we were considering testing the format this year. Unfortunately, we could not move forward with it, but the concept is still something we and the FIA want to work through in the coming months and discuss with the teams for next year.</p>

<p>'We believe that Sunday's race showed the excitement a mixed-up pack can deliver and with next year's cars remaining the same as this year our fans could be treated to the similar drama we saw this weekend at Monza.</p>

<p>'Of course, with a reverse grid sprint race, teams will set their cars up differently. Right now, Mercedes set their cars up to achieve the fastest lap and then to control the race from the front.</p>

<p>Many will see this as an attempt to stop Lewis Hamilton's all-conquering Mercedes team</p>

<p>'If they know they have to overtake, they will have to change that approach.. We will continue to evaluate new formats with the aim of improving the show but always maintaining the DNA of Formula One.' Mercedes, among other teams, are against the controversial idea, though only a majority - rather than unanimity - is required to see the proposal approved.</p>

<p>It is understood the intention is to introduce the sprint race only on three or four occasions rather than season-long.</p>
