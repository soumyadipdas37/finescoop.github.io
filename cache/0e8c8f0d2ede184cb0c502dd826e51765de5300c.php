<p>A UN summit on biodiversity, being held in New York in September, will be told by biologists there is evidence of a strong link between loss of biodiversity and deadly new diseases, such as Covid-19.</p>

<p>Scientists will warn world leaders that the rapid rate of deforestation and the uncontrolled expansion of farming is providing a 'perfect storm' for diseases to pass from wildlife to humans, The Guardian reported.</p>

<p>Conservationists have warned that deforestation could lead to more pandemics, as it is providing a 'perfect storm' for diseases to pass from wildlife to humans</p>

<p>A UN summit on biodiversity, set to take place in September, will be told by biologists there is evidence of a strong link between environmental destruction and deadly new diseases</p>

<p>Stuart Pimm, professor of conservation at Duke University, said: 'There are now a whole raft of activities – illegal logging, clearing and mining – with associated international trades in bushmeat and exotic pets that have created this crisis.'</p>

<p>He added that 'urgent action is needed' as coronavirus has killed 'almost a million people' and cost 'trillions of dollars'.</p>

<p>Conservationists said that as a result of land use change, such as deforestation, five or six new epidemics could soon affect the world each year.</p>

<p>They claimed that almost a third of all emerging diseases have originated through such land use change.</p>

<p>In the process, the destruction of wild animals, which are hosts to many unknown viruses and bacteria, can lead to humans or livestock being accidentally infected. </p>

<p>These 'spillovers' can lead a new disease in humans if the viruses thrive and spread, or lead to transmission, to other individuals.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that an average rate of deforestation is around 10million hectares each year.</p>

<p>This decreased from an average of 16million hectares per year in the 1990s, as it is thought new forests, both naturally and man-made, are being established.</p>

<p>But before human civilisations, the Earth was originally covered by 60million sq km of forest.</p>

<p>The HIV virus first spread to humans from chimpanzees and gorillas, which were killed for bushmeat in West Africa (above, West African chimp at Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary)</p>

<p>But now, following deforestation accelerated due to human activity, there is said to be less than 40million sq km remaining.</p>

<p>It is used for farm cattle, to extract oil and provide access to mines and mineral deposits. </p>

<p>In a paper published in Science last month, scientists and economists have proposed setting up a scheme to monitor wildlife and reduce deforestation.</p>

<p>The researchers added the programme, which could cost more than $20billion a year, would also be able to help the fight against climate change. </p>

<p>The scientists said: 'Postponing a global strategy to reduce pandemic risk would lead to continued soaring costs. Society must strive to avoid the impacts of future pandemics.'</p>

<p>The HIV virus originally spread from chimpanzees and gorillas, which were slaughtered for bushmeat in West Africa, to men and woman.</p>

<p>Other viruses which spread from wild animals to humans include the 2009 swine flu epidemic and Ebola fever, which is passed on by bats.</p>

<p>But zoologist David Redding, of University College London, stressed that not every emerging disease is caused by a single 'spillover event'. </p>

<p>Conservationists claimed that as a result of land use change, such as deforestation and illegal logging, five or six new epidemics could soon affect the world each year</p>

<p>He said: 'Bats, rodents and other pests carrying strange new viruses come from surviving clumps of forests and infect farm animals – who then pass on these infections to humans.'</p>

<p>Lassa fever, which was first discovered in Nigeria in 1969, is spread by the rodent Mastomys natalensis.</p>

<p>The rodent was widespread in Africa's forests but colonises in homes and farms, spreading the disease it carried to humans.</p>

<p>Andy Dobson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University, said that during land use change, workers who chop down rainforest trees do not take food with them.</p>

<p>Instead, he said, the workers eat 'what they can kill' which can expose them to a number of infections.</p>

<p>He added that humans are outnumbered by infections, as there are probably 'ten times more' species of viruses than mammals.</p>

<p>This comes after physicists claimed that human civilisation stands a 90 per cent chance of an 'irreversible collapse' due to deforestation. </p>

<p>Last month it was claimed that within the next two to four decades, Earth may no longer be able to sustain a large human population, according to a peer-reviewed paper published in Nature Scientific Reports.</p>

<p>The destruction of wildlife, which are hosts to many unknown viruses and bacteria, can lead to humans or livestock being accidentally infected - causing new and emerging epidemics</p>

<p>This comes after physicists claimed that human civilisation stands a 90 per cent chance of an 'irreversible collapse' due to deforestation</p>

<p>The study, written by Dr Gerardo Aquino and Professor Mauro Bologna, states that if the rate of deforestation continues 'all the forests would disappear approximately in 100–200 years'.</p>

<p>This trajectory would result in the loss of planetary life-support systems necessary for human survival including carbon storage, oxygen production, soil conservation and water cycle regulation. </p>

<p>It is thought this would ultimately result in the collapse of human civilization as 'it is highly unlikely to imagine the survival of many species, including ours, on Earth without [forests]'. </p>

<p>The paper, which was published in May this year, states: 'The progressive degradation of the environment due to deforestation would heavily affect human society and consequently the human collapse would start much earlier.' </p>

<p>'Calculations show that, maintaining the actual rate of population growth and resource consumption, in particular forest consumption, we have a few decades left before an irreversible collapse of our civilization,' the paper concludes. </p>
