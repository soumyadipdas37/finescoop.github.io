<p>The 34-year-old broadcaster garnered much adulation on Monday, when she shared a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini for a tan tutorial on Instagram.</p>

<p>However, the star returned to the image-sharing platform on Thursday night to reveal that she had also been subject to some 'awful' comments for appearance.</p>

<p>Fighting back: Vogue Williams hit back at trolls while sharing a workout clip on Thursday, after she was body-shamed for her post-baby weight loss, six weeks after birth of her daughter Gigi</p>

<p>Insisting that she 'shouldn't be made to feel bad' for her own body, the mother-of-two shared a video of herself working out in a red top with black leggings.</p>

<p>Captioning the silent clip of the fitness session, the Irish beauty wrote: 'There is no secret! I got a lot of comments and mails about the video I posted the other day. Mainly positive but my god there were some awful ones!</p>

<p>'I hate the term "snapping back" it’s not something I aspire to do after having a child nor do I think it’s important. My body is different to other people’s, I didn’t do anything specific.</p>

<p>Incredible: The star looked incredible when she unveiled a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini on Monday</p>

<p>'I’ve only recently started training again, 4 times a week for 45 minutes a session. I try to eat healthily but I have not cut calories and eat a lot more than usual as I’m breastfeeding and it’s important to keep calories up so you have a good milk supply.</p>

<p>'I trained the whole way throughout my pregnancy and I think that is a factor in the way I look now. I’m also VERY tall so there’s a lot more room for a baby.' </p>

<p>Revealing that she's been a fitness devotee for almost half her life, she continued: 'I’ve trained since I was 16, for me it’s a great thing not only for my body but for my mind too.</p>

<p>'At the moment I feel permanently exhausted but training gives me energy and keeps my hormones under more control (they are still all over the place a little as with any new mother).'</p>

<p>Statement: Insisting that she 'shouldn't be made to feel bad' for her own body, the star shared a video of herself working out in a red top with black leggings as she shared her statement</p>

<p>Addressing the tanning video directly, she said: 'I didn’t post that video to show off my body. I have always done tan tutorials, I don’t feel the need to hide my body because as I’ve read "it’s unrealistic 6 weeks PP".'</p>

<p>'What should a body look like after a baby?' Vogue challenged. 'There isn’t a set way it should look. I don’t want anyone to feel bad about their bodies and I certainly don’t want to be made feel bad about my own. ❤️.'</p>

<p>She then revealed that the new video was taken during a fitness session with celebrity personal trainer Dalton Wong, 'focusing on the tush'. </p>

<p>Despite having given birth less than two months ago, her abs, legs and arms all showed strong gym-crafted definition as she stood before the camera.</p>

<p>Not showing off: Addressing the tanning video directly, she said, 'I didn’t post that video to show off my body. I have always done tan tutorials, I don’t feel the need to hide my body...'</p>

<p>The seven-minute long clip started with her husband Spencer training the camera on his face as she stood behind him.</p>

<p>He soon stepped aside, with the help of a gentle playful nudge from his wife, as she unveiled herself in all of her bikini-clad glory.</p>

<p>As the video progressed, the Irish beauty was seen using products from her sunless tanning line, Bare by Vogue, which she applied to all areas of her skin.</p>

<p>Her doting husband Spencer also got in on the action, putting on a glove so that he could help with applying the product to his glamorous wife's back.</p>

<p>Further getting in on the action, Spencer removed his top so that Vogue could also return the favour and apply some of the fake tan to him. </p>

<p>Incredible: The 34-year-old broadcaster looked enviably tanned and toned as she took to Instagram to share a video of herself giving the fake tan tutorial</p>

<p>Captioning the video, the star wrote: 'This one is for all the new tanners and people who want to apply their tan better! <?php echo e('@'); ?>barebyvogue will give you a glow like you’re just back from holidays but application is key to looking bronzed.</p>

<p>'After some fake tan disasters in my life (a lot of them) I have finally mastered applying my tan... if you want any tips ask below and I’ll answer.'</p>

<p>Her video comes four days after she proudly showcasing her postpartum figure as she enjoyed a work out session in her west London garden earlier this month.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two, who gave birth to her daughter Gigi in July, looked sensational in a black sports bra which she teamed with a pair of leggings.</p>

<p>Vogue showcased her fitness prowess as she practised a series of movements including lunges and squats using a purple resistance band.</p>

<p>Hubby dearest: The seven-minute long clip started with her husband Spencer Matthews training the camera on his face as she stood behind him</p>

<p>Rubbing it in: Spencer put on a glove to help rub the product into the mother-of-two's back</p>

<p>A couple that works out together: The couple looking incredibly toned in front of the camera</p>

<p>The Heart FM presenter wore her blonde locks swept back into a low bun, while going make-up free and covering her face with a pair of round shades. </p>

<p>She finished her sporty look with colourful running shoes, as she admitted she was struggling with some moves because she hadn't done them for so long. </p>

<p>Vogue gave birth to Gigi Margaux on July 23 with husband Spencer, 33, and the couple welcomed their first child, son Theodore in September 2018. </p>

<p>Spencer confirmed last week that he and Vogue will be having more kids in the future, only if she allows him to hire a live-in nanny.</p>

<p>During the first episode of their eponymous podcast, the former Made In Chelsea star also stressed the 'necessity' of childcare for working parents. </p>

<p>Responding to fans' queries about growing their family, presenter Vogue confirmed: 'Yes we will be. Not yet though', before the reality star added: 'Depending on the nanny's availability and whether or not she can move in permanently. I won't do it otherwise.' </p>

<p>Vogue shared the details of their agreement as she said: 'Spenny did actually say that, that we could have four kids if I swore that we could have a live-in nanny by the time we had four kids. </p>

<p>'It's different for Irish people I think because we don't do the whole night nanny thing, and all that stuff, you don't hear about that at home, but here, you have maternity nurses, night nannies and stuff like that and we just don't have that.' </p>

<p>Spencer left his long-term partner in giggles as he joked he'd wear 'condoms every time' if she tries to have a third baby without a live-in nanny, with the blonde sarcastically replying: 'Good luck, I'd be really into that, we can start doing that right now because I'd rather not go on the pill.'</p>

<p>Looking good! Last Thursday, Vogue proudly showcased her postpartum figure as she enjoyed a work out session in her west London garden</p>

<p>Fresh-faced: The Heart FM presenter wore her blonde locks swept back into a low bun, while going make-up free and covering her face with a pair of round shades</p>

<p>When asked whether they currently receive help with their children, the former Lothario said: 'Yes, obviously.   </p>

<p>'And it's not even a pompous like, obviously, it's how can two adults who work, full time, look after kids as well. It's a necessity, of day to day life. If one of us didn't work, then we wouldn't have a nanny, given that we work.  </p>

<p>'Without being rude but I don't compare myself to other people. I have my mission in life and the things I want to achieve, and a nanny is very much a part of that.'</p>

<p>'But if you saw me complaining online, about being a mum and having a job… what would you think about me?', the mother-of-two asked, with the TV star replying: 'I'd say why don't you get the nanny to do more?' </p>
