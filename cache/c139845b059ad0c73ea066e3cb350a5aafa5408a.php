<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The former editor of the Today programme has slammed 'entitled' young BBC staff who 'expect to have their view of the world on air'.</p>

<p>Sarah Sands suggested workers at the broadcaster, which she quit earlier this year, cannot understand right-wing views.</p>

<p>The journalist said impartiality is still key for the BBC, but 'respect for the rules is weakening' and it needs to try not to conform to a 'cultural like-mindedness'.</p>

<p>It comes after the new director-general told staff if they want to be opinionated columnists or a campaigners online they 'should not be working' there.</p>

<p>Tim Davie, who took over this week, said the broadcaster needed to 'urgently champion and recommit to impartiality'.</p>

<p>Ms Sands wrote in the FT: 'The BBC is not just a broadcaster but also an attentive employer in the age of the employee activist.</p>

<p>'The result is a sense of entitlement among younger employees: they expect to have their view of the world on air.</p>

<p>'In its drive to reflect a new world, the BBC sometimes overlooks an older one. It can treat social conservatism with polite incomprehension.'</p>

<p>Mr Davie insisted his drive was 'about being free from political bias, guided by the pursuit of truth, not a particular agenda'.</p>

<p>But it came just days after he floated a radical overhaul of the broadcaster's comedy output in the coming months, over fears it is seen as 'too one-sided'.</p>

<p>His remarks - widely seen as a swipe at woke presenters mouthing off on Twitter - came after he ordered a u-turn on a ban on Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory at Last Night of the Proms.</p>

<p>The comments were in his first official speech in Cardiff on Thursday lunchtime and follow controversies over impartiality, including Newsnight host Emily Maitlis sparking a furore with a monologue on the Dominic Cummings lockdown row.</p>

<p>The BBC later said the episode 'did not meet our standards of due impartiality'.</p>

<p>BBC Breakfast host Naga Munchetty was also rebuked last year after commenting on remarks made by US President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Match of the Day host Gary Lineker is also known for tweeting political views and opinions on his social media.</p>

<p>New BBC Director General Tim Davie is pictured delivering his first speech with a few warning shots</p>

<p>Mr Davie said: 'We urgently need to champion and recommit to impartiality. It is deliverable and it is essential.</p>

<p>'If you work here, nothing should be more exciting than exploring different views, seeking evidence with curiosity and creatively presenting testimony.</p>

<p>'Making use of our own experiences but not driven by our personal agendas. I wonder if some people worry that impartiality could be a little dull.</p>

<p>'To be clear, this is not about abandoning democratic values such as championing fair debate or an abhorrence of racism.</p>

<p>'But it is about being free from political bias, guided by the pursuit of truth, not a particular agenda.</p>

<p>'If you want to be an opinionated columnist or a partisan campaigner on social media then that is a valid choice, but you should not be working at the BBC.' </p>
