<p>In light of the revelations, Sylvia and her Today Extra co-host David Campbell reviewed the footage from the interview on Tuesday's show.  </p>

<p>'Oh it's awful, it's ugly, ugly behaviour,' Sylvia said, after watching the clip of Ellen coaxing Mariah into proving she wasn't pregnant with then-husband, Nick Cannon. by making her drink champagne.  </p>

<p>'And if she was not in on the joke, which she says she is not, then Ellen really has some explaining to do on that one,' she insisted. </p>

<p>Sylvia, who is mother herself, continued: 'You cannot put a woman in that position.'  </p>
