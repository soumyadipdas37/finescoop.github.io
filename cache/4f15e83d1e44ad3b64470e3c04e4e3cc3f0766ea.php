<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rolls-Royce has insisted it is months away from its first attempt at breaking the 300mph record for the world’s fastest electric aeroplane.</p>

<p>Yesterday the FTSE 100 aerospace engineer said it had completed ground testing for all the technology in the plane’s core, including a 500 horsepower electric powertrain.</p>

<p>The full-scale replica has been run up to a full speed of 2,400 revolutions per minute in testing with the help of a battery, which is made up of 6,000 cells and has enough energy to supply 250 homes. </p>

<p>Flight sparks: Rolls-Royce said it had completed ground testing for all the technology in its Spirit of Innovation electric plane's core, including a 500 horsepower electric powertrain</p>

<p>The plane, called the Spirit of Innovation, will be ready for test flights later this year and its first record attempt in early 2021.</p>

<p>Rolls has gone ahead with the project, part of the ACCEL programme, despite its shares falling 20 per cent in a week dragging its valuation down to £2.9billion, putting it at grave risk of losing its blue chip status.</p>

<p>It has already announced 9,000 redundancies and is preparing to raise up to £2.5billion in debt and equity.</p>

<p>But bosses believe electric engines will be crucial to the company’s long-term future.</p>
