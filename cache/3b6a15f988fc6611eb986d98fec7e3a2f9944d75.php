<p>Strong: Christine McGuinness has revealed her beloved mother has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer during a heartbreaking Instagram post on Wednesday evening</p>

<p>Sweet: The glamour model, 32, admitted she has been 'hit hard' by the news, as he detailed her mum's magical bond with her three children</p>

<p>'We spend almost every weekend together with my children, their bond is magical. But, my mum is also the strongest woman I know and is determined to fight it. She’s a proper "scouse Ma".'⠀</p>

<p>'I have always supported breast cancer charities as four of my aunties have also had breast cancer and my mum has asked me to continue helping raise money and awareness (the reason I’m sharing this) she has the biggest heart and always just wants to help others. You will smash it mum.'</p>
