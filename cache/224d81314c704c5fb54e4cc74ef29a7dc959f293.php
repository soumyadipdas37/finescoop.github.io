<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A self-taught businesswoman whose beauty brand earns five figures a month has created a bath bomb that dissolves all traces of fake tan in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Irishwoman Fiona Dunne used her passion for sunless tanning to launch GlowDry Australia, a revolutionary drying powder that sets tan in seconds which hit the market on October 1, 2018.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old has since developed the $19 GlowBomb, a tan removing bath bomb which she hand makes from natural ingredients like lemon, bicarbonate of soda and avocado oil in the kitchen of her home in Perth, Western Australia.</p>

<p>Ms Dunne told Daily Mail Australia she is struggling to meet demand and has already sold out twice thanks to customers buying 'four and five at a time'. </p>

<p>Submerging yourself in a bath mixed with GlowDry's 'GlowBomb' for 10 minutes will dissolve all traces of fake tan, without the vigorous scrubbing associated with traditional removal</p>

<p>'The batch sizes are small because they're handmade, so we're struggling to keep up,' she said of the bombs, which have seen GlowDry's profits soar since their August launch.</p>

<p>The mother-of-one, who was born in Dublin but has lived Down Under for almost 10 years, now makes up to $15,000 a month from her inventions - not bad for a former health officer with no previous experience in the cosmetics business.</p>

<p>A product description tells customers to gently lower the 'GlowBomb' into a bathtub of warm water, where it will quickly dissolve into a shimmering sea of pink foam.</p>

<p>Once this has happened, you can submerge yourself in the water for 10 to 15 minutes and watch fake ten 'melt away', using an exfoliating mitt to buff away any stubborn patches that might remain on the elbows, feet and underarms.</p>

<p>Self-taught businesswoman Fiona Dunne (pictured with son Logan) puts 'every hour under the sun' into her business and plans to invest her profit into more new products</p>

<p>Reviews on the brand's website reveal delighted responses from customers who have grown tired of traditional tan removal techniques, which typically involve vigorous scrubbing with exfoliators that leave skin raw and tender.</p>

<p>'After trying so many different tan removers and really struggling to scrub it off, I didn't think I would find anything that really got all my tan off but after putting this in my bath I knew I'd finally found the one,' a customer called Beth wrote.</p>

<p>'It's crazy to be able to relax in the beautiful pink, sparkling bath water and have it remove your tan while doing so. 10/10 couldn't ask for anything more.'</p>

<p>Others describe the bombs as 'life-changing' and 'seriously amazing'.</p>

<p>One woman who regularly spray tans said she was scrubbing her skin for up to an hour everyday to remove patchy scales before discovering GlowDry's latest product. </p>
