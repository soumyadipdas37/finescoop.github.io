<p>'Things are still hugely challenging and a long way from being normal, but I'd like to think that this will give Derek yet another opportunity to hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.</p>

<p>'My heartfelt thanks go to Myleene Klass who has been brilliantly care taking the show for me and to all my regular listeners for their messages of support.'</p>

<p>She admitted there couldn't be a more relaxing job to ease her back into a stable work routine.</p>

<p>In the midst of Derek's health battle, Kate has focused on looking after their children, Billy, 11, and Darcy, 14.</p>

<p>She announced her temporary departure from Good Morning Britain in August so she could help her children prepare for their return to school, after returning for a few weeks earlier in the summer. </p>
