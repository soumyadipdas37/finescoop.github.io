<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United have confirmed assistant Under-23s coach Quinton Fortune has left the club to become first team coach at Reading.</p>

<p>The 43-year-old will join new Royals manager Veljko Paunović at the Madejski Satdium ahead of the 2020-21 Championship season.</p>

<p>The news comes after previous Reading Under-23s coach Scott Marshall left the club, followed by first team boss Mark Bowen. </p>

<p>Fortune joined United as a player in 1999, and went on to make 126 appearances for the Reds over the following seven years, before leaving to join Bolton Wanderers.</p>

<p>The South African returned to the club in 2012 to start working towards his coaching badges and began his role as assistant coach for United's Under-23s in July 2019.</p>

<p>Last season was a successful one for the Under-23s, with the side achieving promotion to Premier League 2 Division One. Neil Wood's team were in second spot behind West Ham United when the season was curtailed and subsequently concluded on a points-per-game basis.</p>

<p>Nick Cox, Head of Academy, told the club's official website: 'Everyone at the Academy wishes Quinton the best of luck in his new role. All of our coaches, as well as the players, receive a huge amount of development and this is another example of the type of progress that an individual can make within the Academy system. </p>

<p>'The Under-23s' promotion was a great achievement for Neil Wood and his staff so we'd like to thank Quinton for his role in that.</p>

<p>'We are fortunate to have a pool of excellent coaches in the professional development phase who are ready to take on increased responsibilities. </p>

<p>'They will work together to support the squad as we look to continue to build on the eight first-team debuts that were made last season.'</p>
