<p>Wolves are finalising a deal to sign Porto wonderkid Fabio Silva for a club record fee of £35m</p>

<p>Silva is highly rated in Portugal and has been compared to a young Cristiano Ronaldo</p>

<p>A month later against Young Boys in the UEFA Europa League group stage, he became the club's youngest player in European competitions, beating the record set by Rúben Neves, now at Wolves.</p>

<p>Silva and his father Jorge, a former midfielder with Boavista, met with Wolves officials including executive chairman Jeff Shi last week and has now agreed a contract until 2025 with the option of a further year.</p>

<p>His signing would come despite his relative inexperience playing senior football for Porto.</p>

<p>So far Silva has only played 182 top-flight minutes for Porto in their league, though he has scored three goals in 19 appearances across all competitions.</p>
