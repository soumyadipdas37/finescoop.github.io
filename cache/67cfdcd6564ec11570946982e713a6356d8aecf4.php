<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Listen up Amazon Alexa smart speaker fans! Amazon has introduced a new member to its Echo family, built with recycled materials and featuring low power mode, enhanced audio and fun spherical design.</p>

<p>Among the new slew of gadget releases from the mega-retailer are redesigned smart speakers, including the All-new Echo (£89.99), All-new Echo Dot (£49.99) and All-new Echo Dot with Clock (£59.99).</p>

<p>The next-generation Echo combines the best of Echo and Echo Plus into a single device at the same affordable Echo price. Its all-new design and fabric finish boasts a bright LED light ring at the base of the sphere for a smart, modern finish. </p>

<p>Amazon is launching a new slew of Alexa smart speakers, including the All-New Echo Dot with Clock (£59.99) available for pre-order now</p>

<p>The new Echo also sounds significantly better; thanks to a 3.0-inch woofer, dual-firing tweeters, and Dolby processing that delivers stereo sound with clear highs, dynamic-mids, and deep bass.</p>

<p>Plus, for the first time, Echo also comes with a built-in smart home hub, with support for Zigbee, and it supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>

<p>Amazon's All-new Echo Dot features the same globe-like design and fabric finish as Echo, making it a stylish way to add Alexa to any space.</p>

<p>It's compact, but packs in a powerful 1.6-inch front-firing speaker, producing crisp vocals and balanced bass for full sound you can enjoy in any room of your home.</p>

<p>The new Echo Dot with Clock comes with the same enhancements like the new Echo Dot, plus a simple LED display so you can glance at the time, temperature, timers, and alarms.</p>

<p>The All-new Echo from Amazon boasts a bright LED light ring at the base of the sphere</p>

<p>And now, the tap-to-snooze feature that customers love on Echo Dot with clock will also be available on Echo Dot and Echo.</p>

<p>The new devices have been built with the planet in mind as they've been created with 100 per cent post-consumer recycled fabric, 100 per cent recycled die-cast aluminium and post-consumer recycled plastic.</p>

<p>Plus, all wood fibre-based materials used in Echo device packaging are made entirely from responsibly managed forests or recycled sources.</p>

<p>The All-new Echo (£89.99), All-new Echo Dot (£49.99) and All-new Echo Dot with Clock (£59.99) can be pre-ordered from Amazon, with the release date set for October 22, 2020.</p>
