<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wilfred Ndidi will on Saturday have surgery on a thigh injury that Leicester expect to keep him sidelined for 12 weeks.</p>

<p>The Nigerian sustained the injury during the second half of the Foxes’ 4-2 win over Burnley last Sunday, but still completed the match.</p>

<p>It is a huge blow for Leicester, as Ndidi is one of the best defensive midfielders in the country and has been impressing in central defence in the absence of the suspended Jonny Evans.</p>

<p>Leicester have confirmed that defensive midfielder Wilfred Ndidi will be out for 12 weeks</p>

<p>‘It’s an abductor problem and it’s unfortunate, the muscle has come right off the bone,’ said Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers. </p>

<p>‘He will be out for up to 12 weeks, we think.</p>

<p>‘He felt some pain and there is no doubt he will be a miss for us. </p>

<p>'I'm sure he'll make a really good recovery and we'll welcome him back when he comes back.'</p>

<p>Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers has revealed Ndidi will have surgery on Saturday</p>

<p>Nampalys Mendy is to continue in the holding role for Sunday's clash with Manchester City</p>

<p>Nampalys Mendy will continue in the holding midfield role when Leicester take on Manchester City on Sunday, although Ndidi’s absence is unlikely to change Rodgers’ transfer plans as he continues to press for a new centre-back.</p>

<p>Timothy Castagne joined Leicester for £22million and winger Cengiz Under will begin training next week following his season-long loan move from Roma, but Rodgers remains desperate to improve his options in central defence.</p>

<p>Bids approaching £30million for St Etienne defender Wesley Fofana have so far been rejected, meaning Leicester could turn their attention to Burnley defender James Tarkowski – one of their main targets last summer – or Germany international Jonathan Tah, who plays for Bayer Leverkusen. </p>
