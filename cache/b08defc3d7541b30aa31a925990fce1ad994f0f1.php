<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Building approval numbers have plummeted even though the federal government is giving out $25,000 subsidies to home owners who want a new house.</p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's HomeBuilder program is, until December 31, providing owner-occupiers, and not just first-home buyers, $25,000 grants to build a new home or renovate an existing one.</p>

<p>The $688million program was announced in June but despite that, building approvals in New South Wales, Australia's most populated state, plunged by 14.2 per cent in August.</p>

<p>This however followed a 32 per cent increase in July as coronavirus lockdown delays caused a short-lived spike in approvals.</p>

<p>National building approvals last month fell by 1.6 per cent, unpleasantly surprising financial markets which had expected a flat result.</p>

<p>Labor's housing spokesman Jason Clare said the sharp fall in building approvals highlighted the failure of the HomeBuilder scheme.</p>

<p>New South Wales: down 14.2 per cent</p>

<p>Victoria: up 1.8 per cent</p>

<p>Queensland: up 8.1 per cent</p>

<p>South Australia: down 4.8 per cent</p>

<p>Western Australia: up 33.8 per cent</p>

<p>Tasmania: down 26.2 per cent </p>

<p>Northern Territory: up 22.6 per cent</p>

<p>Australian Capital Territory: down 32 per cent</p>

<p>'Despite the government telling us how successful HomeBuilder is, almost four months after its launch, this data shows it's just not true,' he said.</p>

<p>'There will be less work for tradies and jobs will be lost unless the government tries to fix its bungled HomeBuilder Scheme in next week's budget.'</p>

<p>Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan said 'volatility in NSW' caused the national drop in council building approvals in August.</p>

<p>'The July result represented a catch-up, as approvals delayed by the initial nation wide lock-down were eventually processed by city councils,' he said.</p>

<p>'This raised the risk of an unwinding leading into August results.'</p>

<p>Not all states struggled with building projects approved by local councils surging by 33.8 per cent in Western Australia and by 8.1 per cent in Queensland.</p>

<p>Even Victoria enjoyed an 1.8 per cent increase despite Melbourne's five million residents being placed into a strict, Stage Four lockdown with an 8pm to 5am curfew.</p>

<p>Nationally, apartment approvals dived by 11 per cent last month, partially offsetting a 23 per cent rise in July.</p>

<p>House approvals fell 4.8 per cent in August, even though Australians earning up to $125,000 a year and couples on combined incomes of $200,000 are eligible for $25,000 grants.</p>

<p>The HomeBuilder subsidy is available for new houses with a market value of up to $750,000 while the renovation grant is there for homes with a market value of up to $1.5million.  </p>
