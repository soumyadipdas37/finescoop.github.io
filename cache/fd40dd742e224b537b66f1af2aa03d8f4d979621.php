<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A teenage boy who allegedly caused a horrific car smash that injured eleven people previously crashed a stolen car while drunk in August.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old, who cannot be named, allegedly ran a red light in a Holden Statesman packed with teens and struck a maxi taxi in Edgeworth, near Newcastle on Friday night.</p>

<p>The crash left young mother Tamika Wever fighting for life with devastating head injuries after being flung from the maxi taxi. </p>

<p>It has been revealed the accused driver was on a good behaviour bond at the time after a previous driving conviction in Merewether in Newcastle on August 2. </p>

<p>The teen stole a car at 2.50am before he crashed and abandoned it, with police finding him nearby after reports of a speeding vehicle in the suburb throughout the morning.</p>

<p> The teenager who has been accused of causing a horror crash (pictured) near Newcastle on Friday was convicted for another driving offence only last month</p>

<p>Tamika Wever, 24, received serious head injuries when the taxi she was in was struck by another car at Edgeworth near Newcastle</p>

<p>He turned in a blood alcohol reading of 0.099 to police at 8.55am and was charged with car theft, negligent driving, driving with a mid-range PCA and driving a car without ever holding a licence, The Daily Telegraph reports.</p>

<p>The teenager was fined $350, disqualified from driving and given a 12-month good behaviour bond.</p>

<p>Less than two months later, police allege the Holden Statesman he was driving ran a red light before it slammed into the taxi just after 1am on Main Road. </p>

<p>Officers were the first on scene after doing a U-turn to try to stop the Holden before the crash.</p>

<p>The teenager was refused bail and faced the Children's Court on Sunday. </p>

<p>He allegedly returned a 0.73 roadside breath test result.  </p>

<p>The teen has since been charged with 15 offences, including dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, negligent driving, driving while disqualified and failing to stop for a red light.</p>

<p>Tamika Wever's (right) older sister Tash Reid (left) said she 'isn't in a good way' and needs to be be home with her three sons </p>

<p>Friends of Ms Wever have revealed she has an 'extremely low chance of survival' after the crash. </p>

<p>The 24-year-old was on the way home from the pub with friends when the crash occurred. </p>

<p>A friend of Ms Wever's posted on social media that 'the chances of Tamika's survival is extremely low... this is devastating.'</p>

<p>The young mother's sister, Tash Reid, said she 'isn't in a good way'.  </p>

<p>'It's terrible. I don't know how to put it into words. The focus is Tamika. We just need her to get better and get out of here,' Ms Reid told 9News. </p>

<p>'We all need her home, her little boys need her home.</p>

<p>'She is amazing, the most beautiful, loving, caring, intelligent and most amazing mother, sister, daughter and friend.' </p>

<p>The young mum was on the way home from the pub with friends when a Holden Commodore allegedly ran a red light and struck the taxi</p>

<p>Ms Reid also urged drivers to think before getting behind the wheel.</p>

<p>'My sister's up there fighting for her life because of idiots,' she said.</p>

<p>Paramedics treated 11 people for various injuries who were all taken to John Hunter Hospital, with most of the passengers in the Statesman suffering minor injuries.</p>

<p>The taxi driver, a 46-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman suffered serious injuries while three further taxi passengers - men aged 28, 35 and 47 - suffered minor injuries.</p>

<p>The crash was so loud it woke up nearby residents, who rushed to help the victims.   </p>

<p>'I just kicked in the back window of the maxi taxi, got the other two guys out,' witness Nick Dupont said.</p>

<p>He said the passengers from the Statesman appeared to be traumatised by the accident. One of them was only 14-years old.  </p>

<p>Her cousin Charlii Croese wrote a heartfelt tribute on social media to her 'best friend and rock'</p>

<p>Friends of Ms Wever said the mother had an 'extremely low chance of survival' after the horror smash </p>

<p>Ms Wever's cousin Charlii Croese wrote a heartfelt tribute on social media to her 'best friend and rock.' </p>

<p>'We all just want you to wake up please, your babies need you. we all need you,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'I held your hand today and kissed you, I told you how much we all need you and how much I love you. You are the strongest person I know and if anyone can do this you can.'  </p>

<p>A GoFundMe has been set up by Ms Wever's family-friend Angie Smalley, who described the mother as a 'loving, kind, fun soul'.  </p>

<p>'Suffering severe brain injuries Tamika is fighting for her life …. she is in critical condition with injuries that horrendous I have been told not to expect to recognise my gorgeous friend's face when I go to see her,' Ms Smalley wrote. </p>

<p>'Tamika is a young amazing mum, always putting her babies first, always smiling, she is funny with an absolute gentle soul that did not deserve this today.'</p>

<p>'Dylan, a hard working, loving fiance to Tamika was also injured in the accident and in hospital.</p>

<p>'Which means their three sons are being loved and looked after by their family members, not knowing why their mummy and daddy are not coming home to them and haven't been home for days.'</p>
