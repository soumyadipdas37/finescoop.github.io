<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bachelor Locky Gilbert has so far rejected 21 women on the show, including blonde beauty Steph Harper. </p>

<p>And on Friday, the 26-year-old special needs teacher showed Locky what he was missing with a bikini picture posted to Instagram.</p>

<p>But it was Stephanie's lengthy caption that stole the show, which contained several swipes at her former lover.</p>

<p>'It wasn't everything I wanted': The Bachelor's Steph Harper (pictured) took a swipe at Locky Gilbert after failing to get a rose this week on the show </p>

<p>'Look if something doesn't bring you energy, inspiration or a goooood time. It doesn't belong in your life,' she captioned the post, followed by a winking face emoji.</p>

<p>The caption and emoji seem to suggest the 'it' Steph was referring to was actually a 'him' - Locky. </p>

<p>Steph's caption, titled 'new beginnings', went into detail about her journey from being rejected on a national dating show to moving to Queensland from Victoria. </p>

<p>Moving on! The 26-year-old special needs teacher (pictured) showed Locky what he was missing with a bikini picture posted to Instagram on Friday</p>

<p>'Bach was a huge journey for me, one that I became very invested in. It wasn't everything I wanted but it was everything I needed,' Steph wrote. </p>

<p>'I gave it my all and I've come away with absolutely no regrets! I didn't find love with a partner but after picking myself up and putting myself back together I've gained a lot of self-love. </p>

<p>'I got to meet so many beautiful women who have forever spots in my heart now and I learned so much about myself in the process. I've since wandered up to Queensland and have started a new chapter.' </p>

<p>The 26-year-old explained she spent two weeks in hotel quarantine in Queensland and is now free to go to the beach, which is where she took her photo.  </p>

<p>Last rose: Locky (pictured) gave his final rose to Bella Varelis on Thursday night, eliminating Steph and Maddy Carver in the process </p>

<p>Steph was sent home from The Bachelor on Wednesday night along with fellow teacher Maddy Carver after they both failed to get a rose. </p>

<p>Maddy and Steph's eliminations occurred after an intense showdown between Juliette and Locky during the show's cocktail party.</p>

<p>However, it didn't go according to plan and the 34-year-old stylist was immediately evicted from The Bachelor mansion. </p>

<p>The remaining women competing for Locky's love include Bella Varelis, Irena Srbinovska, Izzy Sharman-Firth, Kaitlyn Hoppe and intruder Bec Cvilikas. </p>

<p>Bye bye! A devastated Maddy and Steph both said their goodbyes and were sent home after failing to get a rose from Locky</p>
