<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry failed to tell the Queen about their Netflix deal, which could be worth as much as $150million, before announcing it to the world, a royal source has claimed.</p>

<p>The Duke, 35, and the Duchess of Sussex, 39, who recently bought a $14million mansion in Santa Barbara, have signed a new deal with the streaming service, and say they want to provide 'hope and inspiration' with their upcoming projects.</p>

<p>Yet Her Majesty, 94, had to be told by her aides about the couple's new venture - which involves a yet-to-be-named production company set on making documentaries, feature films and children's programming.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Harry did not inform the Queen about the Netflix deal.'</p>

<p>It comes following reports that royal officials 'will examine the pair's deal' after they agreed to approval of any new commercial ventures when they quit public life. </p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced on Wednesday that they have signed a deal with Netflix. Pictured, in a video supplied on Monday July 6, 2020 by The Queen's Commonwealth Trust </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have never produced a TV show, will make documentaries, films, scripted and kids’ programmes in the new partnership.</p>

<p>'Her Majesty is all too aware of the pitfalls of when senior royals embark on lucrative projects - Prince Edwards’ production flop and some of the deals Sarah Ferguson has signed over the years to name a few,' the source told Fabulous.</p>

<p>'Her view is simple, the Royals are not for sale and danger surrounds high profile roles outside of the institution itself.'</p>

<p>They added, however, that the Queen, 'knowing her grandson Harry as she does', will appreciate that the duke and duchess can not be talked out of their plans. </p>

<p>Harry and Meghan said on Wednesday they had founded a production company to make documentaries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programmes.</p>

<p>But the couple failed to tell the Queen (pictured in July) about their deal, which could be worth as much as $150million, before announcing it to the world, a royal source has claimed </p>

<p>They vowed to make 'impactful content that unlocks action' and name-checked Netflix chief executive Ted Sarandos and spoke of the firm's 'unprecedented reach'.</p>

<p>They are expected to make content which includes work on 'mental health', an animated series about women, a nature documentary and shows on community service.</p>

<p>However, royal officials 'will examine Harry and Meghan's Netflix deal' after they agreed to approval of any new commercial ventures when they quit public life, according to a source.</p>

<p>A palace insider claimed that despite ditching official duties any profit-oriented plans would be 'subject to discussion'.</p>

<p>There are questions over how it will look to the taxpayer when the Sussexes have still not paid off the £2.4million spent on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.</p>

<p>The source told the Mirror: 'Harry and Meghan did leave as working members of the family with everyone's best wishes and it is sincerely hoped they find the happiness that appeared to be lacking in their lives.</p>

<p>'However, it goes without saying any deals they are making will be scrutinised by the royal household.</p>

<p>'Under the terms of their deal to forgo their royal duties, they agreed any commercial deals would be subject to discussion.'</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan got the green light to broker commercial deals in January - but the moneymaking projects will be scrutinised by the Queen after a year.</p>

<p>The historic agreement ruled the couple will drop their HRH titles, pay back £2.4million of taxpayer cash and no longer receive public funds.</p>

<p>In exchange, they were allowed to quit frontline duties and given licence to expand their brand.</p>
