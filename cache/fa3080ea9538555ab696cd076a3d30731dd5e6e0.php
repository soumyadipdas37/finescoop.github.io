<p>Typically, homeowners in Australia can expect to spend between $18,000 and $25,000 on a new bathroom.</p>

<p>'It's done. Our budget bathroom reno is complete,' Connie posted on Facebook.</p>

<p>'It took a few weekends as there was a delay in receiving our shower wet walls.</p>

<p>'But I think we kept it under $5k. We may have a few cents left and all work was done by us.' </p>

<p>Connie revealed where she bought all of the items from in the bathroom, including the bath and shower screen from Builders' Discount Warehouse and the shower walls from Mr Wet Wall.</p>

<p>'I bought the vanity from IKEA, the tapware and a wine rack for the towels from Catch of the Day and the barn door, paint, panels and trims all came from Bunnings Warehouse,' she said.</p>

<p>DURING: Bar moving the bath, Connie said she didn't re-do much of the plumbing as she wanted to save money, and she did the whole project for under $5k (pictured during)</p>

<p>Finally, the vinyl flooring came from Evolved Floors, and the mirror was a splurge buy from Temple and Webster.</p>

<p>'It's one hell of an improvement from the original bathroom. Now if the boys mess it up they'll be showering outside,' Connie concluded.</p>

<p>Thousands who saw the transformation on Facebook were impressed with the results.</p>

<p>'This looks amazing, such a good job,' one woman posted.</p>

<p>'Wow, very impressive,' another added.</p>

<p>AFTER: Thousands who saw the transformation on Facebook were impressed with the results, saying it had inspired them to do their own bathroom (pictured after)</p>

<p>Some asked whether she re-did the plumbing anywhere, as this can be expensive.</p>

<p>'We kept everything else pretty much in its original place bar moving the bath to save plumbing,' Connie explained.</p>

<p>This isn't the first budget room transformation to wow the internet recently.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a mum shared how she re-did her 'boring' outdoor area and made it into an entertaining area, saving thousands by also doing it herself. </p>
