<p>Shaun Mate (pictured with paramedics on a stretcher) was rushed to hospital after being found unconscious at the family's Eden Hills home, in Adelaide's south-east on the night of July 16</p>

<p>Officers found Mate with a plastic bag over his head and a tube connecting it to a gas canister.  </p>

<p>In Adelaide Magistrates Court on Wednesday, prosecutors said Cassandra had told Mate she was leaving him just hours before the attempted 'murder-suicide'. </p>

<p>The court heard police had been called to the family's home just hours before the incident following a disturbance. </p>

<p>Police suggested the couple sleep in separate bedrooms, but when they were satisfied there was no risk of harm they left without intervention, 7News reported. </p>

<p>The court also heard police found 'suicide notes' allegedly proving Mate's plan to kill his daughter, The Adelaide Advertiser reported.   </p>

<p>Mate and the toddler were treated at the scene before they were transferred to Flinders Medical Centre in a critical condition. </p>

<p>Mate's wife and their six-month-old daughter were unharmed. </p>

<p>The girl was later transferred to the Women's and Children's Hospital and placed in a induced coma, with her mother remaining at her bedside. </p>

<p>Police allege the IT specialist had his wife 'under surveillance' by bugging her phone and emails.</p>

<p>It's further alleged he bought gas bottles and plastic bags two days before the incident, and sent 'unwanted gifts of a personal nature' to one of his wife's 'closest friends'. </p>

<p>The magistrate rejected Mate's bail application on Wednesday for the protection of his wife and their two daughters. </p>

<p>Police allege the IT specialist had been tracking his wife's phone and emails, and bought gas bottles and plastic bags two days before the alleged incident </p>

<p>'No amount of bail will make them feel safe. The thought of him getting bail frightens her no end, the prosecutor told the court.</p>

<p>Mate's lawyer Stephen White said his client was not trying to kill his daughter.</p>

<p>'There was no bag or any other device whatsoever in respect to the little girl,' he said. </p>

<p>Outside court, Mate's father said his son would never hurt his family.</p>

<p>'[He] wouldn't touch her in a fit,' he told reporters. 'I'm not going to say anything else.' </p>

<p>Mate will face court again in January.</p>
