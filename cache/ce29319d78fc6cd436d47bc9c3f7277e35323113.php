<p>A woman may have been asleep when she was crushed by a Caterpillar tractor at around 10am near Oceanside Harbor</p>

<p>The incident happened along North Pacific Drive, just south of the jetty</p>

<p>The woman, who may have been homeless, was fully clothed rather than being in a swimsuit and didn't have any identification, police spokesman Tom Bussey said.</p>

<p>The tractor was being used to move pipes, police said.</p>

<p>The tractor driver felt a bump and at first thought he had hit a dip but then turned around and saw the woman in the sand, Bussey said.</p>

<p>The tractor driver felt a bump and at first thought he had hit a dip but then turned around and saw the woman in the sand. Beachgoers walk past roped off tractors at the beach</p>

<p>Just prior to the incident, surf instructor John Daniels said he witnessed the woman talking to a city worker.</p>

<p>Daniels started recording the incident, which happened roughly 10 to 15 minutes before the woman's death.  </p>

<p>The video shows the woman lying on her side while dressed, facing the ocean. Next to her is a man in a golf cart who Daniels said works for the city. </p>

<p>The woman was fully clothed and may have been both homeless and sleep</p>

<p>Soon after the encounter, filmed around 9.48 am, the employee came to talk to Daniels. Daniels shared that the worker had offered the woman water.</p>

<p>Daniels went back to work but soon noticed lifeguards putting a yellow tarp over the woman. He ran to tell them that she was just alive but was shoo'd off and it was then that he noticed the trailer.</p>

<p>'At that point, there is nothing you can do,' Daniels added.</p>
