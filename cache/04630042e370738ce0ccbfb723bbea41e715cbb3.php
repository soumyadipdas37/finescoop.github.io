<p>Barcelona have reportedly made fresh contact with Norwich over right back Max Aarons</p>

<p>The LaLiga side are said to already have a five-year agreement with the 20-year-old defender</p>

<p>Norwich would reportedly accept a loan deal for this season as long as a permanent transfer was agreed for the end of the campaign.</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman is a fan of the 20-year-old after watching him in action last season and is now the Dutchman's preferred option with Dest set to join Bayern.</p>

<p>Aarons played in all 36 Premier League games for Norwich last season and covered more distance than Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>

<p>Norwich are holding out for a £20million bid after rejecting a loan offer from the Catalans</p>

<p>His passing accuracy in the final third was one of the highest among the league's full backs despite his side finishing the season bottom of the table.</p>

<p>The defender has played in both of Norwih's Championship fixtures this season which have included a draw against Preston and a victory over Huddersfield.</p>

<p>Aarons has also been linked with Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen but it is understood his preference is to complete a move to the Nou Camp.</p>
