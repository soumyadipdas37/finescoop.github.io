<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The EFL have appealed against the decision by an independent panel to clear Derby County of breaching spending rules relating to their valuation of Pride Park.</p>

<p>The Championship club escaped a points deduction after charges over the £80million sale of their stadium and the assigning of players a residual transfer value at the end of their contracts were dismissed by a three-person tribunal.</p>

<p>The dropping of the charges is a blow to the EFL who won an independent tribunal against Sheffield Wednesday which led to the Owls receiving a 12-point deduction. </p>

<p>The EFL have appealed against an independent panel dropping charges against Derby County </p>

<p>A statement from the league said: 'The EFL Board has determined the League will appeal against the outcome of an independent Disciplinary Commission in respect of misconduct charges brought against Derby County. </p>

<p>'The appeal is specific to the second charge only, which considered the Club’s policy regarding the amortisation of intangible assets. </p>

<p>'There will be no further comment at this time.'</p>

<p>Derby's case relates to the valuation of Pride Park when owner Mel Morris sold the ground to another of his companies for £80m last year despite it previously being listed as worth £41m, a sale which enabled the club to comply with the EFL's spending rules by limiting their losses.</p>

<p>Derby were subjected to two charges from the EFL but both have been dismissed by a panel </p>

<p>A second charge over how Derby measure the value of players — called amortisation — in their accounts was also dismissed, although the panel did conclude that 'the wording of the amortisation policy in Derby's financial statements could have been clearer'.</p>

<p>Most clubs spread the transfer fee they have paid for a player over the life of his contract, valuing their worth at £0 at the end of their deal.</p>

<p>However, Derby have assigned a residual value since 2015 which has boosted their accounts.  </p>

<p>The EFL are also facing calls to remove Derby County CEO Stephen Pearce from the league's board over the misconduct.  </p>
