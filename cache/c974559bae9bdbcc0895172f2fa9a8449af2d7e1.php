<p>She told Is This Normal from Little Spoon in support of the Black Women’s Health Imperative nonprofit that she had hopes to have a natural childbirth but complications led doctors to deliver the baby via C-section.</p>

<p>'I stopped having contractions and it was just time to call it and get him out safely, so I just wish I had done a better job at preparing myself for the shock of a c-section, because the postpartum of a c-section is so brutal.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I wish people talked more about their c-section stories because I felt, like a lot of mothers, really isolated, really lonely, right after because it was this unexpected major surgery I ended up getting.'  </p>
