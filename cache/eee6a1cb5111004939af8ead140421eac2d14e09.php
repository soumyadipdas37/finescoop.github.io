<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Scott Parker has admitted Fulham owner Tony Khan's comments promising new players and improved performances were 'not helpful'.</p>

<p>Parker hit back at the Cottagers chief after he took to Twitter to apologise to fans following Monday night's 3-0 home defeat by Aston Villa.</p>

<p>The result has left newly-promoted Fulham rock bottom of the Premier League after just three games, and the young manager is unhappy with the owner's decision to air his thoughts in public. </p>

<p>Fulham boss Scott Parker has responded to owner Tony Khan's comments on Twitter </p>

<p>Fulham owner Khan issued an apology on Twitter after the club's latest heavy defeat</p>

<p>He said on Tuesday: 'It's not something I agree with it, it's not something that is helpful. </p>

<p>'The one thing I'm disappointed with is that he apologised for the performance. The other bits, it is what it is.'</p>

<p>Parker would not be draw on transfers with Fulham facing a race against time to add to their squad before the window closes next Monday. </p>

<p>He added: 'We were in the market since Wembley. The people in the club are working their hardest. Hopefully we can get some help.' </p>

<p>Khan revealed his struggle to bring in new players to boost the club on social media straight after Monday night's defeat. </p>

<p>The businessman tweeted: 'I apologise to Fulham supporters for our performance tonight.</p>

<p>The 3-0 drubbing at home to Aston Villa caused Khan to issue an apology via his social media</p>

<p>Khan continued to apologise and pledged that the playing squad would enhance their efforts</p>

<p>'We've looked to add centre-backs since [winning promotion at] Wembley. I'm sorry we haven't yet as two got COVID-19 and we lost a free we thought was close and had another issue with a fourth.</p>

<p>'I promise players in and better efforts from this squad. I should and will apologise repeatedly for that performance.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, everybody. We all need to do a better job. Everyone at the club for the past year worked really hard to get the team up and now we need to work significantly harder to stay up. I promise better efforts than today.'</p>

<p>The Cottagers have conceded 10 goals in three Premier League matches this season, losing 3-0 at home to Arsenal on the opening day before Leeds again exposed their defensive shortcomings in a 4-3 thriller. </p>

<p>Goals by Jack Grealish and Conor Hourihane left them with a mountain to climb after just 15 minutes in their latest ominous defeat, with Tyrone Mings all but ending the contest just after half-time.</p>

<p>Fulham are bottom of the Premier League on goal difference after the 3-0 defeat by Aston Villa</p>

<p>Boss Scott Parker and Khan have been keen to improve their options since winning promotion</p>

<p>Boss Parker said he had not been aware of the details of Khan's failed attempts to bolster his options.</p>

<p>The rookie coach admitted: 'I wouldn't know. I honestly wouldn't know. I think the people in the places to be at this football club make them decisions.</p>

<p>'I've highlighted where I think we need to improve. I've highlighted that straight after Wembley. Not just defenders, just where we need to improve in this team.</p>

<p>'I think in terms of defending we weren't good enough tonight and we've not been good enough for the first three games this season.</p>

<p>'I think we all know we need to address that. It was an area we've certainly brought up and it's an area that everyone at the football club hopefully can see as well, to be fair.</p>

<p>'I thought we played very, very well for large parts, but the first time they came into our box they scored, and the second time they scored another goal and you just can't give up goals like we have and expect to win games in this division.</p>

<p>'I think you see that at the other end for them. We got up to their goal pretty well but they defended it.'</p>
