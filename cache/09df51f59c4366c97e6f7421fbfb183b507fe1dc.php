<p>Xie Dapeng, mayor of Ruili, announced the two confirmed cases during a press briefing on Monday.</p>

<p>A 32-year-old Myanmar woman took her three children and two nannies across the border from Muse, Myanmar, to Ruili on September 3, and stayed at her sister's residence at the Aoxing Shiji community.</p>

<p>The woman and one of her nannies tested positive for the contagion and were diagnosed as confirmed coronavirus infections on Sunday, the authorities said.</p>

<p>The Chinese authorities also said they will also assist Myanmar government with anti-virus efforts and financial support to help villages bordering the country build strong epidemic prevention and control checkpoints.</p>

<p>Myanmar has seen a surge in new coronavirus cases. On Friday, the country re-imposed tough measures to control the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>China has appeared to have largely contained the virus outbreak as the country has gone a month without new cases of domestic infection.</p>

<p>Last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping touted China's role in battling the coronavirus pandemic at a triumphant awards ceremony for medical professionals decorated with bugle calls and applause.</p>

<p>He told the audience that China has acted in an 'open and transparent' manner over the contagion while 'passing an extraordinary and historic test'.</p>

<p>The upbeat mood in Beijing comes as concerns grow about a resurgence of COVID-19 across Europe, with France tightening restrictions, cases in Britain spiking and schools resuming around the region in recent days.</p>

<p>Worldwide infections to date now stand at more than 29 million and over 924,000 people have died from the disease, with the pandemic showing no sign of peaking.</p>

<p>But in China the virus has been all but banished through a combination of lockdowns and travel restrictions earlier in the year that have officials touting the nation as a coronavirus success story.</p>
