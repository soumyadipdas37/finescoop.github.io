<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The traditionally Conservative heartlands will have to find space for 1.5million new homes under the Government's 'mutant' planning algorithms.</p>

<p>The plans will require tens of thousands of extra homes over the next 15 years to be built in rural counties like Kent, Surrey and Devon. </p>

<p>Tory MPs who have been left unimpressed with the proposals have pinned the blame on a 'mutant algorithm'. </p>

<p>The initiative will see an additional five million homes built across England over the next 15 years, with nearly a third in rural counties.</p>

<p>According to analysis by the House of Commons library, the target is two million more than that which was previously agreed upon by local councils. </p>

<p>Writing for The Telegraph, Tory MP Bob Seely said: 'We all agree we need to build housing, but we need to build the right housing in the right places.</p>

<p>'The key fact is this: cities across England are being asked to build relatively less compared with the rural and suburban areas around them. Instead of levelling up the North, I fear we are concreting out the South'.</p>

<p>He continued: 'The algorithm row, which will worsen the more our constituents across England know about it, is an unnecessary, self-inflicted wound.</p>

<p>The traditionally Conservative heartlands will have to find space for 1.5million new homes under the Government's 'mutant' planning algorithms</p>

<p>'Britons in the Red Wall seats will see little change in their communities as infrastructure cash goes to the shires. Shire voters will react with anger at swathes of greenfield planning.'</p>

<p>Crispin Truman, chief executive of the countryside charity CPRE, also spoke out against the plans. </p>

<p>'Governing by algorithm simply doesn't work. We are in the midst of a housing crisis, and we need many more well designed, genuinely affordable homes, including in rural areas,' he said. </p>

<p>The initiative will see an additional five million homes built across England over the next 15 years, with nearly a third in rural counties</p>

<p>'But combining this algorithm with far reaching, untested reforms to local planning, could result in irreparable harm to our countryside, without delivering the housing we actually need.</p>

<p>'Local authorities could be powerless to prevent developers cherry-picking green field sites whilst leaving brownfield land unused.'</p>

<p>A Government source told the Telegraph: 'These figures are purely speculative. We are consulting on the new proposed formula, which will only be the starting point in the process of planning new homes.'</p>
