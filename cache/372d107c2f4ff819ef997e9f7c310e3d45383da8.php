<p>However, Nine's Director of News and Current Affairs, Darren Wick, denied this in a statement to Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'The New Idea story is made-up. We've had no discussions with Mel Doyle. I really like her as a presenter and a person but, right now, we don't have any positions available,' Wick said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another report in Woman's Day alleges that Melissa is being headhunted for Channel 10's The Project.</p>

<p>Apparently, executive producer Rove McManus is trying get the show's budget in order so they can afford to hire the former Sunrise anchor.</p>

<p>'Lisa [Wilkinson, the host of The Sunday Project] is up for renewal, and the guess is she will take a big pay cut to make way for Mel to step in as a regular on The Project,' a source told the magazine.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment.</p>

<p>Friends and co-hosts? The 50-year-old veteran journalist is rumoured to be fielding offers from multiple networks, including Nine and 10. Woman's Day claims she is being headhunted for Channel 10's The Project, which is hosted by Lisa Wilkinson (left)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Sydney Morning Herald reported over the weekend that 'Doyle clearly intends to stay in television' following her departure from Seven.</p>

<p>The mother of two doesn't have a TV gig for the time being, but she is still hosting a weekend morning show on Smooth FM.</p>

<p>Outside of her media career, she is an ambassador for the Alannah &amp; Madeline Foundation, Westmead Children's Hospital, World Vision, the Children's Cancer Institute and the National Breast Cancer Foundation.</p>

<p>Rumours: According to New Idea, Nine is said to be 'pulling out all the stops' to sign Melissa for an unspecified breakfast or morning TV role</p>

<p>She was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 2016 for her 'significant service to the community through representational roles with a range of charitable groups, and to the broadcast media'.</p>

<p>Melissa announced her exit from Seven on August 21, after 25 years of service.</p>

<p>Her departure is believed to be the result of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit Seven particularly hard.</p>

<p>Fake news! However, Nine executive Darren Wick told Daily Mail Australia: 'We've had no discussions with Mel Doyle. I like her as a presenter and a person but, right now, we don't have any positions available,' Wick said. Pictured: Today hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon</p>

<p>She said in a statement: 'For 25 years, I have called Channel Seven home. I've had the privilege to share stories that mattered, meet incredible people and be there for significant moments in history.</p>

<p>'I am incredibly proud of the work I have done and appreciative of the trust and warmth our viewers have shown me.</p>

<p>'I want to thank the consummate professionals I have worked with along the way, in particular our Chairman Kerry Stokes for his constant support.'</p>

<p>She concluded: 'I leave Seven with a great deal of pride, satisfaction and gratitude.'</p>
