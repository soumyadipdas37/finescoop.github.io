<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Inter Milan 'will try and sign Chris Smalling from Manchester United' if they sell Milan Skriniar to Tottenham Hotspur.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho has identified the Slovakia international as a defensive target before the transfer window closes on October 5 but Spurs want to drive down Inter's £46million asking price.</p>

<p>But if Skriniar was to leave for London, Inter have reportedly identified Smalling as his replacement.</p>

<p>Inter Milan 'could move for Chris Smalling', the Manchester United defender who spent last season on loan at Roma, if Milan Skriniar is signed by Tottenham before the deadline</p>

<p>Inter's Slovakian defender Skriniar, valued at £46m, has been linked with a Tottenham move</p>

<p>It appears Smalling has no future at Old Trafford after spending last season on loan in Serie A with Roma.</p>

<p>Roma haven't yet agreed a permanent deal with the Englishman and, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter could pounce.</p>

<p>Smalling, 30, is valued at £18m by United but could become the fourth player to swap Old Trafford for the San Siro in recent months after Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez and Ashley Young.</p>

<p>As Sportsmail reported this week, Smalling is growing frustrated at United after being left in limbo as talks continue.</p>

<p>Smalling has been training twice a week at Man United's training ground as he waits to move</p>

<p>Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho would like to sign Skriniar to reinforce their defence </p>

<p>The defender is training on his own twice a day at United's Carrington training ground to keep up his match fitness after returning from his Roma loan.</p>

<p>Smalling is unhappy that negotiations over a permanent move to Roma haven't progressed faster and has been in regular contact with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>

<p>The former England centre-back believes United should be doing more to give him the move he wants after spending a decade on the books at Old Trafford since a £10m transfer from Fulham in 2010.</p>

<p>However, United are refusing to budge on their valuation at a time when they need to generate as much money as possible to finance new signings.</p>
