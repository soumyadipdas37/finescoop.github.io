<p>Another woman said she purchased just five single bananas but ended up with 25 while one family revealed they received $45 worth of ginger for free. </p>

<p>One pet owner said: 'I ordered 20 cans of cat food and they sent me 168... at least my cats are well fed for a while.'</p>

<p>Many asked the woman whether she had made a mistake by accidentally adding 17 bags of carrots to her order but she insisted she only purchased two.</p>

<p>However, an employee defended the supermarket, claiming she's noticed a number of customers mistakenly ordering more items than intended.</p>

<p>'Trust me, I do online orders at Woolies. No one packs this by accident, but it's relatively common that people order kilos of produce by mistakes,' she commented on the video.</p>

<p>'I had someone order 35 bags of mushrooms one time. When they came in to pick up, they said they only meant to order one.'</p>
