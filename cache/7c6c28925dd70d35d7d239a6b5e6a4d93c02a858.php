<p>Police say Hughes used a brick to smash a window of Eminem's mansion while the rapper was sleeping after slipping past his security. </p>

<p>Hughes was also arrested in June last year for trespassing on two Michigan properties, including one of Eminem's former homes. </p>

<p>Hughes was also arrested in June last year for trespassing on two Michigan properties, including one of Eminem's former homes (pictured above)</p>

<p>Hughes was filmed initially trying to open the front door and was then caught on camera peering into the home.</p>

<p>At one point, he appeared to ring the doorbell and then calmly waited outside the door.   </p>

<p>The homeowner later told police in that incident that Hughes was 'looking for his brother, Marshall'. </p>

<p>Hughes was told to leave but was later found hiding in the property's gatehouse. He was subsequently arrested for breaking and entering and sentenced to 90 days in jail.   </p>

<p>The footage re-emerged this week as Hughes faced court over the most recent incident stemming from April.   </p>

<p>Clinton Township Detective Dan Quinn testified on Wednesday during a court hearing that multiple angles of security footage showed Hughes on the premises for 'quite some time' before he climbed through the smashed window. </p>

<p>The rapper, who has a net worth of $210 million, woke at about 4am on April 5 after hearing his security alarm go off when Hughes allegedly smashed a window. </p>

<p>When he went to investigate, Eminem told police he found Hughes standing in his living room.   </p>

<p>The officer who responded to the scene that night, Adam Hackstock testified that he arrived to find Hughes wrestling with a security guard outside the mansion. </p>

<p>The officer testified that Eminem told him he had woken up and found Hughes standing in his home.  </p>

<p>'When Mr Mathers asked him why he was there, he was told by Mr Hughes that he was there to kill him,' Hackstock said on the stand. </p>

<p>Hackstock said that Eminem told him he escorted Hughes out of the home through a TV area, game room and basketball court.</p>

<p>He shouted for his security who detained Hughes until officers arrived. Hughes was taken into custody that same day.    </p>

<p>Hughes appeared in Macomb County District Court on Wednesday. He is being held on a $50,000 cash bond and the judge denied a request by Hughes' attorney to reduce the bond</p>

<p>Eminem is well-known for his 2000 track 'Stan' which tells the story of an over zealous fan who becomes a stalker named Stanley 'Stan' Mitchell. </p>

<p>The influential song is where the term 'stan culture' comes from, describing dedicated fans of famous stars, who refer to themselves as 'stans.' </p>

<p>The song is a cautionary tale to fans about taking everything your idol says literally. </p>

<p>In the lyrics, Eminem reveals how the character Stan starts writing him several letters, over three verses, where he becomes more obsessive and angrier when he doesn't get a reply from the star. </p>

<p>Authorities have previously said they believe Hughes wanted to meet the rapper face-to-face.  </p>

<p>Authorities have said Hughes is homeless and his court-appointed attorney had initially sought a competency hearing for him, which Hughes declined. </p>

<p>'In my opinion, I think there´s some sort of mental issues involved here,' defense attorney Paul Glanda said outside court on Wednesday in reference to his client. </p>

<p>Hughes is being held on a $50,000 cash bond and Judge Jacob Femminineo Jr denied a request by Hughes' attorney to reduce the bond.</p>

<p>The judge ruled there was probable cause to move forward with a trial.</p>

<p>He scheduled a September 28 arraignment in Macomb County Circuit Court.</p>

<p>Eminem was not in court on Wednesday.  </p>
