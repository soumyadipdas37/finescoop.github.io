<p>In homage to the baking show, Noel also held a whisk in his hand in the image which he posted to his Instagram page, alongside the caption: 'Boom'.</p>

<p>The show's Instagram account also posted the same image on its page alongside a pun-filled caption, which read: </p>

<p>Mama, I just baked a flan! The show's Instagram account also posted the same image on its page alongside a pun-filled caption</p>

<p>‘Mama, I just baked a flan, made a bun and then some bread, tried a cake, but recipe misread. Mama, I wanted cinnamon buns, but they've burnt and I've thrown them all away... Got #BakeOff on the mind? The new series starts Tuesday at 8pm on.'</p>

<p>The Channel 4 baking contest, now in its 11th series, will welcome 12 home-bakers to the tent with the first show-stopping challenge to create their hero out of sponge.   </p>

<p>But fans were left shocked after the show has brought back an animated tribute to the saucy squirrel in their advert which was cut following the 2011 series two final.  </p>

<p>Funny: The Great British Bake Off is set to return with innuendos galore alongside baked bare breasts and a cartoon tribute to the very 'well-endowed' squirrel mascot</p>

<p>In the showstopper challenge, accountant Hemine, 39, from London, creates a tribute to the Black Panther film star Lupita Nyong'o, according to The Sun. </p>

<p>The amateur baker crafted the naked shoulders and bosom of the actress, 37, with presenter Noel Fielding commenting: 'I don’t think I’ve ever fancied a cake before, but I slightly do now.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile accounting and finance student Peter, 20, who is the youngest in the line-up, creates a baked portrait of six-time Olympic champion cyclist Sir Chris Hoy. </p>

<p>Rodent: Fans were left shocked after the show has brought back an animated tribute to the saucy squirrel in their advert which was cut following the 2011 series two final</p>

<p>However the baker was left red-faced when judge Pure Leith, 80, remarks: 'I'm loving the helmet.' </p>

<p>Aside from the baking innuendoes, the Channel 4 show has also caused a stir with the return of the 'well-endowed' squirrel mascot.  </p>

<p>The rodent graced the screens up until the series two final in 2011 where he was subject to a lingering camera shot. </p>

<p>Innuendo: In the showstopper challenge, accountant Hemine, 39, from London, creates a tribute to the Black Panther film star Lupita Nyong'o</p>

<p>However Great British Bake Off bosses sacked the 'full-frontal' squirrel for a pheasant for the 2016 series. </p>

<p>But fans have gone nuts after the popular mascot has returned on the advert for the show in cartoon form. </p>

<p>The ad is in the form of a vintage-style tea towel featuring the slogan 'Bake Off's Back' and an emblem to the masculine squirrel in a gold frame holding a gherkin. </p>

<p>Care assistant Dwight McClean, 34, spotted the advert at a bus stop in Hounslow, West London, and told The Sun: 'It doesn’t go with the Bake Off theme. It’s something that’s pornographic. </p>

<p>Red-faced: Accounting and finance student Peter, 20, who is the youngest in the line-up, creates a baked portrait of six-time Olympic champion cyclist Sir Chris Hoy</p>

<p>'He has his penis out. He has his legs apart and you can see his testicles as they are so large.' </p>

<p>Others took to Twitter to share their amusement at the prominent rodent on the ad. </p>

<p>One said: 'I'm happy as anyone bake off is back. But I'm distracted by that's squirrel's nuts...'  </p>

<p>Another added: 'So this years bake off adverts feature a squirrel with big ole **** and balls.' </p>

<p>Questionable? Fans took to Twitter to share their amusement at the prominent rodent on the ad</p>

<p>The upcoming series took place at Down Hall Hotel in Essex after five years of filming at Welford Park in Berkshire, with all cast and crew members undergoing regular COVID-19 testing in an isolation bubble amid the pandemic. </p>

<p>Producers said they drew up a list of safety rules 'longer than the Bible' before filming started for the new socially-distanced series with Paul Hollywood's signature handshake given the green light despite fears of spreading the virus and claims it could be replaced with an elbow bump.   </p>

<p>At the height of lockdown, the hit Channel 4 series signed an exclusive deal with luxury Down Hall Hotel and Spa in Essex, located on 110 acres of land, to hire it out in late July for the entire series. </p>

<p>Another added: 'So this years bake off adverts feature a squirrel with big ole **** and balls'</p>

<p>The Observer reported that the country house and hotel, just a stone's throw from celebrity chef Paul's £1 million Grade II listed farmhouse in Kent, allowed the show to book it out on a self-catering basis with 25 members of staff on hand to help out. </p>

<p>The popular show had been scheduled to go into production back in April, before the pandemic, and subsequent lockdown, scuppered all plans. </p>

<p>The publication claims that contestants were then allowed to move into the hotel with their partners, children or pet pooches - if they wished to do so - with measures put in place for child and dog care on set while filming for six weeks. The hit show is usually shot over a 12 week period with bakers travelling to and from their homes.   </p>

<p>Exciting: The Great British Bake Off 2020 is due to hit screens on September 22 with the 12 home-bakers competing for the prize unveiled last week  with the show overhauling its filming process to adhere to the coronavirus crisis (judges and hosts pictured) </p>

<p>Before entering the 'biosphere', the contestants had to quarantine for nine days with the 130 people involved with the show tested three times before filming.  </p>

<p>The publication claims that the luxury country house had different wings for cast and crew with new host Matt Lucas even hosting fun nights for show members. </p>

<p>Creative Director of Love Productions, Kieran Smith, told the Observer: 'The whole point of the bubble [was] being able to be close to each other or pat people on the back, or it wouldn't be Bake Off.'  </p>

<p>Elsewhere, as well as the show's bubble, anything coming in and out of the Bake Off 'biosphere', including luggage and food deliveries, had to be deep-cleaned with packets of flour even cleaned several times.   </p>

<p>Despite being considered a high-risk candidate for coronavirus at 80, judge Prue decided to make a comeback to the much-loved series.  </p>

<p>TV sources previously claimed producers banned older contestants who are considered vulnerable to the virus. </p>

<p>Hollywood handshake! Producers said they drew up a list of safety rules 'longer than the Bible' before filming started for the new socially-distanced series with Paul Hollywood's signature handshake given the green light despite fears of spreading the virus and claims it could be replaced with an elbow bump (pictured on the 2019 series) </p>

<p>An insider told The Sun: 'There's a real sense of urgency to get the next series of Bake Off in the can, considering it's one of Channel 4's biggest draws.</p>

<p>'That means the nation's baking grans and grandads have been deemed too high risk. Bake Off's wizened contestants are often the heart of the show. Val, who would 'listen' to cakes to work out if they were done, and rapping septuagenarian Flo became favourites.'</p>

<p>Kelly Webb-Lamb, deputy director of programmes and head of popular factual for Channel 4, recently admitted it was an 'enormous' feat getting the show back on air. </p>

<p>One big bubble: The upcoming series took place at Down Hall Hotel in Essex after five years of filming at Welford Park in Berkshire, with all cast and crew members undergoing regular COVID-19 testing in an isolation bubble amid the pandemic (the 2020 contestants pictured in the tent)  </p>

<p>Stringent: Elsewhere, as well as the show's bubble, anything coming in and out of the Bake Off 'biosphere', including luggage and food deliveries, had to be deep-cleaned with packets of flour even cleaned several times (contestant Linda)  </p>

<p>The TV executive credited stringent health and safety measures, testing and quarantine regimes for the return of the baking hit. </p>

<p>While fellow judge, Paul, 54, was given the green light to give out his signature Hollywood handshakes due to the bubble despite fears of spreading the virus.  </p>

<p>The food expert's handshake is widely regarded as the golden ticket for bakers who aim to meet his high expectations or win Star Baker of the week.  </p>

<p>In with the new: The Bake Off tent pictured in the grounds of Down Hall Hotel in Essex </p>

<p>Kieran, of show maker Love Productions, confirmed recently that his iconic gesture will take place in the series despite fears it could be scrapped. </p>

<p>The first time fans witnessed his congratulatory move was in series three of the former BBC show. The show was relaunched on Channel 4 in 2017 and saw him dish out another seven handshakes in just one run.   </p>

<p>Channel 4 clarified they followed strict safety protocol so that all parties were free to handshake to their heart's content.  </p>

<p>Isolation: The publication claims that contestants were then allowed to move into the hotel with their partners, children or pet pooches - if they wished to do so - with measures put in place for child and dog care on set while filming for six weeks (contestants, Dave and Makbul L-R pictured) </p>

<p>GBBO revealed in August they had finished filming for the upcoming series. Posting a picture of the iconic kitchen to Instagram, they penned: 'Filming has wrapped on the new series of The Great British Bake Off. More news soon...'   </p>

<p>Fellow Bake Off presenter Sandi Toksvig revealed that she had left the show earlier this year and was replaced by Little Britain comedian Matt Lucas </p>

<p>Matt will partner up with fellow funnyman, Noel Fielding, 47, who originally joined the Great British Bake Off Cast in 2017. </p>

<p>Quarantine: Before entering the 'biosphere', the contestants had to quarantine for nine days with the 130 people involved with the show tested three times before filming (contestants Marc, left, and Lottie, right) </p>

<p>The first official still from The Great British Bake Off was released earlier this month, and saw judges Paul and Prue as well as co-hosts Matt and Noel pose with cake.</p>

<p>Matt recently revealed that he has 'put a lot of weight' on during hosting and he only got two hours sleep prior to his presenting debut as he was so nervous.   </p>

<p>The new series of The Great British Bake Off will begin on Channel 4 on September 22 at 8pm. </p>
