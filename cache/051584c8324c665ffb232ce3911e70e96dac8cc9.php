<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Channel Seven's new cooking competition show Plate of Origin is struggling in the ratings. </p>

<p>Despite a huge promotional push from the network, the show premiered on Sunday night to 667,000 metro viewers.</p>

<p>The numbers have continued to drop each night, with 510,000 viewers tuning in for Monday's episode, while just 419,000 people watched on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Tough times: Channel Seven's new cooking competition show Plate of Origin is struggling in the ratings</p>

<p>Not only was Plate of Origin defeated in the ratings by Channel 10's The Masked Singer and Nine's The Block, even Anh’s Brush with Fame on the ABC pulled in more viewers.</p>

<p>Speaking to news.com.au, former TV executive Rob McKnight from TV Blackbox said: 'The show’s dead.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'With stiff competition of The Block, Plate of Origin just isn’t firing. When you get a drop-off like you did from night one to night two, that’s an indication that the show’s not strong enough for viewers to return.'</p>

<p>Oh no! Not only was Plate of Origin defeated in the ratings by Channel 10's The Masked Singer and Nine's The Block, even Anh’s Brush with Fame on the ABC pulled in more viewers. (Pictured: Plate of Origin's Matt Preston)</p>

<p>McKnight believes that viewers enjoyed the most recent season of MasterChef so much that they're not interested in Plate of Origin, which he said has a 'confusing format'.</p>

<p>Despite Plate of Origin bombing, Seven's had a strong year with the success of both Big Brother and Farmer Wants a Wife.</p>

<p>The recent Farmer finale pulled in a national audience of 1.472 million. A second season has now been commissioned and will air in 2021. </p>

<p>Angus Ross, Seven’s network programming director, told MediaWeek last month: 'We’ve reinvented our 2020 entertainment schedule with proven, powerful formats and Farmer Wants A Wife has continued the ratings momentum created by our relaunch of Big Brother.</p>

<p>'Number one nationally, major growth in key demos and streaming numbers that have kept 7plus number one – it’s a multi-platform winner.'</p>

<p>In addition to new seasons of Farmer and Big Brother, Seven will also air The Voice next year after securing the rights to the show from rival Nine.</p>
