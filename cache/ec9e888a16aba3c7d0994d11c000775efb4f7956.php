<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A teaching assistant has today been found guilty of sending a topless picture to a 15-year-old student, but been cleared of having sex with him.</p>

<p>Kandice Barber was accused of having sex with the teenager in a field and sending him topless pictures of herself on Snapchat.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old from Wendover in Buckinghamshire, was today found guilty of sending a topless photo and an explicit video to the boy. </p>

<p>The jury at Aylesbury Crown Court found her not guilty of having sex with the teenager in a field in October 2018.   </p>

<p>The student claimed the mother-of-three had told him he 'had a bigger penis than her husband' and that she was pregnant with his child.</p>

<p>She was arrested after the boy revealed the alleged relationship to the headteacher in March 2019 after naked pictures of Barber circulated around the school in Buckinghamshire, the court heard.</p>

<p>Teacher Kandice Barber, 35, leaves Aylesbury Crown Court, Buckinghamshire, with her husband Daniel yesterday </p>

<p>The student claimed the mother-of-three (pictured with husband Daniel), had told him he had a bigger penis than her husband</p>

<p>Throughout the trial, Barber's husband Daniel has dutifully accompanied her to court each day and gave evidence on her behalf. </p>

<p>In her evidence, Barber said she had given the teenager her number so he could talk to her about any issues and denied the conversations were sexual.</p>

<p>She told the court she never sent him topless pictures of herself and claimed the My Eyes Only folder in her Snapchat had been hacked.</p>

<p>She said she became uncomfortable with the boy's phone calls and when she refused to have any contact with him she claimed he sent a message reading: 'Watch what's going to happen, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your family.'</p>

<p>In November 2018 Barber was off school for two weeks after suffering an ectopic pregnancy.</p>

<p>She denied ever telling the complainant the baby could be his, but said the fact that she had lost a baby was well known around the school.</p>

<p>Giving evidence in court, her husband, Daniel Barber, said they had been trying for a baby around the time of the alleged offences.</p>

<p>Barber (pictured with her husband) said she had given the teenager her number so he could talk to her about any issues</p>

<p>Jurors had previously been told Barber had searched 'What is the name of someone you are having an affair with?' and the word 'alibi' on Google.</p>

<p>She also searched 'a lie of where you have been' then 'good secluded areas,' and 'Holiday Inn, Wycombe.'</p>

<p>But the teacher claimed in evidence she was just trying to find out the name of the film Fatal Attraction and only enquired about 'secluded areas' for her dog walks.</p>

<p>Call records obtained by Thames Valley Police, who had investigated the boy's claims after Barber was arrested in March last year, showed the two had spoken months after the alleged affair was said to have ended. </p>

<p>Barber denied three counts of causing or inciting a child aged under 16 to engage in a sexual act and one count of sexual communication with a child.</p>

<p>She also pleaded not guilty to one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activities while in a position of trust, and one count of causing a child to watch a sexual act by a person in a position of trust.</p>
