<p>The family of four escaped out of a window with the help of neighbours as the blaze engulfed their Kitchener St home, 9News reports. </p>

<p>Queensland Fire and Emergency Service Inspector Rohan Wilschefsk said it was lucky everyone escaped before firefighters arrived as road resurfacing last week had blocked the hydrants.  </p>

<p>'The pavement had gone over the top of the fire hydrants so when the crews arrived they were unable to find them or get access to them,' he told the Courier Mail.  </p>

<p> 'It wasn’t until urban utilities came and told where the hydrants were located that we were able to dig them up and get access to those hydrants.'</p>

<p>'We were just lucky enough that everybody go out before we got here.' </p>

<p>Inspector Wilschefsck said crews had to stretch their hoses to other hydrants in neighbouring streets, causing delays.</p>

<p>Despite their best efforts, the home was completely destroyed alongside two other units within the apartment block and an adjacent house was also damaged. </p>

<p>The four families left homeless are being assisted by the Fire Service to find accommodation. </p>

<p>Police have set up a crime scene and the blaze is being treated as suspicious.  </p>

<p>Investigations remain underway. </p>

<p>The inferno (pictured) destroyed four properties, leaving several families now homeless </p>
