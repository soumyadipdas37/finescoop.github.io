<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A private investigator turned 'Coffin Confessor' who gets paid to carry out the wishes of the dead has revealed more of his client's bizarre final requests.</p>

<p>Bill Edgar, 52, quit his job on the Gold Coast three years ago when a terminally ill man asked him to interrupt his funeral to tell his best mate he knew he was 'trying to screw' his wife. </p>

<p>He has since gatecrashed dozens of funerals to pass on messages the dead couldn't get off their chest when they were alive.      </p>

<p>His upcoming jobs involve a man who betrayed his brother for years and a millionaire father ready to share the secrets of his wealth. </p>

<p>Bill Edgar, 52, (pictured) has been dubbed the 'Coffin Confessor' after quitting his job as a private investigator on the Gold Coast two years ago to gatecrash funerals</p>

<p>'I can tell you that I have a brother that's confessing to sleeping with his brother's wife for the last six years,' he told news.com.au</p>

<p>Another secret involves exposing a so-called businessman's real source of wealth. </p>

<p>The man in his 80s never worked a day in his life, but was telling his family for years he had worked in offshore deals and sales.</p>

<p>But he actually won the Gold Lotto.  </p>

<p>'He never told anyone in his family and his family continues to think he's the best businessman in the world and he's never worked a day in his life. He's fooled them all – he just won lotto. He lives a great life,' Mr Edgar said.  </p>

<p>Bill Edgar was a private investigator until an elderly man asked him to intercept his funeral three years ago to call out his best friend for 'trying to screw' his wife</p>

<p>He will also reveal how much of that money the family will be inheriting. </p>

<p>'That's going to be a shock to a few in the family.' </p>

<p>Speaking on the Kyle and Jackie O show on Tuesday, Mr Edgar - whose clients pay up to $10,000 for his services - revealed some of his most shocking past confessions.</p>

<p>'I've exposed family secrets, sexual affairs and intimate relationships between brothers and sisters,' he told the stunned hosts.</p>

<p>Mr Edgar said his worst job was when he had to reveal a girlfriend had slept with her partner's mother and father.</p>

<p>Along with airing people's dirty laundry, Mr Edgar spends most of his time purging his dead clients' homes of embarrassing items to spare their families the discomfort (stock image of a funeral)</p>

<p>Another request involved telling the family of a bikie gang member that he was gay and his lover was in the crowd.</p>

<p>'Half a dozen people left, a couple gave me the finger and told me that I was going to get bashed, but the majority said, 'we know what he was like, and we knew'.'</p>

<p>To avoid gatecrashing funerals with false assumptions and accusations, Mr Edgar uses his private investigation skills to verify his clients' claims.</p>

<p>'I've got to get some actual facts too - I've got to look in to it. I can't just go to a funeral and announce bullsh**t, it's got to be legitimate stuff.'</p>

<p>The Coffin Confessor is growing increasingly busy after introducing a new online offering</p>

<p>Along with airing the dead's dirty laundry, Mr Edgar spends most of his time purging his dead clients' homes of embarrassing items to spare their families the discomfort.</p>

<p>One customer was an 88-year-old man from Toowoomba in Queensland who asked the coffin confessor to clean his attic.</p>

<p>'He said 'you're going to find some items in there that are going to shock you''.</p>

<p>'I got in the attic and there's a sex swing, there's toys - you name it, it was there.'</p>

<p>Mr Edgar explained that he never has to ask his clients questions about their seemingly bizarre secrets because 'they divulge everything ... they've got nothing to lose'.</p>

<p>Some clients have also used his services to confess to crimes.</p>

<p>While he is obliged to report admissions to the police, Mr Edgar skirts around the problem by asking the person write confession down in a letter and address it to themselves.</p>

<p>The coffin confessor picks the unopened letter up after the client dies and places it in a drawer and leaves it there.</p>

<p>Bill Edgar has also been asked to prick some clients in the arm with a pin before the burial to make sure they're really dead</p>

<p>'It's illegal to open someone else's mail,' he said.</p>

<p>Other strange requests come from clients who want want to be buried with specific items, such as money, firearms, and mobile phones with torches because they're scared of the dark.</p>

<p>Some ask for glass coffins, caskets filled with water or fitted with speakers programmed to make screaming sounds as it's lowered into the ground. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Coffin Confessor is becoming increasingly busy after introducing a new online offering.</p>

<p>For $10 Australians can head online to upload eulogies or confessions which will be sent to a nominated family member when they die. </p>

<p>Part his newfound demand is linked to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Since the crisis hit he has received more than 8200 uploads on the site. </p>

<p>Bill Edgar has since made a thriving business divulging his dead clients' explosive secrets to their heartbroken families during burials and will readings</p>
