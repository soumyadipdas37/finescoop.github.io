<p>'Seeing all of your body confidence posts yesterday and today just reminded me of how much I miss being nice to myself.  </p>

<p>'I’ve lost weight recently for some reason and I didn’t lose my skin with it so I’ve not been very nice to myself about it which isn’t like me at all. </p>

<p>'Your posts have reminded me that I am beautiful and every BODY is different and that’s what makes them special. You are the only you and that is perfect IMO.  </p>

<p>'Cellulite is pretty, Stretch marks are glitter, extra skin extra so it’s got to be good right? Feel like I’ve got a special offer on skin.'</p>
