<p>Yet the pair still had an incredible day, with Brianne gushing: 'It was amazing. Of course we had Gracie with us, but to also have our baby in my stomach too it to a complete other level. The baby kicked as we said "I do".' </p>

<p>This is the couple's first child together. Although they have yet to learn the sex of their baby, Brianne confirmed their baby is due in February. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kevin has two daughters, 16-year-old Elsie and 14-year-old Isla, with his ex-wife Laura, who he split from in 2011 after 12 years of marriage. </p>

<p>Brianne and Kevin sparked speculation that they wed earlier this month when she took to Instagram to post a photo of themselves clinking champagne glasses . </p>
