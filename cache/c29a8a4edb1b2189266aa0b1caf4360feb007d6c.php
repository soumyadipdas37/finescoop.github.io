<p>They would have to relocate for a work placement of at least six months at 30 hours per week and and there are 500,000 people eligible nationwide. </p>

<p>Suncoast Fresh wholesaler Graeme Twine has estimated his consumers will begin to notice the change in price soon with summer and fruit vegetables to increase in price by 50 to 100 per cent.</p>

<p>'There is stuff in the ground now that will probably be ready for Christmas, so whether they can get it out is up to how many pickers they can get,' he told The Courier Mail.  </p>

<p>Australian consumers will begin to feel the price pinch before the end of the year with a shortage of up to 71,000 workers in the agriculture industry (Empty Woolworths shelves earlier this year)</p>

<p>Growcom CEO Richard Shannon said pushing for Australians to move to farms was the best chance for the industry, but JobSeeker was stopping them from wanting to take up work.</p>
