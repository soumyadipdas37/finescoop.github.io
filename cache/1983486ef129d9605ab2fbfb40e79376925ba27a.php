<p>The reality TV star dated Wes Nelson and Eyal Booker on the ITV show back in 2018 but has since been linked to Chelcee Grimes and TOWIE's Demi Sims.</p>

<p>Discussing her plans for the future, Megan explained how she can 'picture her life with a woman' and may even settle down if she finds the right person.</p>

<p>Megan said: 'After the relationship with the girl [former footballer Chelcee], I was like, "I'm definitely never dating men again".</p>

<p>'I thought, "I only want a woman". It feels like a different dynamic and I felt more myself and more content than I ever had felt with a guy. I can see myself marrying a woman.'</p>

<p>However things haven't always gone smoothly in her relationships and Megan spoke of how one ex boyfriend believed she was using him for sex.</p>

<p>She added: 'I would say I'm a pin-up. I use my sexuality and my looks. I've always used them.'</p>
