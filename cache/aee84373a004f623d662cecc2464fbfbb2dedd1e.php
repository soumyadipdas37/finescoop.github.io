<p>Scobie said that while they did not interview the couple, 'many' friends gave them insights - providing 'a lens to the couple through their friends and their circle of aides'.</p>

<p>The royal commentator gave several high-profile interviews to publicise the book in the week since its release.</p>

<p>But royal expert Katie Nicholl said the authors may be the 'only winners' from the publication of Finding Freedom.</p>

<p>Writing in Vanity Fair, she asked if the book was 'worth it for Harry and Meghan' before adding: 'The irony of Finding Freedom is that, locked down in their rented mansion in LA, the Sussexes have less freedom than they did when they lived in Windsor.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile she added that the book's authors write that the monarchy had lost two of its greatest assets.</p>

<p>She concluded: 'They, perhaps, might be the only winners in this rather sad story.'</p>

<p>The book had reached number one on Amazon's Top 10 New York bestseller in 24 hours list on the day of its release for pre-order.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in July, 14 days before its release, the biography also topped the media giant's bestsellers list as royal fans rushed to pre-order their copy.</p>
