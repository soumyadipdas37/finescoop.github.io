<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ryan Giggs had admitted he cannot wait to see Gareth Bale form part of a 'mouthwatering' front three at Tottenham.</p>

<p>The Wales star sealed a return to Spurs last week on a season-long loan deal from Real Madrid, seven years after leaving north London for the Spanish capital.</p>

<p>Bale is currently recovering from a knee injury that will keep him out until next month, but even without the Welshman, Spurs demolished Southampton thanks to four goals from Son Heung-min, all of which were assisted by Harry Kane before the England striker added a fifth in the 5-2 win. </p>

<p>But Giggs believes Jose Mourinho's side will have another dimension added to it in attack when Bale returns.</p>

<p>'It looks mouthwatering - Kane, Son and Bale. They have so many good players at Tottenham. I am really looking forward to seeing how he does,' Giggs said.</p>

<p>'It's good to have him back in the Premier League. We want to see the best players in the world in the Premier League and it will be interesting to see how he does.'</p>

<p>Wales boss Giggs has continued to pick Bale at international level even when he was being frozen out by Real boss Zinedine Zidane.</p>

<p>Without Bale, Harry Kane (right) and Son Heung-min helped Spurs beat Southampton</p>

<p>And Giggs believes Bale will form part of a formidable attacking trio with Kane and Son</p>

<p>The 31-year-old was captain for the Nations League wins over Finland and Bulgaria earlier this month but looked rusty due an apparent lack of match fitness.</p>

<p>The forward then picked up the knee problem after being on the end of a strong challenge in the second half of the 1-0 victory over the Bulgarians in Cardiff.</p>

<p>Bale however could be a doubt for the friendly against England on October 8 followed by a double-header away to the Republic of Ireland and Bulgaria in the Nations League. </p>

<p>But when asked if he was relieved Bale will see more game time ahead of Euro 2021 next summer, Manchester United legend Giggs replied: 'Yes but not as many trips to Madrid anymore. It will be great. He has Ben Davies there as a team-mate as well.</p>

<p>Giggs admitted he is relieved Bale will see more game time ahead of next summer's Euros</p>

<p>'It's a huge boost when you see someone like that walk through the door.</p>

<p>'They got off to a disappointing start to the season, but to see him fit and firing, he will score goals, he'll make assists, he'll be a massive lift.</p>

<p>'I'm sure the Tottenham fans cannot wait to see him.'</p>
