<p>Breaking the internet: In less than 17 hours, the footage on TikTok already received 5.6 million views and applause from artists, including Meghan Trainor, who commented her performance was 'legendary'</p>

<p>Iconic: Her entire comment section on both Instagram and TikTok was flooded with fans encouraging her to record new music, with many telling her to 'save pop again' and how much they still love Stars Are Blind</p>

<p>Her playful video comes one day after opening up about her past toxic relationships with multiple ex-boyfriends. </p>

<p>'I went through multiple abusive relationships,' Paris told People. 'I was strangled, I was hit, I was grabbed aggressively. I put up with things no one should.'</p>

<p>Paris believes she was set up for a future of abusive relationships while attending the Provo Canyon boarding school as a teenager. </p>

<p>Outfit change: After flipping her hair in front of the camera, the 39-year-old singer appeared in a skintight white minidress, which showcased her slender frame and stunning makeup</p>

<p>Paris claims she endured emotional abuse at the hands of the school during the 11 months she attended, which was intended to focus on her mental and behavioral development.</p>

<p>The socialite alleges she was physically abused and berated by the boarding school.</p>

<p>Eventually, Paris began to normalize the behavior. </p>

<p>Blissful: While she maintained her signature loose waves, the over-the-top business mogul appeared completely in her element, as the song's chorus played in the background</p>

<p>'I had become so used to [abusive behavior] at Provo, that it made me feel like it was normal,' she continued. </p>

<p>Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, whom were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change.</p>

<p>'They all seemed like such nice guys and then the true colors would show,' Paris explained. 'They'd get jealous, or defensive or try to control me. And there there would come a point where they would become physically, verbally and emotionally abusive.' </p>

<p>'I feel so safe with him': The socialite has been dating entrepreneur Carter Reum for nine months</p>

<p>Paris initially interpreted the 'crazy' behavior as an indicator of just how much they loved her. </p>

<p>In 2003, Paris landed at the center of a scandal after her infamous sex tape was leaked to the public.</p>

<p>But Paris believes the tape never would have happened had she not attended Provo. </p>

<p>Soulmates: Hilton said, 'I'm so grateful to have found my perfect match' </p>

<p>'I would never have let anyone into my life like [the man in the tape, whom she was dating at the time]. I met the worst person I could meet and if I hadn't gone to Provo, I wouldn't have entertained the thought of letting him into my life. Provo affected my future relationships. </p>

<p>Nowadays, Paris is in a 'safe' and healthy relationship with entrepreneur Carter Reum, whom she has been dating for nine months.</p>

<p>'I feel so safe with him,' she told the magazine. 'Before, I don't think I was really ready for a good relationship. But I've learned so much. And I'm so grateful to have found my perfect match.'</p>
