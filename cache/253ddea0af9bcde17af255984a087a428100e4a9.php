<p>'I was a little bit down from the break-ups. I forgot who I was. Having two kids is hard work and there's just 15 months between Polly and Ritchie. </p>

<p>'Being a mum is the most rewarding job in the world, but you lose yourself and it becomes all about them.  I don't know if I had depression, but I felt very low at times.'</p>

<p>Amy added that she is very happy with her current beau Tim, who she said has a 'lovely' relationship with her two children. </p>
