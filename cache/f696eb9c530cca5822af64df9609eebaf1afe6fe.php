<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It may not be the short-term solution offered by most diets – but getting married could be one of the best ways to lose weight, research suggests.</p>

<p>Men and women who are carrying extra pounds are more likely to shed them after they get hitched.</p>

<p>Scientists who tracked more than 300 individuals in their 20s found that those who were overweight when they wed dropped to a much healthier size within months of taking the plunge. And most were still slim up to eight years later.</p>

<p>Those who were already trim when they got married stayed that way during their relationship.</p>

<p>But those who were plump and single remained the same size.</p>

<p>Researchers who carried out the study say it suggests that getting married is an incentive to fight the flab and live a healthier lifestyle.</p>

<p>The findings, published in the journal Personal Relationships, fly in the face of the idea that newlyweds tend to pile on the pounds once they settle down.</p>

<p>Previous studies disproved this idea and found marriage is associated with healthy eating and increased physical activity.</p>

<p>However, scientists were unsure whether this was because healthy single individuals were more likely to get married, rather than marriage actually changing behaviour among unhealthy singles.</p>

<p>Researchers said newlyweds tend to have healthier eating habits and benefit from the support of a partner. (Stock image)</p>

<p>To determine whether getting hitched improves a person's health, researchers recruited 302 volunteers in their early 20s and checked their body mass index – which determines if someone is a healthy weight for their height – and relationship status twice a year for eight years. In this period, 38 per cent got married.</p>

<p>Among volunteers who were overweight or obese, getting married reduced the likelihood of them still being this weight eight years later by more than 90 per cent.</p>

<p>The researchers from the University of California, Davis said newlyweds tend to have healthier eating habits and benefit from the support of a partner. </p>

<p>And it's likely that long-term couples who are not married but live together also have the same health benefits.</p>

<p>The researchers concluded: 'Those with an unhealthy BMI are more likely to improve it after marriage – marriage itself appears to benefit wellbeing.'</p>
