<p>The killer was taken to the nearby police station and quickly opened up about his crimes, saying: 'Have you searched the rest of the flat yet? </p>

<p>'You'll find more in the chest in my bedroom and in the turn-up drawer in my bathroom, of all the remains of three people.'</p>

<p>'It's a relief to get this off my chest', Nilsen admitted, before explaining that he doesn't remember the names of his victims and that he would strangle them to death in his bed.</p>

<p>Nilsen's lawyer soon interrupted him to question: 'I have to ask, why did you do this?'</p>

<p>Des, Monday-Wednesday, 9pm, ITV. </p>

<p>Serial killer Dennis Nilsen, a mild-mannered Job centre worker, was arrested on suspicion of murder in 1983 after his drains were found to be blocked with human remains by a DynaRod worker.</p>

<p>After the arrest Nilsen, sometimes known as 'the kindly killer', immediately confessed to as many as 15 murders. </p>

<p>The murderer, who died in prison in 2018, is claimed to have cuddled the corpses of his victims. </p>

<p>The Scottish-born man was a former police officer and trade unionist and was described as intelligent and kind - which is how he lured his victims in.</p>

<p>In 1980s Britain, as unemployment spiralled, there were countless desperate young men living in poverty in London. </p>

<p>He would meet his potential victims in pubs around Soho and north London, introducing himself and saying:'Call me Des,'.</p>

<p>The serial killer would show them kindness before luring them back to his flat – first in Melrose Avenue, Cricklewood, and later in Cranley Gardens before strangling them and keeping them under the floorboards.</p>

<p>While pretending to be helpful to the police, he withheld details of the victims that could have helped their families get justice.</p>

<p>Nilsen had burned and boiled away the evidence but he is believed to have killed between 12 and 20 people - only eight have been identified.  </p>
