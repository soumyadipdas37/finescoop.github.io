<p>Tory allegedly shot her in both feet in the small hours of the morning on July 12 outside a party in the Hollywood Hills.</p>

<p>Megan was attempting to exit the SUV she and Tory were in only for him to reportedly fire his gun, according to TMZ.</p>

<p>In aerial footage that quickly went viral Megan could be seen leaving bloody footprints on the sidewalk and keeping her hands up for the police, whom she has said drove her to the hospital to have her injuries treated.</p>
