<p>A tired-looking Prime Minister had his hands full as he arrived back in Downing Street yesterday ahead of a debate in the Commons</p>

<p>Boris Johnson, 56, was pictured juggling his ministerial red box and folder, Dilyn the dog's lead, and Wilfred's baby bottle as he got out of the car</p>

<p>Although fiance Carrie Symonds was not in shot, it is believed she was not far behind carrying their four-month-old son.</p>

<p>Looking tired in an unbuttoned shirt, Mr Johnson was soon back in Parliament defending his Internal Market Bill, which he claims will stop the EU trying to 'break up our country'.</p>

<p>The controversial piece of Brexit legislation however passed its first reading by 77 votes late last night.</p>

<p>The PM has remained tight-lipped on the issues of fatherhood since the birth of his son almost two months ago.</p>

<p>Although fiance Carrie Symonds was not in shot, it is believed she was not far behind carrying their four-month-old son</p>

<p>But just before Father's Day this year, he revealed that he is being a hands-on dad in Downing Street by regularly changing nappies. </p>

<p>During a visit to Bovingdon Primary Academy in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, on Friday, the Prime Minister told well-wishers how he has been helping his fiancee Carrie Symonds look after their son. </p>

<p>Mr Johnson said Wilfred ‘is in great shape’, adding: ‘I’ve changed a lot of nappies, I want you to know.’</p>

<p>Wilfred was born at the end of April –just weeks after the Prime Minister was in intensive care battling coronavirus. </p>

<p>The PM has remained tight-lipped on the issues of fatherhood since the birth of his son almost two months ago</p>

<p>Boris and fiance Carrie had their first family holiday with Dilyn the dog and baby Wilfred up in northern Scotland during a Parliamentary recess</p>

<p>Mr Johnson is known to have at least six children but he has refused to confirm the number.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister’s remarks about being a hands-on dad come after he appeared flustered when This Morning’s Phillip Schofield asked before the birth whether he planned to change nappies.</p>

<p>After hesitating, Mr Johnson eventually replied: ‘I expect so.’ </p>

<p>He then complained that it was a ‘tricky’ question.</p>
