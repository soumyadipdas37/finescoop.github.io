<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump revealed a new nuclear weapons system to Bob Woodward and bragged that he was telling the author something that America's foreign adversaries had no knowledge of.</p>

<p>In an excerpt of his forthcoming book, 'Rage,' Woodward reveals the president told him about the system and noted neither Russian President Vladimir Putin nor Chinese President Xi Jinping knew about it.</p>

<p>'I have built a nuclear — a weapons system that nobody's ever had in this country before. We have stuff that you haven't even seen or heard about. We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before. There's nobody — what we have is incredible,' Trump said in the excerpt published by The Washington Post.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump revealed a new nuclear weapons system in interviews with Bob Woodward for new book</p>

<p>President Trump bragged neither Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) nor Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) knew about the new nuclear system</p>

<p>Woodward writes that additional sources later confirmed that the system but they did not give details. He also reported that people had expressed surprised Trump had disclosed the system.</p>

<p>Trump gave Woodward his private cell phone number so the two men could talk without aides or other people present. </p>

<p>Woodward's book, Rage, which comes out next week, draws from 18 conversations with Trump between December 2019 and July 2020, that took place in the Oval Office, at Mar-a-Lago and over the phone - occasionally at 9 or 10' o'clock at night. </p>

<p>According to Woodward, sometimes he would get unexpected phone calls after 9pm from the president who was reportedly trying to generate a favorable depiction in the book, unlike in Woodward's 2018 bestseller, Fear.   </p>

<p>President Trump may have been referring to a new submarine-launched nuclear warhead, named the W93. Its existence is known although the details about it are classified</p>

<p>James Acton, co-director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's nuclear policy program, suggested Wednesday that Trump may have been referring  to a new submarine-launched nuclear warhead, named the W93.</p>

<p>Its existence is known although the details about it are classified. </p>

<p>'In 2017, the admin announced a plan to reduce the explosive power of some nuclear warheads on submarine-launched missiles. The timing was kept secret. My guess is that Trump told Woodward about the first deployment before it was made public,' he wrote on Twitter. </p>

<p>'I don't believe that the US could build an actually new nuclear weapon in secret. Too much money for classified budgets. Too many people involved for it not to leak,' he added.</p>

<p>In February there were reports that the Pentagon deployed a new nuclear warhead requested, designed and produced by the Trump administration aboard a nuclear submarine. </p>

<p>Proponents of the weapon wanted the U.S. to have another low-yield nuclear option in order to counter Russia, which has a variety of nuclear systems. </p>

<p>Tape recordings and extracts from the veteran Watergate reporter's forthcoming bok Rage make a series of bombshell revelations.</p>

<p>CORONAVIRUS</p>

<p>Trump told Woodward o February 7 that coronavirus was 'deadly.' </p>

<p>'You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed. And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus. This is deadly stuff,' he said - but did not tell the public what he knew</p>

<p>COVER-UP</p>

<p>On January 28, Robert O'Brien told Trump coronavirus 'will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,' and said: 'This is going to be the roughest thing you face.' Trump then told Americans it was 'under control' and would 'go away.'</p>

<p>And on March 19 Trump said:  'I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.' </p>

<p>NORTH KOREA</p>

<p>Trump says Kim is 'far beyond smart,' and says that the dictator told him 'everything,' boasting about how he described the brutal execution of his uncle in a power struggle. </p>

<p>Woodward reveals Kim Jong-Un's 'love letters' to Trump gushing to 'Your Excellency' about 'holding your hand' and calling their summit 'a fantasy film.'</p>

<p>But Woodward also reveals that when Trump was tweeting about 'Little Rocket Man' Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was so concerned about escalation that he slept in his clothes.</p>

<p>TRUMP ON THE MILITARY</p>

<p>'My f<strong><em>ing generals are a bunch of p</em></strong>ies,' Trump ranted in the Oval Office, and said their backing for NATO and an alliance with South Korea was 'stupid. Costs us $10 billion. We're suckers.'</p>

<p>...AND HIS PREDECESSORS</p>

<p>Trump said Woodward made George W Bush 'look like a stupid moron, which he was.' Of Obama he ranted: 'I don't think Obama's smart ... I think he's highly overrated. And I don't think he's a great speaker.' And he added that Kim Jong-Un called Obama 'an a**hol.'</p>

<p>WHAT AIDES SAID ABOUT HIM</p>

<p>Jim Mattis called him 'dangerous' and 'unfit,' went to pray in Washington National Cathedral, left government because he was 'basically directed to do something that I thought went beyond stupid to felony stupid' in reference to pulling troops from Syria, and suggested 'collective action' after leaving.</p>

<p>Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, had 'deep suspicions' that Putin had something on him and 'could not shake them.'</p>

<p>Dr. Tony Fauci called his leadership 'rudderless,' his attention span 'like a minus number' and said: 'His sole purpose is to get re-elected.'</p>

<p>Jared Kushner - his son-in-law - said Alice In Wonderland is the key to Trump, saying: 'If you don't know where you're going, any path will get you there.'</p>

<p>RACE RELATIONS</p>

<p>Trump described the term 'white privilege' as 'drinking the Kool-Aid' and repeated his claim he had done more for black Americans than Lincoln, adding: 'And, honestly, I’m not feeling any love.'</p>

<p>NUCLEAR SECRETS  </p>

<p>Trump used his private cellphone for late-night calls and revealed he had a 'weapons system' which Putin and Xi did not know about.</p>
