<p>Wedded bliss: Olivia recently celebrated her two-year wedding anniversary with her husband Alex Bowen, 29, with a romantic dinner date </p>

<p>The lovebirds pulled out all the stops to celebrate their anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London during the week.</p>

<p>Their relationship has gone the distance after they first got together before reality TV cameras, and they're one of the rare Love Island couples to have stayed together.</p>

<p>The pair tied the knot in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance.</p>

<p>When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.</p>

<p>'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.</p>

<p>'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.</p>

<p>'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.'</p>

<p>Impressive: Their relationship has gone the distance after they first got together in 2016, and theirs is one of the few Love Island romances that have not fizzled out (pictured on the show)</p>
