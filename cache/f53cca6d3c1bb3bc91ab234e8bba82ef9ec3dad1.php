<p>Neither he nor third wife Sabrina Dhowre have confirmed a pregnancy nor the arrival of a child. </p>

<p>The actor, 48, and the Somali-Canadian model, 30, started dating in 2017 and tied the knot in Marrakesh on April 26 last year. </p>

<p>DailyMail.com has reached out to Elba's representatives for comment. </p>

<p>New parents? Elba hasn't previously spoken publicly about expecting or welcoming another child. The actor, 48, married third wife Sabrina Dhowre in April 2019 (pictured December 2019)</p>

<p>Daddy's girl: Elba also has a daughter Isan, 18, from his first marriage to Hanne 'Kim' Nørgaard, which ended in 2003</p>

<p>In Concrete Cowboy, Elba plays the father of a troubled teen in North Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The two are estranged but the teen, played by Caleb McLaughlin from Stranger Things, is torn between rebelling and pursuing a life of crime and his father's lifestyle as an 'urban cowboy,' who rides horses around the inner city neighborhood.</p>

<p>Elba revealed that he had faced some challenges in portraying his character, revealing at the virtual press conference: 'I'm allergic to horses, OK. I couldn't see what I was doing, I couldn't breathe.'</p>

<p>He added: 'It goes beyond just learning how to ride a horse. Very quickly, you have to have a bond with the horse.... They quickly understand who's riding on the back of them. And then you have to understand them.' </p>

<p>The drama, written and directed by Ricky Staub, is based on the real-life Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club, an inner-city horse stable in Philly that helps at-risk youth turn their lives around, according to THR.com.</p>

<p>The film is produced by Lee Daniels and has its world premiere in Toronto on Sunday night.</p>
