<p>The film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, was originally scheduled for release in April, but was pushed back to November 25 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was then brought forward to November 8 before the most recent change.</p>

<p>In the summer, it was reported that the film's release date was set to change once again, after the COVID-19 crisis led the launch to be delayed by seven months.  </p>

<p>Synopsis: The film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (centre, pictured with Daniel and Lashana Lynch), finds Bond returning to active service to face mysterious villain Safin (Rami Malek)</p>

<p>According to a report from The Sun, it was being considered whether the film's release should be moved yet again over fears of losing money at the box office.</p>

<p>It was claimed that the continued increase in COVID-19 cases in the US meant film executives were concerned about how many people would be able to see it.  </p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'There are secret talks about what to do. Having No Time To Die earning less than half a billion would be deemed a disaster no matter the circumstances.'</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted EON productions for comment at the time.   </p>

<p>The upcoming movie will mark Daniel's last-ever outing as the iconic character, which the actor recently insisted he was 'fine' about.</p>

<p>He told British GQ: 'I'm really... I'm OK. I don't think I would have been if I'd done the last film and that had been it. But this, I'm like... Let's go. Let's get on with it. I'm fine.'</p>

<p>The actor also insisted he isn't too worried about his post-Bond career, as he claimed: 'I'm pretty sure I can play just about anything. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I can, or at least I can make a f**king good fist of it.'</p>
