<p>Baroness Joan Bakewell, 87, has revealed to Times Radio that a junior minister, who has since died, had to be 'fended off' after he made a grab for her early in her career</p>

<p>'I was assaulted by a member of the government in a taxi when I went to fetch him from the House of Commons to come on the programme,' she said.</p>

<p>'You know, this kind of thing happened, it happened all the time.' </p>

<p>Baroness Bakewell was asked whether she reported the minister to police, but she said that there would have been no point.</p>

<p>She added: 'They would've said, well, that's just to do with your private life, you're alright, he's not done anything that breaks the law.' </p>

<p>She said that there was no point in discussing harassment with senior figures at the BBC 'because they would be doing the same thing'.</p>

<p>Baroness Bakewell became known as the presenter of the factual BBC programme Late Night Line-Up and went on to present ethics documentary series, Heart Of The Matter, for 12 years.</p>

<p>The broadcaster (pictured on That Stuart Hall Show), whose career spans more than 50 years, said she was the 'victim of unwelcome attention' in the 1950s and 1960s</p>

<p>She told of how a group of women at the BBC tried to lodge a complaint against a male member of staff who later got promoted 'pretty near the top'.</p>

<p>'There was someone who was persistently harassing a whole department of women as it were, one by one,' she said.</p>

<p>'He would invite them home and behave badly and they began to tell each other.</p>

<p>'They began to share the secret with each other and found it hateful and so they decided that they would all get together and as a group make a protest about this person.</p>

<p>'And they went to the head of department and it eventually went up to, I think as far as the controller, and the person was reprimanded and then he was promoted.' </p>

<p>Although there were 'numbers of predators' within the BBC, Baroness Bakewell said no one knew about Jimmy Savile at the time, but added: 'We all thought he was extremely weird.'</p>

<p>Baroness Bakewell has spoken previously of her support for the Me Too movement, which campaigns against sexual violence, hailing its values and female solidarity.</p>

<p>Baroness Bakewell also told of how a group of women at the BBC tried to lodge a complaint against a male member of staff who later got promoted 'pretty near the top'</p>

<p>In the interview, she also described accepting a peerage from former Labour leader Ed Miliband.</p>

<p>She accepted the honour despite voting for the Green Party at the previous election due to her anger over the Iraq war.</p>

<p>'I marched against the Iraq war with about a million other people,' she said.</p>

<p>'So I wasn't going to vote Labour, didn't support the Labour Party at that time and I had to explain that to Ed Miliband.</p>

<p>'I said "I'd like you to go away and consider whether you want me to be a Labour peer and I have to consider whether I want to be", so we agreed to speak again at which point Ed said "yes I would like you to" and I said "I will accept".'</p>

<p>Baroness Bakewell has sat in the Lords under the title of Labour Life peer since her appointment on January 25, 2011.</p>
