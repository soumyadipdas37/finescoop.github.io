<p>Daisy, daughter of Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale and textiles designer Pearl Lowe, is currently dating home consultant Jordan Saul, just a month after she was linked to musician Christian Langdon.</p>

<p>Christian is the ex-husband of Cat Pierce from The Pierces. The rocker was a member of Arckid in the 1990s and early 2000s. </p>

<p>The brunette's spokesperson previously told MailOnline that her relationship with Christian was platonic after she was spotted with a ring on her engagement finger.</p>

<p>Before that, the former Strictly star had been dating singer Jack Peñate, 35, for six months, but they split in March, with Daisy saying she 'couldn't see a future' with him</p>

<p>The beauty had found romance with Jack after splitting from Cameron McMeikan, 24.</p>

<p>Daisy and Cameron dated for almost a year before reportedly ending their romance over their six-year age gap.</p>
