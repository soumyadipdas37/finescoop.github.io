<p>One of Dominic Cummings' 'weirdos and misfits' was sacked after saying police should use 'live rounds' on Black Lives Matter protesters, it has emerged.</p>

<p>Will O'Shea, 57, who was a data architecture and governance specialist in the Cabinet Office from April, lost his job after the tweet.</p>

<p>Colleagues found and reported the July 5 post and he was booted out of Westminster the same month.</p>

<p>It was the second of Mr Cummings' intake to leave their role after making race-related comments, with Andrew Sabisky having quit Downing Street in February.</p>

<p>Mr O'Shea's tweet came in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in the US when thousands of protesters were also on the streets in the UK.</p>

<p>He had replied to a post about Met police officers being driven out of a London housing estate, saying: 'Time to get out the live rounds.'</p>

<p>The data specialist told a Guardian reporter posing as a recruitment agent he was 'let go because of my tweet'.</p>

<p>It was the second of Mr Cummings' (pictured yesterday) intake to leave their role after making race-related comment</p>

<p>But he later told the journalist over email he was never given a reason for being sacked.</p>

<p>Mr O'Shea said he can see why colleagues at the Government Digital Service in the Cabinet Office found his post racist, incendiary and offensive.</p>

<p>The department was already facing complaints from BAME staff over alleged racism and bullying.</p>

<p>He said he accepted they thought he meant police should be shooting black people in London, but added it was not meant seriously.</p>

<p>Mr O'Shea told the reporter: 'I can see how it was taken that way, and I am sorry for that.' He added: 'I didn't say ''shoot blacks'' and that was not what I meant or wished.'</p>

<p>His Twitter account has since been deleted in a bid to 'get rid of any of the things I had said'.</p>

<p>The aide, who has an MBA from Manchester University and speaks French and German, was among the 'weirdos and misfits' Mr Cummings' called for in January.</p>

<p>The 'unusual set of people' were wanted to work in 'the frontiers of the science of prediction', 'data science, Alternative Intelligence and cognitive technologies' and 'decision-making institutions at the apex of government'.</p>

<p>Mr O'Shea never met the PM's chief adviser, but claimed he was interviewed by data scientist Ben Warner in what has been used as the Covid-19 press conferences room.</p>

<p>A government spokesman told MailOnline: 'Will O'Shea was not hired to work in No 10.</p>

<p>'He was employed by the Cabinet Office as an external contractor for the Government Digital Service on coronavirus.</p>

<p>'All standard vetting processes were carried out for a contractor role through a commercial framework.'</p>

<p>The sacking followed Mr Sabisky's resignation in February after he made comments about forced contraception of the 'underclass' and the IQs of black people.</p>

<p>The sacking followed Mr Sabisky's (pictured) resignation in February after he made comments about forced contraception of the 'underclass' and the IQs of black people</p>

<p>The government adviser suggested black Americans have a lower average IQ than whites and labelled public outcry over female genital mutilation a 'moral panic'.</p>

<p>Mr Sabisky also said 'women's sport is more comparable to the Paralympics than it is to men's' and reportedly advocated legally enforcing the uptake of contraception to stop unplanned pregnancies 'creating a permanent underclass'.</p>

<p>The PM came under growing pressure to sack the 27-year-old, who was apparently drafted in to Number 10 after Mr Cummings called for 'misfits and weirdos'.</p>

<p>Downing Street repeatedly refused to condemn the remarks but Mr Sabisky said he was stepping down due to 'media hysteria' and so as not to be a 'distraction'.</p>

<p>He tweeted: 'Hey all, The media hysteria about my old stuff online is mad but I wanted to help HMG not be a distraction.</p>

<p>'Accordingly I've decided to resign as a contractor. I hope no.10 hires more ppl w/ good geopolitical forecasting track records &amp; that media learn to stop selective quoting.'</p>
