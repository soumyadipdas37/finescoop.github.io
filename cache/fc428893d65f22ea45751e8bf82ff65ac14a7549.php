<p>'Without Towie, Mark and the others wouldn’t be where they are now. Mark is a friend of mine but I think we have to remember where we have come from. The show has achieved so much. It has given us all amazing opportunities and lives.</p>

<p>'It is a shame Mark has chosen not to celebrate and be a part of that. It is the least we can do. Everyone loved Mark. He was known as the King of Essex. He’ll always be a huge part of the show and I’m shocked he’s chosen not to be there.'</p>
