<p>Dishi was arrested after police in Kent were called to reports he had followed a woman and pulled her toward his car.</p>

<p>When officers tried to arrest him he reached into his pocket for a five-inch blade. They stopped Dishi pulling the weapon and he ran off, only to be apprehended by a member of the public.</p>

<p>Dishi had messaged the woman the previous day, threatening to kill her and telling her he had a gun, Canterbury Crown Court heard.</p>

<p>Others on the deportation flight were Armand Gjyriqi, 27, who received an eight-year sentence at St Albans Crown Court for dealing crack cocaine. Another, Andrea Kopo, 24, was convicted of supplying cocaine, possession of criminal property and possession of false identity documents with intent. </p>

<p>Kopo, who entered the UK illegally, was sent down for five years at Bristol Crown Court in December 2018. He was part of a six-strong drugs gang who were found by police to have more than £53,000 in cash and cocaine worth £65,000. </p>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ‘The UK is a safer place without these criminals. The message from these deportations is clear. If you come to this country and abuse our hospitality we will deport you'</p>

<p>Another Albanian who entered this country illegally to become involved in the drugs trade was among those sent to Tirana.</p>

<p>Orgito Asllanaj, 29, was convicted at Exeter Crown Court in May of producing cannabis and was sentenced to 12 months in jail.  </p>

<p>Around 9,200 foreign nationals are in prison in England and Wales, according to latest figures, with Albanians making up the largest group – 11 per cent. </p>

<p>All those deported yesterday were categorised as enforced deportations although some were removed through the Home Office’s early release scheme.</p>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'The UK is a safer place without these criminals. The message from these deportations is clear. If you come to this country and abuse our hospitality we will deport you.'</p>
