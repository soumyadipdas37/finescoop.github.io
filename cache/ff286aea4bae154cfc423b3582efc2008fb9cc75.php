<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New South Wales has recorded just four new COVID-19 cases on Monday, with 7,765 tests conducted across the state.</p>

<p>Three of the new cases are returned travellers in hotel quarantine while the other is a contact of a previously reported case linked to the cluster at the Concord Hospital in Western Sydney.</p>

<p>The dwindling numbers have enticed South Australian Premier Steven Marshall to push to open his state's border with NSW.</p>

<p>'We're hoping that we can get the border open with NSW this week,' Mr Marshall told ABC Radio Adelaide. </p>

<p>The South Australian Government's coronavirus transition committee will meet on Tuesday to discuss NSW residents entering the state without needing to quarantine for two weeks.</p>

<p>Mr Marshall said he was mostly concerned about community transmission rates, after a COVID-positive taxi driver worked for eight days while infectious in Sydney.</p>

<p>A major contact tracing operation is underway after the driver worked for more than a week and visited venues in Sydney and the South Coast.</p>

<p>Mr Marshall said the driver's case was 'slightly worrying'.  </p>

<p>'But [SA's Chief Public Health Officer] Nicola Spurrier and the transition committee will look at that very closely,' he said.</p>

<p>Test numbers in NSW dropped by nearly 6,000 from 13,635 in the previous 24-hour testing period, which is not uncommon for a weekend. </p>

<p>NSW Health would like to see levels above 20,000, particularly in South Western Sydney.</p>

<p>Chief Medical Officer Kerry Chant said NSW was at a critical phase in the response to the pandemic.</p>

<p>'We are trying to identify any undetected chains of transmission in the community to drive it down towards no community transmission,' she said.</p>

<p>'That will put us in the best position ahead of the school holidays where we know people will be out and about travelling across the state.' </p>
