<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 19-year-old student, who threw house party for 50 people that saw him fined £10,000, has apologised after claiming he 'only' invited 25 people but things 'got out of hand'.</p>

<p>The teenage host had become 'hostile' when council community protection officers were called to the house in Harlaxton Drive in Lenton, Nottingham, at around 7pm on Friday. </p>

<p>Police were called a short time later and found around 50 people at the address, which is close to the university, who were all ordered to leave.</p>

<p>Officers claim the young man was given the chance to shut down Friday's party before he was issued with the hefty fine. </p>

<p>He has since apologised for his actions and admitted that things 'got out of hand'.</p>

<p>The fine comes just days before new rules come in force whereby only six people can meet at any one time. </p>

<p>The teenage host had become 'hostile' when council community protection officers were called to the house in Harlaxton Drive in Lenton, Nottingham, (pictured) at around 7pm on Friday</p>

<p>There are currently six students living at the property who did not wish to be identified.</p>

<p>But, speaking after the incident, one said: 'It was meant to be a small gathering with mates and it got out of hand.</p>

<p>'We had invited 25 people and it was out in the garden and aimed to end at 11pm and we were trying to social distance but then people invited their mates and so on.</p>

<p>'It got out of hand and we are really sorry.'</p>

<p>The group did not want to discuss the £10,000 fine.  </p>

<p>Assistant chief constable Steve Cooper from Nottinghamshire Police said officers were prepared to use 'the full weight of the law' to prevent the spread of Covid-19 across the city and county.</p>

<p>He added: 'We need to all remember we are very much still in the middle of a global pandemic and we all need to take responsibility for our actions.</p>

<p>'This party was a clear example of a householder who deliberately flouted the rules without a care for anyone else and as a result we have used the full powers we have to deal with this.</p>

<p>Police were called a short time later and found around 50 people at the address, which is close to the university, who were all ordered to leave (Harlaxton Drive pictured)</p>

<p>'Under current rules we can issue fines to anyone hosting gatherings of more than 30 people which can result in fines of up to £10,000. </p>

<p>'And now we are on the eve of rules becoming even tighter so there can be gatherings of no more than six.' </p>

<p>Amy English, council neighbourhood policing inspector for City Central, added: 'Residents have had fair warning that we won't tolerate people flouting the laws and regulations around the Coronavirus restrictions must be adhered to by everyone.</p>

<p>'In this case the resident also had the chance to shut the party down when they were first visited by our council colleagues.' </p>

<p>Public Health bosses in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire said the highest spike in new cases were among the 18 to 35 year olds and that they could end up exposing the virus to friends, family and some of the most vulnerable members of the community.</p>

<p>Residents in Lenton, who reported the house party to police at around 10.20pm on Friday, described the scene as some partygoers using the excuse to police 'we are just students.'</p>

<p>Letting agent Angela Robins, who has lived in the area for more than 20 years, said: 'I started counting them - it was another four then another three and I lost count at 20.</p>

<p>'It was a stream of people. They were going from the garden to the house. I am glad this fine has happened because they need to be taught a lesson. Explain that to your parents.</p>

<p>'This is needed to set an example. It is also about respecting the neighbourhood not just the lockdown.</p>

<p>'I grew up in this area and it getting worse and worse and when students say 'it's full of students (on this street)' it's rubbish. It does not give you the right to party at all hours.</p>

<p>'There are a lot of residents still here. I think this fine will shake them up.'</p>

<p>Kate Loewenthal, chair of the Lenton Drives and Neighbours Residents' Association, who lives in the area, said locals were not 'anti-student' but want to ensure there is not a Covid-19 spike.</p>

<p>She said: 'I would never wish this £10,000 fine on anyone but there has to be a message that goes out. It is about saving lives.</p>

<p>'A lot of them that did disperse from this party will go on to other parties and it could spread. I was really impressed with the police response last night.</p>

<p>'It started quite early and we saw people from 7pm, which was unusual. There was a few taxis but it was mainly footfall.'</p>

<p>Community Protection Officers from Nottingham City Council initially attended but were met with hostility from the organiser and so police were called to assist.</p>

<p>Officers found around 50 people in the address who were all ordered to leave. The occupant was later issued with the fine.</p>

<p>Police said if he fails to pay or contests this fine he will appear before a court.</p>

<p>ACC Cooper from Nottinghamshire Police said: 'We need to all remember we are very much still in the middle of a global pandemic and we all need to take responsibility for our actions.</p>

<p>'This party was a clear example of a householder who deliberately flouted the rules without a care for anyone else and as a result we have used the full powers we have to deal with this.</p>

<p>'Under current rules we can issue fines to anyone hosting gatherings of more than 30 people which can result in fines of up to £10,000.</p>

<p>'And now we are on the eve of rules becoming even tighter so there can be gatherings of no more than six.</p>

<p>'I want to send out a clear message to anyone who is thinking of deliberately hosting parties tonight or tomorrow night ahead of the rules changing to please not do this.</p>

<p>'As we have demonstrated here we are not afraid to use the full powers we have and we will not tolerate those who are deliberately put other people's lives in danger.' </p>
