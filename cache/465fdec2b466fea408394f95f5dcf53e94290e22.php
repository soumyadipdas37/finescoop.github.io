<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A drug-sniffing dog discovered 24 pounds of cocaine worth some $600,000 as well as $125,000 in cash behind a bathroom vanity in a Bronx apartment, leading to the arrest of three men, according to local and federal authorities.</p>

<p>Balu, the K-9 with the Port Authority Police, was deployed by cops to a two-bedroom apartment at 1500 Popham Avenue in Morris Heights on September 3, according to an indictment which was unsealed by federal authorities on Wednesday.</p>

<p>During the search, the dog led agents to an area near the bathroom sink.</p>

<p>Agents then discovered some 24 pounds of cocaine and cash behind the vanity and medicine cabinet, according to the New York Post.</p>

<p>Investigators said the packages of cocaine were labeled with a Chinese dragon stamp.</p>

<p>Federal, state, and local law enforcement officials said some 12 kilograms of cocaine were recovered from a Bronx apartment on September 3</p>

<p>According to an indictment unsealed on Wednesday, drug traffickers took great pains to conceal the cocaine as well as some $125,000 in cash. The recovered contraband is seen above hidden in dry wall of an apartment in the Bronx</p>

<p>Drug enforcement agents said the wholesale value of the seized cocaine is around $600,000</p>

<p>Prosecutors said the street value of cocaine and other illegal narcotics have spiked due to a decreased supply caused by the travel restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic</p>

<p>The cocaine and cash were discovered by Balu, the drug-sniffing K-9 with the Port Authority Police</p>

<p>Authorities also discovered more than 100 pills and a makeshift pill press.</p>

<p>The drug raid resulted in the arrest and indictment of alleged trafficker Cesar Chavez and two other co-conspirators - his nephew, Cristian Rodriguez Chavez, and Roberto Javier-Batista.</p>

<p>Earlier in the summer, state and federal investigators began surveilling the apartment on Popham Avenue in the Bronx as part of a drug trafficking investigation.</p>

<p>Agents with the US Drug Enforcement Administration and the New York State Police monitored Chavez’s movements, according to the DEA.</p>

<p>On several occasions, Chavez was seen entering and leaving the apartment building with a bag.</p>

<p>On September 3, Chavez was seen leaving the building along with Javier-Batista. Chavez was allegedly carrying a ‘brick-shaped package wrapped in plastic.’</p>

<p>The packages of cocaine were labeled with the symbol of a Chinese dragon (as seen above)</p>

<p>Chavez then got into the driver’s seat of a car and the two men drove off.</p>

<p>A short time later, as state police tried to stop the vehicle, Javier-Batista allegedly got out of the car and fled on foot with the suspicious package.</p>

<p>Chavez, who was still in the driver’s seat, drove off.</p>

<p>Later that same evening, Chavez was seen getting into a car driven by his nephew, Cristian Rodriguez Chavez.</p>

<p>Moments later, Javier-Batista then entered the rear of the same vehicle while carrying a package that looked similar to the brick-shaped item that he was allegedly seen with earlier in the day.</p>

<p>State police stopped the car and saw Javier-Batista allegedly trying to push the package under the driver’s seat.</p>

<p>Investigators recovered the package and had its contents examined in a lab. Authorities said the lab confirmed that the package contained a kilogram of cocaine.</p>

<p>Agents then conducted a search of the apartment, where they say they discovered large quantities of cash as well as 12 kilograms of cocaine.</p>

<p>Investigators said that Chavez went to great lengths to conceal the cocaine because of their inflated value, which is due in large part to the shortage of supplies.</p>

<p>According to the DEA, the $600,000 wholesale value of the seized cocaine is indicative of the highly inflated prices of narcotics during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Travel restrictions put in place by New York City and the state to get the virus under control have also hampered narcotics trafficking, according to the government.</p>

<p>Since the pandemic hit this past spring, wholesale prices for cocaine have skyrocketed by as much as 72 per cent per kilogram.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, one kilogram of cocaine would have cost somewhere between $25,000 and $35,000.</p>

<p>Now, the same quantity of cocaine costs some $48,000.</p>

<p>Federal, state, and local law enforcement arrested three alleged drug traffickers after conducting weeks of surveillance operations outside a two-bedroom apartment at 1500 Popham Avenue in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx (above)</p>

<p>‘As traffickers navigate COVID-impacted drug markets, their drug stashes are more valuable and their concealment methods more necessary, as evident in this investigation,’ said DEA Special Agent in Charge Ray Donovan.</p>

<p>‘I applaud our law enforcement partners on their diligent work and their efforts in safeguarding our nation from the perils of drug use and abuse.’</p>

<p>‘The conduct charged in this case is brazen,’ Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget G. Brennan said.</p>

<p>‘The defendants’ alleged cocaine business flourished as the Bronx and the rest of New York City struggled with devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>‘After evading police, the defendants immediately returned to the scene of the crime, where agents and investigators were waiting.</p>

<p>‘The recovery of $125,000 in cash and cocaine worth more than a half million dollars from an apartment in Morris Heights will put a dent in their high level trafficking operation.' </p>
