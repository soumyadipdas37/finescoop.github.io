<p>Police fear the father-of-two (pictured) - who worked for the LAFD for 20 years - was kidnapped after his property was found ransacked and his motorcycle and jeep gone</p>

<p>Authorities have not told Mr Aguilar's worried daughters what the footage shows.</p>

<p>Adding to concerns, his phone is now turned off, his family say, an action not typical of the devoted father. </p>

<p>Mr Aguilar's family say they have not received a ransom request, but police were left 'concerned' after obtaining obtained Ring camera footage from inside the home on the night he vanished</p>

<p>His daughter Bella told ABC News: We're just so worried sick. Every day is getting harder. Anxiety is getting much worse as the days go on.' </p>

<p>Addressing her father, his other daughter Amaris said: 'I will go to the ends of the earth for you. And I can't wait until you get back so we can give you a big hug.'</p>

<p>Addressing the press shortly after 5pm, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said: 'We will work tirelessly to make sure that Frank is returned safely. </p>

<p>'That this is somebody who has put his life on the line for us.'</p>

<p>He added:  'And if this message gets to anybody who would dare kidnap an Angelino who serves the people of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>'Let him go and make sure that he is able to safely return to our city and to his family.'</p>

<p>His daughter Bella (pictured) said: We're just so worried sick. Every day is getting harder. Anxiety is getting much worse as the days go on'</p>

<p>Mexican authorities are leading the investigation into his disappearance with help from the FBI. </p>

<p>Homicides are a common concern for visitors travelling to Rosarito and its surrounding locations after drug cartels caused a spike in killings between 2007 and 2010.</p>

<p>Since that point, murder rates have dropped but are still higher in this region than the rest of the county. </p>

<p>Tourists are not usually the targets of drug-related crimes.</p>
