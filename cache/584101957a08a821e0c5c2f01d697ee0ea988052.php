<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Frank Lampard lamented Chelsea's lapse in concentration at the back that led to Tottenham's equaliser after his side crashed out of the Carabao Cup.</p>

<p>Timo Werner had put Chelsea ahead with his first goal for the club in the 19th minute but Tottenham equalised with seven minutes remaining through Erik Lamela, after a mix-up at the back between Kurt Zouma and Fikayo Tomori.</p>

<p>Spurs then triumphed on penalties after the two London rivals couldn't be separated in normal-time, and following the defeat on Tuesday, Lampard demanded his side stay switched on defensively for the full 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard's Chelsea side crashed out of Carabao Cup against London rivals Tottenham</p>

<p>'It was frustrating, the thing we work on is defending our box. We did it very well at Brighton and against Liverpool for most of the game,' Lampard told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'You sleep for one minute and don't recover and defend a zone where players score goals then you are going to concede. Players have to get better at that.'</p>

<p>Lamela crept in at the far post to equalise after both Zouma and Tomori failed to clear the danger following a cross from Tottenham new boy Sergio Reguilon down the left. </p>

<p>But despite Chelsea's exit, Lampard was keen to take the positives about his side's performance in north London. </p>

<p>'We wanted to stay in the competition but there were some really good bits in the performance. With the control we had we want to score more goals.</p>

<p>'We can do better in terms of our reaction. Can we be more positive? I think that's going to come. We were looking tired towards the end of the game and that's understandable considering where we are.' </p>

<p>It has been a tough couple of weeks for Lampard after losing to Liverpool and Tottenham while drawing away at West Brom.</p>

<p>And Lampard will be desperate for his Chelsea players to bounce back immediately as they prepare for this weekend's Premier League action.</p>
