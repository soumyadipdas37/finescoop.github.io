<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She's been living it up in the sunshine for much of the late summer, after jetting off for a post-lockdown break in Ibiza.</p>

<p>And Demi Rose showed off some more of the eye-catching swimwear packed into her suitcase on Tuesday, when she took to Instagram to share sizzling bikini snaps.</p>

<p>Sizzling: Demi Rose showed off some more of the eye-catching swimwear packed into her suitcase on Tuesday, when she took to Instagram to share sizzling bikini snaps in Ibiza</p>

<p>The curvaceous beauty complemented her barely-there ensemble with a pair of puffy chiffon sleeve attachments, while she accessorised with a long gold crucifix.</p>

<p>Wearing her raven locks in a French plait, the West Midlands native attached a string of black feathers to her hair, while she highlighted her good looks with bold makeup.</p>

<p>Captioning the selection of images, which showed the social media sensation posing to proudly display her voluptuous frame, she wrote: 'You have my attention.' </p>

<p>Sensational: The 24-year-old model wowed as she posed up a storm in a skimpy white strapless top, which she teamed with a pair of black thong bottoms</p>

<p>All in the details: The curvaceous beauty complemented her barely-there ensemble with a pair of puffy chiffon sleeve attachments, while she accessorised with a long gold crucifix</p>

<p>While things might seem perfect, her Twitter account told different tale and Demi lamented that she has been marked after being stung by a jellyfish.</p>

<p>She penned that she was disappointed that she couldn't enjoy a peaceful swim without jellyfish surrounding her. </p>

<p>'It was my first time getting stung a week ago and I'm just like ffs these marks need to go... Basically I don’t like Jellyfish' she wrote. </p>

<p>Demi added: 'It’s Jelly season over here in ibiza and it’s just impossible to swim without getting stung'.</p>

<p>Stunning: A day earlier, she showed off her incredible curves in a black thong swimsuit on Instagram as she lamented being stung by a jellyfish</p>

<p>The thong song: Demi captioned the images with the words: 'todo perfecto' which means 'everything is perfect' in Spanish</p>

<p>Despite the prospect of two weeks behind closed doors upon her return to the UK - the result of tightening travel restrictions in the fight against COVID-19 - Demi still seems to be smiling.</p>

<p>Spain had been among of a number of 'air-bridge' countries considered to be safe for quarantine-free travel, promoting many stars to book getaways, but a spike in coronavirus cases across the country has prompted a change in policy.</p>

<p>Before her trip to Ibiza, the Birmingham native had been isolating in her London flat after the novel coronavirus pandemic scuppered her travel plans for March - much to her displeasure.</p>

<p>Taking to social media at the time, the brunette lamented: 'All I have with me is crochet stuff and bikinis. I'm sick of wearing all the other stuff that I bought that is loungey.'</p>

<p>Woah mama! Demi was one again keen to put her best assets on display as she posed up a storm for a sizzling snap on Sunday</p>

<p>Not happy: Demi had some things to say about the jellyfish that stung her </p>
