<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United 'have no plans to sign a centre-back during the current transfer window' despite their defensive horror show against Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Their first-choice central defensive pairing of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof looked vulnerable to Palace's pace during Saturday's 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>With other options in that department including Eric Bailly, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Axel Tuanzebe and Teden Mengi, United did not feel it necessary to prioritise another centre-back this summer.</p>

<p>Manchester United 'will not buy another centre-half' during the current transfer window despite Harry Maguire and co struggling in the defeat to Crystal Palace</p>

<p>Victor Lindelof struggled against Palace's pace on Saturday but there are reportedly no plans to sign anyone else in central defence before the window closes on October 5</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer watches on as his United side lose their Premier League opener</p>

<p>And, according to The Athletic, those plans haven't changed despite Palace exposing a significant weakness in that area.</p>

<p>That's despite United reportedly being offered players who could potentially reinforce their defence.</p>

<p>Instead, United have concentrated on recruiting another midfielder, with Donny van de Beek arriving from Ajax for £35million, and a right-sided attacker.</p>

<p>However, negotiations over Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho have stalled with the clubs still in disagreement over the England star's £108m valuation.</p>

<p>Talks with Borussia Dortmund over signing Sancho have reached an impasse over the fee</p>

<p>Pressure is mounting on Ed Woodward to spend and bring in new signings in the next fortnight</p>

<p>Chris Smalling, who spent last season on loan at Roma, is back in United's squad</p>

<p>Saturday's abysmal performance has heaped pressure on executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to invest heavily again to make Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team competitive despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>But it appears any further spending before the window closes on October 5 will be in other areas of the pitch and not the centre of defence.</p>

<p>However, it's possible a new left-back may arrive with United holding talks for Porto's Alex Telles, who would offer competition to Luke Shaw.</p>
