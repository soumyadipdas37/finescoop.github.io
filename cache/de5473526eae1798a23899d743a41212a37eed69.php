<p>Almost a third of Spain's new cases of Covid-19 have been reported in Madrid. </p>

<p>France saw a record daily peak of 8,975 more infections and while the country is determined not to return to a second lockdown, international travel has been restricted which affects Parris and Taylor in particular. </p>
