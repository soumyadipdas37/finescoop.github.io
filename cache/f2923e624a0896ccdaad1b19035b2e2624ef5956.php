<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Tennessee woman has slammed her gym for promoting sexism and double standards after they told her to cover up the 'three inches' of waist she had exposed while exercising.</p>

<p>Julia Maren, who is a member at Anytime Fitness Spring Hill, shared a furious Instagram post on September 8 after gym staff took issue with her sports bra, telling her she would need to put on a shirt to continue her workout.</p>

<p>She went on to complain that men at the gym were exposing much more than she was, decrying the unfairness of women being judged and criticized for what they wear to the gym.  </p>

<p>Called out: Julia Maren, who is a member at Anytime Fitness Spring Hill in Tennessee, went on an Instagram rant about her gym</p>

<p>Cover up: She said gym staff took issue with her sports bra, telling her she would need to put on a shirt to continue her workout</p>

<p>'Today I was told I’d have to leave the gym if I didn’t put a shirt on, with no explanation,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'My workout was interrupted and I was told to take out my headphones for someone to tell me they could “get me a shirt if I need one” and that if I wanted to continue my workout I had to put one on.... WHAT?! </p>

<p>'So you’re telling me that because three inches of my waist is exposed that I’m not welcome in the gym but meanwhile f***ing Chad is over there with a cutout that shows his whole nipple? Got it. </p>

<p>'Thank you for taking time out of your day to let me know that double standards and sexism still exists.'</p>

<p>Not only did she take issue with what appeared to be a different set of rules for men and women, but she was also upset the responsibility for male thoughts falling on female shoulders. </p>

<p>'If the problem is that I will be a distraction, why isn’t the accountability on the one who is distracted?' she asked. </p>

<p>She wrote: 'You’re telling me that because three inches of my waist is exposed that I’m not welcome in the gym but ... Chad is over there with a cutout that shows his whole nipple?'</p>

<p>'Thank you for taking time out of your day to let me know that double standards and sexism still exists,' she wrote</p>

<p>'This is a deep rooted issue because I could EASILY talk about middle school uniform policies, prom dress codes, and evidently gym attire. When will we stop policing women’s bodies and HOLD THE OTHERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR SEXUALIZING THEM.   </p>

<p>'And WHEN will we start ALLOWING women to feel comfortable enough in the gym to wear whatever the f*** is comfortable to them in an otherwise already uncomfortable environment?!</p>

<p>'All I’m saying is that I’m showing up in a bro tank with my nipple out next time,' she added.</p>

<p>She also cited a survey by Fitness Magazine that found that 65 per cent of women avoid the gym over fear of being judged, compared to 36 per cent of men.</p>

<p>'Do you realize what this statistic suggests? That women are automatically more cautious about what they wear to the gym to avoid criticisms and negative comments,' she said.</p>

<p>In a series of followup videos, Julia said that 'a dress code for a gym, no matter what, I think is absolutely ridiculous.'</p>

<p>'If the problem is that I will be a distraction, why isn’t the accountability on the one who is distracted?' she asked</p>

<p>'If you're gonna have a dress code, it should be stated in the contract and not just randomly be told to you one day,' she said in a followup video</p>

<p>In agreement: Julia has received plenty of support on Instagram</p>

<p>'We're all there to better ourselves mentally or physically, or for whatever f***ing reason, it doesn't actually matter. If you're in a gym, you're probably bettering yourself.</p>

<p>'So we should all be comfortable. This includes men, too. I have not personally seen, ever, a man be asked to leave a gym because of what he was wearing. Obviously I've experienced this myself, though.</p>

<p>'Also,' she said, 'if you're gonna have a dress code, it should be stated in the contract and not just randomly be told to you one day.'</p>

<p>Julia has received plenty of support on Instagram.</p>

<p>'Absolutely agree with you; this issue does put women off training in the gym and staying healthy, which is such a shame,' wrote one. 'I think it's ridiculous that they called you out for this outfit; absolutely senseless and it looks completely appropriate to me.'</p>

<p>'I thought this is normal gym attire? Not all girls where t-shirts, crop tops and other things like that seem fine to me.' said another.</p>

<p>'That is infuriating!! I’m so mad for you girl, and mad that we have of deal with this sexism,' wrote a third. </p>
