<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thiago Alcantara has reportedly agreed personal terms with Liverpool and the Bayern Munich midfielder is currently spending time on holiday in Barcelona.</p>

<p>The Spain international's wife posted a photo of a relaxed looking Thiago with her and their children captioned: 'The four of us,' after he was given an extended break by the Bundesliga giants following the Nations League fixtures. </p>

<p>The Spaniard is reportedly desperate to seal a move to Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool and BILD maintain that terms have been agreed between the two parties.  </p>

<p>Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara has reportedly agreed terms with Liverpool</p>

<p>The Spaniard is currently on an extended holiday with his wife and children in Barcelona</p>

<p>The report however states that the club agreeing a transfer fee remains a stumbling block, with last season's treble winners reticent to let him depart for anything less than £27.5million (€30m).</p>

<p>The German outlet also claims Thiago is not expected to report for Bayern Munich training until next week, with the 29-year-old keen to resolve his future as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Thiago's Bayern Munich colleagues were back in training on Tuesday, including both Niklas Sule and new signing Leroy Sane who had featured for Germany in the past week.</p>

<p>But the Spain international is reportedly desperate to link up with Jurgen Klopp's men </p>

<p>But Spain international Thiago will not be joining them this week after being pictured having a relaxing time on a beach in Barcelona. </p>

<p>Bayern boss Hansi Flick offered very little update on the former Barcelona playmaker's future, adding that he remains in his plans as long as he is part of his squad.</p>

<p>As stated by Sportsmail, Thiago's future could hinge on the future of Georginio Wijnaldum, who is set for talks with Klopp upon his return.</p>

<p>Should Barcelona give Liverpool the chance to cash in on Wijnaldum, it would pave the way for Liverpool to move for Thiago.</p>

<p>A move for Thiago could hinge on the future of current Reds midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum</p>
