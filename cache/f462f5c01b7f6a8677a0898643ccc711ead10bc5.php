<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United may have to settle for a loan deal for Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguilon despite submitting a £27million bid for him.</p>

<p>The defender, who impressed on loan at Sevilla last season, has emerged as a top target for United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as he searches for left-sided reinforcements.</p>

<p>Reguilon's future at the Bernabeu seems bleak and it is believed he is free to leave this summer, sitting behind Ferland Mendy and Marcelo in Zinedine Zidane's side.</p>

<p>Man United may have to settle for a season-long loan for Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguilon</p>

<p>United submitted a £27m bid for the Spaniard but Madrid chiefs are big fans of the 23-year-old</p>

<p>The left-back has turned heads after taking LaLiga and the Europa League by storm with Sevilla as Tottenham, Paris Saint-Germain, Napoli and Juventus have all registered an interest.</p>

<p>However, United are the only club to have made a bid for Reguilon, totalling £27million. </p>

<p>They could be dealt a slight blow in their pursuit of the 23-year-old and may only be able to loan him for a season initially.</p>

<p>He is under contract with Los Blancos until 2023 and the Bernabeu chiefs highly-rate him after he rose through the club's academy ranks.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old had impressed during a season-long loan with LaLiga side Sevilla last season</p>

<p>Despite Zidane being happy to allow Reguilon to leave permanently in order to create funds for more summer reinforcements, it is more likely that Madrid will only allow the left-back to leave on loan, according to Sport. </p>

<p>Solskjaer is hoping to create some momentum from the recent signing of Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek and strengthen his defensive options.</p>

<p>Last season the left-back spot was occupied by Luke Shaw - who was withdrawn from their Europa League campaign due to an ankle injury - and 20-year-old academy product, Brandon Williams. </p>
