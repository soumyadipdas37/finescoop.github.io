<p>Last week the IMG model fired back at baseless body shamers who have been openly criticizing the weight she has gained since giving birth to her daughters.</p>

<p>In the video, April looked noticeably makeup-free and had her golden hair parted to one side.</p>

<p>Although she did not provide specific examples of the body shaming she has been receiving online, Geary made clear with her tone that the frequency of such comments is high.</p>

<p>Keyboard warriors eagerly took to April's comment section to criticize the inappropriate nature of the picture and condemned her for setting a 'bad' example for her two daughters.</p>

<p>'They have girls no less. Sad thing is that she actually believes this is EMPOWERING. Quite the opposite. What this SCREAMS is 'I'm INSECURE!' Secure is when you don't have to prove it in PUBLIC,' wrote one especially irate commenter.</p>

<p>To which April replied: 'no this picture screams 'I'm in lingerie standing next to my fiancé.'  </p>

<p>In a recent interview with ET, Robin opened up about life in lockdown with his fiancee and their two daughters.</p>

<p>'I will never regret getting extra time with my kids. I am making the most of it,' the Blurred Lines singer said.</p>

<p>By strictly quarantining at their Malibu home, April has had plenty of time to snap and share photos of her family with her 173,000 followers on Instagram. </p>
