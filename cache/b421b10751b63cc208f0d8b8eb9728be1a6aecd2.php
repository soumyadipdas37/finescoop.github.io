<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham were staring into the abyss with 19 minutes to go before Harry Kane and Tanguy Ndombele spared Jose Mourinho's blushes to reach the third qualifying round of the Europa League. </p>

<p>While viewers at home were left with no way to follow the game as the television pictures from Bulgaria cut out, fans faced an anxious wait after news filtered through that Georgi Minchev had given unfancied Lokomotiv Plovdiv the lead.</p>

<p>Immediately Mourinho reacted, taking Davinson Sanchez off and putting Lucas Moura on, but in the end it was Plovdiv who came to the rescue as two red cards sent them down to nine men.</p>

<p>Kane got the equaliser from the penalty spot for his first goal of the 2020-21 season before Ndombele, who has been much maligned since joining last season as the club's record buy, played the role of the hero in Bulgaria.  </p>

<p>More to follow.      </p>

<p>Harry Kane stepped up with a captain's contribution as Tottenham beat Lokomotiv Plovdiv</p>

<p>It was far from straightforward and Tanguy Ndombele (right) came off the bench to seal it</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho cut an animated figure on the touchline as his side surprisingly fell behind</p>

<p>Georgi Minchev was on hand to score the opening goal of the game to stun Tottenham</p>

<p>The Bulgarian side were 20 minutes away from knocking Tottenham out on Thursday night</p>

<p>Tottenham's miserable night looked set to continue before a dramatic late intervention</p>

<p>Mourinho's side threw everything they had into attack and they soon breached the defence</p>

<p>Lokomotiv Plovdiv lost their discipline and Dinis Almeida became the second man sent off</p>

<p>Kane made no mistake on his penalty and the momentum was all with Tottenham from then on</p>

<p>A brilliant firework display was the backdrop for this Europa League second round qualifier</p>
