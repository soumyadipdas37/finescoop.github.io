<p>Glen Coroner, otherwise known as DJ Spiral, was filmed being evicted from the store following a heated exchange with staff.</p>

<p>The incident, which is thought to have taken place in Dublin, was shared on Twitter on Saturday, September 12, where it quickly went viral.</p>

<p>Coroner, who currently owns an events business, appeared on reality TV show Big Brother in 2006.</p>

<p>As the video begins, he is seen arguing with a man thought to be a Lidl employee, who grabs his basket and asks him to leave the store. </p>

<p>Big Brother contestant Glen Coroner - otherwise known as DJ Spiral (right) - was captured in a viral video being evicted from a Lidl, believed to be in Dublin, for not wearing a face mask</p>

<p>Coroner, who currently owns an events business, appeared on reality TV show Big Brother in 2006. He was evicted on day 72 after being voted out by his fellow housemates</p>

<p>Glen, from Dublin says: 'Excuse me, let go of that.'</p>

<p>The man replies: 'We are not serving you, excuse me please I am asking you to leave the store.'</p>

<p>Glen then responds: 'What do you mean, why? I have a constitutional right, what are you doing?'</p>

<p>A woman recording says: 'You are going online just letting you know.'</p>

<p>The man asks Glen to leave the store one further time as he responds: 'No, I am not leaving the store.'</p>

<p>Glen adds: 'I am not leaving the store, I know my constitutional rights, ring the police.'</p>

<p>A man, presumed to be a Lidl employee, was seen telling the Big Brother contestant to leave the store. The man in a headset stopped Coroner from trying to pay as he wasn't wearing a face mask, telling him to leave the supermarket</p>

<p>The man walks towards the front of the store with Glen and the woman recording behind him.</p>

<p>Shoppers then threaten to call the Garda as Glen's shopping is taken away from him.</p>

<p>Glen calls out: 'Are you not letting me get my milk?'</p>

<p>The man promptly responds: 'No' as he walks out of sight, Glen looks to the camera and says: 'Keep recording this.'</p>

<p>The man believed to be the Lidl employee says: 'I am asking you nicely to leave the store and keep your distance.'</p>

<p>Glen responds: 'You are the one that is on top of me, please move out my way, I want to get my milk.'</p>

<p>The man takes Coroner to the front of the store, and continues to ask him to leave. Shoppers then threaten to call the Garda</p>

<p>The clip finishes with police outside a Lidl store with Glen saying off camera: 'This is what I don't understand you try and explain this to them, do you know what I mean?'</p>

<p>The video was shared on Twitter by user <?php echo e('@'); ?>ActingTheGom, who said: '100% behind <?php echo e('@'); ?>lidl-ireland for ejecting these clowns, spouting on about constitutional rights when they can barely operate a shopping trolley.'</p>

<p>'Seemingly the male is something called a DJ Spiral and was on Big Brother.'</p>

<p>The post has since clocked up 9,000 likes and drawn strong support for the store.</p>
