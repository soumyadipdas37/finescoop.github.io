<p>Great time: Elle Fanning already has an impressive career at age 22 with hits such as Mary Shelley, Maleficent and The Beguiled. And now the sister of Dakota Fanning has landed on the October cover of Vanity Fair to discuss her Hulu series The Great in which she plays Catherine</p>

<p>Her costar is Nicholas Hoult of X-Men and Mad Max fame. He plays Catherine’s husband, Peter III.</p>

<p>Also during her interview the blonde beauty also revealed she is a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, likes to watch 90 Day Fiance and can mimic Addison Rae's Tik Tok dances fairly well.</p>

<p>Great role: In The Great she plays a royal woman living in rural Russia during the 18th century is forced to choose between her own personal happiness and the future of Russia, when she marries an Emperor</p>

<p>The star has been staying with her 26-year-old sister Dakota; their mother; their grandmother; and the family's schnauzer-poodle Lewellen at her mother's home in the San Fernando Valley in LA county. </p>

<p>She told the magazine she is using her downtime from work during lockdown to 'get creative and use different parts of my brain.'</p>

<p>The star has been photographing 'little objects around the house,' and doing Addison Rae's dances on TikTok.</p>

<p>'I'll probably never post them, but I'm not bad,' said the star. </p>

<p>A new frontier: The star talked about how liberating it is to play Catherine. 'The real Catherine the Great was very free sexually and people put her down for that,' Fanning shared</p>

<p>Intimate: Elle added, 'Sex is a big part of this show, and I was excited to explore that side of the work. Personally, I love being naked. I walk around naked, like, all the time. It’s a part of life!'</p>

<p>She does it for the show: In some scenes the actress appears without clothing on</p>

<p>And the family loves to get together for 'junk' reality TV like 90 Day Fiance.</p>

<p>As far as her career she says she is not 'apologizing' for her success.</p>

<p>'Yes, I am young, but I've been in this business for a long time, and my opinion matters,' said Elle.</p>

<p>Her athlete parents - mom was a tennis pro and dad played baseball - have taught her discipline.</p>

<p>'Because of them, I have a very athletic approach to acting. Like, I think you have to condition yourself to be ready so you can give it your all—get food in your stomach, sleep a certain amount.'</p>

<p>Elle Fanning, who, despite her age, already has 36 roles under her belt, just triumphed in her first truly adult role in #TheGreat—and now, the actress is stepping into her own power: “Why am I apologizing?” she asks in her October V.F. cover story. “Yes, I am young, but I’ve been in this business for a long time, and my opinion matters.” Read the full story at the link in bio.

<p>And she was shown how to be polite: 'We have very Southern values, like manners and respect for elders,' Elle said. </p>

<p>Her mother on let her stay alone on set when she did Beguiled.</p>

<p>'I was 18 and my mom didn’t have to be on the set with me anymore, which was kind of a big moment for me,' she said. 'My mom knew Sofia from when I did Somewhere, and [The Beguiled costar] Kirsten Dunst is a friend of ours, so she was like, Okay, I feel safe that you’re on your own with people that I know.' </p>

<p>And she became close to Kirsten Dunst. 'Kirsten and I would have slumber parties. It was the first time I wasn’t the youngest person on set, because there were girls younger than me in the film who had their moms there, and had to go off and do math homework when they wanted to hang out with everybody, just like I used to have to do.'</p>

<p>Michelle Pfeiffer talked about hanging out with Elle on the set of I Am Sam which starred Dakota. </p>

<p>'There were long hours, and I would imagine most children that age would get bored and get a little bit resentful and act up, but Elle was so comfortable on the set,' she stated. </p>

<p>Eclectic taste: The movie and TV star is a fan of 90 Day Fiance (Larissa Dos Santos Lima seen at left) and Addison Rae (right) whose Tik Tok dance moves she has mastered</p>

<p>'When we had downtime, she and Dakota and I would play Barbies. They were just doing what little girls do, and having fun. And Elle had this inherent joy about her as a child that just emanated from her. I hadn’t seen her since then, until we did [the Maleficent sequel] together, and I was so surprised to see that it was still there. That light had not dimmed one bit.'</p>

<p>'Elle is just very present,' says the director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who worked with the actress on Babel.</p>

<p>'She's not like the classic nervous, bullsh**ting, constantly looking around, "Who is looking at me" type of person.</p>

<p>'When she laughs, she really laughs. You know? When she is listening, she's really listening. Most people pretend that they're listening to you.' </p>

<p>She has star fans: Michelle Pfeiffer talked about hanging out with Elle on the set of I Am Sam which starred Dakota. 'There were long hours, and I would imagine most children that age would get bored and get a little bit resentful and act up, but Elle was so comfortable on the set,' she stated. Seen in 2019</p>

<p>Nicole Kidman also talked to VF on behalf of Elle. 'She’s so versatile, she can really do anything. I think she should do plays next. Wouldn’t she be amazing? I tell her that all the time.' </p>

<p>Elle started working at age two. 'I have a memory of doing a Smucker’s Uncrustables commercial,' she said. 'They loved me on the set because I would eat them and eat them when all the other kids would spit the sandwich out. They were like, This kid’s great!'</p>

<p>Fanning is happiest when she is at ease: 'I can sit and just think for hours. My mind can go to endless odd worlds and weird places.'</p>

<p>She smiles. 'I think it tells me that I’m in the right profession, because acting is so much about the imagination. For me, it’s the key ingredient, because it’s just hard to describe”—air quotes here—“your ‘process."'</p>
