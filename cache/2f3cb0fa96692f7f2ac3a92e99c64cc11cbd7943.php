<p>'The sun is shining, the birds are chirping... and the spiders are making me wanna burn the house down,' he wrote.</p>

<p>Terrifying footage shows an enormous huntsman spider charging towards a man as he sits on the toilet</p>

<p>Western Australian man Riley Watts filmed the moment he jumps in fear as the spider runs towards him</p>

<p>The video shows the spider on the wall opposite Mr Watts before jumping onto the floor towards him and running up another wall.</p>

<p>'F<strong>k, f</strong>k, f<strong>k, I'm trying to s</strong>t, man! Jesus f**king christ,' Mr Watts can be heard screaming in the video. </p>

<p>The video has quickly gained thousands of views and hundreds of comments from people equally in disgust.</p>

<p>'It's at that point wiping becomes irrelevant,' one user wrote.</p>

<p>'Omg no it makes noise when it walks!' another commented. </p>

<p>Mr Watts posted the video just days after sharing horrific footage of another enormous spider eating a whole gecko.</p>

<p>The giant huntsman can be seen casually chomping on the reptile while sitting on the outside wall of Mr Watts' house.</p>

<p>TikTok users commented on the spider's size and confidence, and told the man filming to 'burn the house down'.</p>

<p>The shocking discovery, uploaded onto TikTok earlier this month, shows the spider chomping on a gecko at what looks to be the back veranda of a Western Australian house (pictured)</p>

<p>'Coulda gone my entire life without seeing this,' one commented.</p>

<p>'I saw a spider eat a bird when I lived on the Gold Coast,' another wrote.</p>

<p>Others said large, hairy spiders were the reason why they 'would never visit Australia.'</p>

<p>'This is how the fires started in Australia,' one said.</p>

<p>'It's time to move,' another commented.</p>

<p>'Where in Australia is this? Just so I know not to move there.'</p>

<p>Spider expert Dr Lizzie Lowe, from Macquarie University's Department of Biological Sciences, told Daily Mail Australia the spider in the video was a grey huntsman.</p>

<p>She said the sight was not unusual but a surprise as lizards were harder for arachnids to digest.</p>

<p>She said the sight was not unusual but a surprise as lizards were harder for a 'helping house guest' to digest. Pictured: The huntsman spider eating a lizard at a Western Australia home </p>

<p>'They usually love eating cockroaches because when you think of it cockroaches are mush inside and they're easy for them to digest, whereas lizards are more complex with bones and harder to get,' Dr Lowe said.</p>

<p>She added the spider probably caught the lizard due to its poor eye sight.</p>

<p>'A fun fact about huntsmans is they have terrible vision and can only see light, dark and movement,' Dr Lowe said.</p>

<p>'That's why it probably caught the lizard. It would've caught it without realising.</p>

<p>'They don't have a web to catch prey on - they see movement and run at it, do a quick little bite and inject venom.</p>

<p>'The prey then slows down and it sits there and digests it.'  </p>
