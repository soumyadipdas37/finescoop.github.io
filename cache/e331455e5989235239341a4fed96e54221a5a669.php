<p>A photo of an RSVP card to an anonymous couple's wedding has gone viral after it was shared on Reddit's popular 'wedding shaming' thread. </p>

<p>The cards were branded 'tacky' and 'offensive' after guests were asked to select one of four 'gift levels' they planned to give to the newlyweds that would in turn determine their dinner choice at the reception. </p>

<p>Those who chose to give a 'loving gift' - the lowest tier - of up to $250, could choose between roast chicken or swordfish.</p>

<p>A bride's RSVP card to her wedding has gone viral after she offered her guests better meals depending on the size of their cash gifts</p>

<p>The photo sparked outrage on social media with users slamming the menu as 'tacky' and 'gross' </p>

<p>Users also took issue with the options for vegetarian and kosher guests, who are required to select the most expensive tier gift</p>

<p>The 'silver gift' level, which ranges from $251 to $500, offered guests either sliced steak or poached salmon, in addition to the options from lower tiers. </p>

<p>Under the 'golden gift' selection, guests had the option of filet mignon or lobster tails provided they shell out $501 to $1,000. </p>

<p>And finally, the more generous guests willing to spend between $1,001 and $2,500 on the 'platinum gift', are offered a 2lb lobster as well as a souvenir champagne goblet. </p>

<p>As for vegetarians or Kosher guests, their dietary restrictions come with a price as their meals are only available at the 'platinum level', according to the menu.  </p>

<p>The invitation was widely slammed on Reddit and Twitter, with many calling the tiered menu 'gross' and 'rude.' </p>

<p>One person said he'd bring a $25 and his own tuna sandwich instead of participating in the expensive scheme</p>

<p>'I'm not sure "tacky" covers both the offensiveness of treating your wedding guests like political campaign donors and the pathology of using your marriage as emotionally blackmail your loved ones AND publicly shame them. It's like a sociopathy burrito,' one person tweeted in response.  </p>

<p>Others suggested alternatives for guests to get around the expensive tiered gift system. </p>

<p>'Everybody should just say their gift was over $1k, eat the 2lb of lobster, and laugh thinking about the couple opening their $40 toaster later,' one user quipped. </p>

<p>Another joked about bringing a '$25 check and a tuna sub' instead of opting for the reception meal.  </p>

<p>'Sign up for the platinum level. Get you some lobster. Bring a card with a $5 TJ Maxx gift card an the business cards of local divorce lawyers. Enjoy your lobster and leave. Win win.' </p>
