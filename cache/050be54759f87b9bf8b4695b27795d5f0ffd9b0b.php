<p>Ambitious: Chat soon turns to Polly's future where Amy reveals that she wants her daughter to become a lawyer </p>

<p>To which mother Jules quips: 'I had them hopes for you Amy, you know, you're a business woman now but...'</p>

<p>Amy then instructs Polly to go inside and get more crystals to decorate her other arm during the afternoon tea.</p>

<p>The reality star recently defended her decision to show one child on screen, but not the other. </p>

<p>The TOWIE star shares daughter Polly, three, with her builder ex Bradley Wright, and son Ritchie Jr, two, with businessman ex Ritchie. </p>

<p>Confidence: Commenting on her granddaughter, Jules continues: 'She's more confident then you were, I don't know what she's going to be when she grows up.'</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun about their parenting styles, she explained that she and Ritchie's father made the decision to keep their child out of the public eye, which is why he hasn't been featured on social media or television. </p>

<p>Shockingly, Amy revealed she had been accused of not loving her son as much due to the decision. </p>

<p>She explained: 'He is a beautiful little boy, he is like a mini-me and of course I love him every bit as much as Polly. Polly has a different dad and I made different decision with Polly and it is that simple.</p>

<p>'It was a hard decision because I don't want Ritchie or Polly to grow up and say why did you do that with me and not my brother and sister.</p>

<p>Big plans: With Amy replying: 'Polly, I reckon you're going to be a lawyer, hopefully.'</p>

<p>Busy afternoon: Amy then instructs Polly to go inside and get more crystals to decorate her other arm during the afternoon tea</p>

<p>'All the constant messages questioning my love for Ritchie does get me down though because I love my children exactly the same.'</p>

<p>Amy has protected Ritchie's privacy so fiercely that his name was not even revealed until March this year, when she accidentally let it slip in an interview.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, although Amy has insisted she would never pressure Polly to follow in her footsteps with a career in reality television, she mused, 'I think she is made for TV'. </p>

<p>Amy shot to fame on TOWIE in 2010 and returned for it's tenth anniversary special in a bid to get her 'confidence back.'</p>

<p>Outrageous: The reality star recently defended her decision to show one child on screen, but not the other </p>

<p>The reality star previously revealed she was excited to be making the comeback after taking time to focus on her family.</p>

<p>She said: 'I felt like I really needed this to get my confidence back. I was focusing on my kids and my business and I needed this to focus on myself again, so that definitely means seeing me more on TV.'  </p>

<p>After some of the original stars failed to appear on the reunion, Amy criticised Mark Wright for snubbing the special, saying the cast should remember 'where we have come from'. </p>

<p>The Only Way Is Essex returns Sunday, 9pm on ITVBe. </p>
