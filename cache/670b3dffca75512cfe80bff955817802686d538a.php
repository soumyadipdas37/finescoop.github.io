<p>Screenshots show one of the slogans, which read ‘Xi Jinping must die for the sake of the world’, spray-painted on a main road before being blurred on the search engine’s website.</p>

<p>Google updated its Street View Map to include images of the city’s streets taken last October when Hong Kong was gripped by months of anti-government demonstrations.</p>

<p>The movement carried on as a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing to gain full control of the city spurred new waves of protests.</p>

<p>A picture released by Hong Kong Free Press shows the graffiti aimed at President Xi spray-painted on a line of plant pots separating traffic lanes on Nathan Road, where major rallies erupted during the demonstrations last year.</p>

<p>It said: ‘Anti-communist. Xi Jinping must die for the sake of the world.’ But the slogan was blurred out in another screenshot of the updated Google Street View.</p>

<p>The graffiti is revealed only when it is viewed from a distance further down the Kowloon thoroughfare, the report said.</p>

<p>Another slogan saying ‘liberate Hong Kong; the revolution of our times’ painted on the same road was also covered by blur. A spokesperson for Google said that the blurred-out graffiti was caused by ‘an algorithm error’, according to independent news outlet Hong Kong Free Press</p>

<p>A representative for the search engine giant claimed that the incident was caused by technical difficulties.</p>

<p>In a response to the Hong Kong news outlet, they said: ‘Our automatic blurring technology aims to blur faces and license plates so they can’t be identified, but it looks like we didn’t get it right in this instance.’</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Google for further comments.</p>
