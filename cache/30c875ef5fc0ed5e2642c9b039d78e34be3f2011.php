<p>'I can't even look at him sometimes because his constant movement, it stresses me out - do you feel like that?' she asked Franzel.</p>

<p>Olay wrote to one user, 'Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention. We no longer have a business relationship with this person and have no plans for future work together.</p>

<p>Quick to act: As the incident made headlines, people began tweeting at sponsors for Franzel - who previously appeared on 2014's Big Brother 16 and won the show two years later - calling for accountability for her actions</p>

<p>The Ubly, Michigan native also lost her gig endorsing Winery Chateau Ste. Michelle, who said on Thursday they had taken 'immediate action' to sever ties with Franzel after reviewing the incident</p>

<p>The others could be seen laughing as the bullying continued </p>

<p>The brand said they 'decided to end [their] collaboration now and in the future' with Franzel, adding, 'We do not tolerate or condone discrimination or bullying of any kind.'</p>

<p>The corporate moves came as group of Big Brother personalities called out Franzel and other cast members for their conduct.</p>

<p>Alum Kat Dunn post a list of 'strengths that come with Autism' to which Kaysar Ridha said, 'People on the spectrum are some of the best our society has to offer.</p>

<p>'I’m mortified by the actions of these Big Brother houseguests. Before leaving I reminded Ian to never let anyone laugh at him. Ever. Period. #BB22.'</p>

<p>Repercussions: The corporate moves came as group of Big Brother personalities called out Franzel and other cast members for their conduct</p>

<p>'It stresses me out': Memphis Garrett was among the contestants making fun of Ian Terry on Big Brother: All-Stars</p>

<p>Bullying: He even said he may have nightmares of Ian rocking at the end of his bed</p>

<p>Janelle Pierzina, who appeared on season 22 until last month, also commented on the incident, saying that 'instead of laughing they should be standing up for Ian,' as 'He has a disability.'</p>

<p>'If you’re on the spectrum and watching these clips, please don’t feel "weird" or any less amazing than you are,' Dunn said. 'Instead of crowding your timeline with more trash, I’m going to tweet out some other links with more important (and reputable) information for you to see #bb22.'</p>

<p>Season 15's Andy Herren put some of the onus on the network, adding, 'If production can tell houseguests to stop singing, they can tell houseguests to stop making fun of someone with autism.' </p>

<p>This is not the first time Big Brother contestants have been slammed for making racist or offensive remarks.</p>

<p>In a 2019 statement, CBS and show producers condoned some of the opinions expressed by their contestants.</p>

<p>'At times, the houseguests say things that we do not condone,' read the statement obtained by Us Weekly. 'We share some of the viewers' concerns about inappropriate behavior and offensive comments, and producers have addressed specific incidents with the houseguests involved. </p>

<p>'However, there is absolutely no truth that the casting of the show is racially motivated, that the houseguests' behavior is predetermined or that the outcome is controlled in any way.'</p>
