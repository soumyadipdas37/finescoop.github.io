<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump called a press briefing Sunday to staunchly defend his Supreme Court Justice pick Amy Coney Barrett after Democrats launched a series of attacks on her alleged inability to be an impartial judge due to her Catholic faith.</p>

<p>'We have noticed some comments made in the media about my incredibly qualified nominee Amy. The New York Times said her religion is not consistent with American values – she's Catholic. That covers a lot of people. That's a very disgraceful thing to say,' Trump told reporters gathered at the White House Sunday evening just a day after he announced his selection. </p>

<p>'I thought, though, on the religious situation with Amy – I thought we settled this 60 years ago with the election of John F. Kennedy,' Trump said referencing the first and only U.S. Catholic president.</p>

<p>Kennedy's nomination at the time was controversial as many Americans held strong anti-Catholic attitudes.</p>

<p>He was able to prevail, however, due to his vocal belief in the separation of church and state and ability to appeal to Catholic voters.</p>

<p>Trump vowed that Barrett's religion would not interfere with her decision making as a Supreme Court Justice – and five of the eight remaining justices are Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>Donald Trump called a press briefing Sunday to defend his Supreme Court pick after Democrats attacked her for her Catholic faith – claiming she might not be able to separate her religion from her duties  </p>

<p>'We have noticed some comments made in the media about my incredibly qualified nominee Amy. The New York Times said her religion is not consistent with American values – she's Catholic. That covers a lot of people. That's a very disgraceful thing to say,' Trump said</p>

<p>'I thought, though, on the religious situation with Amy – I thought we settled this 60 years ago with the election of John F. Kennedy,' Trump said during his briefing</p>

<p>Trump invoked the first and only Catholic president to defend Barrett and point to the ridiculousness of Democrats</p>

<p>'But seriously though, they're going after her Catholicism,' Trump lamented. 'I will stand with her, fight with her, and we will make sure these attacks stop. Because they're really – it's unprecedented.'</p>

<p>'They're basically fighting a major religion in our country,' the president said of Democrats. 'This is incredible. Fighting any religion – fighting Catholicism is just incredible.'</p>

<p>Democrats claim Barrett's religion could affect her thoughts on abortion when it comes to the landmark Roe v. Wade case.</p>

<p>Barrett's faith will likely play a role in her forthcoming Judiciary Committee hearings, which Chairman Lindsey Graham said will commence October 12.</p>

<p>The 48-year-old nominee is a member of the People of Praise, a small Catholic group that teaches husbands are the heads of the family.</p>

<p>Members of the group swear a loyalty oath, which some legal scholars have found problematic because they raise questions about a judge's impartiality and independence.</p>

<p>During Barrett's 2017 confirmation hearings for a seat on the Chicago-based 7th Circuit, she testified that while she was a devout Catholic, those views wouldn't bleed into her decisions on the bench.</p>

<p>Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, famously told Barrett, 'The dogma lives loudly within you.'</p>

<p>Although Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch was raised Cathlic, he is a practicing Episcopalian.</p>

<p>Nearly half of Americans, or 48.9 per cent, are Protestant – and the second largest religion in the country is Catholicism, making up 23 per cent of the population</p>

<p>Not even two percent of the populations are Mormons and only two per cent are Jewish.</p>

<p>Trump nominated Barrett (right) to the vacant Supreme Court seat on Saturday, and was forced one day later to defend his pick and her religion</p>

<p>Barrett was joined by her husband Jesse and their seven children – five biological and two adopted from Haiti – at the announcement Saturday</p>

<p>One per cent of the population of America are Muslim, another 1 per cent are Buddhist and another 1 per cent are Hindu.</p>

<p>Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan is Jewish, and late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who Barrett was nominated to replace, was also Jewish.</p>

<p>She died last Friday due to complications from pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>Trump officially announced Barrett's nomination on Saturday afternoon during an event in the Rose Garden.</p>

<p>During the president's briefing Saturday he was joined by Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and his attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani – both of whom are Catholic.</p>

<p>Trump said the two men were helping him with debate prep, including standing in as Democratic nominee Joe Biden. </p>
