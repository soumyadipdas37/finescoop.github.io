<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Aston Villa manager Dean Smith fears he will miss out on key target Said Benrahma as West Ham ramp up their interest in the Brentford star.</p>

<p>Smith has made exciting forward Benrahma a prime transfer target ahead of the new season but the club have been unable to clinch a deal.</p>

<p>And Sportsmail understands West Ham are now pushing to complete a deal for the Algerian, raising fears from the Villa boss that he is about to miss out on the attacker.</p>

<p>West Ham and Aston Villa are battling it out to sign Brentford forward Said Benrahma</p>

<p>Villa, who are also trying to sign Callum Wilson from Bournemouth, are unwilling to meet Brentford’s £20million asking price for Benrahma.</p>

<p>Indeed, no club as it stands have expressed an intention to pay the winger’s valuation fee, which could force Brentford into lowering their price.</p>

<p>Crystal Palace signed Eberechi Eze from QPR in a deal worth £14million, rising to £16m, earlier this summer.</p>

<p>Eze - like Benrahma - was one of the most exciting attacking midfielders in the Championship last season but the latter is priced significantly more than the former which has caused hesitation from the clubs interested in the Algerian to pay the asking price.</p>
