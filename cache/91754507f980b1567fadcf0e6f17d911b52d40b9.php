<p>Sportsmail rates each player who took to the field at Anfield...</p>

<p>Liverpool continued their fine start to the season with a 3-1 win over Arsenal at Anfield</p>

<p>LIVERPOOL (4-3-3)</p>

<p>Alisson Becker – What he does so well is burst into life when needed and made a couple of super interventions in the second period – 7.5</p>

<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold – Ran the game from right-back, an assist for Robertson, some glorious deliveries and a shot that struck the bar – 8.5</p>

<p>Joe Gomez – Stepped back into his position with the minimum of fuss, be good to see him get a prolonged sequence of starts now – 7</p>

<p>Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold (left) ran the game from right-back and laid on an assist</p>

<p>Virgil Van Dijk – You watch him sometimes and think he finds it all too easy; looked like he was never out of second gear – 7.5</p>

<p>Andrew Robertson – If you are going to make a mistake that leads to a goal, the best way to atone is with a goal of your own – 7</p>

<p>Gini Wijnaldum – Quietly effective, nothing out of the ordinary but kept the team ticking along as he usually does – 6.5</p>

<p>Fabinho – He might just be the best central defensive midfielder in Europe, cruised through the cost in imperious fashion – 8</p>

<p>Fabinho (left)'s performance might just prove he is one of the best midfielders in Europe</p>

<p>Naby Keita – Some nice moments and good use of the ball but you watch him and feel like there is so much more to come – 6.5</p>

<p>Mohamed Salah – No goals but was strong and he was quick and he’s started the season in blistering form – 8</p>

<p>Roberto Firmino – Gets said he doesn’t score enough but without him, Liverpool aren’t the same team. Arsenal didn’t know how to contain him – 7</p>

<p>Mohammed Salah (right) was not on the scoresheet but was still one of the best on the pitch</p>

<p>Sadio Mane – Perhaps fortunate to only be booked for an early elbow and that was a blot on a relentless evening when he scored again – 7</p>

<p>Subs: Adrian (GK), Minamino, Jones, Milner, Jota, Origi, Williams</p>

<p>Manager: Jurgen Klopp – You can see in his face that he still believes there is room for improvement but he had his team drilled perfectly and this was a statement of intent - 7</p>

<p>ARSENAL (3-4-3)</p>

<p>Bernd Leno – Needed to be stronger for Liverpool’s first goal, weakly palming the ball into Mane’s path – 5</p>

<p>Rob Holding – Much better than in the Community Shield against the same opponents, resilient and made some crucial interventions – 6.5</p>

<p>David Luiz – One superb moment to read a Van Dijk header and this was so much better than his nightmare here 12 months ago – 6</p>

<p>David Luiz (second right) was still on the losing side but was much improved at centre-back</p>

<p>Kieran Tierney – Left isolated by the system and received no help in his forlorn attempts to keep hold of Salah – 5</p>

<p>Hector Bellerin – Spent the evening working out how to keep Robertson and Mane in check but not to any great success – 5.5</p>

<p>Granit Xhaka – Couple of big tackles early on but spent the rest of the time being harangued and was eventually replaced – 5</p>

<p>Mohamed Elneny – Most industrious member of Arsenal’s midfield, worked so hard to try and repel the Red tide – 6</p>

<p>Mohammed Elneny (right) was one of the more industrious members in the Arsenal midfield</p>

<p>Ainsley Maitland-Niles – Didn’t know whether he was a wing-back or a full-back and should have worked in tandem with Tierney – 5</p>

<p>Willian – Frustrating night for the Brazilian, got no change out of Robertson and saw very little of the ball in an attacking sense – 5.5</p>

<p>Alexander Lacazette – Alert, as every good striker should be, to take advantage of a gift but wasted a chance to score a second – 6</p>

<p>Alex Lacazette was alert to give Arsenal the lead but should have added more later in the game</p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – That Arsenal only touched the ball twice in Liverpool’s penalty area in the first 45 minutes tells how quiet he was – 5</p>

<p>Subs: Runarsson (GK), Saka, Gabriel, Pepe, Nketiah, Kolasinac</p>

<p>Manager: Mikel Arteta – Had to ditch his plan to contain Liverpool but the introduction of Ceballos for Xhaka gave Arsenal some belated impetus – 6</p>

<p>Referee: Craig Pawson – He will be relieved that it was a night that was free of controversy but right to ask whether he let Mane off lightly in the first half – 6</p>
