<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Formula 1 star Kimi Raikkonen has made no secret of his longing for the sport's more daring days off the track to return - and has cheekily hit out at world champion Lewis Hamilton via a hilarious meme.</p>

<p>The side-by-side montage shows a shirtless James Hunt, who won the 1976 championship, smoking and drinking.Â </p>

<p>A picture of Hamilton, dressed head to toe in a very questionable matching outfit, has been added in next to him to underline the drastic change between drivers past and present.</p>

<p>Kimi Raikkonen has delivered a sly riposte as world champion Lewis Hamilton on Instagram</p>

<p>Hamilton's questionable outfit has been compared to the lavish lifestyle of the late James Hunt</p>

<p>Raikkonen has compared his own rock and roll ways to Hamilton by posting a photo of himself looking worse for wear and accompanying it with the caption, 'Not all hope is lost yet!'</p>

<p>The six-time champion Hamilton has been snapped aboard a scooter in patterned clothes, complete with bucket hat. He was also caught wearing pink socks and white trainers while posing.</p>

<p>The photo of Hamilton and Hunt has provided his rival Raikkonen with some perfect material for a sly dig, and the 40-year-old duly delivered by titling the meme 'Evolution of a Formula 1 driver'.</p>

<p>Raikkonen (L) is longing for F1's rock and roll days to return after posting his own throwback</p>

<p>James Hunt, the 1976 world champion, has proved a great source of inspiration for Raikkonen</p>
