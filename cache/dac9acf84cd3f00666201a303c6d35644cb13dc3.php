<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two thugs beat a husband to death in front of his wife after he intervened when they racially abused her, a court has heard.</p>

<p>Amaan Momand, 23, died from serious head injuries in September last year, three days after he was attacked in the Maypole area of Birmingham.</p>

<p>His wife, Halima Hussain, told police the attack started shortly after Jamie Taylor, 22, called her a 'p*** c***,' as she crossed the road. </p>

<p>Taylor, joined by 18-year-old Taylor Pountney, allegedly returned and attacked Amaan, after he tried to intervene in the row. </p>

<p>Both Taylor, from Kings Heath, and Pountney, from Yardley, deny a charge of murder. </p>

<p>A trial at Coventry Crown Court heard statements from an interview Ms Hussain gave to police following the attack, which happened near an Iceland supermarket at around 4.40pm on September 19.</p>

<p>In her statement, she said her husband was 'literally beaten to death'. </p>

<p>Amaan Momand, 23, died from serious head injuries three days after he was attacked in Birmingham last September, a court has heard</p>

<p>Mrs Hussain said: 'As I walked into the centre of the road, a car came up and a boy shouted "you p*** c***". </p>

<p>'I shouted back: "You white c**t," the car carried on driving.</p>

<p>'I carried on walking, me and my partner were saying stuff like' "It's racist, it's not nice, why do people do these things?"</p>

<p>'The car went around the corner and stopped. The boys left the car and started walking towards us.'</p>

<p>Mrs Hussain then described the confrontation which followed. </p>

<p>Mrs Hussain said: 'The boy came towards us and said: "What the f*** did you say?"</p>

<p>'I said: "You called me a p*** c*** so I called you a white c<strong><em>".  I said I can't walk, I have sciatica. The boy said: "I don't give a f</em></strong>".'</p>

<p>Mrs Hussain told police that her husband then tried to intervene saying: 'Why did you try and run her over? She's a woman, she's my wife'.</p>

<p>'The boy said "I'll smash you you m***********".'</p>

<p>Mrs Hussain said she told her husband to 'leave the boy alone, he's just a kid'. Mrs Hussain told police: 'The boy said: "I'm not young I'm 22 I'll knock him out", then the second boy threw a punch at my partner. At my partner's face. My husband's cap fell off.</p>

<p>'Then he went to pick it up but before he got up the other boy kicked him in the side of head.'</p>

<p>Mrs Hussain said the pair then ran off into a car that drove away.</p>

<p>Mrs Hussain tearfully told police: 'I was screaming and crying, there was blood everywhere on the floor.'</p>

<p>She added that as Mr Momand was taken away she was 'so scared because I wanted to be with him'.</p>

<p>Mrs Hussain explained to the interviewing police officer how upset it made her feel to be racially abused.</p>

<p>Flowers were left at the scene of the attack, which allegedly started after Mr Momand intervened when his wife was called a p*** c***</p>

<p>Mrs Hussain said: 'We were just going shopping. Why do we have to get attacked? I don't feel safe in my house anymore.' </p>

<p>The officer asked if there was any 'warning' the two defendants were  going to be violent towards them.</p>

<p>Mrs Hussain replied: 'He just kept saying: 'I'll f****** smash you' to my husband.'</p>

<p>When the officer asked what Mr Momand had done, Mrs Hussain said: 'Nothing he was just asking: "Why are you saying that to my wife?"'</p>

<p>She then broke off in tears before saying: 'They literally beat him to death.' </p>

<p>A post-mortem examination revealed that Mr Momand died from a head injury.</p>

<p>Reporting restrictions meant Pountney's identity was not initially published as he was 17 at the time of the incident. But he can now be named after turning 18.</p>

<p>The trial is set to last for three to four weeks.</p>
