<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Teachers reacted angrily yesterday after being told their GCSE pupils will have to study poetry after all.</p>

<p>They accused the country’s largest exam board, AQA, of giving in to ‘demands of some celebrity poets’ by making the topic compulsory in next year’s exams.</p>

<p>Last month exam regulator Ofqual said that as a result of lengthy school closures caused by coronavirus, pupils would be able to drop poetry from their GCSE English literature courses.</p>

<p>Poet Laureate Simon Armitage (pictured) was one of the 'celebrity' poets who attacked Ofqual's decision that pupils would be able to drop poetry from their GCSE English literature courses</p>

<p>Poet Laureate Simon Armitage and former children’s laureate Michael Rosen were among leading British poets who attacked the decision. </p>

<p>And the AQA has now decided to make poetry study compulsory, alongside Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The Association of School and College Leaders is calling for the proposals to be reconsidered. </p>

<p>However the country’s largest exam board, AQA, has now decided to make poetry study compulsory, alongside Shakespeare</p>

<p>General secretary Geoff Barton said: ‘If this stands, it means that curriculum planning which took place over the summer will have to be revisited and plans redrawn. This is the last thing that schools need.’</p>

<p>One English teacher tweeted the AQA: ‘You’ve given in to the demands of some celebrity poets and enforced the poetry. </p>

<p>'This is disgusting treatment of already over-worked staff and stressed students.’</p>

<p>Last night Pauline McPartlan, of the AQA, said: ‘We’re taking another look at our GCSE English literature changes to see if we can do something closer to what schools were expecting.’</p>
