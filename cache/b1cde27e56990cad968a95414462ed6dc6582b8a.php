<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Viewers ruthlessly slammed Locky Gilbert's choice of ring in The Bachelor grand finale on Thursday. </p>

<p>After breaking Bella Veralis' heart, Locky declared his love for Irena Srbinovska and gifted her with a ring to remember the special occasion.</p>

<p>The ring appeared to be adorned by a purple gem and was flanked by marquise-shaped jewels.</p>

<p>'That's one ugly ring': Locky Gilbert is slammed for his 'hideous' taste in jewellery for his winning lady Irena Srbinovska... while others suggest the purple jewel was meant for dumped Bella Veralis</p>

<p>Avid fans of the show flocked to Twitter to mock Locky's taste, including one who said: 'That's one ugly ring... but like Locky's tattoos.' </p>

<p>'What in the gumball machine plastic ring is that?!' wrote another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another joked: 'Only Locky would just bung a ring of that calibre in his pocket. When he proposes he will probably chuck the ring at her head while she cruises the block on a scooter in Bali.'  </p>

<p>Unimpressed: Avid fans of the show flocked to Twitter to mock Locky's taste, including one who said, 'That's one ugly ring... but like Locky's tattoos.'</p>

<p>Fans also compared Locky's ring to 2015 Bachelor Sam Wood's infamous 'cheezel ring' for his now-wife Snezana. </p>

<p>'I hate this ring almost as much as the cheezel ring,' they wrote.  </p>

<p>'Sorry, but that ring is f***ing hideous and the worst Bachelor ring ever and yes, I do remember the cheezel ring,' echoed another.</p>

<p>However, there were viewers who actually liked the ring, including one who said: 'Definitely not the ugliest ring we've seen on this show.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other fans couldn't help but notice that the purple ring appeared to match Bella's dress and floral arrangement.</p>

<p>One tweeted: 'The backdrop AND the ring matched Bella's dress, why do I feel like he changed his mind last minute?'</p>

<p>'The ring is purple, the setting is purple, and so is Bella's dress. Go figure,' another write before a third chipped in: 'Does that ring match Bella's dress or what?'  </p>

<p>Not that bad: But there were viewers who actually liked the ring, including one who said: 'Definitely not the ugliest ring we've seen on this show'</p>

<p>Sneaking suspicion: Meanwhile, other fans couldn't help but notice that the purple ring appeared to match Bella's dress and floral arrangement.</p>

<p>In the end, Locky chose to end things with Bella to pursue a relationship with Irena.</p>

<p>He told her: 'When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.'</p>

<p>'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'</p>
