<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> EX-health minister Lord Owen has admitted the health department's actions contributed to the tainted blood scandal.</p>

<p> Speaking at the Infected Blood Inquiry yesterday, the peer said the governments of the day failed to take action despite knowing imported blood supplies were ‘contaminated’.</p>

<p> Thousands of Britons were infected with HIV and hepatitis in the 1970s and 1980s after being treated with blood products imported from America. </p>

<p>As Labour health minister between 1974-1976, Lord Owen said he tried to reduce the number of tainted products coming from the US.</p>

<p>Ex-health minister Lord Owen admitted the health department's actions contributed to the tainted blood scandal</p>

<p>But after he left in 1976, he said the department quietly abandoned the policy.</p>

<p> 'It's maladministration... I am appalled this commitment was never secured – as a result infected blood was introduced long after it needed to be,' he told the first day of the reopened inquiry.</p>

<p>The contaminated blood scandal has been labelled the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS amid claims of a government cover-up. </p>

<p>The current inquiry comes after two previous ones were branded whitewashes.</p>

<p> The peer said he had later 'kicked' himself for not realising earlier that something was 'seriously wrong' with the self-sufficiency policy he had pledged to pursue in the mid-1970s through the commitment of £500,000 in funding.</p>

<p>Lord Owen said he understood the 'anger' and 'resentment' of those affected.</p>

<p>The inquiry heard that at the time Lord Owen was at the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS), a new therapeutic treatment for haemophilia patients had emerged, known as anti-haemophilic globulin concentrate (AHG), an example being the product Factor VIII, which were commercially available.</p>

<p>It also heard how the UK had insufficient amounts of AHG to meet the demand from clinicians.</p>

<p>Lord Owen, a qualified doctor, explained the new treatments relied on pooled human blood that could carry the risk of passing on infections such as hepatitis.</p>

<p>'The bigger the pool of donors, the greater the risk, because one donation in a thousand will contaminate,' he said.</p>

<p>Asked by counsel to the inquiry Jenni Richards QC if he recalled any discussions within the department over these risks, Lord Owen replied: 'Yes.'</p>

<p>Lord Owen said he wanted to end a reliance on imports largely from America, but the move to self-sufficiency was going to take two to three years.</p>

<p>'What I did feel was that you've got to stop this blood coming in from, mainly America,' he said.</p>

<p>He explained he had realised it was 'dangerous' to 'rely on blood coming in from abroad, from people who were giving their blood for money'.</p>

<p>'We wanted to get to that point at the earliest possible opportunity because you were doing what you didn't want to do, which was buying contaminated (products),' he added.</p>

<p>The inquiry continues.</p>
