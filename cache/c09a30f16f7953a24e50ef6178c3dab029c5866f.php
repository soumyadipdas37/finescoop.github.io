<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Aston Martin has just release a one-hit wonder. The British manufacturer has wowed petrolhead today with the surprise reveal of a hypercar it says is the 'wildest' road machine it has ever created.</p>

<p>Called the Victor, it's a one-of-a-kind model that combines features from bonkers vehicles from the British brand's recent history, including the One-77, Vulcan track car and £3million Valkyrie. The price? 'North of £2million,' according to a brand spokesman.</p>

<p>It has been created by Aston Martin's Bond-inspired Q division and uses a 7.3-litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine that produces a staggering 836bhp and - in what will be music to the ears of driving enthusiasts - comes with a manual gearbox.</p>

<p>One-hit wonder: This is the Aston Martin Victor. A one-off road car revealed on Friday at the Concours of Elegance at Hampton Court Palace, London</p>

<p>Aston Martin says this is the most powerful road-going naturally aspirated product it has ever built and the highest performing stick-shift powertrain in the marque’s history.</p>

<p>Unveiled at the Concours of Elegance at Hampton Court Palace, London, it has been inspired by the iconic Aston Martin V8 Vantage of the 1970s and '80s and the '70s DBS V8.</p>

<p>The unique car started life as a prototype for the One-77 hypercar - a model which launched in 2009 and just 77 production examples were made at a cost of £1.15million a piece.</p>

<p>That means it gets the same ultra-lightweight carbon-fibre monocoque chassis, which was originally tuned for the road instead of the track.</p>

<p>The powerplant is also the same 7.3-litre V12 unit from the decade-old supercar, which has been sent back to Cosworth to be tweaked to increase performance.</p>

<p>The 750bhp output for the One-77 has now been upped to a massive 836bhp and remains naturally aspirated.</p>

<p>That means it's guaranteed to make your eardrums ring for a few hours if you get too close, so loud is the engine roar.</p>

<p>The Victor started life as a prototype for the One-77 supercar (pictured), which was produced by Aston Martin from 2009. Just 77 examples of the road car were built, each priced at £1.15million</p>

<p>Victor uses the One-77's ultra-lightweight carbon-fibre monocoque chassis, which was originally tuned for the road instead of the track</p>

<p>With the motor up front, the masses of power is delivered only to the rear wheels and via a six-speed manual gearbox.</p>

<p>To ensure a fluffed gear change doesn't result in an almost-certain obliteration due to the endless levels of power being sent through the drivetrain, Aston Martin's Q team has wisely fitted a motorsport clutch.</p>

<p>And it's not just the One-77 that's turned donor for the one-off Victor.</p>

<p>It also inherits the suspension system from the British maker's track-only Vulcan, of which there are only 24 in the world and also costing in the region of £2million a piece.</p>

<p>The carbon-ceramic Brembo brake discs, incredible - web-like - wheels and F1-style steering wheel have also been ripped from the Vulcan project.</p>

<p> The V12 motor has been tuned to produce a massive 836bhp - up from 750bhp originally - and remains naturally aspirated</p>

<p>The Victor also inherits the suspension system from the British maker's track-only, plane-inspired, Vulcan (pictured), of which there are only 24 in the world and also costing in the region of £2million a piece</p>

<p>Some of the other design features are ripped from the Aston Martin Valkyerie (pictured), which is a yet-to-be-released £3million hypercar seen here testing at Silverstone</p>

<p>The muscle-bound hypercar has also taken design and aero elements from the forthcoming £3million Valkyerie - including its tail light - and even features the same vents you can find on Aston Martin's new - and first - SUV, the £158,000 DBX.</p>

<p>On the inside, the cabin is cloaked in high-grade 'Forest Green and Conker Bridge of Weir' leathers that look like they've been picked from a designer satchel. </p>

<p>The roof lining is Cashmere. </p>

<p>The F1-style sawn-off steering wheel is also from the Vulcan track car and all the switch gear is finely-crafted aluminium and titanium</p>

<p>There are walnut sections throughout the car, including the base for the infotainment screen. The manual gearknob is also made from a single piece of Crown cut solid wood</p>

<p>Aston Martin says these luxurious materials 'juxtapose the highly technical carbon fibre chassis', racing seats and harness seatbelts. </p>

<p>Perfectly-chiseled anodised aluminium and machined and polished titanium switches add to the boutique cockpit feel and there are elements of Crown cut solid walnut across the car’s dashboard, door inserts and - wonderfully - a gearknob carved out of a single piece of the pricey wood. </p>

<p>The name itself is a nod to Victor Gauntlett, who was the boss of Aston Martin when it launched the V8 Vantage in the late 1970s.  </p>

<p>The carbon-ceramic Brembo brake discs, incredible - web-like - wheels seen here are also modified versions of part fitted to the Vulcan</p>

<p>The Victor has been inspired by the iconic Aston Martin V8 Vantage of the 1970s and '80s and the '70s DBS V8, the brand says</p>

<p>How much would this one-off car cost if you were the lucky buyer? Aston Martin says the price tag will be 'north of £2million'</p>
