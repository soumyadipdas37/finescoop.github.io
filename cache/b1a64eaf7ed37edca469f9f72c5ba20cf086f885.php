<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A young mother killed herself and her toddler son after she broke up with the boy's father, an inquest heard.</p>

<p>Hairdressing student Kia Russell, 19, and Kamari Russell, two, were found hanging at their home in Ipswich on March 6 last year, a week before Kamari's third birthday.</p>

<p>Kia's father Aaron Russell, who found the pair, told an inquest in Ipswich she had broken up with her partner Carnell Dines two or three weeks earlier.</p>

<p>Suffolk's area coroner Jacqueline Devonish concluded Kamari was unlawfully killed and that Ms Russell died by suicide.</p>

<p>Post-mortem examinations recorded the cause of death in both cases as compression of the neck caused by suspension hanging.</p>

<p>Hairdressing student Kia Russell, 19, and Kamari Russell (pictured togrther), two, were found hanging at their home in Ipswich on March 6 last year, a week before Kamari's third birthday</p>

<p>Kia's father Aaron Russell, who found the pair, told an inquest in Ipswich she had broken up with her partner Carnell Dines two or three weeks earlier. Left: Kia. Right: Her son</p>

<p>Ms Devonish said Ms Russell and Mr Dines 'made a lovely couple' and 'did fight to keep their relationship together'.</p>

<p>She said: 'They were very young and they were coping with a young child. They were very well supported by their families.</p>

<p>'Even so we know from medical evidence now that Kia was quietly and silently suffering. She didn't share that with her family.</p>

<p>'She briefly mentioned to Carnell and to her mother that she was feeling down but from all the evidence she was a private person. She found it difficult to talk about her emotions.'</p>

<p>Ms Russell had been diagnosed with depression, her GP notes said, with reports of low mood starting when she was in Year 10.</p>

<p>Senior mental health nurse Lynn Harrison, of the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, said Ms Russell 'felt her responsibilities as a young mum were different to that of her peers', adding that 'she was quite isolated'.</p>

<p>Coroner Ms Devonish said: 'The family were totally unaware that she was depressed in the way she was. She seemed quite good at hiding it.'</p>

<p>Ms Harrison said: 'It's not unusual for families not to be aware of the amount of emotional pain that's going on behind.'</p>

<p>Ms Harrison said the relationship break-up was a 'big destabilising factor' for Ms Russell.</p>

<p>She said Ms Russell told her in 2018 that she did not wish to have counselling but that she was open to medications and was prescribed the anti-depressant drug Sertraline.</p>

<p>Her mother Leanne Clarke said Ms Russell stopped taking her tablets. Ms Harrison said: 'She may have started it and had significant side effects.'</p>

<p>Kia's father, Aaron Russell, said: 'She was just a happy girl all the time to be honest, always smiling, always laughing, being silly. She was dedicated to her son and her work.'</p>

<p>He described Kamari as a 'very intelligent young man', adding that he was 'always happy, clean, well looked after'.</p>

<p>Post-mortem examinations recorded the cause of death in both cases as compression of the neck caused by suspension hanging. Pictured: Kia's house where it happened</p>

<p>Mr Dines, giving evidence, said Ms Russell had previously shown him cuts on her wrists and told him she wanted to end her life.</p>

<p>He said: 'I thought she wasn't going to go through with it, she just felt down that time.'</p>

<p>His mother Justine Dines said her son was just 14 when Kamari was born.</p>

<p>Detective Constable David Spence, of the joint Norfolk and Suffolk Murder Investigation Team, said police looked at messages between Ms Russell and Mr Dines.</p>

<p>Mr Spence said: 'There were a number of texts where Kia was explaining she thought Carnell was socialising too much with friends.</p>

<p>'She thought he should be spending more time at home, not going out spending money, but the general arguments were low level.</p>

<p>'There's certainly no reference to violence or anything like that but you could see it was a very up and down relationship that they had together.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'Clearly they were in difficult circumstances having had their child at such young ages.</p>

<p>'They did their best but for whatever reasons the relationship has been very tumultuous. They're a very sad set of tragic circumstances.'</p>

<p>He said Mr Dines was interviewed under caution and released with no further action. He was 17 at the time.</p>

<p>Coroner Ms Devonish expressed her sympathy to family members at Tuesday's inquest.</p>
