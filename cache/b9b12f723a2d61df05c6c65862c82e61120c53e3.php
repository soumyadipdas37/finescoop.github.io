<p>'It's a special day today. My boyfriend's birthday, and I don't share him on Insta purely because I like to keep my love life private,' she told her 181,000 followers.</p>

<p>'People wanna ruin a good thing and I don't want that for us,' she added. </p>

<p>Instagram official! Married At First Sight star Cathy Evans debuted her new boyfriend, Richard, on social media</p>

<p>Richard's face can't be made out in the drawing, presumably because he wants to keep his identity a secret, but he appears to have a beard and a sleeve tattoo.   </p>

<p>Cathy was married to Josh Pihlak on the reality series, but the couple ended their relationship during the season after she clashed with his mother.  </p>
