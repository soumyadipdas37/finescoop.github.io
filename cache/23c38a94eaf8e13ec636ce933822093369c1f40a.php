<p>Weeks before new series: The Sun claims Karen, 38 - who was previously married to dancer Kevin Clifton - and opera singer David, 35, have 'quietly' ended their romance with David leaving their London home (pictured August 2019)</p>

<p>The Venezuelan beauty divorced Strictly co-star Kevin Clifton, 38, in 2018. He is now in a relationship with his former Strictly partner Stacey Dooley, 33.</p>

<p>Despite the breakdown of their three-year marriage, the former couple are now in a good place, with Karen revealing that she has a 'really lovely' friendship with her ex-husband.  </p>

<p>In their first couple's photoshoot and interview with Hello! magazine last year, Karen revealed how thrilled she is to have David in her life.</p>

<p>She said: 'He's my rock. It's so nice to have someone that understands and accepts me, doesn't judge and doesn't try to change me in any way.</p>

<p>'Everyone just falls in love with him too, because he has such a beautiful soul.'</p>

<p>Split: A source said: 'It finished on good terms, they have a mutual respect for one another and there were no other parties involved – the relationship simply ran its course</p>

<p>In February 2020, Karen also told the publication when asked about whether the pair would marry: 'Never say never. It's really beautiful to be married, regardless of what's happened in the past." </p>

<p>The couple were first seen together on Boxing Day in 2018, after David spent the festive period with Karen and her family in New York, before taking things to the next level when they moved in together in April 2019.  </p>

<p>It has been claimed that Karen is set to be coupled with boxer Nicola Adams in the show's first same-sex pairing.   </p>

<p>According to bookmakers Ladbrokes, Karen is firm favourite to team up with Nicola, with her odds coming in at 5/4.</p>

<p>Happier times: They added that Karen feels at the 'top of her game' and that her recent heartache is driving her to work hard on the new series - which is set to launch on October 17</p>

<p>She's battling it out with Katya Jones who is at 2/1, while Oti Mabuse comes in at 3/1. </p>

<p>A source told Express.co.uk: 'The fingers are pointing towards fan favourite Karen and Nicola being paired together to make Strictly history.'  </p>

<p>'I’ve danced with women a lot over the years, so I feel very comfortable about it. All the dancers would love to see it on the show.' </p>

<p>Nicola has also shared her excitement with dancing with another woman as she explained: 'It's amazing to be a part of the movement for change, diversity and breaking boundaries in the entertainment industry.'  </p>

<p>Speaking live from her home on BBC Breakfast, Nicola said of her groundbreaking all-female pairing: 'It's really important, it's a big step for the show as well. It's nice to see we've been able to move on and I just can't wait to get some dancing done really.' </p>

<p>Revealing she approached Strictly with the idea for a same-sex pairing, Nicola explained: 'I asked the show about it. They wanted to know if I wanted to be on the show and I said "yeah I'll do it but I want to dance with another female dance partner".'  </p>

<p>They continued: 'It goes without saying all of the female professionals would love to partner with Nicola this year.</p>

<p>'It’s the most sought after position in showbiz right now and it looks like Strictly stalwarts Karen, Katya and Oti are the front runners.'</p>

<p>A Strictly representative declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.  </p>

<p>Karen meanwhile has previously expressed her desire to be partnered with a female contestant.</p>

<p>She said to The Sun on Sunday: 'It’s a beautiful way to showcase emotion on stage and I’d definitely like to do it.</p>
