<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Daniel Cormier has reaffirmed his decision to hang up his gloves and leave UFC after his defeat to Stipe Miocic last month, saying: 'You have to understand when it's time'.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old was left badly hurt as the American beat him via unanimous decision at UFC 252 in a five-round slugfest Las Vegas - claiming he was struggling to see out of his left eye.</p>

<p>At the time he promised it was goodbye and that it had been 'a helluva ride', and now he has insisted there is no way back for him in the sport because he can no longer perform at the highest level at his age. </p>

<p>Daniel Cormier has admitted he has no plans to fight again after his defeat to Stipe Miocic </p>

<p>The 41-year-old insists he 'can't fight father time' and feels it is the right moment to call it a day</p>

<p>Speaking for the first time since UFC 252, <?php echo e('@'); ?>dc_mma provided an update on the eye that was injured in his fight with Stipe Miocic. pic.twitter.com/GeejTal043</p>

<p>'I'm not going to fight anymore,' he told ESPN.</p>

<p>'I was talking to Joe Rogan after the fight, and I told him my interest is fighting for championships, and I can't imagine with a loss that I'd be fighting for a belt again.</p>

<p>'I lost two fights in a row for the first time in my career. You've got to understand when it's time, and the reality is part of the reason I got hit with that right hand by Stipe is because I'm older. You can't fight father time.</p>

<p>'At 41-years-old, I fought the heavyweight champion of the world three rounds to two with the idea that I wanted to win.</p>

<p>'I didn't go in there trying to give a good account of myself. I wanted to win the fight and I still believe I can beat Stipe Miocic. But every day that passes, it doesn't work in my favor.'</p>

<p>He was left needing hospital treatment after his defeat to Miocic but will avoid eye surgery </p>

<p>Cormier had to be taken to hospital for treatment after the loss in his trilogy fight with Miocic. He tore his cornea during the clash and was left blinded for the second half of the contest, but has luckily avoided needing eye surgery - despite suffering badly with his vision initially.  </p>

<p>'The first week and a half, [the eye] was really bad, it wasn't opening, and it was completely blurry, but now it kind of feels like an eyelash is in it.</p>

<p>'I went and saw the doctor last week, and he told me I'm probably not going to have to have surgery, just kind of rest and recover.</p>

<p>He posted a farewell message to his followers in August, saying it had been 'a helluva ride'</p>

<p>'And today it feels good, but just feels like something in there, you know when you get an eyelash and can't get it out? It's just right in the corner.</p>

<p>'It was concerning initially, because they didn't know how severe the impact was going to be going forward.</p>

<p>'They didn't know if I was going to have to have surgery and do all these other things. Luckily I was able to recover, and I feel better, and I prefer not to have surgery.'</p>

<p>In a farewell message to his fans on social media last month, Cormier was gracious in defeat - saying it was 'a pleasure to share a ring' with Miocic and thanked his team for supporting him.</p>

<p>Cormier was pleased with his display against Miocic but feels he is too old for the top level </p>

<p>'Congrats to <?php echo e('@'); ?>stipemiocic on a fantastic fight, was an honor and pleasure to share the octagon with you for 50 minutes. Boy did we give 'em a show everytime. </p>

<p>'To my team: I love you all to death, you've made so many sacrifices. I hope I made you guys proud. Salina and the kids: thank you for being my motivation. To all the fans: I love you so much. You guys push me to try and be great.</p>

<p>'To <?php echo e('@'); ?>danawhite and the <?php echo e('@'); ?>ufc: I have loved every minute. Thank you for giving me the opportunity. Been a helluva ride, huh?'</p>
