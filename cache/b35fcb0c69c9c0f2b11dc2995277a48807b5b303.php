<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 23-year-old Sydney woman experiencing a cannabis-induced psychosis was fatally injured when she slipped from a police officer's grasp and plunged 10 metres headfirst onto a road.</p>

<p>Grace Herington had been discharged from hospital hours before she was chased by police and fell off a road ramp in Sydney's lower north shore.</p>

<p>Despite her death occurring as the result of a police operation, State Coroner Teresa O'Sullivan said in inquest findings released on Wednesday 'police took appropriate action in the circumstances'.</p>

<p>Grace Herington, who was sufferingÂ cannabis-induced psychosis, had been discharged from hospital hours before she was chased by police and fell off a road ramp in Sydney's lower north shore (file picture)</p>

<p>Ms Herington was described as a beautiful, happy woman and a loyal friend. The dux of her school went on to Sydney University in 2015, but felt isolated from her peers.</p>

<p>During her studies she became overcome with stress and in October reported of suffering persistent headaches.</p>

<p>She was prescribed melatonin and given special consideration for poor exam results, and experienced what her family calls a 'breakdown' at the end of 2016.</p>

<p>For the first time in 2017 she started experimenting with cannabis and LSD.</p>

<p>After receiving low exam results towards the end of 2018 her brother noticed her behaviour becoming erratic.</p>

<p>After smoking cannabis with a friend on December 15 that year she experienced hallucinations. Three days later she made some bizarre phone calls to her parents where she said she had 'stopped 9/11, but I didn't kill [a named person]'.</p>

<p>Ms Herington was taken to hospital on December 18 as a voluntary patient, and after assessment 'did not display suicidality, wasn't aggressive or overly agitated, and had indicated she would see her psychologist the next day,' and was discharged.</p>

<p>After returning to the Hunters Hill unit where she lived with her brother, her unusual behaviour prompted him to call emergency services.</p>

<p>She escaped out her window and paramedics tailed her movements, and police arrived shortly after.</p>

<p>Senior Constable Timothy Shields observed her screaming and running erratically towards the road.</p>

<p>Ms Herington 'climbed over a guard rail, lay down along a low cyclone fence and then tipped over the edge' at which point Sen Const Shields took hold of her leg.</p>

<p>But swinging her body he was unable to hold onto her and she fell onto the road.</p>

<p>Her death in hospital from multiple blunt force injuries was described by Ms O'Sullivan as a 'tragic end to a young and promising life'.</p>
