<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>China has landed its secretive reusable experimental spacecraft back on Earth after a successful two-day test flight.  </p>

<p>Long March-2F carrier was launched into orbit last Friday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the northwestern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia.</p>

<p>It returned to the scheduled landing site as planned on Sunday, the official state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.  </p>

<p>The reusable experimental spacecraft, of which no pictures have emerged, was launched to test 'reusable technologies' during its flight and could lead to a 'convenient and inexpensive way' to reach space. </p>

<p>A Long March-2F carrier delivered the spacecraft into orbit from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in north-western Chinese region Inner Mongolia, reported state media Xinhua. The file picture shows a modified model of the Long March CZ-2F rocket carrying the unmanned spacecraft Shenzhou 8 taking off from northwest China on November 1, 2011</p>

<p>'China's reusable experimental spacecraft on Sunday returned to the scheduled landing site after a two-day in-orbit operation,' said Xinhua. </p>

<p>'The successful flight marked the country's important breakthrough in reusable spacecraft research and is expected to offer convenient and low-cost round trip transport for the peaceful use of the space.'  </p>

<p>Orbital data later confirmed that the vehicle had been placed in an orbit at a similar height to China's previous crewed flights, New Scientist reports. </p>

<p>The 'space plane' could take Chinese astronauts to and from China's planned future space station. </p>

<p>'A space plane is an ideal technology for atmospheric re-entry due to less brutal accelerations for the human body,' said Shenzhen-based space analyst Jean Deville. </p>

<p>The mission appears to have been carried out with low-key preparations and high-level security, and the specifics of the spacecraft are yet to be revealed. </p>

<p>No images of the spacecraft or its lift-off have yet to be released, and staff and visitors at the launch site were prevented from filming or discussing the project online, according to reports. </p>

<p>A copy of an official document circulated online warned people not to film on the launch site or discuss the project online, according to South China Morning Post.</p>

<p>The official memo read: 'All units should strengthen personnel security education and personnel management during missions to ensure that there is no leakage of secrets.' </p>

<p>A Chinese military source suggested that the Chinese spacecraft was similar to the X-37B, a reusable robotic spacecraft launched by the US Air Force. The file picture taken in April, 2010 shows X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle in the encapsulation cell at the Astrotech facility in Titusville</p>

<p>A Chinese military source confirmed the authenticity of the notice to the Hong Kong newspaper and said: 'There are many firsts in this launch. </p>

<p>'The spacecraft is new, the launch method is also different. That's why we need to make sure there is extra security.' </p>

<p>The source also suggested that the Chinese spacecraft was similar to the X-37B, a reusable robotic spacecraft launched by the US Air Force.</p>

<p>Also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle, the US's unmanned spacecraft takes off vertically and returns to the Earth horizontally on a runway landing.</p>

<p>The Boeing-made space plane has flown four secret, long-duration missions in Earth orbit to date. </p>

<p>On July 23, China launched its Tianwen-1 spacecraft (pictured) to Mars, which is due to arrive on the Red Planet next February after a seven-month, 34-million-mile voyage</p>

<p>A Long March-5 rocket carrying an orbiter, lander and rover as part of the Tianwen-1 mission to Mars, blasts off from the Wenchang Space Launch Centre on July 23 in Hainan, China</p>

<p>China revealed back in 2017 that it's planning to launch a spacecraft in 2020 that can fly like an aircraft and would be reusable, increasing the frequency of launches and lowering mission costs.</p>

<p>Last year, it became the first country to land a robot rover on the moon's little-seen far side, and in July this year launched its robot rover to Mars.    </p>

<p>The Tianwen-1 is due to arrive on the Red Planet next February after a seven-month, 34-million-mile voyage.</p>

<p>The unmanned space probe took off aboard a Long March 5 Y-4 carrier rocket on July 23 from Wenchang Space Launch Centre on the southern island province of Hainan, China.</p>

<p>The craft, which consists of an orbiter, lander and rover, measures just over six feet in height (1.85m) and weighs 530 pounds (240kg).</p>

<p>It will survey the composition, types of substance, geological structure and meteorological environment of the Martian surface, and look for signs of alien life. </p>

<p>The launch of Tianwen-1 in July was sandwiched by the launch of two other missions to Mars by the US and the UAE. </p>

<p>There are three major missions bound for Mars in the space of just 10 days this month - the UAE's Hope orbiter, China's Tianwen-1 craft and NASA's Perseverance rover. </p>

<p>The countries are taking advantage of a period when Earth and Mars are favourably aligned for a relatively short journey.  </p>

<p>July 20: Hope (UAE)</p>

<p>The 3,000lb (1,350kg) craft (pictured) will complete one orbit every 55 hours for a total of one Martian year — 687 Earth days</p>

<p> - The 2,970-pound probe was built entirely within the Emirates, launched from Japan and will take seven months to reach the Red Planet. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the orbiter gets there in February 2021, it will stay in orbit for a whole Martian year – 687 days. </p></li>
<li><p>Hope will not land on the Martian surface but take readings from the Red Planet's atmosphere.  </p></li>
<li><p>Hope will help answer key questions about the Martian atmosphere and the loss of hydrogen and oxygen gases into space over the span of one Martian year – called a 'sol'. </p></li>
<li><p>Three instruments mounted on the probe will provide a picture of Mars's atmosphere throughout the year, and all of the data gathered will be made widely available. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>- This includes an infrared spectrometer to measure the lower atmosphere and temperature, a high-resolution imager to study the ozone and another to look at levels of hydrogen and oxygen up to 27,000 miles from the surface. </p>

<p>July 23: Tianwen-1</p>

<p>The Chinese space exploration authority introduced the nation's first Mars rover Tianwen-1 (pictured) at a grand ceremony earlier this month. The rover measures just over six feet in height</p>

<p> - This robotic spacecraft consists of an orbiter (stationed in the atmosphere), a lander (stationary on the planet's surface) and a rover (roaming the surface). </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The craft measures just over six feet in height (1.85m) and weighs 530 pounds (240kg). </p></li>
<li><p>It will survey the composition, types of substance, geological structure and meteorological environment of the Martian surface. </p></li>
<li><p>The solar-powered machine is designed to work on Mars for three Martian months, about 92 Earth days.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>- It includes a geological camera, a multispectral camera, a subsurface detection radar, a surface composition detector, a surface magnetic field detector and a weather detector.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A poem pondering on the stars and planets written over 2000 years ago was the inspiration for the name of China's first exploration mission to Mars. </p></li>
<li><p>Called Tianwen (天问), the poem was written by ancient Chinese literati and politician Qu Yuan (339-278BC), who lived in the Chu State (770-223BC). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>July 30: Perseverance</p>

<p>NASA's Mars 2020 Rover will pick up samples of rock and soil from the red planet, deposit them in tubes and leave them on the ground for a future mission to return them to Earth.</p>

<ul>
<li>NASA's Perseverance rover is the heaviest payload yet to go to the Red Planet - at a car-sized 2,259 pounds (1,025kg).  </li>
</ul>

<p>The mission will seek signs of past microbial life on Mars and collect rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth.   </p>

<p>- The Mars Perseverance rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a 'cache' on the surface of Mars. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The rover will travel using an ultraviolet laser to determine what minerals and compounds are present in the soil, based on the way the light scatters. </p></li>
<li><p>The Mars 2020 rover, which was built at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California., is now at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for final preparations. </p></li>
<li><p>It launches to space on July 30 and is set to touch down on Mars in 12 months. </p></li>
<li><p>It has a mission duration of 1 Mars year (668 sols or 687 Earth days) and will touch down on the planet's Jezero crater on Mars in February 2021.  </p></li>
