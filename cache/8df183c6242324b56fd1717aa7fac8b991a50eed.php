<p>Insisting she's not going down without a fight, TV star Emily said in a press release: 'Every time I've been on Juice in the past I've had such a good time, and now I'm doing it with two of my best mates and I'm a ruddy team captain!!! Can't believe it. </p>

<p>'I dread to think what we're going to be faced with, but Whitmore should know that I won't be backing down and she is going to have some tough competition. But more importantly a wonderfully hilarious time. Bring it on!'</p>

<p>Her new opponent jokingly hit back: 'I can't wait to see what Keith has got lined up for Emily and I this series… From past experiences, nothing would surprise me. I cannot wait to get stuck in and lead my team to victory each week… I love you Emily, but watch out! I'm so excited to start!</p>
