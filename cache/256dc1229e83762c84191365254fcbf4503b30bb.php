<p>British makeup expert Trinny Woodall's BFF Cream has been heralded as a 'game changer' and the 'ultimate skin protector' by women since it launched two years ago, and the SPF30 product is now so well-known that around 62,460 units sell every 24 hours.</p>

<p>The cream is different to other foundations and tinted moisturisers, insofar as it mimics your own skin tone to boost it and create a 'flawless, natural glow'.</p>

<p>'The light-reflecting extract of porcelain flower boosts radiance, tones down redness, and makes light work of dark circles,' the Trinny London website states.</p>

<p>At the same time, the SPF30 cream protects the skin from harmful UV rays.</p>

<p>There are currently five different shades available - from 'Lightest' to 'Dark', and to use the cream, you simply rub some on to your hands and then your face, as you would a moisturiser. </p>

<p>'This cream is perfect for my ageing self,' one woman wrote.</p>

<p>'I'm 70, and while I adore makeup, less is more and just a tiny bit is best. Trinny, you hit this one right out of the ballpark!'</p>

<p>Another fan said she 'just loves' the BFF cream.</p>

<p>'It smells lovely and glides over the face with ease,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'It has great sun protection too! It gives just the right amount of coverage for a very natural look.' </p>

<p>Further commenters said the cream has helped them with any redness on their skin.</p>

<p>Previously, Trinny shared the main makeup mistakes women make in Australia - and how to apply blusher to look younger in an instant. </p>

<p>The British TV star and makeup mogul, 55, said the main errors women make include not adjusting their makeup regime as they age and fashions change, applying blusher in the wrong place and choosing the wrong foundation shade for their skin tone. </p>

<p>'A lot of women have had bad skin in their teens and they get to their twenties and they're still over-powdering - they don't realise they don't need it,' Trinny said.</p>

<p>She recommends taking a look at your makeup collection every so often to decide whether it suits you. </p>

<p>At least once a decade is a good rule of thumb for a routine re-think.</p>

<p>The British TV star and makeup mogul (pictured), 55, said the main errors women make include not adjusting their makeup regime as they age and fashions change</p>

<p>The second mistake Trinny sees is women who pick the wrong foundation colour that doesn't match their skin tone or type.</p>

<p>She said the way to identify the ideal foundation for your skin tone lies with your skin's undertone and your veins.</p>

<p>If you have blue-hued veins, they you're probably cool-toned with foundations, whereas if they look more green, then you're more likely to be a warm skin tone.</p>

<p>Some people have a mix of both types of veins, meaning they are possibly a neutral.</p>

<p>Trinny (pictured) said she all too regularly sees women - and especially Australian women - apply their blusher in the wrong place</p>

<p>Thirdly, Trinny said she all too regularly sees women - and especially Australian women - apply their blusher in the wrong place.</p>

<p>'For me, blusher should sit quite close to your eye because it should bring out the colour of your eye,' Trinny said.</p>

<p>'It should sit where you naturally flush and shouldn't be some sort of mad statement on your face.'</p>

<p>Controversially, Trinny said you shouldn't smile when you put on your blusher, as while this is fine when you're smiling, often when you stop this means it sits too low on your face.</p>

<p>'Aim for that point where your cheek comes up to meet your eye,' Trinny added - saying that is the perfect spot to apply blusher.</p>
