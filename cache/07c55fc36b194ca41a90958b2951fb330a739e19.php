<p>An effective and affordable alternative to specialist equipment at the gym, a soft Pilates ball is perfect for home workouts. And it's sure to seriously up your training.</p>

<p>The ball is suited to a wide range of moves and exercises, but it's mainly used to target a specific area like your glutes, core or thighs. </p>

<p>One of the most common (and effective) moves is to place it between your thighs and ankles to help target and tone your legs and core. But there are plenty of tips and tricks online to help get you started. </p>

<p>The hit product, which now costs just £5.09, has had rave reviews from gym bunnies, yogi's and novices alike. </p>

<p>Many shoppers have admitted that they've noticed a difference from using the Beenax Soft Pilates Ball at home, and it's proved to be particularly popular over lockdown.  </p>

<p>'Great ball for working those stomach muscles' wrote one delighted shopper. 'Like this small ball. Really focuses your effort to specific places. Also helps with inner thighs from what I have done so far. Like this product, worth the money to help me tone.'</p>

<p>Another shopper also felt the burn, writing: 'I bought this product as part of the props for Zoom Pilates classes set up when my gym had to close. It arrived time. It was easy to inflate and seal. And it has been helping me out with leg and abdominal exercises. Your legs and bum work a lot harder if you are forced to clench a ball between your knees!'</p>

<p>The small exercise ball helps to improve stability, maximises strength and also strengthens the core muscles</p>

<p>One shopper has even used the soft Pilates ball as part of their postpartum recovery. They confessed: 'I have had complete abdominal muscle separation and was told Pilates was the best way to recover. </p>

<p>I had a 121 session and found the ball really helped me engage what little was left of my core! This ball is ideal for me to try exercises at home. It was very reasonably priced, good quality and easy to blow up.'</p>

<p>The non-burst, non-slip design makes it a super versatile and reliable bit of kit. It's also super easy to deflate and inflate so is ideal for taking with you to the gym, park or wherever you want to work out. </p>

<p>One shopper raved: 'This is pretty amazing as you can inflate it so easily and de inflate and pop it into the bag as it doesn't take space at all!!! You have no excuses to not work out as this can be taken anywhere. Excellent quality price.'</p>
