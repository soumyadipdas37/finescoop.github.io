<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Officers have revealed how baying crowds shouted 'light them up' after a man doused them in petrol - as shocking new footage of the incident emerged today.</p>

<p>The aerial footage, shot by a police helicopter, shows a grey-track-suited man running at a group of police officers while carrying a petrol can.</p>

<p>As he nears the officers, the man stops to throw fuel over the group before lobbing the can and running away.</p>

<p>Officers could reportedly hear the crowd saying 'who's got matches, who's got a lighter, let's set them on fire'.</p>

<p>The footage, taken during an incident in Basildon, Essex, in May 2019, has emerged as part of a new documentary released today.</p>

<p>Captured on a police body-cam and by helicopter Jackson (pictured) can be seen running up to a group of officers and covering them in fuel</p>

<p>Aired on BBC, the documentary, named Critical Incident, featured officers who looked back on what happened on that day, which with from a police chase.  </p>

<p>Officers on duty in Canvey Island were monitoring an organised event when they were made aware of a motorbike being ridden dangerously.</p>

<p>An eight-mile pursuit, involving a police helicopter, ensued, ending with police attempting to make the arrest of a youth at an estate in Basildon.</p>

<p>It was then the man, later named as Justin Jackson, then 28, attacked the officers with the petrol.</p>

<p>A large crowd of around 20 to 30 people gathered to watch the incident.</p>

<p>PC Andrew Bird, PC Matthew Cutts and Chief Inspector Jonathan Baldwin were all at the scene and have spoken openly about the events that unfolded that day. </p>

<p>Speaking during the documentary, one of the officers, PC Andrew Bird, said: 'As I was trying to control a gentleman who had run out of the middle of nowhere this other chap has appeared with a watering can.</p>

<p>Footage of the attack was also captured by police helicopter. Then yob flicks the noxious fluid into his face before being knocked over and running from the scene</p>

<p>Jackson attacked the officers as police tried to arrest a youth riding a stolen motorbike in Basildon, Essex</p>

<p>Aired today on BBC, a documentary, named Critical Incident, featured officers who looked back on what happened on that day, which with from a police chase (pictured)</p>

<p>His colleague, PC Matthew Cutts, stepped in to fend off the new attacker. </p>

<p>He said: 'I could smell petrol so I sort of fumbled around to get my baton out but once I've got it out I've put it behind my head and just struck him in line with my training.</p>

<p>'It's not a random act of violence, it's a controlled measure that we are taught to use to get people away from us.'</p>

<p>PC Cutts, who was unaware of the contents of the watering can, then started to feel his skin stinging and tingling down the front of his body.</p>

<p>Jackson (pictured) appeared in Basildon Crown Court last year, where he was jailed for three years and nine months for eight counts of administering a noxious substance with intent to injury, aggrieve or annoy</p>

<p>The team began to panic as some of the watching crowd were smoking.</p>

<p>The officers were also armed with tasers which could have sparked and set fire to the petrol.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Jonathan Baldwin said: 'I was hearing them shout 'light them up'.</p>

<p>'I don't know how we didn't just cut and run but then that's not the way we're wired - we all stuck together.</p>

<p>'There's something running in the core of us that says you don't run away from the danger, you run towards it.'</p>

<p>He added: 'One match, one lighter, one spark could result in us going up in flames and being disfigured for life or possibly even dead.'</p>

<p>A large back up team of around 90 officers raced to the scene and several people were arrested.</p>

<p>Jackson later appeared at Basildon Crown Court and pleaded guilty to eight counts of administering a noxious substance with intent to cause injury. </p>

<p>During the hearing, police body-cam footage showed Jackson chucking the petrol over the eight officers.</p>

<p>CI Baldwin, reading from his victim impact statement in court, said: 'At the time of the incident while being covered with petrol I remember thinking "we could all go up in flames here like Roman candles".' </p>

<p>He said he could not see if anyone was smoking in the vicinity, adding: 'It was one of those days I realised I might not have got home at all.'</p>

<p>'This was in my view a calculated attack carried out without regard for the lives of police officers, their loved ones and others who were nearby at the time,' he said.</p>

<p>He said that some people came out from their homes carrying kitchen pans full of water and inviting officers to use their sinks and showers to help them.</p>

<p>'These particular memories have helped me keep a tight grip on the hope that what some people did that day is not representative of the wider community,' said Mr Baldwin.</p>

<p>Judge Samantha Cohen, sentencing Jackson in November 2019, said it must have been a 'terrifying experience' for the police officers and found that Jackson did it to prevent them from making arrests.</p>

<p>She said: 'Initially some (of the officers) thought they were splashed with a disfiguring acid or bleach, but when they smelled it was petrol they feared they would be set alight.'</p>

<p>Judge Cohen praised the officers involved as a 'credit to their force'.</p>

<p>Jackson, of Ward Close, Basildon, was jailed for three years and nine months. </p>

<p>During the hearing the court heard he had written an apology to the officers and claimed her was 'just trying to defuse the situation.' </p>
