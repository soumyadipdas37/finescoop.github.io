<p>But Van Noy, who compared the virus to the flu, said in July: 'We at Candlelight are exercising our freedom, and the right to allow you as members, to come into the facilities without the obligation to observe the Panhandle Health District 'order.'</p>

<p>'Therefore, if you chose to wear a mask, physically distance, etc. we support your freedom to do so. If you choose to refrain from wearing a mask, etc. we likewise support your decision.' </p>

<p>Brenda said the experience had left her 'humbled', writing on September 4: 'I haven’t taken this Covid seriously enough. I’m humbled. I have Covid and some of my friends have Covid now but more seriously my husband is in critical care in ICU with Covid and it is serious. </p>

<p>'Please take this serious. Pray for healing. Love each other. Pray for those who have lost loved ones because of this EVIL virus!'</p>

<p>On August 22 she shared a picture of her wearing a Trump mask and cap, writing: 'I only wear it when I have to!'</p>

<p>But her husband pastor is said to have not changed his policy on masks and the church reopened on Sunday after a two week closure and deep clean. </p>

<p>In a statement Eric Reade, body ministry coordinator the church, told The Spokesman Review: 'The position is, if you feel comfortable wearing a mask, you can. If you're not comfortable wearing a mask, you don't have to.</p>

<p>'Nobody is going to be criticized for whatever decision they make.'</p>

<p>Van Noy said Monday: 'Having been in the ICU now for 11 days…and counting, I am really starting to turn the corner—for the better.'</p>

<p>On August 22 Brenda shared a picture of her wearing a Trump mask and cap, writing: 'I only wear it when I have to!'</p>

<p>He added: 'They tell me it will be a few more days in ICU and then I will move back to a regular room for a couple of days and then to recover at home. At present I feel ok but still need quite a bit of oxygen support—especially if and when I try to get up out of the bed.'  </p>

<p>At a vigil for Van Noy outside the hospital last week many of those in attendance did not wear masks. </p>

<p>Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, who is the founder of Turning Point USA, is set to speak in person at the church on September 27.  </p>
