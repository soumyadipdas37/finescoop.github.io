<p>Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, it won two Academy Awards for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction, as well as a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography. </p>

<p>'Geez. I thought only America couldn't come up with anything original anymore so keeps on doing remakes. Why mess with perfection,' said one. </p>

<p>'The original was vivid with depth. This looks drab and shallow,' said another. </p>

<p>While some said they were excited to view the new three-part BBC series, others said they doubted it would rival the original movie from 1947</p>

<p>'Already been done - 70 years too late,' wrote one.  'Good luck trying to outdo Powell and Pressburger,' said another. </p>

<p>However, others shared their excitement for the December premiere. </p>

<p>'I have seriously waited for this! The original is stellar and this casting is superb! Cannot wait to watch it,' said one. 'I know I’ll be watching! Loved the Deborah Kerr film,' said another. </p>
