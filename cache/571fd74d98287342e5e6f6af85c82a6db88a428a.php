<p>The 50-year-old paedophile, who can't be named to protect his daughter, forced the young girl to masturbate him in the shower with soap about 200 times.  </p>

<p>The Queensland girl was objected to the horrifying abuse until just before her tenth birthday when her mother discovered what was happening.</p>

<p>The court heard the man told his daughter it was 'a secret and not to tell her mother,' Townsville Bulletin reported. </p>

<p>Prosecutor Amanda Payne told the court the father would threaten his child if she refused - and even offered her money on one occasion.</p>

<p>The man was arrested by police after the child's mother found out what was happening. </p>

<p>He initially claimed his child instigated what happened in the shower but changed his story and admitted he asked her to 'wash his penis'.  </p>

<p>One of the five charges he pleaded guilty to was maintaining an unlawful relationship with a child. </p>

<p>The man's defence lawyer told the court the man suffered from a range of health issues and had no use of his left arm.</p>

<p>Judge Julie Dick SC said the man 'indulged' himself and used his daughter for his own 'pleasure'.</p>

<p>'You have betrayed your trust to her in a very, very severe way and over a lengthy period of time,' she said.</p>

<p>'You are the natural father and that usually means you naturally protect your child and you didn't, you took advantage of her.'</p>

<p>The man was jailed for three years - with a parole date set for September 28, 2021. </p>
