<p>According to NewJersey.com, LiBassi has been confined to a wheelchair since 1996, when he suffered a spinal cord injury. He has been serving as Mayor of Rochelle Park since 2018. </p>

<p>In their censuring of Boniface, the Rochelle Park Committee declared that she failed to failed to 'conform to a high level of personal, moral and ethical conduct, especially while performing the duties and responsibilities of their elected position'.</p>

<p>Boniface has denied making the comments. </p>

<p>However,  Michael Kazimir - the Republican committee member who voted to censure Boniface - alleges she has a history of making offensive comments. </p>

<p>Kazimir claims that Boniface called former committee member Frank Valenzuela 'a cripple.'</p>

<p>Valenzuela suffers from multiple sclerosis and moves with some degree of difficulty. </p>

<p>Boniface has also been accused of calling former committee member Frank Valenzuela (right)  'a cripple'</p>

<p>Kazimir claims he heard Boniface whisper 'Let's hear what the cripple has to say' as Valenzuela approached the microphone to speak at a separate local meeting. </p>

<p>It's not the first time Boniface has hit headlines. </p>

<p>Last month, the local politician filed a lawsuit against the township’s Office of Emergency Management coordinator, Peter Donatello, claiming he tried to run her over with his car. </p>

<p>The pair had reportedly become embroiled in a spat, with Donatello allegedly accusing Boniface of leaking embarrassing photos of Donatello's son - who is not Jewish - wearing a yarmulke. </p>

<p>NorthJersey.com reported that, prior to that incident, the pair had quarreled with each other frequently, although it's unclear what their arguments stemmed from.</p>

<p>Boniface's lawsuit claims that the car incident left her 'emotionally and psychologically traumatized' and exacerbated a 'pre-existing psychological condition' she has, although it's unclear what the condition is.</p>

<p>The lawsuit is asking for unspecified damages and court costs. </p>
