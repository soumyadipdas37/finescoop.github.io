<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A predator who posed as a taxi driver to prey on drunk women before sexually assaulting them in his car, has been jailed for 30 months. </p>

<p>Atila Ardic, 25, was disqualified and had hired a car from an online rental service by posing as his mother in order to carry out his fantasies.</p>

<p>He attacked his first victim after picking her up as she drunkenly tried to hail an Uber home from a Christmas party in Covent Garden on 8 December, 2017.</p>

<p>She woke up in the backseat to find Ardic forcing himself on her before she fled to her home, where her boyfriend found her bruised and crying.</p>

<p>Ardic drove to a garage immediately after and helped himself to a packet of cigarettes using the victim’s card, which she had dropped in her hurry to escape.</p>

<p>He struck again the following evening, preying upon another woman on her way home from a party who fell asleep before waking to find his hand under her clothing.</p>

<p>He hurled abuse at the victim as she broke free, calling her a ‘f<strong><em>ing b</em></strong>h’ before she escaped and reported the ordeal to police.</p>

<p>Atila Ardic, a sexual predator who posed as a mini cab driver to carry out two sexual assaults on vulnerable women who were on nights out, has now been jailed for two and a half years </p>

<p>December 8, 2017: He picks up first victim in Covent Garden before attacking her in a secluded area near Waterloo</p>

<p>When he was arrested Ardic had ‘fake taxi driver’ porn on his phone and had been looking at the films before he attacked women.</p>

<p>Ardic claimed he had carried out the abuse because of ‘feelings of inadequacy’ about not having a girlfriend, Wood Green Crown Court heard.     </p>

<p>Judge John Dodd QC said  the first victim believed Ardic had been trying to rape her.</p>

<p>He added: ‘The facts are deeply concerning frankly.  </p>

<p>‘[The first victim] fell asleep and woke to find you in the backseat with her trying to sexually assault her.</p>

<p>‘This was a sexual assault that came to an end only because she was able to fight you off.</p>

<p>‘This must have been terrifying. She didn’t start the evening in an injured state and by the time it came to an end she had bruising.</p>

<p>‘She dropped her purse. You remarkably having conceded defeat, drove off immediately to a garage and at her expense bought a package of cigarettes and then drove home.’ </p>

<p>Judge Dodd went on: ‘You didn’t stop there. The following day you did exactly the same thing cruising the streets looking for [the next] victim... who fell into your grasp.</p>

<p>‘The only reason you were out in the small hours of the morning was to find suitable victims.</p>

<p>‘There was abuse of trust - both of these women believed they were getting into legitimate cabs.</p>

<p>‘You effectively took these girls to assault them from a public place. You had been looking on your phone at porn sites and porn films focusing on this particular genre of the fake cab driver assaulting women.</p>

<p>‘The whole gravity of this case is that you were masquerading as a cab driver assaulting vulnerable women.’</p>

<p>Ardic told Wood Green Crown Court he carried out attacks because of ‘feelings of inadequacy’</p>

<p>Ardic, from Finsbury Park, admitted two counts of sexual assault and theft and fraud by false representation in relation to stealing the first woman’s purse.</p>

<p>He shut his eyes as he was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for the ‘absolutely horrible’ offences. </p>

<p>He was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment and placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register. </p>
