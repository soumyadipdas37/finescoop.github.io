<p>Frank Lampard is looking to offload players who are surplus to requirements and the 26-year-old has not featured for the Blues since 2018 after loan spells at AC Milan and Monaco.</p>

<p>According to Goal, Milan were hopeful of agreeing a permanent deal for Bakayoko but have been frustrated by Chelsea's asking price, with PSG now the front-runners to complete a move.</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain are in talks to seal a loan move for Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko</p>

<p>Frank Lampard is looking to offload players surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge</p>

<p>The report claims PSG's sporting director Leonardo is leading the discussions with Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia with the deal set to be a season-long loan with an obligation-to-buy.</p>

<p>The Blues may be open to a £2.75million loan fee but would prefer to sell the midfielder permanently. </p>

<p>PSG are also linked with Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger but was in no mood to give anything away when asked about the speculation last week. </p>

<p>Bakayoko has not played for the Blues since 2018 after loan spells at AC Milan and Monaco</p>

<p>'I don't like to comment on rumours. These players belong to other clubs and we have to respect that. There's no point in talking about those two names.</p>

<p>'I can only say that the club knows my opinion. They know my analysis and that of my staff. I wait. </p>

<p>'The transfer window is not over. The situation is not easy, but we still have a little bit of time.'</p>

<p>Bakayoko was signed by Antonio Conte in 2017 but struggled to adapt to English football, despite making 43 appearances in his first season. </p>

<p>Maruizio Sarri decided the midfielder was not part of his plans and Milan paid £4.5m to take the him on loan for the 2018-2019 season but didn't trigger the option to secure a permanent deal for £32m.</p>

<p>Ross Barkley has joined Aston Villa on loan and Ruben Loftus-Cheek could also secure a temporary switch away from Stamford Bridge after being left out of Lampard's last four squads.</p>
