<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hundreds of schools and colleges are reporting delays in getting Covid-19 tests.</p>

<p>A head teachers' union said the Government's failure to provide the promised access to testing is threatening to derail the full reopening of schools.</p>

<p>More than 200 members of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) yesterday reported difficulties with the test and trace system. </p>

<p>Some schools have been told their 'nearest' testing centre is hundreds of miles away, with one pupil reportedly told to make a 1,100-mile trip.</p>

<p>While the number of schools experiencing problems is a small percentage of those open in England, ASCL said it means thousands of children and teachers are unable to come in for classes.</p>

<p>One school leader said: 'I have approximately ten pupils who are at home with symptoms all of whom are waiting for tests.</p>

<p>'Potentially I could have a number of positive cases linked to my school and not know it.'</p>

<p>Schools and colleges – often with more than 1,000 students and staff – have received a Government supply of just ten home-testing kits. These must be offered in the 'exceptional circumstances where an individual may have barriers to accessing testing elsewhere'.</p>

<p>ASCL said these tests are 'rapidly being depleted'.</p>

<p>Yesterday Health Secretary Matt Hancock claimed 'whole schools' had been attempting to secure Covid testing. </p>

<p>'We've had whole schools saying that they want to come forward for testing and sending all the pupils for testing – this is not appropriate,' he told Nick Ferrari's LBC radio show.</p>

<p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL, said: 'We are very concerned that the fantastic work of schools and colleges in putting in place a raft of safety measures in order to fully reopen for the autumn term is at risk of being derailed by a lack of capacity in the test and trace system.' </p>
