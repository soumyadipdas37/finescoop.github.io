<p>The latest: Lauren Burnham, 28, said she and husband Arie Luyendyk Jr., 38, have been 'trying for a couple of months' to conceive after suffering a miscarriage three months ago</p>

<p>'We have been trying for a couple of months,' Burnham said. 'I know it’s not been long yet, but since our miscarriage we’ve wanted another baby so bad.'</p>

<p>The Virginia native, who's mom to daughter Alessi, one, with Luyendyk, said she's been 'sad &amp; discouraged the last couple of months' because 'of it,' but is 'trying to stay positive.'</p>

<p>Burnham took a longview approach toward the life issue, saying that 'it will happen when it’s our time.'</p>

<p>Burnham opened up to Us last month about their focus on conceiving, saying that she and the race car driver were in their second month of trying.</p>

<p>Parenthood: The Virginia native, who's mom to daughter Alessi, one, with Luyendyk. The couple was snapped in NYC in 2018</p>

<p>Happy pair: The Bachelor duo was seen relaxing earlier this year on a livestream</p>

<p>She said, 'I was always afraid that it wouldn’t work. I think that’s kind of a valid fear if you’ve gone through something like that or just a fear of having to go through it again.'</p>

<p>She told the publication that she was 'honestly scared' but didn't let it deter her from trying to expand her family.</p>

<p>'Sometimes I’m like, "OK, yes, we can do this. It’s going to be great. Alessi needs a playmate,"' she said. 'And then other times, I’m sitting there, like, "Oh my gosh, how am I ever going to manage doing everything I’m doing now with another baby?" </p>

<p>'So I think I just have to jump in head first!'</p>

<p>Burnham, who exchanged vows with Luyendyk in January of 2019, told the outlet that she thinks she's 'in a place of peace with it' as she moves forward with optimism.</p>

<p>'I feel positive about the future, and I always want to be open with everyone and I think that by doing that, you can help a lot of people,' Burnham said. 'And I don’t think it’s something that should be taboo and people should be afraid to talk about. So I always try and make an effort to talk about the uncomfortable thing.'</p>
