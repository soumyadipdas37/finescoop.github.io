<p>According to documents obtained by TMZ, a company called K&amp;K Promotions, whose president happens to be Evel's son Kelly, 'claims they own all the rights to Evel Knievel's likeness, persona, and brand.'</p>

<p>They also claimed that Disney 'did NOT get any type of approval' from K&amp;K Promotions to use Knievel as inspiration. </p>

<p>Uh oh: Disney, Pixar, and their subsidiaries are being sued for allegedly basing the Toy Story 4 character Duke Caboom off of legendary stunt performer Evel Knievel; Duke Caboom in Toy Story 4</p>

<p>K&amp;K Promotions stated in their lawsuit that Knievel's recognizable persona and legacy, including 'a nod to his famous stunt cycle toy from the '70s,' is littered throughout the fourth Toy Story installment.  </p>

<p>Duke Caboom, who is voiced by actor Keanu Reeves, is meant to be a toy version of 'the greatest Canadian stuntman' and, similar to that of the old school Evel Knievel toys, he 'comes with an energizer to wind up and release his bike.' </p>

<p>K&amp;K Promotions also alleged that higher ups at Disney 'instructed' everyone involved in Toy Story 4, from the all-star cast to the post-production crew, to 'avoid using Evel's name during interviews, as well as other trademarked items.' </p>

<p>They believe that Disney attempted to pull a similar stunt with the Toy Story character Forky, who, despite his name, closely resembles a Spork.</p>

<p> No permission: They also claimed that Disney 'did NOT get any type of approval' from K&amp;K Promotions to use Knievel as inspiration; Evel pictured in 1975</p>

<p>K&amp;K Promotions described an interview where Forky voice actor Tony Hale appeared to be 'performing mental gymnastics' as he attempted to avoid addressing Forky's likeness to the quirky utensil.  </p>

<p>Another aspect of the lawsuit pertains to the ungodly amount of Toy Story 4 merchandise that was produced by Disney and featured Duke Caboom's image.</p>

<p>K&amp;K Promotions said that Disney made a startling amount of money off of the merchandise and that they are 'asking a judge for big-time damages.'</p>

<p>All throughout: K&amp;K Promotions stated in their lawsuit that Knievel's recognizable persona and legacy, including 'a nod to his famous stunt cycle toy from the '70s,' is littered throughout the fourth Toy Story installment</p>

<p>Toy Story 4 hit theaters in June of 2019 and raked in $1.073billion at the worldwide box office, making it the highest grossing film of the franchise.</p>

<p>Evil Knievel, who was often seen donning his signature red, white, and blue jumpsuit, rose to prominence in the late 1960s as an entertainer and renown daredevil.</p>

<p>He would attract audiences from around the globe as he attempted to soar over lines of parked cars on his trust motorcycle.</p>

<p>Most famously, Knievel attempted to soar '151 feet over the fountains of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas' on his motorcycle in 1967. </p>

<p>Merchandise: K&amp;K Promotions said that Disney made a startling amount of money off of the merchandise and that they are 'asking a judge for big-time damages'</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, he crashed and garnered significant injuries from the stunt, including a crushed pelvis and femur and a major concussion.</p>

<p>He retired from the extreme stunt word in 1980, but his legacy lived on through show footage and his highly sought after merchandise. </p>

<p>According to the New York Times, Evel Knievel toy 'had sales in the hundreds of millions for Ideal and other companies' in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

<p>He passed away at the age of 69 on November 30, 2007.</p>
