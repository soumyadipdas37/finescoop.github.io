<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When it comes to eating and drinking, we are oddly snobby about so many things.</p>

<p>Instant coffee, margarine, salad cream, paper napkins, ketchup bottles on the table — all are regarded with disdain. I can still recall the disgust on one date’s face when I added ice cubes to my glass of Chablis.</p>

<p>But one thing people are extra-snooty about is the time we eat in the evening, especially when dining out.</p>

<p>Moot the idea of an ‘early bird’ dinner at 6pm to friends and you may well be greeted with horror, as if you had suggested all going to naked yoga.</p>

<p>Claudia Connell says she could not be happier about the latest 10pm curfew and described having to wait eight hours between lunch and dinner as 'torture'</p>

<p>The ideal middle-class restaurant eating time is 8pm — or 9pm if you’re feeling really European. </p>

<p>If you can eat dinner at 6pm, then presumably you don’t have an important job and aren’t cramming in spin classes and Pilates after work.</p>

<p>But now, thanks to the 10pm curfew, eating at 6pm will be more commonplace and I couldn’t be happier.</p>

<p>Most people eat lunch between 1pm and 2pm (midday is the lunchtime equivalent of 6pm), so waiting eight hours until you eat again is torture.</p>

<p>For me, it leads to snacking on sugary foods at about 4pm, to stave off hunger until I meet my friends at the local Italian at 9pm.</p>

<p>The meal finishes at about 11.30pm, meaning it’s straight home to bed, your stomach still groaning from all the pasta and tiramisu.</p>

<p>So an early bird special? Bring it on!</p>

<p>I can eat my dinner, enjoy the company of my friends and still be home in time to watch the 9pm TV drama in my PJs. I can also down half a bottle of wine and have enough time to drink lots of water before bed.</p>

<p>I have a feeling we will all secretly grow to love the joy of six.</p>
