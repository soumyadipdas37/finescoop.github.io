<p>OnlyFans! Chris Robshaw and his wife Camilla Kerslake have joined OnlyFans (pictured in 2019) </p>

<p>Chris will offer workouts he has used to help him in his sporting career as well as nutritional advice. </p>

<p>While Camilla, who has had a successful music career, will offer fans musical masterclasses on opera singing.</p>

<p>The singer was signed to Gary Barlow's record label in 2009 and her rendition of hymn, How Can I Keep from Singing?, was used in a Waitrose advert later that year.</p>

<p>Camilla has since performed with Andrea Bocelli and appeared in various West End productions.  </p>

<p>Following the trend: The rugby star, 34, and the classical crossover singer, 32, pictured in June, have followed the likes of Kerry Katona, Bella Thorne and Cardi B in signing up to the X-rated subscription site</p>

<p>While Chris is a rugby union player for Harlequins and was formerly the captain of the England national rugby union team.   </p>

<p>Talking about their new venture, Chris said: 'I've dedicated my life to sports and fitness. </p>

<p>'I'm thrilled to have a platform where I can share everything I've learnt over the years and give exclusive content to anyone looking to get in shape or stay in shape.'</p>

<p>While Camilla added: 'Music and singing have been my passion ever since I can remember. </p>

<p>No racy content here! Yet despite OnlyFans often associated with sex work - it allows public figures to charge money for racy exclusives, Chris will be focusing on fitness content and Camilla music (pictured in July) </p>

<p>'I'm excited to use this platform to give exclusive access to my latest work and help anyone looking for support and inspiration.'</p>

<p>Elsewhere, it's an exciting year for Camilla as she is also set to appear in a wrestling-themed production at the Cockpit Theatre and then the Playground Theatre in London this month.   </p>

<p>Bread And Circuses is described as 'a mash-up between World Wrestling Entertainment, verismo opera, and 1990s-style video-gaming'. Owing to Covid-19 restrictions, performances run for just 20 minutes.  </p>

<p>Camilla and Chris married in 2018, prior to this, they decided to keep their engagement tightly under wraps for an impressive two years, finally breaking the news at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships.</p>

<p>'We wanted to choose the right moment to announce our engagement,' Camilla told HELLO! magazine in October 2017.</p>

<p>'It wouldn’t have been appropriate when Chris was playing at the World Cup or I was making an album.</p>

<p>'And I certainly didn’t want it to come out through someone spotting me wearing my ring when I was taking out the bins, shopping at Tesco’s or looking shiny at the gym.' </p>

<p>The Camilla and Chris love story goes all the way back until 2011 when sparks first started flying between the duo.</p>

<p>'My manager who was with me said I shouldn't give it to him,' Camilla confessed to The Mail On Sunday. 'I said, "Of course I will. Just look at him, he's gorgeous." But it took a month before we met. We decided to be monogamous straight away.'</p>

<p>They tied the knot in a romantic ceremony in Provence, France, last year, after keeping their engagement secret for two years, and finally breaking the news at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in July.</p>

<p>Talking about the moment his beloved walked down the aisle, Chris told HELLO! magazine: 'I watched her the whole way. She looked so beautiful; I felt proud and emotional.' </p>
