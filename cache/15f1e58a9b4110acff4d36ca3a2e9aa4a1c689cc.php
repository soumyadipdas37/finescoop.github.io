<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ivan Rakitic is set to become the first big name player to leave Barcelona this summer and will re-sign for old club Sevilla.</p>

<p>The Croatian was one of several Barca stars who were told they were not part of new manager Ronald Koeman's plans moving forward at the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>The midfielder has agreed a two-year deal with Sevilla, with an option for a third, and will take a significant pay cut as a result, according to Goal.</p>

<p>Ivan Rakitic is set to leave Barcelona this summer and will re-sign for old club Sevilla</p>

<p>Rakitic was one of the Barca stars told they were not part of new boss Ronald Koeman's plans</p>

<p>Rakitic will earn £2.7million-per-year at Sevilla which is a huge decrease from the £7million he earned during his last season with Barcelona.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old spent three seasons with Sevilla and won the Europa League in the 2013/14 season right before he made his big switch to the Catalan club in 2014.</p>

<p>His return has been agreed in principle by the two clubs, who have agreed a nominal fee for now.</p>

<p>Rakitic has been one of the few Barcelona stars who have been linked with moves away for quite some time. The midfielder was attracting interest from Serie A clubs back in January, as well as being linked with Manchester United, but no move was finalised.</p>

<p>The midfielder has agreed a two-year deal with Sevilla and will take a huge £4m pay cut</p>

<p>Whilst he has always spoken on his love for Sevilla, he had said earlier in the transfer window that he would remain at Barca for one more season to see out his contract.</p>

<p>However, new boss Koeman has had other plans as the LaLiga giants have descended into chaos over recent weeks with Luis Suarez, Arturo Vidal and others all told they are no longer wanted.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi has also not been reporting to training and testing as his feud with Koeman rumbles on amid rumours of a staggering transfer to Manchester City.</p>

<p>Sevilla have also managed to get business done elsewhere, as they confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Yassine Bono on a permanent basis from Girona for £3.6million.</p>
