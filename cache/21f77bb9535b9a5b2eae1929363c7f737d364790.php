<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain could see 'one last blast of summer' next week as temperatures could hit 88F (31C) by next week after tropical continental air sends the mercury soaring from this weekend.</p>

<p>The mercury could top out in parts of southern England next Tuesday, but not before some of Scotland will be hit by torrential downpours that could bring almost a month's worth of rain in just one day.</p>

<p>The 'tropical continental air pushing up from a southerly direction in combination with light winds' will see temperatures up to 77F (25C) on Sunday and then 84F (29C) by Monday, according to Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond.</p>

<p>The top temperatures expected on Tuesday could remain on Wednesday, but there is the possibility of some thunderstorms mixed in. </p>

<p>Britons are set to make the most of the weekend's weather, with it being the last time large groups will be allowed to socialise before new Covid-19 restrictions are introduced. </p>

<p>'It's definitely feels like one last blast of summer even though we are, meteorologically speaking, in autumn,' she added.</p>

<p>The September warmth follows on from an August heatwave which saw temperatures hit 93F (34C) for six days running last month.</p>

<p>The highest temperature ever recorded in September was 96.08F (35.6C) on September 2, 1906, but they 'don't look like they're going to come anywhere close to that in this current hot spell', the forecaster said.</p>

<p>The warmest September day of recent years was September 13, 2016, when 93.9F (34.4C) was recorded at Gravesend, Kent - the warmest day of that year.</p>

<p>After a sunny Saturday across the nation, the evening will bring the wet weather to parts of western and north western Scotland 'for what looks like at least 24 hours'.</p>

<p>A yellow weather warning is in force for the region through Saturday and Sunday, advising that there could be floods and communities cut off as 150mm of rainfall is expected.</p>

<p>The average total rain for the region in September is 155.9mm.</p>

<p>South of the border, Ms Diamond described the weekend's weather as 'pretty decent' with 'high pressure in charge'.</p>

<p>Yet local MPs and police appear to be welcoming holidaymakers, with calls for people to be vigilant and stick to social distancing rules.</p>

<p>MP for East Devon Simon Jupp previously told MailOnline: 'I'm really encouraged by the continued low level of cases of coronavirus in Devon and the South West, despite the number of visitors which provided a much-needed cash-flow into our economy.</p>

<p>'It's still as critical as ever that people take personal responsibility to keep themselves and each other safe – hand washing, covering your face in certain indoor settings, and getting a test if you've got symptoms. </p>

<p>'The new restrictions are easier to understand and easier to enforce. We should all play our part to help beat the virus.' </p>

<p>MP for North Devon Selaine Saxby added: 'Cases remain low in North Devon this week, and our tourism and hospitality businesses are looking forward to seeing visitors as they have since lockdown eased.</p>

<p>'The vast majority of our visitors have been very compliant with the guidelines. Outdoors transmission remains low, and most travel to my constituency to enjoy the great outdoors.'</p>

<p>Gatherings of more than six people either indoors and outdoors, at home or in a pub will be illegal in England from Monday. A single household or support bubble that is larger than six will still be able to gather.</p>

<p>Covid-secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality settings can still hold more than six in total. </p>

<p>Education and work settings are not affected by the new rules. Weddings and funerals can also still go ahead with a limit of 30 people if conducted in a Covid-secure way.</p>
