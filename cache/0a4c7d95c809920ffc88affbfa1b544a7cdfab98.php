<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Australians are enjoying a normal life with little to no coronavirus restrictions thanks to the state's ongoing hard border. </p>

<p>One young Perth woman posted a video of a packed crowd at Metropolis nightclub in Fremantle to TikTok on Saturday, boasting about the city's nightlife. </p>

<p>The video montage showed revellers dancing at a Teletubby-themed rave, Hannah enjoying some drinks and finishing the night off with a Halal Snack Pack. </p>

<p>'And that’s on Perth having no restrictions and no COVID cases,' she captioned the post, which is not entirely true. </p>

<p>A man in his 60s tested positive to COVID-19 and is in hotel quarantine after returning to Perth on Monday. WA has only four active cases.  </p>

<p>WA venues still have gathering limits requiring them to provide two square metres per patron but they do not have patron registers or require people to sit down. </p>

<p>Jealous Melburnians and Sydneysiders flooded the comment section, wishing their respective cities could return to the vibrant nightlife of old. </p>

<p>'Cries in Victorian,' one woman commented. </p>

<p>'Never thought I'd be jealous of Perth,' a Sydney man commented.  </p>

<p>'Counting the days down to sit on a Revs couch,' a Victorian man said, referencing the popular club Revolver on Melbourne's Chapel Street. </p>

<p>One woman wrote: 'Adelaide's got no cases and we still have to sit down in town.' </p>

<p>Even people in the US were envious, with one writing: 'America could never.' </p>

<p>The video montage showed revellers dancing at a Teletubby-themed rave (pictured), Hannah enjoying some drinks and finishing the night off with a Halal Snack Pack</p>

<p>Social media posts from Perth's nightclub district Northbridge show glamorous revellers drinking, dancing and hooking up with no social distancing in sight. </p>

<p>WA dropped most of its restrictions on June 27,  removing existing gathering limits except for the two-square-metre rule. </p>

<p>Events and unseated performances except for festivals became permitted, while alcohol could also be served unseated and casinos could reopen with restrictions. </p>

<p>WA Premier Mark McGowan is adamant that his state's hard border will remain in place despite pressure from Prime Minister Scott Morrison to reopen. </p>

<p>By stark contrast, Melbourne is still in the middle of a Stage Four Lockdown, meaning that all hospitality venues are closed, even for seated service. </p>

<p>People can only leave their homes for permitted work, essential shopping and exercise while a curfew bans people from leaving their houses from 8pm to 5am. </p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews revealed his 'roadmap to recovery' on Sunday, saying that Melbourne's Stage Four restrictions will last another two weeks and the city's lockdown won't be fully lifted until November 23.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sydneysiders are enjoying a middle ground between Perth's almost-complete reopening and Melbourne's total lockdown. </p>

<p>Music festivals are not permitted and nightclubs are closed but cafés, restaurants, pubs and bars are allowed to operate with one patron per four square metres or a maximum of 300 patrons, which ever is lesser. </p>

<p>Customers can only drink when seated and can only sit in a maximum group of 10 whiles standing, dancing and mingling with other groups is forbidden. </p>

<p>Many venues also require people to scan QR codes with their phones to view the menu and order drinks, completely eliminating the need to walk to the bar. </p>

<p>Security guards and COVID marshalls have the right to kick people out of bars for breaking restrictions by unnecessarily standing or dancing. </p>
