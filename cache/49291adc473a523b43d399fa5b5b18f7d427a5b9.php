<p>The TV presenter, 58, who rather fittingly is an ambassador for car buying website We Buy Any Car, was clad in shorts and a T-shirt as he joined the street in gathering to check all was safe after the unfortunate incident. </p>

<p>He gesticulated dramatically during the chat with his neighbours, which saw a host of residents from the road gathering for inspection.  </p>

<p>Checking it out: Phillip Schofield was on hand to assist his new neighbours on Friday, when a tree fell on their car near his £2million bachelor pad in Chiswick, west London</p>

<p>Phillip has clearly slotted into the neighbourhood nicely as she chatted amiably to his new neighbours while helping assess what was going on.</p>

<p>Going for pure comfort, he sported a white tee with loose-fitting bottoms while his trademark silver do' was slightly more mussed than usual.  </p>

<p>The unfortunate incident comes days after it was revealed that Phillip had moved into a large semi-detached house in west London.</p>

<p>His new house, just a stone's throw from the River Thames, is close to ITV colleague Declan Donnelly’s abode and Ant McPartlin's former home with Lisa Armstrong. </p>

<p>Unfortunate: The unfortunate incident comes days after it was revealed that Phillip had moved into a large semi-detached house in west London</p>

<p>His job: Phillip is an ambassador for We Buy Any Car </p>

<p>Neighbours told MailOnline that they had regularly seen the presenter around the area since moving in around two weeks ago. He has also been frequenting pubs along the River Thames, which just lies a short distance from his new home.</p>

<p>Locals said that Schofield is seen more on foot or bike than in his luxury Jaguar sports car which has a private number plate and is parked on the forecourt of his new home.</p>

<p>One neighbour said: ‘It’s caused quite a stir since he’s moved in and got people very excited. He seems like a very nice man and quite normal. You see him walking or cycling mainly and he smiles every time he goes past.’</p>

<p>Another neighbour added: ‘There’s quite a few famous people already living around here so Phillip Schofield moving in is not a big deal.</p>

<p>'A lot of people have been talking about it, but nobody bothers him. He’s a lovely bloke and I’m sure he’ll enjoy living in our community.'</p>

<p>New kid on the block: Another neighbour added: ‘There’s quite a few famous people already living around here so Phillip Schofield moving in is not a big deal</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it's been reported that the TV personality is planning an 'amicable' divorce from his wife Stephanie, where he will share his £9million fortune.</p>

<p>The TV star apparently wants to avoid a bitter showdown like his friend Ant McPartlin, who divorced his wife of 12 years Lisa Armstrong earlier this year.</p>

<p>Unlike Ant and Lisa, Phil is believed to be against signing non-disclosure agreements and only expects his wife's 'ongoing loyalty' during the process.  </p>

<p>Plans: Phil reportedly has no plans to move on with anyone else and is against a costly divorce battle – especially with his earnings at an 'all time high'. Pictured with family in 2018</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Phillip and Steph have had a lot of hard, painful conversations over the past ten months but remain as tight and devoted to one another as ever.  </p>

<p>Phil reportedly has no plans to move on with anyone else and is against a costly divorce battle - especially with his earnings at an 'all time high'.</p>

<p>The source added: 'Steph is entitled to half. He is not disputing this — all he wants in return is her ongoing loyalty . . . and discretion, his family is his No1 priority and that will never change.'</p>

<p>Last week it was reported that Phil's wealth has increased by £800,000 and as director of his company Fistral Productions, Steph will be entitled to some of it.</p>

<p>He recently inked a £60,000 deal to become the face of a gin advent calendar and has long-running deals with Waitrose, We Buy Any Car and Princess Cruises.</p>

<p>Although they have reportedly discussed divorce, it doesn't seem like Phil is going far judging by apparent plans to convert a garage at his £2.6m family home into a two-bedroom bachelor pad.</p>

<p>He was thought to have moved out of his Oxfordshire mansion earlier this year, however he later suggested he'd spent lockdown at the spacious abode.</p>
