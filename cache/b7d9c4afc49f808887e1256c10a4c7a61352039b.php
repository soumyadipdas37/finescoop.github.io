<p>The ploy urges people to hand over their credit card details - threatening taxpayers with arrest if they don't comply.</p>

<p>'Attention: this call is from the legal department of Services Australia,' the message says.</p>

<p>'Your Tax File Identification Number has been suspended and we have filed a case under your name. </p>

<p>'So, before this matter goes to Federal Court and you could get arrested kindly press 1. I repeat press 1 to know about your legal case.' </p>

<p>'Scammers pretending to be from the ATO are contacting members of the community, telling them that they have a tax debt and that if they don't pay it straight away they will be arrested,' they said.</p>

<p>'These scammers will often request payment through unusual methods, such as cryptocurrency, pre-paid credit cards or gift cards, and will try to keep people on the line until they have paid.'</p>

<p>They urged anyone who received a phone call, text message or voicemail demanding money not to send a payment or provide personal information.  </p>

<p>'We will never threaten you with immediate arrest or demand payment through unusual means.'</p>
