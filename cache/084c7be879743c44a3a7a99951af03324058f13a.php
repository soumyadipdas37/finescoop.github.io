<p>The Colombian star was pictured in London with a fan at swanky Mayfair restaurant Babbo, which is owned by Arsenal stars David Luiz and Willian, late on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Rodriguez, 29, is expected to travel to Merseyside on Thursday morning to complete his transfer.</p>

<p>James Rodriguez has been spotted in London after flying to seal his move to Everton</p>

<p>Everton were working hard on the details earlier this week and are expected to announce the arrival of Rodriguez on a three-year contract in the coming days.</p>

<p>Rodriguez will be joined by midfielder Allan from Napoli, who is joining for around £21million and also flew in on Wednesday to conclude his move.</p>

<p>The attacking midfielder, who joined Real Madrid in 2014 from Monaco, has struggled to convince at the Bernabeu, having been sent out on loan for two seasons to Bayern Munich in 2017. </p>

<p>Despite being handed chances to impress by Zinedine Zidane, it is now clear his future remains away from the LaLiga champions, and Goodison Park could prove his next destination. </p>

<p>Everton expect to confirm the capture of the Real Madrid midfielder in the coming days</p>

<p>Carlo Ancelotti is overseeing a significant rebuild at Everton as the club improve their midfield</p>

<p>It follows the news earlier this week that the Toffees had been handed the chance to sign the 29-year-old, who has just one year left on his current deal at the Bernabeu. </p>

<p>Rodriguez has played under current Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti at both Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, with a strong working relationship previously appearing to hold a great deal of weight for the Colombian.</p>

<p>Everton, meanwhile, have also reached a £20m agreement with Watford to sign Abdoulaye Doucoure.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands the midfielder will travel to Merseyside to undergo his medical in the next 48 hours.</p>

<p>Allan is set to join Everton from Napoli for £21m as the club continue their recruitment drive</p>

<p>Everton have also agreed to sign Abdoulaye Doucoure from Watford for a fee of around £20m</p>
