<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Brooke Burke is not often seen with all four of her children.</p>

<p>But that changed this week as the former Dancing With The Stars co-host shared several images with her little ones while on the balcony of Nobu in Malibu as she celebrated her 49th birthday.</p>

<p>The former Playboy cover girl beamed as she had her children Neriah, Sierra, Heaven and Shaya with her as well as her current beau, real estate mogul Scott Rigsby.</p>

<p>Her little ones are not so little anymore: Brooke Burke shared images with her children while on the balcony of Nobu in Malibu as she celebrated her 49th birthday with her new beau</p>

<p>She looks just like mom: Here the model posed with her daughter Neriah, aged 20, whom she had with ex husband Garth Fisher</p>

<p>The Brooke Burke Body founder shares daughters Neriah, 20, and Sierra, 18, with her ex-husband, plastic surgeon Dr Garth Fisher, whom she was married to from 2001 to 2005. </p>

<p>Her second set of children are Heaven, 13, and son Shaya, 12, who are from her ex-husband David Charvet of Baywatch fame. They were married to from 2011 to 2018.</p>

<p>Her girls looked happy as they were dressed up for the fancy Japanese dinner. </p>

<p>Her other daughters: And she has Sierra, 18, with Fisher and Heaven, 13, with Charvet</p>

<p>They look like they could all be sisters! Brooke has retained her youthful appearance which means she could pass as a sibling of these girls</p>

<p>Proud of her posse: Brooke pointed out who was who in this image; the girls all have their own thriving social media accounts</p>

<p>And Burke's son looked just like dad Dave with winning good looks and a megawatt smile. </p>

<p>The family all posted videos of their incredible food order to social media and capped it off by singing happy birthday to their mom as she and Scott shared a kiss overlooking the ocean. </p>

<p>For her birthday outing Brooke stunned in a fire engine red pair of pants and a grey and white checkered blazer with candy cane sleeves that she layered over a simple white blouse. </p>

<p>Another angle: Brooke also shared this image where all of the family was gathered</p>

<p>She sure hearts her girls: In this photo, the siren put a red heard around her image with Neriah</p>

<p>She continued to accentuate the red in her outfit as she carried a small matching clutch, clasping her black face mask in her other hand as she looked smitten with her boyfriend. </p>

<p>She wore her brown curls styled down in beach waves for their Malibu dinner, wearing a simple pair of earrings and a statement thumb ring. </p>

<p>Brooke's silver fox Scott kept it business casual in fitted grey jeans with a black belt. He topped the look off with a dark blue button down that exposed his toned upper body.   </p>

<p>A pal joined them: In this image Isaac Benedict is tagged as he poses with the family</p>

<p>Brooke was first linked to the successful real estate partner in 2019.</p>

<p>The two were seen in August at The Little Beach House Malibu, though their relationship was still new. </p>

<p>Over the holiday weekend Brooke and her beau spent time at the beach getting some rays as she shared an Instagram selfie with a caption that quoted a Leon Bridges song to convey her happiness with her hunky man. </p>

<p>When the kids were small: The cover girl posed with David Charvet and their two kids at the family Marvel Universe Live event in Los Angeles in 2015</p>

<p>Her ex from the past: The Wild On star seen with Dr Garth Fisher during at the United Cancer Front Gala at Universal Studios in Universal City, California in 2004</p>

<p>They first stepped out publicly together a few months later in November at a charity benefit with Brooke telling reporters at an event that she 'really liked him'. </p>

<p>'He has two children and that is one of the things that I love most about him. He is really kind and responsible and devoted, so our kids are getting to know each other' she said. </p>

<p>During quarantine the pair have been spending a lot of time together, even road tripping in a luxury RV to Lake Powell with the family. </p>

<p>Since COVID-19 Brooke's fitness app Brooke Burke Body has been thriving as gyms have been closed, forcing many to seek fitness outlets via their phone from the privacy of their own home. </p>

<p>Happiness: The fitness expert seems to be absolutely smitten with her boyfriend of a year Scott as they posted a smiley selfie to social media this summer</p>
