<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A police officer who lost his leg when he was hit by a drunk-driver is 'absolutely disgusted' that the man could be released on licence just 10 months into a five-year jail sentence.  </p>

<p>Hayden Brown, then 25, was found guilty of three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving at Reading Crown Court, and sentenced in December last year.</p>

<p>He was almost twice the legal drink drive limit and had been taking cocaine when the silver Ford Focus he was driving hit Thames Valley Police Constables Thomas Dorman and Wai-man Lam in Maidenhead in September 2018.</p>

<p>Thomas Dorman, now a Sergeant, needed to have his left leg amputated below the knee as a result of the crash, while his colleague suffered puncture wounds, fractured ribs, a dislocated shoulder and severe bruising to his legs.</p>

<p>A 19-year-old female passenger in the car being driven by Brown, from Maidenhead, broke 24 bones and suffered internal injuries.</p>

<p>It is understood Brown has been moved to an open prison, making him eligible for release on temporary licence.</p>

<p>Sergeant Dorman, who previously said he thought Brown's five-year sentence was too lenient, believes he and the other victims have been sentenced to a 'lifetime of punishment' and that the 'justice system is flawed'.</p>

<p>He said: 'Where is the justice for the victim?</p>

<p>'I am absolutely disgusted to find out that Hayden Brown has been already moved to an open prison and will now be allowed to be temporarily released on licence.</p>

<p>'He's served 10 months of a five-year sentence. What an insult. The justice system is broken and failing victims of crime.</p>

<p>Hayden Brown, pictured above, then 25, was previously found guilty of three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving</p>

<p>'How can the system be so fundamentally flawed that his actions effectively sentenced myself, my crew mate and his passenger to a lifetime of punishment, but he gets to leave prison months later?</p>

<p>'How is this protecting our protectors and creating a culture where criminals who harm officers face the full consequences for their actions?'</p>

<p>Sergeant Dorman is calling for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel to look into the case.</p>

<p>Craig O'Leary, Thames Valley Police Federation chairman, added: 'We are shocked and appalled to hear that Brown will not serve the full five years he was handed.</p>

<p>'Brown chose to get behind the wheel, having drunk alcohol and taken cocaine. In doing so he drove into two police officers.</p>

<p>'His actions that day changed Tom's life forever, and yet Brown has spent only a few short months behind bars.</p>

<p>Sergeant Dorman, pictured outside court last year, believes he and the other victims have been sentenced to a 'lifetime of punishment' and that the 'justice system is flawed'</p>

<p>'How is this justice for these officers? How can he be deemed safe to roam society? How will his sentence act as a deterrent?</p>

<p>'Police officers around the country will be disgusted to hear that Brown will walk free after such a short time behind bars.'</p>

<p>A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Drink drivers ruin lives which is why we are introducing tougher sentences so they feel the full force of the law.</p>

<p>'Offenders in open jails face strict conditions and can be returned to closed prison if they breach them.'</p>
