<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Another weekend of goals and drama for Sportsmail’s top columnist Peter Crouch to dissect. </p>

<p>There are plenty of big issues, from Everton’s flying start to worries for Manchester United, but can he also be lured out of retirement? We’ll find out…</p>

<p>Peter Crouch answers more of your questions as part of a weekly series here for Sportsmail</p>

<p>Gareth Bale is back at Tottenham: when you joined from Portsmouth — and he had been at White Hart Lane for two years — did you think he’d become world class? </p>

<p>Theo Welch via email</p>

<p>It was such a strange situation, Theo. Gareth immediately took my breath away. We had brilliant players then, such as Luka Modric, but Gareth was consistently the best in training every single day. If you put him into a match, though, it wasn’t happening for him.</p>

<p>We couldn’t put our finger on it but Harry Redknapp could see he was low on confidence at left back. He moved him up the pitch and that was the moment when everything changed. It had been like asking Cristiano Ronaldo to play right back. We started seeing on a Saturday what we saw from Monday to Friday: this flying machine who had it all.</p>

<p>I’m delighted he is now back at Tottenham and it was great to see him on Saturday, for an interview for BT Sport.</p>

<p>I'm delighted Gareth Bale is back at Tottenham and it was great to catch up with him again</p>

<p>One thing struck me: he hasn’t changed one single bit. He’s won more Champions Leagues than Manchester United and he has got no financial worries but, trust me, he is as hungry as ever. All he wanted was to be happy again and now that he is, he’ll bang goals in left, right and centre.</p>

<p>Fair play to Tottenham for pulling their finger out, as there was interest in Gareth from other clubs. I’m not going to say this is a fairytale but it is a piece of business that has left everyone involved — player, club, supporters — delighted. I hope it comes up trumps.</p>

<p>How good are Everton? I think James Rodriguez is the dog’s biscuits, if I’m honest. </p>

<p>Mike Rutter via Twitter</p>

<p>A nice choice of phrase, Mike, if I may say so. I will agree with you. He’s a beautiful player and a treat to watch in his opening two matches. The goal he scored against West Brom was picture perfect.</p>

<p>But I like Dominic Calvert-Lewin, too, and I was delighted to see him score a proper centre forward’s hat-trick. He needs to add a few more goals to his game but he has the potential to be a focal point for Carlo Ancelotti, who is just a wonderful manager.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I played in David Beckham’s UNICEF game. The night before we were all at a hotel in Manchester and Carlo, who was managing the Rest of the World team, was sitting at a table with Sir Alex Ferguson, John Terry and Ashley Cole.</p>

<p>It was late but I headed over and joined them — I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to hear these legends speaking — and I can tell you now that Ancelotti is one of life’s gentlemen. He is amazing and Everton are in safe hands.</p>

<p>James Rodriguez is a beautiful player and has been a treat to watch in the first two games</p>

<p>Do you think Manchester United will stay up this season? </p>

<p>Dean Coupland via Twitter</p>

<p>Oh, Dean. You’ve put me on the spot. I think it is going to be touch and go but, looking at their squad, I’d say they just might have enough to beat the drop. I’m guessing, however, that you probably aren’t a season-ticket holder in the Stretford End?</p>

<p>Then again, I’m glad you have asked me about United. I held a lot of hope for them in the summer but, once again, the way they have negotiated the transfer market has left me puzzled. </p>

<p>They seem to buy good players, such as Donny van de Beek, but they don’t seem to have a strategy. If you have got Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes, why do you need Van de Beek? </p>

<p>Why did they not go for a forward, such as Raul Jimenez from Wolves? The defence needs strengthening, so why are they concentrating on Jadon Sancho rather than a partner for Harry Maguire? Sancho is superb, don’t get me wrong, but how much of an upgrade is he on Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood, who can all play in that position? The £100million for Sancho could be better invested elsewhere.</p>

<p>United didn’t play well against Crystal Palace but what I would say is that people are quick to react. It is never as bad as you fear and never as good as you believe. I still expect them to figure in the fight for the top four.</p>

<p>Manchester United need to concentrate on finding a centre back partner for Harry Maguire</p>

<p>Can we accept that there is no perfect handball law? Can’t we just say if it hits an arm, it’s a penalty? </p>

<p>Khaled Adeeb via Twitter</p>

<p>I don’t know where to begin with this, Khaled. I watched the Manchester United game on Saturday and how a penalty was given against Victor Lindelof, I will never know. It was a nonsense decision and if that is now handball, we are going to have hundreds of penalties.</p>

<p>You should know my feelings on VAR by now but, if you don’t, I will say it again: I can’t stand it. I don’t know what was wrong with the old rules.</p>

<p>Unintentional handballs should not be punished and the biggest indicator you will get is looking at the reaction of players. Not one member of Crystal Palace’s team appealed at Old Trafford — professionals know when there has been foul play but if you don’t see anyone shout to the referee, you can read the situation. Accidental handball should not be punished. Now it seems every ball to hand will be a penalty.</p>

<p>The handball penalty given against Victor Lindelof on Saturday was a nonsense decision</p>

<p>Do you think you are hard enough to play Sunday League? </p>

<p>Chris Brown via email</p>

<p>Who is asking, Chris? You? Don’t you think I’m hard enough! </p>

<p>Let’s put it this way, I’m not hard and I wouldn’t be the kind of player who would go out on a Sunday morning and lay the local hard case out. </p>

<p>But I’m not someone who would get scared by rough treatment and if someone thought they could kick me out of the game, they would be disappointed. I’m not ready to venture into Sunday League yet, mind you. </p>

<p>Five-a-side will be first but that will only happen once I get off the golf course.</p>

<p>Do you see a point when Danny Ings will be first choice starter for England? </p>

<p>Saints Mad via Twitter</p>

<p>A good question, Saints. I’m surprised by your team’s start. I thought Southampton were excellent following the restart but it’s just taking time for things to gel. Ings, though, appears to have started with a bang and his double on Sunday was encouraging.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, Max, who has been trying to get a mention on my podcast for two years, said in January that he really fancied Ings to be England’s main man at the Euros. I wasn’t on board at that time but the more the year has gone on, the more he has impressed me and I don’t think a regular England start is out of the question.</p>

<p>He will have been disappointed not to have got longer than 22 minutes in the games against Iceland and Denmark but there are six England games between now and Christmas and I hope he gets the chance he deserves. I think he will keep surprising people.</p>

<p>I don't think a regular England start is out of the question for Southampton's Danny Ings</p>

<p>How would Rangers and Celtic get on if they joined the Premier League? </p>

<p>Scott Andrews via email</p>

<p>They would be close to the top, Scott, if it had anything to do with support and history. They are amazing clubs and I know from being up in Glasgow last year how enthusiastic the fans are. I was waiting in Glasgow airport with Chris Sutton and it was like sitting with Elvis!</p>

<p>I’ve got to be honest with you, unfortunately, and say as things stand both Rangers and Celtic would be in the bottom half if they entered the Premier League and that is purely down to the budgets. The squads assembled and the wages the top English teams play are on another level.</p>

<p>For that reason, I don’t see how Rangers or Celtic could compete. I’m enjoying watching Steven Gerrard’s progress as a manager from afar and I hope, one day, he wins a trophy at Ibrox but we need to be realistic. The top of England and the top of Scotland are two different things.</p>

<p>Who is having the best transfer window? </p>

<p>Conor Gillett via Twitter</p>

<p>I might surprise you, Conor, especially after Sunday's result but I am picking Newcastle. </p>

<p>Yes, Chelsea have spent a lot of money and bought the best players. Liverpool, too, have been busy over the weekend and Thiago Alcantara is someone I cannot wait to watch. Everton’s business has been excellent but I have picked Newcastle because they have spent sensibly. </p>

<p>Every player will, in time, make the club better and every player will fill a hole. I know there won’t be many in agreement but if we all thought the same, life would be dull. Until next time.</p>

<p>Newcastle have spent sensibly and every player will fill a hole and make the club better</p>
