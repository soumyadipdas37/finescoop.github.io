<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A stay here is bound to be a crowning moment in anyone's year. </p>

<p>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air mansion is being added to Airbnb's listings 30 years after Will Smith rolled up the driveway and knocked on the door of the iconic crib for the very first time.</p>

<p>The grand pillared home, which features in the opening credits of the sitcom, has been decked out with 'bold graffiti art and timeless family portraits' - and Philly cheesesteaks will be served on silver platters. </p>

<p>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air mansion is being added to Airbnb's listings 30 years after Will Smith rolled up the driveway and knocked on the door for the very first time </p>

<p>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air originally aired on TV from September 1990 until May 1996 and was the show that launched Will Smith's career. Pictured are some of the stars of the show - Karyn Parsons, Joseph Marcell, Janet Hubert, Alfonso Ribeiro, Tatyana Ali, James Avery and, bottom right, Will Smith</p>

<p>Filming of interior scenes for the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air mainly took place on a Los Angeles sound-stage in pre-made sets – but the home used for the Airbnb stay, which is actually located in the posh neighborhood of Brentwood, near Bel-Air, was seen not only in the opening credits, but every time Will's best friend, Jazz (played by DJ Jazzy Jeff), was thrown out.</p>

<p>His expulsion from the property was a running joke in the show. </p>

<p>The stays will take place in a wing of the mansion, with access to a posh bedroom and bathroom, an amazing outdoor pool, a poolside lounge area and an elegant dining room.</p>

<p>Airbnb says that guests will get to 'lace up a fresh pair of Air Jordans before shooting some b-ball in the bedroom, spin throwback classics all night on turntables and don a fly look from Will's closet, from argyle prepster to all-star Bel-Air athlete'</p>

<p>The incredible pool and a poolside lounge will be at the disposal of guests during their stay</p>

<p>Food fit for a king, or prince: Philly cheesesteaks will be served on silver platters, says Airbnb</p>

<p>Airbnb says that during this 'royal overnight' guests will be virtually welcomed to the mansion by none other than DJ Jazzy Jeff himself.</p>

<p>Then they'll get to 'lace up a fresh pair of Air Jordans before shooting some b-ball in the bedroom, spin throwback classics all night on turntables and don a fly look from Will's closet, from argyle prepster to all-star Bel-Air athlete'.</p>

<p>So that fans around the world can get in on the fun, DJ Jazzy Jeff will also be hosting an Airbnb Online Experience 'in which he'll teach guests how to spin and scratch like a hip-hop legend'.</p>

<p>During the 'royal overnight' guests will be virtually welcomed to the mansion by none other than DJ Jazzy Jeff himself (pictured), who played Will Smith's best friend on the show</p>

<p>Guests will get to spend some virtual time with him in his home studio and 'spin some vinyl together in honor of the good 'ole days at the freshest crib in LA'.</p>

<p>Aspiring DJs can request to book this one-time event starting today at abnb.co/djjazzyjeff, and the experience will take place on October 1.</p>
