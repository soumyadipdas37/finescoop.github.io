<p>And another said: 'Would you consider a swap for all the toilet paper in the world.'</p>

<p>One woman shared a picture of two complete sets of her Ooshies, joking: 'I actually have two full sets including glitters so can I get $100,000.'</p>

<p>The full set of Ooshies became available in Australia from August 26 and include characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. </p>

<p>Shoppers can collect one of the 36 figurines with every $30 spent in store or online.</p>

<p>The seller, from Sydney's Warriewood on the Northern Beaches, listed the first ever 'ultra rare' The Child Ooshie from Star Wars for a starting bid of $100 on Saturday. </p>

<p>'Baby Yoda Ooshies - Ultra Rare. First on eBay. Not to be confused with the normal green Yoda, this one is the baby and has felt/fur clothing,' the seller wrote in the eBay ad.</p>

<p>The sale ends on the evening of Saturday, September 19. </p>

<p>According to eBay's policy, a bid is a binding contract that's active until an auction-style listing ends or you're outbid.</p>

<p>'You can only retract a bid if the seller significantly changed the description of the item or if you accidentally bid the wrong amount. Retracting a bid for any other reason is considered an invalid bid retraction,' eBay states on its website. </p>

<p>The rare collectables come just weeks after a 'leaked' picture on social media emerged revealing the never-before-seen 'furry' versions of Thor and The Child. Thor and Baby Yoda were pictured alongside the four glitter versions of Elsa from Frozen, Woody from Toy Story, Captain Marvel and The Mandalorian from Star Wars</p>
