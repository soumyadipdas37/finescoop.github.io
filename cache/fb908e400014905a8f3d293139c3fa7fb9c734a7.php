<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lionel Messi is set on leaving Barcelona this summer and will not make a u-turn on his decision no matter what the club offer him, according to presidential candidate Toni Freixa.</p>

<p>The Argentine rocked football last week when he told the club that he wanted to leave, citing a clause in his contract which he believes allows him to depart for free.</p>

<p>And after Messi refused to return to pre-season training on Sunday, Freixa insists there is no way for the club to repair its relationship with their wantaway star.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi will not go back on his decision to leave Barcelona this summer, claims Toni Freixa</p>

<p>Toni Freixa (above) sees no reason why the Manchester City manager won't go back one day</p>

<p>'As I have heard from several sides, the decision the player has come to is one that has matured over several years and is irrevocable,' he told Goal. 'I don't believe that there is any going back.</p>

<p>'Messi is a player who strives for maximum success. He alone cannot achieve maximum success, he needs a team for that. He does not have one. </p>

<p>'Since the treble in 2015, Champions League success is missing. That is what concerns him. His decision is due to the negative sporting development of the team in recent years.'</p>

<p>A number of clubs have been linked with a move for Messi since he announced his decision, with PSG, Juventus and Manchester United among them.</p>

<p>However, Freixa, who is in the running to replace Josep Maria Bartomeu in next year's presidential elections, believes reuniting with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City makes most sense for the 33-year-old. </p>

<p>On Monday night, Spanish radio station Cadena Ser claimed that City will offer Messi an initial two-year contract, with the club's director of football, Txiki Begiristain, already in Spain to negotiate a deal.</p>

<p>'I think a move to Man City is likely,' Freixa added. 'With Pep, Messi experienced his most brilliant years in Barcelona. It would only be logical if both of them worked together again.'</p>
