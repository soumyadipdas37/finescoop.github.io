<p>About 400 AFL players and officials - including top executives - have descended on the state after the Grand Final was moved there from Melbourne.</p>

<p>While everyone else is locked out. WAGs and officials are in 'hotel quarantine' sipping cocktails while lounging by the pool at their luxury Gold Coast resorts.</p>

<p>The controversial quarantine arrangements drew the ire of many when compared to a mother who lost one of her twins because she couldn't cross the border for treatment.</p>

<p>But the Collingwood president defended the exemptions granted by the Queensland Government as necessary for the season to continue.</p>

<p>'They are the kids of the players' wives who have been away from their family for a couple of months now,' he said on radio station Triple M.</p>

<p>'Yesterday, I saw [Carlton star] Eddie Betts' wife who is pregnant, with her three kids. They're able to jump into a pool in Queensland in a lockdown area that has a giant fence around the outside.</p>

<p>'I've never heard of an apple compared to a pineapple quite so much as trying to run up this political point scoring and politics of envy.</p>

<p>'There's no AFL officials sitting by the pool bar, they're people here working.'</p>

<p>Mcguire described the strict protocols everyone must live under for the next two weeks, and even after that many restrictions remain.</p>

<p>'This is a total Quarantine hub. There's a golf course outside my window which I have to look out. You can't go and hit the driving range,' he said.</p>

<p>Birds eye video footage of the quarantine hotel showed AFL officials and WAGs make the most of the luxury Mercure resort</p>

<p>'Going into this you have the full Covid test. We had another one yesterday and waiting for the results. </p>

<p>'If someone tests COVID positive, the whole place goes into lockdown. The person goes into isolation. </p>

<p>'We have to wear masks going anywhere near a staff member. It is absolutely policed. There was a spot check the other day, Queensland health hit the place.' </p>

<p>Mcguire was responding to images and video that emerged on Thursday showing officials and families chilling out the 4.5-star Mercure Gold Coast resort.</p>

<p>Aerial footage - published by Nine News on Thursday - showed WAGs relaxing by the swimming pool at the quarantine resort as children splashed in the water.   </p>

<p>The wives and girlfriends soaked up the sun with drinks in hand, just a few steps away from the poolside bar.   </p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been criticised for easing her strict border controls to welcome the officials and their loved ones from coronavirus-riddled Victoria</p>

<p>Jayne Brown (pictured) was denied an exemption to self-isolate at her Sunshine Coast home </p>

<p>The vision is a world away from the experience of other travellers who have desperately fought to enter Queensland. </p>

<p>Jayne Brown, 60, spent two weeks confined to a tiny hotel room in Brisbane following her recent return from Sydney, where renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo removed two large tumours on her brain.</p>

<p>The grandmother-of-seven requested an exemption from hotel quarantine to self-isolate at home on the Sunshine Coast, but was rejected twice.</p>

<p>She blasted Ms Palaszczuk for allowing the AFL officials to enter the state on Tuesday night. </p>

<p>'I don't understand it, mind-blowing,' Ms Brown told Nine News.</p>

<p>The Queensland government has deemed all of Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT to be coronavirus hotspots.</p>

<p>Travellers from hotspot states who are granted a border declaration pass are required to spend 14 days in mandatory hotel quarantine, at their own cost.   </p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg accused the Queensland government of double standards. </p>

<p>AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan flew to the Gold Coast on Tuesday ahead of the code's announcement the Gabba in Brisbane will host the grand final</p>

<p>Mr Frydenberg said the football hub showed two sets of rules on borders given regular punters had missed out on vital medical treatment.</p>

<p>'It's just not on that a young woman can lose an unborn child because of confusion at the borders,' he told the Nine Network on Thursday. </p>

<p>'At the same time, footy officials can go down to their hotel bar as they so-called quarantine in Queensland.</p>

<p>'It seems double standards on our borders.'</p>

<p>Mr McLachlan refused to be drawn into a war of words.</p>

<p>'The borders between the federal government and the states is a big issue and I'm not going to wade into that, other than to say I empathise with every situation,' he told 3AW.</p>

<p>McLachlan arrives for a press conference from the Queensland quarantine hub on Wednesday to announce the 2020 AFL Grand Final will be played at the Gabba </p>

<p>He hoped people would understand the arrangements were keeping people in jobs.</p>

<p>'With respect to the borders and the individual circumstances - great empathy. With respect to the politics - not for me.'</p>

<p>The CEO flew to the Gold Coast on Tuesday ahead of the code's announcement Brisbane will host the grand final. </p>

<p>AFL officials and their families still need to undergo hotel quarantine after flying into the state.</p>

<p>But they are free to leave their room and use the pool and bar amenities, unlike other quarantine guests solely confined to their rooms.</p>

<p>The Sunshine State will host the 2020 Grand Final on October 24 at the Gabba in Brisbane following a deadly coronavirus outbreak in Victoria. </p>
