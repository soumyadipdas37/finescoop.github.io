<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius is wanted on loan by Bundesliga side Union Berlin.</p>

<p>The 27-year old, who joined Liverpool for £4.75million from Mainz in 2016, is no longer required at Anfield and spent last season on loan at Besiktas.</p>

<p>The former Germany U21 international struggled to establish himself at Liverpool after a series of error strewn performances, notably in the 2018 Champions League Cup final against Real Madrid when he was at fault for two of Madrid’s goals in a 3-1 defeat.</p>

<p>Loris Karius could be on his way back to the Bundesliga this summer after his Besiktas loan</p>

<p>The German spent two years in Turkey with Besiktas after losing his place in the Liverpool team</p>

<p>Union Berlin are interested in loaning Karius to bolster their squad for the Bundesliga season</p>

<p>He has two years left on contract and Liverpool would prefer to make his move a permanent sale.</p>

<p>Karius' final game for Liverpool was that 2018 Champions League final, with most Reds fans assuming they wouldn't see him turn out at Anfield again. </p>

<p>The keeper was moved out to Besiktas on-loan after the Reds brought in Alisson Becker, with the Brazilian helping the Reds to European glory a year on from their final heartbreak. </p>

<p>The keeper's 2018 Champions League final errors effectively ended his career at Liverpool </p>

<p>Karius has now made more appearances (67) for the Turkish club that he did for Liverpool, having never looked settled in England during his 49 games.   </p>

<p>The German has been training with the Liverpool team since his loan ended but has not yet made the matchday squad. </p>

<p>Union Berlin have had a tough start to the season with one point from their first two Bundesliga games, having impressed last season in their first German top-flight season with 11th place. </p>
