<p>She will be joining her longtime pal Lili Reinhart on set, who recently described feeling 'like a prisoner' for having to return north of the border to film their popular series in a new Nylon profile. </p>

<p>Lili has said she's less than thrilled about the idea, as it means she 'cannot leave Canada' and won't be able to visit her family for Thanksgiving in November.</p>

<p>She also lamented having to fit into a prom dress she wore in an episode before filming was halted, because she's 'a little bit thicker' than she was before the pandemic.  </p>

<p>Splitsville: Her kissing post, which she tagged Vaughan in, comes six months after Mendes broke up with her costar Charles Melton after a year of dating in December; seen in May 2019</p>

<p>'We stopped during the prom episode, so I have to fit back in that prom dress. Five months later, we're all going to be tan, maybe a little bit thicker. I certainly am,' she said.</p>

<p>'I genuinely feel like a prisoner, going back to work, because I cannot leave Canada. That doesn't feel good. You can't go home for Thanksgiving, can't visit your family. No one can come visit you unless they quarantine for two weeks. It just feels f*****.'</p>

<p>Despite her grievances, Lili acknowledged she is 'very lucky' to have the show to return to as other people have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. </p>
