<p>The red areas on the map above indicate areas of high wind with tornadoes possible in southeast Queensland on the weekend </p>

<p>South Australia will receive the heaviest rainfalls courtesy of a low pressure system, particularly in the eastern parts of the state on Saturday afternoon.  </p>

<p>Severe weather warnings are in place for South Australia, southeast parts of the Northern Territory, southwest Queensland and northwest parts of Victoria. </p>

<p>Western areas of New South Wales are also urged to stay alert for severe thunderstorms. </p>

<p>The east coast of the country will also experience rain throughout the weekend directed by a high pressure system further north. </p>

<p>Some areas of the country are forecast to receive a drenching and could see more than their average Spring rainfall in two days.  </p>

<p>'There is a large low pressure system that is dragging a lot of pressure from the north to the south,' Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Grace Legge told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'We will see steady rainfall over the next 24 to 48 hours. But embedded in that, we will also seeing thunderstorms which will bring quite significant rainfall in a very short period of time which could lead to flash flooding.' </p>

<p>Over 50mm of rain is expected in parts of inland Australia, where the average annual rainfall is normally about 200mm.     </p>

<p>Sydney is in for a wet weekend with showers expected on Saturday (pictured) and Sunday </p>

<p>This could cause roads to be cut off making some communities inaccessible.  </p>

<p>In Queensland most of the wild weather will be in the west, however, the east coast is set to see some rain.  </p>

<p>'We have a warning for parts of southwest Queensland in place on Friday and there is a chance we might get thunderstorms that bring large to giant hail,' Ms Legge said. </p>

<p>Temperatures will hover around average with a highs of 25C in Brisbane. </p>

<p>South Australia and the Northern Territory will see strong winds with some gusts over 100km/h and thunderstorms. </p>

<p>Temperatures will be in the low 20s in South Australia and rising towards the low 30s further north.    </p>

<p>Regional Victorians in the northeast of the state are being warned to stay indoors on Saturday with 10-20mm of rain expected fall. </p>

<p>The State Emergency Service is advising residents who may travel or camp over the weekend to monitor conditions.</p>

<p>'We encourage people to avoid setting up camp under trees or on low-lying areas alongside creeks or rivers,' Commander David Tucek said.</p>

<p>There are severe thunderstorm warnings in place for the southwest of Queensland</p>

<p>There are is also a thunderstorm warnings in place for the northwest of Victoria</p>

<p>He said residents should clean their gutters, downpipes and drains to prevent blockages and clear loose items from backyards.  </p>

<p>Temperatures will remain moderate throughout the state.  </p>

<p>The build up of moisture is also set to wreak havoc on the western half of NSW tomorrow with severe thunderstorms.</p>

<p>The rest of the state is also set for a wet weekend with cooler temperatures especially in Sydney which will see highs of 21C. </p>

<p>Overnight temperatures are also set to be chilly in Canberra, Sydney Perth and Hobart which are expected to approach 10C. </p>

<p>Perth will also see some rain and a cooler weekend with high of just 19C.  </p>

<p>On Saturday, regional Victorians in the northeast of the state are being warned to stay indoors with 10-20mm of rain expected fall (pictured: rain disrupts commuters in Geelong)</p>

<p>The east coasts capital cities are likely to avoid the worst of the wild weather. </p>

<p>'The more significant rainfall probably won't make it to the east coast capitals like Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne,' Ms Legge said.</p>

<p>'But on Sunday we will see that rainfall heads to the coast, but it will have lost a lot of its power by then.</p>

<p>'However, Canberra could see about 10mm of rain.'</p>

<p>Although low pressure systems usually mean a cold snap, on this occasion, it might actually get warmer. </p>

<p>'It will actually increase the temperature, It's a very warm air mass and a lot of the areas will probably experience quite muggy, humid temperatures,' Ms Legge said.   </p>

<p>The system is expected to ease late on Sunday before it then moves offshore. </p>
