<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former tradie who would get drunk on his lunch breaks before going and robbing banks in disguises such as fake mustaches and sunglasses has been sentenced. </p>

<p>Ross Oliver McCarty, 71, got away with his crimes for nearly 40 years before the law caught up with him courtesy of fingerprints which linked him to the crime scenes. </p>

<p>After pleading guilty to four bank robberies across Sydney in 1977 and 1978 McCarty was this week sentenced to at least one year and nine months behind bars. </p>

<p>Ross Oliver McCarty leaves the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney on Thursday, October 17, 2019 after a previous court appearance </p>

<p>Ross McCarty's wife declined to speak to reporters when she left court in October 2019 </p>

<p>The court heard he would write notes on withdrawal slips claiming to have a gun in a bag, which was actually a water pistol, and demanding cash of up to $5,000. </p>

<p>McCarty, who used the money to fund a gambling problem, had a number of disguises up his sleeve including a terry-towelling hat and a French beret that allowed him to fool witnesses and rudimentary CCTV. </p>

<p>'This is a hold up, gun in bag. $2000 in 50s please, no tricks,' one of the notes read, according to Newscorp.  </p>

<p>McCarty robbed branches of the Commercial Banking Company, Commercial Bank of Australia, National Bank of Australasia, Rural Bank, Bank of New South Wales and ANZ.  </p>

<p>The court had heard he made off with a total of more than $11,000 in his heists. </p>

<p>In 2018 police reopened their case on a string of seven robberies in 2018 and with fingerprints left on the withdrawal slips and better forensic technology leading them to McCarty. </p>

<p>'I think just about all of them were after boozy lunches. So I'd get boozed at lunch time and go and do it. Those days were boozy days,' the former flooring tradesman told police. </p>

<p> McCarty, who used the money to fund a gambling problem, had a number of disguises up his sleeve including a terry-towelling hat and a French beret that allowed him to fool witnesses and rudimentary CCTV </p>

<p>Police allege McCarty, who was in his late 20s at the time of the robberies, handed tellers notes that warned he had a gun and demanded they hand over money in small denominations </p>

<p>June 3, 1977: $1,300 from the Commercial Banking Company at Ultimo</p>

<p>June 14, 1977: $850 from the Rural Bank in Sydney</p>

<p>July 13, 1977: $1,943 from the Commercial Banking Company at Haymarket</p>

<p>July 25, 1977: $2,000 from the ANZ in Sydney</p>

<p>October 11, 1977: $1,400 from the Commercial Bank of Australia at Chatswood</p>

<p>February 20, 1978: $1,400 from the Bank of NSW in Sydney</p>

<p>March 7, 1978: $450 from the Bank of NSW in Sydney</p>

<p>March 9, 1978: $2,000 from the National Bank of Australasia in Sydney </p>

<p>He admitted to the seven robberies plus another that detectives had not linked to him, explaining he had gotten into debt at a number of seedy gambling joints in Sydney. </p>

<p>'I was visiting gambling joints, so I owed money. The reason [for the robberies] was … to cover that. I was blowing everything.' </p>

<p>McCarty was only caught after his fingerprints were taken when he was charged with an unrelated offence in 2010 and later matched to the archived notes found at the crime scenes. </p>

<p>The agreed statement of facts said McCarty was robbing banks because he lost money while gambling.</p>

<p>'I used to lap it up and it kind of snowballed … the more I did the worse I felt about the whole thing and [it] was leading a double life,' he told police, according to agreed facts. </p>

<p>McCarty got a 'really good job' in 1979 and stopped robbing once he gave up gambling. </p>

<p>In December 2019, McCarty plead guilty to four of the crimes with the other four accounted for in his sentencing. </p>

<p>Judge Huggett said although the offences were 'significantly stale' he was intelligent, knew what he was doing and would still need to pay for his crimes, sentencing him to three years and six months. </p>

<p>His wife of 50 years leaned over and hugged him in the dock before he was led away from Downing Centre District Court to begin his sentence. </p>

<p>He will be eligible for parole in 2022.  </p>

<p>McCarty was arrested at his Edgecliff home in December last year after investigators used his fingerprints to link him to the crimes</p>
