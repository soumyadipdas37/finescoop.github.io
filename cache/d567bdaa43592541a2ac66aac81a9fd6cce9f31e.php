<p>Kate revealed: 'We did our best to make it special. We had him on FaceTime. We raised a glass to say happy anniversary.</p>

<p>'I have a card to take to read to him. He was a prolific card writer for birthdays. He'd always remember. And hopefully he'll do it again. </p>

<p>'It will be strange reading to him, but this time I have made a bit more of an effort.'    </p>

<p>Derek is now in a limited consciousness and is unable to talk - but can hear things. His carers have been playing GMB on TV for him, while Kate is on. </p>

<p>Kate returned to the studio having taken time out to settle her children into school, after what has been a challenging six months for the family.</p>
