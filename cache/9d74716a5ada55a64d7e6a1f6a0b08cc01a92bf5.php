<p>There have been previous concerns with authorities that Thorburn could self-harm.   </p>

<p>'Queensland Corrective Services can confirm that a prisoner was transported by QAS to the Princess Alexandra Hospital after being found unresponsive in their single occupancy cell at Wolston Correctional Centre at unlock yesterday morning,' a QCS spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>'The prisoner remains in hospital at this time.' </p>

<p>Thorburn killed Tiahleigh between 8pm and 10pm October 29, 2015, hours after his son Trent, who was 18 at the time, confessed to having raped her - telling his parents he feared she was pregnant. </p>

<p>Tiahleigh's mother Cindy Palmer told 60 Minutes she 'fell to the ground crying' when she was told her daughter was dead.</p>

<p>'Obviously it was my daughter and she was found washed up in a river. What kind of animal leaves a girl in a river?' </p>
