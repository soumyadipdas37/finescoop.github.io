<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A student from an elite Catholic school was held face-down and sexually assaulted with a carrot on a school rugby trip, a court heard.</p>

<p>The boy from Trinity College, in Perth, was then tormented in the months after the assault by his alleged attackers on social media.</p>

<p>Schoolboys allegedly taunted the victim with pictures of carrots and giant radishes as well as a cartoon of a carrot with his faced on it labelled 'carrot man.'</p>

<p>A student at Trinity College, in Perth, (pictured) claims he was raped with a carrot by his peers</p>

<p>A doctored magazine cover was also designed by a student featuring a band called 'the carrots' with the single 'Uranus' which was a 'forceful change to the music industry,' reported ABC news. </p>

<p>The series of events allegedly took place during a school rugby tour to Japan in April 2017.</p>

<p>On the same school trip an anaphylactic child allegedly went missing at the Singapore airport on route to Japan.   </p>

<p>The claims were made during a trial for two of the supervising teachers Ian Francis Hailes and Anthony Paul Webb at Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday.</p>

<p>Both teachers were dismissed after the school trip, and stand accused of failing to make a mandatory report of suspected child sexual abuse. </p>

<p>The claims were made during a trial for two of the supervising teachers Ian Francis Hailes and Anthony Paul Webb at the Perth Magistrates Court (pictured) on Thursday</p>

<p>They pleaded not guilty to the charges during the court appearance this week. </p>

<p>However the schoolboys accused of sexual abuse are not facing criminal proceedings because of difficulties prosecuting alleged crimes by juveniles from another country in Japan. </p>

<p>Mr Hailes gave evidence during the trial on Thursday, telling the court he wasn't aware of the sexual assault until months later.</p>

<p>The school trip involved 28 students ranging from years ten to 12 with three teachers present to supervise. </p>

<p>On each day of the trip students would participate in a 'fines session' where they would be punished for any misdemeanors they committed.</p>

<p>The schoolboys allegedly taunted him with pictures of carrots and giant radishes as well as a cartoon of a carrot with his faced on it labelled 'carrot man' (stock image)</p>

<p>The victim told the court he used one of these sessions to tell the two teachers about the attack, saying: 'I would like to nominate everyone in my room last night. You know what you did.'</p>

<p>He also detailed how the trip was rife with physical violence that resulted in hotel guests lodging noise complaints about the school group. </p>

<p>Another student who gave evidence told the court he was threatened he would 'be the next' to get the carrot.</p>

<p>But Mr Hailes told the court he had not heard what the victim said, but when he spoke with Mr Webb later understood the incident to involve bullying.</p>

<p>The maths teacher said he was told the boy had a carrot 'put in his pants'.</p>

<p>He said it wasn't until September that he was told an alleged sexual assault had taken place by the school's acting principal Peter Norman. </p>

<p>The court heard the victim was continually bullied about the incident in the months after the trip (pictured: a text message exchange between students references the alleged attack) </p>

<p>But between April and September the court heard how the victim was continually bullied by other students both inside and outside the school.    </p>

<p>The allegations come amid recent revelations of bad behaviour at boys' schools.</p>

<p>Shore School, in Sydney's lower north shore, went into damage control after a muck-up day document circulating among Year 12 students was leaked to the public on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Titled the 'Triwizard Shorenament' - a reference to Harry Potter - students were encouraged to participate in a range of illegal activities such as spitting on a homeless man, breaking into Taronga Zoo and taking drugs.</p>
