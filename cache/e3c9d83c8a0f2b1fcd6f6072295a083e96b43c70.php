<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manu Feildel has insisted he's very much 'still friends' with his former My Kitchen Rules star Pete Evans.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 46-year-old spoke out to New Idea about his relationship with anti-vaxxer Pete - whose controversial opinion on health topics has been deemed dangerous in recent months.</p>

<p>But despite claims that Manu has turned his back on Pete, the Plate of Origin star has now said that 'nothing has changed' between the two.</p>

<p>'Nothing's changed!' On Tuesday, Manu Feildel (left) spoke out to New Idea about his relationship with anti-vaxxer Pete Evans (right) - whose controversial opinion on health topics has been deemed dangerous in recent months</p>

<p>'I’ve caught up with Peter last week. We’re still friends, we’ve been friends for a long time so nothing’s changed.'</p>

<p>When asked if he found it difficult to see his friend face backlash, he responded: 'He doesn’t look at it as backlash, he looks at it as publicity.</p>

<p>'He gets his message across and people like it, people don’t and you know, it is what it is.'</p>

<p>Divisive: Evans has been involved in a string of controversies since being sacked by Seven earlier this year for his extreme views. In July, he claimed that COVID-19 was a 'f**king hoax' and that the pandemic 'doesn't compare to what is happening in the world on a large scale' </p>

<p>He went on to say that his friend is 'fine' and that he's simply getting on with his life.</p>

<p>In July, he claimed that COVID-19 was a 'f**king hoax' and that the pandemic 'doesn't compare to what is happening in the world on a large scale'.</p>

<p>October 2014: Evans claims the Paleo diet can prevent autism</p>

<p>March 2015: His book is pulled from shelves due to its bone broth recipe for infants</p>

<p>July 2016: Evans claims vegan women should eat meat during pregnancy, advises against wearing 'normal' sunscreen, and claims Wi-Fi is 'dangerous'</p>

<p>August 2016: He says osteoporosis suffers shouldn't eat dairy</p>

<p>September 2016: Evans claims camel milk could supplement breastfeeding</p>

<p>April 2017: Evans campaigns against the 'mass fluoridation of public water'</p>

<p>December 2018: Evans reveals he looks directly into the sun</p>

<p>April 2020: Evans' ketogenic recipe book is slammed by health professionals and he is fined for promoting his 'healing lamp'</p>

<p>Among his false claims about the pandemic, Pete has previously declared he's immune to coronavirus, and blamed the health crisis on 5G technology.</p>

<p>Trump supporter Evans' central belief is that 'food is medicine' and that by following a Paleo diet, people can develop superhuman immune systems that can withstand all illnesses, including COVID-19.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no scientific basis for this. Following a particular diet does not make a person any less likely to contract the deadly respiratory virus.</p>
