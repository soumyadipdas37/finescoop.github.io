<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The 8.02am train from Oxford to London Marylebone was the most overcrowded in England and Wales last autumn, as new figures reveal the top ten most pack trains.</p>

<p>There were nearly twice as many standard class passengers as the registered capacity when the two-carriage Chiltern Railways service arrived in London on a weekday, giving it a load factor of 196 per cent. </p>

<p>The Department for Transport (DfT), which published the data, said constraints on the number of available carriages limited the operator's ability to cope with rising demand.</p>

<p>The 8.02am train from Oxford to London Marylebone was the most overcrowded in England and Wales last autumn, as new figures reveal the top ten most pack trains </p>

<p>Commuters board a London Overground train today. The 7.38am Enfield Town to London Liverpool Street train was the third most packed in England and Wales this time last year</p>

<p>The 7.32am South Western Railway train from Woking to London Waterloo was the second most overcrowded train, with a load factor of 182 per cent when it reached its destination.</p>

<p>Load factor refers to the number of passengers as a percentage of the maximum capacity at the busiest point in a journey.</p>

<p>Other services in the top 10 most packed trains include the 3.08pm Great Western Railway train from Weymouth to Gloucester, which has a load factor of 178 per cent.</p>

<p>The DfT stated that the 10 most overcrowded trains represent 'a small fraction of all services' and some of the figures are based on a single count.</p>

<p>Some 16.4 per cent of passengers were standing on trains serving major cities in the morning and evening peaks.</p>

<p>This was a fall of 0.4 percentage points compared with the previous year, driven by a decline of 0.6 percentage points in London.</p>

<p>The cities with the largest increase in passengers standing were Liverpool (up 2.5 percentage points), Bristol (up 2.4 percentage points) and Leeds (up 0.7 percentage points).</p>

<p>The collapse in demand for rail travel due earlier in the coronavirus pandemic is not reflected in the latest figures.</p>

<p>Passengers have started to use tubes and trains again, however, which were packed today as commuters continue to head into the office in their droves - 36 hours after Boris Johnson told Britons to get back to working from home.</p>

<p>Thousands of passengers boarded public transport to get back to desks for the second consecutive morning since the Prime Minister's national address on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Rolling out a new wave of restrictions and changes, Mr Johnson said those who were able to work from home should now go back to doing so, even though he has led a hard campaign of encouraging people back into towns and cities to save firms which have been put under threat during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Traffic data showed little change in the number of cars on roads in Britain's major cities. </p>

<p>Transport for London said 771,000 passengers used the London Underground network from the start of service until 10am - only a 2.3 per cent decrease on the same period last week, and just 32 per cent of normal demand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there were 989,000 bus journeys made - down just 0.6 per cent on last week and at 56 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>Earlier in July, phone data revealed only a handful of workers were commuting into the UK's mostly-deserted big cities.</p>

<p>The data showed that Edinburgh was the city which saw the least workers return to its streets with just 12 per cent footfall when compared to pre-lockdown levels.  </p>

<p>Only one in eight workers in London has returned to the office in July, compared to nearly 50 per cent in Basildon, Essex.</p>

<p>Research by the Centre for Cities think tank shows the majority of office workers across the country had been unwilling to return at the time.</p>
