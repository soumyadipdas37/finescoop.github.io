<p>Footy star Elijah Taylor, 19, is being investigated by his team the Sydney Swans and the AFL over allegations of domestic violence</p>

<p>Investigations began after an Instagram post by his now ex-girlfriend Lekahni Pearce late on Saturday night</p>

<p>'The Sydney Swans are aware of allegations made on social media regarding first year player Elijah Taylor,' the statement read.</p>

<p>'The allegations are very serious and are being treated as such.</p>

<p>'The club has notified the AFL and is not in a position to comment further at this time.'</p>

<p>Drafted with pick 36 in the 2019 AFL Draft, Taylor played four games in his first year before being suspended over the COVID-19 biosecurity breach.</p>

<p>Taylor's senior teammates reportedly discovered Ms Pearce in the hotel premises and raised the alarm.</p>

<p>She had reportedly crossed a golf course and jumped two fences to be reunited with her then boyfriend. </p>

<p>Ms Pearce had just completed her own mandatory self-quarantine period after flying in from Sydney.</p>

<p>Taylor was sent home in the aftermath of the scandal, while his club was fined a total of $50,000 - with $25,000 suspended.</p>

<p>Swans coach John Longmire said the Western Australian-raised AFL talent had been specifically reminded about the strict protocols before he travelled to Perth.</p>

<p>'We talked to Elijah specifically before we left and made sure that we all understand what environment we're going into,' Longmire told Fox Sports AFL 360.</p>

<p>'He still made a very poor choice, he still made a decision to deliberately breach the quarantine and it's unacceptable, and the ramifications are very much suited to what he did.'</p>

<p>'It was a decision that put so much at risk. He's only a young player, he's in his first year of AFL footy, but it was still a terrible decision that has big ramifications.' </p>
