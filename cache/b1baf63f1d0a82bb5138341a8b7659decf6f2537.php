<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kathie Lee Gifford saw both of her children get married this summer.</p>

<p>The first was her 27-year-old daughter Cassidy who tied the knot with Ben Wierda in June and the second was her son Cody who said 'I do' to Erika Brown earlier this month.</p>

<p>The 67-year-old former Today show host - who is promoting her new movie Then Came You - told Entertainment Tonight that though the ceremonies were smaller due to COVID-19, she felt they were 'precious.'   </p>

<p>Proud mother: Kathie Lee Gifford, seen in January, told ET that though her daughter and son had small weddings due to COVID-19, the nuptials were 'precious'</p>

<p>'Neither one of them had the weddings that they had dreamed of because COVID made it impossible,' Kathie Lee said.</p>

<p>But they 'ended up being more beautiful than ever.'</p>

<p>'They were going to be typical big weddings, and you never know how many people to have,' she said. '"Oh, we can't leave them out," and, "Oh, their feelings are gonna be hurt."</p>

<p>'This just got it down to the nitty gritty - who is closest family. It ended up being precious.'</p>

<p>And the star was happy she 'didn't have to plan them.' She added, 'I just had to show up. I was sort of obligated.'</p>

<p>A post shared by  Cassidy Gifford (<?php echo e('@'); ?>cassidygiff) on Feb 14, 2020 at 12:20pm PST</p>

<p>She also said she likes the people her kids chose to marry. </p>

<p>'They're just beautiful human beings, and to see your children happy like that - I know Frank's smiling each day ... we just sensed their dad just smiling,' she said.</p>

<p>Frank is her late husband Frank Gifford who passed away in 2015; he is the father to Cody and Cassie.  </p>

<p>The star told Extra this week that losing Frank was very hard.</p>

<p>'Loss is loss. Everybody's details are different, the power of it is the same. It's real, the deeper you love somebody the greater pain you're going to feel when you lose them,' she remarked.</p>

<p>God gave us a glorious day to celebrate this glorious couple. So grateful.🙏🏻</p>

<p>Loss is also part of the plot that Kathie Lee wrote and stars in, Then Came You. </p>

<p>In the trailer, Kathie Lee is seen flirting with Craig Ferguson. She  said, 'I wrote this movie for Craig, and I tried to harness the chemistry we already naturally, authentically had.'</p>

<p>Craig added, 'Even though it has me in it, it's good. That's what I'm surprised at.'</p>

<p>And Kathie also revealed how she got Elizabeth Hurley to co-star as Craig's glamorous fiancée.</p>

<p>Sad loss: Her late husband is Frank Gifford who passed away in 2015; he is the father to Cody and Cassie. The star told Extra this week that losing Frank was very hard. 'Loss is loss. Everybody's details are different, the power of it is the same.' Seen in 2010</p>

<p>Looks like she has a hit on her hands: Kathie's next project is the film Then Came You with Craig Ferguson, out September 30</p>

<p>'I had given her the script when we were at the Today show and I said, "It's probably unprofessional of me, but I don't want to go through your agent. I don't have time. I'm old. Tick-tock. Let's get this movie made."'</p>

<p>But Hurley did not seem to mind.</p>

<p>Kathie added, 'She said, "I'll get on the plane and read it." She called right away and she said, "I'd love to be in this movie."'</p>

<p>Her kids are all right: Gifford with Cassie and Cody and their new spouses in 2019</p>
