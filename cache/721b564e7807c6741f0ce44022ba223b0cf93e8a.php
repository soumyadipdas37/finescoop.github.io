<p>Joe Cole has backed Gareth Southgate to hand Dominic Calvert-Lewin a first England call-up</p>

<p>The Everton striker netted the first hat-trick of his professional career against West Brom</p>

<p>'What he's done is put himself in the right positions, and arrived at the right time to be there to flick them in,' Cole told BT Sport following Everton's win which sent them top of the Premier League table.</p>

<p>'They're all centre forward goals. It's falling to him and he's tapping them in. He was an old school centre forward, he'd run the channels, and he's now put the finishing touches to his game. </p>

<p>'He's started the season very well. England will be looking. It's a massive opportunity for him [the Wales game]. He's got an old head on his shoulders and you can see he's going to get better and better.'</p>

<p>Fellow BT Sport pundit Owen Hargreaves also praised Calvert-Lewin as a forward who can score all types of goals, and was in awe of his in-game awarness.</p>

<p>Gareth Southgate's England squad are set to face Wales in a friendly at Wembley next month</p>

<p>And former England midfielder Cole believes Calvert-Lewin is now very much in contention</p>

<p>'He's a great young kid. I'm just delighted for him,' Hargreaves added.</p>

<p>'He can just be in the box, he can be a centre forward. They don't have to all be pretty, just get in there. His awareness was terrific.'</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin scored 15 goals in all competitions for Everton last season in 41 appearances, and also recorded an assist.</p>

<p>But he already looks set to surpass last season's tally after opening his account for the current campaign in the Toffees' 1-0 win at Tottenham last weekend. </p>

<p>Owen Hargreaves also praised Calvert-Lewin for his awareness and his variety of goals</p>
