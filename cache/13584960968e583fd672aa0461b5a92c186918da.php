<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Bale's impending return to Tottenham dominates the front pages in Spain with the theme being that Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has got his way in securing his exit.</p>

<p>The relationship between Bale and Zidane had broken down last season which led to the Bernabeu club urgently wanting the Wales star off their books.</p>

<p>And they have accomplished that with his season-long loan worth more than £13million representing an emotional return to his former club.</p>

<p>Gareth Bale's impending return to Tottenham dominates the front pages in Spain on Thursday</p>

<p>'Zidane: He gets his way' was the headline on Marca as his £13m loan to Tottenham was agreed</p>

<p>'Zidane: He has his way' reads the front page headline in Marca which features a photograph of Zidane keeping a beady eye on Bale during a training session.</p>

<p>They add that the deal is close to completion with Real paying almost half of Bale's £500,000-a-week wages during the course of the loan.</p>

<p>Marca also report that Bale's Real team-mate, the left-back Sergio Reguilon, is also poised to sign for Spurs for £27m. Reguilon, who has also been linked with Manchester United, will sign a five-year deal.</p>

<p>AS also lead on the story with the simple headline 'Bye Bale' with a picture of the smiling player heading the ball in training.</p>

<p>They focus on comments by the former Real manager Jose Mourinho, now in charge at Tottenham, that this is the third time he has tried to sign Bale.</p>

<p>Bale will finally play under Jose Mourinho, who admitted he had tried to sign him three times</p>

<p>Bale's relationship with Real manager Zinedine Zidane had deteriorated and led to his exit</p>

<p>'I tried to sign him for Real Madrid which was not possible to do during my time there,' Mourinho said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'But the president followed my instinct and my knowledge and the season I left he brought Gareth to the club.</p>

<p>'There is no secret on that. Even Gareth knows that. But I'm not going to speak about him anymore because he is a Real Madrid player.'</p>

<p>Mourinho also tried to sign Bale when he was Manchester United manager but couldn't prise him away from Real.</p>

<p>Bale rose to superstardom at Tottenham before leaving seven years ago to join Real Madrid</p>

<p>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is said to have played a key role in bringing Bale back to Spurs</p>

<p>Meanwhile, AS calculate that Bale has cost Madrid 23,800 euros (£21,638) for every minute he was on the field last season.</p>

<p>Bale played 1,260 minutes across 20 Real matches in all competitions - 27.5 per cent of the total the team played - scoring three goals and contributing two assists in another campaign plagued by injury.</p>

<p>He featured in just two matches following the post-lockdown restart as his relationship with Zidane deteriorated.</p>
