<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The coronavirus saps men's testosterone and leaves them more susceptible to falling seriously ill as well as robbing them of their sex drive, a study suggests. </p>

<p>Researchers in Turkey analysed levels of the sex hormone in 200 men who were in hospital after they tested positive for Covid-19.</p>

<p>More than half (51 per cent) had developed a condition called hypogonadism in which their bodies did not produce enough testosterone. On average, participants' levels were drained by 30 per cent post-infection to borderline unhealthy levels.</p>

<p>Academics claimed there was a direct correlation between severe illness and lower testosterone levels. </p>

<p>But, even among men who showed no symptoms of the virus at all, two thirds reported having a lowered sex drive – a tell-tale sign of low testosterone. </p>

<p>As well as being key in the development of sex organs and muscle growth, testosterone also helps regulate the immune responses, including fighting viral infections.</p>

<p>Low levels have been linked to an increased risk of dying from the flu, as well as inflammation, heart disease and high blood pressure.</p>

<p>University of Mersin scientists, behind the study, believe Covid-19 makes men more vulnerable to its nastier symptoms by hampering their immune systems. </p>

<p>The coronavirus zaps men's testosterone levels and leaves them more susceptible to falling seriously ill, a study suggests (stock image of a man receiving a swab test for Covid-19 in France)</p>

<p>The study, published in the journal The Aging Male, looked at 232 male patients who  tested positive for coronavirus. </p>

<p>They were divided into three groups - intensive care patients, asymptomatic patients (those with no signs of illness) and those who needed standard hospital care. </p>

<p>Hypogonadism – a condition in which the body doesn’t produce enough testosterone – was found in 113 (51.1 per cent) of the patients. </p>

<p>Researchers from China's CDC and virology specialists studied 98 people diagnosed with H7N9. </p>

<p>Testosterone samples were collected between 2014 and 2017 and compared to people who did not have the disease. </p>

<p>In H7N9 infected men, testosterone levels were seen to be far lower than in their virus-negative close contacts. </p>

<p>The virus-positive men who had low testosterone levels were also very likely to have high inflammatory cytokine levels.</p>

<p>Low testosterone levels was also correlated with a higher chance of death after contracting the virus. </p>

<p>The researchers write: 'This study provides evidence that low testosterone levels in H7N9 influenza infected men correlate with inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses and lethal outcome.'     </p>

<p>Pre-coronavirus testosterone levels were only available for 24 of the participants. </p>

<p>But results showed these patients saw their levels drop by a third, on average, from 458 anograms per deciliter (ng/dl) to 315 ng/dl.</p>

<p>A healthy level of testosterone is usually considered to be above 300 ng/dl.</p>

<p>Lead author Professor Selahittin Çayan, a urologist at the university, said: 'In our study, the mean total testosterone decreased, as the severity of the Covid-19 increased. </p>

<p>'The mean total testosterone level was significantly lower in the ICU group than in the asymptomatic group. </p>

<p>'In addition, the mean total testosterone level was significantly lower in the ICU group than in the standard care group.</p>

<p>'Testosterone is associated with the immune system of respiratory organs, and low levels of testosterone might increase the risk of respiratory infections. </p>

<p>'Low testosterone is also associated with infection-related hospitalisation and all-cause mortality in male in ICU patients, so testosterone treatment may also have benefits beyond improving outcomes for Covid-19.'</p>

<p>The researchers are now calling for all men hospitalised with Covid-19 to have their testosterone levels checked upon admission. </p>

<p>They say testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) - a relatively risk-averse treatment for deficient men - be considered as a treatment option for the virus.</p>

<p>Professor Çayan added: 'It could be recommended that at the time of Covid-19 diagnosis, testosterone levels are also tested. </p>

<p>'In men with low levels of sex hormones who test positive for Covid-19, testosterone treatment could improve their prognosis. More research is needed on this.' </p>

<p>Professor Çayan admits the team's study was limited because it did not include a control group of patients with conditions other than Covid-19 to compare with.</p>

<p>This was due to the restrictions placed on the hospital that they were monitoring the patients in, she said. </p>

<p>It comes after a study in May found men with low testosterone levels who contract Covid-19 are at far greater risk of dying from the virus.</p>

<p>Medics at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany looked at 45 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU.</p>

<p>Thirty-five were men and 10 were women, with seven patients requiring oxygen and 33 of them needing ventilation. Nine men and three women died.</p>

<p>Hormone levels of each patient were assessed on their first day in ICU, before they had received any invasive procedures.</p>

<p>Samples from the COVID-19 patients were tested for 12 hormones, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.</p>

<p>Of the male COVID-19 patients sent to ICU at the German hospital, more than two thirds (68.6 per cent) recorded low levels of testosterone.</p>

<p>In contrast, the majority of female patients (60 per cent) had elevated testosterone levels.</p>

<p>The coronavirus may cause men's testicles to swell and impair their ability to have children, doctors have warned. </p>

<p>More than a dozen symptoms of Covid-19 have been reported since the pandemic began, including a dry cough, fever and loss of taste or smell.</p>

<p>But medics in the US have told men to be extra vigilant of the virus after a 37-year-old patient was taken to A&amp;E with swelling and 'discomfort' in his scrotum.</p>

<p>The patient had already been suffering from the more common signs of Covid, including a cough and fever, for a week prior to going to hospital.  </p>

<p>Doctors from the San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium in Texas said the virus had damaged his spermatocytes, which keep sperm healthy.</p>

<p>They warned the damage caused by Covid-19 could have 'a future impact on male fertility'.</p>

<p>Similar reports of testicular pain in Covid-19 patients have been reported previously but there has been no real research into the link.   </p>

<p>Doctors who treated him believe the virus entered the body using ACE2 receptors on Leydig cells, which are present in the testes.</p>

<p>Writing in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine, they admit that such cases are rare.</p>

<p>But they hope raising awareness about them will help other medics 'identify this disease at the earliest junction and trigger appropriate treatment, quarantine, and fertility follow-up.'</p>

<p>The patient spent a night in hospital before being discharged and prescribed antibiotics and painkillers. </p>

<p>His pain is said to have eased slightly but the case report did not say whether his condition improved in the weeks after.</p>
