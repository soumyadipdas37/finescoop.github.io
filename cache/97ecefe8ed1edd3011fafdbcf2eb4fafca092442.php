<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The EFL, West Ham and Hull City insist that all coronavirus protocols were satisfied ahead of their Carabao Cup clash on Tuesday night - despite Hammers boss David Moyes and two players testing positive before the game. </p>

<p>Issa Diop and Josh Cullen had both been named by Moyes in the starting line up ahead of their 5-1 victory, before they were told at 6.20pm of their positive tests. </p>

<p>All three left the ground immediately, with the pair replaced in the line-up by Harrison Ashby and Jack Wilshere on an updated team-sheet at 6.47pm. </p>

<p>West Ham and Hull City both insist that protocols were satisfied ahead of their fixture </p>

<p>Having taken everything into account, medical staff at both the Premier League club and League One club decided it was safe to go ahead, with all parties preferring that to abandoning the tie. </p>

<p>Despite the tests taking place on Monday, the clubs were satisfied that there had been no further risk to any West Ham players, with staff following the EFL matchday travelling protocol.</p>

<p>In section 24, which relates to travel, rules state that clubs ensure staff travel to the stadium either by a car carrying no other players or staff, or by coach, train or plane where social distancing measures are adhered to. </p>

<p>With the game taking place a the London Stadium, West Ham stars and staff all made their own way to the ground.  </p>

<p>West Ham had offered to pay for testing for Hull City players, but the League One club declined.</p>

<p>Hammers boss David Moyes was informed that he had tested positive for Covid-19 at 6.20pm</p>

<p>When asked why, boss Grant McCann explained: 'Because we didn’t want to create anything.  </p>

<p>'We decided against it, we felt we were fine. No one is showing any symptoms or anything like that. We always monitor the players’ well-being.</p>

<p>'We can get tested wherever we want. We are following the guidelines of the EFL. Just because somebody offers you free tests it doesn’t mean you do it.</p>

<p>'We are comfortable with what we are doing. We are monitoring the players at every level.'</p>

<p>It is a different approach from Leyton Orient, who saw their clash with Tottenham called off on Tuesday after 10 members of their squad tested positive having accepted testing from the Premier League side.  </p>

<p>Hull boss Grant McCann defended the League One side's decision not to accept testing </p>

<p>Confirming the positive tests, West Ham co-owner David Sullivan spoke to talkSPORT to explain the rigirous protocol the Hammers went through ahead of the game. </p>

<p>'What we do in the Premier League, every team we are tested three times a week during pre-season and we are now tested once a week so we were all tested on Monday,' he said.</p>

<p>'The results came through at literally 6:30-6:45pm last night and unfortunately two of the players tested positive, so the manager had to juggle the the team with who was there and then had to go home and self-isolate, as did the two players.</p>

<p>'And then the whole team will be retested today to see if we have any more casualties. All the players are fine, I mean they have slightly sore throats.</p>

<p>'The manager actually was on fine form this morning, he has had a slight sore throat for a couple of days but he put it down to the fact that he shouts a lot.</p>

<p>'He is a pretty hands on manager, coach and he is on the training pitch, screaming and shouting. And he said look "I do get a sore throat occasionally, so I thought nothing of it". It’s just a minor sore throat and hopefully it doesn’t get worse.'</p>

<p>David Sullivan spoke to talkSPORT, stating that some members of staff did have sore throats </p>
