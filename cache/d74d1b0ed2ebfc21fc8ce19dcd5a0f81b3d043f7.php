<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Brisbane teenager accused of releasing a sex tape involving Brisbane NRL player Kotoni Staggs says she never intended for the video to go public.</p>

<p>McKenzie Lorraine Robinson, 18, appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday facing a single charge of distributing a prohibited visual recording.</p>

<p>The woman from Brisbane's Newstead suburb allegedly shared the recording of Mr Staggs between June 14 and August 5 without his consent, according to court documents.</p>

<p>Outside court, defence lawyer Jason Jacobson insisted the teenager did not post the video on social media.</p>

<p>McKenzie Lorraine Robinson, 18, appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court  (pictured) on Thursday facing a single charge of distributing a prohibited visual recording</p>

<p>'It was not Ms Robinson that made this private video go public,' he told reporters.</p>

<p>'That was never intended by her and she very much regrets that it did and she very much regrets the impact that it caused for Mr Staggs.</p>

<p>'There is an explanation as to how this happened and that will be put to the court at a later date.'</p>

<p>Despite the embarrassment for the Bronco, Staggs was cleared of any wrongdoing by the NRL's integrity unit after the video was released.</p>

<p>Robinson's case was adjourned for mention on September 30.</p>

<p>She was granted bail on her own undertaking.</p>

<p>Robinson reportedly messaged the Brisbane Broncos star on Instagram before the pair met up and slept together soon after. </p>

<p>Robinson allegedly asked the 21-year-old if she could film the sexual encounter on her mobile phone, saying she could be 'trusted', according to The Courier Mail. </p>

<p>The teenager allegedly shared the recording of NRL star Kotoni Staggs (pictured) between June 14 and August 5 without his consent, according to court documents</p>

<p>Staggs alleges Robinson, who describes herself as a 'holistic wellness coach,' repeatedly called and messaged him following their rendezvous.</p>

<p>She allegedly also asked the NRL star if he would have a threesome with her and a friend. </p>

<p>McKenzie Robinson was on charged last month with distributing a prohibited visual recording after allegedly releasing her and Staggs' sex tape</p>

<p>Staggs is believed to have asked Robinson to stop contacting him weeks before the video was released. </p>

<p>He made a complaint to police after the video surfaced, claiming it was released without his consent. </p>

<p>The 18-year-old has shared several scantily-clad photos of herself on social media, where she writes that she is 'dedicated to empowerment and love'.</p>

<p>'I am a (sic) empath and have a huge high energy connection to the universe through crystals, meditation, aromatherapy and oracle readings,' a post on her Instagram reads. </p>

<p>Staggs' lawyer Dave Garratt  previously told the Courier Mail his client praised Queensland Police for their handling of the mater.</p>

<p>'Mr Staggs is extremely embarrassed and disappointed that his private life has been brought into the public domain,' Mr Garratt said.</p>

<p>'It has caused embarrassment to him, his family and the club and he is hoping to put this behind him now and leave it with the authorities.'</p>
