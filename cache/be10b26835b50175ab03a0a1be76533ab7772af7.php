<p>'We fought for our family because Sean and I almost got divorced ... I cheated on Sean,' she said. 'We separated. I took the kids. He was with someone else too.</p>

<p>'We were separated, we were in two different homes. I went to Hawaii; I took the kids, I enrolled them in school. I told Sean I was done. I just didn’t want to be a single mom anymore. He traveled 25 days a month.'</p>

<p>'He had quit his job,' she said. 'He was the president of a very successful company. He sold his shares and he walked away and he became a stay-at-home dad for like eight years. He said, "I would rather choose you guys than my work."'</p>
