<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jose Mourinho has suffered a double setback in the transfer market as Tottenham look set to miss out on signing Patson Daka and Arkadiusz Milik. </p>

<p>Red Bull Salzburg forward Daka has turned down the opportunity to join the north London outfit this summer, according to the Evening Standard. </p>

<p>Freddie Kanoute works as the 21-year-old's agent and the former Spurs striker has told his former club that Daka would like to stay in Austria. </p>

<p>The Zambian registered 27 goals and 12 assists in 45 matches during the 2019-20 campaign and  has already got off to a flying start this season; scoring four in Salzburg's 10-0 victory over Bregenz in the OFB Cup.</p>

<p>Daka's current deal expires in 2024, meaning a lucrative offer would be required to lure the striker away from the Red Bull Arena. </p>

<p>He had forged a potent partnership with Erling Haaland before the Norwegian moved to Borussia Dortmund, and it is unlikely Salzburg will be prepared to sell their leading marksman for the second woindow in succession. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tottenham have also hit a stumbling block in their attempt to sign Arkadiusz Milik from Napoli.  </p>

<p>The Poland international has just one year left to run on his current contract, but Napoli still value their player at 30 million euros (£27.6m), a price Spurs are not willing to pay.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old striker scored 14 goals in 35 club appearances last term.</p>
