<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Geneva is set to introduce 'the world's highest minimum wage' which will equate to £41,430 ($53,370) a year – around £3,500 ($4,510) a month. </p>

<p>The Swiss city, which has a voter population of around 500,000, held a referendum with two-thirds backing the new measure.  </p>

<p>The alterations, which had been rejected by voters twice before in both 2011 and 2014, will now come into effect from October 17. </p>

<p>Geneva (pictured) is set to introduce 'the world's highest minimum wage' which will equate to £41,430 a year – around £3,500 a month</p>

<p>Geneva's new minimum wage will equate to just under £19.50 ($25.12) per hour - this is how it compares: </p>

<p>Australia: £11 ($14.17) an hour</p>

<p>France: £9.28 ($11.95) an hour </p>

<p>UK: £8.72 ($11.23) an hour </p>

<p>United States: £5.63 ($7.25) an hour</p>

<p>Geneva is the world's second most expensive city, according to a cost-of-living index compiled by Expatistan.</p>

<p>But it was hit particularly hard by the outbreak of Covid-19 due to its reliance on revenue from tourists and business visitors.  </p>

<p>It has suffered growing coronavirus-linked poverty as families have become increasingly reliant on provisions from food banks - with queues of more than half a mile long forming at the peak of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Michel Charrat is the president of the Groupement Transfrontalier Europeen - an organization that represents cross-border workers in France and Switzerland.</p>

<p>He told the Guardian that the vote represented a 'mark of solidarity' across the economic divide in Geneva.</p>

<p>Mr Charrat said: 'Covid has shown that a certain section of the Swiss population cannot live in Geneva.'</p>

<p>He added the measure would benefit 30,000 low-paid workers - with two-thirds of them being women.</p>

<p>The new minimum wage was initially proposed by the Left-wing parties in Switzerland who argued that its introduction was the best way to address the rising cost of living.</p>

<p>Those on the Right had instead suggested adopting a limit on immigration from EU member-states as a way of tackling the crisis - but voters rejected this proposal.</p>

<p>The city's new minimum wage will be set at just under £19.50 ($25.12) per hour. </p>

<p>This is more than triple that in the United States, which operates at £5.63 ($7.25) per hour, and more than double the basic hourly rate in the United Kingdom of £8.72 ($11.23).</p>
