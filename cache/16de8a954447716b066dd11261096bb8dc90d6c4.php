<p>Scientists analysed blood samples from 200,000 Britons aged between 40 and 70.</p>

<p>They found that 2,000 of them had very high blood sugar levels, indicating they had diabetes, but had not yet been diagnosed with the condition.</p>

<p>This suggests that 1 per cent of the UK – over half a million people – could be living with type 2 diabetes without knowing it.</p>

<p>The study by the University of Exeter suggested that a national screening programme should be brought in to improve diagnosis.</p>

<p>Experts said symptoms of type 2 diabetes, which include frequently going to the toilet, being thirsty and feeling tired, are easy to miss, especially during the early stages. </p>

<p>Co-author Dr Katherine Young, said: 'As people can have type 2 diabetes for many years without symptoms, diagnosis may be delayed, increasing the risk of complications.</p>

<p>Britain's obesity epidemic has led to soaring levels of type 2 diabetes. Two-thirds of adults are either obese or overweight, one of the highest rates in the Western world [File photo]</p>

<p>'Our study shows that population-level screening could identify cases of type 2 diabetes far earlier and potentially reduce complications.' </p>

<p>Diabetes is mostly diagnosed by measuring the level of HbA1c, a haemoglobin which is chemically linked to sugar, in the bloodstream.</p>

<p>Dr Young said: 'We identified that screening by HbA1c would have identified an extra 1 per cent of a population aged 40-70 years as having undiagnosed diabetes.'</p>

<p>She added: 'This screening diagnosis would have been approximately two years before a clinical diagnosis was made.' </p>

<p>The authors analysed blood samples from over 200,000 patients on the UK Biobank database and compared their blood sugar levels to GP records.</p>

<p>Men over the age of 60, especially if they were obese, were more likely to have undiagnosed diabetes than women, the researchers found.</p>

<p>Britain's obesity epidemic has led to soaring levels of type 2 diabetes. Two-thirds of adults are either obese or overweight, one of the highest rates in the Western world.</p>

<p>More than 4million people in the UK now have diabetes, compared with just 1.8million in 1998.</p>

<p>Around 90 per cent of people with diabetes have type 2, which is mostly caused by obesity.</p>

<p>Diabetes occurs when blood sugar levels rise to risky heights and can lead to fatal complications, including amputations, sight loss, stroke and heart disease.</p>

<p>Type 1 diabetes is an unpreventable autoimmune disease that usually develops in childhood, but type 2 is mostly caused by poor diet.</p>

<p>Dr Faye Riley, of Diabetes UK, said: 'Type 2 diabetes can go undetected for years and this research flags that all too often, people can have the condition but not know it.'</p>

<p>The research was presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.</p>
