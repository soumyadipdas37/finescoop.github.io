<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Topshop has been charged with health and safety failings after a 10-year-old schoolboy was crushed to death by a 'wobbly' 3ft queue barrier. </p>

<p>Reading Borough Council is taking action against the retailer and its parent company Arcadia, as well as barrier fitter Stoneforce and manufacturers Realm over the incident in the Reading branch of Topshop in February 2017.</p>

<p>Kaden Reddick, of Burghfield, West Berkshire, had been running around the shop while his sister, mother and grandmother were shopping for jeans.</p>

<p>The structure toppled and hit him in the face, causing devastating injuries, the hearing at Berkshire Coroner's Court in Reading was told. He later died in hospital.</p>

<p>Seconds before the accident he and his sister had been squabbling about sweets while his grandmother Deborah was paying at the till, the inquest heard.   </p>

<p>An inquest recorded his death as an accident, but revealed failings from staff over what was called a 'wobble test' of the barrier.</p>

<p>Kaden Reddick, 10, had been running around the shop while his sister, mother and grandmother were shopping for jeans. The structure toppled and hit him in the face, causing devastating fatal injuries, the hearing at Berkshire Coroner's Court in Reading was told</p>

<p>Staff across the country were told to test barriers after another incident in Glasgow where a 10-year-girl was seriously injured, just days before Kaden's death. </p>

<p>In delivering the verdict at the inquest the jury foreman said 'evidence shows its fixings were inadequate to hold his weight'. </p>

<p>However, the jury of eight men and three women decided that although the 180kg queue barrier was 'inadequately fastened,' Kaden's death was accidental. </p>

<p>Reading Borough Council decided to take legal action on health and safety grounds after the Crown Prosecution Service refused to pursue corporate manslaughter charges, following the conclusion to an investigation by Thames Valley Police in November 2018.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Dave Turton, of Thames Valley Police, said at the time: 'We have carried out a thorough investigation into this tragic incident.</p>

<p>'Following a review of the investigation by the Crown Prosecution Service no charges have been made in relation to the case as it was established that there was not a realistic prospect of conviction for the offence of corporate manslaughter.'</p>

<p>A council spokesman said: 'Following investigation on health and safety grounds, Reading Borough Council can confirm that charges have now been laid against Arcadia, Topshop, Stoneforce (the fitters) and Realm (the manufacturers) under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.</p>

<p>'The laying of these charges follows the Coroner's conclusion in March this year that the tragic death of Kaden Reddick in February 2017 was accidental, arising from an inadequately fixed barrier causing a traumatic head injury.</p>

<p>Reading Borough Council is taking action against Topshop and Arcadia, as well as fitters Stoneforce and manufacturers Realm over the incident in the Reading branch February 2017 </p>

<p>'The charges mean the council can make no further comment on the case at this time. Our thoughts remain with the family and we kindly ask that everyone continues to respect their privacy.' </p>

<p>Following the inquest in March, Kaden's family said: 'Kaden was a very special little boy, he was a loving, cheeky, energetic child. A wonderful son, brother and friend to many and is greatly missed by all who knew him.</p>

<p>'Kaden doted on his siblings and loved creating memories with them, no matter what activity they were doing. He loved his adventures, whether it was playing in the woods or his family holidays abroad.</p>

<p>'Kaden was kind, considerate and would always take care of those smaller than him, though had his own mind and knew what he wanted out of life.</p>

<p>'Since Kaden's death the world feels empty, there is a huge hole in our hearts that can't be filled and as a family all we can do is cherish the memories we have.</p>

<p>'We would like to thank everyone that has supported us over the last three years, the people that contributed to Kaden's immediate care, Thames Valley Police and Co-op Legal Services.'</p>
