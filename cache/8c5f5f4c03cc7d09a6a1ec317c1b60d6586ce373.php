<p>A home cook has wowed the internet after sharing a very simple three-ingredient recipe to make a cheesy garlic pizza at home</p>

<p>The Australian woman used just three products she purchased from Aldi - including pizza bases, mozzarella cheese and the retailer's popular $2.99 garlic dip</p>

<p>'So I've seen so many people commenting about the garlic dip so I thought I'd try it tonight for a garlic pizza and it was delicious,' she wrote in a Facebook group.</p>

<p>'Hubby is away so I decided to buy a base (hubby is Italian and hates store-bought bases) and it was a big hit with the kids and I - perfect to go with our pasta.'</p>

<p>The woman said while homemade pizza bases are always 'better', she said the pre-made versions are great to prepare for her kids when her husband isn't home.</p>

<p>'Homemade is better but I was being lazy. These were pretty tasty though. I'd buy again when he's not home of course,' she said, laughing. </p>
