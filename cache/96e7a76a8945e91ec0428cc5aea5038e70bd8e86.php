<p>'Can't believe you have been gone 17 years': Kaley Cuoco shared a throwback picture with John Ritter on the 17th anniversary of his shock death of an aortic dissection</p>

<p>Kaley, who played one of the title teenage daughters on the sitcom, could be seen making a funny face as she posed with John for the black and white picture.</p>

<p>John starred opposite Katey Sagal as the parents of three teenagers played by Kaley, Amy Davidson and Martin Spanjers.</p>

<p>Season two was being made when John died on September 11, 2003, only six days before he would have celebrated his 55th birthday. Kaley was 17-years-old at the time.</p>

<p>One day before the show restarted filming in the wake of John's death, Kaley tearfully remembered him in an on-set interview with Entertainment Tonight.</p>

<p>As seen on the show: They co-starred on the sitcom 8 Simple Rules...For Dating My Teenage Daughter which he was rehearsing when he was taken ill and hospitalized, dying hours later</p>

<p>'We always got together in the back, and we got in a little circle and we always, we did, John would look at us, all of us, and we'd do a prayer, and he'd look us in the eye, John would say: "I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you,"' she said.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago in a Reelz documentary about John she emotionally recalled their last-ever conversation, which took place in her dressing room.</p>

<p>'I go: "Hi!" I go: "Are you okay? I heard you're sick." He goes: "I'm okay, I just wanna talk to you for a second." And I was like: "Okay," and he sat down on the couch. He goes: "I love you,"' she shared, trying not to cry.</p>

<p>'And I was like: "I love you too, silly man!" He goes: "No, I want you to know I love you." I said: "I love you too." He goes: "That's it!" and he gave me a hug and that was the last I saw of him,' she said.</p>

<p>Who's who: John (center) starred opposite Katey Sagal as the parents of three teenagers played by Kaley (left), Amy Davidson (right) and Martin Spanjers</p>

<p>He was survived by his second wife Amy Yasbeck and his four children Jason, 40, Carly, 38, Tyler, 35, and Noah, 22.</p>

<p>After the Three's Company icon died the show killed off his character Paul and was eventually renamed 8 Simple Rules.</p>

<p>The sitcom managed to last through the end of its third season at which point it was canceled by ABC after plunging in the ratings.</p>

<p>Tragedy: Season two was being made when John died on September 11, 2003, only six days before he would have celebrated his 55th birthday</p>

<p>'I truly believe if John had still been around we probably would have gone on for a long time,' Kaley told Yahoo! Entertainment this year.</p>

<p>She shared that 'even though I only spent a year with him, that changed the course of my personal life and my career and I knew I wanted to make people laugh forever after working with John. That year really changed me in every way.'</p>

<p>Kaley went on to achieve global fame on the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory and Katey won critical acclaim on the FX drama Sons Of Anarchy. </p>
