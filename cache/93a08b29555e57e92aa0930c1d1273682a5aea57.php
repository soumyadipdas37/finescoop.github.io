<p>During her Wednesday outing, the reality TV star looked every inch the doting mom to her six-month-old daughter Dove and son Cruz, five.  </p>

<p>The mother-of-three, who also shares a seven-year-old daughter with husband Edwin Arroyave, could be seen holding hands with her little boy on a leisurely walk.  </p>

<p>Strolling: Teddi Mellencamp enjoyed some quality time with her two of her children, following the explosive reunion of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills on Bravo last night</p>

<p>The Teddi Tea Pod podcast host looked fresh-faced, as she slipped into a pair of form-fitting leggings and and a sweatshirt for her Wednesday excursion.  </p>

<p>She kept her infant, who recently underwent surgery for a skull condition called lambdoid craniosynostosis, safely fastened to her midriff in a front-facing baby carrier. </p>

<p>This appears to be one of Mellencamp's first walks with Dove since her neurosurgery, as the 'strong and resilient' newborn navigates her post-op recovery. </p>

<p>Later in the evening, Teddi cuddled up with her little ones and promised she would answer questions from her fans about the The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' explosive reunion in the morning. </p>

<p>On Thursday, she revealed the 'hardest part about filming the show is 'watching the others' confessionals if they're like talking cr*ap about you' and online trolling.  </p>

<p>She also said she would have 'preferred' the reunion happened 'in person,' but 'it was actually a lot easier to see everyone via Zoom than the couches.'  </p>

<p>Last night's episode saw Erika Janye, 49, get heated with Wild Things actress Denise Richards as the group once again talked about who said what at Kyle Richard's outdoor barbecue. </p>

<p>Once again they discussed how Denise, 49, is just as potty mouthed as the rest of the cast, after she brought up the claim that her husband Aaron Phypers, 47, has a big penis. </p>

<p>Teddi added, 'I think the part that's frustrating is your inability to say, 'You know what, yeah, I was kind of trying to make you look like a**holes and that's why I kept joking about it.' </p>

<p>Together again: The cast gathered virtually for the season 10 reunion due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Denise promised that she hadn't kept bringing the incident up, and only spoke to Teddi and Sutton Stracke 'mom-to-mom' to discuss how awkward things could get with kids. </p>

<p>Erika and Kyle noted that when the barbecue episode aired, Denise's daughter Sami, 15, looked amused by the conversation, and they hadn't heard anything else since. </p>

<p>Erika had taken heat for saying on the show that Denise's kids probably knew about threesomes, and clarified at the reunion that she'd simply meant teens understood such things. </p>

<p>Still resentful: Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave still resented Sutton for once saying her pregnancy was 'ugh.'</p>

<p>'Stop the false outrage,' she urged Denise. </p>

<p>Denise acknowledged that she had gotten upset when she heard the remark, to which Erika replied, 'Of course you did. It was convenient for you.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kyle previously apologized after she was filmed calling Denise a 'ragamuffin' and the pair have not been on good terms since Denise's pizza party. </p>

<p>At home: Andy hosted the reunion remotely as the women aired their grievances </p>

<p>Teddi still resented Sutton for once saying her pregnancy was 'ugh.'</p>

<p>'Something I'm so grateful for and I think is such a miracle, you're kind of mocking?' Teddi asked. 'Like, eff off.'</p>

<p>'We all have insecurities, and I think mine came out at the beginning,' Sutton admitted. 'I did kind of look like an a<strong>hole. I looked like a snotty a</strong>hole. But that's not who I am.'</p>

<p>The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills Reunion part two will air next week on Bravo.</p>
