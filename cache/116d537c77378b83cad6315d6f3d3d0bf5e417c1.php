<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lockdown saw sales of loungewear soar through the roof, with thousands of shoppers swapping their jeans for a jersey trouser. Once reserved for the gym, tracksuit bottoms or joggers are now a confirmed wardrobe staple.</p>

<p>Not only are they the comfiest clothes around, but just scroll through your Instagram and you'll be sure to see them as a fashion choice too. </p>

<p>Whether you're looking to invest in a pair for chilling around the house or want to style them up, this pair from Crazy Girls is a great choice. Currently working their way up Amazon's bestseller's list, the £13.95 tracksuit bottoms are an affordable basic. </p>

<p>The Crazy Girls Oversized Jogging Bottoms are proving to be a big hit with Amazon shoppers who have called them 'very cosy', 'super comfortable' and 'a must buy'</p>

<p>The Crazy Girls Oversized Jogging Bottoms are available in 13 colours, including baby pink, lilac and cream. Or you can keep things classic with the on-trend grey or black. </p>

<p>Ticking boxes for comfort as well as style, the joggers have an oversized fit, making them extra comfortable to lounge around it. Elasticated at the ankles to create a flattering tapered shape and at the waist to give extra support, it's not hard to see why they have become the work-from-home trouser of choice. </p>

<p>Brands like Topshop and &amp;Other Stories have struggled to keep their basic grey joggers in stock. While perhaps not of the same quality as more expensive versions, the Crazy Girls joggers seem to have had similar popularity with shoppers raving about their comfort and style. </p>

<p>One reviewer wrote: 'Love these joggers, they're super baggy just how I like them! They fit really well and are super comfy, I'm a size 10 and these are great! I will be buying again in different colours'.</p>

<p>'This is a MUST BUY,' raved another shopper. 'The quality is absolutely fantastic! The inside is a nice fleece material and it's so comfy I could wear it everyday. It's not too small so there's room and it's the perfect size.'</p>

<p>Dressed up or simply worn around the house, jogging bottoms have proved to be a top fashion trend in 2020 </p>

<p>A third added: 'Very cozy, soft and have great shape to them. Ordered a navy pair to make sure I liked them, then ordered in two more colours. Again, fit perfectly.' </p>

<p>While wearing the jogging bottoms out of the house may not be a trend to suit everyone - the oversized fit means they aren't the most flattering - there's no doubt that these are supremely comfortable and a great addition to you loungewear basics.    </p>

<p>They have been snapped up by shoppers of all sizes, but the general consensus is to size down.  </p>

<p>One shopper wrote: 'These just arrived and I love them already! I usually wear a size 12 but based on other reviews ordered a size 8-10 and do not regret, they fit perfectly and are super comfortable with fantastic stretch. </p>

<p>'They are soft, thick and look exactly how I hoped they would. Will likely order another pair for when these are in the wash!'</p>

<p>Another added: 'Just the oversized fit I wanted - I'm usually UK 6-8 and got XS. So comfy - don't want to take them off! Fleecy lining, some of which shed very slightly at first, but didn't bother me, they're so soft and once most of the extra fluff came off they're fine.' </p>
