<p>The striker had missed out on the pre-season training camp in York, and Newcastle refused to comment on his absence.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understood, however, that the club had been trying to move him on and believed his future was away from St James' Park.  </p>

<p>'Yoshi is a smashing lad. It hasn’t gone as well for him as I’m sure he’d have liked but he’s the ultimate pro,' Steve Bruce said last week. 'He probably needs to go somewhere and play. It’s not healthy that he’s not going to be involved.'</p>
