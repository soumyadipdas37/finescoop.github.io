<p>Albion boss Slaven Bilic has identified Grant as his top target to improve his attack, with the club putting together a deal that could eventually be worth up to £15m for the 22-year-old.</p>

<p>Grant has scored 23 goals in 51 starts for Huddersfield and is considered one of the most promising strikers outside the top flight.</p>
