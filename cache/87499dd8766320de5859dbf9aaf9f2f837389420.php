<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United players believe Dean Henderson is closing in on David De Gea's position as first-choice goalkeeper.</p>

<p>De Gea has started the season as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's No 1 in the Premier League following Henderson's return to Old Trafford in the summer following two successful season loan spells at Sheffield United.</p>

<p>But Sportsmail sources have described the battle to be United's recognised first-choice as 'very tight' while there is a sense among members of the United squad that Henderson is applying mounting pressure on De Gea.</p>

<p>De Gea has started both of Manchester United's league matches, conceding five goals</p>

<p>Having come through the United academy, Henderson made his United debut in the 3-0 win over Luton in the Carabao Cup last week and is expected to be given a fresh opportunity in Wednesday's clash against Brighton in the same competition.</p>

<p>And another assured performance at the AMEX Stadium against Premier League opposition will push Henderson closer towards his ambition of overtaking De Gea.</p>

<p>Speaking earlier this month, Henderson heavily hinted that he wouldn't to be satisfied with a role on the United bench this season, saying: 'It wouldn't be clever for me to sit around and not play football, I don't think it would help any parties at all.</p>

<p>Henderson will start United's EFL Cup tie away at Brighton this week with De Gea in his sights</p>

<p>'You can get many things from training, and obviously learn off someone like David himself and the other goalkeepers and goalkeeper coaches. But I don't think there's any substitute for game-time.'Â </p>

<p>Elsewhere, it is understood United are preparing to activate a one year extension option on midfielder Paul Pogba's contract.</p>

<p>The World Cup winner is approaching the final 18 months of his current contract - but can trigger an extra year on his deal to protect his value.</p>

<p>United, it is understood, are still to formally discuss a longer extension to Pogba's contract but know they have a safety net of extending his existing deal.</p>
