<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fulham owner Tony Khan has apologised to the club's fans and promised new signings following the 3-0 Premier League home drubbing by Aston Villa on Monday.</p>

<p>Khan watched manager Scott Parker rue his side's third successive defeat since their promotion before taking to Twitter to reveal his struggle to bring in players to boost Fulham's frail defence. </p>

<p>The businessman said: 'I apologise to Fulham supporters for our performance tonight.</p>

<p>Fulham boss Scott Parker (right) was left ruing his side's defensive woes after their latest loss</p>

<p>The 3-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa caused owner Tony Khan to issue an apology on Twitter</p>

<p>Khan continued to apologise and pledged that the playing squad would enhance their efforts</p>

<p>'We've looked to add centre-backs since [winning promotion at] Wembley. I'm sorry we haven't yet as two got COVID-19 and we lost a free we thought was close and had another issue with a fourth.</p>

<p>'I promise players in and better efforts from this squad. I should and will apologise repeatedly for that performance.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, everybody. We all need to do a better job. Everyone at the club for the past year worked really hard to get the team up and now we need to work significantly harder to stay up. I promise better efforts than today.'</p>

<p>The Cottagers have conceded 10 goals in three Premier League matches this season, losing 3-0 at home to Arsenal on the opening day before Leeds made the most of their defensive shortcomings in a 4-3 thriller. </p>

<p>Fulham are bottom of the Premier League on goal difference after the 3-0 defeat to Aston Villa</p>

<p>Goals by Jack Grealish and Conor Hourihane left them with a mountain to climb after just 15 minutes in their latest defeat, with Tyrone Mings all but ending the contest just after half-time.</p>

<p>Boss Parker said he had not been aware of the details of Khan's failed attempts to bolster his options.</p>

<p>The rookie coach admitted: 'I wouldn't know. I honestly wouldn't know. I think the people in the places to be at this football club make them decisions.</p>

<p>'I've highlighted where I think we need to improve. I've highlighted that straight after Wembley. Not just defenders, just where we need to improve in this team.</p>

<p>Parker and Khan have been keen to improve their options since winning promotion last month</p>

<p>'I think in terms of defending we weren't good enough tonight and we've not been good enough for the first three games this season.</p>

<p>'I think we all know we need to address that. It was an area we've certainly brought up and it's an area that everyone at the football club hopefully can see as well, to be fair.</p>

<p>'I thought we played very, very well for large parts, but the first time they came into our box they scored, and the second time they scored another goal and you just can't give up goals like we have and expect to win games in this division.</p>

<p>'I think you see that at the other end for them. We got up to their goal pretty well but they defended it.'</p>
