<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>His reign at the BBC began with a headline-grabbing decision — to overturn the ludicrous ban on singing Rule, Britannia at the Last Night Of The Proms — that had the metropolitan luvvies who make up the Beeb hierarchy spluttering into their soya milk lattes last week.</p>

<p>Tim Davie, the new director-general, is also targeting unfunny Leftie woke comedians who get too much air time, and BBC staff who fail the impartiality test in their reporting and presenting.</p>

<p>Now it looks as if Davie's next big move is a management reshuffle — and I hear that a demotion for James Purnell, a former Cabinet minister under Gordon Brown turned BBC apparatchik, is on the cards.</p>

<p>Tim Davie (pictured) the new director-general, is also targeting unfunny Leftie woke comedians who get too much air time, and BBC staff who fail the impartiality test in their reporting and presenting</p>

<p>Purnell, who as Director, Radio &amp; Education, is paid an astonishing £315,000, is not sympathetic to Davie, insiders say.</p>

<p>Is it just a coincidence then, that his radio responsibilities have been handed to new Chief Content Officer Charlotte Moore?</p>

<p>In truth, it's yet another humiliation for Purnell. When his name was floated as a contender for director-general, Downing Street — in the form of Boris Johnson's top aide Dominic Cummings — let it be known that such an appointment would not be welcome.</p>

<p>If Purnell were to decide that his future with Auntie was somewhat limited and depart, Davie, who unusually for a BBC executive stood to be a Tory councillor in the 1990s, would shed few tears.</p>

<p> Kneeling at the feet of Mr Neil</p>

<p> Davie sees Andrew Neil, a forensic political interviewer and scourge of the woke, as key</p>

<p>Andrew Neil, whose headline-making, self-titled political show on BBC2 was dropped by bosses this year, recalls a previous defenestration by the Corporation.</p>

<p>'The moment somebody called Bob Shennan took over Radio 5 he called me to say he didn't want that sort of probing stuff on a Sunday morning and was canning my breakfast show. </p>

<p>First and last time I ever heard from him. I think he's naturally gone on to greater things at the BBC,' Neil observes acidly.</p>

<p>Indeed. Shennan now pockets a £276,000 salary as BBC Group Managing Director. </p>

<p>No doubt he'll be delighted to hear that Tim Davie is desperately trying to woo back Neil as part of his campaign to see off Auntie's Left-wing bias. </p>

<p>Embattled Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is proud of the fact that he's one of the few Cabinet ministers to have been educated at a comprehensive.</p>

<p>Peter Ashton, who taught Williamson at the school in Scarborough, was asked by LBC's Nick Ferrari what grades he'd give his most notorious pupil now?</p>

<p>'I'd give him a high grade for effort,' he said diplomatically. 'As for attainment, that's always the difficult one . . .' </p>

<p>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps conducted a series of media interviews last week on the need for people to get back to work in their offices. </p>

<p>Where did he do the interviews? From home!</p>

<p>Former Tory Cabinet minister Esther McVey, due to marry fellow Tory MP Philip Davies this month, is having to scale down celebrations because of Covid. </p>

<p>'You wait 52 years to get married and along comes coronavirus and knocks you off course,' she says on social media. </p>

<p>'I say to Philip, 'Maybe the big guy in the sky is trying to tell us something.' </p>

<p>I also say, 'Maybe it's my lucky escape.' But I'm afraid Philip doesn't always appreciate my dark humour.'</p>

<p>BBC London presenter Riz Lateef</p>

<p>Why is Boris Johnson so keen that lead BBC London presenter Riz Lateef, right, fronts the Government's planned televised daily press briefings? </p>

<p>'Boris used to flirt with Riz when he was interviewed as London Mayor,' says a pal. </p>

<p>'She was professional but acted as if she was flattered.' </p>

<p>Maybe the PM's fiancee, Carrie Symonds, will have some thoughts about that. </p>

<p>Rory Bremner is not convinced by Boris Johnson's ringing declaration of support last week for the HS2 high-speed rail link. </p>

<p>'In line with current Government policies, HS2 will now run as far as Leamington Spa before making a U-turn and returning to London Euston,' he says.</p>
