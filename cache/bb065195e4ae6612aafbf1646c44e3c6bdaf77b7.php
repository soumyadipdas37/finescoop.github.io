<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sydney's world-class New Year's Eve fireworks are likely to be cancelled in order to curb the spread of coronavirus. </p>

<p>An average of one million spectators take to the Sydney Harbour foreshore every year to watch the elaborate 12-minute display on December 31.  </p>

<p>But New South Wales Deputy Premier John Barilaro said on Wednesday the celebration was unlikely to go ahead because of the pandemic. </p>

<p>Sydney's world-famous New Year's Eve firework display (pictured above) will likely be cancelled to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>About one million people flock to the city's iconic foreshore ever year to watch the elaborate 12-minute display where fireworks detonate from Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge</p>

<p>Mr Barilaro said the precedent set by the cancellation of major events in regional areas, such as the Tamworth Country Music Festival, suggests large gatherings can't go ahead.</p>

<p>Should the fireworks be cancelled?</p>

<p>Should the fireworks be cancelled?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>'If the regions have to lose big tourism events like this, then there is no option but to cancel the big drawcard events in Sydney and the most obvious is the New Year's Eve fireworks,' Mr Barilaro told The Sydney Morning Herald.</p>

<p>The Herald cited a source close to NSW Police Minister David Elliott saying there were concerns about how to deal with thousands of people converging on the harbour to see the fireworks.</p>

<p>It is understood police believe it would be impossible to ensure social distancing measures with the massive crowds of people. </p>

<p>Pressure is mounting on the City of Sydney council to make a decision about the iconic celebration.   </p>

<p>Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore admitted it 'may not be responsible' for the celebrations to go ahead</p>

<p>The Sydney Harbour fireworks are watched by millions around the world as one of the first major celebrations to welcome the new year. </p>

<p>The pyrotechnics show also narrowly avoided cancellation due to a state-wide fire ban amid catastrophic bushfires last year. </p>

<p>Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has admitted it 'may not be responsible' for the crowded celebrations to go ahead.  </p>

<p>She claimed the decision ultimately rests with NSW Health to determine whether the event can be held safely.</p>

<p>'It would be incredibly sad if Sydney New Year's Eve cannot go ahead, but that is a real possibility we're facing,' she said. </p>
