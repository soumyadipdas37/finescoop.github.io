<p>A 57-year-old man is accused of having a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl, which was discovered after her father found 'questionable' text messages on a strange cell phone.</p>

<p>Francisco Alcala, from Indianapolis, was arrested after the teen's father quizzed his daughter about the cell phone, which she said the man had given to her.</p>

<p>She also admitted they were having a sexual relationship.</p>

<p>The father tried to confront Alcala at his home - which was just a few blocks from where the family lived - but called police when he couldn’t find him, according to the Indianapolis Star.</p>

<p>Officers arrived at the home and interviewed the 14-year-old, who told them she’d had sexual contact with the man on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>Police arrested Alacala and he was being held at the Marion County Jail.</p>

<p>The jail's web site did not specify charges, but the police report indicated Alcala was suspected of the crime of sexual misconduct with a minor.</p>

<p>The news comes after a middle school principal was charged with sexually abusing a male student over a period of three years starting when he was 13 years old.</p>

<p>Greg Tibbetts - who has been the principal of Vicksburg Middle School for the last nine years - was charged with second-degree criminal sexual conduct and several offenses related to using a computer to possess or distribute sexually abusive material.</p>
