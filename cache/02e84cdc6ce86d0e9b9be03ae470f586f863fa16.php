<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Christian group has lost a Court of Appeal challenge over Government changes to abortion rules made as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Christian Concern brought the action against the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) over its change to the regulations.</p>

<p>This allowed women to have medical abortions at home following a phone or video consultation.</p>

<p>The group took its case to the Court of Appeal after a High Court judge ruled against it in May.</p>

<p>Christian Concern said the decision went beyond the powers available under the 1967 Abortion Act.</p>

<p>They claimed that allowing women to have terminations at home went against the purpose of the Act, which was to prevent 'backstreet' abortions. </p>

<p>The regulations were changed in March to allow women to take both drugs needed for an early medical abortion at home.</p>

<p>Under previous rules, only the second drug could be taken at home, with the first administered at a hospital or clinic following an appointment with a doctor.</p>

<p>The group argued that, under the Act, a termination must be carried out by a registered medical practitioner and in an 'approved place'.</p>

<p>This would include being in a medical setting to be lawful - and said this is not the case if a pregnancy is terminated by a woman taking a drug at home.</p>

<p>But, in a ruling on Friday, Lady Justice Nicola Davies dismissed the appeal, saying the decision was within the scope of the Act and its purpose was to 'protect women's health'. </p>

<p>She said: 'That is exactly what happened in 2020, a decision was made in the context of a public health emergency arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.'</p>

<p>The judge said there was evidence from health professionals that vulnerable women were turning to online providers outside the regulated healthcare system. </p>

<p>She added: 'The purpose of the 2020 approval was to address a specific and acute medical need, in the context of a public health emergency'.</p>

<p>The judge said this was to 'ensure the continuance of the protection of the health of women in the context of the 1967 Act.'</p>

<p>She added that the registered medical practitioner 'remains in charge throughout the procedure' which were 'altered to reflect the changing and challenging times'. </p>

<p>The changes that were made are also 'time limited', she said.  </p>

<p>Christian Concern said it will take its case to the Supreme Court in a statement following the court's ruling.</p>

<p>Andrea Williams, the group's chief executive, said: 'The judges refused to hear evidence that would have prevented them from reaching their legal conclusions. </p>

<p>She said: 'We are determined to take this to the Supreme Court to correct this misguided and dangerous policy.'</p>

<p>At a hearing in July, Michael Phillips, representing Christian Concern, told the court the change in rules was 'one of the most significant amendments in the last 50 years of abortion law'.</p>

<p>He added that it had 'serious and life-changing consequences for the women involved' as well as for medical professionals and staff working at abortion clinics.</p>

<p>The Government opposed the challenge and said the decision to change the rules fell within its 'scope and power'. </p>

<p>Christian Concern announced plans to pursue legal action in April, after a double U-turn by the DHSC over abortion rules during the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>Ministers initially said women and girls would be allowed to take abortion pills at home, and doctors to prescribe from their homes during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Hours later, the statement was removed from the department's website, with officials saying it was 'published in error'.</p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that abortion rules would not be changed as part of the response to the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>But, days later, the policy changed again, with the department saying those needing an abortion up to 10 weeks can use abortion pills at home.</p>

<p>This would be after a consultation with a medical practitioner over the phone or on the internet.</p>
