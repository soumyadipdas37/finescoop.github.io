<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The CEO of Michael Bloomberg's political data and tech agency warned in an interview that will air Monday of mass chaos on Election Night as it appears Donald Trump is poised for another victory.</p>

<p>Josh Mendelsohn, CEO of Hawkfish, revealed the firm has a 'red mirage' model, which predicts the results come November.</p>

<p>'The reason we talk about a red mirage is in fact because we believe that on election night we are going to see Donald Trump in a stronger position than the reality actually is,' Mendelsohn told Axios on HBO in an interview that will air Monday evening.</p>

<p>A preview with Mendelsohn's comment, which he told to Axios' White House and politics editor Margaret Talev, was published earlier in the day Monday.</p>

<p>He claimed that the unconventional factors for Election Day this year, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, are setting the stage for potential chaos.</p>

<p>Mendelsohn said while it may appear on November 3 that Trump is the victor, it's likely the true results won't be known for days as an unusual amount of mail-in ballots will be used this election in lieu of turning up in-person to vote.</p>

<p>The firm predicts that after the mail-in ballots are accounted for, Democratic candidate Joe Biden will actually be revealed as the winner.</p>

<p>The CEO of a Democratic political data agency Hawkfish, Josh Mendelsohn, told Axios on HBO in an interview that will air Sunday evening that the firm has a theory of a 'red mirage' that will lead to 'chaos' in November</p>

<p>'The reason we talk about a red mirage is in fact because we believe that on election night we are going to see Donald Trump in a stronger position than the reality actually is,' Mendelsohn said</p>

<p>Essentially, the theory predicts that although it may appear Donald Trump wins on Election Day, the real results will be revealed days later due to mail-in voting and Joe Biden will emerge the victor</p>

<p>President Trump has constantly railed against universal mail-in voting as Democrats push for the measure as coronavirus continues to pose a threat to some demographics – like the elderly, ill and immunocompromised.</p>

<p>The president claimed mail-in voting will cause higher instances of fraud, and has insisted it would disproportionately benefit Democrats in November.</p>

<p>Hawkeye was founded by former New York City mayor, billionaire and former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg in the spring of 2020</p>

<p>Hawkfish is a political data and technology agency founded by former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg.</p>

<p>The firm was founded in the spring of last year in an effort to support, 'Democratic candidates, good causes, and common sense solutions.'</p>

<p>A few months later, Bloomberg announced he was running for president in 2020 – an effort he abandoned after his money could only take him so far and he dropped out of the race in March 2020.</p>

<p>Trump has claimed he will accept the results of the election, but has added the caveat that if universal mail-in voting is implemented – meaning every registered voter is automatically sent a ballot in the mail – the results would not be trustworthy.</p>
