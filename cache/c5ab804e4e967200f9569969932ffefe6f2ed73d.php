<p>He is back: The Mandalorian debuted its trailer for season two of the hit Disney+ Star Wars series on Tuesday</p>

<p>A hard path: The bounty hunter and The Child face an array of alien enemies as they travel from planet to planet together in the action-packed clip</p>

<p>This was the very first trailer seen for the second series which will be released on October 30.</p>

<p>The clip opens with a cruiser gliding over a planet and onto another one. Eerie music fills the trailer.</p>

<p>Then a woman's voice is heard talking to the bounty hunter (Pedro Pascal). She asks if this is the creature that so much was destroyed for. </p>

<p>BY first: But the bounty hunter is more determined than ever to protect the baby that looks like a relative of Yoda. 'You expect me to search the galaxy and deliver this creature to a race of enemy sorcerers?' he asks. He is told 'this is the way'</p>

<p>'Show me the one whose safety deemed such destruction. You must reunite it with its own kind,' she says.</p>

<p>'Where?' asks Mandalorian with a raspy voice.</p>

<p>'This is what you must determine,' she answers as a Sand Person is seen on a desert planet that resembled Tatooine.</p>

<p>The Yoda-like companion The Child is seen in most of the trailer looking as innocent and in need of protection as ever.</p>

<p>The bounty hunter is trying to find his home while staying away from Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito).</p>

<p>Mandalorian is on his way to get help.</p>

<p>Next, Mandalorian and The Child are on an ice planet that could be Hoth. The little creature is in his beige jacket as he sits on the snow.</p>

<p>The woman's voice says he may have to go to a sorceress.</p>

<p>'You expect me to search the galaxy and deliver this creature to a race of enemy sorcerers?' he asks. A woman is seen then she disappears adding to the mystery.</p>

<p>'This is the way,' says the woman.</p>

<p>Now a battle in the air is seen as the bounty hunter is chased.</p>

<p>'You know this is no place for a child,' says a man in voiceover.</p>

<p>'You know where he goes I go,' says Mandalorian.</p>

<p>'So I heard,' adds the man.</p>

<p>Fights ensue and the bounty hunter states, 'This is the way.' </p>

<p>Showrunner Jon Favreau is overseeing along with executive producer and director Dave Filoni. </p>

<p>Season one was one of Disney+'s tent pole productions, part of the first group of projects available on the streaming platform. </p>

<p>As of May, baby Yoda and Mando helped entice 54.5million subscribers to Disney+.</p>

<p>The Mandalorian snagged a surprising 15 Emmy nominations last month after getting no love at January's Golden Globes. </p>

<p>Season two wrapped shooting before the coronavirus pandemic put nearly all of the industry on hold.</p>

<p>In June series creator and head writer Jon Favreau revealed: 'We were lucky enough to have finished photography before the lock down.'</p>

<p>'Thanks to how technology-forward Lucasfilm and ILM are, we have been able to do all of our visual effects and editing and post production remotely through systems that had been set up by those companies for us,' Favreau, who also serves as executive producer and showrunner, added.</p>

<p>Some of the famous names being lined-up to join the much-anticipated second season include Timothy Olyphant, Rosario Dawson, Michael Biehn, Temuera Morrison and Katee Sackhoff.</p>

<p>The Mandalorian is set five years after the events of Return of the Jedi and 25 years prior to The Force Awakens.</p>

<p>It follows a Mandalorian bounty hunter named Din Djarin, played by Pedro Pascal, and his exploits beyond the reaches of the New Republic. </p>

<p>The cast also features Carl Weathers as Greef Karga and Werner Herzog as The Client, with Nick Nolte and Jojo Rabbit director Taika Waititi lending their voices to Kuiil and IG-11. </p>
