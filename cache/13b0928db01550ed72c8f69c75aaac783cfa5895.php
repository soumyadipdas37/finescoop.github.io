<p>Look away, Locky! Juliette Herrera shocked some fans of The Bachelor after suffering an X-rated wardrobe malfunction during a Zoom call with Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>Due to the positioning of her laptop camera, Juliette's black underwear was visible to both Locky and the viewers watching at home. </p>

<p>The dress was also low cut, allowing Juliette's cleavage to almost spill out on camera.</p>

<p>'Juliette’s dress isn’t the most Zoom appropriate, although I kind of think that’s the angle she’s going for,' one fan tweeted. </p>

<p>'That isn't Zoom appropriate!' In the scene, the 34-year-old squeezed her curves into a tiny mustard dress that was too short to protect her modesty</p>

<p>'Juliette we can see up your dress and also pls mute your mic,' added another.</p>

<p>'And again Juliette is wearing another different low cut dress,' tweeted one, while another wrote: 'Juliette in that dress, my areolas could never.'</p>
