<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Darrell Lea has dropped a sweet new range of chocolates just weeks after becoming the first ever Australian supermarket brand to go 100 per cent palm oil free.</p>

<p>The confectionery brand has launched four products - including two new chocolate block flavours with a twist - Bondi Block and Sundae Sesh.</p>

<p>Bondi Block is a wave of golden crispy cornflakes, crunchy peanuts and salted caramel chips while Sundae Sesh evokes memories of ice-cream sundaes full of strawberry candies, marshmallow and thin crispy wafer.</p>

<p>Both blocks, which retails at $5 each, are made with smooth milk chocolate jam-packed with 'crunchy, punchy little goodies'.</p>

<p>Bondi Block ($5) is a wave of golden crispy cornflakes, crunchy peanuts and salted caramel chips</p>

<p>Sundae Sesh ($5) evokes memories of ice-cream sundaes full of strawberry candies, marshmallow and thin crispy wafer.</p>

<p>Chocolate Liquorice Balls ($4.40) is made with real milk chocolate filled with soft eating black liquorice</p>

<p>Chocolate Raspberry Balls ($4.40) consists of sweet, chewy raspberry centres, blanketed in milk chocolate</p>

<p>In addition to the range, the brand has rolled its famous Batch 37 black liquorice and sweet raspberry centres into bite-size chocolate balls.</p>

<p>The Chocolate Raspberry Balls and Chocolate Liquorice Balls, which cost $4.40 a pack, are blanketed in real milk chocolate.</p>

<p>The new products comes as the brand's factories in Sydney and Melbourne have started replacing palm oil across the entire Darrell Lea range with its 100 per cent palm oil free products hitting shelves this week.</p>

<p>By November, the company anticipates that all products in supermarkets will be palm oil free - as the brand will also redesign packaging with a stand out new logo and clear ingredient listing.</p>

<p>'As a business we wanted to do the right thing. In recent years, our consumers have told us that they don't want palm oil in our products,' Tim Stanford, marketing director, said.</p>

<p>'We listened and we took action. We found a great alternative in sunflower oil. It doesn't affect the taste, look or feel of our products.'</p>

<p> By November, the company anticipates that all products in supermarkets will be palm oil free</p>

<p>Current Australian labeling laws mean that palm oil doesn't have to be included on product packaging, often called vegetable oil or vegetable fat.</p>

<p>'There is no doubt that palm oil production causes major devastation to rainforests and endangered animals, such as the orangutan,' Mr Stanford said.</p>

<p>'We call on all businesses, not only in the confectionery industry, but across the board to look into their supply chain and make better decisions about the ingredients they use.'</p>
