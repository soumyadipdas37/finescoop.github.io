<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It looks as though Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have had some company this weekend in the form of their close friends David Foster and Katharine McPhee. </p>

<p>David, 70, and wife Katharine, 36, were spotted near the Duke and Duchess's Montecito mansion on Saturday, with exclusive images from DailyMail.com showing the couple filling up their car with gas before driving off to a house just a few doors down from Meghan and Harry's new home. </p>

<p>The couple's Montecito outing comes just days ahead of Prince Harry's birthday, for which David is reported to be masterminding celebrations, and could well be a sign that the foursome got together in order to celebrate the  big day early - while also no doubt toasting Harry and Meghan's newly-inked Netflix deal. </p>

<p>On the move: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's close friends David Foster and Katharine McPhee were seen out and about near the Sussexes' home in Montecito on Saturday - suggesting they may have visited the couple over Labor Day weekend </p>

<p>Errands: Katharine, 36, was seen filling up her car with gas before she and husband David, 70, drove to a property just a few doors down from Harry and Meghan's new $14.7 million Montecito home </p>

<p>Late night? The actress was pictured yawning while standing at the pump, as her music producer husband sat in the car</p>

<p>Helping hand: The couple shared the job of pumping gas, with Katharine taking over from David, who then went to sit in the driver's seat of their Land Rover</p>

<p>Both David and Katharine were dressed casually for the outing, with actress Katharine wearing a pair of jeans and a black T-shirt, with a white button-up which she had tied at the waist. </p>

<p>She completed her look with a pair of slip-on Gucci loafers, and her hair was tied up in a messy ponytail. </p>

<p> Celebration? Katharine and David's trip to Montecito comes just one week before Prince Harry's 36th birthday - for which David is said to be organizing a party </p>

<p>David mirrored his wife's ensemble, donning baggy jeans, a white T-shirt, a blue button-up, and a pair of sunglasses that were seen hanging from the neck of his tee. </p>

<p>The couple were both pictured taking turns by the pump, before David got climbed back into the driver's seat of their Land Rover while Katharine blew him a sweet kiss through the window.  </p>

<p>Their arrival in Montecito came just over a week before Harry's turns 36 - and one month after it was first reported that David is planning to throw the Duke a fun-filled party in celebration of his first Los Angeles-based birthday. </p>

<p>In August, the Mirror claimed that the party, which is set to take place on September 15, the date of Harry's birthday, will be held at David's Los Angeles home, with a source telling the publication that it would be a low-key and intimate celebration. </p>

<p>'David wants to make it special for Harry but also keep it casual and low-key with some fine wine, great food and intimate company,' the source claimed. </p>

<p>'He is setting aside the fire pit at his home plus the whole outdoor area, which security will cordon off.' </p>

<p>According to the publication, no royals other than Harry and Meghan were due to be in attendance at the event, however David was reportedly planning to include his daughters, actresses Erin and Sara, and their respective husbands, all of whom 'are around the same age' as the Duke and Duchess.   </p>

<p>But before Harry's big birthday arrives, the couple still has plenty to celebrate - not least their newly-signed deal with Netflix, which is said to be worth anywhere between $100 and $150 million.  </p>

<p>'Father figure': David and Harry have formed a very close bond since being introduced by their wives last year, with Katharine recently saying they are like 'father and son'</p>

<p>Pucker up! Katharine, who seen blowing a kiss to her husband through the window, attended school with Meghan as a teen, and the pair also took part in a local theater group together</p>

<p>Preparations? According to the Mirror, David is planning a low-key and intimate birthday celebration for September 15, which will take place at his Los Angeles home  </p>

<p>Party people: Ahead of Harry's birthday, the group would still have had plenty to celebrate - not least Harry and Meghan's newly-inked deal with Netflix, which is said to be worth between $100 and $150 million </p>

<p>Low-key: Katharine opted for a casual look for her outing, modeling jeans and a white button-up that she tied around the waist over a black T-shirt, before finishing the look off with Gucci loafers </p>

<p>Details of the deal first emerged last week, with The New York Times revealing that Meghan and Harry have founded a yet-to-be-named production company through which they will create documentaries, feature films, scripted shows, and children's programming. </p>

<p>In a statement, the Sussexes said: 'Our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives hope. As new parents, making inspirational family programming is also important to us.' </p>

<p>They added that Netflix's 'unprecedented reach will help us share impactful content that unlocks action.' </p>

<p>And that's not the only news that the foursome will have had to celebrate together.</p>

<p>On Monday it was revealed that Harry and Meghan have paid back all of the $3.1 million in taxpayer money that was spent on the redevelopment of Frogmore Cottage, the five-bedroom property that they use as their UK base. </p>

<p>The couple, who had been paying the cash back in monthly installments, announced that they have completely refunded the Sovereign Grant in the days after their lucrative Netflix deal was revealed. </p>

<p>Sources close to the couple also claimed that they will no longer be receiving handouts from Prince Charles as they have sought to establish 'financial independence' - something that their latest career move will certainly help to provide. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex certainly appear to be settling fully into life outside of the royal family, having now spent several months in their new $14.7 million home in Montecito - where they may well have entertained David and Katharine over the long Labor Day weekend.   </p>

<p>It is understood that the two couples have grown incredibly close, with Meghan and Katharine establishing a friendship back when they attended the same Los Angeles school as teenagers, before introducing their husbands, who also formed an instant bond. </p>

<p>In fact, Katharine told Access Hollywood in May of this year that her husband and Harry have formed a 'beautiful relationship' that is more like that of a 'father and son'. </p>

<p>'My husband has a really, really beautiful relationship with Harry,' she said. 'They're like, they're so cute. They're like father and son.' </p>

<p>She added that she and Meghan first reconnected last year, having formed a friendship during childhood, although Katharine noted that David and Harry have actually grown far closer than the two women.  </p>
