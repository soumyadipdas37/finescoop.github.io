<p>Co-owner Sullivan delivered a downbeat update on the club's prospects of bringing in fresh faces before next month's deadline and about their lack of funds for this window.</p>

<p>David Sullivan has warned West Ham may end the transfer window without any new additions</p>

<p>Sullivan claimed one problem is they already 'chased the dream the last two years'</p>

<p>West Ham were hit by a backlash from their players, led by captain Mark Noble, supporters after selling academy product Grady Diangana to West Brom for £18million.</p>

<p>They attempted to justify the sale with a promise that the money would be reinvested with manager David Moyes hoping to bolster his defence.</p>

<p>Among their targets is Burnley's James Tarkowski who they have so far failed to prise away. They have also made a bid worth up to £33m for St Etienne's centre back Wesley Fofana, who has also been targeted by Leicester.</p>

<p>'I cannot say for sure we are going to sign anybody. As each day passes, I get more depressed,' Sullivan said, in a talkSPORT interview that was not well-received by club insiders or supporters.</p>

<p>'You can't pay double what you value a player at. We haven't got the money. The club will go bankrupt. These are difficult times and we have to be sensible.</p>

<p>'We have a number of bids in for a number of players, but teams don't want to lose them; key players at decent sized clubs, outside the UK. So whether we get any of these players I do not know.'</p>
