<p>'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'</p>

<p>Instead, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with nurse Irena Srbinovska.</p>

<p>He told her: 'When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.'</p>

<p>'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'</p>

<p>Happy ending! In the end, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with Irena (left) </p>
