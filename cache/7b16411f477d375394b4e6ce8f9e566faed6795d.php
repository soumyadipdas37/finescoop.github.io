<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Carlo Ancelotti has promised Everton fans they will 'love' the new season as he labelled his first signing Allan one of the best in the world.</p>

<p>Allan, the Brazil international, watched from the stands on Saturday as Everton beat Preston 2-0 in their final warm-up game before the new Premier League campaign.</p>

<p> The 29-year-old, who worked with Ancelotti at Napoli, cost £25m and has signed a deal until June 2023.</p>

<p>Everton finally secured the signing of Brazilian midfielder Allan from Napoli for a fee of £25m</p>

<p>Carlo Ancelotti is excited for the season ahead and is hopeful that Everton will make progress</p>

<p>This will not be Everton's only signing before they face Tottenham. Abdoulaye Doucoure has undergone a medical and will be unveiled soon, with a £20m deal having been agreed with Watford, while James Rodriguez will take the headlines once his switch from Real Madrid is complete.</p>

<p>Ancelotti was startled by the way Everton's results fell asunder towards the end of the last campaign and made it clear to his squad he would not tolerate any repeats going forward. </p>

<p>He also knows how impatient supporters are to see consistency and has vowed to give them optimism this year.</p>

<p>'We want to make progress,' Ancelotti said. 'The position last season was not enough. </p>

<p>'We want to improve and we are trying to do everything to improve the squad to be better next season. </p>

<p>'I am sure the fans will love Allan's characteristics. And I am sure the fans are also going to love our season.</p>

<p>'Allan is very aggressive. Defensively, he is really good. My personal opinion is that he is one of the best defensive midfielders in the world. </p>

<p>'He is intelligent tactically and he has got a lot of energy. He is a player whose energy can make the others better.</p>

<p>Ancelotti who worked with Allan at Napoli said the Brazilian will be a 'fantastic signing'</p>

<p>'It was not easy to find a deal but, in the end, we were able to do it and I think he will prove to be a fantastic player for us with quality and ability. </p>

<p>'He is very good tactically, good with the ball and good without the ball. He is a fantastic signing for us. I have no doubt.' </p>

<p>Allan has won nine Brazil caps and was part of the squad that won last summer's Copa America; he was the subject of intense interest from Paris St Germain 12 months ago, with a reported £60million bid, and Ancelotti believes that gives an indication of his ability.</p>

<p>Everton are also looking to sign Abdoulaye Doucoure and James Rodriguez this summer</p>

<p>'Yes, they tried to sign him but I didn't want him to leave so he stayed with me,' said Ancelotti. </p>

<p>'I'm not focused about the money. There was a deal (now) and I think Everton are happy to have this deal! Napoli were not happy that they had to let him leave.' </p>

<p>One area that will give Ancelotti some concern is the fitness of defender Mason Holgate, who left Goodison Park on crutches after damaging his toe and he has undergone tests at Finch Farm. </p>

<p>The squad could be boosted this week, though, by the return of Fabian Delph.</p>

<p>'Delph has been working on his own,' said Ancelotti. 'I think this week he can work with the team and I hope that he will be ready for Sunday.'</p>
