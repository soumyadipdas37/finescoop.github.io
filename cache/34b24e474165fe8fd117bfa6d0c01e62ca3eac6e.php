<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A London council leader has said he wants to 'take advantage' of coronavirus to make controversial temporary road closures and cycle lanes permanent.</p>

<p>Julian Bell, the Labour leader of Ealing Council, is hoping to make the area 'the cycling Copenhagen of London' after already receiving £600,000 of funding.</p>

<p>The married father-of-four added that the local authority in suburban West London is hoping to get more than £1million to make the lane changes permanent.</p>

<p>His comments were made in a council meeting on Zoom which was posted on social media, provoking outrage from those already frustrated by the changes.</p>

<p>Julian Bell, the Labour leader of Ealing Council, is hoping to make the area 'the cycling Copenhagen of London' after already receiving £600,000 of funding</p>

<p>Mr Bell, a passionate cyclist who once travelled 18,000 miles on his bike in five years, said: 'Clearly we want to take advantage of Covid around active travel infrastructure.</p>

<p>'We've already got over £600,000 of funding from TfL to put in temporary cycling and walking infrastructure.</p>

<p>Ealing Council's leader Julian Bell</p>

<p>Julian Bell, who set up the Labour Cyclists group, first worked for the Labour Party in 1994 and was elected as a councillor for Ealing in 2002.</p>

<p>He has served four terms as leader of the West London authority and is married to Hermia with four daughters, including the CBBC and Martin Lewis Money Show presenter Angellica Bell.</p>

<p>Previously, Mr Bell hit the headlines in 2014 when he was branded a 'hypocrite' after buying a five-bedroom property while staying on as a housing association tenant.</p>

<p>In February 2017 the council revealed he had travelled 18,250 miles on his bike since October 2012, the equivalent of cycling around the world.</p>

<p>At the time, he said 2 to 3 per cent of journeys in Ealing were made by bike, compared to half in Copenhagen. </p>

<p>'Our aim is to hopefully get back over £1million of funding and to actually make these permanent, these changes, so that as I said we can kind of be the cycling Copenhagen of London. </p>

<p>'So we have a climate crisis strategy, an action plan, that we're working on and clearly working towards net zero carbon by 2030 is a key objective.'</p>

<p>Responding to the video, one Twitter user said: 'The entitlement is outrageous. No concern for the effect it's having on the communities and businesses it affects. </p>

<p>'I've not spent so much time in my car as I have since the LTN (Low Traffic Neighbourhoods) scheme. Zero common sense and shameless. This is why people hate politicians.'</p>

<p>Another tweeted: 'Have these people not looked around the UK and seen the chaos that these not used cycle lanes are causing?'</p>

<p>And a third said: 'The bicycle is 200 years old. These luddites are trying to transform Ealing's roads for something that was a progressive form of transport 200 years ago That's like ditching broadband and going back to dial up. </p>

<p>'Instead of transforming Ealing into Copenhagen what they should be doing is putting in the infrastructure for today's technology. We have electric and hydrogen vehicles - how about making Ealing the blue print for tomorrow's tech instead of trying to turn it into something it's not?'</p>

<p>An Ealing Council spokesman was today contacted for comment by MailOnline.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, campaigners said road closures brought in during the coronairus crisis are causing gridlock and leading to life-threatening delays for the emergency services.</p>

<p>Councils are using emergency coronavirus cash to rush through the 'green' measures, an audit of local road schemes suggested.</p>

<p>Under the projects brought in to aid social distancing and encourage walking and cycling, portions of road are being turned over to pedestrians and bikes – and in some cases, closed off altogether.</p>

<p>The Mail carried out a snapshot survey of 30 local authorities and found all have introduced schemes that have an impact on traffic in the past four months.</p>

<p>The rash of new restrictions has led to life-threatening delays in reaching heart attack and stroke patients, according to the College of Paramedics.</p>

<p>In May, councils were handed £250million for 'green' schemes to promote social distancing and to encourage walking and cycling in the wake of lockdown.</p>

<p>Supporters say the measures have cut air pollution, led to a rise in physical activity and attracted strong local support.</p>

<p>But campaigners claim draconian measures are being rushed through, bringing chaos to the roads at a time when many are shunning public transport in favour of their cars over Covid fears. </p>

<p>Last week a mother who said her daughter was killed by lethal levels of air pollution called on the Transport Secretary to ban eco-obsessed councils from closing roads.</p>

<p>Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, whose daughter Ella suffered a fatal asthma attack thought to have been triggered by illegal levels of pollution, says 'green' schemes designed to reduce pollution should be scrapped.</p>

<p>Mrs Kissi-Debrah lives near one of 114 'low traffic neighbourhoods' (LTNs) in London where road blocks are set up to stop residential streets being used as rat runs.</p>

<p>But motoring groups say LTNs and other green schemes cause serious congestion as drivers are bottlenecked on main roads.</p>

<p>Empty cycle lanes cause queues of cars and vans at Balham in South London earlier this month</p>

<p>They are furious at ministers for allowing councils to exploit powers introduced as a result of the pandemic to rush through anti-car policies.</p>

<p>Mrs Kissi-Debrah lives 80ft from one of the country's busiest roads – the A205 South Circular in Lewisham, south-east London – and said traffic levels have 'quadrupled' since an LTN zone was set up ten weeks ago.</p>

<p>LTNs have been blamed for a 153 per cent surge in congestion in outer London, where roads have been closed to reduce pollution and promote walking and cycling. </p>

<p>Wandsworth Council in south-west London recently scrapped an LTN scheme after residents complained about pollution.</p>

<p>Bromley Council in south London has started legal action over road closures in neighbouring Croydon, claiming they have worsened traffic.</p>

<p>Other schemes – such as widened cycle lanes, pedestrianised streets and 20mph speed limit areas – have brought gridlock to towns and cities across Britain.</p>
