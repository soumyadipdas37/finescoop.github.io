<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One of the Trump campaign's tweets has been flagged as 'manipulated' by Twitter after they posted a clip of election rival Joe Biden out of context.</p>

<p>In the clip, Biden is heard saying the words: 'You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.'</p>

<p>However, the tweet by the Trump War Room account did not make clear that Biden had said the words during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, the New York Post reports.</p>

<p>Twitter has flagged a tweet from President Trump's campaign account as 'manipuated media' after it posted a video clip of Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden out of context. The campaign account then tweeted to say the initial post had been meant as a 'joke'</p>

<p>The democratic presidential candidate was attempting to rebut the claim made in that very quote.</p>

<p>Biden made the comment yesterday in Pittsburgh while arguing he would re-introduce social stability after months of protests following the killing of George Floyd.</p>

<p>The full quote by Biden reads as: 'Since they have no agenda or vision for a second term, Trump and Pence are running on this, and I find it fascinating: ‘You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.’ And what’s their proof? The violence we’re seeing in Donald Trump’s America.</p>

<p>He also said that President Trump 'adds fuel to every fire'.</p>

<p>Biden made the comment yesterday in Pittsburgh as a rebuttal of that exact claim while arguing he would re-introduce social stability after months of protests following the killing of George Floyd</p>

<p>A blue exclamation mark and the words 'manipulated media' appeared on the original tweet and Twitter created a list of tweets which fact-checked the claim made in the 'manipulated' tweet.</p>

<p>This included a description of the full context surrounding the comment made by Joe Biden as well as tweets which reported the full quote rather than the the selected section. </p>

<p>After Twitter flagged the Trump campaign's account posted a clarification on their initial tweet.</p>

<p>They said: 'To all the triggered journalists who can't take a joke about their candidate, it's not our fault Joe Biden was dumb enough to say this on camera.'</p>

<p>A blue exclamation mark and the words 'manipulated media' appeared on the original tweet and Twitter created a list of tweets which fact-checked the claim made in the out of context tweet</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Twitter has flagged tweets by the president, with the social media company deeming a tweet back in June as 'abusive'.</p>

<p>Tweeting on June 23, the President said: 'There will never be an 'Autonomous Zone' in Washington, D.C., as long as I'm your President. If they try they will be met with serious force!'  </p>

<p>Twitter flagged Trump's tweet before giving users the option to unveil the text of the post.</p>
