<p> Interesting: Scott took to the comments and wrote that Tristan 'is a lucky man,' seemingly confirming their relationship</p>

<p>'Tristan is working hard to prove himself and has been a great dad to True,' the source said. </p>

<p>Now, Khloe appears to be ready to take a step back from the spotlight to focus on her family and her relationship.</p>

<p>Making it work: Back in July, People insiders said the couple were 'giving their relationship another try' as Thompson continued to show he's a changed man since the 2019 cheating scandal. They're seen in February 2018 together above</p>

<p>Sister act: The Kardashians told fans 'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up With The Kardashians' while thanking everyone who has supported throughout their 14 years and 20 seasons</p>

<p>Way back when: The show debuted all the way back in 2007, seen in a season one promo above</p>

<p>She went on: 'I’m too emotional to fully express myself at the moment. My sappy post will come soon. </p>

<p>But the youngest Kardashian sister explained that it was time for a new chapter, writing: 'Change is hard but also needed at times❤️��❤️�� I love you all. Thank you for the memories!'</p>

<p>While the show - which debuted in 2007 - has undoubtedly had an extraordinary run, its more recent series have suffered poor ratings.</p>

<p>In April this year, it was reported that viewership had sunk to 871,000 viewers, making that episode the 4th lowest rated episode ever.</p>

<p>Peak moment: At its peak, KUWTK earned E! its most-watched day ever, when 10.5 million viewers tuned in to watch Kim's ill-fated wedding to Kris Humphries - the episode, Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event - Part 2, aired in 2011</p>

<p>However, as the viewership has dipped, the family's social media presence has only grown stronger - which could explain why fans are flocking to their Instagram Stories to get their fix, instead of the television show.</p>
