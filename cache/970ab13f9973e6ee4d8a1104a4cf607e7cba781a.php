<p>In a video statement, Andy Preston said: 'I have to tell you I think this measure has been introduced based on factual inaccuracies and a monstrous and frightening lack of communication, and ignorance. </p>

<p>'I do not accept the statement at all. I do not accept these measures.</p>

<p>'We need to talk to government, they need to understand our local knowledge, expertise and ability to get things done, and preserve jobs and well-being.</p>

<p>The Independent elected Mayor of Middlesbrough Andy Preston is refusing to lockdown his city in direct defiance of the Government's new coronavirus restrictions</p>

<p>'We are really disappointed. As things stand, we defy the Government and we do not accept these measures.</p>

<p>'We need to get Covid under control and we need to work with people to find a way of preserving jobs and mental health.'</p>

<p>Mr Preston had previously called for a ban on households mixing in private, but he fell short of asking for the same measures in public venues such as pubs and restaurants.</p>

<p>Matt Hancock has announced that Middlesbrough and Hartlepool should face the same restrictions as elsewhere in the North East - including not to mix households in pubs.</p>
