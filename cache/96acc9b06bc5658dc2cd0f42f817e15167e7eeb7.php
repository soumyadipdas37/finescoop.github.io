<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Frank Lampard hailed the 'first of many great nights' for Kai Havertz after the Â£89million forward scored a hat-trick in the 6-0 rout of Barnsley.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old had endured a slow start to his Blues career after playing wide on the right on his debut against Brighton and then used centrally in the 2-0 defeat against LiverpoolÂ before being hauled off at half-time.</p>

<p>It led to Jamie Carragher questioning how the club's record signing fits intoÂ Chelsea's system after his low-key displays.</p>

<p>Chelsea's record signing Kai Havertz scored a hat-trick in the 6-0 rout of Barnsley</p>

<p>Lampard insistedÂ he knows Havertzâ€™s best position and that his role in the side will become clear when he reaches full fitness.</p>

<p>And Havertz responded in emphatic fashion in the No 10 role at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.Â </p>

<p>'I'm delighted with Kai, it was everything I wanted the night to be for him,' said Lampard.</p>

<p>The German international thrived in the No 10 role as Chelsea ran riot in the Carabao Cup tie</p>

<p>'Because Kai has had no pre-season, and signing for the club took a few days out for him as well.</p>

<p>'Tonight was a great exercise for him to see how we want to work off the ball, for him to be a part of that.</p>

<p>'He made a great recovery tackle for Ross' goal. And then to also just have some freedom on the ball and roam in more central areas.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old forward completed his hat-trick with a clever finish on Wednesday night</p>

<p>'I thought it was a great combination with Tammy, and I was pleased with the way he grew into the game in terms of confidence. It was a great night for Kai, and the first of many for him.'</p>

<p>Tammy Abraham, Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud all found the net to add to Havertz's hat-trick, with the German international thriving in the No 10 role.</p>

<p>Speaking after the match, Havertz said: "I'm very happy to score my first goal here at Chelsea, I'm very happy about the win and happy about my three goals and I hope we can continue like that."Â </p>

<p>Tammy Abraham opened the scoring for Chelsea and celebrated with Kai Havertz</p>

<p>Focusing on Abrahamâ€™s role in his performance, Havertz added: â€˜I think heâ€™s a very, very good striker and I think our partnership on the pitch was very good.Â Â </p>

<p>â€˜It was our first game together but I like him very much as a striker. For me as a No. 10 itâ€™s very good to play with him.â€™Â </p>

<p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard was thrilled after Havertz put his slow start behind him</p>
