<p>Speedy sightseeing: Heather Watson cut a casual figure in active wear as she darted around London on an electric scooter with her friend on Thursday</p>

<p>The sportswoman was kitted out in New Balance from head-to-toe as she donned a grey jumper, matching leggings and trainers from the sports brand.</p>

<p>Heather kept her raven locks in a casual topknot and decided to go make-up free for their day out. </p>

<p>The British number two appeared to be feeling better as she drove her scooter on the busy roads, while her friend wrapped her arms around her so she didn't fall off. </p>

<p>Back on top form? The tennis ace, 28, withdrew from her first-round match in Istanbul this week after feeling unwell but appeared in brighter spirits during her day out in the city</p>

<p>Her pal sported a denim mini skirt, a matching jacket and a black bandeau top as she posed up a storm and got Heather to capture the photos. </p>

<p>Heather was the fifth seed at the TEB BNP Paribas Tennis Championship at the Turkish event. </p>

<p>The tennis star had her blood pressure and temperature taken after feeling unwell during her first round clash against Sara Tormo.   </p>

<p>Gym chic: She was kitted out in New Balance from head-to-toe as she donned a grey jumper, matching leggings and trainers from the sports brand</p>

<p>Motor skills: Heather put her athletic skills to good use as she kept her eyes on the road and whizzed around </p>

<p>She called for assistance at 2-3 in the first set and lay down on a towel for a medical break as staff assessed if she could continue the game. </p>

<p>Ultimately, she was forced to retire and returned to the UK earlier this week. </p>

<p>Electric scooters have become a popular mode of transport in cities, and are increasingly used in London because they are exempt from the congestion charge. </p>

<p>Road users who hold a UK provisional license and are over the age of 18 can hire the vehicles for a small fee, and can travel at speeds of up to 30mph.   </p>

<p>Try not to fall! The British number two drove her scooter on the busy roads of London while her friend stood behind her and hung on for dear life </p>

<p>According to reports, the increase of electric scooters on the road presents an additional hazard for drivers and a new danger for pedestrians.</p>

<p>Experts at Lime Solicitors told the Express: 'There is no doubt that the appearance of these silent machines on our roads will add further risk and complexity for motorists and other road users, already coping with the inherent dangers of driving, and driving within the law.</p>

<p>'Pedestrians will also be vulnerable to the stealthy progress of these machines along the highways and will be particularly at risk if the current illegal use of scooters on pavements and other public areas persists.'</p>

<p>Team effort: Her friend sported a denim mini skirt, a matching jacket and a black bandeau top as she posed up a storm and got Heather to capture the images</p>
