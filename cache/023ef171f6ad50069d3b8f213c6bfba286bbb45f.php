<p>Sophie, who donned a purple jumper under her coat, looked only too delighted to be feeding a very interested llama</p>

<p>Their Royal Highnesses also met graduates of the farm’s New Shoots programme.</p>

<p>The six-week programme, which is free of charge, helps equip unemployed young people aged 16-25 years with the skills to gain employment, and provides access to career guidance, mentoring and training. </p>

<p>Staff and volunteers at the farm also spoke to the royal couple about adapting to the new measures in place at the farm since re-opening, and their efforts to continue looking after the animals during lockdown. </p>

<p>Sophie, who opted for minimal makeup, wore her blonde hair scraped back into a loose ponytail, and accessorised with a pair of dainty silver hoop earrings and a clutch bad.  </p>

<p>The royal wrapped up warm for the chilly weather conditions, and could be seen carrying a clutch bag in her left hand</p>

<p>Sophie wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty as she got stuck in to the day's activities on the farm</p>

<p>The Countess of Wessex could be seen taking food from a bucket before holding out her left had to a llama</p>

<p> Vauxhall City Farm is one of the oldest central city farms in London, founded more than 40 years ago.</p>

<p>The farm provides valuable education, recreation and health benefits to the local community, as well as offering regular educational and vocational activities to local schools.</p>

<p>A new community garden is also being created at the farm, which will include an educational therapy hub that uses gardening and horticulture to support children and adults facing physical and mental health challenges.</p>

<p>It comes just a week after Sophie visited Coverwood Farm in Cranleigh, Surrey, where she met the farmer and his family, looked at some of the animals and the new Provenance Cuts building where she unveiled a plaque at the end of the visit. </p>

<p>Later, Sophie - who is married to the Queen's youngest son - was spotted grabbing some lunch and a hot drink from a snack van. </p>

<p>The royal couple met staff and volunteers on the farm to learn about their experiences of re-opening with new Covid-19 measures in place after lockdown</p>
