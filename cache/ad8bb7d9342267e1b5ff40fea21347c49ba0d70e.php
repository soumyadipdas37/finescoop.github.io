<p>'I think it's even more than that. I think it's positive for knowing that I'm with the right person,' she explained.</p>

<p>'There's nobody else I'd want to be quarantined with right now. He's just the best.' </p>

<p>Though Rani is Danny's only child, Kate is also mom to sons Ryder, 16, and Bingham, nine.</p>

<p>Bingham's dad happens to be Muse frontman Matt Bellamy, 42, who dated Kate from 2010 until their traumatic split in 2014.</p>

<p>In an interview with Allure, Kate opened up about her 'painful' split from Bellamy and how they worked to peacefully co-parent Bingham.</p>

<p>'Relationships ending are painful, and you can choose to carry that or you can choose to reframe it. If Matt and I had a great relationship, we would still be together, but we chose to move on because we had different visions of how we wanted to live our lives,' explained Kate.</p>

<p>She added: 'That doesn't mean, though, that we can't rebuild something that would be the best thing for the kids.'</p>

<p>Balance: 'The reality is I have three kids I love, I’ve got a lot of work and I love making movies. Nothing will ever keep me away from making movies,' admitted Kate to the 50-year-old supermodel</p>

<p>'The reality is I have three kids I love, I’ve got a lot of work and I love making movies. Nothing will ever keep me away from making movies,' admitted Kate to the 50-year-old supermodel. </p>

<p>'The issue with movie making is that it takes you away, and it’s really really sh***y hours, and when you’re doing it it’s like "I better really really like this story. I better love the people I’m working with. I better love this director," or it really is like why am I here?'</p>

<p>She went on to suggest that, although she loves the movie business, there is a clear gender bias against actresses, which it makes it harder for them to forge their way.</p>

<p>'One thing in Hollywood – women don’t get the same opportunities, and what I mean by that is one failure is like an equivalent to three failures for a guy. </p>

<p>'One female box office not great opening for a woman… the next time they’re thinking of casting you for something they’ll be like, "her last movie didn’t do great."</p>

<p>'For a guy, they usually give them about three to five chances, right? And they’ll still get paid, and they’ll still get the opportunity but for some reason with women it’s a little bit different.'</p>

<p>'The other thing is that when women get really famous, they don't really want the famous person in the movie, they want a new face, whereas for a guy it's totally different. I think it’s just a bad antiquated habit,' explained Kate.</p>
