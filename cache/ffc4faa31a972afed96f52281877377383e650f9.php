<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>As a loving husband and father-of-two headed off for a morning surf, Simon Wilson had no idea he was set to become a dad again.  He would never find out.</p>

<p>The last time Simon was seen was when he was pulled out of the water off Mermaid Beach on the Gold Coast.</p>

<p>Amid her grief at her husband's still-unexplained death on August 6, his wife Lisa took a home pregnancy test the next day.</p>

<p>'I had suspected I was pregnant but didn't want to take the test too soon. But after what happened, I just had to know,' she told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>Simon Wilson (pictured with wife Lisa) drowned on August 6 while surfing at Mermaid Beach on the Gold Coast</p>

<p>Mr Wilson (pictured with daughter Ava, son Finn and wife Lisa) had gone surfing alone before he drowned at the popular beach in Queensland</p>

<p>The test was positive, and so were two more she took just to be sure. A visit to the doctor four days later confirmed the bittersweet news.  </p>

<p>Mr Wilson, 44, was already a devoted father to Ava, 8, and Finn, 4, whom his wife promised will make sure he's not forgotten.</p>

<p>'My kids will definitely keep that memory alive for their new sibling. They will know who their dad was and how much he loved all us,' she said.</p>

<p>'Simon was kind, generous and always willing to help out. He was a wonderful friend and work colleague. He was one of those people that everyone liked. </p>

<p>'He always took time out to teach the kids things and just play with them. Whatever they wanted to do. </p>

<p>'He used to like treating them with little dates individually or together. He worked hard to provide for us and wanted to give us nice things and take us on adventures.'</p>

<p>'My kids will definitely keep that memory alive for their new sibling. They will know who their dad was and how much he loved all us,' Lisa said</p>

<p>Finn barely knew his father, just for four short years, before he was suddenly ripped from their lives</p>

<p>Ava was a keen surfer like her dad, having joined the Broadbeach nippers</p>

<p>Lisa said she was devastated by the very thought of Mr Wilson not being at the birth of his child in April 2021.</p>

<p>'He loved our kids so, so much, he would have been excited at hearing the news just as he was with our first two,' she said.</p>

<p>Also agonising was not knowing how and why he died, even after a post-mortem examination, blood tests, and a CT scan.</p>

<p>'I refuse to believe he just drowned due to the conditions, his knowledge of the water and the fact that he never panicked,' she said.</p>

<p>'My daughter keeps asking if we know yet how he died. That's hard to hear when we can't give her any answers.'</p>

<p>Queensland Ambulance at the time said it was believed Mr Wilson had a medical episode while on the surf, but what it was is unknown.</p>

<p>Lisa said she felt barely present in the world since that day and the family couldn't bring themselves to live in their half-renovated house.</p>

<p>Lisa said she refused to believe Mr Wilson drowned due to the conditions, his knowledge of the water and the fact that he never panicked</p>

<p>The 44-year-old was pulled ashore by lifeguards and received 15 minutes of CPR but was unable to be saved (pictured paramedics and lifeguards at the scene on August 6)</p>

<p>The financial impact was also massive, with Lisa left with three children, a huge mortgage, and renovations still to pay for - and the breadwinner gone.</p>

<p>'The thought of having to do my job and his is overwhelming. He did a lot, I don't think I realised how much until he was gone,' she said. </p>

<p>On that front at least, strangers have come to the rescue after close family friend Kate McFall started a fundraiser that has $42,000 in donations.</p>

<p>'Our own hearts break for these two – soon to be three - beautiful children, and Lisa who is now on her own to raise her babies without her soulmate,' she wrote.</p>
