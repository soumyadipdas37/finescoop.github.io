<p>Since March, Melbourne unit prices have plummeted by 5.5 per cent as Sydney's equivalent median value for apartments has dropped by five per cent.</p>

<p>While property prices have fallen in Australia's biggest cities, the story is very different in 11 regional areas where home prices have reached record highs, a CommSec analysis of CoreLogic data showed. </p>

<p>CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless said the ability to work from home and live in a house rather than an apartment had boosted regional home prices.</p>

<p>'Remote working arrangements are no doubt a factor in supporting demand in these markets but lifestyle opportunities and a desire for lower density housing options are also playing a part,' he said.</p>

<p>'Anecdotally, we are also observing a transition of demand away from the cities towards the major regional centres, particularly those that are adjacent to the larger capitals where residents can commute back to the cities if required.'</p>

<p>The Richmond-Tweed area of northern New South Wales, a 90-minute drive from Brisbane across the Queensland border, has a median property price of $594,987.</p>

<p>That is marginally more than Melbourne's median apartment price of $558,952 and significantly less than Sydney's mid-point unit value of $743,288, CoreLogic data for September showed.</p>

<p>For marginally more than that, a duplex house can be bought for $649,000 at Reedy Creek a short drive from the beach at Burleigh Heads.</p>

<p>Regional house prices are continuing to climb as Sydney and Melbourne struggle.</p>

<p>Sydney's median house price in September fell for the fifth straight month, sinking 0.2 per cent to a still-expensive $983,262.</p>

<p>Melbourne's mid-point house value dived by 0.9 per cent to $780,836 - the sixth consecutive month of decline.</p>

<p>Provincial capital cities, however, are continuing to set price records.</p>

<p>Adelaide's median house price rose 0.8 per cent in September to $486,943 while Hobart's mid-point value for a home with a backyard increased by 0.6 per cent to $519,092. </p>

<p>Canberra's equivalent house price edged up 0.2 per cent to $723,634. </p>

<p>Brisbane's middle house price was up 0.4 per cent to $559,646 as records were set in the city's east and Moreton Bay. </p>

<p>Mr Lawless said that unlike regional centres, Sydney and Melbourne had been more reliant on immigration-driven population growth before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>'From a cyclical perspective, regional areas weren't recording the same growth conditions pre-COVID, so home values in these markets are often more affordable and don't have a high base to fall from,' he said. </p>

<p>The Gold Coast's median property price stands at $559,808. For marginally more than that, a duplex house can be bought for $649,000 at Reedy Creek a short drive from the beach at Burleigh Heads</p>
