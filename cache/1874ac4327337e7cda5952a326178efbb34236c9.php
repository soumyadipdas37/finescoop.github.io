<p>Tense: The chat descended into a row between the two reality stars during filming on Thursday</p>

<p>The hit ITVBe reality series resumed filming last month after production was halted in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Amber has been in an on-off relationship with her co-star Dan Edgar since she joined the show two years ago.</p>

<p>Stepping in: At one stage, co-star Chloe Meadow, 27, was seen trying to break up the chat from a distance while Clelia Theodorou looked shocked over the scenes</p>

<p>Friends: Clelia appeared upset by the scenes that unfolded between two of her friends during filming </p>

<p>But Amber and Dan have been stronger than ever after spending lockdown together.</p>

<p>The couple rekindled their romance in May last year after a brief split which saw the Lothario pursue a relationship with his co-star Chloe Sims, 37.</p>

<p>The blonde beauty previously talked about how Dan has become a 'changed man' since they gave their romance another go.    </p>

<p>Argument: Nicole looked upset during the confrontation on the street with her friend Amber </p>

<p>Stylish: During the argument Amber put on a leggy display in a white shirt dress which she layered with a tweed blazer adorned with pearl buttons</p>

<p>Amber told The Sun: 'Sometimes you have to go through really low points in life, and Dan admits what happened was a real low for him. He lost me. I was gone and he wasn't in the best place.</p>

<p>'When you lose someone it makes you realise how much you want them and need them in your life, he's not someone in their mid-20s anymore, he's mature and serious about life.</p>

<p>'Obviously joking around, but he has had his mid-life crisis already. Now he's such a changed person. He's so happy and focused on his future. I'm excited for the future with him.'</p>

<p>Fashionista: Reality star Amber finished her look with a pair of suede knee-high heel boots and styled her blonde locks into a blow-dried hairdo</p>

<p>Tension: Although it was not clear what the argument was about, all will be revealed in the new series airing later this month</p>
