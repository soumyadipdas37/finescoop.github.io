<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A chef has hit back at a TripAdvisor reviewer who slammed his restaurant as a 'total rip off', before announcing his retirement from the customer review website.</p>

<p>Gary Usher, 36, from the Sticky Walnut in Chester, Cheshire, responded to the complaining customer, who warned others to avoid the restaurant 'like the plague' after they were charged £122 for a steak and chips dinner for two.</p>

<p>He urged the customer to 'be kind' to his 'humble neighbourhood bistro' .</p>

<p>The chef then posted his response on Twitter, signing off by announcing he was quitting TripAdvisor after an 'unhealthy 10 year working relationship'. </p>

<p>The online war-of-words began after a review from the account of Ema Linaker, rated Gary's restaurant one star on TripAdvisor.  </p>

<p>Gary Usher, 36, from the Sticky Walnut in Chester, Cheshire, responded to the complaining customer after they left a one star review on TripAdviser</p>

<p>Gary, who once appeared on a Channel 4 documentary, urged the customer to 'be kind' to his 'humble neighbourhood bistro'  (pictured)</p>

<p>The review, which included a picture of a £122.50 receipt from last Friday, said: 'Total rip off! I would never eat here again. </p>

<p>'If you want to pay 45 pounds each for an average piece of sirloin steak and some Parmesan chips then this is the place to go!'  </p>

<p>'A really misleading menu along with eye-wateringly expensive steak which is not worth it'.</p>

<p>The review also accused their waitress of being 'extremely agitated, defensive and frankly rude', before urging people to, 'avoid this place like the plague unless they like being ripped off'.</p>

<p>Gary, who previously appeared in a Channel 4 documentary about one of his restaurants, responded to the customer claiming it was her who was rude not his staff.</p>

<p>He added that the menu has a fixed price of £39 for three courses and that the supplement of dry aged sirloin steak costs an extra £15.</p>

<p>Gary responded: 'I only personally respond on here every few years so well done on getting me out of Twit-advisor hibernation.</p>

<p>'Your last Twit-advisor review was for The Dorchester "to celebrate Mummy's birthday".</p>

<p>The one star review was left by Ema Linaker, who warned others to avoid the restaurant 'like the plague' after they were charged £122 for a three-course dinner for two</p>

<p>She included a picture of the receipt from the Sticky Walnut (pictured), which showed the cost of the meal</p>

<p>Gary responded to the Tripadvisor post where he told the reviewer to 'be kind', adding 'it won't cost you as much as a first class flight to Dubai.'</p>

<p>'Their menu is £53 for 3 courses, also with a supplement for the sharing beef of £22 per person.</p>

<p>'Ironically, we use the same butcher. Why Emma did you not complain about your bill there nor take a photo of your receipt?</p>

<p>'You are a self-professed expert in comms and brand awareness and still manage to be so short sighted not to see how devastating your words can be.'</p>

<p>Gary further advised the reviewer to 'Think before you write' after her scathing review.</p>

<p>'Be kind, it won't cost you as much as a first-class flight to Dubai. Gazza. Brand ambassador &amp; comms'.</p>

<p>Gary captioned the image on Twitter: 'My response is no longer pending. The TripAdvisor site has published it and Emma the reviewer will now have it too.</p>

<p>'Was great to get all your feedback on it yesterday.</p>

<p>'I'd like to announce my retirement from TripAdvisor after an unhealthy 10 year working relationship, farewell'.</p>

<p>A further image posted to Twitter shows Gary deleting the application from his phone.</p>

<p>Gary's tweet has been liked 8,800 times and earned him strong support from social media users.</p>

<p>Gary posted his response on Twitter and vowed to quit Tripadvisor, before sharing a screenshot of him deleting the app from his phone (pictured)</p>

<p>One user wrote: 'People just don't realise how difficult it is trading at the moment.</p>

<p>'Maybe they'll like it better when we are all closed down again and they can go back to 'just eat'.</p>

<p>Laura Barclay wrote: 'Amazing,' while another added: 'Making a mental note to visit your place if I'm in Chester. Good luck to you and your team'.</p>

<p>Gary made headlines in 2018 after a customer complained about the Sticky Walnut's lack of 'customer skills' after staff were asked to go shop for lemonade for a red wine spritzer.</p>

<p>Gary shot down the customer saying; 'We often nip out for people's requests. It's part of great hospitality. We just don't do it if you're a rude c***'.</p>

<p>Gary starred in a Channel 4 documentary in 2019 called The Rebel Chef: My Restaurant Revolution.</p>

<p>The documentary follows the opening of one of his crowdfunded bistros Pinion in the Merseyside Town of Prescot.</p>
