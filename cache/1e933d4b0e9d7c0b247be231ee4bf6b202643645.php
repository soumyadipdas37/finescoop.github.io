<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Germany said today it has 'unequivocal proof' that Russian dissident Alexei Navalny was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok. </p>

<p>Tests carried out at a military laboratory found evidence of the Soviet-era chemical weapon that was used to attack Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018.</p>

<p>Navalny remains in a coma in a Berlin hospital nearly two weeks after collapsing on a plane in Siberia which made an emergency landing when he suddenly fell ill. </p>

<p>Germany today condemned the 'alarming' poison plot and demanded an urgent explanation from Moscow, which has denied any involvement in Navalny's illness.  </p>

<p>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - pictured, centre, shortly before he fell ill on August 20 - is in a coma at a German hospital after allegedly being poisoned  </p>

<p>Germany says it will inform its partners in the EU and Nato about the test results and consult with them 'on an appropriate joint response'. </p>

<p>Russia's ambassador in Berlin will also be called in to hear about the test results - after the Kremlin played down preliminary findings that Navalny was poisoned. </p>

<p>In an initial response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian media that Moscow had not yet been informed of Germany's findings.  </p>

<p>Friends of Navalny have suggested his tea was spiked in an airport cafe in Tomsk where he was pictured shortly before boarding the flight. </p>

<p>A former Soviet scientist separately suggested that assassins could have broken into Navalny's hotel room and sprinkled poison on his clothes. </p>

<p>After Navalny fell ill, the aircraft made an emergency landing in Omsk and the Putin critic was initially taken to hospital in the Siberian city. </p>

<p>The following weekend he was transferred to Berlin, where doctors have been treating him with the antidote atropine. </p>

<p>Berlin's Charite hospital said in an initial statement last week that clinical tests 'indicate poisoning with a substance from the group of cholinesterase inhibitors', which are used in medicines and insecticides but also in nerve agents. </p>

<p>'The specific substance involved remains unknown, and a further series of comprehensive testing has been initiated,' the hospital said. </p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that allegations of Kremlin involvement 'absolutely cannot be true and are rather an empty noise'. </p>

<p>Peskov accused the German medics of 'rushing' to use the word poisoning, saying: 'For the moment, all you and I see is that the patient is in a coma.' </p>

<p>'We don't understand why our German colleagues are in such a hurry. The substance hasn't yet been established,' he told reporters.   </p>

<p>But Germany's announcement today said that toxicological tests at an army laboratory had found 'unequivocal evidence' of a nerve agent in the 'Novichok family'. </p>

<p>The military specialists were called in at the instigation of Charite hospital medics, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.  </p>

<p>Angela Merkel and her top ministers discussed the findings this afternoon and the government says it 'condemns this attack in the strongest terms'.  </p>

<p>Navalny's wife Yulia, who has visited him every day in hospital without making any public comment, has also been informed of the test results.  </p>

<p>Navalny's allies have pointed the finger at Russian president Vladimir Putin (pictured) after the opposition leader fell ill, but the Kremlin has dismissed the claims </p>

<p>Earlier, Vladimir Uglev, a former Soviet scientist who helped invent Novichok, said assassins could have sprinkled a deadly toxin on Navalny's socks or underwear. </p>

<p>Uglev, 73, said Russian secret service operatives could have broken into Navalny's hotel in Tomsk to leave a minuscule drop of poison in his luggage.  </p>

<p>He said a dose of toxin less than one-thirtieth the size of a drop of water might have been enough to poison Navalny.  </p>

<p>'They put this substance on his underwear, his underpants, socks, or his undershirt, and that was it,' said the retired scientist. </p>

<p>'In the morning Alexei woke up, showered, got dressed and went to the airport.</p>

<p>'And since the substance acts slower via the skin than say through the digestive system, time passed [before it had an impact].' </p>

<p>Uglev 'categorically' denied that Novichok was used to hit Navalny, saying that more people would have suffered poisoning if it had been. </p>

<p>Uglev has previously spoken of his role in creating Novichok, the nerve agent believed to have been used to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. </p>

<p>Russia also denies involvement in the Skripal plot, but the suspects in the 2018 assassination attempt have been linked to the GRU intelligence service.  </p>

<p>Navalny arrives at Berlin's Tegel Airport last Saturday after he was airlifted from Russia. He remains in a medically induced coma at the German hospital</p>

<p>German medics have also asked for assistance from authorities in the UK and Bulgaria, both with experience of previous poisonings.  </p>

<p>Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday rejected claims that Russia was failing to investigate how Navalny fell into a coma.</p>

<p>'We are being accused of not investigating this situation. This is not true,' he said.</p>

<p>'Starting the very day this happened, our Interior Ministry initiated pre-investigative inspections.'</p>

<p>A full probe would begin once it is determined what happened, he said, while adding that German medics were also uncertain how Navalny became sick.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Russian prosecutors have asked Germany to provide Navalny's biomaterial for investigations.</p>

<p>Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level corruption and mobilising protests. </p>

<p>He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings, sued over corruption investigations and barred from running in the 2018 presidential election.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old has also served several stints in jail in recent years for organising anti-Kremlin protests. </p>

<p>The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia's arrests and detention of Navalny in 2012 and 2014 were politically motivated.    </p>
