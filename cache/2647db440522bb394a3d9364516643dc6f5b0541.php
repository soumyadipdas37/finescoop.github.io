<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nigella Lawson has said sorry for comments she made in a newspaper column 27 years ago suggesting that surgery to change gender was 'mutilating' the body. </p>

<p>The cook and author, 60, tweeted an apology to Christie Elan-Cane, who campaigns for non-gendered people to be recognised, over the article written for the Evening Standard in 1993.</p>

<p>In the article, Lawson had commented on an appearance by Elan-Cane on a Radio 4 programme called Tuesday Lives at the time, in which they'd talked about surgery to erase their gender. </p>

<p>Lawson's response in her then column was unsympathetic to Elan-Cane's desire to have surgery to remove their breasts and womb, calling it 'self-mutilation', 'brutal' and 'with no medical justification'. </p>

<p>Campaigner for non-gendered people, Christie Elan-Cane, has spent 27 years waiting for an apology over comments made by Lawson, 60, in October 1993 in her then column for the Evening Standard</p>

<p>Nigella Lawson, pictured in London in February, responded to Elan-Cane on Twitter saying she was 'very glad to have the opportunity to apologise. While I certainly meant no harm, unfortunately that doesn’t mean I didn’t harm'</p>

<p>Elan-Cane posted this week saying they were still seeking an apology from the television star for the comments made nearly 30 years ago. </p>

<p>In the piece, Nigella had responded to the broadcast in which Elan-Cane had expressed their wish to have surgery saying: 'Of course it's Christie Elan-Cane's body - hers to mutilate as she wishes. But behind the desire for self-mutilation surely lies the most troubling self-hatred.'</p>

<p>She added later: 'I can't help feeling that what she needed was help not surgery.' </p>

<p>In their most recent response, Elan-Cane wrote: '<?php echo e('@'); ?>Nigella_Lawson didn't care about me when she wrote this offensive diatribe in <?php echo e('@'); ?>EveningStandard that was read by millions in London &amp; across the south east. And I don't care if I have to shout from the rooftops that she should apologise now for these disgusting comments...'</p>

<p>The article written by the author and cook in the Evening Standard in 1993, it was responding to a Radio 4 programme called Tuesday Lives at the time, in which Elan-Cane had talked about surgery to erase their gender</p>

<p>The campaigner followed up with another comment, saying: As I said before, I'm not letting this go. <?php echo e('@'); ?>Nigella_Lawson 's words <?php echo e('@'); ?>EveningStandard Oct '93 to be precise. No apology in 27 years. Has she changed? I don't know. I don't care. No #trans ally of mine.'</p>

<p>Lawson responded to the tweets with an apology, saying she was pleased to have been given the chance to say sorry. </p>

<p>She wrote: 'And I am very glad to have the opportunity to apologise. While I certainly meant no harm, unfortunately that doesn’t mean I didn’t harm. And I’m sorry. I hope that the past 27 years have been rich and happy ones for you.' </p>

<p>The apology was accepted by Elan-Cane, with Lawson thanking them, penning: 'I appreciate that very much. Thank you for your gracious response.' </p>
