<p>The Cronulla centre has a week to respond to a breach notice handed down by the NRL on Tuesday as he faces a four-year ban from any World Anti-Doping Agency-compliant sport.</p>

<p>Bronson Xerri's NRL career is hanging by a thread after confirmation his B sample tested positive to anabolic steroids</p>

<p>Xerri (pictured with girlfriend Amy Curmi) can either plead guilty or face the NRL's anti-doping tribunal to explain why he should not be rubbed out of the game</p>

<p>The 19-year-old has been stood down from the NRL since late May after returning a positive test for a number of banned substances, including testosterone, androsterone and etiocholanolone.</p>

<p>All are prohibited by WADA and the NRL's anti-doping policy.</p>

<p>He was originally tested in November last year, with his positive result taking six months to be received by the NRL and Cronulla.</p>

<p>Xerri did not play the opening two games of the season for the Sharks as he recovered from shoulder surgery.</p>
