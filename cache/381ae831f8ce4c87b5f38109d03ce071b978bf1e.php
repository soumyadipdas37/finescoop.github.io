<p>Outspoken vegan blogger Freelee the Banana Girl has shared a photo of her body at 24 years old on a meat-heavy diet compared to today after celebrating her 40th birthday</p>

<p>'I just got back excellent blood tests and the doctor said "you are in ideal shape, keep doing what you are doing". People said I would start to breakdown after four years, 10 years... well 14 years later and I'm only improving with age.' </p>

<p>Showing off startling images comparing her 24-year-old body to her 40-year-old physique Freelee claimed she is fitter than ever before and didn't require any 'caffeine, excessive exercise, pills, medication or calorie restriction' to change her body.</p>

<p>She claims her hair is softer, she has lost 18 kilos, has overcome hypothyroidism, doesn't have eczema anymore and has healed the chilblains she would get on her fingers over the past decade.</p>

<p>Freelee subscribes to the 'raw until four' diet - meaning she eats no cooked or heated food whatsoever until 4pm - and blends up to 15 bananas daily into smoothies.</p>

<p>She claims her hair is softer, she has lost 18 kilos, has overcome hypothyroidism, doesn't have eczema anymore and has healed the chilblains she would get on her fingers over the past decade</p>

<p>She starts the day by eating half a watermelon with a spoon, before cutting four 'ice cream' bananas off a tree in her backyard to snack on.</p>

<p>Lunch is typically 'banana nice cream' - a homemade dairy-free ice cream - before she polishes off some organic Turkish figs and a papaya.</p>

<p>Dinner will often be a coconut curry with vegetable 'dippers' as a side followed by a dessert of durian ice cream.</p>

<p>In total her meals equate to 2,700 calories - or 11,200 kilojoules - a day.  </p>

<p>In 2018 she announced she was moving off the grid to live in the South American jungle, but in a recent video she could be seen eating Woolworths Macro organic produce, signalling that the pair have returned Down Under.</p>

<p>Some of her 290,000 followers online were curious to know what she eats each day to maintain her toned physique, so Freelee obliged with a tell-all TikTok video on September 19. </p>

<p>She labels herself a 'frugivore' on social media, which is a word that describes animals who live off raw fruits, succulent fruit-like vegetables, roots, shoots, nuts and seeds. </p>

<p>Freelee has been criticised in the past for using her platform to shame celebrity diets  that include meat and dairy but she continues to upload them to her YouTube channel, The Frugivore.</p>

<p>The vegan blogger first rose to internet notoriety after claiming to eat 51 bananas a day - although she doesn't eat quite so many today</p>

<p>Two years ago she also caused a stir for saying she no longer shaved her body hair, and had saved $4,000 by throwing away her makeup, shampoo and razors.</p>

<p>She claims an extreme, low processed, low-fat, high-carb raw vegan diet - including a daily consumption of bananas - is the key to gut health and her enviable abs. </p>

<p>Leanne discovered raw veganism in 2001 and often tells her legion of fans that it saved her life. </p>
