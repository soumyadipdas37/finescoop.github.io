<p>She said: 'So just because I've seen so many questions on my InTheStyle Q&amp;A about what surgery I've had, I just thought I'd let you all know because I'm not going to hide anything and I was going to tell you all anyway.</p>

<p>'I have had liposuction on my lower legs, so my calves, because I was recently diagnosed with lipoedema, once I'd come out of the [love Island] villa.</p>

<p>Mystery solved: The Love Island star, 26, shared a snap of herself going into surgery last week, as well as her legs in bandages – but didn't disclose the nature of her treatment </p>

<p>'I've kind of always had an insecurity about my legs, but there were so many questions about if I'd ever been diagnosed with lipoedema, and I didn't even know what it was.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'So after some research and going to the doctors, I was finally diagnosed and then had my surgery on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'I'm recovering, I'm doing really well. I've got make-up on today, I've brushed my hair today and, yeah, I'm just really looking forward to kind of the process of it.</p>

<p>'It's not an overnight thing, I have to keep up with my compression garments and things like that, but so far so good.'</p>

<p>Telling all: During a Q&amp;A with fans on Instagram on Sunday, the TV personality shared the nature of her surgery, after being diagnosed with lipodema</p>

<p>A second picture showed her legs covered in bandages from her thigh to her ankles, with her feet poking out at the bottom.</p>

<p>Referring to her feet, Shaughna, who appeared on Love Island at the start of the year when the series filmed in South Africa, joked: 'Hello swollen tootsies.'</p>

<p>As she unveiled her latest range on Sunday afternoon, she wrote: 'Cannot believe this is now my 4th official <?php echo e('@'); ?>inthestyle range!! Your support has been amazing and I hope you love this one!</p>

<p>'None of this would be possible without your support, these are as much OUR collections as they are mine.' </p>

<p>In June, Shaughna hit back at a troll who accused her of undergoing secret surgery during lockdown in the comments section of her Instagram page. </p>

<p>The reality star, who was told she looked 'better before fillers' while on the show, questioned when she would have had injections during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
