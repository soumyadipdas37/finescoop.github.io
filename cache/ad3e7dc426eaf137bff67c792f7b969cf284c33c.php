<p>The clip shows Paul opening a door and jumping back as he sees his daughter. Medow said of the clip 'I never thought I’d share this,'</p>

<p>Meadow, who spent most of her childhood living with her mother in Hawaii, decided to move to California and live with her dad a year before his death</p>

<p>According to documents obtained by The Blast, Meadow reached an agreement with Porsche, with both parties requesting the wrongful death case be dismissed.</p>

<p>The terms of the resolution were kept confidential.</p>

<p>She sued the company in 2015, claiming her father had survived the crash initially but was burned alive because he was trapped by his seatbelt.</p>

<p>The lawsuit also claimed Porsche knew the Carrera GT 'had a history of instability and control issues'.  </p>

<p>Law enforcement previously ruled the cause of the crash was speeding at rates between 80mph and 93mph.</p>

<p>The car careered off the road into a concrete lamp post and two trees and burst into flames.</p>
