<p>The recipe was shared on TikTok by Australian parenting blogger Mama Mila, who claims it's a clever way to eliminate odours without spraying toxic chemicals.</p>

<p>In the video, the mum-of-two, from Melbourne, pours rice into a glass jar and adds 10 drops of sweet-smelling oil on top, then covers it with a lid before shaking the contents together.</p>

<p>'Try this one out for your shoe closet,' Mila wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>Replying to comments under the clip, she said the jar should last 'four to six months' depending on the size of the room or closet it's placed in.</p>

<p>Uncooked rice is a natural deodoriser that absorbs smells, flavours and moisture that hang in the air.</p>

<p>Its moisture-absorbing properties also prevent silver from tarnishing, which is why some people keep a small muslin bag of rice at the back of their cutlery drawer.</p>

<p>Mila's video drew delighted responses after it was posted online with comments including 'this is amazing' and 'I will definitely be trying this'. </p>

<p>'You're a genius!' one woman replied.</p>

<p>Another said she was 'very smart' and thanked her for sharing a natural alternative to toxic household sprays.</p>

<p>And it's not the first time the Melbourne mother has shared handy home tips on social media.</p>

<p>In June, Mila shared another video revealing her five-step cleaning regime for achieving hotel-style bedding.</p>

<p>First, she strips the bed, removing sheets and throws so she can vacuum the mattress. This removes dirt and grim lurking out of sight.</p>

<p>Next, she mixes baking soda with essential oil and sprinkles it over the mattress, leaving it to soak for a few hours to infuse a sweet scent.</p>

<p>While the mattress soaks, Mila washes sheets and pillowcases with half a cup of white vinegar to enhance brightness.</p>

<p>She also adds baking soda and forgoes fabric softener to avoid residue caking onto her linen.</p>

<p>Once everything is dry, she remakes the bed with clean sheets and spritzes natural linen spray to leave it fresh for days to come.</p>

<li><p>Mix baking soda with essential oil in a glass container and then sprinkle the mixture over your mattress.</p></li>
<li><p>Wash your linen and sheets at the same time, and wash pillows and duvet covers every three to six months, leaving them to dry outside ideally.</p></li>
<li><p>Vacuum up the excess baking soda and re-make your bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish with linen spray.</p></li>

<p>In June, Mila impressed millions with her five-step cleaning regime for hotel-style bed linen </p>

<p>'Treat yourself to a good night's sleep with this spring cleaning hack,' Mila wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>Over two million people have watched the clip, with hundreds posting comments about how much it has changed their bedroom cleaning regime.</p>

<p>'Legit [sic] trying this right now,' one woman said.</p>

<p>A second who followed the advice suggested leaving sheets and doona covers to dry outside instead of tumble drying them for a fresher finish.</p>

<p>'Oh my god, just looking at this I would never want to leave the bed,' added a third.</p>
