<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gonzalo Higuain will become the best-paid player in the MLS once he puts pen to paper on a deal with Inter Miami, according to reports in America.</p>

<p>The Argentine striker agreed a £2.3million payoff with Juventus last week to terminate his contract a year early, a move which has left him free to join David Beckham's fledgling franchise.</p>

<p>And the Miami Herald claim the 32-year-old will outearn his new boss, with the report stating Higuain will earn a base salary of £5.45m ($7m) at Inter, where he will join former Juventus team-mate Blaise Matuidi.</p>

<p>That figure is a touch more than the £5m ($6.5m) base salary that Forbes claim Beckham had inserted into his LA Galazy contract during his five-year MLS stint.</p>

<p>Higuain has also signed a two-and-a-half year contract with Beckham's fledgling franchise to see him through to the end of the 2022 season.</p>

<p>The move will also see him closer to brother Federico, who has spent the last eight years in MLS and moved to DC United in March after seven-and-a-half seasons with Columbus Crew.</p>

<p>While the Herons are yet to officially announce the deal, co-owner Jorge Mas has posted a photo with the 32-year-old at Miami airport welcoming him to the club. </p>

<p>And the Miami Herald claims he will outearn Beckham with a base salary of £5.45million</p>

<p>Coach Diego Alonso also confirmed the ex-Chelsea and Real Madrid forward had come for a medical and hoped to have him join up with his squad soon.</p>

<p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the highest-paid MLS player in 2019 but has now re-joined AC Milan after leaving LA Galaxy last year.</p>

<p>Figures released by the MLS Player Association suggest the Swedish striker, 38, earned a base salary of £5.6m ($7.2m) in 2019.</p>

<p>Forbes claims Beckham received a base salary of £5m during his five-year stint at LA Galaxy</p>

<p>That put him slightly ahead of Toronto duo Michael Bradley on £4.7m ($6m base) and Jozy Altidore on £3.8m ($4.9m base). </p>

<p>Inter Miami are in desperate need of a goalscorer in their debut MLS season, with all seven of their losses coming via a single-goal margin.</p>

<p>They currently sit bottom of the Eastern Conference after just two wins in 11 games, but they will be buoyed by a signing who scored 66 goals in 148 appearances for Juventus, winning three Serie A titles and two Coppa Italias.</p>
