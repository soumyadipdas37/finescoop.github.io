<p>'For the first five weeks, I went to the Gold Coast before the borders closed to be with mum and dad,' she said.</p>

<p>'I could not see how I could juggle work and Tullulah and everything that comes with everyday life without Buddy there to help out.'</p>

<p>The former Miss Universe Australia has since returned to Sydney, and admitted that she and Tullulah were 'really missing Buddy'.  </p>

<p>Support: Jesinta admitted that it was 'a juggle' without Buddy around, but she was being supported by her family</p>

<p>Juggling act: 'I certainly cannot do it all - and I think the expectation or that thought that we can just puts so much pressure on us as women,' Jesinta said</p>

<p>But the mother of one has been getting some help since returning home.</p>

<p>'I proudly say that my little girl is home with my sister now, and I had a housekeeper come in on Monday to help me with the washing, and I'm having my dinners delivered,' she said.</p>
