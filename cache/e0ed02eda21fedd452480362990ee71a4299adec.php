<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sydneysiders left feeling claustrophobic by coronavirus border closures can take a well-earned break - by holidaying in a newly refurbished penthouse suite in their own city. </p>

<p>Instead of sitting at home with crossed fingers hoping for Australia to open up, residents can pack their carry-on suitcases for a COVID-safe weekend staycation at Fraser Suites.</p>

<p>Standing tall on Kent Street, near Town Hall, the five-star furnished apartment tower allows guests to see Sydney from new heights after a multi-million dollar makeover.</p>

<p>Australians have been flocking to enjoy luxury stayactions since lockdowns were lifted in every state but Victoria, with border closures stopping holidaymakers from heading overseas. </p>

<p>For those wanting a spa experience, the complex boasts its own private swimming pool and gym, with coronavirus number limits to keep guests distanced. </p>

<p>The two-bedroom Sydney penthouse offers floor to ceiling windows to put the city on display, with views sprawling out to the western suburbs, the airport in the south and the east coast.  </p>

<p>Guests can take a break from the uncertainty of the pandemic by lounging in front of the TV, reading a book while looking out to the city skyline or taking a dip in the pool.</p>

<p>The suites are a stone's throw away from Darling Harbour, where guests can take an afternoon stroll and bask in the spring sunshine.</p>

<p>Fraser Suites is also a brief walk to Sydney's main shopping strip, Pitt Street Mall, allowing staycationers to enjoy a shopping spree.</p>

<p>The building backs on to Regent Place Shopping Centre, where visitors can treat themselves to some of the city's most trendy restaurants. </p>

<p>Guests can dine on luxury Asian-inspired dishes, including rock lobster seafood hotpot, Peking duck and pork and cabbage dumplings. </p>

<p>The restaurant, with full COVID-safe measures in place, also offers dinner to takeaway if guests want to enjoy the penthouse's evening views or avoid city crowds.   </p>

<p>Fraser Suites has carefully implemented its own COVID-19 safety procedures to give guests peace of mind during their stay.</p>

<p>There are safety screens at the reception desk and hotel staff are required to cover their faces, while all guests entering the building must fill in the QR Code form.</p>

<p>Inside the rooms, Fraser Suites made the difficult but necessary decision to halt luxury bathrobes, slippers, coffee machines and dinner service to ensure safety. </p>

<p>The gym remains open seven days a week with social distancing enforced, while only six people are allowed in the pool area at one time. </p>

<p>'With this in mind, staying at Fraser Suites Sydney gives our guests an opportunity to rediscover our beautiful city,' he said.</p>

<p>'Our superb location is a gateway to all attractions that Sydney has on offer, including great dining options, shopping and entertainment.'</p>

<p>Mr Pilarski said popular tourist destinations such as the Queen Victoria Building, Darling Harbour and Chinatown are on the 'door step'.</p>

<p>'We offer a range of comfortable, sophisticated and functional studio rooms and one and two bedroom apartments,' he said.</p>

<p>'Our spacious and luxurious serviced apartments provide a true home-away-from-home experience, perfect for a short or a longer stay.' </p>
