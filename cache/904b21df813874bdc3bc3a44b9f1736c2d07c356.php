<p>The comedian, 66, also said 'the Asian community who have big families are taking no notice' of coronavirus restrictions and are living in 'a bubble of 300 in a f****** house'.</p>

<p>Furious viewers quickly rushed to Twitter to condemn the comedian's YouTube video - titled 'Who Needs Diversity?' -  as 'racist'. </p>

<p>In the video, the Generation Game host says: 'Diversity, what the f*** do you want?'</p>

<p>Diversity took to the Britain's Got Talent stage earlier this month for a raw performance inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

<p>Jim Davidson has sparked outrage after posting a racist YouTube rant suggesting dance troupe Diversity do a routine about black men mugging people</p>

<p>Led by dancer Ashley Banjo, the former champions opened the performance by reciting a viral poem The Great Realisation by the singer Tomfoolery, about the BLM movement and police brutality. </p>

<p>During their performance, the group also narrated the death of George Floyd who died after police officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25 for nearly nine minutes.    </p>

<p>In his expletive-laden rant, Davidson adds: 'You just want to be famous all around the world - you don't give a f*** about George [Floyd].'</p>

<p>He goes on to say: 'You don't see white couples on adverts anymore, do you? Most TV presenters are non-white.</p>

<p>'The Golden Girls, you know that film The Golden Girls with all them old birds? That's being made by black people.'</p>

<p>The comedian, 66, also said 'the Asian community who have big families are taking no notice' of coronavirus restrictions and are living in 'a bubble of 300 in a f****** house'</p>

<p>He continues: 'There's loads of white people sticking up for you, sticking up for Black Lives Matter - young white girls walking around with banners.</p>

<p>'Well, I say most young girls, Gemma's sister is not holding up a banner as she was violently mugged by three black men. Perhaps Diversity can do a mugging thing.'</p>

<p>He also suggested that the actions of the BAME community may account for an increase in Covid-19 cases in certain regions of England.</p>

<p>He says: 'We are now going back down the snake because people are not bothering.</p>

<p>'The BAME community, what the f*** does that mean? The Asian community who have big families are taking no notice and staying together.</p>

<p>'They have a bubble of 300 in a f****** house. This is why it is happening in these areas. These areas are predominantly BAME areas.</p>

<p>'So f****** sort yourselves out, instead of walking around doing knees and protesting. Save your family.'</p>

<p>Viewers quickly took to social media to condemn his views.</p>

<p>Lorraine King wrote: 'Archaic, washed-up, unfunny "comedian" complains about black people wanting equality, says too many black people are in adverts and on TV, and rants about black people committing crimes.</p>

<p>'Jim Davidson is irrelevant so is clearly seeking attention.'</p>

<p>In response to her post, Penelope added: 'I think the word you're looking for (missing) is racist.</p>

<p>'Jim wants to live in the 70s where he could tell his racist jokes to thunderous applause. </p>

<p>'He's always been vile, as are those who support, follow and agree with him.'</p>

<p>Jan Owen added: 'Comedian Jim Davidson’s attack in a video I just watched on FB is an utter disgrace. </p>

<p>Viewers quickly took to social media to condemn Davidson's controversial views</p>

<p>'The man is, always has been, and always will be blatantly racist. Shame on him and shame on FB for allowing it on their social media platform!'</p>

<p>At the start of this year, it was revealed that Davidson was to be grilled by police over claims he told a black train attendant 'you aren't welcome in this country' in a row over the star's over-60s rail pass, according to a witness.</p>

<p>The comedian, 66, admitted he was involved in a row at Euston station in October but insisted the Virgin worker was white and that his comments were 'sarcastic'.</p>

<p>Author Paul Blanchard saw it unfold and made the complaint about the star's behaviour - telling police the man was black.</p>

<p>He told The Sun in January: 'I've been asked to provide further statements and the police officer handling the case said they're pulling Jim in to speak this week.</p>

<p>'It's been three months but I'm glad they are doing something'.</p>

<p>Mr Davidson previously admitted to telling the train attendant to 'f*** off' but claimed he was a South African white man and had acted in a threatening manner.</p>

<p>Davidson added: 'I wasn't racist and the man was white. I've spoken to the police and told them what happened.</p>

<p>'I did say: ''Welcome to our country'', in a sarcastic manner, because I couldn't help myself.'</p>

<p>But Mr Blanchard insisted the man was black and added: 'Jim repeatedly used the same kind of dismissive and abusive language.'</p>
