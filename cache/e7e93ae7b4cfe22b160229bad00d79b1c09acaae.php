<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the shocking moment a Mexican military humvee barreled through the metal entrance gates of an apartment complex to arrest 11 cartel members.</p>

<p>The incident took place on Thursday after a police unit requested backup when they spotted alleged members of Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán's old Sinaloa Cartel firing their weapons for no reason in the middle of an avenue in Culiacán, Sinaloa.</p>

<p>Members of Mexico's National Guard, Army, Marines, and the Sinaloa state police joined together for the bust.</p>

<p>At least 11 alleged members of the Sinaloa Cartel were arrested at a residential complex in Sinaloa, Mexico, last Thursday. Pictured above is a security forces humvee before it smashed through a metal gate</p>

<p>Footage captured by a surveillance camera at the Culiacán residential complex La Condesa showed the large vehicle speeding through the closed metal gate.</p>

<p>At least seven state police pickup trucks and a second Humvee followed it inside the building's parking lot. Seven masked security force members ran inside ready to open fire with their rifles.</p>

<p>According to the Sinaloa Public Security Ministry, the armed agents locked down the building and captured the purported Sinaloa Cartel members within an hour without exchanging any fire.</p>

<p>Public Security Ministry chief Cristóbal Castañeda Camarillo said security forces seized weapons and vehicles from the cartel members, whose identities were not revealed to the press.</p>

<p>No shots were exchanged between Mexican security forces and the 11 alleged members of the Sinaloa Cartel who were apprehended last Thursday after they were seeing firing their weapons in the middle of a street in Culiacán, Sinaloa</p>

<p>The operation unfolded 11 months after an operation to capture El Chapo's son, Ovidio Guzmán, quickly converting Culiacán into a war zone in broad daylight that left 13 people dead as the cartel and security forces exchanged fire.</p>

<p>The October 17, 2019 mission headed by the National Guard to serve a United States extradition request was called off by Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.</p>

<p>'I ordered that operation be stopped and that this alleged criminal be released,' López Obrador said in June. </p>

<p>'The decision was made when it was decided not to put the population at risk so that civilians were not affected because more than 200 people would lose their lives if we did not suspend the operation in Culiacán,' López Obrador said. </p>

<p>Mexican security forces got wind of Guzmán's location after officials in Washington pushed for his extradition to shut down the Sinaloa Cartel's alleged fentanyl trafficking to the United States. </p>
