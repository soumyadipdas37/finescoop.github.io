<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sam Burgess made headlines in July when he revealed that Kanye West had called him 'poor' to his face at a London hotel five years ago.</p>

<p>And on Thursday, the former NRL star, 31, cheekily hit back at the American rapper by offering to send him a 'care package for rich people'.</p>

<p>He told Fitzy &amp; Wippa that his 4B clothing label - which he runs with his brothers, Luke, Thomas and George - was sending out free samples to the Stronger hitmaker.</p>

<p>'I'm trying to get a care package to him': Sam Burgess (pictured) revealed he is planning to send Kanye West a 'care package' of clothes for 'rich people' from his clothing label - 4B - after the rapper called the former NRL star 'poor' at a London hotel five years ago</p>

<p>'Funnily enough me and my brothers are designing some clothes at the moment as well, and we're trying to get a care package of our 4B label sent to Kanye,' he said.</p>

<p>'I'm thinking about writing to him saying, "Hey, here's a care package, we design clothes for rich people like you,"' Sam chuckled.</p>

<p>The saga involving Kanye and Sam began two months ago, when actor Russell Crowe shared a surprising story about an encounter he'd witnessed between the two men at a London hotel in 2015.</p>

<p>Care package on its way! Sam told the radio show that he is planning on sending Kanye (pictured) clothes from his brand. 'I'm thinking about writing to him saying "hey, here's a care package, we design clothes for rich people like you," he laughed</p>

<p>The Gladiator star, 56, claimed on Nova FM that Kanye, 43, had become annoyed with Sam for drunkenly singing along to his hit single FourFiveSeconds.</p>

<p>Days later, Sam appeared on the same radio program and confirmed that the meeting did indeed happen.</p>

<p>The now-retired South Sydney Rabbitohs player also claimed the Grammy winner had actually called him 'poor' to his face.</p>

<p>Witness: The Kanye and Sam saga began back in July, when actor Russell Crowe (pictured) shared a surprising story about an encounter between the two men. The actor claimed the rapper became annoyed with Sam's drunkenly singing along to his hit song FourFiveSeconds</p>

<p>The English sportsman said: 'It was a weird night! I had driven from Bath over to the Dorchester [hotel] for a session with Rusty at China Tong down there and we were just sitting there and the drinks were flowing, as usual as they are with me and Rusty.</p>

<p>'Kanye just walked in the room and sat down... I didn't think it was Kanye at the start because he was so small. I couldn't believe it!'</p>

<p>He said the Gold Digger hitmaker was showing everyone in the room his designs for Yeezy sneakers, and Sam asked him what his inspiration was.</p>

<p>Who are you? Sam confirmed the meeting did indeed happen and said the Gold Digger hitmaker was showing everyone his designs for Yeezy sneakers. Sam asked Kanye what his inspiration was, 'He goes, "Oh, I'm making clothes for poor people just like you" </p>

<p>'He goes, "Oh, I'm making clothes for poor people just like you,"' Sam said. </p>

<p>'I was kind of chuffed that he called me poor. I thought, "Oh yeah, I'm a peasant! Come and eat dinner at my table if you want, Kanye. It's fine!"' </p>

<p>A source later told New Idea that Kanye had dismissed the footy star as poor simply because 'he had no idea who he was'.</p>

<p>The insider said that Kanye didn't quite know how to handle the 'boorish' Yorkshireman, who'd had a few drinks by the time they met. </p>

<p>Funny story: On Wednesday, Fitzy and Wippa asked if he and Russell Crowe had talked about the incident since, Sam (pictured) said: 'No there wasn't any back-and-forth. But Sam was surprised there was plenty of interest in the story, adding: 'I think everyone seemed to enjoy it'</p>
