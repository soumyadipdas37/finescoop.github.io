<p>Not worried! Jamie Laing has insisted that the infamous Strictly curse won't come between him and his long-term girlfriend Sophie Habboo</p>

<p>He said of the curse - which has struck down couples throughout the show's 16 years on the air, seeing celebs get together with their pro partners, dancers split from their real-life spouses and celebrities' marriages not survive the course of the show - that he is being asked repeatedly about it.</p>

<p>'I am being asked all the time about the Strictly curse and do you know poor Sophie had no clue about this whole curse thing,' Jamie said. 'She had no idea that everyone couples up when they do Strictly Come Dancing.</p>

<p>'But, hey listen, I don’t think I am a bad guy so I don’t think it will be too bad in the end.</p>

<p>'I am not going to kiss my dancer. It is not like I am going to be some magnet, you know? I don’t think the dancer is going to come anywhere near me.'</p>

<p>He's back: Habbs, 26, stood by Jamie, 31, last year, when he originally signed up for Strictly Come Dancing, having to pull out when he injured his foot in rehearsals</p>

<p>Going strong: The Made In Chelsea pairing have been together for nearly two years, despite rocky beginnings</p>
