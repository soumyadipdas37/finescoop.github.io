<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>LG has unveiled a face mask with built-in fans and filters dubbed a 'wearable air purifier' - but hasn't said whether it will protect the wearer from coronavirus. </p>

<p>The battery-powered PuriCare Wearable Air Purifier mask includes two H13 HEPA filters, similar to those used in home air purifying products.</p>

<p>The company says it also features dual fans and a respiratory sensor that can automatically adjust the fan speed in line with the wearer's breathing speed. </p>

<p>LG hasn't announced a release date or a price for its new product, but says it will enable the user to breathe clean air both indoors and outside.</p>

<p>While the firm hasn't said whether it protects against Covid-19 it says it is designed to replace ill-fitting homemade face covers and disposable masks in short supply. </p>

<p>It hasn't said exactly what the new air purifier mask will filter out, as LG says it is waiting for testing and certification before revealing any specific details. </p>

<p>The company say is also features dual fans and a respiratory sensor that can automatically adjust the fan speed in line with the wearer's breathing speed</p>

<p>The battery can last up to eight hours on a single charge, and the device comes with a case which houses UV-LED lights, which kill germs between uses. </p>

<p>The eight hours is a maximum though, and when the fan is operating in 'low mode'. At the higher speed modes for more intense environments it can last up to two hours.</p>

<p>The two hours on high would be in an environment with a temperature of about 77 degrees Fahrenheit, and other factors such as pollution can reduce the time. </p>

<p>Like most modern wearable technology products, it also comes with a partner app and the mask can send it alerts to say when the filters need to be replaced.</p>

<p>LG said the mask could help solve the problem of homemade masks being of inconsistent quality and disposable masks being in short supply.</p>

<p>It hasn't directly confirmed if it was built in response to Covid-19, but one executive said in July that the company would donate 2,000 of the masks to a university hospital in Seoul, to help medical staff cope with the pandemic.</p>

<p>There are no claims about using the mask to slow the spread of coronavirus in this latest announcement or whether the filters will stop the virus.</p>

<p>The firm told MailOnline it was waiting for certification and testing to be completed before giving full details about the protection the mask provides.  </p>

<p>High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) is a standard for air filters.</p>

<p>To meet the HEPA standard they must meet certain levels of efficiency including removing most particles over a certain size.</p>

<p>There are different classes of HEPA filters ranked based on how many particles they remove.</p>

<p>For example, HP13 requires it to remove an average of 99.95 per cent of particles and at least 99.75 per cent.</p>

<p>HEPA filtration works mechanically rather than using negative ions.</p>

<p>This means a HEPA filter is often better for people with conditions like asthma. </p>

<p>At the announcement of the final design, LG president of home appliances, Dan Song, said there were clear benefits to a reusable electronic mask. </p>

<p>'The PuriCare Wearable Air Purifier is an exciting addition to our growing line-up of products designed to deliver meaningful health and hygiene benefits,' he said.</p>

<p>'At a time when consumers are seeking ways to make life safer and more convenient, it's important that we're able to offer solutions that add measurable value.'</p>

<p>LG has used 'extensive facial shape analysis' to create the ergonomically designed mask to ensure it fits 'snugly on the user's face'.</p>

<p>This is required in order to minimise air leakage around the nose and chin, which could result in heavily polluted air - or possibly infected droplets - getting in.  </p>

<p>The UV-LED light-equipped case is an important part of the design, as germs such as coronavirus can live on surfaces for varying amounts of time - which is why it is important to regularly wash or replace face masks. </p>

<p>According to LG, the case for this mask cleans away and kills harmful germs while the device is charging.</p>

<p>'Because every component - from the filters to the ear straps – is replaceable and recyclable, it’s an environmentally responsible solution as well,' the firm said. </p>

<p>The Korean tech giant is to officially reveal the mask during the IFA technology trade show in Berlin next week.  </p>
