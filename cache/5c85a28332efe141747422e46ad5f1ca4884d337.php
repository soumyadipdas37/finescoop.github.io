<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One in four pubs, restaurants, bars and clubs – almost 30,000 – have closed amid the curse of coronavirus and a 'job loss tsunami'.</p>

<p>The figure represents the number of outlets that have not re-opened since pulling down the shutters in March.</p>

<p>Industry leaders say that many, if not all, are gone for good with the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.</p>

<p>And the situation is deteriorating following the introduction of the 10pm curfew, which critics have described as 'random' and 'nuts' with no scientific justification.</p>

<p>In July, the Prince William pub in Lancashire, whose last manager was Dave Roy (pictured), was boarded up and put up for sale by Robinsons Brewery</p>

<p>Alarmingly, the policy appears likely to drive up infection rates with huge numbers gathering on streets and public transport at the new closing time.</p>

<p>An industry survey found extreme pessimism among pubs and restaurants with another one in four – on top of those that have already gone – fearing going bust before Christmas.</p>

<p>Greene King, which runs 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels, has seen a sharp fall in takings as a result of the curfew. </p>

<p>A spokesman said: 'The measures are already having a significant cumulative negative impact. We are already seeing lots of examples of people leaving our pubs to buy alcohol in shops to drink elsewhere in unregulated environments.'</p>

<p>Mark Davies, the boss of Hawthorn Leisure, which runs 720 community pubs, said: 'I don't think there is any logic or justifiable rationale for the curfew. There is certainly no scientific evidence or statistics that back up the decision.</p>

<p>'Trade is down significantly – we are talking way over 50 per cent in many locations. </p>

<p>Mr Roy is now managing another country pub in Lancashire, the Farmers Arms in Heskin</p>

<p>'It is inevitable over the next few weeks there will be pub closures. It is going to have a devastating impact and we will see a tsunami of job losses. It is totally unnecessary.'</p>

<p>The closures leave a black hole at the heart of communities, town and city centres across the UK.</p>

<p>The Prince William pub in the Lancashire village of Dalton was boarded up at the start of July and put up for sale by Robinsons Brewery. </p>

<p>The last manager of the pub – which lies between Skelmersdale and Wigan – was Dave Roy. </p>

<p>Yesterday he said: 'It was a lovely pub, especially in the summer.</p>

<p>'If they had hung on until pubs were allowed to reopen I think I could have turned it around.' </p>

<p>Mr Roy is now managing another country pub in Lancashire, the Farmers Arms in Heskin.</p>

<p>The total number of licensed pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, nightclubs, hotels that are trading is down from 115,108 to 86,212 – a fall of 28,896, according to research from market analysts CGA and AlixPartners.</p>

<p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced new support for struggling businesses, designed to support wages and limit job losses. </p>

<p>However the trade body UKHospitality has warned that this is not enough, with chief executive Kate Nicholls, saying the introduction of the 10pm curfew 'was a significant hammer blow that will inevitably depress trading'.</p>

<p>Hundreds of restaurant owners and brewers have urged Boris Johnson to ditch the 10pm curfew so the hospitality sector can survive the 'bleakest of winters'.</p>

<p>Burger King, JD Wetherspoon, Greene King and Carlsberg said hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost without support for the industry. </p>

<p>The food and drink giants called on the Government to review the latest restrictions every three weeks – and remove them if they are not impacting the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>A letter to the Prime Minister, coordinated by hospitality organisations, warned: 'Across the country, the 10pm curfew has removed key trading hours for all of us vital to our survival, removing whole shifts from food-led businesses. </p>

<p>'Quite simply, though, we need additional and urgent support in order to survive this bleakest of winters.'</p>

<p>And a letter from Richard Bailey, chairman of the Independent Family Brewers of Britain – which represents 3,000 pubs – said they were being made scapegoats and slammed the 'illogical' new restrictions.</p>

<p>The outbursts came as a cross-party group of 25 MPs yesterday asked Business Secretary Alok Sharma to publish the scientific evidence behind the 10pm curfew.</p>
