<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Engagement photoshoots, maternity photoshoots, and newborn photoshoots have all been done before, but an Oklahoma may be starting a new trend with their divorce photoshoot.</p>

<p>When Shalena Casanova and her ex-husband split, they celebrated the conscious uncoupling with some funny professional picture.</p>

<p>In the images, the couple stage a mock divorce proposal, and also wear smiles on their faces as they pretend to put their old wedding gown and tux for sale.</p>

<p>They don't! When Shalena Casanova and her ex-husband split, they celebrated the conscious uncoupling with a divorce photoshoot</p>

<p>Shalena and her ex clearly have a good sense of humor about the unfortunate situation, and seem to be splitting up on relatively good terms.</p>

<p>In one photo that she posted on Facebook, the redhead is down on one knee with a chalkboard sign reading, 'Will you divorce me?'</p>

<p>Her ex holds a matching sign with an enthusiastic 'yes!'</p>

<p>In another picture, Shalena holds up her bridal gown, while her ex — sporting a T-shirt and baseball cap, has a tuxedo jacket slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>'For sale,' reads their sign. 'Tux &amp; wedding dress. Worn by mistake.'  </p>

<p>Viral: In the Facebook caption, which Shalena said: 'We are by no means condoning divorce; however, we are not ashamed to celebrate the end of our marriage'</p>

<p>The third image shows them holding signs that say 'I want a divorce now' and 'I wanted a divorce yesterday.'</p>

<p>In the Facebook caption, which Shalena has now set to private, she wrote called it 'the "oh well so shameful" deed.'</p>

<p>'We are by no means condoning divorce; however, we are not ashamed to celebrate the end of our marriage,' she said, according to Fox 23.  </p>

<p>'We choose to co-parent successfully. We choose to separate FOR the kids and not believe the lie that staying together for the sake of the kids is what is best for them.</p>

<p>'We love fully when we are our best selves,' she said.</p>

<p>The ex-couple's photoshoot is not the first to celebrate a divorce, though it is unique in that it stars both the ex-husband and wife.</p>

<p>Divorce photoshoots have shown some popularity for newly-single women, who use them to celebrate being rid of an ex.</p>

<p>Some photograph themselves destroying old photos, while a few go so far as to set their bridal gowns on fire. </p>
