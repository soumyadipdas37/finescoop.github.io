<p>Getting grilled: Stassie Schroeder sat down for her first interview since her firing on Thursday for the Tamron Hall Show, where the host grilled her past behaviors, even calling her ignorant; pictured November 11, 2019 in NYC</p>

<p>Tamron questioned her judgment on making jokes about the black community as well as about Jewish people, after she once called an outfit 'Nazi chic.'</p>

<p>The daytime host candidly said: 'Going back to your history, being in a big city like New Orleans and Los Angeles, I am shocked – and don't take this as an insult – at your level of ignorance as it relates to race and what it means to say Nazi chic to Jewish people and what it could have done to Faith's life."</p>

<p>Schroeder was fired from Vanderpump Rules along with Kristen Doute, when it was revealed that they filed a false police report against former VR co-star Faith Stowers, the only Black woman to appear on the hit reality show.</p>

<p>Schroeder and Doute told police that Stowers fit the description of a Black woman who was robbing men in Los Angeles, and Schroeder and Doute even admitted to calling the cops on Stowers.</p>

<p>Schroeder had started working at Lisa Vanderpump's restaurants Sur and Blanca Villa in 2010, and she has been on Vanderpump Rules since it debuted in 2013.</p>
