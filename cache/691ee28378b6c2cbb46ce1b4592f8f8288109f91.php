<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Olympic medallist Amy Tinkler has accused senior British Gymnastics coach Colin Still of using the term 'fat dwarf' in a discussion about her physique.</p>

<p>In the latest set of allegations against the organisation, Tinkler, 20, has detailed how she was reduced to tears as a 17-year-old in 2017 after being copied into an email conversation about her physical conditioning.</p>

<p>As part of an ongoing public row between Tinkler and the governing body, who have come under fire from multiple gymnasts over welfare issues in recent months, the Rio 2016 bronze medallist posted screengrabs of correspondence between Still and her nutritionist.</p>

<p>Olympic medallist Amy Tinkler is currently embroiled in a public row with British Gymnastics</p>

<p>In one email Still misunderstands data about Tinkler's height and weight, and writes 'she already looks a little heavy'. When told he had misinterpreted the results, he responded: 'It's great when someone turns the light on! I will get back to my skiing knowing that Amy is not turning into a fat dwarf!!'</p>

<p>Tinkler, who has vowed to lift the lid on the experiences that led her to quit the sport this year, wrote in a statement on Wednesday: 'I felt sick when I read it and started crying.</p>

<p>'My weight has been a sensitive issue with me since I was 13 years old, with the national coaches always mentioning it as a problem. It really hurt. Why would he say that?</p>

<p>'It was the second email that really made me cry. Colin called me a "fat dwarf". I just sat there crying. I asked mam if I looked fat. So many thoughts went through my mind. He's the national coach but why would he say that? What have I done for him to be that mean to me?' </p>

<p>Tinkler has accused Colin Still of using the term 'fat dwarf' in a discussion about her physique</p>

<p>British Gymnastics confirmed to Sportsmail that Still remains a coach at the organisation. While they did not include a response from Still to the allegations, they have launched an investigation.</p>

<p>In a statement they said: 'This is extremely worrying. A coach should not be speaking in this way about a gymnast. We have contacted Amy Tinkler to ask for the original emails from 2017 and other relevant information to aid that investigation.</p>

<p>'We have checked all available records and cannot find reference that we have previously had a complaint about these comments.' </p>

<p>Tinkler has previously slammed the governing body over their handling and dismissal of a complaint made against coach Amanda Reddin, who has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Tinkler admitted she retired from gymnastics in January because of her negative experiences </p>
