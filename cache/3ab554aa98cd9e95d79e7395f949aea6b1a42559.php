<p>Maya also recently revealed that she is unfazed by ex Stormzy rapping about their relationship in his songs.</p>

<p>The Vossi Bop hitmaker, 27, referred their romance in his 2019 song Lessons, but Maya insisted that it comes with the territory if you date a musician.  </p>

<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A with singer Madison Beer as quoted by The Sun, Maya said: 'I feel that going out with an artist, you kind of sign an invisible contract where it's like, 'This is this, it's everybody's business'. </p>

<p>Stormzy's song, which featured on his Heavy Is The Head album, directly name-check's Maya and their split.  </p>

<p>He raps: 'Fast forward now, my nephew's still asking for his Auntie Maya, guess this is the karma for what I done to Maya. </p>

<p>'I just stood and let it burn, I couldn't down the fire. Lord, I pray you make it easy, that's my one desire.'  </p>
