<p>There were fears for the life of the 'emaciated and dehydrated' newborn kittens at the White Lion Park in the Russian city of Vladivostok.</p>

<p>'What the mother lion is doing is not quite normal,' said park director Viktor Agafonov.</p>

<p>'She is biting them…</p>

<p>'One cub seems even to have a little wound.</p>

<p>Sirona the lioness is a first-time mother and described as 'very introverted, reserved and secretive' before keepers saw she was failing to care properly for her infants.</p>

<p>There were no such problems with the park's faithful German Shepherd, which had recently given birth to one puppy.</p>

<p>'It is interesting that this dog doesn't like cats, yet she decided to accept the little African lions into her family,' said Agafonov.</p>

<p>'She has a puppy, smaller than lion cubs.</p>

<p>'But the dog has enough milk because in the past she has fed eight puppies.'</p>

<p>He praised the eight-year-old foster mum for taking on the cubs.</p>

<p>'This dog helped us a lot, obviously, and she will help the cubs to survive because their mum, Sirona, didn't come close to them.</p>

<p>'The male cub is already sucking milk carefully. </p>

<p>'And the girl cub is taking it too.'</p>

<p>He said it was an 'unusual case when a representative of one animal species fosters cubs of another, let alone wild….</p>

<p>'The dog's milk is very appropriate for the cubs, it has all necessary nutrients for normal development.'</p>
