<p>A retired vicar has been cleared of sexually assaulting a woman curate after being accused of leaping at her ‘like a rabbit out of a rabbit hole’.</p>

<p>Rev Geraint Hughes, 85, pictured, allegedly told her ‘I really miss having cuddles’ after being recently widowed.</p>

<p>The woman claimed she tried to fend off the clergyman by saying ‘Let us pray’ when he kissed her three times.</p>

<p>She was visiting his home last year to discuss Sunday services when he wrapped his arms around her, it was alleged.</p>

<p>Hughes, the former Dean of Brecon Cathedral in South Wales, admitted hugging the married curate and kissing her once. </p>

<p>But he said it was all a misunderstanding and he ‘didn’t cross the line’.</p>

<p>A jury at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court took less than 30 minutes to find him not guilty of sexual assault.</p>
