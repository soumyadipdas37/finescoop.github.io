<p>Up and about: Shirley Ballas was making the most of being on two feet again as she stepped out with mum Audrey and boyfriend Danny Taylor on Saturday to celebrate her 60th birthday</p>

<p>Shirley paired her jeans with a white T-shirt and a pretty pink and white cardigan, while she stored her essentials in a peach quilted handbag.</p>

<p>The dancer's brunette tresses were perfectly blow-dried for the occasion, while she upped the glam with a sleek palette of make-up.</p>

<p>Shirley looked in great spirits as she posed with her beau, 47, and her beloved mum as she marked her big day.</p>

<p>Shirley announced in July that she had a 'clean break' on her right foot, but assured Strictly fans she'll be fine to appear on the show when it returns.</p>

<p>Walking with the help of crutches and a medical boot, the choreographer had expressed her gratitude towards the NHS.</p>

<p>In a clip filmed by Danny, the media personality said: 'Hi everybody, I've just finished at A&amp;E after a clean break, on my right ankle.</p>

<p>'We're not using Plaster of Paris anymore, using a boot, so I'm learning to walk on these crutches - crutches, right foot, close, a bit like the Waltz. Anyway, I'm going to be absolutely fine for Strictly.'</p>

<p>The TV star reiterated her comments in the post's caption, where she also thanked her actor beau for lending a helping hand after she sustained her injury. </p>

<p>Soldiering on: Last month, a source close to Shirley told The Mirror : 'She'll definitely be back on Strictly. No reason for her not to be as she doesn't need to dance to be on the panel'</p>

<p>Shirley penned: 'So a clean break. Six weeks to heal. Thank you to NHS and all staff who took care of me.'</p>

<p>Last month, a source close to Shirley told The Mirror: 'She'll definitely be back on Strictly. No reason for her not to be as she doesn't need to dance to be on the panel but she will be out of the plaster by then. </p>

<p>'The boot she had wasn't secure enough, so she has been put in plaster to make sure the bones heal correctly.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the full line-up for this year's Strictly was announced this week, with the new shorter series kicking off in October.</p>

<p>Viewers will see the likes of EastEnders' Maisie Smith, actress Caroline Quentin, retired American football player Jason Bell, The Wanted's Max George and GMB's Ranvir Singh all battling it out for the Glitterball trophy. </p>

<p>Ouch! The former dancer has told pals she will be taking part in the show when it returns this autumn, amid doubts when she revealed she'd broken her ankle last month</p>
