<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United have become favourites to land Real Madrid's Sergio Reguilon after putting an offer on the table for the highly sought after 23-year-old.</p>

<p>Reguilon is likely to leave the Santiago Bernabeu this summer as Ferland Mendy and Marcelo have established themselves as Zinedine Zidane's first choice defenders.</p>

<p>Having played a crucial role on loan at Sevilla for the past campaign - helping them achieve a fourth-place finish in the league and qualify for the Champions League - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hopes Regilon will strengthen United's left-back position.</p>

<p> Manchester United have become the favourites to land Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguilon</p>

<p>Last season United's left-back position was occupied by Luke Shaw - who was withdrawn from their Europa League campaign due to an ankle injury - and 20-year-old academy product, Brandon Williams.</p>

<p>Despite having his heart set on returning to Real Madrid, Zidane has added Reguilon to his list of player he is hoping to sell, to raise £180million in funds this summer to help deal with the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>The Spain Under-21 international is likely to cost United around £25m with Real Madrid adding an option to buy-back clause in the contract. </p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is looking to add strength to Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams' position</p>

<p>The 23-year-old had impressed during a season-long loan with LaLiga side Sevilla last season</p>

<p>Having been forced out the door, Reguilon has been tempted by the Red Devils offer as he has been assured of a starting place at Old Trafford - according to AS. </p>

<p>Reguilon will also have the opportunity to prove himself on the European stage as United have confirmed their place in the Champions League.</p>

<p>Although Sevilla have been hopeful of keeping Reguilon for another season, United hold the upper hand in negotiations as they are able to offer him a long-term deal.</p>

<p>Having already bought Oscar Rodriguez from Madrid this summer, Sevilla would be looking for another loan agreement without an option to buy.</p>
