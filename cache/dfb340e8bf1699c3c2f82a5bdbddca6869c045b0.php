<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A great-grandmother who developed an overwhelming urge to breastfeed ahead of her eightieth birthday has revealed the mysterious symptom was a sign that she had cancer.  </p>

<p>Barbara Harvey, 85, who lives in Plymouth, Devon, spent a year forced to secretly 'tweak' her 'tingly' left nipple while out in public to relieve the tingling and itchy sensation she was suffering from.     </p>

<p>After several 'frustrating' trips to her GP revealing her baffling symptoms, including an urge to breastfeed, doctors declared she was lump-free and that nothing was wrong.</p>

<p>It was only when the retired business owner who hasn't breast-fed since 1966, visited a locum doctor that she was referred to hospital for a mammogram. </p>

<p>Barbara Harvey, 85, (pictured) who lives in Plymouth, Devon, revealed she was diagnosed with breast cancer after experiencing a bizarre desire to breastfeed ahead of her eightieth birthday</p>

<p>Barbara was so stunned she broke down in tears when doctors diagnosed her with breast cancer - bizarrely in her right breast rather than her itchy left one.</p>

<p>She underwent surgery in April 2015 to remove the tumour and a lymph node - weeks before her 80th birthday.</p>

<p>Now aged 85 and cancer-free, Barbara is sharing her experience to make other women aware of symptoms to look out for.</p>

<p>Barbara said: 'All the health campaigns talk are about searching for any lumps or other changes, but they never mention the unusual symptoms I had at nearly 80 years old.</p>

<p>'Over the course of a year I experienced an itchy tingling feeling in my nipple that soon spread to the whole of the breast.</p>

<p>'I found without consciously being aware of it I was tweaking my nipple, I wanted to squeeze it as it felt as though I'd got milk in there, and sometimes a clear liquid would come out.</p>

<p>'As time went on the irritation was driving me mad, it felt like I wanted to feed a baby from my left breast. </p>

<p>'When you are breastfeeding a baby you do get these feelings in there.</p>

<p>Barbara admits she thought her initial symptoms were related to her hormones and didn't expect to have cancer. Pictured: Barbara in the 1970s, in her 40s</p>

<p>'The symptoms first started in 2014, at the time I just thought "Oh it's something to do with my hormones". I never dreamt it was going to end up being cancer.</p>

<p>'When the consultant sat me down and gave me the news I was a bit numb, I was in total shock.</p>

<p>'I left his office, got in my car, drove to my son's, walked through the door and burst into tears.'</p>

<p>The first symptom of breast cancer most people notice is a lump in their breast or some thickening.</p>

<p>Barbara who last breastfed her youngest child 54 years ago in 1966, said she went to the doctors a number of times desperate to get to the bottom of what was causing the bizarre sensation.</p>

<p>Despite being declared lump-free several times, Barbara was unconvinced that all was well.</p>

<p>The final straw came when she was unable to enjoy her regular knitting group meet-ups after being plagued by itchiness she was desperate to relieve.</p>

<p>Barbara said: 'I'm a very sociable person and I run knitting groups, and have done for ten years.</p>

<p>'What worried me was the fact that I suddenly realised I was sitting there with other people and tweaking my left nipple because it was irritating me.</p>

<p>'It was very embarrassing trying to relieve that itch in public, I managed to keep it under wraps so nobody commented on it, but it was very frustrating.'</p>

<p>Fed up of being fobbed off, Barbara returned to her GP and was relieved when a locum doctor suggested a referral to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where she underwent a mammogram.</p>

<p>Barbara said: 'I'd been going backwards and forwards to the doctor because it felt like I wanted to feed a baby from my left breast.</p>

<p>'The doctor would examine me and say there were no lumps, it was frustrating being told there was nothing wrong.</p>

<p>'A locum lady took a look and said although I had no lumps it was worth investigating and that she would request I have a mammogram.</p>

<p>Barbara (pictured) was diagnosed with cancer in her right breast after a hospital mammogram, despite her symptoms being in her left breast </p>

<p>'I went along to the hospital where they did the mammogram and I was told I had cancer.</p>

<p>'The specialist described it as being shaped like a fried egg - the 'yolk' being the cancer and the 'white' being the oestrogen that the cancer feeds on.</p>

<p>'He took a biopsy and very soon after that I was told I had to go in and have it taken out.</p>

<p>'I found this fascinating, all the feeling was in my left breast but the cancer was in the right breast.'</p>

<p>Barbara underwent the operation to remove the tumour and a lymph node, which came back clear showing that the cancer hadn't spread elsewhere.</p>

<p>The grandmother-of-seven now has hormone therapy, annual mammograms and avoids products containing oestrogen.</p>

<p>Barbara said: 'During the operation they took away the cancer and one of the lymph nodes.</p>

<p>Barbara (pictured) who is now on tablets to prevent her body from producing oestrogen, said she's always been conscious of her breasts</p>

<p>'That was clear, which was great news, and I was discharged the same day. After the op the tingling sensation disappeared.</p>

<p>'I'm now on tablets that stop my body producing oestrogen and I also carefully avoid anything with oestrogen in it, such as soya.'</p>

<p>Barbara who breastfed all four of her children, said she was always aware of her 'big' boobs, but never suspected that it would be such a serious diagnosis.</p>

<p>Barbara said: 'I was always aware of my breasts because they were very big, I didn't struggle feeding any of my four children.</p>

<p>'I'm 85, so my boobs are almost down to my knees now, but there was a time when I was only 8st something but I was a 34HH.</p>

<p>'I've always been conscious of my boobs but I never gave it a thought that it could be cancer.'</p>

<p>Barbara (pictured) revealed she's sharing her story because it's important not to just look out for lumps and dents as signs of cancer </p>

<p>Barbara is now sharing her experience so women know to look out for other less well-known symptoms, as well as checking for lumps.</p>

<p>Barbara said: 'When I first experienced the symptoms I had I put it down to the fact that my breasts were so big, it wasn't something I thought I could take a trip to the GP about.</p>

<p>'I'm sharing my story so people know that this can be a symptom of breast cancer and not to just look out for lumps and dents.</p>

<p>'It is vitally important that women of all ages, not just the young but the elderly too, should seek medical advice as soon as they experience any changes - especially once regular breast cancer screening stops after a certain age.</p>

<p>'If you experience any changes at all, just go to the doctor.</p>

<p>'It's better to go to the doctors, have it investigated and be told it's nothing than to leave it.</p>

<p>'Fortunately I did recover from it, I feel lucky the operation got rid of it and the odd sensation stopped.' </p>
