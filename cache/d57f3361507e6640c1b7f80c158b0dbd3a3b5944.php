<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If fans expect the handball furore stirring up the Premier League to calm down, then —judging by La Liga — they should think again.</p>

<p>The new rules in force this season in England were introduced in Spain at the start of last season and it has been chaos ever since. </p>

<p>By March last season in La Liga, more penalties had been awarded for handball than in the entire previous campaign.</p>

<p>Premier League fans in England are becoming more annoyed about the new handball rule</p>

<p>But the situation is the same in Spain with Real Betis' Marc Bartra (above) a similar victim</p>

<p>The increase meant that the head of the referees’ technical committee, Carlos Velasco Carballo, had to try to clarify things. </p>

<p>But his comments underlined the confusion for referees, fans and players.</p>

<p>‘The rules of the game say it’s a penalty if the hand is at shoulder height,’ said Carballo. ‘And that it’s not a penalty if the arms are tight down by the sides of the body. And that it is also not a penalty if the hands are in a natural position. </p>

<p>In LaLiga last term, more penalties were awarded for handball than in the previous season</p>

<p>‘But from 10 degrees (away from body) to 85 degrees (still not at shoulder height), what do we mean by natural position?’</p>

<p>The bad news is there has been no calming down of the handball controversy in Spain so far this season. </p>

<p>On Saturday, Betis defender Marc Bartra was adjudged to have handled, despite Real Madrid striker Borja Mayoral appearing to push him into the ball.</p>

<p>Jules Kounde expressed his frustration last season, saying players 'can't play using their hands'</p>

<p>Betis coach Manuel Pellegrini, the former Manchester City and West Ham boss, complained of having to beat ‘Real Madrid and VAR’ and could be banned for up to four games.</p>

<p>Last season, Sevilla defender Jules Kounde summed up defenders’ concerns when he said: ‘It’s difficult for defenders because we can’t play without using our arms.’</p>

<p>Just as in England, games are still being stopped to rule over incidents that have gone almost unnoticed in real time.</p>
