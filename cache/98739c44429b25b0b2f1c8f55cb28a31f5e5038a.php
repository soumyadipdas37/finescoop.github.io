<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Police solved the murder of a transsexual prostitute who was chopped up after being stabbed in Russia by tracing the serial number of her breast implants to an Irish company.</p>

<p>The limbless torso of a woman was found by a 17-year-old holiday maker as he swam in the River Mga, in the Leningrad region in June.</p>

<p>The police's forensic team quickly established that these were implants and that they had the serial number 3253426 TSX 359.</p>

<p>This led them to being traced to the Dublin-based company Allergan. The company is the maker of Botox, but it also manufactures products for medical aesthetics.</p>

<p>The discovery meant that the victim was identified as Dzamshud Khatamzhonov, 23, also known as Tamara, and originally from Uzbekistan, after a Russian hospital was identified as having done the surgery implant.</p>
