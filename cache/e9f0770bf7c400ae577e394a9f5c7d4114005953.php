<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An 84-year-old man died at the end of January from Covid-19 - making him the UK's first coronavirus victim, it was reported last night. </p>

<p>Peter Attwood, whose death a coroner has partly attributed to Covid-19, died on January 30 – more than a month before what was previously thought to be the country’s first virus death on March 2. </p>

<p>Post-mortem tests on Mr Attwood detected coronavirus in his lung tissue, leading the Kent coroner to record his cause of death as 'Covid-19 infection and bronchopneumonia'.</p>

<p>Mr Attwood's daughter Jane Buckland, 46, told the Sun her dad, from Chatham, Kent, was admitted to hospital on January 7 with a bad cough.</p>

<p>The Department of Health announced the significant hike in deaths but said it did not include Northern Ireland which is yet to report its figures</p>

<p>Last Thursday she received an email from Kent coroner Bina Patel saying coronavirus had been found in his lung tissue during the post mortem. </p>

<p>She said: 'The doctors did every test under the sun but couldn't figure out what was wrong with him.</p>

<p>'His blood tests showed a high level of infection but they had no idea what it was.</p>

<p>'He died on January 30 and the provisional death certificate said it was heart failure and pneumonia.</p>

<p>'The virus was obviously running rampant in this country back in December or maybe even earlier.</p>

<p>'China was covering it up from the beginning.</p>

<p>'It's no wonder so many people in this country ended up dying from it. How many lives could have been saved if we'd known what was really going on?</p>

<p>'My dad was elderly and had an underlying heart condition, so he would have been shielding.'</p>

<p>University of East Anglia Professor of Medicine Paul Hunter said of Peter's case: 'This is a remarkable development because it shows there was some virus transmission in the UK before anyone realised.'</p>

<p>A Government spokesman said: 'Every death is a tragedy. There is no evidence that there was sustained transmission within the community in January 2020.</p>

<p>'We acted swiftly to curb coronavirus and at all times we have been guided by the best available evidence to deliver a strategy designed to protect the NHS and save lives.'  </p>
