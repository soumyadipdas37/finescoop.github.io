<p>'We believed it was all above board': Luke and Jasmin first tried to reason with fans on Tuesday, by vehemently denying plagiarising and insisting they did not knowingly break the rules</p>

<p>Luke and Jasmin first tried to reason with fans on Tuesday, by vehemently denying plagiarising their winning children's bedroom and insisting they did not knowingly break the rules.  </p>

<p>The couple were accused by judge Shaynna Blaze of creating a 'carbon copy' of another design they were using as 'inspiration'.  </p>

<p>'All week we were showing our mood board which featured the room from the The Designory (and other images). We were open about using it and believed it was all above board,' they explained.</p>

<p>Busted: On Tuesday's episode, Luke and Jasmin were accused of cheating on their winning kids' room by judge Shaynna Blaze</p>

<p>'Inspiration is one thing, completely taking someone's idea and making it your own is another,' Block judge Shaynna Blaze (pictured) told Luke and Jasmin</p>

<p>Speaking out: In a lengthy post to Instagram, the interior design guru defended her remarks about the couple's room being plagiarised, but did acknowledge the possibility they had copied their room without even realising it</p>

<p>Shaynna said she had no choice but to 'have a difficult conversation' with Luke and Jasmin after noticing the 'many similarities' between their renovation and the Barefoot Escapes holiday home in Byron Bay designed by The Designory agency. </p>

<p>She shared her own statement to Instagram on Tuesday in which she urged viewers to stop trolling the couple, and Jasmin in particular. </p>

<p>While the interior design guru defended her remarks about the couple's room being plagiarised, she did acknowledge the possibility they had copied their room without even realising it.</p>

<p>'Please don't direct any negativity towards Jasmin on social media, and instead let's all take a look at our own appreciation of design and other designers, and our personal understanding of the difference between imitation and plagiarism,' she concluded.</p>

<p>Support: Judge Shaynna also urged viewers to stop trolling the couple, and Jasmin in particular, hours after Tuesday night's episode </p>

<p>Fellow contestants Daniel and Jade enlisted furniture designer Christian Cole to create a bespoke kitchen island bench for them, in which they claim Luke and Jasmin later copied the design.</p>

<p>Foreman Keith Schleiger pointed out the similarities between the two teams' island benches, and made no secret of the fact Luke and Jasmin had tried to recreate Daniel and Jade's one-of-a-kind design.</p>

<p>Stay tuned! The Block continues on Sunday from 7pm on Channel Nine</p>
