<p>If you've got it! Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, 30, (pictured) her flat, toned tummy and curvaceous derriere in a tiny string bikini in a pink tie-dye bodysuit on Instagram on Tuesday</p>

<p>She had her long blonde tresses plaited behind her hair, while she accessorised her look with oversized designer sunglasses. </p>

<p>It certainly didn't take the Australian singer long to bounce back to her pre-baby body, after welcoming her first child earlier this year.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Iggy didn't have an inch to pinch as she danced and gyrated around in the skimpy swimwear in one social media video. </p>

<p>She's back! It certainly didn't take the Australian singer long to bounce back to her pre-baby body, after welcoming her first child earlier this year </p>

<p>Iggy recently denied that her incredible post-baby body was the result of plastic surgery. </p>

<p>She told a fan on Twitter that her toned physique was down to a healthy diet and the fact that she was already in great shape before falling pregnant.  </p>

<p>And while that may well be true, it doesn't mean that Iggy has never gone under the knife before.</p>

<p>Body: The blonde bombshell has denied having butt implants, but there has been speculation that she may have undergone a Brazilian butt lift </p>

<p>She has openly admitted to undergoing some procedures, including rhinoplasty and a breast augmentation.</p>

<p>The blonde bombshell has denied having butt implants, but there has been speculation that she may have undergone a Brazilian butt lift.</p>

<p>Plastic surgeon to the stars, Michael Salzhauer (aka Dr. Miami), who has not operated on the rapper, told Daily Mail Australia last year that Iggy's 'shape' is a dead giveaway.  </p>

<p>'Her shape and personal history makes me think she has,' he said, adding that telltale signs of a Brazilian butt lift include: 'A very small waist and big buttocks.' </p>

<p>A Brazilian butt lift is a form of buttock augmentation, which enhances the size and shape of a patient's bottom using a fat transfer from other areas of the body. </p>

<p>Perfection: Back in June, the rapper (pictured) didn't have an inch to pinch as she danced and gyrated around in the skimpy swimwear </p>
