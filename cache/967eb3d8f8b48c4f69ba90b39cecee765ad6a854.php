<p>What a girl! Victoria Beckham has gushed that her daughter Harper, nine, loves to spoil her after a busy day at work by running her a relaxing salt bath</p>

<p>She explained: 'Harper often makes an Epsom bath soak for me when I get home from work.'</p>

<p>'She's also into beauty treatments which is really sweet. Sometimes we make our own face masks with a little manuka honey and organic oats.' </p>

<p>The former Spice Girls singer - who also has three sons with husband David Beckham - thinks it is a real 'luxury' if her evening allows her time not only for a pampering session but also to fit in reading a chapter from a book.</p>

<p>She said: 'My Cell Rejuvenating Power Serum and Priming Moisturizer are my nightly staples to repair my skin while I sleep. The serum changed my skin and is the power player in my regime.</p>

<p>Speaking to Stella magazine, Victoria also opened up on her exercise routine, admitting: 'I work out every day - I see it like brushing your teeth, it's just something you do. I normally do an uphill walk on the treadmill, followed by a Tracy Anderson routine.'  </p>
