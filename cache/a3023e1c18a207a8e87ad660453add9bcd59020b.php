<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kim Kardashian announced on Wednesday that she is ending her popular reality show after 14 years on air. </p>

<p>And while Keeping Up With The Kardashians will air its final season next year, Australians will still be able to watch the series after it ends on the E! network.</p>

<p>Every season of KUWTK is currently available to watch in Australia on the reality TV streaming service Hayu.</p>

<p>Gone but not forgotten! Australians will still be able to watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the foreseeable future despite the series getting the axe</p>

<p>Hayu also gets the latest episodes the same day as the US, so there's only a few hours difference between the episode airing in America on E! to it being available to watch on Hayu. </p>

<p>E! is under the NBCUniversal umbrella along with Bravo and the Oxygen network, and Hayu has the rights to NBCUniversal content in Australia.</p>

<p>Keeping Up With The Kardashians will continue to be available to Australians via Hayu for the foreseeable future, which will more than likely include the show's final season next year.</p>

<p>Now streaming! Every season of KUWTK is currently available to watch in Australia on the reality TV streaming service Hayu</p>

<p>The entire series and its spin-offs will also remain on Hayu for as long as the streaming service holds the rights to NBCUniversal content. </p>

<p>In addition to hosting KUWTK, Hayu is also home to various Kardashian spin-offs, including Life of Kylie, I Am Cait, Rob &amp; Chyna, Flip It Like Disick, Kim Kardashian West: The Justice Project, and more.</p>

<p>And with episodes being available on Hayu the same day that they air in the US, Australians will be able to watch the KUWTK series finale on the same day as Americans do when it airs next year.</p>

<p>Same day: Hayu also gets the latest episodes the same day as the US, so there's only a few hours difference between the episode airing in America on E! to it being available to watch on Hayu</p>
