<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham will place Gareth Bale on an intensive training programme to get him fully firing for his sensational return to English football.</p>

<p>Bale is still suffering from the effects of a minor knee problem he picked up on international duty with Wales earlier this month and will need time to get himself fit.</p>

<p>The Real Madrid star will also need to build up his general match fitness and sharpness, having played just 215 minutes of football for club and country since February.</p>

<p>Tottenham are set to place Gareth Bale on an intensive training programme once he returns</p>

<p>Spurs will prepare a meticulous schedule to get him 100 per cent fit as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Club medics estimate it will take Bale up to four weeks to get back into tip-top shape.</p>

<p>Once Bale has fully recovered from his knee niggle, it remains to be seen whether Mourinho will select the 31-year-old as he builds up his fitness.</p>

<p>Spurs have a gruelling fixture schedule over the coming weeks and Mourinho will need to lean heavily on his squad.</p>

<p>Medics believe it will take Bale up to four weeks to be in top shape for Jose Mourinho's side</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Bale had sealed a season-long loan return. In fact, it is understood Daniel Levy had the deal virtually wrapped up on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Bale will have medical tests in Madrid on Friday before flying to London in the next 24 hours to ratify the move. A few minor formalities were completed on Thursday and all that is left is for Bale to arrive and sign.</p>

<p>Mourinho refused to be drawn into public comment on the Bale deal after Thursday night's Europa League victory against Lokomotiv Plovdiv in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>‘I can’t comment,’ he said. ‘I don’t comment on something that I don’t know. For me, at this moment, until Gareth Bale is a Tottenham player I still think and respect the fact that he is a Real Madrid player. I am not going to comment on a Real Madrid player.’</p>

<p>Tottenham have also sealed their £27million swoop for left back Sergio Reguilon from Real Madrid. He completed his medical on Thursday, which could open the door for Ryan Sessegnon to leave on loan. </p>

<p>Defender Sergio Reguilon is also set to make the move from Real Madrid to Tottenham</p>

<p>Tottenham have been informed that Southampton striker Danny Ings isn't for sale at any price</p>

<p>But the club have been told Danny Ings is not for sale at any price after making an enquiry for the Southampton striker.</p>

<p>Spurs remain in the market for a striker to ease the burden on Harry Kane. They contacted Southampton on Wednesday to ask whether they are open to offers for Ings, one of the top options on Mourinho’s long list of targets, but the south coast club have no interest in selling</p>

<p>and want to tie him down on a new contract, as revealed by Sportsmail last month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Torino want £45m for striker Andrea Belotti.</p>

<p>But Spurs value the Italian at around £36m and would prefer to discuss a deal that involves spreading out the cost.</p>
