<p>Sounding different: South African born Australian actress Tammin Sursok's thick American accent was hard to ignore as she appeared on Channel Seven's The Morning Show in Sydney via a live link from her home in the United States</p>

<p>The former Sydneysider spoke about dropping her eldest daughter Phoenix, 6, back to school with her teachers, while admitting that homeschooling curing the pandemic had been tough.</p>

<p>'I don't know what's happening in Australia, but I would say most of the schools are shut down [in America], so it's really up to us to figure out how to teach our kids.</p>

<p>'The difference is when your kids are at school, they're much more willing to listen to their teachers.</p>

<p>'But when it's their parents, they really don't want to do that when they're in their space at home. They know [home] is for playing, having fun, eating and swimming.'  </p>

<p>The former Home and Away's star accent has regularly been criticised over the years, and just last year the star was forced to defend herself.</p>

<p>In response to a follower who pointed out how 'goes in and out' of different accents, Tammin offered an explanation for her distinctive speech.</p>

<p>Tammin, who was born in South Africa, lived in Sydney for 15 years before relocating permanently to Los Angeles well over a decade ago.</p>

<p>She explained that her changing accent is simply down to having lived in various parts of the world for significant periods of time.</p>

<p>'I lived in Australia for 15 years and have lived in the USA for 14 years,' she wrote on Instagram. 'Now you can stop asking about it. Also I was born in South Africa!'</p>

<p>Born in Johannesburg, Tammin and her family immigrated to Sydney when she was just four years old.</p>
