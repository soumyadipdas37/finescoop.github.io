<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>After years spent trawling behind in the ratings, Nine's Today show is finally catching up to Seven's Sunrise.</p>

<p>This week, the once-struggling breakfast program fronted by Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon, won on the east coast.    </p>

<p>Today beat Sunrise by 195,000 to 181,000 in total people, across Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. </p>

<p>Watch out, Kochie! The Today show WON on the east coast in the ratings war this week, narrowing the gap with Sunrise. Pictured: Today co-hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon </p>

<p>Sunrise, hosted by Samantha Armytage and David 'Kochie' Koch, is still however the nation's most-watched breakfast TV program across the five capital cities, with a viewership of 259,000 compared to Today's 229,000. </p>

<p>Nine's news boss Darren Wick told TV Blackbox on Saturday of the improvement in the ratings: 'We've got a good team behind the scenes and on air. </p>

<p>'These guys are working together nailing big stories and having fun.'   </p>

<p>A week earlier, Today had claimed victory in the east coast capitals of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, pulling a combined average audience of 191,000 - which was more than Sunrise's 189,000.</p>

<p>Impressive: Today beat Sunrise by 195,000 to 181,000 in total people, across Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane </p>

<p>These figures represent a triumphant leap in the ratings for Today, which had previously dragged around 70,000 viewers behind Sunrise back in June. </p>

<p>Speaking to investors last week, Channel Nine's CEO, Hugh Marks, commented on Today's progress over the past nine months.</p>

<p>'If you look at morning segments, Today show numbers are up around 10 or 15 per cent year on year and continuing to grow. Karl and Ally are doing a good job there for us,' Marks said. </p>

<p>Still top spot: Sunrise, hosted by Samantha Armytage and David 'Kochie' Koch (pictured), is still however the nation's most-watched breakfast TV program across the five capital cities, with a viewership of 259,000 compared to Today's 229,000 </p>

<p>Karl is understood to have recently signed a new contract with Nine, and Allison and the rest of the team are also locked in multi-year deals. </p>

<p>Today's growing popularity coincides with Karl's renewed focus on his job, after he admitted last year that his performance wasn't great in 2018, when ratings were falling at a rapid rate and his personal life was dominating headlines.  </p>

<p>He said at the time: 'Towards the end of last year, I was cooked. It had taken its toll, a lot of the [media] attention - all the unwarranted attention I thought, and you can't control any of that.</p>

<p>'I'm not going to complain too much about that, but what it meant was that in a work capacity I don't believe for a second I was at my best. I think I was struggling towards the end of last year.'</p>

<p>Praise: Speaking to investors last week, Channel Nine's CEO, Hugh Marks, commented on Today's progress over the past nine months: Karl and Ally are doing a good job there for us' </p>
