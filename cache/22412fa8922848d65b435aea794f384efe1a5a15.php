<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>While private security guards were bumbling their way to a deadly COVID-19 outbreak at Victoria's doomed quarantine hotels, those in control were desperate to appease whinging guests. </p>

<p>As the public inquiry into the disastrous program continued in Melbourne on Tuesday, it was revealed public servants routinely briefed ministers on dietary requirement complaints rather than addressing security issues.</p>

<p>Secretary for Victoria's Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions Simon Phemister told the inquiry Jobs Minister Martin Pakula was routinely briefed on problems with dietary requirements but not on issues such as the work of private security guards.</p>

<p>Jobs Minister Martin Pakula was regularly briefed on problems with dietary requirements but not on issues such as the work of private security guards.</p>

<p>Private security has been accused of bungling the hotel quarantine operation and causing Victoria's deadly second wave of COVID-19</p>

<p>Secretary for Victoria's Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions Simon Phemister claims he does not know who made the decision to hire private security guards at Melbourne hotels </p>

<p>Quarantine breaches involving private security guards seeded 99 per cent of Victoria's deadly second wave of COVID infections, which in turn has led to more than 700 deaths of the elderly. </p>

<p>More than 30 security guards ended up catching coronavirus from quarantined returned travellers while working in the hotels. </p>

<p>After more than three weeks of sitting, the inquiry has heard not a single person can identify who made the decision to hire the private security guards.</p>

<p>Mr Phemister told the inquiry 'typical exchanges' with the minister, whom will appear at the inquiy on Wednesday, had little to do with the security of the nation. </p>

<p>'The exchanges with the minister typically came through issues that were rolling through the hotels, the most prolific of which were concerns about dietary requirements and food in rooms,' he told the inquiry. </p>

<p>The inquiry has heard the DJPR was initially tasked with running the hotel quarantine program before it was taken over by the health department. </p>

<p>The question as to who it was that made the decision to employ private security over Australian Defence Force personnel or Victoria Police remains unanswered after more than a month. </p>

<p>Mr Phemister also claimed he did not know who had come up with the idea, but believed it was made in a key meeting involving Victoria Police and Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp on March 27. </p>

<p>The inquiry was again shown notes from a meeting that day where speculation remains that sections of Mr Phemister's team had already made the decision to employ private security.</p>

<p>Secretary for Victoria's Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions Simon Phemister texts then police chief Graham Ashton on March 27 </p>

<p>Guests at the Stamford Hotel in Melbourne are seen wearing masks as they get into taxis on June 25. Security guards employed by the Victorian Government have been linked to a deadly second wave of COVID-19</p>

<p>During the meeting, his staffer questioned former Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton about what role police would likely play at the hotels. </p>

<p>Later that day, Premier Daniel Andrews addressed a press conference where he announced private security would be guarding the hotels. </p>

<p>During that conference, Mr Phemister sent a text message to Mr Ashton telling him the DJPR were in control of the hotel quarantine program. </p>

<p>But Mr Phemister denied a decision had been made to use private security at the meeting earlier that afternoon.  </p>

<p>The public servant was grilled by barrister Dan Star QC, who was representing Victoria Police. </p>

<p>The Stamford Hotel in Melbourne was being used by the Victorian Government to house returning travellers</p>

<p>Rydges Hotel in Melbourne also housed returned travellers. Private security guards hired by the Victorian Government caused a deadly second wave</p>

<p>Timeline to disaster: How Premier Daniel Andrews came to announce private security would be used at hotels </p>

<p>'The only contingency being proposed was a model where private security would be present and police would assist when there’s a problem,' he asserted.</p>

<p> Mr Phemister denied the allegation. </p>

<p>The public servant also came under fire from counsel assisting the inquiry Rachel Ellyard after it was revealed the department had initially expected the hotels to arrange security. </p>

<p>'I too really want to emphasise the decision to hold in quarantine large numbers of people, some of whom might have or did have an infection, an infectious disease, COVID-19, I want to suggest to you that it wasn't appropriate for the government to structure its contracts in such a way that placed primary responsibility for infection control and PPE and matters of that kind on private companies rather than retaining that responsibility within Government,' she said. </p>

<p>'I can't comment on that matter,' Mr Phemister replied.</p>

<p>The inquiry was also shown a series of text messages that indicated internal concerns about employing private security from within the jobs department right from the get go.  </p>

<p>'Anyone had anything to do with or know about Wilson Security SecureCore? Any ideas on good security companies?' one WhatsApp message asked.</p>

<p>Another message read: “Gotta be careful with a lot of security companies. Heaps of cash work.'</p>

<p>'Cowboy industry.'</p>

<p>Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions Jobs Department executive Claire Febey questions what police will do at quarantine hotels on March 27</p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews will face the hotel inquiry on Friday </p>

<p>Another responded: 'Needs to be reputable. Don’t want … rogue … prowling the corridors.'</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon, DHHS secretary Kym Peake, whose department was in control of coordinating Victoria's response to the virus, told the inquiry she too did not know who made the decision to use private security guards. </p>

<p>'I am not aware of who made the decision that private security companies would provide services for the Victorian hotel quarantine program,' she stated. </p>

<p>'The department was not involved in the decision making as to how security services would be provided.'</p>

<p>Ms Peake said she was not even consulted about it. </p>

<p>'I was not consulted about the suitability of using private security firms to assist in the hotel quarantine program during the period in which the security firms were being engaged,' she said. </p>

<p>'I am also not aware of any member of my department having been consulted about this issue.'</p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews will front the inquiry on Friday.  </p>
