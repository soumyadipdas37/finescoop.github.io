<p>The New Zealand prime minister made lower costs for payWave payments her second people-pleasing promise in as many days while out on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>On Monday, she promised a new public holiday to celebrate the Maori New Year, and on Tuesday she unveiled Labour's small business policy.</p>

<p>Jacinda Ardern has promised to whack Australian banks with regulation to bring down the costs of contactless payment for Kiwis</p>

<p>Visiting Tauranga on the Bay of Plenty ahead of the October 17 election, Ms Ardern said it wasn't fair that the tap-and-go payments cost around 50 per cent more in New Zealand than Australia.</p>

<p>'It should be cheaper ... it's something that we have heard the call for, and we will be acting,' she said.</p>

<p>Australian companies make up the vast majority of banking in New Zealand, but the super-fast transactions are a rarity in New Zealand.</p>

<p>The contactless payments make up 83 per cent of in-person Australian card payments but just 15 per cent in NZ, according to a Newsroom report, because of higher costs slugged across the Tasman - primarily by Aussie banks.</p>

<p>The arrival of COVID-19 to Kiwi shores saw banks halt the fees, given the desire to limit physical distancing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for cash-strapped New Zealanders and businesses, the costs returned when the deadly virus was eliminated.</p>

<p>After getting a taste for the easier payments, Ms Ardern wants them to stay.</p>

<p>'We are committed to regulating this area so that we can see those merchant service fees come down for our small businesses,' she said.</p>

<p>'(Australian banks) are not paying the rates that we are in New Zealand. That's a good, sound starting point to say something needs to change.'</p>

<p>Industry bodies believe the contactless technology costs around one per cent for each transaction, a cost that is passed on to either the consumer or the retailer, while credit card transactions charge even more.</p>

<p>Ms Ardern wouldn't commit to bringing prices into line with Australia but said parity was 'a good starting point'.</p>

<p>If re-elected, Labour will also allow Kiwi small businesses to access around $NZ1.5 billion in government loans, extending a scheme first announced in May's budget.</p>

<p>None of that mattered to young Bennett Ballinger-Judd, who took a couple of hours off school with her mum to meet Ms Ardern.</p>

<p>Bennett was left speechless when the PM signed her book, writing 'Always remember, girls can do anything Bennett!' and posing for photos.</p>

<p>Ms Ardern continues to get a loving reception on the campaign trail, indicative of her thumping lead in the polls.</p>
