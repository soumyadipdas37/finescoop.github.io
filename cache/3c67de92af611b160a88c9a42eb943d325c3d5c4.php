<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jacob Rees-Mogg sparked anger today after telling people to stop their 'endless carping' about a lack of coronavirus tests. </p>

<p>The Commons Leader dismissed the growing pressure on the Government over its testing shambles as he claimed the system had been a 'phenomenal success' which should be celebrated. </p>

<p>Labour immediately slammed Mr Rees-Mogg as 'out of touch' and demanded he apologise. </p>

<p>There have been widespread reports in recent days of people across the country struggling to access a coronavirus check. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, official NHS Test and Trace statistics showed that just 33.3 per cent of people who were tested for Covid-19 in England in the week ending September 9 and had a so-called 'in-person' test received their result within 24 hours. </p>

<p>That represents a massive decrease on the 66.5 per cent recorded in the previous week. </p>

<p>Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg sparked anger today after he said people needed to stop their 'endless carping' about a lack of coronavirus tests</p>

<p>Speaking in the Commons today, Labour frontbencher Valerie Vaz questioned why the head of the Government's coronavirus Test and Trace programme, Dido Harding, had not spoken in public since August.</p>

<p>The shadow Commons leader added: 'The number of tests returned within 24 hours has fallen from 68 per cent to 8 per cent – it seems to be all talk, talk and no test, test.'</p>

<p>But Mr Rees-Mogg, who had to self-isolate last week while awaiting Covid-19 test results for one of his six children, hit back and said: 'We all have an obligation to try and stop the dangerous disease spreading, but the issue of testing is one where we have gone from a disease that nobody knew about a few months ago to one where nearly a quarter of a million people a day can be tested.</p>

<p>'And the Prime Minister is expecting that to go up to half a million people a day by the end of October.</p>

<p>'And instead of this endless carping, saying it is difficult to get them, we should actually celebrate the phenomenal success of the British nation in getting up to a quarter of a million tests of a disease that nobody knew about until earlier in the year.'</p>

<p>Shadow health minister Alex Norris said Mr Rees-Mogg should 'immediately apologise' for his comments. </p>

<p>He said: 'For weeks, people across the country have been struggling to get coronavirus tests. But rather than fixing problems, the Government has instead resorted to a blizzard of blame shifting and excuses.</p>

<p>'Now, out-of-touch ministers have got a new message to those who can't get tests: "stop complaining and praise us". </p>

<p>'Jacob Rees-Mogg should immediately apologise. Whining about the public not being grateful enough won't sort anything – only his Government can fix the testing shambles they are presiding over.' </p>

<p>Downing Street today admitted the coronavirus testing system is facing 'challenges'. </p>

<p>A Number 10 spokesman said: 'We accept there are challenges and we accept that we are seeing significant demand for tests at the moment.</p>

<p>'We are obviously working to address those challenges. We will continue to work to enhance testing capacity in the coming weeks.'   </p>
