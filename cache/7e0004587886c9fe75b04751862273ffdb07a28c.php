<p>Speaking to Raj &amp; Pilar on BBC Radio 1's The Reality Tea Podcast he said: 'I didn't really think about the cameras and everything until I got on that date. And then that's when you're like, whoa, like that was weird.</p>

<p>'Cause there were two dates going on, so I think obviously that Connagh G, he was doing a date at the same time.</p>

<p>'So with the way the cameras and the recording is, they would shoot sort of like one date whilst you had to sort of sit in silence because obviously they could only capture one date.</p>

<p>'So like my first meeting with Paige, we just sort of sat in silence. Staring at each other. Like we were just sat there and I was like trying to like graft Paige, but I couldn't. I was just stood there. I was sat there. I was just like in silence.</p>

<p>'So we just, we just sat. Yeah, I was, I was. I was like, what do I say to her? What do I compliment? Compliment this and I'll do that.'</p>
