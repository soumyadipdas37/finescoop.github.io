<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bayer Leverkusen have offered £9million to Arsenal for left back Sead Kolasinac </p>

<p>The Gunners are looking to raise vital transfer funds before the window shuts on October 5 and a deal involving both Leverkusen and Arsenal should progress on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Kolasinac has fallen down the pecking order under Mikel Arteta at the Emirates, with Kieran Tierney impressively nailing down the first-choice spot while Ainsley Maitland-Niles can also fill in on the left flank.</p>

<p>Bayer Leverkusen have launched a £9million offer to Arsenal for left back Sead Kolasinac</p>

<p>Atletico Madrid are ready to make a new offer for out-of-favour midfielder Lucas Torreira</p>

<p>Kolasinac joined Arsenal in 2017 and has featured 107 times for the club, but his time in north London appears to be drawing to an end as the Gunners desperately look to gain the required money for priority targets Houssem Aouar and Thomas Partey.</p>

<p>In a further boost to the Gunners' hopes of raising funds, Atletico Madrid - the club Arsenal are hoping to entice Partey away from - are poised to launch a new offer for Lucas Torreira.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Arsenal were in contact with Lyon over a move for Aouar again on Tuesday night. </p>

<p>Aouar has emerged as Arteta's No 1 target this summer as he seeks much-needed creativity in the middle of the park. </p>

<p>Arsenal have been heavily linked with the French midfielder but they have struggled to agree a fee with Lyon, but they will be hoping the potential sale of Kolasinac and Torreira will be more than enough to get their man.  </p>

<p>The Gunners are desperate to raise the cash for Lyon star Houssem Aouar before October 5</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta also wants to bring in Atletico midfielder Thomas Partey this summer</p>
