<p>CEO Jeffrey Previte was caught on security camera thrashing his defenseless dog Beachy and grabbing the whimpering hound by the throat</p>

<p>In the August 22 video, Previte, 46, can be seen yanking the dog off the floor by the scruff of its neck and violently jerking the animal through a door</p>

<p>A concierge, who has asked to remain anonymous, heard the dog's cries from his seat at the building's front desk and told DailyMail.com he filed a report</p>

<p>'I heard the dog screaming and when I looked on the camera, I saw him beating the dog,' the concierge said. </p>

<p>The man filed a report about the incident to the building's management and he told Previte he had the footage and was going to write a report.  </p>

<p>'He became irate... and then he hung up on me,' the man said. 'He apologized the next day, but I didn't think it was a sincere apology.'</p>

<p>The concierge filed the report writing: 'At 6.55pm, I witnessed Jeffery [sic] Previte beating his dog.'</p>

<p>In a statement to DailyMail.com. Previte didn't deny that he was rough with the dog but instead claimed that the concierge was extorting him. </p>

<p>'I think this is very unfortunate that this has come across your desk. I don't even know exactly what to say but I will say this: [The concierge] called me the evening of this interaction with my dog and that was at nine o' clock at night and he attempted to extort money from me so that he wouldn't report it to the building.</p>

<p>'There's nothing illegal about what I did - I said if you need to tell the building, tell the building. </p>

<p>'The building manager took it very seriously. I find it very unfortunate that we are even talking about this.'</p>

<p>The concierge filed a report about the incident to the building's management where he said he felt violated </p>

<p>The attack on the dog took place at his apartment in the Seychelle Condominiums building in Santa Monica, California</p>

<p>'I heard the dog screaming and when I looked on the camera, I saw him beating the dog,' the concierge said</p>

<p>'There's nothing illegal about what I did - I said if you need to tell the building, tell the building,' Previte told DailyMail.com </p>

<p>The concierge explained to DailyMail.com exactly what he saw transpiring on the security screen.</p>

<p>'He was very angry. He was choking and slapping the dog,' he said. 'He even slammed the poor dog against the wall.'</p>

<p>The man claimed that his report was not taken seriously by his manager.</p>

<p>'My boss laughed in my face,' he said. 'I took the next day off work. I just felt that they should have called the police at least.'</p>

<p>The concierge said that Previte has no kids and has lived in the building for about five years.</p>

<p>'He dates strange women that come in and out,' the concierge said of Previte, adding, 'He wears a Make America Great Again hat and he rides bikes. </p>

<p>'He's hardly there - he goes back and forth to Boston. He is probably only there once every two months. You hardly see him. He drives fancy cars and he is in and out.'</p>

<p>According to Previte's social media, he is an avid hunter and outdoorsman who is the CEO of an environmental risk and compliance management consulting firm</p>

<p>Previte was seen posing with a deer that he appears to have hunted in a 2011 photo on Facebook which he captioned: 'I didn't mean to kill Bambi'</p>

<p>Previte was appointed joint CEO of EBI Consulting, an environmental risk and compliance management consultancy firm just last week.</p>

<p>He is also the vice chairman of the board of directors at the company which has over 400 employees in offices across the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>According to his company bio, 'Jeff has built its telecommunications consulting business to be the market leader in delivering environmental and engineering consulting to the wireless industry.' </p>

<p>The building management said in a statement to DailyMail.com, 'The apparent conduct of the unit owner was abhorrent and completely unacceptable. Building management stands behind our employee and we took swift action including contacting animal control and directing the resident to cease all contact with our employee. We continue to evaluate other measures that can be taken with our counsel.' </p>
