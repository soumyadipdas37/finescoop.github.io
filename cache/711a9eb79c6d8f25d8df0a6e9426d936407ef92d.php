<p>Firebrand leftwinger Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, lashed out at plans to get 80 per cent of mandarins back at their desks within weeks.</p>

<p>Addressing the TUC Congress today he said the safety of workers was being put at risk because of the 'irresponsibility' of the Government.</p>

<p>Ministers want civil servants to lead the way in returning to offices to help city and town centres struggling while millions work from home. </p>

<p>But Mr Serwotka told the virtual event today: 'We are prepared to take action to keep people safe.'</p>

<p>TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady urged the Chancellor not to cut off support for jobs as the furlough scheme ends, otherwise she said there could be mass redundancies</p>

<p>Civil servants have been accused of making a ‘mockery’ of Boris Johnson’s push to get staff back into the office by advertising ‘work from home only’ jobs.</p>

<p>While Ministers have ordered officials to return to their desks, Whitehall departments this month were putting up recruitment adverts saying office work will not resume any time soon. </p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence, the Department of Health, Public Health England and the Food Standards Agency are among those advertising work from home only jobs. </p>

<p>At the end of August, the Cabinet Secretary wrote to all Whitehall ministries setting a target to get 80 per cent of staff to attend their usual workplace each week by the end of September. </p>

<p>Last week the Cabinet Secretary wrote to all Whitehall ministries setting a target to get 80 per cent of staff to attend their usual workplace each week by the end of September. </p>

<p>Speakers at the first ever online TUC Congress today detailed a 'litany of Government failures', from a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and decent sick pay, to concentrating more on the economy than a safe return to office working.</p>

<p>General secretary Frances O'Grady urged the Chancellor not to cut off support for jobs as the furlough scheme ends, otherwise she said there could be mass redundancies.</p>

<p>She said time was running out to prevent huge job losses, adding: 'From this Thursday, it will be just 45 days before the job retention scheme ends.</p>

<p>'That's the notice period that companies have to give if they intend to make mass redundancies.'</p>

<p>It takes a whole community to beat a pandemic, she said, continuing: 'It can't just be done from Westminster corridors or company boardrooms.</p>

<p>'Yet some in the Establishment behave as if there's one rule for them, and another for everybody else.</p>

<p>Civil servants have been accused of making a ‘mockery’ of Boris Johnson’s (pictured today) push to get staff back into the office by advertising ‘work from home only’ jobs</p>

<p>'Too often, ministers struggle to imagine lives that are unlike their own.</p>

<p>'Like when the Prime Minister ordered a return to work, without a proper plan for public transport, and precious little thought about working mums and dads, and childcare.</p>

<p>'Instead, a useless app, a mutant algorithm, and a half-baked test and trace system. Less 'moonshot', more moonshine.'</p>

<p>Liz Snape, of Unison, said the Government's 'neglect' had worsened the crisis, while inequalities in society had been exposed.</p>

<p>The 'litany' of failures included a failure to provide PPE or proper funding to the Health and Safety Executive as well as the 'crisis' in testing, she said. </p>

<p>A statement by the TUC's general council said the public health crisis had exposed the depth of health inequalities in the UK, including along lines of class, race and gender.</p>

<p>It said: 'The Government's decision to delay implementing lockdown led to thousands of tragic, and unnecessary, deaths.</p>

<p>'The failure to plan, prepare and deliver proper PPE supplies to the NHS and social care left frontline workers exposed.</p>

<p>'The absence of an effective test and trace system and the scandal of patients being discharged from hospitals untested into care homes cost lives and livelihoods.</p>

<p>'Too many women, black workers and disabled workers found that when they were issued PPE, it failed to fit properly and to provide adequate protection.'</p>

<p>The TUC is calling for an independent public inquiry into the crisis.</p>
