<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gold Coast residents have been warned hard-partying Year 12 students will ignore the ban on Schoolies and continue the traditional week-long party. </p>

<p>The event is held over a three-week period and typically has dates for both Queensland and interstate Schoolies trips from November to December.</p>

<p>Schoolies 2020 was set to take place between November 21 to December 12 but was cancelled by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk over COVID-19 fears. </p>

<p>But experts said school-leavers would still be attending and encouraged property owners to finalise their coronavirus safety plans, realestate.com.au reported.   </p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (pictured above) cancelled all events and parties associated with schoolies because of COVID-19 fears in August </p>

<p>Body corporate expert Sarah Pearson, from Stratacare on the Gold Coast, said property owners would be faced with additional challenges at this year's Schoolies.  </p>

<p>'Owners and building managers need to make definitive plans and take adequate steps to mitigate against the additional risks,' she explained.      </p>

<p>The Queensland premier cancelled all Schoolies events, such as beachfront concerts, in August to avoid 'contracting or spreading COVID-19'. </p>

<p>'The pandemic means we cannot have mass gatherings. Parents need to know their children's safety comes first,' Ms Palaszczuk explained. </p>

<p>Ms Pearson said the lack of events would encourage school leavers to remain indoors and increase safety risks inside any Gold Coast accomodations.      </p>

<p>'This will exacerbate all the usual risks associated with Schoolies like balcony safety, underage drinking, drugs, noise and property damage,' she explained. </p>

<p>Ms Pearson also said there would be demand for 'tighter and robust security' as well as stricter hygiene measures.   </p>

<p>There are fears the cancelled events will increase safety risks like underage drinking, drugs, noise and balcony safety (group pictured on a balcony in 2019) at Gold Coast accomodations</p>

<p>Owners and building managers have been encouraged to adopt a 'zero-tolerance policy' in regards to any rule breaking (a group of school-leavers pictured on the Gold Coast)</p>

<p>'This should include strategies to enforce social distancing, increasing cleaning and hygiene requirements and contact tracing protocols.'   </p>

<p>Queensland accommodation providers will be required to register all guests as part of their COVID-safe plans.</p>

<p>The Queensland government have also limited gatherings in residences to no more than 10 people during the Schoolies dates.  </p>

<p>Ms Pearson encouraged property owners to develop a clear COVID-19 plan with rules and consequences before the beginning of Schoolies. </p>

<p>She said a 'zero-tolerance policy' should be implemented for any rule breaking or flouting of coronavirus restrictions. </p>

<p>Ms Pearson said Schoolies would provide a 'much-needed financial windfall' after the Gold Coast suffered through a lack of tourism during the coronavirus pandemic.  </p>
