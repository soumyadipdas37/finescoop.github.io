<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A cyclist was injured after slamming into a power pole right in the middle of a bike lane.</p>

<p>The rider struck the obstacle while travelling along a new shared pathway on Victoria Road before the Anzac Bridge in Sydney's inner-west.</p>

<p>He shared photos of his injuries to Facebook while slamming planning authorities for failing to provide adequate cycling infrastructure.</p>

<p>'Are there other cities in the world that hate cyclists as much as Sydney?'  he wrote.</p>

<p>'This is what passes for a cycle path here - paint on the pavement with a lamp post in the middle of the lane. </p>

<p>A cyclist was seriously injured after slamming into a lamp post right in the middle of a bike lane</p>

<p>'Unfortunately there isn’t room to get round the inside of it either. Now it hurts when I breath - probably a cracked rib.'</p>

<p>Some thanked the cyclist for drawing it to their attention. </p>

<p>'City planning at its best. Thankfully you aren’t seriously hurt and thanks for pointing it out to the rest of us,' one woman said.</p>

<p>But some locals were unsympathetic.</p>

<p>'Mate, I think you should find another sport if you can’t look 20 meters in front of you. I’ve ridden past that pole 1000 times and nave never thought twice about it,' one said.</p>

<p>He shared photos of his visible cuts and scratches after hitting the pole at speed</p>

<p>He said he may have cracked several ribs as a result of the impact with the pole</p>

<p>'Drive a car you wouldn't have this problem,' another said. </p>

<p>'I get it, the path sucks. I ride it and I walk it. But we need to adjust to the environment around us and too many cyclists fang it down that hill which is dangerous for everyone,' a third added. </p>

<p>It isn't the first time Sydney's cycling community has raised concerns over the placement of power poles.</p>

<p>Dr Kerryn Phelps shared a photo of a bike lane with a similar obstacle at Wilson Street in Darlington last November.</p>

<p>'I have visited the area in recent weeks, and couldn't help but notice a small design fault. See if you can spot it! What could possibly go wrong?,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'I would've thought that the best time to remove a telegraph pole would have been before the cycleway was surfaced.' </p>

<p>Similar concerns were also also raised in June about the new bike path on Eldridge Street in Footscray, Melbourne. </p>

<p>A local cyclist posted a picture of the bike lane being blocked by five garbage bins.</p>

<p>'This separated bike lane seems sub-optimal,' they wrote alongside the picture. </p>

<p>A 'poorly designed' bike lane in Melbourne has caused confusion and some anger among cyclists just weeks after it was finished after residents started leaving bins in the lane (pictured)</p>
