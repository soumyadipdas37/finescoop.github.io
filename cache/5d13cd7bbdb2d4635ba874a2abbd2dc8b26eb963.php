<p>Explicit content: Strictly star Nicola Adams has risked the wrath of BBC bosses by revealing she's going to set up a racy OnlyFans account with her girlfriend</p>

<p>Last Monday while on holiday in Mykonos, Nicola created a poll which asked her followers whether she should have a joint OnlyFans account with Ella - with 82 per cent voting yes.</p>

<p>Nicola's girlfriend Ella, who lives with the boxer in Leeds, already has her own profile on the subscription service, which is famed for users sharing explicit pictures and videos.</p>

<p>Ella sells nude images and sexual clips on her OnlyFans account with users paying £20 a month to get her exclusive content or £140 for the year.</p>

<p>'Should we do it?': While on holiday in Mykonos, Nicola created a poll where 82 per cent of her fans voted in favour of the pair having a couples profile on the subscription service </p>

<p>Celebrities such as Love Island's Megan Barton-Hanson, 26, and TOWIE star Lauren Goodger, 33, have admitted to making money on OnlyFans, while Disney actress Bella Thorne, 22, reportedly earned $1million in just a day on her account. </p>

<p>Nicola was the first openly LGBT person to win a boxing Gold at the 2012 Olympic Games in London and did the same at Rio in 2016. </p>

<p>The athlete will perform on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing with a female professional dancer, marking the first same-sex pairing in the show's history.</p>

<p>After being confirmed for Strictly last week, Nicola said: 'I think it's really important, it's a big step for the show. It's nice to see that we're able to move on.'</p>

<p>Nicola explained she insisted on dancing with a woman when she got the call from BBC producers.</p>

<p>She continued: 'I asked the show about it. They wanted to know if I wanted to be on the show and I said, "Yeah, I'll do it, but I want to dance with another female dance partner."'</p>

<p>Strictly previously featured two male professionals dancing together, Johannes Radebe, 33, and Graziano di Primam, 26, but only in a one-off routine. </p>

<p>Pop star Max George, 31, actress Caroline Quentin, 60, Nadine Coyle's ex Jason Bell, 42, and EastEnders star Maisie Smith, 19, are all confirmed for this year's line-up. </p>

<p>Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing, 31, will also be on the show after having to dropout last year due to injury. </p>

<p>Prior to her relationship with Ella, Nicola was engaged to fellow boxer Marlen Esparza, 31, for 16 months, but they announced their split in April 2018. </p>

<p>Nicola was reportedly left 'heartbroken' when he ex moved on shortly after their breakup with her personal trainer. </p>
