<p>'Finally being able to visit my old French farmhouse, pictured here, is what I’m so looking forward to, and then to get behind the wheel of my treasured US army-style Jeep.</p>

<p>‘I keep my Willys Jeep across the Channel because France is such a big country compared to here and the roads are so much quieter. </p>

<p>'I can drive it off-road in the woods near my home in the south-west of France – it’s one of the things I most enjoy doing in the summer. It’s so relaxing.</p>

<p>Nick Hewer, 76, (pictured) who lives in Northamptonshire, revealed he has spent lockdown hosting online pub quizzes for charities </p>

<p>‘I’ve always loved cars. It began when my country vet father got a Land Rover Mk 1 way back and I would drive it in the grounds of our home in my early teens. Then my mother got a Mini Mk 1 not long after it launched in 1959, and I had just as much fun driving that. I’ve always loved tinkering around under the bonnet too.</p>

<p>‘The American Willys Jeep was probably the most iconic Second World War military vehicle. I paid about £12,000 for my fully restored lefthand drive model about 20 years ago. </p>

<p>'Even though it’s more than 65 years old, it starts every time and doesn’t have a spot of rust. But I draw the line at wearing an old US army helmet – I’m not a geek!</p>

<p>‘The vehicle next to it here is a 1948 British-built vintage Grey Ferguson tractor which I use to mow the grass. I’ve now got nine cars, three in France and six here in England.</p>

<p>'None of them are of any great value – together they’ll be worth less than the typical supercar – but they’re all iconic in their own way. I keep the cars in special cocoons for much of the year to keep the dust off.</p>

<p>‘Among the vintage motors I keep in storage in the UK are a 1931 Austin 7 Swallow and a 1936 Austin 7 Opal two-seater tourer – not the sort of cars you’re likely to see a rock star driving on the motorway.</p>

<p>Nick said British architect Norman Foster’s magnificent Viaduc de Millau is his favourite view in France. Pictured: The Viaduc de Millau in France</p>

<p>‘I’ve been holed up with my partner Catherine at home in Northamptonshire over the lockdown. I’ve barely been out of the door – I’ve been playing it safe – so I’m looking forward to getting out and about now that filming of Countdown has started again in Salford.</p>

<p>‘I’m really looking forward to the drive down through France in my modern convertible. I usually take the ferry from Portsmouth to Caen. </p>

<p>'It’s then a glorious eight-hour drive south to my house. I take the quieter roads, via little villages and towns, and I instantly feel the anxieties melt away.</p>

<p>‘My favourite view in England is from atop the Marlborough Downs, near where I grew up. But a favourite view in France is when I reach British architect Norman Foster’s magnificent Viaduc de Millau. </p>

<p>'Sometimes I just drive across it and back again – the view is that good!</p>

<p>‘I’ve kept in shape during the lockdown with an exercise bike and I’ve been devouring books on my Kindle, such as Andrew Lownie’s The Mountbattens: Their Lives And Loves. I’ve also been listening to podcasts, most recently David Dimbleby’s The Sun King on Rupert Murdoch.</p>

<p>‘I’ve become a handyman too and drained my garden pond. I’ve also hosted online pub quizzes for charities like Street Child, a very worthy cause.’ </p>

<p>Nick said he's looking forward to visiting seafood restaurant J Sheekey in London (pictured) as restrictions ease </p>

<p>‘The seafood restaurant J Sheekey in London, which I’ve been visiting since the 1960s. </p>

<p>'I particularly like their fish stew and I’m looking forward to going again. </p>

<p>'The two people I’m most looking forward to hugging are the French couple who have been keeping an eye on my house in my absence, Patrick and Catherine – he’s even been cutting the grass for me, bless him!’</p>
