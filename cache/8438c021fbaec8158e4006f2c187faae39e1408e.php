<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>More rail franchises could face being nationalised from this weekend as measures introduced to help railways survive the coronavirus pandemic expire on Sunday </p>

<p>At the start of lockdown in March, the Government signed Emergency Measures Agreements for all of Britain's rail franchises, in order to keep trains running while demand collapsed amid lockdown. </p>

<p>At a cost of at least £3.5billion to the taxpayers, the measures involved the Department for Transport taking on franchise holders' revenue and cost risks, while paying them a fixed fee for operating trains.</p>

<p>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the Emergency Measures Agreements in March, as a means of protecting rail services and preventing operators from going into insolvency as passenger demand dropped</p>

<p>With the agreements set to run out on Sunday, the Government-controlled Operator of Last Resort is on standby to take over services, should rail firms decide to hand back their contracts.  </p>

<p>The OLR is already responsible for Northern Trains and London North Eastern Railway. </p>

<p>Officials have been in intense negotiations with train companies over what should happen when the EMAs expire on Sunday.</p>

<p>Any company that did not agree to the EMA would lose control of its respective services, passing them on to the Operator of Last Resort, the Government-backed group which operates London North Eastern Railway</p>

<p>The OLR is also responsible for Northern Rail, and could become responsible for more franchises if contract talks do not reach an agreement by Sunday</p>

<p>The DfT is under pressure to reduce the amount that franchise holders are paid.</p>

<p>Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon told the Commons on Thursday that £100 million has been paid out to shareholders as a result of EMAs, and 'that cannot continue'.</p>

<p>On March 23, the same day Boris Johnson announced lockdown, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps shared details of Emergency Measures Agreements being made with rail operators.</p>

<p>Train services were about to see a huge drop in demand, brought about by the public listening to the Stay at Home message from Government.</p>

<p>The measures were designed to keep skeleton services running for key workers, while also helping to compensate refunds for those no longer needing season tickets. </p>

<p>Explaining EMAs at the time, Mr Shapps siad: 'These agreements will suspend the normal financial mechanisms of franchise agreements, transferring all revenue and cost risk to the government. </p>

<p>'Operators will continue to run day-to-day services for a small, pre-determined management fee. Companies entering into these agreements will see a temporary suspension of their existing franchise agreement's financial mechanisms for an initial period of 6 months, with options for further extension or earlier cancellation as agreed.' </p>

<p>If a company did not wish to sign the agreement, then the services on that franchise would be passed to the OLR. </p>

<p>Speaking in March, Transport Secretary said the EMAs were a temporary measure, warning that allowing the companies to go into insolvency 'would cause significantly more disruption to passengers and higher costs to the taxpayer'. </p>

<p>But there is growing speculation that some operators could hand back control of services if the DfT reduces the amount it is willing to pay in management fees.</p>

<p>That would mean the OLR - which already runs Northern Trains and London North Eastern Railway - taking over more franchises, effectively nationalising them.</p>

<p>Mr McMahon said it was 'absolutely staggering' that no announcement has been made regarding what will happen when EMAs expire on Sunday.</p>

<p>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs that 'it is not possible to conduct negotiations with nine different operating companies in public', adding that he would make a statement 'as soon as there is something to say'.</p>

<p>Department for Transport data shows demand for rail travel fell to as low as 4% of pre-pandemic levels in April, but has since returned to around 40%.</p>

<p>Even before the crisis, some operators such as South Western Railway were suffering financial difficulties.</p>

<p>The franchise, owned by FirstGroup and MTR, made a pre-tax loss of £139 million in the year to March 2019.</p>

<p>Mr Shapps said in January that its services could be taken into public ownership as its financial statements indicated it was 'not sustainable in the long term'.</p>

<p>The Government-commissioned rail review was due to be published in autumn 2019, with a key part expected to be an end to the rail franchising model.</p>

<p>But it has been delayed by December's general election and the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
