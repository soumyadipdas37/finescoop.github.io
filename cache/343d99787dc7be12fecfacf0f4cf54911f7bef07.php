<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Louis Vuitton is releasing a $960 luxury face shield for people to wear amid the coronavirus pandemic, and while it was only a matter of time before the protective visor got a designer upgrade, critics are outraged by the high price point.</p>

<p>The LV Shield, which also doubles as a cap, has gold studs that are engraved with the Louis Vuitton logo as well as a head-strap and trim featuring the French fashion house's signature monogram print. As an added touch, the visor's photochromatic shield changes color from clear to dark when in direct sunlight.</p>

<p>In a statement, Louis Vuitton has described the high-end personal protective equipment as 'an eye-catching headpiece' that is 'both stylish and protective,' but some people would beg to differ.  </p>

<p>What? Louis Vuitton is launching a $960 luxury face shield. The COVID-19-inspired visor is slated to hit stores on October 30 as part of the French fashion house's 2021 Cruise Collection</p>

<p>Critics have taken to Twitter to slam Louis Vuitton for offering a designer face shield during the global crisis, with some calling it 'profiteering' and 'robbery.' </p>

<p>'Louis Vuitton really out here selling a face shield for 1k! Tf,' one person tweeted.</p>

<p>'I'm certain Louis Vuitton would have made "luxury" life jackets for the Titanic if they could have. Extortion and daylight robbery,' another griped.  </p>

<p>Someone else mocked the shield by sharing a photo of himself wearing a knockoff version made out of Louis Vuitton monogrammed tape and a plastic bag. </p>

<p>Others were quick to judge those who plan on buying the designer shield. </p>

<p>'I don't know how rich or how stupid one would need to be to drop a thousand dollars on an LV face shield. If absolutely necessary, I'll wait for the $5 counterfeit,' one Twitter user commented.  </p>

<p>'If you plan to buy this new $1000 Louis Vuitton face shield, please let me know. I need to make sure I don’t follow you,' another shared.  </p>

<p>Some Twitter users pointed out that a face shield isn't even proven to be effective in protecting people from the coronavirus. </p>

<p>Made his own? One person mocked the shield by sharing a photo of himself wearing a knockoff version made out of Louis Vuitton monogrammed tape and a plastic bag</p>

<p>'Wow!! What a waste of money. People don’t think that the virus can travel around a face shield?' one person asked. </p>

<p>'Nah cause wtf that Louis Vuitton face shield gonna do???? 1K for something that has a lot of open areas??? The rich are not serious,' someone else commented.  </p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not currently recommend the use of face shields as a substitute for masks.  </p>

<p>According to a recent simulation done by researchers at Florida Atlantic University’s College of Engineering and Computer Science, the shields prevent the initial forward spread of droplets, but the gap at the bottom actually allows the infectious aerosols to spread behind the person.</p>

<p>High-end PPE: In August, Burberry debuted a $115 reusable face mask in its signature plaid pattern</p>

<p>Worth it? The face covering features particle filtration efficiency (PFE) and is also said to come with antimicrobial technology that helps protect it from germs</p>

<p>While some people are appalled by the luxury shield, Louis Vuitton isn't the first brand to put a designer spin on PPE in recent months. </p>

<p>In August, Burberry debuted a $115 reusable face mask in its signature plaid pattern. The face covering features particle filtration efficiency (PFE) and is also said to come with antimicrobial technology that helps protect it from germs.  </p>

<p>The British fashion label said that 20 per cent of each purchase would go towards its Burberry Foundation Covid-19 Community Fund.   </p>

<p>Early on in the pandemic, LVMH, the French conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton, helped fight COVID-19 by making hand sanitizer and protective masks out of its perfume and handbag factories, respectively. </p>

<p>The company also provided 261 ventilators to hospitals in France and 2,500 cloth masks to MTA workers in New York City in May. </p>
