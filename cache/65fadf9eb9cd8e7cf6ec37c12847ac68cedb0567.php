<p>The boy was shot in the left leg while two men ages 45 and 34 were hit in the right leg and another 40-year-old man and 47-year-old woman were struck in the left foot. </p>

<p>All five victims were transported to Kings County Hospital Center with non-life threatening injuries. None have been identified publicly. </p>

<p>Five people were shot and wounded, including a six-year-old boy, when gunfire erupted at an outdoor J'Ouvert celebration in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood early Monday morning. First responders are seen rushing one of the victims into an ambulance</p>

<p>The shooting took place just before 3am Monday at the intersection of Nostrand Avenue and Crown Street - where about 300 people had congregated for a pre-dawn processional</p>

<p>Detectives are still working to determine the motive for the shooting. It's unclear whether any of those shot were targeted on purpose. </p>

<p>The NYPD's Chief of Department Terence Monahan tweeted about the incident and condemned the 'senseless violence'. </p>

<p>Disturbing video captured the moment gunshots rang out as revelers screamed in terror. </p>

<p>'It was really crazy - everyone was in shock,' Joshua Kristal, who was in the procession, told the New York Post. </p>

<p>The youngest victim was seen lying in a pool of blood as bystanders and police rushed to his aid - including a woman believed to be the boy's mother.  </p>

<p>'The boy, his mom was carrying him. You could see there was blood in his pants,' Kristal said. </p>

<p>'She dropped him, I didn't know what to do, then I saw tons of blood.' </p>

<p>Kristal said he ran over to help the woman who was shot in the foot and held pressure on her wound until medics arrived. </p>

<p>'A woman was walking around saying: "I'm shot in the foot, I'm shot in the foot,"' he recalled. </p>

<p>'I was holding her foot. I was wondering where all this blood was coming from. It was really crazy.' </p>

<p>Video obtained by ABC7 showed first responders carting people into ambulances soon after the shooting took place.  </p>

<p>Police arrested two men at the scene who were carrying guns. It is unclear whether either is suspected of carrying out the shooting </p>

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled the official J'Ouvert celebration and the West Indian Day parade, which also would have been held on Monday, due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>But many people got up early to recognize J'Ouvert - a pre-dawn party that signifies the launch of Carnival in Caribbean nations - before daybreak on Monday anyway. </p>

<p>De Blasio had warned last week that the NYPD would break up any Labor Day gatherings that flouted his ban. </p>

<p>Hours after the shooting, a heavily police presence was stationed on Eastern Parkway, the traditional site of the West Indian Day parade.  </p>

<p>The West Indian American Day Carnival Association is still planning to hold its 53rd annual celebration, but will be doing so virtually.  </p>

<p>Brooklyn's J'Ouvert festivities have been marred by violence in past years.</p>

<p>In 2016, 22-year-old grad student Tiarah Poyau was shot dead through her eye by Reginald Moise, 20, after she asked him to stop grinding on her at the festival. </p>

<p>In 2017, four people were stabbed and one was shot during the revelry.  </p>
