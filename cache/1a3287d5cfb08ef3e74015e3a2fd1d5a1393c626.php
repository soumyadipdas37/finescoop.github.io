<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pine-Sol has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as an effective cleaner that can kill the novel coronavirus.</p>

<p>This make the common disinfectant, which is owned by The Clorox Company, one of the nearly 500 products approved by the agency to neutralized the virus.  </p>

<p>In a press release, the company stated Pine-Sol was effective against the virus with a '10-minute contact time on hard non-porous surfaces.' </p>

<p>Earlier this year, President Donald Trump speculated about injecting a disinfectant into the human body as a defense against COVID-19.</p>

<p>But public health experts warn these products are not meant to be ingested in any way and that doing so can have serious consequences.</p>

<p>Pine-Sol Original Multi-Surface Cleaner was found effective against the virus on 'hard non-porous surfaces' after letting it stand for 10 minutes by a third-party laboratory, The Clorox Company said.</p>

<p>Pine-Sol, which is found on the EPA's website under the name 'Tuck 3,' was added to the agency's list of 'Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2' on September 3. </p>

<p>According to Good Housekeeping, the cleaner is listed under the code 5813-101 on the EPA's website. </p>

<p>'With a long-standing history of being a powerful cleaner and disinfectant...Pine-Sol Original Multi-Surface Cleaner now offers the clean families have trusted through generations with the protection they need right now against the spread of SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,' Chris Hyder, Vice President and General Manager of the Cleaning division, at The Clorox Company, said in a statement.</p>

<p>'We hope this new Pine-Sol kill claim will increase access to disinfectants that can help prevent the spread of COVID-19.' </p>

<p>To disinfect surfaces against the coronavirus, The Clorox Company recommend applying Pine-Sol with a clean sponge or a cloth.</p>

<p>Next, wet the surface and let stand for 10 minutes before rinsing.</p>

<p>According to the company, most of the other disinfectants recommended by the EPA have not been specifically tested against the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>

<p>Several cleaning products, such as Clorox and Lysol, have experienced shortages with some reporting it will be difficult to find these products in either wipe or spray form until 2021.</p>

<p>However, The Clorox Company says Pine-Sol disinfectant is not experiencing such shortages and  is 'readily available' both in stores and online.</p>

<p>The EPA says that, when using any of the products on its list, to follow label instructions for 'safe, effective use.'</p>

<p>This includes instructions for contact time, or the amount of time the surface should be visibly wet, before being rinsed.      </p>

<p>Pine-Sol was founded by chemist Harry Cole in Jackson, Mississippi, with the original formulation being pine oil-based, which is a natural disinfectant.</p>

<p>Clorox acquired the Pine-Sol brand from American Cyanamid's Shulton Group in 1990, but the products no longer contain pine oil to reduce costs</p>

<p>The company is perhaps most famous for having comedienne Diane Amos serve as the spokesperson for advertising campaigns since 1993 with her famous catchphrase: 'That's the power of Pine-Sol, baby.'</p>
