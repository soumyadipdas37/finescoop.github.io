<p>A NASA scientist has speculated that it may be a discarded part of the Surveyor 2 Centaur rocket that launched in 1966.</p>

<p>Tony Dunn, an astronomer, told DailyMail.com: 'Further observations will reveal its density. If it is hollow like a rocket booster, solar radiation pressure will significantly alter its course.' </p>

<p>Astronomers have spotted an object with an incoming trajectory towards Earth that could become a temporary minimoon</p>

<p>DailyMail.com has contacted NASA for more information and has yet to receive a response.  </p>

<p>Earth has only had two minimoons on record – one in February 2020 and the other in 2006.</p>

<p>Unlike the other two, 2020 SO has yet to be confirmed as an asteroid, as some scientists believe it could be space junk hurling towards Earth.  </p>

<p>However, 2020 SO has been classified as an Apollo asteroid in NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Small-Body Database, which is a class of asteroids whose paths cross Earth's orbit.</p>

<p>Dubbed 2020 SO, the entity has been on an Earth-like orbit for more than a year and is set to become trapped in our planet's gravity starting in October and stay until May 2021</p>

<p>However, some experts have noticed it is moving much slower than a typical asteroid and suggest it could be man-made space junk. A NASA scientist has speculated that it may be a discarded part of the Surveyor 2 Centaur rocket that launched in 1966</p>

<p>NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies Database shows the object is between 12 and 46 feet long, which also matches properties of the 1966 Centaur that measures 41.6 feet long.</p>

<p>Experts have also noted that 2020 SO's velocity is much lower than that of an Apollo asteroid.</p>

<p>Space archaeologist Alice Gorman of Flinders University in Australia told ScienceAlert: 'The velocity seems to be a big one.'</p>

<p>'What I'm seeing is that it's just moving too slowly, which reflects its initial velocity. That's essentially a big giveaway.'</p>

<p>Paul Chodas with JPL identified this with the Surveyor 2 Centaur rocket body, launched on September 20, 1966.</p>

<p>'The very low Earth encounter velocity (0.6 km/sec is even low for lunar ejecta, so it is unlikely it is a natural body, even lunar ejecta, more likely space junk,' he wrote. </p>

<p>In February (pictured), NASA announced it had confirmed a new visitor in Earth's gravity. NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey discovered a temporarily captured asteroid, called 2020 CD3, which has been orbiting our planet for three years </p>

<p>An animation of the object in question shows that it is in fact heading towards Earth and will make to close swoops when it arrives. </p>

<p>In December,  2020 OS is expected to pass by Earth at a distance of around 31,000 miles and two months later, it will fly by at 136,701 miles. </p>

<p>The tiny cosmic object was estimated to be about six to 12 feet in diameter and had a surface brightness similar to C-type asteroids, which are carbon rich and very common.</p>
