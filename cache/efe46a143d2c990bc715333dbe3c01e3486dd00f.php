<p>The pre-order link from MacMillan also includes a letter from Portman herself, who reveals that she was introduced to the 'feminist baby book' after giving birth to her three-year-old daughter Amalia.</p>

<p>'Every gift we received seemed to be a book about fierce girls, women who changed history and, yes, literal feminist babies,' Portman said.</p>

<p>She added that she wasn't given these kinds of books when her son Aleph was born, and she realized that all of the characters were males.</p>

<p>'In response, I started changing the pronouns in my daughter's classic books. I decided, for my own first children's book, to use classic fables, because I didn't want to feel like we had to throw out the history of child-raising,' she added.</p>

<p>Portman also added she wanted to make her stories, 'reflective of the actual world, where about half the animal kingdom is male and half is female, and some are neither or both.'</p>

<p>She added that these classic tales, 'have great messages' about how 'hard work pays off' but these new versions are 'gender-safe,' adding that they aren't saying that boys' 'inner lives' are more valuable than girls. </p>
