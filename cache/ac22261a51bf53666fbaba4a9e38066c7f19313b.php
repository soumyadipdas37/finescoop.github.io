<p>Speaking on the Say Yes! with Carla Hall podcast, Kristen said: 'I'm going to get a lot of flack for this. And let me start by saying I don't care. I'm a great parent, I think. I'm learning every day.</p>

<p>Kristen explained: 'The reason for this is because when we had our first child and my husband would put her in the BABYBJORN and we'd walk around the neighbourhood, he'd pop a non-alcoholic beer in his hand and the baby would paw at it and put the rim in her mouth.</p>

<p>'It's a sentimental thing for my girls, right? It makes them feel close to their dad.'</p>

<p>The Frozen actress revealed that the girls have taken to drinking the beverage during their Zoom school sessions.</p>

<p>'They're both just sipping their Doulies. And I'm like, "What must these other parents and teachers think of me?"'</p>
