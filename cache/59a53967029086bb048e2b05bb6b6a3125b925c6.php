<p>'I'm within 5km of my house, I've been brutally arrested,' he bellowed to the dozens of onlookers, many of whom were filming the scene.</p>

<p>'I'm more than happy to give you my driver's licence, why the violence?'</p>

<p>As more police began to arrive, he addressed a sergeant directly, claiming: 'I've been brutally attacked by this man here, who doesn't have his name on his badge.</p>

<p>'Everyone here is a witness, I've done nothing wrong, nothing wrong at all.'</p>

<p>The man appeared to have been arrested for not giving police his details, but he insisted he had offered to give them his driver's licence.</p>

<p>He said he had simply asked why he needed to give them that information, and was then thrown to the ground 'by a pile of guys with guns'.</p>

<p>'Is this Australia? You will answer to the lord Jesus for what you're doing,' he yelled.</p>

<p>Onlookers taunted police as 'brainwashed' and 'hope you are proud of yourselves'.</p>

<p>Angry bystanders criticised the huge number of cops for 'one guy who did nothing wrong'.</p>

<p>'Why don't you go get the real crimes? The virus is fake,' one woman shouted.</p>

<p>The man was then marched off in handcuffs shouting 'liberty and freedom is gone'.</p>

<p>As the man was being arrested, a woman could be seen in the background also being handcuffed on the sand by half a dozen cops.</p>

<p>The slight relaxation of lockdown combined with the 26C temperature led stir-crazy Melburnians to flock to the cities few beaches.</p>

<p>But police stalked the sand in large groups, accosting anyone who showed the faintest hint of breaking the rules or being too far from home.</p>

<p>Not far away, there were dozens of arrests as hundreds of protesters took to the streets and parks to oppose the continued lockdown.</p>

<p>Victoria diagnosed just 14 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, its fewest in months, but Melbourne is still stuck in one of the world's strictest lockdowns.</p>
