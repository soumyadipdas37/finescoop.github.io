<p>Nvidia's boss has promised to give 'legally binding' guarantees on jobs if his company's takeover of British rival Arm is approved.</p>

<p>MPs, unions and Arm's co-founders have raised concerns about the takeover by the American chip giant, amid fears that jobs and the British firm's Cambridge headquarters could be moved to the US.</p>

<p>Nvidia has vowed to protect UK jobs and keep Arm based here but critics have dismissed the commitments as 'meaningless' unless they are formalised.</p>

<p>Jensen Huang, 57, has now promised to sign 'legally binding documents' agreeing to preserve jobs. </p>

<p>But he did not provide detail on what would be included in the agreement.</p>

<p>It is understood that such guarantees would likely be proposed by the Government after ministers complete an ongoing review of the deal.</p>
