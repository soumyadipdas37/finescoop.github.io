<p>Like other coronaviruses, COVID-19 can survive on surfaces for several days. </p>

<p>New South Wales Health lists the hazards of this disease on its website but despite that warning, the state government housed returned travellers in unhygienic conditions.</p>

<p>Lauren Farmer, 38, has spoken out about being initially quarantined early last week in a Travelodge Hotel at Surry Hills in Sydney</p>

<p>'Hi everyone, not super happy right now because got to the hotel and it's, like, the worst one that was an option,' she said on social media. </p>

<p>New South Wales Health said COVID-19 behaved like other coronaviruses and 'may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days'</p>

<p>This varied depending on temperature, humidity and the type of surface</p>

<p>Common household disinfectants are recommended to kill the virus</p>

<p>Alcohol-based hand santisers and soap are also recommended</p>

<p>Avoid touching your mouth, eyes or nose </p>

<p>She then documented her concerns and relayed them to the NSW Police Force, who are in charge of hotel quarantining. </p>

<p>On Tuesday night last week, the remaining 366 guests at the Sydney Travelodge were moved to other hotels, in a military-style operation designed to minimise the prospect of COVID-19 spreading.</p>

<p>Ms Farmer told the ABC's 7.30 program the bathroom was unclean, after videoing mould on the shower tiles.</p>

<p>'I am just shocked. The bathroom was the worst,' she said.</p>

<p>'I started making calls to nurses to see if there was any way I could be moved.'</p>

<p>Professor Raina MacIntyre, the head of biosecurity research at the University of New South Wales' Kirby Institute, said dirty hotel toilets could potentially spread coronavirus if bathrooms weren't properly cleaned for the next set of quarantined travellers.</p>

<p>'The bathroom is probably the highest risk setting and that is because the virus is shared in the faeces,' she told the ABC.</p>

<p>'Studies show that just flushing the toilet can cause massive aerosolization of the virus so it can be all over the bathroom surfaces.'</p>

<p>While NSW Police is in charge of hotel quarantining, the cleaning is left to third-party cleaning companies.</p>

<p>Travelodge said it had hosted more than 2,000 guests in hotel quarantine since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared March, insisting rooms had been cleaned thoroughly before and after travellers had been accommodated.  </p>

<p>Returned traveller Kelsey Burrows arrived landed in Sydney from Ireland in late August. </p>

<p>The 30-year-old travel agent, who lost her job in Dublin in March before making the tough decision to fly home, was feeling jet-lagged and 'fragile' when she arrived at Travelodge and saw cockroaches in her room.</p>

<p>'I went into panic mode when I saw them,' she told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>Returned traveller Kelsey Burrows arrived landed in Sydney from Ireland in late August.

<p>Since March, Travelodge Sydney has continuously hosted around 2000 rooms as part of the NSW Government’s mandated hotel isolation program, and has received thanks from many guests who have appreciated the care and service from our team.</p>

<p>We can confirm that earlier today 366 guests were relocated from our hotel to other accommodation. Our most recent site inspection with police and health authorities was conducted on July 28, and we were deemed compliant and retained on the isolation program. We are not aware of any subsequent audit, nor are we aware of any COVID-19 related concerns.</p>

<p>The Travelodge Sydney has strict protocols in place around COVID-19 cleaning and these have not been brought into question by the NSW authorities. All hotel rooms are deep cleaned thoroughly before and after guest use.</p>

<p>We respect the decisions that authorities need to make in these times and remain committed to supporting them.</p>
