<p>'I haven't really checked, party because I don't want to know,' she continued. </p>

<p>Kate confirmed that her children have returned to school, but she's concerned that there could be an outbreak at her 15-year-old daughter Sunday's school.  </p>

<p>She explained that Sunday's best friend's cleaner has tested positive for the virus, so she's pulled Sunday out of school until the best friend gets her test back.</p>

<p>Back in May, Kate admitted that she regretted not leaving Italy for Australia before the pandemic got too bad. </p>

<p>During an interview on The Project, co-host Peter Helliar asked Kate: 'Are you looking at us (Australia) going, "Maybe we should have returned earlier… Why didn't we get out?"'</p>

<p>'What do you think, Helliar?' she sarcastically replied.</p>

<p>'You're like one of the people on the lifeboat on the Titanic yelling out at the band, who's still playing as the boat goes down, "Do you wish your violin was here, mate?"</p>

<p>'Thanks for the comfort!'</p>

<p>Regrets: Back in May, Kate admitted that she regretted not leaving Italy for Australia before the pandemic got too bad</p>

<p>During her interview, Kate also revealed she had stopped learning Italian because she feels 'frozen in this weirdly interior world' of her apartment.</p>

<p>'People use this opportunity to improve themselves, like you have just shown people being creative and people singing songs with their kids and TikTok-ing and la-la. I'm not one of those people!' she said.</p>

<p>'You get to know yourself under these circumstances, and my God, I'm an ordinary person! I'm just churning out meals, trying to keep the spirits up, but I'm not learning Italian.'</p>
