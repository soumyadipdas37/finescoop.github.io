<p>Despite protests from residents, West Oxfordshire district council gave the couple permission to create a kidney-shaped water feature on their home in August. </p>

<p>The Beckham family's building pans had previously been blocked to protect wildlife before being given the green light under certain conditions. </p>

<p>David and Victoria Beckham have started digging a lake at their £6 million Cotswolds home</p>

<p>Excavators have been seen digging out tons of soil at the estate in Oxfordshire</p>

<p>Designer Victoria, 46, and ex-footballer David, 45, will have to plant hedgerows and trees to protect native birds, and also use special lights to help bats</p>

<p>Excavators were seen digging out tons of soil at the estate in Oxfordshire, the Sun Online reported.  </p>

<p>Designer Victoria, 46, and ex-footballer David, 45, will have to plant hedgerows and trees to protect native birds, and also use special lights to help bats. </p>

<p>It is the Beckhams' latest planning success after they were given the green light to build a wine cellar and a guard house.</p>

<p>The couple are now in a race against time to finish building the lake by February next year as workers can only be on site between August and February to protect nesting birds. </p>

<p>The lake will have a surface area of 2,976 square metres and maximum depth of four metres.</p>

<p>It is the Beckhams' latest planning success after they were given the green light to build a wine cellar and a guard house</p>

<p>It must have an underground chamber – known as a hibernacula – to help support reptiles, amphibians and hedgehogs.</p>

<p>The council also requires the Beckhams to submit a five-year maintenance plan to show how they will support the area's biodiversity.</p>

<p>Several residents objected to the plans. Neighbour Michael Douglas blasted the couple for 'trying to bring suburbia to the countryside'.</p>

<p>He said: 'If they had wanted all they have applied for, why not find an estate which was big enough to accommodate all of this.'</p>

<p>The council also requires the Beckhams to submit a five-year maintenance plan to show how they will support the area's biodiversity</p>

<p>The design statement says the lake will 'will function as a wind barrier and habitat, as well as enhancing the privacy of the house'.</p>

<p>The statement argues the lake will 'improve the landscape' by providing a habitat for wildlife.</p>

<p>The Beckhams have also committed to planting native trees and scrub and hedge plants for nesting birds and other small animals.</p>

<p>West Oxfordshire planning chiefs insisted these were planted to protect local wildlife.</p>

<p>They also want an underground chamber - known as a hibernacula - to help support reptiles, amphibians and hedgehogs.</p>

<p>The decision report also require Victoria and David Beckham to submit a five-year maintenance plan to show how they will support the area's biodiversity.</p>

<p>The couple will also have to provide details of the lights they will use surrounding the lake.</p>

<p>Several residents objected to the plans. Neighbour Michael Douglas blasted the couple for 'trying to bring suburbia to the countryside'</p>

<p>West Oxfordshire District Council ignored residents' objections to the Beckhams' plans.</p>

<p>Some residents called it 'ugly', 'monstrous' and 'out of keeping' with the posh area.</p>

<p>The council's report said it had three letters of objection from neighbours.</p>

<p>It summarised their concerns as: 'Out of keeping. Won't appear a natural feature.</p>

<p>'Will alter the visual impact of the countryside in that area of green fields with crops in them. Harmful to wildlife.</p>

<p>'How are they proposing to fill this lake?</p>

<p>'If yet another bore hole, Soho Farmhouse, is drilled down it will of course affect the water table.'</p>

<p>However Ms Eldrige's report said: 'The site is in a relatively isolated location so the development will not impact any neighbouring properties.'</p>
