<p>To combat these numbers, Amazon has designed a new Ring sensor that sits inside a mailbox and alerts users when it is opened or closed – allowing them to keep their mail safe and secure.</p>

<p>The system was quietly revealed along with the tech giant’s Ring Product Announcement Thursday, which included a home surveillance drone.</p>

<p>Amazon has designed a new Ring sensor that sits inside a mailbox and alerts users when it is opened or closed – allowing them to keep their mail safe and secure. The Mailbox Sensor pairs with the Ring app, allowing customers to receive real-time alerts, and is equipped with a camera that activates when the postbox is opened</p>

<p>The technology is just $30 and is attached to the door or flap of a mailbox that is triggered every time it is opened or closed.</p>

<p>Similar to the Ring Motion Sensor accessory for Ring lighting products, the new Mailbox Sensor is a little sensor that relies on Amazon's Sidewalk technology to extend the range of your Wi-Fi network. </p>

<p>The tech giant’s Sidewalk is said to be a new long-term effort to greatly extend the working range of low-bandwidth, low-power, smart lights, sensors, and other low-cost devices customers install at the edge of their home network.</p>

<p>Using the 900 MHz spectrum, the technology increases the connection range of smart devices by more than one half mile.</p>

<p>The Mailbox Sensor was quietly revealed along with the tech giant’s Ring Product Announcement Thursday, which included a home surveillance drone (pictured) </p>

<p>Sidewalk also allows users to put their smart devices anywhere around their property and ‘know they’ll work, even in dead spots where WiFi and Bluetooth don’t reach’, according to Amazon.</p>

<p>Although the Mailbox sensor could stop thieves from stealing mail, it was the firm's Ring Always Home Cam that received the most attention Thursday.</p>

<p>It consists of a flying black camera, powered by rotor blades, that automatically takes off from a stationary white dock if it detects movement in the house. </p>

<p>Ring Always Home Cam still needs approval from the US Federal Communications Commission, but once cleared will go on sale next year for $250.</p>

<p>Amazon's Ring Always Home Cam provides a live view of what's going on in the user's home to their smartphone via the Ring app, in case of unwelcome visitors</p>

<p>Industry expert and chief of research at analyst firm CCS Insight, Ben Wood, said Amazon is becoming 'increasingly pervasive in our daily lives'.</p>

<p>'The Always Home Cam is an incredibly ambitious device that will seem like something from a science fiction movie for many consumers,' he said.</p>

<p>'I expect it to generate a huge amount of interest from technology enthusiasts who are typically the people who embrace smart home technology first.</p>

<p>'However, it is also likely to provoke a huge discussion around privacy and the future role of technology in the home.'</p>

<p>Obstacle avoidance technology prevents Always Home Cam from bumping into unexpected or low-hanging objects as it moves through paths that are set by the user on the app.</p>

<p>The camera will only start recording when it leaves the white base – and when the device is resting in the base the camera is physically blocked and can't record.</p>

<p>Amazon devices have previously been activated when they're not wanted - meaning the devices could be listening.</p>

<p>Millions are reluctant to invite the devices and their powerful microphones into their homes out of concern that their conversations are being heard.</p>

<p>Amazon devices rely on microphones listening out for a key word, which can be triggered by accident and without their owner's realisation. </p>

<p>The camera on the £119.99 ($129) Echo Spot, which doubles up as a 'smart alarm', will also probably be facing directly at the user's bed. </p>

<p>The device has such sophisticated microphones it can hear people talking from across the room - even if music is playing. A hack by British security researcher Mark Barnes saw 2015 and 2016 versions of the Echo turned into a live microphone.</p>

<p>Fraudsters could then use this live audio feed to collect sensitive information from the device.   </p>
