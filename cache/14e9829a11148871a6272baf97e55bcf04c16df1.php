<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump will get a cash infusion from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, with the GOP super donor ready to spend between $20 million and $50 million to keep Trump in the White House. </p>

<p>CNBC first reported Adelson's plans, with the multi-billionaire expected to give the bulk of the money to a new pro-Trump super PAC called Preserve America. </p>

<p>The Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and other groups supportive of electing Republicans could also see some of Adelson's dollars.  </p>

<p>Billionaire Sheldon Adelson will commit between $20 million and $50 million to Trump-aligned groups after news broke that the president and Republicans squandered their financial advantage to Joe Biden and the Democrats</p>

<p>Adelson's team has been in touch with Republican officials close to the president about where best to deploy the funds, according to a CNBC source. </p>

<p>Last weekend, Trump visited Las Vegas, Adelson's city of residence and where his Las Vegas Sands Corportation is headquartered. </p>

<p>The Trump campaign declined to comment to DailyMail.com on whether the two businessmen met while the president was on the ground.    </p>

<p>The president is making a play for Nevada, a state he lost to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 by under 2.5 points. </p>

<p>But he also has to defend against Democratic gains in states he won in 2016. </p>

<p>On Sunday, billionaire Democrat Michael Bloomberg committed to dropping at least $100 million to help Trump's rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, flip the state of Florida.   </p>

<p>That news comes after Biden's campaign announced a record-breaking fundraising haul of $364.5 million in the month of August - the month Biden announced Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate and headlined a virtual Democratic National Convention.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party raised $210 million in August.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, The New York Times published a deep dive on how the Trump campaign squandered its financial advantage, burning through more than $800 million out of the $1.1 billion the campaign had raised from the beginning of 2019 through July 2020.  </p>

<p>The Times found that about $350 million, nearly half of all money spent, went to finding more donors - and the campaign spared no expense. </p>

<p>The report also documented some of the campaign's sillier expenses, including $156,000 for planes pulling aerial banners - a move often used to troll Democrats at their events. </p>

<p>The campaign also gave $110,000 to a company called Yondr, which provided magnetic pouches to the campaign for attendees of fundraisers to stow their cell phones in so no video or audio recordings could be made.  </p>
