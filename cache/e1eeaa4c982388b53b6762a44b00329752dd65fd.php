<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Inter Miami have completed the signing of Gonzalo Higuain on a free transfer after he left Serie A champions Juventus.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old striker will join the MLS side, owned by David Beckham, as a designated player - after he agreed a £2.3m payoff with Juventus to terminate his contract a year early.</p>

<p>Higuain will join Argentine compatriot Matias Pellegrini and the Mexican midfielder Rodolfo Pizarro as the team's highest-paid squad members.</p>

<p>Gonzalo Higuain has started training at Inter Miami after agreeing his move to the club</p>

<p>David Beckham has spoken about attracting Europe's biggest players to his MLS franchise</p>

<p>Nicknamed the 'Beckham Rule', the designated player option allows team in the MLS to sign up to three players outside of their salary cap.</p>

<p>Higuain joined training for the club on Friday and in a statement thanked Inter Miami for the effort made to sign him. </p>

<p>He said: 'I think it will be a beautiful experience in my life. It's what I was looking for - a new experience, a new league and a beautiful city.</p>

<p>'I'm really happy to be here and that it's official. My goal is to try to transmit all the experience I acquired in Europe and to help the team grow.'</p>

<p>Former Real Madrid and Chelsea striker Higuain, joined Juventus in 2016, where he scored 66 goals in 149 games in all competitions.  </p>

<p>'There were many battles together, many goals scored, with many often decisive. Now the paths of Higuain and Juventus go their separate ways,' Juventus said in a statement announcing they had terminated the 32-year-old's contract one year early. </p>

<p>The Miami Herald previously claimed the striker will earn a base salary of £5.45m ($7m) at Inter and has signed a contract that will take him to the summer of 2022. </p>

<p>Higuain follows former Juventus team mate Blaise Matuidi in Miami, and he will also be playing in the same league as his older brother, Federico Higuain, who plays for D.C. United.</p>

<p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic was the highest-paid MLS player in 2019 but has now re-joined AC Milan after leaving LA Galaxy last year.</p>

<p>Figures released by the MLS Player Association suggest the Swedish striker, 38, earned a base salary of £5.6m ($7.2m) in 2019.</p>

<p>That put him slightly ahead of Toronto duo Michael Bradley on £4.7m ($6m base) and Jozy Altidore on £3.8m ($4.9m base). </p>

<p>Inter Miami are in desperate need of a goalscorer for their debut MLS season, with all seven of their losses so far coming via a single-goal margin.</p>

<p>They currently sit bottom of the Eastern Conference after just two wins in 11 games.</p>
