<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fans have been singing the praises of Tottenham midfielder Tanguy Ndombele after his involvement in their equaliser against Southampton.</p>

<p>The French midfielder picked up the ball in the middle of the pitch after showing his strength against Saints hard man Oriel Romeu. </p>

<p>He then creates space for himself with a perfect piece of skill to get past James Ward-Prowse and get Spurs on the attack.</p>

<p>Fans have been singing the praises of Tottenham midfielder Tanguy Ndombele</p>

<p>Ndombele produced a moment of magic in the build up to Tottenham's equaliser </p>

<p>Ndombele then put the ball through to Harry Kane who set up Son Hueng-min in a fast, flowing move all begun by the Frenchman.</p>

<p>One fan tweeted: 'That was a world class piece of skill from Ndombele. World class'</p>

<p>Another fan said that the Tottenham midfielder is about to surpass Manchester United's Paul Pogba in the French set-up following his first half display. </p>

<p>They tweeted: 'Ndombele really about to end pogbas international career.'</p>

<p>Despite impressing in the first half of Tottenham's match against Southampton in the Premier League, Ndombele was dragged off at half-time, minutes after his moment of magic.</p>

<p>He was replaced by Giovani Lo Celso, who has shared the same injury woes as his counterpart in recent months.</p>

<p>There have been question marks over Jose Mourinho's faith in Ndombele after he made it quite clear last season that he was not in his favoured starting side. </p>
