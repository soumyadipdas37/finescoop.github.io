<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A horrific crash caused by a lorry driver in the UK who picked up his phone behind the wheel has been caught on camera - eight years after he killed another motorist recklessly driving.</p>

<p>The HGV driven by Cary Gordon, 58, hit a stranded car on the A34 at Marcham Interchange, Abingdon, on August 5 last year.</p>

<p>Now Thames Valley Police has released shocking dashcam footage that shows the distracted driver hitting the broken down car and then crashing off the road through the barriers.</p>

<p>A female victim, in her 50's, suffered a spinal fracture and cuts and bruises on her arms and one of her legs, from which she is still recovering.</p>

<p>It also caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to the roadside barrier and the A34 was closed for some time.</p>

<p>Gordon, 58, from West Sussex, later pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Oxford Crown Court.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to 14 months suspended for two years and 150 hours of community service on Tuesday 8th September.</p>

<p>The footage was only released now after police received permission from the car victim.</p>

<p>Gordon is seen glancing down at his phone in footage collected as evidence in his case</p>

<p>Gordon's victim's car is seen in video of the crash as he hits it on the road with his lorry</p>

<p>Gordon had previously been jailed eight years ago for six months over the death of Christopher Alderton, 30, in Sussex.</p>

<p>Mr Alderton died a week after the collision on the A24 in Dial Post, Sussex, on January 14, 2011.</p>

<p>Gordon, who was living in Worthing at the time, was sentenced at Hove Crown Court after admitting causing death by careless driving. </p>

<p>He had been working as a recovery driver when his Renault truck collided with Mr Alderton’s blue Nissan Micra.</p>

<p>Christopher Alderton died after Gordon crashed into his Nissan Micra back in 2011</p>

<p>After this latest offence Gordon was also disqualified from driving for two years and will have to take an extended re-test, as well as pay GBP 425 in legal costs.</p>

<p>Investigating officer, PC David Burleigh of the Joint Operations Road Policing Unit based at Abingdon, said: "The victim is lucky to have only sustained the injuries she has but has had to go through months of rehabilitation.</p>

<p>"The emotional stress and ability to overcome the crash is testament to her strength and character.</p>

<p>"With the victim's consent, we hope this footage will help to educate and prevent further incidents like this from happening in the future."</p>

<p>He said drivers are statistically four times more likely to crash if distracted by a mobile phone.</p>
