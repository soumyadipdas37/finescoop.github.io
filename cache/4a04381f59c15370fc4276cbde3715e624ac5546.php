<p>'30 years of friendship gone like that,' Warne wrote on Instagram after Jones suffered a massive heart attack on Thursday</p>

<p>Warne revealed he heard from his former teammate as recently as last week, when he touched down in Dubai for the IPL.</p>

<p>'I posted a picture on social media, and he texted me straight away, with a picture of him and Brett Lee and all the other commentators,' Warne said. </p>

<p>The former bowler paid tribute to the 'innovator' and 'maverick' in a written piece published by News Corp on Saturday. </p>

<p>The 51-year-old recalled the pair's 30 years of friendship and their memories both on and off the pitch.</p>

<p>'I've got so many memories of just being with Deano, in a team environment, talking, about everything, him doing and saying silly things and everyone ripping him apart,' Warne wrote. </p>

<p>Warne said he remembered rooming with Jones for his first Test. The pair would sit and talk about the game, with Warne 'soaking it all in'.</p>

<p>Warne revealed he heard from his former teammate as recently as last week, when he touched down in Dubai for the IPL. 'I posted a picture on social media, and he texted me straight away, with a picture of him and Brett Lee and all the other commentators,' Warne said</p>

<p>'I'm so thankful for that.'</p>

<p>Both cricketers used their love for the game to pursue commentaring careers.</p>

<p>They continued to keep in touch over the years, with Jones often making fun of Warne via text message.</p>

<p>'He'd message me a lot, wherever I was, wherever he was, about anything and everything. He used to rib me about my golf handicap. He'd call me a bandit,' Warne wrote.  </p>

<p>'Professor Deano' also sent Warne statistics on the game and asked for his opinion on 'this or that'. </p>

<p>Warne said his thoughts are with Jones' wife Jane and their two daughters.   </p>

<p>Jane - who was married to the man affectionately known as 'Deano' for 34 years - said she was overwhelmed by the scale of response in the wake of his shock death.</p>

<p>'My beautiful husband, the love of my life has lived his life with every bit of energy at his disposal, and he leaves an enormous gap in our lives which can never be filled,' Jane told The Age.</p>

<p>'He leaves us with so many wonderful memories that will last forever. At this challenging time, when our grief is so raw, we have drawn much consolation from the many messages of goodwill and support from so many people around the world. </p>

<p>'Given Dean's special love for the sub-continent, it was especially touching to hear so broadly from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. We are overwhelmed by the scale of the response to the news of his death and we will forever be grateful for that.'</p>

<p>Mrs Jones also paid tribute to Lee, who desperately tried to revive his commentary colleague via CPR and a defibrillator moments before an ambulance was on the scene.</p>

<p>Jane asked the cricketing world to respect the family's privacy at this time.</p>

<p>She said details of Jones' memorial celebration would be released in 'due course'.   </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lee paid respect to his close friend by sharing a touching video from their hotel. </p>

<p>Jones' playful side was on full display as he provided mock commentary of a golf 'tournament' inside a hotel room also featuring Lee and ex-New Zealand international turned commentary colleague Scott Styris.</p>

<p>'That one is underneath the tree then out of bounds,' Jones can be heard describing an errant shot from Lee.</p>

<p>He then grabs the putter off Lee and takes centre stage. </p>

<p>True to form, Jones shrieked to 'be the ball' before then describing his good mate Styris as his 'golf handicap'. </p>

<p>As the clip ends, Jones can barely contain his delight after winning the closest to the hole challenge by a matter of inches.</p>
