<p>All In was launched after Mellencamp lost 80 pounds following weight gain from IVF and pregnancy with her son Cruz, age five. </p>

<p>'At my heaviest, I felt lonely, sad and angry. At my smallest, I felt panicked, stressed and worried that I would gain the weight back,' Mellencamp's About page on the All In website reads.  'I very rarely felt great in my own skin.'</p>

<p>Adding: 'After struggling to get pregnant with my son and undergoing multiple IVF treatments, I gained 80+ pounds. I was thrilled to have my healthy baby boy but was left feeling broken inside. In order to be the best mom, wife and version of myself I knew things needed to change!' </p>

<p>According to the program's website the employees do not have fitness, medical or health certifications but are handpicked by Mellencamp and must complete the program themselves, including coaches assigned to every client and can move clients through the program's steps,.  </p>

<p>In screenshots shared by Gilles, clients and certified dietitians claimed that meal plans from the program that were shared publicly are less than 600 calories, while requiring an hour of cardio a day. </p>

<p>Experiences: Clients shared their experiences with Gellis to be posted, with one writing that the coaches were 'unhelpful,' and another writing that the 'restrictive' diet was 'unhealthy and hurt my body more longterm than it helped short term,' as they gained the weight lost back</p>

<p>Restrictive: Clients claimed they had to eat only plain broth for dinner during the two-week Jumpstart program and maintain a diet of 500 calories. A representative for All In said that the plans range from '750-1110' calories in an email appearing to be from the brand. Gellis called out Richards while sharing the email, 'Are you sure you want to stand by your BFF Teddi?' as she took issue with the still extremely restrictive calories, weigh-ins and daily hour of cardio </p>

<p>Gellis called out Richards while sharing the email, 'Are you sure you want to stand by your BFF Teddi?' as she took issue with the still extremely restrictive calories, weigh-ins and daily hour of cardio. </p>

<p>A medically reviewed Everyday Health report said that 'people need a minimum of 1,200 calories daily to stay healthy,' as bodies naturally burn a number of calories at rest. </p>

<p>Other clients claimed that plain broth for dinner was required during the Jumpstart phase was the only meal allowed. That same former client went on to claim that after those two weeks you were allowed one 'cheat meal' in which you could add green vegetables or protein to the broth. </p>

<p>Report: A registered dietitian messaged Gellis asking her followers to 'report' All In to the 'dietics licensing board in their state,' claiming that the program was 'violating licensing laws and causing harm from nutrition coaching' </p>

<p>Not one: The influencer wrote a post herself saying 'Not one medical professional has messaged me saying this diet is OK' </p>

<p>Doctor disapproves: A user, who claims to be a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine responded to Gellis post saying 'Because it's NOT! It's literally starvation! And then pushing your body beyond its means with ONE HOUR cardio without sustenance! Forget doctors, even trainers wouldn't approve of this' </p>
