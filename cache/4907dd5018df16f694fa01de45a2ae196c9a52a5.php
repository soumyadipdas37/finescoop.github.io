<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mike Tyson says he would relish a 'mind-blowing' charity match-up with Anthony Joshua.</p>

<p>The American boxing legend is due to face Roy Jones Jr in his return to the ring on November 28, although the coronavirus pandemic may yet hamper those plans. </p>

<p>And when asked whether he'd be interested in a charity bout with the current WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight champion, who aged 30 is 24 years his junior, Tyson was keen. </p>

<p>Mike Tyson said a charity match-up with Anthony Joshua would be 'mind-blowing'</p>

<p>AJ is 24 years older than Tyson and any match-up would be entertainment for a good cause</p>

<p>In an interview with iFL TV, he said: 'I would love to do that. That would be mind-blowing.'</p>

<p>'If doing that means we can have bigger charity exponents, well be it, I'm down to do that too. It's entertainment, it's just for charity - it's for a good cause, but we're giving our best.'</p>

<p>Tyson has regularly posted workout videos on his Instagram page over recent months and is in impressive condition. </p>

<p>The 54-year-old last fought professionally 15 years ago and no reputable governing body would sanction a competitive fight between him and AJ, although a glorified light sparring contest could be agreed to.   </p>

<p>Tyson has not fought for 15 years but seems intent on stepping into the ring aged 54</p>

<p>Shannon Briggs has offered to step in and replace Roy Jones Jr if he backs out of the November contest while Evander Holyfield was previously touted as a possible opponent. </p>

<p>Clearly Tyson is eager to lace up the gloves again but the seriousness of a charity bout remains to be seen. </p>

<p>Joshua is preparing to take on mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev in December this year. </p>

<p>His promoter Eddie Hearn has confirmed that the bout will go ahead despite the recent government rules on Covid-19 preventing fans returning to watch live sport. </p>

<p>Joshua won back his belts in the rematch against Andy Ruiz in Saudi Arabia last year</p>
