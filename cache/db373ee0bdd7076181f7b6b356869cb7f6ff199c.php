<p>Richelle Amey's husband Nick copped a road infringement while doing landscape work in the front yard outside his home in Caringbah in Sydney's south on August 4.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old said her husband parked his ute across the road from their house with the windows wound down slightly when a policeman approached the car.</p>

<p>'A cop yelled out to him while he was working saying "who's car is this?"' Mrs Amey told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'Nick said "it's mine" then the cop yelled "I'm going to fine you for having your windows down" and Nick said "are you serious?"</p>

<p>A Sydney family have been fined (pictured) for parking their car across the road from their house with their windows wound down</p>

<p>Mrs Amey said the policeman questioned her husband about what would have happened if he had left his wallet in the car.</p>

<p>'Nick said "well, there's not" and the cop said "I'm still going to fine you anyway". </p>

<p>'We got the fine in the mail and I was like "what the hell?" I couldn't believe it.'</p>

<p>It wasn't until after her husband was fined that Mrs Amey realised he had committed an offence.</p>

<p>NSW Road Rules state a driver can be fined for not 'making a motor vehicle secure' if they are more than three metres away from their car with their doors unlocked or windows down by as little as two centimetres. </p>

<p>Police and traffic officers have the ability to fine drivers if their car is unattended with the windows down by as little as two centimetres</p>

<p>Mrs Amey said while her husband's ute was in eyesight of where he was working, it didn't stop them from escaping the law.</p>

<p>'You have to be within three metres. You can't even go to pay for petrol,' she said.</p>

<p>Mrs Amey said there was no point in fighting the fine based on the ruling, but hoped to draw attention to the little known road rule.</p>

<p>'A lot of people would do this without knowing,' she said. 'I'm merely warning people because I think it's ridiculous.'</p>
