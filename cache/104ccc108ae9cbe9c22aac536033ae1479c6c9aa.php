<p>Gone! On Sunday's episode of The All New Monty: Guys and Gals, Tom Derickx let his nerves get the better off him - and he walked off during a strip routine. Pictured far right</p>

<p>Before the dress rehearsal started, he had admitted: 'I don't feel comfortable getting my kit off in front of everyone. </p>

<p>'I think it's a little bit too early to start doing it but I'm here for one reason and that's embarrass myself.' </p>

<p>However when it came down to the big moment, he wasn't able to go through with it - even though at this stage, the men were only removing their shirts. </p>

<p>Choreographer Todd McKenney worried that Tom could choke on the big night itself, when the men are due to strip fully naked. </p>

<p>Todd said: 'I think Tom had a mini freak out. I think it became a bit real for him. He's new at performing.</p>

<p>'I now have to ask myself whether on the night, when he has to be completely nude, whether he's gonna crumble'.  </p>
