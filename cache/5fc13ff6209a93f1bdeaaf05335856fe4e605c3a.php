<p>Ashley Bellino founded Stoned Crystals in Melbourne in 2015, and has since increased her brand's online sales by more than 134 per cent compared to this time last year</p>

<p>Stoned Crystals has been thriving amid Melbourne's lockdown, with $185,000 in gross online sales during July alone</p>

<p>But Stoned Crystals has been thriving after making $185,000 in gross sales during July alone. </p>

<p>Ms Bellino began holding Instagram Live sale events six times a week, where customers could ask questions and learn about a product virtually rather than in a physical store.</p>

<p>Consumers can then reserve the products they want to buy and are sent a link to purchase them on the Stoned Crystals website. </p>

<p>'It's very different from buying from a website, because when you buy from a website it's very dry,' Ms Bellino told news.com.au. </p>

<p>'You see a product, you might see a description, and then you might have some questions, and then you may or may not try to get in a live chat if you've got questions about that product.  </p>

<p>Ms Bellino said she became fascinated by crystals during a trip to China in August 2014.</p>

<p>She then started researching crystals and their benefits, and just months later quit her lucrative corporate job to open an online store.  </p>

<p>Ms Bellino is now developing an app with an in-built live sales feature, and encourages other business owners to turn to social media to sell their products. </p>

<p>'Bricks and mortar is becoming such an expensive operation and so many of them are going out of business. You can do a lot with live sales software,' she said. </p>
