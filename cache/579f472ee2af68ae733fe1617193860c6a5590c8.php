<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>France's highest court has ruled that a transgender woman cannot be officially recognised as the biological mother of the child she conceived with her wife.</p>

<p>To become one of the six-year-old girl's two legal mothers, the 51-year-old transgender woman would have to adopt her, the Cour de Cassation ruled.</p>

<p>The applicant, who was born male, was recognised as a woman by French authorities in 2011.Â </p>

<p>She then had a child with her wife in 2014, having not undergone the operation to have her male reproductive organs removed.</p>

<p>She has fought ever since to be recognised as the child's second mother, not father.</p>

<p>In 2018, an appeals court in the city of Montpellier ascribed her the status of 'biological parent', a new category.</p>

<p>But the Cour de Cassation threw out most of that ruling on Wednesday, and referred the case back to a lower court for a new hearing.</p>

<p>The woman's lawyer, Clelia Richard, described the ruling as 'scandalous' and said it was a 'lost opportunity.'</p>

<p>'The fight is unfortunately not over,' she said.</p>

<p>Another campaigner, Mathieu Stoclet, pointed out the 'incoherence' of the woman being recognised as female by the French system, but at the same time as the child's father.</p>

<p>'The ruling is a considerable step backwards towards a concept of parenthood that was believed to be long buried,' said Bertrand Perier of the APGL association of gay and lesbian parents.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the woman said they would take the matter to the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
