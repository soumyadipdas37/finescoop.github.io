<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A McDonald's worker has shared her pet peeves about working alone on night shifts, and explained why customers can't get a McChicken at 4am. </p>

<p>TikTok user fuzzjacq revealed the biggest issues staff face during the early hours, from being abused to dealing with overheating soft serve machines that spew out hot liquid.</p>

<p>She begged customers to be patient, wait their turn and said if they do their orders will be delivered fresh.</p>

<p>Speaking on the video titled 'I talk fast' the worker set the record straight, telling customers she has a lot to do and people need to follow a few basic rules.</p>

<p>The clip starts with her staring straight down the camera and saying: 'Things night shift workers at McDonald's would really like you to take into consideration'. </p>

<p>TikTok user, fuzzjacq (pictured) shared the video on Tuesday and revealed she receives abuse from customers and asked them to not call her 'lazy '</p>

<p>Her biggest tip to customers was not to order a McChicken at 4.30am because the breakfast menu starts at 4am and there is nothing she can do about it. </p>

<p>She then told viewers: 'If I ever tell you that I can't do a shake or a sundae because the machine is in heating it means the machine is in heating and spitting out hot liquid. </p>

<p>'I can not serve that to you. Please order something else, can I get you a frappe?'</p>

<p>The fast food worker also spoke out about being abused by impatient customers.</p>

<p>'I actually have a lot of jobs and detailed cleaning that I need to get done, I don't stand around all night doing absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>'Please do not tell me if I'm being lazy if I'm in the middle of a job.'  </p>

<p>The quick-talker revealed being told to wait 'in park' is a good thing, because takeaway customers will have their order delivered fresh to their car. </p>

<p>She finished by pleading with people to wait their turn patiently if they turn up to the burger restaurant at night and the cashier window is empty. </p>

<p>'I am the only one on the floor so I may not be able to get to the window very quickly, I might be serving someone on counter, I might be doing something else, but please just wait at the cashing window.' </p>

<p>She pleaded with people to wait their turn patiently if they turn up to the burger restaurant at night and the cashier window is empty</p>
