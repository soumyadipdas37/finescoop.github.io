<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Bale is on the verge of re-joining Tottenham on loan from Real Madrid, and the Spanish press are in no doubt as to the more jubilant party in the deal. </p>

<p>The Wales international, 31, agreed a season-long loan earlier this week, with Madrid subsidising at least half of his £500,000 per-week wages. </p>

<p>And he received a hero's welcome from jubilant supporters when he arrived at the club's training ground on Friday, seven years after leaving to join Real Madrid in a then world record £86million transfer.</p>

<p>AS' headline read: 'from villain to hero' as Gareth Bale closes in on a move to Tottenham</p>

<p>The Real Madrid forward was given a hero's welcome at Spurs' training ground on Friday</p>

<p>The front page of Spanish publication AS displayed one such image of jubilation with a fan taking a picture with the Welshman in his car, and with relief in Madrid that he has been moved on for the next season at least captioned it with the phrase: 'from villain to hero'.</p>

<p>AS also makes reference to the 'superstar' welcome Bale received upon his arrival in London, and claim that Spurs are expected to present the player today.</p>

<p>However, they also support Marca's claim that he will have to wait for his second Tottenham debut because he is still suffering from a knee injury he picked up on international duty with Wales earlier this month.</p>

<p>Marca themselves went with the headline: 'All yours', showing a picture of Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho smiling with Bale.</p>

<p>Above the main headline, the publication adds: 'Bale arrives at Mourinho's Tottenham... and is injured for a month!'</p>

<p>The outlet adds that Bale travelled to London on Friday to undergo his medical, but that it remains to be seen if his new injury setback affects the loan deal.</p>

<p>The final note Marca adds is that Sergio Reguilon was is also in London to finalise his move to Spurs. The club have agreed a £27.5 m deal with a further £4.5 m due in add-ons.</p>

<p>He has signed a five-year deal, with Spurs agreeing to Madrid's demand for a £36.5 m buyback clause — a demand Manchester United refused in their pursuit of the player — which can be activated in the next two years. </p>

<p>Marca however claimed it remained to be seen if his new knee injury would affect the deal</p>

<p>As revealed by Sportsmail, the deal for Bale will cost Spurs £13m in wages and does not include an option or obligation to buy him. However, they will have an option extend the loan for a second year.</p>

<p>Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is keen to retain an option to bring Bale back to the Bernabeu next summer, despite the player's fall-out with manager Zinedine Zidane.</p>

<p>Perez is wary of Bale rediscovering his best form in England so has left the door open for him to return next season.</p>

<p>Spurs' deals for Bale and Reguilon however were not completed in time for the pair to be involved in Sunday's trip to Southampton.</p>

<p>Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguilon is also set to join Spurs in a permanent transfer</p>
