<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gordon Ramsay has been savaged online over his Sunday lunch, with diners branding it a 'child's portion' and questioning where the rest of the trimmings are.</p>

<p>The British chef took to his Instagram page over the weekend to share a snap of his roast, which he serves at his Savoy Grill restaurant in London, as part of a two-course £40 set menu.</p>

<p>But while Gordon, 53, labelled the 'sirloin of beef with all the trimmings' 'absolutely stunning', several of his 9.8million followers were left unimpressed by the three baby carrots and roast potatoes offered - with one person asking: 'Where's the rest of it?'</p>

<p>It's the third time this month that the celebrity TV chef's portions have been slammed - with both his £19 Full English Breakfast at the Savoy Grill and the 'tiny' £23 steak and over-salted chips at his York &amp; Albany eatery in Camden, being criticised. </p>

<p>The British chef (pictured in 2019) took to his Instagram page over the weekend to share a snap of his roast, which he serves at his Savoy Grill restaurant in London, as part of a two-course £40 set menu</p>

<p>But while Gordon, 53, labelled the 'sirloin of beef with all the trimmings' 'absolutely stunning' (above), several of his 9.8million followers were left unimpressed by the three baby carrots and roast potatoes offered - with one person asking: 'Where's the rest of it?'</p>

<p>Gordon shared a photograph of his Sunday lunch at the Savoy Grill in London on Instagram, yesterday, writing: ‘Sunday’s at <?php echo e('@'); ?>SavoyGrillGordonRamsay roast sirloin of beef with all the trimmings... absolutely stunning!’</p>

<p>The meal involved a single slice of beef, three roast potatoes, three carrots, plus broccoli and a Yorkshire pudding.</p>

<p>But some social media users were left disappointed with the portions, and asked: ‘Is that a child’s portion?’</p>

<p>A second wrote: ‘Error 404. Trimmings not found,’ while a third added: ‘How is three potatoes, three micro-carrots a smidge of broccoli and a slice of roast enough? Just really am curious.’</p>

<p>The restaurant offers a set menu - with two courses coasting £40 and three courses costing £45 - with dishes including lobster cocktail, smoked salmon or omelet for starters.</p>

<p>Reaction: Some social media users were left disappointed with the portions, and asked: ‘Is that a child’s portion?’</p>

<p>Diners are told online: ‘Our chefs’ insistence on prime local produce and precise culinary technique means guests revel in the delights of roast sirloin of beef, seasonal vegetables and Yorkshire pudding, followed by a classic Savoy dessert - Baked Alaska.</p>

<p>‘Topped off with your choice of a Bloody Mary or fruit cocktail, this two-course experience is a luxurious roast you'll remember!’</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Gordon Ramsay's representative for comment. </p>

<p>It comes after Gordon was slammed online by a diner who recently visited one of his London restaurants and was left disappointed after being served a tiny steak and over-salted chips, costing £23. </p>

<p>Posting on Tripadvisor, Guillaume R left one star for the British chef's York &amp; Albany eatery in Camden, last week, alongside a scathing review.</p>

<p>Titled 'Gordon is not Heston', referring to fellow celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal, the post suggested Gordon was treating his customers as a 'joke'.</p>

<p>'When one masters and creates molecular cuisine the other has come up with homeopathic cuisine,' the diner wrote.</p>

<p>'Gordon isn't Heston but Gordon is Jesus. He multiples the steaks. Give him a regular sized one portion steak in any restaurant and this is what he comes up with.</p>

<p>'Five slices of meat over-salted fries. £23...,' the customer added, alongside a photograph of the meal. </p>

<p>'Gordon you made a name giving advice on how to run a restaurant. Let me give you my advice. This is COVID time. Hospitality sector is in bad shape. </p>

<p>'Blatantly joking at your customers won't help your business,' the diner continued, before offering two stars for the 'polite staff'.</p>

<p>Titled 'Gordon is not Heston', referring to fellow celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal, the post suggested the portions were a 'joke' and the fries were 'over salted'. Pictured, Gordon in 2019</p>

<p>The diner's meal is labelled 'Steak frites' on York &amp; Albany's (pictured) menu, costing £23, while a number of sides are available at the added price of £5.50</p>

<p>Side dishes offered include triple cooked chips, heritage tomato salad with pickled onion, creamed potato with garlic butter and grilled broccoli with crispy shallots. </p>

<p>The review comes after Gordon was mocked on Twitter earlier this month for the Full English breakfast served at his Savoy Grill restaurant.</p>

<p>He posted a picture of the dish to his social media account to explain that it will be available at his London restaurant from September 21. </p>

<p>Many people questioned 'where's the rest of it?’ - with one person even sharing a snap of a large traditional Full English made up of six slices of bacon, three sausages, two fried eggs and a large hash brown. But the photograph appeared to be too much for Gordon, who unleashed his well-known 'idiot sandwich' phrase on the Twitter user (above)</p>

<p>But social media users were left gobsmacked after discovering the meal - which includes two eggs, one sausage, a few strips of bacon, one tomato and one mushroom - cost £19. </p>

<p>Many people criticised the steep price, while others questioned 'where's the rest of it?’ - with one person even sharing a snap of a large traditional Full English made up of six slices of bacon, three sausages, two fried eggs and a large hash brown.</p>

<p>But the photograph appeared to be too much for Gordon, who unleashed his well-known 'idiot sandwich' phrase on the Twitter user. </p>

<p>The chef replied to the snap: 'That’s called a Full English Classic Heart Attack you idiot sandwich,' using the saying which he coined in a parody of his show Hell's Kitchen in 2015.</p>
