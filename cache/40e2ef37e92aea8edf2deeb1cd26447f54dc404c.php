<p>'Our wildlife biologists, who are experts in human-bear conflicts, believe that once a bear has scavenged on the remains of humans that they pose a real serious risk of doing that behavior again,' the park's spokesperson Jamie Sanders said.</p>

<p>'We never want bears to associate people with food.'</p>

<p>The cause of Madura's death is unknown and Hazel Creek trial has been closed off for investigation.</p>
