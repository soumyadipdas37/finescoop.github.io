<p>Marcela Iglesias, from Los Angeles, is regularly asked if she's a teenager, and is told she doesn't look old enough to be her 19-year-old son Rodrigo's parent (pictured together)</p>

<p>The flattered mother-of-one admitted that her teenage son (pictured as a baby with his mother) used to get embarrassed by strangers' assumptions</p>

<p>She said: 'When we go out together to concerts or shopping - people think I am part of his gang. They can't believe I am his mother.</p>

<p>'I am flattered, it is a massive compliment. My son used to get embarrassed when he was young but he loves it now.'</p>

<p>Explaining why she believes people don't think she's old enough to be a parent, Marcela said: 'I guess it is because I am not a typical mother. I am trendy and fashionable.</p>

<p>'We sometimes share clothes, I have some unisex jackets which look great on him,' she added. </p>

<p>In a stem cell facelift, doctors take stem cell- enriched tissue from fatty areas like the stomach or inner thigh and inject it back into the face. </p>

<p>Growth factors can also be added to help foster the existing cells to regrow and rebound into fresher-looking skin.  </p>

<p>Doctors may also use a centrifuge to separate the skin cells and add them back into the fat before grafting. </p>

<p>Marcela confessed that she often doesn't act her age and is always catching up with her teenage son's friends. </p>

<p>'Rodrigo says I don't look like a "normal" mother,' she admitted. 'I am a little crazy and extreme but Rodrigo doesn't mind. I don't act my age.</p>

<p>'I love hearing what the younger generation have to say, because they are our future - so I always catch up with my son's friends.</p>

<p>'I find that people forget how to live their life and worry too much with age, but I do my best to live life to the full.'</p>

<p>Despite spending $1,000 per year on Botox, Marcela hasn't had any plastic surgery - but she has had filler in her lips and cheeks to maintain her youthful looks, as well as stem cell therapy.</p>

<p>Marcela said: 'I started getting Botox and fillers in my thirties. I get it to maintain and enhance my natural looks.</p>

<p>'I have also had stem cell therapy which meant I was injected with 30 million stem cells. It is to repair and generate healthier and new cells.</p>

<p>Marcela and her son (pictured together when Roderigo was a baby) have a close bond and similar interests</p>

<p>'But I have never had any other cosmetic procedures - I definitely think less is more. I am not against surgery, but I do think if you get too much - it can make you look older.'</p>

<p>She added: 'However, I would be open to a face lift in the future if I need one. I also lead a stress-free life and quit smoking which is a key ingredient to looking younger.</p>

<p>'I lead a healthy and balanced lifestyle, which is always good for your appearance.'</p>

<p>Marcela and her son have a close bond and similar interests, with the mother adding: 'We are incredibly close and always together. We go shopping a lot together because he gives great fashion advice.</p>

<p>'Our bond is more like siblings rather than mother and son so it is not surprising that others are mistaken.'</p>
