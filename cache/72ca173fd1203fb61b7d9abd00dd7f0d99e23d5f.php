<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dog owners in Saudi Arabia can now enjoy a cup of coffee alongside their beloved pets at a new cafe - a first for the ultra-conservative kingdom.</p>

<p>In Islam, dogs are considered unclean animals - unlike cats - and are generally banned from public places in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>But The Barking Lot, which opened its doors in June in the coastal city of Khobar, has delighted animal lovers in a country where there are few places to take pets outside the home.</p>

<p>Owners can bring their dogs to the Saudi cafe, with the pets getting pampered as their humans drink coffee</p>

<p>The country's once-notorious religious police used to ban the walking of pets, saying men were using it as a means to make passes at women.</p>

<p>But the ban was widely flouted and pets are becoming an increasingly common sight.</p>

<p>The adoption of strays has become more popular in the kingdom, which is trying to modernise as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's 'Vision 2030' plan. </p>

<p>Animal shelters have sprung up in several cities. </p>

<p>The Barking Lot's Kuwaiti owner, Dalal Ahmed, said she got the idea during a previous visit to the kingdom.</p>

<p>'I came to Saudi Arabia for a visit with my dog, but wasn't allowed to walk on the beach with him,' she told AFP.</p>

<p>'I was very sad and decided to help by opening a coffee shop for people who have dogs - and even for those who do not.' </p>

<p>Young men and women gather at the cafe with dogs of all sizes.</p>

<p>Some pets playfully romp around, while others sit on their owners' laps, or wait patiently at the counter as their guardians order drinks.</p>

<p>In one section, dogs are treated to washes and blow dries as part of the grooming services offered.</p>

<p>'The idea of this cafe is very new,' said Johara, a Saudi citizen. 'It's a distinct place where dogs can come and meet other dogs.'</p>

<p>For Nawaf, also from Saudi Arabia, it was the first time visiting the cafe, which he described as 'beautiful'.</p>

<p>'I came here to play with the dogs, which now have a cafe for themselves for the first time in Saudi Arabia,' he said.</p>
