<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The shocking final hours of five men's lives have been laid bare in an inquest after they took a synthetic drug they believed was similar to MDMA.</p>

<p>The men, aged between 17 and 32 who were not known to one another, all died in separate tragic incidents across 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>One man threw himself off a 10th floor balcony, Victoria Police Leading Senior Constable Duncan McKenzie told the Coroners Court of Victoria on Wednesday. </p>

<p>A second man was restrained by concerned friends for 20 minutes before he stopped breathing, with another unable to recall his name in the hours before his passing. </p>

<p>A fourth man fatally hit his head against a piece of furniture when having a seizure, with the fifth man dying due to a combination of brain damage and organ failure a few hours after he was taken to hospital.    </p>

<p>Dimitri Gerostamoulos, the chief toxicologist from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, told the court the substance the men all consumed was a deadly combination of two synthetic drugs: 25C-NBOMe, a hallucinogenic with similarities to LSD, and 4-Fluoroamphetamine, a stimulant similar to meth. </p>

<p>'When taken together, the deadly substances can destroy the body’s ability to flush them out,' he said.</p>

<p>'They also tend to stay longer in a person's system and further to that, can lead to cardiac arrest and brain damage.'</p>

<p>The purpose of the inquest is to find out what is widely known about the synthetic drug, from a local perspective as well as globally.</p>

<p>The inquest will also delve into ways to prevent a similar party drug resulting in more deaths, coroner Paresa Spanos said.</p>
