<p>Arg revealed he transformed his eating habits and lost two stone when he went on Jason Vale's retreat in Portugal in August after randomly bumping into the health and fitness guru, 51.  </p>

<p>The TV star told The Sun on Sunday: 'I met Jason on the off chance and he called my bluff when I said I'd book in. So the next day I bought my flights and flew to his resort in Portugal. All I drank for a fortnight was juices. </p>

<p>'I feel incredible and I'm determined to lose even more weight. I saw pictures of myself on the beach when lockdown ended and I came to Spain. I was shocked by how I looked. Now I just never want to go back to feeling that way.'  </p>

<p>'It was the best thing I've ever done. I've struggled with my weight for years but this has really changed my outlook. I'm free from drink and drugs still, which is a huge achievement. And making sure I lose weight and get healthier is an ongoing goal.' </p>

<p>The Essex native turned his life around and is continuing his recovery after he flew to Thailand earlier this year to go to rehab for his drug and drink addiction.  </p>

<p>Things for James haven't been as promising in the romance department as he broke up with his partner Gemma, 39, earlier his summer after she revealed a string of abusive messages, purportedly sent to her by him prior to their split.</p>

<p>It's understood the Jump star had made derogatory remarks abut her weight after she suggested that he had bought another woman dinner.  </p>

<p>The self-proclaimed diva decided to take some time off social media, citing that she was 'devastated' and 'heartbroken' by the exchange.</p>

<p>However after returning to the UK from her own Tenerife getaway, Gemma apologised to her former beau for releasing the messages.</p>
