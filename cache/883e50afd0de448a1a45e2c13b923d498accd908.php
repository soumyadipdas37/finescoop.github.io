<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman at the centre of the brutal drug-fuelled kidnapping of a former friend tried to silence the victim by offering him a lifetime supply of meth. </p>

<p>Shalia Merinda Higgins, 29, was angry at the victim when she called on a group of friends to bring him to her home in South Kalgoorlie, Western Australia in April last year. </p>

<p>The victim had allegedly stolen four bags of meth and trashed her home while she was in custody for unrelated reasons, The West Australian reported. </p>

<p>Her crew of offenders, including Tristen Taylah O'Dea, 24, and Mikayla Rae Cook - known as 'wildest woman of the west' - forced him to endure hours of torment before taking him to the home. </p>

<p>Cook filmed the violent kidnapping after the victim was ambushed by the group.</p>

<p>The disturbing vision showed the victim, who was choked and beaten, being dragged to the boot of a car owned by O'Dea.</p>

<p>O'Dea was heard shouting abuse at the victim, who was a former best friend. She walked away before two other offenders assaulted the victim. </p>

<p>Cook was also heard yelling behind the camera.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry bro, you f***ed with my family. You're done,' Cook said after the victim was dragged by his ankles into a backyard. </p>

<p>The victim had initially attempted to stand his ground by bracing himself with a hatchet. </p>

<p>But he dropped the object after another attacker charged at him.  </p>

<p>O'Dea and her other accomplices drove around with the victim in the car for some time before he was taken to Higgins.</p>

<p>The victim was able to escape the scene momentarily and call for help before he was confronted by Higgins. </p>

<p>He was then almost struck down by a brick that was thrown in his direction. </p>

<p>Higgins was jailed for 16 months following the kidnapping but for unrelated crimes.</p>

<p>While locked up, she called a friend and advised them to offer the victim a lifetime supply of meth if he dropped the charges.</p>

<p>The victim was kidnapped and forced into a car during the April 2 ordeal last year </p>

<p>O'Dea and Higgins faced the Kalgoorlie District Court in Western Australia on Thursday over the horrific attack on April 2, 2019. </p>

<p>Both women pleaded guilty to detaining another person with intent and Higgins also admitted to another charge of attempting to pervert justice.</p>

<p>The court heard how O'Dea has attempted to change her circumstances after finding herself disgusted by her own behaviour. </p>

<p>The court was told she plans to move away from the toxic environment to Perth. </p>

<p>Judge Gillian Braddock said the pair's offending was tied to the use of illicit drugs. </p>

<p>'This comes down to the effect a methamphetamine lifestyle leads to and the complete loss of perspective of normal human judgment of things,' she said.</p>

<p>Cook (pictured) and Tyler Lindsay, 19, kidnapped the man from his house in South Kalgoorlie, Western Australia in April last year</p>

<p>'In all circumstances it would be of greater interest to foster your rehabilitation than send you straight to jail.'</p>

<p>Judge Braddock considered Higgins 16-month jail sentence to be a penalty, despite the time being served for unrelated offences. </p>

<p>She slammed Higgins for attempting to get the victim to drop the charges by offering a lifetime supply of meth.</p>

<p>Judge Braddock said it was 'one of the stupidest attempts at perverting justice' she has ever seen. </p>

<p>The two women were handed a nine-month prison term suspended for two years.</p>

<p>Higgins was also given a 15-month term suspended for two years for attempting to pervert justice.</p>

<p>Co-offenders Cook, Jaydn Page and Tyler Lindsay were sentenced to various terms of immediate prison during an earlier hearing.</p>
