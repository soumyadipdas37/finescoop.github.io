<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victoria police are gearing up for another day of anti-lockdown protests as thousands vow to attend a 'Melbourne Freedom Walk' on Saturday.</p>

<p>The planned protest is set to kick off at the city's Tan walking track at 11am and has garnered around 1,500 responses from people saying they will attend online.</p>

<p>The march is believed to be the doing of sacked Clive Palmer political candidate and conspiracy theorist Tony Pecora, 43.</p>

<p>Mr Pecora was arrested by police after allegedly planning the event and charged with two counts of incitement.</p>

<p>The 'Freedom Walk' comes just one week after anti-lockdown protests erupted across the city with 17 demonstrators arrested and 160 fined.</p>

<p>Saturday's planned march comes just one week after protests erupted across the city with 17 arrested</p>

<p>The march is expected to kick off at 11am on Saturday at Melbourne's Tan walking track (pictured people walking the Tan last week)</p>

<p>Mr Pecora allegedly created the event on social media under the alias Arkwell Tripellego.</p>

<p>He believes the deadly coronavirus was 'genetically engineered by world banks to kill off weak humans'.</p>

<p>He then quoted Midnight Oil, allegedly telling police if someone contracted coronavirus at one of his events 'it would be better to die on your feet than live on your knees'. </p>

<p>Organisers say the event will be legal and only available for people who live within 5km of the Tan.</p>

<p>'Come together, get healthy and talk about getting our freedoms back,' the event says. </p>

<p>'Social distancing will be adhered to, along with facial coverings, and the aim is to remain walking so as not to create a conflict with police.' </p>

<p>The walk is expected to be replicated next week.</p>

<p>Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius (pictured) slammed anybody thinking about attending the march</p>

<p>On Friday, Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius unleashed on anybody thinking about attending the march and warned police would be out in full force. </p>

<p>'I feel a bit like a dog returning to eat his own vomit,' he said.</p>

<p>'I am incredibly frustrated. If people were less selfish and a bit more grown up, we wouldn't have to keep doing this.</p>

<p>'Don't take us for fools. We'll have no hesitation in issuing fines.' </p>

<p>Mr Cornelius said as well as the $1,652 fines, people could be charged in court and forced to pay up to $20,000. </p>

<p>Police clashed with thousands of protesters at the Shrine of Remembrance last Saturday</p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews also pleaded with people not to take part.</p>

<p>'All you're potentially doing is spreading the virus,' he said on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr Pecora was granted bail on Friday with conditions disallowing him from using social media or contacting other organisers.</p>

<p>Under Stage Four restrictions Melburnians can only leave their homes for exercise if they stay within five kilometres of their house and only for one hour.</p>

<p>They can exercise with one other person.</p>

<p>Last Saturday 'Freedom Day' protests erupted at the city's Shrine of Remembrance with police tackling demonstrators to the ground and dragging them away in handcuffs.</p>

<p>Thousands turned up to the protest - many without masks - but they were no match for the wall of police officers. </p>
