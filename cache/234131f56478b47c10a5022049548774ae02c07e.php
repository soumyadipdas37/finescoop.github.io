<p>The Geordie Shore star asked him if there was any truth to the fan theories that they were together but he bluntly replied: 'No, no, we're not.'  </p>

<p>But Vicky didn't back down, telling him that the pair would make the 'best couple'.</p>

<p>He replied: 'Yeah, potentially. We've never really thought about it like that, we're just super close mates.</p>

<p>'We like each other and the thing is, it's never been something that's crossed our minds and it wouldn't happen for the fact that we don't want to ruin our friendship.</p>

<p>'We don't see each other that way. We're platonic, as they say, platonic friends.'  </p>

<p>Maura had previously been dating Curtis Pritchard, who she split from in March, while Chris was most recently in a relationship with Harley Brash. </p>
