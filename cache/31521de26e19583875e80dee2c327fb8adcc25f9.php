<p>Young love: Despite a 13-year age difference Megan fell for Brian immediately when they met on the set of Hope and Faith in 2004</p>

<p>Brian and Megan have had a rocky relationship over the years with a lot of ups and downs over the course of their 14-year romance.</p>

<p>The pair first got together in 2004 after meeting on the set of Hope and Faith. They immediately started dating and tied the knot in 2010. </p>

<p>They then separated in 2015 with Fox filing for divorce. Eight months later she announced her third pregnancy and confirmed it was Green's child as the couple got back together in the summer of 2016.</p>

<p>Family affair: Brian and Megan are pictured with their three children Bodhi, six, Noah, seven, and Journey, four, at disneyland last October </p>

<p>In April 2019, Fox filed to dismiss her 2015 divorce case against Green. A year later the two were rumored to be living separately with Megan confirming that she had filed for divorce.  </p>

<p>Brian and ex-fiancee Vanessa were partnered up until 2003. A bitter 12 year court battle ensued in 2006 as the former pair had a custody fight over their now 18-year-old son Kassius. </p>

<p>Things got ugly when Brian then sued Vanessa in 2012 claiming he had 'lent her' $200K that she had never paid back but the case was eventually thrown out as the statute of limitation expired. </p>

<p>Kassius: Vanessa poses for a selfie with 18-year-old Kassius with whom she shares with Green even though they had a nasty custody battle that resulted with Green allegedly cutting him out of his life in 2013</p>

<p>Mending ties: According to Vanessa, Brian had reportedly not allowed their son to mingle with the family he and Fox built together as they had allegedly not seen him for over five years; May 2020</p>

<p>In 2018 Vanessa hit back in defense of her son claiming that Green and Fox had not seen their son in over 5 years as she claimed Kassius had 'never met his youngest brother and is not allowed to know where his father, stepmother and three younger brothers live.'</p>

<p>Vanessa took to social media to talk candidly about her ex Green as she shared Instagram screenshots of her engaging with fans relative to their past issues. </p>

<p>She ultimately came out in support of Megan as she said she was happy Megan was 'living her life for herself' and that that was a 'gift to her children.' </p>

<p>DM drama: Vanessa Marcil the ex-fiancee of BAG with whom she shares a son, engaged with fans on social media about Green and his character amid their past custody battle</p>

<p>When a fan accused Vanessa of 'always speaking poorly' about Green, she wrote:</p>

<p>'I speak with empathy regarding Kassius' dad considering the complete devastation that my son went through. My son and my family will tell you the same. I've had a rule all through our 13-year court case in my family that 'no one is ever to say a bad word about Kass' dad.'  </p>

<p>Megan filed for divorce in May 2020 from Green and immediately moved on with Machine Gun Kelly, her Midnight in the Switchgrass costar.  </p>

<p>Megan described MGK as her 'twin flame' on an episode of Bravo star LaLa Kent's podcast and the two were seen getting matching tattoos. </p>

<p>Twin flame: Megan has described MGK as her twin flame. The two reportedly had electric chemistry when they first met on set of Midnight in the Switchgrass before production stopped down due to the pandemic</p>

<p>Moving on: Green has been linked to Tina Louise since the pair were spotted out in July. The pair were seen on the beach together last week after reports that their romance had fizzled </p>

<p>Since their split, Green has also been back in the dating game. </p>

<p>He was first linked to Courtney Stodden before photos of he and Tina Louise surfaced only a few months ago. The two have been an item since they were first seen out together in July. </p>

<p>The pair had allegedly called it quits but were spotted out together on the beach last week making it seem as if they have reconciled. </p>

<p>Currently Green is focusing on his family and the three little children he shares with his estranged wife Bodhi, six, Noah, seven, and Journey, four. </p>
