<p>First family outing! Nikki Bell and fiancé Artem Chigvintsev were seen for the first time since welcoming their baby boy Matteo Artemovich on Wednesday, out in LA a little over a month since his birth</p>

<p>Nikki was dressed for comfort, covering up in a fitted camisole with dainty lace trim. She wrapped a jacket around her waist and donned classic black leggings on bottom.</p>

<p>The reality star kept a pair on sunglasses perched on her head while keeping her face mask below her chin for most of the outing.</p>

<p>Adding a designer touch, the older Bella twin wore a pair of Yeezy Boost 700 Wave Runner sneakers in the classic blue/grey colorway.</p>

<p>Artem went for casual cool in a distressed, faded blue tee shirt and fitted jeans.</p>

<p>Hands full: Bella and Chigvintsev were out after the raven haired twin told People she's been stuck at home alone with Matteo while her other half gets back to work on the ABC celeb dancing competition</p>

<p>Workout wear: Nikki was dressed for comfort, covering up in a fitted camisole with dainty lace trim</p>

<p>During their outing they shaded little Matteo from the sun, covering his carriage with a light blanket.</p>

<p>Their route took them past some of the nearby shops before the new family headed back home. </p>

<p>While Nikki had Artem at her side for most of the walk, she was seen strolling solo at one point.</p>

<p>And it seems the future Mrs. Chigvintsev is adapting to the one-on-one time with her baby boy, telling listeners of her and sister Brie's podcast she's been on her own since Artem began rehearsals for next season of Dancing With The Stars.</p>
