<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A fitness trainer diagnosed with 'unexplained infertility' before giving birth to  quadruplets has opened up on her battle to conceive - and being told to terminate one or all of the unborn babies.</p>

<p>Western Australian couple Natalie, 31, and Kahn, 34, conceived their 'COVID' quadruplets late last year.</p>

<p>Their family more than doubled from three to seven when Maioha Kahn (2.3kg), Frankee Gene (1.92kg), Marley Rose (2.2kg) and Maddison Grace (2.1kg) made their entrance to the world on July 21 at 34 weeks. </p>

<p>The premature newborns were ready to go home within four weeks to join their big sister Kiana (aka Kiki), 2. </p>

<p>Six weeks on, their parents are besotted with their bundles of joy, despite the countless sleepless nights and endless dirty nappies.</p>

<p>Natalie gave birth to her miracle quadruplets- a boy and three girls via C-section in July</p>

<p>'It's pretty amazing seeing them all out now, and it's made it feel pretty real,' Natalie  told A Current Affair </p>

<p>Her husband added: 'It's about as hard as I was thinking it would be. </p>

<p>'It's just poo. I've got a two-year-old daughter so it's the fact of being a parent. Sometimes you get a bit of poo under your fingernail. But you just wash your hands and move onto the next one!'</p>

<p>On average just two sets of quadruplets are born in Australia each year.  </p>

<p>Natalie was diagnosed with an 'unexplained infertility' called anovulation and spent three years trying to conceive by injecting hormones to stimulate regular ovulation.</p>

<p>Natalie and Kahn welcomed their first child Kiana (pictured together) in 2018</p>

<p>Natalie's growing baby bump took a toll on the fitness trainer's frame (pictured at 26 weeks)</p>

<p>The couple finally welcomed their first child Kiana in 2018, but got more than they bargained for when they began the process again a year later. </p>

<p>She shared her pregnancy journey on a dedicated Instagram page Kiki and the Quads, which has grown to 22,000 followers.</p>

<p>Natalie found out she was pregnant on New Years Eve and earlier this year, recalled the moment she learned there were four babies growing inside her. </p>

<p>'I was certain I was having twins,' she posted on Instagram. </p>

<p>'One, I was feeling really sick very early and two, twins run in my family!</p>

<p>'We went from crying to laughing and laughing to crying.</p>

<p>'Kahn and I drove home in utter shock! We were overwhelmed, scared, excited, confused, nervous and speechless!'</p>

<p>The couple say their family is now complete with arrival of Maioha (right), Frankee (left), Maddison and Marley (centre)</p>

<p>Natalie initially thought she was pregnant with twins after she found out she was pregnant on New Years Eve. Pictured is an ultrasound of her four babies</p>

<p>She described the heartache of being advised by medical professionals to terminate one or all of the babies to reduce to risk of complications.</p>

<p>She admitted she considered the option multifetal pregnancy reduction of terminating at least one of the four.</p>

<p>'But my heart was telling me different,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'What happens if we keep all four and they end up with a health problem or a disability - will I blame myself?</p>

<p>'What happens if we choose to reduce to two babies to give them the best chance of a healthy start to life and the procedure causes me to miscarry all of them?</p>

<p>'What happens if we end up losing all of them because we chose to go ahead with quadruplets, but maybe if we had of reduced we would have two healthy babies?</p>

<p>'SO many questions, SO many scenarios, SO many emotions going through my head.</p>

<p>'It was beyond emotional and all I remember saying to Kahn was that I want someone to just make a decisions for me!'</p>

<p>The couple decided to give their daughter a sibling but got more they bargained for</p>

<p>Kahn and Natalie at 29 weeks, five weeks before they welcomed the birth of their babies</p>

<p>Natalie eventually decided to continue with the pregnancy as planned and pray for the best outcome.</p>

<p>The fitness trainer continued working out until she was 24 weeks as her growing baby bump took a heavy strain on her tiny frame.</p>

<p>Natalie was eventually confined to a wheelchair on family outings. </p>

<p>'I haven't sugar coated the fact this pregnancy hasn't been super enjoyable,' she posted at 30 weeks.</p>

<p>'Yes I am blessed to be pregnant...four times blessed! But it's also felt four times harder!</p>

<p>'I have however enjoyed the many journeys this pregnancy has taken me through both physically and emotionally!</p>

<p>'There has been many highs and lows and this is just the beginning. The beginning of a lifetime of highs and lows! </p>

<p>'What I do know is, I already love these four babies so much and we have an amazing support network around us that will love them too!'</p>

<p>Natalie (pictured with her husband) shared her pregnancy journey rollercoaster on Instagram page Kiki and the Quads</p>

<p>Kahn was banned from accompanying his wife on ultrasound appointments in the second half of the pregnancy due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>Originally from the Pilbara region, they moved to Perth in May due to the risk of third trimester complications and have since relocated to Bunbury. </p>

<p>'I felt a bit sorry for Kahn because he wasn't allowed into any of my scans throughout the bulk of the pregnancy so that was a little bit of a shame for him and made him feel a little bit disconnected,' Natalie told the program.</p>

<p>Quadruplets are usually delivered at 30 weeks but Natalie's doctor believe they could cope with an extra month inside.</p>

<p>'We got to the 32-week mark, and he was like, 'I think you can probably make it to 34,' and I cried that I had to go longer,' Natalie said.</p>

<p>'I was so devastated because I was so uncomfortable.'</p>

<p>'But looking at them now, I'm so glad he pushed me that little bit further, when I was emotional, and didn't give in because they're amazing.'</p>

<p>The couple's family grew from three to seven overnight with the arrival of quadruplets</p>

<p>The couple took three years to conceive their first child after Natalie was diagnosed with 'unexplained infertility'</p>

<p>The couple said their family is now complete and are unfazed about the challenging road ahead of them.</p>

<p>'When they're Kiana's age and they're two and they get strong personalities and they might not want to get dressed or eat what you feed them or get in the car to go somewhere, I think that is going to be tough because we've got five on the move trying to go places,' Natalie said. </p>

<p>'I look at our daughter and if these four give us the love she gives us it's going be amazing.' </p>
