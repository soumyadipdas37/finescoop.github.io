<p>'I met my fiancé in March and I fell in love with him. We've had this whirlwind romance and have been able to spend this time together,' Demi (born Demetria) told Vogue last week.</p>

<p>'I knew that I wanted to learn something from this time that could actually better my life, my mental health and my emotional wellbeing in the long term. Initially I was resistant, but because my fiancé is so positive all the time, I just started picking up on the things he does. I started meditating and doing yoga. I started journaling, painting, taking pictures and being creative, and learning to appreciate nature, after realizing I'd been taking it for granted all this time.'</p>
