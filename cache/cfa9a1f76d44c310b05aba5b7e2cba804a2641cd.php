<p>He had to close an hour earlier than the usual 8pm because they ran out of stock, which was being frequently topped up throughout the day.</p>

<p>Giselle stopped by to help at one point and says there were about 100 customers during her shift.</p>

<p>'There were so many people, and [my dad] was kind of shocked because he didn't think there would be a turn around that quickly,' Giselle said.</p>
