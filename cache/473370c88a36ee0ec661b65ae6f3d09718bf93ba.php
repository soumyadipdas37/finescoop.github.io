<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds United are in talks with Udinese over a deal for £30million rated Rodrigo de Paul.</p>

<p>The Argentina international is a skilful attacking midfielder with an eye for a pass and has drawn enquiries from both Milan clubs.</p>

<p>However, he is tempted by the prospect of playing in the Premier League for compatriot Marcelo Bielsa and Leeds are negotiating to try and agree a fee for the 26-year old.</p>

<p>Leeds United have opened in talks to sign Udinese midfielder Rodrigo De Paul this summer</p>

<p>The 26-year-old was previously linked with Juventus and could demand a fee of £27million </p>

<p>Leeds signed defender Robin Koch from Freiburg and forward Rodrigo from Valencia over the weekend and would still like to add two more.  </p>

<p>De Paul managed seven goals and seven assists in all competitions last season and netted nine times in the previous campaign.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old can play any of the midfield roles and would offer Bielsa's side versatility.</p>

<p>De Paul has 17 caps for Argentina and is capable of playing anywhere across the midfield</p>

<p>He also has 17 caps for Argentina but is yet to score his first international goal.</p>

<p>Leeds have been busy in the transfer market with the club determined to ensure they remain in the top flight after a 16-year wait to return.</p>

<p>As well as Rodrigo and Koch, the club have added several promising youngsters including Sam Greenwood, Dani van den Hueval, Charlie Allen, Cody Drameh and Joe Gelhardt.</p>
