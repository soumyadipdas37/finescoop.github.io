<p>In an Instagram post at the time, she shared her water birthing experience and said she had always wanted to stay at home for as long as possible before going to the hospital.</p>

<p>'I laboured at home from 1am until 7am, and then that's when my midwife said that I should come in [to the hospital].'</p>

<p>Amy said she 'chose not to know' how dilated she was during the labour, because she didn't want to get 'disheartened' if she still had a long way to go.</p>
