<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Suarez has been captured leaving Barcelona's training ground in tears as he closes in on a move to Atletico Madrid. </p>

<p>The Uruguayan said goodbye to his teammates on Wednesday and is expected in the next few hours to be confirmed as the latest star to leave the Camp Nou in a £3.7m deal.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old - who will leave Barcelona as the club's third highest goalscorer of all time - was then captured shedding tears as he briefly put his head down while he drove out of the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper facilities.</p>

<p>Since moving to Barcelona from Liverpool in 2014, Suarez has netted a remarkable 197 times in 283 appearances and the club are expected to make a farewell gesture to the striker on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan will sign for two seasons with Madrid, who after Tuesday's deal have agreed to pay just under £4m for each of the two seasons for which the Uruguayan will sign for.</p>

<p>However - much to the relief of Ronald Koeman who is against the clock to bring in fresh faces to the Camp Nou - Suarez' tears appear to signal the end of yet another transfer saga at the Catalan side this summer.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, it was reported that Barcelona were attempting to put the brakes on Atletico's move for Suarez by adding their rivals to a list of 'vetoed clubs' he can't join, alongside rivals Real Madrid, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.</p>

<p>Suarez has netted a remarkable 197 times in 283 appearances since joining from Liverpool</p>

<p>But Atletico have emerged as the front-runners for Suarez's signature after a move to Juventus fell through.</p>

<p>Suarez flew to Perugia, Italy, last week and passed a dual citizenship test in order to speed up his move to the Serie A giants.</p>

<p>But that deal collapsed and Suarez could now find himself in hot water after claims by Repubblica and Ansa that there were 'irregularities' in the test. </p>

<p>It has been reported that Suarez was sent the questions in advance and passed the Italian language (B1 level) exam having already been told the answers, with an investigation by the Guardia di Finanza now underway.</p>

<p>But he is now set to line up for Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid in LaLiga next season</p>

<p>The police are now said to be acquiring documentation from the University of Perugia, where Suarez's test took place, and the player risks heavy legal action by the Public Prosecutor of Perugia.</p>

<p>Spanish giants Barcelona meanwhile have been in a state of crisis this summer amid the coronavirus crisis crippling their finances while they were left to pick up the pieces following the huge fall-out from the Lionel Messi transfer saga. </p>

<p>But after board members were divided on the Messi issues, there has been a significant split in the Barcelona boardroom over the club's choice to allow the experienced striker Suarez to join their La Liga rivals, according to Onda Cero.  </p>
