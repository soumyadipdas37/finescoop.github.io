<p>Aldi Australia is set to bring back its sell-out $19.99 Lacura caviar-infused moisturiser that rivals a high-end brand costing $745</p>

<p>The best-selling Lacura caviar skincare range will return to shelves on Saturday, September 19 for a limited time only as part of the retailer's Special Buys sale</p>

<p>The cream has been described by reviewers as both 'very moisturising without that greasy feeling' and 'gliding on like a dream'.</p>

<p>The day moisturiser can keep your skin hydrated under makeup while the night cream provides intense nourishment and enhances regeneration in your sleep.</p>

<p>'In my experience, it works incredibly well. I had a deep wrinkle between my eyes. I'm amazed how much it's reduced since using the day and night creams... At least 80 per cent reduction, no exaggeration,' one shopper said.</p>

<p>Another reviewer added: 'I've been using these creams for over three years and just love them! They are reasonably priced and make my drier skin so hydrated. Who says good skincare needs to be expensive?'</p>

<p>One beauty blogger shared her glowing review on how the budget night cream compares to the luxury alternative.</p>

<p>'I've had the opportunity to use La Prairie moisturisers and eye creams and they are beautiful however ridiculously expensive,' she wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>'So when I was wandering through Aldi, I stocked up on the Lacura Caviar Illumination night cream which I had read many rave reviews about. I paid $19 for this product and it is hands down one of the best night moisturisers I've ever used.</p>

<p>'It's definitely doing good things to my skin. In my opinion this is perfect for normal, dry or combo skin and it's super affordable. Definitely keep your eyes peeled for when it's next in Aldi but stock up quick, they fly off the shelves.' </p>

<p>Other items from the budget beauty range to go on sale include the $14.99 eye mousse, $14.99 anti-aging intensive serum and the seven-day intensive treatment for day and night</p>

<p>The in-house beauty range has been a huge hit among shoppers around the country, with many revealing over the years the products were sold out at their stores from 30 seconds to seven minutes.</p>

<p>'I witnessed this first hand myself, where the entire shelf was emptied in the first six minutes of the store opening. It's crazy how this product is so insanely popular,' one shopper said.</p>

<p>Every time the skincare range re-launches in stores, hundreds of shoppers race to get their hands on the products, with some claiming they have seen shoppers bulk buying boxes of the face creams, while others have had to fight the huge crowds.</p>

<p>In recent years, savvy sellers have attempted to turn the budget skincare boxes into a lucrative business by listing them on eBay for hundreds of dollars more </p>

<p>'One certain lady cleared them all! All the creams in her trolley, I counted well over 20 boxes! There's no way I believe she kept them for herself... makes me mad, people are so selfish,' one shopper witnessed.</p>

<p>Another customer claimed: 'Lined up from 7.45am - first one there. I wanted the skincare range. Got shoved and pushed into the wire, the best was someone trying to pull down my pants! Did not get day cream... Some old duck pushed and shoved and took the day cream out of my hands.'  </p>
