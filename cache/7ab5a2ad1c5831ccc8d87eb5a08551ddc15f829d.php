<p>Yay: Yazmin shimmied in a Christian Dior swimsuit as a doting James captured some racy snaps of her by the sea</p>

<p>This comes after she and James confirmed they had rekindled their relationship while shooting scenes for the new series of TOWIE in South Woodford, east London.</p>

<p>A week earlier, they were seen putting on a cosy display during filming for their show, hugging and giggling as they attended a food festival in Chelmsford, Essex.</p>

<p>Days before that, Yazmin and James did little to dispel rumours they had rekindled their relationship as they enjoyed dinner together at Sexy Fish in London's Mayfair. </p>

<p>PDA: The couple looked smitten as they embraced and kissed during the day</p>

<p>Toned: The star showed off her bronzed legs and peachy posterior in the blue and white swimsuit</p>

<p>Pose: James displayed his own hunky frame in a pair of grey swimming trunks</p>

<p>Close: The pair held hands as they strolled by the beach during their trip</p>

<p>Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted in June, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun at the time: 'They're not officially back together but they're getting closer and everyone around them wouldn't be surprised if they got back together.</p>

<p>'They're getting along really well and sparks are flying – it's like the old days. They're on holiday with a large group of people but they're really reconnecting.'</p>

<p>Look of love: The pair stared into one another's eyes as they walked down the beach </p>

<p>Chat: This comes after she and James confirmed they had rekindled their relationship while shooting scenes for the new series of TOWIE in South Woodford, east London</p>
