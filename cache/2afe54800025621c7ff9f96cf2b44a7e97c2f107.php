<p>MailOnline has been experiencing technical difficulties that resulted yesterday in readers being unable to submit and read comments. We identified this as a hardware failure and have now replaced the relevant piece of equipment.</p>

<p>However, we are aware that there is an intermittent fault with comments still not appearing on some stories.</p>

<p>Please bear with us while we fix the remaining issues.</p>

<p>We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.</p>
