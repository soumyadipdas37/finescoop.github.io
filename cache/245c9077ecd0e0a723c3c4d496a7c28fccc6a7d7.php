<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nearly 500 New York police officers have suffered horrific injuries in riots and protests this summer.</p>

<p>Cops have been shot at, hit with bricks, bottles and Molotov cocktails, hit by cars and stabbed amid a spate of unrest.</p>

<p>Department data shows at least 472 officers have been injured when responding to protests since May 28, with 319 requiring hospital treatment.</p>

<p>NYPD Lt. Richard Mack, who was attacked by a group of protesters in June, is among nearly 500 New York police officers who have been injured in riots and protests this summer</p>

<p>Patrick Lynch, the head of the Police Benevolent Association, told The Washington Examiner: 'The chaos that politicians are encouraging on the streets is putting cops in the hospital. </p>

<p>'It is not just the nearly 500 cops who have been hit with bricks and bottles or otherwise injured during supposedly 'peaceful' protests.</p>

<p>'Hundreds more are being injured because criminals are emboldened to fight cops the moment we step on the scene. They know our hands are tied.' </p>

<p>New York City Police Department Sgt. Joseph Imperatrice, who founded Blue Lives Matter NYC, told the New York Post: 'The average person doesn't hear about the daily assaults and injuries to police officers.</p>

<p>'Officers are hurt every single day whether in regards to being assigned to routine patrol or a riot location.'</p>

<p>The sergeant has even witnessed some of the violent attacks, seeing protesters throw rocks and bricks at officers on the front line.</p>
