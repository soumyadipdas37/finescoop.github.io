<p>The reality show was the brainchild of Kris and TV host and producer Ryan Seacrest, and followed the lives of Kris' family, which included Caitlyn - then Bruce - along with daughters Kendall and Kylie, and Kris' four children from her marriage to the late Robert Kardashian, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob.</p>

<p>At the beginning, it was Bruce who was the celebrity given his fame as a gold medalist in the decathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada. </p>

<p>But in the intervening 13 years, he has been eclipsed by the phenomenal popularity of the Kardashian-Jenner siblings, who turned their family's fame into a multi-million dollar empire.</p>

<p>Over: Caitlyn praised ex-wife Kris Jenner and their family for putting on a great show, calling Keeping Up With The Kardashians 'probably the greatest reality show in history'</p>
