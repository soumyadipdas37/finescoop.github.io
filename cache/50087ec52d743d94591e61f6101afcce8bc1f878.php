<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Doris Day’s dog-friendly California home has gone on the market more than a year after death for $7.4million.</p>

<p>The nine-acre property is in Carmel Valley near Monterey, where Day relocated around 1980 after worrying that she could run afoul of Beverly Hills laws which restricted how many pets she could have on her property.</p>

<p>‘The Man Who Knew Too Much’ actress has fallen in love with the neighborhood, which celebrities such as Clint Eastwood also call home, while she was filming ‘Julie’ in the area in 1956.</p>

<p>Living in the home for almost four decades, the main house is painted butter-yellow, her favorite color, and former neighbors says it was once full of tens of rescue dogs Day would take in. </p>

<p>Doris Day had most of the property painted her favorite color butter yellow but would use bright red for a burst of color</p>

<p>The bedrooms featured loft ceilings with their own living space. Day expanded the main house into a three bedroom</p>

<p>Day moved into the Carmel Valley home after the cancellation of 'The Doris Say Show' but she brought antiques from the set </p>

<p>The main bedroom features its own living room and a fireplace. Day lived here for almost four decades</p>

<p>Proceeds from the sale of the home are set to go to the late actress’s animal foundation, which is currently working to support the rescue of animals from the California wildfires.</p>

<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, Day was such as massive fan of dogs that her rescues even had their own kitchen in the house, where she would make them her prized turkey meatloaf sandwiches.</p>

<p>There was also space for their dog beds, which were wrapped in Ralph Lauren sheets.</p>

<p>Day, one of the biggest movie stars of the 19050s and 60s, moved into the home with her fourth husband, Barry Comden, a maître d'. The couple divorced in 1982.</p>

<p>They expanded the property into a 7,000 sq. ft three-bedroom with Day painting both the main house and the one-bedroom guest house in her signature butter yellow. </p>

<p>In contrast, the gate house with two apartments is painted a bright red, which Day is said to have chosen as her go-to decorative color.</p>

<p>Inside the main house, the classic actress went for neutral-tone furniture and simplistic designs.</p>

<p>Although she moved in years after her sitcom ‘The Doris Day Show’ was canceled, she brought with her antique furniture she had picked out for the set and paired them with plain linen sofas.</p>

<p>The property has now been put on the market for $7.4million more than a year after Day's death</p>

<p> The property is 7,000sq ft and Day considered it a haven for her and her rescue dogs</p>

<p>The property sits at the top of a knoll overlooking Carmel Valley where Clint Eastwood also calls home</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that she would often paint over the antiques to make them cream, most likely reducing their value but making them fit in better with her bright and plain décor.</p>

<p>The house offers a view over the adjacent golf club, sitting on a knoll overlooking Carmel Valley with a carefully manicured patio area outside.</p>

<p>The bedrooms feature lofty ceilings, all in line with Day's neutral palette. </p>

<p>One of the bedrooms has its own living space and a fireplace, with other cozy reading nooks spotted around the property. </p>

<p>The main living room also features a majestic stone fireplace which can be looked down upon from the first floor.   </p>

<p>The home was a haven for Day who could take in all the rescue dogs she desired, although not without complaints from some neighbors about the barking.</p>

<p>Day's possessions were sold at auction in April. They brought in $3million</p>

<p>The exterior is also painted a butter yellow as it was the late actress's favorite </p>

<p>Day's possessions were put in display in the beautiful house before they were sold earlier this year</p>

<p>Pictured some of the items that were sold at auction after Day died in May 2019 of pneumonia, aged 97</p>

<p>Her love of the animal started early when her dog Tiny stayed by her side after a car accident in 1937 injured her leg and paused her dancing career.</p>

<p>Her friend Bob Bashara, now chief executive of her animal foundation, told the Wall Street Journal he only ever remembers seeing 10 to 12 dogs on the property, but former neighbor Doug Steiny said he remembers as many as 50 at its height.</p>

<p>Steiny, now a listing agent, was friends with Day’s son Terry Melcher and remembers how his mom would be unhappy at the noise of that many animals.</p>

<p>'The dogs would bark like crazy, and my mom would get all mad. I’d call Terry and say, "Our moms are fighting again",' he said.</p>

<p>Day used bursts of red throughout the house as her 'decorative color'</p>

<p>Outside, the stone walkways are beautifully manicured. The house looks over a local golfcourse</p>

<p>The nine-acre property is in Carmel Valley near Monterey, where Day relocated around 1980</p>

<p>The ‘Calamity Jane’ star died of pneumonia aged 97 in May 2019 and her possessions remaining in the house were auctioned off earlier this year.</p>

<p>The items were displayed in the home and Beverly Hills-based Julien’s Auctions said they brought in about $3million in April.</p>

<p>Among them was a painting by singer Tony Bennett, a dress Day wore to the 1989 Golden Globes, a yellow vase given to her by Paul McCartney, and a landscape of a country lane that friends said reminded Day of where she grew up in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Steiny is now listing the property with his wife Lisa with Sotheby’s International Realty and expects that there will be a lot of demand, thanks to both its celebrity status and the uptick in tech workers moving to the area as a result of working from home during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
