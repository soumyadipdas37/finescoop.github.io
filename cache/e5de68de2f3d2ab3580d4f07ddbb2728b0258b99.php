<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Almost two million cases of coronavirus were diagnosed across the world last week — the highest total since the pandemic began as outbreaks across Europe continue to accelerate. </p>

<p>World Health Organization (WHO) figures show 1,998,897 infections were registered in the seven-day spell ending September 20. Almost a third (650,000) were in India.</p>

<p>The total marks a six per cent rise in a week, up from 1.84million, and is 'the highest number of reported cases in a single week since the beginning of the epidemic', the UN agency said.</p>

<p>But weekly deaths have yet to spike in line, sticking to around the 40,000 mark ever since they topped 51,000 during the darkest days of the crisis in April.</p>

<p>Experts say this is down to testing picking up more cases, doctors being better able to treat the disease and younger people — who aren't as vulnerable to Covid-19 — driving flare-ups in Europe.  </p>

<p>The data from the WHO, World Health Organization, relates to Covid-19 cases diagnosed between September 14 and 20.</p>

<p>Since the coronavirus first surfaced in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, it has infected almost 31million people around the globe.</p>

<p>Data also shows it has killed nearly 960,000, according to the WHO. More than half of the deaths have occurred in North and South America.</p>

<p>The US — which has diagnosed 6.6million cases itself since the virus first landed on American soil — has seen almost 200,000 deaths. </p>

<p>Nearly every regions of the world saw new cases rise last week, with Europe and the Americas seeing new cases swell by 11 and 10 per cent, respectively.</p>

<p>Only Africa, which has remained relatively unscathed by the pandemic, dodged the upward trend, reporting a 12 per cent drop in fresh cases from a week earlier.</p>

<p>Even as cases shot up across much of the world, the number of new deaths is going down, the WHO statistics showed. </p>

<p>Last week, 37,700 deaths linked to the virus were recorded across the world, marking a decline of 10 per cent compared to the previous week.</p>

<p>The decline was driven by the Americas, where new deaths were 22 per cent lower than a week earlier, and by Africa where new deaths dropped 16 per cent.</p>

<p>The clear drop in deaths in the Americas region were driven mainly by decreases in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Bolivia.</p>

<p>The US and Brazil, the second-worst hit nation, continued to report the most deaths, each reporting over 5,000 new deaths in the past week.</p>

<p>Europe, some of which is experiencing a second wave of infections, meanwhile saw its new death count shoot up to over 4,000 for the seven-day period.</p>
