<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester City have stepped up negotiations with Sevilla for their French centre back Jules Kounde.</p>

<p>Sevilla had rejected City’s opening offer and warned that they would need to pay the £82million buy out clause.</p>

<p>However, Kounde is interested in a move to City and Sevilla are now considering whether to sell for a compromise fee.</p>

<p>Manchester City have stepped up their interest in Sevilla's French defender Jules Kounde</p>

<p>City have discussed a £46m offer while Nicolas Otamendi has been mentioned as makeweight</p>

<p>City have discussed a £46million offer while Nicolas Otamendi has been mentioned as a potential makeweight in any deal for the 21-year-old Kounde who only joined Sevilla from Bordeaux for £21m last summer.</p>

<p>Though he is a crucial part of their team, such a large profit made within 14 months of him joining may ultimately prove hard to resist.</p>

<p>Sources in Sevilla say though that would normally make good business sense, they recognise Kounde’s potential is huge after a stand out first season and they would push for more than £50m.</p>

<p>Sources in Sevilla believe, despite interest in Kounde, Jose Gimenez remains their priority</p>

<p>City had turned to the highly rated Kounde amid high valuations for Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly and Jose Gimenez of Atletico Madrid.</p>

<p>Despite their intensifying interested in Kounde, it is understood Gimenez is still considered City's priority.</p>

<p>The sources indicate that it is unlikely a deal will be done before Sevilla's Super Cup clash against Bayern Munich on Thursday.</p>
