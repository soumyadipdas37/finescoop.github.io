<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ant &amp; Dec, who have hosted I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! since 2002, have admitted they disliked the show's name when they first heard it.</p>

<p>Chatting on Radio 2, the hosting duo - both 44 - explained what they thought when they were first approached.</p>

<p>'The producers came in, they explained, "So, we're going to get these celebrities, we're going to put them in a jungle, we're going to make them face their fears and do trials and stuff",' Ant recalled.</p>

<p>What's in a name? Ant &amp; Dec, I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! hosts, have admitted they disliked the show's name when they first heard it</p>

<p>'And we were like, "Well, this all sounds good, a bit like Big Brother and it's a bit like other things, and they're putting it all together. What's it called?"</p>

<p>'And they said, "I'm a Celebrity . . . Get Me Out of Here!"'</p>

<p>Dec said: 'We both looked at each other and we were like, "Well that's awful, isn't it?"'</p>

<p>Ant continued: 'What a terrible title. We were like, "Yeah we'll do it, but the title will change, obviously"</p>

<p>'Awful!' 'What a terrible title. We were like, "Yeah we'll do it, but the title will change, obviously,"' Ant admitted</p>

<p>Dec said: 'We both looked at each other and we were like, "Well that's awful, isn't it?"'</p>

<p>'Two years later, it hasn't changed and it's a huge show.'</p>

<p>The duo - who have been reflecting on their 30-year career ahead of their forthcoming book - were appearing on My Life In A Mixtape, and selected Coldplay track In My Place to reflect on the start of I'm A Celeb...</p>

<p>'The first series wasn't an altogether pleasurable experience,' Dec recalled. 'We were halfway through the series. We didn't really know what we were doing.</p>

<p>'Coldplay had just released their second album, A Rush Of Blood To The Head, and this was one of the tracks on it.</p>

<p>'And in the middle of it there was a line that really summed up how we were feeling — "I was scared, I was scared, tired and underprepared".'</p>

<p>Back then: They have fronted the show since 2002</p>

<p>On reflection: The duo - who have been reflecting on their 30-year career ahead of their forthcoming book - were appearing on My Life In A Mixtape, and selected Coldplay track In My Place to reflect on the start of I'm A Celeb... </p>

<p>This comes amid reports the show's live final date has been moved to avoid a clash with Strictly Come Dancing.</p>

<p>ITV are said to be taking the steps to ensure the upcoming 20th season of the long-running show is a success and to avoid a ratings war.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'The autumn TV schedule is packed with content as people spend cold evenings on the sofa in front of the box.</p>

<p>'So I'm A Celeb bosses have pushed for the final to be on a Friday night for the first time so they don't have to share audiences with Strictly and can dominate the viewers. </p>

<p>'ITV has ploughed close to £1million into the series and want to make it a success. So they aren't taking any chances.' </p>

<p>TV gold: The new season of Strictly is due to kick off on BBC One in October while the upcoming series of I'm A Celeb is due to begin airing on ITV1 around the same time</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted ITV for comment. </p>

<p>This year the first ever UK-based series will be filmed at the 200-year-old Gwrych Castle in Abergele, North Wales instead of in Australia. </p>

<p>The new season of Strictly is due to kick off on BBC One in October while the upcoming series of I'm A Celeb is due to begin airing on ITV1 around the same time.</p>

<p>The hit ITV series is continuing work getting the Welsh location ready for a handful of brave celebrities who will be forced to endure freezing 8°C cold temperatures and no protection from the elements. </p>

<p>Exciting! This year the first ever UK-based series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! will be filmed at the 200-year-old Gwrych Castle in Abergele, North Wales instead of in Australia</p>

<p>It won't be an easy three weeks for the celebrities taking part as they forced to sleep in gruelling November temperatures in the roofless castle - throwing the famous shower scenes in question - and there could also be the setting for some paranormal activity, as the castle has earned a reputation for being haunted. </p>

<p>As ever hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, who revealed they are being tested for Covid-19 every four days in order to host the show, will present the new series with celebrities completing an array of challenges to win food and drink for the camp, with one eventually being crowned King or Queen of the Castle. </p>

<p>Gwrych Castle is nestled in a tree lined hillside overlooking the Irish Sea, and is spread across 250 acres of gardens and grounds, with an array of picturesque turrets, alcoves and grounds. </p>

<p>Already rumours are rife about who could be taking part this year, with stars including Vernon Kay, AJ Pritchard, Selling Sunset's Christine Quinn and Tamzin Outhwaite all reported to be in talks with show bosses.  </p>

<p>Despite all the changes, it has been suggested that relocating to Wales could save ITV a considerable amount of money, which could then be used to get bigger-name stars.</p>

<p>Although the broadcaster will still have to convince them that spending three weeks in the cold countryside is as doable as three weeks in Australia. </p>
