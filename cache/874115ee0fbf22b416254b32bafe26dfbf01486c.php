<p>During the stunt he reportedly damaged the security gate as well as his car's tires and windshield. </p>

<p>A police dispatcher compared the incident to a scene from the 'Dukes of Hazzard', a 1970s television show in which a Dodge Charger would often take flying leaps to escape from law enforcement, according to a report in local station WDIV-TV.</p>

<p>Drawbridge operator Andre Locke, who witnessed the incident, was quoted by the news outlet as saying: 'And I looked, I said, 'No he ain't.''</p>

<p>'Over he went, blew out all four of his tires, and then he crashed into the other gate,' Locke said. </p>

<p>He added: 'It was a first for me.'  </p>

<p>Gomez faces charges including malicious destruction of property and reckless driving. </p>

<p>Police said the driver is also suspected of being under the influence from using a source of nitrous oxide known as 'whippits.' </p>

<p>He was arraigned on Saturday and released on a $3,500 bond. </p>

<p>If convicted, the 26-year-old faces up to five years behind bars. </p>

<p>'These pandemic times have seemingly brought out the worst in many Michigan drivers,' Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said, as quoted by The Detroit News. </p>

<p>'The rules of the road the same and there is no place for drivers who refuse to follow them and instead try alleged stunts like this.' </p>
