<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian mother has warned parents to keep an eye on any wounds their children sustain after her son contracted a serious infection from a fall at the zoo.</p>

<p>While the woman was in 'two minds' about sharing the photo of her little boy, she was ultimately convinced to do it as an educational tool - and because her husband wouldn't have known there was a problem without her knowledge.</p>

<p>'I am sure there are other parents who wouldn't know about it either and the only reason I knew is because it had happened to a friend's son two years ago and she had shared,' the lady, who chose to remain anonymous, said.</p>

<p>The innocent-looking photo shows a bandage on her son's hand from a recent cut, and a red line emerging from it, stretching up his wrist.  </p>

<p>'A week or so ago the littlest fell over at the zoo. He took quite a bashing but once we got home I cleaned him up,' she said of the incident.</p>

<p>'I rang his school because they were having a "farm" day and I wanted to make sure he washed his hands after digging. I tried to ensure it was kept clean (both his hand and elbow). However, he's an eight-year-old boy.'</p>

<p>When he came home that day the wounds didn't look outwardly infected, but she was concerned that they had gotten a little bit bigger.</p>

<p>They weren't 'gunky' like you would usually expect from an infection.</p>

<p>'Yesterday on our way to the beach he showed me his hand. I wasn't happy as I noticed red tracking down his vein,' she said.</p>

<p>'I then checked his elbow - the same. I took him down to the out of hours GP feeling a bit silly but when the doctor saw it he commended me on recognising it and getting down ASAP.'</p>

<p>The red line is called Lymphangitis, or inflammation of the lymphatic channels that occurs as a result of infection.</p>

<p>This means the infection is in the lymphatic system, and it causes red lines from the wound that travel in the direction of the nearest lymph gland.</p>

<p>If treated quickly, the condition can be mild but if left untreated, complications can occur, and the condition can become very serious. </p>

<p>When the infection crosses over into the bloodstream, like it did for this boy, it's known as sepsis.</p>

<p>The thin red line was revealed to be blood poisoning, or sepsis. It's not the type of infection you can simply 'leave' alone to heal, she said.</p>

<p>'Thankfully the antibiotics are working and he is well in himself. If you spot this red line running from a wound get your child seen straight away,' she continued.</p>

<p>'Hopefully, my post might help someone the way my friend's post from two years ago helped me.'</p>

<p>Tiny Heart Education shared the post on behalf of the mother, saying that the red line is called Lymphangitis. </p>

<p>Sepsis is a life-threatening complication to an infection, and can show itself by way of rapid breathing, convulsions, a rash that doesn't fade when you press it, fever or a very low temperature, pale skin, inability to pass urine and lethargy.</p>

<p>It must be treated with antibiotics, and sometimes, intravenous fluids. If left unchecked it can damage multiple organ systems and cause death. </p>

<p>Many parents were shocked to learn of the unassuming red line in the post and said they would never have thought it was serious.</p>

<p>'Thank you for all your tips I would have never have known this and it's not something you learn in first aid either,' said one mother.</p>

<p>'This is sensational, I had no idea about this. Thank you for sharing,' said another. </p>
