<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Stunning images of September's first full moon have been captured by eager skywatchers today - as it was revealed Britain's summer heatwave saw below-average sunshine for the season. </p>

<p>The astonishing lunar spectacle, known as the 'Corn Moon', was photographed illuminating the sky over Hengistbury Head and Weymouth Bay in Dorset late on Tuesday.</p>

<p>It will reach its peak at around 6.22am today, but the moon is expected to put on a glorious display for three consecutive nights - until it last shows its full face on September 3.</p>

<p> Traditionally, the full moon at the start of September is known as the Harvest Moon - as this is typically the full moon which occurs closest to the September - or Southward - equinox.</p>

<p>But this year, the equinox falls on September 22, with the nearest full moon on October 1. This week's moon is therefore known as the Corn Moon, according to the Maine Farmer's Almanac.</p>

<p>The Met Office last night revealed the UK saw below average sunshine for the season despite being hit by a 'major summer heatwave' where temperatures rose to highs of 97F (36.4C) in London.</p>

<p>Britain experienced its hottest August day since 2003 at Heathrow and Kew Gardens on August 7, but forecasters say more unsettled weather at the start and end of the month balanced the average out.  </p>
