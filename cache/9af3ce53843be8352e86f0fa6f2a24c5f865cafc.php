<p>Surf Life Saving NSW President George Shales said he hopes beachgoers respect the measures 'particularly regarding beach safety but also regarding social distancing requirements'.</p>

<p>More than 20 people are currently banned from gathering in public places under NSW public health orders.</p>

<p>Despite drones circling the busiest NSW shorelines, Director of Lifesaving Joel Wiseman said it won't be the job of lifeguards to actively police social distancing rules. </p>

<p>'Life savers are not there to police the public, that is not our job,' he said.</p>

<p>Despite drones circling the busiest NSW shorelines, Director of Lifesaving Joel Wiseman said it won't be life guards' jobs to actively police social distancing rules</p>

<p>'We're there to ensure a safe aquatic swimming environment. We will obviously notify NSW Police if we have any suspicions or concerns around the numbers that are at the beaches.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hefty new fines have been announced for NSW residents caught at private gatherings of more than 20 people.  </p>

<p>Each and every guest could cop a $1000 fine if there are more than 20 people partying together as the festive season gets under way.</p>

<p>NSW Police are warning that amendments have been made to the Public Health Order, with partygoers now risking hefty fines fine if the gathering exceeds the 20-person limit.</p>

<p>Where previously, only the organiser of a gathering was liable to receive a fine if the number of people at the premises breached the Public Health Order, every reveller will now be held responsible for the breach.</p>

<p>The changes, which come into effect at midnight, aim to ensure the safety of the community ahead of the expected increase in gatherings associated with Christmas and end-of-year festivities. </p>

<p>Operation Coronavirus Commander Assistant Commissioner Tony Crandell said on Monday it's only natural that as the weather warms up, people will be more likely to gather. </p>

<p>'These amendments aim to ensure that an increase in expected gatherings doesn't mean an increase in COVID-19 cases,' he said. </p>

<p>'The new changes come in addition to other restrictions which remain in place, including a limit on numbers at outdoor gatherings and licensed premises.'   </p>

<p>NSW has recorded just one new locally acquired COVID-19 case but health authorities are warning there's no room for complacency amid lower testing rates and with school holidays due soon.</p>

<p>Four new cases were recorded in the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday including three returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one linked to a known cluster.</p>

<p>The locally acquired case is a close contact of a previous case who attended the Eastern Suburbs Legion Club.</p>

<p>Each and every guest could cop a $1000 fine if there are more than 20 people partying together in NSW as the festive season gets under way</p>

<p>NSW Health acting director Christine Selvey said testing rates had dropped recently and urged people with the mildest symptoms to make sure they get tested.</p>

<p>'Testing numbers have dropped over the past two weeks and this is a concern particularly in areas like southwestern, western and southeastern Sydney,' she said in a video update on Monday.</p>

<p>More than 9300 people were tested in the latest reporting period, down from 14,426 the previous day.</p>

<p>Although weekend test numbers usually drop, Sunday's figure is well below recent weekend numbers, which have been in excess of 20,000.</p>

<p>Premier Gladys Berejiklian implored people to not become complacent, saying every day is a battle against the virus.</p>

<p>'Remember we let our guard down earlier in the year and the Victoria situation arose unexpectedly,' she told reporters in Sydney on Monday.</p>

<p>She also urged other states to help ease the burden of accepting returned travellers into hotel quarantine.</p>
