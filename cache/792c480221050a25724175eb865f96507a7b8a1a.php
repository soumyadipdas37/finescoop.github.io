<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jose Mourinho insists Dele Alli is feeling Tottenham Hotspur's poor start to the Premier League season after cutting a dejected figure in the changing room.</p>

<p>Spurs were outplayed by a vibrant Everton outfit at White Hart Lane to lose 1-0 in their opening game of the campaign.</p>

<p>Alli started the match but made little impact in the first 45 minutes before being replaced at half-time for Moussa Sissoko.</p>

<p>Dele Alli started for Tottenham in their disappointing 1-0 defeat by Everton on Sunday</p>

<p>Alli was unable to make much impact  in north London before being hauled off at half-time</p>

<p>Mourinho admits that while the 24-year-old was unhappy at being replaced he was 'one of many' left feeling the frustration of a laboured performance.</p>

<p>'Dele was quiet, he was sad,' Mourinho said ahead of Tottenham's Europa League qualifier against Lokomotiv Plovdiv. 'After the game, he was just one of many.</p>

<p>'He's a good boy, very, very polite and I never saw from him a strong reaction. A good boy, a really good boy.'</p>

<p>Alli's first-team future is in doubt at White Hart Lane amid reports of a sensational return to the club of fan favourite Gareth Bale on loan.</p>

<p>Boss Jose Mourinho admitted Alli and his Spurs team-mates were left frustrated post-match</p>

<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin's second half header won the Premier League opener at Tottenham</p>

<p>Mourinho though remained coy on Tottenham's approach to bring the Welsh forward back to the club from Real Madrid where they sold him for a world record £86million fee in 2013 shortly after Mourinho tried to sign him from Spurs while he was in charge at the Bernabeu.</p>

<p>'I tried to sign him for Real Madrid which was not possible to do during my time there,' he added.</p>

<p>'But the president followed my instinct and my knowledge and the season I left he brought Gareth to the club.</p>

<p>'There is no secret on that. Even Gareth knows that. But I'm not going to speak about him anymore because he is a Real Madrid player.'</p>
