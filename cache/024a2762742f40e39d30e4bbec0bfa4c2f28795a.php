<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump bizarrely credited eating McDonald's for his almost-full hairdo in the middle of a post-debate tweetstorm while on board Air Force On Wednesday. </p>

<p>'No wonder I didn’t lose my hair!' Trump tweeted, sharing a 2018 tweet from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, which had pointed to an ABC 7 Chicago story that said a chemical in McDonald's French fries may be a cure for baldness. </p>

<p>Fleischer, who is bald, had commented, 'It doesn't work,' and had pinned his retort to the top of his feed, where the president must have saw it.  </p>

<p>President Donald Trump tweeted about his hair on Wednesday amid a tweetstorm reacting to Tuesday night's first presidential debate against Democrat Joe Biden </p>

<p>'No wonder I didn't lose my hair!' the president tweeted, linking to a 2018 tweet from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who had shared an article saying a chemical in McDonald's French fries cures baldness </p>

<p>A minute later, Trump tweeted out a 'thank you Ari!' as the former press secretary, who had served Republican President George W. Bush, had blamed Democrat Joe Biden for interrupting Trump first, setting the tone of the debate, in Fleischer's view.</p>

<p>'I rewatched the start of the debate,' Fleischer wrote. 'The first question went to Trump who gave an uninterrupted 2-minute response. Then Biden gave an uninterrupted 2-minute response. Then it went back to Trump, whose answer was interrupted three times by Biden.' </p>

<p>'If you didn't like it, blame Biden for starting it,' Fleischer said.  </p>

<p>The hair comment comes on the heels of The New York Times reporting Sunday that Trump had written off $70,000 in hairstyling from his taxes. </p>

<p>Trump's long made a to-do about his 'do, famously allowing 'Tonight Show' host Jimmy Fallon mess up his unique coiffure in 2016 before a New Hampshire rally, in an effort to prove that it wasn't a wig. </p>

<p>Earlier that year, Gawker put out a report suggesting Trump's hairstyle was the product of a $60,000 baldness intervention that weaved a donor's hair on top of the businessman's locks. </p>

<p>However, an expert on baldness quickly came out with an op-ed in The New York Daily News, explaining it's more likely Trump had a hair transplant. </p>

<p>Trump admitted that he had a bald spot in February 2018 after his medical report from then White House physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, confirmed he was taking the drug Propecia for male-pattern hair loss. </p>

<p>During his appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the president marveled at seeing himself on the jumbotrons that were flanking his podium.  </p>

<p>He air-patted his hair and did a twirl.</p>

<p>'I try like hell to hide that bald spot folks, I work hard at it,' he said to laughs.  </p>

<p>Michael Wolff's book 'Fire and Fury,' which had been released a month before, quoted Ivanka Trump as she explained to friends how her father's hairdo worked. </p>

<p>'She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate – a contained island after scalp-reduction surgery – surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray,' Wolff wrote.</p>

<p>'The color, she would point out in comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men – the longer it was left on, the darker it got,' Wolff said. 'Impatience resulted in Trump's orange-blond hair color,' the author added.  </p>
