<p>'I ended up going out that night, and I went to take a picture because there was so many icons, Billy Idol, all these legends.</p>

<p>'I go to take a picture, and it was on selfie-style. With all this partying, I looked horrible, sweaty and flat, mascara dripping down my face and I thought well it's time to go home!' she said.  </p>

<p>She said: 'Listen I’m 27 and I know I’ve never experienced an election this important in my life and hopefully not again in my lifetime. </p>

<p>'I can’t express the importance enough, especially if young people getting out there and being active and making sure that their friends, their family are voting and have the information about whether it’s mailing in, about the state of our country right now. </p>

<p>'It’s just crucial that we get out there and make changes and we have someone fit for the job of running our country.'</p>

<p>When asked if she thought US President Donald Trump would stay in office for another four years, Miley explained: 'I think young people are really stepping up to the plate, really taking charge and getting mobilised working and advocating tirelessly.</p>

<p>'I think that you know it's kind of rock bottom here right now. I think it's desperate times, I think people will really step up.</p>

<p>'I don't believe in "don't worry and be happy", I believe that worry is healthy. Worry is why we are washing our hands, wearing our masks, keeping our distance. I believe in realism and not saying everything is going to be okay,' Miley concluded.</p>
