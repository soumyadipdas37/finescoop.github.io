<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A disgraced police officer who conned innocent victims to build a fraudulent investment empire has become the first Victorian female cop to be jailed. </p>

<p>Former police sergeant Rosa Catherine Rossi, 58, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years behind bars with a non-parole period of two years and four months in Victoria's Country Court.</p>

<p>Wearing a headscarf and face mask in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise herself, Rossi was surrounded by a media scrum as she arrived for sentencing in Melbourne on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>Rossi used her position of authority to steal six vacant homes between April 2016 to June 2017 by claiming 'squatters' rights'.</p>

<p>Rosa Catherine Rossi (pictured) arrives at County Court of Victoria on Wednesday, where she was sentenced to four-and-a-half years jail</p>

<p>She then changed the locks of the properties and rented the homes out to pocket the cash. </p>

<p>The elaborate scam began with three small Willaura homes in western Victoria worth $50,000 and $108,500 before it expanded to Melbourne properties worth up to $1million in Malvern, Chadstone and Brooklyn.</p>

<p>She used the police database to research at least one property owner's details.</p>

<p>On one occasion she went to a suburban Melbourne council office in police uniform to demand an owner's number.</p>

<p>Rosa Catherine Rossi (pictured as a police sergeant) used her position of authority to steal empty properties, change the locks and rent them out to tenants to make cash</p>

<p>She also created false documents as part of deception to change the addresses with water and power companies.</p>

<p>When a concerned neighbour called police after spotting Rossi at one Willaura home, she said she was an officer, had keys and was buying the property.  </p>

<p>Investigators later discovered the home was owned by a man in South Africa, who was not selling the property.</p>

<p>Rossi eventually resigned from Victoria Police and pleaded guilty to nine charges including of obtaining property by deception, perjury, and unauthorised access to police information following an anti-corruption investigation.</p>

<p>She rose through the ranks of Victoria Police after joining in 1994 and spent 24 years in the force before her resignation in 2018.</p>

<p>The former police sergeant (pictured) will spend at least two years and four months in jail</p>

<p>One of her victims was a disability pensioner, who told the court he felt 'like a fool'. </p>

<p>'It didn't seem right to me that a police officer would be up to anything fraudulent,' the man told the court in a statement.</p>

<p>'I was gutted. I felt like a fool.</p>

<p>'I still don't know why she did this.'</p>

<p>Anther victim Karen Lang had her home taken over by Rossi while she was living in Melbourne with her partner.</p>

<p>When she returned to the Willaura property, the home had been cleaned out and the locks had been changed.</p>

<p> Rosa Catherine Rossi was facing up to 10 years behind bars when she arrived for sentencing</p>

<p>'I think she has no shame,' Ms Lang told A Current Affair in June. </p>

<p>'For a police officer to do something like that to a family, is pretty appalling. We've got special needs children too and she stole from special needs children.'</p>

<p>Another victim 'couldn't believe' the lengths the former cop went to take over his almost $1-million property in Malvern.</p>

<p>'That was probably the creepiest part of it,' Kev told the program.</p>

<p>Rossi was facing up to 10 years behind bars. </p>

<p>Judge Martine Marich had stern words for Rossi during Wednesday's sentencing.</p>

<p>'Your conduct was brazen and callous to the rights of the true owners,' the judge told the court.</p>
