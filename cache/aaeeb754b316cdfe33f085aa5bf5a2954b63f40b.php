<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Cystic Fibrosis sufferer who announced her desire to die by assisted suicide at Dignitas live on TV has been given a new lease of life by a groundbreaking drug.</p>

<p>Jennie Thornton, 40, fell seriously ill earlier this year with a 30 per cent lung infection and feared that she could be killed if she were to catch coronavirus.  </p>

<p>Seven years ago, she had opened up on This Morning over her intention to travel to the Swiss suicide clinic rather than spending her final days bound to a hospital bed 'covered in tubes, too weak to be fed... in prolonged pain'</p>

<p>As the virus claimed more lives and she put her chances of survival as bleak, she was once again found contemplating her own death.  </p>

<p>But Ms Thornton has been left staggered by the effects of a cutting-edge course of treatment called Kaftrio which has subsided lifelong pain and made her feel like she's 'no longer dying'.  </p>

<p>Jennie Thornton, 40, fell seriously ill earlier this year with a lung infection and feared that she could be killed if she were to catch coronavirus</p>

<p>Ms Thornton, from Buckinghamshire, has been reborn thanks to a ground-breaking treatment, now licensed by the NHS, which offers a ray of hope to thousands of people with CF</p>

<p>During lockdown, Ms Thornton, from Buckinghamshire, starting taking Kaftrio after being selected for the first round of treatment in the UK.   </p>

<p>'The results were almost instantaneous. All my family sat with me in the garden when I took my first pill at 10.30am on a Saturday morning,' she told the Mirror.</p>

<p>'By 4.30pm the cough I've lived with all my life had eased. In two weeks my lung function had shot up to 60 per cent, I gained 10lb and no longer felt breathless and exhausted. In short, I don't feel like I'm dying any more.'</p>

<p>Moreover, her salty skin typical of of CF sufferers had vanished and lifelong agony in her shoulders had ebbed away. </p>

<p>The NHS recently signed a deal with US drugs company Vertex to supply the drug, offering a ray of hope to thousands of British CF patients. </p>

<p>The course of treatment has allowed Ms Thornton to enjoy life and she has spent the summer hiking and swimming in the Cornish sea - worlds apart from the years she spent contemplating her own death. </p>

<p>During lockdown, she was one of 120 sufferers in the UK selected for the first round of treatment by a drug called Kaftrio</p>

<p>Cystic fibrosis is an incurable genetic disease that affects around 70,000 people worldwide.</p>

<p>A defective gene causes a build-up of mucus in the airways, making it increasingly difficult to breathe over time.</p>

<p>Mucus also blocks the natural release of digestive enzymes, meaning the body does not break down food as it should.</p>

<p>As Covid-19 claimed more lives every day, Ms Thornton believed the likelihood of her seeing out the pandemic were slim, and told her family she did not wish to be put on a ventilator if she contracted the deadly virus. </p>

<p>Confronted with the grim reality that half of cystic fibrosis sufferers are dead before they are 40, she had years ago made clear her intention to die by assisted suicide.  </p>

<p>In 2013, she shocked ITV viewers when announcing live on This Morning she would be travelling to Dignitas for assisted suicide if she believed her death was a possibility in the near future.</p>

<p>Recalling the fear she had had since she was young, Ms Thornton said: 'I've seen people in the final stages of battling the disease – covered in tubes, too weak to be fed, hallucinating from too much morphine, haemorrhaging from the mouth</p>

<p>'I had no wish to die confined to a hospital bed and in prolonged pain.'  </p>

<p>Following her appearance, Ms Thornton was mercilessly trolled amid a harsh social media backlash, but she stuck by her decision to want to die.</p>

<p>Yet access to Kaftrio, which is manufactured by pharmaceuticals firm Vertex and has been available in the US since October, has turned her life around.</p>

<p>In June, a deal between NHS England and the drugs company was agreed, even before a licence was granted.</p>

<p>NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: 'This is a potentially transformational treatment for cystic fibrosis and I am proud that... NHS patients will be among the first in Europe to benefit.' </p>

<p>Cystic fibrosis is an incurable genetic illness that causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that builds up in the lungs and digestive system. </p>

<p>This means patients are vulnerable to severe lung infections and also have problems digesting food. </p>
