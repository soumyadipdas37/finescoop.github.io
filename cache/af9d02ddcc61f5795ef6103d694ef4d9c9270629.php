<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Canadian man has gone on trial accused of murdering and dismembering two young women whose bodies were only discovered after two plumbers were called to the home to unclog pipes.</p>

<p>The workmen had been in the Ontario apartment building where 47-year-old Adam Strong lived to unblock some drains when they came across a 'fleshy-like substance.' </p>

<p>Unsure of what it was they had found, the pair decide to call police officers who then uncovered the gruesome scene. </p>

<p>The trial of Adam Strong, 47, pictured, accused of murdering and dismembering two women got underway Monday in Oshawa, Ontario</p>

<p>It was December 2017 when Police Constable Kevin Park went to the Oshawa home, northeast of Toronto.</p>

<p>Park met with the two plumbers where he was shown a shopping bag in which some remains had been collected.</p>

<p>'I'd never seen anything like this before so I wasn't sure,' the Durham Regional Police officer testified in court on Monday, as reported by CTV.</p>

<p>Four police officers then went down to the basement apartment where a man, Strong, opened the door.</p>

<p>Park asked what he was flushing down the toilet. </p>

<p>Strong is alleged to have admitted things immediately.</p>

<p>The dismembered body of Rori Hache, 18, was found in Strong's freezer and down some drains</p>

<p>Strong has also been charged with first-degree murder in the case of  Kandis Fitzpatrick who disappeared in 2008</p>

<p>'OK, you got me, the gig's up, it's a body,' he is alleged to have said. 'If you want to recover the rest of her, it's in my freezer.'</p>

<p>Strong was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the death of 18-year-old Rori Hache. He is also accused of killing Kandis Fitzpatrick, 19, who vanished in 2008 and has not been heard from since.</p>

<p>Strong has pleaded not guilty to both first-degree murder charges.</p>

<p>Crown attorney Bryan Guertin told the court how fishermen had found a torso in Oshawa Harbour three months earlier.</p>

<p>It was quickly established that the body was that of Hache's. </p>

<p>Information found on Strong's digital devices, including his cellphone, is likely to form some part of the evidence in the case against him </p>

<p>Hache was found with multiple injuries on her body, including two fractures to her skull although an overall cause of death could not be established according to a medical examiner</p>

<p>During their forensic search, investigators also found a large hunting knife on which Kandis Fitzpatrick's DNA was found. Her blood was similarly found in Strong's freezer and bedroom</p>

<p>Strong had not been on police's radar until he had been caught trying to dispose of Hache's remains.</p>

<p>Data from Google showed how his phone had been located at Oshawa Harbour one week before the torso had been found.</p>

<p>After Strong's arrest, investigators found the rest of her body as Strong had said, in a freezer in his bedroom. Her blood was found on Strong's bedroom walls and ceiling, and his semen was found on her body.  </p>

<p>Hache was found with multiple injuries on her body, including two fractures to her skull although an overall cause of death could not be established according to a medical examiner.   </p>

<p>During their forensic search, investigators also found a large hunting knife on which  Kandis Fitzpatrick's DNA was found. Her blood was similarly found in Strong's freezer and bedroom. </p>

<p>'Ms. Fitzpatrick found the same fate as Ms. Hache,' Guertin told the court. 'Both girls were vulnerable, were essentially homeless with no fixed address.' </p>

<p>Strong had not been on police's radar until he had been caught trying to dispose of Hache's remains</p>

<p>Data from Google showed how his phone had been located at Oshawa Harbour, pictured above, one week before the torso of Rori Hache had been found</p>

<p>'Both girls suffered from drug issues and sometimes worked in the sex trade to help fund their drug habit.'</p>

<p>Hache's mother, Shanan Dionne, spoke outside court on Monday and said the trial was not about her daughter being homeless or 'a drug-addict tossed away that wasn't loved, because she was so loved.'</p>

<p>The 18-year-old was pregnant at the time but also struggling with an addiction to crystal meth.</p>

<p>Kandis's father, William Fitzpatrick, also testified in course and told how the last time he had seen his daughter was spring of 2008 and had not heard from her since.</p>

<p>She was also known to have struggled with drugs and would often leave home for weeks at a time without any notice.  </p>

<p>The trial is continuing and will use digital evidence from Strong's phone along with testimony from five other alleged female victims of sexual violence by Strong. </p>
