<p>The blonde beauty wore her locks down for the sultry snap and added a slick of pink lipgloss as well as some smokey eyeshadow.</p>

<p>She also shared pictures of a generously sized glass of bubbles while inside one of the luxury 376-acre country estate's gorgeous rooms. </p>

<p>Taking to Instagram on Sunday, Amanda said: 'Had the best #romantic #weekend with #Chrispy in this historic and infamous place steeeeped in history.</p>

<p>'Thank you to all the staff for looking after us so well... NOT an #ad ( thanks to John on the door for humouring me by taking this pic early this morning)'</p>

<p>Poser: Amanda also shared a snap of her putting on a glamorous display as she posed on a car</p>

<p>Having a great time: She thanked the Cliveden house staff for their hospitality on Instagram on Sunday</p>

<p>Cliveden house is a popular spot for celebs and has hosted an array of famous faces over the years including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Charlie Chaplin.</p>

<p>The property, once owned by William Waldorf Astor, was also the hotel where Meghan Markle stayed the night before her wedding to Price Harry in 2018.</p>

<p>Amanda's trip comes after she teamed up with West End superstar Sheridan Smith for a duet of the hit song I Know Him So Well.</p>

<p>The single is the latest musical offering from Amanda's album, Songs From My Heart, which will be released on October 2.</p>

<p>Bubbles: Amanda also gave her fans another glimpse into the luxury getaway as she shared a picture of her drink</p>

<p>The tune and accompanying video is a cover of a song from Chess The Musical and was released on Friday.  </p>

<p>In black and white stills from the music video, Amanda and Sheridan, 39, look as though they are having lots of fun as they giggle while in the recording studio.  </p>

<p>Amanda said: 'I got a great friendship out of this song in Sheridan Smith. I’d loved her for years and we’ve always hugged when we met but we didn’t know each other.</p>

<p>'I really wanted her to duet with me on I Know Him So Well so I asked David Walliams for her number. </p>

<p>Famously friends: Amanda (left) recently released a duet with Sheridan Smith of I Know Him So Well from Chess The Musical, which came out on Friday (pictured during recording)</p>

<p>'She was heavily pregnant, but she couldn’t have been nicer or more enthusiastic when I called her, and the final result is better than I even imagined.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'This is also the first single I ever bought for my mum who loved Barbara Dickson. We had all her albums and even though I have never to this day seen Chess, this is the song I’ve always loved.'</p>

<p>Family has always been at the heart of Amanda's music</p>

<p>The idea to create an album came about after Amanda and her daughters recorded Tightrope (from The Greatest Showman) for her husband to mark their 10th wedding anniversary in 2018. </p>

<p>Amanda and Chris tied the knot in 2008 at Babington House, Somerset, two years after welcoming their first child. They are parents to daughters Alexa and Hollie.</p>

<p>My girls: Amanda is mother to daughters Hollie, eight, and Alexa, 14, who she shares with Chris</p>
