<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chinese authorities have revealed why an Australian journalist has been detained in Beijing after two other reporters were forced to flee the country.</p>

<p>Cheng Lei, a high profile business anchor on Chinese state television, has been held in a secret location for more than three weeks. </p>

<p>'The Australian national Cheng Lei is suspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China's national security,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters.</p>

<p>Australian journalist Cheng Lei (pictured) was detained in China's capital city Beijing in August. She is a high profile anchor for CGTN, China's English language state broadcaster</p>

<p>The Chinese foreign ministry said Ms Cheng (pictured) had been investigated and was 'suspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China's national security'</p>

<p>'Compulsory measures have been imposed on Cheng and she has recently been investigated by relevant authorities.'</p>

<p>He said the case was being handled according to Chinese law and Ms Cheng's legitimate rights and interests were fully guaranteed.</p>

<p>The explanation comes after two Australian journalists were rushed out of China for their own safety after being banned from leaving until they answered questions about Ms Cheng.</p>

<p>Bill Birtles from the ABC and Michael Smith from the Australian Financial Review returned to Sydney on Tuesday after a five-day diplomatic stand-off.</p>

<p>Their rushed evacuation has left Australia without any correspondents working on the ground in China for the first time in 50 years.</p>

<p>Chinese police told the journalists they were people of interest in the case of Ms Cheng and both men were ordered to report for questioning.</p>

<p>They sheltered in Australian diplomatic compounds for days as their travel rights were revoked.</p>

<p>It is not known where in Beijing Cheng (pictured) has been detained since August</p>

<p>The explanation for Ms Cheng's arrest comes after two Australian reporters, Bill Birtles (pictured) from the ABC and Michael Smith from the AFR, fled China fearing for their safety </p>

<p>Consular officials secured safe passage after the pair agreed to be interviewed.</p>

<p>Both journalists say they are relieved to be home but disappointed about the circumstances surrounding their departure.</p>

<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs urged the ABC to withdraw Mr Birtles from China last week after it learned of Cheng's detention.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the government had become concerned about the uncertainty posed for other Australian journalists.</p>

<p>Mr Birtles and Mr Smith (pictured) were initially banned from leaving the country until they answered questions about Cheng. Both reporters had been told they were persons of interest </p>

<p>Mr Smith holds his thumbs up upon his return to Sydney on Tuesday morning. He and Mr Birtles were questioned by Chinese authorities before they could return to Australia</p>

<p>Mr Birtles is seen at Sydney airport on Tuesday following the frightening rush to leave China</p>

<p>Mr Zhao told reporters the questioning of the men was a normal enforcement of the law, which authorities had strictly adhered to during their investigations.</p>

<p>He said China protected the legitimate rights and interests of news gathering staff and they had the obligation to comply with the laws and regulations in China.</p>

<p>'As long as foreign journalists conduct news reporting in accordance with laws, they should have nothing to worry about,' Mr Zhao said.</p>

<p>The Australian government is advising all Australians not to travel to China, warning they could face arbitrary detention.</p>

<p>Australia has been left without any credentialed journalists in China for the first time since the 1970s.</p>

<p>Senator Payne described the diplomatic saga as a disappointing.</p>

<p>'Australia, of course, is a strong advocate of freedom of the press,' she said.</p>

<p>'We will work appropriately with media organisations to determine next steps.'</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Marise Payne (pictured) has reminded Australians not to go to China</p>

<p>Government travel advice website Smartraveller (pictured) was updated on 7 July to warn Aussies they face the risk of arbitrary detention in China </p>
