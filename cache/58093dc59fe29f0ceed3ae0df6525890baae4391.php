<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Suarez has agreed to join Juventus from Barcelona and is nearing the exit door if he can finalise his payoff. </p>

<p>The 33-year-old striker looks set to combine with Cristiano Ronaldo next season rather than Lionel Messi with his time at the Nou Camp coming to an end. </p>

<p>According to Guillem Balague, Suarez is happy to be paid one season's wages by Barcelona to get him to move on and he has agreed to join the Italian side. </p>

<p>Luis Suarez has reportedly agreed to join Juventus from Barcelona this summer </p>

<p>The Uruguayan does not have to leave Barcelona and has one more year on his existing deal. </p>

<p>If he played 60 per cent of the games next season he would trigger another year extension but it appears all parties are ready to move on. </p>

<p>He will join Andrea Pirlo's side as either a free agent or for a small nominal transfer fee.  </p>

<p>Balague reports that the departure will have no impact on the decision Lionel Messi makes about his future at Barcelona. </p>

<p>Suarez will be fondly remembered in Catalonia having delivered consistently for the team having joined from Liverpool for £74million six years ago.  </p>

<p>He scored a whopping 198 goals in 283 appearances, combining with Messi and for a time Neymar with devastating effect.  </p>

<p>Suarez was an integral part of the side that won the Champions League, LaLiga and Copa del Rey back in 2014-15.  </p>
