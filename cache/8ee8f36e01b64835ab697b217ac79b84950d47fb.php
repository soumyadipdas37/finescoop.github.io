<p>The new plant-based treat was created to look and taste exactly the same as the original meatball, but with sustainable plant-based ingredients.</p>

<p>The new menu offering will be served with mashed potatoes, lingonberries, and cream sauce - the same way as the traditional dish and at the same budget price. </p>

<p>After years of anticipation, IKEA is set to release a plant-based meatball across all Australian bistros on October 6</p>

<p>The new plant ball was created to look and taste exactly the same as the original meatball, but with sustainable plant-based ingredients</p>

<p>The plant-based meat substitute is made with yellow pea protein, oats, potatoes, onion and apple, but contains dairy products and is not suitable for those on a vegan diet.</p>

<p>'We're excited to be able to soon start offering a more sustainable option of our original meatball without compromising on the classic IKEA meatball experience,' said IKEA spokeswoman Bijanka Zubonja.</p>

<p>'Through the exclusive sustainable dining experiences, we're able to provide the very first taste of the plant ball to Australians, as well as showcasing other sustainable food options in our menu in a way that's never been done before,' Bijanka said. </p>

<p>Customers can also purchase take-home packets of frozen plant meatballs from the Swedish Food Market. </p>

<p>Ahead of the national launch date, IKEA is giving 350 customers in selected states the opportunity to be the first in the country to taste the plant-based meatball alternative.</p>

<p>From mid-September shoppers will indulge in a three-course dining menu where well-known IKEA food options will be showcased as part of a never-before-seen menu.</p>

<p>To take part in the 'Sustainable Dining: A menu better for you and the planet', customers will need to be an IKEA Family member and purchase a ticket online priced at $25 per person.</p>
