<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal have reportedly decided to sell goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to Aston Villa.</p>

<p>According to The Independent, Villa are set to make an improvement on their initial offer of £15million for Martinez.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old seized his opportunity when Bernd Leno was injured towards the end of last season and helped Arsenal to win the FA Cup. </p>

<p>Arsenal have reportedly decided to sell goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to Aston Villa</p>

<p>However, Martinez wanted guarantees that he would play regularly for Arsenal this season and reportedly turned down the offer of a new contract from the Gunners.</p>

<p>Martinez is said to have agreed personal terms with Villa on a four year contract which would see him earn around £60,000-a-week.</p>

<p>With Martinez set to depart, Germany international Bernd Leno will be Arsenal's first-choice</p>

<p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta couldn't guarantee Martinez regular playing time at the club</p>

<p>Leno, who featured for Germany against Switzerland last weekend, is poised to start the season as Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper and is set to feature away to Fulham on Saturday.</p>

<p>Martinez joined Arsenal as a youngster in 2010 and had to be extremely patient for opportunities to impress as he was sent out on loan on six occasions.</p>

<p>Prior to last season he had made just 14 appearances for the Gunners but he featured 23 times in 2019-20 and also played in the Community Shield success against Liverpool last month.</p>
