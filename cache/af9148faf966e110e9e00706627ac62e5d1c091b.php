<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nearly a million Australians lost their jobs in just three months as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, shock new figures show.</p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic is set to change Australian lifestyles forever and see traditional bricks-and-mortar stores boarded up, leading to the decimation of retail jobs.</p>

<p>Across all sectors, Australian job vacancies dived by 42.1 per cent during the June quarter as the government shut down non-essential businesses and caused the number of filled jobs to fall by 6.4 per cent.</p>

<p>Australia lost more than 932,000 jobs in just three months as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Pictured is a Centrelink queue in Sydney in March</p>

<p>The arts sector was by far the worst-hit sector with theatre closures causing job numbers to plummet by 19.9 per cent between April 1 and the end of June.</p>

<p>Job losses during the June quarter totalled 932,400</p>

<p>Job vacancies fell 42.1 per cent</p>

<p>Hours worked dropped 9.8 per cent </p>

<p>Retailers also took a hit with job numbers falling by 7.9 per cent during the same time frame, with 112,300 jobs gone.</p>

<p>Myer, Australia's biggest department store chain, stood down 10,000 staff in March as it closed its 60 stores.</p>

<p>With most of these retail outlets remaining closed in April and May, the 120-year retailer made a full-year loss of $172.4million after tax. </p>

<p>While there was bad news, Myer also revealed its online sales had surged by 61.1 per cent over the year to July 25.</p>

<p>Between February and July, the increase in online sales was an even more impressive 98.8 per cent, compared with the same period in 2019, as COVID-19 lockdowns stopped people going to the shop. </p>

<p>Despite the retail sector's woes, Myer's former boss Bernie Brookes has bought a 90 per cent stake in distressed handbag and jewellery label Colette by Colette Hayman.</p>

<p>'My decision to take the majority shareholding will be viewed as contrary to the current difficulties facing bricks and mortar retail,' he said.</p>

<p>Retailers also took a hit with job numbers falling by 7.9 per cent with 112,300 jobs gone in three months. Pictured is a closed Myer store on Bourke Street in Melbourne </p>

<p>The future of traditional bricks-and-mortar is in doubt, with Mr Brookes proceeding to close 103 stores, reducing the number by 75 per cent to just 35.</p>

<p>He also hinted online sales would play a much more prominent role in future years, especially with the threat of more coronavirus lockdowns looming.</p>

<p>'Owning a fashion retail chain is about true omni-channel retail; a strong online presence and physical stores,' Mr Brookes said.</p>

<p>'Our purchase will enable the business to land in a future post COVID-19 in advance of any cessation of lockdowns and restrictions in the future.</p>

<p>'And our core offer of handbags and jewellery will continue, with a fresh focus on the strong performing stores retained, and a significant investment in the digital space.'</p>

<p>Former Myer boss Bernie Brookes has hinted online sales will play a much bigger role in future so retailers don't have to worry about shutting down during a future disease outbreak</p>

<p>Across all sectors, Australian job vacancies dived by 42.1 per cent during the June quarter as the government shut down non-essential businesses and caused the number of filled jobs to fall by 6.4 per cent</p>

<p>Myer, the department store Mr Brookes ran for nine years until 2015, saw online transactions make up a record 17 per cent of all sales.</p>

<p>Across all sectors, the number of filled jobs in Australia during the June quarter plunged by 932,400 to 13.6 million positions as the number of private sector jobs plummeted by 7.1 per cent.</p>

<p>Of those, 739,000 were the main job with another 193,400 someone's second or subsequent job. </p>
