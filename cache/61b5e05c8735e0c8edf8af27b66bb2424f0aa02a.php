<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies was almost a Crystal Palace player but he couldn't get a work permit, Steve Parish explained.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old left MLS side Vancouver Whitecaps in January 2019 and joined the German giants in a move that has since made him one of the world's most exciting talents.</p>

<p>Davies played a key role as Bayern went on to claim Bundesliga and Champions League glory, but it could have been so different a few years earlier for the Canadian.</p>

<p>Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies almost joined Crystal Palace but couldn't get a permit</p>

<p>Steve Parish said he travelled to Canada and wanted to sign Davies as a 16-year-old</p>

<p>Palace chairman Steve Parish explained that the Eagles tried to sign the left-sided player before Bayern were interested, but missed out due to an issue work a work permit.</p>

<p>'When he was 15, 16 in a football school in Edmonton, where my sister lives, she recommended him to me,' he told German outlet Suddeutsche Zeitung.</p>

<p>'We flew to Canada especially to see the player. We wanted to sign him, but once again we couldn't get a work permit in England!</p>

<p>'True story! I still have all the mails. I'm sure he would have been interested in coming to us - and we were very early!</p>

<p>'So I was a little torn when I watched Bayern. But I'm happy for Alphonso. And to see Bayern win is good, because it is a rich but self-sustaining club. I see a team that is bigger than the sum of its parts.'</p>

<p>Davies has since helped Bayern to a Bundesliga and Champions League triumph</p>

<p>Palace finished 14th in the Premier League this season and kept a relatively comfortable distance of nine points to the relegation zone.</p>

<p>However, Parish believes they can still make big improvements become on the league's best teams.Â </p>

<p>'If we didn't [seriously believe it], we'd have to pack up and go. We can't give up!' he added.</p>

<p>'Leicester won the league four years ago, so something like this is still possible: through investment, performance, ingenuity and skill.</p>

<p>'We're just seeing that Leicester and Wolves have managed to get into the top six of the league.</p>

<p>'You can always list your own disadvantages. But there are also downsides with the big clubs. They have to spend a lot of money on players. Previously, the fee depended on the quality of the player and the selling club. Now it is measured by which club a player is moving to.</p>

<p>'When you are in the shoes of the top teams, not all that glitters is gold.'</p>
