<p>A father who killed his teenage son and daughter in a horrific murder suicide had chased, slapped and beaten them in public on a family holiday, an inquest has found.</p>

<p>John Edwards, 67, shot Jennifer, 13, and Jack, 15, in West Pennant Hills, north-western Sydney in July 2018 before turning the gun on himself. </p>

<p>While investigations continue to uncovered the financial planner's domestic crimes, fresh findings emerged on Tuesday at an inquest into the teenager's deaths, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.</p>

<p>The inquest heard that Edwards slapped Jennifer in the street while holidays in Paris.</p>

<p>He then chasing Jack down an alleyway and hitting him so aggressively that members of the public were forced to intervene. </p>

<p>Six months after the murder suicide, the children's mother Olga took her own life.</p>

<p>David Brown, who is a principal at the law firm where she worked as a solicitor, told the inquest she was 'very, very bright'.</p>

<p>Olga shared details of her deteriorating marriage with her colleague and mentor, and express concerns that her violent husband was turning his behaviour towards their children. </p>

<p>When describing Edwards, Mr Brown said: 'He was something of a bully ... He was a man who burst into tempers and I think he drank a lot.'</p>

<p>Mr Brown said he believed Edwards was running a brokerage from the basement of their home with 'a number of young women there', who Olga was concerned about.</p>

<p>Assisting Christopher Mitchell asked what Mr Brown kind of bullying Olga spoke about, to which he replied: 'I mean, how long have I got?'</p>

<p>He said that she wasn't the sort of person to complain, but would speak up as the situation grew dire.</p>

<p>Olga had been sleeping in a separate room with the children following 'serious physical abuse' against Jack.</p>

<p>Mr Brown detailed one instance Olga told him about where Edwards and Jack had a confrontation that resulted in the father pushing his son to the ground and kicking him.</p>

<p>'There were so many instances ... where the father had altercations with his son because the son had shown no respect for his father, with good reason I should say,' Mr Brown said. </p>

<p>Olga left Edwards in March 2016 and took the matter up in the family court.</p>

<p>She described the violence inflicted upon her children in her affidavit, including that Jack slept with a cricket bat in his room to defend himself and his sister against their father.</p>

<p>Despite her claims, Edwards was still allowed to see them as part of a limited contact order by the court.</p>

<p>The NSW Coroners Court on Monday heard Edwards was awarded licences to shoot rifles and pistols in June 2017.</p>

<p>The licence was granted because NSW Firearms Registry staff used a police database report that failed to pick up several matters related to domestic violence.</p>

<p>Over the next year, he legally acquired five weapons including the Glock 17A 9mm semi-automatic pistol he used to shoot dead Jennifer and Jack in the boy's bedroom.</p>

<p>Edwards hired a car and stalked his daughter on her way home from school to learn their new address before he followed or chased his daughter inside.</p>

<p>Neighbour Bruce Wilson heard five shots over about a minute and approached the home, knowing 'someone is shooting the children'.</p>

<p>He eye-balled Edwards as the 68-year-old 'half skipped' down the home's front stairs.</p>

<p>Edwards, 67, turned the gun on himself at a rented home near Normanhurst, northern Sydney (pictured) </p>

<p>'I said "Is everything OK, what have you done?",' Mr Wilson told the inquest.</p>

<p>'He didn't say anything, he just walked towards me.</p>

<p>'He was in no hurry, he didn't rush at all. Everything was methodical and well-thought-out.'</p>

<p>The children were later found 'crumpled together' under Jack's bedroom desk with multiple gunshot wounds, counsel assisting the coroner said in her opening address.</p>

<p>Edwards killed himself at his Normanhurst home the night of the murders.</p>

<p>The 'unimaginable tragedy' had affected many including family, friends and staff at the NSW Firearms Registry, which granted Edwards numerous permits in 2017 and 2018, Coroner Kate Richardson SC said.</p>

<p>One ex-partner said he was never physically violent but 'controlling' while another said he was 'unbalanced and a narcissist', the lead investigator told the inquest. </p>

<p>The police database report generated in June 2017 included stalking allegations by three former partners and a provisional apprehended violence order issued to protect one of his adult children.</p>

<p>But due to the way the algorithm was written, it missed four matters in the police database related to Edwards, Ms Richardson said.</p>

<p>Three had been recorded 'domestic violence - no offence' including an ex-partner's allegation that Edwards had threatened to come to her home, harm her and take her young child; and Olga Edwards' December 2016 report of three separate violent incidents by Edwards in 2015 against Jack and Jennifer.</p>

<p>The fourth report - of Olga being stalked at her yoga studio class after becoming Edwards' seventh ex-partner - was mis-recorded by Hornsby police.</p>

<p>Jack, 15, and Jennifer Edwards, 13, were found 'crumpled together' under Jack's desk after Edwards stormed the West Pennant Hills house (pictured)</p>

<p>That error meant it failed to even appear on Edwards' police database profile, let alone the June 2017 report.</p>

<p>The inquest also heard the registry didn't know Ku-Ring-Gai Pistol Club refused Edwards membership in early 2017.</p>

<p>Club officials formed the impression the 'aggressive' Edwards 'was trying to railroad them', Ms Richardson said.</p>

<p>He then lied in correspondence with registry staff about why he needed to change clubs.</p>

<p>Coroner Teresa O'Sullivan is expected to review NSW's gun licensing process and whether more disclosure between gun clubs, the registry and applicants' ex-partners should be mandated.</p>

<p>Adam Casselden, acting for the NSW Police Force at the inquest, said the registry had made a number of changes since July 2018 to ensure the 'tragic circumstances are not repeated'.</p>
