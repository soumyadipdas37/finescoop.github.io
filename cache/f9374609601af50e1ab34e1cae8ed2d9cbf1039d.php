<p>The Irish UFC fighter took a series of playful pictures in a mirror as the couple waited in a doctor's office in Italy on Friday, under a sign advertising the services of an ear specialist. </p>

<p>The family has been sailing in the Mediterranean on McGregor's £3million yacht The Devocean as he waits to hear whether French prosecutors will press charges. </p>

<p>The 32-year-old was released without charge last week but could face further action over allegations that he 'exhibited his private parts' to a young married woman in a bar on the French island of Corsica. </p>

<p>French gendarmes appeared on a quay to arrest Conor McGregor (at the right wearing a baseball cap) on the French island of Corsica over an alleged sexual assault attempt last week </p>

<p>Since his arrest, McGregor has posted pictures of his family splashing in the Mediterranean including his mother Margaret and sister Aoife. </p>

<p>He went to the doctor's office today with his fiancee Dee, weeks after the couple announced their engagement on August 8 after being in a relationship for 12 years. </p>

<p>In the last week, McGregor has also raged at 'vicious lies' in a now-deleted Facebook post in which he hinted that DNA and CCTV footage could clear his name.  </p>

<p>'The truth is the truth and it gives me wings! I know my character! God bless DNA! God bless Cctv! God bless Eye witness! God bless the truth!,' he wrote. </p>

<p>'The truth is power! I am free! 'Never will a dime be paid to anyone coming at me with vicious lies! Not now not f****** ever!</p>

<p>'I will fight! And I am only beginning my fight!</p>

<p>'I will not allow these people to just accuse me and then disappear into the dark to attempt to ruin someone else's life! No f****** way!'</p>

<p>The retired MMA fighter has used his Instagram account to show his fiancée, sister and mother splashing around in the sea off the rear of his £3million yacht The Devocean</p>

<p>His sister Aoife also showed off her golfing skills firing off several balls from the rear deck of the yacht</p>

<p>McGregor was released without charge after his arrest, but the criminal case is still active and he could be summoned before a magistrate. </p>

<p>The UFC fighter was waiting for the results of 'key physical tests' and 'the examination of film evidence' before learning whether he will be re-arrested. </p>

<p>A prosecuting source on Corsica confirmed to MailOnline on Tuesday that McGregor was 'free to travel while enquiries continue.'</p>

<p>He said test results were 'still being analysed' and evidence including potential camera shots were still being gathered by judicial police supported by gendarmes.</p>

<p>Other potential witnesses to the bar incident were also being interviewed, while the alleged victim was also being kept informed of developments.</p>

<p>McGregor is not considered a flight risk from the EU, and has pledged full cooperation with the French judicial authorities, said the source. </p>

<p>Before the Irishman's arrest McGregor and his fiancee Dee Devlin (right) earlier enjoyed a night in Corsica, where they were seen on the port of Calvi, wearing a tuxedo and a Gala dress while being filmed and photographed staff</p>

<p>Conor McGregor, 32, works out on the dock in the Port of Calvi, Corsica. The Dubliner's £3million yacht was raided last week over claims he'd exposed himself to a married woman and sexually assaulted her</p>

<p>A friend of the alleged victim told broadcaster France 3 Corse that McGregor 'exhibited his private parts' to the woman as she made her way to the toilets. </p>

<p>The MMA star's lawyer Emmanuelle Ramon said the complaint against McGregor was 'abusive' and said the Irishman was freed before reaching the limit of police custody.   </p>

<p>A spokesman for McGregor sent a statement from the United States saying he 'vigorously denied any accusation of bad behaviour'.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the prosecutor's office in Bastia issued a statement saying they had received a complaint 'denouncing acts that could be described as attempted sexual assault and sexual exhibition'. </p>

<p>McGregor, known as Notorious, has been holidaying in the Mediterranean and was in Corsica preparing for a 110-mile water-bike relay race from Calvi to Monaco.</p>

<p>Pictured: This is the harbour side bar in Corsica where Conor McGregor allegedly exposed his manhood to a young married woman and sexually assaulted her. The bar sits below a restaurant called Le Resto</p>

<p>The bar opens up onto a terrace next to the sea front overlooking the mega yachts usually moored in the port</p>

<p>The popular port on the mountainous Mediterranean island has a strip of bars, all facing out towards the waterfront</p>

<p>He was leading a four-member Team Notorious against defending champions 'Team Serenity', headed by Princess Charlene of Monaco. </p>

<p>The event is designed to publicise the water safety initiatives of the Princess Charlene Foundation. </p>

<p>McGregor has been posting pictures on social media showing him cruising around the Mediterranean. </p>

<p>On Friday he complained that he had been visited by drug testers sent even though in June he announced his retirement for the third time, after twice returning to UFC.  </p>

<p>McGregor is no stranger to controversy, having hit the headlines in 2019 for an attack on an older man in a Dublin bar captured in a viral video.</p>

<p>In 2018 he pleaded guilty in Brooklyn, New York to disorderly conduct after attacking a bus filled with UFC fighters.</p>

<p>McGregor held the UFC title for featherweights from 2015 to 2016 and lightweights from 2016 to 2018 and lost to American legend Floyd Mayweather in August 2017 in a lucrative boxing match.</p>
