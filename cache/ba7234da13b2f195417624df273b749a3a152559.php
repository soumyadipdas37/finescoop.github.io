<p>The ex-WBA, WBC and IBF title holder made the stunning confession on the Joe Rogan podcast</p>

<p>Whilst speaking about his love for boxing, he told the Joe Rogan podcast: 'It's orgasmic sometimes. What does it mean when fighting gets you erect?</p>

<p>'Well that's how I'd get when I was a kid. Sometimes I'd get the twinkle.'</p>

<p>Despite his confessing his passion for boxing, Tyson retired from the ring in 2005 after confessing he had fallen out of love with the sport. </p>

<p>The American was a barren run of three defeats in his last four fights, compounded by a sixth round loss to Kevin McBridge 15 years ago. </p>

<p>He added: 'I believe this is just going to be the beginning, and whatever happens, happens in life.</p>

<p>'I'm just interested in fighting for the title of giving. It feels soul-cleaning for some reason. Doing it for myself doesn't do it for me no more.'</p>
