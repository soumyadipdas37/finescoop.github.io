<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A picture of a children's book cover has gone viral after amused shoppers found the main character bears a striking resemblance to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. </p>

<p>The book titled 'Inspector Bubblewrapper's Dos and Don'ts' features a stern-looking middle-aged man in a black suit and glasses carrying what appears to be a clipboard full of rules. </p>

<p>'This bloke setting a list of things we can and can't do looks a little familiar, no?' the caption to the picture posted to Reddit on Wednesday said. </p>

<p>A picture of a children's book cover has gone viral after amused shoppers found the main character bears a striking resemblance to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews </p>

<p>Daniel Andrews has seen increasing backlash over strict Stage 4 coronavirus restrictions which includes and 8pm to 5am curfew for those in Melbourne </p>

<p>'Hey that's Daniel Andrews,' agreed one Reddit user.</p>

<p>'Oh that's too good,' another amused reader said.  </p>

<p>'The red straps are covering up the North Face logo,' added a third, referring to a jacket the premier wore during a number of press conferences. </p>

<p>The book is one of a series launched as part of Coles supermarkets' Little Treehouse marketing campaign which kicked off on July 29. </p>

<p>The children's books replace the plastic mini-collectables from 2019 and are written by Australian children's author Andy Griffiths and illustrated by Terry Denton. </p>

<p>The similarity of Inspector Bubblewrapper to the Victorian Premier is so striking Mr Griffiths even took to Twitter earlier in September with an explanation. </p>

<p>'Well, any resemblance is purely coincidental but if the safety helmet fits... (our thanks to Daniel Andrews and gratitude for his extraordinary and tireless efforts during this extraordinary time),' Mr Griffiths wrote. </p>

<p>Daniel Andrews has seen increasing backlash over strict Stage Four coronavirus lockdowns in Melbourne which include forcing businesses to close and an 8pm to 5am curfew for residents. </p>

<p>Hoards of police have been deployed throughout the city to enforce the restrictions, fining those who are out of their house without a valid reason or who are not wearing face masks. </p>

<p>Tensions erupted on Saturday with hundreds of Melbourne residents taking to the CBD and clashing with policex, some on horseback, in anti-lockdown rallies in the so-called 'Freedom Day' event. </p>

<p>Those in regional Victoria have also questioned the Stage Three restrictions placed on them despite very low COVID-19 case numbers outside of the capital city.  </p>

<p>One man is seen caught in a scuffle with a Victorian police officer during the protest (pictured on Saturday) with wild scenes caught on camera</p>

<p>One woman with a top reading: 'Freedom' was seen being dragged away by two police officers and she desperately tried to fight them off</p>

<p>Coles shoppers receive one of the Little Treehouse book titles for every $30 spent at the store with 'rare' and 'super-rare' versions of some books able to be found. </p>

<p>Financial commentators have questioned why the marketing campaign was even needed in 2020 with the supermarket experiencing an uptick in sales attributed to panic-buying during the COVID pandemic.  </p>

<p>The Little Treehouse items are quite popular for some collectors with a full set of the 24 books including the display folder going for sale online for nearly $60. </p>

<p>The 'rare' version of 'Inspector Bubblewrapper's Dos and Dont's' is going for a tidy $16 online. </p>

<p>There are also 'super-rare' golden Treehouse books of which there are only 100 available. </p>

<p>Coles' chief marketing officer, Lisa Ronson, said the new campaign was a way to help entertain children and improve their reading skills.</p>

<p>'Our research found that while 83% of Australian households frequently encourage children to read, only 22% frequently purchased books for kids to read,' Ms Ronson said. </p>
