<p>New for the vet: Drew Barrymore is launching her very first talk show this month. And the veteran actress and movie producer told People that her past experiences are all contributing to what kind of host she will be</p>

<p>'I’ve had many times of my life exposed without my choice, and I’ve exposed things myself completely willingly,' said the First 50 Dates actress.</p>

<p>'I will say I’ve found that perfect line [of] what is TMI.'</p>

<p>The LA native who had her first big hit film with ET added, 'I started [in this industry] when I was in diapers. </p>

<p>'At 13, it was that sad sob story. </p>

<p>Coming soon: The Wedding Singer star noted that starting her career when she was in 'diapers,' her troubled teen years that are a 'sob story' and her painful divorce from Will Kopelman that made her a single mother of two have all prepared her for 'being myself' on her show</p>

<p>'And then I picked myself back up. I’ve been married, I’ve gotten divorced, I’ve raised myself, for better or worse. I have these two girls who are my entire universe. And it has all been out there.'</p>

<p>She has two daughters – Frankie, aged seven, and Olive, aged six, with ex-husband Will, 42. </p>

<p>Her show launches September 14 premiere and is called, simply, The Drew Barrymore Show. </p>

<p>And she said she is now thrilled 'to be in a job where I don't have to play a character. I just get to be myself.' </p>

<p>Good News: 'I’ve had many times of my life exposed without my choice, and I’ve exposed things myself completely willingly,' said the First 50 Dates actress. 'I will say I’ve found that perfect line [of] what is TMI'</p>

<p>Drew added, 'But I still have to prove myself. And I love that. If we come at this as students, I think that’s kind of the right tone for me, because I tend to also shy away from soapboxes or know-it-alls. I know everything is a work in progress, for me at least.'</p>

<p>The day before it was announced she will kick things off next Monday with a Charlie's Angels reunion featuring Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu, almost 20 years since the first film hit theaters.</p>

<p>Also on Monday, Barrymore, 45, will welcome her three-time onscreen love interest Adam Sandler, with whom she first starred in 1998's beloved period rom-com The Wedding Singer.</p>

<p>Interesting past: The LA native who had her first big hit film with ET added, 'I started [in this industry] when I was in diapers. 'At 13, it was that sad sob story' </p>

<p>It will be a special treat in particular to see Diaz, 48, in front of the camera, albeit as herself – the actress has stepped away from performing ever since 2014's Annie.</p>

<p>Cameron, Lucy and Drew appeared in 2000's Charlie's Angels, which was a worldwide hit that spawned a sequel in 2003 – Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, featuring Demi Moore.  </p>

<p>Sandler, 53, re-teamed with Barrymore in the cute 50 First Dates in 2004, and then ten years later for the less successful Blended. </p>

<p>She can do it! Drew added, 'But I still have to prove myself. And I love that. If we come at this as students, I think that’s kind of the right tone for me, because I tend to also shy away from soapboxes or know-it-alls. I know everything is a work in progress, for me at least' </p>

<p>It will of course be nice to see Drew catching up with her former co-stars, whom she reportedly still counts among her friends.</p>

<p>Other guest lined up for the rest of the premiere week for the one-hour nationally syndicated program include Gabrielle Union, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Eichner, Jane Fonda, Charlize Theron and Billy Porter.  </p>

<p>Barrymore's multi-format show will incorporate news-like segments in addition to standard chat show elements, all focused around Drew's infectious brand of optimism. </p>

<p>Back for more: The Drew Barrymore Show announced a star-studded slate of guests for the premiere week, including a Charlie's Angels reunion featuring Cameron Diaz and Lucy </p>

<p>It remains to be seen how exactly the star – who made her film debut at age five in 1980's Altered States – will actually welcome her guests, as concerns around the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic remain prevalent.</p>

<p>While the show is being shot and produced in New York City, other review shows there have continued to 'welcome' guests virtually via Zoom-like platforms.</p>

<p>While in-person reunions remain preferable – HBO Max's long-touted Friends reunion has again been delayed until next spring in hopes they can all sit on the same couch – it's very likely Drew will be surrounded by a bare minimum of other people for the start of this new endeavor.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, reuniting with her Angels will be a surefire way to start off the proceedings, as Drew, Cameron and Lucy had a phenomenal mix of chemistry and humor in their two Charlie's Angels action flicks. </p>

<p>The first Charlie's Angels premiered in theaters on November 3rd, 2000, which makes next week's reunion a 20th anniversary celebration almost to the date. </p>

<p>Last year, the franchise tried to capture that previous magic with a reboot starring Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska, but the film failed to make much of an impression with audiences. </p>

<p>Remember when: The new chat show host will welcome her three-time onscreen love interest Adam Sandler, with whom she first starred in 1998's beloved rom-com The Wedding Singer</p>
