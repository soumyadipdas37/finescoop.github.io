<p>Pals: Love Island's Maura Higgins, 29, and Chris Taylor, 30, put on a friendly display as they headed out for lunch in rainy Essex on Wednesday</p>

<p>Due to the chilly weather, Maura wrapped up in a cosy cream and jumper and leather jacket with a brown fur lining as she headed to lunch with pal Chris.</p>

<p>The pair were seen enjoying a meal outside despite the rain, with Chris being the perfect gentleman by holding their umbrella as they made their exit.</p>

<p>Friends: The Love Island stars were seen heading to the shops after enjoying lunch together, with Maura looked ever-stylish in a furry leather jacket and flared jeans</p>

<p>The pair sparked rumours of a romance last month, after she went back to his house at 11:15pm after he drove her home to collect her things. </p>

<p>In pictures obtained by The Sun, Maura can be seen carrying her things towards Chris' front door as he lets her in, and the publication reported that they spent the evening ice skating and tenpin bowling at Queensway rink in Notting Hill.</p>

<p>They then went for dinner together before arriving back at Chris' place just before midnight.  </p>

<p>Cheeky: The pair were seen enjoying a meal outside despite the rain with Maura clearly unimpressed by something as they took a seat at their table</p>

<p>The sleepover had fans speculating that Maura and Chris are more than just friends, which they have denied in the past.  </p>

<p>Maura told MailOnline on Thursday that her relationship with Chris is strictly platonic, adding:  'Chris is one of my best friends. A lot of people have said we're dating but it's only because we get on so well.</p>

<p>'We click and have the same banter. We got on so well in the villa but I don't think our friendship was shown at all.</p>

<p>'A lot of people assumed we got friendly outside of the show but that wasn't the case – we clicked straight away.' </p>

<p>Denial: Despite rumours of a romance, Maura told MailOnline on Thursday that her relationship with Chris is strictly platonic</p>
