<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Timothy Ray Brown, the first person known to have been cured of HIV infection, says he is now terminally ill from a recurrence of the cancer that prompted his historic treatment 12 years ago.</p>

<p>Brown, dubbed 'the Berlin patient' because of where he lived at the time, had a transplant from a donor with a rare, natural resistance to the AIDS virus. For years, that was thought to have cured his leukemia and his HIV infection, and he still shows no signs of HIV.</p>

<p>But in an interview, Brown said his cancer returned last year and has spread widely. He´s receiving hospice care where he now lives in Palm Springs, California.</p>

<p>'I'm still glad that I had it,' Brown said of his 2007 bone marrow transplant.</p>

<p>Timothy Ray Brown, the first person known to have been cured of HIV infection, says he is now terminally ill from a recurrence of the cancer that prompted his historic treatment</p>

<p>'It opened up doors that weren't there before' and inspired scientists to work harder to find a cure, which many had begun to think was not possible, the 54-year-old said Thursday.</p>

<p>'Timothy proved that HIV can be cured, but that´s not what inspires me about him,' said Dr. Steven Deeks, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has worked with Brown to further research toward a cure.</p>

<p>'We took pieces of his gut, we took pieces of his lymph nodes. Every time he was asked to do something, he showed up with amazing grace,' Deeks said.</p>

<p>Brown was an American working as a translator in Berlin in the 1990s when he learned he had HIV. In 2006, he was diagnosed with leukemia.</p>

<p>Dr. Gero Huetter, a blood cancer expert at the University of Berlin, believed that a marrow transplant was Brown's best chance of beating the leukemia. </p>

<p>He wondered, could he also cure Brown's other life-threatening disease by using a donor with a gene mutation that provides natural resistance to the AIDS virus?</p>

<p>Donors like these are very rare and transplants are risky. Doctors have to destroy the patient's diseased immune system with chemotherapy and radiation, then transplant the donor´s cells and hope they develop into a new immune system for the recipient.</p>

<p>Brown´s first transplant in 2007 was only partly successful: His HIV seemed to be gone but his leukemia was not. He had a second transplant from the same donor in March 2008 and that one seemed to work.</p>

<p>Since then, Brown has repeatedly tested negative for HIV and has frequently appeared at AIDS conferences where cure research is discussed.</p>

<p>'He´s been like an ambassador of hope,' said Brown´s partner, Tim Hoeffgen.</p>

<p>A second man, Adam Castillejo -- called 'the London patient' until he revealed his identity earlier this year -- also is believed to have been cured by a transplant similar to Brown´s in 2016.</p>

<p>But donors like these are scarce and the procedure is too risky to be widely used.</p>

<p>'Berlin Patient' Timothy Ray Brown was successfully cured of the HIV virus 12 years ago</p>

<p>Scientists have been testing gene therapy and other ways to try to get the effect of the favorable gene mutation without having to do a transplant. At an AIDS conference in July, researchers said they may have achieved a long-term remission in a Brazil man by using a powerful combination of drugs meant to flush dormant HIV from his body.</p>

<p>Mark King, a Baltimore man who writes a blog for people with HIV, said he spoke with Brown earlier this week and is grateful for what Brown has contributed to AIDS research.</p>

<p>'It is unfathomable what value he has been to the world as a subject of science. And yet this is also a human being who is a kind, humble guy who certainly never asked for the spotlight,' King said. 'I think the world of him.'</p>

<p>The vast majority of humans carry the gene CCR5. </p>

<p>In many ways, it is incredibly unhelpful. </p>

<p>It affects our odds of surviving and recovering from a stroke, according to recent research. </p>

<p>And it is the main access point for HIV to overtake our immune systems. </p>

<p>But some people carry a mutations that prevents CCR5 from expressing itself, effectively blocking or eliminating the gene.  </p>

<p>Those few people in the world are called 'elite controllers' by HIV experts. They are naturally resistant to HIV. </p>

<p>If the virus ever entered their body, they would naturally 'control' the virus as if they were taking the virus-suppressing drugs that HIV patients require.</p>

<p>Both the Berlin patient and the London patient received stem cells donated from people with that crucial mutation.</p>

<p>WHY HAS IT NEVER WORKED BEFORE?</p>

<p>'There are many reasons this hasn't worked,' Dr Janet Siliciano, a leading HIV researcher at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told DailyMail.com. </p>

<ol>
<li>FINDING DONORS</li>
</ol>

<p>'It's incredibly difficult to find HLA-matched bone marrow [i.e. someone with the same proteins in their blood as you],' Dr Siliciano said.</p>

<p>'It's even more difficult to find the CCR5 mutation.' </p>

<li>INEFFECTIVE TRANSPLANT LEADS TO CANCER RELAPSE</li>
</ol>

<p>Second, there is always a risk that the bone marrow won't 'take'. </p>

<p>'Sometimes you don't become fully "chimeric", meaning you still have a lot of your own cells.'</p>

<p>That is one of the two most common reasons for previous attempts failing: their immune system is not fully replaced, then the cancer comes back and they can't survive it.  </p>

<ol start="3">
<li>GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE: THE OLD IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKS THE NEW ONE</li>
</ol>

<p>The other most common reason this approach has failed is graft-versus-host disease.</p>

<p>That is when the patient's immune system tries to attack the incoming, replacement immune system, causing a fatal reaction in most. </p>

<ol start="4">
<li>UNKNOWN QUANTITIES</li>
</ol>

<p>Interestingly, both the Berlin patient and the London patient experienced complications that are normally lethal in most other cases. </p>

<p>And experts believe that those complications helped their cases. </p>

<p>Timothy Ray Brown, the Berlin patient, had both - his cancer returned and he developed graft-versus-host disease, putting him in a coma and requiring a second bone marrow transplant. </p>

<p>The London patient had one: he suffered graft-versus-host disease. </p>

<p>Against the odds, they both survived, HIV-free.</p>

<p>Some believe that, ironically, graft-versus-host disease might have helped both of them to further obliterate their HIV. </p>

<p>But there is no way to control or replicate that safely. </p>
