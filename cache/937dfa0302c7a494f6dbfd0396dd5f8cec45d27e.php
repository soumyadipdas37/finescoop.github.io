<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England, Wales and Scotland today posted 27 more Covid-19 deaths while Northern Ireland recorded none in the preliminary toll. </p>

<p>Government officials have yet to confirm the final daily figure, which takes into account all laboratory-confirmed victims in every setting. </p>

<p>The preliminary count for England only includes fatalities in hospitals, meaning care home deaths aren't available until the official update at 4pm. </p>

<p>NHS England revealed another 23 patients died after testing positive for the coronavirus in hospitals across the country — all but one was over the age of 60. </p>

<p>Wales and Scotland each announced two more victims in all settings. </p>

<p>Yesterday another 37 fatalities were recorded across the UK in the official toll, which is more than on any other day for two months. The 44 announced on July 14 was the last highest figure.  </p>

<p>And Department of Health figures show 4,189 new Covid-19 infections are now being recorded each day, on average — up 35 per cent from the figure of 3,096 last Tuesday. </p>

<p>Government statistics show an average 23 Britons are now succumbing to the illness daily, up from 11 last Tuesday. Hospital admissions — another measure of how severe an outbreak is — have also risen again. </p>

<p>It suggests the rise in cases, initially only evident in younger people, is now spilling over into the older generations, as feared. However, fatalities and hospital admission have yet to spike, despite cases having risen rapidly over the past fortnight, or reach levels anywhere near what was seen in March and April. </p>

<p>Tougher restrictions announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson are hoped to stem spreading of the virus. The main one was a 10pm curfew on pubs.</p>

<p>In Scotland, the 10pm curfew has been imposed as well as a blanket ban on visits between households.</p>

<p>In coronavirus developments today;</p>

<p>England, Wales and Scotland today posted 27 more Covid-19 deaths while Northern Ireland recorded none in the preliminary toll</p>

<p>Cases as of yesterday </p>

<p>The official Government death toll is usually updated about 4pm. It also provides how many cases have been diagnosed in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland give their own reports of new cases, and have done so already today; Wales reported 389 and Northern Ireland 17. </p>

<p>Scotland today announced its highest daily rise in positive coronavirus cases, with a total of 486 people testing positive in the past 24 hours.  </p>

<p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave the latest coronavirus figures a day after announcing new restrictions to combat the rise in cases.</p>

<p>From Friday, measures banning people from visiting other households will come into force and pubs and restaurants will be required to close by 10pm.</p>

<p>Speaking during the Scottish Government's daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the rise in cases is a 'real cause for concern' that underlines 'why we took very decisive and very tough action' to try to get the virus back under control.</p>

<p>She added: 'That is the highest number of positive cases we have ever recorded in a single day. However for context it must be remembered that many more people are being tested now than was the case in the spring.'   </p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday announced a wave of new restrictions designed to stop the spread of coronavirus, but did not include a ban on household mixing.</p>

<p>He imposed a 10pm curfew on pubs, bars and restaurants across England from tomorrow, extended rules on the mandatory wearing of face coverings and also urged workers to work from home where they can.</p>

<p>Members of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the curfew would not be enough to slow the rate of infection.</p>

<p>And they said the crackdown on households meeting needed to come 'sooner rather than later' as they warned ministers risked repeating the 'mistake' made back in March when they 'didn't react quick enough' to rising case numbers. </p>

<p>It was claimed that Professor Chris Whitty has told Mr Johnson that England will likely have to follow Scotland's lead in banning visits between separate households. </p>

<p>Ms Sturgeon then piled the pressure on Mr Johnson to go further as she said the expert advice she received was that a curfew on pubs alone would not be sufficient to halt rising case numbers.   </p>

<p>But Mr Johnson has insisted his approach was based on trying to 'balance saving lives with protecting jobs and livelihoods'. </p>

<p>Dominic Raab today warned the UK 'could end up in a national lockdown' if Mr Johnson's new coronavirus crackdown fails to get the disease under control.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary said a second shutdown 'is what we want to avoid' but the nuclear option remains in the Government's 'arsenal' if all else fails.</p>

<p>Mr Raab said he hoped 'if everyone plays by the rules' then the nation will be able to go into the Christmas period without a national lockdown being imposed.</p>

<p>He also defended the Government's plans to allow the police to ask the Army for help in order to boost Covid-19 enforcement.</p>

<p>Mr Raab said military personnel could be drafted in to 'relieve capacity' and allow officers to concentrate on enforcing rules as he dismissed claims that soldiers will be patrolling the streets as 'scaremongering'.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary's intervention came as critics blasted the Government for seemingly failing to take any of the responsibility for the spike in cases despite ministers presiding over numerous chaotic U-turns and policy changes in recent months.</p>

<p>Tory MPs said the Government's handling of the crisis has been a 'total shambles' and that repeated shifts in official guidance had left many people across the country confused as to what the rules actually are.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson hit back at PMQs this lunchtime as he said the Government's latest crackdown was informed by data from NHS Test and Trace which showed 'in granular detail where the epidemic is breaking out, exactly which groups are being infected'.</p>

<p>He said: 'That's why we've been able to deliver the local lockdowns and that's why we're able to tell at this stage that it is necessary to take the decisive action we are… to drive the virus down, keep kids in school and keep our economy moving.' </p>
