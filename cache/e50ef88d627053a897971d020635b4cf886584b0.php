<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rebekah Vardy has been confirmed as the latest star set to appear in Dancing on Ice in 2021.</p>

<p>The WAG, 38, gushed that she was 'so ready' for the glam squad as she prepared to take on the rink.</p>

<p>Rebekah - who is married to Leicester City player Jamie Vardy - is set to head-to-head with Coleen Rooney in a court battle, after she was accused to selling stories about her. </p>

<p>Exciting: Rebekah Vardy has been confirmed as the latest star set to appear in Dancing on Ice in 2021</p>

<p>It comes after British Olympians Colin Jackson and Graham Bell both confirmed they're set to compete on the upcoming series next year.</p>

<p>Former sprint and hurdling athlete Colin, 53, and veteran skiing ace Graham, 54, announced the news during a joint appearance on BBC Breakfast on Saturday. </p>

<p>Talking to hosts John Kay and Sally Nugent, five time Olympic skier Graham said: 'Ice doesn't scare me, it's the dancing, whereas I know you can dance, Colin.'</p>

<p>Heading for the ice: (L-R) British Olympians Colin Jackson and Graham Bell have confirmed they're set to compete on the upcoming series of Dancing On Ice next year</p>

<p>He admitted the extent of his dancing experience was confined to 'dancing on tables, wearing ski boots in après ski. It's not graceful and elegant!'</p>

<p>Graham joked that Colin might be so competitive, saying: 'Colin's probably called up Katrina Witt and flown her over from Germany and hired her as a private coach!'</p>

<p>The two sportsmen know each other well, with Graham telling the hosts: 'Colin is an excellent pupil because I actually coached him on Ski Sunday in 2007 and he's one of the trainees that takes on information so well.'</p>

<p>Athlete: Welsh-born Colin is a decorated former sprint and hurdling athlete. Pictured in 1997</p>

<p>Whilst he no doubt believes Colin to be a big contender, the seasoned skier did admit that the 'transferable skills of edge control, balance' in his sport would be useful on the ice.</p>

<p>For his part, Colin said of preparations: 'The first thing for us all is to get used to our boots. I don't know if you've tried ice skating boots but they are pretty tight so we've got to get our feet in there and start getting used to balancing on them.</p>

<p>'We won't get onto the ice fully until the middle of October.'</p>

<p>Veteran Olympian: Graham competed for Great Britain throughout the 1980s and '90s at five winter Olympics. Pictured in 2008</p>

<p>He added: 'I can do a little bit of skating. I think with sport in itself you've certainly got a bit of balance and that will be transferable in this circumstance. How much dancing we'll do, who knows? We'll see how the choreography goes.'</p>

<p>The star went on to say: 'I'm going to try and that's the most important thing. You go out there, you enjoy yourself and you learn a new skill and to hone the skill of skating will just be a huge, huge plus. I'm looking forward to it.'</p>

<p>Presenter Sally Nugent asked the two who they thought might be strong competition in the 2021 line up that she said 'has got to be one of the best in recent times'.</p>

<p>Graham responded that 'Jason Donovan is obviously a big performer' and Colin added: 'Denise Van Outen can dance, she's obviously been in musicals.' </p>

<p>Make way: On Friday, Capital Radio DJ Sonny Jay was confirmed as the sixth celebrity to take part in the forthcoming series of Dancing on Ice</p>

<p>Their announcement comes one day after Capital Radio DJ Sonny Jay was confirmed as the sixth celebrity to take part in the forthcoming series. </p>

<p>Sonny, 27, broke the news to listeners on Friday morning while presenting  his daily breakfast show that he hosts alongside Roman Kemp and Sian Welby. </p>

<p>Sonny teased his co-hosts during the show with clues including scarves, face glitter and playing the This Morning theme tune - hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield also present Dancing On Ice - before finally making the announcement.  </p>

<p>He said: 'I'm going to be doing Dancing on Ice! I'm so excited, I don't know how I kept it a secret.' </p>

<p>Surprise: Sonny broke the news to listeners on Friday morning while presenting his daily breakfast show that he hosts alongside Roman Kemp and Sian Welby</p>

<p>Co-host Roman, who had no idea his colleague had signed up for the show, added: 'We were talking about it.. we've been talking about Denise Van Outen and Jason Donovan. Move them aside, Sonny's gonna win this!'  </p>

<p>With Roman also pointing out that he might take a tumble or two on the ice, Sonny admitted he was keen to avoid making a fool of himself in front of the viewing public. </p>

<p>He said: 'I don't want to fall over, not in front of the nation. I don't want to be a meme the next day!'</p>

<p>The presenter revealed he's apprehensive about rehearsals because he'll be performing in front of solid, experienced dancers - as well as celebrated skaters Jane Torvill and Christopher Dean - when the show returns. </p>

<p>Clues: Sonny teased his co-hosts during the show with clues including scarves, face glitter and playing the This Morning theme tune before finally making the announcement</p>

<p>'I start training next month,' he said. 'It comes back to ITV next year, Torvill and Dean, Ashley Banjo and John Barrowman are going to be the judges, which I’m a little bit nervous about because they’re wicked dancers.' </p>

<p>Following the announcement Sonny was treated to a handful of recorded good luck messages from celebrity pals, among them Sam Smith. </p>

<p>Congratulating the presenter, Sam said:  'Hi Sonny, good luck for Dancing on Ice! I think you need to watch I, Tonya and get your spin on!'  </p>

<p>Welcoming Sonny to the show, Christopher Dean added: 'Hi Sonny, welcome to Dancing on Ice! I hope you’re ready to swap those headphones for headbangers. See you soon.' </p>

<p>Get your skates on! Coronation Street star Faye Brookes (L) and former Neighbours star Jason Donovan (R) have been confirmed as the fourth and fifth Dancing On Ice contestant</p>

<p>The announcement comes after Coronation Street's Faye Brookes and former Neighbours star Jason Donovan  were confirmed for Dancing On Ice.</p>

<p>Faye, 33, confirmed her involvement in the show during Thursday's edition of Lorraine, while Jason, 52, revealed he was taking part while appearing on This Morning with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby.   </p>

<p>Looking ahead to the show, Faye said: 'I'm so excited! We had to review the basic, we were filmed too. </p>

<p>'The producers get to know you and this is the first time I think people are just going to see me, not being a character… Just being me – Faye!'  </p>

<p>Announcement! The actress, who left the cobbles in 2019, now joins Denise Van Outen, Myleene Klass and Joe-Warren Plant as competitors on the ice rink</p>

<p>The official Dancing On Ice Instagram also confirmed the news and added a statement from the actress, which said: 'I'm a trained dancer, but attempting to put something I already know very well on skates is quite scary!' </p>

<p>During her interview with Lorraine Kelly, Faye also admitted that she already has a 'little' experience as her father used to play ice hockey.</p>

<p>She confessed: 'I have a little, I might be Bambi but my dad used to play ice hockey so we did that often. There were no official lessons but we had fun as a weekend activity.'</p>

<p>Her role: Faye left Coronation Street in 2019 after four years of playing Kate Connor on the cobbles (pictured in soap still) </p>

<p>Discussing how the show will be filmed with current guidelines amid the coronavirus crisis, Faye explained: 'They are taking all the precautions, we're just going to have to be safe and careful. </p>

<p>'I'm going to be in a bubble with my pro partner who I still don't know. It's nerve-wracking but still so excited. We need to make sure we'll be keeping everyone safe.'</p>

<p>Faye, who was previously engaged to Gareth Gates, sweetly gushed that she has loved having her personal trainer boyfriend, Joe Davis, by her side during training.</p>

<p>The soap star's ex Gareth, 36, appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2008 where he finished in fourth place with professional skater Maria Filippov. He also appeared on the 2014 show and finished in seventh place with Brianne Delcourt. </p>

<p>Exciting: Appearing on Thursday's episode of Lorraine to announce the news, Faye said: 'I'm so excited! We had to review the basic, we were filmed too.' </p>

<p>She added: 'The producers get to know you and this is the first time I think people are just going to see me, not being a character… Just being me – Faye!'</p>

<p>She said: 'Ice skating is an Olympic sport, but I'm up for the challenge. Having Joe by my side training has just been the cherry on the cake.'</p>

<p>Faye also revealed that she will be asking for advice from former Coronation Street co-star Brooke Vincent who appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2018.</p>

<p>She joked: 'As soon as this interview is over I can contact them but I've obviously had to keep this to myself. It's the biggest secret I've kept in my life! </p>

<p>'I saw Brooke yesterday and I was desperate to tell her but I thought one more day and I'll be able to. She'll be my first text message after I've finished this interview.' </p>

<p>Experience: During her interview with Lorraine Kelly, Faye also admitted that she already has a 'little' experience as her father used to play ice hockey</p>

<p>Pals: Faye also revealed that she will be asking for advice from former Coronation Street co-star Brooke Vincent who appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2018 </p>

<p>Faye left Coronation Street in 2019 after four years of playing Kate Connor on the cobbles. </p>

<p>Discussing whether she would return, the soap star admitted: 'It's been a year since I've left Corrie. </p>

<p>'I would love to go back and loved my time there, they'll be very shocked by the news but now we can celebrate and look forward to creating something magical.' </p>

<p>Opening up: Jason - who previously took part in Strictly Come Dancing - admitted he is well aware the ice is "not that forgiving" as he discussed his own involvement in the show</p>

<p>Meanwhile Neighbours star Jason - who previously took part in Strictly Come Dancing - admitted he is well aware the ice is "not that forgiving". </p>

<p>Speaking to Dancing on Ice co-hosts Phil and Holly on This Morning, he said: 'I think it's a little bit different than Strictly because that's really defined by the moves that you do. </p>

<p>'Skating is very much the flow and the rhythm of being on the ice. Let's be honest, ice is not that forgiving, and I am 52. I know I look pretty good for it, but that could all change.' </p>

<p>Let's talk: The Australian star spoke to Dancing on Ice co-hosts Phil and Holly on Thursday's edition of This Morning</p>

<p>When Phil joked that Jason would've been "unlikely to smash [his] teeth in" on Strictly like he possibly could on Dancing on Ice, the actor said: 'Thanks for that, Phil. That's a load of encouragement for me.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I've done a little bit of skating in my youth in Australia, surprisingly, in the heat of an Australian summer. I've surfed, I've skied a lot. I guess you bring a little bit of that sort of confidence. </p>

<p>'Doing that in front of five, six, or seven million people is probably a little bit of a difference. To be able to learn a skill and spend some time focused is quite exciting, and I'm looking forward to seeing you guys.'</p>

<p>So far, other stars confirmed for the show include Emmerdale's Joe-Warren Plant, Denise Van Outen and Myleene Klass. </p>

<p>Sweet: Faye, who was previously engaged to Gareth Gates, sweetly gushed that she has loved having her personal trainer boyfriend, Joe Davis (pictured), by her side during training</p>

<p>Twice on the ice! The soap star's ex Gareth, 36, appeared on Dancing On Ice in 2008 where he finished in fourth place with professional skater Maria Filippov. He also appeared on the 2014 show and finished in seventh place with Brianne Delcourt (pictured) </p>

<p>The Loose Women panellists revealed that Denise, 46, would be appearing on Dancing On Ice on Wednesday's show. </p>

<p>However panellist Linda, 62, sadly pipped her to the post by confirming that she is headed to the ice before the big reveal. </p>

<p>By means of hinting, the Loose Women panel opened an array of envelopes including a picture pf Denise Welch, a transit van, and a breakfast fry up - to mark her time on The Big Breakfast - but Linda accidentally barked: 'Van Outen!'</p>

<p>Despite the gaffe, Denise spoke on the show about her new role and her daughter Betsy, 10, saying: 'I'm really excited. Finally, I get to tell people. I've kept this a secret from most of my friends and family. Betsy doesn't even know....</p>

<p>Yay! The Loose Women panellists revealed that Denise, 46, would be appearing on Dancing On Ice on Wednesday's show</p>

<p>'She's at school, so she's going to find out this afternoon when I pick her up from school.. She will be so excited. She loves the show and we watch it every year...</p>

<p>'Literally, I cannot stand up on ice. Every time I've taken Betsy around on a rink I've been the one on the penguin.' </p>

<p>Last month, it was reported that Denise has signed up to the upcoming series as a contestant in a staggering £40,000 deal. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, Dancing On Ice hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield announced on Tuesday's This Morning that Joe-Warren would be a contestant and teased that they already knew who his partner will be.   </p>

<p>The actor, who plays Jacob Gallagher on the soap, said he was 'excited' about the prospect of appearing on the show, as he revealed his character will be taking a six month break from the ITV soap.</p>

<p>Revealed! Joe Warren-Plant has been confirmed as the second star to sign up to the next series of Dancing On Ice, which will take place in the new year</p>

<p>Denise and Joe-Warren, who has been dating model girlfriend Nicole Hadlow since 2017, joins the previously announced Myleene Klass.</p>

<p>All twelve will skate in the hopes of mastering the ice when the competition commences in the new year.</p>

<p>Phillip and Holly will once again return to present the show and the expert panel of Jane Torvill and Christopher Dean, John Barrowman and Ashley Banjo will all resume their roles as judges.</p>

<p>So far, Faye  tops the betting with the bookies at 5/2, while Denise Van Outen is just behind at 5/1.</p>
