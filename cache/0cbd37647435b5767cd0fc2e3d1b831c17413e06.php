<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Frank Lampard looks to have finally found a solution to his goalkeeping woes after Edouard Mendy made an impressive start to his Chelsea career against Tottenham.</p>

<p>Mendy was handed his first start in the fourth-round Carabao Cup tie after completing a £22million move from Rennes last week and produced a fine stop from Sergio Reguilon.</p>

<p>The 'keeper had one nervy moment when he dropped a cross in the second half but was powerless to do anything about Erik Lamela's late equaliser for the home side.</p>

<p>Edouard Mendy impressed as he made his Chelsea debut against Tottenham on Tuesday</p>

<p>Frank Lampard said he was very pleased with the goalkeeper's commanding performance </p>

<p>The 28-year-old's debut ended with a penalty shoot-out and while he was unable to keep out any of Spurs' spot-kicks, Lampard insisted he was delighted with his new signing's first outing.</p>

<p>'I thought he was very good,' said the Chelsea boss after his side's League Cup exit.</p>

<p>'He made a couple of good saves, one particularly good save.</p>

<p>The goalkeeper was called into action a number of times and made some impressive stops</p>

<p>But the 28-year-old was unable to keep out any of Tottenham's penalties in the shoot-out</p>

<p>'He came and caught a few balls, even the one where he came and didn't catch, the idea that he wants to be positive is not a bad thing. Very, very pleased with every part of his game, really.' </p>

<p>Mendy looks set to make his first Premier League start against Crystal Palace on Saturday with neither Kepa Arrizabalaga or Willy Caballero doing enough to convince Lampard they should play.</p>

<p>Kepa was dropped for the Blues' draw with West Brom after mistakes against Brighton and Liverpool.</p>

<p>But Caballero did not cover himself in much glory as Chelsea conceded three first-half goals at the Hawthorns.</p>

<p>Lampard will hope Mendy can become his settled first choice 'keeper with the Blues looking to get back to winning ways at Stamford Bridge this weekend. </p>

<p>Mendy looks set to make his first league start ahead of Kepa Arizzabalaga and Willy Caballero</p>
