<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>To say that Ratched, the new series from Ryan Murphy – the man behind Nip/Tuck, Glee and American Horror Story – is not for the faint-hearted is an understatement. </p>

<p>Nurse Ratched, the stone-hearted head nurse at the psychiatric hospital in Ken Kesey’s 1962 novel One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, embodied the sadistic petty tyrant. </p>

<p>When director Milos Forman began casting the 1975 film version, the idea of portraying the character was regarded as so thankless a task that five top actresses, including Anne Bancroft, Angela Lansbury and Ellen Burstyn, turned it down before the relatively unknown Louise Fletcher accepted it – and won a Best Actress Oscar as a result.</p>

<p>A new Netflix series staring Sarah Paulson explores the origin story of nurse Ratched, from Ken Kesey’s 1962 novel One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest. Pictured: Sarah as as Mildred Ratched</p>

<p>Fast-forward almost half a century, and Murphy has cooked up an origin story for Nurse Ratched, taking her from a troubled young nurse to the monster who would torment Jack Nicholson’s character RP McMurphy in the film, eventually having him lobotomised.</p>

<p>The Netflix series, set in the late 40s, some 15 years before the book, starts with the brutal (and graphically depicted) murder of a houseful of Catholic priests. </p>

<p>The killer, Edmund Tolleson, is taken to Lucia State Hospital, a fictional mental institution in California where dapper psychiatrist Dr Hanover inflicts hellish treatments on his patients in the name of science, and where a newly arrived nurse called Mildred Ratched is quietly following an agenda of her own while battling demons from her past.</p>

<p>‘The show is a character study of loneliness,’ says Sarah Paulson (best known for her roles in Mrs America and The People V OJ Simpson), who plays the young nurse. </p>

<p>‘Mildred Ratched has lived a very lonely, traumatised, abused life that has created in her a way of thinking that may not be the most healthy.</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to make her out not to be a villain because by the time One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest happens, she’s the villain, no question. But as an actress, I had to find a way to align myself with her. </p>

<p>'Midway through the series we learn about things that happened to her that give some context to what people in desperate circumstances will find themselves doing. </p>

<p>'It was interesting to peel away those earlier views I’d had of the character – having done so I don’t think of her as a monster. She does monstrous things, but I think she’d say she’s doing them for her own survival.’</p>

<p>Sarah agrees the shoes of Louise Fletcher were very daunting ones to fill. </p>

<p>‘She put Nurse Ratched up there with Hannibal Lecter as one of the all-time greatest cinematic villains, so no pressure or anything!’ she laughs.</p>

<p>‘I did feel like this was a big piece to bite off, because I could really mess it up if I did it wrong.’</p>

<p>She says she took some of her performance from Louise’s. ‘In terms of how I stood, the way I held my hands and that thing of the character trying to maintain a sense of control of her own rage and sorrow. </p>

<p>Sarah revealed her performance of nurse Ratched was inspired by Louise Fletcher. Pictured: Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson in the film</p>

<p>'But in the end I had to approach it as I would any character and think, “Who is she, what does she want, what’s in her way and how’s she going to get it?” That’s all you can do.’</p>

<p>Sharon Stone appears alongside Sarah as Lenore Osgood, an eccentric heiress with a pet monkey and a single-minded mission to get revenge on Dr Hanover for a horrific experimental treatment he executed on her son. ‘</p>

<p>Any mother will fight tooth and nail for her child,’ says Sharon.</p>

<p>She drew on her own emotions when her ex-husband, newspaper editor Phil Bronstein, was temporarily granted custody of their son Roan.</p>

<p>Now 20, Roan is back living with his mother and younger brothers Laird and Quinn, but Sharon admits the pain of it will live with her forever. </p>

<p>‘There’s nothing you wouldn’t do for your kid, you’d take a bullet for him. So when this nightmarish event happens to Lenore’s child she just loses it.’ </p>

<p>Rather more down-to-earth is Sex And The City’s Cynthia Nixon as Gwendolyn Briggs, a political press secretary who’s hiding the fact she’s a lesbian.</p>

<p>Cynthia, who is married to educational activist Christine Marinoni, says, ‘As I was preparing to play Gwendolyn, I returned to a character I’ve long been fascinated by – journalist Lorena Hickok, who was Eleanor Roosevelt’s lover [Cynthia played the First Lady in 2005 film Warm Springs].</p>

<p>‘They were deeply in love, but that was a bridge too far back then, particularly for the First Lady of the United States. </p>

<p>Lorena was a gay woman living in a very masculine world, and I shared a lot of photos of her with the costume designers.’</p>

<p>While Gwendolyn favours slouchy, androgynous clothes, the rest of the female cast are in full 40s glamour, with form-fitting dresses and bright colours. All the better, says Cynthia, to emphasise the disturbing subject matter. </p>

<p>‘My son said it was so creepy; it wasn’t black and white and laden with shadows, it was in terrifying Technicolor! </p>

<p>'It’s one of the compelling things about it – it takes that late 40s, early 50s saturated colour and brightness, so it looks like an MGM musical. But we’re not singing and dancing, we’re killing people.’  </p>

<p>Ratched is on Netflix from Friday.</p>
