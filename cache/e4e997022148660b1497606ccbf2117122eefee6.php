<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A British tourist has bragged about making a tube of Pringles last 'four hours' so he could avoid wearing a face mask on his flight to Tenerife.</p>

<p>Holidaymaker Michael Richards, 41, bought the tube of salt and vinegar Pringles on board the easyJet flight and nibbled on one every two-and-a-half minutes.</p>

<p>He later boasted on Facebook he had avoided wearing his 'uncomfortable' mask for the entire journey except for ten minutes during a toilet break and to put his suitcase in the overhead compartment.</p>

<p>Alongside a picture of a tube of Pringles and a disposable coffee cup, he wrote: 'You can take your mask off while eating and drinking on the plane.</p>

<p>'Can't believe I made those Pringles last four hours. That's one pringle every two-and-a-half minutes.' </p>

<p>Holidaymaker Michael Richards (pictured), 41, bought the tube of salt and vinegar Pringles on board the easyJet flight and nibbled on one every two-and-a-half minutes</p>

<p>He later boasted on Facebook (pictured) he had avoided wearing his 'uncomfortable' mask for the entire journey except for ten minutes during a toilet break and to put his suitcase in the overhead compartment</p>

<p>Mr Richards travelled from his home in Huddersfield to Tenerife South Airport with his wife Della Richards, 37, and their two children Sapphire Richards, six, and Zarina Richards, 10, on Tuesday, August 25, for two weeks in the sun. </p>

<p>It's currently against easyJet's flight regulations for customers to travel without wearing a mask. </p>

<p>But Mr Richards said: 'I thought I'd take my time eating these Pringles to see how long they'd last, and I kept nibbling away, but it was hard because once you pop you can't stop, you know.</p>

<p>'When we landed, I Googled how many Pringles were in a tube and it's about 100 Pringles, then I divided that by the time of the flight and that's one per two and a half minutes.</p>

<p>Alongside a picture of a tube of Pringles and a disposable coffee cup, he wrote: 'You can take your mask off while eating and drinking on the plane'</p>

<p>'So if you sat there munching, you can pretty much get through a whole flight without wearing a mask.'</p>

<p>Mr Richards said he hadn't planned on not wearing a mask but wanted to test whether he would get away with it for the entire flight.  </p>

<p>Some users commented to say how impressed they were he had managed to get away with it.</p>

<p>One said: 'Good idea. I'm doing this next time.' </p>

<p>One commented: 'My husband did similar but he had more than Pringles.'</p>

<p>However, one concerned user wrote: 'Glad I was not on that plane.'</p>

<p>Mr Richards said the criticism didn't bother him because 'they're sitting at home in the UK in rainy weather and we're sunning it up in Tenerife'.</p>

<p>Mr Richards travelled from his home in Huddersfield to Tenerife South Airport with his wife Della Richards, 37, and their two children Sapphire Richards, six, and Zarina Richards, 10, on Tuesday, August 25, for two weeks in the sun</p>

<p>Although he doesn't like wearing masks, he said he understands why they're needed and wears them in shops. </p>

<p>Masks are a requirement in many countries amid coronavirus because they are thought to reduce the chance of spreading the disease through particles released during a cough or sneeze.</p>

<p>'People don't like wearing masks, and even the air hostesses said they don't like wearing masks, but we all know we've got to wear them,' Mr Richards added.</p>

<p>'I'm not anti-mask or anything and I've been wearing them on holiday and at home, in shops, so I'm all for looking after people.</p>

<p>Some users commented to say how impressed they were he had managed to get away with it</p>

<p>'It was just a bit of a light-hearted go at the mask subject, really, because there's so much depression in the world now, people like to be uplifted.'</p>

<p>An EasyJet spokesman said no other passengers had complained Mr Richards was not wearing a mask on the flight.</p>

<p>They added: 'Passengers receive clear communications before they travel and via announcements onboard to ensure they are aware that, in line with new guidelines, they are required to wear a face mask onboard except when eating or drinking.</p>

<p>'Whilst our cabin crew will always try to be vigilant to ensure that passengers comply with the requirement to wear a mask, no issues were raised with the crew about this passenger's behaviour during the flight.</p>

<p>'It is the responsibility of all onboard to adhere to these measures for the health and safety of everyone onboard.'</p>
