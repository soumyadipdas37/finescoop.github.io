<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A teenager has been found guilty of stabbing to death an Aston Villa youth player after a row erupted when his friend 'tried it on' with the footballer's girlfriend at a house party.</p>

<p>Sukhbir Singh-Phull, 18, plunged a blade into the chest of Premier League starlet Ramani Morgan, 16, after a row broke out in the street on February 29.</p>

<p>A court heard the pair clashed after Phull's friend had 'tried it on' with Ramani's girlfriend at the party in Coventry.</p>

<p>Ramani was rushed to hospital with multiple stab wounds after being brutally attacked but was pronounced dead just before midnight.</p>

<p>Phull and a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went on trial accused of murder at Warwick Crown Court.</p>

<p>Sukhbir Singh-Phull (left), 18, was today found guilty at Warwick Crown Court of stabbing to death Aston Villa youth player Ramani Morgan (right), 16, at a house party in Coventry on February 29</p>

<p>Today, Phull was found guilty of murder and faces life in prison while the youth was cleared of the same charge by a jury.</p>

<p>Phull, of Binley Road, Coventry, will be sentenced at a later date.</p>

<p>The trial had heard how a fight broke out between Phull and Ramani after his co-defendant had started flirting with the victim's girlfriend.</p>

<p>He had also earlier turned down an alcoholic drink made by his alleged killers over fears it may have been spiked.</p>

<p>The girl hosting the house party later kicked everyone out as she was afraid the property was going to get 'trashed'.</p>

<p>At that point, Phull whispered something in Ramani's ear and told him to 'step outside' where a fight then broke out in the street.</p>

<p>The teenager was stabbed four times - including through the cheek and once in the chest - before he collapsed in a pool of blood after trying to run away.</p>

<p>Ramani, who played for the youth teams of Villa and Walsall, could not be saved despite an air ambulance doctor briefly managing to revive him at the scene.</p>

<p>When the teenagers were arrested the next day, officers found the North Face jacket Phull was wearing, with Ramani's blood on it, at the 17-year-old's home.</p>

<p>He answered 'no comment' in police interviews before eventually being charged with murder. </p>

<p>Ramani's family said in a statement after the verdict: 'No sentence will ever be enough and nothing can bring Ramani back or ease our pain.</p>

<p>'We do not want something like this to happen to another family. A clear message needs to be sent out so no other family should go through what we have gone through.'</p>

<p>The family previously said in a tribute: 'Ramani was so kind, caring, and humble and had a beautiful soul.</p>

<p>'He had the potential of becoming a professional footballer. Ramani had many hopes and dreams and he had his whole life ahead of him.</p>

<p>'Ramani was the best son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin anyone could ever wish for. Ramani was loved by everyone that knew him.'</p>
