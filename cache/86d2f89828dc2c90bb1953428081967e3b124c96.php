<p>The four oldest brothers and sisters were returning to Prince Charles's alma mater Hill House, where fees range from £14,400 for infants to £18,000 for sixth formers. </p>

<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg's children, in descending order, are Peter, 12, Mary, 11, Thomas, ten, Anselm, eight, and Alfred, out in front, four.</p>

<p>And it was the first day at the school in London's Knightsbridge for Alfred, while the youngest brother, Sixtus, three, remains at the family home for now.</p>

<p>Tweeting a photograph of his brood yesterday, Mr Rees-Mogg said: 'The holidays are over and my five older children certainly need, and want, to be at school.'</p>
