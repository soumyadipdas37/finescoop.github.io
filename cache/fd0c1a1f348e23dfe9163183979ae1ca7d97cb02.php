<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The captain of a duck boat which sank in Missouri in a tragedy which killed 17 people two years ago is set to have charges against him dropped. </p>

<p>Kenneth Scott McKee was indicted on charges of misconduct and negligence after the July 2018 disaster in Table Rock Lake. </p>

<p>McKee was accused of disregarding weather warnings and failing to head for shore when a storm arrived, causing the amphibious vessel to fill with water and sink.  </p>

<p>But the federal case is set to be dropped on technical grounds after magistrate David P. Rush ruled that the lake is not a 'navigable waterway' and therefore not covered by US maritime law. </p>

<p>Instead, Rush has recommended that the case be dealt with in Missouri state court, according to ABC News.   </p>

<p>Kenneth Scott McKee (pictured) was indicted on charges of misconduct and negligence after the July 2018 tragedy in Table Rock Lake</p>

<p>There were 31 passengers aboard the duck boat when hurricane-strength winds sank the craft, causing one of America's deadliest tourist tragedies in recent years.</p>

<p>Nine members of the same family, the Colemans, were among 17 people killed when the fierce winds churned up the water in Table Rock Lake, near Branson. </p>

<p>They ranged in age from one-year-old Arya Coleman to the oldest victim Ervin Coleman, 76.</p>

<p>Five of the dead were aged 15 or younger, with the victims coming from Missouri, Indiana, Illinois and Arkansas.</p>

<p>Tia Coleman, one of two survivors in the family along with her nephew, said McKee had told passengers they 'won't need' life jackets. </p>

<p>McKee was indicted in November 2018, with prosecutors accusing him of negligence and misconduct while piloting the vessel Stretch Duck 7. </p>

<p>The captain 'failed to properly assess incoming weather prior to entering the vessel on the water' despite lightning in the area, the indictment claimed. </p>

<p>He also allegedly 'failed to instruct passengers to don personal flotation devices' and 'failed to immediately increase speed and head to the nearest shore'. </p>

<p>McKee, who denied the charges, faced a possible 10-year sentence for each of the 17 counts in the indictment as well as a $250,000 fine. </p>

<p>The magistrate's recommendation to drop the charges against McKee is not yet final and is pending a scheduled hearing.  </p>

<p>Last year, charges were unsealed against Curtis Lanham, the general manager of Ride The Ducks Branson, and Charles Baltzell, the operations supervisor.  </p>

<p>Lanham was accused in the indictment of failing to establish training and policies for monitoring for severe weather.</p>

<p>The duck boat that sank in Table Rock Lake near Branson, Mo is raised after it went down on the evening of July 19, 2018 </p>

<p>The indictment said Lanham helped create 'a work atmosphere on Stretch Duck 7 and other duck boats where the concern for profit overshadowed the concern for safety.' </p>

<p>Baltzell was accused of failing to properly monitor the weather, not even being on the same floor where radar viewing screens were located. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, the National Transportation Safety Board released its findings and said operator Ride The Ducks should have suspended operations in severe weather. </p>

<p>The Coast Guard was also criticized for failing to follow recommendations to improve the safety of duck boats.  </p>

<p>Duck boats, with wheels allowing them to drive on city roads but which can also travel on water, are popular with tourists in many US cities.</p>

<p>However, they have been linked to more than 40 deaths since 1999, including separate accidents in Seattle and Philadelphia. </p>

<p>Robert Mongeluzzi, whose firm represents nearly two dozen people who were aboard the Missouri boat, called for duck boats to be scrapped altogether.</p>

<p>'Duck boats are death traps which, when flooded, become sinking coffins,' Mongeluzzi said. </p>

<p>'The Coast Guard and duck boat industry have the blood of these Branson victims on their hands for continuing to ignore the warnings. Hopefully this time, they will listen.'</p>

<p>Seventeen people were killed on July 19 when a Ride the Ducks duck boat capsized during a severe storm over the Table Rock Lake in Branson, Missouri.</p>

<p>Among them were a hero grandmother, a 'community legend' football coach and a recently baptized 15-year-old boy. </p>

<p>Nine members of one family were also killed, with another two managing to survive the horrific ordeal. </p>

<p> THE COLEMAN FAMILY </p>

<p>Nine of the 11 members of the Coleman family who boarded the boat on were killed, including four children under the age of 10.</p>

<p>Horace 'Butch' Coleman, 70, the family patriarch, was remembered on social media as a 'community legend', who spent more than 40 years volunteering in his local area.</p>

<p>His wife, Belinda Coleman, 69, and his brother, Irving Raymond Coleman, 76, were also killed, as were Belinda's cousins, Angela Coleman, 45, and Glenn Coleman, 40.</p>

<p>Angela's two-year-old son Maxwell died in the tragic accident, as did Glenn's sons Evan, 7, and Reece, 9, and his one-year-old daughter Arya.</p>

<p>STEVE AND LANCE SMITH</p>

<p>Christian church deacon Steve Smith, 53, and his 15-year-old son Lance also drowned when the boat capsized on Thursday.</p>

<p>Smith's daughter, Loren, survived, and his wife Pamela was not on the boat.</p>

<p>A family friend wrote on Twitter Pamela had decided to go shopping instead of joining her family on board the doomed boat.</p>

<p>Church deacon Steve Smith (left) and his recently baptized 15-year-old son Lance (pictured in last known photo of him, right) were among those killed. Steve's daughter Loren was taken to hospital, but survived</p>

<p>BILL ASHER AND ROSE HAMMAN</p>

<p>Bill Asher, 69, and his girlfriend Rose Hamman, 68, were also identified as among the dead by friends on Facebook on Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Bill and Rose had been on a week-long holiday in Branson, and had spent their last evening away on the duck boat, friend Mary Ogborn Kientzy said. </p>

<p>LESLIE DENNISON</p>

<p>Grandmother Leslie Dennison, 64, was on the boat with her 12-year-old granddaughter Alicia. </p>

<p>Her son Todd said on Thursday his daughter, who is recovering in hospital, said she could feel Leslie pushing her up as the boat filled with water.</p>

<p>'She said her grandmother saved her,' he told the paper. Leslie is being mourned as a 'true hero'.</p>

<p>ROBERT 'BOB' WILLIAMS</p>

<p>Robert 'Bob' Williams, 73, was driving the boat when it went down in Table Rock Lake.</p>

<p>Williams worked for Ride the Ducks, the boat tour company which owned the vessel, but had previously worked as a pastor. </p>

<p>Friends and family paid tribute to him on Friday as a God-fearing family man.</p>
