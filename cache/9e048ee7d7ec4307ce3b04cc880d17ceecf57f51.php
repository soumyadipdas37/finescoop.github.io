<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nokia has secured a deal with BT to replace Huawei equipment in its EE network including replacing 2G, 4G infrastructure and expand the 5G network. </p>

<p>From the end of this year British operators won't be able to purchase 5G components from China's Huawei and have to remove existing equipment by 2027. </p>

<p>The Finnish company will install 63 per cent of the BT 5G infrastructure, potentially as many as 11,600 radio sites, according to sources familiar with the deal. </p>

<p>Nokia already powers BTs network in Greater London, the Midlands and some rural locations - so this deal extends that existing contract to much of the rest of the UK.    </p>

<p>The decision to ban Huawei from supplying 5G equipment in the UK came in July after US sanctions were introduced against the Chinese firm. </p>

<p>The UK network was an early target for Huawei, so its technology is firmly embedded, making removing it a complex job for Britain's mobile operators.</p>

<p>BT was a major customer, so this shift to Nokia will involve a considerable change including the purchase of new base stations and access points. </p>

<p>Philip Jansen, CEO, BT Group said digital connectivity was critical to the UKs economic future and would result in new jobs and underpin sustainable growth.</p>

<p>'That's why BT is making game-changing investments in full fibre and 5G. In a fast-moving and competitive market, it's critical we make the right technology choices. </p>

<p>'With this next stage of our successful relationship with Nokia we will continue to lead the rollout of fixed and mobile networks to deliver stand-out experiences for customers,' he said.</p>

<p>Nokia had a 21 per cent share of the global radio access network (RAN) market in 2019, versus 29 per cent for Ericsson and Huawei's 31 per cent.</p>

<p>While Nokia has been winning contracts from operators across the world, it suffered a setback earlier this month when it lost out to Samsung Electronics on a part of a contract to supply new 5G equipment to Verizon in the US.</p>

<p>Paolo Pescatore, a tech analyst described the deal as a 'big win for Nokia' given the competitive nature of the market for mobile infrastructure. </p>

<p>The decision to ban Huawei from supplying 5G equipment in the UK came in July after US sanctions were introduced against the Chinese firm</p>

<p>'It was important for BT (and EE) to move quickly to avoid loosing any further ground in 5G rollout,' he explained.</p>

<p>Adding that: 'A massive job now awaits in stripping out Huawei and ensuring minimal disruption to customers.'</p>

<p>Pekka Lundmark, President and CEO, Nokia, said the deal makes Nokia BT largest infrastructure partner, extending over 25 years of collaboration.</p>

<p>'We are proud to support BT's 5G network evolution and look forward to working even more closely together in the years to come.' </p>

<p>China's controversial telecommunications equipment maker Huawei openly supports the ruling Communist Party.</p>

<p>Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army (PLA) engineer, founded the company in 1987 and it has risen to rank among the world's top manufacturers of network equipment.</p>

<p>But his PLA service has led to concerns of close links with the Chinese military and government, which Huawei has consistently denied. </p>

<p>Huawei operates in 170 countries and the company says one third of the world's population communicate using its products in some way.</p>

<p>It is the world's second largest network equipment supplier behind Sweden's Ericsson, and has made a large push into consumer products such smartphones in recent years.</p>

<p>Fears around its capabilities to tap into sensitive information stem from rumours of backdoors in in the firm's software.</p>

<p>Although no such vulnerability has ever been found, allegations for their capabilities range from the ability to tap into encrypted data  to knocking out communications facilities.</p>

<p>The UK's National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, has not claimed to find evidence of such vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>However, intelligence experts say they can only provide limited assurances that the Chinese company is not a risk to broadband and phone networks in the UK.</p>
