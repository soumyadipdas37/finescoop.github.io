<p>Doting mum: Holly Willoughby shared five-year-old son Chester's letter to the tooth fairy after he lost his first pearly white on Friday (pictured with her kids Chester, Harry, and Belle)</p>

<p>Holly joked in response: 'Slight panic when Chester lost his first tooth today and could[n't] find it... I’m sure the tooth fairy will still come... [sic].'</p>

<p>As well as writing the note, Chester also drew a number of hearts as well as what appeared to be a tooth. </p>

<p>Holly shares Chester, son Harry, 11, and daughter Belle, nine, with her husband Dan Baldwin, who she has been married to for 13 years.</p>

<p>Adorable: Posting a picture of the note via Instagram on Friday, Chester wrote: 'To tooth fairy, I love my tooth today in the grass. Please can you still come. Love Chester'</p>

<p>Her post comes after Holly lamented the new 'six person rule' as England prepares to face updated coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections.</p>

<p>Talking on This Morning she asked whether she was going to have to choose between her mother Lynne, 71, or father Terry, on Christmas due to having a family of five.  </p>

<p>On Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'.  </p>

<p>New rules: Her post comes after Holly lamented the new 'six person rule' as England prepares to face updated coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections</p>

<p>Family: Talking on This Morning she asked if she was going to have to choose between her mother Lynne, 71, (pictured) or father Terry, due to having a family of five</p>

<p>Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. </p>

<p>Holly has three children - Harry, 11, Belle, nine, and Chester, five, with husband Dan Baldwin meaning just one of her parents would make up the 'six person rule'. </p>

<p>Discussing the new restrictions with Matthew Wright on This Morning, the ITV star said: 'A lot of people are thinking, "What will this mean for Christmas? What will Christmas look like?"</p>

<p>'It's going to be very awkward in my house as I'm a family-of-five, so I'll have to choose between my mum and dad on Christmas day!'  </p>

<p>To which Matthew, 55, replied: 'I'm feeling very confused and conflicted. The rules are different everywhere else in the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>'You can't have your parents over on Christmas Day but you can go on public transport? For the life of me, I can't make any sense of it.'</p>

<p>With Holly adding: 'I guess the other thought is how is anyone going to police these rules. The government are going to have marshals to monitor people.'</p>

<p>Conundrum: Holly has three children - Harry, 11, Belle, nine, and Chester, five, with husband Dan Baldwin meaning just one of her parents would make up the 'six person rule'</p>
