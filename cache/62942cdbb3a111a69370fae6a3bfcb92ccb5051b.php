<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ozark's Julia Garner won her second Emmy in a row on Sunday for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.</p>

<p>Garner, 26, delivered her acceptance speech at her house, where she sat next to her spouse, Foster the People front man Mark Foster.</p>

<p>Garner was up for the honors against a vaunted group that included Westworld's Thandie Newton, The Crown's Helena Bonham Carter, Big Little Lies stars Meryl Streep and Laura Dern, The Handmaid's Tale's Samira Wiley, Killing Eve's Fiona Shaw and Succession's Sarah Snook.</p>

<p>Big win: Ozark's Julia Garner, 26, won her second Emmy in a row on Sunday </p>

<p>The Riverdale, New York native said, 'First, I’m shocked, to be honest - I want to show gratitude to all the women in this category - you are the reason why I’m acting in the first place, so thank you.'</p>

<p>She also showed gratitude to her co-stars Jason Bateman and Laura Linney, saying they brought her 'under [their] wings and not only teaching me how to be a better actor but a person.'</p>

<p>Garner, who portrays Ruth Langmore on the Netflix hit Ozark, was clad in a silky top by Chanel Haute Couture and accessorized with pearls.</p>

<p>The acclaimed actress ended things with an optimistic message amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Beaming: delivered her acceptance speech at her house, where she sat next to her spouse, Foster the People front man Mark Foster</p>

<p>Stylish: Garner was clad in a silky top by Chanel Haute Couture and accessorized with pearls </p>

<p>'Let’s try to make this world better,' she said. 'There will be light at the end of the tunnel.'</p>

<p>She opened up to the outlet Gold Derby in 2019 about how the nuanced nature of the character appealed to her.</p>

<p>'The thing with Ruth is she’s so complex and I think that’s what I love so much about this character and why I wanted to play her, how complex she was. That was one of the reasons why I wanted to play Ruth. </p>

<p>Garner said, 'First, I’m shocked, to be honest - I want to show gratitude to all the women in this category - you are the reason why I’m acting in the first place, so thank you'</p>

<p>The acclaimed actress had an optimistic message amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying, 'There will be light at the end of the tunnel' </p>

<p>She credited the show's writing staff for being 'good at planning things out ... and making the characters evolve, in a way.</p>

<p>'I feel like great writing or great acting and great art, is it’s not characters, it’s the person,' she said. 'People evolve and people change and just like Ruth. Ruth is going to evolve, just like all the other characters.' </p>

<p>Sunday's show marked a socially distant event amid the ongoing COVID-19 virus, with most participants appearing via remote. In July, the show was moved to be held virtually with the pandemic continuing. </p>
