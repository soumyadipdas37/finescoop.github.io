<p>Centre stage: London's Ned provided the setting as Daisy Lowe attended her first public engagement with new boyfriend Jordan Saul on Sunday</p>

<p>The brunette added to her look with a smart leather jacket, while a simple black clutch and gold pendent necklace proved to be her only visible accessories. </p>

<p>Adding a splash of vibrancy to an otherwise subdued colour scheme, Daisy rounded off her make-up with a generous layer of rich, red lipstick.</p>

<p>Joining his new girlfriend, Jordan - the latest in a long line of men to be connected with Daisy over the course of the year - looked relaxed in a loose fitting shirt and ripped jeans.  </p>

<p>Looking good: Sporting a black dress with semi-sheer detailing, Daisy, 31, caught the eye during a brief photo-call</p>

<p>The new couple were attending the event little more than a week after going public with their romance during a post-lockdown trip to Portugal. </p>

<p>They were first pictured together on a boozy day out in a north London park in mid-July and then went on a date to the zoo together.</p>

<p>Jordan is understood to work as a new home consultant for an estate agent.</p>

<p>Make way: Stylist Emma Thatcher (L) looked lovely in a breezy tiered floral dress, while model Grace McGovern (R) opted for understated high-slung cargo trousers and baseball boots</p>

<p>Don't mind me: But Love Island star Laura was hard to miss as she made her way into the event on Sunday afternoon </p>

<p>Daisy, daughter of Bush rocker Gavin Rossdale and Pearl Lowe, seemed enamoured with Jordan, just a month after she was linked to musician Christian Langdon.</p>

<p>Christian is also the ex-husband of Cat Pierce from The Pierces. The rocker was a member of Arckid in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>

<p>He also goes by the nickname 'Leggy Langdon', thanks to his statuesque frame.</p>

<p>Daisy's spokesperson previously told MailOnline that her relationship with Christian was platonic after she was spotted with a ring on her engagement finger.</p>

<p>Side by side: Made In Chelsea's Tabitha (L) posed for a snap alongside Pernod Ricard brand manager Chantal Piper </p>

<p>Before that, Daisy had been dating singer Jack Peñate, 35, for six months, but they split in March, with Daisy saying she 'couldn't see a future' with him</p>

<p>The beauty had found romance with Jack after splitting from Cameron McMeikan, 24.</p>

<p>Daisy and Cameron dated for almost a year before reportedly ending their romance over their six-year age gap.</p>
