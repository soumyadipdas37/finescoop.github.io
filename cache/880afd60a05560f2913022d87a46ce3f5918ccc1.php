<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips is in line for his England debut tonight and Gareth Southgate is also ready to give Conor Coady his international bow.</p>

<p>The England boss will make a host of changes to the team that started Saturday’s win over Iceland in tonight’s Nations League match against Denmark.</p>

<p>And Phillips is hopeful of getting the nod to start in Copenhagen alongside Declan Rice or Mason Mount. </p>

<p>Kalvin Phillips is in line to make his international debut with the England team</p>

<p>The 24-year-old was part of the bedrock of Leeds’ successful promotion challenge last season and was rewarded by Southgate with his first call-up last week despite not having played a minute of Premier League football.</p>

<p>And Phillips is set to become the first Leeds player since Alan Smith in 2004 to play for the national team.</p>

<p>Having largely utilised a 4-3-3 formation since the 2018 World Cup, Southgate is expected to deploy a 3-4-3 in the Parken Stadium tonight with a view to keeping that set-up until next summer’s Euros. </p>

<p>That means Wolves centre back Coady is in line for his debut in a three-man defence alongside Joe Gomez and Eric Dier.</p>

<p>The midfielder has been called up following impressive performances with Leeds</p>

<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold will start at right wing back, with Kieran Trippier looking to keep his place on the opposite flank ahead of Ainsley Maitland-Niles.</p>

<p>In goal, Jordan Pickford expects to keep his place despite the competition from Burnley’s Nick Pope.</p>

<p>Southgate said last week that he would give all his goalkeepers — including Dean Henderson — game time between now and the European Championship.</p>

<p>But with the England manager looking likely to make at least four changes to the team who started in Reykjavik, he may stick with Pickford tonight, his regular No 1.</p>

<p>Despite appearing to suffer from fatigue in the second half in Iceland, skipper Harry Kane is expected to keep his place up front, flanked by Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho.</p>

<p>England’s Under 21s play a European Championship qualifier against Austria in Vienna on Tuesday night.</p>
