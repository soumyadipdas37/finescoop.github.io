<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows criticized FBI Director Christopher Wray a day after Wray told Congress he'd never seen any evidence of widespread voter fraud.  </p>

<p>'Well, with all due respect to Director Wray, he has a hard time finding emails in his own FBI let alone figuring out whether there's any kind of voter fraud,' Meadows said on 'CBS This Morning' when asked about Wray's testimony. </p>

<p>Meadows and his boss, President Donald Trump, have pushed that widespread mail-in balloting will be ripe for fraud, as Democrats have pushed for greater access to this kind of voting due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows criticized FBI Director Christopher Wray after he testified before Congress that there's been no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States </p>

<p>Christopher Wray was on Capitol Hill Thursday and told lawmakers he had, 'not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise' </p>

<p>President Donald Trump has cast doubt on mail-in voting, suggesting that process was ripe for fraud. Democrats have pushed to increase mail-in voting opportunites around the United States so people don't have to go to the polls personally due to the COVID-19 pandemic </p>

<p>'This is a very different case. The rules are being changed,' Meadows said, arguing against Wray's observations about past election cycles. </p>

<p>'So what I'm suggesting is perhaps he can drill down on the investigation that just started. Others that we're seeing in North Carolina and other places where multiple ballots - duplicate ballots are being sent out - perhaps he needs to get involved on the ground and will change his testimony on Capitol Hill,' Meadows said of Wray.   </p>

<p>Wray was handpicked by Trump to lead the FBI after the president fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. </p>

<p>Wray testified to members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee Thursday that he had 'not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise.'  </p>

<p>This week an FBI investigation kicked off in Pennsylvania dealing with nine 'discarded' ballots - seven that had been case for Trump - from the state's primary election. </p>

<p>They were mail-in ballots from military members. </p>

<p>The Justice Department released details about the investigation Thursday, which was considered an unusual step and stoked fears that the DOJ under Attorney General Bill Barr has become overly politicized. </p>

<p>For years, Trump has made unfounded claims about widespread voter fraud and has claimed he actually won the popular vote in 2016 - and that millions of fraudulent votes were cast in California, which helped Hillary Clinton win the popular vote.   </p>

<p>And for months during the coronavirus pandemic, he's cast doubt on the legitimacy of mail-in ballots, despite his own preference to vote absentee.  </p>

<p>He created controversy this week after not answering definitively when asked by a reporter: 'Win, lose or draw in this election ... will you commit here today for a peaceful transferal of power after the election?'  </p>

<p>'We're going to have to see what happens,' Trump said at the briefing Wednesday.  'You know that. I have been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.'  </p>
