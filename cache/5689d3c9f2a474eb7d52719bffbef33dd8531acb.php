<p>'We understand Black studies to be a capacious intellectual project that spans a variety of methodological approaches, fields, geographical areas, languages and time periods.' </p>

<p>English as a subject, the department says, has provided 'aesthetic rationalizations for colonization, exploitation, extraction and anti-Blackness'. </p>

<p>The statement goes on to deem the 'collective responsibility' of the faculty to be 'undoing persistent, recalcitrant anti-Blackness in our disciplines and in our institutions.'</p>

<p>The statement was written in July as protests against police violence tore across the US.  </p>

<p>Earlier in the statement, the faculty says they believe that 'Black Lives Matter, and that the lives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and Rayshard Brooks matter, as do thousands of others named and unnamed who have been subject to police violence.' </p>

<p>Gerald McSwiggan, a university spokesman told Fox News that the department 'saw a need' to focus doctoral admissions on those wishing to focus on Black Studies this year. </p>
