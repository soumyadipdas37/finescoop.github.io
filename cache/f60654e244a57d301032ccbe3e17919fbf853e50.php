<p>Scarlett admitted that she doesn't usually do karaoke but after winning the 2016 series of I'm A Celebrity, she is fearless.</p>

<p>She said: 'Everyone always thinks I'm quite confident but I'm a bit of an introvert. I never did karaoke then I came out of the jungle... if I can eat a kangaroo penis, I can definitely sing some Minnie Riperton on karaoke!'</p>

<p>Talking about how the jungle has made her fearless, she added: 'I think I just care less what people think, in a good way, I don't care at all now. I just enjoy myself and don't worry about looking or feeling silly. I am in the moment!'  </p>

<p>This Morning continues on weekdays at 10am on ITV. </p>
