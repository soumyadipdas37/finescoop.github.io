<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Medical cannabis could be available in Australia by next year, with an industry body proposing to make cannabidiol prescription-free.</p>

<p>The Therapeutic Goods Administration announced plans to amend Poisons Standard for cannabidiol to give patients easier access to the drug over the counter.</p>

<p>The product would be reclassified from a prescription to non-prescription drug if it is downgraded from Schedule 4 to Schedule 3 by the end of 2021.</p>

<p>The proposed changes would save Australians a trip to the doctor and give them access to CDB after consulting a pharmacist.</p>

<p>The substance would be only to allowed be taken orally, and patients would be limited to a maximum daily dosage of 60mg and a 30-day supply restriction. </p>

<p>Medicinal cannabis company Althea CEO Josh Fegan applauded TGA's proposal.</p>

<p>'The interim decision reflects the significant shift in community and government attitudes towards medicinal cannabis since it was legalised in Australia in late 2016, which has seen it move from a fringe alternative towards an accepted mainstream option,' he said. </p>

<p>'As a strong advocate for patient access, Althea has closely monitored the proposed amendment since it began and has participated in the consultation process.</p>

<p>'We are excited by the TGA's interim decision to down-schedule CBD products and see this development as a big step forward for prescription cannabis products already available in Australia.' </p>

<p>He added the products should be available toward the end of 2021 and would need to go through a registration process. </p>

<p>Cannabis Access Clinics Dr Mark Hardy told 7 News there was an 'overall stigmatisation of medicinal cannabis' and ongoing government red tape made it difficult for patients to access the product. </p>

<p>The TGA received submissions as part of its consultation process until October 12 and a final notice of decisions is expected to be released on November 25.  </p>
