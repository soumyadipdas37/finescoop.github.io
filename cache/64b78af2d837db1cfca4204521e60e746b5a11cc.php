<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Chase star Jenny Ryan has branded former TOWIE star Joey Essex 'lazy' and 'not a very nice person' after they appeared on Celebrity Masterchef together. </p>

<p>Speaking on 'Dan the Man's Desert Island D****' podcast, Jenny, 38, who appeared alongside the reality star, 30, on the show last year, said she was disappointed by his behaviour.  </p>

<p>She said: 'I thought, I'll take people as I find them and I want to give him a chance. </p>

<p>Ouch! The Chase's Jenny Ryan has branded Joey Essex 'lazy' and 'not a very nice person' after they appeared on Celebrity Masterchef together last year </p>

<p>Jenny said of Joey: 'He took up half of my time. It was so exasperating, it was excuse after excuse after excuse. I just thought, 'It's not a put-on, this - he's just lazy'</p>

<p>'The fact that he put this additional workload onto everybody else showed that he just doesn't seem to be a very nice person.' </p>

<p>There was one challenge in particular, where the team had to cook for 60 people out on the white cliffs of Dover, that left her feeling particularly frustrated with Joey.</p>

<p>She recalled: 'I assumed it was a bit of a persona and when you get into that situation the nice, co-operative side of you tends to come out.</p>

<p>'I spent much of the time allocated to us to cook the 60 portions cajoling, bossing Joey about, trying to find things for him to do, then trying to explain to him how to do them, then watching him make a halfhearted attempt to do them before making an excuse as to why he couldn't do that task - and then having to find another task...</p>

<p>'He took up half of my time. It was so exasperating, it was excuse after excuse after excuse. I just thought, 'It's not a put-on, this - he's just lazy.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jenny recently hinted she could sign up for 'I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!'</p>

<p>Can he do it? Joey appeared on The Chase for a celebrity special in 2017 against Jenny's colleague Anne 'The Governess' Hegerty, but it seems their paths didn't cross </p>

<p>After it was announced that this year's series will be held in the UK and she has told her followers 'this could be a big opportunity' for her to take part, because she won't have to put up with the creepy crawlies Down Under and the blistering heat.</p>

<p>She wrote: 'My main reservations about doing I'm A Celeb have always been 1. The Spiders 2. The Snakes 3, The Heat.</p>

<p>'So this could be a big opportunity for ol' Jenny.'</p>

<p>If The Vixen makes it onto the new series of 'I'm a Celebrity...' it will make her the second Chase quizmaster to take on the Ant and Dec hit show, after Anne 'The Governess' Hegerty survived in the jungle for three weeks in 2018.</p>

<p>Team mates: As one of their Celebrity Masterchef challenges Jenny and Joey had to cook for 60 people out on the White Cliffs of Dover, which left Jenny frustrated with Joey</p>
