<p>Rachel Straughan realised she was not getting into her kitchen in Morpeth, Northumberland, any time soon as the door wouldn't open.</p>

<p>As she films her kitchen through the window outside she says one of her pets have lodged the drawer against the door handle, jamming it shut.</p>

<p>One of Rachel Straughan's three cats, Luna, Mitsy or Effy, wanted to get some treats but ended up blocking the entry to the kitchen in Morpeth, Northumberland</p>

<p>Trying to and gain access into her kitchen, Ms Straughan had to break both the drawer and the door.</p>

<p>She says it took her half an hour to get in, where she found her cats had been tucking into their treats that were sprinkled all across the floor.</p>

<p>They'd burst the packet of Dreamies treats open and had a feast while they had unintentionally locked themselves in the kitchen. </p>

<p>Rachel Straughan (pictured) said it took her over half an hour to get into her kitchen after her pet cats had jammed the door shut</p>

<p>The annoyed pet owner had to 'shoulder barge the door' to get it open, breaking both the door and the drawer in the process </p>

<p>Their owner asks: 'Serious?' As the moggie stays perched on the counter, not realising the hassle it has caused. </p>

<p>The annoyed pet owner then turns the camera on herself to explain how she managed to break back into the room.</p>

<p>She said she had to 'shoulder barge the door so that it was open three inches' so that she was able to get her hand through.</p>

<p>Once her hand was in, she knocked the drawer out on to the floor, causing it to break even further. </p>

<p>After escaping the event with just a a few bruises on her wrist, she said that she 'couldn't believe' what had happened.  </p>

<p>She found her cats had been tucking into their treats that were sprinkled all across the floor and had burst the packet of Dreamies open</p>
