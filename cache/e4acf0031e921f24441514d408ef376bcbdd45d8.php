<p>Raising eyebrows: James Fisher and Sons provides products and services to the marine, oil and gas industry worldwide</p>

<p>It came despite a 59 per cent slump in profits to £7.1m in the six months to the end of June in what chief executive Eoghan O'Lionaird described as 'one of the most demanding periods the company has faced'. </p>

<p>The payout also raised eyebrows given James Fisher furloughed 400 of its 3,000 staff, costing the public purse £1.9m. </p>

<p>Critic John O'Connell, at the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Employers who are in a position to repay furlough money should do so.' </p>

<p>James Fisher said the 400 furloughed staff returned to work in July. It cancelled its final dividend for 2019, costing shareholders £12m. </p>
