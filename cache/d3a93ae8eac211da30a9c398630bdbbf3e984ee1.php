<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Block contestants Luke and Jasmin have denied they stole and copied a design aesthetic from a former 2014 team to win Sunday's children's room challenge.</p>

<p>However, it appears the couple actually cheated in plain sight - and viewers were completely oblivious.</p>

<p>In a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, Jasmin was seen looking at a photo on her phone, which resembled an almost exact replica of their finished room. </p>

<p> SPOT the difference: How The Block's Luke and Jasmin (pictured) cheated in plain sight during a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment on the renovation show</p>

<p>An eagle-eyed viewer pointed out the moment on Twitter, writing: 'Yes you could literally see this picture on Jas’ phone when showing Dan the ladder!!'  </p>

<p>'Really original ideas coming from Jas in house 4. This is an Airbnb in Byron,' another user wrote. </p>

<p>An accompanying photo to the Tweet thread showed a room which also had polkadot wallpaper, a timber ladder and framing for the top bunk. </p>

<p>'Yes you could literally see this picture on Jas’ phone when showing Dan the ladder!' Jasmin was seen looking at a photo on her phone which looked similar to her finished room.</p>

<p>'Really original ideas coming from Jas in house 4': Eagle eyed viewers pointed out the eerily similar designs online</p>

<p>From Byron to The Block: An accompanying photo to the Tweet thread showed a room which also had polkadot wallpaper, a timber ladder and framing for the top bunk from an Airbnb listing</p>

<p>Despite initially giving the couple the perfect score of ten, judge Shaynna Blaze later told TV Week she believed the couple had created a 'literal carbon copy' of recent home renovations by 2014 stars of The Block, Kyal and Kara Ryan. </p>

<p>The 57-year-old explained: 'I thought, "I'm just going to have a look" – and I found an identical one. There are one or two teeny-tiny tweaks, but it's literally a carbon copy!' </p>

<p>While she couldn't quite put her finger on it at the time, Shaynna explained that the pair's room is a 'copy' of another image she found through a simple internet search.</p>

<p>The interior designer fumed: "We're not into copy-and-pasting. And not only that, it takes months and expertise to put all that together – the research, actually finding all those pieces.</p>

<p>'When you present it in a competition and say, "I put this together", it's like, "Well, no you haven't! You just copied somebody else's hard work and claimed it as your own."'</p>

<p>'It was a carbon copy!' Despite giving Luke and Jasmin the perfect score of ten, judge Shaynna Blaze (pictured) has now admitted that she had a nagging feeling that the design of their bedroom was one she had seen elsewhere</p>

<p>Not happy: Shaynna, has accused the pair of cheating, explaining: 'I thought, "I'm just going to have a look" – and I found an identical one. There are one or two teeny-tiny tweaks, but it's literally a carbon copy!'</p>

<p>Spot the difference? Luke and Jasmin's (left) bedroom appeared to be inspired by a room designed by former 2014 team Kyal and Kara (right)</p>

<p>Jasmin, 36, was quick to deny the cheating claims, telling the publication that the design of the room was a product of a moodboard she had created.</p>

<p>She also claimed that if she were to cheat, she 'wouldn't have done it so openly'. </p>

<p>However, a producer of the show has previously said that the act of sourcing inspiration and recreating designs is allowed on the program. </p>

<p>'Contestants take inspiration from many things, magazines, shop window displays and previous Block rooms... Nothing can be copied 100 percent because too many factors come in to play,' producer Anna Scarff told Nine in 2017.   </p>

<p>'Paint colour, furniture availability, layout of rooms and time, these are the forces that shape their creativity. They may take inspiration from these things, but their hard work and their own ideas always prevail.'</p>

<p>The Block continues Monday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine </p>

<p>Defending themselves: Jasmin, 36, was quick to deny the cheating claims, telling the publication that the design of the room was a product of a moodboard she had created</p>
