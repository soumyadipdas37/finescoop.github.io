<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Parents accused Aldi of 'misleading' advertising for a toy sandpit that is barely bigger than an adult's hand once it is unboxed. </p>

<p>Many people shared hilarious photos of the tiny Lets Get Messy sandpit compared with how it is advertised. </p>

<p>Martin Kirkby, from Bournemouth in Dorset,  shared a picture of the £3.99 sandpit under his hand with the caption: 'Absolutely disgusting from Aldi to falsely advertise.</p>

<p>'The box tells you it's a big pit for kids to play in but it turns out it's no bigger than your hand. Disgrace.'</p>

<p>Martin Kirkby, from Bournemouth in Dorset, posted the picture of the sandpit showing that it is barely bigger than his hand</p>

<p>The Lets Get Messy sandpit was sold for £3.99 and has a picture on the box that many parents thought was misleading</p>

<p>Grace Leete posted a very similar image saying: 'Well done on your sizing Aldi, you've excelled yourselves £haha.'</p>

<p>And Jessica Galvin, from Melksham Wiltshire, complained the item was only a 'quarter of the size' of what was promised </p>

<p>She wrote: 'Nice idea Aldi, but a little misleading on the tray size! </p>

<p>'Particularly disappointing given the size of the tray for the bubble set.'</p>

<p>But the funny side was not lost on many parents who laughed about the miniature sandpit. </p>

<p>Laura James, from Leeds in Yorkshire, posted snaps of daughter Harper, 4, looking delighted with her new toy.</p>

<p>She said: 'And the award for the worst representation of something goes to Aldi.</p>

<p>'Granted it was reduced to £1.99 but unless my four-year-old daughter is suddenly a giant, pretty sure this is a tad inaccurate.'</p>

<p>Laura said that despite the initial shock, she and Harper found the situation funny.</p>

<p>Harper (pictured) and her mother Laura both found the situation funny and did not want a refund</p>

<p>The 31-year-old audiologist said: 'Our initial reaction when we opened it was amusement straight away.</p>

<p>'We found it hilarious and Harper asked where the rest of it was.</p>

<p>'I joked that Harper must be a giant. </p>

<p>'She still plays with it as she loves sand! </p>

<p>'She sat there looking at the box and trying to work out what was happening.</p>

<p>'We posted in Aldi UK to share our amusement and Aldi offered to take it back for a refund but she still likes it, we just found the misinterpretation really funny.' </p>

<p>Several of the customers have since been offered a refund by Aldi's customer service team on social media.</p>

<p>Aldi said: 'We are sorry to hear that some customers were disappointed with this product. </p>

<p>'Any customer who is not entirely satisfied with an Aldi product can return it to their nearest store for a full refund.' </p>
