<p>While appearing on the Today show last month, Ashley explained that becoming a mom has only added to her desire to promote self-confidence and self-love.  </p>

<p>'Now as a mother, I think it's even more important because I'm not just a role model for people who follow me, I'm a role model for [my son],' she said.</p>

<p>'And now having my body completely change, and stretch marks and extra weight and my hips and my stomach have shifted in new areas...</p>

<p>'I just want women to know that things will change, and it's most important to just continue to love yourself and to do that for the next generation.'</p>
