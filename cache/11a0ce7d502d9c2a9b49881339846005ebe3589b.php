<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An enraged landscape gardener has paid $2,000 out of his own pocket to fly a banner reading 'vote her out' over the Gold Coast in a dig at embattled Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. </p>

<p>John McInerney was furious after Canberra woman Sarah Caisip was banned from attending her father's funeral on Thursday.</p>

<p>Ms Caisip was allowed to view her father's body but was forced to wear full PPE, even though the ACT has not recorded a new case of coronavirus in 60 days. </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk goes to the polls on October 31, but Mr McInerney has urged his fellow Queenslanders to vote her out. </p>

<p>'I think the Queensland premier is doing a horrendous job,' he told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>A landscaper hired an aircraft to fly over Queensland urging the state to 'vote out' embattled Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (pictured)</p>

<p>'I know it is difficult – I don’t think anyone would know how to deal with this. </p>

<p>'However, there are such double standards. People with money are given access while people with medical conditions cant get a look in.'  </p>

<p>Last month Ms Palaszczuk said 'Queensland hospitals are for Queenslanders' , a comment which Mr McInerney branded 'disgusting'.  </p>

<p>Mr McInerney said the final straw for him was when Ms Palaszczuk blamed the decision not to allow Ms Caisip to her father's funeral on the chief medical officer.</p>

<p>'She should be able to overrule a bureaucrat. They don’t run the state. For her to say decision is not hers to make, she is not worthy of running a state,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr McInerney said he initially wanted to fly the banner on the AFL Grand Final weekend and before the election, but yesterday's news tipped him over the edge.</p>

<p>The gardener started a GoFundMe called Vote Her Out to help raise money to fly the banner daily.    </p>

<p>Even Prime Minister Scott Morrison has taken aim at Ms Palaszcusk's border policy, which bans people from Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT entering the state. </p>

<p>Footage showed the plane flying over the Gold Coast on Friday afternoon with a banner that read 'Vote Her Out', in reference to the state's upcoming election</p>

<p>Ms Caisip applied for an exemption last month to visit her sick father Bernard Prendergast in Brisbane - but it took 20 days to get approved and he died of liver cancer two days before her flight.  </p>

<p>The prime minister had asked Ms Palaszczuk to make an exception but the premier refused and accused him of 'bullying and intimidating' her. </p>

<p>'I said to the Prime Minister, I would refer it to the chief health officer and I did that,' Ms Palaszczuk said on Friday morning.</p>

<p>'It's her decision... you've got to take the clinical advice here. We're dealing with a health pandemic. It is absolutely tragic. It is heartbreaking.'  </p>

<p>Sarah Caisip (in yellow) was allowed to have a private viewing of her father's body, dressed in PPE and with security guards minding her. She was not allowed to greet her family</p>

<p>The refusal sparked outrage across the country, and in the end Ms Caisip was only granted a private viewing of his body, surrounded by guards and forbidden from seeing her shattered mother and 11-year-old sister. </p>

<p>Mr Morrison, who lost his own father in January, choked back tears as he described the case as 'heartbreaking' in a radio interview.  </p>

<p>Family and friends of Ms Caisip's father are seen attending the funeral on September 10</p>
