<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A male stripper has gained millions of followers on social media through his uncanny resemblance to Hollywood heartthrob Channing Tatum.</p>

<p>It's a cookie-cutter example of life imitating art for Will Parfitt, a London-born performer living in Melbourne since 2015 whose career has mirrored the film Magic Mike in more ways than his physical similarity to its now 40-year-old star.</p>

<p>After moving Down Under, the 29-year-old removalist was scouted by a club promoter and began working for Magic Men, an agency specialising in bachelorette parties and private events - just like Tatum's handyman character in the 2012 drama.</p>

<p>Stripping as 'Channing' in an ode to his famous doppelganger, Mr Parfitt has grown an audience of 252,000 Instagram followers and a whopping 2.4million on TikTok - where fans say they find him even more attractive than his handsome namesake.</p>

<p>Fans say they find Mr Parfitt (pictured) even more attractive than his handsome namesake</p>

<p>'Okay, I have decided I actually prefer you to Channing Tatum,' a follower called Lisa wrote under a recent video.</p>

<p>'Better looking than you know who!' another agreed, while a third said: 'Legit (sic) thought this was Channing for the first 10 seconds.'</p>

<p>'So much better than the famous one everyone compares you to, who I won't name,' a fourth added.</p>

<p>Other responses include 'you are definitely more attractive than Channing Tatum', 'you could be his twin' and 'you are the best looking man I've ever seen'. </p>

<p>Under a recent TikTok video of Mr Parfitt dressed as a policeman and twirling a set of handcuffs in one hand, a woman wrote: 'Arrest me.'</p>

<p>A recent video of Mr Parfitt dressed as a policeman and twirling a set of handcuffs in one hand elicited particularly strong reactions.</p>

<p>The clip, which is captioned 'going through a break up so your friends get you something to cheer you up', drew thousands of comments with one woman writing: 'I'm 46 and happily married but can we pretend I'm [going through] a break up?'</p>

<p>Another simply told Mr Parfitt to arrest her.</p>

<p>Many wondered why the performer - who is described as a 'spunky, drop-dead gorgeous boy next door' in his profile on Magic Men's website - hasn't gone 'major viral' online yet.</p>

<p>Many wondered why the performer (pictured) hasn't gone 'major viral' online yet</p>

<p>Mr Parfitt (pictured at home in Melbourne) is described as a 'spunky, drop-dead gorgeous boy next door' in his profile on Magic Men's website</p>

<p>During peak wedding season, which runs from October to April in Australia, Mr Parfitt once performed up to 15 times each weekend – but that was before the COVID crisis shuttered venues, suspending shows and forcing stars online.</p>

<p>Closures have cost him almost $3,000 a week, the sum he would typically earn for just one weekend's work.</p>

<p>But his ever-increasing social media profile is sure to provide him with a host of new opportunities as soon as Victoria's second lockdown is lifted.</p>
