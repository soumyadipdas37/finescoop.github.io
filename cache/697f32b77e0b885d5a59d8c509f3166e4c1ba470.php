<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A British diplomatic vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb near Baghdad airport on Tuesday morning, the UK's Iraqi embassy has said.</p>

<p>The blast occurred at the entrance to the city's Green Zone, according to local reports, but did not cause any casualties.</p>

<p>No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, though the US frequently blames such blasts on Iranian-backed militias in the country.</p>

<p>A car carrying British diplomats in Baghdad was targeted by an IED as it entered the city's Green Zone on Tuesday, though escaped without injury</p>

<p>The bomb blast came hours after two rockets were fired into the Green Zone, which housesÂ government buildings and foreign missions.</p>

<p>It is unclear what the intended target was, but neither missile caused any casualties, the country's military said.</p>

<p>Videos posted online showed anti-missile defences in action overnight.</p>

<p>Iraq, often the scene of spillover violence from U.S.-Iran tensions, has sought to avoid being drawn into any regional conflagration.</p>

<p>The Middle East came close to a full conflict in January after a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad airport.</p>

<p>Iran-aligned militias have sworn to avenge their deaths.</p>
