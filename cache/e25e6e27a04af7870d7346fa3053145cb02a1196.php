<p>Trump, who helps run the Trump Organization, said there are 'a ton' of inaccuracies in the story, although he did not identify any. 'My father pays a fortune in taxes.'</p>

<p>He called New York Times journalists who produced the story 'disgusting' and demanded an investigation of the IRS.</p>

<p>Eric Trump on Tuesday called for an investigation of the leak of his father's tax return information and accused the IRS of doing it</p>

<p>'They've been writing that article for three months, and they wanted to drop it the morning before the debate. These are disgusting people,' he said during a morning appearance on Fox &amp; Friends.</p>

<p>'Why is no one talking about the IRS? The IRS - somebody at the IRS leaked the documents. I really believe that this is the IRS scandal of this generation,' he said.</p>

<p>'Now they're targeting my father because he's doing a great job and they don't like him,' he said.</p>

<p>A staff member of left wing Media Matters posted the comments.  </p>

<p>President Trump has attacked the Times report on his tax returns as 'fake' </p>

<p>Trump was revealed to have paid just $750 in federal individual taxes in 2016 and again in 2017</p>

<p>Eric Trump pointed to the IRS as the source of the information, but the Times did not identify its sources, and others had access to the information</p>

<p>He put the story, which came out Sunday with another installment Monday night, in the context of other recent bombshells – including one in the Atlantic that quoted sources saying Trump called U.S. troops 'suckers' and 'losers,' and Bob Woodward's book there Trump told the journalist he played down the coronavirus. </p>

<p>'You better believe that every single day between now and election they're going to have another quote unquote October surprise. I mean first it was the Atlantic Story and then it was the Bob Woodward book and now it's the New York Times nonsense and they try to discredit my father,' he said. </p>

<p>'We've got a great company .. We've got the best assets in the world,' he said of the real estate, golf and branding empire that emerges in new detail for the first time in the Times report. </p>

<p>'Any person in the world would envy to be in Donald Trump's shoes. He truly is the American dream ... Guys, they're disgusting but somebody better look into the IRS. </p>

<p>The Times expose, which reveals Trump paid personal income taxes of just $750 in 2016 and has suffered huge losses in his golf and business empire totaling $421 million, with $300 million coming due in the next four years. It notes that multiple sources have gained access to tax return information, including prosecutors, attorneys, the IRS, and the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, which has a role in large audits. House Democrats have been trying to get the returns for years without success. </p>
