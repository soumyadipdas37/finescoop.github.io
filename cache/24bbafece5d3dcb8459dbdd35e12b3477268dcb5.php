<p>Sharing a picture of the two of them together, Sogand wrote: 'One of the most amazing things that can happen is finding someone who sees everything you are and won’t let you be anything less.</p>

<p>'They see the potential of you. They see endless possibilities. And through their eyes, you start to see yourself the same way.'</p>

<p>She added: 'As someone who matters. As someone who can make a difference in this world. If you’re lucky enough to find this person, never let them go.'</p>

<p>Kev is a trailer at the 98 Gym in Surry Hills, where The Biggest Loser's Steve 'Commando' Willis also works.</p>

<p>On his Instagram, he's pictured training a number of celebrity clients, including Candice Warner and actor Jason Fox. </p>

<p>Back in March, Sogand revealed that her career as a civil engineer often intimidated men and made it difficult for her to date.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she admitted men often look at her differently after she tells them about her job.</p>

<p>'The amount of times I've had conversations with guys and as soon as I say "I'm a civil engineer", their face goes weird,' Sogand explained.</p>

<p>She added: 'The funny thing is, I only did it because I enjoy doing mathematics. I don't even enjoy working in the industry. </p>

<p>'If a guy is intimidated by that, I don't want him in my life.'</p>
