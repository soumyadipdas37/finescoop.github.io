<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>High-end athletic apparel maker Lululemon has come under fire for inviting followers on Twitter to a workshop teaching people how to 'resist capitalism'.</p>

<p>The Zoom meeting planned for later this month is to be hosted by company brand ambassador Rebby Kern who will host a 'Decolonizing Gender' workshop 'to unveil historical erasure and resist capitalism'. </p>

<p>The irony of the company, which is worth more than $45 billion, hosting such an event was not lost on social media users who were quick to mock the clothing firm for such double standards. </p>

<p>Lululemon is promoting a class on 'resisting capitalism' on social media</p>

<p>The company which is worth $45 billion was quickly ridiculed online</p>

<p>One Twitter user came up with a simple solution for Lululemon wearers to 'resist capitalism'</p>

<p>Many users pointed out that the company wouldn't exist without capitalism</p>

<p>'Lululemon hosting a workshop to "resist capitalism" while selling us $180 yoga pants is peak 2020 tweeted Kevin Duffey.</p>

<p>'WHY, <?php echo e('@'); ?>lululemon, are you pushing an anti-capitalist Marxist workshop when you ONLY exist because of capitalism?' wrote Mattea Merta on Twitter.</p>

<p>''Resist capitalism" by not purchasing lululemon goods,' wrote another user in a short but succinct tweet.</p>

<p>Journalist Brent Scher appeared to point out the absurdity of the company hosting the workshop by simply stating the facts: 'Lululemon, a company worth $45.5 billion best known for selling $100 leggings made by tortured overseas laborers, invited its social media followers to learn how to "resist capitalism" this weekend.'</p>

<p>Several Twitter followers came up with some simple ideas to help 'resist capitalism'</p>

<p>One Twitter use simply stated the facts to make the point of company's duality</p>

<p>Another user pointed out the hypocrisy of the company urging wearers to 'resist capitalism' while selling its merchandise for around $100</p>

<p>The clashing of doctrines was also noted by theologian Owen Strachan. </p>

<p>'Lululemon: our pants are $128 Also Lululemon: we're totally "resisting capitalism"' he wrote. </p>

<p>'All wokeness aside...resist capitalism? I see this happen over and over and can't fully wrap my head around how these brands survive these suicidal campaigns. They can easily be called on their hypocrisy, just to begin with: they outsource everything they manufacture, even IT!' wrote another savvy commentator. </p>

<p>'If Lululemon is interested in resisting capitalism, then why isn't it registered as a non-profit?' joked another follower.</p>

<p>'Lululemon IS capitalism. It is literally a privately owned corporation that raked in half a billion dollars in pure profits last year, merely by selling overpriced yoga pants to women willing and able to pay for this luxury. All this begs the question...WUT?' added Amy Swearer on Twitter.  </p>

<p>Shares in the company are up 51 percent with online sales up 157 percent since the start of the pandemic</p>

<p>There didn't appear to be many tweeting in support of Lululemon and the workshop</p>

<p>Sales of Lululemon have soared during the coronavirus pandemic with leggings and hoodies a common choice for workers who have been forced to swap their pants, suits and dresses for the office for more comfortable stay-at-home options. </p>

<p>Shares in the company are up some 51 percent with online sales up 157 percent since the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>So great was the demand for the firm's clothing, sales were even up 2 percent on 2019's figures in a year-on-year comparison of the second quarter of 2020.</p>

<p>The company wasn't always so 'woke' when it came to its public actions according to the Free Beacon.     </p>

<p>The company's founder, Chip Wilson, a Canadian billionaire ended up resigning from the board of company in 2013 after making a number of controversial comments.</p>

<p>He had said that Lululemon's signature leggings which retail at $128 were not made for women 'without a thigh gap' and proceeded to state the company could not afford to make leggings for plus-size women.</p>

<p>It was also rumored that Wilson had allegedly chosen the company's name to mock how Japanese people pronounce the letter 'L'.</p>

<p>A more recent article on the company from The Guardian last year detailed how women working inside the company's factories in Bangladesh were beaten by managers.    </p>
