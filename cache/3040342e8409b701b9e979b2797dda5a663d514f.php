<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rolls-Royce is on the cusp of launching an emergency fundraising to tap shareholders for between £2billion and £2.5billion. </p>

<p>City sources said the FTSE100-listed jet engine maker is close to securing the funds from investors, possibly through a rights issue and placing. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are believed to be among the investment banks working on the fundraising deal for Rolls-Royce. </p>

<p>Emergency: City sources said the FTSE100-listed jet engine maker is close to securing the funds from investors</p>

<p>It had been thought Rolls-Royce may look to raise £1.5billion from investors. But sources claimed the blue chip firm is now seeking an extra £500million to £1billion, possibly from sovereign wealth funds. </p>

<p>The move to launch such a large rescue fundraising comes as Rolls-Royce shares – which closed last week at £1.80 – flirt with a 16-year low amid concerns about the company's financial position. </p>

<p>Investment bankers last month told The Mail on Sunday that they had heard rumours the Government was 'starting to get worried', raising the possibility of state intervention. </p>

<p>Rolls-Royce – in which the Government has a 'golden share' that gives it the right to block a takeover – has been hit hard by the pandemic. In part that has been because the company operates a power-by-the hour model, where it sells engines at a loss and later receives payments according to how much they fly. This arrangement has left the company bleeding cash. </p>

<p>The firm is also particularly exposed to the collapse in long-haul travel because it makes engines for bigger planes such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and Airbus's A350. </p>

<p>Rolls-Royce's debt has been downgraded to junk status and major long-term shareholders, such as American activist ValueAct Capital, have been selling out of the company. </p>

<p>In a note to clients several weeks ago, David Perry, an analyst at JP Morgan, said: 'An £8billion hole will need much more than a £1.5billion rights issue. We believe RollsRoyce needs to raise at least £6billion [through equity raise sales and disposals] to put itself on a sound financial footing.' </p>

<p>Perry added that the company's debt pile will be almost £19billion by the end of the year. He believes that £1.5billion may not be enough to save the firm. </p>

<p>The analyst suggested that Rolls-Royce needs to issue £6billion of equity and this might not be possible by just relying on institutional investors. 'We think there is a high chance of Government intervention,' he added. </p>

<p>Aside from tapping stock market investors for fresh cash, Rolls-Royce is also seeking to generate about £2billion from selling divisions – including ITP Aero – over the next 18 months. </p>

<p>ITP Aero is Rolls-Royce's Spanish engineering division that makes turbine blades for engines. </p>

<p>A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said: 'We continue to review a range of funding options to further strengthen our balance sheet. </p>

<p>'These could include debt and equity, but no final decisions have been taken. We have already taken swift action to strengthen our liquidity with £6.1billion at the end of the first half of the year and a further £2billion term loan agreed in the second half. </p>

<p>'We have also announced £1billion of cost mitigation activity in 2020 and launched a re-organisation of our Civil Aerospace business to save £1.3billion annually.' </p>

<p>Last month, the firm's woes were compounded by the announcement that finance chief Stephen Daintith was leaving the business for online delivery firm Ocado. </p>

<p>Daintith has said he will stay for a transition period.</p>
