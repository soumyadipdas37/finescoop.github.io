<p>While some 60 per cent of employers want their staff back at their desks by the new year - just 42 per cent of workers felt the same.</p>

<p>The remaining 58 per cent felt this is too soon and 2021 would be a better starting date, or were unsure. </p>

<p>Data from 100 companies showed 58 per cent of staff members believed workers would spend just two or three days in the office - rather than spend the full five-day working week away from home.</p>

<p>Employers appear to be on the same page, as 60 per cent agreed that two or three days would likely be the average norm.</p>

<p>Bosses and workers are divided about whether employees should return to the office, a survey has shown</p>

<p>The Prime Minister has launched a major drive to persuade more Britons to return to work as remote employees were warned they could be more at risk of being sacked.</p>

<p>He yesterday told the Cabinet that 'we know there will be more outbreaks' but he is 'absolutely confident' the Government will be able to deal with them.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson claimed 'huge numbers' of people are now returning to offices and 'quite right too' amid fears that Professor Chris Whitty could quit over the Government's push to persuade workers to ditch working from home.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson (pictured with Rishi Sunak) yesterday told the Cabinet that 'we know there will be more outbreaks' but he is 'absolutely confident' the Government will be able to deal with them</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also appeared to acknowledge that his Government has been hit by a series of damaging U-turns in recent months.</p>

<p>He said: 'In the last few months, we've been sailing into the teeth of a gale. </p>

<p>'It is necessary to tack in response to the facts as they change, in response to the wind's change, but we have been going steadily in the direction, in the course we set out, and not been blown off course.'   </p>

<p>Mr Johnson met with his Cabinet in the grand Locarno Suite at the Foreign Office - chosen because it has more space than Number 10 so that ministers can socially distance.</p>

<p>The opulent setting will be used for the meetings for the foreseeable future after months of Mr Johnson having to speak to ministers via Zoom.</p>
