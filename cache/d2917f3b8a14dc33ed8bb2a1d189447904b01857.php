<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lisa Wilkinson has blasted a 'double standard' in coronavirus contact tracing rules. </p>

<p>Cafes, restaurants, pubs, clubs and entertainment venues in NSW are all required to take patron details to help find close contacts should any infected person attend. </p>

<p>But the rule does not apply to taxi customers.  </p>

<p>On Sunday, NSW Health confirmed it was scrambling to find passengers of a taxi driver who worked across Sydney for nine days while infected with COVID-19. </p>

<p>Wilkinson said that was 'crazy'.  </p>

<p>'You can sit in a café for 10 minutes and you've punched in the QR code and given them your number,' said the veteran journalist on Channel 10's The Project on Sunday night.</p>

<p>'You can sit in a taxi for an hour in even closer proximity and there's no accountability - which is crazy.'</p>

<p>Project Co-host Peter Van Onselen agreed: 'It doesn't make sense that they don't.'  </p>

<p>Lisa Wilkinson said it was 'crazy' that taxi drivers don't record passenger details like cafes do</p>

<p>NSW Health said on Sunday the taxi driver, who is thought to have picked up the virus at Liverpool Hospital, had ferried passengers around western and southwestern Sydney on September 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.</p>

<p>The driver took people to Moorebank, Bankstown, Chipping Norton, Liverpool, Lidcombe, Warwick Farm and Milperra.</p>

<p>NSW Health urged anyone who caught a taxi in those suburbs to get tested for coronavirus immediately if they develop any symptom.</p>

<p>New South Wales recorded two new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday and one death, bringing the state's death toll to 55.</p>

<p>The man in his 70s died on Saturday at Sydney's Royal North Shore hospital, Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed on Sunday. </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian confirmed the two new cases on Sunday, one of which is in hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>The other was the taxi driver.</p>

<p>A taxi driver with coronavirus drove around Sydney for seven days and potentially infected customers</p>

<p>NSW Health is now scrambling to contact as many of the 13 Cabs driver's passengers as possible.</p>

<p>'Pleasingly, the person had the COVIDSafe App, which is being used to help identify contacts,' NSW Health said in an emailed update on Sunday.</p>

<p>The driver also reportedly wore a mask which reduces the amount of infected aerosol droplets projected from the mouth and nose, and the range they travel. </p>

<p>The app will only find those contacts who also had the app on their phone and bluetooth switched on at the time.</p>

<p>An alert has also been issued for several venues in Sydney's west and the South Coast after the taxi driver visited.</p>

<p>If you were at the following locations at for an hour or more during the times specified, you are at high risk of coronavirus, and are deemed a 'close contact' of the infected taxi driver. Get tested and isolate yourself for 14 days - even if the test is negative, as it can take 14 days for symptoms to develop. </p>

<p>If you were there for less than an hour you are deemed a 'casual contact' and at lower risk of coronavirus. You should monitor yourself for symptoms and get tested. If symptoms develop, isolate yourself.</p>
