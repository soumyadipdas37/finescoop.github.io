<p>She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.' </p>

<p>She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.' </p>
