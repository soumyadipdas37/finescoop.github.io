<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A sophisticated anti-lockdown protest set to hit Melbourne will use encrypted messages, scouts, and rogue police officers to preserve the large-scale operation.</p>

<p>Almost 700 demonstrators have vowed to swarm the city on Sunday for a mass rally against the Victorian government's coronavirus restrictions.  </p>

<p>It comes a day after up to 150 protesters descended on Elwood and Elsternwick Park in Brighton, 11km from the city's centre, resulting in 21 fines and 16 arrests.  </p>

<p>But organisers claim Sunday will be the 'big one', as co-ordination and planning reaches a level that 'has never been seen at a protest before'. </p>

<p>Protesters have been ordered via encrypted messages to start a series of small rallies within 10 minutes of the CBD kicking off at 7am, according to the Herald Sun. </p>

<p>The location of the main event will be provided at 1pm, when the groups will merge and stream to the area in unison. </p>

<p>In an Instagram poster promoting the event, organisers vowed to 'flow like water' during the main protest.  </p>

<p>Scouts and rogue cops will reportedly be feeding information about where police are conducting patrols. </p>

<p>'We are exceptionally thankful to the small number of Victoria Police officers who came forward and are willing to provide information,' an ­organiser said. </p>

<p>A sea of police flocked to the city's Bayside suburbs on Saturday as scores of conspiracy theorists and coronavirus deniers flooded into a park to rebel against Melbourne's lockdown. </p>

<p>Protests were announced by rally organisers about 10.30am on Saturday - half an hour before kicking off at the State Library, and a second closely following at 12pm. </p>

<p>Law enforcement teams circling Elsternwick Park included officers from Public Order Response, the Mounted Unit and Highway Patrol.</p>

<p>A helicopter also monitored the situation from above.</p>

<p>Footage shared online showed mount police chasing dozens of protesters as they fled down a footpath. </p>

<p>'Get ready to run,' the man filming can be heard calling out. </p>

<p>Protesters marching along Elwood beach about 1pm were dispersed a third time, and several arrests have been made by officers.</p>

<p>Shouting about Premier Daniel Andrews and coronavirus restrictions was heard throughout the disjointed protests.</p>

<p>The protests were described as 'chaotic', with one photographer saying there was 'a lot of running and not much protesting.' </p>

<p>Some protesters continued to scatter through backstreets, even jumping fences into private property.</p>

<p>One arrested by police was filmed by Nine News telling officers: 'Wake up, I know you already know this is wrong.' </p>

<p>The encrypted messages are being used to announce the 'flash protests' and to attempt to avoid police finding out the location of the planned rally</p>

<p>Melbourne remains in a Stage Four lockdown, meaning residents cannot leave their houses without a valid reason, and restrictions are in place to limit movement more than 5km from a person's home.</p>

<p>The restrictions remain in place, and both a State of Emergency and State of Disaster, have been extended a further four weeks.</p>

<p>Multiple rallies have taken place in Melbourne over the past few weekends, with Victoria police responding with a heavy presence - handing out dozens of fines and making arrests.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded 14 new cases and five deaths on Sunday, the lowest daily increase since June and the tenth day in a row the state has recorded a daily infections increase below 50. </p>
