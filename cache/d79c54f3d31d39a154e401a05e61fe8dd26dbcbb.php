<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A furious Alfa Romeo driver has posted dash cam footage of a car crash with a ute online to shame the 'entitlement' motorist.</p>

<p>The collision with the dual-cab Volkswagen Amarok occured on the mid-north coast of NSW near the town of Port Macquarie.</p>

<p>Video shows the Amarok driver on the left of screen with the blinker on trying to merge in front of the driver who uploaded the footage.</p>

<p>The woman in the ute sticks her head out of her indow and repeatedly motions with her hand before slowly merging into the lane and clipping the Alfa Romeo. </p>

<p>A furious Alfa Romeo driver has posted dash cam footage of a car crash with a ute online to shame the 'entitlement' motorist</p>

<p>'The woman beside me wanted to get in front of me despite there being no one behind me and it being her responsibility to yield,' the driver, who anonymously posted the video to the Facebook group Dash Cam Owners Australia, said.</p>

<p>'She even had room to merge into the left lane. Nope, aggressively hung at the window, shouted at me several times, once you can see and then started to throw her Amarok towards me to scare me off and then just decided that wasn't working so she plowed into me. </p>

<p>'Then she had her police officer husband try to give me a hard time even though it was completely her fault. Unreal entitlement. ' </p>

<p>Not everyone agreed the Alfa Romeo driver was 'in the right' and a heated debate erupted over who should be held responsible for the the ugly incident. </p>

<p>'It's common sense to just let the car in front in, they shouldn’t need to have to slow down so much to have to merge in behind you,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'They signaled for some time and you ignored it. Also once a car has merged in front, give them some space. </p>

<p>'If you keep trying to stay beside them and get hit, don’t act so surprised when they hit you. What the hell were you expecting?'</p>

<p>Another person said: 'Avoiding an accident is a must. Both drivers wrong. Hand your licence in,.'</p>

<p>Although social media users accused the dash cam driver of breaking the 'unspoken' road rule of letting motorists merge when the outside lane is set to end, the Alfa Romeo driver legally has ride away.</p>

<p>That means the ute must give way or stop until it's clear to cross the broken lines.</p>

<p>According to NSW road rules: 'When the lane you are driving in ends and you have to cross lane lines to merge with the traffic in another lane, give way to traffic in the other lane.'</p>

<p>When crossing broken lines and merging into the right lane, a driver must give way before crossing</p>

<p>Although the dash cam driver is technically not at fault, social media users placed the blame squarely on the Alfa Romeo.</p>

<p>'What would it have cost the driver to slow down a smidge to let the merging driver in, bugger all in my estimation!,' one wrote.</p>

<p>'The road is a shared space, people need to learn this and be a little more forgiving and generous. Just a thought that costs nothing.'</p>

<p>'I agree the Alfa driver technically has right of way, but be a bit more courteous for for gods sake!,' added another.</p>

<p>'The Amarok was in front of the Alfa enough to safely pull in. The Amarok indicated in plenty of time as well. The Alfa driver needs a bit of driver education. I think most of us can agree on that.'  </p>
