<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The doom-saying expert whose Coronavirus fears saw new restrictions imposed on Britain is the richest mandarin in Whitehall, worth £10million - and could become even richer if his former employers develop a vaccine.</p>

<p>Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, projected a gloomy forecast this week for the Covid-19 pandemic as infections rose sharply.</p>

<p>It came two days before it was revealed he holds a deferred bonus of 43,111 shares in GlaxoSmithKline, worth £600,000 from his time as president of the multinational drug company.</p>

<p>The firm is one of many trying to develop a vaccine to treat deadly coronavirus as a further 6,874 people tested positive today. The Government said there was no conflict of interest and he had done nothing wrong.</p>

<p>GSK - one of 20 firms racing to find a cure - is where Sir Patrick earned part of the sizeable fortune that allows he and his family to live a life of luxury.  </p>

<p>In a rare interview in 2015 he shot down critics who suggested he took the corporate role for the money after an academic early career at University College London.</p>

<p>He insisted to Radio 4's The Life Scientific: 'There’ll be people that carp and say you’ve gone to the dark side, you’ve done it for money, whatever.</p>

<p>'There’s nothing you can do about that. That’s why the personal reputation bit you need to be comfortable with, before you make a decision like that.'</p>

<p>He went on to say he chose the company for the good it could do in bringing important new treatments to the world. </p>

<p>Currently he and his family live in a substantial semi-detached Victorian house worth £1.8million, which they bought in 2018 with cash.</p>

<p>They had to complete extensive renovations after it had been left completely gutted by a fire before they were involved in the property.</p>

<p>Parked on the drive was an R-class Mercedes which can cost up to £30,000 when bought new.</p>

<p>It is not known whether it belongs to his doctor wife Sophia Ann or any of their children.</p>

<p>The property is one of the largest on the well-heeled street, which is lined with expensive cars. </p>

<p>Sir Patrick's house is worth at least £1.8millon and was paid for in cash back in 2018</p>

<p>Sir Patrick projected a doomsday scenario if coronvirus rate of infection carried on growing</p>

<p>A local said: 'It is the poshest house in the area, to look at it you would think someone very important must live there.'</p>

<p>Sir Patrick was born in Essex in 1960 and educated at Truro school in Cornwall, which costs nearly £30,000 to board now. </p>

<p>He had considered being a chef but then began a life in science and medicine at university before going to GSK.</p>

<p>It would be the role that catapulted him to the prominence he holds today, so well-known he has own entry in Who's Who, which lists his hobbies as 'mushrooming, cooking, gardening' and 'playing tennis badly'.</p>

<p>Just 12 days into the job he was rubbing shoulders with royalty, pictured with Prince Andrew at an event. </p>

<p>After six years at GSK his base salary as Executive Director was £780,000 a year.</p>

<p>When he left he cashed in £5 million worth of shares he got from them from his time working there until March 2018.</p>

<p>And in 2017 when he took his current role as Government Chief Scientific Adviser Nature, the international weekly science journal, said his salary was up to £180,000 a year – more than the Prime Minister. </p>

<p>Now he is one of the most recognisable faces in Britain, after standing next to him day after day for the summer's coronavirus press conferences. </p>

<p>As Professor of primary care at Oxford University Trisha Greenhalgh said at the start of lockdown in March 'I knew Patrick Vallance before he was famous'.</p>
