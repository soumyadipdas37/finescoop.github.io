<p>Their samba routine opened with the familiar Zulu vocals from Circle Of Life and striking African savanna imagery, but the dancing didn't reach the level of their detailed costumes and staging.</p>

<p>'I am stunned. I actually have never, ever seen a samba like this one. I don't know where to begin. But, if you were dancing with the Brooklyn Bridge, you could get more bounce, you know. You just walked through it. Samba needs life, bounce, and energy. You can't just sleepwalk through a samba. I'm sorry, but that's what I feel, my love,' Bruno said before awarding them just three points.</p>

<p>Carrie Ann saluted Carole for the 'love' that she put into the dance, while Derek praised their hair and makeup.  </p>
