<p>It's over: She recently split from her boyfriend Tom Brazier. Yet Laura Anderson revealed she hadn't given up on love as she dished out some relationship advice to her followers</p>

<p>Asked when the 'right time' is to end a relationship, Laura mused that it's ok to move on', as she explained, 'don't feel bad about wasting your time on someone else'.</p>

<p>She admitted that she could see the dilemma however, as she would 'rather be dumped' than have to dump someone herself as break ups are so 'difficult'.</p>

<p>Reflecting on her own experiences, Laura revealed that she spent five years letting a former flame in and out of her life as she helped a fan who wanted to 'move on' from an ex. </p>

<p>Laura said: 'The reason you can't get over him is because you're letting him come in and out of your life. That needs to be a block, delete situation. </p>

<p>'You obviously like the attention, which we all do, but it's a no from me'. </p>

<p>The straight-talking Scot went on to offer some advice on how to get through a break up, stating that 'time is a healer'. </p>

<p>She added: 'Getting over someone is just like breaking a habit, like the texting in the morning and the evening, little things you used to do together. </p>

<p>'You just need to do new things and sort of like, text your friend instead of him'. </p>

<p>The Q&amp;A comes after Laura revealed she split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom just days after moving back to Scotland.</p>

<p>Despite initially intending for Tom to join her in Glasgow six months into her move, it now seems their romance is off.  </p>

<p>Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story on Thursday: 'Thankyou for all the DMs asking about Tom and I since I moved up north.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.'</p>

<p>Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat.</p>

<p>Laura, who moved to the swanky Park Circus area of Glasgow earlier in the month, said she had fully hoped Tom would join her in her new home.</p>

<p>She had gushed that she'd never met anyone like him before adding: 'I'm still going to move to Scotland and Tom is looking to follow me up in the next six months. He's the cherry on top of the cake.'</p>

<p>Laura first rose to fame for her appearance on the 2018 edition of Love Island, where she embarked on ill-fated relationships with Wes Nelson and Paul Knops.</p>

<p>After leaving the villa, the bombshell dated series one winner Max Morley in October.</p>

<p>The duo were in an on-off relationship, with the stars splitting in December, reuniting in May 2019, and eventually calling it quits for good in July last year.</p>
