<p>Canadian news anchor Kori Sidaway (pictured) has hit back at a viewer who criticised her for showing 'too much cleavage' and warned that 'this generation of women doesn't stand for harassment of any kind'</p>

<p>Kori, a journalist for CHEK News in Victoria, shared the scathing email she received from a critic asking her to 'dress appropriately' on Twitter this week, with the above caption</p>

<p>'This screenshot was sent to me and pretty much all my colleagues in my newsroom in an attempt to strategically shame and police my body,' Kori wrote on her social media accounts.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately this happens quite often with women working in the public eye, but this was one of the worst.</p>

<p>'To the nameless keyboard warrior(s) who try to reduce women in media, in politics, in whatever workplace, in public or at home — into an outfit or a body part — just a warning, this generation of women doesn't stand for harassment of any kind.'</p>

<p>The email was sent with two attachments, one being a photo of Kori during a news segment in which she wore a white V-neck blouse with a colourful necklace.</p>

<p>The email (pictured left) was sent with two attachments, one being a photo of Kori during a news segment in which she wore a white V-neck blouse. The second image showed a woman's chest while she sported a plunging garment (pictured right), with the sender suggesting the audience at home actually saw such a daring look when viewing Kori</p>

<p>Kori (pictured), a weekend reporter for CHEK news who has been on TV screens in Canada for two years, shared the post on Tuesday and it's already received more than 4,500 likes</p>

<p>'Breaking news. Too much cleavage can break your news story. Don't let it happen to you. Episode: Sunday September 6, 5-7pm,' they wrote.</p>

<p>'Attached are two photos. What you think we see and what we actually see. Dress appropriately, it was hard work to get there. Thanks, Vancouver Island Cleavage Patrol.'</p>

<p>Social media users offered their support for the journalist, with some fellow TV reporters even revealing their own instances of body shaming.</p>

<p>'Back when I was anchoring - like back in the 90's (the olden days), I was told to always wear long sleeves because my bare arms were too provocative. My. Bare. Arms!' wrote one person.</p>

<p>Another Twitter user said: 'Strange message Kori, perhaps it was terrible attempt at humour. Nevertheless it was in poor taste. I enjoy your newscasts and hope that you don’t let this negativity spoil your day.'</p>

<p>Kori thanked her followers for making her 'feel so much less alone, so supported and so much more empowered' (pictured)</p>

<p>A third added: The top is beautiful and there was nothing wrong with it. The keyboard critics need to shut up because no one cares about their antiquated ideas or sexist opinions. Women journalists aren’t there to be ogled, we’re there to do our job. Full stop.' </p>

<p>Kori thanked her followers for making her 'feel so much less alone, so supported and so much more empowered'. 'You helped take my lemon and made lemonade,' she added.</p>
