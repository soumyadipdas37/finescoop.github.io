<p>But while their goalkeeper returned to the Spanish capital for pre-season last Friday before Belgium's Nations League campaign got underway, Hazard remained with his compatriots but ended up taking no part in the action. </p>

<p>Hazard had reportedly considered not joining up with his Belgium team-mates but Martinez had convinced him that his country needed him in the dressing room and that it would give him the best possible preparation ahead of the new season.</p>

<p>Hazard's decision to stay with Belgium has reportedly frustrated the Spanish giants as they are desperate for him to kick on following a difficult start to life in Madrid.</p>
