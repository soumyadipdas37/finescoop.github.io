<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tariq Lamptey is a target for Bayern Munich but the Champions League holders are almost £10million short of Brighton's asking price, according to reports in Germany.</p>

<p>Right-back Lamptey, 19, has made a brilliant start to the 2020/21 Premier League season and is being lined up as back-up to Benjamin Pavard for Hansi Flick's side.</p>

<p>But according to German outlet SPORT1, Bayern offered just £14m to the Seagulls, who are demanding a fee closer to £23m.</p>

<p>Brighton wonderkid Tariq Lamptey is a target for Bayern Munich according to reports</p>

<p>Lamptey has been impressive and was good against Marcus Rashford's Manchester United</p>

<p>Moreover, last season's treble winners will have to act fast with the window closing on October 5 and with reported first-choice target Sergino Dest closing in on a move to Barcelona.</p>

<p>Lamptey has quickly become a permanent fixture in Graham Potter's side despite having only made the move to the seaside club from their Stamford Bridge counterparts for £4m in January.</p>

<p>The Brighton wonderkid left Chelsea's Under-23 set-up to join the first-team squad at the Amex and his lightning displays have turned heads around the Premier League.</p>

<p>Lamptey already has three assists to his name this campaign, including one against his former club in their first game of the new top-flight season by setting up Leandro Trossard in the Seagulls' 3-1 defeat.</p>

<p>Reports claim Bayern want Lamptey as back-up to regular right-back Benjamin Pavard</p>

<p>The Bundesliga and Champions League holders lost out on Ajax's Sergino Dest to Barcelona</p>

<p>However, the news of Bayern Munich's interest in him comes a day after Sportsmail revealed the German side are considering a move for Norwich City right-back Max Aarons.</p>

<p>Barcelona had also approached Norwich over a deal for Aarons but their offer of a loan with the option to buy for £20million was rejected with the Championship side demanding a guaranteed fee.</p>

<p>Bayern had hoped to sign Barcelona-bound Dest but have always had Aarons on their list of options and are weighing up an offer.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old Aarons also has interest from Roma and AC Milan who have been discussing figures with Tottenham for Serge Aurier.</p>

<p>Bayern boss Hansi Flick is in a race against time to add to his squad before Monday's deadline</p>

<p>The German outfit are also interested in signing Norwich City right-back Max Aarons</p>
