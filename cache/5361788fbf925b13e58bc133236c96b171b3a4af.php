<p>The video was made by Van Greyson Heart (left) inside a Target branch in Nora, Indiana, with a song titled ‘All I want for Christmas is a Few Dead Cops’ playing in the background.</p>

<p>The TikTok video shows them concocting a ‘Blue Lives Matter’ drink in an in-store Starbucks, that was prepared with bleach, ice and what they called the blood of innocent black men’</p>

<p>In the footage, Greyson, who is not seen on-screen, is heard narrating their special recipe for the beverage they concocted exclusively for supporters of police.</p>

<p>‘Hi guys, I updated my recipe for the Blue Lives Matter drinks,’ Greyson is heard saying in the beginning of the clip.</p>

<p>‘First we’re gonna start with bleach,’ the barista says as they pour more than a cup of blue liquid into a container in the video. ‘All the way to the third line,’ Greyson says.</p>

<p>Greyson then explains that they're going add plenty of ice, ‘because, you know, cops love ice,’ – an apparent allusion to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>

<p>The barista then puts together another concoction in a blender that includes a blue coloring that’s used for ‘special’ Starbucks drinks.</p>

<p>‘And then we add this special blue ingredient that Starbucks has,’ the barista says. ‘We do have it and yes, we are holding out on you.’</p>

<p>The worker then pours the allegedly poisonous contents over the ice and bleach already in the cup.</p>

<p>‘Pour that right on top. Ahh that beautiful blue color,’ the worker says, before setting the drink on the counter and adding a straw.</p>

<p>‘And even though it has a straw-less lid, we’re going to serve it with a straw because, ya know, [cops] only think about themselves,’ Greyson concludes, bringing the 40 second clip to an end.</p>

<p>Greyson then explains that they're going add plenty of ice, ‘because, you know, cops love ice,’ – an apparent allusion to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>

<p>Greyson has since made their Twitter account private. In a Facebook post uploaded Sunday, they included a link to the song ‘All I Want for Christmas is More Dead Cops’</p>

<p>In a statement denouncing the employee’s actions, Target called the viral video ‘appalling and unacceptable’, adding that the individual responsible no longer works at the branch (above)</p>

<p>The video has since been removed from TikTok following breaches of the app’s community guidelines. The video does, however, continue to be shared widely on Twitter.</p>

<p>Starbucks confirmed it was aware of the video but declined to comment, pointing out that employees who work in Starbucks locations within Target stores are employed by Target.</p>

<p>The Seattle-based coffee chain did however condemn the ‘video and any behavior that threatens violence against others’.</p>

<p>In their statement, Target said their company has ‘rigorous food safety procedures in place, which this team member egregiously violated with this behavior.</p>

<p>‘We’re deeply sorry for this disturbing video,’ the company continued.</p>

<p>The spokesperson went on to say that after talking to the employee, the company determined the drink had not actually been served to a guest.</p>

<p>The company also said that they don’t believe actual bleach was used in the making of the drink, rather a combination of milk, water and coloring.</p>

<p>Target was first alerted to the video after a woman downloaded it from TikTok and uploaded it to Twitter, directing the post to Target.</p>

<p>Greyson has since made their Twitter account private. In a Facebook post uploaded Sunday, they included a link to the song ‘All I Want for Christmas is More Dead Cops’.</p>
