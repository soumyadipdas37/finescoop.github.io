<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A beaver, a set of bottle feeders and a gender-inclusive Santa Claus are among the new emojis to be unleashed with Apple iOS 14.2 next month, it has been revealed.</p>

<p>While some of the new additions were teased back in July, yesterday's release of iOS 14.2 beta 2 to developers has unveiled more of the upcoming options.</p>

<p>These include a comically disguised face, a 'happy crying' emoji, a boulder, a sink plunger and gender options for the tuxedo and wedding dress-with-veil emojis. </p>

<p>A beaver, a set of bottle feeders and a gender-inclusive Santa Claus are among the 100 new emojis — pictured — to be unleashed with Apple iOS 14.2 next month, it has been revealed</p>

<p>The working list of emoji are determined by the California-based Unicode Consortium.</p>

<p>Third parties can make applications in support of new emoji.</p>

<p>Candidates must work well at emoji sizes, convey new meaning and must appear to be in demand.</p>

<p>Patterns of existing emoji usage are used to help guide the uptake of new additions to the Unicode Standard.</p>

<p>In total, 100 new additions to the iOS emoji library will be installed when iOS 14.2 is rolled out to Apple's customer base, likely sometime in October.</p>

<p>Additions will include a transgender symbol, bubble tea, pinched fingers, a boomerang, a dodo, a beaver, a piñata, nesting dolls, a coin, an anatomical heart, lungs, a ninja and a tamale. </p>

<p>Unlike their competition, Apple has largely stuck to its style of hyper-realism for the new emoji — as opposed to the more cartoon-esque illustrations of other software developers.</p>

<p>The update will also roll out new skin tone variations as well as the gender-inclusive emoji variants. </p>

<p>Not only will the additions feature on iPhone and iPad devices, but they will also be available on watchOS, an Apple spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The new emoji have also been spotted in the latest developer releases of macOS Big Sur beta — and are also expected to see a general launch with macOS 11 Big Sur next month. </p>

<p>While some of the new additions were teased back in July, yesterday's release of iOS 14.2 beta 2 to developers has unveiled more of the upcoming options. Pictured, the new family of bottle-feeding caregiver emojis — building off of the breast-feeding emoji added in iOS 17</p>

<p>The new emoji include a 'disguised face', a 'happy crying' emoji, a boulder, a sink plunger and new gender options for the existing tuxedo and wedding dress-with-veil emojis, as pictured</p>

<p>Last week, the Unicode Consortium announced the release of Emoji version 13.1, which will include such additions as the 'face with spiral eyes' — to reflect the chaos of this year — 'burning heart', assorted new skin tones and 'couples with hearts'.</p>

<p>However, these new emoji will not appear as part of next month's iOS update.</p>

<p>Instead, these version 13.1 icons will likely not be rolled out until late 2021.</p>

<p>Emojis may be a fun form of communication but they are destroying the English language, a recent study by Google has revealed.</p>

<p>Smiley faces, love hearts, thumbs up and other cartoon icons - rather than words - are the preferred method of communication by teenagers, who are considered the worst offenders regarding the decline in grammar and punctuation.</p>

<p>More than a third of British adults believe emojis are the reason for the deterioration in proper language usage, according to the study commissioned by the Google-owned site YouTube.</p>

<p>Emojis were first used by Japanese mobile phone companies in the late 1990s to express an emotion, concept or message in a simple, graphic way. Now, Twitter feeds, text messages and Facebook posts are crammed with them</p>

<p>Of the two thousand adults, aged 16 to 65, who were asked their views, 94 per cent reckoned English was in a state of decline, with 80 per cent citing youngsters as the worst offenders.</p>

<p>The most common errors made by Brits are spelling mistakes (21 per cent), followed closely by apostrophe placement (16 per cent) and the misuse of a comma (16 per cent).</p>

<p>More than half of British adults are not confident with their command of spelling and grammar, the study also found.</p>

<p>Furthermore, around three-quarters of adults rely on emoji to communicate, in addition to a dependence on predictive text and spell checking.</p>

<p>The use of emojis has seeped into our culture to such an extent that the Oxford Dictionary's 'Word of the Year' in 2015 wasn't actually a word at all - it was the Face With Tears emoji, which shows just how influential the little graphic images have become.</p>
