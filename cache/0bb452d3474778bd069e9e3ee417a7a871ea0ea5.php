<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Bale completed his emotional return to Tottenham on Wednesday night in a move that was driven by Jose Mourinho.</p>

<p>The Wales international has agreed terms on a year-long deal that Sportsmail understands to be worth more than £13million – part of which will be financed by Real Madrid – and he is relishing the prospect of relaunching his career at the club that propelled him to stardom.</p>

<p>There is no indication yet as to when Tottenham – who face Lokomotiv Plovdiv in the Europa League on Thursday – will make an official announcement but it will happen once a few minor contractual issues are signed.</p>

<p>Gareth Bale has sealed a sensational return to Tottenham to end his Real Madrid nightmare</p>

<p>Bale rose to superstardom at Tottenham before leaving seven years ago to join Real Madrid</p>

<p>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is said to have played a key role in bringing Bale back to Spurs</p>

<p>Bale's return to North London, seven years after he was sold to Madrid for a the world record fee of £90million, is laced with sentiment but it was a move that Mourinho, Tottenham's manager, felt was absolutely imperative following his side's dismal 1-0 defeat to Everton last Sunday.</p>

<p>Mourinho was adamant that Tottenham needed Bale's driven and dynamism to enliven Tottenham's attack and negotiations accelerated following discussion with Chairman Daniel Levy. </p>

<p>It is understood no players will go in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The deal for Bale stands a separate transaction as Tottenham will also Sergio Reguilon, Real Madrid's left-back who has also been linked with Manchester United, today; He is due to undergo a medical and will sign a five-year with Tottenham, paying £27million fee.</p>
