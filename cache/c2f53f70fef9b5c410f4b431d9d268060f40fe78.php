<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A growing number of Australian women are exercising in a full-length leotard slashed with a gaping cut out that exposes most of the midriff.</p>

<p>Designed by Melbourne sportswear label Contrology Active, the all-in-one 'Curve Bodysuit' is described as 'the perfect fit for every body' - resulting in a surprisingly flattering effect on various shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>The asymmetrical one-piece - which costs $219 on the brand's official website - is available in extra small through large, with double-lining across the bust for added support. </p>

<p>The streamlined style which clings to the body is said to be more efficient for vigorous exercise like high-intensity interval training, because there's no loose material to get in the way of your work out. </p>

<p>Dozens of Australian activewear brands are creating full-body workout suits which promise to mould perfectly to women's natural curves, providing support in all the right places. </p>

<p>Among the best-selling designs are Solo Staple's $180 bodysuits, which are available in neutrals like black as well as pastel shades of pink and purple.</p>

<p>Solo Staple founder Alicia Superina came up with the idea when she found the leggings, sports bras and baggy tank tops she usually wore running were interrupting her flow.</p>

<p>'I was constantly tucking in or readjusting,' she wrote on her website.</p>

<p>After two years of research Ms Superina launched her brand on Valentine's Day 2020, with a collection of highly practical bodysuits that have been flying out of stock ever since. </p>

<p>Pip Edwards' Bondi label P.E Nation created the $220 Drive Force Catsuit complete with a v-neck in honour of the trend, and has sold out in size extra large.</p>
