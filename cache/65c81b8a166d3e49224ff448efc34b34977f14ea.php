<p>Fake news! The Bachelor's Bec Cvilikas (left) has poured cold water on rumours that finalist Bella Varelis (right) had a 'secret deal' with Warner Bros. guaranteeing her a spot in the top two</p>

<p>'The other rumour was that Bella had in her contract that she would make the final two because she already had work that she could have said yes to,' Jackie said.</p>

<p>'B.S.,' Bec replied firmly. 'Tell me you guys don't believe this? We all have the same contract. There's no special [clauses].'</p>

<p>Bec can be considered a fairly reliable source of information when it comes to Bella: not only are they best pals, they also live together in Sydney. </p>

<p>Jackie's co-host Kyle Sandilands also made it clear he didn't believe the rumours. </p>

<p>He said the idea that an unknown model/actress like Bella could have any say in the outcome of a major TV show like The Bachelor was 'rubbish'. </p>

<p>As reported in the August 10 issue of Woman's Day, there was 'chatter' among the cast that Bella had been discreetly 'promised' a spot in the top two.</p>

<p>The magazine's source further alleged that Bella was a 'producer's pet' who played up her emotions and delivered for the cameras.</p>

<p>No VIP treatment! Bec stated that all the contestants 'have the same contract' and 'there's no special clauses'. Pictured: Bella Varelis</p>

<p>Not true: According to the August 10 issue of Woman's Day, there was 'chatter' among the cast of that Bella had been discreetly 'promised' a spot in the top two. Pictured with Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>Bec was eliminated from The Bachelor on Wednesday's episode alongside Izzy Sharman-Firth, after both women failed to receive a rose.</p>

<p>As of Thursday afternoon, 31-year-old nurse Irena Srbinovska is Sportsbet's favourite to win Locky Gilbert's heart, with odds of $1.30.</p>

<p>Bella, 25, is tipped for second place, with odds of $2.95.</p>

<p>The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10</p>
