<p>The vial was part of a relic, one of several containing the late-pontiff's blood, that had been stored in the chapel of Spoleto Cathedral, around 60 miles north of Rome.</p>

<p>But on Wednesday evening the cathedral's sacristan, who is in charge of protecting the building an its contents, discovered it was missing.</p>

<p>A golden relic containing a vial of Pope John Paul II's blood has been stolen from a church in Spoleto, Italy, where it was kept in the chapel (file image of a similar relic)</p>

<p>The cathedral called police, who have now launched an investigation to try and find the culprits, Repubblica reported.</p>

<p>Investigators are reviewing CCTV from inside the building, but have not yet identified a suspect.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Renato Boccardo, archbishop of the cathedral, put out an appeal for the thieves to return the relic. </p>

<p>'I dare to hope that it's a shallow act that was not intended to offend the sensibilities of the faithful,' he said.</p>

<p>'I also dare to hope that this rash act wasn't done to make money.'</p>

<p>The vial was given to the church in 2016 by Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, then archbishop of Krakow, who was a longtime aide to the Polish pope who died in 2005.</p>

<p>The relic is one of several containing the blood of Pope John Paul II, which are housed in churches around the globe</p>

<p>The relic in which it sits was due to be placed in the church of Saint Nicolò in Spoleto, which is currently under construction.</p>

<p>It was being kept inside a chapel alongside the Cross of Alberto Sotio, which was created in 1187.</p>

<p>The chapel was secured by a locked gate that stands about 3ft off the ground, and is not open to visitors.</p>

<p>It also contains an alarm system which protects the cross, though the relic was not protected, allowing the thieves to get away undetected.</p>
