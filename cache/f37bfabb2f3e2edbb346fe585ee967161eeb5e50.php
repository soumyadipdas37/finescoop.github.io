<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When it comes to fashion, we are all inspired by what we see; whether it be a well-dressed celebrity, a blow-your-mind catwalk presentation or even a super stylish every-day passerby.</p>

<p>As fashion editors, we're moved by all of the above, and then some. We're exposed to under-the-radar labels; we get a first-hand look at collections months before they hit stores; we're tapped into brands with chic-yet-cheap offerings and we shop - a lot.</p>

<p>To share our knowledge, FEMAIL brings you Style Swoon, a weekly series of the latest, greatest and on the verge. We hope this Friday series will serve as a buying guide and point of inspiration for the clotheshorses and fashion fanatics alike.</p>

<p>MYKITA + MM6 Maison Margiela</p>

<p>MM6 (Maison Margiela's contemporary line) expands its avant-garde vision of fashion to eyewear by teaming up with Berlin-based eyewear brand MYKITA to create a line of sunglasses with attitude.</p>

<p>The collaboration takes inspiration from the MM6 fall 2020 collection of circular silhouettes.</p>

<p>Almost every garment from MM6's fall 2020 collection was cut in a circular pattern, so that jackers, blazers and vests sloped down arms and dresses hung with full-circle skirts. </p>

<p>Oversized yet ultra-lightweight, the handcrafted sunglasses showcase the unique possibilities of the MYLON material and the technology of 3D manufacturing. </p>

<p>The eyewear is available in a neutral color palette consisting of white, nude, black and blue with a bit of red peppered in. </p>

<p>The MYKITA + MM6 Maison Margiela special edition is available now at MYKITA and MM6 boutiques as well as selected stores. Styles retail for approximately $500.</p>

<p>Beautiisoles seeks to fuse style and comfort with a selection of fashionable footwear designed to feel good</p>

<p>BEAUTIISOLES LAUNCHES</p>

<p>No pain, no gain?  Not if Beautiisoles has anything to do with it!</p>

<p>The newly launched shoe brand seeks to fuse style and comfort with a selection of fashionable footwear designed to feel good.</p>

<p>The shoes are created by snack food manufacturing executive and competitive ballroom dancer Robyn Shreiber and fashion designer Daniella Clarke, founder of women’s denim brand Frankie B. </p>

<p>'We are an affordable luxury shoe brand with an emphasis on comfort,' explains Robyn, who came up with the idea for the brand after experiencing a foot injury, which developed after years of wearing uncomfortable shoes.   </p>

<p>In 2018 the entrepreneur partnered with Danielle Clarke who Robyn calls "the most famous woman in jeans."</p>

<p>'I've always had a passion for shoes,' said Daniella. 'I’m completely shoe obsessed, and yet women have been struggling with this fashion dilemma for decades.'</p>

<p>What sets Beautiisoles apart from other brands on the market is that their shoes are designed with a wider toe box and greater heel support.</p>

<p>'Using cutting edge technology for an ever-expanding range of silhouettes, our shoes will absorb shock, wick sweat, and provide antibacterial properties,'  Daniella said.</p>

<p>Made for the modern day gal, 'we have multiple looks, fabrications and colors for any occasion; everything from a hot date to a board meeting.'</p>

<p>Prices range from $245 - $385. </p>
