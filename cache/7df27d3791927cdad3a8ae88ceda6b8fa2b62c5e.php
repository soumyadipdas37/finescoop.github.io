<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jude Bellingham proved during his first training session with the Under 21s that England were right to promote him by four age groups.</p>

<p>The midfielder jumped from the Under 17s after Borussia Dortmund made him the most expensive 17-year-old in history by signing him from Birmingham for £25million.</p>

<p>Bellingham made his mark at St George's Park on Monday and is likely to be handed a debut in Friday's European Championship qualifier in Kosovo.</p>

<p>17-year-old Jude Bellingham has impressed in training with the England Under-21 squad</p>

<p>'When we got on the pitch, you couldn't tell he wasn't an Under 21 player,' said manager Aidy Boothroyd.</p>

<p>'He's not thinking he's arrived. He's got work to do to be the best he can be, which I always think is refreshing from young players. He's very level-headed, as Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood are.</p>

<p>'That's why they are where they are. Humility is a trait of successful people. He's got it in abundance. My first impression is that he is a very impressive young man on and off the pitch.'</p>

<p>Bellingham was promoted by four age groups after signing for Borussia Dortmund for £25m</p>

<p>Bellingham was dropped off by his parents and immediately endeared himself to the backroom team.</p>

<p>'It's always a good gauge, how players deal with the staff,' Boothroyd added.</p>

<p>'He's been excellent, just a very positive, genuine young guy who everybody likes. Jude is in exactly the right place right now.</p>

<p>'I looked at Jude in the early part of last season. He's done so well that he's managed to get himself a move and hopefully he can carry that on.'</p>

<p>Under-21s boss Aidy Boothroyd admitted Bellingham has made a very good first impression</p>

<p>Boothroyd has kept faith with many of the players who have served him well in the past and regularly checked in with them over the last 10 months.</p>

<p>'We've had plenty of phone calls and FaceTime,' he said.</p>

<p>'It's been a tough time and I'm just delighted to be coming out of it and seeing a few faces.'</p>

<p>Brighton wing back Tariq Lamptey has been added to the squad after Crystal Palace winger Eberechi Eze withdrew.</p>
