<p>One next-door neighbor who gave her name as Marty said: 'This is the kind of place where Julia will fit in and be comfortable.</p>

<p>'I think that's why she's invested here, it's a place where she can be a person, a mom, a wife.</p>

<p>'It's a beautiful house with great views but it's modest, it's perfect for people who want to just blend in and have a quiet life to raise three children.</p>

<p>'The places to hang out are the Presidio, which is great for hiking, and Sacramento Street, our little shopping street.</p>

<p>'There are no bars but lots of restaurants, clothing shops, art shops, designer shops.</p>

<p>'Do you think she's going to be excited about being neighbors with me?</p>

<p>'It's a lot of dough that she spent buying the place although maybe not so much for her.</p>

<p>'It's probably like 15 minutes of a movie for her.'</p>
