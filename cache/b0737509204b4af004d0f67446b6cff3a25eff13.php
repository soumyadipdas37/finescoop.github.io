<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>'Chaos and screaming' is what a hairdresser recalls immediately after his customer was fatally stabbed in a Sydney barbershop, a court has been told.</p>

<p>Zaya Amanoael was in the final stages of Alfredo Isho's haircut in January 2019 when a man wearing a motorcycle helmet entered the Bossley Park shop and stabbed Mr Isho in the chest.</p>

<p>'I was cleaning. I was blow-drying the hair,' he told the NSW Supreme Court on Wednesday, through an interpreter.</p>

<p>'While I was putting the hairdryer back, I noticed someone hit (Mr Isho).</p>

<p>'He was sitting there and someone hit him in his chest but I didn't know what it was.'</p>

<p>Fredon Laith Botrus, 20, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Alfredo Isho (pictured), who was knifed while seated and gowned at Bossley Park's Classico Hair Studio on January 11, 2019</p>

<p>Fredon Laith Botrus, 20, denies he was the man under the helmet who plunged a knife into the seated and gowned Mr Isho.</p>

<p>The jury has been told the blade punctured Mr Isho's right lung and severed an artery, leading to his death later that day.</p>

<p>CCTV of the attack's immediate aftermath shows the motorcyclist ride away from the rear of Classico Hair Studio as Mr Isho walks out of the shopfront and makes a phone call.</p>

<p>The jury heard several witnesses ushered the injured man back into the shop before watching him become pale.</p>

<p>Botrus, who has pleaded not guilty to murder, was arrested two-and-a-half hours after the attack - with police finding the alleged getaway vehicle in the garage of the Bossley Park home he shares with his parents.</p>

<p>He told police he was in bed at the time of the attack.</p>

<p>Police and paramedics are seen at the scene of the stabbing</p>

<p>Mr Amanoael said he thought Mr Isho's attacker used his right hand.</p>

<p>'It happened so quick, he came from that (back) door so I presume it was on the right side,' he said.</p>

<p>He said he didn't see the attacker leave due to 'chaos and screaming' inside the parlour.</p>

<p>The hairdresser said he'd earlier confronted the helmeted man, who was at the shop's back door and saying he wanted a haircut.</p>

<p>'I said go through the entrance door (and) I closed the screen door but I did not lock it,' he said.</p>

<p>The attack occurred moments after Mr Amanoael returned to finish up Mr Isho's cut.</p>

<p>The assailant had dark, Middle Eastern-like skin under his eyes, the jury heard.</p>

<p>While the hairdresser couldn't recall the eye colour, Mr Amanoael agreed he told police on the day the helmeted man had black eyes.</p>

<p>The trial continues.</p>
