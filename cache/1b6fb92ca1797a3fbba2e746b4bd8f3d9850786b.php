<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Labour MP and anti-gambling campaigner Tom Watson has taken a job advising a betting firm that owns Paddy Power and SkyBet.</p>

<p>Mr Watson will join Flutter Entertainment, one of the UK's biggest gambling firms, and advise them on best practice, as reported by The Financial Times.</p>

<p>The 53-year-old has been a vocal campaigner for tougher restrictions on the industry which has been under the spotlight this year for its treatment of vulnerable gambling addicts.</p>

<p>It comes amid a government review of the 2005 Gambling Act in Autumn this year, which could potentially lead to further regulation of betting firms.</p>

<p>Tom Watson (pictured outside Labour HQ in July last year) will join Flutter Entertainment, one of the UK's biggest gambling firms, and advise them on best practice</p>

<p>Mr Watson said: 'I have a long-standing interest in this sector and consistently called for action to protect those that may be potentially vulnerable to harm.</p>

<p>'In taking on this role in Flutter, I intend to get under the bonnet of the business.</p>

<p>He added: 'I strongly believe that working collaboratively with Flutter in this way will allow me to continue to drive positive change'.   </p>

<p>Mr Watson resigned from his West Bromwich East seat in 2019, choosing not to contest the general election. </p>

<p>He was the former deputy leader of the Labour Party and survived an attempt by Jeremy Corbyn allies to oust him. </p>

<p>Mr Watson - who first entered parliament in 2001 - was one of the most prominent campaigning MPs in the country. He rose to prominence after his role in exposing the hacking scandal at the Rupert Murdoch-owned News of the World. </p>

<p>He also wrote a best-selling book called 'Downsizing' about his battle to lose eight-stone and reverse his Type-2 Diabetes. </p>

<p>It is not the first role Mr Watson has taken up since he left front-line politics. He was appointed Chairman of UK music in April this year. The industry group represents the interests of the UK music industry. </p>

<p>Peter Jackson, chief executive at Flutter Entertainment, said:  'We have to work harder than ever before to find a way to continue to bring great products and brands to our customers while always having the need to protect the vulnerable clearly in mind. Tom will hold a mirror up to help us make sure we are getting this balance right,' </p>
