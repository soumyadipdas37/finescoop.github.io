<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donny van de Beek hasn't started a Premier League game since joining Manchester United from Ajax, which has infuriated his agent Sjaak Swart.</p>

<p>Speaking to VoetbalPrimeur, Swart said: 'A substitute, I don't like it at all. I couldn't do it myself, standing in with four minutes to play.' </p>

<p>The Dutch midfielder joined United for £40million, and fans were excited to see him form a midfield partnership with Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba. </p>

<p>Donny van de Beek has made just two substitute appearances in the league for Man United</p>

<p>Boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is still trying to figure out how to shape his midfield players</p>

<p>However, he has only featured as a substitute during their first two games, playing 23 minutes against Crystal Palace and only coming on for the final moments against Brighton. </p>

<p>His contributions have been helpful though, scoring against Palace and helping win the penalty that gave United the game against the Seagulls. </p>

<p>'I have to say he did three more good things,' said Swart. 'The penalty, where the winning goal came from, it came from him.</p>

<p>Van de Beek scored a goal in his Premier League debut against Crystal Palace this month</p>

<p>'Normally they should've lost 7-1. Brighton hit the post and bar five times. They have a nice team, but that should not happen to Manchester United.' </p>

<p>Van de Beek did start for United in their Carabao Cup win over Luton, and was substituted after 78 minutes. </p>

<p>With a huge game coming up against Tottenham next, boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may stick to his tried and trusted trio of Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba and Fernandes for that encounter. </p>

<p>Of the three, Pogba is the man most likely to be under threat from Van de Beek's arrival.</p>
