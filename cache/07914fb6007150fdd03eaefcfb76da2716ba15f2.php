<p>Stepping out: Tammy Hembrow went braless in a tight white tank top that exposed her bare midriff and left little to the imagination on the Gold Coast on Tuesday</p>

<p>She paired the top with blue jeans and accessorised with a matching denim handbag.</p>

<p>The star's blonde hair looked slightly dishevelled due to the windy weather as she made her way into Sskin.</p>

<p>After checking out the clinic, Tammy headed elsewhere to have her nails professionally done. </p>

<p>Amy, 30, and Emilee, 28, only opened Sskin last month, but it's already one of the hottest spots on the Gold Coast.</p>

<p>Thirsty? The 26-year-old clutched an Iced Americano from Starbucks in her hand </p>

<p>'The phone has been off the hook. We haven't advertised at all,' Emilee told the Gold Coast Bulletin on Friday. </p>

<p>She said appointments for treatments have been selling like hot cakes, adding: 'Our doctor is already booked out for the next three weeks.' </p>

<p>The mother-of-two also revealed that someone recently walked into the clinic asking for a treatment. </p>

<p>Emilee recalled: 'I'm not too sure where they found the address, but they said "When can I get a treatment? I'm not too sure what type of treatments you have but I want one." </p>

<p>Nailed it! The influencer was later spotted getting her nails professionally done </p>

<p>Amy told the publication that they're offering treatments and aesthetics they've often experienced at clinics in the US.</p>

<p>'This place (SSKIN) is where we would want to go. From the whole aesthetic through to the treatments,' the mother-of-one said.</p>

<p>The Hembrow sisters recently told Daily Mail Australia that their clinic's top priority is to enhance, rather than change their clients' natural beauty.</p>

<p>'We really stand by enhancing your natural beauty, not changing anything on your face,' Emilee said.</p>
