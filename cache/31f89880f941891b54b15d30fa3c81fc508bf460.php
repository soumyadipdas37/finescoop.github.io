<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tim Atkins, 32, (pictured with his wife)  was placed in an induced coma with serious injuries after he was stomped on during an arrest in Melbourne on Sunday</p>

<p>The brother of a man who was stomped on by police has slammed the officers involved and revealed why the hours leading to his violent arrest were equally as traumatic. </p>

<p>Tim Atkins, 32, was placed in an induced coma with serious injuries after he was booted in the head in Melbourne's north on Sunday. </p>

<p>Footage of the incident quickly went viral, with a second clip later surfacing showing him being rammed by a police vehicle during the pursuit.</p>

<p>The father-of-three had fled the Northern Hospital in Epping after waiting more than a day for a bed in the psychiatric ward while suffering a bipolar episode. </p>

<p>The matter is now under investigation by the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission and Victoria Police's Professional Standards Command and the Senior Constable in the video has been suspended.   </p>

<p>'They've rammed him, kicked him, stomped on him, and he is a mentally ill patient that was happy to go to hospital to receive help. How can anyone be treated that way? It was just inhumane,'  Mr Atkins' brother Dylan told A Current Affair on Tuesday. </p>

<p>'They're here to serve us and make the world a safer place, not create an environment where people see this on the news and are then scared of police.' </p>

<p>Speaking out to shed light on the events prior to the arrest, Mr Atkins' family said the issues they faced trying to get him help were just as horrific as the incidents caught on tape. </p>

<p>Mr Atkin's brother Dylan (pictured) said the way his sibling was treated by police was 'inhumane'</p>

<p>On Saturday, Mr Atkins called Dylan and his mother and asked to be taken to hospital, saying he felt unwell. </p>

<p>While in the car, Dylan called a psychiatric ward to alert them of their arrival but was told by a nurse not to come because there were no available beds. </p>

<p>'I said, "pardon". And she said, "there's no beds here". I said, "you need to look up his file, you have to look up my brother's name",' Dylan said. </p>

<p>'It kind of made me think about my brother desperately, how people wanted help. We were turned away. But how many other people were also turned away too?' </p>

<p>Mr Atkins was then instead taken to the emergency department at Melbourne hospital where he spent 20 hours waiting for assistance. </p>

<p>He reached breaking point and ran out of the facility, prompting health staff to call police concerned for his welfare and the violent arrest unfolded.   </p>

<p>His father Glen Atkins said his son could have been killed. </p>

<p>'Doesn't matter even if he was a criminal, which he's not, he's never hurt anybody in his life. How can anybody do that to someone, let alone a policeman? I really do hope he loses his job and gets a criminal offence,' he said. </p>

<p>His brother Bryce told Daily Mail Australia Mr Atkins had woken up from his coma but it was unclear whether he would suffer any permanent injuries. </p>

<p>Footage of the incident (pictured) filmed by bystanders quickly went viral after it was shared on social media</p>

<p>'He's all stiff and sore and confused at what's happened. He can't really move his neck or anything like that,' he said. </p>

<p>'He can pretty much just remember being thrown to the ground.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, authorities failed to alert Mr Atkin's wife Emily about the ordeal for up to six hours after the incident - instead discovering what happened from a viral video posted to Facebook. </p>

<p>Bystanders Jake Edwards and his partner George Michael filmed the incident from their car.</p>

<p>Mr Edwards said the wife had allowed them to tell media on her behalf that he is a loving dad.</p>

<p>'She was not notified by the hospital until 10pm at night, and as of (Monday afternoon) still hasn't been contacted by Victoria Police,' Mr Edwards claimed to Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>Mr Edwards described what he and his partner saw as 'unjustifiable' and 'disgusting' behaviour from officers at the weekend.</p>

<p>'We've seen a police car ram into (the man) sending him flying a few metres across the road,' Mr Edwards recalled.</p>

<p>He is a loving father of three and roof plumber who was seeking mental health support prior to his arrest</p>

<p>Glen Atkins (pictured) said his son 'has never hurt anybody in his life' and he hopes the officer who kicked him is stood down</p>

<p>'He got up and the foot chase continued. They run up to the median strip (and) the man did throw a punch or two.</p>

<p>'Then pepper spray was used, punches from the police were thrown. While they were bringing him down and he wasn't restrained yet there were kicks to the head.</p>

<p>'The worst part of it all is while he was restrained with five to six officers on him, there was a stomp to the head and then a knee to the head. Disgusting.'</p>

<p>Victoria Police said the incident unfolded after officers were called over reports of a male behaving erratically about 4.10pm.</p>

<p>'Upon arrival the male allegedly became aggressive and damaged a police vehicle whilst attempting to avoid arrest,' a police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'During the highly dynamic incident a police officer was assaulted and OC spray was deployed before the man was arrested and subsequently taken to hospital for assessment.'</p>

<p>Deputy Commissioner Paterson on Tuesday described the officer's actions in the video as 'inappropriate'.</p>

<p>'I look at the footage and I go, 'this is not what Victoria Police does'," he said at a press conference.</p>

<p>'I look at that, and I go, ''that's inappropriate. That's an inappropriate use of force".'</p>
