<p>Dietitian Susie Burrell has revealed how she slashes hundreds of dollars off her family's grocery bills without compromising on taste or nutrition.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two, from Sydney, shared her supermarket tricks she swears by for shopping on a budget - and the best time to buy meat and fish.</p>

<p>Instead of opting for well-known brands, the nutritionist said you are better off buying supermarket owned products such as butter, cheese, flour and oats that taste no different from expensive alternatives - and cost just a fraction of the price.</p>

<p>'When you seek out the cheapest varieties of produce which have minimal packaging you will slash $20 to $30 from your shop each week while the family is still eating exactly the same foods,' Susie told Essential Kids.</p>

<p>She suggested including one plant-based meal to your weekly menu as this can help reduce your grocery bill every week (picture of Susie's plant-based spring salad)</p>

<p>Susie pointed out one of the most expensive spends at the supermarket are fresh meats such as chicken and fish, which can cost up to $10 per meal.</p>

<p>She suggested including one plant-based meal to your weekly menu as this can help reduce your grocery bill every week.</p>

<p>Her go-to meals to boost intake of vegetables and dietary fibre include soup, nachos or tacos made with kidney beans and tomato-based pasta with cheese.</p>

<p>Susie said fresh and usually pricey vegetables can be substituted with frozen alternatives, assuring shoppers the nutritional value is exactly the same for a fraction of the cost. </p>

<p>Her favourite meals to make using frozen vegetables include chicken pies, spaghetti bolognese, stir fries with cauliflower bakes and pasta bakes.</p>

<p>For fresh produce, she said the best time to shop for meats and seafood at the supermarket is around 7pm each night</p>

<p>Susie suggested creating your own snacks (picture of wholegrain crackers, nuts, cut up cucumbers, cheeses, and strawberries)</p>

<p>Susie said packaged snacks can hike up your weekly grocery bill so she suggested keeping a look out for heavily discounted specials in the catalogues.</p>

<p>But for a healthier diet, she suggested baking your own muffins and banana bread or creating your own snacks using staple ingredients such as yoghurts, cheese and wholegrain crackers.</p>

<p>For fresh produce, she said the best time to shop for meats and seafood at the supermarket is around 7pm each night.</p>

<p>'This is the time of day that meat, chicken and fish that is nearing its use by date have their prices slashed by up to 50 per cent,' she explained.</p>

<p>'Choosing your proteins based on these price savings will significantly slash your weekly shopping bill, whilst assisting your meal planning each week, as will buying these proteins in bulk when they are on sale.'</p>
