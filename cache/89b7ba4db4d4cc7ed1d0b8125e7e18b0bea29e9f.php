<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A public information campaign urging people in Britain to get back to work following the coronavirus lockdown has had its first air date pushed back.</p>

<p>The series of adverts encouraging people to return to offices was originally due to begin tomorrow, but it will not now start until next week at the earliest.</p>

<p>The UK campaign is yet to have been given a slogan because Downing Street officials are still divided on how strong the encouragement should be.</p>

<p>The move suggests the Cabinet Office wanted more civil servants back to their desks before urging the rest of the country to return, reported the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson is said to want wants Parliament 'back to normal' by the end of 2020, urging MPs to lead from the front on the return to workplaces.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson spoke to Conservative backbenchers of the importance of returning to workplaces as the UK seeks to strike a balance between public and economic health.</p>

<p>Downing Street fears huge job losses in town and city centre shops and cafes if workers do not return to their pre-lockdown commuter patterns.</p>

<p>The concourse at London Waterloo station was very quiet during rush hour yesterday morning</p>

<p>But there are allegedly divisions in Government over whether the time is right, with the Covid-19 rate still growing in parts of the UK, to get employees back into work.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Bank of England told MPs the Government's Covid-safe guidelines for employers meant it was unlikely offices could get back up to full capacity.</p>

<p>This is due to the need for staff to be kept apart, with workplace advice including introducing one-way systems and staggered shift times.</p>

<p>Employers are also advised to limit the number of colleagues that staff members are exposed to in order to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>Alex Brazier, the bank's executive director for risk, told the Commons Treasury Committee: 'Because of those constraints I don't think we can expect to see a sudden and sharp return of lots of people to the very dense office environments that we were used to.</p>

<p>'We should expect a more phased return depending on the public health outcomes that we'll see over the coming weeks and months.'Â </p>
