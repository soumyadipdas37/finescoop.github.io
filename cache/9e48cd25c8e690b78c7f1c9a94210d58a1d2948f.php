<p>Shocking footage shows the 32-year-old man, wearing just a pair of boxers, swinging the huge blade at passersby outside a Poundland near Elephant and Castle.</p>

<p>A group of onlookers at one point attempt to rip the weapon from his hands when his back is turned but are forced to flee seconds later.</p>

<p>Eye witness Ryan Harris, 23, said he heard the commotion on the high street, and looked out his window to see the man holding the weapon.</p>

<p>'My housemate and I could hear commotion for a good five to ten minutes, but thought nothing off it as we live by the high street,' he said.</p>

<p>'It got louder and we looked out my window and could see the man standing with a long thin blade.</p>
