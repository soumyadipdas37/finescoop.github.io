<p>Turning heads: The Love Island beauties had all eyes on them as they made a glamorous arrival to the Ivy Asia St Paul's in London</p>

<p>The girls' night out came after Kady returned from a weekend away in Scotland.</p>

<p>The influencer documented her romantic stay in Glasgow after being whisked away by on/off boyfriend Myles Barnett, 26.  </p>

<p>She recently left fans confused after announcing she is still with Myles and they will live in their new home 'as a couple', weeks after confirming yet another 'break-up'.</p>

<p>The brunette previously took to social media to confirm she will be living in her renovated bungalow with former TOWIE star Myles, 26, when it is finished.</p>

<p>The duo bought a Hertfordshire property together in April 2019 with plans to completely transform it into a two-storey house. </p>

<p>'Me and Myles can't wait to live in our forever home and will continue to share our journey with you.'</p>

<p>'Now I understand when people say renovating/moving home is more stressful than having a baby.' (sic)</p>
