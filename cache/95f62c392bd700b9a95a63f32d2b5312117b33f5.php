<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England youngsters Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood could face disciplinary action after footage emerged of the pair allegedly bringing girls back to the team hotel in Iceland.</p>

<p>The pair made their senior international debuts in the win over Iceland on Saturday - but those accomplishments have now been overshadowed.</p>

<p>Players have been given strict guidelines to ensure Covid safety - and the images - who have been published by Icelandic outlet DV - appears to show Foden and Greenwood disregard those protocols.</p>

<p>A Snapchat clip released by DV appears to show England youngsters Phil Foden (pictured) and Mason Greenwood in a hotel room with female company</p>

<p>Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood have broken Iceland's Covid-19 restrictions after inviting girls back to their quarantine hotel in Iceland.</p>

<p>After a spike in local transmissions, the government recently clamped down and brought in further restrictions.</p>

<p>Although the England team are exempt, foreign travellers arriving in the country are being forced to quarantine for 14 days before they are allowed to travel freely in the country.</p>

<p>The pair's conduct in allegedly bringing girls back is also likely to have contravened the FA's behavioural rules for players whilst on international duty.</p>

<p>In the short clip, Foden and Greenwood appear to be wearing their new England training wear and the players are now likely to be in hot water with management.</p>

<p>Foden has a two-year-old son and a long-term girlfriend, while United star Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend back in May. </p>

<p>Manchester City midfielder Foden started for Gareth Southgate's side against Iceland on Saturday night, making his senior international debut, while Greenwood came off the bench to achieve the same accolade.</p>

<p>While the pair would have been looking ahead to England's next fixture against Denmark in Copenhagen on Tuesday night, they will now leave Iceland under a dark cloud. </p>

<p>The pair were both absent from England training on Monday and it is as yet unclear whether they will face any punishment by the Football Association.</p>

<p>England boss Gareth Southgate is set to face the media for a press conference on Monday afternoon, where he is likely to field questions about Foden and Greenwood's behaviour. </p>

<p>United's Mason Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend Harriet Robson back in May</p>

<p>City star Foden regularly posts pictures with his young son, who turned one back in January</p>

<p>Greenwood, pictured in training on Sunday, now faces being kicked out of the England squad</p>

<p>Foden was all smiles on Sunday but is now in danger of leaving the camp under a dark cloud</p>

<p>In an interview with DV, one of the girls in the Snapchat video allegedly filmed in the hotel room said: 'We had no idea about these [Covid-19] rules, they never said we could not take pictures.'</p>

<p>Another girl claimed to have notified the England stars that the pictures were in circulation with a Snapchat message, but 'they have not opened it'.</p>

<p>She also claimed to have been in a relationship 'with one of the boys for a few days', noting: 'The only thing I can say is that I had been talking to one of them for a few days. I'm not going to say where.'</p>

<p>England's senior stars trained on Monday morning, but Foden and Greenwood were absent</p>
