<p>In a controversial article, The Great Asbestos Hysteria (Mail, February 23), we said that according to the Health and Safety Executive, the risks from white asbestos products are ‘ insignificant’, and ‘arguably zero’ in the case of lung cancer.</p>

<p>The HSE assessments related to specific levels of exposure to white asbestos fibres, not white asbestos products, and found a risk from higher levels.</p>

<p>The article said that asbestos in UK schools is almost all white. According to the HSE, the more harmful brown asbestos was also frequently used in schools.</p>

<p>The writer was in error in saying that the HSE had been forced to withdraw a series of commercials claiming that mesothelioma kills 4,500 a year.</p>

<p>In fact, the advertisements were based on an estimate of 4,000 deaths from all asbestos-related disease.</p>
