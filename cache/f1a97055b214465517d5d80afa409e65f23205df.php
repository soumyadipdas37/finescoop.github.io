<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Michael Schumacher's son Mick appears set to follow in his father's footsteps with Formula One training sessions planned for this year, according to reports.</p>

<p>As the son of Ferrari legend Michael, there are high hopes for 21-year-old Mick, while he fights for this season's Formula 2 title.</p>

<p>German television channel RTL had earlier received information that Mick was in line for his debut on Friday in the Tuscan Grand Prix free practice.</p>

<p>Mick Schumacher looks set to follow in Michael's footsteps with F1 training sessions planned</p>

<p>Mick is the son of F1 legend Michael Schumacher, who won seven World Championships</p>

<p>But the outlet now claims he will definitely not be driving for a Ferrari client - Alfa Romeo or Haas - in Formula 1 free practice in Mugello, with the report quoting his PR advisor Timo Gans as saying :'I cannot confirm this report [of him participating].'</p>

<p>However, the same report also states should this year take part in some F1 training sessions, but details such as when and where are yet to be decided.</p>

<p>Mick will also drive the Ferrari F2004, his father's last world champion car, before the team's 1000th Grand Prix race on Sunday in Monza, Italy.</p>

<p>Whether he would follow his father in representing Ferrari remains to be seen, their team principal Mattia Binotto has already talked up Mick's abilities from inside the Ferrari Driver Academy.</p>

<p>Mick is currently competing for the F2 title and won his first race of the season on Saturday</p>

<p>Last month, Binotto told Bild am Sonntag: 'He's doing very well this season in Formula 2. His job was to improve and make progress and he is doing that.</p>

<p>'We'll soon discuss what we're going to do with him next year.'</p>

<p>Schumacher won his first F2 race of 2020 with victory in the feature race at Monza on Saturday.</p>

<p>A series of finishes on the podium means has the German sits in second place in the junior division's championship, six points behind fellow Ferrari Academy ace Callum Ilott.</p>

<p>But Mick will realise he has a long path ahead to live up to the legacy of father Michael, 51, who holds the record for the most World Championship titles in the sport.</p>

<p>Mick (fifth from right) is also set to race his father's F2004 before the team's 1000th Grand Prix</p>

<p>However, the seven-time winner suffered a serious head injury in December 2013 when he was skiing with his son, one of two children with wife Corinna.</p>

<p>After years of treatment, the racing legend is reportedly conscious but his family have ensured his health matters remain incredibly private.</p>

<p>FIA president Jean Todt, who oversaw much of Schumacher's success at Ferrari, visited the German in July and said: 'I saw Michael last week.</p>

<p>'He is fighting. I hope the world will be able to see him again. That is what he and his family are working towards.'</p>
