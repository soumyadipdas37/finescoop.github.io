<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A pair of shoebox sized nanosatellites built in the UK thanks to a £6million government grant will launch from a Russian Soyuz rocket later this month.</p>

<p>The spacecraft will join a fleet of more than 100 objects in low Earth orbit that work together to track the whereabouts of ships and predict global ocean traffic.</p>

<p>The two satellites are made by Spire Global UK and are part of a set of four equipped with a machine learning algorithm to estimate the times vessels will arrive in ports.</p>

<p>The first pair will go up on a Soyuz rocket on September 24 and the other two are expected to launch on an Indian PSLV launcher on November 1.  </p>

<p>The British-made satellites are designed, built, tested, integrated and assembled by Spire Global staff at the firms headquarters in Glasgow. </p>

<p>The spacecraft will join a fleet of more than 100 objects in low Earth orbit that work together to track the whereabouts of ships and predict global ocean traffic</p>

<p>Despite being the size of a shoebox and weighing no more than standard cabin baggage, the nanosatellites have all the functionality of a conventional satellite. </p>

<p>Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said nanosatellites are enormously powerful in what they can do.</p>

<p>The four being launched by Spire Global have been described as 'supercomputers' in space - with more than a teraflop of processing power. </p>

<p>It's hoped future nanosatellites could be launched from British soil - with the first expected to go up from Scotland as early as next year. </p>

<p>'These four Spire satellites are aimed at making trade hyper-accurate, with technology that makes business more cost effective and efficient,' said Turnock.</p>

<p>'Scotland's space sector is booming. Our membership of ESA is benefiting companies across the UK, and we are committed to supporting the space economy in every region.'</p>

<p>Spire Global UK is a satellite-powered data company that provides predictive analysis of global shipping, aviation and weather forecasting.</p>

<p>Peter Platzer, chief executive and co-founder of Spire Global said their goal was to help companies and organisations predict 'what's next' and make better decisions.</p>

<p>'This month we are moving this forward by launching a true super-computer into orbit – 1-2 teraflops! – so that we can analyse data right in orbit, using smart algorithms and machine learning,' Platzer said.</p>

<p>'This will allow us to get better, smarter and faster analytics to our customers for their business decisions.' </p>

<p>The services have been developed under a European Space Agency (ESA) Pioneer programme, which is a partnership project co-funded by the UK Space Agency.</p>

<p>Elodie Viau, Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications at ESA, said this was a prime example of the benefits of the Pioneer programme.    </p>
