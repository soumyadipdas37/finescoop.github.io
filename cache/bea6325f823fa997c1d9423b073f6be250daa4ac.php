<p>Busy: Cara De La Hoyde, 30, gave her Instagram followers some candid updates on life as a mother of two over the bank holiday weekend as she breastfed her daughter Delilah while getting glam for a new filming project</p>

<p>Cara was hard at work on Monday, telling fans she was filming a secret project with her husband Nathan Massey. </p>

<p>The day started early for the reality star as she shared a photo of herself with clips in her hair and glam makeup on, while breastfeeding her little girl. </p>

<p>'#mumlife never stops, off to film something exciting,' she captioned the candid phoot.</p>

<p>On Sunday Cara uploaded one of her regular updates on IGTV, sharing with fans that 'it's been a really tough week for everyone.'</p>

<p>Tired: On Sunday Cara uploaded one of her regular updates on IGTV, sharing with fans that 'it's been a really tough week for everyone'</p>

<p>Delilah had been suffering with colic, which Cara explained 'has got a lot better' thanks to cutting out certain food in her own diet including anything spicy and fizzy drinks.  </p>

<p>She also revealed she was hoping to start expressing some of her milk this week to 'see if that takes a bit of pressure off of me,' and so other family members can feed her newborn.</p>

<p>And while she said she was happy with Delilah's progress, Cara admitted it's been a struggle juggling toddler Freddie with her baby.  </p>

<p>A baby with colic cries a lot as well as clenching their fists, going bed in the face and arching their back.  </p>

<p>Health visitors and doctors will usually advise to:</p>

<p>Other remedies mothers hear about are anti-colic drops, herbal and probiotic supplements, changes to their diet if they're breastfeeding or applying gentle pressure to your baby's spine (spinal manipulation) or skull (cranial osteopathy).</p>

<p>But the NHS says there is little evidence for these so far. </p>

<p>'It's really stressful. He doesn't listen to anything I say. If I tell him off, he tells me off or scratches and pinches me. But then I don't really want to tell him off. He's not really a massive joy to be around at the moment,' she said.</p>

<p>'I don't want him to feel pushed out,' she admitted. 'I've sorted out the colic, and now it's one thing after another, this week has been very tiring.'</p>

<p>She ended her honest video by saying: 'Two kids, a whole new ballgame... Hopefully I don't end up murdering my child, or my husband, or maybe myself!'</p>
