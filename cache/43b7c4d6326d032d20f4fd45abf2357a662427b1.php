<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It appears the memory of Spygate lingers on with Chelsea boss Frank Lampard. The Blues have applied for planning permission to install seven pole-mounted CCTV cameras at their Cobham training base.</p>

<p>Chelsea’s architects say they wish to provide a ‘proportionate and unobtrusive scheme to suitably protect the site from identified risks or security breaches’.</p>

<p>The new measures will feature ‘leading camera and software technology to ensure any attempts to breach the perimeter are identified in real time and appropriately responded to’.</p>

<p>There will be a state-of-the-art mix of ultra-low-light cameras — which can make out an image in poor light, and fixed thermal and infra-red cameras — that can record images in the dark.</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds, who were rumbled when sending a worker to spy on training sessions while Lampard was manager at Derby, will renew their rivalry with the west London club in December.</p>

<p>ENGLAND SNUB PENNYHILL FOR LENSBURY   </p>

<p>England will shun Pennyhill Park, and the £3million performance centre the cash-strapped Rugby Football Union paid for, to stay at the Lensbury hotel for the forthcoming internationals.</p>

<p>Insiders say Pennyhill Park, which features a pitch laid out to match the dimensions of Twickenham, is not popular with the players given its remote location in Bagshot, Surrey.</p>

<p>The training complex was built for the 2015 World Cup, and was handed over to South Africa after England’s early exit.</p>

<p>England have shunned Pennyhill Park training base for a stay at the Lensbury Hotel</p>

<p>RFU sources say the decision was made because the Lensbury can separate their staff from customers and is more economically viable as they do not have to take over and pay for the whole of the complex. An RFU spokesperson said: ‘The Lensbury offered the best performance option for our training bubble.’</p>

<p>Insiders added England expect to be back at Pennyhill in the future.</p>

<p>MEDIA GURU TAKES UP ROLE WITH LIONS  </p>

<p>The British and Irish Lions have appointed Tim Percival as head of communications for next year’s tour to South Africa. Percival, who will be on 12-month secondment from Northampton Saints, has previously worked as the England team’s communications manager.</p>

<p>PAYET MOSAIC INCLUSION ANGERS HAMMERS FANS  </p>

<p>Not the best of starts to the season for West Ham, who seem to find new ways to upset their supporters. The hapless Hammers, who have lost their opening two Premier League fixtures, have put a mosaic around the exterior of the London Stadium to mark the club’s 125-year history. However, the decision to place a picture of Dimitri Payet, whose acrimonious departure still rankles with some, between legends Sir Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters MBE has triggered an angry response.</p>

<p>‘Talk about a thorn between two roses,’ said one. ‘Payet was a brilliant player but the way he left was a disgrace and it’s not right.’</p>

<p>West Ham sources say the order of the mosaic is two players from the past flanking one from more recent times and that there is a belief within the club that fans has mellowed towards Payet in the three years that have passed since he left for Marseille.</p>

<p>At least the Hammers have got something right — a statue of Hurst, Peters and Bobby Moore is to be built outside the former Olympic venue. </p>

<p>BBC SPORT CHIEF AMONG TOP EARNERS   </p>

<p>It may have gone unnoticed last week, but there was a new entrant on the Beeb’s list of top earners. Ben Gallop, BBC Sport’s head of digital and radio, was listed as earning between £150,000 and £154,999.</p>

<p>Readers of this column may recall that Gallop was the member of senior management who broke the news in a terse email that executioner-in-chief Mike Carr, heavily involved in the dumbing down of content as part of the continuing drive for a younger audience, was leaving. ‘He’s calling all the shots in the department,’ one insider explained, ‘so it’s no surprise to see him make the list.’ As expected, Carr has set up a new podcast firm, along with fellow former Beeb employees Steve Jones, Tom Fordyce and Louise Gwilliam.</p>

<p>TOP FLIGHT CLUBS GROW FRUSTRATED WITH GOVERNMENT  </p>

<p>There is increasing frustration at the Government among Premier League clubs over a lack of clarity about the return of supporters. Many have already started making contingency plans with Manchester United, for example, having sent text messages to supporters who paid for season tickets to offer them a refund.</p>

<p>BIELSA QUERIES EXTENSIVE MEDIA DUTIES </p>

<p>Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa and the club’s communications team had talks with Premier League officials last week over the top flight’s media demands. Insiders say that concerns were raised over the volume of interviews required with rights-holders and added that the discussions were amicable.</p>

<p>Bielsa is not a huge fan of speaking to the media in one-on-ones and would prefer to treat all equally, but the club were told the rules are the same for all and the Argentine carried out all his duties after the 4-3 win over Fulham on Saturday.</p>

<p>SEARCH ON FOR MARKETING CHIEF AT PREMIERSHIP RUGBY   </p>

<p>Premiership Rugby are searching for a new chief marketing officer with the incumbent due to depart after spending less than seven months in the role. Zoe Clapp started in post on February 24 after 15 years at UKTV and was responsible for overseeing marketing and brand, events, communications, social and digital products.</p>

<p>Clapp is going to YouTube, where she will be the UK director of marketing. Insiders say Clapp is leaving to pursue a ‘once in a lifetime’ opportunity and will be missed.</p>

<p>YAYA MISSES OUT ON BORO MOVE DESPITE QUARANTINING  </p>

<p>Spare a thought for poor former Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo who saw a move to Middlesbrough collapse earlier this month.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, a free agent after leaving Toulouse, had spent two weeks quarantining at a hotel at Middlesbrough’s Rockliffe training ground ahead of making the move only to fail a medical, seeing his hopes of a return to English football dashed.</p>

<p>The news was also a blow for Covid-suffering Middlesbrough boss Neil Warnock, although he quickly brought in another former Gunner, Chuba Akpom from Greek club PAOK.</p>
