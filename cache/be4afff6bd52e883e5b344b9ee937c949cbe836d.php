<p>The Fine Line singer, 26, made his acting debut in 2017 film Dunkirk and producers were apparently impressed with his efforts in the war flick.</p>

<p>It has long been questioned what Harry's next acting project would be and fan's prayers have been answered as he is believed to have signed his next film. </p>

<p>New project! Harry Styles has reportedly replaced Shia LaBeouf as the star of Don't Worry, Darling</p>

<p>Harry's co-stars in the thriller include Florence Pugh [Little Women] and Chris Pine [Star Trek], who both signed on to the film earlier this year.</p>

<p>Sources told Deadline after impressing director Olivia Wilde and Florence during an initial meeting, the feeling was mutual to get him to sign on.</p>

<p>Don't Worry, Darling is the next directing outing for Olivia, who previously directed Booksmart and is slated to be the head of a new Marvel film.</p>

<p>Impressive: The Fine Line singer, 26, made his acting debut in 2017 film Dunkirk and producers were apparently impressed with his efforts in the war flick</p>

<p>Little has been announced about the film as yet, however it will be set in an isolated, utopian community in the 1950s California desert, according to the publication.</p>

<p>The screenplay was written by Katie Silberman, who also wrote Booksmart, based on a spec script by Shane and Carey Van Dyke.</p>

<p>The film production is rumoured to be starting this autumn as New Line Cinema has apparently listed it as a high priority, after bagging the rights in a heated bidding war.</p>

<p>Exciting! It has long been questioned what Harry's next acting project would be and fan's prayers have been answered as he is believed to have signed his next film</p>

<p>The news comes after it was reported Harry has struck up a friendship with fellow actor Emma Corrin, as she expects her 'life to change dramatically' when series four airs. </p>

<p>The actress, 24, who will play Princess Diana in the forthcoming season, is believed to have met the Watermelon Sugar hitmaker, at one of his gigs last year. </p>

<p>But while there is reportedly 'nothing romantic' between the pair, Emma and Harry 'know loads of the same people'.</p>

<p>Fame: The Crown star Emma Corrin has reportedly struck up a friendship with Harry as she expects her 'life to change dramatically' when series four airs (pictured as Princess Diana)</p>

<p>Emma is also said to share the 'same stylist' as the Adore You singer and the pair are similar in the way that they are 'both private people'.  </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'She is expecting her life to change dramatically when The Crown airs, because suddenly everyone will be interested in who she is, so it's nice to have pals like Harry who know how to deal with fame.'    </p>

<p>Harry's representative declined to comment. MailOnline has contacted Emma's representative for comment.</p>

<p>The long-awaited fourth series of The Crown will document Diana's meeting and eventual marriage to Charles, along with the births and early years of the two Princes.</p>

<p>Diana married Charles in 1981, and the couple welcomed sons William in 1982 and Harry in 1984. After separating in 1991, the couple divorced in 1997.</p>

<p>Emma's casting was announced in April 2019, with The Crown's creator Peter Morgan calling her 'a brilliant talent who immediately captivated us when she came in for the part of Diana Spencer.'</p>

<p>'As well as having the innocence and beauty of a young Diana, she also has, in abundance, the range and complexity to portray an extraordinary woman who went from anonymous teenager to becoming the most iconic woman of her generation.'</p>

<p>The next series will be released later this year, but it was recently revealed that the show will conclude after its fifth season, with Imelda Staunton taking the throne as its final Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>Show creator Peter Morgan confirmed the Netflix drama - currently airing its third season with Olivia Colman in the regal role - would not include a sixth season while revealing Imelda, 64, will take the role 'into the 21st century'.</p>

<p>This means that current Royal scandals including the allegations made against Prince Andrew as well as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's 'Megxit' drama won't be featured on the Netflix hit.</p>

<p>It comes after Harry has taken a break following the success of his second solo album Fine Line and is set to go on tour next year if Covid-19 restrictions are eased. </p>
