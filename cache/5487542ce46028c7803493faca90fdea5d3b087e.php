<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former England captain Rio Ferdinand says Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has lavished praise on summer signing Hakim Ziyech to him - hailing one particular attribute too.</p>

<p>Ziyech joined the Blues officially this summer in a Â£37.8million transfer from Ajax - although the deal was initially back in February.</p>

<p>The winger is yet to make his Chelsea due to a slight knee injury sustained last month in a pre-season friendly against Brighton but already he has impressed Lampard, according to Ferdinand.</p>

<p>Hakim Ziyech is yet to make his Chelsea debut but he's already impressed Frank Lampard</p>

<p>According to Rio Ferdinand (right), Lampard has described the winger's passing as 'ridiculous'</p>

<p>'You know what I spoke to Frank the other day about Ziyech and he said: 'His passing is ridiculous.' Ferdinand told the Five YouTube channel.</p>

<p>'I'm looking to see them passes when he cuts with his left foot and has the likes of Mason Mount, Timo Werner Kai Havertz etc. all making runs and I think Ziyech will be putting it on a plate for these boys.'</p>

<p>The 27-year-old is one of six new signings at Stamford Bridge so far this transfer window. Out of those new arrivals only Timo Werner and Kai Havertz were available to play in their opening 3-1 Premier League win at Brighton on Monday night.</p>

<p>Of the two, Werner made the bigger impact winning a penalty - which Jorginho converted - and Ferdinand believes the striker will prove to be the signing of the season.</p>

<p>'I'm going to go for Werner,' Ferdinand continued.</p>

<p>'He looked sharp against Brighton and I saw him against Spain the other day - he tore them one.'</p>
