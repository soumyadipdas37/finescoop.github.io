<p>And on Sunday, never-before-seen yearbook photos obtained by BachieFunny, show what the ladies' man looked like in his teens.</p>

<p>A much-younger Locky, now 31, is seen smiling while standing in the back row of his annual high school photos more than 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Blast from the past! Locky Gilbert is pictured left, as a young pupil in high school, and right, in a recent still of him on The Bachelor</p>

<p>Locky flashed his familiar smile at the camera, but had a full turf of brown hair covering his ears and forehead. </p>

<p>The throwback image appeared to have mixed reactions with fans, with one person commenting: '[Locky] reminds me a bit of Wreck It Ralph.'</p>

<p>Locky chose to write back, commenting with a love-heart emoji: 'I'll take that.' </p>

<p>While another said: 'What's everyone laughing at, he's cute even back then.'</p>

<p>Throwback: The image appeared to have mixed reactions with fans, with one person commenting: '[Locky] reminds me a bit of Wreck It Ralph' </p>

<p>Upon seeing the throwback image, evicted contestant Kaitlyn Hoppe jokingly commented: 'Let's not start this trend.' </p>

<p>The popular Instagram account also shared high school photographs of contestant Bella Varelis and Bachelor In Paradise star Jamie Dornan in a separate post.</p>

<p>'This really isn't well,' Jamie wrote underneath the throwback photo of himself.</p>

<p>Bella, who was 15 years old when she posted the tweets, appears to have had a bad case of Bieber fever in the early 2000s. </p>
