<p>Speaking about her move to the US, she said: 'I think the thing that would surprise the young me about her future is what's happened in America.</p>

<p>'I mean, I never went to America when I was a kid. I never went to Disneyland or anything like that, I'd never even seen it before. And when I did go, I never made a great proclamation: ''I'm going to crack America.''</p>

<p>'A relationship had just ended and I just fancied a fun adventure. It did feel crazy at times... There's no way my 16-year-old self would believe me if I went back and told her she'll be there one day.'</p>

<p>'I can confirm… yes.' Cat teased, when asked about it by Chris. 'We have filmed a documentary, it's going to be aired at the end of the year.</p>

<p>'We went back to the studio where we did it. They rebuilt the set. We all cried. I walked in and [Ant &amp; Dec] were doing their interview and Dec was crying and I was like ''ok you're crying!'' and then at the end of my interview I was like [sobs] ''waaah!''</p>
