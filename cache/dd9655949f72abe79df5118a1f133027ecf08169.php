<p>Owning it: Ant Middleton has admitted his controversial comments over coronavirus 'backfired' after he was criticised over his 'outdated' post amid the pandemic</p>

<p>Ant has since admitted that his comments were wrong and told Good Morning Britain hosts Piers Morgan and Susanne Reid: 'I went from hero to zero'.</p>

<p>Explaining that he felt 'sheltered' from the virus when he made the comments and never expected the global outbreak of the deadly virus.</p>

<p>He said: 'Some of my controversial quotes on social media were in the moment. I was in New Zealand sheltered from the coronavirus. </p>

<p>'When it comes to a global pandemic which I didn't know was going to happen, that came and bit me in my behind. Sometimes I get it wrong and put my hand and up said look my information was wrong.'   </p>

<p>Mistake: The SAS: Who Dares Wins star, 39, revealed once lockdown hit his post 'crashed', as followers turned on him for encouraging people to go about their business</p>

<p>'Everyone was like, Ant we agree with you and then lockdown came and the pandemic hit and that Instagram post was outdated, it crashed really quickly. I went from hero to zero.'</p>

<p>Ant insisted he was happy to own up to his mistake after receiving online backlash over his comments made at the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>He said: 'Failure is an everyday part of life. It's not a nasty word. I'll fail till the day I die and so will everyone else. Once you acknowledge it, you can turn it around. The moment you shy away from it, this negative circle will keep coming.'</p>

<p>Holding my hands up: Ant has since admitted that his comments were wrong and told Good Morning Britain hosts Piers Morgan and Susanne Reid: 'I went from hero to zero'</p>

<p>Unexpected: Explaining that he felt 'sheltered' from the virus when he made the comments and never expected the global outbreak of the deadly virus</p>

<p>'When it comes to hardship, that's what builds resilience. Sometimes we do come second third or maybe last. You get resilient from that.' </p>

<p>'To ignore that in schools, it's unhealthy. It doesn't prepare you for everyday life. You're wrapped up in cotton wool. When you're expected to stand on your own two feet, they're not prepared for it.'</p>

<p>Ant previously admitted he had made a mistake with his post and deleted it because it contradicted government advice and he 'wouldn't want people to come across that now'.</p>

<p>Mistaken: Ant insisted he was happy to own up to his mistake after receiving online backlash over his comments made at the start of the pandemic</p>

<p>In March he confessed: 'I've decided to admit that I made a mistake. I always talk about integrity, take that on the chin and come back to the UK and do the best that I possibly can,' Middleton said.</p>

<p>He praised the emergency services as well as NHS staff and other key employees working throughout the crisis.    </p>

<p>The original post read: 'Am I still out travelling the world? Yes. Am I still shaking hands? Yes. Am I still cuddling fans at the airport? Yes. Am I washing my hands and keeping my hygiene to a high standard as always? Yes.</p>

<p>'Has my life changed? No. Am I going to let some disease, COVID-19, dictate my life? Absolutely not. Get out there, don't change, F**k COVID-19!'</p>

<p>Controversial: It comes shortly after he was reportedly been forced to quit his role as the Royal Navy's Chief Cadet after just nine months </p>

<p>Captioning his clip, Ant said that fans should thank him if they end up contracting the virus from him, because it will ultimately make them stronger.</p>

<p>He said: 'I do love my fans who come up to me and want a cuddle or a handshake but feel really awkward, so I simply pull them in anyway. </p>

<p>'Don't worry if I give it to you, your immune system will be stronger after then you can come back and thank me with a kiss! Stay clean and keep doing your thing!</p>

<p>Unimpressed: The TV tough guy, who took on the role in November, was said to have left his bosses furious after posting the since-deleted tweet </p>

<p>'P.S I haven't got Covid-19 but probably have had it like the majority of you but Ssshhh!'</p>

<p>It comes shortly after he was reportedly been forced to quit his role as the Royal Navy's Chief Cadet after just nine months, after his controversial 'scum' tweet about Black Lives Matter protesters.</p>

<p>The TV tough guy, who took on the role in November, was said to have left his bosses furious after posting the since-deleted tweet, amid protests over racial injustice after the death of George Floyd in the US.</p>

<p>Navy chiefs were also said to be furious about the star's online rant about Government advice to tackle the coronavirus pandemic in March. Middleton later apologised for his comments. </p>

<p>He was given the option to quit or be sacked by admiralty bosses exasperated with his controversial behaviour.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'He never thought he'd be given such a difficult choice. But he has decided to take matters into his own hands and step down. He's gutted.'</p>

<p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline: 'The Ministry of Defence is not prepared to comment as this is a private matter.'</p>

<p>Amid the nationwide protests, some of which were usurped by rioters, he took to Twitter in June, opining: 'The extreme left against the extreme right.</p>

<p>'When did two wrongs make a right. It was only a matter of time. BLM and EDL are not welcome on our streets, absolute scum. What a great example you are to your future generation. Bravo.'</p>

<p>Backlash: Following backlash over his tweet, he said, 'I did not mean to say that BLM are scum, or to imply that BLM and the EDL are equivalent'</p>

<p>He quickly took down the tweet, following backlash on social media, and later told The Mirror: 'On Saturday night, I made comments about the violence breaking out across our streets.</p>

<p>'While I remain dismayed at these actions, I am horrified to realise that my wording could be misconstrued. I did not mean to say that BLM are scum, or to imply that BLM and the EDL are equivalent.</p>

<p>'I was trying to make a comment about violent protesters of any kind who I despise. I accept that my tweet was inappropriate and offensive and would like to apologise unconditionally. I am anti-racist, anti-hate and anti-violence.</p>

<p>'I believe in the right to protest, but change must come about through peaceful and legal means.' </p>

<p>The news came after it was revealed that he</p>

<p> had been given the boot by Soccer Aid 2020 amid fears that his involvement would offend other players. </p>
