<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paddy McGuinness has returned to filming the new series of Top Gear.</p>

<p>The TV presenter, 47, took to Instagram on Sunday to share a behind-the-scenes look at the forthcoming season, as he was strapped to the top of a Porsche.</p>

<p>Holding a teddy bear in his hands, seemingly for comfort, Paddy looked bemused as he sat on top of the supercar while wearing a helmet.</p>

<p>Risky: Paddy McGuinness held a teddy bear as he was strapped to the top of a Porsche for a daring Top Gear segment as filming resumed on Sunday</p>

<p>Paddy braced himself for the strong winds that would hit him during the segment by wearing a long-sleeved black top and trousers tucked into heavy duty boots.</p>

<p>A camera was strapped to the roof of the car so that the crew could capture all of Paddy's reactions once the race was underway.</p>

<p>Joking about the situation, Paddy wrote in the caption: 'Top Gear Producers - Can we strap you to the top of a Porsche, that’s going to be driven very fast by a former F1 Champion? Me - Can I have a teddy?'</p>

<p>Daring: Paddy (pictured in the new season's trailer) is set to sit on top of the supercar as a former F1 Champion drives it very quickly around the track</p>

<p>The upcoming series only resumed filming in June after the coronavirus pandemic halted production of the hit BBC car show.  </p>

<p>On Saturday, Top Gear released a first look trailer with hosts Paddy, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris ahead of the new series.</p>

<p>In the 60-second adrenaline-pumping video, it features Paddy's dramatic car crash where he lost control of a £250k 1990 Lamborghini Diablo in June.</p>

<p>Chaos: The upcoming series only resumed filming in June after the coronavirus pandemic halted production, they released pictures from the set in September (pictured) </p>

<p>As well as Paddy's car crash, the trailer shows the comedian risking his life once again in a daring wall of death challenge.</p>

<p>Arriving at the dare-devil stunt, Paddy quips: 'They've gone, "How can we get the ratings? We'll kill them all!"' </p>

<p>It then shows the Take Me Out star zooming around a motordrome in an old insurance write-off, a Porsche Cayman, as he warns: 'This does not feel good!'  </p>

<p>Not ideal! In a 60-second adrenaline-pumping trailer Paddy's dramatic car crash where he lost control of a £250k 1990 Lamborghini Diablo in June was shown</p>

<p>While Freddie, 42, and Chris, 45, look on in horror as they shout: 'No, no, no!'</p>

<p>Yet this isn't the only dangerous stunt for Paddy and he is also shown zooming across head-first on a zip-wire in north Wales. </p>

<p>The start date for the new series still remains unknown but it is expected to return later this year. </p>
