<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An adopted son who tracked his birth mother down only to discover she had been murdered has shared his incredible story. </p>

<p>Perth teacher Matthieu Heimel, 41, was originally born in the Phillipines and his two sons inspired him to begin looking for his birth parents in 2018. </p>

<p>Mr Heimel connected with his biological father through a DNA search and began to contact family members in the Philippines via Facebook. </p>

<p>But the 41-year-old soon discovered his mother Nenita Evans had moved to Melbourne in 1985 and vanished, Yahoo News reported.   </p>

<p>Perth teacher Matthieu Heimel embarked on a search to find his birth parents in 2018 and discovered his mother Nenita Evans (pictured) was murdered after she moved to Melbourne</p>

<p>Ms Evans married a man named Greg Evans, who she had met in Manila, and got a job as a housekeeper at the Melbourne Club, a popular gentlemen's club. </p>

<p>She worked for a man named Vicenzo Leonardi, who continued to promote Ms Evans, and would drive her home.  </p>

<p>There were rumours Mr Leonardi and Ms Evans were having an affair, and she began attending night school to become a florist after he put her in charge of floral arrangements.  </p>

<p>Ms Evans returned to the Melbourne Club to show off her portfolio on January 8 in 1987 and was never seen again.   </p>

<p>Her husband Greg Evans was initially a prime suspect in Ms Evans' murder case but Victoria Police never solved the mystery.  </p>

<p>As Mr Heimel continued to search for answers he uncovered more disturbing facts that could link to his mother's disappearance.    </p>

<p>Another woman named Milagros Dark was found murdered in 1990 and she also used to work at the Melbourne Club and drive home with Mr Leonardi.   </p>

<p>Mr Heimel then found a third woman, Anna Maria Pontarollo, who was linked to the Melbourne Club boss and vanished in 1954.  </p>

<p>Mr Heimel (pictured) discovered his mother worked as a housekeeper at the Melbourne Club and two other employees from the gentleman's club had also vanished after Ms Evans </p>

<p>Ms Pontarollo had been living with Mr Leonardi and the pair had two children together before Mr Leonardi's wife migrated from Italy.</p>

<p>She disappeared soon after and Mr Leonardi told the children his wife was their biological mother.   </p>

<p>Mr Leonardi attended a Coroner's Court hearing into the disappearance of Ms Evans in 1995 but did not give evidence. He died in 2009.  </p>

<p>Mr Heimel said he was continuing to seek answers but sometimes struggled with the revelations.     </p>

<p>'I move on from one discovery to another, it's hard for me to show my emotions.</p>

<p>'When I started to look for my birth mother I was hoping that it wasn't too late,' he explained. </p>

<p>Mr Heimel said finding out what happened to his mother would provide closure for his own family. </p>

<p>'It is a story of resilience which will inspire people by showing that while difficult times do come, they can be overcome,' he said in a Facebook post. </p>
