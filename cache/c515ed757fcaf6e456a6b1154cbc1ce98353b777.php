<p>Luka Jovic reportedly wants to end his Real Madrid nightmare after just a year</p>

<p>The Serbian striker has been frozen out by Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane</p>

<p>He is now pushing for a return to Frankfurt, where he excelled in the 2018-19 season before earning his big-money move to Madrid, according to El Mundo Deportivo. </p>

<p>The striker started only four LaLiga games last season and netted just twice, a far cry from his prolific final year in the Bundesliga.</p>

<p>He netted a devastating 27 goals for Frankfurt that season, including 10 in their run to the semi-finals of the Europa League, where they were beaten by Chelsea. </p>

<p>Zidane stood by his decision to leave Jovic on the bench as his side searched in vain for a goal in the stalemate.</p>

<p>Zidane stood by his decision to leave Jovic on the bench in the draw at Real Sociedad</p>

<p>Jovic scored 27 times during a spectacular final season at Frankurt in 2018-19</p>

<p>'It was difficult because we could have brought on another striker but that would have changed our shape and I didn't want to do that, I wanted to improve our wing play by bringing on wide players and that's what we did,' Zidane said. </p>

<p>Asked if he had any particular problem with Jovic, he replied: 'No, we have many players in our squad and I have to pick them and I decided to do what I did,' he said.</p>

<p>'I don't have anything against any player, it was all about our formation and I didn't want to change it and Karim was playing well.'</p>
