<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A heavily pregnant Muslim woman viciously attacked by a stranger at a Sydney cafe feared being killed if others did not intervene, a court has heard.</p>

<p>Rana Elasmar, 32, was 38-weeks' pregnant when Stipe 'Steven' Lozina approached her, punched her several times and then stomped on her head at Bay Vista in Parramatta in November 2019.</p>

<p>She told the Parramatta District Court on Tuesday she deliberately turned her abdomen away from her attacker and prayed for God to protect her child.</p>

<p>Rana Elasmar, 32, was 38-weeks' pregnant when Stipe 'Steven' Lozina approached her, punched her several times and then stomped on her head</p>

<p>'If nobody intervened, I could have been killed,' she said, tearing up.</p>

<p>'I remember thinking - hit my head as long as you don't touch my baby.'</p>

<p>Ms Elasmar, who was wearing a hijab at the time, said the 44-year-old man first asked for money before assaulting her and yelling 'you Muslims wrecked my mum'.</p>

<p>'No woman should excuse a man of such behaviour - it is our right to decide what do with our bodies,' she said.</p>

<p>'Islamophobia needs to end. Violence against women needs to stop.'</p>

<p>Following the 'vicious and unprovoked' attack, the bruised woman could not chew her food and suffered lingering migraines and headaches.</p>

<p>Stipe 'Steven' Lozina </p>

<p>Lozina, who appeared before Judge Christopher Craigie without legal representation on Tuesday, said he attacked Ms Elasmar because she did not give him money.</p>

<p>He then engaged in a bizarre exchange with crown prosecutor Sara Gul, first asking if she was Filipino, calling her 'dumb' and refusing to answer several direct questions about whether he hated Muslims.</p>

<p>'I don't hate them,' Lozina eventually said.</p>

<p>'But I don't get on with them. I have no business with them.'</p>

<p>The offender also said he was a 'chronic paranoid schizophrenic' and that he felt remorseful for what happened.</p>

<p>'I belong in a hospital,' he told the court.</p>

<p>Ms Gul told the court Lozina had also been convicted of verbally abusing two Muslim women at a shopping centre six weeks prior to his assault of Ms Elasmar.</p>

<p>Judge Craigie said the attack was 'wicked and deplorable' and that the matter was 'one of the more difficult cases' he had faced in a long time.</p>

<p>'You have no lawyer, you are obviously unwell, and committed a very serious offence, which rightfully appals people,' he said.</p>

<p>Lozina, who pleaded guilty in June to assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Ms Elasmar, will next face court on October 1.</p>
