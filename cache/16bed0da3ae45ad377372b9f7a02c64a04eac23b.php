<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Queensland and Western Australia are sitting ducks waiting for COVID-19 outbreaks because they are a 'virgin' ground for the virus, experts have warned.</p>

<p>There are concerns over a cargo ship floating off the coast of WA, where 17 crew members have tested positive for coronavirus, with ten now in quarantine at Port Hedland.</p>

<p>WA went 171 days without any community transmission prior to the ship's outbreak, sparking fears in epidemiologists that eased restrictions and complacency could lead to a second wave.    </p>

<p>Melbourne University epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely claimed WA was a 'tinderbox' that could be in trouble if the coronavirus spread into the community. </p>

<p>Queensland and Western Australia are sitting ducks waiting for COVID-19 outbreaks because they are a 'virgin' ground for the virus, experts have warned</p>

<p>There are concerns over cargo ship Patricia Oldendorff (pictured) floating off the coast of WA, where 17 crew members have tested positive for coronavirus</p>

<p>Ten crew members are now in hotel quarantine in Port Hedland after being taken off the COVID-riddled ship  </p>

<p>'They have a virgin population, a completely susceptible population and they are at the maximum allowed in terms of opening up,' he said. 'If the virus gets in it will very easily take off,' he told news.com.au.</p>

<p>ABC health expert Dr Norman Swan warned 'the fuel is on the ground ready for the fire in WA, Queensland and other states'. </p>

<p>'They have been lulled into a false sense of security. Testing rates are low, and that's the problem,' he said. </p>

<p>Western Australia has the lowest levels of coronavirus testing in Australia, with an average of just 1,790 residents are getting tested per day. </p>

<p>Curtin University modelling expert Associate Professor Nick Golding warned WA could suffer a similar fate to New Zealand, who saw an unexpected surge in cases after 101 days of no community transmission. </p>

<p>'The rate at which people are coming into contact with other people — who they are seeing each day — is high enough that if there was disease transmission then it would spread very quickly,' he said. </p>

<p>AMA president Omar Khorshid said a virus outbreak in Port Hedland would have a 'catastrophic outcome' and prove to be a 'death sentence' for vulnerable Indigenous communities.</p>

<p>Epidemiologists say WA is a 'tinderbox' that could be in trouble if the coronavirus spread into the community </p>

<p>'If the virus gets out into the Port Hedland community, particularly into the Indigenous community in Port Hedland, we would expect a catastrophic outcome that would be worse than what we have seen in Melbourne with severe illness and death resulting in an outbreak,' Dr Khorshid told the West Australian. </p>

<p>But Western Australian Health Minister Roger Cook is confident the cargo ship's outbreak will soon be resolved and says there is no risk to the local community.</p>

<p>He will travel to Port Hedland on Wednesday and will attend a community forum for concerned residents. </p>

<p>The response is being handled by the West Australian Medical Assistance Team, which successfully managed COVID-19 outbreaks aboard the Artania cruise ship and the Al-Kuwait livestock vessel earlier this year.</p>

<p>'While there are some unknowns, the WAMAT team has done this before on a much larger scale with the Artania and with the Al-Kuwait,' Mr Cook said.</p>

<p>'We are prepared and we are ready based upon clear protocols and planning.'</p>

<p>The ship, carrying 20 Filipino nationals and the captain, is anchored eight nautical miles off WA's northwest coast.</p>

<p>It arrived from Manila on September 16.</p>

<p>Australian Defence Force personnel will arrive on Thursday to help police and security guards oversee the hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>Nine crew are needed to maintain the ship while it is anchored, and maritime laws require 13 people to be aboard when it departs for international waters.</p>

<p>ABC health expert Dr Norman Swan warned 'the fuel is on the ground ready for the fire in WA, Queensland and other states'</p>

<p>Western Australia has the lowest levels of coronavirus testing in Australia, with an average of just 1,790 residents are getting tested per day</p>

<p>'My preference is that we take the crew off. We can care for them better there, we can do the deep clean of the vessel and we can get it under sail,' Mr Cook said.</p>

<p>'The limitation we have is we've only identified about five crew that we can actually put back onto that ship.'</p>

<p>Once some of the hotel occupants have exceeded their incubation period and are no longer infectious, they could form part of a 'clean' replacement crew.</p>

<p>'We're anticipating that this scenario will resolve itself within a fortnight,' Mr Cook said.</p>

<p>No new cases were reported on Tuesday, leaving the state with 22 active cases, including five unrelated to the Patricia Oldendorff. </p>
