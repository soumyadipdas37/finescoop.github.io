<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester City's social media team made an embarrassing gaffe on the club's website when they claimed to have signed long-term target Kalidou Koulibaly instead of £64million new man Ruben Dias.</p>

<p>City have been consistently linked with a move for Napoli centre back Koulibaly this summer, but instead it was Dias who came through the door on Tuesday in a club-record deal.</p>

<p>Despite the arrival of the Portuguese defender from Benfica, it appears the club had a template set up for the Koulibaly signing instead, and forgot to change a section at the bottom of the article.</p>

<p>Ruben Dias signed for Manchester City on Tuesday evening in a club-record £64m deal</p>

<p>City's media team accidentally offered fans the chance to win a signed Kalidou Koulibaly shirt</p>

<p>Fans, therefore, were given a chance to win a signed Koulibaly shirt, despite him still plying his trade in Serie A for Napoli.</p>

<p>The mistake was quickly rectified, but not before it was screenshotted and shared across social media for the world to see.</p>

<p>Dias' arrival will significantly strengthen Pep Guardiola's defence after they conceded five goals against Leicester at the weekend.</p>

<p>Koulibaly (centre) has been a target throughout the summer and it seems a template was ready</p>

<p>Dias holds his No 3 shirt; he will significantly strengthen Pep Guardiola's Man City back-line</p>

<p>As part of the deal, Nicolas Otamendi has gone the other way for £13.7m, and Dias has signed a six-year contract at the Etihad.</p>

<p>Manchester City's mistake comes just weeks after Chelsea's media team had made a gaffe of their own, failing to spell their own new signing's name right on the website.</p>

<p>Kai Havertz's £89m arrival was huge news across the world, but the club's 'Kia Havertz' mistake picked up plenty of traction on social media. </p>

<p>Chelsea made a gaffe of their own recently, calling Kai Havertz 'Kia Havertz' on their website</p>

<p>Nicolas Otamendi has gone the other way to Benfica as part of the Dias to Man City deal</p>
