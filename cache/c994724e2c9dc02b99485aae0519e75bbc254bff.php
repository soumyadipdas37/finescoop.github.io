<p>Lady in red: Oliva Bowen enjoyed a solo moment in the spotlight on Saturday morning, when she took to Instagram to share snaps of herself posing in a red lacy teddy suit</p>

<p>The TV personality looked enviably toned as she displayed her array of tattoos while posing in the lingerie, which she complemented with a thick gold necklace.</p>

<p>With her flaxen locks falling beyond her shoulders in soft waves, Olivia highlighted her good looks with a bold and generous application of makeup.</p>

<p>Captioning the pair of images, she wrote: 'Empowering myself with every curve,' before declaring that the Boux Avenue one-piece made her feel 'amazing'.</p>

<p>Sizzling: The former Love Island star, 26, put on a sizzling display in her barely-there ensemble of choice, which featured a deeply plunging neckline and zigzag patterning</p>

<p>Delight: As well as further showing off the teddy on her Instagram Stories, the blonde beauty also uploaded an image of herself wearing a flattering two-piece</p>

<p>Olivia has been celebrating two years of marriage with husband Alex, 29, this week, with the pair dining at London's Scott's on Tuesday and STK the following evening. </p>

<p>The lovebirds also pulled out all the stops to celebrate their anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London during the week.</p>

<p>Their relationship has gone the distance after they first got together before reality TV cameras, and they're one of the rare Love Island couples to have stayed together. </p>

<p>The pair tied the knot in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance. </p>

<p>Wedded bliss: She's been enjoying quite the celebratory week, as she and her husband Alex Bowen mark two years since they exchanged nuptials </p>

<p>When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.</p>

<p>'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.</p>

<p>'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.</p>

<p>'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.' </p>

<p>Impressive: Their relationship has gone the distance after they first got together in 2016, and theirs is one of the few Love Island romances that have not fizzled out (pictured on the show)</p>
