<p>Happily ever after! The Bachelorette sisters Elly (left) and Becky Miles (right) have confirmed they've both found love on the show, which premieres next week</p>

<p>Elly's appearance on The Bachelorette with her older sister comes after she failed to find love with astrophysicist Matt Agnew on The Bachelor last year.</p>

<p>'Yes we have [both found love]. I'm so happy right now for myself and for Bec. Her guy is the best, I love him - for her,' Elly said.</p>

<p>Elly claimed that she hoped her sister would find someone on the show, as she has been though 'a lot of hardship in relationships and people being crap to her'. </p>

<p>In it together: Elly claimed that she hoped her sister would find someone on the show, as she has been though 'a lot of hardship in relationships and people being c**p to her'</p>

<p>Becky also told the publication that Elly allowed herself to be more vulnerable during this season, and was glad it paid off for her.  </p>

<p>As for fighting over the same guy in the pool of men available to them in the mansion, Elly gave one major reason why that was never going to be on the cards.</p>

<p>'There was no chance we'd fall for the same guy, because we both have very different taste when it comes to men. Anyone Becky is interested in, I automatically put them in the brother basket,' she said, while Bec agreed 'that would be weird'. </p>

<p>Remember her? Elly's (left) appearance on The Bachelorette with her older sister comes after she failed to find love with astrophysicist Matt Agnew (right) on The Bachelor last year</p>

<p>In trailers for their red carpet debut with the mansion full of hunks, some of the men were confused at the prospect of two Bachelorettes.</p>

<p>When Elly clarified 'two girls, looking for one guy... each', Brisbane-based Ab Sow let out a sigh of relief, and said: 'oh, phew, I was going to say!'  </p>

<p>The Bachelorette premieres Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10</p>
