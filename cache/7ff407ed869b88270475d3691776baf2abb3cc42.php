<p>Lending his voice: Rob Kardashian used his social media presence to raise awareness about the ongoing military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan on Tuesday</p>

<p>Artsakh, also known as Nagorno-Karabakh, is a disputed region between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  </p>

<p>Although it is recognized as part of Azerbaijan by the international community, it's ruled by an independent government and is primarily comprised of ethnic Armenians.</p>

<p>Dozens of Azerbaijani and Armenian service members have been killed in recent days as the two sides have begun fighting. </p>

<p>Rob continued in his caption: 'We appeal to the international community to continue to condemn these attacks. From the highest levels of leadership, we know Armenia &amp; Artsakh want peace.'</p>

<p>Kardashian told to his 1.9million followers that 'anything else [they] read is disingenuous &amp; false,' before urging them to 'call [their] representatives' by visiting the webiste anca.org/call.</p>

<p>Just like Khloe's original post, Rob encouraged his followers to follow his friend Eric Esrailian, a gastroenterologist who teaches at UCLA and a film producer, for updates on the conflict, which she described as 'unprovoked attacks — by Azerbaijan — against civilian #Armenians in #Artsakh.' </p>

<p>'You can also provide support for the We Are Our Borders/All For Artsakh #ArstakhStrong campaign to provide charitable support via: armeniafund.org/donate #Wearestillhere,' he concluded.</p>

<p>Along with his powerful words, Rob included a cinematic photo of the Flag of Artsakh blowing in the wind.   </p>
