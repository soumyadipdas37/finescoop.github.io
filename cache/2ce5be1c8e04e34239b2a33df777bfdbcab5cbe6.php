<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump joked with Sarah Sanders that she would need to 'take one for the team' after Kim Jong-un 'winked' at her during the Singapore summit, the former press secretary reveals in her new book.</p>

<p>Sanders said in detailing the famous 2018 bilateral meeting between Trump and Kim that she was under the impression that the North Korean leader had 'marked' her.</p>

<p>'We made direct eye contact and Kim nodded and appeared to wink at me. I was stunned. I quickly looked down and continued taking notes,' Sanders described in her new book 'Speaking for Myself,' which hits shelves next Tuesday, but The Guardian was able to obtain early.</p>

<p>Following the meeting, Sanders detailed that she relayed the incident to Trump and his then- Chief of Staff John Kelly as they were on their way to the airport.</p>

<p>'Kim Jong-un hit on you! He did! He f***ing hit on you!' Trump said in response, according to his former loyalist press secretary, who did not spell out the expletive in the book.</p>

<p>'Sir, please stop,' Sanders said she responded to the president's suggestion.</p>

<p>She said Trump and Kelly both 'howled with laughter' as 'The Beast' drove on. </p>

<p>Former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders will reveal in her new book that Donald Trump told her she would need to 'take one for the team' after he said 'Kim Jong-un f***ing hit on you!'</p>

<p>In the book, Sanders reveals that during the bilateral meeting, Kim 'winked' at her </p>

<p>Sanders, who left her White House post last summer on good terms, details that Trump told her she would have to 'go to North Korea and take one for the team.'</p>

<p>Trump has said he has good rapport with Kim as the two have met three times – including in July 2019 when the two world leaders met at the Demilitarized Zone and Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to step foot into North Korea.</p>

<p>Despite the supposed good relationship between the two and their meetings in Hanoi, Singapore, and the DMZ, the president has not convinced Kim to give up his nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Sanders said that would take a 'miracle.'</p>

<p>In describing the 2018 Singapore meeting further, Sanders said he 'reluctantly' accepted a Tic Tac from the president after he 'dramatically blew into the air to reassure Kim it was just a breath mint' and not poison.</p>

<p>She also said they discussed other hot topics like sports, including women's soccer.</p>

<p>Sanders' book will be different from other former-Trump officials who have released tell-alls burning the president and revealing what they felt was off with his administration, including Trump's former National Security Advisor John Bolton's memoir 'The Room Where it Happened.'</p>

<p>In one part of her book, Sanders takes aim at Bolton after he turned on Trump.</p>

<p>'Speaking for Myself: Faith Freedom and the Fight of Our Lives Inside the Trump White House' will shower praise on the president and Sanders' time serving under the president.</p>

<p>Some excerpts, however, describe instances when Trump and some of his senior aides acted course or misogynistic.</p>

<p>In tearful public good-byes in June 2019, Sanders said she was departing the White House to spend more time with her husband and three kids – this sparked rumors she was seeking a political position, mainly governor, in Arkansas.</p>

<p>Sanders' father is former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who was also a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016. </p>

<p>Sanders was succeeded by now first lady Melnaia Trump's Press Secretary and Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham, who did not hold one press briefing during her nine month tenure in the West Wing.</p>

<p>In April 2020, Kayleigh McEnany, who previously worked for Trump's campaign, took her post as press secretary. Since then she has given frequent press briefings.</p>
