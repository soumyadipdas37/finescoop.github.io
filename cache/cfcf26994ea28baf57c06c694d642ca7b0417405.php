<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fox News host Tucker Carlson has blamed Democrats and the Black Lives Matter movement for the shooting ambush on two Los Angeles sheriff's deputies over the weekend, claiming that anti-police rhetoric prompted the attack. </p>

<p>'He tried to kill them because they were cops,' Carlson said in his opening monologue on Monday night. </p>

<p>'Can we really be surprised that he tried to do that? Since the beginning of summer, the Democratic Party has told us that the police are evil. That they're killers. Agents of racist genocide. Cops are the problem,' he continued. </p>

<p>Police are still desperately seeking the identity of the shooter in Saturday's attack, which appeared to be an unprovoked ambush on the two deputies who were sitting in a police vehicle parked near a transit station.</p>

<p>Fox News host Tucker Carlson has blamed Democrats and the Black Lives Matter movement for the shooting ambush on two Los Angeles sheriff's deputies</p>

<p>Video released by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department shows the moment the male suspect opened fire on two deputies at a Compton bus station before fleeing on foot</p>

<p>Both deputies were struck in the head by gunshots, but miraculously both are in stable condition and expected to survive. One is a 24-year-old male and the other is a 31-year-old former librarian and mother of a six-year-old child.</p>

<p>Carlson pointed out reaction videos shot by bystanders at the scene of the shooting, which show the bystanders laughing and mocking the two deputies who had been shot.</p>

<p>He also noted videos showing protesters blocking the entrance to the emergency room where the two cops were rushed for treatment, with protesters celebrating the shooting and expressing hope that the deputies would die.</p>

<p>'This is the country they're creating,' Carlson said, referring to Democrats and left-wing activists. 'A young woman shot in the face gasping for air as she tries to stay alive for her child. What kind of person could laugh at that?' </p>

<p>'Black Lives Matter has told this man that police officers deserve to die because they're sub-human,' he added. 'So why wouldn't he celebrate?'</p>

<p>A radio reporter who was near the protest scene was taken into custody, KABC-TV reported. The sheriff's department later tweeted that the reporter interfered with the arrest of a male protester</p>

<p>He claimed Democratic leaders nationwide condoned this act of violence and others, as protesters continue treat criminals and suspects who die in police custody as 'martyrs.' </p>

<p>'It's all such an absurd lie,' he said. 'And everyone who's paying attention knows it's a lie. But they demand that we all play along. And they punish us if we don't.'</p>

<p>Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, did speak out swiftly to condemn the shooting, saying it a tweet that it was 'unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.'</p>

<p>'Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished,' Biden wrote. </p>

<p>Investigators reportedly believe the ambush was retaliation for recent police shootings of black suspects in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>On August 31 black man Dijon Kizzee was shot and killed by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies after he was stopped for a traffic violation while riding a bike. </p>

<p>And at the beginning of this month, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors also voted to ask the coroner to conduct an inquest into the fatal deputy shooting of 18-year-old Andres Guardado on June 18. </p>

<p> FOX11 obtained a photo (above) of the female deputy, who has not been named but was described as a 31-year-old mother of a six-year-old boy, covered in blood after she was shot in the jaw helping her colleague </p>

<p>Officials have asked for the public's help in identifying the gunman with a $175,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Investigators are still working to determine the motive for the shooting, which they said occurred 'without warning or provocation'. </p>

<p>The suspect is described as a black male between 28 and 30 years old. He was wearing dark clothing at the time of the shooting and was last seen in a black four-door sedan. </p>

<p>Authorities said that the deputies, who both graduated from the police academy 14 months ago, each sustained multiple gunshot wounds. </p>

<p>'That was a cowardly act,' Sheriff Villanueva said at a press conference. 'The two deputies were doing their job, minding their own business, watching out for the safety of the people on the train.  </p>

<p>'Seeing somebody just walk up and start shooting on them. It p***es me off. It dismays me at the same time. There's no pretty way to say it.'   </p>
