<p>Lottie Dalziel, from Sydney, Australia shared a clip to TikTok where she put a carrot in a glass of water for five minutes</p>

<p>'Pop them in some water for five minutes – yes, this does work – pull them out and they will be as good as gold!' she explains. </p>

<p>She then showed the carrot with was bendy and flopping over. </p>

<p>After soaking in a jar of water for five minutes, the carrot was edible again.</p>

<p>While many were shocked with the result, some questions how accurate it was. </p>

<p>In the video, which has racked up more than a million views, Lottie says that carrots are often dehydrated and simple need water to bring back their snap.</p>

<p>Some TikTok users explained it worked due to osmosis, meaning the water from the jar is absorbed into saltier parts of the carrot.</p>

<p>'This is genius,' said one.</p>

<p>'Wow you changed my life!' commented another. </p>

<p>However, others were more dubious saying it doesn't work at the food should be thrown out.</p>

<p>While one commented: 'Does work but after a few hours.'</p>
