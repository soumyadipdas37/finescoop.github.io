<p>A high school student has revealed how he made $60,000 in just one month flipping desks, ovens and toys on eBay during coronavirus lockdowns.</p>

<p>Marcus Pereira started selling household items online from a computer at his parents' Melbourne home in August 2019, at the age of 15.</p>

<p>The now-16-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that he used to make about $20,000 'in a good month' before COVID-19. </p>

<p>By the time the city was locked down to curb the spread of coronavirus in April 2020, the Year 11 student was making three times that amount each month.</p>

<p>'People were buying stuff because they were indoors,' he said.</p>

<p>'They wanted desks because they were working at home, fitness equipment became really popular, and sales for games increased because kids were also stuck inside.' </p>

<p>Mr Pereira sells products using the dropshipping method - a cost-free business model that allows people to sell items on behalf of suppliers, for a profit.</p>

<p>Mr Pereira (pictured left with his cousin Leon) realised the demand for household items started to skyrocket during the height of the pandemic and tweaked his business model</p>

<p>The sales model allows him to advertise and sell furniture and large appliances from department stores, such as Kmart, on his eBay account, at an inflated cost.</p>

<p>'If I have a table from Kmart that's worth $50, I'll put it on my eBay store for $80. </p>

<p>'When it sells, I put the order in on behalf of the customer through Kmart. They take care of the shipping, and I keep the extra $30.' </p>

<p>He kept piles of ovens and small appliances in his parents' home (pictured: an oven he sold on eBay)</p>

<p>'I decided to buy up things like ovens, desks and some toys, hold on to them, and sell them at an inflated price.'</p>

<p>He kept piles of ovens and small appliances in his parents' home, which he also shares with his three siblings, and personally shipped them out to customers for an extra fee.</p>

<p>'That's when sales increased to about $50,000 to $60,000 per month.' </p>

<p>Mr Pereira currently has 308 items in his eBay store with products valued between $29.99, for a bathroom shelf rack, and $1,500 for a VR headset.</p>

<p>He has sold 32 headsets so far. </p>

<p>The teenager is now back to dropshipping full time and says he is able to sell items at an inflated price because eBay customers are devoted to the platform.</p>

<p>Take action: 'If you have an idea, take action immediately.'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't made a decision in the moment to execute on my idea. </p>

<p>'If you have an idea, follow through with it.'</p>

<p>Look at free resources: 'There are so many resources to learn anything for free online. </p>

<p>'You can learn about what I'm doing for free on YouTube.'</p>

<p>'EBay has a fantastically loyal fan base, and it's backed by the eBay guarantee.'</p>

<p>The online shopping platform guarantees buyers their money back if the item doesn't arrive, or is different to how it was described in the listing.</p>

<p>'A lot of people are sceptical about buying online and they don't trust websites, but eBay does about two billion transactions per day - I was able to capitalise on that.' </p>

<p>He will have amassed a small fortune of about $100,000 by the end of the year, but says he started saving at the age of 12.</p>

<p>'The first time I ever made money online was though a Youtube channel where I would upload videos of myself playing games.'</p>

<p>He had about 7,000 subscribers and would earn up to $300 per month.  </p>

<p>Mr Pereira has one more year left of school and hopes to continue to move his business off eBay in the future. </p>

<p>He is saving all his profits to invest once he turns 18. </p>
