<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Demand for new cars fell by 5.8 per cent in August as the market slipped back into decline, industry data shows.</p>

<p>The return to the red was described as 'disappointing' following July's 11 per cent surge in registrations as dealerships reopened and began to supply the pent-up demand from lockdown.</p>

<p>Registrations in the first eight months of 2020 are now back by a concerning 40 per cent with the trade body pinning its hopes on a bumper sales performance in September.</p>

<p>'Disappointing': Trade body says a 5.8% decline in registrations in August was disheartening after an 11.3% jump in sales a month earlier </p>

<p>Some 87,226 new cars were registered in the UK last month compared with 92,573 during August a year ago, according to fresh figures published by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders today.</p>

<p>Chief executive Mike Hawes said: 'The decline is disappointing, following some brief optimism in July.</p>

<p>'However, given August is typically one the new car market's quietest months, it's important not to draw too many conclusions from these figures alone.'</p>

<p>With the decline in registrations last month, the sector is even more reliant on a surge in sales in September as buyers look to get their hands on cars with the latest '70' plate and take advantage of showrooms deals that come with it. </p>

<p>'With the all-important plate change month just around the corner, September is likely to provide a better barometer,' Hawes said. </p>

<p>'As the nation takes steps to return to normality, protecting consumer confidence will be critical to driving a recovery.'  </p>

<p>The automotive industry has been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with year-on-year demand down 97 per cent in April, 89 per cent in May and over a third in June.</p>

<p>July saw an 11.3 per cent increase, which was attributed to pent-up demand and special offers. </p>

<p>Some 87,226 new cars were registered in the UK last month compared with 92,573 during August a year ago</p>

<p>With registrations slipping back in August, the sector is now even more reliant on September being a strong month for new car demand</p>

<p>September is one of the two most important months of the year for the industry as buyers look to get their hands on cars with the latest plate change in the month (number 70 for this year) and take advantage of showrooms deals that come with it</p>

<p>Despite registrations falling way behind, throughout the pandemic the appetite for zero emission-capable vehicles has not wavered. </p>

<p>Sales of plug-in hybrids increasing by 221 per cent in August, although they still only accounted for 1 in 30 sales. </p>

<p>Registrations of battery electric cars increased by 78 per cent in the month, which means that 1 in 16 new models bought last month were solely battery powered. </p>

<p>Korean maker Kia recorded a record-high volume of deliveries for August, with 4,179 new cars registered, of which 533 (13 per cent) were electric e-Niros.</p>

<p>Electric cars in 2020 now make up almost 5 per cent of all registrations, up from 1.1 per cent in the same period last year.</p>

<p>While demand for zero-emissions cars is obviously higher, the SMMT said the small market share 'clearly illustrating the scale of the challenge ahead to reach the government target for EVs to comprise 70 per cent of new car sales by 2030'.</p>

<p>Demand for pure electric (BEV) models was up 78% in August. Almost 45,000 battery-powered cars have now been bought in the UK this year</p>

<p>Sales of electrified cars, such as the Mini E and Nissan Leaf (front), are increasing at record pace</p>

<p>The trade body has reported this morning that almost half of UK drivers will not be ready to buy a pure electric vehicle by 2035 - the new date many expect the Government to ban the sale of all internal combustion engine cars, including petrols, diesels and hybrids. </p>

<p>The SMMT has called for binding targets on charging infrastructure development and long-term commitments to incentivise the purchase of zero emission capable vehicles to accelerate demand. </p>

<p>'In the past five years, the range of zero emission capable car models available in the UK has trebled to more than 80, with some 200 more in the pipeline over the coming years,' the industry representative said.</p>

<p>'For customer demand to keep pace, at least 1.7 million new on-street charging points will need to be built by 2030, along with a long-term commitment from government to provide incentives for EV purchases.'</p>

<p>Ford's Fiesta was the best-selling car in August, cementing its position as the UK's favourite motor this year - as it has been for over a decade.</p>

<p>Some 3,372 versions were registered last month, ahead of the VW Golf.</p>

<p>August was a strong month for Ford in general, with the Focus, Puma and Kuga all among the top 10 most-registered motors. </p>

<p>Ford's Fiesta was the best-selling car of August and has cemented its spot as the most popular model in the UK this year</p>

<p>Commenting on the August registrations figures, Michael Woodward, UK automotive lead at Deloitte, said the small decline in sales last month means the sector is 'almost back to pre-pandemic levels' but warned that September might not be the bumper month industry insiders are hoping for.</p>

<p>'According to our latest research, nearly half of consumers are planning to keep their current vehicle for longer than planned meaning that once pent up demand is met, sales may subsequently drop off,' he said.</p>

<p>'Demand over the course of the year will also likely be affected by consumers' financial situations. Should unemployment rates continue to rise, new car sales could stall. However, with many consumers looking for a public transport alternative, demand for cheaper models could fuel the used car market.</p>

<p>'The auto industry typically works on a five to six month production planning cycle meaning that if September doesn't herald an uptick in sales, more challenging decisions may need to be made for Spring 2021. </p>

<p>'Some manufacturers might predict sales returning to normal over the next six months, but the consensus view is likely to be less optimistic, potentially impacting planned production.</p>

<p>'Should factories continue to operate below capacity, the pandemic financial support from manufacturers that has been offered to dealerships to date will likely be reduced, or in some cases withdrawn. This could lead to further discounting to ensure new car stock is moved quickly from forecourt to consumer.' </p>
