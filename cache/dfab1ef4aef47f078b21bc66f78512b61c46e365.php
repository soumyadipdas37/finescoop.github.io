<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Ham co-owner David Gold has pocketed nearly £760,000 after selling the oldest-surviving FA Cup at auction on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mystery surrounds the buyer, who chose to remain anonymous, amid fears the cup could now disappear abroad.</p>

<p>The trophy, presented to the winners of the competition between 1896 and 1910, was sold at Bonhams in London on Tuesday. It reportedly cost just £25 to make but was expected to fetch up to £900,000. After 'a lot of interest and some spirited bidding,' it eventually sold for £759,062.</p>

<p>David Gold sold the oldest-surviving FA Cup at auction in London on Tuesday for £759,062</p>

<p>That means Gold has made close to £300,000 profit on the cup which he bought at auction in 2005 for £478,000 while chairman of Birmingham City.</p>

<p>At the time he claimed he was doing the nation a favour. Whether the 84-year-old will pump the profits into West Ham remain unclear.</p>

<p>The trophy is an extraordinary piece of football history. It was the first FA Cup won by Bury, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday and Newcastle United — and the first of the 12 FA Cups clinched by Manchester United. It was made as a replacement for the first FA Cup, which was stolen from a shop window in 1895 while held by Aston Villa and is thought to have been melted down.</p>

<p>The cup has been privately owned for more than a century but until recently it was on display at the National Football Museum in Manchester.</p>

<p>The prestigious trophy was handed to FA Cup winners between the years of 1896 and 1910</p>
