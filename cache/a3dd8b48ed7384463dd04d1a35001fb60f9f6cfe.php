<p>The aunt of a grieving, young woman who was forced to miss her father's funeral said Queensland's strict coronavirus rules had caused the family a lot of distress. Pictured is Sarah Caisip alighting from a ute wearing personal protective equipment to view her father's body</p>

<p>Ms Caisip's aunt, identified on Brisbane radio 4BC only as Jane, said her niece was traumatised at only being allowed to see father in a casket, as police and Army officers surrounded her, instead of grieving with her loved ones.</p>

<p>'That was pretty upsetting. It was quite distressing to see that,' she said.</p>

<p>Aunty Jane said Ms Caisip's mother and younger sister were too upset to complain.</p>

<p>'She was really too upset to say very much at all and her Isobel was extremely distressed,' she said.</p>

<p>Making matters more distressing, Ms Caisip was barred from talking to her young sister as she arrived at the Mount Gravatt cemetery - 20 minutes after the funeral had finished.</p>

<p>'It was very upsetting for everybody,' Aunty Jane said. 'Sarah would not even have been able to do that.</p>

<p>'It was under such distressing circumstances.' </p>

<p>Queensland's Labor government refused to allow Ms Caispin see her father as he was dying of cancer.</p>

<p>Mr Prendergast died on September 2, 2020, before his daughter could farewell him.</p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Friday claimed she felt the pain of cases like Ms Caisip's - a day after telling Parliament her case was determined by the state's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young.</p>

<p>'I feel these issues personally just like everybody else does,' Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>

<p>'I am human just like everyone else. These people are human beings as well. 'Who wouldn't be touched by these cases. They are heartbreaking.' </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk has told Queensland's Legislative Assembly that Prime Minister Scott Morrison's call to her, pleading for Ms Caisip to be allowed to attend her father's funeral, amounted to bullying. </p>
