<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Annastacia Palaszczuk has been accused of breaching her own tough COVID-19 rules by attending a funeral and waiting two days to get tested after having a creaky voice.</p>

<p>The Liberal National Party questioned the embattled Queensland premier after she admitted having a hoarse voice during an online debate on Monday night.</p>

<p>'Sorry,' she said before clearing her throat, 'I've lost my voice from last week at Parliament I think.'</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the premier attended former Mackay MP Tim Mulherin's funeral.</p>

<p>Annastacia Palaszczuk has been accused of breaching her own tough COVID-19 rules by attending a funeral and waiting two days to get tested after having a croaky voice</p>

<p>The following day she got tested for coronavirus, before returning a negative result on Thursday.</p>

<p>Spokespeople for the premier said she did not have any symptoms and was sufering from voice strain. </p>

<p>Treasurer Cameron Dick told reporters the premier's results had come back negative.</p>

<p>'The premier lost her voice ... she had a COVID test that came back negative, so she's done the right thing, she's listened to the health advice, she's obeyed the science and the science that informs the health advice and that's the appropriate thing for Queenslanders to do,' Mr Dick said.</p>

<p>LNP health spokeswoman Ros Bates accused the premier of being reckless and not taking her own health advice.</p>

<p>'I'm glad to hear the Premier tested negative to COVID, but it raises many questions,' Ms Bates said.</p>

<p>'The official advice is that if people are feeling unwell they should get tested.</p>

<p>'It appears the Premier has done neither and contradicted her own advice after being tested on Wednesday night – two days after having symptoms.'</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk has come under fire for attending the funeral after Sarah Caisip, from virus-free Canberra, was escorted by police to a Brisbane cemetery after her father's funeral had ended.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Ms Palaszczuk got tested for coronavirus, before returning a negative result on Thursday</p>

<p>The 26-year-old nurse wasn't allowed to attend her father's service because she was in hotel quarantine at the time.</p>

<p>Amid a media furore and growing exasperation with the state shutting its doors to the rest of the country, Ms Palaszczuk welled up as she said: 'I'm human like everyone else.</p>

<p>The LNP and federal politicians have branded Ms Palaszczuk 'heartless', while the state government has accused the opposition of using family tragedies for political gain.</p>

<p>Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles accused the prime minister's office of masterminding a campaign to boost the LNP's chances at the state election.</p>

<p>'Why is Scott Morrison is so fixated on Queensland, so determined tear down our premier?'     </p>
