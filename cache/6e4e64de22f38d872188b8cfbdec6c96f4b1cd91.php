<p>Randall then said, 'Lala Kent, a soon-to-be mother!' </p>

<p>She also said she has been crying a lot lately. 'I cry about everything. I look at the refrigerator and it could be empty or full and I’m, like, is [it] happy or sad, I don’t know... Today it’s very much happy tears,' she added.  </p>

<p>A new feeling: The blonde beauty shared the news on Wednesday - her 30th birthday - on her podcast Give Them Lala…With Randall. 'I am so excited. I feel very maternal and motherly,' she said, 'I’m like shaking right now, because I can’t believe it’s a real-life thing. I’m really emotional'</p>

<p>He already shares daughters daughters London, 10, and six-year-old Rylee with ex-wife, and You actress, Ambyr Childers. </p>

<p>Vanderpump Rules costar Stassi Schroeder is also expecting her first child. Her fiancé is Beau Clark.  </p>

<p>They were due to be married this past April, but were forced to delay their wedding until 2021 amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>In late August Kent and Emmett said they are trying to have a baby. </p>

<p>The Irishman producer revealed they are 'working' on conceiving a baby, when speaking to Us Weekly on Monday. </p>

<p>The goods news: Kent came out with the news on the podcast in a casual way: 'Today is my 30 birthday and I can’t think of any other way to celebrate than with you guys coming through your headphones and speakers. I had the best gift given to me, my body also helped out too … I am pregnant!' (Kent and Emmett in 2019)</p>

<p>'We are working at that currently,' Emmett said of their baby plans. </p>

<p>The couple is using an app to track the Vanderpump Rules star's fertility.   </p>

<p>'We are on the Flo app,' Emmett said. 'We are on the apps. Lala, whatever day it is, she comes in, she says, "Give me a baby!" and then I hop right to it.'  </p>

<p>Blended family: He shares daughters daughters London, 10, and six-year-old Rylee with ex-wife, and You actress, Ambyr Childers (Kent with London and Rylee in July)</p>

<p>He called the 'boss' when it comes to their relationship, and playfully said he struggles to remember her ovulation schedule. </p>

<p>'We have our normal course of being together,' he said. 'And then the moment comes, and she’s just like, "It’s Friday at 3 o’clock. You are not going anywhere."' </p>

<p>Emmett said 'It is only a matter of time,'  and they 'are working on it.' </p>

<p>The attempt to expand their family comes after he and Kent delayed their wedding multiple time first from April to fall and then ultimately to July 2021, as the pandemic made large gatherings difficult to execute safely.  </p>

<p>'It was this weird thing because it was April, obviously, and then we pushed it to September or October,' he said of their wedding plans. 'And we thought that life would be somewhat back to normal [by then].' </p>

<p>Adding: 'That obviously wasn’t true. So she called me up one day, and she was like, "Babe, we have to move this wedding."'</p>

<p>Though he initially was willing to have a very intimate ceremony but they decided to postpone in hopes of having all of their plans remain the same. </p>

<p>Saying: 'And I was like, "No, we’re not moving. We’ll have it with five people," and she’s like, "No, you don’t want that version of this wedding. So we need to do the right thing."'</p>

<p>Tears of joy: She also said she has been crying a lot lately. 'I cry about everything. I look at the refrigerator and it could be empty or full and I’m, like, is [it] happy or sad, I don’t know... Today it’s very much happy tears,' she added </p>
