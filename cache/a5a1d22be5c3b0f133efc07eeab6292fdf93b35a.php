<p>Heartwarming: A photo of Professor Charles Krohn, 91, from Houston, Texas, virtually teaching his English class at the University of St. Thomas has gone viral </p>

<p>Proud: Charles' daughter Julia Krohn shared the snapshot on Facebook, saying her dad is 'embracing virtual teaching like a BOSS'</p>

<p>'Listening to and watching him teach Homer’s The Odyssey is a true gift,' she added. 'He’s been teaching it for decades, and yet he has the passion and excitement for the text as though it’s the first time. These kids have no idea how lucky they are.'</p>

<p>The University of St. Thomas has transitioned to online-only classes this fall and physically closed its campus on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The photo that Julia posted shows her father sitting in front of a desktop computer while teaching his students via Zoom. He has his book and notes laid out in front of him, and he looks sharp in his blue button-down shirt and glasses.  </p>

<p>Proud: 'He’s been teaching it for decades, and yet he has the passion and excitement for the text as though it’s the first time,' Julia gushed </p>

<p>Family: Charles has been married to his wife Chesley for 54 years, and they have four children and six grandchildren</p>

<p>Julia's post has been shared 28,000 times and received more than 63,000 likes since September 1, turning Charles into an online star. </p>

<p>'God bless him! His students are definitely some of the luckiest!!' one person commented, while another added: 'They are lucky indeed! Thank you for sharing this photo! It put a smile in my heart!'  </p>

<p>The post also attracted the attention of some of Charles' former students dating back to the 1960s. </p>

<p>'Julia, please give your dad my kindest regards. I was a student of "Mr. Krohn’s" at Jefferson Davis High School c/o 1960,' wrote one woman, who shared a photo of her former teacher.   </p>

<p>Going viral: The post attracted the attention of some of Charles' past students dating back to the 1960s. Linda Brock Maddux shared a photo of her former teacher back in the day </p>

<p>Throwback: Linda said Charles was her teacher at Jefferson Davis High School in 1960 </p>

<p>'He was an amazing teacher then as well and left a lasting impression on our lives. He even made diagramming sentences fun! Blessings to you and your family.' </p>

<p>'Professor Krohn was my UST English professor in Fall ‘92 and Spring ‘93. And right now he is my daughter’s UST English professor. Awesome,' another added. </p>

<p>Julia told Good Morning America that she hadn't seen her father teach in 20 years up until that day. </p>

<p>She had invited him over to use her computer because his was acting up, and she was immediately struck by his incredible presence.  </p>

<p>So sweet: Many people praised Charles in the comments, and he teared up while reading their kind words </p>

<p>'He's an actor as well so that has gone hand and hand in his teaching,' said. 'He's just so lively and it's like watching a performance.' </p>

<p>Charles has been married to his wife Chesley for 54 years, and they have four children and six grandchildren. </p>

<p>Julia said her mother made her father read every single Facebook comment on her post, and all the kind words — particularly those from his former students — made him tear up. </p>

<p>'[There were] all these memories of him in the classroom and how they may not remember much about St. Thomas, but they remember so much about Professor Krohn ... that he's the most kind-hearted, most compassionate person you'll ever meet,' she explained.   </p>
