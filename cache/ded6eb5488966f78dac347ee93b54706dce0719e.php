<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>With the days slowly getting shorter and chillier, it can be hard to coax ourselves out of the house for a run. </p>

<p>That being said, autumn is a great time to go for a jog, with the changing seasons adding extra colour to your usual running routes. If you're planning to pound the streets this autumn, it pays to be prepared and add an extra layer to your outfit.</p>

<p>Amazon shoppers have been impressed by the AURIQUE Women's Seamless Long Sleeve Sports Top, calling it a 'fab running top' and the 'perfect weight for cold mornings'.</p>

<p>The AURIQUE Women's Seamless Long Sleeve Sports Top is designed to support and sculpt </p>

<p>With over 800 ratings and an impressive average score of 4.6 out of 5, the AURIQUE Seamless Long Sleeve Sports Top is a big hit with runners and gym bunnies alike. In fact, it's currently the number one bestselling item in Amazon's 'Women's Sports Shirts and Tees' department. </p>

<p>Shoppers have been quick to praise the sport top, describing it as 'soft and cosy' and 'super comfy and wicks away sweat quickly'.</p>

<p>One delighted shopper wrote: 'A really lovely running top. Perfect for those cooler months when you need something to keep the chill off but not anything that'll make you too hot once you get running.'</p>

<p>The seamless long sleeved top is designed to keep you moving confidently and comfortably. The lightweight top can be worn as a base layer under a jacket on particularly chilly days, but is technically sound enough to keep you warm when worn alone.  </p>

<p>'Fab running top,' another reviewer noted. 'I'm a runner and wear it under my tee shirt during winter. Excellent quality, as good as the top brands. I'm a 32d and size 10, glad I ordered medium, fit is perfect as I don't like my running tops tight.'</p>

<p>The top is equipped with thumb holes that can come down over the hands like mittens, which is ideal for keeping your hands warm. </p>

<p>The top is designed with thumb-holes to cover your hands whilst you run, which is great for autumn and winter jogs</p>

<p>Thanks to the high-quality design and reasonable high-price tag, shoppers are snapping up the AURIQUE top in more than one colour. </p>

<p>'So pleased with this top,' wrote one shopper. 'I bought it in the blue and love it so much I've promptly sent for the pink one! It's great quality, not too thick but not cheap and flimsy either. </p>

<p>'It's a really flattering fit and has a nice neat neckline which I find more flattering than a big wide neck. I bought it for walking, running but I put it on this morning and it was so comfy I've worn it all day just with navy chinos.'</p>

<p>Another reviewer wrote: 'This is a great jersey for morning runs when it's a bit cooler. Lovely fit and the fabric feels nice against the skin with no rubbing or chafing. </p>

<p>'Good wicking qualities too. Used it a couple of times now and the quality seems really good as well. Really happy. Every bit as good as something much more expensive!' </p>
