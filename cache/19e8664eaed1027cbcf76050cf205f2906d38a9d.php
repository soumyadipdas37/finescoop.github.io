<p>All smiles: Jamie Doran (pictured) looked smug as he enjoyed a swim in Queensland on Monday as the future of Channel Ten's Bachelor In Paradise hangs in the balance</p>

<p>Jamie's holiday comes after it was revealed the future of Ten's Bachelor In Paradise is hanging in the balance.</p>

<p>Frantic producers are said to be scrambling to find a way to film the fourth season of the dating show amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The show usually films every November at Fiji's Mango Bay Resort - however with most interstate borders still firmly closed and international travel mostly out of the question, it seems unlikely that contestants will be able to fly out for the series.</p>

<p>However, The Wash reported there may still be a glimmer of hope, as the producers have already 'approached big names' from the franchise to star in the series, and are looking at Noosa in QLD as a potential back-up location. </p>

<p>Some of the franchise's 'key alumni' have reportedly been promised that if the season goes ahead, then they will definitely be on the show. </p>

<p>Happy and relaxed: The fireman, 40, appeared happier than ever as he soaked up the sun and relaxed in the pool</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jamie was portrayed as 'stage-five clinger' on the last season of Bachelor in Paradise, and received a similar edit on The Bachelorette last year. </p>

<p>On July 29, Jamie announced he would be taking legal action against Channel 10 and Warner Bros. over his portrayal on dating shows. </p>

<p>The firefighter-turned-FIFO worker shared a statement to Instagram, explaining why he had decided to call in his lawyers.</p>

<p>Fun outing: The reality star wore black sunglasses and held a drink in one hand while he spent time with his friend</p>

<p>He wrote: 'This is not the news I wanted to post, but I feel I owe this to at least my family, friends, and also fans of The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise.</p>

<p>'After lengthy consideration, I've decided to begin legal proceedings against Network 10 and Warner Bros. Australia. </p>

<p>'I'm not going to comment on this any further for the time being and would appreciate it if people would respect my privacy.'</p>

<p>In response to Jamie's legal threat, a network spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia on July 29: 'Channel 10 has not received any papers regarding this claim.' </p>

<p>Is this the end? Jamie's holidays comes after it was revealed the future of Channel Ten's Bachelor In Paradise is hanging in the balance </p>
