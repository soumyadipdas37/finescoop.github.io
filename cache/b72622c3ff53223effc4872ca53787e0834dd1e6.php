<p>Exciting: Rebekah has been confirmed as the latest star set to appear in Dancing on Ice in 2021, amid her looming court battle with Coleen </p>

<p>Speaking on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain, Rebekah said: 'Look, we tried to sort things out amicably, it just didn't work. I understand people think it's ridiculous, but what was I meant to do? I need to clear my name. </p>

<p>'I want to clear my name. I will do whatever that takes. I hope it's going to be resolved soon. It's just one of the things that has to go through the process unfortunately now.</p>

<p>'I found it really tough. But to be fair Piers, in comparison to what some people have gone through with COVID and things like that, it's incomparable.'</p>

<p>Taking to the rink: The WAG gushed that she was 'so ready' for the glam squad as she prepares to take to the rink next year, but her husband Jamie is hoping she doesn't 'fall over'</p>

<p>She added of her DOI stint: 'I'm so ready for the sequins and the full glam squad. After months of lockdown it'll be nice to get the glam on... I just think I want everyone to laugh at me really! </p>

<p>'My dad taught me how to stand up on a pair of skates when I was about 7 years old, we used to go skating a lot when my mum and dad split up, we would go with him to the local ice rink. </p>

<p>'I'm really excited actually. The only time I've been ice skating since is when we take our kids to the rink.' </p>

<p>Rink ready: Rebekah added that she decided to sign up for the show as she wanted 'everyone to laugh at her,' and revealed she is due to start training 'in a couple of weeks'</p>

<p>She said: 'I'm really looking forward to getting my teeth into that and get going with it. I'm going to give 100 per cent effort throughout. And I hopefully won't knock my Shergar teeth out.'</p>

<p>Explosive: Rebekah is set to head-to-head with Coleen Rooney in their looming High Court battle, after being accused of selling stories about her</p>

<p>Determined: 'Look, we tried to sort things out amicably, it just didn't work. I understand people think it's ridiculous, but what was I meant to do? I need to clear my name'</p>

<p>Hard: She added: 'I found it really tough. But to be fair Piers, in comparison to what some people have gone through with COVID and things like that, it's incomparable'</p>

<p>The news comes as Rebekah is set to head-to-head with Coleen Rooney, after sources claimed their High Court battle is due to begin in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>According to The Mirror, Coleen, 38, and Rebekah, 38, will face off in November – one year after the former accused the latter of leaking stories about her to the press. </p>

<p>Rebekah, wife of footballer Jamie Vardy, is seeking substantial damages in the subsequent libel trial, as she claims to have suffered 'severe and extreme hostility and abuse' in the fallout after the claims were published on Instagram. </p>

<p>Coleen's very public feud began when she accused Rebekah of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies. </p>

<p>It has since been claimed that Coleen wants to undertake 'forensic analysis' of Rebekah's electronics to look for evidence, according to a report from The Sun.</p>

<p>The full statement: Coleen's very public feud began when she accused Rebekah of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies</p>

<p>A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'Coleen met with her lawyers and they've told her they need to continue putting together more evidence.</p>

<p>'She needs to prove that Becky was directly responsible for the leaks or, at the very least, that the information came from her social media account.  </p>

<p>'Coleen is adamant she is right, but in a legal setting the evidence she has may not be enough to cross the threshold.'     </p>
