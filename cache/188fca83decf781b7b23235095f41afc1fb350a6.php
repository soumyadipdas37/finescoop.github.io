<p>Working hard: Having been spotted shooting late-night scenes in Manchester over the weekend, Catherine Tyldesley was at it again on Monday</p>

<p>The sequence saw her character running along the pavement, clutching what appeared to be a prescription in a bag.</p>

<p>She donned a light lilac zip-top, with matching trainers, adding skin-tight leggings in black to the active get-up.</p>

<p>She wore a further black and pink top under her jacket and matched her make-up with similar shades of mauve and rose pink.</p>

<p>She wore her dark mane scraped back in a sporty ponytail, looking serious as she jogged along the path.</p>

<p>Daylight: She was keeping much more sociable hours this time, filming during the afternoon</p>

<p>No rest for the wicked: The ex- Coronation Street actress, 36, is among the cast of ITV's gritty cop drama Viewpoint, and was filming daytime scenes in the centre of the city over the Bank Holiday</p>

<p>Costume change: She changed her evening look to sporty day-wear this time around - ditching the swish camel trench coat and donning a figure-hugging gym ensemble of a light lilac zip-top, matching trainers, and skin-tight leggings in black</p>

<p>Props: The sequence saw her character running along the pavement, clutching what appeared to be a prescription in a bag</p>

<p>Neutral tones: She wore a further black and pink top under her jacket and matched her make-up with similar shades of mauve and rose pink</p>

<p>When the cameras stopped rolling, Catherine was quick to wrap herself up in a large petrol blue padded jacket, shielding from the unseasonably cold weather.</p>

<p>She was seen between takes chatting happily to crew members, on the closed-off street.</p>

<p>Social-distancing was being adhered to, as the crew wore face masks and kept two metres back from the actress, as per the COVID-19 guidelines.</p>

<p>A man, presumed to be the director of the five-part series, was seen talking Catherine through the scene, instructing her from a safe distance.</p>

<p>Viewpoint is centered around a plot involving a tense police surveillance operation.</p>

<p>It will also star Noel Clarke as surveillance detective DC Martin King - but Catherine's character is yet to be revealed.</p>

<p>She was seen jogging into an office block - but her sporty look could mean she is playing either a civilian or a cop.</p>

<p>A couple of nights before, she appeared to be in the midst of an emotional scene as she wore a downcast expression whilst filming in front of a candle-lit vigil with Dominic Allburn and their co-stars. </p>

<p>The former Strictly Come Dancing star was seen holding her hands as if in prayer before her co-star wrapped his arms around her in comfort.</p>

<p>New role: She was seen jogging into an office block - but her sporty look could mean she is playing either a civilian or a cop</p>

<p>Closed off: The scene took place in central Manchester</p>

<p>Filming: Catherine's role is yet to be announced</p>

<p>Viewpoint is headed up by Fleabag director Harry Bradbeer, and sees DC Martin King set up his observation post in the home of single mother and secret voyeur, Zoe Sterling, played by Alexandra Roach.</p>

<p>Zoe's windows look on to Westbury Square and the home of missing primary school teacher Gemma Hillman, played by Tutenkhamun star Amy Wren.</p>

<p>She shares the home with boyfriend and prime suspect in her disappearance, Greg Sullivan, played by I May Destroy You actor Fehinti Balogun.</p>

<p>The series is based on an idea by Emmy award-winning Bradbeer and written with Silent Witness creator Ed Whitmore.</p>
