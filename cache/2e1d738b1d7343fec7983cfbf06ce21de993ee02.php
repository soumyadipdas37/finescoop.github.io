<p>Meanwhile, Karl and Jasmine recently tested negative for coronavirus, after coming into casual contact with an asymptomatic case.</p>

<p>The couple had contact with the confirmed case when they visited a restaurant to celebrate Karl's 46th birthday.</p>

<p>Last month, the father of four explained on the Today show that he decided to get tested after experiencing some symptoms.</p>

<p>'Yesterday we decided we are not feeling 100 per cent. I think all of this becomes a little bit, you know, everyone gets a little bit panicked in a way,' he said.</p>

<p>Karl added that he received his negative result on Monday, which came as 'a great relief'.</p>

<p>'The results came back at 6:05am this morning which meant I couldn't come to the Today show, but it was a great relief and it's great to know that the system is working in New South Wales,' he said.</p>
