<p>The demonstrations drew activists from both sides of the political spectrum. A man holds a 'not my cheeto' sign, in reference to the president, on Tuesday </p>

<p>Police also established a 'Prohibited Item Event Zone' covering an extensive area surrounding the venue, where large backpacks, explosives, firearms, and large metal and lumber materials, among other items deemed 'dangerous' are banned. </p>

<p>The signs held by participants were varied: Black Lives Matter, the more than 200,000 deaths from COVID in the United States, and for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. </p>

<p>In nearby Wade Oval park, protesters were seen holding baby Trump balloons and placards with messages taking aim at the president and his administration. </p>

<p>Several protests were planned ahead of the debate, including one in support for 'Black Lives and Climate Justice', according to a Facebook event. </p>

<p>Another, hosted by anti-abortion organization 'Created Equal' planned to stage a demonstration outside the university's Health Education Campus.</p>

<p>'This election is pivotal. If abortion advocates take over, America is doomed. A nation who kills its children has no future both figuratively and in real life,' the Facebook event states.    </p>

<p>On Monday, businesses began taking steps to protect their properties in the event protests and counterprotests spiraled out of control. </p>

<p>'This is some concern based on all of the folks with all of the different ideologies that will be coming to town, and if they will direct that energy toward themselves and / or if they will do toward personal property,' city councilman Blaine Griffin told Fox News.  </p>

<p>'We support anybody's right to protest and do what they need to do but we just don't want any harm to personal property,' he added. </p>

<p>The protests remained largely peaceful as of 8pm on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The 90-minute debate will be divided into six segments, selected by Fox News' Chris Wallace, who is moderating. </p>

<p>Protesters hold a 'Make Handmaids Fiction Again' sign, likely in reference to Amy Comey Barrett's Supreme Court nomination, as some critics have compared her views to those held by oppressors in the fictional novel 'The Handmaid's Tale' </p>

<p>They include: the pandemic, the economy, the Supreme Court, election integrity, the candidates' records, and 'race and violence in our cities.' </p>

<p>The candidates will not shake hands when they take the stage at 9 pm ET on Tuesday night because of the coronavirus pandemic. Instead they will stand at podiums that are socially distanced from one another while Wallace sits at a desk in front of them.</p>

<p>There will be no opening statements and the first question will go to Trump. </p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Trump arrived in Cleveland aboard Air Force One and finished a 20-minute preview visit to the debate venue shortly before Biden landed in the city at about 5pm.</p>

<p>The former vice president, 77, arrived with some of his top advisers: Jake Sullivan, Ron Klain, Mike Donilon, and sister Valerie Biden Owens.</p>

<p>Biden went directly to the debate pavilion for his own walk-through.</p>

<p>It has been generations since two candidates asked to lead a nation facing such tumult, with Americans both fearful and impatient about the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 of their fellow citizens and cost millions of jobs.</p>

<p>With just 35 days until the election, and early voting already underway in some states, Biden steps onto the stage holding leads in the polls - significant in national surveys, close in some battleground states - and looking to expand his support among suburban voters, women and seniors. </p>

<p>Surveys show the president has lost significant ground among those groups since 2016, but Biden faces his own questions encouraged by Trump's withering attacks.</p>
