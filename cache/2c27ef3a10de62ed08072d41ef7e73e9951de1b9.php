<p>Radio star and Broadway mega-fan Seth Rudetsky hosts Stars In The House with his husband James Wesley, and has been doing so since March.</p>

<p>The web series seeks to raise money for the Actors Fund amid the coronavirus lockdowns and has so far pulled in over half a million dollars.</p>

<p>Fame the TV show was based on a 1980 movie of the same name which featured a mostly different cast, although Lee was in both projects.</p>

<p>Throwback: The 70-year-old, who played a teacher on the high school program, is joined by a string of actors who played students</p>

<p>Debbie, who played a dance teacher, also had a small part in the movie but was elevated to a lead role on the TV version.</p>

<p>The musical TV series premiered on NBC in 1982 and lasted six seasons before it was ultimately canceled in 1987.</p>

<p>One of the many actors who played students on Fame was Janet Jackson herself, although she is not joining Saturday's reunion.</p>

<p>They made the show fun: Here is another cast show from the Eighties classic show</p>

<p>As well as being a success in America the program was a massive hit in Britain and Ireland, spawning more than one cast album.</p>

<p>The cast also went on tour together, performing live concerts in Europe with a swirl of press reports about backstage drama and substance use.</p>

<p>Britain's Channel 4 got some of the cast back together for a TV special called Bring Back... Fame in 2008, hosted by Justin Lee Collins.</p>

<p>Erica said on that special that during the European shows, she got so fed up of Debbie's alleged domineering behavior she left the tour and returned to New York.</p>

<p>Last year a string of cast members including Valerie, Lee, Jesse, Erica and P.R. reunited in Liverpool for a couple of concerts.</p>

<p>Fame is not the first TV show whose cast has been reunited on Stars In The House - examples range from Frasier to Crazy Ex-Girlfriend to Star Trek: Voyager.</p>

<p>Broadway casts have also gotten back together for the web show including those of Les Miserables, Rent, A Chorus Line, Mamma Mia and Urinetown.</p>
