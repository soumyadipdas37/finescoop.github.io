<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wildlife experts fear two red and blue cockatoos spotted in Sydney's south may have been the victims of animal cruelty. </p>

<p>The brightly coloured birds were photographed at a home in Bundeena near Sydney National Park.</p>

<p>Homeowner Rochelle Luke snaped a pic of the animals when they landed on her porch in search of food.  </p>

<p>The photos were later posted to the Find My Australia page on Tuesday, sparking outrage among animal lovers. </p>

<p>'I'm still not sure why this is happening or who would do such a thing,' the post was captioned. </p>

<p>'I also had a similar experience a couple of years ago coming across a pink cockatoo in the Menai area.' </p>

<p>The page also included pictures of a bright pink cockatoo that was photographed in Menai in 2017, which is not far from where the Bundeena cockatoos were found. </p>

<p>Taronga Conservation Society research scientist Dr John Martin said the birds most likely had their feathers dyed which he described as 'terrible behaviour'.</p>

<p>'It is more likely this comes down to nefarious human behaviour. The colour is completely covering the cockatoo. For it to be an accident is extremely unlikely,' Dr Martin told Nine News. </p>

<p>'If there is a situation where you have birds that are a nuisance to you, you should contact local council or Parks and Wildlife and come up with a peaceful resolution for your conflict. </p>

<p>'Humans behaving badly is not the answer to cockatoos behaving badly.'  </p>

<p>Photos of the red and blue cockatoos were posted to the Find My Australia page on Tuesday, sparking outrage among animal lovers.  Taronga research scientist Dr John Martin said it was 'terrible behaviour' that people most likely dyed the cockatoos' feathers</p>

<p>It is illegal to catch cockatoos without a permit regardless of the reasons.   </p>

<p>Dr Martin runs the Clever Cockie Project, which researches cockatoo behaviour by ethically tagging the birds and using behaviour reports from the community. </p>

<p>He encouraged people who see cockatoos coated in dye to contact the Clever Cockie Project.</p>

<p>Cockatoos with blue, green, pink and yellow colouring were previously spotted in North Bondi, Randwick, Watsons Bay, Rose Bay and Vaucluse in Sydney's eastern suburbs in April 2016.             </p>

<p>The page also included pictures of a bright pink cockatoo (left) that was photographed in Menai in 2017, which is not far from where the Bundeena cockatoos were found</p>

<p>The RSPCA and the Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service said they have received no reports about the red and blue cockatoos but encouraged anyone with information to come forward.  </p>

<p>'We haven't had any reports of dead cockatoos in the Bundeena area, so whatever the birds have been coated in doesn't seem to be poisoning them,' a WIRES spokesman said. </p>

<p>Sutherland Shire Council also said they have not held any events using dye, furthering suspicions that the cockatoo colouring was deliberate.  </p>
