<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two Australian journalists have been rushed back to Sydney from China amid urgent fears for their safety.</p>

<p>Bill Birtles from the ABC and Michael Smith from the Australian Financial Review landed in Sydney on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>Mr Smith is based in Shanghai and is the China correspondent for the AFR while Mr Birtles has been in Beijing since 2015 working as the ABC's China correspondent.  </p>

<p>Their return follows the detention of Australian journalist, Cheng Lei, who Foreign Minister Marise Payne confirmed was being detained by Chinese authorities in late August.</p>

<p>The two journalists were told they were persons of interested into an investigation into Ms Lei and were told they could only leave China after submitting to a one-hour long interview, the AFR reported.</p>

<p>Bill Birtles for the ABC was questioned by Chinese authorities and told he was banned from leaving the country before arriving in Sydney on Tuesday morning</p>

<p>The pair flew back to Australia following intense questioning by China's Ministry of State security, the ABC reported. </p>

<p>Mr Birtles was first warned to leave China last week by Australian diplomats and had booked flights for Thursday morning.</p>

<p>But upon throwing farewell drinks in his apartment on Wednesday night, seven police officers showed up at Mr Birtles' home and told him he was banned from leaving China.</p>

<p>The officers said he would be contacted the next day and would be questioned over a 'national security case'.   </p>

<p>He then spent the next four days staying in the Australian Embassy in Beijing as Chinese officials demanded an interview. </p>

<p>Mr Birtles refused to speak to them but on Sunday agreed to be interviewed so his travel ban could be lifted.</p>

<p>Chinese police officers arrived at the homes of Mr Birtles (pictured) and Mr Smith around midnight on Wednesday and told them they could not leave China</p>

<p>Both reporters were unable to leave China until agreeing to an interview. They had stayed in the Australian Embassy and consulate while waiting to fly home (pictured Bill Birtles)</p>

<p>The following morning he flew from Beijing to Shanghai and then back to Sydney. </p>

<p>Mr Smith had also been questioned by Chinese officials who arrived at his home around 12.30am on Thursday.</p>

<p>He then sought refuge at the Australian consulate in Shanghai before returning to Sydney. </p>

<p>'It's great to be back home safely after a difficult five days,' Mr Smith said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'The late night visit by police at my home was intimidating and unnecessary and highlights the pressure all foreign journalists are under in China right now.' </p>

<p>The departure of Mr Birtles and Mr Smith means there are currently no accredited Australian journalists in China. </p>

<p>It comes after it was revealed Ms Lei, who has two children in Melbourne had been detained in China since August 14.</p>

<p>It is not known why Ms Lei, who is a high profile anchor for state broadcaster CGTN in Beijing, is being detained.  </p>

<p>Tensions between China and Australian have continued to grow in recent months after Scott Morrison's call for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The Australian government in July warned Australian citizens in China faced 'arbitrary detention' on the mainland. </p>

<p>At the end of last month the Australian Government confirmed journalist Cheng Lei (pictured) was being detained in China. She is a high profile anchor for CGTN, China's English language state broadcaster</p>

<p>AFR editor-in-chief Michael Stutchbury and editor Paul Bailey released a statement about the 'disturbing' return of the two reporters. </p>

<p>'We are glad Mike Smith, our correspondent who has been based in Shanghai for two and a half years, and Bill Birtles from the ABC, have made a safe return to Australia this morning,' they said.</p>

<p>'This incident targeting two journalists, who were going about their normal reporting duties, is both regrettable and disturbing and is not in the interests of a cooperative relationship between Australia and China.' </p>

<p>Penny Wong, Opposition for foreign affairs said the reports were alarming. </p>

<p>'I would just make a point that it is regrettable that news organisations, including the ABC, have had to make this decision,' she told ABC Radio Adelaide.</p>

<p>'The reports are deeply concerning, particularly some of the suggestions about what occurred prior to Mr Birtles leaving and Mr Smith leaving.'   </p>

<p>ABC News director Gaven Morris said they had followed government advice to bring Mr Birtles home. </p>

<p>'This bureau is a vital part of the ABC's international newsgathering effort and we aim to get back there as soon as possible,' he said in a statement.</p>
