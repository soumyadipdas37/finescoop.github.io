<p>Not impressed: And when Greg surprised his two children with a huge dinosaur in the garden, the youngsters were left hysterical as they started crying and screaming over the gift</p>

<p>Trying to calm them down, she said: 'It's just pretend, it's just pretend,' with Nelly screaming: 'No!'</p>

<p>Attempting to make a joke out of the situation, Greg quipped: 'Be careful if you are living in Brentwood... there's a T-Rex on the loose!'</p>

<p>Speaking behind-the-scenes, the blonde explained: 'I get that he thought this was going to be great but actually we avoided going to a kid's birthday party a few months ago because they had one of these T-Rex dinosaurs there. </p>

<p>T-Rex on the loose! His scared kids started crying even more as the dinosaur, which was a man dressed in a huge costume, roamed the garden</p>

<p>'We knew Nelly and Arthur wouldn't like it! It completely backfired and all it did was prolong my shoot.' </p>

<p>Going back to the scene of the dinosaur, Billie was forced to take her hysterical children upstairs to get away from the huge costume.</p>

<p>While a sheepish Greg had to send away the dinosaur hire company and apologise for his upset children.</p>

<p>He said: 'They're having none of it, they won't even come downstairs at the moment. Thanks, I appreciate it.'</p>

<p>And when the businessman went upstairs, he was confronted by an annoyed Billie who said: 'Greg, you dealt with that all wrong.'</p>

<p>Explaining his actions, Greg said: 'I didn't intend, if you had helped me' with Billie replying: 'I didn't know what was going on!'</p>

<p>Feeling deflated over his backfired surprise, he went downstairs while his two children continued to cry over the dinosaur.</p>

<p>And as well as Billie, the father-of-two was told off by his mini-me as she joked in a behind-the-scene clip: 'Naughty daddy!' </p>
