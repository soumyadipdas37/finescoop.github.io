<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Every Premier League match will be televised live until the October international break with a remarkable six matches screened on one Sunday.</p>

<p>With supporters unable to return to stadiums in October as originally planned following the latest Government restrictions, the Premier League has extended its agreement to show each fixture on television.</p>

<p>It means the fourth matchday of the season, over the weekend of October 3/4, will once again see blanket coverage.</p>

<p>Each Premier League match will be televised live until at least October 4 in a new arrangement between clubs and broadcasters following the Government's latest Covid measures</p>

<p>The 20 Premier League clubs and the authorities will then come up with a solution over the international pause while acknowledging that fans will need access to games if they cannot get to stadiums.</p>

<p>Four games will be screened live on the Saturday and six on the Sunday with coverage shared between Sky Sports and BT Sport.</p>

<p>Highlights include Manchester United's meeting with Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford, which has been moved to 4.30pm on the Sunday.</p>

<p>Chelsea's home fixture against Crystal Palace kicks off what will be wall-to-wall top-flight football over that weekend on Saturday lunchtime.</p>

<p>Manchester City's visit to Elland Road to play Leeds United will be the Saturday teatime fixture with the weekend rounded off by Liverpool's trip to Aston Villa at 7.15pm on Sunday night.  </p>
