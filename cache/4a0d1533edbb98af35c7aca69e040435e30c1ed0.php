<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Oil majors were on the back foot as the price of Brent crude tumbled below $40 a barrel for the first time since June.</p>

<p>Fears are mounting that a rise in coronavirus cases around the world – including in the UK and US as well as parts of Europe and India – could hold back the global economic recovery and dent demand for fuel.</p>

<p>Brent crude fell as much as 6 per cent towards $39 while US West Texas Intermediate was down around 8 per cent. </p>

<p>Entertainment Daily and Daily Mash website-owner Digitalbox sharply narrowed losses in the first half as Britons sought distraction.</p>

<p>AIM-listed Digitalbox made a loss of £102,000, down from £713,000 in the same six months of 2019.</p>

<p>Housebuilders fell out of favour with investors as Bovis Homes-owner Vistry Group swung into the red.</p>

<p>Disruptions and shutdowns at sites during the crisis sent it plummeting to a £12million loss in the first six months of the year, down from a profit of £72.5million in 2019.</p>

<p>The number of homes it completed fell too, from 3,371 to 1,235. </p>

<p>But it struck an optimistic note, saying it had seen a 'strong start' to the second half as restrictions wound down and the housing market came out of hibernation and the Government brought in temporary changes to stamp duty.</p>

<p>It reckons full-year profits will still come in at £130million to £140million. </p>

<p>According to chief executive Greg Fitzgerald, it has seen 'positive sales trends since early May, with consumer interest higher than at any time in recent years'.</p>

<p>Analysts were split by the sector-wide tumble, with AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould saying it came 'as more investors digested recent news that various sector constituents are being investigated over the way leaseholds were sold'.</p>

<p>IG Group's Chris Beauchamp said that it was 'Brexit and the renewed lockdowns of the UK economy' that were driving the bearish sentiment.</p>

<p>The pain in construction travels beyond builders, however, in a results-heavy day on the market. Travis Perkins slumped 6.6 per cent, or 80.5p, to 1139p as Britain's largest supplier of building materials also slumped to a half-year loss.</p>

<p>Revenue fell by more than 20 per cent during the first half of the year as many construction projects were put on the backburner.</p>

<p>Aerospace and defence business Meggitt scrapped a planned dividend as bosses said the downturn in the travel industry meant it sank to a loss of £368million in the first six months of the year. </p>
