<p>'Congratulations. I would love to keep track of everything for your pregnancy. Just like with your relationship to watch you guys grow together... But I don't want to pay for an OnlyFans...'</p>

<p>However, another follower said that posting to OnlyFans is a good idea, saying it's 'so much safer and more secure!!'</p>

<p>More secure: She said she made the decision to post on OnlyFans because over the years she and Reece have been 'harassed to the point where we've had to seek legal action'</p>

<p>'I have 100 per cent control of my profile and what people have access to and comment on.</p>

<p>'I never said it was compulsory. People can choose if they wish to subscribe or not. If people don't like the idea of it or disagree with my decision then they don't have to be involved...</p>
