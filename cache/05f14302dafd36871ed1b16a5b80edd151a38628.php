<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the shocking moment a motorcyclist pulling a wheelie lets off fireworks from his bike into the air while speeding down the busy A40 in West London.</p>

<p>The footage, thought to be taken in Perivale last week, shows a biker repeatedly firing the explosives from the front of their motorcycle frame.</p>

<p>A fellow rider caught the dangerous stunt on their helmet camera and could be heard shouting in the background.</p>

<p>The motorcyclist can be seen performing wheelies and shooting fireworks in the footage, thought to be taken on the A40 in Perivale last week </p>

<p>The video was posted onto social media, with one Twitter use commenting: 'Must be what I heard last night?</p>

<p>'Thought it was a gun going off, couldn't see anything from my place but I could certainly hear engines being "driven" very fast/loud.' </p>

<p>Towards the start of the clip, the motorcyclist can be seen overtaking drivers and three other bikers before lighting the fireworks.</p>

<p>The rider starts performing wheelies while aiming the explosives into the air, before they ping onto the road in front. </p>

<p>Metropolitan Police are investigating the incident, tweeting that 'local officers have been informed'.</p>

<p>Towards the start of the clip, the motorcyclist (pictured) can be seen overtaking drivers and three other bikers before lighting the fireworks in the clip captured on a helmet camera</p>

<p>The video, above, was posted onto social media, with one Twitter use commenting: 'Must be what I heard last night? Thought it was a gun going off'</p>

<p>The angry cyclist took aim at motorbikers and almost hit them several times as he fired the explosives from the front of his bike frame.</p>

<p>With one hand on the handlebar, he used the other to pull a lighter from his pocket and he started lighting the fireworks. </p>

<p>He shot fireworks at the man, who ducked and dived to avoid getting hit, until he ran out of ammunition. </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted the Met Police for comment. </p>
