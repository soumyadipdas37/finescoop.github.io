<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lewis Hamilton has fired a warning to his F1 rivals by insisting he feels 'better than ever' after cruising to another win in Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix.</p>

<p>The Mercedes racer dominated once again at Spa and has now extended his lead at the top of the standings to 47 points over Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who finished in third behind Valtteri Bottas. </p>

<p>And after his untouchable dominance from start to finish, Hamilton remains in bullish spirits and fully focused on matching Michael Schumacher's record of seven titles. </p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton has insisted he feels 'better than ever' after storming to his Belgian GP win</p>

<p>His 89th career win further underlined his position at the top of motorsport - and Mercedes are also closing in on a seventh consecutive constructors' crown.</p>

<p>The world champion conceded that spectators may not be thrilled by the double dominance ruling over F1, but has paid tribute to the winning mentality lurking behind his formidable run. </p>

<p>He said: 'I know it is not what everyone wants to see - a Mercedes at the front - but no matter how much success we have we just keep our heads down.</p>

<p>Hamilton eased to an 89th career win at Spa and has highlighted Mercedes' winning mentality</p>

<p>'Back at the office, there are no guys celebrating. It is all about how we can win the next race and it is an incredible environment to be in.</p>

<p>'I am 35 going towards 36, but I feel better than ever so that is a positive.'</p>

<p>Hamilton finished 15 seconds ahead of Verstappen, and his fifth win of the campaign saw him strengthen his hopes of equalling the impressive haul of championships set out by Schumacher.  </p>

<p>It was not all plain sailing for him, however. The nature of his flying victory defied late fears over the condition of his tyres.  </p>

<p>The world champion was concerned over the state of his tyres in the final stages of the race</p>

<p>Hamilton admitted his initial concern that the issue may have been similar to the incident at the British Grand Prix that threatened to derail his procession. </p>

<p>'It wasn't the easiest of races,' he added. 'I had a lock-up into Turn 5 which gave me a vibration on the tyre.</p>

<p>'It was a bit of a struggle. I was nervous we might have a scenario like Silverstone where I had the puncture, so I was nursing it to the end.'</p>
