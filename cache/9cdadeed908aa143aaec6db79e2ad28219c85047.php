<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Georginio Wijnaldum 'is increasingly likely' to leave Liverpool and reunite with former Dutch manager Ronald Koeman at Barcelona.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old has played an integral part in Jurgen Klopp's revolution at Anfield, very rarely missing a game as they won the Champions League and Premier League.</p>

<p>Koeman is looking to build his own revolution and knows all about the midfielder having built a strong rapport with him during his time working as his international manager.</p>

<p>Georginio Wijnaldum is reportedly 'increasingly likely' to join Barcelona this summer</p>

<p>The Dutch midfielder's contract at Anfield expires next summer and he looks likely to leave</p>

<p>Goal have reported that Spanish sources have told them that Barcelona are 'confident of landing Koeman's top target'.</p>

<p>The report states that while Liverpool have yet to receive contact from the Spanish giants, 'that is expected to change'. </p>

<p>Wijnaldum is into the final year of his contract at Anfield and is open to a move to Barcelona, though there has been no sign from him that he is unsettled at Liverpool. </p>

<p>Barcelona have already brought in Miralem Pjanic but are seeking further reinforcements in midfield as they begin the process of rebuilding in the wake of their Champions League calamity.</p>

<p>Liverpool meanwhile are interested in signing Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara, but are reluctant to pay the Bundesliga side's asking price of £30million.</p>

<p>Wijnaldum joined Liverpool from Newcastle in 2016 and has made 187 appearances for the Reds.  </p>

<p>Wijnaldum has played an integral part of Klopp's revolution at Anfield since he joined in 2016</p>

<p>However, he has yet to be offered a new deal and there is a possibility that he could depart before the closure of the transfer window as the club are reluctant to lose him on a free at the end of his contract.</p>

<p>It has been reported that Barcelona could snap up the Dutchman for as little as £15m, </p>

<p>Wijnaldum would be a loss to Liverpool who has been an integral part of Klopp's system since he joined.</p>
