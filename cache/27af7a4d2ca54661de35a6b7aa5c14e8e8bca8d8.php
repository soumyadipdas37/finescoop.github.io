<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pamela Anderson said she was never married to film producer Jon Peters in tweets shared Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The 53-year-old Baywatch star described her union with the 75-year-old former hairdresser as a 'bizarre lunch' in a series of posts.</p>

<p>The actress was reacting to reports that she'd struck up a relationship with her bodyguard of two years while locked down during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Denial: Pamela Anderson, 53, claimed that her 12-day marriage to Jon Peters, 75, was just a 'bizarre lunch' in a series of unusual tweets from Saturday; pictured in 2018 in Paris</p>

<p>'Pamela Anderson was never married to Jon Peters — it was just a bizarre lunch ... no "marriage" no "divorce" ... [sic],' read the first tweet.</p>

<p>The post may have been written by her publicity team, as it referred to her in the third person. </p>

<p>Her account returned shortly afterward with a follow-up tweet that reiterated the first one with more detail.</p>

<p>'Pamela Anderson was never legally married to Jon Peters (life long family friend) no hard feelings — no Marraige, no Divorce... just a bizarre theatrical lunch — Pamela has a good sense of humor about it [sic].'</p>

<p>Sources previously told The Hollywood Reporter that Anderson and Peters hadn't filed for a marriage certificate after their wedding. </p>

<p>The two-time couple had a ceremony in Malibu on January 20 that was attended by Pamela's two sons and Jon's three daughters, as well as his ex-wife Christine Forsyth-Peters.</p>

<p>Although Anderson is treating the union as a goof now, both she and Peters sounded serious about it shortly afterward.</p>

<p>'There are beautiful girls everywhere,' the producer told THR after the nuptials.</p>

<p>'I could have my pick, but — for 35 years — I've only wanted Pamela. She makes me wild — in a good way. She inspires me. I protect her and treat her the way she deserves to be treated,' he continued, while also standing up for her artistic talents elsewhere.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pam shared a poem about her faux husband. </p>

<p>'He's been there all along./Never failed me -/I'm ready now/and/he's ready too,' she wrote. </p>
