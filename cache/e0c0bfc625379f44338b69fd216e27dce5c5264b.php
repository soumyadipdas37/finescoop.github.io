<p>Unhappy customer Andrew G posted a scathing review of the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant in London on TripAdvisor after visiting the establishment on Friday night. </p>

<p>He suggested the three Michelin star restaurant, owned by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, had 'lost its way' and said he would not return until there had been a 'major shake up'.</p>

<p>He also called the £20-a-head pre-selected cheese board 'insulting', saying: 'If the best Gordon Ramsay can come up with is a slice of blue, compt, goats cheese and Normandy cream cheese - all of which were bland and lacking punch - what is the world coming to?'  </p>

<p>A diner has slammed Gordon Ramsay's £20 preselected cheese board served at his restaurant in Chelsea as 'insulting' and 'bland'</p>

<p>A disgruntled customer, 'Andrew G, left a scathing review on Trip Advisor of Gordon Ramsay Restaurant in Chelsea, London, after leaving disappointed when he visited on Friday </p>

<p>In his review, Andrew said he had visited the fine dining restaurant several times before and had previously told people it was the best meal he had ever eaten. </p>

<p>But, after his experience last Friday, he said he now feels he cannot recommend it to people after finding there was 'no stand out dish' and that the canapés - which he described as 'verging on boring' were 'something I could have made at home'. </p>

<p>'I sadly feel this restaurant has lost its way - it needs a good look at what it’s rivals are doing and needs to refresh the menu,' he said. </p>

<p>'Adding a sorrel sauce to the lobster ravioli instead of the perfect shellfish bisque is not exactly cutting-edge.'</p>

<p>The celebrity chef's three Michelin star restaurant was slammed by the diner for its 'insulting' £20-a-head cheese board and the canapés which he said were 'verging on boring'</p>

<p>Disgruntled Andrew did however admit that once the service he received was perfect - once he had asked for the food to be slowed down as it was coming 'thick and fast'. </p>

<p>Three courses at the restaurant are priced at £130 a head, with an addition £8 cost for teas and coffees. </p>

<p>Customers can also purchase experiences for the restraurant, starting at £150 for a three course meal for two and up to £1,000 for a cooking master class in the three Michelin star kitchen.  </p>

<p>The latest negative review is the fourth time this month that the celebrity TV chef food has been slammed.</p>

<p>After visiting several times before and previously calling it the best meal he had ever eaten, Andrew G now says he will not visit Gordon Ramsay Restaurant until there is a 'major shake up'</p>

<p>Weeks ago, he was criticised online when he shared a photograph of his Sunday lunch on Instagram. </p>

<p>While Gordon labelled the 'sirloin of beef with all the trimmings' 'absolutely stunning', several of his 9.8million followers were left unimpressed by the three baby carrots and roast potatoes offered - with one person asking: 'Where's the rest of it?</p>

<p>He also came under fire with both his £19 Full English Breakfast at the Savoy Grill and the 'tiny' £23 steak and over-salted chips at his York &amp; Albany eatery in Camden, being criticised.</p>
