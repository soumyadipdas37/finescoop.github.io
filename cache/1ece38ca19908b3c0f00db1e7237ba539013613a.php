<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dramatic video captured the moment a decommissioned ship was torn apart by a volley of missiles and shells at the culmination of a two-week naval drill.</p>

<p>The USS Durham, a cargo vessel which was taken out of in 1994, was hit by a US-made Harpoon and Hellfire missiles, French Exocet missiles, and five-inch shells fired from American, Australian, Canadian, and Bruneian ships.</p>

<p>The sinking marks the end of the biennial Rim of the Pacific naval training exercise - which is typically the largest anywhere in the world, but was scaled back this year due to coronavirus.</p>

<p>Even so, the two-week drill involved 22 ships, one submarine and 5,300 personnel from ten different countries, led by the US Navy.</p>

<p>The exercise took place in the waters off Hawaii, and involved combat maneuvers and live-fire drills.</p>

<p>All land-based exercises were called off, and ship-boarding drills were also abandoned to reduce the risk of transmitting coronavirus.</p>

<p>The sinking exercise took place on Saturday, with the Durham disappearing below the waves shortly after midnight on Sunday.</p>

<p>'It's really paramount that we maintain partnerships and alliances so we are ready as a team to face whatever crisis may arise' Capt. Jay Steingold, director of this year's RIMPAC exercise, said ahead of the drills, when ran from August 17 to 31.</p>

<p>'RIMPAC, no matter what it looks like, will help us increase our ability to operate together and build that trust,' Steingold said.</p>

<p>The exercise also takes place amid escalating tensions between the US and China in the Pacific, centered around the South China Sea.</p>

<p>In July, the US sailed two carrier groups led by the USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan through the region in a 'freedom of navigation' exercise, designed as a snub to Beijing which claims control over the disputed waters.</p>

<p>As the exercise went ahead, Washington accused China of a 'campaign of bullying' in the region, targeting US partners including Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, all of whom claim rights to parts of the lucrative shipping territory.</p>

<p>China has also been rushing to modernize its navy to counter US forces in the region, with its first homemade aircraft carrier - the Type 002 - launched in 2017.</p>

<p>The country also has a new carrier under construction - the Type 003 - which is nearing completion at a dry dock in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Just this week, Beijing announced the launch of two new destroyers - the Type 055 and Type 052D - to replace its ageing Type 051 design. </p>
