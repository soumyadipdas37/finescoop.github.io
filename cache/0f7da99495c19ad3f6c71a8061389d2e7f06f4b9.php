<p>Back at it: Fashion designer Nicky Hilton hit a snazzy event in New York City on Wednesday</p>

<p>Ready for fall: The blonde socialite had on a black tank top and stripped slacks as she went mask free at the Alice + Olivia show during NY Fashion Week</p>

<p>Nicky looked stylish in a black sleeveless top with a silver necklace and black-and-white striped slacks with black pointy heels and a black structured purse.</p>

<p>Her hair looked newly lightened and cut just to her shoulders as she had her makeup carefully applied.</p>

<p>And the cover girl did not have a mask on as she was over six feet away from photographers.</p>

<p>Good times: Later she met up with stunning blogger and socialite Olivia Palermo at Sant Ambroeus</p>

<p>Le look: Olivia was in a creamy beige coat over a dark beige sweater and black leather slacks with her hair pulled back </p>

<p>The ladies had white and red wine as well as a bottle of chilled water during their al fresco meet up.  </p>

<p>They laughed up a storm as they appeared to be close, longtime friends. </p>

<p>On Monday Paris' heartbreaking film This Is Paris debuted on YouTube; the movie offered many new details about Paris' childhood.</p>

<p>Side by side: The ladies had their masks on as they walked down the street. Olivia opted for a lavender mask and Nicky a black and white one</p>

<p>A new era: Celebrities have been trying to choose fashionable masks and Louis Vuitton has even made some very pricey ones</p>

<p>A look indeed: She seemed to treat the sidewalk as her runway as she walked in six inch heels. And the star took her time to look up and down the street for different angles</p>

<p>The information Paris shared was shocking: her parents had her taken by two men from her bedroom and sent off to a camp for troubled youth when she was only about 16-years-old.</p>

<p>She ran away from several camps before landing at Provo Canyon School in Utah where she claims she was beaten, drugged and sent to solitary confinement. She was there for 11 months, only leaving when she turned 18-years-old.</p>

<p>When Paris talks this over with sister at the designer's New York home, Nicky reminds her that she did a lot of 'naughty' things in NYC at 16 to cause such serious action.</p>

When Paris talks this over with sister at the designer's New York home, Nicky reminds her that she did a lot of 'naughty' things to cause such serious action.</p>

<p>Nicky did not say what the naughty things were but she asks her sister if she ever apologized to their parents for her actions.</p>

<p>Paris does admit during the documentary that she constantly partied at nightclubs using her fake ID and she also cut school.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, her mother Kathy Hilton was hoping to make Paris into a debutante.</p>

<p>Paris is seen reliving the nightmare that was Provo and often cries in the docu as her painful experiences have given her PTSD resulting in regular nightmares which has led to crippling insomnia.</p>
