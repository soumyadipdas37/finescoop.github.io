<p>Footage from Barnet in North London captures the gridlock as a man narrates the scene before him, saying: 'The car is going nowhere, the bus is going nowhere and the lorry that has just come behind the bus is going no where.'</p>

<p>'This is absolutely crazy,' he adds. 'This is nutty.'  </p>

<p>'I could be here a long time while this unfolds,' the cameraman goes on, panning to show a van on the other side of the road blocking the bus. </p>

<p>The standoff comes amid the Mayor of London's ongoing war on motorists, after his measures to curb pollution have come under fire for causing chaos on the roads. </p>

<p>His £33million Low Traffic Neighbourhood has implemented cycle lane segregation and banned turns at several junctions to promote alternative forms of travel.</p>

<p>However it has been dropped by his own local council over concerns it is causing 'chaos', blocking emergency vehicles and generating 'excessive levels of pollution'.</p>

<p>A statement from the Wandsworth Conservatives earlier this month claimed the scheme, which prohibited vehicles from using certain roads, is 'not wanted' and the 'adverse effects' are now clear.</p>

<p>Congestion has also been compounded by the closure of Hammersmith Bridge. </p>

<p>Mr Khan's £33million Low Traffic Neighbourhood has implemented cycle lane segregation and banned turns at several junctions to promote alternative forms of travel</p>

<p>Rivals accuse Mr Khan of creating 'incompetence and chaos' by not getting a grip on the repair works after the route was closed in April 2019.</p>

<p>Last week, Conservative London Assembly member Tony Arbour said: 'You have created incompetence and chaos on both sides of Hammersmith Bridge.</p>

<p>'You have caused an existential crisis for the residents of Barnes. Will he man-up and actually take action?'</p>

<p>Mr Khan said: 'If the member was being serious about wishing to have the bridge opened sooner rather than later he would be lobbying his government friends to get moving.' </p>

<p>His scheme has sparked fury among residents in London, with some claiming the mayor has diverted traffic through poorer areas.  </p>

<p>One woman, from Brent in northwest London, said: 'Apparently, the 'privileged' south of the ward gets signage saying healthy neighbourhood, local access only. </p>

<p>'We poor sods who live in the less favoured part are therefore classified as suitable for thru traffic. This is disgusting.' </p>

<p>Residents in the One Oval group have also organised protests over Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in Lambeth, arguing the scheme is displacing traffic to poorer areas and already busy main roads.</p>

<p>Sam Cooray told the Guardian: 'I'm between two main roads so I'm in a cloud of pollution, and my children are in a cloud of pollution.'</p>

<p>She said those who advocate for the scheme are from a very narrow section of the area, adding: 'They are not representative of working classes, of BME communities, of the disabled, of local businesses.' </p>

<p>Despite the dozens of new cycle lanes added under Mr Khan's Low Traffic Neighbourhood scheme, photographs taken earlier this month showed how the paths were empty while cars and vans sat in heavy traffic alongside them.</p>

<p>The new lanes were brought in to encourage people to cycle to work by giving them more space and reduce the pressure on public transport amid fears over social distancing issues on the Underground and buses. </p>

<p>It comes as Transport for London had to ask the Government for a £4.5billion bailout after its revenue plummeted by 90 per cent and it quickly burned through its £2billion reserves after the coronavirus lockdown was imposed in March.</p>

<p>But roads such as Balham High Street in South London, Upper Street in Islington and Park Lane in Mayfair were empty of bicycles, with the reduced road space appearing to instead cause congestion for local motorists. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, on Colliers Wood High Street a cycle lane has been bizarrely built directly right through the underhang of a bus stop, with one Twitter user saying: 'Can you spot the mistake on this? Waste of money!' </p>
