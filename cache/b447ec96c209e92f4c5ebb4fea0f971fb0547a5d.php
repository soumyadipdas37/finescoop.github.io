<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A drastic breakthrough in negotiations is required if England's Jadon Sancho is to finalise a move to Manchester United within the next month.</p>

<p>United have trailed Sancho all summer but are making little progress in talks surrounding the agent fee for brokering a move and the player's salary.</p>

<p>Discussions between the two parties are ongoing, albeit slowly, and United will not negotiate a fee with Borussia Dortmund until a deal has been reached with the 20-year-old's representatives.</p>

<p>Manchester United are in need of a drastic breakthrough to seal the signing of Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>Dortmund value Sancho at more than £100million and want him to remain at Signal Iduna Park for the season. United want a resolution to specifics pertaining to the contract before approaching the German side.</p>

<p>The stagnation leaves United with a race against time if they are to land the winger in an area of the pitch Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hopes to add further quality.</p>

<p>They retain an interest in RB Leipzig's Dayot Upamecano as defensive reinforcement, although that move appears geared towards next summer.</p>

<p>The Borussia Dortmund and England star has been United's top priority all summer</p>

<p>Upamecano - who has been trailed by a host of top European sides after a strong last year in the Bundesliga - would cost significantly more than a £38m release clause that does not kick in until 2021.</p>

<p>United would face stiff competition for the France international's signature if they held back on firming up their interest this month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is understood that United have not yet prepared a bid for Real Madrid left back Sergio Reguilon.</p>

<p>The Red Devils have failed to make progress in talks for the move with the German side </p>
