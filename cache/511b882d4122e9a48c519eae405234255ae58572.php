<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Top chefs have opened up about how their restaurants and careers fell to ruin when coronavirus hit.</p>

<p>Sydney's hospitality industry was brought to its knees by COVID-19 restrictions, with about 70 per cent of businesses forced to cut staff or close their doors altogether.</p>

<p>Among the rubble of the once thriving culinary scene lies the remains of Neil Perry's award-winning steakhouse chain Rockpool Bar and Grill, Jacqui Challinor's restaurant Nomad and Josh Niland's fish joint Saint Peter.</p>

<p>Bleak images of the revered gastronomic geniuses sitting among their boarded-up venues were captured by commercial food and lifestyle photographer Rob Palmer.</p>

<p>Josh Niland of Saitn Peter restaurant finds himself on the floor of Saint Peter, surrounded by brown paper bags, containers and other detritus of his quick pivot to takeaway meal</p>

<p>The photographer, who spent months documenting the restaurateurs' spectacular collapse for portrait series 'Industry SOS: The COVID-19 Time Capsule', was able to capture the moment his subjects hit rock-bottom.</p>

<p>'Neil [Perry], obviously to sit there and see his baby that he'd worked so hard at locked up and mothballed was devastating,' Palmer told the Daily Telegraph. </p>

<p>Perry, who retired as culinary director of the 80 restaurants at Rockpool Dining Group in July citing COVID-19 as a reason for his departure, is pictured sitting with his eyes closed among the furniture in his Sydney venue.</p>

<p>While restaurants in all states except virus-addled Victoria have reopened, the business is believed to have lost about $40million last financial year. </p>

<p>Challinor's Surry Hills restaurant Nomad was destroyed in a fire in September 2019, only to collapse once again to the pandemic.</p>

<p>The chef was captured with her head in her hands, as her white uniform hung from an empty shelf behind her.</p>

<p>'Nomad had had a fire the year before, they'd just moved the restaurant to a temporary location and a few weeks after opening, COVID hit so they shut for a second time in six months. [Jacqui Challinor] just lost everything'. </p>

<p>The venue will reopen in a temporary space in October.</p>

<p>While Niland quickly transformed his venue into a takeaway venue, Palmer said he was at odds with the decision.</p>

<p>'He was saying three or four weeks ago, you would never have seen a takeaway container in my restaurant … He was really struggling with what the vision would be after COVID.'  </p>

<p>Celebrity Chef Matt Moran, who makes regular appearances on Masterchef Australia, was also pictured in his whites with a face mask.</p>

<p>Moran, who runs the iconic Opera Bar outside the Sydney Opera House, has pleaded with the NSW government to undo capacity limits for venues.</p>

<p>The Opera Bar has a capacity of 2,000, but can now only seat 300 under coronavirus restrictions. </p>

<p>'I'm not an expert but I think they should definitely be looking at it because Opera Bar is a big outdoor space. Limiting that to 300 - I think it's pretty tough,' he told the publication.</p>

<p>'The one to 4m sq really hurts us. If we went to one to 2m sq it would help a hell of a lot.'</p>

<p>The photography series will be an ongoing project as part of the Powerhouse Museum's Culinary Archive. </p>
