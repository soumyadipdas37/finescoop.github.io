<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool new boy Diogo Jota is at the same technical level as the deadly front three of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mo Salah, according to assistant coach Pep Lijnders. </p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp's No 2 talked up the new £45million signing ahead of his possible debut against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup on Thursday evening. </p>

<p>In the pre-game press conference, he said of the former Wolves man: 'You saw our schedule? He will win matches.</p>

<p>New Liverpool signing Diogo Jota is as good as the front three technically, says Pep Lijnders</p>

<p>'He is a player on the level of the front three technically, a pressing monster.'</p>

<p>Klopp has previously taken a while to bed in new signings and introduce them to first team football. </p>

<p>But Lijnders thinks it should not take too long before Jota finds his feet. He added: 'The adaptation will hopefully be quite quick, with good players it is normally quite quick. He has to learn our game and the way we want to do things.</p>

<p>'When we see him play in the national team for Portugal we see them play 4-3-3, there are a lot of similarities between these two teams.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp's No 2 believes Jota will 'create solutions' and win games for Liverpool </p>

<p>'He will play. He has been bought to create solutions for us.'</p>

<p>It is understood that Lijnders was a key factor in signing Jota after receiving reports of the player from his time at Porto in 2016/17. </p>

<p>His Premier League debut for the Reds may come on Monday night when Liverpool welcome Arsenal to Anfield.  </p>

<p>Jota plays in a similar system in Portugal so his adaptation on Merseyside should be easy</p>
