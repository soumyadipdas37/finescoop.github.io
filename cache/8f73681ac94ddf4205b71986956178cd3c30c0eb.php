<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman killed in a fall after being blown over by gale force winds was ignored by over a dozen people who saw her struggling.</p>

<p>Linda McKenna, 44, repeatedly fell over as she battled against Storm Jorge in the early hours of March 1.</p>

<p>She was picked up on town centre CCTV but an operator assumed she was drunk and told the inquest they did not want to 'waste resources' by calling 999.</p>

<p>Miss McKenna left her mother Sue's house at 1.30am and was seen walking through Blackpool town centre in Lancs., 'with purpose'.</p>

<p>She disappeared behind some bins before emerging 12 minutes later in an intoxicated state.</p>

<p>Miss McKenna then staggered through the streets where she suffered several falls partially due to Storm Jorge raging at the time, the inquest was told.</p>

<p>Eventually three people stopped to help her and she was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital in an unconscious state at around 4am, butÂ died from her injuries the next day.</p>

<p>Linda McKenna, pictured with a friend, was struggling but was not helped by passers-by</p>

<p>A postmortem by Dr Mark Sissons said the cause of death was a brain haemorrhage due to blunt force trauma.</p>

<p>The inquest heard there was evidence of drugs in her system.</p>

<p>Handing down a conclusion of accidental death, coroner Alan Wilson said: 'It was a noticeably windy night.</p>

<p>'The footage shows Linda walking with purpose; then she goes behind some wheely bins.</p>

<p>'She then emerges and walks into a wall.</p>

<p>'There is a clear difference between before she went behind the wheely bins and afterwards.</p>

<p>'She has taken some substance that has left her intoxicated pretty quickly.'</p>

<p>Referring to the person who saw her while monitoring CCTV cameras in the area, he added: 'Looking at the footage there is a point after Linda comes within the view of the cameras that he zooms in on her, and that is within a few minutes of him becoming aware of Linda.</p>

<p>'On the one hand it is unclear whether she would have suffered a significant head injury from these examples of CCTV footage.</p>

<p>'On the other hand, she is on the floor for a long period of time. It seems to me that anyone watching her would absolutely have a cause for ringing an ambulance or the police. She seems to be vulnerable.</p>

<p>'However, it doesn't appear to me that even if there had been an earlier call to emergency services that it would have been a different outcome for Linda.'</p>

<p>He said he would write to the firm who employed the man, urging bosses to remind staff that they are able to call 999 when seeing someone in a vulnerable state.</p>
