<p>The groundbreaking DNA-based vaccine has been developed by medical experts at Sydney University.</p>

<p>About 150 people have signed up for human trials to test the COVID-19 drug later in the year, which is administered to patients via a thin jet of air through the skin.</p>

<p>Doctor Ginni Mansberg said the inoculation device, known as PharmaJet, could be more effective than a jab. </p>

<p>Doctor Ginni Mansberg said the inoculation device, known as PharmaJet, could be more effective than a jab (pictured)</p>

<p>'It goes directly into the skin, which is the body's biggest immune system organ, and we think skin-delivered vaccines have the potential to do better,' she told Sunrise.</p>

<p>Dr Mansberg also explained the DNA-based vaccine would potentially improve the body's immune response, compared to a conventional drug.</p>

<p>'The whole idea is your body's going to recognise tiny amounts of DNA and build it's own antigens to stimulate your immune system.' </p>

<p>While the air jet system is not completely painless, it removes the risk of 'needle stick injuries' to health workers to administer the jab. </p>

<p>The potential vaccine follows the Federal Government's announcement of a multi million-dollar financial boost for vaccination developers.</p>

<p>'Our Government continues to invest in medical research to supercharge the development of promising vaccines to save lives and protect lives,' Health Minister Greg Hunt said upon announcing the funding.</p>

<p>Vaccines are traditionally made using weakened versions of a virus that are injected into the body to trigger an immune response. </p>

<p>In a DNA vaccine, a small amount of the the virus' genetic information is inserted into the body.</p>

<p>Cells can then produce a protein which is needed to trigger an immune response.</p>

<p>Scientists say the DNA of a virus can be replicated relatively quickly and easily. </p>

<p>Mr Hunt also announced on September 7 that the government signed a deal to buy a vaccine being developed at Oxford University, and another produced at the University of Queensland. </p>

<p>He explained both vaccines will require two injections to be effective. </p>

<p>'It's likely that both vaccines will require what's called a double shot, or an initial vaccination and a booster approximately a month later,' he told reporters.</p>

<p>He said they will likely provide immunity to coronavirus for several years.</p>

<p>'The best advice that we have - and it's not determined yet - is that there is likely to be multiyear protection,' he said.</p>

<p>'Nobody can say whether it will be lifetime.'</p>

<p>Researchers at the University of Queensland are in early controlled-group stages in the testing of their vaccine - known as phase one - while the University of Oxford scientists are at the more advanced phase-three stage involving 30,000 people.</p>

<p>If successful, the vaccines will be rolled out to Australians who want one for free. A vaccine will not be compulsory. </p>
