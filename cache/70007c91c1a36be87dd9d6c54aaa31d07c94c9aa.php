<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United legend Gary Neville has urged the club to move on from the Jadon Sancho transfer saga and criticised their recruitment ploys in the market.</p>

<p>Despite only qualifying for the Champions League on the final day of the Premier League last season, the Red Devils have so far only bolstered their squad with the £40million addition of midfielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax.</p>

<p>Van de Beek’s arrival last week pales in insignificance to United’s top-four rivals who have all invested heavier into their squads – bar champions Liverpool. </p>

<p>Gary Neville (above) has ordered Manchester United to give up on signing Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>The Red Devils have made 20-year-old Sancho (above) their top transfer priority this summer</p>

<p>This is highlighted by Chelsea, who finished below United on goal difference last term, who have spent more than £230m on six players so far.</p>

<p>With United’s 2020-21 campaign starting on September 19, at home to Crystal Palace, Neville believes his former side will only have themselves to blame if they fail to add anymore new faces before the transfer window shuts on October 5. </p>

<p>However, he has warned them not to be taken for a ride in terms of paying over the odds for certain targets.</p>

<p>Neville hopes United aren't taken for a ride by Dortmund's valuation for the player (above)</p>

<p>‘Like everyone else they had three months off because of coronavirus, so I don't think it should be the case they didn't have the resource or time to get things done,’ he told Sportsmail.</p>

<p>‘Chelsea got their business done, [Manchester] City have got three or four pieces done. I don't think timing's the issue.</p>

<p>‘It's just a thing with United that every time they go for a player in the last four, five, six years it feels they are a little bit desperate.</p>

<p>‘They think they can hang on but they always pay it [the asking price] in the end.</p>

<p>‘That's sometimes where I think you can take control, give a hard deadline and say “we're moving away from this deal”.’</p>

<p>While Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has bought one player, Frank Lampard's Chelsea have signed loads</p>

<p>And Neville feels Sancho is the perfect example of the latter point. The 20-year-old is United's No 1 target this summer but they have been at loggerheads with Borussia Dortmund over £108m valuation for the forward. Coupled with this stumbling block are the player’s wages and his agent fees. </p>

<p>United are determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past few years which has seen them make some costly errors in the transfer market. And this has been heightened by the pandemic.</p>

<p>‘That's been the frustration with Sancho,’ Neville continued during a TalkTalk media opportunity.</p>

<p>Neville claims United may have to leave Sancho in Germany for the time being</p>

<p>‘The fact that it's dragged on. Just say to Dortmund “leave him there” and go get another player.</p>

<p>‘There are plenty of players around, there can't be just one player you're chasing.</p>

<p>‘It is frustrating but I do think United have been better in these last couple of seasons, more careful and not making mistakes either.</p>

<p>‘If you can't get a deal done [for Sancho] you have to move on. You certainly have to give hard deadlines on players.’ </p>
