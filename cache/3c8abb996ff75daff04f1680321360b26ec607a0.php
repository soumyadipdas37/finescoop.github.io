<p>Back to work: Kate completed the look with nude heels and green hoop earrings as she beamed and waved for the camera</p>

<p>Kate took a break from work to spend time with her children and husband, Derek Draper, who remains in intensive care as he continues to recover from COVID-19.</p>

<p>But last week she announced she would be returning to her Smooth Radio show so that Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.' </p>

<p>She will record her show from 10am to 1pm everyday this week, after her friend Myleene Klass filled in for her during her break.  </p>

<p>Lovely: She wore her blonde tresses in a chic bob and looked radiant in a natural covering of makeup</p>

<p>Hard times: Kate took a break from work to spend time with her children and husband, Derek Draper, who remains in intensive care as he continues to recover from COVID-19 </p>

<p>Chic: Kate looked effortlessly cool in the matching set which she teamed with a feminine blouse of the same hue </p>

<p>Recovery: The TV broadcaster looked in high spirits despite the tough year she has had with her family</p>

<p>Derek, 53, was hospitalised back in March after suffering complications from contracting COVID-19, and has remained there since.   </p>

<p>Last Thursday the TV star revealed how she celebrated her 15th wedding anniversary with Derek after being unable to visit him in hospital. </p>

<p>Speaking on last Friday's Good Morning Britain, she revealed she was able see him later in the day, but admitted it felt 'strange' as Derek is in a limited consciousness state. </p>

<p>Return: Last week she announced she would be returning to her Smooth Radio show so that Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love'</p>

<p>Wow: She stunned in the salmon number as she headed back to work after her break to be with her family</p>

<p>Quite the arrival! Kate rocked up to the studios on a snazzy motorbike, donning a safety helmet and mask</p>

<p>Here I am: The blonde beauty made sure to put safety first as she donned a face mask during her arrival</p>

<p>Kate revealed: 'We did our best to make it special. We had him on FaceTime. We raised a glass to say happy anniversary.</p>

<p>'I have a card to take to read to him. He was a prolific card writer for birthdays. He'd always remember. And hopefully he'll do it again.</p>

<p>'It will be strange reading to him, but this time I have made a bit more of an effort.'   </p>

<p>Strutting: She will record her show from 10am to 1pm everyday this week, after her friend Myleene Klass filled in for her during her break</p>

<p>All smiles: Kate turned back to beam at the cameras as she pulled open the door to the studios in London</p>

<p>Radiant: Kate looked glowing with a typically light covering of makeup and a slick of pink lip</p>

<p>Derek is now in a limited consciousness and is unable to talk - but can hear things. His carers have been playing GMB on TV for him, while Kate is on. </p>

<p>Kate returned to the studio having taken time out to settle her children into school, after what has been a challenging six months for the family.</p>

<p>She shares Darcey, 14, and William, 11, with Derek. </p>

<p>Standing tall: The star elongated her legs in a pair of nude heels which went perfectly with her suit</p>

<p>Classy: Kate showed off her waist in the high waisted pink trousers that were cinched in at her middle</p>

<p>Happy days: She appeared to be in a very good mood as she posed for cameras ahead of her work shift</p>

<p>Derek is one of an estimated just five people in the world whose bodies have been damaged so much by Covid. </p>

<p>He has survived but for how long – or even if he can recover – the doctors can't say as his condition constantly fluctuates. </p>

<p>Kate contracted coronavirus herself at the same time as Derek, but made a full recovery. </p>

<p>Strange: Kate's husband Derek, 53, was hospitalised back in March after suffering complications from contracting COVID-19, and has remained there since</p>
