<p>Hanging with pals: Kristin Cavallari appears to be navigating her post-split life with a sense of humor and the support of her longtime hairstylist Justin Anderson</p>

<p>As they shared a chair, Anderson wrapped one arm around the star's waist, as she smoldered at the camera under an oversized pair of black sunglasses.  </p>

<p>Additionally on her Instagram Story, she joked to her more than four million followers that the dpHUE co-founder was her 'boyfriend for the weekend.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Anderson cheekily wrote that Cavallari 'tried to say she wasn’t in the mood for a picture,' before she posed up a storm with one hand on top of her white fedora. </p>

<p>The pair's poolside snaps captured the E! star's sensational figure, as she sported a tiny black bikini, which showcased the results of her doing 'keto all week.' </p>

<p>While the stunner has always maintained an incredibly fit figure, seven days of the low-carb, high-fat keto appeared to further enhance her already taut midriff. </p>

<p>Anderson affectionately referred to his platonic friend as his 'baby' before sharing a snap with another pal on his Instagram Story with the caption 'the squad shows up for each other.'  </p>

<p>Longtime friends: The pals first began working together when the mother-of-three first shot to fame on MTV’s Laguna Beach, at just 18</p>
