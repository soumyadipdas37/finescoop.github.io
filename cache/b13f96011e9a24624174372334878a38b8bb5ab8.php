<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The hilarious moment a magpie swooped a junior football player so relentlessly he had to leave the field was captured on camera by an amused spectator. </p>

<p>The bird singled out Parkes Spacemen player Jack Skinner during a junior rugby league match against the Forbes Magpies in Dubbo, on Saturday.</p>

<p>Jack had to bob and weave in an attempt to escape the bird, which was unfazed by the other 25 players on the field.</p>

<p>The relentless onslaught eventually forced the coach to pull Jack from the field, much to the amusement of some spectators.</p>

<p>Parkes junior rugby league player Jack Skinner (pictured) was swooped so relentlessly by a magpie in Dubbo he was forced to flee the field </p>

<p>'They're taking him off!' one spectator said. </p>

<p>The magpie still wasn't satisfied and pursued the young player from the field as a team trainer tried to protect him. </p>

<p>Once Jack made it to the sideline the bird disappeared from view and seemed to finally leave him alone. </p>

<p>Video of the incident has already been viewed more than 300,000 times on social media.</p>

<p>'Magpies rule all footy fields mate. Swoop swoop,' one Facebook user wrote. </p>

<p>'Only time you'd ever see me run,' another added. </p>

<p>'What nightmares are made of,' a third user joked. </p>

<p>Amused spectators captured the sustained swooping on camera as Jack bobbed and weaved in an attempt to escape the territorial bird (pictured)</p>

<p>Despite there being only one video the magpie reportedly swooped a number of other players during the game. </p>

<p>Magpies usually breed between August and October, which is when they become protective of their nests.</p>

<p>Swooping from one bird will generally last six weeks, or until their chicks are fledged and ready to leave the nest. </p>

<p>Research has also shown magpies can recognise up to at least 100 different people and tend to only swoop things they see as a threat.  </p>

<p>Despite there only being footage Jack being forced to run from the magpie (pictured) the bird allegedly swooped a number of other players during the game</p>
