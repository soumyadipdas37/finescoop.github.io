<p>A truckie who was taken to court by his ex-wife after letting their teenage daughter get a tattoo is celebrating a minor win in a case that's torn the family apart.   </p>

<p>Bradley Victory, 45, admits allowing his daughter Casey to get a dreamcatcher tattoo on her ankle at Picton Tattoos in Sydney's south-west last year, when she was aged 16.</p>

<p>His ex-wife Nadene Rae Rees has lodged court proceedings over the incident, alleging the decision was made without her consent. </p>

<p>Mr Victory was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.  </p>

<p>But after a court appearance at Picton Local Court on Wednesday, the latter charge was dropped.  </p>

<p>Casey Victory (pictured) was 16 when she got a tattoo of a dreamcatcher on her ankle</p>

<p>'If I thought it was going to cause this much drama I would have waited until she was 18, and it would have saved me and her a lot of grief,' Mr Victory told A Current Affair. </p>

<p>'I'll do anything for Casey. I would go to extremes to protect my daughter and all my kids. They mean the world to me.'</p>

<p>Minors are required written permission from a parent or guardian to get a piercing or tattoo under New South Wales law.</p>

<p>Casey did have the consent of her father, who she said she has lived with for the past three years.   </p>

<p>'I thought it would be nice to have a nice dreamcatcher on my ankle,' she said, lamenting the situation her father is now in. </p>

<p>'He's the best dad I could ever ask for. He does everything for me. Teaches me how to do stuff. I can go to him about anything, can ask him anything. When I need help he's always there for me.'</p>

<p>The dreamcatcher symbolises good luck in native American culture and the image had a significant meaning for the teenager at the time.   </p>

<p>'Casey came to me and asked me "dad, can I get a tattoo?' She said "I really want a tattoo, I want to put the past behind me",' Mr Victory said. </p>

<p>'I've got tattoos, so I can't really be a hypocrite.'</p>

<p>Sydney Lawyer Sam Macedone has questioned Ms Rees' decision to bring the issue before the courts.</p>

<p>When Nadene Rees (pictured), from Hilltop, discovered the tattoo she was furious, taking legal action against her ex-husband</p>

<p>'This is not common at all in a criminal court. This is a matter between ex-husband, ex-wife. To have a criminal prosecution, where one parent gives consent to his daughter to get a tattoo - which is quite legal - then I don't understand what this is all about,' Mr Macedone said.</p>

<p>'There are other ways of dealing with this matter. But having this man charged with wounding his daughter or assaulting her is, in my mind, ridiculous.'  </p>

<p>Mr Victory is hopeful the day's court proceedings will be a sign of things to come.</p>

<p>'It's very good, I'm very pleased that [one charge] was withdrawn – hopefully the rest will get thrown out later on,' Mr Victory told the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>'I want to get all of this out of the way … I've just had enough.' </p>

<p>Casey, now 17, continues to stand by her father throughout the ordeal.</p>

<p>'They can pick a side if they think I'm right and dad's right or my mother's right, but I think we've done the right thing. I'm pretty sure we're in the right,' she said.</p>

<p>A hearing will be held next year for the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. </p>

<p>If he is convicted he could face up to five years in jail.  </p>
