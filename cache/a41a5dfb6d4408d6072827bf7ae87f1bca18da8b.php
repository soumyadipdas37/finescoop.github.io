<p>A post shared by  Alessandra Ambrosio (<?php echo e('@'); ?>alessandraambrosio) on Sep 2, 2020 at 4:14pm PDT</p>

<p>She kicked through the water in the Wave Bikini Milky Way set, that retails for $196, from her brand. </p>

<p>The bikini top features a twisted padded bandeau style, and thick crossed straps. </p>

<p>While the bottoms sat high on her hips and lowered into a v-shape in the front, with a cheeky but in the back. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two added a green beaded necklace and a long gold chain to her look. </p>

<p>Getaway: She has been enjoying her tropical vacation and the amenities at the Waldorf Astoria in the Maldives </p>

<p>She shielded her eyes from the sun in thin brown lenses sunglasses, as her golden blonde and brown hair flowed in the breeze.  </p>

<p>The model flew to the Maldives last month with her two children and boyfriend of two years, Italian businessman Nicolo Oddi. </p>

<p>Alessandra shares her kids, Anja, 12 and Noah, 8 with her ex-fiance Jamie Mazur whom she split from after 10 years though he was not present on the dream trip.</p>

<p>In addition to having a luxurious family vacation, Alessandra and her family were there to celebrate her daughter Anja who turned 12 on August 24. </p>

<p>Paradise found: The GAL Floripa designer posted a loved up snap with her boyfriend of two years Nicolo Oddi as the family enjoyed a celebratory night out at the gorgeous Maldives hotel</p>

<p>The whole extended Ambrosio family was invited to relax and celebrate, as her parents Lucilda and Luiz were in attendance as well as her cousins.  </p>

<p>The veteran model paid tribute to her 'ray of sunshine' with a series of posts and documented the celebratory family outing on her social media.  </p>

<p>Before jetting to the Maldives, Alessandra and her family had been locked down in their Santa Monica, California home.</p>

<p>Ray of sunshine: Alessandra wished her daughter Anja, 12 happy birthday in adorable photos surrounded by pink, blue and yellow balloons as well as birthday treats during the trip</p>

<p>Last week the swimsuit designer was seen getting a COVID test with her daughter ahead of their international travels to make sure everything was copacetic before departing. </p>

<p>With the modeling industry slowly starting to ramp up again Alesandra will no doubt be back to work soon though she has been loving being at home with her family.</p>

<p>In the meantime she has found ways to get creative with her career and swimsuit line, as she has been modeling her latest designs from the comfort of her own home.  </p>
