<p>One officer wearing a blue coat pointed a taser at the suspect during the arrest, prompting the detained man to sit in an upright position and begin shouting at officers. </p>

<p> The officer pointing the taser gun, which appeared to have been discharged once already, demanded the suspect get back down on the ground, and said: 'Get down or you're going to re-energised, get back down!'</p>

<p>The suspect replied: 'I'll get tasered! I'll get tasered. So what?'</p>

<p>The video has gained over 14.9K views on Twitter as users lashed out at the officer for pointing a taser at the suspect even though he was already arrested.</p>
