<p>But Selena Gomez warned her fans on Monday not to underestimate the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old actress and singer stressed that 'COVID-19 is not fake news' in an Instagram post where she shared the newest trailer for the upcoming film, which features her newest song. </p>

<p>Safety first: Selena Gomez, 28, released the final trailer for her rom-com The Broken Hearts Gallery on Monday, while reminding fans to take coronavirus safety measures if they visit a theater; shown in January</p>

<p>Selena sounded excited as she reminded her 192 million followers that the romantic film would be coming to theaters on Friday, even though many theaters in the US remain closed due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>'<?php echo e('@'); ?>brokenheartsgallery finally comes out on Friday! I am excited to produce a film directed and written by a first time female filmmaker <?php echo e('@'); ?>nkrinsky [Natalie Krinsky],' she began her caption. </p>

<p>But she also reminded her fans that just because some of them can see it in a theater doesn't mean it's necessarily a safe choice. </p>

<p>'Although you can see this movie in some theaters, remember that COVID-19 is not fake news -so please follow safety guidelines in order to enjoy the movie experience with the lowest risk possible,' she wrote, before noting that the trailer features her new song Souvenir.</p>

<p>Mixed bag: Doctors interviewed by Vulture and The Playlist have been cautious about returning to theaters, and new filtration systems promised by AMC will only be installed in some theaters</p>

<p>In late August, Vulture spoke with Dr. Robert Lahita, the chairman of medicine at St. Joseph’s Health in New Jersey and a professor of medicine at New York Medical College, who raised concerns about the safety of theaters and urged any moviegoers not to eat or drink and not to remove their masks for any reason.</p>

<p>Although most major chains announced they would require masks after being publicly shamed, viewers will still be able to remove them for eating and drinking, which will leave them unprotected and allow them to potentially infect others. </p>

<p>A follow-up consultation with medical experts in The Playlist indicated that plans to install new air filtration systems in theaters from AMC and other major changes might leave many theaters behind.</p>
