<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>We are all travelling through a cloud of ancient radioactive debris left behind by supernova explosions, according to a team of researchers looking in the ocean. </p>

<p>By examining deep-sea sediments, experts from the Australian National University have been uncovering the mystery surrounding the space around our solar system.</p>

<p>The team examined sediment known to date back 33,000 years using a sensitive mass spectrometer and found traces of the isotope iron-60 formed when stars die.</p>

<p>For the last few thousand years the solar system has been moving through a denser cloud of gas and dust, and the team believe this is depositing iron-60 in our oceans. </p>

<p>While the isotope is radioactive and takes 15 million years to decay, it isn't dangerous to humans, according to the research team, as it is a very light dusting. </p>

<p>Professor Anton Wallner, who led the study,  said the age of the sediment suggests the isotopes left on Earth were produced from a supernova.</p>

<p>There is a cloud of dense dust the Solar System is passing through - called the Local Interstellar Cloud - made up of dust, gas and plasma.  </p>

<p>'These clouds could be remnants of previous supernova explosions, a powerful and super bright explosion of a star,' Professor Wallner said.   </p>

<p>If this cloud had originated during the past few million years from a supernova, it would contain iron-60, and so the team decided to search more recent sediment to find out.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was iron-60 in the sediment at extremely low levels - equating to radioactivity levels in space far below the Earth's natural background levels.</p>

<p>The distribution of the iron-60 matched earth's recent travel through the local interstellar cloud. </p>

<p>But the iron-60 extended further back and was spread throughout the entire 33,000 year measurement period. </p>

<p>Iron-60 is radioactive and completely decays away within 15 million years, which means any iron-60 found on the earth arrived here from nearby supernovae before settling on the ocean floor.</p>

<p>Professor Wallner previously found traces of iron-60 at about 2.6 million years ago, and possibly another at around 6 million years ago.</p>

<p>There is a cloud of dense dust the Solar System is passing through - called the Local Interstellar Cloud - made up of dust, gas and plasma and the solar system is passing through it</p>

<p>The lack of correlation with the solar system's time in the current local interstellar cloud seems to pose more questions than it answers, Wallner said.</p>

<p>Firstly, if the cloud was not formed by a supernova, where did it come from? And secondly, why is there iron-60 so evenly spread throughout space?</p>

<p>'There are recent papers that suggest iron-60 trapped in dust particles might bounce around in the interstellar medium,' Professor Wallner said.</p>

<p>'So the iron-60 could originate from even older supernovae explosions, and what we measure is some kind of echo. More data is required to resolve these details.' </p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal PNAS.</p>

<p>A supernova occurs when a star explodes, shooting debris and particles into space.</p>

<p>A supernova burns for only a short period of time, but it can tell scientists a lot about how the universe began.</p>

<p>One kind of supernova has shown scientists that we live in an expanding universe, one that is growing at an ever increasing rate.</p>

<p>Scientists have also determined that supernovas play a key role in distributing elements throughout the universe.</p>

<p>In 1987, astronomers spotted a ‘titanic supernova’ in a nearby galaxy blazing with the power of over 100 million suns (pictured)</p>

<p>There are two known types of supernova.</p>

<p>The first type occurs in binary star systems when one of the two stars, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, steals matter from its companion star.</p>

<p>Eventually, the white dwarf accumulates too much matter, causing the star to explode, resulting in a supernova.</p>

<p>The second type of supernova occurs at the end of a single star's lifetime.</p>

<p>As the star runs out of nuclear fuel, some of its mass flows into its core.</p>

<p>Eventually, the core is so heavy it can't stand its own gravitational force and the core collapses, resulting in another giant explosion. </p>

<p>Many elements found on Earth are made in the core of stars and these elements travel on to form new stars, planets and everything else in the universe.</p>
