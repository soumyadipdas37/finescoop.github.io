<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Callum Wilson is waiting for Bournemouth and Newcastle to agree a deal on his proposed move to St James’ Park, with Steve Bruce’s need for signings greater than ever after a 5-1 drubbing at Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>Newcastle’s pre-season is turning into a nightmare for the head coach with serious injuries to goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and striker Dwight Gayle followed by Tuesday’s heavy loss at Championship side Boro.</p>

<p>Magpies captain Jamaal Lascelles and home midfielder Lewis Wing were sent off following an off-the-ball altercation but they will avoid a suspension in the regular season, instead missing Monday’s rematch between the teams on Tyneside.</p>

<p>Callum Wilson has interest from several clubs but his preferred destination is Newcastle</p>

<p>Steve Bruce is keen to bring in fresh faces after his side lost 5-1 to Middlesbrough on Tuesday</p>

<p>By that point Bruce will be hoping to have 28-year-old Wilson on board, so desperate is he for strikers.</p>

<p>Sources close to Bournemouth say they are still waiting for an official approach from Newcastle, but expect that an offer is incoming.</p>

<p>A swap deal involving Matt Ritchie plus cash for Wilson has been mooted but insiders say Bournemouth, despite their relegation, will not be selling at a reduced rate, evidenced by the £41million it cost Manchester City to sign Nathan Ake and the £18.5m Sheffield United paid for Aaron Ramsdale.</p>

<p>Andy Carroll remains the only forward available to Bruce and it will be a concern that his side played the opening hour at Boro without a recognised frontman.</p>

<p>Bournemouth expect a bid for Wilson to come in soon but will not sell him on the cheap</p>

<p>Newcastle need a new striker with Andy Carroll (right ) currently their only fit front man</p>

<p>However, we understand Newcastle is Wilson’s preferred destination and sources are hopeful of movement in the next 48 hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have been told that Gayle has damaged his medial collateral ligaments and will see a specialist on Wednesday ahead of an operation and rehab period. Sources say he will be missing for anywhere between eight and 12 weeks following surgery.</p>

<p>Newcastle have also been in talks with former Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser, who is now a free agent.</p>
