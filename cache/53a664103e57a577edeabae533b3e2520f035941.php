<p>'Will they cease to exist?' Sunrise's Samantha Armytage has taken a swipe at the Kardashians after they revealed their hit series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, would be coming to an end after fourteen years</p>

<p>Speaking about the family's hugely popular E! reality show coming to an end, Natalie Barr admitted there was 'no update on exactly how much cash that family has made.'</p>

<p>Sam quipped in: 'Well, we could quickly do some maths.'</p>

<p>The outspoken broadcaster then cruelly queried if Kim Kardashian and her famous family members would 'cease to exist' without their television show - which first debuted in 2007.</p>

<p>Her comments left her co-host David Koch in a fit of hysterics, who joked that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would step into their reality television shoes for a show entitled, 'Keeping Up With The Windsors'.</p>

<p>Sam added: 'Isn't Ryan Seacrest one of the producers. I think he's probably just cut the contract. Probably just waning ratings.'</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Sam has taken a swipe at the Los Angeles based family. Back in 2016 she poked fun at Kim's famous derriere.  </p>

<p>The blonde TV personality shared a snap of her curves from side-on with the hashtag 'Samantha Kardashian'.</p>

<p>Just days later, Samantha found herself at war with Kim's younger sister, Khloe.     </p>

<p>Khloe was forced to defend herself after her appearance on the morning show Sunrise cut off amidst questions about her niece North West.</p>

<p>'We thought it was a technical glitch but turns out <?php echo e('@'); ?>KhloEkardashian's people pulled the plug after <?php echo e('@'); ?>Sam_armytage asked about baby North,' Sunrise tweeted.</p>

<p>Shock announcement: On Tuesday evening, Kim announced that her family's iconic reality show was over after 14 years on air</p>

<p>Khloe fired back accusing the morning show of trying to create a story out of nothing.</p>

<p>'Why would I cut an interview short because of North? Get over yourself Sunrise... The call dropped... stop reaching for a story,' she tweeted.</p>

<p>'You are so f***ing desperate!'</p>

<p>However, Sunrise executive producer Michael Pell told the MailOnline at the time that Khloe's people did pull the plug on the interview and said her local rep had apologised.</p>

<p>Host David fired back and called Khloe an 'idiot' later in the program.</p>

<p>'[My daughter] Brie's going to be very angry with me criticising Khloe, but she's an idiot,' he said. 'I'm sorry… I'm sorry to do that.'</p>
