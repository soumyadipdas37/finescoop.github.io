<p>Interview: Former MKR judge Pete Evans (pictured) is preparing to sit down for a tell-all interview to discuss his 'beliefs, the controversy and his career'</p>

<p>Evans has been involved in a string of controversies since being sacked by Seven earlier this year.</p>

<p>In July, he claimed that COVID-19 was a 'f**king hoax' and that the pandemic 'doesn't compare to what is happening in the world on a large scale'.</p>

<p>Among his false claims about the pandemic, he has previously declared he's immune to coronavirus and blamed the health crisis on 5G technology.</p>

<p>Live: The interview with the anti-vaxxer and conspiracy theorist will stream live on Facebook, Youtube and Twitter on Monday at 1pm</p>

<p>He recently endorsed conspiracy theorist David Icke, a Holocaust denier who was denied entry to Australia last year after protests from the Jewish community. </p>

<p>It is not suggested that Evans endorses the views of Icke relating specifically to Holocaust denial or the Jewish people. He instead supports Icke's views on globalist conspiracy theories and media manipulation.</p>

<p>In recent years, Evans also has claimed the Paleo diet can prevent autism, that camel milk can supplement breastfeeding and osteoporosis suffers shouldn't eat dairy.</p>

<p>Divisive: Evans has been involved in a string of controversies since being sacked by Seven earlier this year for his extreme views. In July, he claimed that COVID-19 was a 'f**king hoax' and that the pandemic 'doesn't compare to what is happening in the world on a large scale' </p>

<p>October 2014: Evans claims the Paleo diet can prevent autism</p>

<p>March 2015: His book is pulled from shelves due to its bone broth recipe for infants</p>

<p>July 2016: Evans claims vegan women should eat meat during pregnancy, advises against wearing 'normal' sunscreen, and claims Wi-Fi is 'dangerous'</p>

<p>August 2016: He says osteoporosis suffers shouldn't eat dairy</p>

<p>September 2016: Evans claims camel milk could supplement breastfeeding</p>

<p>April 2017: Evans campaigns against the 'mass fluoridation of public water'</p>

<p>December 2018: Evans reveals he looks directly into the sun</p>

<p>April 2020: Evans' ketogenic recipe book is slammed by health professionals and he is fined for promoting his 'healing lamp'</p>

<p>Evans' central belief is 'food is medicine' and that by following a Paleo diet, people can develop superhuman immune systems that can withstand all illnesses, including COVID-19.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no scientific basis for this. Following a particular diet does not make a person any less likely to contract the deadly respiratory virus.</p>

<p>Pete is now also planning to open his Evolve Health Labs clinic in Byron Bay. </p>

<p>Not true: Evans' central belief is that 'food is medicine' and that by following a Paleo diet, people can develop superhuman immune systems that can withstand all illnesses, including COVID-19. There is absolutely no scientific basis for this. Following a particular diet does not make a person any less likely to contract coronavirus</p>
