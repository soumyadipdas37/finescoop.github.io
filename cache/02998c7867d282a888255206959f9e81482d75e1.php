<p>'Once we saw how dire the situation was, we knew we had to postpone,' she said. 'It was a no-brainer for us. Aside from the obvious travel and crowd restrictions, it didn't feel right to be celebrating in such a big way when there was so much going on in the world.</p>

<p>'It would have been in poor taste to burden people by asking them to risk their lives to come to our wedding. There were more important things to focus on. Our wedding could wait.'Â </p>

<p>'The virus really put things into perspective. That being said, we did want to get married as long as it could be done in a safe and intimate setting with a group that we trusted.'Â Â </p>

<p>The ceremony was planned in one month and Elizabeth's father served as their officiant.</p>

<p>'It has been such a long road for us, and at times [it] felt like a total impossibility that it was hard to believe we'd actually gotten to that moment where it was really happening,' Gillies said.Â </p>

<p>'Once we were exchanging vows, it hit me that my dad was marrying us and our loved ones were there, and I think I turned to Michael and mouthed, "Oh, my God, we actually did it." We were so happy.'Â Â </p>
