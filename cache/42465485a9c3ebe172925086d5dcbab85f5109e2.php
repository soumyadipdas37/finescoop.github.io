<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump on Wednesday called for the firing of MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid for her ‘xenophobia and racism’ after she angered many by comparing radicalized supporters of the president to ‘the way Muslims act.’</p>

<p>‘Like Fredo at Fake News CNN, the very untalented Joy Reid should be fired for this horrible use of the words “Muslim Terrorists”.’</p>

<p>The president continued: ‘Such xenophobia and racism on MSDNC. Anyone else would be gone, and fast!!!’</p>

<p>‘MSDNC’ is commonly used to denigrate the left-leaning cable network MSNBC as a propaganda tool of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The acronym DNC stands for Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p>Donald Trump (left) on Wednesday's called for the firing of Joy Reid (right) after the MSNBC host was accused of Islamophobia when she compared the president's supporters to 'the way Muslims act' during her nightly newscast on Monday</p>

<p>‘Like Fredo at Fake News CNN, the very untalented Joy Reid should be fired for this horrible use of the words “Muslim Terrorists”.’ The president continued: ‘Such xenophobia and racism on MSDNC. Anyone else would be gone, and fast!!!’</p>

<p>House Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat who represents the fifth congressional district in Minnesota and is a Muslim woman who immigrated from Somalia, refused to accept the president's 'fascist solidarity'</p>

<p>Trump’s tweet about ‘Fredo’ is a reference to Chris Cuomo, the CNN prime time host and brother of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat.</p>

<p>Fredo is a derogatory nickname taken from the Godfather movies in which a family-run crime organization employs a dim-witted, incompetent brother named Fredo Corleone.</p>

<p>Chris Cuomo has been caught in secret recordings, lamenting and denying apparent rampant rumors of sexual misconduct in a phone conversation with President Donald Trump's disgraced former attorney Michael Cohen.</p>

<p>The tapes were revealed on Tuesday by Fox News host Tucker Carlson. They have prompted calls for Chris Cuomo’s dismissal.</p>

<p>Reid was been accused of Islamophobia after her comments on Monday, which were made during her new 7pm show, ReidOut, as she discussed the murder charges against Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha and political violence in Portland.</p>

<p>'When leaders, let's say in the Muslim world, talk a lot of violent talk and encourage their supporters to be willing to commit violence including on their own bodies in order to win against whoever they decide is the enemy, we in the U.S. media describe that as they are 'radicalizing' these people, particularly when they're radicalizing young people,' Reid said.</p>

<p>'That's how we talk about the way Muslims act,' she added. 'When you see what Donald Trump is doing, is that any different from what we describe as radicalizing people?' </p>

<p>Omar (above), a Minnesota Democrat, led the criticism against Reid, saying in a tweet: 'Honestly, this kinda of casual Islamophobia is hurtful and dangerous'</p>

<p>Omar condemned Reid's 'casual Islamophobia' and asked for an apology from the MSNBC host</p>

<p>Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, led the criticism against Reid, saying in a tweet: 'Honestly, this kinda of casual Islamophobia is hurtful and dangerous.' </p>

<p>'We deserve better and an apology for the painful moment for so many Muslims around our country should be forthcoming,' Omar added.</p>

<p>Omar also did not take too kindly to Trump's calls for Reid's dismissal.</p>

<p>In a direct response to Trump's tweet about firing Reid, the Minnesota congresswoman tweeted: 'Joy was right about one thing- you are radicalizing and inciting violence and must be condemned for it. </p>

<p>'Don’t use Muslim pain to attack the talent of a strong Black woman, who has vigorously held you and your administration accountable. </p>

<p>'We reject your fascist solidarity.' </p>

<p>Reid did not address the controversy on her show on Tuesday, but wrote in a tweet on Tuesday night: 'There’s been some thoughtful commentary but also some willful distortion of the points I tried to make yesterday. We’ll discuss in more depth tomorrow on the show!' </p>

<p>Reid's remarks drew swift backlash. Zakir Khan, board chair of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Oregon, said in a tweet that the comments were 'so unbelievably Islamophobic it's ridiculous.'</p>

<p>Khan asked whether Reid planned to apologize for the way she 'stereotype[d] an entire group of Muslims.'</p>

<p>In her remarks, Reid referred to Trump liking a tweet praising Rittenhouse, who is charged with murder after fatally shooting two people during a violent confrontation in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Trump went further at a press conference on Monday, telling DailyMail.com that the 17-year-old Rittenhouse 'probably would have been killed' if he had not opened fire.</p>

<p>Rittenhouse's attorney has said that the teen clearly acted in self-defense while he was being attacked by a violent mob.</p>

<p>Reid also referenced a video of a Trump supporter appearing to fire a paintball gun at Black Lives Matter protesters in Portland, Oregon on Friday. </p>

<p>Later the same day, a Trump supporter in Portland was fatally shot in the back of the head in an apparent act of political violence. Police are reportedly investigating a self-confessed member of Antifa for the killing.</p>

<p>Reid, 51, in July took over MSNBC's 7pm time slot from 'Hardball with Chris Matthews' after the host was forced to resign in March over allegations of sexist workplace behavior and several on-air missteps.  </p>

<p>Reid's ratings have dropped precipitously since her launch week in July, according to Nielsen data reviewed by DailyMail.com. Above, she is pictured at the 2019 Global Citizen Festival</p>

<p>After MSNBC touted Reid's ratings for the first week of her show, which launched on July 20, the show's viewership has dropped off precipitously, according to Nielsen data reviewed by DailyMail.com. </p>

<p>For the week ending August 28, Reid was down in 16 percent in total viewers and 7 percent in the prized 25-54 age demographic, compared to her launch week. </p>

<p>Monday's remarks were not the first time Reid has come under criticism for alleged anti-Muslim comments.</p>

<p>In 2018, anti-gay remarks were found on her old blog from posts in 2006, which she blamed on hackers at the time.</p>

<p>Other 2006 blog posts then came to light, including one that stated 'current iterations of Islam are largely incompatible with Western notions of free speech and expression, and thus, I'd say, with the Bushian dream of Western style democracy for all.' </p>
