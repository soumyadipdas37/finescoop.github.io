<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Life is fragile. So is beauty. So are buildings, monuments, places that move us. </p>

<p>A careless spark – or in the case of a Grade I-listed Elizabethan country house in the West Country that burnt down a few years ago, an unluckily positioned shaving mirror that concentrated the rays of a low November sun onto a curtain – and whoosh, that's it. Gone overnight.</p>

<p>I began this book after the fire at Notre-Dame in Paris in 2019 and I completed it during lockdown, when places that resonate so strongly, giving solace and inspiration to visitors, were off limits. </p>

<p>Some I saw from the outside like Westminster Abbey and the Banqueting House in London. </p>

<p>The continuity that these monuments represent gives comfort; they are old friends, reliably present and unaffected by pandemics.  These buildings and places survived other crises: they will survive this one.Life brings with it other risks than fire and disease. </p>

<p>Coasts erode, rivers dry up, quiet places become crowded, and so it is all the more important to value what we have. To bring to mind their special qualities and bang the drum. </p>

<p>Fire officers advise householders to keep a grab-bag of essentials that can be seized by the family as it flees a burning building. </p>

<p>I have applied the same principle to England. What are the places that we most cherish, that express qualities that are specially English? </p>

<p>What is it that we would like to save at all costs from a general conflagration? What would enable us to rebuild England if all else went up in smoke? </p>

<p>With only 100 entries, I stuck to England but I have included here a taste of the places I would have included from the rest of the UK.</p>

<p>We have much that is worth transmitting to future generations. So let us pause for a moment to remember what we have and who we are. Beauty remains, and we can all enjoy it.</p>

<p>CHARLES I STATUE, LONDON</p>

<p>The statue of King Charles I sits at the bottom of Trafalgar Square in London. However, it was commissioned for the garden of the Lord Treasurer Sir Richard Weston</p>

<p>At the bottom of Trafalgar Square is a statue of a man on a horse. The scale is small, the modelling too delicate for the position it occupies, in the middle of a busy urban space. </p>

<p>That's because it was commissioned for the garden of the Lord Treasurer Sir Richard Weston. </p>

<p>After the Civil War, Parliament ordered it to be sold to the brazier John Rivett, on the strict instruction that it be broken up. </p>

<p>Out of loyalty, Rivett buried it, while keeping up a hammering noise in his workshop to pretend it was being destroyed. </p>

<p>He then sold cutlery with bronze handles supposedly made from the statue. </p>

<p>It was eventually sold to Charles II in 1675 and now looks proudly down Whitehall, the king's eyes resting on the Banqueting House, in front of which he was executed.</p>

<p>THE BOWTHORPE OAK, LINCOLNSHIRE</p>

<p>Nowhere has so many awe-inspiring ancient oaks as England. The interior of the Bowthorpe Oak, in Lincolnshire was used as a dining room in the 18th century</p>

<p>Nowhere has so many awe-inspiring ancient oaks as England. The interior of the Bowthorpe Oak was used as a dining room in the 18th century.</p>

<p>They have been blasted by lightning, or the heartwood has softened and decayed, so it is not possible to count the annual growth rings, and carbon-dating only works on dead matter – our oaks still live. But some are more than 500 years old. </p>

<p>They are gouty and shrunken from what they used to be, inordinately fat.</p>

<p> A dense green canopy has been reduced to a scattering of leaves, but the indignities of age are borne nobly.</p>

<p>KING'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE</p>

<p>The heart rises at the sight of King's College Chapel in Cambridge. Inside, its fan vault (pictured) is the largest in the country, and the world</p>

<p>Cambridge can be a cold city, but as one battles along King's Parade in the teeth of a gale, the heart rises at the sight of King's College Chapel, with its soaring pinnacles and immense windows. </p>

<p>Inside, its fan vault (pictured) is the largest in the country, and the world, since this gravity-defying feature of late Gothic – and the whole Perpendicular style – period was peculiar to England. </p>

<p>Fan vaults are formed of interlocking cones made of sheets of stone; and are an English phenomenon. </p>

<p>Visitors feel as though they are standing in a forest of stone trees whose branches meet overhead.</p>

<p>BATTLE ABBEY</p>

<p>Battle Abbey, in East Sussex, was built by the Normans after they successfully invaded and ruled over England</p>

<p>Williamthe Conqueror said the Abbey was built to fulfil a vow he made to God before the battle, but also perhaps to populate a part of England which had recently proven vulnerable to attack</p>

<p>The Battle of Hastings is the English foundation myth. </p>

<p>The Normans overthrew the Anglo-Saxons then imposed a new legal system, a centralised monarchy and a structure of feudal obligations. </p>

<p>Battle Abbey is William the Conqueror's offering of thanks for having got away with it. </p>

<p>The high altar of Battle Abbey was sited on the spot King Harold died – maybe, as the Bayeux Tapestry seems to suggest, from an arrow in the eye.</p>

<p>William said the Abbey was built to fulfil a vow he made to God before the battle, but also perhaps to populate a part of England which had recently proven vulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>PROSPECT COTTAGE, DUNGENESS</p>

<p>Prospect Cottage, in Dungeness, boasts a picturesque garden which was started  by the film director Derek Jarman in 1986</p>

<p>If you can garden on the shingle of Dungeness, you can garden anywhere – and the English do. </p>

<p>Prospect Cottage stands for all the horticultural Edens in bloom across these fair lands.</p>

<p>With pylons striding out from the Dungeness B nuclear power plant, this is not a promising locale but in 1986, the film director Derek Jarman started a garden here. </p>

<p>It is not only an example of horticultural tenacity, but a triumph of the human spirit; he was diagnosed as HIV positive the same year. </p>

<p>There are no visible boundaries; it stretches for as long as he wanted it to, towards the horizon. </p>

<p>Wild flowers, traditional garden plants and exotics are combined to create a natural effect, which can only be achieved through constant weeding, nurture and hope.</p>

<p>THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER</p>

<p>Our most cherished landmarks are the stars of a glorious new book by Clive Aslet. Pictured, the White Cliffs of Dover</p>

<p>The White Cliffs stand for England and the English. </p>

<p>They're our mental bulwark against invasion, a natural landmark overlooking our busiest port – which for aeons made them the last thing people saw as they left our shores and the first thing to be spotted when they returned. </p>

<p>When Julius Caesar arrived in 55BC, he avoided landing under the White Cliffs, lined with fierce tribesmen (he touched land a few miles east). </p>

<p>There are no tribesmen today, but the cliffs retain their significance. </p>

<p>HOLKHAM HALL, NORFOLK</p>

<p>Holkham Hall, on the north Norfolk coast, is less country house and more palace</p>

<p>Holkham Hall, on the north Norfolk coast, is less country house and more palace.</p>

<p> Faced in yellow brick, Holkham takes the form of a central block, surrounded at each of the corners by pavilions. </p>

<p>It is not an entirely happy composition, but there are wonders inside. It has a hall built out of marble (or to be exact, alabaster). </p>

<p>This grand space, known as The Marble Hall (pictured), is entered at a level lower than the colonnade, which soars above the visitor's head. </p>

<p>Overhead curves a coffered ceiling. Even today – and however often you see it – the effect is sensational. </p>

<p>This is an imperial space, immense and imposing – but also flamboyant and festive.</p>

<p>CERNE ABBAS GIANT</p>

<p>The Cerne Giant is a mystery, and peculiarly English. White figures, scoured into the chalk hillsides of the Downs, are found nowhere else in Europe</p>

<p>A club-wielding giant strides across the hillside in Dorset. </p>

<p>He is nearly 55 metres tall, and as for his prodigious manhood... suffice it to say that he is a figure of formidable vigour in every respect. </p>

<p>The Cerne Giant is a mystery, and peculiarly English. White figures, scoured into the chalk hillsides of the Downs, are found nowhere else in Europe. </p>

<p>Their purpose is unknown. During the prudish Victorian era, the Giant's phallus was erased by filling in the trenches, but in 1908 he was restored, though in the process his member was accidentally extended up to his navel. </p>

<p>My theory is that his club is a cricket bat, for he looks over one of the loveliest village cricket grounds I've seen.</p>

<p>LUDLOW</p>

<p>There are times when England gets it almost completely right. One of them is Ludlow, a town that grew up around its hilltop castle, above the serenity of the River Teme. Ludlow is not stuck in a time warp</p>

<p>There are times when England gets it almost completely right. </p>

<p>One of them is Ludlow, a town that grew up around its hilltop castle, above the serenity of the River Teme. Ludlow is not stuck in a time warp. </p>

<p>It has internet cafés as well as antiques shops, Tesco (reluctantly) as well as specialist butchers' shops. </p>

<p>But Ludlow's essential character has not changed and it has infinitely better food now – with its famous Food Festival, started in 1995, and its market days. Ludlow feels buoyant. </p>

<p>So what is the reason for its good fortune?</p>

<p>The beauty of the place. </p>

<p>Today, people can increasingly live where they want to and choose a high quality of life. I said England can get some things almost completely right. Delete the 'almost'.</p>

<p>SWALEDALE, YORKSHIRE</p>

<p>Swaledale, in Yorkshire, still magically exemplifies a quality that we especially prize because it is now scarce. Seclusion</p>

<p>I love Swaledale and only hesitate to make it a Crown Jewel because there are so many other distinctive landscapes in England. </p>

<p>The loss of any of them would be mourned. Swaledale still magically exemplifies a quality that we especially prize because it is now scarce. Seclusion. </p>

<p>The sense of being alone in an unchanging world. The name Swale means 'wild one', but the feature that gives this landscape much of its character – the many miles of stone walls – shows that it has been tamed and worked for centuries. </p>

<p>The straight walls seem to tie the hillsides down like the string on a rolled joint of meat. </p>

<p>Their purpose was to create fields in which to keep cattle – they are not nimble beasts and cannot jump much of a wall.</p>

<p>CONISTON WATER</p>

<p>Everyone knows that the Lake District is the most beautiful area of Britain. The secret is so well and truly out that parts of it can become a little crowded. But Coniston Water is apt to be overlooked and preserves its beauty much as it was in the 19th century</p>

<p>Everyone knows that the Lake District is the most beautiful area of Britain. The secret is so well and truly out that parts of it can become a little crowded. </p>

<p>But Coniston Water is apt to be overlooked and preserves its beauty much as it was in the 19th century. </p>

<p>The best view of it is from Brantwood. This is the house that the aesthete, writer, watercolourist and social reformer John Ruskin created, specifically with that view in mind. </p>

<p>Ruskin had grown up in south London, in an atmosphere so claustrophobic that the arrival of the water cart, which he could see being filled from his nursery window, provided one of his few excitements as a small child; the Lake District, which he first visited with his parents, on trips to promote his father's sherry business, was a revelation. </p>

<p>Later he valued it as the antidote to all the ugliness that England was inflicting on itself with the Industrial Revolution. </p>

<p>He battled for beauty. We have him, as much as anyone, to thank that, while much has been lost, much also survives.</p>

<p>THE GIANT'S CAUSEWAY, COUNTY ANTRIM, NORTHERN IRELAND</p>

<p>The stupendous landscape of the Giant's Causeway, with its polygonal columns, was formed after a convulsion of the earth's core 60 million years ago. Situated in Country Antrim, Northern Ireland, they are one of the wonders of Britain</p>

<p>The stupendous landscape of the Giant's Causeway, with its polygonal columns, was formed after a convulsion of the earth's core 60 million years ago. </p>

<p>The heaving and tearing of tectonic plates has brought them to rest in County Antrim, where they are one of the wonders of Britain. </p>

<p>Each of the columns – there are reckoned to be 40,000 – appears to have been beautifully cut and polished, so that it fits exactly into the gap left by its neighbours.</p>

<p>SKARA BRAE, ORKNEY</p>

<p>When a great storm swept across Orkney in the 19th century, it tore the blanket of soil and sand from the remains of Skara Brae, a kind of Stone Age village</p>

<p>When a great storm swept across Orkney in the 19th century, it tore the blanket of soil and sand from the remains of Skara Brae, a kind of Stone Age village. </p>

<p>Built around 5,000 years ago, the earliest huts – made from stone on the windswept, treeless island – predate the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge. </p>

<p>You can still see stone boxes that were used to soak limpets for fishing bait, and it seems the huts had indoor lavatories millennia before the rest of Britain.</p>

<p>THE RIVER USK </p>

<p>The Welsh Marches are some of the most beautiful border lands in Britain. Those who live around the neighbouring River Usk talk of Uskany</p>

<p>The Welsh Marches are some of the most beautiful border lands in Britain.</p>

<p>Those who live around the neighbouring River Usk talk of Uskany. It is a good coinage. </p>

<p>The Welsh Marches are more lush than Tuscany, though the sun is more shy about coming out from behind the clouds and they don't make wine. </p>

<p>But the beauty is of a similar order; in the golden light of a summer afternoon, it is as idyllic as the Italian landscapes painted by Claude Lorrain. </p>
