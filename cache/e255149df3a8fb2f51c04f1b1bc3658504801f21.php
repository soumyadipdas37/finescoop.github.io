<p>But the Met office has warned sun-seekers to not get too used to the heat as temperatures are expected to drop by next week. </p>

<p>Met Office forecasters say Saturday and Sunday is likely to be warm and sunny for much of the UK, before conditions turn more unsettled from Tuesday.  </p>

<p>Scotland can expect odd spots of rain before sunnier, warmer spells on Saturday while the rest of the UK will be generally sunny and warm.  </p>

<p>There could be showers early on Sunday morning, Met Office forecasters warn, with early mist and fog before a generally dry and sunny day.  </p>

<p>The picture will become more unsettled from the northwest on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Met Office forecaster Oli Claydon told MailOnline warmer air from continental Europe will bring highs of up to 25C by Sunday. </p>

<p>He said: 'Today will see bright sunny start, with the exception of the far north of Scotland, and highs of 21C. </p>

<p>'We'll have a bright start tomorrow, but could see some cloud and rain nudging across the south coast. Elsewhere temperatures will be stable across UK, with highs tomorrow of 23C in the south east. </p>

<p>'On Sunday there is likely to be some cloud in the north of England, Northern Ireland and Scotland in the morning. The south could see sunshine and showers, with the chance of heavy showers. Wales and the central part of the country will see the best of the sunshine, remaining dry. There'll be highs of 25C in the south east, and similar again on Monday.'</p>

<p>At the beginning of next week a cold front will be moving in and sweeping southeastwards, bringing heavy wind and rain, and blustery showers. The Met Office says it will be progressively unsettled through the week with temperatures dropping to around 18C by Wednesday. </p>

<p>On Monday and Tuesday Britons flocked to beaches and parks across the country to enjoy the hot spell which brought with it temperatures of up to 30C (86F). </p>

<p>The sunny weather came as the government's new 'rule of six' on social gatherings was put into motion this week.</p>

<p>While many Brits appeared to be following the guidelines, others were pictured clearly flouting the new rules - an offence that can lead to a £100 fine.   </p>
