<p>Join us again tomorrow morning for the latest transfer news and gossip.</p>

<p>Leeds have announced the signing of Diego Llorente from Real Sociedad.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old defender has joined for an undisclosed fee and signed a four-year deal at Elland Road.</p>

<p>Slaven Bilic's pleas to West Brom to secure another loan spell for Filip Krovinovic could be set to pay off after a significant breakthrough in talks with Benfica.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old Croatian midfielder impressed during last season's loan stint to help the Baggies return to the Premier League as Championship runners-up. </p>

<p>Aston Villa striker Mbwana Samatta is in Turkey to negotiate a proposed move to Fenerbahce.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old only joined in January for £8.5million from Genk but has failed to have the desired impact as Villa struggled and flirted with relegation. He has scored twice in 16 appearances.</p>

<p>Arsenal are showing interest in Chelsea midfielder Jorginho as their search for midfield reinforcements continues.</p>

<p>The Gunners identified Lyon's Houssem Aouar and Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey as their main targets for the summer window, but they are yet to make any kind of breakthrough with either.</p>

<p>It was announced on Wednesday night that Barcelona and Atletico Madrid had agreed a deal which would see the Catalan club receive £5.5million (€6m).</p>

<p>Premier League clubs are almost half a billion pounds down in transfer revenue this year with under a fortnight to go until the window closes, partly because players are reluctant to move due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>The economic uncertainty across Europe is the chief reason for top-flight clubs so far recouping around £209million from straight player sales compared to £650m last year.</p>

<p>PSG are on the brink of pulling out of talks over taking Dele Alli on loan from Tottenham. </p>

<p>Aston Villa are interested in a potential loan deal for Chelsea's Ross Barkley or team-mate Ruben Loftus Cheek as they look to strengthen their midfield.</p>

<p>Villa had asked about Tammy Abraham earlier in the window but he didn't want to leave Stamford Bridge</p>

<p>Angel di Maria has revealed he contacted Lionel Messi on Instagram in a bid to lure him to Paris Saint-Germain in the midst of the Barcelona star's transfer stand-off with the Spanish club.</p>

<p>Last month, the 33-year-old announced intentions to leave Catalonia after almost two decades with the club, attempting to walk away from the Nou Camp for free as a result of a clause in his contract. </p>

<p>Andy Cole has boldly stated that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has to be a 'very good salesman' in the transfer market to convince star players to join Manchester United over rivals Liverpool and Manchester City. </p>

<p>Premier League champions Liverpool signed Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota last week, while City have bought Ferran Torres and Nathan Ake - United's only significant summer purchase has been Donny van de Beek for £40m.</p>

<p>Atletico Madrid have turned down a £78million bid from Manchester City for defender Jose Gimenez, the Spanish club's president Enrique Cerezo has revealed.</p>

<p>The Premier League club have been unable to suitably replace Vincent Kompany after he rejoined Anderlecht in 2019, with manager Pep Guardiola searching for a new recruit to partner Aymeric Laporte in the heart of defence.</p>

<p>A furious Luis Suarez 'threatened to publish emails listing the clubs he was forbidden from joining' before Barcelona finally agreed to his Atletico Madrid move.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan striker is poised to join Atletico for £5.5million after the two clubs thrashed out an agreement on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>David Sullivan has warned West Ham may end the transfer window without any new additions.</p>

<p>Co-owner Sullivan delivered a downbeat update on the club's prospects of bringing in fresh faces before next month's deadline and about their lack of funds for this window.</p>

<p>Barcelona have emerged as one of the frontrunners to sign out-of-favour Chelsea centre back Antonio Rudiger.</p>

<p>The German international has been left out of Frank Lampard's last two matchday squads, including the 6-0 victory against Barnsley on Wednesday night when Thiago Silva made his debut for the club.</p>

<p>Fulham will complete the £13.7million signing of Brazilian centre back Marlon Santos from Sassuolo pending his medical.</p>

<p>As Sportsmail reported on Monday, Barcelona had a buy back option for the 25-year old but declined to take it up paving the way for Fulham to conclude a deal.</p>

<p>Tottenham have held talks over a deal for Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar, 25, but remain some way apart on valuation with the Italians asking for £52m.</p>

<p>Technical director Steve Hitchen was in Milan in Wednesday for talks with Skriniar’s representatives.</p>

<p>Manchester City defender Nicolas Otamendi is attracting interest from Porto and Inter Milan.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old could yet be pushed into negotiations with Sevilla for Jules Kounde though the Spanish would prefer a straight cash deal of around £65million for the 21-year-old.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard believes the club's £22million move for Rennes' goalkeeper Edouard Mendy is on the verge of completion.</p>

<p>The Chelsea boss has been trying to bring in a new shot-stopper all summer and looks to finally have his man.</p>

<p>Manchester United are trying to drive down Porto's £17million price for left back Alex Telles.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old is out of contract next summer and the clubs remain apart in valuation. United are awaiting a revised bid from Roma for defender Chris Smalling who has made it clear he wishes to leave. United rejected the last offer of around £12m.</p>
