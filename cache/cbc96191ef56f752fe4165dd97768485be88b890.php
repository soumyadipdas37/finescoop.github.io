<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Embarrassing photos have surfaced just hours before The Bachelor finale of contestant Bella Varelis in a compromising position with another man.</p>

<p>Locky Gilbert will choose between marketing consultant Bella, 25, and recovery nurse Irena Srbinovska, 31, during Thursday's nerve-wracking last episode.</p>

<p>But paparazzi pictures have emerged that prove the brunette spent the night with former Bachelorette star Nathan Favro over the weekend.</p>

<p>Busted! The Bachelor's finalist Bella Varelis (left) spent the night with former Bachelorette star Nathan Favro (right) on Saturday in photos that all but confirm she doesn't win Locky Gilbert's heart</p>

<p>One of Bella's neighbours in Sydney spotted Nathan's Toyota HiLux parked outside her home at about 8pm on Saturday night.</p>

<p>The vehicle was just across the street from Bella's Mini.</p>

<p>The following morning, at about 9:45am, a nervous-looking Nathan, 25, was pictured leaving the apartment and driving away. </p>

<p>Bella stepped out an hour later, shortly before 11am, with her flatmate Bec Cvilikas, who was eliminated from The Bachelor on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>While these photos aren't irrefutable proof that Bella and Nathan are dating - they could be just friends or he could be seeing Bec - they leave little doubt that Bella doesn't win Locky's heart.</p>

<p>No Bachelor winner would be this indiscreet in the lead-up to the season finale, so it can be safely assumed she isn't dating the 31-year-old Survivor star.</p>

<p>Bella had previously been spotted getting flirty with artist Nathan, 25, at the beach in Point Piper, Sydney, last Monday.</p>

<p>She told Daily Mail Australia at the time they were just friends and had been 'for years'.</p>

<p>'It's purely platonic,' she added. 'I've been pretty hurt by the online hate I've been getting and he's been one of the many friends who has been there for me recently.'</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment on the latest photos.</p>

<p>While Nathan has not commented on their rumoured relationship, he did defend Bella earlier this month after she was targeted by trolls.</p>

<p>Speaking to gossip website The Wash recently, he said that his friend's portrayal on The Bachelor as a needy and territorial 'villain' was unfair.</p>

<p>'Bella is under contract so she can't say anything publicly. But I have been her mate for years and I know that what you are seeing on TV is not what would have happened,' he said.</p>

<p>'I have had a bad edit myself [on The Bachelorette] and I feel awful for her. Bella is such a sweetheart... She has been stitched up.</p>

<p>'She is upset by the sudden turn. I was there for her when this all happened [after filming] and now as it's playing out on TV.</p>

<p>'Just remember she is a real person with real feelings and be kind.'</p>

<p>Fans of The Bachelor franchise will remember party boy Nathan from Ali Oetjen's season of The Bachelorette in 2018.</p>

<p>He was infamously kicked off the show after Ali, 34, accused him of spreading rumours in the mansion about her sexual history.</p>

<p>He later denied starting gossip, telling Now To Love: 'We were all sitting around the pool and the topic of the rumours was brought up.</p>

<p>'A few of the boys had said what they had heard and I basically just said what I had heard.'</p>

<p>According to Sportsbet, Irena Srbinovska is the favourite to win The Bachelor with odds of $1.50 as of Thursday morning.</p>

<p>By contrast, Bella has longer odds of $2.40.</p>
