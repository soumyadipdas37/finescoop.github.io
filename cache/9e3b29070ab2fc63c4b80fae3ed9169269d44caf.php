<p>Arsenal are showing interest in Chelsea midfielder Jorginho as they search for midfielders</p>

<p>The Gunners identified Lyon's Houssem Aouar and Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey as targets</p>

<p>The Arsenal boss was part of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City set-up when they wanted to sign the Italian from Napoli back in 2018.</p>

<p>However, Jorginho opted to follow his manager Maurizio Sarri to Chelsea instead and remains in their midfield options under Frank Lampard.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old has started both Premier League matches this season for Chelsea, but has tough competition for places with N'Golo Kante, Matteo Kovacic and Billy Gilmour all specialising in the deeper lying role.</p>

<p>Arteta was part of Manchester City's set-up when they almost signed Jorginho in 2018</p>

<p>Arsenal's current midfield options are slightly less strong than their London rivals, with the likes of Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi falling out of favour under Arteta's reign.</p>

<p>Chelsea's No 5 joined from the Serie A side in the summer of 2018 for £50million, plus a potential £7million in add ons.</p>

<p>He has made 100 appearances for Chelsea, scoring ten goals as the sides designated penalty taker. </p>
