<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Novak Djokovic returned to the court for the first time since defaulting at the US Open for accidentally hitting a line judge with the ball as he won at the Italian Open in Rome.</p>

<p>The world No 1's bid for an 18th Grand Slam title ended in controversy after he swiped a stray ball that struck Laura Clark and resulted in his disqualification at the fourth round stage.</p>

<p>But the Serbian started his clay court season with a convincing 6-3 6-2 victory over wildcard Salvatore Caruso in the Italian capital.</p>

<p>Djokovic returned to action for the first time since his US Open default at the Italian Open</p>

<p>There wasn't too much to test the Serbian's patience as he coasted through to the last-16</p>

<p>Djokovic makes his point during the contest but there was little reason to get upset</p>

<p>It was the dropping of serve to Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta that sparked Djokovic's temper to erupt in New York but that wasn't a problem here.</p>

<p>Djokovic didn't face a single break point against the unseeded Caruso as he coasted through to the last-16, where either compatriot Filip Krajinovic or Italian Marco Cecchinato await.</p>

<p>'Obviously I had an early exit [at the US Open] so had more time to prepare,' Djokovic said afterwards.</p>

<p>'I did practice for a week now and tried to play some sets coming into this ATP 1000 match. Carruso is a clay court specialist and it was a great challenge today.'</p>

<p>Having received a first round bye earlier in the week, it was Djokovic's words that stole the headlines in Rome as he admitted his sometimes volcanic on-court nature could well get him into trouble again.</p>

<p>Djokovic overcame the challenge of wildcard Salvatore Caruso in the second round in Rome</p>

<p>The match was played out before empty stands at the Foro Italico amid the Covid-19 pandemic</p>

<p>'I understand I have outbursts and this is the personality and the player that I have always been,' said the 33-year-old.</p>

<p>'I cannot promise or guarantee I will never ever do anything similar to that in my life. I am definitely willing to try my best so that something like that never happens again.'</p>

<p>Fortunately there weren't too many opportunities for that temper to be tested against Caruso, especially after four-time Rome champion Djokovic broke serve in the eighth game before sealing the set.</p>

<p>And the contest was as good as over when Caruso dropped his serve in a see-saw third game of the second set which lasted nearly 12 minutes.</p>

<p>Djokovic was booted out of the US Open for striking a line judge Laura Clark with a ball</p>

<p>Djokovic was immediately disqualified after the incident as his US Open hopes were ended</p>

<p>With all the momentum on his side, top seed Djokovic broke his opponent for a third time before celebrating victory by blowing kisses into the empty stands of the Foro Italico.</p>

<p>Having recorded 51 victories in 60 matches, Djokovic is the second most successful player in the tournament's history - just behind nine-time champion Rafael Nadal.</p>

<p>Djokovic has won 27 of his 28 matches this year and will resume his hunt for an 18th Grand Slam title at the French Open, which begins on September 27.</p>

<p>'My best results have come on hard court but I enjoy competing on clay,' said Djokovic. 'It's a demanding surface where you have to be patient and construct your points.'</p>
