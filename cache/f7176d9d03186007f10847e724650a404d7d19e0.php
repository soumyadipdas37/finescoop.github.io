<p>And in an interview with The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday, Bella said she still couldn't fathom how someone could profess to being in love with two women.</p>

<p>Reflecting on how Locky had said 'I'm falling in love with you' only to dump her shortly afterwards, the 25-year-old said she 'wouldn't use the word played' because what happened to her was worse than that.</p>

<p>Explosive claim: The Bachelor's Bella Varelis accuses Locky Gilbert of being 'worse than a player' - after he said 'I'm falling in love with you' before dumping her in the finale</p>

<p>Bella acknowledged that while Locky, 31, may have found himself caught up in the moment, it was unnecessary for him to use the word 'love' because this had given her false hope she was going to be the winner.</p>

<p>'At the end of the day, if he was in love with me, he would want to be in a relationship with me,' she stated.  </p>

<p>Bella also lambasted Locky for leading her on in a new interview on the Life Uncut podcast.</p>

<p>Devastated: Reflecting on how Locky had said 'I'm falling in love with you' only to dump her shortly afterwards, the 25-year-old said she 'wouldn't use the word played' because what happened to her was worse than that</p>

<p>Heartbroken: Bella also revealed how shocking their break-up was on the Life Uncut podcast</p>

<p>Speaking to hosts Brittany Hockley and Laura Byrne - who are former Bachelor finalists themselves - Bella said: 'During lockdown, we were talking about engagement rings.</p>

<p>'He was like, "What would you do if I proposed to you at the end?"</p>

<p>'The one thing that really got me was when he said, "I can't wait to make you happy for the rest of your life." You don't just say that to someone unless you really want that to happen.'</p>

<p>Admitting that Locky's words had a significant effect on her, Bella continued: 'I remember saying to my mum, "I think I've actually found the person who wants to be with me."'</p>

<p>Setting the record straight: From discussing engagement rings to telling her he 'couldn't wait to make her happy for the rest of her life', Bella lambasted Locky for leading her on</p>

<p>Making promises he couldn't keep: 'During lockdown, we were talking about engagement rings,' Bella said. 'He was like, "What would you do if I proposed to you at the end?"'</p>

<p>'From all the things I have been through, from my exes to somehow being connected to The Bachelor, this was obviously what it was all pointing to,' she said of her thought process leading up to the finale.</p>

<p>'I had to come in here, I had to meet Locky, and he's going to be the person that I wanted to be with.'  </p>

<p>Two months on from the finale, Locky is still smitten with nurse Irena Srbinovska. She has packed up her life in Melbourne to live with the adventurer in Perth. </p>
