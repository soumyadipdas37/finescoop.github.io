<p>On Monday, the singer appeared on CBS This Morning and opened up about her struggle with postpartum depression following the birth of her son.</p>

<p>The Grammy-winning artist, who welcomed son Hayes Andrew March 23 with husband Ryan Hurd, said that she was flanked by a strong support system and received mental health services amid the difficult time, which coincided with the early days of the coronavirus pandemic shutdown.  </p>

<p>'Fortunately, I was able to do phone therapy during the pandemic,' the country music artist said, adding that she was surrounded by 'people that love [her] around [her] that are like, "Hey, if you're drowning right now, there's help."'</p>

<p>The My Church artist explained the turmoil she experienced at the time, saying, 'You're trying to become a new mother and good parent and do everything right and you just feel like you suck at every level.</p>

<p>'And then the one thing I've always felt like I have a handle on is my music. And to not be able to tour and have to furlough my band and crew, it was just a lot.'</p>

<p>Morris underwent 30 hours of labor and doctors had to perform a cesarean section in welcoming the child.</p>
