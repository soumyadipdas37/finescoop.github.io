<p>Slumming it: On Monday, Beyonce traded her superyacht for a more modest vessel, with the singer and her husband Jay-Z hitting the water around the Hamptons in a boat named the 'Van Dutch'</p>

<p>The mother-of-three shielded her eyes from the summer glare with a pair of white framed, triangular sunglasses.</p>

<p>She sipped on a drink while chatting with her husband, who sat adjacent to the pop star.</p>

<p>The 99 Problems rapper meanwhile wore a short-sleeved teal colored shirt with dark pants for the getaway.</p>

<p>Jay-Z -whose real name is Shawn Corey Carter- also covered his eyes with dark shades as the couple and their two companions jetted across the New York state waters. </p>

<p>Future's so bright: The mother-of-three shielded her eyes from the summer glare with a pair of white framed, triangular sunglasses</p>

<p>Letting her hair down: She sipped on a drink while chatting with her husband, who sat adjacent to the pop star</p>

<p>Recently, the Grammy-winning singer was seen cruising around the coast of Cavtat, Croatia with Jay-Z, their daughter Blue Ivy, eight, and three-year-old twins Rumi and Suri.</p>

<p>Travelling in true A-list style, the family were on the new Benetti-built superyacht LANA, which costs an eye-watering $2 million a week to rent. </p>

<p>The 351-foot long and 45-foot high luxurious yacht is one of the most impressive liners on the water currently, and is even longer than a football pitch.</p>

<p>The vessel boasts a stunning exterior design with spacious social areas, ample lounges and cozy salons in a soft colour palette to create a sense of 'serenity' among the VIP guests. </p>

<p>Incognito couple: Jay-Z -whose real name is Shawn Corey Carter- also covered his eyes with dark shades as the couple and their two companions jetted across the New York state waters</p>

<p>The design of the liner is meant to mimic the 'motion and fluidity' of the sea, with incredible high ceilings being the product of fine Italian craftsmanship and attention to detail.</p>

<p>There is plenty of room for both guests and crew members, with the yacht boasting an impressive eight en-suite staterooms, including a master suite and seven VIP staterooms all decorated with their own colour schemes.</p>

<p>Once onboard, guests have all the amenities they could hope for with a luxurious spa featuring treatment rooms for those who want to relax, and a well-equipped gym for those looking to stay active.</p>

<p>There's also plenty on offer to keep guests entertained, with the yacht holding a cinema room with an impressive audio system as well as a giant outdoor pool on the deck.</p>

<p>Not too shabby: The 351-foot long and 45-foot high luxurious yacht is one of the most impressive liners on the water currently, and is even longer than a football pitch</p>

<p>The singer was no doubt pleased to have a relaxing getaway, as despite the pandemic, she has remained busy these last few months with the release of her visual album Black Is King.</p>

<p>Black Is King was initially intended to be a companion piece to Beyonce's songs from The Lion King, but took on new meaning following the recent reckoning on racial injustice.</p>

<p>'The events of 2020 have made the film's vision and message even more relevant, as people across the world embark on a historic journey. We are all in search of safety and light,' she wrote on Instagram.  </p>

<p>'Many of us want change. I believe that when Black people tell our own stories, we can shift the axis of the world and tell our REAL history of generational wealth and richness of soul that are not told in our history books.'</p>

<p>The film boasted a star-studded cast including Lupita Nyong'o and Naomi Campbell, however had a disappointing debut weekend on Disney +, according to data analyzed by Yahoo! Finance. </p>
