<p> The CEOs of 23 retailers co-signed a letter to Boris Johnson asking for legal protection for shop workers who face violence and aggression from customers.  </p>

<p>  Alex Norris MP is due to get a second reading of his private members bill 'Assaults on Retail Workers ' this Friday, 25th September. </p>

<p> In the letter, it's stated : 'In partnership with our colleagues on the front-line, with USDAW and with a cross-party coalition of MPs, we support Alex Norris' Private Members Bill to provide that greater protection for our colleagues.</p>

<p>The furious shopper exits the store leaving a trail of glass all over the floor</p>

<p>'This united response from business leaders, trade unions and frontline workers should demonstrate the need for these additional protections. We believe there is a clear and broad-based consensus behind this Bill, and we ask that the Government acts now to support this important Bill and find time for it to pass through Parliament.'</p>

<p> Jo Whitfield, CEO, Co-op Food,  said: 'Our nation's shop workers are heroes and as important key workers they have played a vital role in providing communities across the country with access to food, household goods, financial services, prescriptions and medication all the way through lockdown. It is simply not part of their job to face a torrent of verbal or physical abuse and we want the Government to do their bit in introducing legislation that will make shop workers feel safer when they go to work.'</p>
