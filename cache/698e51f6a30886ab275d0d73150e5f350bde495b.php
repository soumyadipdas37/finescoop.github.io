<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Daniel Andrews is being urged to relax lockdown restrictions ahead of schedule after Victoria recorded only 11 new cases of coronavirus on Monday.    </p>

<p>It's the lowest number of new daily cases since mid-June - but the premier's road map plans to keep Melbourne shut down until at least 26 October.</p>

<p>Asked if the timeline would be brought forward, Mr Andrews said he would be 'guided by common sense' but insisted that 'it is too early for us to open up.'</p>

<p>Opposition MPs want restrictions relaxed faster as the lockdown threatens to put up to 400,000 Victorians out of work by Christmas, according to federal treasury estimates.</p>

<p>Melbourne residents have been confined to their homes since 8 July in a lockdown due to last four weeks longer than then shutdown of Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus was identified. </p>

<p>Liberal MP James Newbury said Mr Andrews should make plans to relax restrictions sooner to boost jobs and save businesses.</p>

<p>'Daniel Andrews refuses to offer Victorians hope,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'Instead of rewarding Melburnians for low case numbers, he is keeping the community locked up and under curfew. </p>

<p>'His restrictions are smashing up businesses, jobs, and livelihoods.' </p>

<p>Mr Newbury said Victoria should follow the example New South Wales which has kept the economy open with up to 20 cases per day in recent weeks. </p>

<p>'Victorians are furious. Every day, we look over the border into New South Wales, like a convict looking over the jail yard wall, to see a state with similar figures that manages to stay open,' he said. </p>

<p>Mr Andrews on Monday said Victoria's scientists have not advised him to relax restrictions faster than planned. </p>

<p>'I appreciate why everybody wakes up today, sees a low number, and everyone is hopeful and positive and that is a good thing but we have to stay the course on this,' he said. </p>

<p>'While we would all like to bring forward things a month, that is not the advice, not what the data and science says.</p>

<p>'Even with these low numbers and the great work we're doing, it is too early for us to open up. </p>

<p>'We need to take these steps, safe and steady and if they are not steady, it will not be safe. </p>

<p>'If we rush this, it will not be safe and everything that has been given and done and sacrificed will not be worth much.'</p>

<p>Asked if opening up could be brought forward at all, Mr Andrews added: 'If circumstances change, if we find ourselves ahead of schedule, not for one day, but in a manifest sense, common sense always guides us. </p>

<p>'We will look at what sits behind the numbers and then we will have to make a judgment. It won't be an easy judgment. </p>

<p>'Has enough time passed for us to be confident that the numbers we are seeing are a true reflection of how much virus is out there? They are very difficult judgments to make.'</p>

<p>Victoria recorded just 11 new cases on Monday, along with two deaths.</p>

<p>'This is not just a good day, this is a great day,' Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.</p>

<p>'We are seeing these numbers come down, the strategy is working.'</p>

<p>Victoria's 11 new cases were detected from 7,164 tests. In July test numbers peaked at about 30,000.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews encouraged anyone with a scratchy throat, runny nose or headache to get tested for the virus.</p>

<p>'It is a simple but profoundly important thing you can do for your family and every single Victorian family,' he said.</p>

<p>NSW has recorded four new cases of coronavirus including three returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine and one person linked to a known cluster.</p>

<p>The results were drawn from 7,765 tests, which was almost half the number conducted the day before.</p>

<p>NSW Health said while it was not unusual for testing numbers to drop over the weekend, it would like to see levels above 20,000, particularly in southwest Sydney. </p>
