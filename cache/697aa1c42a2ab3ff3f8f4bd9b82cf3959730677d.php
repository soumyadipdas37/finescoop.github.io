<p>Carole penned the letter to Don's first wife Gladys after conducting an affair with him for nine years (pictured during their marriage)</p>

<p>But Baskin says she would have only ever acted in self-defense. </p>

<p>Confirming the letter as her own, she said: 'I only meant it in the context of self-defense as Mike Murdock was physically abusive to me to the point of causing me to fear for my life.'  </p>

<p>The reality star, who is competing on Dancing With The Stars, has previously claimed a number of times that Murdock, whom she married in 1979 and shares daughter Jamie with, was abusive.</p>

<p>Carole and Don both divorced their respective spouses in 1991 and married each other the same year after their long affair together.</p>

<p>The reality star, who is competing on Dancing With The Stars, has previously claimed a number of times that Murdock, whom she married in 1979 and shares daughter Jamie with, was abusive</p>

<p>Don, a self-made millionaire through his real estate and used car businesses, continued to have affairs throughout his second marriage, according to Carole.</p>

<p>She said he frequently flew to Costa Rica to meet women and planned to move there, buying a one-way plane ticket in the days leading up to his disappearance.</p>

<p>Carole claims his mental health was deteriorating and he was showing signs of Alzheimer's, claims his attorneys and associates have rejected.</p>

<p>In July 1997, Don, then 59, filed a request for a restraining order against his wife, saying she had threatened to kill him and had hidden his gun to stop him protecting himself.</p>

<p>Baskin is the rival of Tiger King star Joe Exotic who shot to global fame this year on Netflix</p>

<p>The request was rejected and the couple continued to live together, despite Don telling Carole multiple times he wanted a divorce.</p>

<p>On August 18, 1997, Don disappeared after leaving home around 6am and he has not been seen since.</p>

<p>He left holdings worth around $5million, leading to a dispute between Carole and Don's children, who accuse her of being involved in his disappearance.</p>

<p>The case is still open and gained international prominence following the success of Netflix's Tiger King, in which warring big cat owner Joe Exotic frequently claimed Carole killed her husband and fed him to her tigers. </p>

<p>In a new Investigation Discovery special titled Tigers, Lies And Cover Ups - set to air this coming Sunday - private detectives take another look at the case, and bring it cadaver dogs to help try and locate Lewis' remains</p>

<p>She has consistently stated she had nothing to do with Don's disappearance.  </p>

<p>It comes after cadaver dogs appear to have picked up the scent of human remains near a Florida lake house belonging to Don. </p>

<p>In the new documentary titled Tigers, Lies And Cover Ups - set to air this coming Sunday - private detectives take another look at the case, and bring it cadaver dogs to help try and locate Lewis' remains. </p>

<p>In one scene from the upcoming special - shared with DailyMail.com - Captain Mike Hadsell  from Peace River K-9 Search &amp; Rescue brings along a trained dog as he scours the waters right by Lewis' lake house. </p>

<p>Carole has been married to Howard Baskin since 2004 and he works alongside her at Big Cat Rescue</p>

<p>The female dog is disturbed by the scents she picks up, whimpering and barking as the boat circles one portion of the lake. </p>

<p>'There's something in that lake, there's something that's causing the dog to continuously alert on the west side of the lake near Don Lewis' house,' an investigator states. </p>

<p>Last month, Lewis's family held a press conference in Tampa and announced an independent investigation into his disappearance. </p>

<p>It means Carole is set to be questioned under oath as part of the family's investigation.</p>
