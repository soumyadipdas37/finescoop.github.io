<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are considering a dramatic move for Real Madrid star Gareth Bale as hopes of signing Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund fade.</p>

<p>Bale is one of several options on the table with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer determined to bring in a right-sided forward before the transfer window closes next month.</p>

<p>If United go for Bale they are likely to propose a loan which would allow them to try again for Sancho at the end of the season.</p>

<p>Manchester United are considering making a loan deal for Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale</p>

<p>It comes as their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho has fallen flat this summer</p>

<p>A move to Old Trafford appeals to the Welshman although he would prefer a longer deal that means he wouldn’t be in the same situation at the age of 32 next summer.</p>

<p>Bale has been frozen out by coach Zinedine Zidane and is keen to leave the Bernabeu after Madrid scuppered his transfer to Jiangsu Suning in China in January by demanding a transfer fee once he had agreed wages of £1million-a-week.</p>

<p>Bale, who moved to Spain from Tottenham for £85m in 2013, still has two years left on his contract and Madrid have expressed a willingness to pay 50 per cent of his £600,000-a-week salary to help smooth his departure.</p>

<p>But the scale of the deal, combined with Bale’s age and recent injury record, means there is a long way to go before it could become a reality.</p>

<p>Having revived their long-standing interest in Bale, United are keeping their options open with Inter Milan’s Ivan Perisic, Kingsley Coman of Bayern Munich and Douglas Costa, who was put up for sale by Juventus at the weekend, among the other players under consideration.</p>

<p>The Old Trafford hierarchy began exploring other possibilities after accepting that it may not be possible to sign Sancho before the transfer deadline on October 5.</p>

<p>Although United agreed terms with the 20-year-old player and his representatives last week, Dortmund are refusing to budge on their £108m valuation. The player is also happy in Germany and unwilling to agitate for a move.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is determined to bring in a right-sided forward before the deadline</p>

<p>Bale has been frustrated with life at Real Madrid and has made it public he wants to leave</p>

<p>United have not given up hope of breaking the deadlock but may now have to wait until next summer when they are likely to have more transfer funds available.</p>

<p>Such is the current economic climate in football, it’s understood Solskjaer will have to sell one of his defenders before signing a new left-back.</p>

<p>Negotiations are continuing with Roma over a permanent move for Chris Smalling, who held talks with his manager at Carrington on Monday and did not take part in a TV filming session with the rest of his teammates.</p>

<p>Diogo Dalot, Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones are also available as United look to balance the books and firm up their interest in Real Madrid’s Sergio Reguilon or Alex Telles of FC Porto.</p>
