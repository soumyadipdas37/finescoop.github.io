<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sadio Mane could be regarded as a better player for Liverpool than John Barnes by the time the Senegalese leaves the club, according to Jamie Carragher. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old produced yet another scintillating display for the Merseyside club with both goals in a 2-0 victory over Chelsea on Sunday.</p>

<p>The left-sided forward has been one of the star players in a period of success for Liverpool in recent times, scoring 83 times and assisting 34 since signing in 2016.</p>

<p>Sadio Mane was once again the star of the show for Liverpool in a 2-0 victory over Chelsea</p>

<p>Jamie Carragher said the two-goal 'superstar' is one of the best left-sided players in world</p>

<p>Mane:   </p>

<p>Appearances: 173, Goals: 83, Assists: 34</p>

<p>Major honours: Champions League, Premier League, Super Cup, Club World Cup</p>

<p>Barnes:</p>

<p>Appearances: 402, Goals: 106, Assists: 70</p>

<p>Major honours: 2 First Divisions, 2 FA Cups, League Cup</p>

<p> </p>

<p>He has won the Champions League and the Premier League in that time, and former player Carragher described the Senegal international as a 'superstar' for the club. </p>

<p>'I think Mane is one of the best left sided attacking players in world football. I love him', Carragher told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'He's the first big signing for Jurgen Klopp and that got Liverpool into the Champions League in Klopp's first season. He's been a constant and he's an absolute superstar.'</p>

<p>The 42-year-old went as far as to say Mane's achievements for the club could eclipse that of club legend John Barnes, who is widely considered to be one of the best players in Liverpool's illustrious history.</p>

<p>'We loved John Barnes and he has always been in Liverpool's best ever XI, wide left. I think when Mane finishes he's going to be really pushing John Barnes for that position,' Carragher added. </p>

<p>Barnes, like Mane, was a skilful left-sided player who won two first division titles, two FA Cups and a League Cup during a 10-year spell for the club between 1987 and 1997. </p>

<p>Mane has a long way to go if he is to surpass Barnes' whopping 402 appearances for the club, but will certainly challenge his goal return if he is able to carry on his current form.</p>

<p>Carragher said Mane could challenge John Barnes as the club's greatest left-sided player</p>
