<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A college professor was suspended after she reportedly admitted during an online class that she hoped President Trump supporters caught COVID-19 and died before election day.</p>

<p>Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, said on Friday that it was aware of an 'overtly political statement' made by Assistant Professor Jennifer Mosher during a recent virtual classroom session. </p>

<p>Footage of Mosher's comments were shared to social media on Wednesday after a student captured the moment during the lesson.  </p>

<p>In the clip, Mosher allegedly expressed frustrations over people attending Trump's 2020 campaign rallies and not wearing CDC recommended face masks.</p>

<p>'I’ve become the type of person where I hope they all get it and die. I’m sorry, but that’s so frustrating I don’t know what else to do,' says Mosher.</p>

<p>'You can’t argue with them, you can’t talk sense with them. I said to somebody yesterday "I hope they all die before the election". That's the only saving hope I have right now.</p>

<p>Mosher then added that she 'should not be talking politics' at the clip's end. The story was first reported by WOWK-TV. </p>

<p>Although the clip does not show Mosher specifically referencing Trump supporters, she does mention a recent indoor event where attendees did not wear face masks. </p>

<p>Assistant Professor Jennifer Mosher (pictured) of Marshall University was placed on administrative leave this week over an 'overtly political statement' </p>

<p>Footage of Mosher (pictured) and her remarks were shared to social media, where they garnered backlash from Twitter users </p>

<p>Most recently, Trump hosted an indoor campaign rally that gathered thousands inside a manufacturing plant in Las Vegas where very few people donned the protective gear.</p>

<p>The crowd size greatly dwarfed the Nevada's mandate limiting indoor gatherings to under 50 people. </p>

<p>Trump was noted by critics to repeatedly defy health guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as clash with leading public health experts on his response team. </p>

<p>His Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally ended with an unexpectedly small crowd, eight members of the advance team contracting the virus and campaign staff having to self-isolate afterward in case of infection </p>

<p>He boosted beforehand that face masks and social distancing would not be required for the June 20th event, despite cases still rising across the country at the time. </p>

<p>Hermain Cain, a prominent Republican businessman and fervent Trump supporter, died of COVID-19 on July 30 after attending the Tulsa rally. </p>

<p>None of the people photographed with Cain wore face masks and were not the recommended six feet apart. He was first tested positive for COVID-19 on June 29 and was hospitalized on July 1. </p>

<p>Trump was pictured for the first time publicly wearing a face mask in July and told Fox News that he's 'all for masks.'</p>

<p>But in April, he ignored advice from that Center for Disease Control and Prevention and said he likely wouldn't wear one.</p>

<p>'I don't think I'm going to be doing it. Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens - I just don't see it,' he said at the time. </p>

<p>Since the video clip of Mosher surfaced online, she and Marshall University have both faced backlash.</p>

<p>Marshall University replied to Twitter comments and said it did not 'condone the use of any of its educational platforms to belittle people or wish harm...'</p>

<p>A number of Twitter users spoke out against the video and implored Marshall University to take action over the matter</p>

<p>Twitter user: 'Marshall must take appropriate action to discourage and extinguish this sort of behavior'</p>

<p>'This represents Marshall University, which represents our region. Everyone is entitled to opinions, but wishing death on people who disagree with your opinion is evil and we expect better,' one person wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>'Unacceptable!' another wrote. 'Marshall must take appropriate action to discourage and extinguish this sort of behavior. She needs our prayers but also needs to be let go. A black eye for Marshall if nothing is done.'</p>

<p>Marshall University responded to comments on Twitter, saying: 'The university does not support or condone the use of any of its educational platforms to belittle people or wish harm on those who hold differing political views.' </p>

<p>The institution said in its statement that Mosher has been been placed on administrative leave and an investigation is pending.</p>

<p>'The university does not support or condone the use of any of its educational platforms to belittle people or wish harm on those who hold differing political views,' it said.</p>
