<p>In June, the vegan influencer suffered a bitter break up with fellow Too Hot to Handle winner, Harry Jowsey.</p>

<p>And, Frankie has stirred up quite a bit of reality show drama recently as she was also recently spotted holding hands with Love Is Blind star Damian Powers after a romantic dinner in LA. </p>

<p>'People are quick to put a title on things but we're just in the beginning stages and are taking things slow,' Jef said. (The couple is pictured together on Monday)</p>

<p>Powers, who is still dating his Love Is Blind co-star Giannina Gibelli, tried to clear the air, telling Entertainment Weekly that the situation was totally innocent.</p>

<p>He said that the pair were introduced by their mutual attorney, Alex Ion, who arranged for the fellow Netflix reality stars and their friends to enjoy an evening in LA. </p>

<p>Powers told the outlet: 'Alex arranged for both Francesca and I to meet with him for dinner at the Eveleigh in West Hollywood along with some of our other friends, including Mitchell Crawford and Raiane Macedo.' </p>

<p>'Upon exiting the Eveleigh, we were all greeted by paparazzi. Francesca grabbed on to me in an attempt to shield herself from the paparazzi as our entire group entered the car. Francesca and I are not dating or romantically involved but remain friends,' he concluded. </p>
