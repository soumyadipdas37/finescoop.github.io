<p>Gethin was previously engaged to Katherine Jenkins before the couple separated in December 2011 following a five-year relationship. </p>

<p>Speaking in 2014, mezzo-soprano Katherine claimed it was Gethin who initiated their split, shortly before she embarked on a world tour.  </p>

<p>She: told Wales Online: 'At the end of 2011 when Gethin and I broke up, the reality of it was that about two weeks later I had to go on a UK tour where every night I’m singing songs of heartbreak and every day just trying to find the energy to cope let alone going on stage and understand his reason for doing it. </p>

<p>'Meanwhile everybody else is under the impression it was my decision, my ambition, I wanted to take over the world. It was so far from the truth.' </p>
