<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Shocking footage shows hundreds of students climbing on top of ping pong tables and raving at a Coventry University accommodation block last night. </p>

<p>At least 200 students are thought to have crammed into a common room at Arundel House, close to Coventry University's main campus, ignoring social distancing guidelines and the rule of six.    </p>

<p>Some revellers could be heard screaming, while a group of male students clambered on top of a ping pong table as they sang along to the thumping music. </p>

<p>The accommodation block is just a two minute walk from campus and is also close to the town centre. </p>

<p>A spokesman said Coventry University was aware of the incident and said any students found to be in breach of the university's code of conduct could face disciplinary proceedings.</p>

<p>An investigation is underway to find the organisers of the party, with police shutting down communal areas in the accommodation blocks and beefing up security in light of last night's gathering. </p>

<p>The footage emerged despite coronavirus causing havoc at universities across the country.</p>

<p>Up to 4,000 students across Britain are now self-isolating for a fortnight after more than 500 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed across at least 32 universities.</p>

<p>The University of Exeter became the latest to institute a 'soft lockdown' on its students yesterday afternoon, asking them not to socialise in other people's residences and only to mix with people within their household. </p>

<p>It is believed that more than half of the cases confirmed in Exeter over the last week can be traced back to the university.  </p>

<p>Elsewhere, 1,700 students are under lockdown at the Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) campuses of Birley and Cambridge Halls. All lectures, seminars and classes for first-year students at the university will now be online for the next 14 days.  </p>

<p>A statement issued from Coventry University this afternoon said: 'We are aware of an incident in a private accommodation block which was captured in a video that has been shared online.</p>

<p>'We are deeply concerned by the scenes in the video and strongly condemn the blatant breaches of the rule of six and other guidelines as they risk the health of our students, colleagues and the communities in which we are located.</p>

<p>'We have introduced a code of conduct for students and shared this widely with them ahead of the weekend.</p>

<p>Some revellers could be heard screaming, while a group of male students clambered on top of a ping pong table as they sang along to the thumping music</p>

<p>The accommodation block is just a two minute walk from campus and is also close to the town centre</p>

<p>'This code of conduct makes it clear that a failure to follow university and Government health, safety and wellbeing requirements will constitute a breach of the university's disciplinary regulations and may be dealt with as a matter of misconduct. </p>

<p>'If any of those involved in the video are found to be students of Coventry University and in breach of the code of conduct, we will take appropriate action. </p>

<p>A spokesman for Coventry Police said: 'We attended Arundel House today (September 29) following reports of a large gathering of students in the early hours of this morning. It's believed around 200 people may have been present in a common room.</p>

<p>'We will be examining CCTV and will take action if evidence comes to light that this was a planned party.</p>

<p>'We have liaised with management at the student accommodation block and they have agreed to close some communal areas and to increase security.</p>

<p>'We have also arranged a Safer Students stall in Arundel House tomorrow to reiterate CoVID-19 regulations and the consequences should those regulations be flouted.'</p>

<p>A spokesman for NIDO, which runs Arundel House, said: 'We were made aware of a large social gathering in our residence in Coventry last night. </p>

<p>'Steps were immediately taken to deal with the gathering, including calling the police for assistance. The police were unfortunately unable to attend at the time. We understand that they are under a lot of strain due to the number of similar incidents, both in Coventry and nationally.</p>

<p>'We are in close contact with FutureLets at Coventry University and are assisting the local authorities with their investigation.</p>

<p>'In line with government advice, we are reinforcing our zero tolerance policy to different households mixing and have put in place stringent Covid-19 related measures, including the installation of Perspex screens at reception and hand sanitiser stations throughout the building, the posting of social distancing guidance and measures, ensuring PPE is worn by all staff outside of the office and providing residents with regular updates on the latest government guidance.</p>

<p>'We have also now restricted all visitors to the building, closed communal areas, and have stepped up security across our residences to oversee these policies. We do not want the actions of a few to affect the experience of many.' </p>
