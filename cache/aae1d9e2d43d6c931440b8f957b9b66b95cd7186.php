<p>Namaste! The James Bond actor, 47, went shirtless to enjoy a spot of snorkelling before he meditated on the sandy shores</p>

<p>Off he goes: Looking as youthful as ever, the screen star sported swimming trunks while opting for comfort by going barefoot</p>

<p>The sale will see the 007 star make a tidy profit after he created the estate by combining two separate plots of land that he purchased for just $5.1 million and $2.25 million in 2000. </p>

<p>The oceanfront retreat spans more than an acre with two homes that combined to make nine bedrooms and 14 bathrooms. </p>

<p>Pierce told the Wall Street Journal that when he realized 'Die Another Day' was a hit, he turned to his wife, filmmaker Keely Shaye Smith, 57, and told her 'go build your dream house. And she did'.  </p>

<p>The house was built in 2010 and has so many solar panels that the new owner will be able to heat the house, outdoor pool and guest cabana and still sell electricity back to the local grid. </p>

<p>The home is exceptionally eco-friendly with all water being recycled on site in a purpose-built plant along with a waste disposal system, custom-built energy-saving lighting and a solar-powered revolving compost heap. </p>

<p>When their dream home was first built, the pair were determined that it would set a new standard in being eco-friendly. </p>

'On a rare parcel of more than one acre with approximately 117 feet of beachfront, Orchid House is created for resort-style living.' </p>

<p>The TV and film star fronted four James Bond films from 1995 to 2002: GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day. </p>
