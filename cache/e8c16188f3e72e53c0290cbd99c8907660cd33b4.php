<p>With very few new movies screening at cinemas across the country because of COVID-19, families have turned to projecting their old favourites on walls in the home for a theatre-style experience.</p>

<p>'Thank you to whoever posted about the $99 iBright Screen Projectors from the post office,' one woman wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>Crafty Australians have started curating their own at-home cinema experiences with a $99 gadget you can purchase from the post office, and a little bit of tech know-how</p>

<p>'Thank you to whoever posted about the $99 iBright Screen Projectors from the post office,' one woman wrote on Facebook</p>

<p>She combined that with a $55 Chromecast - a digital streaming device - and a $25 floating shelf from Bunnings - to balance the projector on - to show off her latest Netflix watch, all from the comfort of her bed. </p>

<p>'The sound and picture quality is amazing, I would definitely recommend doing this,' she said. </p>

<p>Others who were searching for a new TV abandoned looking altogether after they purchased the projector.  </p>

<p>'Our TV has been fading and getting white spots so we have been looking for a cheap new one,' said one lady online.</p>

<p>The projector weighs just 4.5 kilos and can project as wide as five metres onto a flat surface</p>

<p>'All of them have been out of our price range so we ended up buying a projector from the post office. Then we went to Spotlight and bought a blockout roller blind to use as the screen.'</p>

<p>She showed a picture of her contraption, which is approximately two metres wide, and can easily be moved outside for 'BBQ movies'.   </p>

<p>Some people have purchased them to have in their caravan on holidays, while others keep it near their cabana and outdoor pool to watch outside in the summer months</p>

<p>'This is such a cool projection. I'll have to look into this,' said one person in reply to the projector owners.</p>

<p>'Thank you I just jumped on and bought one! Can't wait to try it,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'I'm sold. Forget the new TV this is what I need'.   </p>
