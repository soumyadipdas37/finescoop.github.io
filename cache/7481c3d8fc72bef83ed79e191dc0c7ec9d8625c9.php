<p>The 41-year-old Canadian born actress wore a blue-and-white striped maternity dress with a fun hat.</p>

<p>And the Wedding Crashers star seemed to have her hands full as she carried several books while juggling two bags.</p>

<p>Bump it up: Rachel McAdams, 41, was spotted out in Los Angeles Friday putting her growing bump on display. The actress appeared to make a few pit stops, picking up some supplies for her two-year-old son before grabbing coffee and breakfast</p>

<p>She paired the nautical sundress with a pair of white trainers and and oversized navy tote, protecting her face from the sun in a straw hat with a silver ribbon around the band. </p>

<p>Coordinating her mask with her ensemble, Rachel rocked a dark grey face covering and a pair of oversized sunglasses. </p>

<p>Not seen was her boyfriend of four years, Jamie Linden with whom she already has a son.</p>

<p>Breakfast run: The expecting mother made sure she and her baby both had room to breathe, throwing on a loose blue and white striped dress with a collar detail as she picked up coffee and food in LA</p>

<p>The Game Night actress made a few stops, picking up what appeared to be books and games for her son before driving to a trendy cafe to get coffee and takeout. </p>

<p>She kept her blonde locks down as she walked with the breakfast provisions to her Tesla. </p>

<p>McAdams' pregnancy was first reported in August after she was spotted out with a baby bump. </p>

<p>The actress is so lowkey about her family that she has never even walked a red carpet with her screenwriter boyfriend Jamie who she has been dating since 2016.  </p>

<p>Despite being a Hollywood actress in the public eye, McAdams is very protective when it comes to her personal life and does not have any social media.</p>

<p>Rachel quietly gave birth to her now two-year-old son - whose name has never been publicly released - in April 2018 and shares very little about him. </p>

<p>She also skipped the premiere of her film Game Night.   </p>

<p>In an interview with the Sunday Times in 2018, she vowed 'I want to keep his life private, even if mine isn't'.</p>

<p>While in quarantine Rachel has been afforded a lot of time with both her boyfriend and her young son as they split time between her farm outside of Toronto and their home in Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Speaking to Heroes of Health on the London Health Sciences Foundation Youtube, Rachel shared that she has a welcomed distraction with her two-year-old son even though some days are harder than others. </p>

<p>'There are days, sure, but I would be so bored without him around to make it so fun,' she said adding that he is 'so entertaining.' </p>

<p>Rachel also shared that thankfully none of her projects really took a hit, as she had just finished shooting Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, in Iceland before the pandemic hit.</p>

<p>Fire Saga: Filmed in Iceland, McAdams stars in a movie about two life long friends hoping to reach their destiny by entering the Eurovision song contest</p>

<p>Starring opposite Will Ferrell, the movie which was released on Netflix, chronicles a pair of longtime friends as they try their luck at the famous Eurovision song contest. </p>

<p>As Hollywood reopens amid the pandemic, McAdams will soon get back to work after she gives birth to her brewing baby sometime in the next few months.   </p>

<p>Upcoming projects for Rachel include Sherlock Holmes 3 which has now been pushed from a December 2020 release date to a December 2021 date. </p>

<p>The film will continue to star Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law. </p>
