<p>'The events took place this morning, around 10am when a keeper with 19 years of experience at the zoo accessed the indoor facilities for the usual breakfast routine, cleaning and preparing the facilities.</p>

<p>'Upon entering a bounded area with a triple door, the caretaker met Malabo, a 29-year-old male gorilla, who had accessed it. </p>

<p>'The reasons why the animal was able to access the area are being investigated internally. However, the judicial investigation will determine the exact details. </p>

<p>'It should be noted that this interior area is for driving, with no exit to the public area and in this sense, the emergency protocol was quickly activated, notifying the Samur emergncy team and the municipal police. </p>

<p>The zookeeper was stabilised by paramedics at the scene before being rushed to the Madrid Clinical Hospital in a serious condition</p>

<p>The Municipal Police of Madrid have taken over the investigation as it is classified as a work accident</p>

<p>'The zoo team managed to remove the animal and later, the veterinary team anaesthetised the animal with a tranquilliser dart, which was transferred to its interior bedroom and at the moment, it is calm.'</p>

<p>'Note that Malabo has been raised by his caregivers since he was born with a protective behaviour towards the group and close to his caregivers. At this time, the caregiver has a reserved prognosis and the first thing is to wish her speedy recovery.'</p>

<p>'Today, the gorilla facilities will remain closed so that both Malabo and the rest of the group are calm.'</p>
