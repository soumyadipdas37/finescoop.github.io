<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dele Alli's Tottenham future has been plunged into more doubt after it was revealed he has not been included in the squad to face Chelsea tonight.</p>

<p>The England midfielder has been linked with a move away from north London in the transfer window, and he appears to have dropped down Mourinho's pecking order this season.</p>

<p>Alli has only started one match, coming off at half-time against Everton, and has come on as a substitute just once, in the Europa League against Shkendija.</p>

<p>Dele Alli has played just twice this season, coming off the bench against Shkendija for one </p>

<p>Alli (centre) is not injured but will once again be left out of Jose Mourinho's Tottenham squad</p>

<p>The Telegraph are now reporting that despite Mourinho insisting he will rotate his squad for the Carabao Cup, Alli has still not made it into his manager's plans. </p>

<p>When asked about his plans for the competition at the weekend, Mourinho claimed it was impossible to fight for the League Cup trophy amid his side's heavy fixture schedule.</p>

<p>'What would you do in my position?' he said. 'I would like to fight for the Carabao but I don't think I can. We have a game on Thursday that gives us not as much money as the Champions League, but the group phase of the Europa League gives us a certain amount that for a club like us is very important.</p>

<p>'It's a competition with a possible group phase that gives us a good chance to go through to the next knockout stage, so this game on Thursday is very important for us.'</p>

<p>Alli (left) and Mourinho have had a good relationship but he is now down the pecking order</p>

<p>Mourinho promised changes amid a packed schedule but still Alli has not made the squad</p>

<p>But despite the games coming thick and fast for Mourinho and his team, Alli has still not made it into the squad and a move away in the January window now appears even more likely.</p>

<p>One team credited with an interest in the 24-year-old is Paris Saint-Germain, but the French giants have been put off by the asking price placed upon his head.</p>

<p>Alli will be desperate to secure first-team football this season, with the rescheduled European Championships coming next summer.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that Alli will leave Spurs permanently, but a season-long loan could be sanctioned if it is right for all parties.</p>

<p>Alli has been linked with a move away in the transfer window but nothing has materialised yet</p>

<p>A loan move to join up with the likes of Kylian Mbappe at PSG was touted but price is an issue</p>
