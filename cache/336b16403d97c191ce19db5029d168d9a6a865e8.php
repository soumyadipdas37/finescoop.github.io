<p>DIET DELIVERY BOX</p>

<p>Last January, my husband and I signed up to a food delivery service, Mindful Chef. It's low carb and gluten free. </p>

<p>I've lost 5lb and it's so tasty that we haven't stopped. We use it for four meals, which in total costs £63 a week, and they take only 15 minutes to cook. (mindfulchef.com).</p>

<p>SMILE REBOOT</p>

<p>Six years ago, I found out I had such bad gum disease, due to a genetic condition, that I needed all my teeth out. </p>

<p>It was heart-breaking and traumatic, as I was only 44. I had to wear dentures and looked about 80! Then I got implants. They cost £30,000 but were so worth it.</p>

<p>COUPLES CYCLING</p>

<p>My husband and I got into cycling during lockdown. We do 15 to 18 miles after work on week nights. </p>

<p>Then another 25 to 30 on the weekend (about three hours). It was a great way to spend quality time together. </p>

<p>Now, I've started going back to the gym, too, for HIIT sessions, three times a week (£67 per month, ultimatewarriortraining.com).</p>

<p>BUDGET SKINCARE</p>

<p>Before lockdown, I used Elemis skincare as I get a wonderful facial every six months which uses their products (£70, headtotoetherapy.co.uk). </p>

<p>However, I couldn't buy them when the salon shut, so I started using Restore Day and Night Cream (both £14, marksandspencer.com). </p>

<p>They're so much cheaper and I can't say I notice a difference. I've kept using Elemis Nourishing Omega Rich Cleansing Oil (£32.50, elemis.com) though.</p>

<p>CHISELLED CHEEKBONES</p>

<p>I've never had Botox. Instead, I use Iconic London's Sheer Blush (£18, iconiclondoninc.com). </p>

<p>It's a tube of dewy pink cream, which gives your face an instant lift and glow. It doesn't sit in fine lines, like powders do. </p>

<p>I put it on my cheeks and lips, too. My husband often says I have good cheekbones!</p>
