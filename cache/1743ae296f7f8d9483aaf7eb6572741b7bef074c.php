<p>The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has analysed how the Communist superpower uses so-called wolf warrior diplomacy to silence its major trading partners.</p>

<p>Like two-thirds of the world, Australia has China as its biggest trading partner.</p>

<p>Developing and first-world nations alike are heavily reliant on China, whether they are a major exporter or an importer of essential goods.</p>

<p>Australia's exports to China are worth more than the goods it imports, which makes it particularly vulnerable to politically-motivated trade sanctions.</p>

<p>Australia is far from the only nation China is bullying to get its way politically. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has analysed how the Communist superpower uses so-called wolf warrior diplomacy to silence its major trading partners.

<p>While Australia is one of the few nations in the world exporting iron ore, the commodity used to make steel, it hardly has a monopoly on wine, beef, tourism and university education.</p>

<p>ASPI, a think tank, said this made Australia particularly vulnerable to Chinese retaliation, with its ambassador to Canberra Cheng Jingye in April threatening a trade boycott following calls from Prime Minister Scott Morrison for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.</p>

<p>'China is the largest trading partner for nearly two-thirds of the world's countries, and its global economic importance gives it significant leverage,' it said in a report by Fergus Hanson, Emilia Currey and Tracy Beattie.</p>

<p>'The impacts of coercive diplomacy are exacerbated by the growing dependency of foreign governments and companies on the Chinese market.'</p>

<p>ASPI's 68-page report - titled The Chinese Communist Party's coercive diplomacy - said China's bullying was set to get worse.</p>

<p>'The economic, business and security risks of that dependency are likely to increase if the CCP can continue to successfully use this form of coercion,' it said.</p>

<p>'This carrot-and-stick approach reflects "a new level of assertiveness, confidence and ambition" in the CCP’s foreign policy and economic diplomacy.'</p>

<p>The Communist nation has now banned a major grain exporter, CBH in Western Australia, from sending barley there, claiming there were pests in the produce.</p>

<p>Instead of using military force, ASPI said the Chinese Communist Party deployed 'non-militarised coercion' or 'the use of threats of negative actions to force the target state to change behaviour'.</p>

<p>'The CCP is instead arbitrarily imposing measures without officially acknowledging the link between the measures taken and the CCP’s interests, which allows for greater flexibility in escalating or de-escalating situations with less accountability and international oversight,' it said.</p>

<p>'This non-traditional type of coercive diplomacy therefore requires a very different set of policy tools and responses.'</p>

<p>Despite the trade retaliation from China, Australia recorded a record current account surplus in the June quarter.</p>

<p>The balance of payments data, broadly measuring Australia's international trade, showed a record $17.7billion surplus - a doubling from $8.7billion in the March quarter.</p>

<p>Australia's trade with China during the last financial year was worth $151billion - with China buying 34 per cent of exports. </p>

<p>This occurred despite the closure of Australia's national border in March, which saw a 99 per cent plunge in overseas tourist arrivals. </p>

<p>Economist Saul Eslake said while China could make trade boycott threats, it wasn't in a position to cut off Australia's iron ore exports, used to make steel.</p>

<p>'The thing that will ultimately kill our iron ore trade is when the Chinese have enough scrap steel that they don't need to make raw steel to meet what they need,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'China won't be in a position where scrap steel can meet most of their demand until 2030 or thereabouts.' </p>

<p>Brazilian iron ore production has faltered as a result of COVID-19 and the Simandou mine in the west African nation of Guinea, which Chinese aluminium Chinalco has a 40 per cent stake in, won't be ready for at least five years.</p>

<p>China has been Australia's biggest two-way trading partner since 2009.</p>

<p>Little more than a decade ago, China replaced Japan as Australia's biggest trading partner.</p>

<p>Japan in 1967 replaced the United Kingdom as Australia's key trading partner as Great Britain prepared to join the European Community.</p>

<p>Unlike the United States and Russia, which pressure smaller nations, ASPI said the Chinese Communist Party preferred threats to chequebook diplomacy.</p>

<p>'The CCP's approach is unique in that it rarely employs traditional methods of coercive diplomacy, which are regulated through the state’s official capacity,' it said.</p>
