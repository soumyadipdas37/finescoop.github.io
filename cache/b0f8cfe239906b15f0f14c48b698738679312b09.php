<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Borussia Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre has confirmed that Jadon Sancho will be staying at the Bundesliga club amid interest from Manchester United.</p>

<p>The England international winger is being chased by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side this summer but the Red Devils missed Dortmund's August 10 deadline to finalise a deal for the player.</p>

<p>And Favre, who has managed Sancho for the last two season, has joined Dortmund's players and sporting directors in confirming the 20-year-old's stay at the club, though claims he is not the finished article yet. </p>

<p>Manchester United and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (above) have been chasing Sancho all summer</p>

<p>The Dortmund boss told Keystone-SDA: 'We need him, no question. Everyone was happy that he stayed. </p>

<p>'We don't need to talk long about its qualities – they are enormous. He scores and sets up a lot of goals and can often make all the difference. </p>

<p>'But there are some details that Sancho needs to improve. That is quite normal for a 20-year-old.' </p>

<p>The 2020-21 Bundesliga season starts again on Friday and Sancho will be hoping he can match or even better his goals and assists tally from last season.</p>

<p>Sancho is set to be part of Dortmund's plans ahead of the new Bundesliga season on Friday</p>

<p>Favre (above) says he is delighted that Sancho, who scored 17 goals last season, will be staying</p>

<p>The England star scored 17 goals and laid on 16 more for his team-mates as Dortmund finished as Bundesliga runners-up to Bayern Munich.  </p>

<p>He is set to be part of a devastating front line for the Bundesliga giants alongside forward Erling Braut Haaland, Thorgan Hazard and Julian Brandt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Favre also has another promising young Englishman at his disposal as Jude Bellingham is set to embark on his debut campaign in Germany.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old joined Dortmund from Birmingham in a £25million transfer this summer and Favre cannot wait to see him in the middle of the park in the German top-flight.</p>

<p>The Dortmund coach is also looking forward to coaching Englishman Jude Bellingham (above)</p>

<p>He added: 'Of course, I'm looking forward to a player like him. I got to know him better during the preparation. </p>

<p>'I like how he handles the ball and how he can defend it. Jude possesses many tactical options and an amazing presence. </p>

<p>'He can play as a six or eight, plays good passes, seeks completion. Various systems are possible with him. It's all very, very interesting.' </p>
