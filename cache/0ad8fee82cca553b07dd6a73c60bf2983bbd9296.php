<p>Chelsea's move for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Rennes is on the verge of completion </p>

<p>Frank Lampard believes the shot-stopper's medical is done ahead of a £22million transfer</p>

<p>'With Mendy, the medical, I think it's done, but I want to be a bit careful and don't want to give absolute confirmation until I see him, possibly over the next 24 hours,' said Lampard. </p>

<p>'But it seems like it's on the verge of being done.'</p>

<p>Current No1 Arrizabalaga has struggled in the opening games of the season. The 'keeper let a weak shot squeeze past him in the first match against Brighton and was under-fire against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>Current No1 Kepa Arrizabalaga could face being dropped for this weekend's trip to West Brom</p>

<p>Tammy Abraham, Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud also got on the scoresheet while Willy Caballero kept a clean sheet in his first start of the season.</p>

<p>New signings Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell made their debuts at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>Silva played 61 minutes before he was substituted for Kurt Zouma while Chilwell replaced Havertz for the final 25 minutes and grabbed an assist by setting up Giroud.  </p>
