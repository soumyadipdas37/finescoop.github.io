<p>Furious: Kym Marsh has sparked a row with Morrisons on Sunday after her vulnerable mother was given food that a staff member had touched</p>

<p>Pauline wrote in her original tweet: 'Went to Morrisons cafe yesterday at Stockton Heath for some lunch as we've done many times, ordered scampi and chips, when the young lad brought it to me some of the food fell off the plate onto the tray, he picked it up and put it back into my plate with his bare hands.</p>

<p>'My husband told him to take it back as he had handled it , we didn't get any apology or anything, don't think we'll be eating there again in a hurry.</p>

<p>'Think some staff need more training in hygiene. I thought Morrisons would at least get back to me on here but nothing.'</p>

<p>Incident: Pauline (pictured) wrote in her original tweet that the waiter giving them their food touched the food with 'his bare hands' after it fell off the plate and onto the tray</p>

<p>Angry: Sharing her mother Pauline's post about the incident, Kym wrote: '<?php echo e('@'); ?>Morrisons is this acceptable then?'</p>

<p>One of Kym's followers blasted her criticism, saying: 'Bit of scampi on the deck Jesus Christ chill out eh [laughing emoji].'</p>

<p>But Kym was not best pleased with the response, as she hit back: 'Because my parents are vulnerable you imbecile! What is wrong with you!'</p>

<p>The online troll responded in kind, criticising her parents for going out during the coronavirus pandemic even though they're vulnerable.</p>

<p>They wrote: 'If there that vulnerable why are they out mingling in Morrison cafes ? Tweets like this can lead to people getting sacked over a small mistake !'</p>

<p>Reaction: One follower blasted her criticism, saying her parents shouldn't have gone to the cafe if they were vulnerable to which Kym responded by calling them an 'imbecile'</p>

<p>To which Kym argued: 'Listen mate, we are in the middle of a pandemic. Everyone is trying to get on with life as safely and easily as possible. </p>

<p>'No matter who it is, someone handling your food like that at anytime, but especially now, is unacceptable! People like you are part of the issue.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Kym's representatives and a spokesperson for Morrisons for comment. </p>

<p>This comes after it was revealed Kym is set to go up against Lorraine Kelly's eponymous show as she's teaming up with Gethin Jones to front a new breakfast show on BBC. </p>
