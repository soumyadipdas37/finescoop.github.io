<p>He added: 'Then I had to downsize to 30 people at home, with a pianist and Christie Whelan Browne to sing.'</p>

<p>'And it ended up being my boyfriend Jack Stratton-Smith and I having a champagne at 9am and drunkenly singing karaoke to each other. But all things considered it was quite nice,' he said. </p>

<p>Iso-birthday: Joel celebrated his birthday on August 11th and wrote on Instagram: 'I turned 30 today or ''gay dead'' as my community affectionately call it'</p>

<p>'It's been a very bizarre 48 hours. So given the postponement I've decided I'll stay 29 and try again next year,' he joked.</p>

<p>He continued: 'However I've genuinely had a truly wonderful day and have been sent some outrageously special gifts by some even more outrageously special people.' </p>

<p>'Turns out the key to a successful iso-birthday is to drink hard, drink often and drink early! And now I can go to bed,' he finished.</p>
