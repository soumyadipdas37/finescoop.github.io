<p>Now homeowners have been warned to brace for an invasion of more than 200billion of the amorous insects.</p>

<p>Experts say the warm but wet weather has provided perfect growing conditions for crane fly larvae, or 'leatherjackets', in their underground tunnels.</p>

<p>Now homeowners have been warned to brace for an invasion of more than 200billion daddy long legs (pictured) </p>

<p>And the 'sex-crazed' creatures are now hatching – with hordes expected to swarm into homes searching for a mate. </p>

<p>Daddy long legs – which have just a few days to breed before they die – are attracted to lights and often find themselves trapped indoors.</p>

<p>Lawn treatment specialist Ian Kettle said the hungry larvae had been leaving bare patches on customers' grass in Hampshire, Surrey and West Sussex.</p>

<p>He added: 'I've worked in the lawn treatment business for 13 years and never seen so many.'</p>

<p>Paul Hetherington, of insect charity Buglife, said: 'They cannot eat or drink and only live for a few days. </p>

<p>They are purely built to have sex and the females lay eggs outdoors. They have got 24 hours or so to find a mate.</p>

<p>'They are sex machines.'</p>

<p>The name daddy long legs is thought to come from the title of a 1912 novel by American author Jean Webster.</p>
