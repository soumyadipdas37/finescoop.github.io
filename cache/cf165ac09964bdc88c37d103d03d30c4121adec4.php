<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Danny Rose is nearing the exit at Tottenham having been frozen out by Jose Mourinho and favours a move abroad. </p>

<p>The full-back and manager had a heated argument last season in footage shown in Amazon's fly-on-the-wall All or Nothing documentary following the club's campaign. </p>

<p>And according to the Sun, Rose is set to leave the club, preferring the next chapter of his career to be away from the Premier League. </p>

<p>Amazon's crew filmed the row between Danny Rose and Jose Mourinho in their documentary</p>

<p>Rose was frustrated about his lack of game time and is now set to leave Tottenham  </p>

<p>The England international is nursing a minor injury at the moment but it is unlikely he will be in north London when the transfer window closes. </p>

<p>He currently has one year left on his contract but it seems the 2019-20 season sealed his fate. </p>

<p>Rose was dropped from the team for a 0-0 draw against Watford and confronted Mourinho about it in his office, captured by the television cameras. </p>

<p>Rose threatened to stay at home if he didn't get more minutes on the pitch, saying: 'Gaffer, I just want to know exactly what the problem is.</p>

<p>When Mourinho asked what he means, the defender replied: 'You know exactly what I mean, how I'm being treated. I was very excited when you came as manager, but if you don't want me to play, I'd rather you just tell me now, and I'll stay at home, and I'll train at home.'</p>

<p>Rose had a loan spell at Newcastle last season but the full-back favours a move abroad </p>

<p>Mourinho then said: 'Let me try to be as open as I can with you, because I think you deserve that. When I arrived, you played some matches, you were on the bench some matches, I didn't select you in other matches.</p>

<p>'The week before Liverpool you were fantastic in training and that made me decide that in the most difficult game against the most difficult opponent, you play.</p>

<p>'I think you didn't play well. The next game against Middlesbrough Tanganga played so well, and is so strong defensively, and doesn't make any kind of mistakes because he's so fast and so powerful. I cannot say, you're going to be first choice, you're going to play every match. It depends on you.' </p>

<p>The England international still has a year on his Spurs contract but is heading for the exit </p>

<p> The 30-year-old admitted he wasn't good enough against Liverpool but insists he hadn't been given a run of games to improve and carve out some consistency. He then launches a stinging attack on his Spurs team-mates and claims they have been picked despite playing 's***'</p>

<p>'Do you want me to be man of the match and give my best performance when I play one game and then I don't play again for three or four weeks?' he added.</p>

<p>'I wasn't good against Liverpool, it wasn't my best game, but other people have been s*** in training, s*** in games, but are in the squad every game. It's not fair.'</p>

<p>When Mourinho replied 'it's your perspective', a furious Rose started walking out of the room and demanded to speak to Levy.   </p>
