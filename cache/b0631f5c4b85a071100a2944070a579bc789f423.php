<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>World Athletics president and double Olympic champion Sebastian Coe has backed any athlete wishing to take a knee on the medal podium after the International Olympic Committee refused to budge on the matter.</p>

<p>Athletes in various sports have been using the gesture to protest against racism and police brutality against black people following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police officers back in May. </p>

<p>Premier League players still take the knee at kick-off of matches and Lewis Hamilton continues to protest with the gesture at Formula One races.</p>

<p>World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe has backed athletes wishing to take a knee on the podium</p>

<p>The IOC, led by president Thomas Bach, said 'kneeling' or 'hand gestures' at medal ceremonies were banned and could lead to disciplinary action</p>

<p>Tommie Smith (C) and John Carlos (R) protest with the Black Power salute at the 1968 Games</p>

<p>But rule 50 of the Olympic charter states that 'no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in January, the IOC also clarified that 'kneeling' or 'hand gestures' at medal ceremonies were banned and could lead to disciplinary action.</p>

<p>But during an interview with The Times, Coe, an IOC member, insisted he has 'no problem' with athletes taking the knee on the medal podium.</p>

<p>He said: 'I have been very clear — I have no problem with an athlete if they choose to take the knee on a podium, as long as it is done with respect and not in any way to damage the moment for the other two competitors.</p>

<p>'We are working with a small group of athletes and coaches on this, we have had the first discussions on this and we are going to understand a great deal more about how we can consistently and constructively support our competitors who feel very strongly on this issue.'</p>

<p>Coe also pointed to the influence that the 'black power' salutes of Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City had.</p>

<p>The 63-year-old former distance runner described that moment as a 'seminal and indelible moment' in sport, even though Smith and Carlos were expelled from the Games that summer.</p>

<p>Coe added: 'You cannot separate sport from the social and cultural processes.</p>

<p>Several sports moved to allow protests in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody</p>

<p>'Taking the knee' was pioneered by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick (centre) in 2016</p>

<p>'What happened in 1968 was part of what was going on in the Sixties. I think it was a very important and indelible moment in sport, and a really seminal moment in athletics.'</p>

<p>Earlier this month senior Olympic chief Dick Pound suggested taking a knee on a podium would be 'inarticulate' and that rules on protests should not be changed. </p>

<p>The longest-serving IOC member said: 'If somebody takes a knee, you'll never know if you're watching on TV or from the stands if it's actually about racial discrimination or about fluoride in the water. It's inarticulate.</p>

<p>'What if I win something and everybody else on the podium is rolling around in some kind of protest? That's not right either.</p>

<p>'There's a time and a place for everything. You have all kinds of human rights and you don't go shouting about those things at a church service or at a funeral.</p>

<p>'If you're asked to wait five or 10 minutes out of respect for your fellow athletes, your human rights really are not infringed.</p>

<p>'Your right to protest and draw attention to social issues is not abrogated. It just means you have to wait five minutes until the end of the ceremony and go to the press conference and say whatever you want.' </p>
