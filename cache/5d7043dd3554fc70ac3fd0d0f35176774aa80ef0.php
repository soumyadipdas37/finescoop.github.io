<p>'They would say I'd need to extract your tooth and wouldn't numb it properly. I could feel the roots coming out of my gums,' she added.</p>

<p>Jess went on to say:'My last experience was when I went a few weeks ago for the first time in 25 years because even the sound of the drill gets me sweaty.'</p>

<p>She said she still felt anxious visiting the dentist after her traumatising experience 25 years ago.</p>

<p>'The anxiety continues because when I finally did go to the dentist, I looked up at his face and he said "suction" to the nurse,' she explained. </p>

<p>Jess continued: 'And I thought he said "suck" and I started sucking on his finger and he said "what are you doing?"'</p>

<p>Jess said: '[My horror story with dentists started] in the school dental van. It was a caravan and all the trainee dentists would practice on you'</p>

<p>This comes after Jess revealed her and husband Norm Hogan have spent the entire $209,000 prize money they won on The Block just two years ago.</p>

<p>Speaking on Triple M's Moonman In The Morning on Friday, Jess revealed the couple blew the cash on swimming pools, gambling and 'helping out their friends'. </p>

<p>'The first thing we bought was two above-ground pools... and we handed them out to our friends like lollies,' she said. </p>

<p>Revealed: This comes after Jess revealed her and husband Norm Hogan have spent the entire $209,000 prize money they won on The Block just two years ago</p>

<p>'We just had friends who had been wanting a pool for ages... They're $5000 each, so there's $10,000,' she said.</p>

<p>Jess also revealed the couple spent a portion of the prize money betting on a tennis match between Maria Sharapova and Ash Barty.</p>

<p>She also revealed she and Norm paid off a friend's car loan, bought two lawnmowers and even bought a block of land in Queensland's Russell Island.</p>
