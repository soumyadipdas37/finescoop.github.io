<p>The scheme will apply to Queenslanders who will receive the discount on their next electricity bills, with some in regional areas already having their power bills reduced. </p>

<p>Another two million are expected to get the discount on their next electricity bill as a result of dividends from publicly-owned power assets in the state. </p>

<p>Tenants and electricity users who receive a bill from their landlord or body corporate will get the $50 bonus payment, as will those where card-operated electricity metres are used. </p>

<p>Another $50 bonus payment will also be distributed in 2021 in the same way, according to Energy Minister Dr Anthony Lynham. </p>

<p>'Queensland has the energy trifecta: lowest average prices on the eastern seaboard, reliable supply and a planned transition to a renewable future,' he said on Wednesday. </p>

<p>'Unlike other states, the dividends from our publicly-owned companies flow not to multinational shareholders overseas, but to Queensland families across the state.' </p>

<p>The dividends follow the Palaszczuk government's COVID household relief package, which provided Queensland households with $200 off their utility bills and $500 for small business.  </p>

<p>'Queensland has an economic strategy for recovery from the global coronavirus and it is important to help households pay their power bills during these tough times,' Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>

<p>'Because of our strong health response, we are able to get on with helping Queensland Unite and Recover in this post-COVID economy.'</p>

<p>The dividend payment already applied to some Ergon regional bills from last week and will be appearing progressively as people receive bills. </p>
