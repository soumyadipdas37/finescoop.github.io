<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chrissy Teigen is one of the most outspoken celebrities on social media who is not afraid to back down from a fight, even when it involves the president of the United States.</p>

<p>But underneath that grit is a soft soul, she told Marie Claire's Fall 2020 issue, which goes on newsstands September 10. That is why she has started therapy and is taking a break from social media.</p>

<p>'People think I'm tough, but I'm such an empath, and I take on other people's pain and sadness as my own. And when I let people down, I'm hyperaware of it,' said the beauty who is pregnant with her third child. 'Sometimes I feel like people aren't going to be as hard on me as I am on myself.'</p>

<p>She has a big heart: Chrissy Teigen is one of the most outspoken celebrities on social media who is not afraid to back down from a fight, even when it involves the president of the United States. But underneath that grit is a soft soul, she told Marie Claire 's Fall 2020 issue</p>

<p>That is why she has hit the pause button on social media.</p>

<p>'I'm barely online anymore, and that was at the request of my therapist,' says Teigen, who has over 43 million collective followers across Twitter and Instagram.</p>

<p>'So, it's good for me to take a break.'</p>

<p>The wife of John Legend - with whom she already has children Miles and Luna - also said that she started therapy while under quarantine.</p>

<p>Hard stuff: 'People think I'm tough, but I'm such an empath, and I take on other people's pain and sadness as my own. And when I let people down, I'm hyperaware of it,' said the beauty who is pregnant with her third child. 'Sometimes I feel like people aren't going to be as hard on me as I am on myself'</p>

<p>A break: And that means she is taking a break from social media. 'I'm barely online anymore, and that was at the request of my therapist,' says Teigen, who has over 43 million collective followers across Twitter and Instagram</p>

<p>'I didn't start therapy until quarantine. I used to avoid it and make fun of the idea of it, and then I found the person and it changed my world,' admitted the supermodel.</p>

<p>The cover girl, who was photographed by Lauren Dukoff, also used her interview as an opportunity to talk about racism in the US.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old author, model, and lifestyle entrepreneur relayed a scary story from 2010 with John.</p>

<p>Therapy is new: 'I didn't start therapy until quarantine. I used to avoid it and make fun of the idea of it, and then I found the person and it changed my world,' admitted the supermodel</p>

<p>Racism is still here: The cover girl, who was photographed by Lauren Dukoff, also used her interview as an opportunity to talk about racism in the US. The 34-year-old author, model, and lifestyle entrepreneur relayed a scary story from 2010 with John</p>

<p>'We were in a nicer neighborhood at night, driving slowly, looking for John's godmother's home. These two guys were in a pickup truck slowly tailing us, flashing their lights and trying to speak to us,' she said.</p>

<p>'When we pulled over, they were like, 'What are you guys looking for?' and we gave them the address.</p>

<p> 'They literally said, "Get your asses out of here!" and proceeded to follow us all the way into her driveway. They got out of the car and stared at us as we knocked on the door and went inside. It was a terrible, scary experience.'</p>

<p>And now the Victoria's Secret model has to teach her kids how to deal with the trauma black people are facing in the US.</p>

<p>Her little ones: Though she is not often on social media any longer she did post a shot of kids Miles and Luna in her kitchen this week</p>

<p>Worried about raising her kids in the US: 'There are books that I read when I became a mom that would explain to them hard and traumatic situations. But it's really hard to teach them about their privilege; there are no books for that. But regardless of money or status, they're always going to have their skin color,' she said</p>

<p>'There are books that I read when I became a mom that would explain to them hard and traumatic situations. But it's really hard to teach them about their privilege; there are no books for that. But regardless of money or status, they're always going to have their skin color,' added the cookbook author.</p>

<p>She wore red for her Marie Claire cover</p>

<p>Teigen added that when it comes to them being treated differently because of the color of their skin, she is going to look to John for 'a lot of help with that' because while they are 'Asian and white too, their skin color is Black.'</p>

<p>'We just try to talk to them like little adults, saying it in words they'll understand, making it known that it's very serious, and letting them ask as many questions as they need,' she said.</p>

<p>And Chrissy, who has long expressed her dislike of Trump, was happy to reveal she is voting for Biden.  </p>

<p>'We are proud to stand behind Biden,' said the Vogue model.</p>

<p>'We're not only voting for Biden because it's not Trump. We're voting for him because we think he's going to do an incredible job of bringing a bit of healing to the country. We are a divided, hurt nation that needs to be brought back together. </p>

<p>Chrissy also likes that he has 'empathy, and under- standing.'</p>

<p>And she then explained: 'I also look at a presidential candidate as someone I want my kids to be able to look up to. I don't see that in Donald Trump or any of his family.'  </p>

<p>Happy at last: The stars seen here on social media in August; they wed in 2013 in Italy</p>

<p>The choice of Kamala Harris as a Vice President pick also pleases her: 'I could not be more thrilled about Biden's VP pick! </p>

<p>'Women all over the world are seeing a piece of them in a woman of power, and that kind of influence is paramount in what we need to continue this future of badass women in politics. Between people like Kamala and AOC, I have more hope than ever.'</p>

<p>Teigen doesn't only model. She has Cravings by Chrissy Teigen and Suit &amp; Thai Productions, her production company, which has a first-look deal with Hulu, and the second season of Quibi series Chrissy's Court with her mom, Pepper.  </p>
