<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign officially smashed American political fundraising records, raising $364.5 million in one month. </p>

<p>The Biden campaign put out the August total Wednesday morning, after The New York Times reported Tuesday that the former vice president and the Democratic Party raised more than $300 million and then Bloomberg reported the total topped $350 million. </p>

<p>President Barack Obama held the record for the best one-month haul, raising $193 million in September 2008.  </p>

<p>Vice President Joe Biden and the Democrats raised $364.5 million in the month of August, shattering American political fundraising records </p>

<p>Joe Biden's fundraising haul comes the same week that many of President Donald Trump's television ads were taken off the airwaves, as his campaign is in a brief money-saving mode </p>

<p>The Biden campaign said that $205 million raised in August, amounting to 57 per cent, came from online, small-dollar donations. </p>

<p>Additionally, 1.5 million donors in August were first-time givers. </p>

<p>The campaign reported that their donor base amounts to more than 4 million Americans.  </p>

<p>Biden announced the numbers to supporters Wednesday morning remarking, 'That figure blows me away.' </p>

<p>'Even in a global recession, working families set aside some money to power this campaign, and a little bit added up in a big way,' he said.  </p>

<p>But he warned that Trump and the Republicans will be bolstered by 'outside, dark money.'  </p>

<p>'And you better believe they will pour it all into attacks and smears against me, against Kamala, and against our campaign,' Biden said.   </p>

<p>August marked Biden's announcement of running mate, Kamala Harris, a California senator who had run her own bid for president before dropping out in December. </p>

<p>With the pick of Harris, Biden made history by adding the first woman of color to a presidential ticket. </p>

<p>Later in the month, Democrats had their four-night Democratic National Convention, which was held virtually from studios around the country, as the coronavirus pandemic prevented delegates, party leaders and journalists from gathering in person in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. </p>

<p>The campaign previously announced it had raised $48 million in the two days following the vice presidential announcement. </p>

<p>It also said it raised $70 million after the convention. </p>

<p>The Times also reported that ActBlue, Democrats' main donation platform, reported raising $35 million alone on Monday, the final day of the month.   </p>

<p>Earlier Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that President Donald Trump had pulled most of his advertising from TV airwaves, as Biden recently outspent the incumbent by ten-fold.  </p>

<p>The Trump campaign has been burning through money almost as soon as donations come in. </p>

<p>Biden, on the other hand, has a leaner campaign, allowing him to catch up to the long-held Republican and Trump financial advantage. </p>

<p>The Trump TV ads were pulled, according to the AP, because the Trump campaign was trying to conserve money.  </p>

<p>At the beginning of the month, Biden and the Democrats had $294 million, while Trump and the Republicans started the month with $300 million.  </p>

<p>In July, Biden and the Democrats had raised $140 million, while Trump and the Republicans earned $165 million.     </p>

<p>The Trump campaign and the Republican National Convention's August numbers have yet to be released.  </p>
