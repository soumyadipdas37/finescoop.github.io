<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>For over a decade, The Surf Lodge in Montauk, New York has been a favorite celebrity hot spot, where Hollywood stars, influencers, and socialites could be eating and partying.</p>

<p>But with the COVID-19 pandemic, the beach hotel and restaurant has been forced to undergo a bit of rebranding, transforming from party central to wellness retreat.</p>

<p>According to the New York Post, the getaway spot is now being sold not on packed summer concerts and buzzed nights out but meditation, yoga, and wellness.</p>

<p>Popular: The Surf Lodge in Montauk, New York has been a favorite celebrity hot spot, where Hollywood stars, influencers, and socialites could be eating and partying</p>

<p>But with the COVID-19 pandemic, the beach hotel and restaurant has been forced to undergo a bit of rebranding, transforming from party central to wellness retreat</p>

<p>The getaway spot is now being sold not on packed summer concerts and buzzed nights out but meditation, yoga, and wellness</p>

<p>Diners on their famous 5,000-square-foot-deck must now be guests of the hotel</p>

<p>One of the Surf Lodge's highlights of summers past was its annual concert series, which in the past few years have included live performances by the likes of John Legend, DJ Cassidy, Jessie J, Lupe Fiasco, Janelle Monáe, and Jaden Smith.</p>

<p>The shows and exclusive atmosphere have attracted plenty of celebrity guests — including Tiffany Trump and Joe Biden's granddaughter Naomi, who enjoyed that Jaden Smith performance together in 2018.</p>

<p>Model Nina Agdal met her boyfriend, Christie Brinkley's son Jack Brinkey-Cook, at Surf Lodge, while Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson had a date night there last summer.</p>

<p>Other visitors have included Rosario Dawson, Claire Danes, Solange, Jon Bon Jovi, Khloe Kardashian, Taylor Swift, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Malia Obama, who celebrated her 20th birthday there in 2018. </p>

<p>Star power: The popular Hamptons spot is a favorite among celebrities like Christie Brinkley and her daughter Sailor Brinkley-Cook (pictured in 2019)</p>

<p>Night out: In 2018, Tiffany Trump was photographed watching Jaden Smith's Wold Oceans Day performance at The Surf Lodge with Joe Biden's granddaughter Naomi</p>

<p>Fun weekend: Tiffany shared snapshots of herself with Andrew and a picture from the concert</p>

<p>But crowded concerts and packed cocktail hours are off the menu for 2020, so owner Jayma Cordoso has — at least for now — rebranded.   </p>

<p>'It’s detox and retox,' Cardoso said. 'We were a place to party and now we’re more of a cute little bed and breakfast. </p>

<p>'Brands and companies are moving towards smaller getaways where people can focus on health and wellness, including mental health, which is now more important than ever.'</p>

<p>That means that the 5,000-square-foot-deck is no longer packed with partiers, but used to serve food and drinks at tables spaced at a social distance — and only overnight guests are allowed to dine.</p>

<p>Change: But crowded concerts and packed cocktail hours are off the menu for 2020, so owner Jayma Cordoso has — at least for now — rebranded</p>

<p>Must-haves: Acupuncture and massage by The Yinova Center are on the menu, and in-room mini bars are filled with vegan supplements, lip balms, Vitamin C packs and hand sanitizer</p>

<p>Looks dangerous! Gone are the crowds that could be found there in years past</p>

<p>Instead of live musical performances, the space is now used for various wellness programs like meditation and yoga — the latter led by Cristina Cuomo and Erika Halwell. </p>

<p>Acupuncture and massage by The Yinova Center are also on the menu, and in-room mini bars are filled with vegan supplements, lip balms, Vitamin C packs and hand sanitizer.</p>

<p>Other offerings include skincare masks, juices by plant-based chef Adam Kenworthy, and yes, alcohol.  </p>

<p>'Alcohol has been proven to be healthy for the body in moderation — two drinks a night for men and one for women,' Kenworthy said. 'Having a drink is a celebration. It’s a great way to wind down at the end of the day. Everything we serve is clean and organic, from the mixers to the wines.' </p>

<p>Music: One of the Surf Lodge's highlights of summers past was its annual concert series, which in the past few years have included live performances by the likes of John Legend, DJ Cassidy, Jessie J, Lupe Fiasco, Janelle Monáe, and Jaden Smith</p>

<p>Pricey: Packages typically cost between $10,000 to $25,000 for up to 18 people for three days and have sold out through the end of the season (pictured: Molly Sims in 2019)</p>

<p>All of this will cost. The Surf Lodge has just 21 rooms, and corporate retreats are filling a lot of the bookings. Those typically cost between $10,000 to $25,000 for up to 18 people for three days.</p>

<p>The destination is also extending its season to October and is 'fully sold out.'   </p>

<p>'I don’t know if we’ll ever go back to the old days,' Cordoso said. 'I think people’s perceptions have changed dramatically about larger crowds, and hugging and kissing. I am Brazilian, and l am very loving, hugging and kissing, and now I am very much elbowing people.' </p>

<p>As for their summer concerts, The Surf Lodge didn't actually ditch them altogether: The venue held virtual Memorial Day and Labor Day events that were free to those who tuned in.</p>
