<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Novak Djokovic admits he was right to be disqualified from the US Open for hitting a line judge but has refused to promise the shocking moment will never happen again in his career.</p>

<p>The world number one spoke at a press conference in Rome for the first time since he was dramatically ejected from the year's second grand slam for hitting a line judge in the throat with a ball struck in annoyance.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Djokovic said: 'Of course it was a shock to finish the US Open the way things finished for me. Of course it could have happened earlier in my career, it could have happened to many players.</p>

<p>World number one Novak Djokovic has accepted his US Open disqualification last month</p>

<p>'It was just unfortunate it did hit the line umpire in an unfortunate place. There was a lot of speculation about whether it was deserved. I accepted it, I moved on.</p>

<p>'I cannot promise or cannot guarantee that I will never ever do anything similar to that in my life. I'm going to try my best, obviously, but anything is possible in life.' </p>

<p>Line judge Laura Clark collapsed to the ground and could be heard gasping for breath.</p>

<p>Djokovic continued: 'I felt really sorry to cause the shock and drama to her. I felt very good about myself, my game. It was totally unexpected and very unintended but, when you hit the ball like that, you have a chance to hit somebody that is on the court.</p>

<p>'I accepted it and I had to move on. Of course I didn't forget about it, I don't think I'll ever forget about it.'</p>

<p>The upside for Djokovic was that it gave him more time to prepare on clay for this week's Italian Open and the French Open starting on September 27.</p>

<p>Djokovic was booted out of the US Open for striking a line judge in the throat with a ball</p>

<p>Djokovic said: 'I don't think I'll have any major issues coming back to the tour and being able to perform well. I have my first chance here in Rome.</p>

<p>'It's great I think I have a tournament a week or 10 days after it happened because I feel the earlier I get back in competition mode the faster I'll overcome the memory and re-programme it. I'm hoping for the best.</p>

<p>'I spent some time with my family and I looked at my shoulder that I hurt a little bit when I fell down. It's OK for now so I'm going to be playing Rome and hopefully getting far here.'        </p>
