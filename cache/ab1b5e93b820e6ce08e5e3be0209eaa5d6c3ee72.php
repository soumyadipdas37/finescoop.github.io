<p>Killer curves: Jordyn Woods looked sensational in a racy Dior bikini on Friday, as she continued to enjoy her sun-filled birthday getaway in Cabo with her beau Karl Anthony-Towns</p>

<p>While the Kardashian-Jenner family cut ties with Woods after she shared a drunken kiss with Khloé's boyfriend Tristan Thompson in 2019, the 5ft9in beauty still appeared to be deeply influenced by their distinctive style. </p>

<p>In fact, the Trigger actress' eye-catching bikini was first worn by Kim Kardashian on an all-girls vacation at Casa Aramara in Puna Mita in April 2017. </p>

<p>Woods' recreated look appears to be more of a coincidence than an olive branch, however, as she recently reflected on finding self-worth after feeling undervalued.   </p>

<p>Coincidence? Woods' eye-catching bikini was first worn by Kim Kardashian on an all-girls vacation at Casa Aramara in Puna Mita in April 2017 </p>

<p>'By the time they realize your worth, you’ll be worth more,' she captioned two snaps of herself on Instagram, just weeks after it was confirmed Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson have romantically rekindled. </p>

<p>Last year, Woods blamed her kiss with the NBA star on being 'blackout drunk' and nothing more than a 'stupid' mistake, an insider told TMZ. </p>

<p>More than a year after the fall-out from the indiscretion, she has 'had a stint on a TV show' and is continuing to work hard.  </p>

<p>Moving on: Woods' recreated look appears to be more of a coincidence than an olive branch, as earlier this week she reflected on being properly appreciated and her self-worth</p>

<p>A source furthered noted to People, 'She's not doing too, too much, but is staying busy.'</p>

<p>After the scandal came out into the public, the model was quick to appear on Jada Pinkett-Smith's red table talk to speak about what had gone down from her side. </p>

<p>During her appearance on the Facebook series, she admitted to kissing Tristan, though she claimed that it wasn't 'intimate.'  </p>

<p>She also broke down during the interview, saying she was 'no homewrecker' and denied being that the reason Khloé and Tristan's initially split.</p>

<p>Tristan, who shares a two-year-old daughter with Kardashian, has never publicly addressed his side of the cheating scandal. </p>

<p>Connections gone wrong: Jordyn was previously the best friend of Kylie Jenner before she was caught kissing Khloe Kardashian's boyfriend and baby daddy, Tristan Thompson </p>

<p>On Wednesday, Woods looked happier than ever, as she enjoyed an afternoon on a  massive yacht with friends, family and new love interest Karl-Anthony. </p>

<p>She couldn't stop smiling, as she wore a white jersey with the legendary basketball player's number embroidered in red. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Karl-Anthony wore a matching bright red jersey with black shorts to take in the scenery off the Baja peninsula.</p>

<p>Additionally, he shared a snap of himself wrapping his arm around her on social media and grabbing her behind in another shot. </p>
