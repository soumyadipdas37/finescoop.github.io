<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tens of thousands of people with so-called 'long Covid' have had symptoms of illness for more than three months, new reports suggest.</p>

<p>Professor Tim Spector, who is leading the Covid Symptom Study app, said that 60,000 people have been ill for more than three months.</p>

<p>While some people have a mild form of illness, others have been seriously affected.</p>

<p>People affected with long-term symptoms have described how they have been previously fit and healthy and now they are confined to a wheelchair.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people with so-called 'long Covid' have had symptoms of illness for more than three months, leaving some people bedridden or wheelchair-bound</p>

<p>Breathlessness and fatigue have been reported by long-term sufferers and some have described how doing shopping or climbing stairs can leave them bed-ridden for days.</p>

<p>Prof Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, told BBC Radio 4's File On 4 that data from the app shows that around 300,000 people have reported symptoms lasting for more than a month - so called 'long Covid'.</p>

<p>Up to 60,000 people reported having symptoms for more than three months.</p>

<p>On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that some people were still experiencing symptoms six months after contracting the virus.</p>

<p>Prof Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, told BBC Radio 4's File On 4 that data from the app shows that around 300,000 people have reported symptoms lasting for more than a month</p>

<p>Speaking on LBC radio, Mr Hancock said: 'Long Covid, where people six months on are still ill, is prevalent among younger people.'</p>

<p>But Professor Spector said he is 'frustrated' that data from the app is not being more widely used.</p>

<p>'There's a big danger these (people) might end up being forgotten,' he told File On 4. </p>

<p>The Royal College of GPs has said there should be a national network of clinics to help people who need care and rehabilitation after Covid. </p>

<p>File on 4 asked clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and health boards across the UK whether they had set up post-Covid clinics for patients who were not admitted to hospital with the virus.</p>

<p>Of the 86 who responded, 10 said they were already running such facilities. A further 16 said they were planning or redesigning services.</p>

<p>Many patients will be seen by their GP, or existing services.</p>

<p>However, for those not tested for coronavirus or with a negative result, receiving help has proven difficult.</p>

<p>Elly MacDonald, 37, from Surbiton, south-west London, was training for the London Marathon when she developed Covid symptoms on 21 March.</p>

<p>But five months later, she is still suffering from breathlessness and extreme fatigue but has not received a positive test result.</p>

<p>She changed her GP practice after feeling she wasn’t being helped.</p>

<p>Persistent health problems following acute disease have included:</p>

<p>Respiratory symptoms and conditions such as chronic cough, shortness of breath;</p>

<p>Lung problems including inflammation and scarring;</p>

<p>Heart issues including chest tightness, heart failure and scarring;</p>

<p>Protracted loss or change of smell and taste;</p>

<p>Mental health problems including depression, anxiety and cognitive difficulties;</p>

<p>Inflammatory disorders such as muscle pain;</p>

<p>Gastrointestinal problems;</p>

<p>Continuing headaches; </p>

<p>Fatigue, weakness and sleeplessness; liver and kidney dysfunction;</p>

<p>Clotting disorders and thrombosis; </p>

<p>Problems with the lymph nodes and skin rashes.</p>

<p>'Just knowing that I actually have people who are taking me seriously … that’s been very important for my recovery,' she told The Guardian. 'I just want my life back.'</p>

<p>NHS England's new Your Covid Recovery website offers personalised support for all patients recovering from Covid.</p>

<p>Lynne Turner Stokes, professor of rehabilitation medicine at King's College London, told File On 4 the website had some 'good resources' but that 'we have to do much more'.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the NHS in England said: 'At the same time as treating more than 108,000 coronavirus patients and keeping other vital services running throughout the pandemic, the NHS has played a leading role in patient recovery and scientific discovery which is saving lives here and around the world.</p>

<p>'While experts globally continue work to understand more about the short and long-term impact of this new disease, NHS teams are rapidly expanding aftercare and support to all patients who need it.</p>

<p>'This includes new and strengthened rehab centres and community services providing tailored treatment in every part of the country, such as the first of its kind Seacole centre, and a new online health advice and support platform, which patients said they wanted to help them recover at home.'</p>

<p>It comes as new guidance published on the Government website sets out some of the long-term health effects for some people who have had Covid-19.</p>

<p>The guidance states that around 10% of mild coronavirus cases who were not admitted to hospital have reported symptoms lasting more than 4 weeks.</p>

<p>And a number of people admitted to hospital reported continuing symptoms for eight or more weeks following discharge.</p>
