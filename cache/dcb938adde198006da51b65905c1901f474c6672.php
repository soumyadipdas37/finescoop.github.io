<p>Controversial: singer Joss Stone, 33, discusses the over-prescription of medicines for treatments such as depression and anxiety in the latest episode of her podcast A Cuppa Happy</p>

<p>Speaking about Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the star added she believes drug companies like to give names to people's feelings so they can create drugs and make 'millions'.</p>

<p>The condition is a behavioural disorder that includes symptoms such as inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness and is often diagnosed in childhood.</p>

<p>In the discussion about treatments that don't involve drugs, Stone said she wants everyone to go into the woods and 'hug a tree' to feed their soul rather than using medicines prescribed by doctors.</p>

<p>Stone, who has also chatted to Boy George and Derren Brown for her podcast, is heard saying: '[I know] There are people that do have those [problems] in a big way and there are some people that just need a diagnosis but there are issues that are quite physical and issues that are mental.</p>

<p>'If somebody is upset about something it's probably because something upsetting has happened, its not because you have this ailment that you need to take drugs for.</p>

<p>'That makes me sound incredibly insensitive but you have to decide that's not who you are. You have to take that on as you.'</p>

<p>The British singer-songwriter also claimed that children diagnosed with ADHD actually just have a lot of energy.</p>

<p>The latest episode sees Stone discussing mental health with Wim Hoff, who teaches breathing techniques to enhance wellbeing</p>

<p>The singer, who recorded the latest episode of her A Cuppa Happy podcast in the Bahamas, is heard saying that children in the US are often given drugs for ADHD, when they could just 'have energy' because they're children</p>

<p>She said: 'Here in America, I notice they give a lot of drugs to children that are running around a lot.</p>

<p>'And the kids will run around and break things and kick things so they take their kids to the doctors, and they'll say 'oh well he's got ADHD'</p>

<p>'It's a lot of b*******. I just think no he has actually just got energy because he is a child.'</p>

<p>While it is normal to feel down from time to time, people with depression may feel persistently unhappy for weeks or months on end.</p>

<p>Depression can affect anyone at any age and is fairly common – approximately one in ten people are likely to experience it at some point in their life. </p>

<p>Depression is a genuine health condition which people cannot just ignore or 'snap out of it'.</p>

<p>Symptoms and effects vary, but can include constantly feeling upset or hopeless, or losing interest in things you used to enjoy.</p>

<p>It can also cause physical symptoms such as problems sleeping, tiredness, having a low appetite or sex drive, and even feeling physical pain.</p>

<p>In extreme cases it can lead to suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>Traumatic events can trigger it, and people with a family history may be more at risk.</p>

<p>It is important to see a doctor if you think you or someone you know has depression, as it can be managed with lifestyle changes, therapy or medication. </p>

<p>She admitted she sounded like a conspiracy theorist but urged people to go into the woods and hug trees rather than going to see their doctors.</p>

<p>Stone continued: 'They [the pharmaceutical companies] will say 'everyone is upset let's give it a name and then we can create a drug and then we can charge the world millions'.</p>

<p>'It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but I do like to think that the guys who make those pills genuinely want people to feel better, I do like to think that.</p>

<p>The British singer revealed that she was considering an arranged marriage before she met her current partner after watching reality TV matchmaking shows</p>

<p>'I don't know how true that is, but that's how I choose to think about those people because I like to think well about people.</p>

<p>'But I do think it would be better if everybody would just go into nature and hug a tree and be happy and decide to feed your soul.'</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the singer admitted she was close to resorting to an arranged marriage because she couldn't find love.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old confessed she started considering arranged marriages before meeting current boyfriend Cody.</p>

<p>The Super Duper Love songstress has previously dated men in the music industry but said before her current partner she 'couldn't find a man'.</p>
