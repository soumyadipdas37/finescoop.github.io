<p>In the clip the Manchester United striker, 18, can be seen filling up a balloon with nitrous oxide - also known as nos - from a whipped-cream charger.</p>

<p>He then lifts an inflated balloon to his mouth.</p>

<p>Greenwood - who was seen with a female friend in the clip - has since 'strongly urged' young fans not to follow in his footsteps.</p>

<p>It comes after Greenwood and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden, 20, were sent home from the England senior team for breaking strict Covid-19 protocols.</p>

<p>The pair invited Icelandic girls back to their hotel after making their senior Three Lions debuts. </p>

<p>Nos, also known as laughing gas, is a gas called nitrous oxide which people inhale to get high.</p>

<p>The drug is used by chefs to make whipped cream so is easy to buy. </p>

<p>People inhaling the drug usually do so by filling a balloon with it and breathing it in over the course of a minute or so.</p>

<p> The drug can produce a feeling of euphoria, lead to laughing or fits of giggles, cause hallucinations, and distort the sounds people hear.</p>

<p>Its effects are usually short-lived but it can cause much longer lasting health damage.</p>

<p>Because breathing it in essentially replaces the air you breathe with the drug, there is a risk of suffocation. People may also pass out because of the lack of oxygen. </p>

<p>Inhaling nitrous oxide can also lead to severe headaches, dizziness, paranoia or stop you being able to think straight.</p>

<p>It can also become addictive and, over time, lead to a vitamin B12 deficiency which can cause nerve damage in the hands and feet. Long-term use can also stop the body producing white blood cells effectively, damaging the immune system.</p>

<p>Both players apologised - only for Greenwood to issue a second apology after The Sun shared pictures of him appearing to inhale from the nos-filled balloon.  </p>

<p>It is illegal to sell or give away Nos for recreational uses, but there is no penalty for possession. It is widely available because it's used by chefs to make whipped cream.</p>

<p>In the clip Greenwood uses a Smartwhip charger.</p>

<p>The device is full of nitrous oxide which is in turn used by chefs or cooking enthusiasts in their whipped cream dispensers.</p>

<p>A source told the paper: 'Mason often goes to the apartment after nights out and likes to have a good time.</p>

<p>'But he should know better given he's a top sportsman.'</p>

<p>In a statement via Manchester United, he said: 'I strongly urge others not to follow my example.</p>

<p>'As an 18 year old I am learning all the time. However this week I've also learned that I will be judged to a higher standard because of my career, and I must respect that in future.</p>

<p> 'I am determined to repay the faith shown in me by my manager and coaches.'</p>

<p>They said he 'has learned a few hard lessons recently and this could be another one'.</p>

<p>Icelandic beauty queen Nadia Gunnsarsdottir, 20, yesterday revealed how she got 'heated' with Greenwood after he polished off a bag of jelly babies.</p>

<p>Ms Gunnsarsdottir said the pair met a day after the 18-year-old made his England debut in Reykjavik - having matched on a dating app. </p>

<p>She told The Sun about the night she spent with the teenage football star, while her cousin, Lara Clausen, 19, romped with Foden next door at the Radisson Blu Saga hotel in Iceland. </p>

<p>Icelandic beauty queen Nadia Gunnarsdottir said things got heated with the 'shy' England and Manchester United striker moments after he eat an entire pack of jelly babies</p>

<p>Ms Gunnsarsdottir told The Sun the players asked her cousin to bring sweets to their hotel room. </p>

<p>She claimed staff had thrown out two other girls for trying to meet players. </p>

<p>It's claimed she did not know who the Manchester United forward was when he contacted her on a dating app on September 5 - hours after  he played as a s substitute during England's 1-0 over Iceland in the Nations League. </p>

<p>The pair continued to speak the next day, when Greenwood it was his last night in Iceland and he could not leave the hotel. </p>

<p>She booked herself a room at the hotel, and when Greenwood went to her hotel room, he was joined by Foden, who has a child with Rebecca Cooke.</p>

<p>When Greenwood asked if she had a friend, Ms Gunnsarsdottir asked her cousin to return, mentioning the player's request to bring sweets along too.</p>

<p>Ms Gunnsarsdottir said Foden never mentioned his daughter or a partner. </p>

<p>Greenwood reportedly turned up at Ms Gunnsarsdottir's hotel room with Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden, 20</p>

<p>Ms Gunnsarsdottir told the paper: 'We all chilled together. Mason ate virtually the whole packet of Tritlar and Phil had some too.</p>

<p>'We all got along and were in my room just chatting, laughing and joking. Phil was open and outgoing but Mason was quite shy.</p>

<p>She said things got heated after she kissed Mason, adding: 'He was certainly not as shy physically as he was socially.'</p>

<p>Both players apparently complained about Iceland, saying they found it boring, while Foden reportedly held a mock-interview on his phone asking the women what it's like to live on the Scandinavian island.  </p>

<p>Ms Gunnsarsdottir called her cousin, Lara Clausen, 19, after Greenwood asked if she a friend to spend the night with Foden</p>

<p>Both players returned to their floor at around 3am, while Foden kissed both girls as he left, Ms Gunnsarsdottir claims Mason left with a simple 'bye'.</p>

<p>She claims her and her cousin were awoken at 6am by England's Head of security, a Covid-19 officer and a security guard at hotel, storming into their room looking for the players. </p>

<p>Mentioning she felt sorry for the players, Ms Gunnsarsdottir said she and her cousin were irresponsible, as were the two young England stars. </p>
