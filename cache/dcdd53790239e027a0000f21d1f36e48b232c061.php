<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>As the weather starts to get a little colder now is the perfect time to invest in a new pair of slippers- particularly if yours took a beating during lockdown.</p>

<p>Cosy sheepskin slippers are a firm favourite in the cooler months, but if you're unwilling to spend £80 on the iconic UGG Scuffette, then you're in luck as the Misolin Women's Slipper is being hailed by Amazon shoppers as an affordable dupe. </p>

<p>Now only £13.99 on Amazon, the Misolin slippers are being snapped up by customers who describe the slip-on style slippers as 'extremely warm and comfy', 'absolute quality, especially for the price' and how they 'look very similar to more expensive Uggs'. </p>

<p>The £13.99 Misolin Women's Slipper with memory foam are being snapped up in a range of colours and sizes </p>

<p>The Misolin Women's Slippers have caught the attention of hundreds of Amazon shoppers, thanks to their impressive quality and incredibly comfortable fit. In fact, the memory foam slippers have caused a bit of a storm among reviewers online, with many comparing the style to UGG's Scuffette- but with a far more reasonable price tag. </p>

<p>With over 1,700 reviews on Amazon, the slippers are a popular buy for those looking for cosy, fluffy slippers and, currently priced at £13.99; they're a real bargain too. </p>

<p>Out of the reviews left for the Misolin Women's Slippers, there are plenty that has compared the quality to that of £80 UGG slippers. </p>

<p>'This fits a little large however, its still cosy and an absolute bargain for the price for it. I cannot live without these slippers. The memory foam makes it feel like you're stepping on clouds, and the colour is super chic!' they went on to write 'They are like UGG slippers but for a bargain price! They are lasting really well!.'</p>

<p>Another customer even compared the quality to that of the more expensive pair, writing: 'My wife had a pair of Ugg slippers which after no time at all started to fall apart. We decided against getting another pair and bought these instead which for the price were brilliant and long outlasted the much more expensive pair.'</p>

<p>The slipper has a thick fluffy design to keep your feet warm and comfortable around the house</p>

<p>As the slippers are made out of synthetic fur, they're perhaps not as luxurious as more expensive brands that use sheepskin lining which also has the added benefit of keeping your feet at body temperature.</p>

<p>However, shoppers have still agreed that the Misolin slippers are super soft, and thanks to the memory foam lining create a supportive base for your feet.  </p>

<p>'These slippers are great! Soft and comfy, and most importantly, my feet are warm. The sole is sturdy without being too chunky and works well on both wood floors and carpet. The memory foam inside soles are still keeping their shape and bounce after three weeks of use, so I'm hoping that will last.'</p>

<p>Another happy customer wrote: 'Lovely soft, plush slippers' they then added 'Memory foam footbed is very comfortable and cosy, faux sheepskin wraps your foot inside and almost to the side of your heel area. Not overly hot, but keeps feet warm. Very pleased with them and would recommend to anyone.'</p>
