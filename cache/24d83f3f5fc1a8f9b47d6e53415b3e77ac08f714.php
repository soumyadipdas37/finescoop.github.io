<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Residents of an idyllic village dating from the 12th century claim it is being ‘destroyed’ by a Kazakh oligarch.</p>

<p>Nurlan Bizakov wants to build an estate of more than 200 homes in East Hoathly in East Sussex.</p>

<p>But some of the 1,600 locals say he is damaging the character of their historic home.</p>

<p>Mr Bizakov built his fortune in his homeland after hiring armed ‘mercenaries’ to storm his former offices at an oil refinery and get his job back – even though he had resigned in the first place.</p>

Bizakov launched himself on the European racing scene not long after becoming the majority owner of £100m firm Kazphosphate in 2007. He now wants to build a 205-house estate in East Hoathly against the objections of residents who say it will damage the town's historic charm.

<p>He then went on to make huge amounts in phosphorous and phosphates there, claiming his business was worth £1billion. Over the past decade he has become a major figure in British horse racing, setting records with his lavish spending.</p>

<p>But it is his purchase of the 400-acre Hesmonds Stud farm that has brought him into his latest battle.</p>

<p>Residents of East Hoathly welcomed the takeover, but then he made applications to build housing estates on the ‘equestrian’ land – while shifting his focus to another stud farm he bought in Normandy last year. </p>

<p>Then he won permission to build 205 houses against the will of hundreds of local objectors. </p>

<p>East Hoathly locals initially welcomed Bizakov's investment in the area but now want to mount a legal challenge against his plans, which were approved by Wealden District Council in July. Campaigner Jonathan Walker, front left, said: 'A development of this size would destroy a unique village which has been around for more than 1,000 years.' </p>

<p>There are only around 500 homes in the village and locals say there are plans for 200 more on other fields.</p>

<p>Campaigner Jonathan Walker said: ‘Everyone thought Mr Bizakov was great because he invested millions. [But] a development of this size would destroy a unique village which has been around for more than 1,000 years. </p>

<p>'He built a modern Bond-style mansion and has remained hidden away. It seems only a matter of time until he disappears off to France and takes with him the millions made by devastating this historic rural community.’</p>

<p>Mr Bizakov’s application was approved by Wealden District Council in July. Campaigners wish to mount a legal challenge – but Mr Bizakov’s past would suggest he is unlikely to compromise.</p>

<p>Bizakov owns what was described as a 'Bond style mansion', pictured above, in East Hoathly. Locals fear it seems only a matter of time until he leaves for France, where he has a second stud farm in Normandy. The 400-acre Hesmonds Stud farm in the historic village is set to be developed into a 205-home estate, nearly doubling the number of dwellings there.</p>

<p>In 2000, he resigned as chairman and manager of the Shymkent Oil Refinery after former Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev’s government began supporting moves against foreign investors.</p>

<p>He then called for the firm to be renationalised and won a court judgment allowing him to take his job back. Mr Bizakov entered by force – accompanied by soldiers from the Kazakh internal affairs ministry. He denied taking orders from Mr Nazarbayev.</p>

<p>The BBC reported: ‘Special task force soldiers ensured Bizakov’s passage by overcoming... company guards and breaking down the main door.’ </p>

<p>Canadian executive Marlo Thomas regained control with his own security team.</p>

<p>A few years later, Mr Bizakov became the majority owner of firm Kazphosphate, leading its purchase for £100million in 2007. Not long after, he launched himself on European racing. </p>

<p>He declined to comment on the planning row. </p>
