<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Student unions have come under fire for mounting 'an assault on free speech' while costing the taxpayer millions each year.  </p>

<p>Sombreros, beef, clapping and cowboy outfits are just a few of the things to have been banned in recent years by 'woke' students across the country. </p>

<p>Blacklisting types of food and dress, censoring language and no-platforming controversial speakers have been highlighted in a new report advocating a shake-up of how these unions operate.</p>

<p>The research by the Adam Smith Institute found that student unions cost taxpayers and students £165million per annum - an average of £75 per student a year.</p>

<p>Yet despite students being forced to be members of these bodies, dissatisfaction is high with only one in ten actively participating in elections.</p>

<p>It has led to criticism that student unions are pursuing illiberal and authoritarian policies thought to command little support from their members.    </p>

<p>Sombreros, beef and clapping are just a few of the things to have been banned in recent years by 'woke' students across the country</p>

<p>Blacklisting types of food and dress (such as cowboy outfits), censoring language and no-platforming controversial speakers have been highlighted in a new report advocating a shake-up of how these unions operate</p>

<p>Examples of language being censored by students include banning the 'harmful' phrase 'as you know' at Bath University and Rudyard Kipling's classic poem 'If' at Manchester in 2018.</p>

<p>In 2014, UCL Students' Union banned its Nietzsche Society after it put up posters stating 'Equality is a False God' while in 2016 gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell was described as 'transphobic' in a no-platforming row at Canterbury Christ Church.</p>

<p>The authors of the report 'State of the Unions' argue that: 'This agenda has made many students, including Jewish students, Christians, conservatives, and traditional feminists, feel uncomfortable on campus.'</p>

<p>In recent months, beef bans have become increasingly popular at universities like the LSE and Goldsmiths while fancy dress parties are also facing a clampdown.</p>

<p>In February Oxford University SU banned vicars and tarts parties for fear of their impact on 'marginalised communities'.</p>

<p>And earlier this month Aberystwyth Student Union banned parties held on a drag theme on the grounds that they 'make a mockery' of the transgender experience.</p>

<p>In recent months, beef bans have become increasingly popular at universities (Edinburgh petition pictured)</p>

<p>Cambridge SU banned their Officer Training Corps from displaying firearms in February – having previously blocked a motion promoting Remembrance Sunday last year.</p>

<p>Former Chancellor Sajid Javid said of the findings: 'In Student Unions across the UK, an intolerant minority is seeking to silence those they disagree with under the banner of no-platforming and safe spaces.</p>

<p>'Their campaign of censorship is an assault on one of our most precious and fundamental rights – freedom of speech.</p>

<p>'Championing students by protecting legal free speech should be one of the higher education sector's top priorities.'</p>

<p>The report aims to address these problems by adopting the old Scottish model, still in operation at Glasgow University, in which functions are separated into a student union providing the social activities, a sports association, and a student representative council.</p>

<p>Sajid Javid said student unions are mounting 'an assault on freedom of speech'</p>

<p>Robert Halfon MP, Chairman of the House of Commons Education Committee has welcomed the proposals and said they deserve 'careful consideration.'</p>

<p>Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: 'This report raises serious concerns about the funding and operation of student unions. </p>

<p>'For instance £160m could support a lot of bursaries. It is vital students have a voice but the report highlights there are also issues around the extent to which student unions represent student cohorts and their needs.'</p>

<p>NUS President Larissa Kennedy said: 'This report is filled with outright lies and errors from its outset about the funding of Students' Unions and the role they play in students' lives and in society. </p>

<p>'The truth is that students' unions are the very home of rigorous debate and new idea, and they are not funded by taxpayers' money.'</p>

<p>A NUS spokesperson added: 'This is a very poorly researched publication that contains a large number of serious errors and/or outright misinformation. </p>

<p>'At a time when we know people are worried about where to get trustworthy information online, it's especially concerning to see high profile politicians supporting something like this.'</p>
