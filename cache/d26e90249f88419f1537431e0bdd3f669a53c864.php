<p>Bottoms up! The Bachelor's Kirralee 'Kiki' Morris, 33, 'zapped the fat' with a Brazilian Butt Lift, showing off the procedure on her Instagram Stories on Saturday </p>

<p>Wearing a white T-shirt and a black G-string, a beautician was seen using a Cavitation machine to firm the skin around her buttocks and the front of her thighs.</p>

<p>The procedure, which she had done at Beautylicious by Sophie, costs $360.  </p>

<p>At least four sessions are recommended to not only sculpt the buttocks, but also migrate fat to the area and assist in the reduction of cellulite. </p>

<p>Kiki later showed off part of the results, drawing attention to her enviably trim pins in a plunging black top teamed with a matching mini-skirt.</p>

<p>Posing for a mirror selfie ahead of a night out, she added sky-high heels, styled her locks out, and enhanced her striking facial features with glamorous makeup. </p>

<p>It all comes about eight months after Kiki had her heart broken by love rat Ciarran.  </p>

<p>Over: Kiki split from Bachelor in Paradise bad boy Ciarran Stott (pictured) earlier this year </p>

<p>Kiki and Ciarran had started dating on the third season of Bachelor in Paradise, which was filmed in Fiji late last year.</p>

<p>Right before the finale, Ciarran told Kiki he was in love with her and wanted them to leave the show together without going through the formality of a rose ceremony.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the couple split just a few weeks after returning to Australia.</p>

<p>Ciarran, who rose to fame on Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette, apparently 'ghosted' Kiki and moved from Sydney to Melbourne. </p>

<p>Not meant to be: Right before the finale, Ciarran told Kiki he was in love with her and wanted them to leave the show together without going through the formality of a rose ceremony. Unfortunately, the couple split just a few weeks after returning to Australia </p>
